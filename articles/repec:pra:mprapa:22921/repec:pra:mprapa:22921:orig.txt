2:22:754:14:13:72:539:313:97:g_d0_f8:97:g_d0_f7:Abstract:  One  of  the  rude  awakenings  for  economists  from  the  current  recession  is  an  emerging  understanding  that
2:23:882:13:13:72:540:300:97:g_d0_f7:97:g_d0_f7:economics  has  gone  wild  with  its  highbrow  mathematical  models  that  bear  little  resemblance  to  reality.  The  failure
2:24:1012:13:13:72:540:287:97:g_d0_f7:97:g_d0_f7:of  economics  to  predict  and  solve  the  current  global  recession,  has  restored  the  ìdismal  scienceî  title  to  the
2:25:1139:13:13:72:539:274:97:g_d0_f7:97:g_d0_f7:profession.2  It  stems  from  the  cultish  fascination  with  Adam  Smithís  Invisible  Hand,  centered  around  the  belief  in
2:26:1269:13:13:72:540:261:97:g_d0_f7:97:g_d0_f7:the  efficient  market  hypothesis.3  This  fascination  exposes  analytical  holes  in  the  methodology  that  economics  has
2:27:1396:13:13:72:540:248:97:g_d0_f7:97:g_d0_f7:followed  lately,  as  economics  itself  has  moved  too  far  away  from  its  key  social  foundations.  This  situation  is
2:28:1523:13:14:72:540:235:97:g_d0_f7:97:g_d0_f9:incomprehensible  and  needs  redressing.  I  compiled  a  book  -  Selected  Readings  on  the  Anthropological  Bases  of
2:29:1646:14:13:72:540:221:97:g_d0_f9:97:g_d0_f7:Economic  Behavior,  Organization,  and  Control4    -  to  help  economists  and  others  get  back  in  touch  with  their
2:30:1770:13:13:72:540:208:97:g_d0_f7:97:g_d0_f7:genealogy.  This  current  paper  is  a  watered  down  version  of  the  introduction  to  Selected  Readings.  It  concludes  that
2:31:1902:13:13:72:540:195:97:g_d0_f7:97:g_d0_f7:real  life  is  neither  as  simple  nor  economic  as  economic  theory  sometimes  suggests.  In  fact,  and  for  much  of  human  history,
2:32:2044:13:13:72:540:182:97:g_d0_f7:97:g_d0_f7:non-economic  factors  and  forces  have  driven  economic  activities. Selected  Readings  provides  an  opportunity  for  reinforced
2:33:2178:13:13:72:540:169:97:g_d0_f7:97:g_d0_f7:focus  on  economics  principles.  Alone  and  detached  from  its  social  foundations  economics  has  a  future  only  as  fiction.  As
2:34:2316:13:13:72:540:156:97:g_d0_f7:97:g_d0_f7:serious  non-fiction,  economics  cannot  successfully  divorce  itself  from  its  elemental  foundations  in  the  social  sciences.  To
2:35:2454:13:13:72:540:143:97:g_d0_f7:97:g_d0_f7:advance  its  theory  in  the  past  economics  needed  to  borrow  from  mathematics  and  physics.  Such  learning  must  continue.
2:36:2587:13:14:72:540:130:97:g_d0_f7:97:g_d0_f7:However,  to  remain  policy-relevant  economics  cannot  wish  away  the  very  social  bases  upon  which  it  is  founded.  Without
2:37:2721:14:23:72:299:116:97:g_d0_f7:97:g_d0_f7:social foundations one might as well kiss economics goodbye.

3:41:2965:16:16:71:511:661:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f7:Crowds (1841 [1932]), Bernard M. Baruch observes that ìall economic movements, by their
3:42:3052:16:16:71:526:645:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:very nature, are motivated by crowd psychology. Ö Without the recognition of crowd-thinking
3:43:3143:16:16:71:530:629:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Ö our theories of economics leave much to be desired. It is a force wholly impalpable ñ perhaps
3:44:3238:16:16:71:517:613:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:little amenable to analysis and less to guidance ñ and yet, knowledge of it is necessary to right
3:45:3335:16:15:71:521:597:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:judgments on passing eventsî (p. xiii).5 What makes economic events so susceptible to crowd-
3:46:3427:15:16:71:519:582:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:psychology are the anthropological foundations beneath economic behavior, organization, and
3:47:3518:16:16:71:523:566:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:control. For an illustration of that claim, I turn to six prominent scholars whose work and ideas
3:48:3615:16:16:71:491:550:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:clarify the issues: Bronislaw Malinowski, Melville Herskovitz, Willaim A. Lewis, JoanV.
3:49:3702:16:25:71:277:534:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Robinson, Frank Knight, and Janos Kornai.

3:51:3774:25:16:72:540:484:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Bronislaw  Malinowskiís  influence  at  t he  intersection  of  anthropology  and  economics  is  well-
3:52:3877:16:16:72:540:468:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:known  to  all  social  scientists  ñ  or  it  should  be!  The  Argonauts    of  the  Western  Pacific  (1922
3:53:3987:16:16:72:540:452:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:[1961])  and  ìThe  Primitive  Economics  of  the  Trobriand  Islandersî  (1921)  are  classics  in
3:54:4086:16:16:72:540:436:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:economic  anthropology.  Both  dive  deep  int o   t he  behavior  of  so-called  primitive  societies  and
3:55:4193:16:16:72:540:420:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:bring  to  the  surface  a  clear  understanding  of  the  organized  activities  of  those  societies,  and  the
3:56:4306:16:15:72:539:404:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:eco no mic   and   non-economic   values   primitive   people   place   on   their   activities.6   Professor
3:57:4415:15:16:72:540:389:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Malinowskiís  work  helps  us  answer  the  question:  ìWhat  explains  the  economic  behavior,
3:58:4511:16:26:72:428:373:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:organization, and control of primitive societies, and presumably our own?î
3:59:4585:26:16:108:540:347:144:g_d0_f7:52:g_d0_f7:Clearly  Malinowskiís  answer  invokes  culture  and  the  ìdynamics  of  culture  change,î7
3:60:4677:16:16:72:540:331:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:subjects  he  has  written  on  with  great  authority  and  clarity  (cf.  White,  1959,  White  and
3:61:4778:16:15:72:540:315:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Dillingham, 1973).8  But  if  culture  is  so  important,  (1)  what   is  it,  and  (2)  how  does  it  influence
3:62:4892:15:16:72:540:300:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:and  govern  organized  behavior?  The  first  selection  in  the  collection  combines  Chapters  4  and  5
3:63:5000:16:16:72:539:284:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:of Malinowskiís book A Scientific Theory of Culture and Other Essays (1944). There, culture is
3:64:5094:16:16:72:540:268:144:g_d0_f7:52:g_d0_f7:defined  as  ìthe  integral  whole  consisting  of  implements  and  consumersí  goods  [and  services],9
3:65:5199:16:16:72:540:252:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:of constitutional charters for the various social groupings, of human ideas and crafts, beliefs and
3:66:5298:16:16:72:540:236:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:customs Ö by which man is able to cope with the concrete, specific problems that face himî (p.
3:67:5392:16:16:72:540:220:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:36).  Culture  allows  for  Rousseauís  social  contract  by  rewarding  and  punishing  behavior  that  is
3:68:5499:16:15:72:540:204:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:inconsistent  with  the  social  agreement.  The  incentives  to  behave  in  accordance  with  culture  can
3:69:5607:15:26:72:526:189:144:g_d0_f7:52:g_d0_f7:be quantifiable and therefore market determined, and/or they can be qualifiably norms-based.10
3:70:5701:26:16:108:539:163:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f9:Many  economists,  having  either  forgotten  or  not  read  Adam  Smithís  Theory  of  Moral
3:71:5794:16:16:72:539:147:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f7:Sentiments  (1976),  are  now  rediscovering  the  importance  of  rules  (including  normative  rules),
3:72:5898:16:16:72:539:131:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:mainly  as  described  by  social  scientists  like  James  Coleman  (1990).11  Paul  M.  Romer  (2009,
3:73:6001:16:16:72:540:115:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:2010)  talks  about  the  role  of  rules  in  long-run  growth  and  technological  change  in  his  new
3:74:6106:16:15:72:540:99:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:projects.12  Like  Malinowski,  but  from  a  different  angle,  Romerís  projects  distinguish  between
3:75:6210:15:0:72:540:84:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:activities  and  rules,  and  anticipates  greater  gains  from  trade  in  ideas  (rules)  than  in  conventional
4:76:6325:0:15:72:540:708:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:goods  and  services  in  which  trade  is  based  on  a  comparative  advantage.13  For  Malinowski
4:77:6425:15:16:72:540:693:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:ìactivities  depend  on  the  ability,  power,  honesty,  and  go o dwill  of  the  members,î  whereas  rules
4:78:6534:16:16:72:540:677:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:are  ìembodied  very  often  in  precepts,  texts,  and  regulations.î    Thus,  a  socio-economic  function
4:79:6642:16:16:72:540:661:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:depends  on  activities,  which  require  ìmaterial  apparatusî  or  ìobjectsî  in  Romerís  lingo   (Ro mer,
4:80:6751:16:16:72:540:645:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:1993).    The  material  apparatus  is  determined  by  personnel  and  norms  which  are  themselves
4:81:6852:16:26:72:298:629:144:g_d0_f7:52:g_d0_f7:determinants of the socio-economic ìcharterî.14
4:82:6899:26:15:108:540:603:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The  second  anthropological  base  of  economic  behavior,  organization,  and  control  in  this
4:83:6997:15:16:72:539:588:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:collection   comes   from   Melville   J.   Herskovitsís   Economic  Anthropology  (1952).  Professor
4:84:7098:16:16:72:539:572:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Herskovits  displays  great  familiarity  with  the  economics  of  Alfred  Marshall,  J.M.  Keynes,  J.R.
4:85:7204:16:16:72:539:556:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f9:Hicks,  L.  Robbins,  and  Frank  Knight.  But  even  he,  as  his  Chapter  3  in  Economic  Anthropology
4:86:7310:16:16:72:540:540:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:shows, was disturbed by the weak contact between ìAnthropology and Economicsî (his chapter
4:87:7400:16:16:72:540:524:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:title).  He  argues  that  the  distance  between  the  two  sister  disciplines  comes  from  the  fact  that
4:88:7510:16:16:72:540:508:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:ìeconomics Ö derives its data Ö from [the] culture as it exists, while anthropology Ö presents
4:89:7604:16:15:72:540:492:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:materials  having  to  do  with  all  phases  of  social  activity  in  civilizations  of  all  kindsî  (p.  42).
4:90:7717:15:16:72:540:477:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Today,   globalization   and   technological   progress   have   narrowed   the   distance   between   the
4:91:7823:16:16:72:540:461:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:disciplinary  division  of  labor,  which  Herskovits  was  observing.  The  t heo ries  of  economic  growth
4:92:7932:16:16:72:540:445:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:and   development   have   responded   favorably   and   with   enthusiasm   and   appreciation   of
4:93:8032:16:16:72:539:429:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f9:Herskovitsís  ideas.  For  example,  there  are  many  references  to  Herskovits  in  Lewisís  Theory  of
4:94:8138:16:16:72:540:413:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f7:Economic  Growth  (1955[1965]).  Herskovits  knew  of  Frank  Knightís  work,  and  Joan  Robinson
4:95:8236:16:15:71:539:397:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:cites  Malinowskiís.  In  fact ,  fully  defined  economics  is  no  longer  just  the  ìrelationship  between
4:96:8346:15:16:71:539:382:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:ends  and  scarce  means  which  have  alternative  usesî  so  that  it  is  no  longer  accurate  that  ìthe
4:97:8455:16:16:71:539:366:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:ëlawsí derived from [economic] data are the equivalent of a statistical average based on a single
4:98:8552:16:16:71:539:350:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:caseî  (p.45).  Now,  there  is  sufficient  recognition  even  among  the  orthodoxy  that  maximizing
4:99:8655:16:16:71:540:334:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:material  satisfaction  is  hardly  the  sole  objective  of  human  beings  (cf.  Herbert  Simon).15  Human
4:100:8763:16:16:71:539:318:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:satisfaction  itself  requires  a  lot  more  than  reso urce  optimization,  no  matter  how  restrictive  the
4:101:8874:16:15:71:539:302:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:budget  constraints.  That  point  is  not  new;  Marshall  defines  economics  broadly  as  ìthe  study  of

4:105:9308:16:16:71:539:239:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:anthropology  and  economics  recommends  itself  to  all  readers;  it  is  as  relevant  today  as  it  was
4:106:9417:16:16:71:539:223:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:more  than  60  years  ago  when  it  was  first  written.  Under  the  current  economic  conditions  it  is
4:107:9526:16:15:71:539:207:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:even  more  relevant  because  the  pursuit  of  narrow  equilibrium  (macro)economics  is  partly
4:108:9624:15:26:71:490:192:144:g_d0_f7:52:g_d0_f7:responsible for the 2007-todate mess (cf. Krugman, 2009, Foster and Magdoff, 2009).16
4:109:9709:26:16:108:540:166:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Although  ìAnthropology  and  Economicsî  is  a  very  good  chapter,  I  do  not  consider  it  to
4:110:9808:16:16:72:540:150:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:be  an  anthropological  base  of  economic  behavior,  organization,  and  control.  Instead  I  select
4:111:9912:16:16:72:540:134:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Chapter  1  on  ìeconomizing  and  rational  behavior.î  More  than  any  other,  this  selection  shows
4:112:10016:16:16:72:540:118:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:that  Herskovits  studied  Frank  Knight  well,  and  his  and  Knightís  ideas  made  their  way  into
4:113:10119:16:15:72:540:102:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Lewisís  work.  So,  ìeconomizing  and  rational  behaviorî  is  an  attempt  ìto  understand  the  cross-
4:114:10225:15:0:72:540:87:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:cultural  implications  of  the  process  of  economizingî  (p.  4).  This  is  an  important  task,  because
5:115:10335:0:15:72:540:708:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:ìchoices  are  dictated  not  only  by  the  alternatives  between  items,  but  by  the  patterns  of  the
5:116:10442:15:16:72:540:693:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:culture  of  the  individual  who,  in  the  final  analysis,  must  do  the  choosing,  [that  is]  economizing  is
5:117:10558:16:16:72:540:677:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:carried  on  in  a  cultural  matrixî  (p.  5).  In  that  respect,  quite  obviously,  economists  have  always
5:118:10670:16:16:72:540:661:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:distinguished   consumption   possibilities   from   consumer   choice,   for   example.   Consumption
5:119:10772:16:16:72:540:645:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:possibilities   depend   on   the   budget,   i.e.,   the   budget   constrains   or   enlarges   consumption
5:120:10881:16:16:72:539:629:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:opportunities ñ the ìfield of choiceî to use Robert Mundallís (1968)17  phrase.    But  since  not  all
5:121:10984:16:15:72:540:613:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:that  is  affordable  is  actually  purchased,  choice  involves  the  budget  as  well  as  consumer
5:122:11085:15:16:72:540:598:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:preferences  and  tastes  ñ  not  all  preferences  are  revealed,  Professor  Paul  Samuelson  would  say.
5:123:11192:16:16:72:540:582:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Preferences  and  tastes  are  specific  to  the  individual,  however,  the  maximization  of  preferences

5:125:11411:16:16:72:540:550:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:process of economizing Ö is essentially based on the broader organization of society,î (p.7) ñ an
5:126:11508:16:16:72:540:534:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:anthropological  recognition  that  informs  Frank  Knightís  writings.    Here  is  one  of  Herskovitsís

5:129:11839:16:16:72:540:487:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:relationships, [because] every single step in the [production and distribution] process is geared to
5:130:11939:16:16:72:540:471:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:a number of social interests which eventually ensure that the required step is takenî ( referring to
5:131:12039:16:26:72:261:455:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:p. 7 in Herskovits, or p. 46 in Polanyi). 
5:132:12081:26:16:108:540:429:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Again,  ìultimately  the  choices  of  individuals  [are]  influenced  by  the  co nsiderations  of

5:134:12288:16:15:72:540:397:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:individual  operating  as  a  member  of  his/her  society,  in  terms  of  the  culture  of  his/her  groupî(p.
5:135:12400:15:16:72:540:382:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:8).  Thus,  to  satisfy  the  individualís  choice,  the  objective  influence  of  resource  scarcity  has
5:136:12507:16:16:72:540:366:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:cultural weights attached to it, and those weights act as ìultimate sanctions to behavior that give

5:138:12700:16:26:72:379:334:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:universal, rational behavior is conditional upon cultural contexts.

5:140:12797:26:15:72:540:282:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Throughout  Economic  Anthropology  Professor  Herskovits  seems  convinced  of  a  one-way
5:141:12888:15:16:72:540:267:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:interaction   in   which   Anthropology   willingly   learns   from   Economics   whereas   Economics
5:142:12989:16:16:72:540:251:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:adamantly refuses any lesson from Anthropology. If that was the case at the time Herskovits was
5:143:13084:16:16:72:539:235:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:writing,  it  surely  was  not  the  case  in  regard  to  Sir  W.  Arthur  Lewis,  whose  work  makes  frequent
5:144:13196:16:16:72:541:219:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:reference  to  Herskovits,  Malinowski,  and  others.  Lewis  is  one  of  the  greatest  economists  of  all
5:145:13305:16:16:72:540:203:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:times and among the top growth and change economists of his time. However, many economists
5:146:13395:16:15:72:540:187:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:know  Lewis  only  through  his  famous  1954  paper  ñ  ìDevelopment  with  Unlimited  Supply  of

5:148:13601:16:16:72:539:156:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:was  really  for  the  Theory  of  Economic  Growth  which  was  written  well  before  ìDevelopment
5:149:13701:16:16:72:539:140:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f9:with  Unlimited  Supply  of  Labor,î  but  published  a  year  later  (1955).  The  Theory  of  Economic
5:150:13805:16:16:72:540:124:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f7:Growth stands tall among its peers even today. Its organizational structure alone is impressive. It
5:151:13904:16:16:72:540:108:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:posits  that  economic  growth  depends  on  specialized  factors  and  forces.    In  precise  order  of
5:152:14009:16:15:72:540:92:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:importance,  the  factors  and  forces  of  production  include  ìthe  will  to  economize,î  economic
5:153:14111:15:0:72:540:77:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:institutions,  knowledge,  capital,  population  and  other  natural  resources,  and  government.  The
6:154:14215:0:15:72:540:708:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:will  to  economize  places  first  on  the  list  of  the  proximate  causes  of  growth  because  ìgrowth  is
6:155:14326:15:16:71:539:693:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the   result   of   human   effortî   (p.23),   and   human   effo rt   is   partly   economic,   but   mainly
6:156:14436:16:26:71:148:677:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:anthropological.
6:157:14452:26:16:107:539:651:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Paul  Romer  (1993)19  and  Lewis  nearly  classify  the  sources  of  growth  the  same  way.
6:158:14546:16:16:72:540:635:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Factors   for   Lewis   are   ìobjectsî   for   Romer;   ìideasî   for   Romer   are   ìforcesî   for   Lewis.
6:159:14656:16:16:72:540:619:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Consequently  both  recognize  the  importance  of  scarcity  as  a  motivator  of  human  effort.
6:160:14754:16:16:72:540:603:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:However,  ìt he  will  to  economizeî  differs  across  economies  because  ìsocieties  differ  widely
6:161:14856:16:15:72:540:587:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:from   each   other   in   the   extent   to   which   their   members   seek   out   and   exploit   economic
6:162:14966:15:16:72:540:572:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:opportunitiesî  (p.??).  From  here  Lewis  articulates  the  three  distinct  causes  of  the  differences  in
6:163:15077:16:16:72:540:556:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:t he  will  to  economize  as  (1)  the  desire  for  wealth,  (2)  the  opportunity  benefit/cost  of  effort,  and
6:164:15193:16:16:72:540:540:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:(3)  the  intra-actions  and  interactions  of  resources  and  human  effort.  For  example,  in  societies
6:165:15301:16:16:72:540:524:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:where wealth confers social status, ìthe amount of effort given to producing wealth is a function
6:166:15398:16:16:72:540:508:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:of  the  desire  for  wealthî  (p.  27).  Culture  is  an  important  part  of  this,  because,  for  example,  ìif
6:167:15513:16:15:72:541:492:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the  cultureís  musical  appreciation  is  at  a  low  level,  there  is  little  [demand]  for  musical
6:168:15617:15:16:72:540:477:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:instruments  or  for  musical  entertainments.  Similarly,  the  theat re,  t he  cinema,  the  sport  stadium,
6:169:15728:16:16:72:540:461:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the  dance  hall,  and  similar  purveyors  of  mass  entertainment  depend  upon  the  nature  of  the
6:170:15831:16:26:72:344:445:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:peopleís cultureî (p. 23, cf. Malinowski and Herskovits).
6:171:15888:26:16:108:540:419:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Even  within  one  culture,  opportunity  benefits/costs  of  choice  differ  across  individuals,
6:172:15986:16:15:72:540:403:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:and  hence  influence  differently  ìthe  attitude  to  workî  and  entrepreurial  ìspiritî.  Work  attitudes
6:173:16095:15:16:72:540:388:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:and  spirit  depend  on  various  cultural  prejudices,  so  that,  even  though  growth  is  a  function  of
6:174:16204:16:16:72:540:372:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:resources  and  how  efficiently  they  are  used,  ìthe  connection  between  the  richness  of  resources

6:176:16418:16:26:72:112:340:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:growth. 
6:177:16426:26:16:108:540:314:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The  first  two  selections  in  the  proposed  book  clarify  the  anthropological  foundations  of
6:178:16526:16:16:72:540:298:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:economic  behavior.  The  third  selection  is  an  empirical  testament  to  the  importance  of  economic
6:179:16633:16:15:72:540:282:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:and non-economic factors and forces to growth. The next selection demonstrates how history and
6:180:16727:15:16:72:540:267:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:culture  have  created  one  of  the  first  and  largest  human  organizations:  society.  This  is  Chapter  1
6:181:16839:16:16:72:540:251:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:of  Professor  Joan  V.  Robinsonís  Freedom  and  Necessity  (1970),  which  tells  us  about  how
6:182:16938:16:16:72:540:235:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:societies began and how they have evolved over time. She argues that ìthe pressure of technical
6:183:17033:16:16:72:541:219:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:conditions  has  carved  out  the  multiplicity  of  creatures  who  appear  to  us  so  marvelously
6:184:17133:16:16:72:540:203:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:ëdesignedí   for   the   life   they   leadî   (p.10).   Behind   that   marvelous   variability,   scarcity   has
6:185:17247:16:15:72:540:187:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:compelled   language   development.   Thus,   ìthe   distinctive   characteristic   of   mankind   is   the
6:186:17354:15:16:72:540:172:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:invention of language that conveys information about things not present and permits speculation
6:187:17449:16:16:72:540:156:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:about  things  not  known.  The  apes  have  manners,  it  is  language  that  makyth  man"  (p.  21).  Once
6:188:17557:16:16:72:540:140:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:scarcity  was  acknowledged,  it  was  not  a  long  leap  from  there  to  having  communities  use  force
6:189:17664:16:16:72:540:124:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:(war)  to  protect  "things  present  and  speculate  (sic)  about  things  not  known."  Soon  you  have
6:190:17769:16:16:72:540:108:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:"isolated societies," and distinct races and classes. Warfare became "the most frequent origin" of
6:191:17867:16:15:72:540:92:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:"property." Further still, whatever warfare was unable to deliver, trade provided. Moreover, upon
6:192:17964:15:0:72:540:77:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the  ìdiscoveryî  of  America,  foreign  trade  became  associated  with  personal  liberty,  and  foreign
7:193:18071:0:15:72:540:708:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:trade and the desire for personal liberty motivated investment for profit. Thus, profit became the
7:194:18169:15:26:72:235:693:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:focal point of capitalist expansion.
7:195:18205:26:16:108:540:667:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:We  know  that  Robinsonís  description  of  society  has  anthropological  grounds.  I  let  her
7:196:18302:16:16:72:540:651:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:speak  for  herself  on  that.  However,  I  would  remark  as  a  motivation  that  whereas  Malinowski
7:197:18406:16:16:72:540:635:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:describes  the  behavior  of  individual  isolates,  Robinson  that  ìlanguage  and  the  social  and
7:198:18507:16:16:72:540:619:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:technical   innovations   which   made   it   possible   obviously   had   survival   value.   Ö   But   once
7:199:18616:16:16:72:540:603:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:conceptual  thought  had  been  arrived  at,  it  proved  to  have  enormous  possibilities  that  were  Ö
7:200:18722:16:15:72:540:587:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:surplus  to  the  requirements  of  physical  existence,  i.e.,  the  acquisition  of  language  [had]  other
7:201:18831:15:16:72:540:572:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:necessary properties, over and above its technical advantage for survivalî (p. 23). Thus, from an
7:202:18928:16:16:72:540:556:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:anthropological  viewpoint,  ìthe  economic  activity  Ö  gives  the  creatures  Ö  an  object  in  life
7:203:19032:16:16:72:540:540:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:beyond  merely  keeping  alive,  [because]  with  the  capacity  for  reflection  that  language  gave  him,
7:204:19140:16:16:72:540:524:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:man  built  up  numerous  patterns  of  connections  by  birth  and  marriage,  [so  that]  economic  life
7:205:19246:16:16:72:540:508:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:was woven into each pattern in a system of claims and dutiesî (p. 24). Referring to Malinowski,
7:206:19341:16:15:72:540:492:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Robinson  points  out  that  the  per  capita  incomes  of  so-called  primitive  and  ìisolated  economiesî
7:207:19449:15:16:72:540:477:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:are  lower  than  those  of  so-called  civilized  economies.  ìYet  for  many  of  them  [socalled
7:208:19548:16:16:72:540:461:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:uncivilized  economies]  the  proportion  of  energy,  skill,  and  mental  activity  devoted  to  non-
7:209:19651:16:16:72:540:445:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:economic  aims  was  much  greater  than  it  is  with  us  [socalled  civilized  eco no mies].î  Hence,  for
7:210:19760:16:16:72:539:429:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:primitive  economies  high  economic  productivity  suggests  that  efforts  are  best  used  in  their  non-
7:211:19869:16:16:72:540:413:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:economic  alternatives.  In  such  cases  surplus  accumulation  and/or  decumulation  does  not  require
7:212:19974:16:15:72:540:397:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:economic  incentives  as  ìthe  economic  life  [is]  thus  organized  around  non-economic  purposesî
7:213:20076:15:26:72:107:382:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:(p. 26).
7:214:20084:26:16:108:540:356:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Because  economic  activities  really  depend  on  non-economic  activities,  it  means  that
7:215:20177:16:16:72:540:340:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:people  need  another  layer  of  social  economic  organization  more  global  than  the  individual  and
7:216:20283:16:16:72:540:324:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:more  local  than  society.  One  of  the  first  systematic  studies  of  such  an  organization  is  Max
7:217:20389:16:15:72:539:308:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Weberís Theory  of  Social  and  Economic  Organization  (1920).  But  beyond  academic  circles
7:218:20485:15:16:72:540:293:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Weberís  theory  did  not  take  off  immediat ely  for  good  reasons.  One  reason  may  be  because  it
7:219:20591:16:16:72:540:277:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:was  written  in  German,  which  is  not  as  common  a  language  internationally  as  English.  Another
7:220:20697:16:16:72:539:261:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:is   that   Gerth   and   Mills   (1958),20   and   James   Coleman   (1990)   characterize   the   Weberian
7:221:20805:16:16:72:540:245:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:organization  as  a  ìhierarchical  bureaucracy,î  which  generally  alienates  social  actions  from  the
7:222:20911:16:16:72:540:229:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:social actors who produce them. In this way Weberís social and economic organization behaves
7:223:21003:16:15:72:539:213:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:like  military  institut ions.21  Coleman  finds  Weberís  hierarchy  particularly  in  error  for  ignoring
7:224:21111:15:16:72:540:198:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:that  ìthe  persons  who  are  employed  to  fill  the  positions  in  the  organization  [t he  bureaucrats
7:225:21219:16:16:72:539:182:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:themselves]  are  purposive  actors  as  wellî  (p.  423).22  From  what  I  understood  listening  to  the
7:226:21326:16:16:72:539:166:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:2009  Nobel  Lectures  in  Economic  Sciences,  the  winners  Oliver  Williamson  and  Olinor  Ostrom
7:227:21427:16:16:72:540:150:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:have  sought  to  clarify  conceptual  as  well  as  practical  issues  in  organizational  theory,  such  as
7:228:21536:16:16:72:540:134:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Weberís  blindspot.23  I  say  no  more  on  that,  taking  comfort  in  the  supposition  that  the  standard
7:229:21646:16:16:72:540:118:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:characterization  of  social  economic  organization  in  Business,  Finance,  and  Economics  has
7:230:21744:16:15:72:540:102:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:followed  Frank  Knight  (1933).  The  supposition  is  not  unreasonable  since  Knight  was  himself  a
7:231:21849:15:0:72:455:87:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:keen student of Weber having translated The General Economic History (1946).
8:232:21926:0:15:108:540:708:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:According  to  Knight  the  definition  of  economics  found  in  textbooks  ìfalls  int o   [the]  error
8:233:22031:15:16:72:539:693:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:of  including  virtually  all  intelligent  behaviorî  (p.  4).    Moreover,  Knight  still  ìsees  clearly  that
8:234:22144:16:16:72:540:677:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:life must be more than economics, or rational conduct, or the intelligent accurate manipulation of
8:235:22242:16:16:72:540:661:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:materials  and  use  of  power  in  advancing  results,  [for]  such  a  view  is  too  narrowî  (p.  4).
8:236:22347:16:16:72:540:645:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Moreover,  ìliving  is  an  art;  and  art  is  more  than  a  matter  of  a  scientific  t echnique,  and  the
8:237:22458:16:16:72:540:629:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:richness  and  value  of  life  are  largely  bound  up  in  the  ëmoreí.î  Thus,  ìcivilization  should  look
8:238:22568:16:15:72:540:613:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:forward to a day when the material production of industrial activity should become rather its by-
8:239:22665:15:16:72:540:598:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:product, and its primary significance shall be that of a sphere for creative self-expression and the
8:240:22765:16:16:72:540:582:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:development  of  a  higher  type  of  individual  and  of  human  fellowshipî  (p.  4).  In  this  case
8:241:22868:16:16:72:540:566:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:ìeconomics  deals  with  the  social  organization  of  economic  activityî  (p.  5),  and  economic
8:242:22968:16:26:72:364:550:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:optimization for its own sake does not mean much to Knight!
8:243:23027:26:16:108:540:524:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:A  Knightian  social  economic  organization  is  present  when  different  activities  are  carried
8:244:23127:16:16:72:540:508:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:out in a coordinated way  for  a  common purpose (cf. p. 5). Such an organization would exist for
8:245:23224:16:15:72:540:492:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the  five  distinct  reasons.  The  functions  are  carried  out  because  of  the  gains  from  specialization
8:246:23335:15:16:72:541:477:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:they  provide.  Resource  scarcity  compels  choice,  but  where  there  are  gains  there  are  also  social
8:247:23444:16:16:72:540:461:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:costs    of    specialization,    technical    costs    of    organization,    and    unavoidable    costs    of
8:248:23556:16:16:72:540:445:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:interdependence.  To  illustrate  this  point,  Knight  gives  different  types  of  organization,  one  of
8:249:23663:16:16:72:540:429:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:which  is  ìt he  authoritarian  or  militaristic  systemî  (p.  16).  Thus,  a  Weberian  organization  is  a
8:250:23773:16:25:72:264:413:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:special case of a Knightian organization.
8:251:23814:25:16:108:540:388:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:What regulates the organization as a whole, and/or its parts? Economic orthodoxy would
8:252:23900:16:16:72:539:372:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:say only  the  price  system.  This  is  the  standard  answer  in  which  economic  agents  respond  to
8:253:24004:16:16:72:540:356:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:incentives  via  the  forces  of  demand  and  supply  through  either  factor  and/or  product  markets.
8:254:24109:16:16:72:540:340:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Again  the  answer  presumes  that  all  social  agents  are  economic  agents  and  that  they  all  pursue
8:255:24217:16:16:72:539:324:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:economic  objectives  all  the  time.24  Such  a  control  mechanism,  while  not  entirely  false,  is
8:256:24320:16:15:72:540:308:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:unacceptable even to Knight. By including J. Kornai (1981) I am suggesting that prices are value
8:257:24416:15:16:72:540:293:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:judgments  that  index  norms,  such  that  we  can  think  of  economic  behavior  and  organization  as
8:258:24521:16:26:72:412:277:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:controlled by norms. Norms are anthropological expressions of culture.
8:259:24591:26:16:108:540:251:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:There  is  no  doubt  that  economic  behavior  and  organization  are  dynamic  systems.  The
8:260:24685:16:16:72:540:235:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:works  of  Oliver  Williamson  and  Olinor  Ostrom,  which  the  Nobel  Prize  Co mmittee  recognized
8:261:24786:16:16:72:539:219:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:this  year  (2009),  describe  the  complexities  of  such  systems.  But  long  before  Williamson  and
8:262:24890:16:16:72:540:203:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Ostrom,  J.  Kornai  ìdeveloped  [non-price]  models  for  decentralized  economic  control  by  means
8:263:24992:16:15:72:540:187:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:of  normsî  (p.26),  where  a  norm  ìis  nothing  else  but  the  statistical  average  of  the  actual
8:264:25096:15:16:72:540:172:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:behaviorî  (p.  27).  In  other  words,  a  norm  is  ìthe  typical  value  of  any  of  the  economic  systemís
8:265:25208:16:16:72:540:156:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:behavioral  variables,  representing  an  average  social  practiceî  (p.  114).  Norms  regulate  the
8:266:25310:16:16:72:540:140:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:behavior  of  production  organizations,  for  instance,  and  control  by  norms  emphasizes  the
8:267:25408:16:16:72:540:124:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:regularity  and  social-necessity  of  the  systemís  behavior  rather  than  its  individual  optimality.
8:268:25514:16:16:72:540:108:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:ìNormingî  behavior  do es  no t   require  a  steady  state  to  obtain,  only  that  movement  is  toward  a

8:270:25720:15:0:72:302:77:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:over time in terms of change in normsî (p. 115).
9:271:25769:0:25:90:165:708:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:3.   Conclusion
9:272:25784:25:16:72:519:683:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The idea of this paper can be summarized as an interrelation between anthropological bases as
9:273:25877:16:16:72:527:667:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:articulated by Malinowski and Herskovits and economic behavior and organization as described
9:274:25969:16:16:72:531:651:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:by W. Arthur Lewis, Joan Robinson, and Frank Knight, and how norms control this interrelation
9:275:26062:16:16:72:489:635:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:according to Janos Kornai. From this discussion one may conclude that the failure of the
9:276:26150:16:16:72:529:619:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:economics profession, perhaps a large part of it, in predicting the Great Recession of 2007-2010 can
9:277:26250:16:16:72:529:603:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:be attributed to disciplinary self-absorption. The belief in the invincibility of markets on the basis of a
9:278:26357:16:15:72:528:587:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:further belief that society depends entirely on the behavior of atomistic economic agents all pursuing
9:279:26459:15:16:72:509:572:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:their self-interests simultaneously all the time is held firmly by some economists. The danger this
9:280:26558:16:16:72:510:556:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:time was that the ìsomeî were either actual policy-makers or those entrusted with raising future
9:281:26654:16:16:72:528:540:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:policy-makers. Real life is neither as simple nor as economic. In fact, and for much of human history
9:282:26755:16:26:72:455:524:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:and anthropology, non-economic factors and forces have driven economic activities.
9:283:26837:26:15:108:540:498:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:From   the   anthropological   viewpoint,   non-economic   variables   like   culture   govern   most
9:284:26938:15:16:72:540:483:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:economic  behavior  and  organization.  This  is  not  a  new  rationalization.  What  is  troubling  is  that  the
9:285:27053:16:16:72:540:467:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:mathematical  arrogance  o f  so me  economists,  and  the  unquestioning  positivism  and  scientificism  of
9:286:27162:16:16:72:540:451:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:some  modern  economics  continue  to  blind  even  the  best  students  of  the  profession.  In  that  respect
9:287:27274:16:16:72:539:435:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f7:Selected  Readings  provides  an  opportunity  for  reinforced  focus  on  economics  principles.  Hence,
9:288:27379:16:16:71:539:419:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:another  conclusion  is  that  alone  economics  has  a  future  only  as  fiction.  As  serious  non-fiction,
9:289:27489:16:15:71:539:403:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:economics  cannot  successfully  divorce  itself  from  its  elemental  foundations  in  the  social  sciences.  To

9:291:27710:16:16:71:539:372:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:learning  must  continue.  However,  to  remain  policy-relevant  economics  cannot  wish  away  the  very
