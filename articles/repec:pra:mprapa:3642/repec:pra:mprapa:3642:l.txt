2:14:320:14:14:90:526:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:This research project tries to show that a unified discourse and a single global policy for 
2:15:412:14:14:90:526:612:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:liberalization and competition cuts across the economic and legal theory of transnational 
2:16:502:14:13:90:525:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:regulations of industry. The tension mediated by the concepts of harmonization, meaning

2:18:684:14:14:90:527:571:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:international  liberalization,  meaning  deregulation  is  better  that  regulation,  brings  many

3:56:2953:13:14:89:92:695:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: 
3:57:2953:14:14:89:525:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:The present of International Economic Law is the legal system of international trade and 
3:58:3042:14:13:89:526:667:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:the  WTO.  The  future,  however,  is  the  transnational  regulation  of  industry.  Certainly,  
3:59:3140:13:14:89:527:654:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:since  the  1980s,  regulations  of  different  industries  have  had  a  transnational  impact.  
3:60:3238:14:14:89:525:640:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Regulation of financial markets and certain environmental regulation, among others, are 
3:61:3326:14:14:89:524:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:examples of this phenomenon, which rapidly expanded to several other areas of industrial 
3:62:3415:14:14:89:525:612:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:regulation after it attracted the attention of legal and economic scholarship1. Despite their 
3:63:3509:14:13:89:526:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:interest,  however,  only  a  few  scholars  have  been  critically  concerned  about  one  of  the  
3:64:3610:13:14:89:526:585:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:most  important  theoretical  constructions  behind  the  expansion  of  industrial  regulation:  
3:65:3708:14:14:89:527:571:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:regulation  harmonization.  Harmonization  has  been  studied  in  the  economic  literature,  
3:66:3803:14:14:89:527:557:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:mostly  related  to  financial,  stock  markets  and  antitrust  regulation,  leading  usually  to  
3:67:3903:14:14:89:527:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:conclusions  highlighting  the  advantages  of  harmonization2  for  liberalization,  free  trade  
3:68:4002:14:13:90:525:529:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:and competition3.  Nevertheless,  despite  of  the  evident  tension  in  concomitant  discourses  
3:69:4101:13:14:90:526:516:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:for  liberalization  and  regulation4,  it  is  unbelievable  how,  when  referring  to  transnational  
3:70:4205:14:14:90:485:502:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:regulation scholars seem to forget asking if harmonization is a result of capture.5

3:72:4291:14:14:90:526:474:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:The  goal  in  this  research  project  is  to  show  that  a  unified  discourse  and  a  single  global  
3:73:4398:14:13:90:527:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:policy  for  liberalization  and  competition  cuts  across  the  economic  and  legal  theory  of  
3:74:4498:13:14:90:525:447:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:transnational regulations of industry, and this inherent tension reveals regulatory capture. 
3:75:4591:14:14:90:528:433:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:The  evident  tension  is  mediated  by  the  concept  of  harmonization,  meaning  that  one  
3:76:4686:14:14:90:530:419:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:regulation/standard   is   better   that   multiple   regulations/standards,   and   the   theory   of   
3:77:4791:14:14:90:525:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:international liberalization, meaning deregulation is better that regulation. The concept of 
3:78:4884:14:14:90:526:391:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:harmonization  is  mediating  such  tension  since  it  is  discriminately  regarded  as  beneficial  
3:79:4986:14:13:90:527:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:for  certain  markets  but  prejudicial  for  other  markets,  and  this  inconsistency  is  just  an  
3:80:5089:13:14:90:525:364:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:effect of capture. The core of my project is to restate the problem of regulatory capture at

3:103:7271:12:0:90:504:74:102:g_d0_f6:102:g_d0_f6:F:meaning of capture and the importance of the concept of capture for structuralism and critical realism.

4:110:7819:14:14:89:527:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:is  trying  to  find  a  framework  to  explain  why  harmonization,  as  a  legal  concept,  is

4:145:10338:12:16:90:524:159:42:g_d0_f6:102:g_d0_f6:F:9 Structuralism refers, broadly, to the genealogy and structure of meaning in several epistemes. Here we are 
4:146:10447:16:12:89:525:143:102:g_d0_f6:102:g_d0_f6:F:not  referring  to  the  work  of  Saussure  and  others  but  the  work  of  Michel  Foucault.  We  are  cataloguing  
4:147:10566:12:11:89:525:131:102:g_d0_f6:102:g_d0_f6:F:Foucault  as  structuralist  despite  of  his  rejection  to  catalogue  his  work  as  structural.  However,  his  early  
4:148:10689:11:11:89:524:120:102:g_d0_f6:102:g_d0_f6:F:work, which is the one I will use, is structural and there is no other reason but passion to reject it as a part

5:158:11376:14:14:90:530:640:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:The   latter   is   the   main   concern   of   Foucaultís   structural   philosophy,   which,   using   
5:159:11481:14:14:90:527:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:genealogy13  shows  the  (cor)relation  between  power,  law  and  truth14.  Foucaultís  main  
5:160:11576:14:14:90:525:612:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:problem  is  the  why of the how  of  power15;  this  is  the  mechanisms  related  to  the  formal  
5:161:11677:14:13:89:527:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:delimitation  of  power  and  the  effect  that  truth  produces  and  transmits.  His  question,  
5:162:11776:13:14:89:527:585:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:relevant  for  our  analysis  of  capture,  is:  ìwhat  rules  of  right  are  implemented  by  the  
5:163:11877:14:14:89:525:571:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:relations  of  power  in  the  production  of  discourses  of  truth?î  or  ìwhat  type  of  power  is

5:167:12113:13:14:90:526:516:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Indeed, in the case of industrial regulation, this power comes from knowledge produced, 
5:168:12201:14:14:90:527:502:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:sponsored  and  legitimized  by  transnational  corporations  that  is  transformed  in  national  
5:169:12300:14:14:90:529:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:and  transnational  regulation  by  harmonization.  As  Foucault  concludes,  the  relation  
5:170:12393:14:14:90:526:474:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:between  power,  truth  and  law  is  definitively  economical  since  they  ìmust  produce  truth  
5:171:12493:14:13:90:525:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:as  we  must  produce  wealthî,  and  ìÖmust  produce  truth  in  order  to  produce  wealthî17. 
5:172:12590:13:14:89:525:447:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Truth and power produce law, because ìwe areÖ subjected to truth in the sense in which

5:175:12724:14:14:89:524:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:In addition, Foucault reads power as something ìemployed and exercisedî that works in a

5:177:12915:13:14:90:525:378:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:act as vehicles and ends of regulation. In synthesis, power is understood as a practice, an 
5:178:13007:14:14:90:528:364:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:exercise,  executed  through  knowledge  and  the  law.  The  law,  thus,  works  just  as  a

5:198:14423:11:16:90:525:125:42:g_d0_f6:102:g_d0_f6:F:20  The  concept  of  normalization  is  essential  in  Foucaultís  thought  and  in  the  so  called,  Foucault  effect  in  
5:199:14549:16:12:89:526:109:102:g_d0_f6:102:g_d0_f6:F:social  and  political  sciences.  The  word  "normal"  refers  to  the  categorization  of  people,  cultures,  legal  
5:200:14669:12:11:89:525:97:102:g_d0_f6:102:g_d0_f6:F:systems,  etcetera,  as  opposed  to  forms  considered  "abnormal".  Definitely,  it  is  the  result  of  incentives  to  
5:201:14793:11:12:89:524:86:102:g_d0_f6:102:g_d0_f6:F:standardize  and  achieve  conformity  with  determined  norms/rules/regulation.  Normalization  is  the  product

9:357:28183:14:14:89:524:695:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:liberalization increases transnational competition; more transnational competition induces 
9:358:28274:14:14:89:524:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:firms to take more risks; and thus there is need of harmonized sophisticated transnational 
9:359:28365:14:13:89:525:667:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:regulation. Second, harmonization of regulation leads to improvements in the control of 
9:360:28453:13:14:89:527:654:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:transnational  industrial  activity  because,  according  to  the  economic  literature,  neither  
9:361:28552:14:14:89:528:640:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:regulatory  competition  nor  coordination  of  national  policies42  conducted  to  optimal

9:395:31472:7:16:90:524:159:42:g_d0_f6:102:g_d0_f6:F:43 I agree with the latter statement but not with the conclusion which leads to favor global harmonization as

10:405:32403:14:14:90:531:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:to   propose   or   impose   harmonization   of   regulation   on   its   different   stages.   The   
10:406:32505:14:13:90:525:667:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:methodology we will use is to analyze the inner tensions in these policies. As a matter of 
10:407:32596:13:14:90:526:654:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:fact, comparing harmonized regulations and its goals indicate the contradictions that the

10:409:32782:14:14:90:527:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:industries.  We  expect  to  prove  that  the  growth  of  the  economics  of  harmonization  of  
10:410:32880:14:14:90:530:612:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:regulation   is   linked   with   transnational   corporate   interest   to   extend   the   gains   of

10:412:33081:13:14:90:526:585:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:international  economic  law  began  to  support  it  as  the  new  best  option  for  international

10:418:33498:14:14:90:528:502:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:there  is  a  differentiated  discourse  of  harmonization  for  certain  industry  regulation  as  
10:419:33598:14:14:90:528:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:antitrust,  intellectual  property  and  financial  markets  but  it  is  not  applicable  for  other

10:424:34078:14:14:90:526:419:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:global corporate governance increases the power of corporate boards and managers over

10:427:34214:13:14:90:525:378:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:We have exposed why there is enough evidence to assume that it is possible to show how

10:429:34398:14:14:90:525:350:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f6:B:regulation. The aforementioned architecture of the concept of harmonization shows that 
10:430:34485:14:14:90:528:336:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:an  extensive  capture  of  regulation/regulators  is  in  play,  and  the  increasing  idea  of  a  
10:431:34586:14:13:90:526:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:selective global legal harmonization has a key role in the escalating size of transnational 
10:432:34678:13:14:90:525:309:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:corporations. Indeed, it is not that harmonized legal systems require big corporations, but 
10:433:34770:14:14:90:366:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:that big corporations require harmonized legal systems.

10:442:35099:13:14:90:528:171:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:not  simple.  As  I  stated  in  the  first  paragraphs,  the  international  economic  policy  of  
10:443:35199:14:14:90:526:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:standardization of industrial regulation is the product of false impressions that lead to an 
10:444:35292:14:23:90:525:143:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:illusion. The theory has highlighted such illusion in several ways46, but what seems to be

11:450:35745:0:14:89:526:709:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:more  interesting  is  how  it  is  possible  to  find  a  correlated  tension  between  several  free

11:455:36124:14:14:89:524:640:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:The main point is the tension in the meta-theory free-markets and the theory standardized 
11:456:36214:14:14:89:524:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:industrial regulation. Indeed, the coexistence of markets and freedom is and ordoliberal47 
11:457:36304:14:14:89:527:612:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:idea48  where  the  role  of  the  State  is  simply  to  organize  markets  and  not  direct  or  plan  
11:458:36409:14:13:90:525:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:them, since such intervention goes against freedom. Here, we can emphasize a theoretical 
11:459:36498:13:14:90:525:585:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:tension between the Austrian or libertarian model, where freedom and institutions are not 
11:460:36588:14:14:90:527:571:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:to  be  designed,  but  should  arise  through  cooperation49.  Thus,  the  neoclassical  faith  in  
11:461:36689:14:14:90:526:557:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:institutional design and the libertarian idea of a spontaneous order show the first tension 
11:462:36781:14:14:90:525:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:in the discourse of these models. If freedom leads to self regulation, why markets must be 
11:463:36872:14:13:90:146:529:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:regulated?

11:467:37083:14:14:90:526:474:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:enough evidence to distrust of the theoretical constructions and the knowledge structures 
11:468:37173:14:13:90:526:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:and schemas that have aroused from the contemporary economic discourse. Not only its

11:470:37366:14:14:90:380:433:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:to distrust on the results of such theoretical constructions50.

14:616:49006:14:14:89:525:433:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:After  describing  these  approaches,  several  questions  arise.  Based  in  the  global  analysis,  
14:617:49108:14:14:89:525:419:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:the metascript of markets is grounded in the idea of freedom and competition. If it is so, 
14:618:49199:14:14:89:524:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:why not to maintain a market approach where only those disciplined financial institutions 
14:619:49289:14:14:89:525:391:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:survive? Why, if the consumer is sovereign, there must be just one regulation concerning 
14:620:49378:14:13:89:525:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:to  capital  regulation?  In  the  answer  to  these  questions  we  can  find  the  inner  tensions  in  
14:621:49484:13:14:89:526:364:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:the  discourse  of  international  industrial  regulation  of  Banking70.  Risk  seems  to  be  the

14:623:49685:14:14:90:527:336:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:does  is  increase  concentrations  and  impede  competition.  Thus,  the  highly  appreciated  
14:624:49781:14:13:90:525:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:freedom in the global money flow discourse is in a constant tension with the regulation of

16:700:56323:14:14:90:529:640:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:mult ilateral   treaties79  that  oblige  them  to  comply  and  harmonize  their  intellectual  
16:701:56420:14:14:90:528:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:property  legislation.  And  it  is  not  a  surprise  that  such  regime  follows  the  structure  
16:702:56520:14:14:90:527:612:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:established  in  the  group  of  countries  that  have  an  intensive  production  of  intellectual

16:706:56917:14:14:90:430:557:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:should be the one already defined in countries as the UK and the US?

16:710:57040:14:14:90:525:502:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:We hope we have exposed why there is sufficient evidence to assume that it is possible to 
16:711:57130:14:14:90:528:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:talk  about  an  international  regime  of  industrial  regulation.  The  architecture  of  such  
16:712:57228:14:14:90:526:474:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:regime could make capture of international regulators easier and the increasing idea of a 
16:713:57318:14:13:90:526:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:global legal harmonization plays a key role in the escalating size of corporations in the 
16:714:57408:13:14:90:159:447:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:whole world.

16:716:57422:14:14:90:527:419:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:What  make  interesting  and  evident  the  problems  and  ideas  we  just  highlighted  is  the  
16:717:57520:14:14:90:526:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:theoretical  tensions  that  freedom,  markets  and  regulation  have.  The  inner  contradictions  
16:718:57620:14:13:90:525:391:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:in the different industrial regimes lead to just one final effect, higher concentrations. Two 
16:719:57714:13:14:90:529:378:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:questions  arise  here:  is  harmonization  of  a  shared  industrial  interest  that  leads  to  
16:720:57812:14:14:90:528:364:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:prosperity  -  wealth  and  growth?  Or  is  harmonization  a  way  to  reduce  the  costs  of  
16:721:57908:14:14:90:528:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:concentration  and  market  power?  In  our  perspective,  legal  harmonization  is  set  as  a  
16:722:58005:14:14:90:525:336:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:mechanism to increase freedom, smooth international trade and control market power but 
16:723:58092:14:13:90:524:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f8:B:its  result  is  simply  more  and  easier  mechanism  to  industry  concentrations.  Convergence 
16:724:58190:13:14:90:531:309:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:C:of   antitrust   laws   increase   industry   concentration; capital   adequacy   of   financial   
16:725:58289:14:14:90:524:295:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:C:institutions beget greater market concentrations; the whole idea intellectual property as a 
16:726:58381:14:14:90:526:281:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f6:B:mechanism  to  promote  growth,  cause  concentrations;  In  addition,  the  idea  of  a  global  
16:727:58479:14:14:90:527:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:corporate  governance,  increases  the  likelihood  to  concentrate  and  maintain  the  global  
16:728:58576:14:13:90:526:253:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:structure of corporations. We could go on and on reviewing literature and market effects 
16:729:58665:13:14:90:527:240:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:to  show  how  the  contradiction  of  freedom,  markets  and  regulations  are  just  a  chimera,  
16:730:58765:14:14:90:527:226:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:where  the  law  produced  by  the  State,  or  a  league  of  States,  is  just  an  illusion  and  the  
16:731:58871:14:22:90:436:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:knowledge structures behind them are just a normalization technology.
