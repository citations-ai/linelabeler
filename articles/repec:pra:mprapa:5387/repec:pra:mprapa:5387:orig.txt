2:15:381:18:14:156:470:499:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:The paper is about application of evolutionary concept, particu-
2:16:445:14:13:140:469:485:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:larly the application of natural selection process, to the study of movie
2:17:518:13:14:140:470:472:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:industry. The importance of the application is that it allows for the
2:18:587:14:13:140:470:458:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:heterogeneity and interdependency of market agents in analyzing the
2:19:654:13:14:140:470:445:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:economic choice decision. This complexity always presentsan obstacle
2:20:722:14:13:140:469:431:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:to the study of market behavior, especially when one has to take into
2:21:791:13:14:140:470:418:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:account the constant reinforcing effects among the variables, which
2:22:858:14:14:140:470:404:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:often renders the problem elusive. The paper intends to explain the
2:23:925:14:13:140:469:390:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:economic process, particularly the evolution of exhibition contract,
2:24:993:13:14:140:469:377:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:taking into account this complexity through the use of evolutionary
2:25:1060:14:13:140:179:363:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:concept.

2:28:1145:39:27:110:246:297:17:g_d0_f10:17:g_d0_f10:1  Introduction
2:29:1160:27:14:110:499:270:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Economic problems usually do not follow the reductionist approach, rather,
2:30:1234:14:15:110:499:256:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the analysis on economic choices sometimes requires us to lookinto the inter-
2:31:1311:15:14:110:499:241:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:connectedness and heterogeneity of agents and the process which the choices
2:32:1386:14:14:110:499:227:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:are made. In this situation, the diversity at the micro level, the interrelated-
2:33:1466:14:15:110:434:213:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:ness, and the adaptive behavior become crucial to the analysis.
2:34:1529:15:14:128:499:198:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:This paper intends to illustrate this complexity in the market, with appli-
2:35:1604:14:15:110:499:184:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:cation to movie industry, specifically the exhibition contract. To see the role
2:36:1683:15:0:110:499:169:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of the contract in the industry, we first have to look into the tension which
3:37:1761:0:15:110:499:704:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:tends to arise between distributor and exhibitor. Tension between distribu-
3:38:1836:15:14:110:499:689:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:tor and exhibitor occurs when there are increasing number of movies vying
3:39:1909:14:15:110:390:675:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:for the limited slots available in the exhibition market.
3:40:1966:15:14:128:499:660:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The conflict becomes apparent when we investigate the objectives of dis-
3:41:2038:14:15:110:499:646:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:tributor and exhibitor. Distributor wants a sufficient time to play a movie,
3:42:2114:15:14:110:499:631:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:and sincepriorrelease demand is not known, the situation that premature
3:43:2185:14:14:110:499:617:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:termination of the run before the movie can reveal its potential is main con-
3:44:2262:14:15:110:499:603:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:cern to the distributor. In this line of argument, the distributor will think
3:45:2339:15:14:110:498:588:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:that if the movie has sufficient time, the revenue stream in the subsequent
3:46:2414:14:15:110:209:574:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:runs will be higher.
3:47:2434:15:14:128:499:559:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:This objective is in conflict with the exhibitor’s, when the number of
3:48:2504:14:15:110:499:545:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:screen and other movies in the portfolio are taken into account. For exhibitor,
3:49:2583:15:14:110:499:530:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:if the movie is not generating enough revenue to cover the cost(house nut)
3:50:2657:14:15:110:499:516:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:or the other movies in the portfolio can garner larger audience, the movie
3:51:2731:15:14:110:499:501:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:should be replaced. Thus, the screen management decision usuallytakes the
3:52:2804:14:14:110:499:487:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:effects of potential of other movies, seasonality, and the revenue stream of
3:53:2880:14:15:110:230:473:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the movie into account.
3:54:2903:15:14:128:499:458:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:To mitigate the conflict, revenue sharing contract is drawn tocompensate
3:55:2975:14:15:110:499:444:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:exhibitor for giving longer run time for the movie. If the collected Box Office
3:56:3054:15:14:110:499:429:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:is high during the initial run, distributor’s portion in the revenue sharing
3:57:3130:14:15:110:498:415:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:contract is higher, or the revenue sharing distribution shouldbe in favor of
3:58:3206:15:14:110:499:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:distributor when the movie is in the initial run. This takes into account the
3:59:3283:14:15:110:499:386:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:opportunity costs that a exhibitor incurs when deciding on the run length
3:60:3356:15:14:110:499:371:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of the movie. Large portion accrued to exhibitor when the total Box Office
3:61:3430:14:14:110:499:357:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:is low, enables exhibitor to cover its cost, and at the same timediscourage
3:62:3505:14:15:110:499:343:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:replacement. Our purpose is to relate this dynamic of economic forces to the
3:63:3581:15:14:110:499:328:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Post Darwinian natural selection process and to search for optimal contract.
3:64:3657:14:15:128:499:314:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Although the reason of the market behavior, especially the evolution of
3:65:3728:15:14:110:499:299:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:exhibition contract is explained in the past literature, Chisholm (1993), De
3:66:3804:14:15:110:499:285:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Vany and Walls (1996),Mark (1998), De Vany (2002, 2004) ,Filson et al
3:67:3873:15:14:110:499:270:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:(2004), , the process, particularly how the decision is made is not explored
3:68:3949:14:15:110:499:256:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:in detail. This maybe due to the limitation of the conventional empirical
3:69:4022:15:14:110:499:241:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:method to account for the complexity and the dynamics concerned. This pa-
3:70:4095:14:14:110:499:227:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:per is one of the first attempt to model the movie industry using evolutionary
3:71:4173:14:15:110:499:213:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:approach, therefore, a number of methodological issues may arise. The pa-
3:72:4246:15:14:110:499:198:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:per is to stir discussion on the methodological aspects, especiallyrelated to
3:73:4323:14:15:110:189:184:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:movie industry.
3:74:4338:15:0:128:499:169:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The paper is divided into five sections. Section two relates theevolution-
4:75:4413:0:15:110:499:704:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:ary concept, particularly the process, selection, mutation and replication, to
4:76:4491:15:14:110:498:689:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the movie industry.  Section three illustrates the process of Genetic Algo-
4:77:4566:14:15:110:498:675:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:rithm as a tool to implement the process, and search for optimal strategy.
4:78:4640:15:40:110:418:660:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Section four analyzes the results, and section five concludes.
4:79:4702:40:26:110:480:620:17:g_d0_f10:17:g_d0_f10:2  Evolutionary concept in Movie Industry
4:80:4743:26:14:110:499:594:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Movie industry provides a fertile framework for evolutionary thinking in
4:81:4815:14:15:110:499:580:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:view of the diversity of innovations and the constant interactions and co-
4:82:4889:15:14:110:499:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:ordinations. The creation of new innovations, the demise of theestablished
4:83:4963:14:15:110:499:551:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:ones, the constant shift in importance of surviving films are everpresent ac-
4:84:5040:15:14:110:498:536:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:tivities. The meaning of evolution we want to refer to is the developmental
4:85:5115:14:15:110:499:522:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:idea of the internal unfolding activities and the post-Darwinian evolution of
4:86:5192:15:14:110:499:507:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:adaptation of populations under the process of competitive selection. In this
4:87:5269:14:14:110:499:493:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:subsection, we propose to connect the economic ideas, especiallythe constant
4:88:5345:14:15:110:499:479:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:change in the exhibition market, with the nature of evolutionary concepts.
4:89:5419:15:14:110:499:464:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The intention is to show how the evolutionary change; selection, variation,
4:90:5494:14:15:110:491:450:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:fitness and adaptation can be useful aid to the study of industry’schange.
4:91:5568:15:14:128:499:435:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The central point is that the evolution provides a non-equilibrium account
4:92:5642:14:15:110:499:421:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of why the market changes.  Evolutionary concepts explain thechanging
4:93:5711:15:14:110:499:406:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:patterns of co-existence among the innovations, the patternsdescribe the
4:94:5783:14:15:110:499:392:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:relative importance of these innovations, and how the relative importance
4:95:5856:15:14:110:499:377:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:changes over time; some are eliminated and others survive in a certain time
4:96:5931:14:14:110:499:363:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:window. As such, the wide array of innovations in movie industry, and the
4:97:6004:14:15:110:499:349:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:highly competitive environment provide a perfect framework to apply the
4:98:6075:15:14:110:232:334:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:concept in the industry.
4:99:6099:14:15:128:499:320:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The implications of the competition in evolutionary term istwo fold.
4:100:6167:15:14:110:499:305:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:It replaces the thinking of representative behavior or uniform agents, with
4:101:6242:14:15:110:499:291:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:one which has myriad of independent and different behaviors. This is the
4:102:6314:15:14:110:499:276:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:prerequisite for the evolutionary process to take place.  Thisdiversity is
4:103:6388:14:15:110:499:262:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:caused by the differentiation strategy by the industry players. The ability to
4:104:6466:15:14:110:499:247:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:adapt to new environment by the players, for example, the various capability
4:105:6542:14:14:110:499:233:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of players to respond instantaneously to the market demands alsoplays a
4:106:6613:14:15:110:499:219:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:role.  As the result, it gives birth to the population of movies which are
4:107:6687:15:14:110:499:204:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:varied in terms of their characteristics, and with selective significance which
4:108:6766:14:15:110:300:190:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:makes the evolution process possible.
4:109:6803:15:0:128:499:175:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Secondly, in the evolutionary market institution, market competition does
5:110:6877:0:15:110:499:704:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:not converge to efficiency, in the sense of resources allocation,but rather in
5:111:6955:15:14:110:499:689:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:terms of adaptation to the new development revealed throughout the run.
5:112:7026:14:15:110:499:675:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Therefore, what distinguishes the evolutionary market is itsopenness to new
5:113:7101:15:14:110:499:660:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:forms of activity and the ability to eliminate the obsolete ones when a film
5:114:7177:14:15:110:327:646:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:runs out of its marketability and shelf life.
5:115:7222:15:14:128:499:631:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:In conventional equilibrium sense, the changes may converge to a rest
5:116:7291:14:14:110:499:617:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:point, instead, in evolutionary concept, neither the changes of the types of
5:117:7367:14:15:110:499:603:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:movie nor the box office, are attracted to a static reference point. Its argu-
5:118:7445:15:14:110:499:588:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:ments provide a significant explanation concerning the relative importance
5:119:7519:14:15:110:499:574:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of the agents to the development or the evolving of the characteristics of the
5:120:7597:15:14:110:498:559:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:industry. For example; the introduction of talkies in the 1930s, the prac-
5:121:7671:14:15:110:499:545:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:tice of vertical integration of distributors and the exhibitors, blind-booking,
5:122:7750:15:14:110:499:530:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the contracting practices and the splitting of revenues between the two par-
5:123:7826:14:15:110:499:516:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:ties, explain there are two forms of change in the industry; transformational
5:124:7903:15:14:110:498:501:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:change in the nature of the individual elements in the population and varia-
5:125:7979:14:14:110:373:487:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:tional change in the composition of the population.
5:126:8030:14:15:128:499:473:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Thus, it is clear that the evolutionary theory is naturally a growth theory;
5:127:8106:15:14:110:499:458:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:it is about the relative and absolute rates of expansion and contraction, and
5:128:8183:14:15:110:499:444:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:about how films use resources effectively to optimize revenues throughout
5:129:8256:15:34:110:151:429:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the run.
5:130:8264:34:23:110:349:395:14:g_d0_f10:14:g_d0_f10:2.1   Selection in Movie Industry
5:131:8297:23:14:110:499:372:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:In this sub-section, we illustrate how the selection process takes place in the
5:132:8376:14:15:110:499:358:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:movie industry, and how we can analyze the dynamics of the industry from
5:133:8448:15:14:110:499:343:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the evolutionary perspective. We begin with an individual movie as an entity,
5:134:8525:14:14:110:499:329:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:which is the combination of genes or modules. When movie interacts and
5:135:8595:14:15:110:499:315:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:competes in the market place, the success and failure depends on the “gene”
5:136:8670:15:14:110:153:300:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:selected.
5:137:8679:14:15:128:499:286:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Gene refers to a particular characteristics or events which belong to a
5:138:8750:15:14:110:499:271:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:movie, for example, the amount spent on advertising, the share of the exhi-
5:139:8825:14:15:110:498:257:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:bition contract,the genre of the movie, the release strategy and so on which
5:140:8901:15:14:110:498:242:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:characterizes the efforts of agents to capture audience. So in each environ-
5:141:8977:14:15:110:499:228:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:ment or time of consideration, there are different genes, and each combination
5:142:9055:15:14:110:499:213:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:or schema gives different payoff. So, there is a pool of schemata from which
5:143:9131:14:14:110:499:199:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the industry players can choose. Evolutionary process is a search process to
5:144:9207:14:15:110:359:185:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:locate a fit schema from the library of schemata.
5:145:9256:15:0:128:499:170:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:We next define movie as an interactor in the market place. During the
6:146:9326:0:15:110:499:704:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:interaction and competition process, if an inefficient gene, and consequently
6:147:9403:15:14:110:499:689:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f11:an inefficient schema is selected, it renders the full potentialof aninteractor
6:148:9482:14:15:110:499:675:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:not fully utilized. For example, if a highly potential film isreleased in a non
6:149:9561:15:14:110:499:660:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:peak season, it will cause the potential of the movie not fully utilized. In
6:150:9637:14:15:110:498:646:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:this case, the release strategy is the gene, and this gene causes low payoff.
6:151:9714:15:14:110:499:631:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Or in another case, if the release is synchronized with other high potential
6:152:9790:14:14:110:499:617:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:movie, which has high cannibalization effect, the film will die prematurely.
6:153:9866:14:15:110:499:603:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Thus, again the release pattern and the characteristics of the movie are the
6:154:9942:15:14:110:499:588:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:genes, and their combination or schema causes the film to die faster. In an
6:155:10017:14:15:110:499:574:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:evolutionary dynamic implementation, it is interactor which interacts with
6:156:10091:15:14:110:499:559:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:other interactors.  And the factors which decide living and dying of the
6:157:10163:14:15:110:499:545:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:interactor are the selection of genes and combination of thesegenes or schema
6:158:10240:15:14:110:342:530:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:in the ongoing evolutionary dynamic process.
6:159:10284:14:15:128:499:516:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:In a competition model of evolution, the units of selection are the sections
6:160:10360:15:14:110:499:501:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of schema that codes for “traits” that distinguishes one interactor from an-
6:161:10436:14:14:110:499:487:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:other interactors in the competition to survive. For example, from the first
6:162:10512:14:15:110:489:473:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:case above, the unit of selection is done on the gene (the releasepattern).
6:163:10587:15:14:128:499:458:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Natural selection process will alter the gene and the schema. Through
6:164:10656:14:15:110:499:444:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:selection and replication; stronger gene and schema which can endure the
6:165:10728:15:14:110:499:429:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:competition and propel the movie will be remained and subsequently repli-
6:166:10801:14:15:110:499:415:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:cated. For example, if time is discrete, and there are many combinations of
6:167:10876:15:14:110:499:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:genes in a particular time. Each of this combination gives different payoff,
6:168:10952:14:15:110:498:386:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:and therefore, schema with higher payoff will be selected to passits traits to
6:169:11030:15:14:110:499:371:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:other schema. The process will continue until the payoff of eachschema is
6:170:11103:14:35:110:139:357:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:same.
6:171:11108:35:22:110:300:322:14:g_d0_f10:14:g_d0_f10:2.2  Propagation of Genes
6:172:11133:22:14:110:499:300:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The survival of film depends on type of genes and schema selected by the
6:173:11205:14:15:110:499:286:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:agents. Therefore, industry players have to identify for schema which suits
6:174:11280:15:14:110:499:271:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the environment in order to survive the competition.  This involves many
6:175:11352:14:15:110:499:257:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:variables or genes and also large pool of combination of these variables or
6:176:11427:15:14:110:499:242:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:schema. This requires effort to look into the many effects of thegenes from
6:177:11502:14:15:110:499:228:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:other movies on the film’s performance, and make adjustment orselection
6:178:11573:15:14:110:499:213:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:from the pool of genes to be taken to suit the environment.  Therefore,
6:179:11644:14:14:110:499:199:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:selection process is carried out to choose the most dominant or satisficing
6:180:11719:14:15:110:316:185:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:strategy even before the film is released.
6:181:11761:15:0:128:499:170:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:After the schema is decided, which usually takes into account the potential
7:182:11837:0:15:110:499:704:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:revenue against “house nut”, the cannibalization effect and marketability, the
7:183:11915:15:14:110:499:689:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:film is then run with other conpetitors. Thus, genes or schema selected are
7:184:11990:14:15:110:499:675:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:used to assess its suitability against environment revealed. For example, the
7:185:12067:15:14:110:499:660:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:gene (wide release pattern) is tested with the existing word of mouth of the
7:186:12143:14:15:110:499:646:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:movie. If the gene (wide release pattern) is proven to be able to generate
7:187:12217:15:14:110:499:631:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:large followings, the effort is then adopted by the agents, in evolutionary
7:188:12292:14:14:110:499:617:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:term, the gene is then propagated in the population. Thus, thespread of a
7:189:12365:14:15:110:499:603:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:particular type of schema throughout the society or in a macro level is due
7:190:12440:15:40:110:465:588:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:to the success of the gene to generate higher payoff than other genes.
7:191:12510:40:26:110:452:548:17:g_d0_f10:17:g_d0_f10:3  Genetic Algorithm and Sharing Rule
7:192:12547:26:15:110:499:522:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:We will perform simulation exercises to illustrate the evolutionary process
7:193:12622:15:14:110:499:507:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:mentioned above. We will focus on the sharing rule in the exhibition con-
7:194:12695:14:14:110:498:493:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:tract as an example for our case. We use Genetic Algorithm throughout the
7:195:12768:14:15:110:214:479:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:simulation exercises.
7:196:12789:15:14:128:499:464:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:This section intends to find the most profitable schema among the pop-
7:197:12859:14:15:110:499:450:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:ulation of schema using Genetic Algorithm.  The population of schema is
7:198:12930:15:14:110:499:435:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:generated to reflect the different potential revenue of each schema.  Each
7:199:13004:14:15:110:499:421:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:schema contributes to the derivation of fitness, and a pair of fitness are taken
7:200:13084:15:14:110:498:406:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:randomly from the population to perform crossover and selection. The fit-
7:201:13157:14:15:110:499:392:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:ter’s gene is then passed to the weaker, and the weaker parent isreplaced by
7:202:13233:15:14:110:158:377:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the child.
7:203:13243:14:14:128:499:363:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:We first randomly generate a population of Box Office revenue each week
7:204:13314:14:15:110:499:349:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:for a movie. In reality, distributor and exhibitor will take into account the
7:205:13391:15:14:110:499:334:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:opportunity costs,e.g. the potential revenues of other movies in the portfolio,
7:206:13470:14:15:110:499:320:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the cannibalization effect from competitors, the distribution of revenue and
7:207:13546:15:14:110:499:305:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the house nut in deciding whether to continue or stop the play. The combi-
7:208:13620:14:15:110:499:291:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:nation of all these variables are converted into binary bits to enable crossover
7:209:13700:15:14:110:180:276:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:and selection.
7:210:13714:14:15:128:499:262:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:We assume that available strategies are varying degrees of ratio in con-
7:211:13786:15:14:110:499:247:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:tract. We intend to find most profitable sharing rule given the demand of
7:212:13859:14:0:110:357:233:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the movie and the other movies in the portfolio.
8:213:13908:0:23:110:325:704:14:g_d0_f10:14:g_d0_f10:3.1  Generation of population
8:214:13937:23:14:110:499:681:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:We generate a random population of revenue for a movie and potential rev-
8:215:14010:14:14:110:499:667:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:enue for other movies each week. The combination of these two categories
8:216:14082:14:15:110:499:653:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:reside 60 bits in a binary string; the first 30 bits reflects the film’s demand
8:217:14161:15:14:110:499:638:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:and the second 30 bits belong to the potential revenue or the cost of not
8:218:14234:14:15:110:239:624:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:showing the other movie.
8:219:14258:15:14:128:499:609:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:There are total of 70 bits in a binary string, which contributes to a schema;
8:220:14335:14:15:110:499:595:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:a combination of demand, potential demand and a exhibition contract. The
8:221:14407:15:14:110:465:580:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:feature of the contract resides in the last 10 bits of the binarystring.
8:222:14479:14:15:128:499:566:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:We generate 50 binary strings in each population in every weekof a
8:223:14545:15:14:110:499:551:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:film’s run, or 50 different combinations of the movie’s demandand potential
8:224:14620:14:14:110:499:537:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:demand. Similarly, the feature of the contract is varied among the population
8:225:14697:14:35:110:272:523:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:given the demand of the movie.
8:226:14727:35:22:110:260:488:14:g_d0_f10:14:g_d0_f10:3.2  Fitness function
8:227:14748:22:15:110:499:466:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A binary string’s fitness is calculated based on the nett demand collected
8:228:14822:15:14:110:499:451:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:during the run, after deducting the opportunity cost; the potential demand
8:229:14896:14:29:110:457:437:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:by other films in the portfolio. Specifically, the fitness is written as:
8:230:14969:29:0:227:301:408:12:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f13:fitness = (BOi
8:231:14983:0:16:312:319:416:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:x
8:232:14984:16:0:302:329:400:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:x+y
8:233:14987:0:26:331:382:408:12:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f13:)−BOI−i
8:234:14994:26:15:128:499:382:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:where BO = Box Office of movie i and I is the total number of moviesin
8:235:15064:15:14:110:499:367:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the portfolio (which is the opportunity cost for the exhibitor). The distribu-
8:236:15142:14:15:110:499:353:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:tor’s contract consists of two parts; the portion accrued to exhibitor (x) and
8:237:15220:15:34:110:201:338:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:(y) to distributor.
8:238:15239:34:22:110:307:304:14:g_d0_f10:14:g_d0_f10:3.3  Genetic search process
8:239:15266:22:15:110:499:282:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Crossover allows binary string to exchange information with each other and
8:240:15340:15:14:110:499:267:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:produce new “children” in the population. In our population, selection is
8:241:15413:14:15:110:499:253:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:performed on two strings; fitter string will pass its informationto a weaker
8:242:15489:15:14:110:499:238:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:string in order to improve the new generation. However, in order to search
8:243:15563:14:15:110:499:224:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:for better or to vary the choices of the individuals, we allow the new child
8:244:15639:15:14:110:498:209:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:produced to replace the one of the parents.  The overall improvement is
8:245:15710:14:15:110:499:195:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:made possible by this exchange of information from the strongerindividual
8:246:15783:15:0:110:217:180:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:to weaker individual.
9:247:15805:0:15:128:498:704:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The process; crossover and mutation, are performed on the last 10 bits
9:248:15875:15:14:110:499:689:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of a string; which contains the information about the exhibition contract.
9:249:15949:14:15:110:499:675:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Mutation is performed 0.002 of the time, and crossover is performed when
9:250:16021:15:14:110:499:660:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:traits from fitter individual replaced the traits in the weaker individual. The
9:251:16100:14:15:110:498:646:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:number of bits is taken randomly from the string of the parent,and pass on
9:252:16174:15:14:110:499:631:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:to the child. The child will then replace the weaker parent. Fitness is then
9:253:16250:14:14:110:499:617:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:calculated after the crossover and mutation for each string in the population.
9:254:16328:14:15:110:396:603:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The process of the search is performed in Mathematica.
9:255:16382:15:14:128:499:588:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:During the search process, the portion x and y in the contract arechanged
9:256:16455:14:15:110:499:574:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:to suit the bearable risk level and the objectives of distributor and exhibitor.
9:257:16535:15:14:110:499:559:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:If the initial Box Office is high, then the portion x (i.e. exhibitor’s share)
9:258:16613:14:15:110:499:545:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:should be low, and portion y (i.e. distributor’s share) should behigh. This
9:259:16688:15:14:110:499:530:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:is because the costs borne by distributor (i.e.  the distributionrental and
9:260:16763:14:15:110:499:516:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:advertisement costs) are higher than what is incurred by exhibitor. And the
9:261:16838:15:14:110:499:501:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:fitness function should be in positive region in order to avoid termination by
9:262:16916:14:14:110:159:487:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:exhibitor.
9:263:16926:14:15:128:499:473:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:After several weeks of the run and when the movie starts to decay,the
9:264:16995:15:14:110:499:458:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:portion x should be increased. At this stage, the exhibitor bears a higher
9:265:17069:14:15:110:499:444:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:risk level than in the initial stage of the film’s run; the opportunity cost of
9:266:17148:15:14:110:499:429:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:showing the film increases. Thus, in order to prolong run time, theportion
9:267:17222:14:15:110:335:415:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:x is increased, and the portion y is reduced.
9:268:17267:15:14:128:499:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:We will first illustrate the selection process by using the fitness function.
9:269:17344:14:15:110:499:386:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The process searches for the highest payoff among the population. The fitter
9:270:17420:15:14:110:499:371:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:individual will pass its traits to the weaker individuals, andis allowed to
9:271:17495:14:14:110:499:357:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:improve on its fitness. The increment takes generations of search process to
9:272:17571:14:15:110:247:343:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:improve the overall fitness.
9:273:17599:15:14:128:499:328:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:To illustrate the industry’s practice, the change of the contract is limited
9:274:17675:14:15:110:499:314:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:to 90/10 (Best Week Clause), 30% for first week and second week, 40%
9:275:17743:15:14:110:499:299:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:for third week, 50% for fifth week and 60% thereafter.  If the Box Office
9:276:17816:14:15:110:499:285:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:exceeded 10 million, GA will stop its search process at 10% (portion x), and
9:277:17892:15:14:110:499:270:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:will calculate the fitness. If it is lesser than 10 million, the “x”portion is
9:278:17970:14:0:110:350:256:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:limited to 30%, and calculate the fitness value.
10:279:18019:0:30:110:329:704:17:g_d0_f10:17:g_d0_f10:4  Results and discussion
10:280:18044:30:22:110:340:674:14:g_d0_f10:14:g_d0_f10:4.1  Contract to encourage play
10:281:18075:22:15:110:499:652:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:In this section, we will first illustrate the improvement of the fitness function,
10:282:18157:15:14:110:486:637:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:and after that, we will show the changing contract to two typesof movie.
10:283:18229:14:15:128:499:623:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Figure 1 through figure 8 exhibit the change of fitness through crossover
10:284:18302:15:14:110:499:608:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:and replacement of gene among the populations for generation 10 to gener-
10:285:18375:14:14:110:499:594:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:ation 200. The method reveals which contract, given the opportunity costs
10:286:18448:14:15:110:499:580:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:and the gross revenue collected, ensure positive fitness or real revenue to
10:287:18523:15:14:110:499:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the exhibitor and therefore, how large the portion of the revenue should be
10:288:18598:14:15:110:499:551:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:collected by distributor.  In the first week of the run, as shown infigure
10:289:18672:15:14:110:499:536:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:1, gene of individual contract in the population is selected and replaced by
10:290:18748:14:15:110:499:522:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the new individual produced from the crossover and mutation. Since one of
10:291:18821:15:14:110:499:507:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the parents quality gene is passed over to the child, better newgeneration
10:292:18895:14:15:110:499:493:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:is produced progressively throughout the generations. In the figures, some
10:293:18969:15:14:110:499:478:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:individuals in the population are able to progress to higher fitness, and those
10:294:19048:14:15:110:499:464:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:not able are facing high opportunity costs, which renders the fitness to be
10:295:19123:15:14:110:499:449:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:stagnant. As in figure 3, the fitness in the population is not improved as in
10:296:19200:14:14:110:498:435:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:other figures, because the opportunity cost for each situation ishigh, and
10:297:19274:14:15:110:414:421:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:therefore, fitness cannot be improved after 200 generations.
10:298:19334:15:14:128:499:406:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The exhibition contract allows distributor to optimize the revenue and
10:299:19404:14:15:110:499:392:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:at the same time avoid premature termination.  This is achieved through
10:300:19475:15:14:110:499:377:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:searching for positive fitness given the opportunity costs for each film. Figure
10:301:19555:14:15:110:499:363:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:9 exhibits the changing contract and fitness each week of the run. The film
10:302:19630:15:14:110:499:348:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:attracts high revenue from week 1 to week 7, within which the opportunity
10:303:19703:14:15:110:499:334:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:cost or the cost of not showing the other film is lower than the revenue
10:304:19775:15:14:110:499:319:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:collected for the film. This allows distributor to fix a contract between 10%
10:305:19852:14:14:110:499:305:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:to 20% and ensure positive fitness or nett revenue collected for the exhibitor.
10:306:19931:14:15:110:499:291:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Positive fitness allows the film to run for longer period and the ratio avoids
10:307:20009:15:14:110:499:276:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:exhibitor from enjoying too high the potential of the film.  However, the
10:308:20082:14:15:110:499:262:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:declining revenue after week 7th increases the contract to 90%, which belong
10:309:20158:15:14:110:499:247:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:to the exhibitor. The change allows exhibitor to extract higher revenue from
10:310:20234:14:15:110:351:233:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the gross, and induce him to continue the play.
10:311:20281:15:14:128:499:218:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Figure 10 illustrates a changing contract when the film exhibits a strong
10:312:20354:14:15:110:499:204:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:leg. Opportunity cost is high in the first week of the run. To avoid termi-
10:313:20429:15:14:110:498:189:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:nation, distributor will have to allow exhibitor to enjoy 30%of the collected
10:314:20506:14:0:110:499:175:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:revenue. This continues to the third week of the run. In week four, the BO
11:315:20581:0:15:110:499:704:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:exceeds 10 million, which triggers the Best Week Clause. To avoid too much
11:316:20655:15:14:110:499:689:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:potential paid to exhibitor, the contract is changed to 90/10 after house nut.
11:317:20733:14:15:110:499:675:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:After which, the normal rule applies until week seventh. In this week, the
11:318:20807:15:34:110:398:660:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:fitness dives to negative region, and the film is replaced.
11:319:20866:34:22:110:309:626:14:g_d0_f10:14:g_d0_f10:4.2  Contract to share risks
11:320:20894:22:15:110:499:604:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The variability of demand is the main concern of the risk sharing contract.
11:321:20969:15:14:110:499:589:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:In the paper by Hanssen (2002) and Filson et al (2004) argue that the unpre-
11:322:21045:14:15:110:499:575:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:dictability of demandex anterules out the theory of asymmetric informa-
11:323:21116:15:14:110:499:560:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:tion. Furthermore, the arrival of talkies or sound in 1930s renders the change
11:324:21194:14:15:110:499:546:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of production structure in the studio; before sound, movies areidentifiable
11:325:21269:15:14:110:498:531:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:through roster of stars employed on the studio’s payroll and thedemand is
11:326:21342:14:15:110:499:517:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:predictable. Its introduction increases the production costs and concerns of
11:327:21418:15:14:110:225:502:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:studio’s downside risk.
11:328:21441:14:15:128:499:488:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:This high unpredictability also worries the exhibitor if he rented the film
11:329:21516:15:14:110:499:473:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:for a flat fees. If the film is rented out a flat fee to the exhibitor, the downside
11:330:21600:14:14:110:499:459:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:risk is transferred from studio to exhibitor. In the event of high budget flop,
11:331:21679:14:15:110:498:445:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:it will wipe out the entire stream of revenue which the exhibitor collected.
11:332:21755:15:14:110:499:430:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Thus, risk sharing contract requires distributor and studio to share portion
11:333:21831:14:15:110:262:416:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of the risk with the exhibitor.
11:334:21862:15:14:128:499:401:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Before sound, input from exhibitors contributed to the successof a film,
11:335:21934:14:15:110:498:387:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:through the life music accompanied during the play. In the era, exhibitors
11:336:22008:15:14:110:499:372:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:became the large residual claimant of the revenue collected,and film was
11:337:22080:14:15:110:499:358:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:rented out with a flat fee. Flat rental fee prevented shirking from exhibitor.
11:338:22158:15:14:110:499:343:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:However, with the advent of sound, risk sharing contract became the norm.
11:339:22231:14:14:110:499:329:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The attraction of a film is no longer depends on the life sound staged by the
11:340:22308:14:15:110:498:315:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:exhibitors; people go to see movie because of the film itself. Thisreduces the
11:341:22386:15:14:110:499:300:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:benefit for shirking. In the sound era, allowing exhibitor to share the revenue
11:342:22465:14:15:110:499:286:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:encourages him to continue the play, and compare with flat fee, it discourages
11:343:22543:15:14:110:499:271:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:pre mature termination. Thus, sharing contract eliminates benefits for the
11:344:22617:14:15:110:499:257:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:exhibitor to shirk, and compensates him through taking the riskof prolonging
11:345:22693:15:14:110:195:242:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the life of a film.
11:346:22712:14:15:128:499:228:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The risk sharing element of an exhibition contract is illustrated in our
11:347:22784:15:14:110:499:213:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:simulation exercise in figure 9. When the movie is first released, the high
11:348:22859:14:14:110:499:199:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:demand it garnered in the first three weeks of the run compensates the high
11:349:22934:14:15:110:499:185:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:risk averse party, in this case is distributor. During this interval, “Best Week
11:350:23014:15:0:110:499:170:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Clause” and “Holdover Clause” are triggered to compensate the high risk
12:351:23087:0:15:110:498:704:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:party.  Lower risk averse party, the exhibitor, is compensated with lower
12:352:23160:15:14:110:499:689:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:portion of the total revenue collected, which are in the 20% region. Based
12:353:23234:14:15:110:499:675:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:on the fitness or net revenue accrued to the exhibitor, it shouldbe able to
12:354:23309:15:14:110:499:660:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:cover the opportunity cost or the reservation utility which are derived from
12:355:23385:14:15:110:383:646:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the cost of not showing other movies in the portfolio.
12:356:23439:15:14:128:498:631:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:However, the opportunity cost of the exhibitor rises in the subsequent
12:357:23509:14:14:110:499:617:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:runs of the film. This requires higher compensation to justify for the longer
12:358:23586:14:15:110:498:603:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:run life. After 7th week of the run, the opportunity cost of not showing other
12:359:23664:15:14:110:499:588:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:movies increases, i.e. the risk borne by exhibitor increases, andtherefore, it
12:360:23742:14:15:110:498:574:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:deserves a higher reward to showing the film. Similarly, to encourage run
12:361:23815:15:14:110:499:559:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:length, exhibitor should be rewarded with accordance with the risk they
12:362:23886:14:15:110:499:545:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:bear. In figure 10, high opportunity cost in the first week of the run requires
12:363:23965:15:14:110:499:530:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:distributor to allow exhibitor to enjoy larger portion of therevenue. The
12:364:24038:14:15:110:499:516:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:risk drops after the film is revealed to be able to garner large followings,
12:365:24114:15:14:110:498:501:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:and therefore, the payment accrued to the exhibitor diminishes. The risk
12:366:24186:14:14:110:499:487:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:gradually increases after the 6th week of the run, and based on the risk
12:367:24258:14:15:110:442:473:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:sharing rule, it would given larger share of the revenue collected.
12:368:24325:15:14:128:499:458:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Thus, the revision of the dynamic exhibition contract is based on the
12:369:24394:14:15:110:499:444:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:apportionment of the risk between the parties. With assumption that the
12:370:24465:15:14:110:499:429:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:opportunity cost is not constant, due to the new introduction of new prod-
12:371:24539:14:40:110:409:415:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:ucts, our simulation result shows the concave sharing rule.
12:372:24598:40:26:110:232:375:17:g_d0_f10:17:g_d0_f10:5  Conclusion
12:373:24611:26:15:110:499:349:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The paper suggests an evolutionary approach to the study of movie indus-
12:374:24683:15:14:110:498:334:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:try. This application to model the complexity leads us to relook into the
12:375:24756:14:15:110:499:320:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the economic behavior which are usually analyzed follow the reductionist
12:376:24828:15:14:110:499:305:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:approach.  We argue in the paper that the complexities; interdependency
12:377:24899:14:15:110:499:291:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of heterogenous market agents, constant interactions and learning, present
12:378:24973:15:14:110:499:276:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:a constantly reinforcing effect, which renders the decision making dynamic
12:379:25047:14:15:110:499:262:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:and non-converging. This environment, requires one to employ a different
12:380:25119:15:14:110:499:247:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:methodology to analyze the decision making process. The paper is the first
12:381:25193:14:14:110:499:233:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:to relate dynamics in movie industry to the nature, and it would create much
12:382:25269:14:15:110:499:219:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:methodological concerns. Its purpose is to stir discussion on the evolutionary
12:383:25347:15:0:110:456:204:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:concept, particularly its application to the study of movie industry.

21:401:26313:12:12:110:499:310:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:function is written as (BOixx+y)−BOI−i, wherex= 0.1 ifBOi>10m, and ifBOi<10m,

21:404:26564:12:12:110:499:274:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:and the less than optimal contract is replaced. For example, during the first two weeks of
