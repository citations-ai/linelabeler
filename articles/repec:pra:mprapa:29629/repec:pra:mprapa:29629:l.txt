2:18:536:27:15:128:476:455:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:F:We propose a áexible prices model where endogenous market structures
2:19:604:15:14:110:476:440:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:F:and search and matching frictions in the labor market interact endogenously.
2:20:680:14:15:110:476:426:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:F:The interplay between Örms endogenous entry, strategic interactions among
2:21:753:15:14:110:476:411:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:F:producers and labor market frictions represents a strong ampliÖcation channel
2:22:830:14:14:110:476:397:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:F:of technology shocks on labor market variables, and helps addressing the
2:23:902:14:15:110:476:383:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:F:unemployment-volatility puzzle. Consistently with U.S. evidence, new Örms
2:24:975:15:14:110:476:368:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:F:create a large fraction of new jobs and grow faster than more mature Örms,
2:25:1049:14:15:110:448:354:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:F:net Örmsíentry is procyclical and the price mark up is countercyclical.

3:39:2002:0:22:110:222:654:14:g_d0_f9:14:g_d0_f10:C:1Introduction
3:40:2015:22:15:110:476:632:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:We present a framework where search and matching frictions in the
3:41:2080:15:14:110:476:617:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:labor market interact with the dynamics of the number of Örms and
3:42:2145:14:15:110:476:603:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:their strategic behavior. Market structures are said to be endogenous
3:43:2214:15:14:110:476:588:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:since the number of producers and the price mark ups are determined
3:44:2281:14:15:110:304:574:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:both in the short and in the long run.
3:45:2319:15:14:128:476:559:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Three stylized facts motivate this paper: the large fraction of job
3:46:2386:14:15:110:476:545:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:creation (destruction) in the U.S. economy due to the birth (death) of
3:47:2456:15:14:110:476:530:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Örms, the procyclical variations in the number of market competitors
3:48:2524:14:14:110:472:516:12:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:B:and in aggregate proÖts, and the countercyclicality of price mark ups.2
3:49:2595:14:15:128:476:502:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:We consider an economy with distinct sectors, each one characterized
3:50:2663:15:14:110:476:487:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:by many Örms supplying goods that can be imperfectly substitutable to a
3:51:2734:14:15:110:476:473:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:di§erent degree. As in Colciago and Etro (2010 a and b), we take strate-
3:52:2806:15:14:110:476:458:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:gic interactions into account and allow Örms within a sector to compete
3:53:2877:14:15:110:476:444:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:either in prices (Bertrand competition) or in quantities (Cournot com-
3:54:2947:15:14:110:476:429:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:petition). Following Ghironi and Melitz (2005) and Bilbiie, Ghironi and
3:55:3018:14:15:110:476:415:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Melitz (2007) (BGM 2007 henceforth), entry is subject to sunk entry
3:56:3085:15:14:110:476:400:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:costs and a time-to-build lag. The free entry condition equates the ex-
3:57:3156:14:14:110:476:386:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:pected present discounted value of proÖts to the sunk cost to endogenize
3:58:3228:14:15:110:476:372:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the number of Örms in each sector. As a result the degree of market
3:59:3295:15:14:110:476:357:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:power, measured as the mark up that Örms can impose over marginal
3:60:3360:14:15:110:476:343:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:costs, depends endogenously on the form of competition, on the degree of
3:61:3432:15:14:110:476:328:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:substitutability between goods and on the number of Örms in the sector.
3:62:3503:14:15:110:476:314:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Firms are large, since they employ multiple-workers and the labor mar-
3:63:3573:15:14:110:476:299:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ket is characterized by Mortensen and Pissarides (1999)-style search and
3:64:3645:14:15:110:476:285:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:matching frictions. Workers may separate from a job for two reasons:
3:65:3713:15:14:110:476:270:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:either because the Örm where the job is located exits from the market
3:66:3782:14:14:110:476:256:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:or because the match is destroyed. As a consequence, we can identify
3:67:3850:14:15:110:476:242:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the contribution to job creation coming from the birth of Örms and the
3:68:3920:15:14:110:476:227:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:contribution to job destruction due to the exit of Örms from the mar-
3:69:3989:14:15:110:476:213:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ket. Further, and di§erently from the standard labor search model, the
3:70:4059:15:14:110:476:198:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:endogeneity of the number of producers, together with the large Örms
3:71:4127:14:15:110:476:184:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:assumption, allows to realistically distinguish between the dynamics of
3:72:4198:15:14:110:367:169:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the number of producers and that of employment.
3:73:4245:14:15:128:476:155:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:This set up delivers two sets of results. First, in line with the facts
3:74:4316:15:14:110:476:140:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:discussed above, new entrants give a sizeable contribution to job cre-
3:75:4386:14:14:110:476:126:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ation and grow faster than more mature producers.  Further, proÖts
3:76:4452:14:15:110:476:112:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:are procyclical and price mark ups are countercyclical. Second, without
3:77:4523:15:18:110:476:97:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:resorting to rigidities in wages (real or nominal) or prices, and under
3:78:4594:18:16:124:476:79:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:2As in Jaimovich and Floetotto (2008) we use the terms new Örm and new com-
3:79:4669:16:0:110:469:63:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:petitors in a broad sense. They refer to both start ups and to new establishments.
4:80:4752:0:15:110:476:654:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:a conservative and standard calibration of parameters, our framework
4:81:4820:15:14:110:476:639:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:substantially outperforms the basic search and matching model at repli-
4:82:4891:14:15:110:476:625:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:cating the observed variability of the unemployment rate, vacancies and
4:83:4962:15:14:110:198:610:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:market tightness.
4:84:4979:14:14:128:476:596:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Both outcomes are the result of a novel propagation mechanism of
4:85:5043:14:15:110:476:582:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:technology shocks.3A rise in technology initially increases proÖts, which
4:86:5116:15:14:110:476:567:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:leads to entry of new Örms. Since Örmsícreation requires output, in-
4:87:5184:14:15:110:476:553:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:cumbent Örms increase their labor demand both at the intensive and at
4:88:5253:15:14:110:476:538:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the extensive margin. The need to hire workers boosts vacancy posting
4:89:5322:14:15:110:476:524:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:on impact. As new entrants start producing, vacancy posting and job
4:90:5389:15:14:110:476:509:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:creation are further ampliÖed with respect to a model with exogenous
4:91:5457:14:15:110:476:495:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:market structures. Also, as the goodsímarket becomes more crowded,
4:92:5523:15:14:110:476:480:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the relative price of existing varieties rises. At the same time, stronger
4:93:5597:14:14:110:476:466:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:competition leads to a lower mark up and thus to a higher demand by
4:94:5664:14:15:110:476:452:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:consumers. Both e§ects provide Örms with an incentive to create vacan-
4:95:5734:15:14:110:476:437:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:cies which is absent in a model with exogenous market structures. The
4:96:5803:14:15:110:476:423:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:responses of the job Önding rate and the vacancy Ölling rate are similarly
4:97:5877:15:14:110:160:408:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ampliÖed.
4:98:5886:14:15:128:476:394:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:This dynamics translates into a response of the unemployment rate
4:99:5951:15:14:110:476:379:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in the period after the shock which is almost three times larger, and
4:100:6020:14:15:110:476:365:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:more persistent, than that observed in a search model with exogenous
4:101:6088:15:14:110:476:350:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:market structures but identical calibration. Importantly, our framework
4:102:6159:14:15:110:476:336:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:generates countercyclical mark ups together with procyclical proÖts and
4:103:6230:15:14:110:476:321:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:matches the time pattern of the correlation between output and the
4:104:6296:14:14:110:476:307:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:mark up identiÖed in the literature (see e.g. BGM (2007) and Colciago
4:105:6365:14:15:110:476:293:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and Etro (2010)). Turning to second moments, we Önd that endogenous
4:106:6432:15:14:110:476:278:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:market structures magnify the volatility of unemployment, hours, va-
4:107:6500:14:15:110:476:264:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:cancies and the job market tightness in response to a technology shock.
4:108:6571:15:14:110:476:249:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:For this reason, we argue that a model where the market structure is
4:109:6639:14:15:110:438:235:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:endogenous helps alleviating the so called Shimer (2005) puzzle.
4:110:6703:15:14:128:476:220:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:In the long run, stronger competition in the goods market leads to
4:111:6769:14:15:110:476:206:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:lower unemployment and to higher real wages. The endogenous steady
4:112:6835:15:14:110:476:191:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:state share of gross job creation due to new Örms is 25 percent and the
4:113:6906:14:14:110:476:177:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:share of overall employment due to startups equals 2.5 percent. These
4:114:6975:14:15:110:476:163:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Ögures are in line with U.S. averages. Haltiwanger et al. (2009) con-
4:115:7044:15:14:110:476:148:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:sider U.S. annual data between 1992 and 2005. They Önd that business
4:116:7112:14:15:110:476:134:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:startups account for roughly 3 percent of U.S. total employment in any

4:118:7258:14:18:110:476:105:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:relative to net job creation which averages around 2.2 percent of total
4:119:7329:18:16:124:476:87:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:3With minor di§erences in the explanation, the propagation mechanism we de-
4:120:7404:16:0:110:310:71:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:scribe applies to any output-expanding shock.
5:121:7450:0:15:110:477:654:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:employment per year.4Also, Davis and Haltiwanger (1990) on the ba-
5:122:7516:15:14:110:476:639:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:sis of U.S. manufacturing data between 1972 and 1986 estimate that 25
5:123:7585:14:15:110:476:625:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:percent of annual gross job creation is due to new establishments births.
5:124:7658:15:14:110:476:610:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Similarly, Jaimovich and Floetotto (2008) focus on employment data at
5:125:7727:14:14:110:476:596:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the establishment level. They estimate that the average fraction of quar-
5:126:7800:14:15:110:476:582:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:terly job-gain (losses) that can be explained by the opening (closing) of
5:127:7873:15:14:110:290:567:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:establishments is about 20 percent.
5:128:7908:14:15:128:476:553:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Finally, we show that the interaction between endogenous market
5:129:7971:15:14:110:476:538:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:structures and search and matching frictions generates time varying
5:130:8038:14:15:110:476:524:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:wedges between the competitive equilibrium allocation and the socially
5:131:8108:15:14:110:476:509:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:e¢ cient one. The time-varying nature of price mark up distorts both
5:132:8176:14:15:110:476:495:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the allocation of the intensive and the extensive margin of labor. More-
5:133:8248:15:14:110:476:480:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:over, since new entrants need to build up a workforce at the beginning
5:134:8318:14:14:110:476:466:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of their activity, they su§er lower proÖts and are characterized by a
5:135:8387:14:15:110:476:452:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:lower value with respect to incumbent producers. We show that this
5:136:8453:15:14:110:476:437:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:asymmetry distorts the allocation of consumption across di§erent dates.
5:137:8524:14:15:110:476:423:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Importantly, the Hosios (1990) condition is necessary but not su¢ cient
5:138:8595:15:14:110:476:408:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:to achieve e¢ ciency in the allocation of the extensive margin of labor.
5:139:8667:14:15:110:476:394:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:In particular, the competitive equilibrium allocation is characterized by
5:140:8740:15:14:110:476:379:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:under-employment under both Cournot and Bertrand competition even
5:141:8805:14:15:110:305:365:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:when the Hosios condition is satisÖed.
5:142:8843:15:14:128:476:350:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:There is convincing macroeconomic evidence in support of the busi-
5:143:8909:14:15:110:476:336:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ness cycle implications of our approach. Jaimovich and Floetotto (2008)
5:144:8980:15:14:110:476:321:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:document that around a third of the cyclical volatility of the job-gains
5:145:9052:14:14:110:476:307:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:(losses) comes from opening (closing) of establishments, which suggests
5:146:9123:14:15:110:476:293:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:that the dynamics of the number of market competitors is a relevant

5:148:9261:14:15:110:476:264:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:thus of unemployment. The strongly procyclical response of the job Önd-
5:149:9332:15:14:110:476:249:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ing probability delivered by our model is consistent with the evidence in
5:150:9405:14:15:110:476:235:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Hall (2005) who, using post-war data, Önds that periods of boom, when
5:151:9474:15:14:110:476:220:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the unemployment rate decreases, are associated to a high probability of

5:156:9833:15:14:110:476:148:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:(1995) reports a similar pattern for France. Bils (1987), Rotemberg and

5:160:10119:16:12:110:476:85:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:Örms account for more than 100% percent of all net new jobs. Other, mature, Örms
5:161:10199:12:8:110:476:73:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:are creating jobs. However the net growth from new Örms alone exceeds the average.
5:162:10281:8:0:124:411:65:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:5Hall (2005) also reports a relatively acyclical job separation rate.

6:168:10637:14:15:128:476:582:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Our work bridges two apparently uncorrelated recent lines of re-

6:173:10969:15:14:110:476:509:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:(2008) have emphasized the importance of the extensive margin in the
6:174:11037:14:15:110:476:495:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:process of product creation or innovation. For this reason BGM (2007)

6:187:11939:14:14:110:476:307:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:for our analysis is constituted by those contributions trying to solve the
6:188:12013:14:15:110:476:293:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:unemployment-volatility puzzle presented by Shimer (2005) and Hall
6:189:12079:15:14:110:476:278:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:(2005) mainly by modifying the basic Mortensen-Pissarides model. To
6:190:12146:14:15:110:476:264:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:this group belongs the work by Hall (2005), who argues that the lack of
6:191:12217:15:14:110:476:249:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ampliÖcation characterizing the basic Mortensen-Pissarides model lies
6:192:12286:14:15:110:476:235:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in the wage Nash bargaining assumption. He suggests that real wage
6:193:12352:15:14:110:476:220:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:rigidity could help solving the puzzle.  In a similar vein Gertler and

6:199:12766:14:15:110:476:134:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:show that the model features a stronger propagation mechanism once

6:201:12883:14:15:128:476:105:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:This paper argues that oligopolistic competition between an endoge-
6:202:12950:15:14:110:476:90:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:nous number of producers is a relevant dimension to consider in order to

7:206:13232:15:14:110:476:639:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:model we propose is the Örst one to address in a uniÖed framework the
7:207:13301:14:15:110:433:625:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:three stylized facts listed at the beginning of this Introduction.
7:208:13367:15:14:128:476:610:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:The papers closest related to ours are Blanchard and Giavazzi (2003),
7:209:13436:14:14:110:476:596:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and more recently Hebel and Haefke (2009), Shao and Silos (2008) and
7:210:13504:14:15:110:476:582:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Kaas and Kircher (2011). With respect to Blanchard and Giavazzi (2003)
7:211:13574:15:14:110:476:567:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:we provide a fully speciÖed DSGE model where the dynamics of the
7:212:13638:14:15:110:476:553:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:number of Örms is explicitly modeled. Hebel and Haefke (2009) consider
7:213:13708:15:14:110:476:538:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:a labor search model with Örmsíentry. In their model entry and exit
7:214:13775:14:15:110:476:524:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of Örms are exogenous and the number of producers is determined en-

7:216:13911:14:15:110:476:495:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:analysis focuses on the long run e§ects of deregulation in the goods mar-

7:218:14052:14:14:110:476:466:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:(2008) introduce Örmsíentry in a Mortensen-Pissarides-style model with
7:219:14122:14:15:110:476:452:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:monopolistic competition in the goods market characterized by small
7:220:14189:15:14:110:476:437:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Örms. They identify the countercyclical value of vacancies as the main

7:223:14397:14:15:110:476:394:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Also, the small Örms assumption does not allow to address the empirical
7:224:14468:15:14:110:476:379:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:evidence on job creation by new entrants. Our analysis di§ers from that
7:225:14539:14:15:110:476:365:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in Kaas and Kircher (2011) with respect to both assumptions and focus.

7:230:14884:14:15:110:476:293:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:where large, risk-neutral Örms can commit to long-term wage contracts.
7:231:14954:15:14:110:476:278:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:With respect to the focus, we analyze endogenous market structures
7:232:15020:14:15:110:476:264:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:both in the long and the short run, and we emphasize their role under

7:235:15227:15:14:110:476:220:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:instead on the e¢ ciency of the competitive equilibrium in the presence
7:236:15298:14:15:110:476:206:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of multiple-workers Örms that can commit to long-term wage contracts.

7:239:15509:14:15:110:476:163:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:is also consistent with several empirical regularities about Örm size, job

8:250:16101:20:15:110:476:582:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:There are two main building blocks in the model: oligopolistic competi-

8:252:16242:14:15:110:476:553:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:frictions in the labor market. In this paragraph we outlay their main
8:253:16311:15:14:110:153:538:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:features.
8:254:16320:14:14:128:476:524:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:As in Colciago and Etro (2010 a and b), the economy features a
8:255:16382:14:15:110:476:510:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:continuum of sectors, or industries, on the unit interval.  Sectors are
8:256:16453:15:14:110:476:495:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:indexed withk2(0;1):Each sectorkis characterized by di§erent Örms

8:259:16654:14:15:110:476:452:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:end of the period a fraction-2(0;1)of market participants exits from
8:260:16722:15:14:110:476:437:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the market for exogenous reasons.6Below we describe the entry process
8:261:16791:14:15:110:418:423:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and the mode of competition within in each sector in detail.
8:262:16851:15:14:128:476:408:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:The labor market is characterized by search and matching frictions,
8:263:16918:14:14:110:476:394:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:as in Andolfatto (1996) and Mertz (1995).  A fractionutof the unit
8:264:16984:14:15:110:476:380:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:mass population is unemployed at time t and searches for a job. Firms
8:265:17053:15:14:110:476:365:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:producing at timetneed to post vacancies in order to hire new workers.
8:266:17123:14:15:110:476:351:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Unemployed workers and vacancies combine according to a CRS match-

8:268:17257:14:15:110:477:322:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:matching function reads asmt=\rm(vtott)1-\ru\rt, where\rmreáects the

8:271:17463:15:15:110:476:278:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:a Örm Ölls a vacancy is given byqt=mtvtott, while the probability to Önd
8:272:17535:15:15:110:477:263:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:a job for an unemployed worker reads aszt=mtut. Firms and individu-
8:273:17602:15:14:110:476:248:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:als take both probabilities as given. Matches become productive in the
8:274:17672:14:15:110:476:234:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:same period in which they are formed. Each Örm separates exogenously
8:275:17740:15:14:110:476:219:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:from a fraction1-%of existing workers each period, where%is the
8:276:17803:14:15:110:443:205:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:probability that a worker stays with a Örm until the next period.
8:277:17868:15:14:128:476:190:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:As a result a worker may separate from a job for two reasons: ei-
8:278:17933:14:14:110:476:176:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ther because the Örm where the job is located exits from the market or
8:279:18003:14:15:110:476:162:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:because the match is destroyed. Since these sources of separation are
8:280:18072:15:26:110:460:147:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:independent, the evolution of aggregate employment,Lt, is given by

9:288:18411:21:14:110:476:609:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Using the family construct of Mertz (1995) we can refer to a represen-

9:322:19291:15:14:110:476:322:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:to many macroeconomic models with imperfect competition, our focus
9:323:19357:14:15:110:476:308:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:will be on the market structure of disaggregated sectors: intrasectoral
9:324:19428:15:14:110:476:293:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:substitutability (between goods produced by Örms of a same sector) is
9:325:19497:14:15:110:476:279:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:high, while intersectoral substitutability is low.8The family receives

9:327:19633:14:15:110:476:250:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ther, we assume that unemployed individuals receive an unemployment

9:329:19768:14:15:110:476:221:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:equal tob(1-Lt). This is Önanced through lump sum taxation by the
9:330:19833:15:17:110:476:206:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:government. Notice that the household recognizes that employment is
9:331:19900:17:16:124:476:189:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:7Given that population is normalized to one, the number of unemployed workers
9:332:19977:16:20:110:290:173:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:and the unemployment rate are identical.

17:726:35440:15:14:110:476:172:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:set to the standard value of 0.99 for quarterly data, while the rate of

17:730:35725:15:14:110:476:114:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:equals one. The Frish elasticity of labor supply reduces to', to which
17:731:35795:14:14:110:476:100:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f13:B:we assign a value of one as in Monacelli et al. (2010). We choose"= 6
17:732:35864:14:15:110:476:86:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:as the baseline value for inter-sectoral elasticity of substitution between

18:741:36493:15:14:110:476:567:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:by values of within a reasonable range. The baseline parameterization
18:742:36561:14:15:110:476:553:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:leads to a price mark up of 23 percent under Bertrand Competition and

18:750:37077:15:14:110:476:437:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:is within the range of the plausible values of 0.5 to 0.7 reported by
18:751:37146:14:15:110:476:423:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Petrongolo and Pissarides (2001) in their survey of the literature on the

18:754:37358:15:14:110:476:379:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:below, the equality between the elasticity of matches to unemployment

19:810:39431:15:14:110:476:278:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:tition.  As well known, when Örms compete in prices the equilibrium
19:811:39498:14:14:110:476:264:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:mark ups are lower, which in turn allows for a lower number of Örms
19:812:39565:14:15:110:476:250:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:to be active in the market. As a consequence, given the entry costs,
19:813:39633:15:14:110:476:235:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the Bertrand equilibrium is characterized by a lower number of goods
19:814:39701:14:15:110:476:221:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:compared to the Cournot equilibrium. Not surprisingly a lower entry
19:815:39768:15:14:110:476:206:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:cost is, in both frameworks, associated to a higher number of producers
19:816:39839:14:15:110:476:192:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and thus to stronger competition and to a lower mark up. As mentioned
19:817:39908:15:14:110:446:177:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:earlier, the real wage is higher in more competitive environments.

20:856:41336:15:14:110:476:355:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:is exogenous. SpeciÖcally, Örms do not interact strategically and set a

20:872:42320:18:16:120:476:105:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:18We say that the markup is exogenous in the case of monopolistic competition
20:873:42397:16:12:110:476:89:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:because its value is fully determined once the elasitcity of substitution between goods
20:874:42484:12:8:110:429:77:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:is Öxed. In other words the two magnitudes cannot be set independently.
20:875:42555:8:16:120:476:69:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:19We compare our baseline model to the search model with capital so that both
20:876:42632:16:0:110:307:53:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:are characterized by endogenous investment.

21:880:42885:15:14:128:476:610:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Under Bertrand and Cournot competition the market structure is
21:881:42947:14:14:110:476:596:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:generated endogenously and the steady state mark ups are respectively
21:882:43016:14:15:110:476:582:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:23 per cent and 33 per cent. On the contrary in the case of monopolistic
21:883:43088:15:14:110:476:567:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:competition the mark up is exogenous and equals 20 per cent. Figures
21:884:43156:14:15:110:476:553:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:2 and 3 show that the quantitative reactions of the main aggregate vari-
21:885:43228:15:14:110:476:538:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ables to the shock are very similar in both the Bertrand and the Cournot
21:886:43300:14:15:110:172:524:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:frameworks.
21:887:43311:15:14:128:476:509:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:The temporary shock increases output and creates large proÖt op-
21:888:43375:14:15:110:476:495:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:portunities. This, in turn, leads to entry of new Örms and lowers the
21:889:43444:15:14:110:476:480:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:mark up. Recall that entry is subject to a one period time-to-build lag,
21:890:43516:14:14:110:476:466:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:which implies that the number of producing Örms,Nt, does not change
21:891:43583:14:15:110:476:452:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:on impact. Given that both the love for variety and the mark up are
21:892:43650:15:14:110:476:437:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:just functions ofNtthey are also initially muted. Output, instead, has
21:893:43720:14:15:110:476:423:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:its peak in the initial period due to the strong response of investment
21:894:43791:15:14:110:476:408:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:(in new Örms) and consumption. To satisfy the higher demand, existing
21:895:43860:14:15:110:476:394:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Örms use both the intensive margin and the extensive margin of labor.
21:896:43929:15:14:110:476:379:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:The need to hire workers boosts vacancy posting on impact. In the pe-
21:897:43998:14:15:110:476:365:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:riods after the shock vacancy creation is more sustained, with respect to
21:898:44071:15:14:110:476:350:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the benchmark model, for two reasons. The Örst one in due to vacancy
21:899:44139:14:15:110:476:336:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:creation by new entrants which need to build up their workforce. The
21:900:44207:15:14:110:476:321:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:second one is due to the rise in the number of producers that leads to an
21:901:44280:14:14:110:476:307:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:increase in the ratio-t-t, which provides an incentive for vacancy posting
21:902:44354:14:15:110:476:293:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:to both existing Örms and to new entrants. Figure 3 shows that under
21:903:44422:15:14:110:476:278:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:endogenous market structures the response of the job Önding rate and
21:904:44490:14:15:110:476:264:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the vacancy Ölling rate are strongly ampliÖed with respect to those ob-
21:905:44561:15:14:110:476:249:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:tained in the benchmark search model. The large number of vacancies
21:906:44628:14:15:110:476:235:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:posted on impact by incumbent Örms, and vacancy posting by entrants
21:907:44695:15:14:110:476:220:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in the periods after the shocks, makes it harder to Öll a vacancy for a
21:908:44766:14:15:110:476:206:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:producers. The counterpart of a markedly countercyclical vacancy Ölling
21:909:44837:15:14:110:476:191:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:rate is a strongly procyclical job Önding rate. Hall (2005) argues that
21:910:44908:14:14:110:476:177:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the job Önding rate is the key variable in understanding the large áuctu-
21:911:44981:14:15:110:476:163:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ation in unemployment over the past 50 years. The strongly procyclical
21:912:45051:15:14:110:476:148:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:response of the job Önding rate delivered by the Bertrand and Cournot
21:913:45120:14:15:110:476:134:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:models is at the basis of the large swing in unemployment.  The endo-
21:914:45189:15:14:110:476:119:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:geneity of the market structures implies a response of the unemployment
21:915:45260:14:15:110:476:105:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:rate in the period after the shock which is almost three times larger, and
21:916:45334:15:14:110:460:90:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:more persistent, than that observed in the benchmark search model.
21:917:45400:14:15:128:476:76:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:While the shock vanishes and entry strengthens competition, output

24:1066:50191:15:14:110:476:333:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:volatile as output in the benchmark model, it is twice as volatile as out-
24:1067:50265:14:15:110:476:319:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:put in our framework. Similar considerations extend to vacancies, which
24:1068:50336:15:14:110:476:304:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:are 3.3 times as volatile as output, the job Önding probability, which has
24:1069:50410:14:15:110:476:290:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:a volatility more than double with respect to output. Both frameworks
24:1070:50479:15:14:110:476:275:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:deliver an extremely volatile job market tightness with respect to the
24:1071:50549:14:14:110:476:261:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:basic search model. Similarly, the volatility of investment is about three
24:1072:50623:14:15:110:476:247:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:times higher in our framework, essentially matching that in the data.
24:1073:50692:15:14:110:476:232:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:The volatilities of proÖts and the mark up are severely underestimated,
24:1074:50763:14:15:110:476:218:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:however the model does a relatively good job at matching the negative

24:1076:50891:14:15:128:476:189:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Considering that we adopt a very standard and conservative model
24:1077:50955:15:14:110:476:174:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:calibration we see the performance of both the Bertrand and the Cournot
24:1078:51026:14:15:110:476:160:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:frameworks as a success for three main reasons. First, without resorting
24:1079:51098:15:14:110:476:145:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:to nominal rigidities in wages (real or nominal) or prices, it substantially
24:1080:51174:14:15:110:476:131:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:outperforms a standard model of search in the labor market in terms of
24:1081:51244:15:14:110:476:116:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:variability of labor market variables. Second, the model can reproduce
24:1082:51314:14:14:110:476:102:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the procyclicality of entry and the countercyclicality of the mark up ob-
24:1083:51387:14:18:110:476:88:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:served in the data. Third, it matches the nonlinear time proÖle of the
24:1084:51457:18:16:120:476:70:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:21The standard deviation of individual hours is 0.17 under both Bertrand and
24:1085:51533:16:0:110:420:54:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:Cournot competition, while it is 0.02 under the standard search model.
25:1086:51605:0:15:110:476:654:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:correlation between the mark up and the cycle documented by Rotem-

25:1106:52411:22:15:110:476:313:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Before concluding, we study a scenario where a benevolent social planner

27:1295:55448:15:14:110:476:252:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:under two alternative scenarios. In the Örst one,\r=-= 1, the Hosios
27:1296:55516:14:15:110:476:238:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:condition holds, workers have all the bargaining power but, as pointed
27:1297:55586:15:14:110:476:223:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:out by Ebell and Haefke (2009), the matching function is degenerate. In

27:1300:55789:14:14:110:476:180:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:dition is satisÖed. Ruling out the distortion on the extensive margin of
27:1301:55861:14:15:110:476:166:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:labor due to imperfect competition in the goods market requires setting
27:1302:55932:15:14:110:477:151:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f6:B:-t=-= 1. However, this would lead to no entry since, as pointed out
27:1303:55999:14:15:110:476:137:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:by BGM (2006), in the absence of a positive net mark up Örms could
27:1304:56065:15:14:110:245:122:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:not recover the entry cost.
27:1305:56092:14:15:128:476:108:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:The positive mark up also implies a time-varying wedge between the
27:1306:56158:15:14:110:476:93:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:marginal rate of substitution between consumption and the marginal rate
27:1307:56229:14:15:110:476:79:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of transformation, which leads to an ine¢ ciently low supply of individual
27:1308:56303:15:0:110:476:64:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:hours. Thus, the price mark up creates an intratemporal distortion in
28:1309:56374:0:15:110:476:654:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:both the extensive and the intensive margin of labor. Next, consider
28:1310:56442:15:14:110:476:639:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:equation(37)and compare it the SP correspondent condition(32). In
28:1311:56507:14:15:110:476:625:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the CE new entrants and incumbent Örms are characterized by di§erent
28:1312:56575:15:14:110:476:610:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:values due to the di§erent initial hiring policy. This heterogeneity creates
28:1313:56651:14:14:110:476:596:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:an intertemporal wedge between the CE and the SP equilibrium which
28:1314:56717:14:15:110:419:582:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:distorts the allocation of consumption across di§erent dates.
28:1315:56778:15:14:128:476:567:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:As a consequence, both áuctuations and the stationary equilibrium
28:1316:56843:14:15:110:476:553:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:are ine¢ cient in the CE. In particular the extensive margin of labor is
28:1317:56915:15:14:110:476:538:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:distorted even if the Hosios condition is satisÖed.  Inducing e¢ ciency
28:1318:56986:14:15:110:476:524:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in the decentralized equilibrium would require a combination of Öscal
28:1319:57055:15:14:110:476:509:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:instruments aimed at undoing the intratemporal and the intertemporal
28:1320:57123:14:15:110:242:495:12:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:B:wedges described above.23
28:1321:57148:15:14:128:476:480:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:In what follows we compare the steady state allocations of the CE to
28:1322:57216:14:14:110:476:466:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the SP one. We assume that the Hosios condition holds throughout the
28:1323:57284:14:15:110:476:452:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:analysis. In this case we can evaluate both the magnitude and the sign of
28:1324:57357:15:14:110:476:437:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the distortion due to oligopolistic competition. Panelsa)-e)of Figure 4

28:1326:57499:15:14:110:476:408:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:selected variables as a function of the entry cost, under both Bertrand
28:1327:57570:14:15:110:476:394:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and Cournot competition.  The percentage di§erence is measured in
28:1328:57635:15:14:110:476:379:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:terms of the SP allocation. Panelf)displays the welfare cost due to an
28:1329:57705:14:15:110:476:365:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ine¢ cient allocation as the percentage variation in consumption that a
28:1330:57776:15:14:110:476:350:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:consumer should experience in the CE to be as well o§ as under the SP
28:1331:57845:14:15:110:180:336:12:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:B:equilibrium.24
28:1332:57859:15:14:128:476:321:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Few remarks are in order.  In the case of a relatively high entry
28:1333:57924:14:14:110:476:307:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:cost, the CE could be characterized by an excessive number of varieties.
28:1334:57996:14:15:110:476:293:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Under Cournot this happens quite quickly since the latter competitive
28:1335:58065:15:14:110:476:278:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:framework is characterized by a higher number of varieties with respect
28:1336:58136:14:15:110:476:264:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:to Bertrand. Recall that the number of varieties in the CE, or equiv-
28:1337:58205:15:14:110:476:249:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:alently the number of Örms, is decreasing in the entry cost. However,
28:1338:58274:14:15:110:476:235:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the opposite holds for the price-mark up.  A high mark up could, in
28:1339:58341:15:14:110:476:220:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:turn, lead to high proÖts and thus to an excessive number of variety
28:1340:58409:14:15:110:476:206:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:produced.  Due to imperfect competition the CE is characterized by
28:1341:58475:15:14:110:476:191:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:under-employment and by an ine¢ ciently low level of hours worked no
28:1342:58543:14:18:110:476:177:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:matter the hosios condition.  The same can be said for output.  As

29:1363:59267:26:22:110:220:556:14:g_d0_f9:14:g_d0_f10:C:5Conclusions
29:1364:59279:22:15:110:476:534:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:We provided a DSGE model where Örmsídynamics and matching fric-
29:1365:59342:15:14:110:476:519:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:tions in the labor market interact endogenously. We accounted for strate-
29:1366:59415:14:15:110:476:505:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:gic interactions in both prices and quantities among producers.  The
29:1367:59483:15:14:110:476:490:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:interplay between search and matching frictions, endogenous entry and
29:1368:59552:14:15:110:476:476:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:strategic interactions among producers constitutes a strong ampliÖca-

29:1372:59828:15:14:110:476:418:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:substantially outperforms the standard search and matching model at
29:1373:59895:14:15:110:476:404:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:replicating the observed variability of the unemployment rate, vacancies
29:1374:59967:15:14:110:476:389:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and the job market tightness. Also, the model explains the procyclicality
29:1375:60040:14:15:110:439:375:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of proÖts together with the countercyclicality of price mark ups.
29:1376:60105:15:14:128:476:360:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Our analysis could be extended in various dimensions. One aspect we
29:1377:60172:14:15:110:476:346:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:neglect is the asymmetry between market competitors in terms of both
29:1378:60240:15:14:110:476:331:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:size and the probability of exit form the market. Davis et al. (2009)
29:1379:60309:14:14:110:476:317:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:document that the distribution of vacancy creation is strongly biased
29:1380:60378:14:15:110:476:303:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in favor of small Örms; Haltiwanger et al.  (2009) show that younger
29:1381:60446:15:14:110:476:288:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Örms are more likely to exit from the market than more mature Örms.
29:1382:60513:14:15:110:476:274:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Another important aspect that we do not discuss is, as documented by
29:1383:60581:15:14:110:476:259:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Davis et al. (2009), that a large fractions of new hires happens without
29:1384:60653:14:15:110:227:245:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:prior vacancy creation.
29:1385:60676:15:14:128:476:230:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:In ongoing research we extend our framework to a government sector
29:1386:60742:14:15:110:476:216:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and analyze the transmission of government spending shocks to the labor

29:1388:60881:14:14:110:476:187:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:with endogenous market structures could help resolving the unemploy-

29:1390:61017:15:26:110:367:158:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:without departing from a áexible prices approach.
