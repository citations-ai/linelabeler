2:28:1267:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:This paper analyzes a class of competitive economies with production, incomplete financial markets,
2:29:1366:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:and agency frictions. Firms take their production, financing, and contractual decisions so as to maximize
2:30:1471:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:their value under rational conjectures. We show that competitive equilibria exist and that shareholders
2:31:1574:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:always unanimously support firms' choices. In addition, equilibrium allocations have well-defined
2:32:1671:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:welfare properties: they are constrained efficient when information is symmetric, or when agency
2:33:1767:14:28:72:278:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:frictions satisfy certain specific conditions.
2:34:1813:28:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:Furthermore, equilibria may display specialization on the part of identical firms and, when equilibria
2:35:1915:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:are constrained inefficient, may exhibit excessive aggregate risk. Financial decisions of the corporate
2:36:2018:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:C:sector are determined at equilibrium and depend not only on the nature of financial frictions but also
2:37:2120:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:C:on the consumers' demand for risk. Financial intermediation and short sales are naturally accounted
2:38:2219:14:42:72:160:434:12:Times:12:Times:C:for at equilibrium.

3:53:2491:0:31:72:208:708:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:C:1    Introduction
3:54:2508:31:19:72:540:677:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The notion of competitive equilibrium in incomplete market economies with production is
3:55:2595:19:19:72:540:658:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:considered problematic in economics.  This is because,  when financial markets are incom-
3:56:2684:19:18:72:540:639:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:plete and equity is traded in asset markets, firms’ production decisions may affect the set of
3:57:2778:18:19:72:539:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:insurance possibilities available to consumers, the asset span of the economy.1As a conse-
3:58:2868:19:19:72:540:602:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:quence, macro models with production and incomplete markets typically assume that firms’
3:59:2956:19:19:72:540:583:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:equity is not traded, or that firms operate with a backyard technology and are managed by
3:60:3045:19:19:72:134:564:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:households.2
3:61:3057:19:18:89:539:545:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Similarly, while agency frictions are at the core of corporate finance, they have been hardly
3:62:3150:18:19:72:540:527:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:studied in the context of equilibrium models.  This is also arguably due to the conceptual
3:63:3240:19:19:72:539:508:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:difficulties involved in the definition of competitive equilibria with asymmetric information.3
3:64:3335:19:19:89:539:489:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In this paper we study a class of economies with production, incomplete financial mar-
3:65:3421:19:18:72:540:470:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:kets, and agency frictions (for instance between the firm’s manager and its shareholders, or
3:66:3513:18:19:72:540:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:between shareholders and bondholders).  To highlight the foundational aspect of our analy-
3:67:3603:19:19:72:540:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sis, we restrict attention to simple two period economies along the lines of classical general
3:68:3697:19:19:72:540:414:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:equilibrium theory4embedding the key features of macroeconomic models with production.
3:69:3783:19:19:72:540:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:At a competitive equilibrium - we postulate - price-taking firms take their production, financ-
3:70:3878:19:18:72:539:376:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:B:ing, and contractual decisions so as to maximize their value defined on the basis ofrational
3:71:3970:18:19:72:539:358:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f2:B:conjectures, as in Makowski (1983a,b).  These conjectures   guide firms’ decisions when the
3:72:4061:19:19:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:value  of  production  plans  lies  outside  the  asset  span  of  the  economy  and  the  rationality
3:73:4163:19:19:72:540:320:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:condition can be interpreted as a consistency condition on firms’ out-of-equilibrium beliefs.
3:74:4256:19:18:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The analysis is first carried out in a set-up where short sales of assets are not allowed5, but
3:75:4351:18:19:85:539:283:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:1It is only in rather special environments, as pointed out by Diamond (1967), that the spanning condition
3:76:4456:19:15:72:540:264:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:holds and such issue does not arise; see also the more recent contribution by Carceles-Poveda and Coen-Pirani
3:77:4565:15:10:72:102:249:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:(2009).
3:78:4572:10:19:85:539:239:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:2This is the case, for instance, in Bewley economies, the workhorse of macroeconomic model with incom-
3:79:4674:19:15:72:540:220:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:plete markets; see e.g., Ljungqvist and Sargent (2004) and Heathcoate, Storesletten, and Violante (2010) for
3:80:4782:15:10:72:136:205:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:recent surveys.
3:81:4797:10:19:85:539:195:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:3See,  e.g.,  Bolton  and  Dewatripont  (2005)  and  Tirole  (2006).   A  few  notable  exceptions  include  Dow,
3:82:4910:19:9:72:485:176:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:Gorton, and Krishnamurthy (2005), Acharya and Bisin (2009), and Parlour and Walde (2011).
3:83:4999:9:19:85:539:167:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:4In a complementary paper, Bisin and Gottardi (2012), we consider Bewley economies, that is, infinite
3:84:5100:19:10:72:368:148:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:horizon economies with incomplete markets but no agency frictions.
3:85:5166:10:19:85:539:138:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:5This condition ensures the perfectly competitive nature of forms’ decisions even when markets are in-
3:86:5268:19:0:72:114:119:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:complete.
4:87:5278:0:19:72:453:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:it is then extended to incorporate financial intermediation and short sales.
4:88:5354:19:19:89:539:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We show that competitive equilibria, according to this definition, exist and have theo-
4:89:5441:19:19:72:540:670:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:retically appealing properties.  First of all, in the absence of agency frictions, or when such
4:90:5536:19:19:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:frictions  satisfy  appropriate  conditions  (satisfied,  for  instance,  when  the  frictions  concern
4:91:5639:19:18:72:540:632:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the  firm’s  manager  and  its  shareholders)  equilibrium  allocations  are  constrained  efficient.
4:92:5740:18:19:72:540:614:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Equilibria may otherwise fail to be constrained efficient, with the source of the inefficiency
4:93:5834:19:19:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:lying in an externality generated by the agency friction, and we show that when this hap-
4:94:5923:19:19:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:pens equilibria may display excessive aggregate risk.  In addition, shareholders unanimously
4:95:6015:19:18:72:540:557:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:support value maximization and hence firms’ choices, even when allocations are not efficient
4:96:6107:18:19:72:540:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:at equilibrium.  We also identify conditions under which ex-ante identical firms might choose
4:97:6200:19:19:72:540:520:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to specialize in equilibrium, that is to adopt different production, financial, and contractual
4:98:6295:19:19:72:540:501:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:decisions so as to optimally accommodate the demand of different consumers.  Finally, in the
4:99:6387:19:19:72:540:482:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:class of economies considered the Modigliani-Miller result does not hold in general and the
4:100:6478:19:18:72:540:463:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:financial decisions of the corporate sector are determinate at equilibrium and depend not
4:101:6567:18:19:72:522:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:only on the nature of the financial frictions but also on the consumers’ demand for risk.
4:102:6656:19:19:89:539:426:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We take these findings to imply that the analysis of production economies with incomplete
4:103:6745:19:19:72:540:407:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:markets and agency frictions rests on solid theoretical foundations in general equilibrium,
4:104:6836:19:18:72:540:388:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:thereby providing some foundations to the integrated study of macroeconomics and corporate

4:108:7047:19:19:72:540:284:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Shafer (1986), a large literature has dealt with the question of what is the appropriate objec-
4:109:7142:19:18:72:540:265:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tive function of the firm in economies with incomplete markets (under symmetric information,
4:110:7234:18:19:72:540:247:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that is, with no agency frictions).  Different objective functions have been proposed and re-
4:111:7327:19:19:72:540:228:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sults generally display unappealing theoretical properties, in particular the lack of unanimity
4:112:7422:19:19:72:540:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of shareholders on the firms’ decisions. This literature however seems to have somewhat over-

5:127:8703:19:19:72:427:576:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:permitting short-sales on equity and general financial intermediation.
5:128:8773:19:18:89:539:557:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:With regards to agency frictions and asymmetric information, most of the competitive
5:129:8857:18:19:72:540:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:equilibrium concepts which have been proposed build on the concept proposed by Prescott
5:130:8944:19:19:72:539:520:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and Townsend (1984) for exchange economies, therefore exhibiting no traded equity.8While
5:131:9032:19:19:72:540:501:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Prescott and Townsend’s approach, rooted in mechanism design, is quite different from ours,
5:132:9123:19:19:72:539:482:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:which instead relies on the extension ofrational conjecturesto economies with asymmetric
5:133:9211:19:18:72:540:463:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:information, we show that our equilibrium concept is indeed equivalent to the one of Prescott
5:134:9304:18:19:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and Townsend once this is extended to economies with incomplete markets where firms rather
5:135:9394:19:19:72:539:426:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:than consumers face agency frictions.9Nonetheless,  interesting and important conceptual
5:136:9482:19:19:72:540:407:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:differences emerge when the analysis is extended from exchange to production economies,
5:137:9569:19:18:72:540:388:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:since  we  show  there  are  natural  environments  where  informational  asymmetries  in  firms’
5:138:9666:18:31:72:464:370:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:decisions give rise to externalities while in consumers’ problems they do not.
5:139:9744:31:19:89:539:339:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The class of economies considered is described in Section 2, where the equilibrium notion
5:140:9833:19:19:72:540:320:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is  also  presented.   Existence,  the  welfare  properties  of  equilibria  and  unanimity  are  then
5:141:9935:19:19:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:established in Section 3, while additional properties of equilibria are derived in Section 4.
5:142:10028:19:18:72:540:282:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Section 5 studies the determinants of firms’ financial decisions. Section 6 extends the analysis
5:143:10124:18:19:72:540:264:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to allow for financial intermediation and short sales. Section 7 concludes. Proofs are collected
5:144:10220:19:18:72:159:245:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the Appendix.
5:145:10236:18:19:85:539:227:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:7Under the same conditions, Makowski (1983b) shows that competitive equilibria are constrained Pareto
5:146:10337:19:10:72:108:208:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:optimal.

5:148:10430:13:19:85:539:185:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:9We do not discuss economies with adverse selection in this paper.  We conjecture that the equilibrium
5:149:10532:19:15:72:540:166:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:concepts studied by Bisin and Gottardi (2006) have an equivalent reformulation in terms of equilibria with
5:150:10638:15:80:72:540:151:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f6:F:rational conjecturesin economies with production along similar lines to those considered in the present paper.

6:153:10802:29:31:101:234:679:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:C:agency frictions
6:154:10818:31:18:72:540:648:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In this section we introduce an abstract economy with production, incomplete financial mar-
6:155:10909:18:19:72:540:630:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:kets and agency frictions.  Various applications, examples, and extensions will be considered
6:156:11002:19:19:72:156:611:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in later sections.
6:157:11020:19:19:89:540:592:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The economy lasts two periods,t= 0,1,and at each date a single commodity is available.
6:158:11106:19:18:72:540:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Uncertainty is described by a random variableson the finite supportS={1,...,S}, which
6:159:11191:18:19:72:539:555:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:realizes att= 1.10We assume the economy is populated by i) a continuum of consumers, of
6:160:11278:19:19:72:540:536:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:Idifferent types, each of them of unit mass; and ii) a continuum of firms, of unit mass, for
6:161:11370:19:19:72:540:517:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:simplicity all identical.  The economy is perfectly competitive and both firms and consumers
6:162:11462:19:19:72:202:498:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:take then prices as given.
6:163:11488:19:18:89:539:479:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Each consumeri= 1,..,Ihas an endowment ofwi0units of the single commodity at date
6:164:11569:18:19:71:540:461:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:0 andwi1(s) units at date 1, thus the agent’s endowment is also subject to the shock affecting
6:165:11663:19:19:71:540:442:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the economy att= 1.    He is also endowed withθi0≥0 units of equity of the representa-
6:166:11749:19:19:71:540:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tive firm.  Consumerihas preferences over consumption in the two dates,  represented by
6:167:11836:19:18:71:506:404:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f2:B:Eui(ci0,ci1(s)), whereui(·) is also continuously differentiable, increasing and concave.
6:168:11924:18:19:89:539:386:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Firms in the economy produce at date 1 using as physical input the single commodity
6:169:12007:19:19:71:539:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:invested as capital at time 0.Each firm’s output depends on the investmentkbut is also
6:170:12093:19:19:71:539:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in principle affected by agency frictions.  At an abstract level, we model these frictions by
6:171:12186:19:19:71:540:329:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:assuming  that  the  firm’s  output  also  depends  on  two  other  choices:φ,  not  observable  to
6:172:12285:19:18:71:539:310:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:outside  investors,  andm,  which  is  instead  observable.   For  instance,φcould  represent  a
6:173:12381:18:19:71:539:292:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:technological  or  administrative  choice  andmcould  represent  a  -  possibly  costly  -  action
6:174:12479:19:19:71:540:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:undertaken to limit the effects of agency frictions.11The cost of this action might be born
6:175:12570:19:19:71:540:254:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:both at time 0 and at time 1.  Letf(k,φ,m;s) denote the time 1 output, net of costs, for
6:176:12658:19:18:71:539:235:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:k∈K, φ∈Φ,m∈M.  We assume that Φ,K,Mare closed, compact subsets of non-negative
6:177:12736:18:19:71:540:217:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Euclidean spaces, withK⊆R+,convex and 0∈K.  Also, unless stated otherwise, Φ is a
6:178:12817:19:19:71:539:198:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:finite set.12Moreover,f(k,φ,m;s) is continuous ink,φ,mand continuously differentiable,
6:179:12903:19:19:81:540:179:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:10Any  function  ofs,  sayg(s)  is  then  a  random  variable  and  we  denote  its  mean  byE[g(s)].   Abusing
6:180:13014:19:9:72:518:160:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:notation we shall letsalso denote the realization of the random variable when clear from the context.
6:181:13115:9:20:81:539:151:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:11Some examples are presented in Section 2.2 to illustrate possible interpretations of these variables and
6:182:13221:20:15:72:540:131:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:applications to standard frictions considered in corporate finance concerning managers,  shareholders,  and
6:183:13328:15:9:72:147:116:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:outside investors.
6:184:13346:9:0:81:540:107:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:12The condition that the set of admissible values ofkis bounded above is restrictive but   by no means

7:187:13620:19:19:71:540:670:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the cost paid at time 0 is denoted byW(k,φ,m,B) and we allow them to depend also on
7:188:13703:19:19:71:307:651:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the firms’ financial decisions, described below.
7:189:13751:19:18:89:539:632:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Each  firm  takes  both  production  and  financial  decisions.   The  outstanding  amount  of
7:190:13845:18:10:71:539:614:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:equity is normalized to 1:  the initial distribution of equity among consumers satisfies then
7:191:13938:10:13:71:84:604:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:C:∑

7:194:13942:7:16:95:540:592:8:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f2:A:0=  1.  We  assume this amount of  equity is kept  constant  and a firm  can issue (non
7:195:14029:16:19:71:539:576:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:contingent) bonds.  Hence the capital structure of a firm is only determined by its decision
7:196:14121:19:18:71:540:557:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:concerning the amountBof bonds issued.  The total payment due to bondholders att= 1
7:197:14204:18:19:72:540:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:equalsB, but the actual payment may be smaller if the resources available for such payment
7:198:14294:19:19:72:540:520:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:- at most equal to the firm’s net outputf(k,φ,m;s) - are insufficient, in which case the firm
7:199:14387:19:19:71:539:501:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:defaults and these resources are divided pro-rata among all bondholders.  As a consequence
7:200:14477:19:19:71:539:482:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the unit return on bonds depends on the firm’s production and financing choices,k,φ,m,B,
7:201:14565:19:18:71:540:463:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:as well as the date 1 shock, and is so denoted byRb(k,φ,m,B;s).The rest of the firm’s
7:202:14650:18:19:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:net  output  is  then  entirely  distributed  to  shareholders,  so  that  the  unit  return  on  equity
7:203:14754:19:27:72:202:426:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:Re(k,φ,m,B;s) satisfies:
7:204:14778:27:28:170:540:399:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:A:f(k,φ,m;s) =Re(k,φ,m,B;s) +Rb(k,φ,m,B;s)B(1)
7:205:14822:28:18:72:540:371:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:It is natural to assume thatRe(k,φ,m,B;s) andRb(k,φ,m,B;s) are non negative, contin-

7:207:14994:19:19:72:130:334:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with 0∈B.
7:208:15003:19:19:89:539:315:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The  firms’  equity  and  debt  are  the  only  assets  in  the  economy.   If  all  firms  make  the

7:210:15195:19:18:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f8:B:can trade and we write below his choice problem for that case.  Att= 0 each consumeri

7:214:15552:19:27:72:486:202:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cannot short-sell the firm’s equity nor its debt.13The problem of agentiis then:

8:228:16113:26:19:72:540:567:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:It is useful to introduce the competitive equilibrium notion we propose by considering first

10:306:20294:19:19:72:540:662:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:hence the firm faces some agency frictions.  More specifically, outside investors can decide
10:307:20386:19:18:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:their  portfolio  on  the  basis  of  the  firm’s  choice  ofk,B,m,  which  are  observable,  but  will

10:311:20763:19:18:72:540:568:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:firm’s shareholders), the same is generally no longer the case forφ,whose choice is subject
10:312:20854:18:19:72:539:550:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to implementability constraints.  Such constraints reflect the fact that the choice ofφis the
10:313:20947:19:19:72:540:531:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:solution of an independent problem, which depends on the specific agency frictions present in
10:314:21040:19:19:72:540:512:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the economy:  for instance, the choice ofφmight be delegated to a manager, or shareholders
10:315:21130:19:19:72:539:493:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:might chooseφto maximize the value of equity.  Here we adopt an abstract specification,
10:316:21217:19:18:72:539:474:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:whereby  the  firm’s  choice  ofφ∈Φ  is  subject  to  an  abstract  constraint  described  by  the
10:317:21315:18:19:72:147:456:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:following map:
10:318:21329:19:25:254:540:437:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:A:φ∈φ(k,m,B;c(s)),(10)

10:320:21438:19:19:72:540:393:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and,  possibly,  also  on  other  variables  external  to  the  firm,  as  the  consumption  allocation

14:481:30393:26:19:72:540:252:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The key feature of the competitive equilibrium notion we propose consists in the formula-
14:482:30482:19:19:72:540:233:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tion of the restriction imposed on firms’ price conjectures, the Makowski rationality criterion
14:483:30577:19:19:72:540:214:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:M). As already noticed in Section 2.1 the consistency condition C) together with the con-
14:484:30666:19:18:72:540:195:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sumers’ first order conditions imply that this restriction is satisfied by the equilibrium choice
14:485:30763:18:19:72:539:177:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:k,φ,m,B.  Hence the main bite of the rationality criterion is to require that the same prop-
14:486:30855:19:19:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:erty holds for any other admissible choicek′,φ′,m′,B′.  It should then be interpreted as a
14:487:30945:19:19:72:359:139:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:consistency condition for out of equilibrium conjectures.

15:492:31280:19:19:72:540:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:given, evaluated at the equilibrium consumption values and unaffected by the firm’s choice
15:493:31370:19:19:72:539:670:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ofk,φ,m,B.  In this sense each firm is price taker, is ”small” relative to the market, and we
15:494:31463:19:19:71:514:651:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:can think of each consumer as holding a negligible amount of shares of any given firm.
15:495:31549:19:18:89:539:632:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We claim this equilibrium notion is natural in competitive production economies.  Before
15:496:31637:18:19:71:539:614:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:discussing the properties of equilibria, we argue here that this notion is equivalent to two
15:497:31729:19:25:71:376:595:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:others adopted in the literature (in different environments).

15:502:32166:19:19:71:539:495:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:one  corresponding  to  the  firms’  equilibrium  choicek,φ,B,m-  clear  at  zero  trades.   As  a
15:503:32264:19:19:71:540:476:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:consequence,q(k′,φ′,B′,m′) andp(k′,φ′,B′,m′) correspond to the equilibrium prices of eq-
15:504:32352:19:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:uity  and  bonds  of  a  firm  who  were  to  “deviate”  from  the  equilibrium  choice  and  choose

15:506:32545:19:19:72:540:420:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:condition on the out of equilibrium values of the equity and bonds price conjectures, that
15:507:32635:19:19:72:455:401:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:corresponds to a “refinement” somewhat analogous to subgame perfection.

15:510:32896:19:19:72:540:345:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cept prices depend both on unobservable as well as observable choices and this is sustained,

15:513:33168:19:18:72:540:288:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ible.  In contrast, the equilibrium concept we propose relies on price conjectures that reflect
15:514:33263:18:19:72:540:270:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the correct anticipation of unobservable choices.  It is however straightforward to show that
15:515:33356:19:19:72:540:251:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:these  two  approaches  are  equivalent.   The  equilibrium  notion  proposed  by  Prescott  and

15:520:33813:19:19:72:540:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to verify that these Prescott Townsend competitive equilibria are equivalent to competitive

16:561:35973:20:30:71:310:101:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:admissible allocations for the case in which they don’t.

17:568:36431:31:19:89:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Thus in the economy with no agency frictions described in Section 2.1, whereφis ob-
17:569:36514:19:19:71:539:569:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:servable and its choice is unrestricted in Φ,constrained efficiency always holds.  With agency
17:570:36608:19:19:71:539:550:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:frictions, considering the characterization introduced in Section 2.2, we find that constrained
17:571:36703:19:18:71:539:531:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:efficiency obtains when the friction is of the delegated management type, that is, when firms
17:572:36796:18:19:71:539:513:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:delegate the choice of the unobservable variableφto a manager andmcontains the man-
17:573:36879:19:19:71:539:494:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ager’s type as well as his compensation contract.  In this case, as we noted,φis determined
17:574:36970:19:19:72:540:475:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by (12) and is independent ofc(s).23Note that a key feature for the specification of the in-
17:575:37062:19:18:72:540:456:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:centive constraint in (12), and thus also for the efficiency result, is that the manager’s trades
17:576:37159:18:19:72:540:438:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are observable, so that the manager cannot trade his way out of his compensation package.
17:577:37248:19:19:72:504:419:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:In other words, it is crucial that the manager’s compensation contract is exclusive.24
17:578:37334:19:19:89:539:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:On the other hand constrained efficiency may fail when the incentive constraint depends
17:579:37421:19:19:71:540:381:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:also on variables not directly chosen by the firm, like the consumption allocationc(s), as we
17:580:37514:19:18:72:540:362:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:showed it happens in the shareholders/bondholders problem considered in Section 2.2.1.  In
17:581:37604:18:19:72:435:344:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this case in fact an externality arises, generated by the agency friction.
17:582:37678:19:19:89:539:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:At  the  same  time,  we  should  point  out  that  this  is  the  only  source  of  inefficiency  in
17:583:37779:19:19:72:540:306:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:our  economy.   In  all  other  respects,  firms’  decisions  are  efficient  and,  as  we  show  next,

17:585:37976:19:18:72:540:268:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and 2.2 in fact all shareholders unanimously agree on the firm’s production and financing

17:590:38355:20:15:72:540:174:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:essentially analogous to the one used to establish the Pareto efficiency of competitive equilibria in Arrow-

18:600:39068:32:18:89:539:619:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The result follows from the fact that, as noticed in Section 2.4, the equilibrium allocation
18:601:39160:18:19:72:540:601:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is the same as the one which would obtain if markets for all possible types of equity and
18:602:39249:19:19:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bonds were open.  Consequently, the unanimity result holds by the same argument as the
18:603:39335:19:40:72:403:563:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:one used to establish this property for Arrow-Debreu economies.

18:605:39458:26:19:72:540:497:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The problems found in the literature and recalled in Section 1.1, concerning the specification

18:607:39655:19:19:72:540:459:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:shown in the previous section, in the set-up typically considered in this literature (that is,
18:608:39749:19:19:72:540:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with no agency frictions), both unanimity and constrained efficiency hold.  The key difference
18:609:39843:19:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:between this paper and this literature lies in the specification of the firms’ price conjectures.
18:610:39940:18:19:72:539:403:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:It is useful then to compare theMakoswki criterionfor rational conjectures to the two main

18:619:40363:36:19:72:540:261:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:It requires the conjectured price of equity for any plank,φ,m,Bto equal - pro rata - the
18:620:40451:19:19:72:540:242:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:marginal valuation of the agents who in equilibrium are shareholders of the firm (that is, the
18:621:40545:19:19:72:540:223:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:agents who value the most the plan chosen by the firm in equilibrium and hence choose to
18:622:40633:19:19:72:540:204:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:buy equity).  It does not however require that the firm’s shareholders are those who value
18:623:40723:19:18:72:540:185:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the most any possible plan of the firm.  Intuitively,  the choice of a plan which maximizes
18:624:40814:18:19:72:540:167:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the firm’s value withq(k,φ,m,B) as in (20) corresponds to a situation in which the firm’s

18:626:40995:19:19:72:540:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of selling the firm in the market, to allow the buyers of equity to operate the plan they instead
18:627:41092:19:0:72:540:110:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:prefer.  Equivalently, the value of equity for out of equilibrium production and financial plans
19:628:41190:0:19:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is determined using the - possibly incorrect - conjecture that the agents who in equilibrium

19:632:41480:19:30:72:301:632:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:when applied to the price of equity, requires:

19:637:41577:37:18:72:540:565:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We can interpret this specification as describing a situation where the firm’s plan is chosen by
19:638:41673:18:19:72:540:547:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the initial shareholders (i.e., those with some predetermined equity holdings at the beginning

19:640:41858:19:19:72:540:509:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:selling the equity to other consumers who value it more.  Equivalently, the value of equity
19:641:41949:19:18:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for out of equilibrium production and financial plans is derived using the conjecture that the
19:642:42043:18:19:72:523:472:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:firm’s initial shareholders stay in control of the firm whatever is the plan that is chosen.
19:643:42135:19:19:89:539:453:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In summary, according to the Makowski criterion for rational conjectures each firm eval-

19:645:42314:19:19:72:540:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(that is, possibly different pricing kernels, but all still consistent with the consumers’ marginal
19:646:42413:19:18:72:540:396:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rate of substitution at the equilibrium allocation).  This is essential to ensure the unanimity
19:647:42508:18:19:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of shareholders’ decisions and is a key difference with respect to Dreze (1974) and Grossman
19:648:42600:19:38:72:453:359:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:and Hart (1979), both of whom rely on the use of a single pricing kernel.26
19:649:42675:38:19:89:539:321:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:On a different note, our analysis also highlights an interesting and important difference
19:650:42764:19:18:72:540:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:between the properties of equilibria when agency frictions are faced by consumers, as e.g.,
19:651:42855:18:19:72:540:284:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in Prescott and Townsend’s analysis of exchange economies with asymmetric information,
19:652:42941:19:18:72:540:265:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and when instead such frictions are faced by firms.  While competitive equilibria are always
19:653:43033:18:19:81:539:247:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:25It is then easy to see that any allocation constituting an equilibrium with rational conjectures according
19:654:43141:19:16:72:540:228:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:to the criterion is also an equilibrium under the Dreze criterion:  all shareholders of a firm have in fact the
19:655:43252:16:15:72:540:212:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:same valuation for the firm’s production and financial plan and their marginal utility for any other possible
19:656:43361:15:16:72:540:197:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:plan is lower, hence a fortiori the chosen plan maximizes the weighted average of the shareholders’ valuations.
19:657:43472:16:15:72:540:181:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:But the reverse implication is not true, i.e., an equilibrium under the Dreze criterion is not in general an
19:658:43580:15:10:72:242:166:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:equilibrium under rational conjectures.
19:659:43619:10:19:81:539:156:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:26This feature distinguishes also the equilibrium notion based on the Makowski rationality criterion from
19:660:43724:19:15:72:540:137:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:the several others proposed in the literature,  including those applying elements from the theory of social

20:665:44078:19:19:72:540:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is not necessarily the case in production economies, as we have shown in Proposition 2.  The
20:666:44170:19:19:72:540:670:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:nature of the equilibrium concept adopted plays no role in this:  as we discussed in Section

20:668:44353:19:18:72:540:632:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:extended to production economies.  Rather, agency frictions and production may naturally
20:669:44441:18:19:72:257:614:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:interact to generate an externality.27
20:670:44479:19:19:89:539:595:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:An important implication of the welfare properties of production economies with agency
20:671:44565:19:19:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:frictions is that in economies where equilibrium allocations are constrained inefficient, e.g.
20:672:44659:19:18:72:540:557:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:when the agency friction is between shareholders and bondholders, a Pareto improvement
20:673:44745:18:19:72:540:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:may be achieved with different types of agents owning equity than the ones who do in equi-
20:674:44835:19:19:72:540:520:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:librium.  Since the unanimity result in Proposition 3 always holds, even when equilibrium
20:675:44924:19:19:72:540:501:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:allocations are not constrained efficient, this misallocation of equity ownership is not a conse-
20:676:45021:19:19:72:540:482:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:quence of lack of unanimity, as it might instead be the case in equilibrium concepts adopting
20:677:45114:19:18:72:540:463:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the Dreze or the Grossman-Hart criterion.  It is rather a consequence of the externality af-
20:678:45206:18:19:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:fecting firms’ incentive constraints, which may turn out to be more severe when some types
20:679:45296:19:47:72:320:426:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of agents are shareholders than when others are.
20:680:45344:47:30:72:371:379:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:C:4    Specialization and amplification
20:681:45381:30:19:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In  this  section  we  present  two  results  concerning  properties  of  equilibria  with  the  aim  of
20:682:45485:19:19:72:540:330:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:better illustrating some important aspects of equilibrium allocations.  While we present these
20:683:45579:19:19:72:540:311:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:results in the context of specific examples, it should be clear that the underlying economic
20:684:45671:19:40:72:419:292:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:phenomena we characterize represent robust equilibrium properties.
20:685:45737:40:26:72:312:252:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:4.1    Efficient firms’ specialization
20:686:45775:26:19:72:540:226:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In  Section  2.3  we  defined  for  simplicity  competitive  equilibria  for  the  case  where  firms’
20:687:45877:19:19:72:540:207:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:choices are symmetric, that is all firms choose the same production and financial plan, but
20:688:45968:19:18:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we also acknowledged that asymmetric equilibria may exist.  This is not just a technical issue,
20:689:46063:18:18:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:arising from the non concavity of the firms’ objective problem, but reflects a fundamental
20:690:46153:18:19:81:539:152:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:27Prescott and Townsend also assume that markets are complete, while we do not.  But whether markets
20:691:46253:19:16:72:540:133:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:are complete or not,  and hence whetherMRSi(ci(s)) are equalized or not acrossi,  is not crucial for the
20:692:46357:16:16:72:540:117:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:welfare result. What is crucial is that the agents’ marginal rates of substitution enter the incentive constraint,
20:693:46471:16:30:72:392:101:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:so that a change in the consumption allocation may relax this constraint.

21:695:46546:0:19:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:implication of the rationality of firms’ conjectures:  firms may have an incentive to specialize
21:696:46642:19:19:72:540:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:their  production  and  financial  plans  so  as  to  cater  to  the  different  demands  of  different
21:697:46745:19:19:72:540:670:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:consumers.  In this section we analyze an example where we illustrate the incentives of firms
21:698:46838:19:19:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to specialize, so as to offer consumers different risk profiles for the yields of their equity and
21:699:46936:19:18:72:415:632:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bonds, but also the possible costs which may hinder specialization.
21:700:47003:18:19:89:539:614:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Consider an environment with no agency frictions, two types of consumers, and a single
21:701:47089:19:19:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:type of firms.  Both consumers have the same initial equity holdings and first period endow-
21:702:47181:19:19:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ments, as well as identical preferences.  They only differ in their second period endowment
21:703:47272:19:18:72:539:557:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:w11(s) andw21(s).The production technology of each firm is as in (13), withφrepresenting
21:704:47360:18:19:72:539:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the loading on the two risk factorsa1(s),a2(s):f(k,φ;s) = [(1−φ)a1(s) +φa2(s)]kα.  Also,
21:705:47448:19:19:72:540:520:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f2:B:Ea1(s) =Ea2(s).Let us also ignore here, for simplicity, the firms’ financial choice, by setting
21:706:47543:19:19:72:297:501:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:B= 0, so thatRe(k,φ,m,B;s) =f(k,φ;s).
21:707:47580:19:19:89:539:482:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Under some symmetry conditions (spelled out in the Appendix), we obtain the following
21:708:47665:19:31:72:104:463:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:result:
21:709:47672:31:19:72:573:432:12:g_d0_f1:8:g_d0_f3:C:Proposition 4 (Specialization)Suppose the factorsa1(s)anda2(s)vary anti-comonotonically.28
21:710:47762:19:19:72:540:413:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:Then  ifw11(s)varies  comonotonically  with  one  factor  andw21(s)with  the  other  factor,  the
21:711:47859:19:19:71:540:394:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:equilibrium  displays  production  specialization:  a  fraction  of  firms  chooseφ= 0and  the  re-
21:712:47958:19:18:72:539:375:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:mainderφ= 1.  If instead bothw11(s)andw21(s)vary comonotonically with the same factor,
21:713:48044:18:32:71:414:357:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:the equilibrium is symmetric:  all firms choose the same value ofφ.
21:714:48111:32:19:89:539:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The incentives of firms to specialize their production plans are larger when the different
21:715:48201:19:19:71:539:306:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:factors in the firms’ production function are good hedges of the endowment risk of different
21:716:48293:19:19:71:539:287:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:types  of  agents.   In  this  case  specialization  more  easily  allows  to  satisfy  the  consumers’
21:717:48396:19:18:71:539:268:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:demand for risk.  At the same time, specialization also involves some cost since it reduces
21:718:48487:18:19:71:539:250:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the demand for each firm’s equity as this comes from only one type of consumer.  There is
21:719:48576:19:19:71:539:231:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:so a trade-off and when the differences in hedging properties of different factors for different
21:720:48672:19:19:71:450:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:agents are less clearly marked specialization does not arise in equilibrium.
21:721:48748:19:18:89:539:193:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To illustrate and provide some intuition for the result in the above proposition it is useful
21:722:48841:18:25:71:263:175:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to present the first steps of the proof.
21:723:48881:25:19:71:540:150:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f4:C:Proof of Proposition 4.Consider the following case:w11(s)is comonotonic witha1(s)and
21:724:48965:19:18:71:540:131:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f4:C:w21(s)witha2(s),  henceCov(w11(s),a2(s))<0andCov(w21(s),a1(s))<0.  In  this  situation
21:725:49051:18:0:81:428:113:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:28That is, for any pairs1,s2∈S,a1(s1)≥a1(s2) if and only ifa2(s1)≤a2(s2).
22:726:49126:0:19:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:factor 2 is a clearly a good hedge for type 1 agents while factor 1 is a good hedge for type 2
22:727:49220:19:19:72:330:689:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:agents and the claim is that specialization obtains.
22:728:49272:19:19:89:539:670:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:Suppose,  by  contradiction,  that  we  have  an  equilibrium  where  all  firms  choose  the  same

22:775:51188:19:19:72:540:159:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sumers for such plans.  When the profitability of all possible plans is assessed on the basis of
22:776:51284:19:19:72:540:140:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rational price conjectures as in condition M), firms do indeed this, taking into account which
22:777:51378:19:18:72:540:121:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:type of agent will hold the firms’ assets for each possible plan.  This implies, as we noticed,
22:778:51473:18:0:72:540:103:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a non convexity of the firm’s choice problem so that indeed specialization may emerge.  In
23:779:51565:0:19:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:contrast, with the Dreze or the Grossman-Hart criteria firms evaluate any (equilibrium and

23:781:51757:19:19:72:540:670:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:subset  of  agents.   As  a  consequence  the  firm’s  objective  function  is  linear  and  its  choice
23:782:51861:19:19:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:problem convex, equilibria will generally be symmetric and may turn out to be constrained
23:783:51950:19:18:72:124:632:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:inefficient.
23:784:51962:18:19:89:539:614:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To illustrate this point further we take up the well-known example studied by Dierker,
23:785:52048:19:19:72:539:595:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Dierker,  and Grodal (2002).  In  this  example,  uncertainty  is  represented  byS={s1,s2}.
23:786:52140:19:19:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:There are two types of consumers.  The technology of the representative firm is described

23:793:52720:18:19:72:539:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to the Dreze criterion, where all firms choose the same value ofkandφand such equilibrium
23:794:52809:19:19:72:540:426:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is constrained inefficient.29In contrast, a symmetric competitive equilibrium according to

23:797:53092:18:19:72:540:370:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:specification of agents’ preferences and endowments considered, type 1 consumers strongly

23:800:53353:19:40:72:481:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:specialization, a unique equilibrium exists, which is constrained Pareto optimal.

25:887:57097:18:19:71:539:327:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:there is now a second term,∂∂φMRSie(cie(s1))Re(k,φ,m,B;s1), which has a strictly positive
25:888:57186:19:19:71:540:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sign:  an increase inφin fact reduces the consumption of shareholders in states1, cie(s1),
25:889:57276:19:19:72:540:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and this in turn increases these agents’ marginal utility, as this is decreasing in consumption,
25:890:57372:19:18:72:540:270:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and alsoMRSie(cie(s1))33.  The overall expression in (26) may then have a strictly positive
25:891:57463:18:19:72:539:252:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sign, in which case an increase inφ(by all firms) is feasible, in the sense that it satisfies the
25:892:57560:19:19:71:540:233:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:incentive constraint (11).  In other words, by internalizing the effect ofφon the shareholders’
25:893:57655:19:18:71:540:214:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:consumption, a higher level ofφcan be supported, that is a value closer to the one obtained
25:894:57746:18:19:81:539:196:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:31It is straightforward to see that at the equilibrium allocation with no agency frictions the term on the
25:895:57852:19:16:72:540:177:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:left hand side of (25) is always negative.  Hence the incentive constraint (11) is violated, since shareholders
25:896:57963:16:15:72:540:161:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:would like to decreaseφ, that is, to increase the loading on (the riskier) factora1(s).  Thus we cannot have
25:897:58071:15:9:72:182:146:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:an interior solution forφ.
25:898:58097:9:20:81:539:137:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:32We limit our analysis here to a local argument, following on this the literature on economies with financial
25:899:58207:20:10:72:477:117:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:frictions, e.g., Gromb and Vayanos (2002), Krishnamurty (2000, 2010) and Lorenzoni (2005).

26:903:58393:19:19:89:539:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In the environment considered we can thus say that a competitive equilibrium with agency
26:904:58481:19:19:72:540:670:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:frictions displays excessive aggregate risk, asφis set at the level 0,with full loading on the
26:905:58575:19:19:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:riskier factor, while a higher level ofφ, with less loading on this factor, could be feasible and
26:906:58672:19:18:72:540:632:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:allow to reduce the aggregate risk in the economy.   By not taking into account the effects
26:907:58763:18:19:72:540:614:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of their choice ofφon the agents’ marginal rates of substitution, shareholders will tend to
26:908:58854:19:47:72:525:595:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:choose a too low level ofφ, increasing the amount of risk in the economy at equilibrium.

26:910:58976:30:19:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In this section we illustrate how equilibrium analysis may produce interesting implications
26:911:59067:19:19:72:540:499:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for important issues in corporate finance.  In the corporate finance literature it is typically
26:912:59162:19:19:72:540:480:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the case that the capital structure of firms is fully determined by its role in providing incen-
26:913:59258:19:18:72:540:461:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tives to shareholders or managers, often in partial equilibrium.  But in a general equilibrium
26:914:59352:18:19:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:framework, when financial markets are incomplete, the capital structure is generally deter-
26:915:59443:19:19:72:540:424:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mined  not  only  by  its  role  in  mitigating  the  agency  frictions,  but  also  by  the  consumers’
26:916:59547:19:19:72:540:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:willingness to pay for the different forms of the borrowing instruments issued by firms and
26:917:59638:19:18:72:540:386:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the different amounts issued of them.  We refer to these, respectively, as the supply and de-
26:918:59731:18:19:72:540:368:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mand forces in the determination of the capital structure.  This is important because demand
26:919:59823:19:19:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:forces link the capital structure to fundamental macroeconomic factors as the allocation of
26:920:59914:19:19:72:401:330:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:risk in the economy, asset prices and business cycle fluctuations.
26:921:59980:19:19:89:539:311:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The economy presented in Section 2, displaying production, incomplete financial markets,
26:922:60068:19:18:72:540:292:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:as well as agency frictions, is a natural environment where to study such demand and supply
26:923:60159:18:19:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effects in the determination of the firms’ capital structure.  Since the amount of equity is
26:924:60251:19:19:72:539:255:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:constant, as already noticed the capital structure is simply described by the levelBof bonds
26:925:60343:19:15:72:106:236:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:issued.

26:927:60463:20:15:72:540:201:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:which can then be distributed among agents with appropriate transfers at date 0 so as to generate a welfare

27:934:61014:19:30:72:231:606:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:characterization is of interest.35

27:936:61127:19:19:72:540:557:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:agency frictions, at a competitive equilibrium the firms’ capital structure is, at least partially,

27:939:61398:30:19:89:539:490:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:This result is easy to illustrate within a simple parametric example with two types of
27:940:61484:19:19:72:539:471:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:agents and a representative firm with a two-factor productivity shock technology as in (13).37
27:941:61578:19:19:72:540:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In Figure 1 we report the consumers’ holdings of equity and debt and their marginal valuation
27:942:61671:19:18:72:540:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for these assets at an allocation where all the conditions for a competitive equilibrium are
27:943:61763:18:19:72:540:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:satisfied except the one for the firm’s optimal debt level.  Debt is in fact taken as parametric,
27:944:61860:19:19:72:540:396:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by settingB=Bex, and we report the values of asset holdings and marginal valuations for
27:945:61947:19:19:72:539:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:different levels ofBex.We see that whenBex= 0 both consumers’ types hold equity while
27:946:62032:19:18:72:540:358:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:only type 1 consumers are bondholders since they have a higher marginal valuation for this
27:947:62122:18:19:72:540:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:asset than type 2 consumers.  The consumers’ marginal rates of substitution at this allocation
27:948:62216:19:19:72:540:321:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:determine then, as in condition M), the equity and bond price conjectures associated to any
27:949:62307:19:19:72:539:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:other  value  ofB.We  see  that  a  firm  could  increase  its  value  by  issuing  debt  and  thus
27:950:62406:19:19:72:540:283:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:B= 0 is not an equilibrium value.  AsBexis progressively increased it remains true that
27:951:62493:19:18:72:539:264:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f10:B:type 1 consumers have a higher marginal valuation for the bond until a specific level ofBex
27:952:62584:18:19:72:539:246:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is reached (.1828), at which all consumers have the same marginal valuation for the bond
27:953:62672:19:18:72:540:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(see the bottom right panel) and both types hold equity.  At this level the condition stated

29:972:64194:19:19:72:540:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:firms’ choice (ofBas well ask,φ) maximizes their market value.  In equilibrium the value
29:973:64282:19:19:72:540:670:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ofBis partially indeterminate in the sense that any value greater than.1828, provided debt

29:975:64415:19:18:89:539:632:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We now show how the demand and supply components contribute to determine the firms’
29:976:64498:18:19:72:540:614:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:financing decisions, by introducing an agency friction, of the delegated management type,
29:977:64587:19:19:72:539:595:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the above example.  As in Section 2.2.2, suppose thatφis not observable and is chosen
29:978:64675:19:19:72:539:576:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by an agent selected as the firm’s manager, who incurs then a utility costvi(φ), which may
29:979:64765:19:18:72:539:557:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:vary with the agent’s typei.We assume thatvi(0)> vi(1) for alli; that is, for all types of
29:980:64855:18:19:72:540:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:agents choosingφ= 0 entails a costlier effort.  It is then easy to verify that the equilibrium
29:981:64949:19:19:72:540:520:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:allocation obtained in the case without agency frictions is no longer feasible, as the incentive
29:982:65045:19:19:72:539:501:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:constraint (12) is violated, whatever the typeiof agent selected as manager.  We find that
29:983:65135:19:19:71:540:482:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in equilibrium the firm hires a type 2 agent as manager, increases its debt levelB, thereby
29:984:65226:19:18:71:539:463:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:making equity riskier, in line with the implications of the delegation agency problem, and
29:985:65316:18:19:71:539:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:loads all the incentive compensation of the manager on equity (no debt), to induce him to
29:986:65405:19:19:71:539:426:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:chooseφ= 0.38The equilibrium level of debtBis now uniquely determined at the level
29:987:65487:19:19:71:540:407:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:.216,greater than.1828 but nonetheless such that debt remains risk-free.  In this example,
29:988:65577:19:18:71:539:388:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:therefore, the firm’s capital structure is essentially determined by the supply, that is, is high
29:989:65674:18:19:71:539:370:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:enough to provide a manager compensated with equity with the right incentives to choose

29:994:66051:26:19:71:539:247:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:It  is  useful  to  illustrate  the  role  of  the  demand  and  supply  components  determining  the
29:995:66152:19:19:71:539:228:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:firms’  capital  structure  also  in  another  environment,  where  the  agency  friction  is  of  the
29:996:66254:19:19:71:539:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:asset substitution type, as in Section 2.2.1.  In this economy, in fact, the interaction between
29:997:66350:19:18:71:539:190:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:demand and supply in the determination of the capital structure appears even more evidently.

30:1009:67029:30:31:72:252:609:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:withδ1,δ2,ξpositive constants and

30:1011:67121:31:19:72:540:547:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Thus the endowment of type 2 consumers is perfectly (negatively) correlated with the upper
30:1012:67211:19:19:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tail of the shock affecting the second factor of the firms’ technology, while that of type 1’s
30:1013:67305:19:18:72:474:509:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:consumers is perfectly (negatively) correlated with the lower tail of this shock.
30:1014:67386:18:19:89:539:491:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f8:A:When the choice ofφis observable, for an open set of values of the parametersδ1,δ2,ξ
30:1015:67470:19:19:72:539:472:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and  of  the  consumers’  first  period  endowmentsw0,an  equilibrium  exists  where  all  firms
30:1016:67566:19:19:72:540:453:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:choose  a  full  loading  on  factora2(s),  that  is,φ=  0.   Furthermore,  at  equilibrium,  firms
30:1017:67665:19:18:72:539:434:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:issue an amount of risky debt - approximately - equal toB=kαEa2(s).40Type 2 consumers
30:1018:67750:18:19:72:540:416:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:choose  to  hold  equity  while  type  1  consumers  only  hold  debt.   The  return  on  equity  is
30:1019:67850:19:19:72:539:397:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:kαmax{a2(s)−Ea2(s); 0}, while the return on debt is min{1;a2(s)}/Ea2(s).  This shows
30:1020:67934:19:19:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that in this environment there is demand for risky debt as well as for equity of the firms
30:1021:68024:19:19:72:540:359:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:choosing the less risky factorφ= 0.  At the equilibrium the capital structure is determinate
30:1022:68116:19:18:72:540:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and the agents’ portfolio allocation is such that, indeed, both type of agents - approximately
30:1023:68210:18:19:72:251:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:- fully hedge their endowment risk.
30:1024:68245:19:19:89:540:303:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Consider instead the same economy with an agency friction:φis not observable and is
30:1025:68328:19:19:72:540:284:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:chosen by the firm’s shareholders to maximize the value of equity, as in Section 2.2.1.  The
30:1026:68420:19:18:72:540:265:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:firm’s capital structure is determined now not only by the consumers’ willingness to pay for
30:1027:68512:18:19:72:540:247:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the different levels of risk of debt and equity, but also by the need to enhance incentives in the
30:1028:68610:19:19:72:540:228:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:presence of asset substitution (the supply side).  It is easy to verify that at the equilibrium
30:1029:68705:19:19:72:540:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:allocation  without  agency  frictions  described  above  type  2  consumers,  who  are  the  firm’s
30:1030:68805:19:18:72:539:190:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:shareholders, prefer to choose factor loadingφ= 1 rather thanφ= 0, so as to profit from
30:1031:68892:18:13:81:394:172:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f12:F:39Moreover,Emax{a2(s)−Ea2(s); 0}<0<Emax{a1(s)−Ea1(s); 0}.
30:1032:68949:13:22:81:458:159:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:40In turn, the investment levelkis - also approximately - determined by the condition

31:1040:69165:19:19:72:135:689:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:is violated.42
31:1041:69179:19:19:89:539:670:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To be able to still implement the factor loading choiceφ= 0 a lower level of leverage is
31:1042:69267:19:19:71:539:651:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:needed (in line with the asset substitution problem).  This is clearly possible with43B=akα,
31:1043:69359:19:18:72:539:632:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:withasuch thata2(s),a1(s)≥afor alls, so that firms’ debt is risk-free.  In this case the
31:1044:69447:18:19:72:540:614:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:agents  holding  equity  would  not  be  even  approximately  fully  hedged  as  they  would  bear
31:1045:69545:19:19:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:both  the  upper  and  lower  tail  risk  of  their  factor  choice,  and  this  would  in  turn  induce
31:1046:69649:19:19:72:539:576:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:them  to  chooseφ=  0.   At  the  equilibrium  with  agency  frictions  we  expect  therefore  the
31:1047:69747:19:18:72:540:557:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:debt  level  to  be  in  the  intermediate  range  betweenakαandkαEa2(s),  and  hence  a  more
31:1048:69841:18:19:72:540:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:volatile consumption level for all agents than with no agency frictions.    In the environment
31:1049:69935:19:19:72:540:520:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:considered we then see that the firms’ leverage ratio and the riskiness of the debt issued are
31:1050:70029:19:19:72:540:501:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:determined jointly by the preference of consumers in favor of risky debt and by the need to
31:1051:70120:19:19:72:167:482:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:provide incentives.
31:1052:70139:19:18:89:539:463:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:A final comment is important, to better appreciate the role of market incompleteness in
31:1053:70226:18:19:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the determination of the capital structure.  Observe in fact that if (we extended the model
31:1054:70317:19:19:72:540:426:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:so that) a complete set of financial instruments were available to trade,  consumers would
31:1055:70407:19:19:72:540:407:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:be indifferent between firms issuing risk-free or risky debt.  The Modigliani Miller theorem
31:1056:70499:19:18:72:540:388:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:holds and the capital structure would then only be determined by the supply component, the
31:1057:70589:18:19:72:540:370:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:need to provide incentives.  In particular, in the economy considered above, when markets
31:1058:70678:19:19:72:540:351:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are  complete  settingB=  0  ensures  that  the  incentive  constraint  (11)  is  always  satisfied.
31:1059:70778:19:19:72:540:332:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Hence incentives can be provided to shareholders without any need to affect firms’ choices
31:1060:70868:19:19:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and the risk allocation among agents, the equilibrium is so fully Pareto efficient.  It is easy
31:1061:70963:19:18:72:540:294:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to see that this property holds in general for economies where the agency friction is of the
31:1062:71055:18:18:72:521:276:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:asset substitution type, as in Section 2.2.1, since this friction has no bite whenB= 0.44
31:1063:71144:18:23:81:157:258:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:41We have in fact
31:1064:71161:23:13:106:231:235:10:g_d0_f6:7:g_d0_f15:F:(w0+θ0(−k+pB+q)−q)γ

31:1067:71232:35:19:81:539:194:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:42Note that shareholders in this economy have an incentive to load the productivity shock on the riskier
31:1068:71336:19:10:72:332:175:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:factor, as in the case of the economy studied in Section 4.2.
31:1069:71397:10:13:81:539:165:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:43Note that the level ofkmay be different in this case, typically higher because of a precautionary motive.
31:1070:71504:13:19:81:539:152:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:44In contrast,  when the agency friction is of the delegated management type,  as in Section 2.2.2   (and
31:1071:71609:19:16:72:540:133:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:the example of Section 5.1), Pareto efficiency is not ensured when markets are complete, as the incentive
31:1072:71714:16:0:72:537:117:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:constraint (12) may still constrain not only the firms’ capital structure but also the equilibrium allocation.
32:1073:71826:0:31:72:359:708:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:C:6    Intermediation and short sales
32:1074:71861:31:19:72:540:677:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In  this  section  we  introduce  markets  for  derivatives  on  the  firms’  financial  assets.   This
32:1075:71964:19:19:72:540:658:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is important obviously because derivatives markets exist and we claim their modeling fits
32:1076:72053:19:18:72:540:639:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:naturally into our set-up with interesting implications for financial economics.  They are also
32:1077:72148:18:19:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a natural way to model short sales of the existing assets.  Indeed in this section we focus
32:1078:72239:19:19:72:540:602:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:our attention on the case where derivatives are simply given by short and long positions on
32:1079:72330:19:19:72:540:583:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the firms’ equity.45A short position on a firm’s equity is in fact, both conceptually and in
32:1080:72422:19:19:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the practice of financial markets, different from a simple negative holding of equity:  it is a
32:1081:72517:19:18:72:540:545:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:loan contract with a promise to repay an amount equal to the future value of equity.  To
32:1082:72605:18:19:72:540:527:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model short sales it is then natural to introduce financial intermediaries who can issue claims
32:1083:72700:19:19:72:344:508:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:corresponding to short positions on the firm’s equity.
32:1084:72754:19:19:89:539:489:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We assume that intermediation is subject to frictions, e.g.  default or transaction costs.
32:1085:72844:19:18:72:540:470:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This ensures that the notion of competitive equilibrium is well-defined, even if such frictions
32:1086:72939:18:19:72:447:452:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:are arbitrarily small (and hence short sales are ”essentially unlimited”).46
32:1087:73015:19:19:89:539:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Consider an environment where intermediaries bear no cost to issue derivative claims, but
32:1088:73104:19:19:71:539:414:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:face the possibility of default by consumers on the short positions they issue (e.g., on the loans
32:1089:73202:19:19:71:539:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:induced by the sale of such positions to consumers), this is the friction on intermediation.
32:1090:73294:19:18:71:539:376:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Assume for simplicity that i) the default rate on the short positions issued is exogenously
32:1091:73385:18:19:71:540:358:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:given and constant in every state, for all consumers;47ii) a solvency constraint is imposed
32:1092:73476:19:19:72:394:339:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on intermediaries’ portfolio, to ensure they are never insolvent.

32:1095:73734:18:19:81:539:283:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:45It should be clear that the analysis could be extended to short sales of the bond as well as other forms
32:1096:73840:19:10:72:246:264:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:of derivatives, at only a notational cost.
32:1097:73882:10:19:81:539:254:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:46The analysis of equilibria with intermediated short sales is also important from a theoretical standpoint.
32:1098:73990:19:15:72:540:235:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:It is evident from our analysis in the previous sections that the unlimited short sales paradigm adopted by

32:1102:74418:15:16:72:540:173:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:flows which, when traded as equity, change the asset span and hence the admissible trades of all consumers,
32:1103:74525:16:15:72:540:157:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:allocations  and  equilibrium  prices.   In  this  section  we  show  how  not  only  limited  but  also  ”essentially
32:1104:74643:15:10:72:504:142:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:unlimited” short sales can be consistently introduced in our competitive economy with production.
32:1105:74740:10:19:81:539:132:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:47In Appendix A we show how the analysis and results extend to the general case where default rates are

33:1108:74967:19:19:72:540:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the intermediary must hold an appropriate portfolio of claims, as a form of collateral, whose
33:1109:75060:19:19:72:540:670:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:yield can cover the shortfalls in its revenue from the intermediation activity due to consumers’
33:1110:75156:19:19:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:defaults.  The best hedge against the risk of consumers’ default on short positions on equity
33:1111:75249:19:18:72:540:632:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is clearly equity itself.  The intermediary’s solvency constraint then requires that it holds an

35:1199:79232:19:19:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:issues by intermediaries are backed by the claims issued by firms in two ways.  First,  the
35:1200:79323:19:18:72:540:632:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:yields of these derivatives are pegged to the yield of the claims issued by firms; second, the
35:1201:79417:18:19:72:540:614:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:intermediaries must hold some amount of these claims to back the derivatives issued.  Hence

35:1207:79951:19:19:71:539:501:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:up, long and short positions trade at the same price, i.e., the bid ask spread is zero.  The
35:1208:80043:19:19:71:539:482:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:inefficiency result in Allen and Gale (1991) then follows from the fact that firms maximize a
35:1209:80136:19:18:71:539:463:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:conjecture over their market value which ignores the effect of their decisions on the value of
35:1210:80230:18:19:71:539:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:intermediation.  In other words, a firm does not take into account the possible gains arising
35:1211:80323:19:19:71:539:426:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from the demand for short positions in the firm’s equity.  In contrast in our economy, when
35:1212:80414:19:19:71:539:407:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a firm makes its production and financial decisions the firm considers the value of its equity
35:1213:80508:19:18:71:539:388:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:not  only  for  the  consumers  but  also  for  the  intermediaries  who  use  equity  as  an  input  in
35:1214:80612:18:19:71:539:370:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the intermediation process.  The gains from trade due to intermediation are so taken into
35:1215:80701:19:19:71:159:351:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:account by firms.
35:1216:80718:19:19:89:539:332:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:It is also useful to contrast our findings with the inefficiency result in Pesendorfer (1995).
35:1217:80812:19:19:71:539:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Example  2  in  Pesendorfer  (1995)  shows  that  a  competitive  economy  where  financial  in-
35:1218:80908:19:18:71:539:294:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:termediaries can introduce complementary innovations in the market may get stuck at an
35:1219:80994:18:19:71:539:276:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:equilibrium  in  which  no  intermediary  innovates,  even  though  welfare  would   be  higher  if
35:1220:81093:19:19:71:540:257:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:all  innovations  were  traded  in  the  market.50The  source  of  the  inefficiency  arising  in  the
35:1221:81195:19:19:71:539:238:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:environment considered by Pesendorfer (1995) is analogous to the one of the result of Allen
35:1222:81286:19:19:71:539:219:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and Gale (1991) just discussed:  each intermediary is implicitly restricted not to trade with
35:1223:81379:19:18:71:539:200:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:other intermediaries.  Equivalently, equilibrium prices for non-traded innovations do not in-
35:1224:81472:18:19:71:539:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:clude their effect on the value of intermediation.  If instead prices for non-traded innovations
35:1225:81568:19:19:71:539:163:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:were specified so as to equal the maximum between the consumers’ and the intermediaries’
35:1226:81656:19:18:71:522:144:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:marginal valuation, as in (32) above, constrained efficiency would obtain at equilibrium.
35:1227:81745:18:20:81:539:126:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:50This finding is related to similar ones obtained in competitive equilibrium models with differentiated
35:1228:81849:20:0:72:290:106:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:goods; notably Hart (1980) and Makowski (1980).
36:1229:81898:0:19:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, we can provide the following simple characterization of the intermediation levels
36:1230:81988:19:32:72:275:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:at equilibrium, which follows from (29):
36:1231:82028:32:19:72:540:657:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f4:C:Proposition 6 (Intermediation)In the economy with financial intermediation and short
36:1232:82112:19:19:72:539:638:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:sales, at an equilibrium, either (i)q= (q+−q−)/δ > q+and intermediation is full (the whole
36:1233:82202:19:18:71:539:619:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:amount of outstanding equity is purchased by intermediaries) or (ii)q=q+and intermedi-
36:1234:82288:18:32:72:521:601:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:ation is partial (some if not all the amount of outstanding equity is held by consumers).
36:1235:82377:32:19:89:539:569:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:At an equilibrium where intermediation is full, equity sells at a premium over the long
36:1236:82464:19:19:72:540:550:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:positions  on  the  derivative  claim  issued  by  the  intermediary,  due  to  its  additional  value
36:1237:82566:19:18:72:540:531:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:as input in the intermediation technology.  Intermediaries in turn recoup the higher cost of
36:1238:82658:18:19:72:540:513:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:equity through a sufficiently high spreadq+−q−between the price of long and short positions
36:1239:82749:19:19:71:539:494:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on the derivative.  When on the contrary intermediation is partial, equity and long positions
36:1240:82842:19:19:71:539:475:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the derivative trade at the same price, intermediaries may not be active in equilibrium
36:1241:82932:19:46:71:466:456:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:and the bid ask spreadq+−q−is low (in particular, less or equal thanδq).51

36:1243:83022:31:19:71:539:379:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In this paper we have provided an equilibrium foundation to the study of corporate finance by

36:1246:83297:19:19:71:539:323:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:once firms are postulated to operate under rational conjectures, along the lines of Makowski
36:1247:83389:19:19:71:539:304:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(1983a,b),  equilibria  exist  and  have  natural  and  appealing  properties  (in  terms,  e.g.   of
36:1248:83490:19:19:71:193:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:welfare and unanimity).
36:1249:83513:19:18:89:539:266:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We  have  considered  various  classes  of  economies  and  examples  to  illustrate  how  the

36:1254:83914:18:19:71:539:173:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:concept and extending the analysis to dynamic economies,  e.g.,  Bewley economies,  as the
36:1255:84004:19:20:71:364:154:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ones typically considered in macroeconomics and finance.
36:1256:84060:20:13:81:497:134:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:51Interestingly, we see from (32) that the same two situations arise for equity price conjectures.

41:1363:91188:36:26:72:230:672:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:Proof of Proposition 1
41:1364:91210:26:19:72:540:646:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We only provide here an outline of the main steps.  Since the firms’ choice problem is non
41:1365:91300:19:19:72:540:627:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:convex, we allow for the possibility that firms undertake different production and financial
41:1366:91392:19:18:72:540:608:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:plans in equilibrium.  By Caratheodory’s Theorem, given the finite dimensionality of the sets
41:1367:91485:18:19:72:540:590:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:where these variables lie, it is enough to consider the case where firms make at most a finite

41:1369:91664:19:19:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:budget constraints (3)-(5) to allow for the possibility that they tradeNdifferent types of

41:1371:91842:19:18:71:539:514:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f8:B:allowed,  the consumers’ budget set is non empty,  compact and convex for allpn,qn-0,

41:1375:92171:19:18:89:539:439:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Let  us  turn  then  our  attention  to  the  firms’  problem  (16).   Whenever  the  first  order
41:1376:92269:18:19:72:539:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:approach is not satisfied and the mapφ(k,m,B;c(s)) is not single-valued and continuous, it
41:1377:92359:19:31:72:520:402:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is convenient to write the implementability constraint (10) in terms of the inverse map:
41:1378:92447:31:31:249:362:371:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:k,m,B∈φ−1(φ;c(s)).
41:1379:92465:31:18:72:540:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We also impose here the following regularity condition, requiring that the above inverse map
41:1380:92557:18:31:72:265:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:can be described by a set of functions

41:1383:92717:19:19:72:480:241:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is satisfied in natural environments, as for instance in the case of (11) and (12).
41:1384:92800:19:18:89:540:222:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Let us partition the setN≡{1,..,N}into equal-sized subsetsN(φ) for eachφ∈Φ.  The
