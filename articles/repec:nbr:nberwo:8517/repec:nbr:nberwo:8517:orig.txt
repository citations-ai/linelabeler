2:28:1446:41:21:108:538:554:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:We  consider  the  distribution  of  economic  activity  within  a  country  in  light  of  three  leading
2:29:1552:21:22:72:538:533:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:theories - increasing returns, random growth, and locational fundamentals. To do so, we examine the
2:30:1651:22:21:72:538:511:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:distribution of regional population in Japan from the Stone Age to the modern era. We also consider the
2:31:1754:21:21:72:538:490:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Allied bombing of Japanese cities in WWII as a shock to relative city sizes. Our results support a hybrid
2:32:1859:21:21:72:538:469:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:theory in which locational fundamentals establish the spatial pattern of relative regional densities, but
2:33:1964:21:22:72:538:448:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:increasing returns may help to determine the degree of spatial differentiation. One implication of these
2:34:2068:22:113:72:505:426:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:results is that even large temporary shocks to urban areas have no long-run impact on city size.

3:46:2506:16:30:72:165:656:197:Times:197:Times:I. Introduction 
3:47:2522:30:28:72:510:626:144:Times:144:Times: In the last decade, the field of economic geography has enjoyed a renaissance.1 The 
3:48:2606:28:27:72:526:598:144:Times:144:Times:central question in this literature is how to explain the distribution of economic activity across 
3:49:2705:27:28:72:525:571:144:Times:144:Times:space – across countries of the world, across regions within a country, and across cities. Three 
3:50:2802:28:28:72:538:543:144:Times:144:Times:principal theoretical approaches have emerged, which may be termed increasing returns; random 
3:51:2896:28:27:72:521:515:144:Times:144:Times:growth; and locational fundamentals. The increasing returns theories posit that advantages of 
3:52:2990:27:28:72:533:488:144:Times:144:Times:size may arise from knowledge spillovers, labor market pooling, or the advantages of proximity 
3:53:3085:28:27:72:523:460:144:Times:144:Times:for both suppliers and demanders in a world of costly trade. In this approach, a distribution of 
3:54:3182:27:28:72:537:433:144:Times:144:Times:city sizes may arise from technological characteristics of individual industries (Henderson 1974) 
3:55:3280:28:28:72:538:405:144:Times:144:Times:or from the tacit competition among locations for mobile factors of production (Krugman 1991). 
3:56:3375:28:27:72:538:377:144:Times:144:Times:The random growth theory (Simon 1955, Gabaix 1999) holds that a distribution of cities of quite 
3:57:3471:27:28:72:507:350:144:Times:144:Times:different sizes emerges from very simple stochastic processes. One large advantage of this 
3:58:3562:28:27:72:523:322:144:Times:144:Times:approach is that it is able to explain a key empirical regularity known as Zipf’s Law regarding 
3:59:3658:27:28:72:515:295:144:Times:144:Times:the distribution of city sizes that, to date, the increasing returns theories cannot explain. The 
3:60:3756:28:28:72:524:267:144:Times:144:Times:locational fundamentals theory (Krugman 1996) may be thought of as a variant of the random 
3:61:3847:28:27:72:485:239:144:Times:144:Times:growth theory. Instead of city growth itself being random, it is fundamental economic 
3:62:3933:27:28:72:530:212:144:Times:144:Times:characteristics of locations that are random. If we posit that these characteristics are distributed 
3:63:4034:28:27:72:534:184:144:Times:144:Times:according to the same process as in Gabaix (1999), then the locational fundamentals theory also 
3:64:4130:27:23:72:521:157:144:Times:144:Times:can account for Zipf’s Law. However, in contrast to the random growth theory, the locational 
3:65:4223:23:8:72:219:134:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
3:66:4271:8:18:72:532:126:65:Times:99:Times:1Paul Krugman has argued that the study of the spatial location of economic activity should assume a stature in the 
3:67:4387:18:11:72:534:108:99:Times:99:Times:profession equal to one of the flagship fields such as international trade [Paul R. Krugman 1995]. A new Journal of 
3:68:4503:11:12:72:512:97:99:Times:99:Times:Economic Geography has been founded. While demurring from some of Krugman’s strongest claims, J. Peter 
3:69:4606:12:11:72:538:85:99:Times:99:Times:Neary, writing a review article in the Journal of Economic Literature, declares “New economic geography has come 
3:70:4719:11:0:72:192:74:99:Times:99:Times:of age” [Neary 2001, p. 536]. 
4:71:4751:0:28:72:514:709:144:Times:144:Times:fundamentals story predicts that the size of specific locations should be robust even to large 
4:72:4846:28:28:72:166:681:144:Times:144:Times:temporary shocks.2 
4:73:4864:28:27:72:512:653:144:Times:144:Times: In this paper, we will examine these three theories empirically. A few key questions 
4:74:4949:27:28:72:534:626:144:Times:144:Times:emerge. How important are scale economies in explaining the degree of spatial concentration of 
4:75:5044:28:27:72:533:598:144:Times:144:Times:economic activity?3 The premise that we work from is that the forces of increasing returns must 
4:76:5140:27:28:72:541:571:144:Times:144:Times:be vastly stronger in a modern, knowledge-based economy than in more primitive, agricultural or 
4:77:5236:28:28:72:504:543:144:Times:144:Times:pre-agricultural, economies. To investigate this, we employ a unique data set on Japanese 
4:78:5326:28:27:72:527:515:144:Times:144:Times:regional population over the past 8,000 years. The answer that we provide has two parts. First, 
4:79:5422:27:28:72:535:488:144:Times:144:Times:for the 8,000 years in our data set, there has always been a great deal of variation in measures of 
4:80:5522:28:27:72:515:460:144:Times:144:Times:regional population density. This alone suggests that important factors other than increasing 
4:81:5616:27:28:72:538:433:144:Times:144:Times:returns help to explain the variation in the density of economic activity. Second, there has been a 
4:82:5716:28:28:72:523:405:144:Times:144:Times:notable rise in concentration in the last century as Japan industrialized and become ever more 
4:83:5811:28:27:72:538:377:144:Times:144:Times:integrated into the world economy. This suggests that the increasing returns theories may help to 
4:84:5909:27:28:72:238:350:144:Times:144:Times:account for the rise in dispersion.  
4:85:5946:28:27:72:495:322:144:Times:144:Times: The same data set can be employed to address a second key question. Over tens, 
4:86:6025:27:28:72:522:295:144:Times:144:Times:hundreds or thousands of years, how much persistence should we expect in the identity of the 
4:87:6118:28:28:72:533:267:144:Times:144:Times:most densely settled regions? The increasing returns theories do not answer with a single voice. 
4:88:6215:28:27:72:541:239:144:Times:144:Times:Insofar as the size distribution is tied to technological characteristics of particular industries, then 
4:89:6320:27:7:72:219:212:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
4:90:6368:7:16:72:519:205:42:Times:99:Times:2 It is tempting to say that one of the main things missing from the new economic geography is geography! This 
4:91:6479:16:12:72:520:189:99:Times:99:Times:would be a bit too strong, since Fujita and Mori (1996), for example have a very nice paper on the role of ports. 
4:92:6593:12:11:72:533:177:99:Times:99:Times:More typical, though, is a tendency to focus almost exclusively on factors with no real geographical counterpart, as 
4:93:6710:11:12:72:537:166:99:Times:99:Times:in the survey by Fujita and Thisse (1996): “The main reasons for the formation of economic clusters involving firms 
4:94:6826:12:11:72:488:154:99:Times:99:Times:and/or households are analyzed: (i) externalities under perfect competition; (ii) increasing returns under 
4:95:6933:11:7:72:405:143:99:Times:99:Times:monopolistic competition; and (iii) spatial competition under strategic interaction.” 
4:96:7018:7:16:72:540:136:42:Times:99:Times:3 Indeed, FKV have staked strong claims for the IR theories: “[T]he dramatic spatial unevenness of the real economy 
4:97:7134:16:12:72:537:120:99:Times:99:Times:– the disparities between densely populated manufacturing belts and thinly populated farm belts, between congested 
4:98:7249:12:11:72:497:108:99:Times:99:Times:cities and desolate rural areas; the spectacular concentration of particular industries in Silicon Valleys and 
4:99:7360:11:12:72:502:97:99:Times:99:Times:Hollywoods – is surely the result not of inherent differences among locations but of some set of cumulative 
4:100:7468:12:11:72:520:85:99:Times:99:Times:processes, necessarily involving some form of increasing returns, whereby geographic concentration can be self-
4:101:7579:11:0:72:177:74:99:Times:99:Times:reinforcing.” [FKV, p. 2]. 
5:102:7608:0:28:72:521:709:144:Times:144:Times:as we move from hunter-gatherer societies, to agriculture-based societies, through feudalism, 
5:103:7702:28:28:72:528:681:144:Times:144:Times:into and out of autarky, and finally to a modern industrial economy, one might guess that there 
5:104:7798:28:27:72:535:653:144:Times:144:Times:would be radical shifts over time in which are the densely populated regions. On the other hand, 
5:105:7895:27:28:72:484:626:144:Times:144:Times:an important strand within the increasing returns theories has stressed the role of path 
5:106:7984:28:27:72:537:598:144:Times:144:Times:dependence (David 2000, Krugman 1991b). An early start in one location provides that site with 
5:107:8079:27:28:72:517:571:144:Times:144:Times:advantages at each succeeding stage of locational competition. The random growth theory is 
5:108:8170:28:28:72:499:543:144:Times:144:Times:likewise consistent with correlation across long stretches of time in the spatial density of 
5:109:8263:28:27:72:527:515:144:Times:144:Times:particular locations so long as the variance of growth rates is not too large relative to the mean 
5:110:8362:27:28:72:509:488:144:Times:144:Times:growth rate. The clearest prediction comes from the locational fundamentals theory, which 
5:111:8452:28:27:72:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:would hold that many of the crucial characteristics for locations have changed little over time 
5:112:8548:27:28:72:521:433:144:Times:144:Times:even if the economic meaning may have evolved. For example, there are advantages of being 
5:113:8638:28:28:72:524:405:144:Times:144:Times:near a river, on the coast, on a plain instead of a mountain or desert, etc. Our empirical results 
5:114:8737:28:27:72:517:377:144:Times:144:Times:strongly confirm that there is a great deal of persistence across time in which are the densely 
5:115:8833:27:28:72:503:350:144:Times:144:Times:settled regions. For the increasing returns theory, this would stress the importance of path 
5:116:8926:28:27:72:522:322:144:Times:144:Times:dependence. For the random growth theory, this requires that the variance of growth have not 
5:117:9019:27:28:72:541:295:144:Times:144:Times:been too high. However, we believe that this persistence arises most naturally from the locational 
5:118:9118:28:28:72:516:267:144:Times:144:Times:fundamentals story and suggests this may be an important component of a complete answer. 
5:119:9207:28:27:72:525:239:144:Times:144:Times: Finally, the theories have quite distinct stories to tell about how the distribution of city 
5:120:9300:27:28:72:527:212:144:Times:144:Times:sizes will be affected by a powerful, but temporary, shock. The increasing returns literature, as 
5:121:9398:28:27:72:510:184:144:Times:144:Times:noted earlier, has given a prominent role to path dependence as well as to the possibility of 
5:122:9492:27:0:72:501:157:144:Times:144:Times:catastrophes in which even small shocks may give rise to large and irreversible structural 
6:123:9585:0:28:72:527:709:144:Times:144:Times:changes in relative city sizes.4 By looking at a large shock, one can gauge how important these 
6:124:9681:28:28:72:527:681:144:Times:144:Times:theoretical possibilities of catastrophic spatial change are in practice. The pure random growth 
6:125:9778:28:27:72:508:653:144:Times:144:Times:theory predicts that growth follows a random walk. All shocks have permanent effects. By 
6:126:9867:27:28:72:527:626:144:Times:144:Times:contrast, the locational fundamentals story holds that so long as the shock is purely temporary, 
6:127:9964:28:27:72:510:598:144:Times:144:Times:even strong shocks should shortly be reversed, as the advantages of the particular locations 
6:128:10057:27:28:72:437:571:144:Times:144:Times:reassert themselves in relatively rapid growth rates on the path to recovery.  
6:129:10136:28:28:108:511:543:144:Times:144:Times:The particular experiment that we consider is the Allied bombing of Japanese cities 
6:130:10220:28:27:72:539:515:144:Times:144:Times:during World War II. This is one of the most powerful shocks to relative city sizes that the world 
6:131:10319:27:28:72:506:488:144:Times:144:Times:has ever experienced. We find that, in the wake of the destruction, there was an extremely 
6:132:10410:28:27:72:531:460:144:Times:144:Times:powerful recovery. Most cities returned to their relative position in the distribution of city sizes 
6:133:10511:27:28:72:502:433:144:Times:144:Times:within about fifteen years. This strikes most strongly at the random growth theory, which 
6:134:10601:28:28:72:505:405:144:Times:144:Times:predicts no reversion to the prior path. For the increasing returns theory, this suggests that 
6:135:10696:28:27:72:531:377:144:Times:144:Times:however appealing the theoretical possibility of spatial catastrophes, in practice the distribution 
6:136:10796:27:28:72:536:350:144:Times:144:Times:of city sizes seems to be highly robust to temporary shocks even of great magnitude. Finally, the 
6:137:10894:28:27:72:501:322:144:Times:144:Times:reversion to the prior growth path would seem to be a strong confirmation of a locational 
6:138:10984:27:28:72:179:295:144:Times:144:Times:fundamentals theory.  
6:139:11006:28:28:72:533:267:144:Times:144:Times: In sum, our experiments are very problematic for the pure random growth theory. While 
6:140:11092:28:27:72:540:239:144:Times:144:Times:this theory provides a foundation for understanding Zipf’s Law, it fails utterly to predict the great 
6:141:11194:27:28:72:531:212:144:Times:144:Times:robustness of particular locations to strong temporary shocks. For the increasing returns theory, 
6:142:11292:28:27:72:537:184:144:Times:144:Times:the message is more nuanced. There has long been a great deal of spatial dispersion of economic 
6:143:11388:27:28:72:522:157:144:Times:144:Times:activity, so increasing returns is not necessary to explain this. Nonetheless, in the last century 
6:144:11487:28:20:72:504:129:144:Times:144:Times:there has been a substantial rise in the degree of spatial dispersion, and this well might be 
6:145:11581:20:8:72:219:109:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
6:146:11629:8:16:72:538:101:42:Times:99:Times:4 For example, Krugman (1998) writes: “The new work is highly suggestive, particularly in indicating how historical 
6:147:11745:16:11:72:493:85:99:Times:99:Times:accident can shape economic geography, and how gradual changes in underlying parameters can produce 
6:148:11845:11:0:72:242:74:99:Times:99:Times:discontinuous change in spatial structure.” 
7:149:11890:0:28:72:534:709:144:Times:144:Times:accounted for by increasing returns. The emphasis within the increasing returns literature on the 
7:150:11988:28:28:72:529:681:144:Times:144:Times:possibility of spatial catastrophes in the distribution of city sizes seems to be of greater interest 
7:151:12090:28:27:72:535:653:144:Times:144:Times:theoretically than empirically. Finally, the locational fundamentals theory fares quite well in our 
7:152:12190:27:28:72:538:626:144:Times:144:Times:empirical investigations. It has an advantage over the increasing returns theory in that it provides 
7:153:12291:28:27:72:515:598:144:Times:144:Times:a simple account of Zipf’s Law. It can provide a consistent story about why there has been a 
7:154:12384:27:28:72:526:571:144:Times:144:Times:great deal of spatial dispersion over long stretches of time. It can explain why there has been a 
7:155:12482:28:28:72:509:543:144:Times:144:Times:great deal of persistence in which regions are most densely settled. And it can explain why 
7:156:12574:28:27:72:506:515:144:Times:144:Times:specific locations are highly robust even to temporary shocks of great magnitude. The one 
7:157:12664:27:28:72:523:488:144:Times:144:Times:weakness is that it does not provide a reason why the degree of concentration in Japan should 
7:158:12758:28:27:72:237:460:144:Times:144:Times:have increased in the last century. 
7:159:12794:27:28:72:531:433:144:Times:144:Times: These considerations lead us to believe that the most promising direction for research is 
7:160:12884:28:28:72:529:405:144:Times:144:Times:to consider a hybrid theory in which locational fundamentals play a key role in establishing the 
7:161:12981:28:27:72:531:377:144:Times:144:Times:basic pattern of relative regional densities and in which increasing returns plays a strong role in 
7:162:13081:27:28:72:272:350:144:Times:144:Times:determining the degree of concentration.

7:165:13178:30:27:72:137:262:144:Times:144:Times:A. The Data 
7:166:13190:27:28:108:526:235:144:Times:144:Times:In this section, we examine 8,000 years of data on Japanese regions in order to address 
7:167:13278:28:27:72:538:207:144:Times:144:Times:key questions concerning variation and persistence of regional population densities. Historically, 
7:168:13377:27:28:72:532:180:144:Times:144:Times:how large has the variation in regional population density been and are there important changes 
7:169:13473:28:27:72:537:152:144:Times:144:Times:over time? And how persistent is the identity of the regions that have been most densely settled? 
7:170:13571:27:0:72:405:125:144:Times:144:Times:We then discuss the results in light of the three theories noted above. 
8:171:13645:0:28:108:507:709:144:Times:144:Times:The data that we bring to bear is of two main types.5 As we move back in time two 
8:172:13727:28:28:72:513:681:144:Times:144:Times:millennia and more, one has access neither to regional accounts nor to population censuses. 
8:173:13819:28:27:72:542:653:144:Times:144:Times:However, Koyama (1978) provides detailed data on the number of archaeological sites, including 
8:174:13914:27:28:72:534:626:144:Times:144:Times:28,013 from the Jomon period (-6,000 to –300) and another 10,530 sites from the Yayoi period  
8:175:14008:28:27:72:539:598:144:Times:144:Times:(-300 to 300). These have been divided according to the 46 modern prefectures in which they are 
8:176:14104:27:28:72:541:571:144:Times:144:Times:located. We take a count of these archaeological sites for the respective periods as a proxy for the 
8:177:14205:28:28:72:292:543:144:Times:144:Times:level of economic activity in the prefectures.  
8:178:14253:28:27:108:514:515:144:Times:144:Times:The second type of data is population. In order to provide a basis for taxation, Japan 
8:179:14340:27:28:72:504:488:144:Times:144:Times:began censuses of population quite early. This was done at a regional level because of the 
8:180:14431:28:27:72:493:460:144:Times:144:Times:substantial autonomy of local lords. Kito (1996) provides the best estimates of regional 
8:181:14520:27:28:72:529:433:144:Times:144:Times:population for 68 provinces (kuni) for the period beginning in 725 and ending in 1872. In 1920 
8:182:14615:28:28:72:536:405:144:Times:144:Times:regional censuses began using a system based on 46 prefectures (ken), and this system continues 
8:183:14711:28:27:72:525:377:144:Times:144:Times:through our most recent data for the year 1998.6 Often we will find it convenient to work with 
8:184:14806:27:28:72:526:350:144:Times:144:Times:data that allows a comparison across all of these periods of time. A quite close match between 
8:185:14901:28:27:72:517:322:144:Times:144:Times:the data sets can be achieved when we aggregate up to 39 regions. Kito (1996) also provides 
8:186:14993:27:28:72:418:295:144:Times:144:Times:estimates of total population of Japan for the Jomon and Yayoi periods. 
8:187:15065:28:28:108:519:267:144:Times:144:Times:We need to discuss the unit of analysis. A great deal of work on economic geography 
8:188:15149:28:27:72:539:239:144:Times:144:Times:considers cities rather than regions as the unit of analysis. We do have data on cities, and we will 
8:189:15250:27:28:72:541:212:144:Times:144:Times:discuss it, but this data extends back only to 1925. All of our earlier data concerns regions, which 
8:190:15351:28:27:72:536:184:144:Times:144:Times:thus must be the unit of analysis. There are, nonetheless, good reasons why one might prefer the 
8:191:15448:27:28:72:517:157:144:Times:144:Times:regional data. The first is that since the definition of a city always involves a threshold, even 
8:192:15546:28:32:72:487:129:144:Times:144:Times:purely uniform growth of population in all locations may appear non-uniform because 
8:193:15630:32:7:72:219:97:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
8:194:15678:7:12:72:308:90:42:Times:99:Times:5 Details on data construction are discussed in Appendix I. 
8:195:15738:12:0:72:463:78:42:Times:99:Times:6 The move to prefectures occurred earlier, but the 1920 census is the first to use these categories. 
9:196:15842:0:28:72:523:709:144:Times:144:Times:populations may cross the threshold in some locations but not others. A second reason is that, 
9:197:15937:28:28:72:533:681:144:Times:144:Times:especially over long stretches of time, the appropriate definition of cities changes. For example, 
9:198:16036:28:27:72:532:653:144:Times:144:Times:areas that are considered core parts of modern Tokyo would not have been thought of as part of 
9:199:16131:27:28:72:540:626:144:Times:144:Times:historical Tokyo (Edo). It is not at all clear how one should or could deal with such issues. Third, 
9:200:16232:28:27:72:516:598:144:Times:144:Times:for some of our early periods, virtually all of the population lived outside of anything that in 
9:201:16329:27:28:72:539:571:144:Times:144:Times:modern terms would be thought of as a city. Taken together, these factors suggest that the turn to 
9:202:16428:28:28:72:384:543:144:Times:144:Times:regional data may be a necessity, but it is one with many virtues. 
9:203:16495:28:27:108:490:515:144:Times:144:Times:By focusing on regional data, one transformation becomes absolutely essential. 
9:204:16574:27:28:72:508:488:144:Times:144:Times:Differences in region sizes are large and the demarcation between regions does not always 
9:205:16664:28:27:72:508:460:144:Times:144:Times:correspond to an obvious economic rationale. This suggests that we work not with the raw 
9:206:16753:27:28:72:532:433:144:Times:144:Times:regional population, but instead with the population deflated by the regional area. This measure 
9:207:16850:28:28:72:491:405:144:Times:144:Times:of regional population density will be the unit of analysis for this portion of our study.7 
9:208:16941:28:27:108:528:377:144:Times:144:Times:One of the key reasons for turning to the historical data is that economies of the remote 
9:209:17031:27:28:72:514:350:144:Times:144:Times:past look quite different from the modern economy. By examining such data, we are able to 
9:210:17121:28:27:72:540:322:144:Times:144:Times:abstract from forces that we think are important today, but much less so in earlier times. Hence it 
9:211:17221:27:28:72:527:295:144:Times:144:Times:is also important to have in mind the principal features of the earlier economies (as outlined in 
9:212:17319:28:28:72:533:267:144:Times:144:Times:Table 1). Our earliest data on archaeological sites of the Jomon period (-6,000 to –300) takes us 
9:213:17417:28:27:72:538:239:144:Times:144:Times:back to the Stone Age. The economy is based on hunting and gathering. There are no metal tools 
9:214:17512:27:28:72:496:212:144:Times:144:Times:or agriculture, although there is evidence of pottery. The Yayoi period (-300 to 300) is a 
9:215:17603:28:27:72:535:184:144:Times:144:Times:revolutionary time, with the introduction of primitive forms of agriculture, metallurgy and some 
9:216:17700:27:28:72:538:157:144:Times:144:Times:coins. As yet, there is neither writing nor cloth. Our next stop in history is the year 725. A feudal 
9:217:17802:28:28:72:538:129:144:Times:144:Times:regime had risen and we have the first population census. Writing is well developed and farming 
9:218:17898:28:15:72:502:101:144:Times:144:Times:is widespread. The capital is in Nara. By 800, the capital has moved to Kyoto and greater 
9:219:17988:15:8:72:219:86:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
9:220:18036:8:0:72:491:78:42:Times:99:Times:7 Rappaport and Sachs (2001) also focus on regional population densities in the U.S. for similar reasons. 
10:221:18144:0:28:72:514:709:144:Times:144:Times:protection of peasant property rights has encouraged more widespread cultivation. The next 
10:222:18235:28:28:72:512:681:144:Times:144:Times:century would see more extensive usage of metal farm tools, raising productivity. By 1150, 
10:223:18326:28:27:72:479:653:144:Times:144:Times:Japan was racked by instability and civil war, particularly in the North. By 1600, the 
10:224:18413:27:28:72:542:626:144:Times:144:Times:reunification of Japan was complete and there is extensive trade and contact with the West. Japan 
10:225:18511:28:27:72:531:598:144:Times:144:Times:is a major regional power. By the 1630s, however, Japan began more than two centuries of self-
10:226:18605:27:28:72:539:571:144:Times:144:Times:imposed isolation. By 1721, the capital moved to Tokyo and population movement became more 
10:227:18696:28:28:72:531:543:144:Times:144:Times:restricted. Even as late as 1798, fully 80 percent of the population was farmers, about 6 percent 
10:228:18794:28:27:72:530:515:144:Times:144:Times:nobility, with the remainder merchants and artisans. By the 1870s, Japan witnessed a civil war, 
10:229:18890:27:28:72:508:488:144:Times:144:Times:the end of the Shogun’s government, a jump from autarky to free trade, and the subsidized 
10:230:18980:28:27:72:510:460:144:Times:144:Times:import of Western technology. This can be thought of as the very start of Japan’s industrial 
10:231:19073:27:28:72:539:433:144:Times:144:Times:revolution. By the 1920s, industrialization and the accompanying militarization are in full swing. 
10:232:19172:28:28:72:538:405:144:Times:144:Times:Japan is a major exporter of silk and textiles. Nonetheless, approximately 50 percent of the work 
10:233:19270:28:27:72:526:377:144:Times:144:Times:force is still composed of farmers. By 1998, of course, Japan is a highly industrialized society, 
10:234:19368:27:28:72:537:350:144:Times:144:Times:with farmers now comprising only 5 percent of the population. Tokyo is one of the world’s great 
10:235:19464:28:27:72:528:322:144:Times:144:Times:cities with a population of 12 million. In sum, our data covers Japan from the Stone Age to the 
10:236:19560:27:28:72:132:295:144:Times:144:Times:modern era. 
10:237:19572:28:28:108:111:267:144:Times:144:Times: 
10:238:19572:28:27:72:323:239:144:Times:144:Times:B. Population and Variation in Regional Density 
10:239:19620:27:28:108:536:212:144:Times:144:Times:We begin by examining the evolution of the total population of Japan. The main features 
10:240:19708:28:27:72:541:184:144:Times:144:Times:are developed in Table 1. Kito (1996) estimates that the population in Jomon period Japan would 
10:241:19804:27:28:72:523:157:144:Times:144:Times:have been approximately 125,000; by 1998, it would fall just shy of 120 million. In short, our 
10:242:19899:28:28:72:541:129:144:Times:144:Times:data encompasses a period in which Japanese population rises by a factor of nearly one thousand. 
10:243:19996:28:0:72:509:101:144:Times:144:Times:If we restrict attention to the period for which we have censuses, i.e. from 725 to 1998, the 
11:244:20092:0:28:72:530:709:144:Times:144:Times:population rises from 4.5 million to nearly 120 million. That is, our census data encompasses a 
11:245:20188:28:28:72:513:681:144:Times:144:Times:period in which total Japanese population rises by a factor greater than 25. From the Jomon 
11:246:20280:28:27:72:526:653:144:Times:144:Times:period through about 1721, the broad trend is substantial population growth. In large measure, 
11:247:20375:27:28:72:491:626:144:Times:144:Times:this reflects the development of agriculture and its implements, extension of regions of 
11:248:20464:28:27:72:521:598:144:Times:144:Times:cultivation, and establishment of institutions that encouraged investments in the land. For the 
11:249:20560:27:28:72:515:571:144:Times:144:Times:next century and a half, through the 1870s, there is very little population growth. In the next 
11:250:20656:28:28:72:526:543:144:Times:144:Times:hundred and twenty years, through 1998, Japanese population would double twice over, rising 
11:251:20748:28:27:72:187:515:144:Times:144:Times:from 30 to 120 million. 
11:252:20772:27:28:108:524:488:144:Times:144:Times:There are several measures one can give of variation in regional population density. A 
11:253:20859:28:27:72:498:460:144:Times:144:Times:very coarse but simple measure is the share of population accounted for by the five most 
11:254:20948:27:28:72:523:433:144:Times:144:Times:populous regions. This concentration was quite high, at 39 percent, in the Jomon period. This 
11:255:21042:28:28:72:517:405:144:Times:144:Times:appears to reflect the fact that without agriculture, metal tools, or clothing, major sections of 
11:256:21140:28:27:72:520:377:144:Times:144:Times:Japan were virtually uninhabitable. From here through the dawn of the twentieth century, the 
11:257:21233:27:28:72:533:350:144:Times:144:Times:share of the five largest regions typically hovered around 20 percent, occasionally rising toward 
11:258:21331:28:27:72:536:322:144:Times:144:Times:30 percent. Remarkably, by the end of the twentieth century, the share of the five most populous 
11:259:21428:27:28:72:251:295:144:Times:144:Times:regions would rise above 40 percent. 
11:260:21465:28:28:108:525:267:144:Times:144:Times:A second measure of regional variation is what may be termed the relative variance of 
11:261:21551:28:27:72:541:239:144:Times:144:Times:log population density, which measures variance in proportional terms. To get this, first take logs 
11:262:21651:27:28:72:535:212:144:Times:144:Times:of the regional population densities. For each period, this allows us to compute a variance of the 
11:263:21750:28:27:72:540:184:144:Times:144:Times:log population densities. If we now normalize this by the same measure of variation for 1998, we 
11:264:21847:27:28:72:539:157:144:Times:144:Times:get a measure that is above unity if the variation is greater in the historical period than in modern 
11:265:21949:28:31:72:283:129:144:Times:144:Times:Japan and below unity in the reverse case. 8 
11:266:21993:31:8:72:219:98:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
11:267:22041:8:16:72:512:90:42:Times:99:Times:8 An advantage of using this measure over simply using the variance in population density is that the former is 
11:268:22153:16:0:72:536:74:99:Times:99:Times:invariant to average density while the latter tends to rise with it.  The reason for this is that as population, and hence 
12:269:22278:0:28:108:513:709:144:Times:144:Times:A first observation is that regional population variation is substantially higher in the 
12:270:22367:28:28:72:520:681:144:Times:144:Times:modern period than at all prior dates except the Jomon and Yayoi periods. Again, one reason 
12:271:22459:28:27:72:534:653:144:Times:144:Times:there is so much variation in the Jomon and Yayoi periods is simply that the economies were so 
12:272:22554:27:28:72:542:626:144:Times:144:Times:primitive that major sections of Japan were almost uninhabitable. A second observation is that all 
12:273:22653:28:27:72:534:598:144:Times:144:Times:of the censuses from 700 to 1600 show a great deal of variation in regional population density – 
12:274:22749:27:28:72:519:571:144:Times:144:Times:typically two-thirds to three-fourths of the modern variation. Indeed an F-test reveals that we 
12:275:22845:28:28:72:540:543:144:Times:144:Times:cannot reject the hypothesis that variance in regional population density in any year prior to 1721 
12:276:22945:28:27:72:529:515:144:Times:144:Times:was the same as the modern variance (at the 5 percent level).  Interestingly, the data from 1721 
12:277:23042:27:28:72:508:488:144:Times:144:Times:through 1872 show, the closure of Japan seems to have been accompanied by a substantial 
12:278:23130:28:27:72:513:460:144:Times:144:Times:reduction in regional population variation. A plausible reason is that eight out of the twelve 
12:279:23225:27:28:72:536:433:144:Times:144:Times:densest regions in 1600 comprised port cities whose share of population declined markedly over 
12:280:23320:28:28:72:532:405:144:Times:144:Times:this time period.9  Closure to trade probably dramatically reduced the value of locating in a port 
12:281:23419:28:27:72:528:377:144:Times:144:Times:relative to remaining in farming.10 Finally, the re-opening of Japan and the development of the 
12:282:23515:27:28:72:528:350:144:Times:144:Times:modern economy gave rise to a substantial increase in regional variation in population density. 
12:283:23611:28:27:108:542:322:144:Times:144:Times:We can also examine a third measure of variation in regional density, the Zipf coefficient. 
12:284:23703:27:28:72:512:295:144:Times:144:Times:We have already noted, in reference to the random growth theory, that there is an empirical 
12:285:23795:28:28:72:531:267:144:Times:144:Times:regularity known as Zipf’s Law for Cities. To understand this, rank the cities by population and 
12:286:23892:28:27:72:539:239:144:Times:144:Times:now take logs of both the rank of the city and of its population. Zipf’s Law for Cities holds that a 
12:287:23993:27:28:72:539:212:144:Times:144:Times:regression of the log rank against log population will have a slope of minus unity. Gabaix (1999) 
12:288:24091:28:27:72:535:184:144:Times:144:Times:reports a slope of –1.004 for the United States and Rosen and Resnick (1980) report slopes for a 
12:289:24188:27:25:72:459:157:144:Times:144:Times:variety of OECD countries, many of which are reasonably close to minus unity.  
12:290:24267:25:12:72:543:132:144:Times:144:Times:                                                                                                                                                             
12:291:24423:12:12:72:516:120:99:Times:99:Times:average density, rises, the same proportional density differences produce higher absolute variations in density.  
12:292:24537:12:7:72:503:108:99:Times:99:Times:Since we wanted to sweep this effect out of the data, we calculate variance based on log population density. 
12:293:24646:7:11:72:430:101:42:Times:99:Times:9 These were Chiba, Fukuoka, Kobe, Nagoya, Osaka, Tokyo, Yokkaichi, and Yokohama. 
12:294:24728:11:16:72:514:90:42:Times:99:Times:10 Other policies may also have affected city sizes such as the construction of castle-towns, tax evasion in rural 
12:295:24843:16:0:72:451:74:99:Times:99:Times:areas, and declining finances for samurai [See Hall (1968) and Hanley and Yamamura (1977)] 
13:296:24936:0:28:108:541:709:144:Times:144:Times:In this context, the magnitude of the Zipf coefficient provides information about variation 
13:297:25028:28:28:72:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:in regional density. If there were only trivial variation in regional population density, then the 
13:298:25127:28:27:72:531:653:144:Times:144:Times:Zipf slope would be close to minus infinity. If virtually all of the population were clustered in a 
13:299:25227:27:28:72:537:626:144:Times:144:Times:single region, the Zipf coefficient would be close to zero. Hence when the magnitude of the Zipf 
13:300:25324:28:27:72:536:598:144:Times:144:Times:coefficient is small, the variation is large. Here we will report Zipf coefficients computed not on 
13:301:25424:27:28:72:525:571:144:Times:144:Times:city populations but on regional population densities. As we will see, this transformation does 
13:302:25520:28:28:72:237:543:144:Times:144:Times:little to disturb the basic relation.  
13:303:25559:28:27:108:534:515:144:Times:144:Times:One should not directly run Zipf-style regressions on historical data since the population 
13:304:25650:27:28:72:537:488:144:Times:144:Times:data is surely measured with error.  In order to obtain unbiased estimates, we need an instrument 
13:305:25748:28:27:72:528:460:144:Times:144:Times:correlated with historical population data but not correlated with the measurement error in that 
13:306:25845:27:28:72:502:433:144:Times:144:Times:survey.  An obvious instrument that fits the need is modern population density, since it is 
13:307:25937:28:28:72:520:405:144:Times:144:Times:strongly correlated with historical density but not with historical census errors.  We therefore 
13:308:26034:28:27:72:529:377:144:Times:144:Times:used density in 1998 as an instrument for earlier census data.  We had a different problem with 
13:309:26130:27:28:72:538:350:144:Times:144:Times:the Jomon and Yayoi data.  Urban density in 1998 is not a good instrument, since archaeological 
13:310:26226:28:27:72:507:322:144:Times:144:Times:discoveries might be correlated with modern construction.  However, since most Japanese 
13:311:26314:27:28:72:533:295:144:Times:144:Times:archaeological discoveries of Jomon and Yayoi sites occurred since 1960 [see Koyama (1978)], 
13:312:26407:28:28:72:387:267:144:Times:144:Times:we used 1920 density data as an instrument for these regressions. 
13:313:26473:28:27:108:527:239:144:Times:144:Times:Table 1 reports the Zipf coefficient for each of our time periods. The broad story that it 
13:314:26564:27:28:72:535:212:144:Times:144:Times:tells confirms the results from the prior non-parametric statistics. Dispersion was relatively high 
13:315:26664:28:27:72:531:184:144:Times:144:Times:in the Jomon and Yayoi periods – indeed very close to fitting Zipf’s Law. Regional variation in 
13:316:26760:27:28:72:526:157:144:Times:144:Times:density declined modestly for the period 725 to 1600, before declining sharply in the period in 
13:317:26856:28:0:72:508:129:144:Times:144:Times:which Japan was closed to the West. Since Japan reopened and began its industrialization, 
14:318:26948:0:28:72:540:709:144:Times:144:Times:regional variation has increased substantially, reaching a Zipf coefficient of –0.96 in 1998. 11 The 
14:319:27049:28:28:72:532:681:144:Times:144:Times:coefficients are quite precisely estimated.  With the exception of the Jomon period, which has a 
14:320:27146:28:27:72:541:653:144:Times:144:Times:standard error of 0.22, our standard errors on the Zipf coefficient range from 0.03 in 1998 to 0.17 
14:321:27246:27:28:72:531:626:144:Times:144:Times:in the year 900.  We cannot statistically distinguish the modern coefficient from that in 1600 or 
14:322:27344:28:27:72:147:598:144:Times:144:Times:any prior date.  
14:323:27361:27:28:108:528:571:144:Times:144:Times:Our examination of 8,000 years of Japanese regional data reveals three important facts. 
14:324:27449:28:28:72:535:543:144:Times:144:Times:First, regional population densities have always varied greatly in Japan. This is true in the Stone 
14:325:27549:28:27:72:506:515:144:Times:144:Times:Age, at the dawn of the agricultural revolution, during the long period of feudalism, and it 
14:326:27642:27:28:72:517:488:144:Times:144:Times:remains true in modern industrial Japan. Indeed, with the exception of Stone Age Japan, our 
14:327:27734:28:27:72:506:460:144:Times:144:Times:spread of Zipf coefficients is well within the range of coefficients that one would find in a 
14:328:27828:27:28:72:520:433:144:Times:144:Times:sample of OECD countries [cf. Rosen and Resnick (1980)].12 Second, the closure of Japan to 
14:329:27919:28:28:72:536:405:144:Times:144:Times:trade for more than two centuries was accompanied by a substantial reduction in the variation of 
14:330:28016:28:27:72:512:377:144:Times:144:Times:regional population density. Large port-based regions appear to have lost ground relative to 
14:331:28109:27:28:72:529:350:144:Times:144:Times:regions directed more exclusively to national activity. Third, the industrial revolution in Japan, 
14:332:28208:28:27:72:523:322:144:Times:144:Times:coming hand in hand with its re-opening to international trade, does seem to have promoted a 
14:333:28301:27:28:72:496:295:144:Times:144:Times:very high degree of regional concentration and variation in regional population density.  
14:334:28391:28:28:108:111:267:144:Times:144:Times: 
14:335:28391:28:27:108:352:239:144:Times:144:Times:C. Persistence in Regional Population Densities 
14:336:28439:27:28:108:539:212:144:Times:144:Times:We now turn to consider persistence in the identity of the regions that are densely settled. 
14:337:28532:28:28:72:529:184:144:Times:144:Times:Table 1 reports both raw and rank correlations between the regional population densities in the 
14:338:28628:28:8:72:219:156:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
14:339:28676:8:16:72:537:148:42:Times:99:Times:11 On first blush, this might appear to conflict with the results of Eaton and Eckstein (1997) that showed the stability 
14:340:28797:16:11:72:531:132:99:Times:99:Times:of the Zipf coefficients for Japanese cities over the period 1925-1985. Here the difference between their use of city 
14:341:28914:11:12:72:537:121:99:Times:99:Times:data and our use of regional data is crucial, since this suggests that even if there is little change in the distribution of 
14:342:29039:12:11:72:504:109:99:Times:99:Times:city sizes, there may be important spatial correlation among cities that are growing, which could explain the 
14:343:29149:11:7:72:235:98:99:Times:99:Times:increased variation in regional densities. 
14:344:29192:7:17:72:530:91:42:Times:99:Times:12 Rosen and Resnick (1980) estimate the Zipf relationship for a broad set of countries using a comparable number 
14:345:29306:17:0:72:497:74:99:Times:99:Times:of observations.  Within the OECD countries in their sample, Zipf coefficients range from −0.88 to −1.96. 
15:346:29414:0:28:72:524:709:144:Times:144:Times:various periods with those for 1998. Consider first the Jomon data, dating from Japan’s Stone 
15:347:29508:28:28:72:530:681:144:Times:144:Times:Age (-6,000 to –300). The raw and rank correlations of the density of archaeological sites from 
15:348:29604:28:27:72:532:653:144:Times:144:Times:this period and 1998 regional population density are 0.53 and 0.31 respectively. The higher raw 
15:349:29700:27:28:72:528:626:144:Times:144:Times:correlation especially captures the fact that the most densely settled regions are common in the 
15:350:29797:28:27:72:505:598:144:Times:144:Times:two periods. The lower rank correlation captures the fact that large sections of Japan were 
15:351:29889:27:28:72:486:571:144:Times:144:Times:relatively untouched by the Jomon people and so the rankings among these are weak.  
15:352:29973:28:28:108:531:543:144:Times:144:Times:Consider next the Yayoi period (-300 to 300). Agriculture and metallurgy are just being 
15:353:30061:28:27:72:535:515:144:Times:144:Times:introduced. Writing has not yet appeared. In the next two millennia, total population will rise by 
15:354:30160:27:28:72:528:488:144:Times:144:Times:a factor of 200. If we know the distribution of the regional density of archaeological sites from 
15:355:30258:28:27:72:533:460:144:Times:144:Times:the Yayoi period, how much information would we expect this to provide about the distribution 
15:356:30352:27:28:72:504:433:144:Times:144:Times:of modern regional population densities? The raw and rank correlations are 0.67 and 0.50 
15:357:30441:28:28:72:495:405:144:Times:144:Times:respectively. Given that two millennia of Japanese history separate these dates, with the 
15:358:30531:28:27:72:526:377:144:Times:144:Times:accompanying economic transformations, we consider this persistence to be quite remarkable. 
15:359:30623:27:28:108:538:350:144:Times:144:Times:In moving to the year 725, we now are able to work with the first census data and ask the 
15:360:30713:28:27:72:531:322:144:Times:144:Times:same questions. A feudal regime is in place. The vast majority of the population is agricultural. 
15:361:30811:27:28:72:532:295:144:Times:144:Times:Nonetheless, the raw and rank correlations of regional population densities in 725 and 1998 are 
15:362:30907:28:28:72:419:267:144:Times:144:Times:0.60 and 0.71 respectively. Again, these show a remarkable persistence. 
15:363:30979:28:27:108:536:239:144:Times:144:Times:We will not discuss every date. Perhaps not surprisingly, there is a general trend that raw 
15:364:31071:27:28:72:523:212:144:Times:144:Times:and rank correlations with modern regional densities rise pretty steadily. We will cite just one 
15:365:31168:28:27:72:538:184:144:Times:144:Times:last date. If we look four centuries back to the year 1600, a time in which Japan had a population 
15:366:31267:27:28:72:518:157:144:Times:144:Times:just over 10 percent of its modern population, the raw and rank correlations with the modern 
15:367:31360:28:0:72:308:129:144:Times:144:Times:regional densities are 0.76 and 0.83 respectively. 
16:368:31413:0:28:108:508:709:144:Times:144:Times:In sum, it is absolutely striking how much persistence there is in the distribution of 
16:369:31500:28:28:72:503:681:144:Times:144:Times:regional population density throughout Japanese history. The high correlations trace back 
16:370:31590:28:27:72:514:653:144:Times:144:Times:virtually to the Stone Age. The correlations between modern regional densities and those of 
16:371:31682:27:28:72:528:626:144:Times:144:Times:Japan four centuries ago are remarkably strong. Persistence is a very strong feature of the data.

16:375:31898:28:27:72:526:515:144:Times:144:Times:reduces its population. Will this temporary shock have permanent effects? Or is there a strong 
16:376:31993:27:28:72:526:488:144:Times:144:Times:tendency for locations to be robust even to large temporary shocks so that this city will shortly 
16:377:32091:28:27:72:531:460:144:Times:144:Times:revert to its former place in the constellation of cities? An ideal experiment would have several 
16:378:32189:27:28:72:494:433:144:Times:144:Times:key features. The shocks would be large, highly variable, clearly identifiable and purely 
16:379:32279:28:28:72:533:405:144:Times:144:Times:temporary. In this section, we will consider the Allied bombing of Japanese cities during World 
16:380:32375:28:27:72:264:377:144:Times:144:Times:War II as precisely such an experiment.

16:382:32415:28:27:108:150:322:144:Times:144:Times:A. Data 
16:383:32423:27:28:108:498:295:144:Times:144:Times:Our data covers 303 Japanese cities with population in excess of 30,000 in 1925. 
16:384:32504:28:28:72:535:267:144:Times:144:Times:Population is recorded at five-year intervals between 1925 and 1965, with the exception that the 
16:385:32601:28:27:72:536:239:144:Times:144:Times:regular 1945 census is delayed until 1947 due to disruption from the war. These data allow us to 
16:386:32698:27:28:72:532:212:144:Times:144:Times:compute population growth rates for the pre-war period, 1925-1940; the period of the war itself 
16:387:32794:28:27:72:526:184:144:Times:144:Times:and its immediate aftermath, 1940-1947; and two measures of the recovery period, 1947-1960 
16:388:32885:27:28:72:161:157:144:Times:144:Times:and 1947-1965.13  
16:389:32903:28:28:108:541:129:144:Times:144:Times:One measure of the intensity of the shocks will be the dead and missing city residents due 
16:390:32994:28:15:72:528:101:144:Times:144:Times:to war actions. The missing are included because the magnitude of the shocks frequently made

16:392:33135:8:0:72:246:78:42:Times:99:Times:13 More detail is provided in the Appendix. 
17:393:33181:0:28:72:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:recovery of bodies impossible, as for example with those vaporized by the Hiroshima nuclear 
17:394:33273:28:28:72:500:681:144:Times:144:Times:blast. In order to have a measure of the intensity of the shocks, the dead and missing will 
17:395:33365:28:27:72:499:653:144:Times:144:Times:typically enter deflated by the number of city residents in 1940. A second measure of the 
17:396:33455:27:28:72:530:626:144:Times:144:Times:intensity of the shocks will be the number of buildings destroyed per resident. We also at times 
17:397:33552:28:27:72:515:598:144:Times:144:Times:report the percentage of the built up area destroyed for the 66 Japanese cities covered by the 
17:398:33647:27:28:72:272:571:144:Times:144:Times:United States Strategic Bombing Survey. 
17:399:33687:28:28:108:531:543:144:Times:144:Times:If we are to understand the impact of private actions that may lead cities to recover, it is 
17:400:33780:28:27:72:524:515:144:Times:144:Times:important to control for government actions. The Japan Statistical Yearbook provides data on 
17:401:33873:27:28:72:540:488:144:Times:144:Times:expenditures from US and Japanese government sources designated for the reconstruction of war 
17:402:33967:28:27:72:491:460:144:Times:144:Times:damage in each prefecture.  We allocate these among the cities within the prefecture in 
17:403:34055:27:28:72:506:433:144:Times:144:Times:proportion to the shares of buildings destroyed in that prefecture. These are divided by the 
17:404:34148:28:28:72:515:405:144:Times:144:Times:population in the city in 1947 to create our variable, “government reconstruction expenses,” 
17:405:34240:28:27:72:505:377:144:Times:144:Times:which is thousands of yen per capita spent by the government to reconstruct a city.  These 
17:406:34331:27:28:72:508:350:144:Times:144:Times:geographically-directed expenditures are quite small.  For example, most food aid, income 
17:407:34421:28:27:72:519:322:144:Times:144:Times:assistance, and industrial subsidy programs did not discriminate on the basis of location, and 
17:408:34516:27:28:72:516:295:144:Times:144:Times:therefore do not count as regional subsidies.  Interestingly, rural prefectures, which typically 
17:409:34613:28:28:72:525:267:144:Times:144:Times:sustained less war damage, received significantly more aid relative to the number of buildings 
17:410:34708:28:27:72:494:239:144:Times:144:Times:destroyed than more urban areas.  This was probably due to Japan’s long-term policy of 
17:411:34795:27:28:72:338:212:144:Times:144:Times:subsidizing rural districts at the expense of urban ones.

18:415:34883:0:28:108:514:709:144:Times:144:Times:The Allied strategic bombing in World War II devastated Japanese cities. It targeted 
18:416:34968:28:28:72:539:681:144:Times:144:Times:sixty-six cities. The bombing destroyed almost half of all structures in these cities – a total of 2.2 
18:417:35071:28:27:72:540:653:144:Times:144:Times:million buildings. Two-thirds of productive capacity vanished. Three hundred thousand Japanese 
18:418:35166:27:28:72:535:626:144:Times:144:Times:were killed. Forty percent of the population was rendered homeless. Some cities lost as much as 
18:419:35262:28:27:72:388:598:144:Times:144:Times:half of their population owing to deaths, missing, and refugees.14  
18:420:35330:27:28:108:529:571:144:Times:144:Times:The nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are, of course, well known. The first 
18:421:35415:28:28:72:515:543:144:Times:144:Times:atomic weapon was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and was the equivalent of 12 
18:422:35502:28:27:72:512:515:144:Times:144:Times:kilotons of TNT. The temperature at the blast site is believed to have surpassed one million 
18:423:35595:27:28:72:521:488:144:Times:144:Times:degrees Celsius. Over two-thirds of the built up area of the city was destroyed. The blast may 
18:424:35690:28:27:72:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:have killed as many as 80,000 people – more than 20 percent of Hiroshima’s population. The 
18:425:35781:27:28:72:536:433:144:Times:144:Times:second atomic weapon was dropped on Nagasaki on August 9 and had a power nearly twice that 
18:426:35872:28:28:72:541:405:144:Times:144:Times:of Hiroshima, at 22 kilotons. The hilly topography of Nagasaki and the fact that the bomb missed 
18:427:35969:28:27:72:534:377:144:Times:144:Times:its target by a wide margin kept the destruction of the built up area under 40 percent. Still, more 
18:428:36069:27:28:72:481:350:144:Times:144:Times:than 25,000 were killed or went missing, approximately 8.5 percent of city residents. 
18:429:36155:28:27:108:510:322:144:Times:144:Times:While the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki are widely known among the 
18:430:36234:27:28:72:541:295:144:Times:144:Times:public in the West, the devastation of other Japanese cities is much less well known. An example 
18:431:36331:28:28:72:531:267:144:Times:144:Times:of the magnitude of the destruction is a single firebombing raid on Tokyo the night of March 9, 
18:432:36427:28:27:72:533:239:144:Times:144:Times:1945. United States B-29 Superfortress bombers, based in the Marianas Islands, flew more than 
18:433:36521:27:28:72:526:212:144:Times:144:Times:300-strong over Tokyo that night. Under a new strategy devised by General Curtis LeMay, the 
18:434:36613:28:27:72:524:184:144:Times:144:Times:bombers flew with minimal defenses and at low altitudes. This allowed them to maximize the 
18:435:36704:27:28:72:530:157:144:Times:144:Times:payload of napalm incendiaries and to release these at precise intervals. Tokyo had received no 
18:436:36800:28:28:72:527:129:144:Times:144:Times:rain in a week and the wind that night blew at 25 miles per hour. Tokyo, a city of straw, paper, 
18:437:36897:28:15:72:532:101:144:Times:144:Times:and wood, lay in wait. The B-29 Superfortresses flew over Tokyo for just three hours on March 
18:438:36991:15:8:72:219:86:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
18:439:37039:8:0:72:245:78:42:Times:99:Times:14 These numbers are from USSBS (1947). 
19:440:37081:0:28:72:509:709:144:Times:144:Times:9, dropping 1.7 kilotons of napalm incendiaries. This unleashed a firestorm. Rivers boiled. 
19:441:37173:28:28:72:539:681:144:Times:144:Times:Asphalt streets liquefied and burst into flame. The results were devastating. Sixteen square miles 
19:442:37272:28:27:72:527:653:144:Times:144:Times:of Tokyo were reduced to ash. At least 80,000 people were killed in that raid alone (Werrell p. 
19:443:37368:27:28:72:113:626:144:Times:144:Times:162-3).  
19:444:37377:28:27:108:501:598:144:Times:144:Times:The magnitude of destruction in the March 9 raid on Tokyo was large not only by 
19:445:37457:27:28:72:533:571:144:Times:144:Times:Japanese standards; when it happened, it was the deadliest single-day air attack in the history of 
19:446:37556:28:28:72:506:543:144:Times:144:Times:the world. The number of people killed was of the same order of magnitude as the nuclear 
19:447:37645:28:27:72:511:515:144:Times:144:Times:bombing of Hiroshima. Japan suffered more civilian casualties in that one raid than Britain 
19:448:37737:27:28:72:528:488:144:Times:144:Times:suffered in all of World War II. And this was just the beginning. By the end of the war, the US 
19:449:37833:28:27:72:518:460:144:Times:144:Times:had destroyed more square miles of Tokyo than the combined destruction in the fifteen most 
19:450:37924:27:28:72:337:433:144:Times:144:Times:heavily bombed German cities [Werrell (1996) p. 32].  
19:451:37978:28:28:72:537:405:144:Times:144:Times: A major reason why Tokyo stands out in Japanese data is due to the fact that with a 1940 
19:452:38067:28:27:72:532:377:144:Times:144:Times:population of 7.3 million it was by far the largest target in Japan. Given that Tokyo was sixteen 
19:453:38165:27:28:72:509:350:144:Times:144:Times:times the size of Hiroshima and more than twenty times the size of Nagasaki, even nuclear 
19:454:38255:28:27:72:488:322:144:Times:144:Times:bombs could not kill as many people in these smaller cities. This suggests the value of 
19:455:38343:27:28:72:538:295:144:Times:144:Times:considering destruction in proportional rather than absolute terms. Seen this way, the destruction 
19:456:38442:28:28:72:527:267:144:Times:144:Times:in the course of the war of 56 square miles of Tokyo only amounted to 50.8 percent of its built 
19:457:38538:28:27:72:537:239:144:Times:144:Times:up area (USSBS p. 42). This is actually just under the median percentage of urban destruction of 
19:458:38635:27:28:72:538:212:144:Times:144:Times:50.9 percent for the 66 targeted cities. In short, in terms of the destruction of built up area for the 
19:459:38739:28:27:72:467:184:144:Times:144:Times:targeted cities, the devastation of Tokyo we described made it just a typical city.15 
19:460:38824:27:28:72:75:157:144:Times:144:Times: 
19:461:38824:28:20:72:75:129:144:Times:144:Times: 
19:462:38824:20:8:72:219:109:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
19:463:38872:8:16:72:524:101:42:Times:99:Times:15 The Allies dropped 17 pounds of incendiaries per capita on the median firebombed city, but only 4 pounds per 
19:464:38984:16:11:72:528:85:99:Times:99:Times:capita on Tokyo.  Tokyo nonetheless still stands out for the number who died. It seems likely that in smaller cities 
19:465:39101:11:0:72:291:74:99:Times:99:Times:there was greater opportunity to escape the firestorms. 
20:466:39159:0:27:72:207:708:144:Times:144:Times:C. Variance of the Shocks 
20:467:39185:27:28:72:530:681:144:Times:144:Times: While the magnitude of the shocks to city sizes was large, there was also a great deal of 
20:468:39275:28:27:72:516:653:144:Times:144:Times:variability in these shocks. In fact, approximately 80 percent of the 300 cities in our sample, 
20:469:39371:27:28:72:519:626:144:Times:144:Times:collectively representing 37 percent of the urban population, were virtually untouched by the 
20:470:39465:28:27:72:539:598:144:Times:144:Times:bombings. This includes large cities. Kyoto, the fifth largest city at the beginning of the war, was 
20:471:39566:27:28:72:527:571:144:Times:144:Times:not bombed at all.16 Given the city’s historical significance, it was believed that its destruction 
20:472:39666:28:28:72:531:543:144:Times:144:Times:might strengthen the Japanese will to resist. The large cities of Niigata and Kitakyushu escaped 
20:473:39763:28:27:72:532:515:144:Times:144:Times:substantial damage because they were preserved as potential nuclear bomb targets. Cities in the 
20:474:39859:27:28:72:538:488:144:Times:144:Times:North of Japan, such as Sapporo, escaped heavy bombing because they were largely out of range 
20:475:39953:28:27:72:181:460:144:Times:144:Times:of US bomber forces.  
20:476:39975:27:28:72:533:433:144:Times:144:Times: Even among those cities that did suffer firebombing, there is a high degree of variability 
20:477:40066:28:28:72:515:405:144:Times:144:Times:in the destruction. One reason is learning by doing. The creation of a firestorm from napalm 
20:478:40159:28:27:72:515:377:144:Times:144:Times:incendiaries depended on having a sufficient number of planes, dropping the incendiaries in 
20:479:40251:27:28:72:527:350:144:Times:144:Times:precise patterns and at relatively close intervals. While some tests of the incendiaries had been 
20:480:40349:28:27:72:519:322:144:Times:144:Times:conducted on mock Japanese cities at the Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah, it was only as a 
20:481:40439:27:28:72:517:295:144:Times:144:Times:result of the experience of actual bombing raids that US forces achieved the optimal pattern. 
20:482:40533:28:28:72:537:267:144:Times:144:Times:Moreover, cities such as Nagoya, which were firebombed early, had as a result of those raids the 
20:483:40630:28:27:72:529:239:144:Times:144:Times:equivalent of firebreaks within the city. In the subsequent raids, it became nearly impossible to 
20:484:40728:27:28:72:250:212:144:Times:144:Times:create highly destructive firestorms.  
20:485:40767:28:27:108:541:184:144:Times:144:Times:In addition, there were a large number of other factors at work that created variance in the 
20:486:40860:27:28:72:507:157:144:Times:144:Times:destruction of cities. These include the steady growth in the number of B-29s available for 
20:487:40952:28:20:72:539:129:144:Times:144:Times:service; the evolving defense capabilities of the Japanese cities (which was important notably for 
20:488:41051:20:8:72:219:109:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
20:489:41099:8:16:72:513:101:42:Times:99:Times:16 Our definition of “virtually untouched” is casualties of under 100.  Hammel (1998) reports no air attacks on 
20:490:41211:16:11:72:528:85:99:Times:99:Times:Kyoto.  Nakamura and Miyazaki (1995) do report 82 casualties in Kyoto (1940 Pop. 1.1 million) due to the war.   
20:491:41323:11:0:72:514:74:99:Times:99:Times:Presumably these were due to targeting errors, strafing, and/or Kyoto residents who were killed in other cities. 
21:492:41438:0:28:72:515:709:144:Times:144:Times:Osaka); the topography of specific cities; and sheer fortune, as in the fact that Nagasaki was 
21:493:41533:28:28:72:492:681:144:Times:144:Times:bombed only when the primary target, Kokura (now Kitakyushu), could not be visually 
21:494:41617:28:27:72:216:653:144:Times:144:Times:identified due to cloud cover.

21:496:41648:28:27:108:294:598:144:Times:144:Times:D. Temporary Nature of the Shocks 
21:497:41682:27:28:108:529:571:144:Times:144:Times:Rarely does one find shocks that can so clearly be identified as temporary. For much of 
21:498:41770:28:28:72:524:543:144:Times:144:Times:World War II, Japanese cities were simply out of range of US bombers. In the first year of the 
21:499:41865:28:27:72:525:515:144:Times:144:Times:war, the US managed only the single “Doolittle raid” on Japan from a US carrier, and this had 
21:500:41959:27:28:72:525:488:144:Times:144:Times:little more than psychological impact. Later, the US tried to use China as a base for attacks on 
21:501:42056:28:27:72:535:460:144:Times:144:Times:Japanese cities. But the long flights required and the difficult supply lines insured that these had 
21:502:42157:27:28:72:515:433:144:Times:144:Times:only minimal effect. It was only with the capture of the Marianas islands as a B-29 base, the 
21:503:42251:28:28:72:522:405:144:Times:144:Times:seizure of Iwo Jima (which lay directly between the Marianas and Japan) as a base for fighter 
21:504:42345:28:27:72:530:377:144:Times:144:Times:escorts, a rise in the number of planes available, and the introduction of new tactics by General 
21:505:42443:27:28:72:525:350:144:Times:144:Times:LeMay that the US attacks reached an apogee. The most powerful attacks were compressed in 
21:506:42533:28:27:72:224:322:144:Times:144:Times:the last five months of the war. 
21:507:42566:27:28:108:541:295:144:Times:144:Times:While the devastation of many of these cities was powerful, once the flames were out, the 
21:508:42656:28:28:72:503:267:144:Times:144:Times:geographical characteristics of particular locations are affected little or not at all. The one 
21:509:42752:28:27:72:520:239:144:Times:144:Times:possible exception, of course, is the lingering radiation in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This will 
21:510:42847:27:28:72:531:212:144:Times:144:Times:make these particularly interesting cases to see whether they were special cases in the period of 
21:511:42945:28:27:72:184:184:144:Times:144:Times:recovery from the war. 
21:512:42968:27:28:108:111:157:144:Times:144:Times: 
21:513:42968:28:0:72:342:129:144:Times:144:Times:E. Impact of the Shocks: Temporary or Permanent? 
22:514:43019:0:28:72:535:709:144:Times:144:Times: We now inquire whether temporary shocks have permanent effects on relative city sizes. 
22:515:43106:28:28:72:517:681:144:Times:144:Times:Let Sit be city i’s share of total population at time t, and let sit be the natural logarithm of this 
22:516:43207:28:30:72:538:653:144:Times:144:Times:share.  Suppose further that each city has an initial size Ωi and is buffeted by city-specific shocks 
22:517:43309:30:29:72:413:623:147:Symbol:144:Times:εit. In this case we can write the size of any city at any point in time as, 
22:518:43386:29:31:72:730:594:144:Times:144:Times: itiitsε=Ω +                                                                (1)                                                                
22:519:43528:31:29:72:413:563:144:Times:144:Times:We can model the persistence in these shocks to population shares as:  
22:520:43599:29:31:72:720:534:144:Times:144:Times: 11itititερεν++=+                                                            (2)                                                            
22:521:43738:31:29:72:401:503:144:Times:144:Times:The parameter ρ ∈ [0,1] and the innovation, νit, is an iid error term.  
22:522:43809:29:29:72:531:474:144:Times:144:Times: We examine the evolution of this system by first differencing equation (1).   This yields 
22:523:43899:29:30:72:714:445:144:Times:144:Times: 11ititititssεε++−=  −                                                          (3)                                                          
22:524:44039:30:31:72:369:415:144:Times:144:Times:If we substitute equation (2) into equation (3), we then obtain 
22:525:44103:31:34:72:655:384:144:Times:144:Times: ()()11111itititititssρννρρε++−−= −   ++  −                                       (4)                                       
22:526:44230:34:29:72:508:350:144:Times:144:Times:The key parameter is ρ, which tells us how much of a temporary shock is dissipated in one 
22:527:44320:29:28:72:515:321:144:Times:144:Times:period. If ρ = 1, then all shocks are permanent and city size follows a random walk.17 In this 
22:528:44415:28:29:72:102:293:144:Times:144:Times:case,  
22:529:44422:29:32:72:724:264:144:Times:144:Times: 11itititssν++=+                                                             (5)                                                             
22:530:44562:32:29:72:534:232:144:Times:144:Times:If ρ ∈ [0,1), then city share is stationary and any shock will dissipate over time.  In other words, 
22:531:44662:29:30:72:434:203:144:Times:144:Times:these two hypotheses can be distinguished by identifying the parameter ρ.   
22:532:44737:30:29:72:522:173:144:Times:144:Times: One approach to investigating the magnitude of ρ is to search for a unit root. It is well 
22:533:44827:29:29:72:529:144:144:Times:144:Times:known that unit root tests usually have little power to separate ρ < 1 from ρ = 1.  This is due to 
22:534:44926:29:29:72:539:115:144:Times:144:Times:the fact that in traditional unit root tests the innovations are not observable and so identify ρ with 
22:535:45029:29:8:72:219:86:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
22:536:45077:8:0:72:341:78:42:Times:99:Times:17 Equation (5) is identical with the key equation in Gabaix (1999). 
23:537:45148:0:29:72:525:709:144:Times:144:Times:very large standard errors.  A major advantage of our data set is that we can easily identify the 
23:538:45246:29:28:72:541:680:144:Times:144:Times:innovations due to bombing.  In particular, since by hypothesis the innovation, νit, is uncorrelated 
23:539:45347:28:29:72:501:652:144:Times:144:Times:with the term in square brackets, then if we can identify the innovation, we can obtain an 
23:540:45438:29:28:72:186:623:144:Times:144:Times:unbiased estimate of ρ. 
23:541:45462:28:28:72:525:595:144:Times:144:Times: An obvious method of looking at the innovation is to use the growth rate from 1940 to 
23:542:45548:28:28:72:514:567:144:Times:144:Times:1947.  However, this measure of the innovation may contain not only information about the 
23:543:45638:28:28:72:521:539:144:Times:144:Times:bombing but also past growth rates.  This is a measurement error problem that could bias our 
23:544:45731:28:29:72:527:511:144:Times:144:Times:estimates in either direction depending on ρ.18 In order to solve this, we instrument the growth 
23:545:45828:29:27:72:443:482:144:Times:144:Times:rate from 1940-47 with buildings destroyed per capita and deaths per capita.  
23:546:45906:27:28:72:526:455:144:Times:144:Times: We can obtain a general feel for the data by considering the impact of bombing on city 
23:547:45993:28:27:72:537:427:144:Times:144:Times:growth rates.  As we argued earlier, if city growth rates follow a random walk, then all shocks to 
23:548:46092:27:28:72:506:400:144:Times:144:Times:cities should be permanent.  In this case, one should expect to see no relationship between 
23:549:46184:28:28:72:530:372:144:Times:144:Times:historical shocks and future growth rates.  Moreover, if one believes that there is positive serial 
23:550:46284:28:27:72:516:344:144:Times:144:Times:correlation in the data, then one should expect to see a positive correlation between past and 
23:551:46379:27:28:72:509:317:144:Times:144:Times:future growth rates.  By contrast, if one believes that location specific factors are crucial in 
23:552:46476:28:27:72:485:289:144:Times:144:Times:understanding the distribution of population, then one should expect to see a negative 
23:553:46563:27:28:72:541:262:144:Times:144:Times:relationship between a historical shock and the subsequent growth rate.   In Figure 1 we present a 
23:554:46662:28:28:72:531:234:144:Times:144:Times:plot of population growth between 1947 and 1960 with that between 1940 and 1947.  The sizes 
23:555:46754:28:27:72:500:206:144:Times:144:Times:of the circles represent the population of the city in 1925.  The figure reveals a very clear 
23:556:46848:27:69:72:514:179:144:Times:144:Times:negative relationship the two growth rates. This indicates that cities that suffered the largest 
23:557:46945:69:8:72:219:110:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
23:558:46993:8:17:72:527:102:42:Times:99:Times:18 The actual estimating equation is si60 – si47 = (ρ - 1) νι47 + [νi60 + ρ (ρ - 1) εi34].  Our measure of the shock is the 
23:559:47114:17:11:72:528:85:99:Times:99:Times:growth rate between 1940 and 1947 or si47 – si40 = νι47 + [ρ εi34 - εi40].  This is clearly correlated with error term in 
23:560:47234:11:0:72:257:74:99:Times:99:Times:the estimating equation, hence we instrument. 
24:561:47282:0:28:72:535:709:144:Times:144:Times:population declines due to bombing tended to have the fastest postwar growth rates, while cities 
24:562:47379:28:28:72:455:681:144:Times:144:Times:whose populations boomed conversely had much lower growth rates thereafter. 
24:563:47455:28:27:72:523:653:144:Times:144:Times: In Table 2, we present a regression showing the power of our instruments.  Deaths per 
24:564:47541:27:28:72:542:626:144:Times:144:Times:capita and destruction per capita explain about 41 percent of the variance in population growth of 
24:565:47640:28:27:72:531:598:144:Times:144:Times:cities between 1940 and 1947.  Interestingly although both have the expected signs, destruction 
24:566:47736:27:28:72:521:571:144:Times:144:Times:seems to have had a more pronounced effect on the populations of cities.  Presumably, this is 
24:567:47830:28:28:72:526:543:144:Times:144:Times:because, with a few notable exceptions, the number of people killed was only a few percent of 
24:568:47924:28:27:72:182:515:144:Times:144:Times:the city’s population.   
24:569:47949:27:28:72:516:488:144:Times:144:Times: We now turn to test whether the temporary shocks give rise to permanent effects.  In 
24:570:48034:28:27:72:540:460:144:Times:144:Times:order to estimate equation (4), we regress the growth rate of cities between 1947 and 1960 on the 
24:571:48132:27:29:72:525:433:144:Times:144:Times:growth rate between 1940 and 1947 using deaths and destruction per capita as instruments for 
24:572:48225:29:28:72:535:404:144:Times:144:Times:the wartime growth rates.  The coefficient on growth between 1940 and 1947 corresponds to (ρ -
24:573:48319:28:28:72:517:376:144:Times:144:Times:1).  In addition, we include government subsidies to cities to control for policies designed to 
24:574:48415:28:28:72:146:348:144:Times:144:Times:rebuild cities.   
24:575:48433:28:28:108:542:320:144:Times:144:Times:If one believes that cities follow a random walk or that catastrophes can permanently alter 
24:576:48525:28:29:72:533:292:144:Times:144:Times:the size of cities, then one should expect the coefficient on the 40-47 growth rate, (ρ -1), should 
24:577:48625:29:27:72:496:263:144:Times:144:Times:be zero.  If one believes that the temporary shocks have only temporary effects, then the 
24:578:48715:27:28:72:534:236:144:Times:144:Times:coefficient on 40-47 growth should be negative.  A coefficient of minus one indicates that all of 
24:579:48813:28:27:72:238:208:144:Times:144:Times:the shock was dissipated by 1960. 
24:580:48847:27:29:72:535:181:144:Times:144:Times: The results are presented in Table 3.  The coefficient on 40-47 growth is –1.0, indicating 
24:581:48938:29:28:72:523:152:144:Times:144:Times:that at this interval ρ is zero.  This means that the typical city completely recovered its former 
24:582:49037:28:28:72:517:124:144:Times:144:Times:relative size within 15 years following the end of World War II.  Given the magnitude of the 
24:583:49130:28:0:72:540:96:144:Times:144:Times:destruction, this is quite surprising. Apparently, US bombing of Japanese cities had no impact on 
25:584:49230:0:28:72:531:709:144:Times:144:Times:the typical city’s size in 1960. This strongly rejects the hypothesis that growth in city size share 
25:585:49331:28:28:72:166:681:144:Times:144:Times:is a random walk.   
25:586:49351:28:27:72:507:653:144:Times:144:Times:  As expected, reconstruction subsidies seem to have had a positive and statistically 
25:587:49436:27:28:72:516:626:144:Times:144:Times:significant impact on rebuilding cities. However, the economic impact is quite modest.  Our 
25:588:49528:28:27:72:504:598:144:Times:144:Times:estimates suggest that a one standard deviation increase in reconstruction expenses would 
25:589:49618:27:28:72:536:571:144:Times:144:Times:increase the size of a city in 1960 by 2.2 percent.  Reconstruction expenses probably had a small 
25:590:49716:28:28:72:521:543:144:Times:144:Times:effect because both the sums spent and the variance in the sums were small.  In the cities that 
25:591:49812:28:27:72:512:515:144:Times:144:Times:suffered the heaviest destruction – Tokyo, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Osaka – our estimates 
25:592:49902:27:28:72:541:488:144:Times:144:Times:indicate that government reconstruction expenses accounted for less than one percentage point of 
25:593:49999:28:27:72:528:460:144:Times:144:Times:their cumulative growth between 1947 and 1960.  Given that cumulative growth in these cities 
25:594:50092:27:28:72:529:433:144:Times:144:Times:over that period was between 55 and 96 percent, we conclude that reconstruction expenses had 
25:595:50185:28:28:72:519:405:144:Times:144:Times:relatively small impacts.  As we noted earlier, a major reason for this was that reconstruction 
25:596:50281:28:27:72:538:377:144:Times:144:Times:policies, like most Japanese regional policies, disproportionately sent money to rural areas.  As a 
25:597:50381:27:28:72:520:350:144:Times:144:Times:result, the four biggest per capita recipients of assistance were small northern cities that were 
25:598:50479:28:27:72:229:322:144:Times:144:Times:never targeted by US bombers.   
25:599:50511:27:28:72:523:295:144:Times:144:Times: One potential problem with these results is that it is possible that the US inadvertently 
25:600:50601:28:28:72:516:267:144:Times:144:Times:targeted cities based on underlying growth rates.  While this was not an explicit strategy, we 
25:601:50696:28:27:72:505:239:144:Times:144:Times:cannot rule it out.  If the US bombed rapidly growing cities more heavily, then we may be 
25:602:50786:27:28:72:508:212:144:Times:144:Times:biasing our results downwards.  We therefore repeated our exercise adding the growth rate 
25:603:50876:28:27:72:533:184:144:Times:144:Times:between 1925 and 1940 to our list of independent variables.  This improves the fit, but does not 
25:604:50973:27:28:72:521:157:144:Times:144:Times:qualitatively change the results, although the coefficient on 40-47 growth falls to –0.76.  This 
25:605:51070:28:28:72:527:129:144:Times:144:Times:implies that bombed cities had recovered over three-fourths of their lost growth by 1960.  One 
25:606:51165:28:0:72:535:101:144:Times:144:Times:reasonable question to ask, then, is whether these cities ever returned to their prewar trajectories 
26:607:51268:0:28:72:533:709:144:Times:144:Times:or not. If one believes in the location specific model, then one should expect that the coefficient 
26:608:51368:28:28:72:535:681:144:Times:144:Times:on wartime growth should asymptotically approach unity as the end period increases.  In the last 
26:609:51465:28:27:72:535:653:144:Times:144:Times:column of Table 3 we repeat the regression, only now extending the endpoint to 1965 instead of 
26:610:51560:27:28:72:525:626:144:Times:144:Times:1960. The estimated coefficient now reaches –1.0. That is, after controlling for prewar growth 
26:611:51655:28:27:72:519:598:144:Times:144:Times:trends, by 1965 cities have entirely reversed the damage due to the war. Again, the impact of 
26:612:51749:27:28:72:536:571:144:Times:144:Times:reconstruction subsidies also lessens as we move into the future.  Together, these results suggest 
26:613:51848:28:28:72:482:543:144:Times:144:Symbol:that the effect of the temporary shocks vanishes completely in less than twenty years. 
26:614:51934:28:27:72:535:515:144:Times:144:Times: One possible objection to our interpretation is that in most cases, the population changes 
26:615:52025:27:28:72:534:488:144:Times:144:Times:corresponded much more to refugees than deaths.  Of the 144 cities with positive casualties, the 
26:616:52122:28:27:72:534:460:144:Times:144:Times:average number of deaths per capita was only 1 percent.  Most of the population movement that 
26:617:52216:27:28:72:524:433:144:Times:144:Times:we observe in our data is due to the fact that the vast destruction of buildings forced people to 
26:618:52314:28:28:72:535:405:144:Times:144:Times:live elsewhere. However, forcing them to move out of their cities for a number of years may not 
26:619:52410:28:27:72:519:377:144:Times:144:Times:have sufficed to overcome the social networks and other draws of their home cities. Hence it 
26:620:52503:27:28:72:538:350:144:Times:144:Times:may seem uncertain whether they are moving back to take advantage of particular characteristics 
26:621:52599:28:27:72:464:322:144:Times:144:Times:of these locations or simply moving back to the only real home they have known. 
26:622:52679:27:28:72:520:295:144:Times:144:Times: However, there are two cases in which this argument cannot be made: Hiroshima and 
26:623:52761:28:28:72:507:267:144:Times:144:Times:Nagasaki. In those cities, the number of deaths was such that if these cities recovered their 
26:624:52855:28:27:72:535:239:144:Times:144:Times:populations, it could not be because residents who temporarily moved out of the city returned in 
26:625:52952:27:28:72:536:212:144:Times:144:Times:subsequent years.  We have already noted that our data underestimates casualties in these cities.  
26:626:53051:28:27:72:527:184:144:Times:144:Times:Even so, our data suggest that the nuclear bombs immediately killed 8.5 percent of Nagasaki’s 
26:627:53145:27:28:72:520:157:144:Times:144:Times:population and 20.8 percent of Hiroshima’s population.  Moreover given that many Japanese 
26:628:53235:28:28:72:537:129:144:Times:144:Times:were worried about radiation poisoning and actively discriminated against atomic bomb victims, 
26:629:53330:28:0:72:502:101:144:Times:144:Times:it is unlikely that residents felt an unusually strong attachment to these cities or that other 
27:630:53428:0:28:72:523:709:144:Times:144:Times:Japanese felt a strong desire to move there.  Another reason why these cities are interesting to 
27:631:53525:28:28:72:484:681:144:Times:144:Times:consider is that they were not particularly large or famous cities in Japan.  Their 1940 
27:632:53614:28:27:72:521:653:144:Times:144:Times:populations made them the 8th and 12th largest cities in Japan.  Both cities were close to other 
27:633:53711:27:28:72:532:626:144:Times:144:Times:cities of comparable size so that it would have been relatively easy for other cities to absorb the 
27:634:53811:28:27:72:256:598:144:Times:144:Times:populations of these devastated cities. 
27:635:53851:27:28:72:542:571:144:Times:144:Times: In Figure 2 we plot the population of these two cities.  What is striking in the graph is that 
27:636:53946:28:28:72:507:543:144:Times:144:Times:even in these two cities there is a clear indication that they returned to their prewar growth 
27:637:54041:28:27:72:539:515:144:Times:144:Times:trends.  This process seems to have taken a little longer in Hiroshima than in other cities, but this 
27:638:54143:27:28:72:304:488:144:Times:144:Times:is not surprising given the level of destruction.   
27:639:54195:28:27:72:518:460:144:Times:144:Times: Taken together, these tests establish that even the spectacular destruction inflicted on 
27:640:54284:27:28:72:525:433:144:Times:144:Times:Japanese cities by the US Strategic Bombing of Japanese cities in WWII had virtually no long 
27:641:54377:28:28:72:516:405:144:Times:144:Times:run impact on the relative size of Japanese cities. Within the space of just twenty years, they 
27:642:54473:28:27:72:507:377:144:Times:144:Times:recovered from the devastation to return to their former place in the constellation of cities. 
27:643:54568:27:28:72:75:350:144:Times:144:Times: 
27:644:54568:28:27:72:298:322:144:Times:144:Times:IV. Three Theories in Light of the Evidence 
27:645:54612:27:28:72:501:295:144:Times:144:Times: The preceding two sections establish a series of stylized facts about the economic 
27:646:54695:28:28:72:531:267:144:Times:144:Times:geography of Japan. It is now time to collect those facts and consider them in light of the major 
27:647:54793:28:27:72:535:239:144:Times:144:Times:theories. The facts are: (1) A high degree of variation in Japanese regional density has existed at 
27:648:54893:27:28:72:522:212:144:Times:144:Times:all points in time. (2) Zipf’s law holds approximately for the distribution of regional densities 
27:649:54991:28:27:72:516:184:144:Times:144:Times:throughout Japanese history. (3) The variation in regional densities begins to rise in the very 
27:650:55087:27:28:72:520:157:144:Times:144:Times:period that Japan re-opens to the world economy and begins its industrialization. (4) There is 
27:651:55182:28:28:72:529:129:144:Times:144:Times:tremendous persistence in the identity of the most densely settled regions. (5) Even very strong 
27:652:55279:28:0:72:470:101:144:Times:144:Times:temporary shocks have virtually no permanent impact on the relative size of cities. 
28:653:55365:0:28:72:518:709:144:Times:144:Times: The three theories that we have identified are increasing returns (IR), random growth 
28:654:55451:28:28:72:534:681:144:Times:144:Times:(RG), and locational fundamentals (LF). Properly, the IR approach is less a theory than a family 
28:655:55548:28:27:72:538:653:144:Times:144:Times:of theories with common structural elements. Hence we do not think it is appropriate to consider 
28:656:55645:27:28:72:532:626:144:Times:144:Times:our exercises a test of the IR theories. Rather, we will use the facts to consider which of various 
28:657:55745:28:27:72:526:598:144:Times:144:Times:themes that have featured prominently within the IR literature.  We summarize our findings in 
28:658:55839:27:28:72:539:571:144:Times:144:Times:Table 4 where a “+” indicates that the stylized fact is predicted by the theory, a “–” indicates that 
28:659:55941:28:28:72:511:543:144:Times:144:Times:the theory does not predict it, and a question mark indicates that the theory either makes no 
28:660:56035:28:27:72:206:515:144:Times:144:Times:prediction or is ambiguous. 
28:661:56063:27:28:108:493:488:144:Times:144:Times:As a point of analysis, the increasing returns theories frequently ask how spatial 
28:662:56146:28:27:72:529:460:144:Times:144:Times:differentiation may emerge even in a framework in which all locations are identical in terms of 
28:663:56242:27:28:72:537:433:144:Times:144:Times:economic primitives (FKV 1999). From an analytic standpoint, this is precisely the right starting 
28:664:56340:28:28:72:490:405:144:Times:144:Times:point because it emphasizes theoretical features of the IR approach that are unique and 
28:665:56428:28:27:72:518:377:144:Times:144:Times:surprising. However, it is an empirical question how much of the actual variation in regional 
28:666:56522:27:28:72:538:350:144:Times:144:Times:densities owes to IR forces and how much to other factors. An extremely important advantage of 
28:667:56617:28:27:72:515:322:144:Times:144:Times:the long time series with which we work is that it is both able to examine the distribution of 
28:668:56712:27:28:72:522:295:144:Times:144:Times:regional densities for a period in which the forces of increasing returns must have been vastly 
28:669:56808:28:28:72:529:267:144:Times:144:Times:weaker than they are today and also to see if there is a rise in regional variation in the period in 
28:670:56909:28:27:72:278:239:144:Times:144:Times:which the theory predicts there should be.  
28:671:56953:27:28:108:534:212:144:Times:144:Times:The fact that there has been a high degree of variation in regional population densities at 
28:672:57045:28:27:72:522:184:144:Times:144:Times:all points in Japanese history, even those in which increasing returns is most likely of at most 
28:673:57142:27:28:72:537:157:144:Times:144:Times:modest importance, strongly suggest that there are forces quite apart from increasing returns that 
28:674:57241:28:28:72:509:129:144:Times:144:Times:have long been important contributors to this regional variation. However, the fact that the 
28:675:57334:28:0:72:540:101:144:Times:144:Times:variation in regional population density rose precisely in the period in which Japan industrialized 
29:676:57436:0:28:72:531:709:144:Times:144:Times:is something that we may well have expected based on the IR approach. This seems reasonably 
29:677:57528:28:28:72:535:681:144:Times:144:Times:strong evidence that IR theories do have something important to contribute to a complete theory 
29:678:57624:28:27:72:193:653:144:Times:144:Times:of economic geography.  
29:679:57648:27:28:108:540:626:144:Times:144:Times:We have noted that the Zipf relation holds reasonably well for the distribution of regional 
29:680:57740:28:27:72:532:598:144:Times:144:Times:densities, just as it does for the distribution of city sizes. Fujita, Krugman, and Venables (1999) 
29:681:57840:27:28:72:530:571:144:Times:144:Times:have been very forthright that the IR theories provide no obvious account for the Zipf relation.  
29:682:57938:28:28:108:541:543:144:Times:144:Times:The IR theories do not provide a definitive answer to the degree of persistence one should 
29:683:58029:28:27:72:535:515:144:Times:144:Times:expect in regional densities. One strand of the theory, due to Henderson (1974), ties city sizes to 
29:684:58129:27:28:72:531:488:144:Times:144:Times:technological characteristics of specific industries. Since we are looking over periods with very 
29:685:58227:28:27:72:541:460:144:Times:144:Times:radical shifts in industrial structure, one might on this basis suppose that there would be similarly 
29:686:58329:27:28:72:520:433:144:Times:144:Times:radical shifts in regional densities (which we don’t observe). However, there is an alternative 
29:687:58425:28:28:72:537:405:144:Times:144:Times:tradition within the IR approach, typified by Paul David (2000) and very evident in FKV (1999), 
29:688:58521:28:27:72:541:377:144:Times:144:Times:which stresses the role of path dependence. Small initial advantages cumulate, so that even as the 
29:689:58620:27:28:72:525:350:144:Times:144:Times:industrial structure changes radically, the head start provides an advantage in the next stage of 
29:690:58718:28:27:72:530:322:144:Times:144:Times:locational competition. It seems to us that if one is to interpret the strong locational persistence 
29:691:58819:27:28:72:480:295:144:Times:144:Times:from the perspective of the IR framework that one does need to rely strongly on path 
29:692:58904:28:28:72:137:267:144:Times:144:Times:dependence.  
29:693:58917:28:27:108:534:239:144:Times:144:Times:Finally, again the IR framework does not provide a unique answer to whether temporary 
29:694:59003:27:28:72:528:212:144:Times:144:Times:shocks will have permanent effects. Nonetheless, the investigation of the bombing of Japanese 
29:695:59097:28:27:72:532:184:144:Times:144:Times:cities does prove useful. One of the most striking features of the IR literature is the existence of 
29:696:59198:27:0:72:505:157:144:Times:144:Times:bifurcations in parameter space – what FKV term break points and sustain points – which 
30:697:59287:0:28:72:535:709:144:Times:144:Times:separate radically different spatial equilibria.19 The literature emphasizes as well that because of 
30:698:59388:28:28:72:516:681:144:Times:144:Times:the existence of multiple stable equilibria, there may be irreversibility of these changes even 
30:699:59484:28:27:72:502:653:144:Times:144:Times:when the forces that brought about the initial change are reversed. An important practical 
30:700:59575:27:28:72:532:626:144:Times:144:Times:question, then, is whether such spatial catastrophes are theoretical curiosa or a central tendency 
30:701:59674:28:27:72:542:598:144:Times:144:Times:in the data. Our results provide an unambiguous answer: Even nuclear bombs have little effect on 
30:702:59771:27:28:72:522:571:144:Times:144:Times:relative city sizes over the course of a couple of decades. The theoretical possibility of spatial 
30:703:59870:28:28:72:477:543:144:Times:144:Times:catastrophes due to temporary shocks is not a central tendency borne out in the data. 
30:704:59956:28:27:108:536:515:144:Times:144:Times:The random growth (RG) theory can be discussed briefly. The most important advantage 
30:705:60041:27:28:72:535:488:144:Times:144:Times:of the RG theory over the IR theory is simply that it provides a foundation for understanding the 
30:706:60139:28:27:72:534:460:144:Times:144:Times:Zipf distribution, which is also evident in the distribution of regional densities. The existence of 
30:707:60240:27:28:72:538:433:144:Times:144:Times:substantial variation in regional densities across all of Japanese history is consistent with the RG 
30:708:60341:28:28:72:533:405:144:Times:144:Times:theory provided the stochastic process starts sufficiently far back in time. The persistence of the 
30:709:60441:28:27:72:528:377:144:Times:144:Times:identity of the densely settled regions can be made consistent with the RG theory only if one is 
30:710:60538:27:28:72:520:350:144:Times:144:Times:willing to believe that the variance of growth rates is quite small. The RG theory provides no 
30:711:60633:28:27:72:541:322:144:Times:144:Times:explanation why the industrial revolution in Japan should have been accompanied by a rise in the 
30:712:60730:27:28:72:508:295:144:Times:144:Times:variation in regional densities. However, the most devastating strike against the RG theory 
30:713:60822:28:28:72:520:267:144:Times:144:Times:comes from the examination of the bombing data. The RG theory holds that growth will be a 
30:714:60912:28:27:72:536:239:144:Times:144:Times:random walk. This is strongly rejected by the data on the recovery of Japanese cities in the wake 
30:715:61010:27:28:72:505:212:144:Times:144:Times:of the WWII bombing. Hence we consider this a decisive rejection of the pure RG theory. 
30:716:61098:28:27:108:507:184:144:Times:144:Times:The locational fundamentals (LF) theory holds that there are permanent features of 
30:717:61181:27:28:72:538:157:144:Times:144:Times:specific locations that make these locations an excellent site for economic activity. Access to the 
30:718:61281:28:20:72:532:129:144:Times:144:Times:sea, rivers, and a large plain has been useful at all points in time. Location on a mountaintop, in 
30:719:61381:20:8:72:219:109:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
30:720:61429:8:16:72:505:101:42:Times:99:Times:19 Formally, a break point is a parameter value that marks a threshold between values for which a symmetric 
30:721:61537:16:11:72:516:85:99:Times:99:Times:equilibrium is stable or not. A sustain point, similarly, is the threshold governing the stability of a concentrated 
30:722:61654:11:0:72:126:74:99:Times:99:Times:equilibrium.  
31:723:61670:0:28:72:536:709:144:Times:144:Times:the desert, or in harsh climactic conditions has always been a disadvantage. This provides a very 
31:724:61768:28:28:72:533:681:144:Times:144:Times:natural account of the high degree of variation in regional densities at all points in time. If these 
31:725:61870:28:27:72:537:653:144:Times:144:Times:fundamentals are distributed as suggested by Krugman (1996) and Gabaix (1999), then they also 
31:726:61964:27:28:72:537:626:144:Times:144:Times:provide an account for Zipf’s law. Persistence is highly compatible with this account. Moreover, 
31:727:62061:28:27:72:523:598:144:Times:144:Times:since the bombing of cities would not be expected to affect these fundamentals, the LF theory 
31:728:62155:27:28:72:530:571:144:Times:144:Times:provides a very natural account for the postwar mean reversion of cities. The one area in which 
31:729:62251:28:28:72:503:543:144:Times:144:Times:there seems to be an important shortfall is that the LF theory does not provide an obvious 
31:730:62342:28:27:72:505:515:144:Times:144:Times:explanation for the rise in the variation of regional densities coincident with the industrial 
31:731:62437:27:28:72:173:488:144:Times:144:Times:revolution in Japan.

31:734:62469:27:28:72:524:405:144:Times:144:Times: While we do not directly examine any policy interventions, our results are pertinent to 
31:735:62557:28:27:72:512:377:144:Times:144:Times:policy discussions. One of the most important reasons for the renewed interest in economic 
31:736:62648:27:28:72:531:350:144:Times:144:Times:geography is precisely the possibility that in a world of cumulative causation, path dependence, 
31:737:62745:28:27:72:512:322:144:Times:144:Times:and critical break points, even temporary policy interventions may alter the long run spatial 
31:738:62839:27:28:72:496:295:144:Times:144:Times:structure of economic activity. These in turn may have important welfare consequences, 
31:739:62926:28:28:72:526:267:144:Times:144:Times:particularly for immobile factors in the regions favored or not. Our results suggest a great deal 
31:740:63024:28:27:72:504:239:144:Times:144:Times:more stability in the spatial structure of economies than one might have guessed. There is 
31:741:63115:27:28:72:527:212:144:Times:144:Times:tremendous persistence in which regions are most densely settled, even as the economy passes 
31:742:63208:28:27:72:541:184:144:Times:144:Times:through multiple economic revolutions – the rise of agriculture, the rise and decline of feudalism, 
31:743:63308:27:28:72:539:157:144:Times:144:Times:the move to autarky and the reversal to free trade, and finally the rise of the industrial revolution. 
31:744:63411:28:28:72:496:129:144:Times:144:Times:Destruction of half or more of a city’s structures and killing as much as 20 percent of its 
31:745:63503:28:0:72:537:101:144:Times:144:Times:population does little to disturb the long run relative size of a city. In the face of these facts, how 
32:746:63609:0:28:72:497:709:144:Times:144:Times:much chance is there that temporary subsidies of economically relevant magnitudes will 
32:747:63696:28:28:72:386:681:144:Times:144:Times:significantly alter the long run spatial structure of an economy?20 
32:748:63763:28:27:72:525:653:144:Times:144:Times: Jeffrey Sachs and various co-authors have raised a policy-relevant question bearing on 
32:749:63850:27:28:72:532:626:144:Times:144:Times:issues of economic development.21 To what extent is geography destiny? Is living in the tropics 
32:750:63946:28:27:72:523:598:144:Times:144:Times:instead of a temperate zone a long run impediment to economic development? Is the lack of a 
32:751:64038:27:28:72:520:571:144:Times:144:Times:coast or navigable rivers an insuperable obstacle to growth? We believe that the evidence we 
32:752:64131:28:28:72:537:543:144:Times:144:Times:provide complements the results of Sachs and others which stress that there are deep, very likely 
32:753:64229:28:27:72:518:515:144:Times:144:Times:geographical, characteristics of particular locations that have a very strong influence on their 
32:754:64326:27:28:72:489:488:144:Times:144:Times:opportunities for growth relative to other locations in a common technological regime.

32:756:64413:28:27:72:156:432:144:Times:144:Times:VI. Conclusions 
32:757:64429:27:28:72:514:405:144:Times:144:Times: We began with the defining question of economic geography: What gives rise to the 
32:758:64511:28:27:72:522:377:144:Times:144:Times:observed variation in economic activity across regions? It is impossible, of course, to provide 
32:759:64607:27:28:72:524:350:144:Times:144:Times:final answers to such an important question on the basis of one study of the experience of one 
32:760:64702:28:27:72:498:322:144:Times:144:Times:country. Nonetheless, we believe that the present study does allow important progress in 
32:761:64791:27:28:72:213:295:144:Times:144:Times:understanding this question.  
32:762:64821:28:28:72:519:267:144:Times:144:Times: We examined data on regional population density in Japan from the Stone Age to the 
32:763:64904:28:27:72:534:239:144:Times:144:Times:modern era. We also considered the implications for relative city sizes of the Allied bombing of 
32:764:65001:27:28:72:541:212:144:Times:144:Times:Japanese cities during World War II. These data exercises allowed us to develop a number of key 
32:765:65097:28:27:72:533:184:144:Times:144:Times:stylized facts. Variation in regional population density has been high at all points in time, obeys 
32:766:65197:27:25:72:532:157:144:Times:144:Times:Zipf’s law, and rose in the period coincident with the industrial revolution. There is a great deal 
32:767:65297:25:8:72:219:132:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
32:768:65345:8:16:72:521:124:42:Times:99:Times:20It is important to note that for these issues, the degree of geographical aggregation may matter. For example, it 
32:769:65461:16:11:72:519:108:99:Times:99:Times:may well be that Tokyo was destined to be a great city, but it may have been harder to say which sub-regions of 
32:770:65573:11:12:72:537:97:99:Times:99:Times:Tokyo would take on the specific character that they have. Similarly, this need not rule out that such subsidies could 
32:771:65692:12:7:72:351:85:99:Times:99:Times:importantly affect the industrial mix as opposed to aggregate activity. 
32:772:65764:7:0:72:379:78:42:Times:99:Times:21Cf. Rappaport and Sachs (2001), Gallup, Sachs, and Mellinger (1999), etc. 
33:773:65842:0:28:72:535:709:144:Times:144:Times:of persistence in the identity of the most densely settled regions. And temporary shocks, even of 
33:774:65940:28:28:72:504:681:144:Times:144:Times:frightening magnitude, appear to have little long run impact on the spatial structure of the 
33:775:66033:28:27:72:122:653:144:Times:144:Times:economy. 
33:776:66042:27:28:72:519:626:144:Times:144:Times: We then used these facts to consider three prominent theories designed to explain the 
33:777:66128:28:27:72:535:598:144:Times:144:Times:distribution of city sizes. The simple random growth theory of Simon (1955) and Gabaix (1999) 
33:778:66222:27:28:72:537:571:144:Times:144:Times:is decisively rejected by the bombing experiment, since that theory counterfactually predicts that 
33:779:66321:28:28:72:540:543:144:Times:144:Times:city sizes will follow a random walk. The strongest point in favor of the increasing returns theory 
33:780:66421:28:27:72:538:515:144:Times:144:Times:is its clear suggestion that industrialization should have raised the variation of regional densities, 
33:781:66524:27:28:72:535:488:144:Times:144:Times:a prediction confirmed by the data. The locational fundamentals theory emerges as an important 
33:782:66619:28:27:72:523:460:144:Times:144:Times:part of a full account. It can explain why there is a great deal of variation in regional densities 
33:783:66719:27:28:72:524:433:144:Times:144:Times:long before increasing returns is a plausible account; it explains why the densities obey Zipf’s 
33:784:66816:28:28:72:536:405:144:Times:144:Times:law – something the increasing returns theory cannot do; it predicts a great deal of persistence in 
33:785:66916:28:27:72:532:377:144:Times:144:Times:the distribution of regional densities; and it predicts that even quite large temporary shocks will 
33:786:67016:27:28:72:518:350:144:Times:144:Times:have little long run impact. The one dimension in which the increasing returns theory clearly 
33:787:67110:28:27:72:518:322:144:Times:144:Times:dominates the locational fundamentals theory is the account that it provides of the rise in the 
33:788:67206:27:28:72:484:295:144:Times:144:Times:variation of regional densities in the period of industrialization. Taken together, these 
33:789:67296:28:28:72:529:267:144:Times:144:Times:considerations lead us to favor a hybrid theory in which locational fundamentals play a leading 
33:790:67392:28:27:72:540:239:144:Times:144:Times:role in accounting for the spatial pattern of relative regional densities, but increasing returns may 
33:791:67494:27:28:72:334:212:144:Times:144:Times:help to determine the degree of spatial differentiation.

43:1019:78132:14:14:72:534:610:144:Times:144:Times:government records reflected this.  Until the mid 1870’s Japan was divided into 68 provinces or 
43:1020:78228:14:14:72:540:596:144:Times:144:Times:kuni.  However one of the kuni, Ezo, now Hokkaido, reported data very erratically due to the low 
43:1021:78325:14:14:72:527:582:144:Times:144:Times:Japanese population and was dropped from our sample.  These data were collected as a part of 
43:1022:78418:14:13:72:477:568:144:Times:144:Times:the Japanese tax system envisaged in the Taika reform of 646.  However, a series of 
43:1023:78502:13:14:72:531:555:144:Times:144:Times:assassinations, coups, and civil wars delayed full-scale implementation until 702.  At that time, 
43:1024:78600:14:14:72:526:541:144:Times:144:Times:cultivators over the age of 6 were allocated land from the government and in return had to pay 
43:1025:78695:14:14:72:533:527:144:Times:144:Times:lump sum in-kind taxes. (Hall p. 54).  This forced the government’s Popular Affairs Ministry to 
43:1026:78791:14:14:72:408:513:144:Times:144:Times:keep detailed population and tax records many of which exist today.   
43:1027:78861:14:13:72:525:499:144:Times:144:Times: The raw census data is hard to use, because censuses were done infrequently and often 
43:1028:78947:13:14:72:530:486:144:Times:144:Times:included different standards for covering samurai, non-land holders, women, children, etc.  For 
43:1029:79043:14:14:72:542:472:144:Times:144:Times:example, Kii did not report people under the age of 8 while other provinces reported significantly 
43:1030:79142:14:14:72:538:458:144:Times:144:Times:younger children.  Over the last 75 years, due in large measure to enormous efforts on the part of 
43:1031:79241:14:14:72:526:444:144:Times:144:Times:Japanese historical demographers, notably Sawada (1927), Sekiyama (1958), and Kito (1999), 
43:1032:79332:14:13:72:506:430:144:Times:144:Times:these data have been carefully organized and rendered systematic.  This typically involves 
43:1033:79423:13:14:72:533:417:144:Times:144:Times:incorporating procedures to estimate the missing youth population based on age distributions in 
43:1034:79519:14:14:72:174:403:144:Times:144:Times:neighboring regions. 
43:1035:79540:14:14:72:518:389:144:Times:144:Times: Our data on regional population between 725 and 1872 is based on Kito (1996).  The 
43:1036:79623:14:14:72:502:375:144:Times:144:Times:Kito dataset represents the culmination of these efforts by providing best estimates of the 
43:1037:79715:14:13:72:539:361:144:Times:144:Times:provincial population for 725, 800, 900, and 1150.  For these years, data is either based on actual 
43:1038:79815:13:14:72:524:348:144:Times:144:Times:census data where available or on the number of "villages" (go) per province.  In the Japanese 
43:1039:79910:14:14:72:510:334:144:Times:144:Times:system used at the time, each "village" or go was comprised of three hamlets containing 50 
43:1040:80001:14:14:72:488:320:144:Times:144:Times:households per hamlet.  Hence, if one can estimate the number of family members per 
43:1041:80085:14:14:72:498:306:144:Times:144:Times:household, based on existing household data in some regions, one can obtain reasonable 
43:1042:80172:14:13:72:421:292:144:Times:144:Times:estimates of the regional population based on the number of "villages".   
43:1043:80246:13:14:72:520:279:144:Times:144:Times: How well this method works can be assessed by how well these estimates conform to 
43:1044:80328:14:14:72:512:265:144:Times:144:Times:subsequent discoveries of census data.  For example, Farris (1984, p. 175) reports that after 
43:1045:80422:14:14:72:536:251:144:Times:144:Times:Sawada (1927) did his original analysis, archaeologists uncovered actual census data for Hitachi 
43:1046:80519:14:14:72:526:237:144:Times:144:Times:province in the year 800, a missing datum in Sawada.  Sawada’s estimate of 217,000 residents 
43:1047:80612:14:13:72:311:223:144:Times:144:Times:was quite close to the census number of 190,000. 
43:1048:80661:13:14:72:534:210:144:Times:144:Times: Data for 1600 is based on a major cadastral survey conducted under the order of Shogun 
43:1049:80748:14:14:72:526:196:144:Times:144:Times:Hideyoshi Toyotomi.  The frequency of census data increases from 1721 when Japan began to 
43:1050:80838:14:14:72:501:182:144:Times:144:Times:use these censuses as part of their anti-Christian campaign.  Unfortunately, there were no 
43:1051:80929:14:14:72:525:168:144:Times:144:Times:regional censuses taken between 1872 and 1920. Although some authors report figures for the 
43:1052:81021:14:13:72:450:154:144:Times:144:Times:intervening years, these are largely interpolations between the two end points.  
43:1053:81102:13:14:72:516:141:144:Times:144:Times: Another complication arises from the fact that historical regional data is based on 68 
43:1054:81189:14:14:72:524:127:144:Times:144:Times:provinces whose boundaries do not correspond precisely to the 47 prefectures used in modern 
43:1055:81281:14:14:72:520:113:144:Times:144:Times:census reporting.  For example, the province of Musashi was broken up into two prefectures, 
43:1056:81373:14:14:72:523:99:144:Times:144:Times:Tokyo and Saitama.  Others are harder to map into modern prefectures – e.g. the province Kii 
43:1057:81466:14:0:72:528:85:144:Times:144:Times:contains all of Wakayama prefecture and part of Mie.  Feudal lords in Japan ruled over several 
44:1058:81563:0:14:72:506:709:144:Times:144:Times:hundred domains, which, in general did not have boundaries that correspond to provincial 
44:1059:81652:14:14:72:514:695:144:Times:144:Times:boundaries.  The borders of these domains changed significantly over the course of the next 
44:1060:81744:14:14:72:513:681:144:Times:144:Times:millennium in response to wars and patronage, but the borders of the provinces did not. We 
44:1061:81835:14:14:72:522:667:144:Times:144:Times:solved this problem by using a historical map provided by Hanley and Yamamura (1977) and 
44:1062:81924:14:13:72:531:653:144:Times:144:Times:comparing it with modern maps.  This generates a concordance, which we present in Appendix 
44:1063:82015:13:14:72:535:640:144:Times:144:Times:Table 1. We then checked our matching by comparing the aggregate area of the provinces [from 
44:1064:82108:14:14:72:520:626:144:Times:144:Times:the 1882 Japanese Imperial Statistical Yearbook] with the areas of corresponding prefectures 
44:1065:82201:14:14:72:505:612:144:Times:144:Times:[from the 1998 Japan Statistical Yearbook].  This suggests that we matched the data quite 
44:1066:82291:14:14:72:112:598:144:Times:144:Times:closely. 
44:1067:82300:14:13:72:504:584:144:Times:144:Times:  We measured regional density as the number of people per square kilometer.  One 
44:1068:82382:13:14:72:534:571:144:Times:144:Times:problem that can arise is that regional definitions using provincial data may be slightly different 
44:1069:82482:14:14:72:507:557:144:Times:144:Times:from those using prefectural data.  In order to eliminate this problem, we implemented the 
44:1070:82573:14:14:72:540:543:144:Times:144:Times:following procedure. Whenever we formed a region using provincial population data we deflated 
44:1071:82667:14:14:72:489:529:144:Times:144:Times:it with provincial area data.  Likewise, whenever we formed a region using prefectural 
44:1072:82754:14:13:72:343:515:144:Times:144:Times:population data, we deflated using prefectural area data. 
44:1073:82812:13:14:72:538:502:144:Times:144:Times: While there is a very large literature in Japan on the accuracy of historical numbers, most 
44:1074:82904:14:14:72:516:488:144:Times:144:Times:researchers believe that the population numbers, at least from 1721 onwards, are accurate to 
44:1075:82997:14:14:72:514:474:144:Times:144:Times:within 15 percent.  The reason that we have a good sense about the accuracy is that in a few 
44:1076:83090:14:14:72:537:460:144:Times:144:Times:cases provincial boundaries and feudal domain boundaries coincided. Sometimes the feudal lord 
44:1077:83184:14:13:72:531:446:144:Times:144:Times:in these areas would conduct an independent population census of his domain, and then we can 
44:1078:83277:13:14:72:502:433:144:Times:144:Times:compare the results of the two surveys. So, for example, in the province of Bizen, central 
44:1079:83368:14:14:72:523:419:144:Times:144:Times:government data puts the 1798 population at 321,221 while the lord of Okayama believed the 
44:1080:83459:14:14:72:522:405:144:Times:144:Times:total to be 320,795.  However, both of these numbers underreport the population of the castle 
44:1081:83553:14:14:72:532:391:144:Times:144:Times:town, which Hanley and Yamamura (1977) suggest would take the total to 342,013.  The point, 
44:1082:83645:14:13:72:538:377:144:Times:144:Times:of course, is that while the data from 1721 onwards is far from perfect, the level of measurement 
44:1083:83743:13:14:72:330:364:144:Times:144:Times:error is not so high as to render the data meaningless. 
44:1084:83799:14:14:72:526:350:144:Times:144:Times: Prior to 725, it is also possible to obtain estimates of the Japanese population based on 
44:1085:83889:14:14:72:534:336:144:Times:144:Times:archeological evidence.  Japan has been populated for at least 10,000 years and there are 28,013 
44:1086:83986:14:14:72:522:322:144:Times:144:Times:archaeological sites from the Jomon period (-8000 to –300) and another 10,530 sites from the 
44:1087:84079:14:13:72:522:308:144:Times:144:Times:Yayoi period (-300 to 300).  Koyama (1978) has divided categorized these sites by prefecture 
44:1088:84172:13:14:72:501:295:144:Times:144:Times:and they can be used to provide a rough idea of the regional distribution of population by 
44:1089:84263:14:14:72:132:281:144:Times:144:Times:prefecture.

44:1094:84299:14:14:72:539:212:144:Times:144:Times: There are two principal sources of information on death and destruction caused by World 
44:1095:84387:14:14:72:494:198:144:Times:144:Times:War II in Japan: the US Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS) (1947) and Nakamura and 
44:1096:84468:14:14:72:499:184:144:Times:144:Times:Miyazaki (1995).  This latter source is basically a reprint of “The Report on Damage and 
44:1097:84557:14:13:72:533:170:144:Times:144:Times:Casualties of World War II” compiled by The Central Economic Stabilization Board (CESB) in 
44:1098:84648:13:14:72:540:157:144:Times:144:Times:1949.  The US source is particularly good for matching death and destruction to particular US air 
44:1099:84746:14:14:72:511:143:144:Times:144:Times:operations, while the Japanese source is a 600-page census of all death and destruction that 
44:1100:84839:14:14:72:536:129:144:Times:144:Times:occurred within Japan proper.  As such, the Japanese source provides a more complete record of 
44:1101:84934:14:14:72:222:115:144:Times:144:Times:how the war affected civilians. 
44:1102:84966:14:13:72:540:101:144:Times:144:Times: Since our primary interest was obtaining information on the magnitude of shocks to cities 
44:1103:85056:13:0:72:541:88:144:Times:144:Times:regardless of the particular air operation that gave rise to it, we felt the Japanese source was more 
45:1104:85160:0:14:72:535:709:144:Times:144:Times:appropriate.  Japanese numbers for casualties and destruction tend to be larger than the numbers 
45:1105:85257:14:14:72:502:695:144:Times:144:Times:reported above for a number of reasons.  First, the USSBS only covers destruction due to 
45:1106:85346:14:14:72:516:681:144:Times:144:Times:planned strategic bombing.  It therefore does not include urban deaths due to other bombing 
45:1107:85438:14:14:72:531:667:144:Times:144:Times:activities, strafing, naval bombardments of coastal cities, and the mining of harbors, nor does it 
45:1108:85537:14:13:72:537:653:144:Times:144:Times:cover destruction arising from accidentally bombing the wrong targets.  Second, US fatality data 
45:1109:85634:13:14:72:539:640:144:Times:144:Times:appear to be only reported for confirmed deaths.  In nuclear bombing and firebombing, it is quite 
45:1110:85732:14:14:72:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:common for thousands, if not tens of thousands of people, to be vaporized.  People who went 
45:1111:85824:14:14:72:536:612:144:Times:144:Times:missing on the day of a bombing raid and did not turn up within several years are not counted as 
45:1112:85921:14:14:72:534:598:144:Times:144:Times:casualties in US sources but are listed as missing in CESB and are added to fatality numbers.22   
45:1113:86019:14:13:72:530:584:144:Times:144:Times:Third, US data does not treat mortally injured people as fatalities, whereas Japanese data does.  
45:1114:86117:13:14:72:538:571:144:Times:144:Times:This is particularly a problem in Hiroshima and Nagasaki where large numbers of people died of 
45:1115:86212:14:14:72:528:557:144:Times:144:Times:radiation poisoning within a few years of the attack.  This helps explain why the CESB reports 
45:1116:86307:14:14:72:506:543:144:Times:144:Times:twice as many fatalities in Nagasaki as USSBS.  A more difficult issue concerns radiation-
45:1117:86397:14:14:72:514:529:144:Times:144:Times:induced deaths in the period between 1949 and 1965.  However, since direct deaths were so 
45:1118:86487:14:13:72:529:515:144:Times:144:Times:large, even high estimates (in the tens of thousands) of the number dying from radiation do not 
45:1119:86583:13:14:72:326:502:144:Times:144:Times:affect our numbers on deaths per capita very much.   
45:1120:86636:14:14:72:528:488:144:Times:144:Times: Population data were taken from the Kanketsu Showa Kokusei Soran.  A key feature of 
45:1121:86720:14:14:72:523:474:144:Times:144:Times:this source is that city areas are held constant across the time period.  This data source reports 
45:1122:86819:14:14:72:514:460:144:Times:144:Times:urban populations for several hundred cities based on censuses every five years.23  The only 
45:1123:86912:14:13:72:537:446:144:Times:144:Times:exception is 1945.  The 1945 census of cities was not performed until 1947 due to the war.  This 
45:1124:87009:13:14:72:528:433:144:Times:144:Times:is actually fortunate for us.  Japanese ground transportation was largely unaffected by the war.  
45:1125:87107:14:14:72:534:419:144:Times:144:Times:This means that by 1947, anyone who had fled due to the fear of air strikes, could have returned 
45:1126:87204:14:14:72:329:405:144:Times:144:Times:provided that housing and employment existed there.

45:1129:87304:8:16:72:533:124:42:Times:99:Times:22 One might worry that the missing category might be capturing something else, but the number of people reported 
45:1130:87418:16:7:72:323:108:99:Times:99:Times:missing in cities not subject to bombing is almost always zero. 
45:1131:87482:7:16:72:532:101:42:Times:99:Times:23 We dropped the city of Kure from our data.  Kure became the site of a major Japanese naval arsenal.  As a result 
45:1132:87598:16:11:72:540:85:99:Times:99:Times:its population rose 50% between 1925 and 1940 as Japan built up its fleet.  Kure was heavily bombed during the war 
45:1133:87713:11:0:72:406:74:99:Times:99:Times:and then returned to its prewar size as demand for naval warships approached zero.
