2:21:889:25:24:107:535:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Since the early Nineties, a dozen states have established broad-based merit aid programs.
2:22:978:24:24:71:519:516:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The typical program waives tuition and fees at public colleges and universities in one’s home
2:23:1071:24:23:71:536:492:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:state. Unlike traditional merit programs, such as the National Merit Scholarship, this aid requires
2:24:1170:23:24:71:525:469:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:relatively modest academic performance and provide scholarships to hundreds of thousands of
2:25:1261:24:24:71:529:445:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:students. This paper examines how merit aid programs in seven states have affected an array of
2:26:1355:24:24:71:505:421:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:schooling decisions, paying particular attention to how the effects have varied by race and
2:27:1446:24:24:71:526:397:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:ethnicity. I find that the new programs typically increase the attendance probability of college-
2:28:1543:24:23:71:539:373:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:age youth by five to seven percentage points. The merit programs also shift students toward four-
2:29:1640:23:24:71:531:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:year schools and away from two-year schools. The Georgia HOPE Scholarship, which has been
2:30:1729:24:24:71:534:326:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:found to widen racial gaps in college attendance (Dynarski, 2000) is atypical in its distributional
2:31:1828:24:24:71:514:302:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:impact, with the other state’s programs tending to have a more positive effect on the college
2:32:1921:24:23:71:519:278:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:attendance rate of Blacks and Hispanics. I attribute HOPE’s unique distributional effect to its
2:33:2016:23:24:71:522:255:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:relatively stringent academic requirements and a recently-eliminated provision that channeled
2:34:2109:24:35:71:355:231:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the most generous scholarships to higher-income students.

3:42:2293:0:27:108:538:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Merit aid, a discount to college costs contingent upon academic performance, is not new. 
3:43:2382:27:28:72:540:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Colleges and private organizations have long rewarded high-achieving high school students with 
3:44:2477:28:27:72:517:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:scholarships and tuition waivers. The privately-funded National Merit Scholarship program, 
3:45:2568:27:28:72:539:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:established in 1955, awards grants to entering college freshmen according to performance on the 
3:46:2664:28:28:72:540:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:PSAT. Colleges, especially private schools, have long used scholarships to capture students with 
3:47:2761:28:27:72:214:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:strong academic credentials.  
3:48:2791:27:28:108:538:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:While merit aid has a long history at private colleges and foundations, it has not played a 
3:49:2883:28:27:72:537:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:major role in the public sector. Historically, federal aid for college has been strongly focused on 
3:50:2983:27:28:72:516:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:low-income students. Eligibility for the two largest federal aid programs, the Pell Grant and 
3:51:3077:28:28:72:523:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Stafford Loan, is determined by a complex formula that defines financial need on the basis of 
3:52:3171:28:27:72:504:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:income, assets and family size. The formula is quite progressive: 90 percent of dependent 
3:53:3261:27:28:72:504:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:students who receive federal grants grew up in families with incomes less than $40,000.1  
3:54:3351:28:27:108:539:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Merit aid has played a similarly minor role at the state level. While most states have long 
3:55:3443:27:28:72:532:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:had some form of merit aid program, it is generally offered to only the very highest-performing 
3:56:3539:28:27:72:515:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:students.  New York state gives $1,500 to the top scorer on the Regents exam in each of the 
3:57:3631:27:28:72:536:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:state’s high schools, and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst offers valedictorians a free 
3:58:3729:28:28:72:536:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:ride if they perform well on an achievement test. While small merit programs like these abound, 
3:59:3825:28:27:72:523:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the vast bulk of state spending on higher education is delivered to students in the form of low 
3:60:3921:27:28:72:506:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:tuition at public colleges. These low sticker prices are made possible by the $50 billion in 
3:61:4014:28:27:72:507:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:subsidies that states annually provide their post-secondary institutions. These institutional 
3:62:4108:27:53:72:530:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:subsidies are highest at the flagship universities, which draw the highest-achieving students. In 
3:63:4206:53:14:72:219:104:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
3:64:4254:14:0:72:447:90:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:1 Calculated from data in National Center for Education Statistics (1998), Table 314. 
4:65:4342:0:27:72:518:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:this sense, these institutional subsidies are, by far, the largest “merit aid” program in the US. 
4:66:4440:27:28:72:494:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Access to this subsidy has traditionally been controlled by the schools themselves, who 
4:67:4528:28:27:72:512:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:determine which students are sufficiently meritorious to gain access to their school. Once a 
4:68:4621:27:28:72:469:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:student was admitted, each student had equal access to their subsidized education. 
4:69:4704:28:28:108:523:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Recently, however, the rules of the game have changed. State legislatures have gotten 
4:70:4790:28:27:72:534:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:into the business of awarding merit to large numbers of students. Since the early Nineties, more 
4:71:4887:27:28:72:507:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:than a dozen states have established broad-based merit aid programs. The typical program 
4:72:4975:28:27:72:536:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:awards tuition and fees to young residents who have maintained a certain grade point average in 
4:73:5071:27:28:72:520:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:high school. Unlike the older merit scholarships, the new programs require relatively modest 
4:74:5164:28:28:72:513:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:academic performance in high school and provide scholarships to hundreds of thousands of 
4:75:5253:28:27:72:539:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:students. Many require a high school grade-point average of 3.0 or above, not a particularly high 
4:76:5351:27:28:72:528:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:threshold: in 1999, 40 percent of high school seniors met this standard.2 Georgia, for example, 
4:77:5447:28:27:72:542:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:gives a free ride at its public colleges and universities to residents who have a GPA of 3.0 in high 
4:78:5548:27:28:72:481:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:school and who maintain that average in college. In Arkansas, the GPA cutoff is 2.5. 
4:79:5633:28:27:108:529:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:This new breed of merit aid differs from the old style in both its breadth and, plausibly, 
4:80:5724:27:28:72:517:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:its effect on students’ decisions. The old style of merit aid was aimed at top students, whose 
4:81:5819:28:28:72:538:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:decision to attend college is not likely contingent upon the receipt of a scholarship. By design, if 
4:82:5920:28:27:72:543:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:not by intent, this elite form of merit aid goes to students whose operative decision is not whether 
4:83:6021:27:28:72:518:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:to attend college, but which high-quality, four-year college to choose.  By contrast, the new, 
4:84:6116:28:27:72:491:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:broad-based  merit aid programs are open to students with solid though not necessarily 
4:85:6203:27:40:72:531:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:exemplary academic records. Such students may be uncertain about whether to go to college at 
4:86:6296:40:14:72:219:117:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
4:87:6344:14:18:72:529:103:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:2 Author’s calculations from the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. As I will discuss later in 
4:88:6448:18:0:72:375:85:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the paper, this figure varies quite dramatically by race and ethnicity. 
5:89:6522:0:27:72:537:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:all. When offered a well-publicized, generous scholarship – the typical program pays full tuition 
5:90:6620:27:28:72:529:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and fees at public colleges – some of these students may decide to give college a try. For those 
5:91:6717:28:27:72:519:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:who would have gone to college even without the scholarship, some may choose a four-year 
5:92:6806:27:28:72:430:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:school over a two-year school, or a private school over a public school.     
5:93:6883:28:28:108:527:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:What are the consequences of this new breed of student aid? A rich array of individual 
5:94:6970:28:27:72:537:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and institutional decisions could potentially be impacted by the presence of a merit aid program. 
5:95:7068:27:28:72:525:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:On the individual level, consider the many types of high school students, and how each might 
5:96:7161:28:27:72:529:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:respond to the offer of a merit scholarship. One youth may not plan to attend college at all; the 
5:97:7259:27:28:72:539:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:offer of merit aid may convince her to try college. Another may be certain he is going to college, 
5:98:7358:28:28:72:527:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:but the offer of merit aid may lead him to choose a four-year college over a two-year college.3 
5:99:7453:28:27:72:539:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Another student who is planning to go to college out of state may instead decide to stay closer to 
5:100:7552:27:28:72:404:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:home so that she can take advantage of her state’s merit scholarship. 
5:101:7622:28:27:108:530:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:This chapter will examine how merit aid affects this array of schooling decisions, using 
5:102:7711:27:28:72:540:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:household survey data to measure the impact of the new state programs.  I start with a case study 
5:103:7809:28:27:72:505:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of the Georgia HOPE Scholarship, the namesake and inspiration of many of the new state 
5:104:7896:27:28:72:509:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:programs. I then extend the analysis to other states that now have broad-based, HOPE-like 
5:105:7986:28:28:72:530:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:programs. In the empirical analysis, I pay particular attention to how the effect of merit aid has 
5:106:8085:28:27:72:212:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:varied by race and ethnicity. 
5:107:8115:27:28:108:534:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Merit aid might affect the decisions of not only students, but of institutions. Do colleges 
5:108:8207:28:27:72:539:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:increase their tuition prices, in order to capture some of the subsidy? Do they reduce other forms 
5:109:8306:27:40:72:518:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of aid? Does the linkage of scholarships to grades lead to grade inflation at high schools and 
5:110:8401:40:14:72:219:117:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
5:111:8449:14:18:72:529:103:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:3 Two-year colleges are generally cheaper than four-year colleges. Most merit aid programs make them 
5:112:8549:18:0:72:117:85:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:both free. 
6:113:8562:0:27:72:538:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:colleges? A number of studies have addressed these questions, and I will review the evidence on 
6:114:8658:27:28:72:531:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:these topics. Finally, I will briefly discuss the political economy of merit aid. Why has it arisen 
6:115:8758:28:27:72:534:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:where it has, and when it has? What are the prospects for its continuation and growth, given the 
6:116:8855:27:28:72:283:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:current, poor fiscal prospects of the states?  
6:117:8902:28:41:72:75:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: 
6:118:8902:41:31:229:386:557:170:g_d0_f6:170:g_d0_f6:State Merit Aid: A Primer 
6:119:8928:31:28:108:528:526:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Broad-based state merit aid became common in a very short span of time. In 1993, just 
6:120:9014:28:28:72:537:498:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:two states, Arkansas and Georgia, had programs in place. By 2002, twelve states had introduced 
6:121:9109:28:27:72:520:470:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:large merit aid programs. Most of this growth has occurred quite recently, with six programs 
6:122:9202:27:28:72:536:443:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:starting up since 1999. As is clear from the map in Figure 1, merit aid is heavily concentrated in 
6:123:9301:28:27:72:499:415:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the southern region of the United States. Of the twelve states with broad-based merit aid 
6:124:9391:27:28:72:515:388:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:programs, nine are in the South. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the twelve broad-
6:125:9483:28:28:72:536:360:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:based merit programs. As was discussed earlier, dozens of states have some form of merit aid in 
6:126:9579:28:27:72:538:332:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:place. The state programs detailed in Table 1 were chosen because they have particularly lenient 
6:127:9676:27:28:72:515:305:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:eligibility criteria, with at least thirty percent of high school students having grades and test 
6:128:9774:28:27:72:227:277:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:scores high enough to qualify.4  
6:129:9807:27:28:108:537:250:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:For example, the Arkansas award requires a GPA of 2.5, a standard met by 60 percent of 
6:130:9894:28:41:72:528:222:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:high school students nationwide. The state also requires a minimum on the ACT of 19, a score 
6:131:9987:41:14:72:219:181:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
6:132:10035:14:18:72:538:167:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:4 The estimates of number eligible are based on data from the NLSY97. Some of the states listed in Table 
6:133:10140:18:12:72:506:149:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:1 do not have enough observations in the NLSY97 to allow state-specific estimates of the share of 
6:134:10238:12:13:72:516:137:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:students whose GPA qualifies them for their state’s merit program. For all states, therefore, I use the 
6:135:10342:13:13:72:535:124:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:national grade distribution to impute the share in a state that meet the eligibility criteria. When available, 
6:136:10453:13:12:72:528:111:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:state-level data on the ACT and SAT are used to measure the share of students who meet these criteria. 
6:137:10556:12:13:72:537:99:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Note that these estimates are used only to choose the merit programs to  be analyzed; they are not used in 
6:138:10663:13:0:72:214:86:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the paper’s regression analyses. 
7:139:10698:0:27:72:530:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:exceeded by 60 percent of test-takers nationwide and well below the Arkansas state average of 
7:140:10792:27:28:72:528:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:20.4.  Five other states, like Arkansas, condition eligibility on a minimum GPA and test score. 
7:141:10888:28:27:72:539:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Six states use only GPA to determine eligibility. Of the states that require a minimum GPA, four 
7:142:10985:27:28:72:532:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:require a GPA of 3.0, while two make awards to those with a GPA of 2.5, a standard met by 60 
7:143:11078:28:28:72:282:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:percent of high school seniors nationwide.  
7:144:11122:28:27:108:543:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Only one state – Michigan – bases eligibility solely on standardized test performance. For 
7:145:11213:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the class of 2000, 31 percent of Michigan students had scores sufficiently high to merit an award. 
7:146:11312:28:27:72:538:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:However, this overall eligibility rate masks substantial heterogeneity: just 7.9 percent of African 
7:147:11412:27:28:72:526:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:American students met the Michigan requirement.  Civil rights groups have protested that this 
7:148:11506:28:28:72:536:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:wide gap in eligibility indicates that Michigan’s achievement test is an inappropriate instrument 
7:149:11604:28:27:72:539:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:with which to determine eligibility for a state-funded scholarship. Similar objections were raised 
7:150:11703:27:28:72:481:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:in Arkansas, which initially based eligibility for its program only on performance on 
7:151:11789:28:27:72:510:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:standardized tests but later broadened the criteria to include academic performance in high 
7:152:11881:27:28:72:112:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:school.  
7:153:11890:28:27:108:537:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:These controversies point to a shared characteristic of merit programs: their scholarships 
7:154:11981:27:28:72:493:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:flow disproportionately to white and upper-income students. One reason is that Blacks, 
7:155:12068:28:28:72:513:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Hispanics and low-income youth are relatively unlikely to attend college, so any subsidy to 
7:156:12160:28:27:72:519:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:college students will flow disproportionately to white, upper-income youth. But even among 
7:157:12251:27:28:72:536:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:those non-white, low-income youth who do attend college, academic performance is a barrier to 
7:158:12345:28:27:72:522:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:merit aid eligibility. For merit programs that are based on standardized test performance, it is 
7:159:12442:27:28:72:517:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:unsurprising to see (as in Michigan) a large gap in the eligibility rates of whites and African-
7:160:12538:28:28:72:484:129:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Americans, as the correlation between standardized test performance and race is well-
7:161:12623:28:0:72:525:101:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:documented. However, even those programs with only a GPA cutoff will produce large racial 
8:162:12715:0:27:72:525:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:differences in eligibility. Forty percent of high school seniors have a 3.0 GPA or higher while 
8:163:12811:27:28:72:511:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:only 15 percent of African Americans and Hispanics meet this standard. In Georgia, where 
8:164:12900:28:27:72:500:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:renewal of the scholarship is contingent on academic performance in college, Blacks are 
8:165:12988:27:28:72:466:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:substantially less likely than whites to renew, as their college grades are too low.  
8:166:13074:28:28:108:521:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:For all of these reasons, the merit programs are likely to have a differential impact by 
8:167:13163:28:27:72:531:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:race and ethnicity. Since non-white youth are less likely to qualify, it is plausible that merit aid 
8:168:13264:27:28:72:537:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:programs will have little positive impact upon their college attendance. Further, if the new merit 
8:169:13363:28:27:72:529:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:aid crowds out state spending on need-based aid or leads to higher tuition prices, the programs 
8:170:13459:27:28:72:528:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:may actually decrease low-income, non-white college attendance, since these populations will 
8:171:13552:28:28:72:507:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:face the resulting cost increases but will be disproportionately ineligible for the new merit 
8:172:13646:28:27:72:140:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:scholarships.

8:174:13661:41:32:171:444:364:170:g_d0_f6:170:g_d0_f6:Case Study: The Georgia Hope Scholarship 
8:175:13702:32:27:108:510:332:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:In 1991, Georgia Governor Zell Miller requested that the state’s General Assembly 
8:176:13784:27:28:72:526:305:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:consider the establishment of a state-run lottery, with the proceeds to be devoted to education. 
8:177:13881:28:27:72:529:277:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The Georgia General Assembly passed lottery-enabling legislation during its 1992 session and 
8:178:13974:27:28:72:531:250:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:forwarded the issue to voters, who approved the required amendment to the state’s constitution 
8:179:14069:28:28:72:528:222:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:in November of 1992. The first lottery tickets were sold in June of 1993. $2.5 billion in lottery 
8:180:14167:28:27:72:508:194:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:revenue has flowed into Georgia’s educational institutions since 1993. The legislation and 
8:181:14258:27:28:72:520:167:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:amendment enabling the lottery specified that the new funds were not to crowd out spending 
8:182:14349:28:27:72:526:139:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:from traditional sources. While it is not possible to establish conclusively that such crowd-out 
8:183:14446:27:28:72:525:112:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:has not occurred, spending on education has risen substantially since the lottery was initiated, 
8:184:14543:28:0:72:523:84:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:both in absolute dollars and as a share of total state spending. Roughly equal shares of lottery 
9:185:14642:0:27:72:527:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:funds have gone to four programs: the HOPE Scholarship, educational technology for primary 
9:186:14733:27:28:72:470:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and secondary schools, a new pre-kindergarten program, and school construction.  
9:187:14814:28:27:108:531:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Residents who have graduated since 1993 from Georgia high schools with at least a 3.0 
9:188:14900:27:28:72:528:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:grade point average are eligible for HOPE.5 The first scholarships were disbursed in the fall of 
9:189:14997:28:28:71:540:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:1993. Participation in HOPE during its first year was limited to those with family incomes below 
9:190:15094:28:27:71:538:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:$66,000; the income cap was raised to $100,000 in 1994 and eliminated in 1995. HOPE pays for 
9:191:15187:27:28:71:527:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:tuition and required fees at Georgia’s public colleges and universities. Those attending private 
9:192:15284:28:27:71:540:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:colleges are eligible for an annual grant, which was $500 in 1993 and had increased to $3,000 by 
9:193:15381:27:28:71:525:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:1996. These amounts are offset by other sources of aid. A student who receives the maximum 
9:194:15472:28:28:71:522:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Pell Grant gets no HOPE Scholarship but receives a yearly book allowance of $400.6 A $500 
9:195:15562:28:27:72:516:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:education voucher is available to those who complete a General Education Diploma (GED). 
9:196:15650:27:28:72:484:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Public college students must maintain a GPA of 3.0 to keep the scholarship; a similar 
9:197:15736:28:27:72:384:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:requirement was introduced for private school students in 1996.  
9:198:15801:27:28:108:539:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Georgia education officials, concerned that students would forgo applying for federal aid 
9:199:15891:28:27:72:525:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:once the HOPE Scholarship was available, created an application process designed to prevent 
9:200:15983:27:28:72:501:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:this outcome. Those from families with adjusted gross incomes lower than $50,000 must 
9:201:16069:28:36:72:541:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) in order to apply for HOPE; the

9:203:16211:14:18:72:512:217:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:5 The high school GPA requirement is waived for those enrolled in certificate programs at technical 
9:204:16311:18:12:72:523:199:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:institutes. For high school seniors graduating after 2000, only courses in English, math, social studies, 
9:205:16417:12:20:72:367:187:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:science and foreign languages count toward the GPA requirement. 
9:206:16481:20:18:72:511:167:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:6 As a result of this provision and the scaling back of the state’s need-based State Student Incentive 
9:207:16584:18:12:72:540:149:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Grants (SSIGs), some low-income students have actually seen their state aid reduced slightly since HOPE 
9:208:16688:12:13:72:495:137:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:was introduced (Jaffe, 1997). This contemporaneous shift in SSIG spending has the potential to 
9:209:16783:13:13:72:534:124:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:contaminate the paper’s estimates, especially the specifications in which low-income youth are used as a 
9:210:16888:13:12:72:541:111:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:control group for upper-income youth. However, SSIG spending was so miniscule – $5.2 million in 1995, 
9:211:16990:12:13:72:498:99:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:before the program was scaled back – that the impact of its elimination on the estimates is likely 
9:212:17088:13:0:72:147:86:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:inconsequential. 
10:213:17107:0:27:72:533:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:rationale for the $50,000 income threshold is that few students above that cutoff are eligible for 
10:214:17206:27:28:72:535:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:need-based federal aid.7 The four-page FAFSA requests detailed income, expense, asset and tax 
10:215:17300:28:27:72:530:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:data from the family. Those with family incomes above $50,000 fill out a short, one-page form 
10:216:17393:27:28:72:511:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:that requires no information about finances other than a confirmation that family income is 
10:217:17485:28:28:72:505:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:indeed above the cutoff.  As a consequence of these provisions, low-income students face 
10:218:17574:28:27:72:423:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:relatively high transaction costs and relatively low average scholarships. 
10:219:17649:27:28:108:521:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:In 2000-2001, 75,000 students received $277 million in HOPE Scholarships. Georgia 
10:220:17731:28:27:72:512:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:politicians have deemed HOPE a great success, pointing to the steady rise in the number of 
10:221:17822:27:28:72:542:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:college students receiving HOPE. The key question is whether the program is actually increasing 
10:222:17918:28:28:72:532:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:college attendance or simply subsidizing students who would have attended college even in the 
10:223:18012:28:27:72:513:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:absence of HOPE. In the next section, I discuss the data and empirical strategy I will use to 
10:224:18106:27:41:72:179:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:answer this question.  
10:225:18129:41:32:291:323:364:170:g_d0_f6:170:g_d0_f6:Data 
10:226:18134:32:27:108:511:332:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Any empirical analysis of state financial aid policy quickly comes face to face with 
10:227:18219:27:28:72:537:305:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:frustrating data limitations. The data requirements appear minor, since eligibility for merit aid is 
10:228:18320:28:27:72:521:277:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:determined by a very short list of characteristics: state of residence at the time of high school 
10:229:18418:27:28:72:539:250:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:graduation, high school grade point average, standardized test score and, in some states, parental 
10:230:18517:28:28:72:519:222:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:income. In order to use this information in an evaluation of the effect of merit aid, we would 
10:231:18612:28:27:72:517:194:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:want these characteristics for repeated cohorts of high school students, both before and after 
10:232:18707:27:37:72:540:167:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:merit aid is introduced in their state, so that schooling decisions of eligible and ineligible cohorts 
10:233:18810:37:14:72:219:130:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
10:234:18858:14:17:72:515:116:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:7 In 1995, only 3.7 percent of dependent students from families with incomes over $40,000 received 
10:235:18957:17:13:72:523:99:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:federal grant aid, while 57 percent of those from families with income under $20,000 did so (National 
10:236:19059:13:0:72:251:86:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Center for Education Statistics, 1998a).  
11:237:19103:0:27:72:533:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:can be compared.8 Finally, we need a dataset with state-level samples large enough to allow for 
11:238:19199:27:28:72:178:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:informative analysis.  
11:239:19222:28:27:108:536:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:No publicly-available dataset meets all of these requirements. Surveys that are limited to 
11:240:19313:27:28:72:533:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:college students do not, by their nature, allow us to examine the college attendance margin. For 
11:241:19410:28:28:72:518:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:example, the National Postsecondary Student Aid Survey (NPSAS) surveys college students 
11:242:19498:28:27:72:526:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:about their aid packages and contains detailed information from students’ aid applications. By 
11:243:19593:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:design, this dataset cannot inform us about those students who did not decide to go to college and 
11:244:19692:28:27:72:528:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the aid packages that they faced. Without making strong assumptions about how those who do 
11:245:19783:27:28:72:542:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:not go to college differ from those who do, we cannot use NPSAS to examine how aid affects the 
11:246:19878:28:28:72:204:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:college attendance margin. 
11:247:19905:28:27:108:518:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:NPSAS can be used to answer other questions of interest, however. For example, we 
11:248:19987:27:28:72:484:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:might be interested in whether merit aid leads to higher tuition prices, or more or less 
11:249:20076:28:27:72:499:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:government spending on other forms of aid. Or, we might be interested in how the racial 
11:250:20164:27:28:72:531:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:composition of a state’s schools changes, if at all, after the introduction of a merit aid program. 
11:251:20264:28:27:72:538:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:NPSAS, as well as data that institutions gather about their students and report to the government 
11:252:20362:27:28:72:534:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:through the Integrated Postsecondary Data System (IPEDS), can answer questions of this type.9 
11:253:20455:28:76:72:540:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Later in the paper, I use data from both IPEDS and the University System of Georgia to examine 
11:254:20550:76:14:72:219:191:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
11:255:20598:14:18:72:534:177:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:8 Alternatively, we could make use of the sharp discontinuities in the eligibility requirements to estimate 
11:256:20706:18:12:72:491:159:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the effect of merit aid from a single cohort. Kane (2002) uses this approach in an evaluation of 
11:257:20803:12:13:72:529:147:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:California’s CalGrant program, comparing the college attendance of those very slightly above and very 
11:258:20904:13:13:72:490:134:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:slightly below the grade point cutoff. This approach requires very large samples; Kane uses an 
11:259:20999:13:18:72:390:121:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:administrative dataset that is a near-census of potential college entrants. 
11:260:21075:18:18:72:514:103:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:9 Papers that use college-based surveys in this way include Long (2002) and Cornwell, Mustard and 
11:261:21173:18:0:72:389:85:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Sridhar (2002), both of which evaluate the Georgia HOPE Scholarship. 
12:262:21245:0:27:72:531:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:how HOPE has affected tuition policy and the student composition of Georgia’s postsecondary

12:264:21346:28:27:108:512:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth of 1979 and 1997 are particularly rich 
12:265:21428:27:28:72:511:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:sources of data, containing information about academic performance on standardized tests, 
12:266:21518:28:28:72:538:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:grades, parental income, and schooling decisions.10  In a few years, the NLSY97 will be a useful 
12:267:21615:28:27:72:495:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:resource for evaluating the newer merit aid programs, in particular those that have been 
12:268:21704:27:28:72:518:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:introduced since the late Nineties. The only weakness of the NLSY97 is that it is unlikely to 
12:269:21798:28:27:72:529:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:interview enough youth in any one state to allow for detailed examination of a single merit aid 
12:270:21894:27:28:72:533:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:program. Observations from multiple merit states could be pooled, however, as is done in some 
12:271:21988:28:28:72:181:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:analyses in this paper. 
12:272:22012:28:27:108:523:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Another potentially fruitful option for research in this area is data from administrative 
12:273:22102:27:28:72:515:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:sources. Kane (2002) and Henry and Rubinstein (2002) take this approach in evaluations of 
12:274:22192:28:27:72:496:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:programs in California and Georgia, respectively.11 Kane matches enrollment data from 
12:275:22277:27:28:72:493:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:California’s public universities and colleges to federal aid applications and high school 
12:276:22367:28:27:72:494:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:transcripts. He then uses regression-discontinuity methodology to estimate the effect of 
12:277:22456:27:28:72:519:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:California’s merit program on schooling decisions. Henry and Rubinstein uses data from the 
12:278:22547:28:28:72:511:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:College Board on high school grades and SAT scores in order to examine whether Georgia 
12:279:22634:28:61:72:308:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:HOPE has led to grade inflation in high schools.

12:281:22731:14:17:72:532:164:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:10 The US Department of Education’s longitudinal surveys of the high school cohorts of 1972, 1982 and 
12:282:22833:17:13:72:528:147:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:1992 contain similarly rich data. But because each survey contains a single cohort, we cannot use these

12:284:23035:13:18:72:130:121:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:introduced.   
12:285:23049:18:18:72:514:103:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:11 California’s program is not among the dozen programs evaluated in this chapter, as it is relatively 
12:286:23151:18:0:72:505:85:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:narrow in its scope due to income provisions that exclude many middle- and upper-income youth.

13:288:23316:27:28:108:536:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The bulk of the analysis in this paper is based on a publicly-available survey dataset, the 
13:289:23408:28:27:72:522:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Current Population Survey (CPS). The CPS is a national household survey that each October 
13:290:23498:27:28:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:gathers detailed information about schooling enrollment. Data on type of school attended, as well 
13:291:23596:28:28:72:539:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:as basic demographics such as age, race and ethnicity, are included in the CPS. While the CPS is 
13:292:23693:28:27:72:514:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the world’s premier labor force survey, from the perspective of this chapter it has some key 
13:293:23786:27:28:72:129:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:omissions.  
13:294:23798:28:27:108:514:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:First, the CPS lacks information about academic performance.  We therefore cannot 
13:295:23880:27:28:72:516:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:narrow the analysis to those whose academic performance makes them eligible, and thereby 
13:296:23969:28:28:72:520:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:measure the effect on schooling decisions of offering a scholarship to those who are eligible. 
13:297:24064:28:27:72:538:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:From a policy perspective, the question we can answer is quite relevant: How does the existence 
13:298:24160:27:28:72:540:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of a merit aid program affect the schooling decisions of a state’s youth? To answer this question, 
13:299:24259:28:30:72:539:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:I will estimate a program effect (denoted ) that is the product of two interesting parameters: 1) 
13:300:24357:30:28:82:535:347:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:, the behavioral response to the offer of aid of youth eligible for the scholarship and 2) δ, the 
13:301:24455:28:0:72:276:319:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:share of youth eligible for the scholarship:
13:302:24499:0:30:273:280:377:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:β
13:303:24500:30:22:73:80:347:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:π

13:305:24503:33:30:306:345:292:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f4:βπδ= 
13:306:24507:30:28:72:531:262:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:When considering the effect of a financial aid program such as the Pell Grant, we generally are 
13:307:24603:28:28:72:513:234:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:interested only in π. We assume that the parameters that determine Pell-eligibility, such as 
13:308:24696:28:27:72:515:206:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:family size and income, cannot easily be manipulated by those eager to obtain the grant. By 
13:309:24788:27:49:72:539:179:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:contrast, merit aid is a program that intends to induce behavior that will increase the share that is 
13:310:24890:49:14:72:219:130:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
13:311:24938:14:18:72:536:116:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:12 This formulation ignores heterogeneity in the effect of the offer of aid to those who are eligible (). It 
13:312:25047:18:13:72:508:98:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:is almost certain that this effect differs for those whose grades place them just on the margin of aid 
13:313:25150:13:0:72:451:85:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:eligibility and those whose grades are so strong that they are well within this margin.  
13:314:25239:0:0:508:515:111:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:π
14:315:25243:0:27:72:534:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:aid-eligible. Policy-makers consistently cite their desire to give students a financial incentive to 
14:316:25344:27:28:72:521:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:work hard in high school and college as their motivation for establishing merit aid programs. 
14:317:25438:28:28:72:542:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Estimating π while ignoring δ would therefore miss half the story. Fortunately, data constraints 
14:318:25535:28:27:72:254:625:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:prevent us from making this mistake! 
14:319:25572:27:28:108:520:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A more serious weakness of the CPS is it provides family background data for only a 
14:320:25656:28:28:72:514:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:subset of youth. Parental income, parental education and other measures of socio-economic 
14:321:25746:28:27:72:515:542:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:status are available only for those youth who live with their families or who are temporarily 
14:322:25840:27:28:72:527:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:away at college.13 The probability that a youth has family background information available is 
14:323:25935:28:27:72:527:487:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:therefore a function of her propensity to attend college. Under these circumstances, we cannot 
14:324:26030:27:28:72:542:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:limit the analysis to those who have family background data, as this will produce bias in analyses 
14:325:26129:28:27:72:542:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:in which college attendance is an outcome of interest.14 In the analysis, therefore, I will make use

14:328:26293:28:27:72:378:349:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Is State of Residence Systematically Mismeasured in the CPS?  
14:329:26355:27:28:108:519:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A final weakness of the CPS is that it explicitly identifies neither the state in which a 
14:330:26445:28:27:72:537:294:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:person attended high school nor the state in which she attends college.  In this paper, I proxy for 
14:331:26545:27:28:72:500:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the state in which a person attended high school with current state of residence. This is a 
14:332:26637:28:28:72:533:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:reasonable proxy, for two reasons. First, in a population this young, migration across state lines 
14:333:26736:28:70:72:532:211:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:for reasons other than college is minimal. Second, when a youth does go out of state to college, 
14:334:26833:70:14:72:219:141:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
14:335:26881:14:17:72:542:127:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:13 These youth appear on their parents’ CPS record, and so can be linked to parental data. Other youth will 
14:336:26989:17:19:72:327:110:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:show up in the CPS as members of their own households. 
14:337:27044:19:0:72:302:91:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:14 Cameron and Heckman (1999) discuss this point. 
15:338:27097:0:27:72:533:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:CPS coding standards are that she is recorded as a resident of her state of origin, rather than the 
15:339:27197:27:28:72:242:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:state in which she attends college.  
15:340:27234:28:27:108:527:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The key question is whether these standards are followed in practice. We are confident 
15:341:27321:27:28:72:521:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:that this protocol has been followed for those youth (78% of the sample) who appear on their 
15:342:27414:28:28:72:541:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:parents’ record. 15 Whether the CPS correctly captures the state of residence for the other 22%  is 
15:343:27514:28:27:72:526:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:an important question, as error in the collection of these data will bias the chapter’s estimates. 
15:344:27613:27:28:108:531:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:If state of residence is simply a noisy measure of state of origin for these 22% of youth, 
15:345:27704:28:27:72:522:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:then the paper’s estimates will be biased toward zero. But consider the following scenario, in 
15:346:27799:27:28:72:542:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:which we will be biased toward finding a positive effect of merit aid on the probability of college 
15:347:27899:28:28:71:523:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:attendance. Say that HOPE has no effect on the college entry margin, but does affect whether 
15:348:27992:28:27:71:531:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:students go to college in-state. If the CPS incorrectly codes the state of residence as the state in 
15:349:28093:27:28:71:524:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:which one is attending college, then the drop in the out-migration of Georgia college students 
15:350:28188:28:27:71:533:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:will mechanically induce an increase in the observed share of Georgia youth attending college.  
15:351:28284:27:28:107:538:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A few simple tabulations can give us a sense of whether this is a problem. If the scenario 
15:352:28375:28:27:71:543:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:laid out in the previous paragraph holds, then we should observe relative growth in the size of the 
15:353:28475:27:28:71:534:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:college-age population in Georgia after HOPE is introduced. To test this hypothesis, I predicted 
15:354:28572:28:28:71:528:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the size of Georgia’s college-age population by aging forward the high-school-age population. 
15:355:28666:28:27:71:543:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Specifically, I compared the population of 18-to 19-year-olds in a given state to the population of 
15:356:28766:27:28:71:537:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:16- to 17-year-olds in the same state two years earlier.  This is an admittedly crude prediction of 
15:357:28865:28:27:71:528:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:cohort size. It will be wrong for any number of reasons, among them immigration, variation in 
15:358:28959:27:40:71:503:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the size of cohorts at birth and incarceration (prisons are not in the CPS sampling frame). 
15:359:29051:40:14:71:219:117:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
15:360:29099:14:18:72:533:103:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:15 We cannot restrict the analytical sample to this subset because, as discussed above, whether a youth is 
15:361:29206:18:0:72:365:85:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:on her parents’ record is correlated with whether she is in college. 
16:362:29278:0:27:72:530:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:However, the relevant issue is not how error-ridden this prediction is, but whether the sign and 
16:363:29375:27:28:72:529:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:magnitude of its error changes systematically when a merit program is introduced in a state. In 
16:364:29471:28:27:72:543:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:particular, does the population of college-age youth expand unexpectedly when a state introduces 
16:365:29568:27:28:72:160:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:a merit program?  
16:366:29586:28:28:108:516:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Figure A plots the difference between the predicted and actual cohort sizes, with the 
16:367:29672:28:27:72:521:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:difference normed by the predicted size. I plot the normed error for Georgia, and the average 
16:368:29766:27:28:72:517:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:normed error for the other states in the Southeast and the US.16 For measurement error to be 
16:369:29859:28:27:71:542:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:inducing positive bias in the paper’s estimates, the errors should grow relatively more negative in 
16:370:29959:27:28:71:516:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Georgia after HOPE is introduced. There is no such clear trend. The large negative errors in 
16:371:30052:28:28:71:519:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Georgia in 1993 through 1995 are somewhat disturbing, even though a muted version of this 
16:372:30142:28:27:71:527:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:pattern also appears in the US and Southeastern series. In Figure B, I show the same series for 
16:373:30238:27:28:71:537:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:West Virginia, a southern state that had no merit program during this period. This state’s pattern 
16:374:30337:28:27:71:512:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:is almost identical to that of Georgia, suggesting that Georgia’s shifts in cohort size are not 
16:375:30433:27:28:71:536:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:driven by the availability of merit aid and that the paper’s estimates will not be contaminated by 
16:376:30532:28:27:71:164:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:this source of bias.

16:379:30601:14:18:72:530:177:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:16 That is, I calculate the prediction error for each state-year and divide it by the predicted value for that 
16:380:30712:18:12:72:541:159:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:state-year. I take the average of these normed, state-year errors separately for the Southeastern US and the 
16:381:30821:12:13:72:531:147:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:entire US, in both cases excluding Georgia. Each state-year is treated as a single observation; I have not 
16:382:30928:13:24:72:181:134:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:weighted by population. 
16:383:30952:24:12:72:540:110:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:The Georgia series is substantially more volatile than those of the Southeast and US; however, any state’s 
16:384:31059:12:13:72:533:98:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:error will look volatile compared to averages for the region and country. See Figure B for an example of 
16:385:31164:13:0:72:181:85:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:an equally volatile state.

17:387:31216:42:24:72:531:665:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:I begin by examining how the college attendance rate has changed in Georgia since HOPE was 
17:388:31307:24:24:72:539:641:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:introduced, compared to how it has evolved in the other Southern states that have not introduced 
17:389:31404:24:24:72:539:617:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:merit programs. The outcome of interest is whether an 18- to 19-year-old is currently enrolled in 
17:390:31502:24:24:72:504:593:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:college. I start with a parsimonious specification, in which an indicator variable for being 
17:391:31595:24:23:72:536:569:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:enrolled in college is regressed against a set of state, year and age effects, along with a variable, 
17:392:31697:23:24:109:537:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:, that is set to one in survey years 1993 through 2000 for those who are from Georgia. In 
17:393:31787:24:25:71:535:522:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:this equation, the  variable therefore indicates that a young person of college age resides 
17:394:31879:25:0:71:262:497:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:in Georgia after HOPE is in operation.

17:405:32393:76:24:108:512:329:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Recall that HOPE a) decreases the price of college b) decreases the price of in-state

17:407:32580:24:24:72:501:281:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:to two-year colleges. The corresponding predicted behaviors for Georgia residents are a) 
17:408:32669:24:24:72:510:257:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:increased probability of college attendance, b) increased probability of in-state attendance, 
17:409:32763:24:24:72:540:233:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:relative to out-of-state attendance and c) increased probability of four-year attendance relative to

17:412:32975:24:24:72:536:161:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:college attendance rate in Georgia rose 8.6 percentage points relative to the other Southern, non-
17:413:33073:24:24:72:540:137:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:merit  states after HOPE was introduced. The estimate is highly significant, with a standard error 
17:414:33172:24:0:72:529:113:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of 0.8 percentage points. This estimate is quite close to the estimate in Dynarski (2000), which 
18:415:33272:0:24:72:493:698:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:was based on CPS data for 1989 through 1997.17 The result suggests that HOPE did, as 
18:416:33357:24:24:72:343:674:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:predicted, increase the share of youth attending college. 
18:417:33415:24:24:108:532:650:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:I next probe the robustness of this result by adding a set of covariates to this regression. 
18:418:33508:24:24:72:536:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:For reasons discussed earlier, I limit myself to covariates that are available for the entire sample 
18:419:33609:24:24:72:539:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and exclude any that require that a youth and her parents appear on the same survey record, such 
18:420:33706:24:24:72:491:578:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:as parental education and income. Control variables indicate whether a youth lives in a 
18:421:33794:24:24:72:539:554:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:metropolitan area, is African-American, or is Hispanic. These three variables are each interacted 
18:422:33892:24:24:72:510:530:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:with a full set of year effects, so that the effect of these attributes on schooling decisions is 
18:423:33990:24:24:72:533:506:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:allowed to vary flexibly over time. I also include the state’s unemployment rate and the median 
18:424:34086:24:24:72:530:482:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:income of families with children who are near college age. These two variables are intended to 
18:425:34181:24:24:72:503:458:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:capture any Georgia-specific economic shocks that may have affected college attendance 
18:426:34268:24:24:72:536:434:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:decisions. Results are in Column (2). The coefficient does not change, though the standard error 
18:427:34365:24:24:72:242:410:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f8:increases to 1.3 percentage points.. 
18:428:34401:24:24:108:543:386:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:I next examine whether the effect of merit aid extends across state borders. Since students 
18:429:34493:24:24:72:532:362:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:travel across state lines for college, changes in postsecondary education policy in one state will 
18:430:34592:24:24:72:518:338:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:reverberate in neighboring states. If more Georgians want to go to college, and the supply of 
18:431:34686:24:24:72:512:314:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:colleges is inelastic, students from Florida, for example, will be pushed out of school when 
18:432:34779:24:31:72:362:290:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:HOPE is introduced.  The estimating equation is as follows:

18:435:34903:23:25:80:528:208:49:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:3β captures the effect of having a merit program in a neighboring state. Results are in Column 
18:436:34998:25:24:72:543:183:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:(3). The results weakly suggest that having a merit program on one’s border has a small, negative 
18:437:35096:24:29:72:535:159:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:effect on college attendance, indicating the presence of supply constraints. The point estimate is 
18:438:35195:29:14:72:219:130:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
18:439:35243:14:17:72:497:116:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:17 The standard error is substantially smaller, however. In Dynarski (2000), standard errors were 
18:440:35341:17:13:72:535:99:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:conservatively corrected for correlation at the state-year level. Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan (2001) 
18:441:35448:13:0:72:523:86:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:conclude that, in this type of application, the appropriate correction is for correlation at the state level. 
19:442:35561:0:24:72:502:698:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:fairly imprecise, however: -0.5 percentage points, with a standard error of 1.3 percentage 
19:443:35652:24:24:72:118:674:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:points.18  
19:444:35663:24:24:108:540:650:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:An identifying assumption of the preceding analysis is that Georgia and the control states 
19:445:35754:24:24:72:518:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:were on similar trends in their college attendance rates before HOPE was introduced. If they 
19:446:35847:24:24:72:520:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:were instead on divergent trends the estimates will be biased. In particular, if attendance was 
19:447:35943:24:24:72:537:578:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:rising in Georgia relative to the other states pre-1993, then we will falsely attribute to HOPE the 
19:448:36043:24:24:72:498:554:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:continuation of this trend. The inclusion of these pre-existing trends in the equation will 
19:449:36135:24:24:72:513:530:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:eliminate this source of bias. In Column (4), I add to the regression separate time trends for 
19:450:36230:24:24:72:488:506:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Georgia and the rest of non-merit states.19 The point estimate drops moderately, to 6.9 
19:451:36318:24:24:72:514:482:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:percentage points, indicating that Georgia was trending away from the rest of the South pre-
19:452:36410:24:24:72:540:458:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:HOPE. However, there is still a substantial relative increase in attendance in Georgia that cannot 
19:453:36509:24:24:72:205:434:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:be explained by this trend.

19:456:36574:27:28:108:499:369:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:I next examine whether HOPE has affected decisions other than college entry. In 
19:457:36654:28:27:72:511:341:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:particular, I examine the type of college that a student chooses to attend. The October CPS 
19:458:36746:27:28:72:542:314:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:contains information about whether a student attends a public or private college, and whether it is 
19:459:36846:28:28:72:517:286:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:a two- or four-year institution. I use this information to construct four variables that indicate 
19:460:36944:28:27:72:539:258:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:whether a person attends a two-year private school, a two-year public school, a four-year private 
19:461:37042:27:28:72:538:231:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:school, or a four-year public school. I then run a series of four regressions in which these are the 
19:462:37143:28:50:72:537:203:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:outcomes, including the same covariates as in the richest specification of Table 2. I show results 
19:463:37242:50:14:72:219:153:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
19:464:37290:14:18:72:536:139:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:18 I have also tested the inclusion of the interaction of having a merit program in one’s own state and in a 
19:465:37399:18:12:72:540:121:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:neighboring state. The interaction is never large or significant and its inclusion does not affect the paper’s 
19:466:37510:12:19:72:118:109:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:estimates. 
19:467:37521:19:0:72:307:90:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:19 The time trends are estimated using pre-1993 data. 
20:468:37578:0:27:72:523:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:that both do and do not include time trends. The results are shown in Table 3. The attendance 
20:469:37672:27:28:72:478:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:results of previous table are included for ease of comparison with the choice results. 
20:470:37759:28:27:108:527:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:HOPE appears to increase the probability of attendance at four-year public institutions 
20:471:37847:27:28:72:529:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:substantially, from 4.5 percentage points (no time trends) to 8.4 percentage points (time trends 
20:472:37944:28:28:72:485:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:included). Attendance at four-year private schools also rises, though the estimates are 
20:473:38032:28:27:72:512:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:substantially smaller (2.2 to 2.8 percentage points). There is a somewhat smaller rise in the 
20:474:38126:27:28:72:537:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:probability of attendance at two-year private schools (about 1.5 percentage points) and a drop at 
20:475:38224:28:27:72:503:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:two-year public schools (of 1.7 to 5.5 percentage points). All but two of the estimates are 
20:476:38316:27:28:72:237:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:significant at conventional levels. 
20:477:38352:28:28:108:534:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:These shifts in schooling decisions are in the expected direction. Any subsidy to college 
20:478:38442:28:27:72:531:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:will both push students into two-year public schools (from not going to college at all) and push 
20:479:38539:27:28:72:535:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:them out (into four-year colleges). HOPE appears to push more students out of two-year, public 
20:480:38634:28:27:72:542:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:institutions than it pushes in, producing a net drop at these schools. Most of these students appear 
20:481:38735:27:28:72:521:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:to shift toward four-year public institutions, though some also shift into the private sector.20

20:484:38877:27:28:107:536:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:We might expect that HOPE would also affect whether students choose to attend college 
20:485:38963:28:27:71:529:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:in their home state. Data from both the data from the University System of Georgia (USG) and 
20:486:39056:27:28:71:535:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the Department of Education’s Residence and Migration Survey suggest that HOPE has had the 
20:487:39147:28:27:71:541:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:effect of encouraging Georgia residents who would have attended a four-year college out of state 
20:488:39244:27:27:71:532:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:to stay in Georgia instead. Data from the Residence and Migration Survey indicate that in 1992 
20:489:39339:27:14:71:219:130:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
20:490:39387:14:17:72:521:116:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:20 Note that the coefficients for the four schooling options do not sum to the overall attendance effect. 
20:491:39493:17:13:72:513:99:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:This is because the type of school is unknown for some student, and they therefore do not appear as 
20:492:39593:13:0:72:202:86:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:attending any type of school. 
21:493:39626:0:27:72:520:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:about 5,000 Georgians were freshmen at two- and four-year colleges in the states that border 
21:494:39719:27:28:72:528:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Georgia. This represented an average of 3.4 percent of the border states’ freshmen enrollment. 
21:495:39814:28:27:72:542:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:By 1998, just 4,500 Georgians crossed state lines to enter college in the border states, accounting 
21:496:39914:27:28:72:535:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:for an average of 2.9 percent of freshmen enrollment in those states. This drop in migration was 
21:497:40011:28:28:72:500:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:concentrated in a group of border schools that have traditionally drawn large numbers of 
21:498:40100:28:27:72:537:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Georgians. At the ten border schools drawing the most Georgia freshmen in 1992, students from 
21:499:40193:27:28:72:522:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Georgia numbered 1,900 and averaged 17 percent of the freshman class. By 1998, the ten top 
21:500:40284:28:27:72:523:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:destinations enrolled 1,700 Georgians, who represented nine percent of freshman enrollment. 
21:501:40376:27:28:72:521:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Jacksonville State College in Florida, for example, drew 189 Georgian freshmen in 1992 and 
21:502:40467:28:28:72:525:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:only 89 in 1998; the share of the freshman class from Georgia dropped from 17 to 11 percent. 
21:503:40560:28:27:108:541:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Further supporting the conclusion that Georgia’s four-year college students are now more 
21:504:40649:27:28:72:527:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:likely to attend college in state is a shift in the composition of Georgia’s four-year colleges. In 
21:505:40749:28:27:72:536:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Figure 4 shows data from the USG on the share of freshmen enrollees that are Georgia residents 
21:506:40844:27:28:72:540:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:at Georgia’s two- and four-year public colleges. The data are separately plotted for the two-year, 
21:507:40943:28:27:72:541:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:four-year and the elite four-year colleges in the state. Here we see a definite shift toward Georgia 
21:508:41044:27:28:72:519:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:residents since HOPE was introduced, with the effect most pronounced at four-year colleges 
21:509:41135:28:28:72:530:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:(especially the top schools) and least evident at the two-year schools. This pattern fits with our 
21:510:41234:28:27:72:494:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:understanding that four-year students are most mobile when making college attendance 
21:511:41319:27:40:72:123:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:decisions.

21:513:41384:27:24:72:532:145:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The effect of merit programs may vary across racial and ethnic groups for a number of reasons. 
21:514:41479:24:24:72:532:121:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:First, as was discussed earlier, academic performance in high school is strongly correlated with 
21:515:41576:24:0:72:541:97:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:race and ethnicity. A far smaller proportion of African Americans than whites will be eligible for 
22:516:41678:0:24:72:505:698:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:HOPE, for example, since only 15% have a GPA of 3.0 or above. Second, the rules of the 
22:517:41765:24:24:72:531:674:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:programs are sometimes such that they are likely to have a lesser impact on low-income youth. 
22:518:41859:24:24:72:541:650:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Until recently, Georgia did not offer the grant to those youth who had substantial Pell Grants and 
22:519:41958:24:24:72:528:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:low college costs. Mechanically, then, the program would have had a lower impact on African 
22:520:42050:24:24:72:526:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Americans and Hispanics, who tend to have lower incomes: in Georgia, 94 percent of African-
22:521:42141:24:24:72:521:578:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:American and 62 percent of white 16- to 17-year-olds live in families with incomes less than 
22:522:42234:24:24:72:518:554:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:$50,000.21 The numbers for the rest of the United States are similar.22 Third, states that have 
22:523:42330:24:24:72:531:530:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:merit programs may shift funds away from need-based aid or appropriations to colleges (which 
22:524:42423:24:24:72:518:506:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:hold down tuition prices). Both of these effects would tend to make college more expensive, 
22:525:42515:24:24:72:507:482:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:especially for those who don’t qualify for the merit programs to which the money is being 
22:526:42605:24:24:72:127:458:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:channeled. 
22:527:42616:24:24:108:537:434:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:To explore how the effect of merit aid programs varies by race and ethnicity, I repeat the 
22:528:42707:24:24:72:536:410:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:analysis of the preceding section, but allow the effect of HOPE to differ across racial and ethnic 
22:529:42806:24:24:72:532:386:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:groups. I divide the population into two, mutually exclusive categories: 1) white non-Hispanics 
22:530:42902:24:24:72:534:362:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and 2) Hispanics of any race plus Blacks.23 I then  estimate the effect of merit aid separately for 
22:531:43002:24:24:71:264:338:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:each group. The estimating equation is:

22:546:43177:13:18:72:537:203:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:21 Note that this refers to the nominal income distribution. This is appropriate, since the Georgia rules are 
22:547:43287:18:20:71:255:185:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:written in nominal rather than real terms. 
22:548:43330:20:17:72:523:165:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:22 These figures for the share with income below $50,000 may appear high. This is because the unit of 
22:549:43432:17:13:72:497:148:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:observation is not the family but the child. Since lower-income families have more children, the 
22:550:43529:13:13:72:541:135:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:distribution of family income within a sample of children has a lower mean than the distribution of family 
22:551:43635:13:19:72:235:122:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:income within a sample of families.  
22:552:43672:19:18:72:541:103:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:23 I would prefer to separately examine effects on Blacks and Hispanics. I have attempted to do so, but the 
22:553:43780:18:0:71:358:85:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Hispanic results are too imprecisely estimated to be informative. 
23:554:43849:0:24:108:487:698:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Results for Georgia are in Column (1) of Table 4;  I defer the discussion of the 
23:555:43929:24:24:72:510:674:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:distributional effects of the other programs shown in the other columns to the next section. 
23:556:44022:24:24:72:536:650:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Results are shown for specifications that do and do not include pre-existing time trends.24 These 
23:557:44120:24:24:72:536:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:estimates are relatively unstable, changing substantially when time trends are included. The two 
23:558:44217:24:24:72:528:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:sets of estimates both indicate, however, that HOPE had a substantially greater effect on white 
23:559:44313:24:24:72:515:578:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:attendance than Black and Hispanic attendance. The estimated effect of HOPE on the white 
23:560:44402:24:24:72:541:554:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:attendance rate is 9.6 to 14.0 percentage points, while that on Blacks and Hispanics is –0.7 to 6.6 
23:561:44502:24:24:72:540:530:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:percentage points. The results indicate that HOPE has increased racial and ethnic gaps in college 
23:562:44600:24:26:72:186:506:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:attendance in Georgia.

23:566:44676:28:27:72:537:410:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The Georgia program was one of the first, largest, and most well-publicized merit aid programs. 
23:567:44772:27:28:72:525:383:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:I now turn to whether the experience in Georgia is distinct from that in other states. I limit the 
23:568:44871:28:28:72:528:355:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:analysis to the South, where all but three of the programs in Table 1 are located.25 A benefit of 
23:569:44969:28:27:72:519:327:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:focusing on the Southern merit states is that they have a natural control group: the non-merit 
23:570:45064:27:28:72:497:300:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Southern states. The programs of two Southern states (Maryland and West Virginia) are 
23:571:45150:28:27:72:542:272:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:excluded, as they were introduced after 2000, the last year of the sample. That leaves seven merit 
23:572:45249:27:28:72:524:245:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:programs, located in Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi and South

23:575:45400:14:18:72:522:177:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:24 When time trends are included, they are estimated separately by state and race/ethnicity. Trends are 
23:576:45504:18:12:72:537:159:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:estimated for four separate groups: 1) non-Hispanic whites in Georgia  2) non-Hispanic whites in the rest 
23:577:45610:12:13:72:542:147:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:of the Southern non-merit states 3) Blacks and Hispanics in Georgia 4) Blacks and Hispanics in the rest of 
23:578:45717:13:19:72:206:134:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the non-merit Southern states. 
23:579:45748:19:17:72:501:115:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:25 Binder and Ganderton (2002) have examined the effect of New Mexico’s merit program. They 
23:580:45839:17:13:72:513:98:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:conclude that New Mexico Success has not affected the college attendance rate but, like HOPE, has 
23:581:45937:13:0:72:261:85:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:shifted students toward four-year schools.  
24:582:45984:0:27:108:528:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:I follow the approach used in the analysis of HOPE, creating a variable that indicates a 
24:583:46073:27:28:72:527:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:year and state in which a merit program is in place. In Column (1) of Table 4 are the results of 
24:584:46170:28:39:72:239:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:estimating the following equation: 
24:585:46205:39:17:109:498:614:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f7:(4)  01245_iaststststistaiastymeritbordermeritXXβββββδδδε=++++++++

24:587:46270:28:28:72:527:569:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The overall effect of the seven merit programs is 4.7 percentage points. The estimate is highly 
24:588:46366:28:27:72:527:541:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:significant, with a standard error of 1.1 percentage points. In Column (2), I allow this affect to 
24:589:46465:27:28:72:532:514:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:vary across the seven states, by replacing the single merit dummy with a set of seven dummies, 
24:590:46560:28:27:72:524:486:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:one for each state’s program. The specification of Column (2) is otherwise identical to that of 
24:591:46656:27:28:72:507:459:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Column (1), and so the appropriately-weighted average of the seven coefficients is the 4.7 
24:592:46747:28:28:72:527:431:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:percentage points of Column (1). Six of the estimates are highly significant. Five are clustered 
24:593:46844:28:27:72:513:403:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:between 4.9 (Mississippi) and 7.4 (Georgia). Well below Mississippi are Florida and South 
24:594:46934:27:28:72:454:376:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Carolina, with estimated effects of 3.0 and 0.2 percentage points, respectively.  
24:595:47016:28:27:108:531:348:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:We might suspect that the merit states are somehow different from the non-merit states, 
24:596:47104:27:28:72:523:321:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and that the non-merit states therefore form a poor control for these purposes. We can test the 
24:597:47200:28:28:72:539:293:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:sensitivity of our results to the choice of control group by dropping the non-merit states from the 
24:598:47300:28:27:72:513:265:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:sample and estimating the effect of merit aid purely from the staggered timing of its rollout 
24:599:47394:27:28:72:503:238:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:across the states. In this approach, the merit states form their own control group. Figure 5 
24:600:47487:28:27:72:535:210:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:graphically illustrates the identification strategy. During the first years of the sample (1988-90), 
24:601:47588:27:28:72:523:183:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:before the first merit program is introduced, all of the states are in the control group. In 1991, 
24:602:47687:28:28:72:542:155:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Arkansas moves into the treatment group, followed in 1993 by Georgia. By 2000, all of the states 
24:603:47784:28:27:72:521:127:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:are in the treatment group. This approach assumes that the states that eventually have a merit 
24:604:47879:27:0:72:541:100:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:program are on similar trends in the schooling outcomes of young people. The assumption is that 
25:605:47978:0:27:72:523:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the year in which a state’s merit program begins is quasi-random, uncorrelated with any state-
25:606:48072:27:28:72:322:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:specific trends in or shocks to schooling decisions.  
25:607:48126:28:27:108:499:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Results are in Columns (4) and (5) of Table 4. The estimated overall effect is not 
25:608:48209:27:28:72:522:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:sensitive to the choice of control group, with the estimate rising slightly, from 4.7 percentage 
25:609:48306:28:28:72:527:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:points to 5.2 percentage points. The state-specific coefficients are somewhat more sensitive to 
25:610:48402:28:27:72:515:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the choice of control group. For five of the states, each approach yields similar results. Two 
25:611:48497:27:28:72:540:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:exceptions are Arkansas and Florida, for whom the estimates vary substantially between Column 
25:612:48591:28:27:72:530:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:(2) and Column (4). Arkansas’ estimate drops from 4.8 to 1.6, while Florida’s rises from 3.0 to 
25:613:48687:27:28:72:341:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:6.3.   I will probe the results for these programs further. 
25:614:48747:28:28:108:514:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Only South Carolina has a consistently small and insignificant effect, which may be 
25:615:48831:28:27:72:510:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:explained by its requirement that students score at least 24 on the ACT. Nationally, just 30 
25:616:48924:27:28:72:504:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:percent of test-takers scored above South Carolina’s cutoff in 2000, while 88 percent met 
25:617:49014:28:27:72:542:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Missouri’s requirement and about 60 percent met the requirements of Arkansas (19), Florida (20) 
25:618:49110:27:28:72:524:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and Louisiana (19.6).26  The South Carolina legislature has come under pressure to loosen the 
25:619:49204:28:27:72:529:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:scholarship requirements and has responded by adding another route to eligibility. As of 2002, 
25:620:49299:27:28:72:537:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:students can qualify for a scholarship by meeting two of three criteria: 24 on the ACT, a GPA of 
25:621:49396:28:28:72:493:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:3.0, and graduating in the top 30 percent of one’s high school class.27 Further, the ACT 
25:622:49485:28:73:72:533:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:requirement has been dropped completely for those attending two-year institutions. It will be of 
25:623:49582:73:14:72:219:166:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
25:624:49630:14:18:72:532:152:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:26 These figures refer to the national ACT distribution, which has a mean of 21. The Black and Hispanic 
25:625:49734:18:13:72:529:134:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:distributions have lower means, of 16.9 and 19, respectively. Fewer members of these groups will meet 
25:626:49836:13:18:72:172:121:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the state ACT cutoffs. 
25:627:49859:18:18:72:526:103:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:27 Personal conversation with Bichevia Green, South Carolina Commission on Higher Education (June 
25:628:49957:18:0:72:120:85:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:14, 2002). 
26:629:49971:0:27:72:527:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:interest to see if the effect of South Carolina’s program on the college attendance margin rises 
26:630:50068:27:28:72:189:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:with this shift in policy. 
26:631:50095:28:27:108:534:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Next, I examine whether the inclusion of pre-existing time trends affects the results. Pre-
26:632:50186:27:28:72:539:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:existing trends could contaminate the results for both control groups. The merit states may be on 
26:633:50284:28:28:72:524:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:different time trends from the non-merit states, and they may be on different trends from each 
26:634:50379:28:27:72:525:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:other.  I estimate a trend for the entire 1988-2000 period for each state. Deviations from these 
26:635:50476:27:28:72:532:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:trends after a state introduces merit aid can then be attributed to the new program.28 Results are 
26:636:50575:28:27:71:512:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:in Columns (3) and (6). As was true in the specification without time trends, the merit-only 
26:637:50668:27:28:71:526:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:control group produces somewhat larger estimates. Both approaches indicate that the effect of 
26:638:50762:28:28:71:528:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:merit aid evolves over time, with the effect rising from 2.4 percentage points in the first year a 
26:639:50861:28:27:71:536:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:program is in effect to 6.0 percentage points in year three and beyond. When the merit states are 
26:640:50959:27:28:71:521:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:used as their own control group, the effect rises from 5.1 percentage points in year one to 9.8 
26:641:51055:28:27:71:536:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:percentage points in the third year).29  The effect of merit aid may rise during the first years of a 
26:642:51157:27:28:72:538:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:program for several reasons. It may take time for information about them to diffuse. It also takes 
26:643:51256:28:27:72:521:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:time for high school students who are inspired to work harder to increase their overall GPAs. 
26:644:51350:27:28:72:524:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Those who are high school seniors when a program is first introduced can do little to increase 
26:645:51445:28:28:72:524:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:their cumulative GPAs, while those who are freshmen have four years to increase their effort. 
26:646:51539:28:27:72:526:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The pool of eligible youth may thereby expand over time. The effect could also diminish over 
26:647:51632:27:34:72:541:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:time, if many college students fail to qualify for scholarship renewals and their younger peers are 
26:648:51732:34:14:72:219:178:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
26:649:51780:14:17:72:504:164:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:28 In this specification, a simple merit dummy will not properly identify the effect of the merit aid 
26:650:51882:17:13:72:540:147:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:program, as such an approach would inappropriately attribute part of the aid-induced change to the trend.  
26:651:51989:13:13:72:537:134:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:We can solve this problem by replacing the merit dummy with either a separate time trend or year effects 
26:652:52094:13:12:72:537:121:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:after merit aid is introduced in a state. Wolfers (2002) uses this approach to estimate the effect of divorce 
26:653:52204:12:19:72:356:109:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:law reform, which occurred in different states in different years. 
26:654:52271:19:0:72:430:90:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:29 Note that these are not cumulative effects, but period-specific program effects. 
27:655:52358:0:27:72:537:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:discouraged from taking up the scholarship. The results in Table 4 indicate that, across the merit 
27:656:52457:27:28:72:462:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:states, the incentive and information effects dominate the discouragement effect.

27:659:52581:28:28:72:525:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The analysis of the previous section indicates that the state merit aid programs have increased 
27:660:52677:28:27:72:514:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:college attendance. I next examine whether these programs have also affected the choice of 
27:661:52768:27:28:72:534:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:college, as was true in Georgia. I use the analytical framework of the previous section, though I 
27:662:52866:28:27:72:524:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:will only show results that pool the merit states in order to gain precision. All of the Southern 
27:663:52964:27:28:72:536:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:states are included in the sample; results are similar, but less precise, when the sample is limited 
27:664:53065:28:28:72:470:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:to the Southern merit states. I show results that do and do not include time trends.  
27:665:53151:28:27:72:530:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Table 5 indicates that, overall, the Southern merit programs have had a strong effect on 
27:666:53240:27:28:72:540:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the choice of college, with a considerable shift toward four-year public schools of 4.4 percentage 
27:667:53339:28:27:72:522:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:points, which is about the same as the overall attendance effect. There are no effects on other 
27:668:53435:27:28:72:512:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:choices of college. As was discussed earlier, this is likely the results of equally-sized shifts 
27:669:53532:28:27:72:529:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:toward and away from two-year public schools, by students on the margin of college entry and 
27:670:53625:27:28:72:520:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:four-year-college attendance, respectively. The time-trend specification gives similar results, 
27:671:53721:28:28:72:523:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:though here there is more indication of a net drop in the probability of attendance at two-year 
27:672:53817:28:27:72:150:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:public colleges.

27:674:53834:28:27:72:414:184:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Do All Merit Aid Programs Have the Distributional Impact of HOPE? 
27:675:53900:27:28:72:523:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Many of the merit programs are quite new. Of the seven programs examined in Table 4, three 
27:676:53991:28:28:72:515:129:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:had been operative for fewer than four years old by 2000. In this section, I examine the four 
27:677:54085:28:0:72:536:101:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:more mature programs – those of Georgia, Florida, Arkansas and Mississippi – in greater depth. 
28:678:54183:0:27:72:538:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:An advantage of focusing on the older programs is that these states have sufficient post-program 
28:679:54279:27:28:72:536:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:observations to allow for the finer cuts of the data needed to examine heterogeneity in the effect 
28:680:54378:28:27:72:533:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of aid across demographic groups. Given the strong impact of HOPE on the racial/ethnic gap in 
28:681:54472:27:28:72:517:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:schooling, it is of interest to examine whether the other programs have had a similar impact. 
28:682:54566:28:28:72:526:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: In Table 6, I examine how the effect of the four programs varies by race and ethnicity. 
28:683:54654:28:27:72:532:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The control group is the non-merit states. I show the results of specifications that do and do not 
28:684:54753:27:28:72:541:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:include pre-program time trends.30 While the estimates do change when time trends are included, 
28:685:54849:28:27:72:501:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and some are quite imprecisely estimated, a consistent story emerges from the table. The 
28:686:54938:27:28:72:519:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:estimates concord with Table 4, which showed that each of these four programs had a strong 
28:687:55029:28:28:72:542:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:impact on the college attendance rate. However, Table 6 shows that the relative effects on Blacks 
28:688:55127:28:27:72:513:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and Hispanics differ substantially across programs. In particular, Georgia is an outlier in its 
28:689:55223:27:28:72:471:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:relatively low effect on Blacks and Hispanics, as compared to its effect on whites.  
28:690:55308:28:27:108:509:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Georgia’s HOPE has had the largest impact of all the state programs on the college 
28:691:55391:27:28:72:506:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:attendance of whites, with the estimated effect ranging from 9.6 to 14.0 percentage points 
28:692:55482:28:27:72:483:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:(without and with time trends, respectively). Analogous effects in the other states are 
28:693:55570:27:28:72:492:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:substantially smaller, with no state’s estimates for white, non-Hispanics larger than six 
28:694:55660:28:28:72:527:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:percentage points. Further, the effect of Georgia HOPE on Blacks and Hispanics is 3.0 to 14.7 
28:695:55754:28:27:72:533:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:points lower than the effect on whites. In the other three states, the estimated effect of merit aid 
28:696:55855:27:28:72:528:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:on Blacks and Hispanics is consistently more positive than its effect on white, non-Hispanics.  
28:697:55951:28:27:108:530:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:This is an important finding, as Georgia is the only program whose distributional effect 
28:698:56040:27:28:72:527:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:has been examined in depth, and the assumption has been that, in other states, merit aid would 
28:699:56135:28:14:72:219:129:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
28:700:56183:14:17:72:529:115:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:30 In the analysis of each program, four pre-program trends are estimated: two for white, non-Hispanics 
28:701:56287:17:13:72:513:98:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:(one for the treatment state and one for the control states) and two for Blacks/Hispanics (one for the 
28:702:56390:13:0:72:278:85:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:treatment state and one for the control states).  
29:703:56443:0:27:72:521:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:similarly widen the racial gap in college attendance.31 The results in Table 6 indicate that the 
29:704:56540:27:28:72:499:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:other mature merit aid programs have not had this effect, with nearly all of the estimates 
29:705:56631:28:27:72:347:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:suggesting that merit aid has actually narrowed the gap.  
29:706:56689:27:28:72:514:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Why is Georgia different? HOPE diverges from the other three programs in two key 
29:707:56770:28:28:72:534:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:ways. First, its GPA requirements are unusually stringent. Georgia requires a  high school GPA 
29:708:56865:28:27:72:524:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of 3.0, while Arkansas and Mississippi require a GPA of only 2.5. Florida’s high school GPA 
29:709:56957:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:requirement is similar to Georgia’s, but its renewal requirements are less stringent, with a college 
29:710:57058:28:27:72:532:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:GPA of 2.75 allowing a student to keep her scholarship. A college GPA of 2.75 also qualifies a 
29:711:57153:27:28:72:435:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:student for renewal in Arkansas, and only a 2.5 is required in Mississippi.   
29:712:57231:28:28:108:511:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Scholarship renewal rates for Blacks are substantially lower than those of whites in 
29:713:57316:28:27:72:530:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Georgia, indicating that the college GPA requirement hits them particularly hard. Blacks at the 
29:714:57412:27:28:72:525:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:University of Georgia are twice as likely as whites to lose their scholarship after the freshman 
29:715:57509:28:27:72:534:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:year.32 A study at the Georgia Institute of Technology also found that Blacks were substantially 
29:716:57606:27:28:72:512:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:more likely than whites to lose their scholarships, though this differential disappeared after 
29:717:57701:28:27:72:509:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:accounting for differences in ability (as measured by SAT scores).33 More generally, since 
29:718:57792:27:28:72:520:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Blacks and Hispanics have relatively low high school and college grades, less stringent GPA 
29:719:57884:28:28:72:344:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:requirements will disproportionately benefit this group.  
29:720:57942:28:27:108:531:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A second key difference between HOPE and the other state programs is its treatment of 
29:721:58028:27:28:72:537:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:other sources of aid. During the period under analysis, HOPE was reduced dollar-for-dollar by a 
29:722:58124:28:33:72:497:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:student’s other aid. As a result, upper-income youth received substantially larger HOPE 
29:723:58212:33:14:72:219:151:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
29:724:58260:14:23:72:355:137:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:31 See, for example, Dynarski (2000) and Cornwell et al (2002). 
29:725:58324:23:24:72:146:114:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:32 Healy (1997). 
29:726:58341:24:0:72:193:90:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:33 Dee and Jackson (1999). 
30:727:58371:0:27:72:525:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:scholarships than their lower-income counterparts. Lower-income youth also faced a far more 
30:728:58463:27:28:72:523:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:difficult application process, since they were required to complete substantial paperwork (the 
30:729:58558:28:27:72:536:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:FAFSA) in order to even be considered for HOPE. The perverse impact of these requirements is 
30:730:58651:27:28:72:540:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:that lower-income students have to work harder to get aid that is less generous than that awarded 
30:731:58749:28:28:72:514:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:their well-off counterparts.34 In stark contrast, Arkansas gives larger awards to low-income 
30:732:58842:28:27:72:486:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:students, by allowing students who receive the Pell to keep their Academic Challenge 
30:733:58927:27:28:72:507:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Scholarships and by excluding from eligibility students from families with incomes above 
30:734:59016:28:27:72:125:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:$55,000.35

30:738:59089:27:28:72:532:403:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: The analysis in this paper has focused on the effect of merit aid on two critical margins: 
30:739:59180:28:28:72:538:375:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the decision to attend college and the type of college chosen. I have touched on another outcome 
30:740:59277:28:27:72:524:347:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:that is quite important, at least to legislators: the decision to attend college within one’s home 
30:741:59376:27:28:72:529:320:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:state. I have found that merit aid moderately increases college attendance, and has an effect on 
30:742:59473:28:27:72:536:292:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:college choice, generally shifting students from two-year schools toward four-year schools. The 
30:743:59569:27:28:72:525:265:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:data also suggest that Georgia’s merit aid program has increased the probability that a student 
30:744:59665:28:28:72:534:237:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:will attend college in her home state. It remains to be determined whether merit aid keeps those 
30:745:59762:28:27:72:539:209:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:students in state after they have completed their education, which is the ultimate goal of many of 
30:746:59861:27:29:72:535:182:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:those who hope to use merit aid to stanch a perceived “brain drain.” It also remains to be settled 
30:747:59960:29:14:72:219:153:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
30:748:60008:14:18:72:521:139:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:34 Georgia recently eliminated this aspect of its program. As more data become available, it will be of 
30:749:60112:18:18:72:455:121:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:interest to examine whether this change has altered the distributional impact of HOPE. 
30:750:60199:18:18:72:509:103:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:35 This is the income cutoff for a family of four. Median income for a family of four in Arkansas is 
30:751:60300:18:0:72:390:85:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:$45,000, so a large share of students fall under these income guidelines. 
31:752:60377:0:27:72:506:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:whether the merit programs have increased completed schooling, as opposed to attempted 
31:753:60464:27:28:72:135:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:schooling.36  
31:754:60478:28:27:72:496:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: There are many other margins of behavior that merit aid may affect. Thoroughly 
31:755:60557:27:28:72:530:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:addressing all of these potential effects would expand this lengthy chapter into a lengthy book. 
31:756:60654:28:28:72:503:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Here I will provide a comprehensive, but necessarily shallow, discussion of these issues.

31:759:60782:28:27:72:515:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Merit aid may affect academic performance, both in high school and college. Merit aid may 
31:760:60872:27:28:72:533:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:cause students to try harder in high school and college in order to qualify for and maintain their 
31:761:60971:28:28:72:511:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:scholarships. This would be reflected in higher grades and test scores.  Observed academic 
31:762:61062:28:27:72:541:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:performance may improve for less positive reasons, however: pressure from students and parents 
31:763:61157:27:28:72:407:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:may lead to grade inflation at both the high school and college level.  
31:764:61229:28:27:72:504:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Henry and Rubinstein (2002) show that the average high school GPA of freshmen 
31:765:61307:27:28:72:538:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:entering the Georgia public universities rose from 2.73 in 1992 to 2.98 in 1999. However, so too 
31:766:61404:28:27:72:531:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:did the average SAT score (from 968 to 1010), suggesting that grade inflation does not explain 
31:767:61499:27:28:72:524:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:all of the increase.37 Grades at the college level also appear to be affected by HOPE. Whether 
31:768:61594:28:76:72:530:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:due to increased, effort, or grade inflation, grades at University of Georgia are on the rise, with 
31:769:61694:76:14:72:219:191:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
31:770:61742:14:18:72:522:177:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:36 Data limitations, rather than conceptual difficulties, hamper the analysis of this particular margin of 
31:771:61849:18:12:72:528:159:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:behavior. At a minimum, we require data on the completed schooling of adults, along with information 
31:772:61950:12:13:72:531:147:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:about the state in which they graduated high school. As of 2002, these data are not available in any data 
31:773:62056:13:13:72:522:134:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:set large enough for informative analysis of the existing merit programs. The 2000 Census micro-data 
31:774:62157:13:18:72:451:121:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:may prove useful in this context, and I plan to examine this question using these data. 
31:775:62245:18:18:72:492:103:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:37 Since this study examines only grades in Georgia, it cannot rule out that secular trends in the 
31:776:62344:18:0:72:453:85:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:relationship between SAT score and grades are driving the results, rather than HOPE.

32:778:62524:27:28:72:166:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:percent in 1996. 38  
32:779:62545:28:27:72:534:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Merit aid may also induce students to choose less demanding courseloads in order reach 
32:780:62632:27:28:72:539:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the required GPA. Binder and Ganderton (2002) conclude that New Mexico’s merit program has 
32:781:62723:28:28:72:536:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:induced students to reduce their credit hours. Students also have the incentive to drop a difficult 
32:782:62823:28:27:72:532:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:class when they fear they may get less than a B. At University of Georgia, the share of students 
32:783:62920:27:28:72:411:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:dropping classes rose from 5.5 percent to 7.3 percent (Healy, 1997).

32:787:63039:28:27:72:494:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Cornwell and Mustard (2002) also provide insight into how a merit aid program affects 
32:788:63125:27:28:72:528:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:institutions of higher education. They examine the enrollment data of Georgia’s two- and four-
32:789:63219:28:27:72:529:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:year colleges, and find that enrollment as a share of the state’s college-eligible population rose 
32:790:63318:27:28:72:543:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:after the introduction of HOPE, relative to enrollment in comparable states. These results provide 
32:791:63417:28:27:72:542:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:insight into how the impact of HOPE on thousands of individuals’ choice of college aggregate up 
32:792:63513:27:28:72:518:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:into major shifts in the demographic composition of Georgia’s schools.  For example, in this 
32:793:63606:28:28:72:540:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:paper we have seen that Georgia HOPE had a small impact on the propensity of black Georgians 
32:794:63699:28:27:72:538:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:to attend college, but a much larger impact on which college they chose to attend, with a marked 
32:795:63796:27:28:72:533:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:shift of these students toward four-year colleges. We have also seen that HOPE appears to have 
32:796:63891:28:80:72:525:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:encouraged Georgians to attend college in Georgia rather than across state lines.  In Cornwell

32:798:64034:14:0:72:258:90:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:38 This paragraph draws on Healy (1997). 
33:799:64078:0:27:72:508:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and Mustard’s institutional analysis, this nets out as a sharp rise in the enrollment of black 
33:800:64173:27:28:72:280:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:students at Georgia’s four-year colleges.39  
33:801:64218:28:27:108:499:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Long (2002) has examined the effect of HOPE on tuition prices and other school 
33:802:64297:27:28:72:522:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:financial indicators. Like Dynarski (2000), she finds that the full cost of attendance at public, 
33:803:64395:28:28:72:528:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:four-year schools rose faster in GA than in comparable states after HOPE was introduced. The 
33:804:64488:28:27:72:528:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:increase is fully explained by increases in room and board, which is not covered by HOPE. As 
33:805:64581:27:28:72:531:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Long points out, schools may have been under pressure from the state not to raise tuition, since 
33:806:64678:28:27:72:516:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:any increases here would have to be met by increased HOPE outlays. Increases in room and 
33:807:64767:27:28:72:542:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:board, however, could slip by with less attention. Private schools face no such incentives to game 
33:808:64866:28:28:72:521:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the form taken by their price increases, and accordingly their price increases are more evenly 
33:809:64961:28:27:72:332:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:divided between tuition, room and board after HOPE. 
33:810:65013:27:28:72:75:405:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5: 
33:811:65013:28:27:72:139:377:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Consumption 
33:812:65025:27:28:108:528:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Even the largest estimates of the effect of merit aid on schooling decisions suggest that 
33:813:65115:28:27:72:524:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the great majority of aid goes to infra-marginal families – that is, to families whose schooling 
33:814:65212:27:28:72:516:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:decisions are unaffected by their receipt of aid.40 Of interest is what actually happens to this 
33:815:65309:28:28:72:521:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:money. Do students use it to reduce the number of hours they work while in school? Do they 
33:816:65400:28:48:72:531:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:increase their spending in leisure activities? Do families save the money, for retirement or later 
33:817:65499:48:14:72:219:191:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
33:818:65547:14:18:72:508:177:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:39 This result has frequently been misinterpreted as suggesting a very large impact of HOPE on the 
33:819:65646:18:18:72:299:159:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:propensity of black Georgians to go to any college. 
33:820:65698:18:18:72:537:141:49:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:40 It is important to note that merit aid is not unique in this way. Estimates of the effects of other forms of 
33:821:65810:18:13:72:496:123:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:student aid also indicate that aid largely goes to those whose observable schooling decisions are 
33:822:65908:13:12:72:533:110:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:unaffected by the receipt of aid. Targeting of subsidies is a classic topic of public economics; there is no 
33:823:66017:12:13:72:536:98:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:transfer program that is 100% effective in limiting its subsidy to those whose decisions are contingent on 
33:824:66124:13:0:72:190:85:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the receipt of the subsidy.  
34:825:66156:0:27:72:495:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:bequests to their children? One study suggests that at least part of the money is used for 
34:826:66247:27:28:72:530:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:increased current consumption. Cornwell and Mustard (2002) examine new car registrations in 
34:827:66339:28:27:72:504:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Georgia and comparison states and find that car purchases rose faster in Georgia after the 
34:828:66430:27:28:72:535:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:introduction of HOPE than before. They reach similar conclusions by examining the correlation 
34:829:66524:28:28:72:540:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:between car registrations and the number of HOPE recipients at the county level within Georgia, 
34:830:66620:28:27:72:508:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:finding an elasticity of new car registrations with respect to HOPE recipients of about two

34:833:66744:27:24:72:312:476:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:How will the effect of merit aid evolve over time? 
34:834:66795:24:24:108:521:452:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The Georgia HOPE results give us the effect of merit aid program for a "first mover." 
34:835:66881:24:24:72:530:428:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:What is the effect when a new merit program is introduced in a region which already has many 
34:836:66974:24:24:72:539:404:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:such programs? In the presence of supply constraints, the effect of latecomer programs would be 
34:837:67070:24:24:72:537:380:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:smaller than that of earlier programs, as attendance grows and the supply grows tighter. There is 
34:838:67168:24:24:72:533:356:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:no evidence of such a trend in the present analysis; Arkansas’ program is the oldest and has not 
34:839:67265:24:24:72:522:332:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:had an unusually large effect, while Kentucky’s is the youngest and has not had an unusually 
34:840:67358:24:24:72:538:308:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:small effect (see Table 4). Of course, the various state programs differ in aspects other than their 
34:841:67459:24:24:72:494:284:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:age, so the unconditional correlation between program age and program effect does not 
34:842:67545:24:24:72:225:260:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:constitute conclusive evidence. 
34:843:67577:24:24:108:518:236:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:What would the world look like if every state introduced such a program? Would the 
34:844:67660:24:24:72:542:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:states be right back where they started, with students distributed across schools and states as they 
34:845:67761:24:24:72:527:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:were before this burst of spending? Probably not. Consider the college attendance margin. We 
34:846:67854:24:24:72:519:164:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:have seen that the existing merit programs have increased college attendance rates. The only 
34:847:67947:24:24:72:525:140:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:scenario in which the new programs would not have the same effect is one in which supply of 
34:848:68039:24:24:72:532:116:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:seats at schools is inelastic. If the total supply is indeed inelastic, then the current programs can 
34:849:68141:24:0:72:542:92:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:have increased attendance only by reducing attendance in other states. In the empirical analysis, I 
35:850:68244:0:24:72:536:698:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:find no evidence that the introduction of a merit program reduces attendance in adjoining states, 
35:851:68342:24:24:72:448:674:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:which suggests that, at least at the present, supply constraints are not binding. 
35:852:68424:24:24:108:528:650:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:What about college choice? While we might think that supply is elastic among the non-
35:853:68509:24:24:72:539:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:selective schools, this is certainly not the case for the elite institutions. Competition for positions

35:855:68716:24:24:72:534:578:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:University of Georgia, where SAT scores of entering freshmen have risen considerably and UG

35:857:68901:24:24:72:333:530:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:intense competition for admission induced by HOPE.

35:859:69045:24:24:72:525:482:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:college. Merit aid both pulls students toward their own states’ schools and pushes them out of 
35:860:69140:24:24:72:533:458:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:other states’ schools.  Like low tuition for state residents, merit aid pulls students toward home.

35:866:69342:28:27:72:515:351:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Education is the most common use of lottery funds; 16 of the 38 states with lotteries 
35:867:69428:27:28:72:522:324:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:devote all or some of the revenue to education.41 In Georgia, for example, all of the funds are 
35:868:69524:28:27:72:488:296:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:devoted to education. At inception, roughly equal amounts were devoted to the HOPE

35:870:69701:28:28:72:542:241:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:has gradually eaten up a larger and larger portion of the lottery revenue, by 1999 74% of Georgia 
35:871:69799:28:27:72:370:213:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:lottery revenues were spent on HOPE and pre-kindergarten.42 
35:872:69858:27:28:72:521:186:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Lottery funds spent on elementary and secondary education are, by their nature, more

36:878:70246:27:28:72:540:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:from upper-income families. Further, lottery spenders tend to be disproportionately concentrated 
36:879:70343:28:27:72:538:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:in the bottom of the income distribution. Through both the revenue and spending channels, then, 
36:880:70439:27:28:72:368:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:lottery-funded merit programs are regressive in their impact.

36:882:70502:28:27:72:195:570:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:The Politics of Merit Aid 
36:883:70528:27:28:72:525:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f5:Why have merit aid programs spread so rapidly and maintained such strong political support? 
36:884:70619:28:27:72:509:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:One possibility is that merit aid is a politically astute way to build support for spending on 
36:885:70714:27:28:72:527:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:postsecondary education. Consider two alternatives for subsidizing college: low public tuition 
36:886:70809:28:28:72:521:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:prices and need-based aid. Merit aid has a political advantage over low tuition in that it has a 
36:887:70906:28:27:72:531:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:high profile. Parents (voters) generally do not understand that the public university tuition they 
36:888:71005:27:28:72:505:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:pay is kept artificially low by state appropriations to the schools. As a result, they may be 
36:889:71099:28:27:72:536:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:unsympathetic to legislative efforts to increase funding through this route. If, instead, their child 
36:890:71201:27:28:72:527:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:receives a “scholarship” that pays for tuition, the perceived benefit is personal and immediate, 
36:891:71298:28:27:72:537:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:inducing political support for the spending.  That students “earn” merit aid may also place it at a 
36:892:71398:27:28:72:505:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:political advantage over other funding mechanisms. A merit program is akin to the Social 
36:893:71487:28:28:72:532:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Security program: in both cases, voters are fiercely supportive of transfers that they perceive as 
36:894:71586:28:27:72:342:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:earned rewards rather than unconditional entitlements.   
36:895:71643:27:28:72:535:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Merit aid is analogous to Social Security in a second way. William Julius Wilson (1987) 
36:896:71731:28:27:72:528:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and Theda Skocpol (1991) have argued that robust welfare states are characterized by benefits 
36:897:71825:27:28:72:520:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:that are widely available, and therefore, widely supported. They argue that means-tested anti-
36:898:71919:28:28:72:526:129:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:poverty programs are politically weak because their scope is narrow. A similar dynamic could 
36:899:72012:28:0:72:540:101:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:explain weak funding growth for need-based aid programs. Ninety percent of Pell Grants flow to 
37:900:72110:0:27:72:531:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:those with family incomes below $40,000. The price of this highly progressive spending is that 
37:901:72205:27:28:72:407:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:many voters do not perceive themselves as its potential beneficiaries. 
37:902:72276:28:27:108:521:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Is a progressive aid system therefore politically unviable? Not necessarily. Politically 
37:903:72365:27:28:72:535:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:popular “universal” programs can potentially provide political cover for redistributive transfers. 
37:904:72464:28:28:72:529:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:As Social Security shows, a universal program can be layered with transfers that channel extra 
37:905:72559:28:27:72:533:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:dollars toward those with greater need.  In the case of merit aid, the universal benefit of waived 
37:906:72658:27:28:72:518:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:tuition and fees could be combined with a living allowance for lower-income youth, thereby 
37:907:72749:28:27:72:511:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:piggybacking need-based aid onto a politically-popular program. This does not necessarily 
37:908:72839:27:28:72:531:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:require new spending, as existing need-based programs could simply be relabeled in a way that 
37:909:72933:28:28:72:245:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:enhances their political popularity.

37:912:73012:24:24:108:532:371:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:State merit aid programs have grow rapidly over the past decade, a period characterized 
37:913:73100:24:24:72:536:347:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:by strong economic growth and overflowing state coffers. Recently, merit programs have begun 
37:914:73193:24:24:72:541:323:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:to feel the pinch of the economic downturn. As state legislators struggle to balance their budgets, 
37:915:73293:24:24:72:533:299:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:merit aid programs dependent upon legislative appropriations (Arkansas, California, Louisiana, 
37:916:73388:24:24:72:533:275:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Maryland and Mississippi) find themselves in direct competition with other state priorities such 
37:917:73485:24:24:72:527:251:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:as elementary and secondary education and health care. Arkansas, the first state to introduce a 
37:918:73581:24:24:72:516:227:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:broad-based merit aid program, has temporarily closed the program to new enrollees. While 
37:919:73671:24:24:72:536:203:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:current scholarship recipients can renew their awards, no new students are being admitted to the 
37:920:73768:24:24:72:536:179:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:program. Funding for Louisiana’s program barely avoided the chopping block during the state’s 
37:921:73862:24:24:72:188:155:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:last legislative session.  
37:922:73889:24:24:108:520:131:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Those merit programs with committed revenue streams have been relatively buffered 
37:923:73971:24:24:72:509:107:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:from the economic and political effects of the recession. Six states (Florida, Georgia, New 
37:924:74063:24:0:72:540:83:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Mexico, West Virginia, South Carolina and Kentucky) fund their programs with revenues from a 
38:925:74159:0:24:72:537:698:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:state lottery, while two (Nevada and Michigan) use funds from the tobacco litigation settlement. 
38:926:74256:24:24:72:519:674:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:With their dedicated funding sources, merit aid in these states is not vulnerable to legislators 
38:927:74353:24:24:72:508:650:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:seeking to cut spending in the face of sinking tax revenues. This puts merit aid in a unique 
38:928:74446:24:24:72:541:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:position, since other sources of funding for higher education at the state level are not protected in 
38:929:74548:24:24:72:516:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the same way. Public universities are experiencing leaner times this fiscal year as their state 
38:930:74644:24:24:72:516:578:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:appropriations are reduced. Aid for low-income students is also vulnerable. West Virginia’s 
38:931:74736:24:24:72:519:554:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:need-based aid program could not deliver scholarships to all those low-income students who 
38:932:74827:24:24:72:498:530:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:were eligible during the 2002-2003 academic year. The same year, the state’s new merit 
38:933:74914:24:24:72:403:506:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:program, which has no income cap, was launched with full funding.

38:936:74992:24:24:108:521:434:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A similar dynamic has emerged at the federal level. The fastest-growing subsidies for 
38:937:75078:24:24:72:534:410:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:college students – tax credits, savings tax incentives, and loans –are programs whose funding is 
38:938:75175:24:24:72:533:386:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:not contingent upon legislative appropriation. By contrast, spending on the Pell Grant program, 
38:939:75271:24:24:72:535:362:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:which funds the most needy students, is determined by annual legislative appropriation. At both 
38:940:75367:24:24:72:529:338:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the state and federal level there has emerged a set of policies that put subsidies for the well-off 
38:941:75467:24:24:72:395:314:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:on a firmer financial footing than aid for those with low incomes.   
38:942:75536:24:24:108:499:290:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Policy advocates concerned by the stubbornly low rate of college attendance and 
38:943:75616:24:24:72:539:266:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:completion among low-income youth have fought hard against the spread of merit aid, as well as 
38:944:75711:24:24:72:533:242:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:against the federal and state tax incentives for education that blossomed rapidly in recent years. 
38:945:75810:24:24:72:517:218:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:They argue that this spending channels funds toward middle- and high-income families, and 
38:946:75900:24:24:72:463:194:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:advocate for enhanced spending on need-based programs such as the Pell Grant.  
38:947:75979:24:24:108:538:170:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:From a political and revenue standpoint, however, the middle-class programs are on firm 
38:948:76066:24:24:72:527:146:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:footing. There is a near-zero probability that they will be scrapped and their funding shifted to 
38:949:76164:24:24:72:519:122:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:need-based grants. Rather than fighting a losing battle, it may be time to think of aid for low-
38:950:76260:24:24:72:525:98:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:income students in terms of Skocpol’s and Wilson’s “targeted universalism,” harnessing need-
38:951:76352:24:0:72:529:74:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:based subsidies to the politically-popular middle-class programs. For example, grants could be 
39:952:76450:0:24:72:530:698:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:delivered to needy students through the tax system by making the Hope and Lifetime Learning 
39:953:76542:24:24:72:540:674:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:tax credits refundable.43 This would eliminate one layer of paperwork (the FAFSA) yet allow aid 
39:954:76638:24:24:71:522:650:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:eligibility to still be determined with the detailed financial information that is provided in tax 
39:955:76737:24:24:71:540:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:filings. More importantly, funding for low-income students would be shifted into a program with 
39:956:76833:24:24:71:537:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:broad-based political appeal and a guaranteed funding stream. At the state level, merit programs 
39:957:76930:24:24:71:542:578:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:could be similarly tweaked to provide greater funding for low-income students within the context 
39:958:77027:24:14:71:282:554:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of programs that have widespread support.
