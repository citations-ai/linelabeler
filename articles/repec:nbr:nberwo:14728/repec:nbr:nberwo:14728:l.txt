2:33:1868:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:We investigate the association between the timing of enrollment in the Special Supplemental Nutrition
2:34:1969:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and smoking among prenatal WIC participants.
2:35:2060:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:We use WIC data from eight states participating in the Pregnancy Nutrition Surveillance System (PNSS).
2:36:2162:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:Women who enroll in WIC in the first trimester of pregnancy are 2.7 percentage points more likely
2:37:2259:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:to be smoking at intake than women who enroll in the third trimester. Among participants who smoked
2:38:2358:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:before pregnancy and at prenatal WIC enrollment, those who enrolled in the first trimester are 4.5
2:39:2456:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:percentage points more likely to quit smoking 3 months before delivery and 3.4 percentage points
2:40:2552:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:more likely to quit by postpartum registration, compared with women who do not enroll in WIC until
2:41:2650:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:F:the third trimester.  Overall, early WIC enrollment is associated with higher quit rates, although changes
2:42:2756:14:42:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:F:are modest when compared to the results from smoking cessation interventions for pregnant women.

3:62:3258:0:27:291:359:708:144:Times:144:Times:?:Introduction 
3:63:3271:27:14:71:74:681:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
3:64:3271:14:28:107:488:667:144:Times:144:Times:A:Tobacco exposure during pregnancy has been recognized as one of the leading 
3:65:3347:28:27:71:533:639:144:Times:144:Times:B:preventable causes of adverse birth outcomes since the Surgeon General’s report of 1964 called 
3:66:3442:27:28:71:486:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:attention to the association between smoking during pregnancy and low birth weight.  
3:67:3527:28:27:71:535:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:Subsequent reports expanded the list of adverse associations to include placental complications, 
3:68:3624:27:28:71:346:557:144:Times:144:Times:B:fetal and perinatal mortality, SIDS, and other effects [1]. 
3:69:3684:28:28:107:521:529:144:Times:144:Times:A:As public awareness of the dangers of tobacco has grown, the number of women who 
3:70:3765:28:27:71:517:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:smoke during pregnancy has declined.  In 2004, only 10.2 percent of women smoked during 
3:71:3853:27:28:71:504:474:144:Times:144:Times:B:pregnancy, a 48 percent drop from 1989 [2].   While the decline is substantial, it conceals 
3:72:3945:28:27:71:539:446:144:Times:144:Times:B:significant variations in smoking by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status.   For instance, 13.8 
3:73:4044:27:28:71:535:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:percent of white women smoked during pregnancy in 2004 compared with 8.4 percent of blacks 
3:74:4135:28:28:71:519:391:144:Times:144:Times:B:and 2.6 percent of Hispanics. Differences by maternal education are also stark.  Twenty-four 
3:75:4228:28:27:71:524:363:144:Times:144:Times:B:percent of high school dropouts (9-11 years of schooling) smoked during pregnancy, whereas 
3:76:4319:27:28:71:530:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:women with 12, 13-15, and 16 or more years of schooling smoked at rates of 14.9, 8.4, and 1.5 
3:77:4413:28:27:71:530:308:144:Times:144:Times:B:percent, respectively [2]. Moreover, these figures underestimate the true prevalence of prenatal 
3:78:4510:27:28:71:534:281:144:Times:144:Times:B:smoking [3]. The simple yes/no screen for prenatal smoking on birth certificates is less likely to 
3:79:4609:28:27:71:508:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:elicit accurate responses than more detailed inquiries on frequency and timing, and all self-
3:80:4702:27:28:71:518:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:reports of maternal smoking, regardless of how specific the questions, are less sensitive than 
3:81:4797:28:28:71:280:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:screens based on biological markers [4-6].  
3:82:4841:28:27:107:510:170:144:Times:144:Times:A:Estimates of the magnitude of the effect of prenatal tobacco exposure vary with the 
3:83:4925:27:28:71:484:143:144:Times:144:Times:B:outcome examined, the study design, the population studied, and the period when the 
3:84:5009:28:27:71:522:115:144:Times:144:Times:B:investigation was conducted.  For example, case control studies using Washington State birth 
3:85:5102:27:0:71:536:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:certificate data estimated that smokers during pregnancy have twice the risk of placenta praevia, 
4:86:5201:0:27:72:497:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:a relationship confirmed in a cohort study from the Swedish Medical Birth Registry that 
4:87:5289:27:28:72:542:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:examined records of 1.8 million deliveries in that country from 1973- 1990 [7, 8].  An increase in 
4:88:5388:28:27:72:503:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:the odds of premature rupture of membranes associated with smoking has been estimated 
4:89:5474:27:28:72:542:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:between 1.6 and 2.1 [9, 10].  Most importantly, estimates of the average reduction in birth weight 
4:90:5573:28:28:72:540:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:associated with smoking during pregnancy range on the order of 250 grams, and these reductions 
4:91:5668:28:27:72:521:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:are dose dependent [11].  Given the documented prevalence of prenatal smoking among poor 
4:92:5757:27:28:72:523:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:women and the magnitude of its effects on birth outcomes, interventions that reduce maternal 
4:93:5850:28:27:72:528:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:smoking have the potential to significantly improve birth outcomes among poor and near-poor 
4:94:5942:27:28:72:116:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:women.  
4:95:5950:28:28:108:530:460:144:Times:144:Times:A:One of the largest federally sponsored programs that specifically targets this population 
4:96:6040:28:27:72:513:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:of pregnant women is the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and 
4:97:6127:27:28:72:513:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:Children (WIC), which combines nutritional support with counseling and enhanced referral 
4:98:6216:28:27:72:536:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:services to improve the health of pregnant women and their offspring.  A crucial feature of WIC 
4:99:6312:27:28:72:512:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:counseling is its emphasis on smoking prevention and cessation.  In this study, we examine 
4:100:6403:28:27:72:532:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:smoking among pregnant women who participate in WIC.  We test whether greater exposure to 
4:101:6493:27:28:72:512:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:WIC during pregnancy is associated with decreases in the prevalence of smoking, smoking 
4:102:6581:28:28:72:541:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:cessation and postpartum relapse.   Data are from selected states that participate in the Pregnancy 
4:103:6681:28:27:72:504:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:Nutrition Surveillance System (PNSS). The PNSS provides large samples of women with 
4:104:6765:27:28:72:512:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:information on the exact date of enrollment in WIC along with screens for smoking before, 
4:105:6855:28:27:72:222:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:during and after pregnancy. 1    
4:106:6888:27:28:108:539:157:144:Times:144:Times:A:WIC participants are a particularly apt group on which to focus.  First, over 40 percent of 
4:107:6980:28:24:72:535:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:all births in the U.S. are to women on WIC, the vast majority of whom have incomes below 185 
4:108:7073:24:7:216:219:105:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                 
4:109:7121:7:14:72:541:98:36:Times:81:Times:F:1 The Pregnancy Nutrition Surveillance System (PNSS) monitors the health and nutritional status of low-income pregnant women 
4:110:7246:14:10:71:489:84:81:Times:81:Times:F:and infants in federally funded programs.  The overwhelming majority of women in the PNSS are enrolled in WIC: 
4:111:7357:10:0:71:183:74:81:Times:81:Times:F:http://www.cdc.gov/pednss.     
5:112:7389:0:27:72:535:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:percent of the federal poverty level.   Second, the prevalence of smoking is much greater among 
5:113:7485:27:28:72:540:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:WIC participants than the national average.  In 2006, 44.7 percent of white non-Hispanic women 
5:114:7580:28:27:72:530:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the PNSS smoked 3 months prior to pregnancy, 27.3 percent reported smoking three months 
5:115:7671:27:28:72:539:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:before delivery, and 35 percent smoked postpartum. Comparative figures for black non-Hispanic 
5:116:7765:28:28:72:546:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:women pre-pregnancy, pre-delivery and postpartum are 17.8, 9.3 and 17.3 percent, respectively.2   
5:117:7863:28:27:107:506:570:144:Times:144:Times:A:A third reason to focus on WIC and smoking is the growing debate on whether the 
5:118:7943:27:28:71:518:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:reported association between WIC and improved birth outcomes is causal [12-17].   There is 
5:119:8034:28:27:71:537:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:little evidence in the clinical literature to suggest that nutritional supplementation in a developed 
5:120:8136:27:28:71:516:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:country like the US is protective against preterm birth and fetal growth retardation [18, 19].  
5:121:8232:28:28:71:525:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:Those who defend a causal association between WIC and improved birth outcomes argue that 
5:122:8321:28:27:71:540:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:WIC provides more than nutritional support [14, 17].  Health education and timely referrals, they 
5:123:8419:27:28:71:538:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:argue, may be the more effective aspects of the program.  Counseling on the dangers of smoking 
5:124:8514:28:27:71:534:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:is cited as important example.  To date, however, little evidence has emerged that links prenatal 
5:125:8612:27:28:71:358:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:participation in WIC with decreases in maternal smoking.   
5:126:8671:28:27:107:542:322:144:Times:144:Times:A:In this paper, we provide the first population-based assessment of the association between 
5:127:8762:27:28:71:507:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:prenatal WIC participation and maternal smoking using information about smoking that is 
5:128:8850:28:28:71:536:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:substantially more detailed than what has been available from previous studies of WIC [20-23].  
5:129:8946:28:27:71:492:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:We describe the prevalence of smoking among WIC recipients before, during and after 
5:130:9030:27:28:71:532:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:pregnancy, and we create indicators of smoking cessation and relapse.    Generating population-

5:132:9218:27:28:71:541:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:pregnancy and after delivery  provides an important test of one important aspect of WIC’s role in 
5:133:9316:28:41:71:258:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:advancing maternal and infant health.

6:139:9512:27:28:107:531:626:144:Times:144:Times:A:Public maternity health clinics, many of which offer on-site WIC programs, ought to be 
6:140:9599:28:28:72:537:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:promising venues to encourage smoking cessation among poor women, yet projects described in 
6:141:9691:28:27:72:537:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:the literature yield mixed results. In the 1986 Smoking Cessation in Pregnancy project, pregnant 
6:142:9788:27:28:72:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:smokers on WIC and in public health clinics received short counseling sessions and self-help 
6:143:9881:28:27:71:533:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:literature [24]. In the eighth month of pregnancy, the treated group had significantly higher self-
6:144:9980:27:28:71:543:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:reported quit rates compared with the control group (13% versus 9.5%). However, “verified” quit 
6:145:10076:28:28:71:535:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:rates, obtained by analyzing urine specimens for cotinine, were not significantly different (5.9% 
6:146:10174:28:27:71:143:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:versus 6.1%).  
6:147:10189:27:28:107:501:405:144:Times:144:Times:A: A randomized trial looked at the impact of including smoking cessation advice in 
6:148:10270:28:27:71:507:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:prenatal care. Urine specimens were analyzed to verify quitting. There were no significant 
6:149:10361:27:28:71:516:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects of counseling in preventing relapses during pregnancy or at the six-week postpartum 
6:150:10453:28:27:71:520:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:follow-up [25]. Another trial randomly assigned pregnant women who had smoked earlier in 
6:151:10542:27:28:71:537:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:pregnancy but had quit by the first prenatal visit to receive either usual physician advice or more 
6:152:10642:28:28:71:539:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:structured advice along with individual relapse counseling [26]. Researchers found no difference 
6:153:10739:28:27:71:526:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:either in relapse rates during pregnancy, or at one year postpartum. Other researchers reported 
6:154:10835:27:28:71:541:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher verified quit rates for pregnant smokers receiving interventions, with one of two treatment 
6:155:10934:28:27:71:511:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:groups having significantly higher quit rates than the control group (14% versus 2%). [27]. 
6:156:11026:27:28:107:490:157:144:Times:144:Times:A: A more recent program randomized six community health centers serving WIC 
6:157:11100:28:28:71:542:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:participants to either special intervention or usual care [28]. Intervention clinics provided tailored 
6:158:11203:28:0:71:525:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:cessation services and systematic follow-ups. The mean abstinence rate in intervention clinics 
7:159:11299:0:27:72:537:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:(26%) significantly exceeded that in usual care clinics (12%). This effect was not sustained at 3- 
7:160:11398:27:28:72:254:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:and 6-month postpartum follow-ups.  
7:161:11434:28:27:108:507:653:144:Times:144:Times:A: A summary of the literature on prenatal smoking interventions found that effective 
7:162:11517:27:28:72:525:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:programs used “designated providers” who were enlisted specifically to provide anti-smoking 
7:163:11609:28:28:72:534:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:advice [29]. The authors noted that “minimal contact programs that relied on existing staff” had 
7:164:11706:28:27:72:522:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:inconsistent results. Successful programs provided plenty of reinforcement, including one-on-
7:165:11799:27:28:72:535:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:one contact, home visits, and printed materials.  A more recent review reinforced these points: a 
7:166:11897:28:27:72:521:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:brief cessation session of as little at 5 to 15 minutes when delivered by a trained provider can 
7:167:11994:27:28:72:535:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:achieve significant increases in prenatal smoking cessation when compared to routine advice on 
7:168:12089:28:28:72:216:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:the dangers of smoking [30].  
7:169:12119:28:27:108:527:432:144:Times:144:Times:A:It is unclear, however, whether WIC, as currently structured, can deliver even the brief 
7:170:12208:27:28:72:542:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:but focused services that effective intervention programs entail. A 2001 GAO report to Congress, 
7:171:12305:28:27:72:503:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:while not specifically focused on smoking cessation, found that among six WIC agencies 
7:172:12392:27:28:72:523:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:studied, individual counseling averaged 4 to 17 minutes [31]. Agencies are mandated to offer 
7:173:12485:28:27:72:536:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:only two sessions every six months. However, recipients are not required to attend any sessions, 
7:174:12582:27:28:72:351:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:whether they are nutrition- or smoking-oriented [12, 32].  
7:175:12641:28:28:72:75:267:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
7:176:12641:28:27:283:331:239:144:Times:144:Times:?:Methods 
7:177:12649:27:28:108:513:212:144:Times:144:Times:A:Data are from the Pregnancy Nutrition Surveillance System (PNSS), a public health 
7:178:12731:28:27:72:521:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:monitoring system overseen by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). State 
7:179:12821:27:28:72:519:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:participation in the PNSS is voluntary; currently, only 22 states and three tribal governments 
7:180:12916:28:28:72:521:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:submit records to the CDC. The PNSS was created to assess maternal nutrition needs and the 
7:181:13007:28:0:72:521:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:prevalence of adverse birth outcomes among low-income women. Ninety-nine percent of the 
8:182:13096:0:27:72:533:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:PNSS records are sourced from prenatal and postpartum WIC interviews of participating states, 
8:183:13190:27:28:72:526:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:with the remainder coming from other public health programs.  Clinics collect the data, which 
8:184:13284:28:27:72:524:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:are then aggregated at the state level before being submitted to the CDC on a quarterly basis.3 
8:185:13379:27:28:72:531:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:PNSS combines the advantage of administrative data and its detailed information on the timing 
8:186:13473:28:28:72:493:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:of WIC enrollment with that of survey data and its information on health outcomes and 
8:187:13559:28:27:71:520:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:behaviors.   PNSS data on maternal health and behaviors are richer than those available from 
8:188:13652:27:28:71:519:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:birth certificates, which have been the primary source of outcomes in previous prenatal WIC 
8:189:13744:28:27:71:311:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:evaluations using secondary data [21-23, 33-37].  
8:190:13794:27:28:107:526:488:144:Times:144:Times:A:Access to PNSS records was granted on a state-by-state basis. We requested data from 
8:191:13879:28:28:71:516:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:ten states with the largest caseloads: Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, 
8:192:13975:28:27:71:531:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:North Carolina, New Jersey, Ohio, and Virginia. The North Carolina Division of Public Health 
8:193:14068:27:28:71:480:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:granted access to NC data, while the CDC provided records for the nine other states. 
8:194:14153:28:27:107:529:377:144:Times:144:Times:A:We eventually dropped Georgia due to missing pregravid smoking records, and Illinois 
8:195:14238:27:28:72:537:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:due to incomplete information on the timing of WIC enrollment.  Information on late-pregnancy 
8:196:14332:28:27:71:541:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:and/or postpartum smoking is missing for Florida, Indiana, and New Jersey. Our results therefore 
8:197:14429:27:28:71:507:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:include estimates with and without these three states, depending on the smoking outcome. 
8:198:14518:28:28:107:532:267:144:Times:144:Times:A:We limit the sample to singleton-birth women who enrolled in prenatal WIC, excluding 
8:199:14603:28:27:71:483:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:those who do not sign up until the postpartum period, as these women would have no 
8:200:14686:27:28:71:541:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:information on pregravid smoking. This sample of 1,925,387 women is further restricted to those 
8:201:14782:28:27:71:505:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:who have a complete set of indicators on smoking before pregnancy and smoking at WIC 
8:202:14867:27:28:71:480:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:registration.  We also drop women who enroll in WIC less than five weeks into their 
8:203:14951:28:28:72:514:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:pregnancies. In doing so, we assume that there may be measurement error; because the first 
8:204:15042:28:16:72:527:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:missed period is typically not detected until four weeks after the last one, it seems implausible 
8:205:15140:16:7:216:219:85:144:Times:144:Times:?:

9:207:15238:0:27:72:535:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:for a woman to be able to detect pregnancy as well as seek prenatal care and WIC appointments 
9:208:15332:27:28:72:535:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:within five weeks of conception. These exclusions, along with an additional 60 women dropped 
9:209:15425:28:27:71:528:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:due to missing ages, result in another 156,417 (8.8 percent of the final count) women removed 
9:210:15518:27:28:72:504:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:from the regression samples. Table 1 shows the set of states and years used in our various 
9:211:15609:28:28:72:539:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:analyses and the number of WIC participants by trimester of WIC enrollment.  In the full sample 
9:212:15705:28:27:72:409:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:(including FL, IN, and NJ), we have almost 1.8 million observations.

9:214:15775:28:27:72:165:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:Smoking outcomes 
9:215:15792:27:28:108:524:488:144:Times:144:Times:A:WIC participants are asked about smoking at various points when they register during 
9:216:15877:28:28:72:516:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:pregnancy and at their postpartum visit. At prenatal enrollment, women are asked about: (1) 
9:217:15969:28:27:72:526:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:smoking and number of cigarettes smoked per day three months before pregnancy; (2) current 
9:218:16060:27:28:72:524:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:smoking and number of cigarettes per day; (3) a multiple-choice question about the change in 
9:219:16153:28:27:72:538:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:smoking from the point just prior to pregnancy.  The latter question allows the women to choose 
9:220:16249:27:28:72:533:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:among responses such as “I quit as soon as I was pregnant”, “I reduced/increased my smoking” 
9:221:16342:28:27:72:503:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:or “I tried to quit but failed”.  Buescher (1997) writes that inclusion of partially favorable 
9:222:16437:27:28:72:543:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:answers increases smoking disclosure by pregnant women [3]. In assigning smoking status at any 
9:223:16532:28:28:72:487:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:point, we therefore assume that there are no false positives – that is, we only need one 
9:224:16621:28:27:72:525:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:affirmative response to classify a woman as a smoker, even if other variables show otherwise. 
9:225:16715:27:28:72:538:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:Over 16,000 women (less than 1 percent of the regression sample or 1.5 percent of the final tally 
9:226:16813:28:27:72:522:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:of pregravid smokers) who were initially counted as pregravid nonsmokers but were smokers 
9:227:16903:27:28:72:497:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:during pregnancy are also reclassified as pregravid smokers. (Not reclassifying does not 
9:228:16992:28:28:72:526:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:significantly change results.)  At postpartum enrollment, women are asked about: (1) smoking 
9:229:17085:28:0:72:538:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:during the last three months of pregnancy and (2) smoking as of the postpartum period. In North 
10:230:17182:0:27:72:517:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:Carolina, there is no explicit question about smoking during the last 3 months of pregnancy. 
10:231:17275:27:28:72:507:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:PNSS files in North Carolina are linked to birth certificates, however; we use the smoking 
10:232:17366:28:27:72:519:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:indicator on birth certificates as a proxy for late-pregnancy smoking. (Regressions using this 
10:233:17461:27:28:72:493:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:indicator do not significantly differ when North Carolina is excluded from the sample.) 
10:234:17549:28:28:107:534:598:144:Times:144:Times:A:The screen for smoking is substantially more detailed than what has been available from 
10:235:17637:28:27:72:528:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:linkages of administrative data and birth certificates.4   We describe not only the prevalence of 
10:236:17735:27:28:72:535:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:smoking among WIC recipients before, during and after pregnancy, but also create indicators of 
10:237:17830:28:27:72:506:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:smoking cessation and relapse.  The prevalence of smoking is simply the proportion of all 
10:238:17920:27:28:71:513:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:women who report smoking at a specific point around pregnancy.  To measure quitting, we 
10:239:18008:28:28:71:539:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:analyze the subset of women who report smoking both three months before pregnancy and at the 
10:240:18101:28:27:71:501:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:interview for prenatal WIC enrollment.   These same women are asked at the postpartum 
10:241:18187:27:28:71:542:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:interview whether they currently smoke and whether they smoked three months before delivery.   
10:242:18282:28:27:71:542:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:Thus, a woman is characterized as having quit if she smokes at the prenatal interview, but reports 
10:243:18381:27:28:71:506:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:not smoking three months before delivery.  We create a second indicator of quitting if she 
10:244:18472:28:27:71:538:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:smokes at the prenatal interview, but not at postpartum.  We then associate quitting to the timing 
10:245:18571:27:28:72:178:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:of WIC enrollment.    
10:246:18593:28:28:108:535:267:144:Times:144:Times:A:Participation in WIC may also prevent relapse.   Our indicator of relapse is derived from 
10:247:18683:28:27:72:538:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:the subset of women who smoked three months before pregnancy but who report not smoking at 
10:248:18774:27:75:71:529:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:the prenatal interview.   A woman is characterized as having relapsed if she reports smoking at 
10:249:18870:75:10:72:75:137:144:Times:36:Times:B:                                                 4
10:250:18919:10:11:75:524:127:81:Times:81:Times:F: Arguably the most influential study of WIC based on linkages between birth certificates and administrative data is the 1992 
10:251:19044:11:10:71:525:116:81:Times:81:Times:F:article by Devaney, Bilheimer, and Schore [21]. Remarkably there was no indicator for smoking.   More recent linkages have 
10:252:19167:10:10:71:522:106:81:Times:81:Times:F:relied on the dichotomous question, “Did you smoke during pregnancy?” which is available on birth certificates. There is no 
10:253:19291:10:11:72:538:96:81:Times:81:Times:F:indication on the timing of smoking or whether the woman has changed the amount she smokes.  Thus, a woman who smoked in 
10:254:19412:11:11:71:450:85:81:Times:81:Times:F:the first trimester but then quit should technically answer yes but it is unclear how many do [20, 22, 23].

11:256:19522:0:27:72:513:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:the postpartum interview.5   If WIC facilitates quitting and protects against relapse, then we 
11:257:19617:27:28:72:541:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:would expect that women who enroll early in pregnancy will be more likely to quit or not relapse 
11:258:19714:28:27:72:534:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:than women who enroll later and who have less exposure to the nutritional and health education

11:264:20050:27:28:72:531:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:sources and through associations with observable biological consequences of tobacco exposure 
11:265:20143:28:28:72:192:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:among PNSS newborns. 
11:266:20164:28:27:72:315:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:a. Comparisons with BRFSS and birth certificates 
11:267:20213:27:28:108:504:405:144:Times:144:Times:A:Research suggests that the accuracy of smoking classification can be improved by 
11:268:20294:28:27:72:511:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:inquiring about pre-pregnancy smoking, which women are more likely to report, as well as 
11:269:20383:27:28:72:535:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:letting smokers convey behavioral changes, such as quitting during pregnancy or decreasing the 
11:270:20478:28:27:72:523:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:amount smoked, via multiple-choice questions [5]. Results from a randomized trial show that 
11:271:20570:27:28:72:518:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:such questions significantly improve disclosure rates compared with a dichotomous (yes/no) 
11:272:20661:28:28:72:525:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:format, such as those found on birth certificates [6]. The PNSS not only incorporates multiple-
11:273:20756:28:27:72:531:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:choice questions, but also elicits information on quantity smoked before and during pregnancy. 
11:274:20851:27:34:72:509:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:Further, women who return to enroll postpartum are again asked about late-pregnancy and 
11:275:20939:34:8:216:219:178:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                 
11:276:20987:8:16:72:503:170:42:Times:100:Times:F:5 There is more than one possible category of relapsers. One consists of smokers who quit by prenatal WIC 
11:277:21093:16:11:71:538:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:enrollment and are marked as having resumed by postpartum registration. Another is the group of women who were 
11:278:21204:11:12:71:515:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:still smoking at prenatal WIC, reported quitting sometime within the last 3 months of pregnancy, and resumed 
11:279:21313:12:11:71:539:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:postpartum. We chose the first category because of the clearer sequence between exposure to WIC and changing the 
11:280:21426:11:12:71:537:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:smoking decision. That is, a woman quits before prenatal WIC, has a chance to hear reinforcing antismoking advice 
11:281:21540:12:11:71:526:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:by enrollment, then has the period until the postpartum interview to stay quit or relapse. For the second category, 
11:282:21656:11:12:71:538:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:capturing smokers who quit during WIC exposure is more difficult as these women may have very little time to quit 
11:283:21770:12:11:71:522:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:between enrollment and the last 3 months of pregnancy. This would be particularly problematic for 3rd-trimester 
11:284:21882:11:0:72:467:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:participants, e.g. those enrolling in the 8th month of pregnancy who only had until month 9 to quit. 
12:285:21985:0:27:72:542:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:current smoking, potentially enhancing disclosure among women who relapse after prenatal WIC 
12:286:22078:27:28:72:528:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:registration.   Comparisons of the smoking prevalence among our PNSS population with those 
12:287:22169:28:27:72:519:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:from other sources such as the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System6 indicate that for 
12:288:22262:27:28:71:523:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:women of comparable socio-economic status, our measures are very similar to those reported 
12:289:22353:28:28:71:267:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:elsewhere (data available upon request).

12:291:22394:27:28:71:211:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:b. Smoking and birth weight 
12:292:22422:28:27:107:532:515:144:Times:144:Times:A: An indirect way to assess the quality of the smoking measure in the PNSS is to estimate 
12:293:22510:27:28:71:528:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:its association with birth weight and other birth outcomes.  The impact of prenatal smoking on 
12:294:22605:28:28:71:513:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:birth weight is one the most consistent and widely accepted epidemiological findings in the 
12:295:22697:28:27:71:507:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:literature [1]. We should find, therefore, that the adjusted mean differences in birth weight 
12:296:22791:27:28:71:540:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:among women who report no smoking should exceed those of women who smoked three months 
12:297:22878:28:27:71:527:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:before pregnancy since not all pregravid smokers quit.  Similarly, women who report smoking 
12:298:22970:27:28:71:538:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:before but not during pregnancy should have higher mean birth weights than those who continue 
12:299:23064:28:27:71:524:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:smoking during pregnancy.   Similar patterns should hold when we stratify by the intensity of 
12:300:23158:27:28:71:530:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:smoking.   The presentation of this evidence begins with Figure 1, which shows the unadjusted 
12:301:23252:28:28:71:512:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:mean birth weight by four levels of smoking: 1) non-smokers; 2) women who smoked only 
12:302:23338:28:27:71:519:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:before pregnancy; 3) women who smoked before pregnancy and at WIC enrollment but who 
12:303:23423:27:28:71:541:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:reported not smoking in the last three months before delivery; and 4) women who smoked before 
12:304:23517:28:27:71:517:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:pregnancy, at WIC enrollment and in the last 3 months of pregnancy. There is essentially no 
12:305:23609:27:28:71:512:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:difference in mean birth weight between non-smokers and those who smoked three months 
12:306:23695:28:28:71:530:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:before pregnancy but who reported not smoking thereafter.  This provides some confidence for 
12:307:23788:28:16:71:501:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:the accuracy for our smoking screen since we would expect no difference in birth weight 
12:308:23876:16:7:216:219:85:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                 
12:309:23924:7:0:72:173:78:36:Times:81:Times:F:6 http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/ 
13:310:23952:0:27:72:519:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:between non-smokers and pregravid smokers, if the latter truly stopped when pregnant.    By 
13:311:24044:27:28:72:518:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:contrast, the difference in mean birth weight between non-smokers and women who smoked 
13:312:24131:28:27:72:505:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:three months before delivery is substantial, about 200 grams, which accords well with the 
13:313:24221:27:28:72:539:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:epidemiological literature.  Women who report smoking at the WIC enrollment but who claim to 
13:314:24314:28:28:72:536:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:have stopped by the third trimester show a deficit in birth weight that is approximately one-third 
13:315:24413:28:27:72:517:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:as large as that among women who reported smoking in the 3 months before delivery.   This 
13:316:24503:27:28:72:524:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:difference also accords with the epidemiological literature.  In a study that used a randomized 
13:317:24599:28:27:72:523:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:design with a biological marker to screen for smoking, women who stopped before the eighth 
13:318:24690:27:28:72:521:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:month of pregnancy had infants whose birth weights were less but did not differ significantly 
13:319:24784:28:28:72:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:from those who quit smoking before randomization [38].  This relationship between smoking and 
13:320:24878:28:27:72:303:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:birth weight persists across race and ethnicity.   
13:321:24929:27:28:108:527:405:144:Times:144:Times:A:In Figure 2, we repeat these comparisons for the incidence of low birth weight (< 2500 
13:322:25016:28:27:72:533:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:grams), preterm birth (< 37 weeks gestation) and small for gestational age (SGA).7  The pattern 
13:323:25112:27:28:72:527:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:observed for mean birth weight is evident for low birth weight and SGA but not preterm birth, 
13:324:25206:28:27:71:530:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:which again largely conforms to the literature.   The association between prenatal smoking and 
13:325:25301:27:28:71:522:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:preterm birth is much less pronounced than its association with fetal growth retardation [18].  
13:326:25397:28:28:107:509:267:144:Times:144:Times:A: As a further indication that our smoking screen has credible accuracy, we show the 
13:327:25480:28:27:71:539:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:adjusted mean differences in birth weight, birth weight controlling for gestation, and SGA by the 
13:328:25578:27:28:71:513:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:timing of smoking and smoking intensity (Table 2).   There is impressive consistency along 
13:329:25669:28:27:71:525:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:several dimensions: (1) women who report smoking 10 or fewer cigarettes per day experience 
13:330:25760:27:72:71:533:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:the smallest birth weight deficits; (2) this dose-response holds regardless of whether smoking is 
13:331:25858:72:7:216:219:85:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                 
13:332:25906:7:0:72:312:78:36:Times:81:Times:F:7 We used the cutoffs as reported by Alexander, et al. (1998) [39]. 
14:333:25976:0:27:72:523:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:ascertained before, during or after pregnancy; and (3) the pattern persists in the full sample of 
14:334:26074:27:28:72:515:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:states and when we limit the sample to Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio (columns 2-4).8   
14:335:26165:28:27:108:521:653:144:Times:144:Times:A: In sum, biologically verified screens for smoking based are indisputably the preferred 
14:336:26252:27:28:72:540:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:standard.  Nevertheless, detailed questions at various points around pregnancy are more practical 
14:337:26350:28:28:72:525:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:for large populations and administrative data bases.  The smoking screen in the PNSS appears 
14:338:26443:28:27:72:542:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:superior to birth certificates and provide associations with birth outcomes that are consistent with 
14:339:26544:27:28:72:181:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:more refined screens.  
14:340:26567:28:27:72:157:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:Empirical Model 
14:341:26583:27:28:108:529:488:144:Times:144:Times:A:We are interested in the association between exposure to WIC and smoking.   If WIC’s 
14:342:26668:28:28:72:528:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:nutritional and health education messages are effective, then the longer a women is enrolled in 
14:343:26764:28:27:72:534:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:WIC during pregnancy, the less likely she should smoke, the more likely she should quit, or the 
14:344:26860:27:28:72:529:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:less likely she should relapse if she had quit before enrolling in WIC.9   A linear version of our 
14:345:26959:28:28:72:444:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:empirical model is as follows (we have suppressed subscripts for simplicity): 
14:346:27037:28:29:108:373:349:144:Times:144:Times:A: (1)                     S = α0 + α1WIC1 + α2WIC2 + Xβ + e. 
14:347:27097:29:28:72:523:320:144:Times:144:Times:B:Let S be an indicator of smoking; let the WICk variables indicate the trimester of pregnancy a 
14:348:27192:28:29:72:528:292:144:Times:144:Times:B:woman enrolled in the program.   We expect α1 < α2 < 0 for smoking participation and relapse 
14:349:27285:29:27:72:528:263:144:Times:144:Times:B:and the reverse for desirable outcomes such as quitting.  The omitted group consists of women 
14:350:27379:27:28:72:527:236:144:Times:144:Times:B:who do not sign up for WIC until their third trimester. We also adjust for characteristics of the 
14:351:27477:28:113:72:515:208:144:Times:144:Times:B:mother such as race/ethnicity, age, marital status, pre-pregnancy BMI, parity, poverty level, 
14:352:27571:113:7:216:219:95:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                 
14:353:27619:7:14:72:315:88:36:Times:81:Times:F:8 These states have data for both gestation and smoking outcomes.  
14:354:27686:14:0:72:74:74:81:Times:81:Times:F: 
15:355:27688:0:27:72:532:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:participation in Medicaid/TANF/Food Stamps, household size, and include state and year fixed 
15:356:27781:27:28:72:289:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects (X). Finally, let e be the error term. 10  
15:357:27832:28:27:108:536:653:144:Times:144:Times:A:Although the statistical estimation of Equation (1) is straightforward, obtaining unbiased 
15:358:27923:27:29:72:526:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates of treatment effects associated with WIC is quite challenging. In econometric terms, 
15:359:28018:29:28:72:535:597:144:Times:144:Times:B:the coefficients on WIC, α1 and α2, estimate the average effect of treatment on the treated under 
15:360:28116:28:28:72:533:569:144:Times:144:Times:B:two assumptions: first, that the decision to participate in WIC, conditional on X, is uncorrelated 
15:361:28215:28:28:71:531:541:144:Times:144:Times:B:with smoking or the change in smoking prior to pregnancy; and second, that the expected gains 
15:362:28309:28:27:72:525:513:144:Times:144:Times:B:to participation in WIC are constant across individuals or if they are not, then women have no 
15:363:28404:27:28:72:530:486:144:Times:144:Times:B:way of anticipating the gains [41, 42].   These are strong assumptions and would be violated if, 
15:364:28501:28:27:72:535:458:144:Times:144:Times:B:for example, women who enroll early in WIC are more health-conscious and more likely to quit 
15:365:28594:27:28:72:528:431:144:Times:144:Times:B:than women who enroll later. Alternatively, women with more serious smoking problems may 
15:366:28683:28:28:72:541:403:144:Times:144:Times:B:seek out WIC earlier in an effort to obtain help with their addiction. Ideally, we would like to use 
15:367:28784:28:27:72:537:375:144:Times:144:Times:B:instrumental variables to purge these forms of selection bias, but we lack a credible instrument.   
15:368:28884:27:28:72:478:348:144:Times:144:Times:B:Indeed, we know of no study that has been able to instrument convincingly for WIC 
15:369:28966:28:27:72:145:320:144:Times:144:Times:B:participation.   
15:370:28983:27:28:108:524:293:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our identification strategy, therefore, takes several practical approaches.  First, we are 
15:371:29074:28:27:71:512:265:144:Times:144:Times:B:limited to only women on WIC, and thus, we compare the effect of early as opposed to late 
15:372:29164:27:28:71:521:238:144:Times:144:Times:B:exposure to WIC on maternal smoking. One advantage of this comparison is that everyone is 
15:373:29254:28:28:71:533:210:144:Times:144:Times:B:eligible for WIC and everyone participates.  Stigma or other barriers to participation in publicly 
15:374:29353:28:27:72:536:182:144:Times:144:Times:B:funded nutrition programs are thus unlikely to be factors in our analysis.   Second, we have very 
15:375:29451:27:46:72:501:155:144:Times:144:Times:B:large samples that enable us to analyze smoking separately for non-Hispanic whites, non-
15:376:29539:46:9:216:219:109:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                 
15:377:29587:9:16:72:540:100:64:Times:81:Times:F:10 Because there has been little change in smoking in the states and years of our sample, we do not include cigarette prices in this 
15:378:29719:16:10:71:507:84:81:Times:81:Times:F:model. Following Levy and Meara (2006), we tested changes in smoking around the time of the 1998 Master Settlement 
15:379:29834:10:0:71:542:74:81:Times:144:Times:B:Agreement [40]  Consistent with the authors’ findings, we did not find any significant difference in smoking after the settlement.  
16:380:29966:0:27:72:514:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:Hispanic blacks, and Hispanics.11  Third, we use falsification checks as a means of flagging 
16:381:30059:27:28:72:523:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:potential contamination from omitted variable bias.  The clinical literature indicates that most 
16:382:30156:28:27:71:532:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:pregnant smokers quit when they realize that they are pregnant; these women are often referred 
16:383:30251:27:28:72:534:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:to as “spontaneous quitters” [25, 43-45]. Spontaneous quitting should be unrelated to the timing 
16:384:30348:28:28:72:537:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:of WIC enrollment.  Any association between early WIC enrollment and spontaneous quitting is 
16:385:30441:28:27:72:509:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:likely due to selection bias, since quitting precedes enrollment.  We have two indicators of 
16:386:30534:27:28:72:515:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:spontaneous quitting.  This first is a dichotomous indicator that is one if the woman smoked 
16:387:30627:28:27:72:503:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:three months before pregnancy but reports not smoking at time of WIC enrollment.   One 
16:388:30714:27:28:72:519:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:limitation of this indicator is that we don’t know when the woman quit.   Thus, we also use a 
16:389:30808:28:28:72:529:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:second indicator.  At WIC enrollment, women are asked if they smoke, and if so, whether they 
16:390:30901:28:27:72:509:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:have reduced their smoking or quit altogether.   One of the possible responses is, “Stopped 
16:391:30993:27:28:72:519:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:smoking before my first prenatal care visit.” 12  We use this second indicator as a measure of 
16:392:31088:28:27:72:409:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:spontaneous quitting and associate it with timing of WIC enrollment.  
16:393:31158:27:28:287:327:350:144:Times:144:Times:?:Results 
16:394:31166:28:27:107:529:322:144:Times:144:Times:A: The four smoking series in Figure 3 show the prevalence of smoking at different points 
16:395:31253:27:28:71:525:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:around pregnancy by week of enrollment in WIC.  Consider women who enroll in WIC in the 
16:396:31341:28:28:71:529:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:13th week of pregnancy.   Approximately 45 percent smoke three months before pregnancy; 35 
16:397:31432:28:27:72:532:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:percent continue to smoke when questioned at prenatal enrollment into WIC; approximately 26 
16:398:31524:27:28:72:527:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:percent report smoking three months prior to delivery and 28 percent smoke at the postpartum 
16:399:31617:28:27:72:540:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:interview.  Much of the data in Figure 3 previews the results.  First, the prevalence of smoking at 
16:400:31717:27:32:72:487:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:any point is always greater among women who enroll in WIC in the first trimester but 
16:401:31802:32:8:216:219:125:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                 
16:402:31850:8:18:72:528:117:64:Times:100:Times:F:11 The standard regression in the literature pools all races and ethnicities and includes dichotomous indicators for 
16:403:31966:18:11:71:537:99:100:Times:100:Times:F:each.  Our specification is equivalent to a fully interacted model by race and ethnicity.  The difference is potentially 
16:404:32087:11:8:71:351:88:100:Times:100:Times:F:important because smoking varies dramatically by race and ethnicity. 
16:405:32156:8:0:72:395:80:64:Times:100:Times:F:12 For most women, registration for prenatal care precedes enrollment in WIC.   
17:406:32237:0:27:72:530:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:differences with respect to timing of WIC enrollment remain relatively flat thereafter.  Second, 
17:407:32334:27:28:72:496:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:the difference in the prevalence of smoking between the different series at each week of 
17:408:32423:28:27:72:525:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:enrollment reflects quitting.   Again consider women who enrolled in WIC in the 13th week of 
17:409:32516:27:28:72:517:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:pregnancy. The difference in smoking from the period three months before pregnancy to the 
17:410:32606:28:28:72:533:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:point of WIC enrollment implies a quit rate of about 22 percent [(45-35)/45], which most likely 
17:411:32702:28:27:72:517:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:represents spontaneous quitting.   By contrast, the difference in smoking between those who 
17:412:32794:27:28:72:539:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:smoke at enrollment and those who smoked three months before delivery is a margin over which 
17:413:32887:28:27:72:496:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:WIC may be effective at promoting cessation.   If WIC effectiveness on quitting is dose-
17:414:32975:27:28:72:541:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:dependent, however, we might expect the two series to converge as women enrolled in WIC later 
17:415:33069:28:28:72:527:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:in pregnancy.   In other words, if greater exposure to WIC’s nutritional and health-educational 
17:416:33165:28:27:72:537:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:messages is more effective than less exposure, then the percentage point decline in smoking, the 
17:417:33262:27:28:72:531:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:vertical distance between the two series, should be greater the earlier a woman enrolls in WIC.  
17:418:33359:28:27:72:537:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:In fact, we observe about an 8-9 percentage-point difference between the prevalence of smoking 
17:419:33454:27:28:72:521:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:at WIC enrollment and the prevalence three months before delivery.   The difference appears 
17:420:33546:28:27:72:534:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:unchanged throughout pregnancy, which suggests that WIC has little dose-dependent impact on 
17:421:33638:27:28:72:534:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:quitting, but we cannot discount the possibility that the program may exert a one-time threshold 
17:422:33735:28:28:72:540:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:effect at the time of enrollment.  The important caveat is that these differences are unadjusted for 
17:423:33836:28:27:72:450:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:maternal characteristics. We turn next, therefore, to the multivariate analyses.  
17:424:33918:27:29:108:538:212:144:Times:144:Times:A:In Table 3 we show adjusted differences in the prevalence of smoking before, during and 
17:425:34006:29:28:72:527:183:144:Times:144:Times:B:after pregnancy (α1 and  α2 from Equation 1).  Estimates are obtained by probit regressions.13  
17:426:34102:28:28:71:541:155:144:Times:144:Times:B:Based on the estimates in the first two panels, women who enroll in WIC in the first trimester are 
17:427:34201:28:22:71:518:127:144:Times:144:Times:B:2.7 percentage points more likely to be smoking before pregnancy and 2.3 percentage points 
17:428:34292:22:7:216:219:105:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                 
17:429:34340:7:14:72:534:98:36:Times:81:Times:F:13 We use the routine in Stata 9.2 to obtain marginal effects.  In the case of dichotomous indicators such as the trimester of WIC 
17:430:34471:14:10:72:540:84:81:Times:81:Times:F:enrollment, the routine reports the difference in the probability of the outcome with the indicator on and then off holding constant 
17:431:34604:10:0:72:224:74:81:Times:81:Times:F:the other covariates at their mean values.  
18:432:34650:0:27:72:532:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:more likely to smoke at WIC enrollment than women who enroll in WIC in the third trimester.  
18:433:34743:27:28:72:531:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:This represents about a 10 percent difference based on the mean prevalence of smoking at each 
18:434:34837:28:27:72:535:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:point in time and suggests that early enrollees in WIC may be adversely selected with respect to 
18:435:34934:27:28:72:540:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:smoking.  In the bottom two panels, we display the adjusted prevalence of smoking three months 
18:436:35029:28:28:72:531:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:before delivery and postpartum.  Here we find no meaningful differences by the timing of WIC 
18:437:35122:28:27:72:513:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:enrollment.  The lack of a difference implies that women who enroll early in WIC are more 
18:438:35212:27:28:72:363:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:likely to quit.   In the next set of results we test this directly. 
18:439:35280:28:27:108:513:515:144:Times:144:Times:A:In Table 4 we focus on quitting and relapse.  Quitting is based on the sub-sample of 
18:440:35365:27:28:72:524:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:women who report smoking at prenatal WIC enrollment.  Thirty-four percent of these women 
18:441:35454:28:28:72:531:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:report quitting between prenatal enrollment and three months before delivery, and 23.3 percent 
18:442:35549:28:27:72:537:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:report quitting between prenatal enrollment and the postpartum interview.  The results in the top 
18:443:35647:27:28:72:507:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:two panels indicate that the probability of quitting before delivery is 4.5 percentage points 
18:444:35741:28:27:72:538:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:greater among first trimester enrollees and 3.2 percentage points greater among second trimester 
18:445:35838:27:28:72:540:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:enrollees relative to women who enroll in the last trimester.   Overall, early enrollment in WIC is 
18:446:35938:28:27:72:484:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:associated with a quit rate that is approximately 14 percent greater than late enrollees 
18:447:36027:27:28:72:517:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:(0.045/0.344).    The results for postpartum quitting are similar.  The behavior of whites and 
18:448:36122:28:28:72:509:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:blacks appear the same, but we find no association with the timing of WIC enrollment and 
18:449:36211:28:27:72:201:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:quitting among Hispanics. 
18:450:36237:27:28:108:537:212:144:Times:144:Times:A:The bottom panel in Table 4 examines relapse.   The sample includes women who report 
18:451:36322:28:27:72:532:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:smoking three months before pregnancy, but who report not smoking at the prenatal interview.  
18:452:36416:27:28:72:524:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:A woman in this sub-sample has relapsed if she reports smoking at the postpartum interview.  
18:453:36509:28:28:72:501:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:Consider the results for all women.   The mean relapse rate is approximately 31 percent.  
18:454:36599:28:0:72:529:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:However, contrary to expectations, we find that first-trimester enrollment in WIC is associated 
19:455:36697:0:27:72:537:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:with a 2 percentage point increase in relapse.  Moreover, there are important racial differences.   
19:456:36797:27:28:72:527:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:White women who enroll in WIC in the first trimester are 3.6 percentage points more likely to 
19:457:36891:28:27:72:516:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:relapse whereas black women are 2.5 percentage points less likely to relapse.   Although the 
19:458:36984:27:28:72:526:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:results for relapse appear inconsistent with those for quitting, they are not directly comparable 
19:459:37082:28:28:72:503:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:since they are based on two different samples of pregravid smokers.  The quitting sample 
19:460:37171:28:27:72:511:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:includes all pregravid smokers who smoke at prenatal WIC enrollment whereas the relapse 
19:461:37259:27:28:72:511:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:sample is all pregravid smokers who report not smoking at enrollment.  However, if one of 
19:462:37349:28:27:72:522:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:WIC’s objectives is to promote maternal health among participants, then relapsing appears to 
19:463:37442:27:28:72:265:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:offset some of the gains from quitting.   
19:464:37484:28:28:108:511:460:144:Times:144:Times:A:Lastly, we examine quitting by the intensity of pregravid smoking (Table 6).   Most 
19:465:37568:28:27:72:514:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:research indicates that light smokers (1-10 cigarettes per day) are more likely to quit during 
19:466:37663:27:28:72:531:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:pregnancy than heavier smokers.  The mean level of quitting in our sample of WIC enrollees is 
19:467:37757:28:27:72:515:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:consistent with that finding.  The pre-delivery quit rate among light smokers is 43.1 percent 
19:468:37851:27:28:71:537:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:compared with 23.1 percent for women who smoke more than half a pack (11-20 cigarettes) and 
19:469:37943:28:27:71:534:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:15.3 percent among women who smoke more than a pack per day (21+).  However, within each 
19:470:38032:27:28:71:536:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:level of smoking, those who enroll in WIC in the first or second trimester are more likely to quit 
19:471:38131:28:28:71:523:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:than those who enroll in the third trimester.  The same pattern obtains for postpartum quitting 
19:472:38227:28:27:71:542:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Table 5, middle panel).    Turning to the results for relapse, we find that lightest smokers are less 
19:473:38330:27:28:71:512:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:likely to relapse than the heaviest smokers (22.1 versus 31.6 percent).  Unexpectedly, early 
19:474:38423:28:27:71:537:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:enrollment in WIC is associated with greater relapse.  For instance, consider women who smoke 
19:475:38517:27:28:71:531:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:up to a pack a day (11-20 cigarettes).  Those who enroll in WIC early are 6.0 percentage points 
19:476:38613:28:0:71:398:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:more likely to relapse than those who enroll in the third trimester.    
20:477:38687:0:27:108:520:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:A major concern with any evaluation of WIC based on observational data is selection 
20:478:38771:27:28:72:491:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:bias.   As noted above, we lack quasi-experimental variation in the assignment of WIC 
20:479:38857:28:27:72:535:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:enrollment with which to identify treatment effects.  Instead, we use falsification tests as way of 
20:480:38957:27:28:72:542:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:uncovering possible biases.  The outcome in each panel of Table 6 is whether a pregravid smoker 
20:481:39053:28:28:71:524:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:quit before enrolling in WIC.   Evidence of no bias would be a lack of an association between 
20:482:39147:28:27:71:532:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:pre-WIC quitting and the trimester of WIC enrollment.  The results are mixed.  In the top panel 
20:483:39243:27:28:71:540:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:of Table 6 we show that that whites are less likely to quit if they enroll early in WIC, but we find 
20:484:39344:28:27:71:532:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:no evidence of an association in the lower panel in which women are asked if they quit by their 
20:485:39440:27:28:71:518:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:first prenatal care visit.  For blacks we find evidence of an association suggestive of positive 
20:486:39537:28:28:71:536:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:selection bias. Black women who enroll in WIC early are more likely to report having quit prior 
20:487:39633:28:27:71:505:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:to enrollment.   The magnitude of the association is relatively large when compared to the 
20:488:39724:27:28:71:511:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:coefficients on quitting among black women in Table 4.   Thus, a substantial portion of the 
20:489:39816:28:27:71:532:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:association between early enrollment in WIC and a greater likelihood of quitting (and a smaller 
20:490:39912:27:28:71:520:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:likelihood of relapse) among black women is likely to have occurred without participation in 
20:491:40005:28:28:71:106:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:WIC.

20:493:40012:27:28:278:335:267:144:Times:144:Times:?:Discussion 
20:494:40023:28:27:107:511:239:144:Times:144:Times:A:We have shown in a broad population-based sample of women enrolled in the WIC 
20:495:40101:27:28:71:537:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:program that smoking prevalence declines throughout the course of pregnancy while women are 
20:496:40193:28:27:72:521:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:enrolled in the program.    Among women in MI, MO, NC, OH, and VA , the five states with 
20:497:40282:27:28:72:531:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:complete smoking records, the adjusted quit rate is 34.4 percent. Some of these women resume 
20:498:40375:28:0:72:497:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:smoking after delivery so that in the postpartum period 30.2 percent reported smoking.   
21:499:40466:0:27:108:532:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:Although these WIC-associated declines in smoking prevalence appear significant, they 
21:500:40552:27:28:72:500:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:are subject to important qualifications.  First, and most importantly, most of the smoking 
21:501:40643:28:27:72:533:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:cessation during pregnancy in this sample occurs, as has been reported in other data, at the time 
21:502:40741:27:28:72:501:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:the women realize they are pregnant before they have enrolled in the WIC program.  The 
21:503:40828:28:28:72:538:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:pregravid smoking rate among women within the five states with complete smoking records was 
21:504:40920:28:27:72:517:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:44.5 percent. By prenatal WIC enrollment, prevalence was at 33.7 percent, a decline of 10.8 
21:505:41012:27:28:72:538:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:percentage points. Three months before delivery, 25 percent of pregnant women smoked, so that 
21:506:41106:28:27:72:494:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:during the period of actual participation in the WIC program, there was a decline of 8.7 
21:507:41195:27:28:72:277:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:percentage points in smoking prevalence.  
21:508:41237:28:28:108:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:A:Second, we have no non-WIC women in our sample whose smoking behavior we can 
21:509:41314:28:27:72:524:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:directly compare to the WIC participants.  To understand how much of the smoking cessation 
21:510:41405:27:28:72:531:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:dynamics in our sample are potentially attributable to WIC participation, we must compare our 
21:511:41499:28:27:72:516:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:findings with what is known about changes in smoking behavior in general among pregnant 
21:512:41587:27:28:72:539:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:women.  Reviewing national data from the 1985 National Health Interview Survey, Fingerhut, et 
21:513:41681:28:27:72:509:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:al. (1990) found that smoking prevalence before pregnancy was 52.5 percent among white 
21:514:41768:27:28:72:509:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:unmarried women, a figure nearly identical to the 54.5 percent among white women in our 
21:515:41856:28:28:72:495:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:sample [46] .  In the Fingerhut study, 39.6 percent of these women quit smoking during 
21:516:41943:28:27:72:502:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:pregnancy, 27 percent early in pregnancy.   In our sample among white women, smoking 
21:517:42028:27:28:72:519:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:prevalence declined from 54.5% to 41% by the time of WIC enrollment, a decrease of 25%.  
21:518:42117:28:27:72:539:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:Although we do not know what percent of women in Fingerhut’s sample participated in the WIC 
21:519:42209:27:28:72:523:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:program, the similarity of the changes in smoking prevalence between Fingerhut’s unselected 
21:520:42301:28:28:72:537:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:data and our own suggest that women’s decisions to alter their smoking behavior may have little 
21:521:42397:28:0:72:223:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:to do with WIC participation.   
22:522:42431:0:27:108:537:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:Despite these reservations, our data do lend credence to the belief that WIC participation 
22:523:42522:27:28:72:524:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:has some influence on smoking behavior.  Exploiting the timing of WIC enrollment, we were 
22:524:42612:28:27:72:522:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:able to demonstrate that first trimester enrollment in WIC is associated with rates of smoking 
22:525:42707:27:28:72:517:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:cessation that are 14% higher (4.5 percentage points on a mean quit rate of 34.4 percent; see 
22:526:42801:28:28:72:532:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:Table 3) than late WIC enrollment.  When we restrict our sample to women who enroll early in 
22:527:42894:28:27:71:531:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:prenatal care we find identical results.  This suggests that these incremental quit rates represent 
22:528:42994:27:28:71:503:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:true WIC effects beyond what might be expected from prenatal care participation alone.   
22:529:43083:28:27:71:509:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:However, the effect of such modest quit rates on birth weight is unlikely to be substantial.  
22:530:43177:27:28:72:540:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:Assume a mean incidence of low birth weight of 10 percent and a population attributable risk for 
22:531:43274:28:28:72:532:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:low birth weight associated with smoking of 0.20.   Based on our estimates, early enrollment in 
22:532:43370:28:27:71:522:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:WIC increases quit rates by 4.5 percentage points.  The expected declined in rate of low birth 
22:533:43465:27:28:72:490:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:weight associated with early WIC and attributable to smoking cessation would be 0.27 
22:534:43550:28:27:72:273:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:percentage point [0.20*10*(4.5/33.7)].     
22:535:43593:27:28:108:530:350:144:Times:144:Times:A:This evaluation is important for a number of reasons.  First, the eight-state sample from 
22:536:43683:28:27:72:536:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:which the data are derived represents one of the largest national population-based compendiums 
22:537:43778:27:28:72:533:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:of WIC participants published to date.   Moreover, the screen for smoking in these data is much 
22:538:43874:28:28:72:529:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:more detailed than has been available from previous administrative databases.   We also adjust 
22:539:43969:28:27:72:531:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:our estimates with a relatively rich set of covariates, each of which is interacted with indicators 
22:540:44069:27:28:72:537:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:of race and ethnicity in an effort to minimize selection bias inherent in observational design.   In 
22:541:44170:28:27:72:528:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:addition, we use falsification tests that suggest no major contamination from omitted variables 
22:542:44266:27:28:72:503:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:among whites, but do point to positive selection among blacks.    The strength of the data 
22:543:44357:28:0:72:533:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:combined with the analytic approach leads us to conclude that these findings likely represent as 
23:544:44456:0:27:72:500:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:accurate a picture of the effect of WIC participation on smoking cessation as is currently 
23:545:44547:27:28:72:244:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:available from observational data.   
23:546:44584:28:27:108:537:653:144:Times:144:Times:A:The second important aspect of the current study involves its public policy implications.  
23:547:44675:27:28:72:504:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:Smoking ranks as one of the most powerful risk factors for adverse birth outcomes that is 
23:548:44765:28:28:72:513:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:preventable with changes in maternal behavior during pregnancy and the prevalence rate of 
23:549:44855:28:27:72:537:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:tobacco use among women eligible for the WIC program is lamentably high, particularly among 
23:550:44947:27:28:72:491:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:white women.   While controversy has arisen regarding the potential for the nutritional 
23:551:45035:28:27:72:503:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:supplementation provided by WIC vouchers to plausibly exert significant effects on birth 
23:552:45124:27:28:72:506:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:outcomes, increasing the rate at which women quit smoking would have clear benefits for 
23:553:45212:28:28:72:530:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:participants in this program.   Our findings suggest earlier enrollment demonstrates a small but 
23:554:45309:28:27:72:486:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:significant advantage with respect to smoking cessation compared to later enrollment. 
23:555:45395:27:28:72:522:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:Nevertheless, the increased quit rates associated with early enrollment in WIC are unlikely to 
23:556:45490:28:27:72:510:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:explain the 2 to 3 percentage point declines in low birth weight attributed to WIC in recent 
23:557:45583:27:28:72:265:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:observational studies [13, 14, 17, 47].    
23:558:45626:28:27:108:528:322:144:Times:144:Times:A:Compared with the impact of focused smoking cessation programs, the WIC effects on 
23:559:45709:27:28:72:519:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:smoking cessation described in our study are small.  In a summary of 16 trials, Melvin, et al. 
23:560:45804:28:28:72:513:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:(2000) found that women who received low-intensity but focused advice to reduce prenatal 
23:561:45893:28:27:71:519:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:smoking were 70 percent more likely to quit than women who received routine prenatal care 
23:562:45983:27:28:71:525:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:[30].   In this study, we show that quit rates are approximately 14 percent greater among early 
23:563:46079:28:27:71:515:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:compared to late WIC enrollees.   Since many of the studies reviewed in Melvin’s summary 
23:564:46168:27:28:71:542:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:involve focused counseling across multiple visits, the more modest findings in our study raise the 
23:565:46267:28:0:71:535:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:issue of how frequent and how targeted WIC smoking cessation counseling is in practice.  From 
24:566:46363:0:27:72:496:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:a policy standpoint this is important since it is questionable whether a differential of the 
24:567:46456:27:28:72:543:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:magnitude we have characterized would be likely to have a significant impact on birth outcomes.  
24:568:46553:28:27:108:485:653:144:Times:144:Times:A:There are several limitations to this study that must be acknowledged.  It is an 
24:569:46634:27:28:71:534:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:observational study limited to a sample from eight states.  The problem of unobservables, while 
24:570:46730:28:28:72:502:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:mitigated by the analytic approach, cannot be eliminated completely.  Without biological 
24:571:46819:28:27:72:538:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:markers of tobacco exposure the issue of potential misclassification will be impossible to avoid.  
24:572:46918:27:28:72:503:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:Heterogeneity in the content of WIC programs across states means that these findings are 
24:573:47007:28:27:72:525:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:averages within which some variation in WIC effectiveness is to be expected.  PNSS does not 
24:574:47099:27:28:72:512:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:include information on the number of counseling sessions; the timing of WIC enrollment is 
24:575:47189:28:28:72:536:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:therefore a proxy for the intensity of exposure, as early enrollees have at least the opportunity to 
24:576:47290:28:27:72:505:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:receive more frequent interventions, compared with those who sign up closer to delivery.  
24:577:47380:27:28:72:505:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:Finally, the absence of smoking information from before pregnancy on those women who 
24:578:47465:28:27:72:534:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:enrolled in WIC after delivery denied us the opportunity to compare directly women enrolled in 
24:579:47560:27:28:72:514:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:WIC during pregnancy with women enrolled in WIC postpartum.  Despite these caveats we 
24:580:47646:28:27:72:514:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:believe that the available evidence from this large population-based sample of WIC women 
24:581:47735:27:28:72:527:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:indicates that participation in WIC may have the potential to increase the rate at which women 
24:582:47830:28:28:72:496:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:quit smoking while pregnant but that there appears to be ample room to improve WIC’s 
24:583:47915:28:27:72:211:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:performance in this regard.
