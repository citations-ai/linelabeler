5:157:2849:35:20:85:514:723:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:This paper analyses the effect of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) on the employment 
5:158:2933:20:21:85:514:703:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:of  firms’  establishments  in  Finland.  M&As  are  a  key  device  to  enlarge  a  purchasing  
5:159:3030:21:21:85:517:682:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:firm  in  all  developed  countries.  For  instance,  in  Finland,  hardly  any  significant  
5:160:3124:21:20:85:514:661:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:restructuring  of  any  industry  has  been  carried  out  without  ownership  changes.  In  most  
5:161:3223:20:21:85:514:641:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:countries M&As have developed in a procyclical  manner.  There  is  no  upward  trend  in  
5:162:3314:21:21:85:515:620:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:the  frequency  of  domestic  M&As.  In  contrast,  the  volume  of  cross-border  M&As  has  
5:163:3408:21:20:85:514:599:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:started to increase at a rapid pace recently. Cross-border M&As represent an important 
5:164:3495:20:21:85:513:579:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:part of the globalisation of business in many different industries. They have spread from 
5:165:3585:21:21:85:510:558:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:the manufacturing to the service industries. Rossi and Volpin (2003) estimate that cross-
5:166:3674:21:21:85:516:537:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:border  M&As  cover  roughly  a  quarter  of  the  total  M&A  activity  nowadays.  This  
5:167:3764:21:20:85:515:516:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:evolution  has  inspired  a  lot  of  debate  in  European  countries.  In  general,  the  attitude  
5:168:3865:20:21:85:514:496:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:towards M&As has been rather positive, because they restructure the economy. Despite 
5:169:3950:21:21:85:515:475:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:this,  cross-border  M&As,  especially,  have  been  seen,  in  public  debate,  as  a  threat  to  
5:170:4050:21:32:85:154:454:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:employment.  
5:171:4063:32:21:85:515:422:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:Systematic  micro-level  evidence  on  the  causal  effect  of  different  types  of  M&As  on  
5:172:4159:21:21:85:517:401:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:employment  is  still  quite  sparse  despite  the  obvious  importance  of  the  topic.  For  
5:173:4254:21:20:85:517:380:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:instance,  economic  literature  on  multinational  companies  has  mostly  analysed  the  
5:174:4345:20:21:85:514:360:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:potential  effects  of  foreign  acquisitions  on  productivity  and  wages  (e.g.  Bellak,  2004).  
5:175:4446:21:21:85:514:339:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:This  paper  contributes  to  the  literature  by  analysing  the  employment  effects  of  M&As  
5:176:4544:21:21:85:514:318:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:on target firms by using matched establishment-level data from Finland over the period 
5:177:4631:21:20:85:515:297:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:1989-2003.  In  this  paper,  we  do  not  focus  solely  on  cross-border  or  domestic  M&As,  
5:178:4728:20:21:85:513:277:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:but we analyse the employment effects of several different types of M&As. We classify 
5:179:4814:21:21:85:516:256:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:M&As  as  being  either  a  cross-border  M&A  (in  which  the  purchaser  is  a  foreign  
5:180:4905:21:20:85:518:235:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:company   that   is   located   abroad),   a   domestic   M&A   with   a   domestically-owned   
5:181:5001:20:21:85:513:215:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:purchaser, a domestic M&A with a foreign-owned company that is located in Finland or 
5:182:5086:21:21:85:514:194:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:an  internal  restructuring  in  which  the  purchaser  is  not  another  company.  Most  of  the  
5:183:5185:21:20:85:514:173:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:earlier research studies have used relatively small samples of companies, making it hard 
5:184:5274:20:21:85:514:153:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:to  generalize  the  results  obtained.  The  use  of  comprehensive  data  on  several  different  
5:185:5374:21:33:85:480:132:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:types of M&As puts us in a somewhat better position to analyse the issue at hand. 
5:186:5456:33:21:85:515:99:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:The  Finnish  case  is  interesting  from  the  perspective  of  cross-border  M&As  and  the  
5:187:5551:21:0:85:515:78:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:domestic  M&As  with  foreign  ownership.  Since  Finland  is  a  small  open  country,  the  
6:188:5647:0:21:85:514:760:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:enlargement  of  foreign  ownership  can  have  a  more  profound  effect  on  employment  in  
6:189:5742:21:21:85:514:739:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:Finland  than  in  large  countries.  These  issues  have  been  a  subject  of  public  debate  in  
6:190:5843:21:21:85:515:718:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:Finland  recently  owing  to  the  fact  that  cross-border  M&As  have  greatly  increased  in  
6:191:5940:21:20:85:514:697:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:number  during  the  late  1990s,  following  the  lift  of  restrictions  over  foreign-ownership  
6:192:6040:20:21:85:513:677:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:during the early 1990s.1 Since foreign firms have settled down by establishing a Finnish 
6:193:6129:21:21:85:513:656:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:affiliate, they have typically continued to enlarge through domestic M&As, especially in 
6:194:6218:21:32:85:453:635:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:many service industries, like transport and various other business activities.  
6:195:6298:32:21:85:514:603:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:Our  paper  deviates  from  most  of  the  earlier  papers  in  this  strand  of  research  regarding  
6:196:6401:21:21:85:513:582:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:the data coverage, the definition of M&As and the methods that are used to analyse the 
6:197:6488:21:20:85:518:561:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:effect   of   M&As   on   employment.   Most   of   the   earlier   papers   have   focused   on   
6:198:6587:20:21:85:516:541:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:manufacturing,  mainly  owing  to  the  availability  of  data  sources.  This  is  important,  
6:199:6683:21:21:85:514:520:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:because the share of manufacturing has declined in almost all developed countries over 
6:200:6770:21:20:85:513:499:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:the past few decades. This applies to Finland. We use data that also includes services. In 
6:201:6861:20:21:85:516:479:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:particular,  the  dynamics  of  employment  may  be  different  between  these  industries,  
6:202:6954:21:21:85:513:458:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:because services are less capital-intensive than manufacturing. Hence, it is interesting to 
6:203:7046:21:21:85:513:437:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:analyse the effect of M&As on employment separately in the manufacturing sector and 
6:204:7130:21:20:85:514:416:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:in  the  service  sector.  It  may  well  be  that  conclusions  obtained  in  the  earlier  studies  of  
6:205:7236:20:21:85:513:396:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:this strand of research at least partly reflect partly their focus, which is primarily on the 
6:206:7330:21:33:85:196:375:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:manufacturing sector.  
6:207:7353:33:20:85:514:342:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:Regarding the definition of M&As, we use detailed information on the actual events of 
6:208:7439:20:21:85:514:322:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:different  types  of  M&As.2  For  example,  the  interference  of  foreign  firms  and  foreign  
6:209:7537:21:21:85:516:301:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:ownership  is  then  more  accurately  specified  than  in  the  studies  which  consider  a  
6:210:7631:21:20:85:521:280:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:registered    change    from    domestic    to    foreign    majority    ownership.    From    the    
6:211:7733:20:21:85:514:260:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:methodological  perspective,  most  of  the  earlier  papers  on  the  topic  (e.g.  Conyon  et  al.  
6:212:7835:21:21:85:513:239:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:2002b; Gugler and Yurtoglu, 2004) have relied solely on traditional parametric methods 
6:213:7922:21:21:85:515:218:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:to  identify  the  effect  of  M&As  on  employment.  In  contrast,  we  use  non-parametric,  
6:214:8017:21:20:85:515:197:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:matching  methods  to  pursue  the  issue  at  hand.  Our  data  enables  us  to  ensure  that  the  
6:215:8118:20:21:85:514:177:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:control group to whom the establishments – which have been targets of different types 
6:216:8204:21:49:85:515:156:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:of  M&As  –  are  compared  with  include  only  such  establishments  that  have  not  been  
6:217:8298:49:7:85:232:107:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:F:                                                           
6:218:8356:7:11:85:413:100:42:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:F:1 Lovio (2004) provides an overview of the globalisation of Finnish corporations. 
6:219:8438:11:16:85:502:89:42:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:F:2 Our data does not permit us to separate friendly and hostile takeovers from each other, which has been 
6:220:8543:16:0:85:316:73:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:F:possible in some other papers (e.g. Conyon et al. 2002b). 
7:221:8603:0:21:85:515:760:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:involved  in  any  kind  of  M&As.  This  allows  us  to  isolate  the  pure  effects  of  several  
7:222:8703:21:33:85:291:739:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:different types of M&As on employment.  
7:223:8743:33:21:85:513:706:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:In this paper, we discover that cross-border M&As lead to downsizing in manufacturing 
7:224:8829:21:20:85:514:685:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:employment. The effects of cross-border M&As on employment in non-manufacturing 
7:225:8909:20:21:85:514:665:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:are  much  weaker.  Domestic  M&As  with  a  domestic  purchaser,  instead,  have  negative  
7:226:9002:21:21:85:514:644:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:employment effects for all sectors. The impact of domestic M&As with foreign-owned 
7:227:9085:21:20:85:517:623:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:purchasers  is  remarkably  negative  in  construction  and  other  services.  In  addition,  
7:228:9179:20:21:85:514:603:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:internal  restructurings  have negative employment effects in trade (including hotels and 
7:229:9269:21:21:85:515:582:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:restaurants).  Taken  together,  our  most  important  empirical  finding  is  that  almost  all  
7:230:9367:21:20:85:516:561:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:changes  in  ownership  lead  to  employment  losses.  That  cross-border  M&As  had  a  
7:231:9456:20:21:85:514:541:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:negative  impact  only  in  manufacturing  and  that  domestic  M&As  with  foreign-owned  
7:232:9547:21:21:85:514:520:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:purchasers had, however, a substantial negative impact on employment in construction 
7:233:9632:21:20:85:515:499:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:and  other  services  may  emerge  from  the  situation  in  which  foreign  interference  in  
7:234:9727:20:21:85:510:479:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:service industries develops in two stages: first to establish a bridgehead through a cross-
7:235:9818:21:21:85:516:458:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:border  M&A  and,  after  this,  to  strengthen  the  dominance  of  the  market  through  
7:236:9909:21:21:85:513:437:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:domestic M&As. Apparently, the deep-going rationalisation of activities is typical only 
7:237:9997:21:20:85:514:416:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:of the latter stage, because deeper knowledge of the market has developed for a foreign 
7:238:10085:20:33:85:121:396:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:player. 
7:239:10093:33:21:85:515:363:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:The  paper  proceeds  as  follows.  Section  2  contains  a  survey  of  the  earlier  empirical  
7:240:10191:21:20:85:515:342:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:literature  that  has  analysed  the  effects  of  M&As  on  employment.  By  a  wide  margin,  
7:241:10287:20:21:85:515:322:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:most  of  the  available  empirical  evidence  originates  from  the  USA  or  the  UK.  Other  
7:242:10383:21:21:85:516:301:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:countries  are  not  well  covered.  Section  3  discusses  the  most  important  theoretical  
7:243:10478:21:20:85:517:280:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:arguments  regarding  the  effect  of  M&As  on  employment.  Section  4  contains  a

7:246:10763:21:21:85:516:218:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:M&As  on  employment.  Section  6  reports  our  estimation  results.  The  last  section

8:252:11091:21:21:85:514:682:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:(1995) and McGuckin and Nguyen (2000) discover some positive effects of M&As on 
8:253:11171:21:20:85:513:661:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:employment in the manufacturing sector, in particular, at the plant level in the USA. In 
8:254:11260:20:21:85:514:641:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:addition, Ollinger et al. (2005) report that there have not been negative effects of M&As 
8:255:11350:21:21:85:514:620:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:on employment in the food industry over the  period  1977-1987.  It  is important to note 
8:256:11440:21:20:85:515:599:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:that  part  of  the  evidence  is  based  on  very  restricted  samples  of  companies  covering  
8:257:11538:20:21:85:514:579:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:narrow  segments  of  the  US  economy.  For  instance,  Brown  and  Medoff  (1988)  obtain  
8:258:11631:21:21:85:515:558:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:their  estimates  on  the  effect  of  M&As  on  employment  from  a  sample  of  companies  
8:259:11724:21:21:85:514:537:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:located  in  the  state  of  Michigan  for  the  period  1978-1984.  This  may  be  the  reason  for  
8:260:11826:21:20:85:514:516:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:somewhat  mixed  results  on  the  employment  effects  of  M&As  that  have  emerged  from  
8:261:11919:20:33:85:136:496:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:the USA.  
8:262:11929:33:21:85:514:463:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:UK companies have been subjects of substantial takeover activity for long time. For that 
8:263:12018:21:20:85:513:442:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:reason, they represent an interesting opportunity to investigate the effects of M&As on 
8:264:12106:20:21:85:516:422:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:subsequent  employment.  Conyon  et  al.  (2000a,  2000b,  2000c)  report  the  negative  
8:265:12196:21:21:85:513:401:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:effects of M&As on employment in the UK by using data on 277 listed companies over 
8:266:12279:21:20:85:514:380:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:the period 1967-1996. Interestingly, the negative effects on employment are particularly 
8:267:12368:20:21:85:515:360:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:pronounced  for  related  and  hostile  transactions.  Girma  and  Görg  (2004)  discover  by  
8:268:12463:21:21:85:513:339:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:using data from the UK electronics industry for the period 1980-1993 that the incidence 
8:269:12551:21:21:85:515:318:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:of  foreign  takeover  reduces  the  employment  growth  of  a  domestic  establishment,  in  
8:270:12645:21:20:85:514:297:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:particular  for  unskilled  labour.  Hence,  cross-border  M&As  have  some  effects  on  the  
8:271:12740:20:33:85:287:277:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:determination of skill-mix in companies.  
8:272:12782:33:21:85:515:244:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:In  addition  to  evidence  that  stems  from  US  and  UK  studies,  there  is  some  empirical  
8:273:12880:21:20:85:515:223:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:evidence  from  other  European  countries.  For  instance,  Piscitello  and  Rabbiosi  (2002)  
8:274:12976:20:21:85:513:203:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:discover by using Italian firm-level data over the 1990s that, compared with firms that 
8:275:13064:21:21:85:515:182:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:were  not  subject  to  any  ownership  change,  companies  targeted  by  foreign  investors  
8:276:13158:21:20:85:515:161:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:marked  an  increase  in  both  labour  productivity  and  the  employment  level  a  few  years  
8:277:13256:20:21:85:513:141:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:after the acquisition. This result holds especially if the target firm is a small firm and if 
8:278:13350:21:0:85:333:120:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:the investor is a European multinational company.  
9:279:13403:0:21:85:515:760:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:For  Sweden,  which  is  a  small  open  economy  much  like  Finland,  Siegel  and  Simons  
9:280:13496:21:21:85:515:739:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:(2006)  report  by  using  linked  employer-employee  data  of  manufacturing  companies  
9:281:13586:21:21:85:514:718:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:over  the  period  1985-1998  that  M&As  lead  to  improvements  in  firm  performance  and  
9:282:13680:21:20:85:515:697:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:plant  productivity,  although  they  also  result  in  the  downsizing  of  establishments  and  
9:283:13778:20:21:85:514:677:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:firms  in  terms  of  employment.  However,  their  linked  employer-employee  data  do  not  
9:284:13872:21:21:85:517:656:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:include  cross-border  M&As  separately.  Hence,  they  are  not  able  to  compare  the

9:286:14051:20:21:85:513:615:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:M&As). In addition, they base their identification of M&As on changes in plant codes

9:290:14392:21:21:85:513:520:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:employment in Europe and the USA by using merger data for the USA that begin in the 
9:291:14476:21:20:85:513:499:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:late 1970s, for other countries in the mid-80s. They use dynamic GMM models in order 
9:292:14561:20:21:85:515:479:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:to  produce  results  and  they  provide  a  brief  comparison  of  the  employment  effects  of  
9:293:14659:21:21:85:513:458:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:cross-border and domestic M&As. Gugler and Yurtoglu (2004) do not find any adverse 
9:294:14742:21:21:85:514:437:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:effects of M&As on labour demand in the USA that have been reported in some of the 
9:295:14825:21:20:85:514:416:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:earlier  studies.  However,  there  is  the  prevalence  of  the  negative  effect  on  employment  
9:296:14925:20:21:85:516:396:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:in  Europe.  The  quantitative  magnitude  of  the  effect  of  M&As  on  employment  is  
9:297:15015:21:21:85:515:375:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:substantial  in  Europe,  because  Gugler  and  Yurtoglu  (2004)  document  that  European  
9:298:15107:21:20:85:514:354:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:mergers reduce the demand for labour by about 10% on average. Gugler  and  Yurtoglu

9:300:15295:21:33:85:472:313:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:reason companies are forced to use M&As in Europe as a restructuring device.   
9:301:15374:33:20:85:515:280:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:There  are  some  earlier  empirical  studies  on  the  effects  of  foreign  acquisitions,  using  
9:302:15474:20:21:85:513:260:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:Finnish data. All these papers have used linked employer-employee data covering solely 
9:303:15561:21:21:85:514:239:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:the manufacturing sector. In addition, the available  studies  consider  either  productivity  
9:304:15656:21:21:85:516:218:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:effects  (Ilmakunnas  and  Maliranta,  2004;  Maliranta,  2005)  or  wage  and  education

9:306:15837:20:21:85:513:177:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:educated workers of the total workforce declines, although slightly and slowly, after the 
9:307:15927:21:33:85:438:156:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:ownership has changed from domestic to foreign in the acquired plants.3

10:312:16257:0:35:85:338:758:195:g_d0_f12:195:g_d0_f12:C:3. THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
10:313:16287:35:20:85:516:723:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:To  recognize  the  motives  for  M&As  helps  us  to  understand  how  M&As  influence  
10:314:16376:20:33:85:468:703:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:employment. The most important motives of M&As (e.g. Mueller, 2003) are to 
10:315:16451:33:21:113:406:670:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:A:1) obtain genuine synergy gains (Farrell and Shapiro, 1990); 
10:316:16512:21:20:113:330:649:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:A:2) utilize scales economies in various forms; 
10:317:16558:20:21:113:319:629:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:A:3) strengthen the market power in pricing; 
10:318:16601:21:21:113:515:608:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:A:4)  revise  the  implicit  agreements  related  to  the  firm’s  personnel  and  other  stake  
10:319:16696:21:20:113:178:587:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:A:holders; and  
10:320:16710:20:33:113:357:567:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:A:5) promote the managers’ own deviating interests. 
10:321:16760:33:21:85:514:534:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:An  M&A  creates  synergy  gains  when  the  more  efficient  modes  of  actions  in  either  an  
10:322:16858:21:21:85:514:513:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:acquiring  or  in  an  acquired  firm  are  extended  to  comprise  the  whole  enlarged  firm.  In  
10:323:16959:21:20:85:514:492:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:horizontal M&As the marginal costs of production in an inefficient firm typically lower 
10:324:17047:20:21:85:513:472:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:to the level which prevails in the more efficient party of an M&A. In vertical M&As the 
10:325:17135:21:21:85:514:451:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:mechanism may be different. An M&A may then intensify incentives to exert effort in 
10:326:17219:21:20:85:513:430:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:various activities, for example, in the commercialization of innovations, as suggested by 
10:327:17309:20:21:85:513:410:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:the empirical findings of Lehto and Lehtoranta (2004) and Lehto (2006). It is clear that 
10:328:17398:21:21:85:514:389:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:synergy-promoting  M&As  primarily  increase  productivity.  These  types  of  M&As  may  
10:329:17488:21:20:85:513:368:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:also support employment of the acquiring and the target company. The reason is that by 
10:330:17575:20:21:85:516:348:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:raising  efficiency,  the  parties  of  M&As  become  more  competitive,  which  may  help  
10:331:17667:21:33:85:343:327:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:them to take over the market from their competitors.  
10:332:17721:33:21:85:513:294:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:It is not, however, evident that M&As, in general, only tend to internalize the benefits of 
10:333:17813:21:20:85:513:273:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:genuine synergy gains abstracted from the utilization of scale economics. It is plausible 
10:334:17903:20:21:85:514:253:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:that  the  parties  of  M&As  often  aim  to  jointly  use  the  assets  (including  human  capital)  
10:335:18005:21:21:85:514:232:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:which  the  new  parent  firm  possesses  after  the  merger.4  Sharing  assets  in  this  way  is  
10:336:18105:21:20:85:513:211:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:motivated by the cost savings obtained. The downsizing of overlapping activities in this 
10:337:18194:20:33:85:378:191:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:process almost always involves reductions of the workforce. 
10:338:18254:33:21:85:514:158:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:By  definition,  M&As  decrease  the  number  of  independent  players,  which  concentrates  
10:339:18348:21:20:85:513:137:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:the market. Salant et al. (1983), and Perry and Porter (1985) have shown that it does not 
10:340:18438:20:33:85:513:117:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:pay to purchase another firm in order to decrease competition and to gain pricing power 
10:341:18526:33:7:85:232:84:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:F:

11:344:18757:21:21:85:514:739:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:framework, the positive effect of decreasing the number of players on profits is, in any 
11:345:18846:21:21:85:519:718:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:case,   present   in   horizontal   M&As.   Therefore,   the   tendency   to   internalise   the   
11:346:18945:21:20:85:515:697:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:strengthened  market  power  by  higher  prices  will  be  part  of  horizontal  mergers  and  
11:347:19040:20:21:85:516:677:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:acquisitions,  and  one  can  expect  that,  for  this  part,  M&As  will  reduce  the  scale  of  
11:348:19139:21:33:85:249:656:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:production and labour input, too.  
11:349:19174:33:20:85:513:623:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:Shleifer and Summers (1987) have strongly argued that the change in control associated 
11:350:19261:20:21:85:515:603:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:with,  especially,  hostile  M&As  offers  an  opportunity  for  a  new  management  team  to  
11:351:19356:21:21:85:515:582:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:renege  on  implicit  and  explicit  labour  contracts  that  typically  constitute  obstacles  to  
11:352:19456:21:20:85:510:561:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:layoffs. In particular, implicit labour contracts are often used in order to encourage firm-
11:353:19548:20:21:85:516:541:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:specific  investments  (e.g.  Malcomson,  1997).  They  are  binding  actions  by  the  old  
11:354:19641:21:21:85:513:520:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:owners of the company and the old management team. However, the new management 
11:355:19720:21:20:85:513:499:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:team that is put in place after an M&A is able to renege on implicit labour contracts and 
11:356:19810:20:21:85:513:479:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:to reduce the number of the workforce. It is important to note that in Finland collective 
11:357:19900:21:21:85:514:458:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:labour agreements are also binding on all foreign owners. Hence, it is only possible to 
11:358:19988:21:33:85:261:437:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:renege on implicit labour contracts.  
11:359:20026:33:20:85:513:404:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:The idea that the managers of firms engage in “empire building” has long been regarded 
11:360:20113:20:21:85:513:384:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:as one possible explanation for M&As (Schumpeter, 1934; Marris, 1963). The managers 
11:361:20197:21:21:85:514:363:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:are  also  considered  to  deviate  from  the  owner’s  interests  when  they  use  “free  cash”  to  
11:362:20299:21:20:85:515:342:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:undertake  other  firms,  as  hypothised  by  Jensen  (1986).  If  these  motives  have  any  
11:363:20393:20:21:85:517:322:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:influence,  they  suggest  a  negative  influence  on  the  purchasing  firm’s  profits  but,  
11:364:20488:21:21:85:513:301:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:regarding the impact on the employment, the forecast is unclear. It is plausible that the 
11:365:20578:21:20:85:514:280:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:manager’s  behaviour  is  contingent  on  the  requirements  and  values  that  vary  in  time.  
11:366:20675:20:21:85:516:260:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:Nowadays,  when  the  managers’  success  is  increasingly  evaluated  through  various  
11:367:20764:21:33:85:492:239:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:efficiency measures, the tendency to become bigger has lost a lot of its endearment.  
11:368:20850:33:21:85:515:206:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:The  effect  of  M&As  on  employment  may  be  contingent  on  the  type  of  M&As.  The  
11:369:20941:21:20:85:515:185:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:factors  that  matter  are  distance  between  the  target  and  acquiring  firm  (domestic  or  
11:370:21038:20:33:85:193:165:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:foreign in our study);  
11:371:21062:33:21:113:226:132:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:A:i) the nationality of the

11:373:21138:20:0:113:513:91:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:A:iii) the institutional nature of an acquirer (another firm or another form of M&A).   
12:374:21226:0:21:85:515:760:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:Despite  the  fact  that  there  are  convincing  arguments  for  expecting  a  decline  in  the  
12:375:21324:21:21:85:514:739:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:amount  of  the  workforce  after  an  M&A,  it  is  important  to  recognize  that  the  effect  of  
12:376:21426:21:21:85:513:718:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:M&As on employment is not always necessarily negative. For instance, according to the 
12:377:21512:21:20:85:517:697:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:traditional  theory  of  multinational  companies  that  is  known  as  the  so-called  OLI  
12:378:21605:20:21:85:518:677:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:paradigm  (e.g.  Markusen,  2002),  a  multinational  company  brings  with  it  certain  
12:379:21695:21:21:85:514:656:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:intangible asset, which gives it a competitive edge over domestic firms.5 In this case a 
12:380:21784:21:20:85:515:635:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:multinational  company  and  a  cross-border  M&A  as  well  as  a  domestic  M&A  with  a  
12:381:21876:20:21:85:513:615:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:foreign-owned firm may well increase its workforce in the target country, taken that it is 
12:382:21967:21:21:85:514:594:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:able  to  increase  its  market  share  vis-à-vis  its  domestic  competitors.  This  scenario  may  
12:383:22068:21:20:85:514:573:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:occur in the service industries, where widely known brands, for instance, are important 
12:384:22156:20:33:85:242:553:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:for the success of the company.  
12:385:22189:33:21:85:513:520:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:Asymmetry of information is able to explain why an M&A’s impact is contingent on its 
12:386:22274:21:20:85:513:499:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:type. Previous research on the motives of M&As has discovered that information on the 
12:387:22360:20:21:85:515:479:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:target  firm  may  become  more  incomplete  when  the  distance  between  the  purchasing  
12:388:22452:21:21:85:515:458:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:firm  and  the  target  firm  increases  (Lehto,  2006).  The  asymmetric  information  then  
12:389:22546:21:21:85:514:437:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:explains  why  most  purchasers  are  located  fairly  close  to  targets.  If  remote  purchasers  
12:390:22646:21:20:85:513:416:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:are excluded, this phenomenon may not be relevant as regards the effects of M&As. But 
12:391:22732:20:21:85:513:396:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:if, after all, the nearby purchasers have, on average, more precise information about the 
12:392:22822:21:21:85:513:375:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:target firms and their market than distant purchasers, this may be relevant for the effects 
12:393:22914:21:20:85:514:354:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:of  M&As,  too.  It  is  illustrative  that  in  the  largest  and  in  the  deepest  going  M&As  in  
12:394:23017:20:21:85:517:334:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:Finland  the  purchaser  has  always  been  domestic.  This  especially  concerns  large  
12:395:23107:21:21:85:513:313:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:combination mergers in which several firms have merged into a single large firm so that 
12:396:23195:21:20:85:514:292:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:each  party  of  the  merger  is  (in  our  data)  considered  as  being  a  target  firm  in  turn.  It  
12:397:23301:20:21:85:515:272:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:looks  as  if  the  better  touch  of  the  local  markets  has  made  it  possible  for  profound  
12:398:23401:21:21:85:514:251:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:rationalisation.  From  this,  one  may  derive  a  hypothesis  that  radical  structural  reforms  
12:399:23501:21:21:85:514:230:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:with considerable negative effects on employment are rather characterized by domestic 
12:400:23587:21:32:85:425:209:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:M&As and, perhaps, internal restructurings than cross-border M&As.  
12:401:23655:32:21:85:515:177:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:On  the  other  hand,  one  can  argue  that  for  foreign  owners  it  may  be  easier  to  loosen  
12:402:23756:21:21:85:514:156:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:themselves  from  implicit  contracts  that  preserve  employment  in  order  to  maximize  the  
12:403:23853:21:20:85:513:135:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:short-run profits. For this, one may expect that cross-border M&As or domestic M&As 
12:404:23937:20:31:85:513:115:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:– in which the purchasing firm is foreign-owned – may cause a greater negative impact 
12:405:24023:31:7:85:232:84:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:F:

13:408:24251:21:21:85:513:739:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:evidence suggests that this is not a totally unlikely scenario, because foreign owners do 
13:409:24341:21:21:85:514:718:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:not  usually  have  respect  for  local  interests  regarding  employment  or  labour  standards  
13:410:24439:21:20:85:515:697:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:that  are  often  set  well  above  the  minimum  standards  that  have  been  agreed  upon  in  
13:411:24536:20:33:85:229:677:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:collective labour agreements. 
13:412:24566:33:21:85:514:644:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:To sum up, the theoretical discussion does not give a clear prediction about the effects 
13:413:24655:21:20:85:517:623:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:of  different  types  of  M&As  on  employment.  Hence,  the  net  effect  of  M&As  on  
13:414:24744:20:21:85:514:603:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:employment is an empirical matter. The negative effect seems, however, to be the most 
13:415:24830:21:21:85:514:582:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:likely. Indeed, most authors in this strand of research take the position that M&As cause 
13:416:24920:21:20:85:513:561:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:negative effects on employment over time (e.g. Conyon et al. 2002b). In addition, most 
13:417:25007:20:21:85:518:541:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:of   the   earlier   empirical   investigations   in   this   strand   of   research   have   reported   
13:418:25112:21:21:85:514:520:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:statistically  significant  negative  effects,  especially  for  European  countries  (e.g.  Gugler  
13:419:25213:21:32:85:189:499:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:and Yurtoglu, 2004). 
13:420:25234:32:21:85:516:467:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:We  explore  the  effect  of  M&As  on  employment  in  three  different  industry  blocks,  
13:421:25327:21:33:85:138:446:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:which are  
13:422:25338:33:21:113:340:413:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:A:a) manufacturing (including utility industries); 
13:423:25387:21:20:113:302:392:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:A:b) construction and other services; and 
13:424:25427:20:33:113:322:372:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:A:c) trade (including hotels and restaurants).  
13:425:25473:33:21:85:514:339:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:Manufacturing is largely global by nature, from which it follows that foreign firms are 
13:426:25561:21:20:85:517:318:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:equally  present  in  the  relevant  market  as  domestic  firms  are.  Owing  to  this,  in  
13:427:25655:20:21:85:515:298:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:manufacturing  the  opportunities  to  benefit  from  the  restriction  of  competition  can  be  
13:428:25753:21:21:85:514:277:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:considered  as  being  scarce  in  all  types  of  M&As.  In  the  service  industries  a  domestic  
13:429:25854:21:20:85:515:256:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:purchaser,  being  located  in  the  same  relevant  market  as  the  target  firm,  may  have  a  
13:430:25953:20:21:85:518:236:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:greater   interest   than   a   foreign   purchaser   to   buy   another   firm   in   order   to   limit   
13:431:26061:21:21:85:517:215:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:competition.  This  especially  concerns  trade.  Because  the  service  market  is  often  
13:432:26153:21:21:85:513:194:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:geographically restricted and because the joint use of assets may encounter geographical 
13:433:26242:21:20:85:515:173:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:limits,  as  suggested  by  the  findings  in  Lehto  (2006),  we  hypothise  that  in  the  service  
13:434:26344:20:21:85:513:153:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:sectors rationalisation through asset sharing and the related downsizing of employment 
13:435:26431:21:21:85:516:132:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:is  more  typical  of  domestic  M&As  (and  internal  restructuring)  than  of  cross-border

14:442:26888:34:20:85:514:637:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:Our data on M&As originates from the magazine Talouselämä, which is published on a 
14:443:26971:20:21:85:515:617:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:weekly  basis.  M&As  are  defined  based  on  an  ownership  share  of  at  least  50%.  The  
14:444:27066:21:21:85:515:596:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:magazine  reports  all  M&As  in  which  either  the  acquiring  or  the  acquired  firm  is  a

14:446:27252:20:21:85:516:555:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:company.  The  magazine  covers  all  sectors.  The  only  major  restriction  is  that  the  
14:447:27346:21:21:85:513:534:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:magazine Talouselämä does not keep a record of M&As in which either the acquirer’s

14:449:27527:21:20:85:513:492:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:addition, we have omitted from the analysis those firms that have been targets of M&As 
14:450:27614:20:21:85:515:472:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:two  (or  more)  times  within  a  single  year  in  order  to  avoid  conflating  the  effects  of

14:452:27809:21:20:85:516:430:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:however.  The  whole  analysis  is  done  at  the  establishment  level,  because  different  
14:453:27903:20:21:85:515:410:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:establishments  that  belong  to  the  same  firm  may  perform  differently.  In  addition,  in  
14:454:28001:21:21:85:515:389:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:some  cases  only  a  certain  establishment,  not  the  whole  firm,  is  purchased.  Hence,  we  
14:455:28100:21:20:85:517:368:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:have  linked  firms  that  have  been  subjects  of  M&As  according  to  the  magazine

14:457:28227:33:21:85:515:315:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:The  data  allows  us  to  separate  four  different  types  of  M&As.  These  are  cross-border

14:461:28606:21:21:85:515:232:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:located  firm  can  then  be  either  domestically-owned  or  foreign-owned.  Hence,  in  this  
14:462:28702:21:20:85:514:211:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:classification “foreign” has a dual meaning: firstly, it refers to the distance between the 
14:463:28794:20:21:85:514:191:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:acquirer  and  the  target  firm  and,  secondly,  it  specifies  the  nationality  of  an  acquirer’s  
14:464:28898:21:21:85:514:170:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:owners from the target firm’s viewpoint. We classify internal restructuring into its own 
14:465:28987:21:20:85:515:149:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:category,  because  we  think  that  this  type  of  M&A  may  differ  from  others,  because  
14:466:29082:20:21:85:515:129:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:restructuring  without  the  presence  of  another  firm  lacks  some  potential  for  synergy  
14:467:29178:21:33:85:505:108:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:gains but may favour closer knowledge of the target firm’s internal potential to renew.

16:539:32968:21:21:85:513:656:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:M&As cover around 10% of all M&As recorded in the magazine Talouselämä. This is a 
16:540:33050:21:20:85:518:635:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:rather   small   share.   The   number   of   establishments   that   were   targets   in   internal

16:546:33566:21:20:85:513:499:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:spike in the number of domestic M&As in the year 1993 stems from the restructuring of 
16:547:33652:20:21:85:513:479:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:the banking sector during the great depression of the early 1990s. Domestic M&As were 
16:548:33738:21:21:85:514:458:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:most widely spread in the Finnish Savings Banks Group. Interestingly, there has been a 
16:549:33825:21:21:85:514:437:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:substantial  increase  in  the  number  of  cross-border  M&As  during  the  latter  part  of  the

16:555:34359:21:21:85:513:313:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:the earlier papers have used data covering solely manufacturing. Domestic M&As have 
16:556:34443:21:20:85:512:292:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:been most common, by a wide margin, in finance and insurance, reflecting the structural

18:609:36263:21:21:85:513:656:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:manually link the firm codes to the names of the companies listed by the magazine. We 
18:610:36349:21:20:85:515:635:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:have  extensively  used  the  trade  register  maintained  by  the  National  Board  of  Patents

18:614:36734:20:21:85:515:553:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:necessary  to  identify  the  parties  of  M&A  on  the  establishment  level.  The  information

18:623:37589:21:20:85:514:366:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:information  (i.e.  the  plant  code)  on  the  employee’s  employer  in  the  last  week  of  each

18:630:38085:21:21:85:514:182:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:and  foremost,  the  selection  of  firms  for  targets  is  obviously  an  important  issue  in  the  
18:631:38188:21:20:85:514:161:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:context of M&As. Foreign companies tend to take over certain Finnish companies with 
18:632:38272:20:21:85:514:141:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:particular  observable  characteristics.  Hence,  the  fundamental  problem  is  that  it  is  not  
18:633:38372:21:21:85:516:120:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:possible  to  analyse  the  effect  of  M&As  on  employment  by  the  use  of  a  random  
18:634:38463:21:21:85:513:99:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:experiment in which there would be a lottery for being a target of M&A. As a result, it 
18:635:38551:21:0:85:514:78:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:is important to take into account the endogeneity of an M&A decision when analysing 
19:636:38638:0:21:85:516:760:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:the  causal  effect  of  M&As  on  employment.  From  the  theoretical  perspective,  it  is  
19:637:38732:21:21:85:514:739:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:possible  to  construct  a  hypothesis  that  older  and  larger  domestic  companies  are  more  
19:638:38830:21:21:85:514:718:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:likely to be acquired by a company that is not located in the same country as the target 
19:639:38919:21:20:85:515:697:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:company,  because  they  are  often  listed  in  stock  exchanges  and  there  is  more  public  
19:640:39016:20:21:85:515:677:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:information  available  about  them,  which  makes  a  cross-border  M&A  easier  and  less  
19:641:39109:21:21:85:515:656:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:risky.  The  earlier  empirical  results  on  Finnish  data  (Lehto,  2006)  show  that  foreign  
19:642:39207:21:20:85:513:635:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:companies tend to take over firms whose workers’ education level is high, whose size is 
19:643:39295:20:21:85:513:615:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:large and who have some contact, for example exports, to foreign countries. Second, in 
19:644:39382:21:21:85:516:594:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:addition  to  selection,  it  is  equally  important  to  recognise  that  the  adjustment  of  
19:645:39478:21:20:85:517:573:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:employment  is  not  immediate,  at  least  in  the  manufacturing  sector.  For  instance,  
19:646:39571:20:21:85:514:553:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:Siljander (2005) provides some Finnish evidence on the substantial adjustment costs of 
19:647:39658:21:21:85:514:532:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:employment  by  using  firm-level  data  from  500  largest  Finnish  companies  that  mostly  
19:648:39753:21:20:85:518:511:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:belong  to  manufacturing.  For  that  reason,  we  look  at  the  effects  of  M&As  on  
19:649:39843:20:21:85:515:491:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:employment  in  time  t  +  1  and  t  +  2.  The  baseline  for  the  employment  level  and  for  
19:650:39943:21:21:85:515:470:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:change  in  it  is  taken  from  t-1.  The  reason  for  this  is  that  by  analysing  the  effect  of  
19:651:40048:21:21:85:514:449:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:M&As  on  the  employment  level  in  time  t-1,  we  can  check  the  validity  of  matching,  
19:652:40144:21:20:85:518:428:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:because   M&As   that   occur   in   time   t   should   have   no   effect   whatsoever   on   the   
19:653:40246:20:21:85:514:408:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:employment  level  in  t-1.  Because  our  employment  variable  is  the  average  number  of  
19:654:40341:21:21:85:515:387:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:employees  in  the  establishment  during  the  year,  the  very  first  effects  on  employment  
19:655:40439:21:32:85:262:366:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:can, in principle, seen in the year t.   
19:656:40480:32:21:85:514:334:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:We  estimate  propensity  score  matching  models  when  studying  the  effect  of  M&As  on  
19:657:40574:21:21:85:516:313:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:employment.6  Propensity  score  matching  aims  to  mimic  a  random  experiment  by  
19:658:40661:21:20:85:513:292:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:constructing a control group from the group of untreated companies and to ensure that 
19:659:40747:20:21:85:516:272:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:the  control  group  is  as  similar  as  possible  to  the  treatment  group  with  respect  to  
19:660:40845:21:21:85:514:251:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:observable  characteristics.  In  our  case  the  treatment  is  a  situation  in  which  a  firm  has  
19:661:40949:21:21:85:514:230:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:been a target of a particular type of M&A. Matching has some distinct advantages over 
19:662:41035:21:20:85:517:209:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:regression-based  methods.  First,  matching  does  not  impose  any  specific  linearity  
19:663:41126:20:21:85:513:189:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:assumptions on the evaluated effects that are present in regression-based modelling that 
19:664:41215:21:21:85:514:168:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:is more commonly used in this field of research (e.g. Conyon et al. 2002b; Gugler and 
19:665:41301:21:20:85:514:147:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:Yurtoglu,  2004).  Second,  matching  explicitly  addresses  the  so-called  common  support  
19:666:41395:20:43:85:515:127:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:problem  that  finds  for  each  untreated  unit  a  similar  treated  unit.  This  is  needed  to

19:668:41553:7:0:85:357:77:42:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:F:6 Caliendo and Kopeinig (2005) provide a survey of these methods.

20:670:41721:21:33:85:228:739:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:group without the treatment.  
20:671:41751:33:21:85:514:706:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:To construct a control group for firms that have been targets of M&As over the period 
20:672:41837:21:20:85:514:685:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:1989-2003, we have included all domestic firms from the Business Register by SF that 
20:673:41922:20:21:85:514:665:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:have  a  turnover  of  at  least  FIM  3  million  (or  around  510  000  Euros).  This  is  the  very  
20:674:42026:21:21:85:514:644:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:same  limit  that  is  used  by  the  magazine  Talouselämä when  it  reports  M&As.  Because  
20:675:42121:21:20:85:513:623:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:we analyse the effects of M&As on employment in t+1 and t+2, we require that controls 
20:676:42207:20:21:85:515:603:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:also  have  to  exist  in  the  Business  Register  by  Statistics  Finland  in  t+1  and  t+2.  The  
20:677:42309:21:21:85:513:582:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:controls are always chosen from the set of firms who have not been a target in any kind 
20:678:42397:21:20:85:513:561:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:of M&A during time period t-1, ..., t+2. Our data allows us to make this exclusion as a 
20:679:42485:20:21:85:515:541:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:result  of  which  the  results  obtained  describe,  in  a  reliable  way,  the  pure  effect  of  the  
20:680:42590:21:21:85:513:520:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:particular type of M&A. For instance, we exclude those firms that have been subjects of 
20:681:42678:21:32:85:494:499:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:domestic M&As when analysing the effects of cross-border M&As on employment.  
20:682:42756:32:21:85:513:467:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:Matching that is used to analyse the effect of different types of M&As on employment 
20:683:42841:21:21:85:514:446:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:can  be  conducted  as  follows.  First,  Probit  models  for  being  a  subject  of  each  type  of  
20:684:42943:21:21:85:519:425:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:M&A   were   separately   estimated   in   order   to   construct   the   control   group.   The   
20:685:43042:21:20:85:514:404:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:establishment-level  explanatory  variables  for  the  probability  of  observing  each  type  of  
20:686:43141:20:21:85:514:384:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:M&A are shown in Table 1. (The results are not reported in order to save some space, 
20:687:43226:21:21:85:513:363:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:but  they  are  available  upon  request.)  These  prospensity  scores  give  predictions  for  the  
20:688:43327:21:20:85:513:342:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:likelihood of becoming a target of a particular type of M&A. Propensity scores are used 
20:689:43415:20:21:85:516:322:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:with  the  nearest-neighbour  matching  method  when  calculating  the  average  treatment  
20:690:43507:21:21:85:514:301:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:effect.  We  use  the  solely  linear  part  of  the  prediction  following  Diamond  and  Sekhon  
20:691:43606:21:20:85:514:280:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:(2005),  because  the  compression  of  the  probability  mass  around  the  value  of  zero  and  
20:692:43705:20:33:85:283:260:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:one could cause problems for matching.  
20:693:43745:33:21:85:513:227:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:Second, the employment level (or change in it) of those that have been a target of M&A 
20:694:43832:21:21:85:515:206:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:(i.e.  the  treatment  group)  was  compared  with  the  levels  of  those  firms  that  have  a  
20:695:43930:21:20:85:513:185:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:similar prospensity (based on the predictions of Probit models) to be in the pool of firms 
20:696:44021:20:21:85:514:165:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:taken over by other firm, but are not currently in the pool of those firms (i.e. the control 
20:697:44114:21:21:85:514:144:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:group). After some experiments, we end up using in our analysis the program developed 
20:698:44200:21:20:85:513:123:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:by Adadie et al. (2004) that was written for STATA in order to perform matching by the 
20:699:44287:20:21:85:519:103:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:nearest-neighbour   matching   method   and   to   calculate   the   corresponding   average

21:701:44483:0:21:85:513:760:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:unit can be matched to more than one untreated unit. After looking at the robustness of 
21:702:44571:21:33:85:440:739:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:the results, the number of controls was set to be five for each treated unit. 
21:703:44649:33:21:85:514:706:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:Hence,  the  effect  of  a  particular  type  of  M&A  on  employment  can  be  evaluated  based  
21:704:44747:21:20:85:513:685:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:on the average treatment effect. Let Yi(W) be the outcome variable Y of establishment i.

22:789:48552:33:21:85:514:165:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:We  start  by  summarizing  very  briefly  the  most  interesting  estimation  results  that  stem  
22:790:48652:21:20:85:514:144:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:from the Probit models in which the likelihood of each type of M&As is explained by

22:792:48838:21:19:85:513:103:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:they are available upon request.) The earlier results regarding these effects are reported

22:794:48987:7:0:85:265:77:42:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:F:7 Moulton (1990) has analysed this problem. 
23:795:49034:0:21:85:514:760:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:and  discussed  in  detail  in  Lehto  and  Lehtoranta  (2004)  and  Lehto  (2006).  The  models  
23:796:49132:21:21:85:513:739:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:include indicators for a firm’s legal form, industries, regions and years. The explanatory 
23:797:49223:21:21:85:514:718:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:variables are reported in Table 1 and their values are taken from t-1. Depending on the 
23:798:49311:21:20:85:515:697:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:particular  type  of  M&A  and  sector  that  we  are  analysing,  the  explanatory  variables  
23:799:49407:20:21:85:515:677:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:explain  from  10  to  40  per  cent  of  the  total  variation  (measured  by  pseudo  R2)  in  the  
23:800:49509:21:21:85:513:656:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:dependent variable. The results reveal that cross-border M&As are more likely to occur 
23:801:49596:21:20:85:513:635:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:for large establishments. This applies to all sectors. There is evidence that exporters are 
23:802:49688:20:21:85:513:615:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:more likely to be involved in cross-border M&As. This effect is weakest in construction 
23:803:49776:21:21:85:515:594:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:and  other  services.  In  general,  a  high  share  of  highly  educated  employees  seems  to  
23:804:49873:21:20:85:514:573:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:stimulate  the  likelihood  of  cross-border  M&As.  Hence,  foreign  acquirers  often  target  
23:805:49969:20:21:85:517:553:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:Finnish  firms  with  a  lot  of  accumulated  knowledge  embodied  in  human  capital.  
23:806:50058:21:21:85:514:532:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:Interestingly,  a  share  of  highly  educated  employees  with  technical  qualifications  does  
23:807:50156:21:20:85:515:511:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:not  have  an  effect  on  the  likelihood  of  cross-border  M&As  in  construction  and  other  
23:808:50254:20:33:85:133:491:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:services.  
23:809:50265:33:21:85:513:458:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:The results for domestic M&As (both types) reveal that a firm’s age is positively related 
23:810:50355:21:21:85:514:437:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:to the likelihood of a domestic takeover. The reason for this is most likely that the age 
23:811:50445:21:20:85:515:416:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:of  a  target  firm  is  closely  related  to  the  available  information  for  potential  acquirers.  
23:812:50549:20:21:85:514:396:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:Older firms are often listed and there is more public information available about them. 
23:813:50637:21:21:85:515:375:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:The  education  structure  plays  a  much  smaller  role  in  the  determination  of  domestic  
23:814:50733:21:20:85:514:354:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:M&As  (both  types)  compared  with  cross-border  M&As.  As  expected,  an  increase  in  a  
23:815:50827:20:21:85:517:334:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:firm’s  age  and  an  increase  in  the  number  of  establishments  tend  to  stimulate  the  
23:816:50922:21:21:85:514:313:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:likelihood of its internal restructuring. In addition, exporters are more likely to conduct 
23:817:51014:21:20:85:514:292:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:internal  restructurings.  The  most  likely  reason  for  this  is  that  exporters  may  face  more  
23:818:51117:20:21:85:513:272:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:competition that makes them more inclined to conduct internal restructurings, which are 
23:819:51205:21:33:85:255:251:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:often done in order to cut costs.      
23:820:51244:33:21:85:515:218:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:The  results  that  emerge  from  the  matching  models  on  the  effect  of  different  types  of

23:822:51435:20:21:85:516:177:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:treatment  effects,  in  levels  and  in  changes  (based  on  the  difference-in-differences  
23:823:51530:21:21:85:514:156:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:estimator),  respectively.  The  number  of  different  types  of  M&As  is  somewhat  smaller  
23:824:51626:21:20:85:514:135:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:with the use of matching models than in Figs. 1-2, because explaining the employment

23:826:51801:21:21:85:513:94:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:and a surge of cross-border M&As occurred towards the end of our observation period. 
23:827:51886:21:0:85:513:73:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:In addition, the number of M&As is reduced with the use of matching models owing to 
24:828:51973:0:21:85:515:760:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:non-availability  of  the  control  variables  for  some  establishments  from  the  registers  of  
24:829:52073:21:21:85:514:739:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:SF.  As  expected,  M&As  that  occur  in  time  t  have  generally  no  statistically  significant  
24:830:52174:21:21:85:515:718:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:effect  on  employment  level  in  t-1.  This  pattern  emerges  in  all  types  of  M&As  in  all  
24:831:52274:21:20:85:514:697:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:sectors  (except  from  the  model  reported  in  column  2  in  Table  3  and  from  the  one  in

24:833:52461:21:21:85:516:656:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:to  keep  in  mind  that  even  when  M&As  that  occur  in  time  t  have  a  statistically

29:1035:69904:34:21:85:514:279:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:This paper contributes to the literature by analysing the employment effects of different 
29:1036:69994:21:21:85:513:258:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:types of M&As on target firms by using matched establishment-level data from Finland 
29:1037:70079:21:20:85:513:237:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:over the period of 1989-2003. In this paper, we do not focus solely on cross-border or 
29:1038:70166:20:21:85:515:217:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:domestic  M&As,  but  we  analyse  the  employment  effects  of  several  different  types  of  
29:1039:70262:21:21:85:513:196:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:M&As. We classify M&As being either a cross-border M&A (in which the purchaser is 
29:1040:70344:21:20:85:513:175:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:a foreign company that is located abroad), a domestic M&A with a domestically-owned 
29:1041:70428:20:21:85:513:155:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:purchaser, a domestic M&A with a foreign-owned company that is located in Finland or 
29:1042:70513:21:21:85:513:134:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:an internal restructuring in which the purchaser is not another company. Hence, in this 
29:1043:70601:21:21:85:514:113:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:classification “foreign” has a dual meaning: firstly, it refers to the distance between the 
29:1044:70693:21:0:85:514:92:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:acquirer  and  the  target  firm  and,  secondly,  it  specifies  the  nationality  of  an  acquirer’s  
30:1045:70800:0:21:85:514:760:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:owners from the target firm’s viewpoint. Our data on M&As covers all sectors. Most of 
30:1046:70886:21:33:85:373:739:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:the earlier literature has focused on manufacturing, instead. 
30:1047:70948:33:21:85:520:706:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:We   discover   that   cross-border   M&As   lead   to   downsizing   in   manufacturing   
30:1048:71039:21:20:85:514:685:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:employment. The effects of cross-border M&As on employment in non-manufacturing 
30:1049:71119:20:21:85:514:665:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:are much weaker. Domestic M&As with a domestic purchaser, on the other hand, have 
30:1050:71201:21:21:85:510:644:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:negative employment effects for all sectors. The effect of domestic M&As with foreign-
30:1051:71287:21:20:85:516:623:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:owned  purchasers  on  employment  is  remarkably  negative  in  construction  and  other  
30:1052:71378:20:21:85:514:603:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:services. Internal restructurings that do not involve another company also tend to cause 
30:1053:71467:21:21:85:514:582:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:employment losses. Taken together, our most important empirical finding is that almost 
30:1054:71554:21:20:85:515:561:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:all  changes  in  ownership  lead  to  employment  losses.  That  cross-border  M&As  had  a  
30:1055:71648:20:21:85:514:541:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:negative  impact  only  in  manufacturing  and  that  domestic  M&As  with  foreign-owned  
30:1056:71739:21:21:85:514:520:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:purchasers had, however, a substantial negative impact on employment in construction 
30:1057:71824:21:20:85:515:499:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:and  other  services  may  emerge  from  the  situation  in  which  foreign  interference  in  
30:1058:71919:20:21:85:510:479:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:service industries develops in two stages: first to establish a bridgehead through a cross-
30:1059:72010:21:21:85:513:458:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:border M&A, and after this to strengthen the dominance of the market through domestic 
30:1060:72096:21:21:85:515:437:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:M&As.  Apparently  the  deep-going  rationalisation  of  activities  is  typical  only  of  the  
30:1061:72193:21:32:85:512:416:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:latter stage, because deeper knowledge of the market has developed for a foreign player. 
30:1062:72282:32:21:85:514:384:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:  Our  reading  of  the  evidence  is  that  the  focus  of  the  earlier  empirical  studies  primarily  
30:1063:72388:21:21:85:515:363:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:on  manufacturing  (and  listed  companies)  when  analysing  the  employment  effects  of  
30:1064:72480:21:20:85:513:342:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:M&As can deliver a seriously distorted picture about the adjustment of employment that 
30:1065:72567:20:21:85:516:322:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:takes  place  in  broader  industries.  In  particular,  the  negative  effects  of  cross-border  
30:1066:72666:21:21:85:514:301:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:M&As  on  employment  are  almost  non-existent  in  non-manufacturing.  In  addition,  the  
30:1067:72759:21:20:85:514:280:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:negative  effects  of  M&As  on  employment  do  not  arise  exclusively  from  cross-border  
30:1068:72853:20:21:85:513:260:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:M&As. Hence, the evidence points out that cross-border M&As seem to be less specific 
30:1069:72938:21:21:85:514:239:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:regarding  their  effects  on  employment  than  has  previously  been  thought.  A  prominent  
30:1070:73034:21:21:85:514:218:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:explanation  for  employment  losses  is  that  the  change  in  control  through  M&As  offers  
30:1071:73131:21:20:85:514:197:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:an  opportunity  for  new  management  team  to  renege  on  implicit  labour  contracts  that  
30:1072:73227:20:21:85:513:177:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:have constituted obstacles for layoffs (Shleifer and Summers, 1988). Our results call for 
30:1073:73317:21:21:85:515:156:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f11:B:more  empirical  studies  that  incorporate  information  from  non-manufacturing  sectors
