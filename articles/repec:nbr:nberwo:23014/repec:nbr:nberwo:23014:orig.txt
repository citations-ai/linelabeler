2:30:1621:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:Central  banks  affect  the  resources  available  to  fiscal  authorities  through  the  impact  of  their 
2:31:1729:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:policies on  the  public  debt,  as  well  as  through  their  income,  their  mix  of  assets,  their  liabilities, 
2:32:1845:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:and their own solvency. This paper inspects the ability of the central bank to alleviate the fiscal 
2:33:1944:14:14:71:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:burden  by  influencing different  terms  in  the  government  resource  constraint.  It  discusses  five 
2:34:2049:14:14:71:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:channels:  (i)  how  inflation  can (and  cannot)  lower  the  real  burden  of  the  public  debt,  (ii)  how 
2:35:2159:14:14:71:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:seignorage  is  generated  and  subject to  what  constraints,  (iii)  whether  central  bank  liabilities 
2:36:2265:14:14:71:546:504:12:Times:12:Times:should count as public debt, (iv) how central bank assets create income risk, and whether or not 
2:37:2361:14:14:71:545:490:12:Times:12:Times:this  threatens  its  solvency,  and  (v)  how  the  central bank  balance  sheet  can  be  used  for  fiscal 
2:38:2470:14:14:72:546:476:12:Times:12:Times:redistributions. Overall, it concludes that the scope for the central bank to lower the fiscal burden 
2:39:2571:14:42:72:120:462:12:Times:12:Times:is limited.

3:48:2712:0:30:72:208:708:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:1    Introduction
3:49:2729:30:18:72:540:678:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Crises spur the imagination of academics.  The U.S. financial crisis followed by the Eurocrisis
3:50:2824:18:18:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:have led to original proposals on how fiscal stimulus can be delivered, how safe assets can be
3:51:2918:18:18:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:created in a monetary union without joint liabilities, and how macro prudential regulation
3:52:3008:18:18:72:540:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:can overcome problems in the financial sector, among many others.  At the same time, the
3:53:3096:18:18:72:540:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:balance sheets of the four major central banks (ECB, Federal Reserve, Bank of England and
3:54:3185:18:18:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Bank of Japan) look quite different than they did just 10 years ago.  As figure 1 shows, these
3:55:3279:18:18:72:540:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:central  banks  have  increased  the  size  of  their  balance  sheets  through  direct  purchases  of
3:56:3381:18:18:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:government securities (ECB), issued liabilities in the form of bank reserves that pay market
3:57:3473:18:18:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:interest rates (Federal Reserve), raised the maturity of bond holdings through special purpose
3:58:3567:18:17:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:vehicles (Bank of England), and bought large amounts of private securities (Bank of Japan).
3:59:3658:17:18:72:540:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:It is therefore not a surprise that some of the most daring ideas coming from research on
3:60:3747:18:18:72:381:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:macroeconomic policy involve the central bank in some way.
3:61:3805:18:18:89:539:463:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Common  to  many  discussions  surrounding  the  central  bank  is  its  supposed  ability  to
3:62:3899:18:18:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:alleviate the fiscal burden faced by a country.  On both sides of the Atlantic,  public debt
3:63:3991:18:18:72:540:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is at its highest level since World War II; on the right side, fiscal crises in Greece, Ireland
3:64:4086:18:18:72:540:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and Portugal have already left their marks.  With its mystical ability to print money and
3:65:4175:18:18:72:540:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:its frequent purchases of government bonds, it is tempting to look at the central bank as a
3:66:4266:18:18:72:215:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:source of solace and respite.
3:67:4295:18:18:89:539:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This  perception  of  the  central  bank  as  a  relevant  fiscal  agent  takes  many  forms  and
3:68:4392:18:18:72:540:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:common  statements.   Some  say  that  a  country  with  its  own  central  bank  can  never  have
3:69:4490:18:18:72:540:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a  sovereign  debt  crisis  because  it  can  print  money  to  pay  any  bills.   Others  argue  that  if
3:70:4596:18:18:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a country raised its inflation target, it could wipe out the real value of its public debt and
3:71:4690:18:18:72:540:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:alleviate its fiscal burden.  Others still make the point that central banks can never go legally
3:72:4787:18:17:72:540:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:insolvent, so when fiscal authorities are on the verge of sovereign insolvency, it is time for
3:73:4881:17:18:72:540:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the central bank to step up.  Finally, in the context of the Eurosystem, some proposed that
3:74:4972:18:18:72:540:230:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the ECB could buy and then forgive the debt of the periphery countries, becoming a vehicle
3:75:5062:18:18:72:303:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for fiscal transfers within the currency union.
3:76:5109:18:18:89:539:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Each  of  these  suggestions  involves  the  central  bank  as  a  fiscal  actor.   Of  course,  any
3:77:5209:18:18:72:540:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:student of monetary economics understands that it is the interaction of monetary and fiscal
3:78:5300:18:18:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:policy that determines equilibrium outcomes for inflation or real activity.  There is a vast
3:79:5392:18:18:72:540:140:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:literature discussing the fiscal implications of central bank actions, and the required coordi-
3:80:5487:18:18:72:540:122:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nation between monetary and fiscal authorities.  However, all the suggestions in the previous
3:81:5580:18:0:72:540:104:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:paragraph were more specific than this general interaction.  They involved the central bank

4:173:6860:47:18:72:540:341:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:creating  real  resources,  and  somehow  transferring  them  to  some  other  authorities.   They
4:174:6958:18:18:72:540:323:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:involved the central bank using its balance sheet to have a direct effect on the balance sheet
4:175:7052:18:17:72:185:305:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the fiscal authority.
4:176:7076:17:18:89:539:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:While a survey of central banks one decade ago could barely mention these fiscal roles
4:177:7162:18:18:72:540:270:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for the central bank (Blinder, 2004), they play a central role in more recent surveys (Reis,
4:178:7254:18:18:72:540:252:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2013) and yet still leave much to be discussed.  This is the topic of this paper.  The closest
4:179:7348:18:18:72:540:234:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:papers to it in motivation are Stella & Lonnberg (2008) and Archer & Moser-Boehm (2013),
4:180:7436:18:18:72:540:216:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:but the approach and goal here are quite different.  This paper works through the resource
4:181:7526:18:18:72:540:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:constraint facing the central bank with the goal of understanding whether the central bank
4:182:7616:18:18:72:540:180:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:can generate fiscal revenues, and in doing so relax (or tighten) the resource constraint facing
4:183:7711:18:18:72:179:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the fiscal authorities.
4:184:7734:18:18:89:539:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In spite of this narrow focus, there is still significant ground to cover. Section 2 starts with
4:185:7830:18:18:72:540:126:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the fiscal intertemporal resource constraint so that we can precisely define what is the fiscal
4:186:7925:18:36:72:540:108:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:burden.  This section catalogues five different possible channels through which a central bank
4:187:8019:36:0:303:309:72:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2
5:188:8020:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:could feasibly lower this burden.  They are each analyzed in turn the succeeding sections.  I
5:189:8113:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:also provide a minimal definition of a central bank, setting the basics for each succeeding
5:190:8204:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:section  to  progressively  expand  the  actions  taken  by  the  central  bank,  and  consider  new
5:191:8304:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:channels for real transfers to the fiscal authorities.  Throughout, these are spelled out using
5:192:8399:18:18:72:177:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:resource constraints.
5:193:8420:18:18:89:539:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Section 3 starts by considering the central bank’s ability to take deposits and make loans
5:194:8510:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to banks.  This gives it control over nominal interest rates and inflation, and also gives rise
5:195:8605:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to the first channel through which it can lower the fiscal burden:  inflating away the debt.
5:196:8697:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:While the idea is simple, this section discusses the difficulties with estimating the size of this
5:197:8795:18:18:72:507:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:channel, with implementing it effectively, and with making it quantitatively relevant.
5:198:8881:18:18:89:539:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Section 4 considers the central bank’s provision of liquidity services to the economy, for
5:199:8971:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:which  it  collects  a  payment  commonly  known  as  seignorage.   This  source  of  relaxation  of
5:200:9071:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fiscal burdens is common during hyperinflations.  When inflation is below two digits though,
5:201:9163:18:17:72:516:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the associated revenues are relatively small, and they are not too sensitive to inflation.
5:202:9253:17:18:89:539:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Next, I introduce voluntary interest-paying reserves that banks can hold at the central
5:203:9340:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bank.  These central bank liabilities are quite special assets in the economy, and they play
5:204:9432:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a  central  role  in  the  remainder  of  this  paper.   Section  5  starts  by  describing  the  unique
5:205:9536:18:18:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:properties of reserves and by answering one question:  should these central bank liabilities
5:206:9628:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:be counted as part of the public debt?  Taking the other side, this section studies to what
5:207:9719:18:18:72:499:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:extent issuing reserves provides a third channel for the alleviation of fiscal burdens.
5:208:9806:18:18:89:539:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Reserves lead to a definition of the meaning of central bank insolvency, together with its
5:209:9896:18:18:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tight link to central bank independence.  They point to the fourth channel that this paper
5:210:9986:18:18:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:studies:  the  sources  of  income  risk  facing  the  central  bank  and  the  possibility  that  these
5:211:10090:18:18:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lead to either sources of revenue to the government or further fiscal burdens in the form of
5:212:10182:18:18:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:central bank insolvency. Sections 6 to 9 study four sources of income risk, and four associated
5:213:10277:18:18:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dangers to solvency.  Section 6 focuses on the risk from holding foreign currency.  This leads
5:214:10371:18:17:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to a discussion of the role of central bank income and net worth, and clarifies why across
5:215:10461:17:18:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the world there are special rules involving central bank holdings of foreign reserves.  Section
5:216:10556:18:18:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:7 considers purchases of short-term private bonds by the central bank and their associated
5:217:10646:18:18:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:default risk.  The rules that determine the central bank’s dividend to the fiscal authorities
5:218:10739:18:18:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and  the  ability  to  provision  play  a  key  role  in  determining  whether  the  fiscal  authorities
5:219:10843:18:18:72:540:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:must support (or not) the central bank.  Sections 8 and 9 turn to government bonds.  First,
5:220:10934:18:18:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:I focus on sovereign default and on the transfers between different economic agents that it
5:221:11025:18:0:72:540:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:entails.  Second, I discuss quantitative easing:  the purchase of long-term government bonds
6:222:11118:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in exchange for bank reserves.  I show that QE does not lead on average to fiscal transfers,
6:223:11210:18:18:72:528:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:but it can put to the test the fiscal capacity of the central bank because of duration risk.
6:224:11302:18:18:89:539:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In section 10, the analysis switches from the resources that the central bank can distribute
6:225:11394:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to the redistributions across fiscal entities that it can trigger.  Within a currency union, the
6:226:11490:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:central bank can be used to relax the fiscal constraints of some regions, while increasing the
6:227:11584:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fiscal burden of others.  This is the fifth and final channel considered in this paper.  Using
6:228:11678:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the Eurosystem as an example, I describe the many vehicles that could be used to undertake
6:229:11768:18:18:72:455:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:these redistributions, and how the Eurosystem’s institutions prevent them.
6:230:11842:18:18:89:539:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Finally, section 11 concludes by revisiting some commonly heard statements about what
6:231:11927:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:central banks can achieve fiscally.  I show that, while they are partly correct, they are mostly
6:232:12023:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:misleading.  This provides a final application of why the lessons in this paper can be useful
6:233:12116:18:45:72:230:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in economic policy discussions.
6:234:12147:45:30:72:432:465:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:2    The fiscal burden and the central bank
6:235:12190:30:18:72:540:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In discussing fiscal resources and central banks, it is important to stay away from two common
6:236:12284:18:17:72:115:417:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fallacies.
6:237:12294:17:18:89:539:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The  first  is  money  illusion.   Printing  banknotes  may  generate  nominal  resources,  but
6:238:12389:18:18:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:because this invariably comes with higher inflation, it creates fewer real resources.  People
6:239:12482:18:18:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are only willing to lend to the government expecting a real return, and almost all government
6:240:12575:18:18:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:spending programs require providing or paying for real services or goods.  Fiscal burdens are
6:241:12668:18:18:72:540:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:real, and it is an illusion to think that “printing money” makes them magically disappear.
6:242:12758:18:18:72:540:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To safeguard against this illusion, I will write constraints in real terms; whenever a variable
6:243:12853:18:18:72:437:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is in nominal units, it will be written using capitals, to make this clear.
6:244:12928:18:18:89:539:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The second fallacy is the free lunch. If central banks could magically create something out
6:245:13019:18:18:72:540:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of nothing without bounds, then the whole of society could use monetary policy to solve any
6:246:13110:18:18:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:scarcity problem.  Free lunches don’t usually exist, at least not at the wide macroeconomic
6:247:13201:18:18:72:540:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:scale  where  there  are  finite  resources.   Even  if  central  banks  and  monetary  policy  work
6:248:13301:18:18:72:540:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:towards raising welfare, it is dangerous and almost always wrong to believe that they can
6:249:13390:18:18:72:540:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:create real resources out of nothing.  When one identifies what seems like a free lunch,  it
6:250:13482:18:17:72:540:166:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is crucial to make sure that all resource constraints have been spelled out.  I will do so by
6:251:13575:17:18:72:356:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:insisting on looking at resource constraints throughout.
6:252:13631:18:18:89:539:131:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:At the same time, the analysis will be very general by discussing what central banks can
6:253:13719:18:0:72:540:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:do given those constraints, rather than what they ought to do.  There will be many lessons
7:254:13810:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:even though the objectives of the central bank, or its actual choices, are never stated.  The
7:255:13903:18:39:72:516:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:goal is to figure out what is possible, leaving for later a discussion of what is desirable.

7:257:14032:26:18:72:540:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Time is discrete, and we will take the perspective of an arbitrary datet.  The fiscal burden
7:258:14124:18:39:72:502:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the government is equal to the commitments that it has to honor to its creditors:

7:275:14833:18:18:89:539:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The reason why this is a burden is that people would not be willing to lend to a govern-

7:277:15010:18:39:72:517:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and this constraint can be written as a resource constraint facing the fiscal authorities:

7:288:15370:18:18:72:540:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:they could well be negative. In that case the fiscal authority might be said to be recapitalizing
7:289:15467:18:18:72:159:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the central bank.
7:290:15484:18:18:89:540:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Moving on toft, these are the fiscal surpluses, or the difference between spending and
7:291:15570:18:18:72:540:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:revenues.   One  might  argue  that  some  forms  of  committed  spending,  like  social  security
7:292:15668:18:18:72:540:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:payments, should be moved to the left so they are included in the fiscal burden.  This could
7:293:15760:18:18:72:540:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:make a significant difference for quantitative assessments, but it is hard to gauge how easy
7:294:15852:18:18:72:540:131:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:it is to revert those commitments, and what fraction of them is nominal versus real.  I will

8:300:16305:18:18:71:539:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is  hard  to  escape  the  free-lunch  fallacy:  why  wouldn’t  the  government  exploit  them  with

8:303:16596:18:18:71:539:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:individual securities that investors can exploit.  The assumption here is instead that in the
8:304:16689:18:18:71:539:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:large and liquid market for government liabilities of different maturities, there are no such

8:307:16878:18:39:89:502:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Mathematically, this translates into assuming that the following condition holds:

8:314:16989:39:18:72:540:450:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:so that the expectation of the product of the stochastic discount factor with the return on
8:315:17080:18:18:72:540:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:any government security is always equal to one.  It is important to note, because it is often
8:316:17173:18:18:72:540:414:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:forgotten, that the price of government bonds is driven both by default and future inflation.
8:317:17266:18:18:72:539:396:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:If the bond is expected to default and pay little (smallδt+j), or if inflation is expected to be
8:318:17362:18:18:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:high until the bond comes due (highpt+j/pt), both of these depress the price of the bond in
8:319:17453:18:17:72:540:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the same way or, equivalently, raise the yields on the public debt.  From the perspective of
8:320:17545:17:18:72:540:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the bondholder, whether the country uses inflation to prevent default, or is stuck with low
8:321:17636:18:18:72:354:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:inflation and is forced to default, the payoff is reduced.
8:322:17694:18:39:89:502:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Using this condition, we can write the fiscal burden in an alternative useful way:

8:336:18000:26:18:71:539:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Central  banks  have  a  long  and  rich  history  and  they  perform  many  functions  in  modern
8:337:18098:18:18:71:539:126:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:advanced  economies  (Reis,  2013).   Each  section  of  this  paper  will  gradually  expand  the
8:338:18196:18:36:71:539:108:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:policies controlled by the central bank so that, by the end, we end up with a satisfactory
8:339:18286:36:0:303:309:72:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:6
9:340:18287:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:model caricature of its real-life counterpart.  To start, consider the minimal version of what
9:341:18381:18:18:72:161:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is a central bank.
9:342:18399:18:18:89:539:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:All central banks in advanced countries perform a crucial task,  and some (the Federal
9:343:18485:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Reserve) were created from the start to satisfy this function.  Banks issue checks and debit
9:344:18577:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cards that are used to make payments by their customers to other banks’ customers.  This is
9:345:18668:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:only possible because periodically (say at the end of the day) the banks that end up as net
9:346:18759:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:creditors can settle their claims on the other banks that end up as net debtors.  Making these
9:347:18853:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:settlements requires a clearing house that the banks can join,  and some form of payment
9:348:18941:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:within the clearing house,  in the sense of a claim on the house itself that can be used to
9:349:19032:18:18:72:539:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:settle the interbank claims.  In the 19thcentury United States, many private clearing houses
9:350:19124:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tried  to  perform  this  role,  but  most  failed  because  of  the  double  moral  hazard  problem
9:351:19224:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that each bank wants to accumulate a large debt to the house and then default,  and the
9:352:19311:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:house managers want to secretly issue the house’s means of payment to enrich themselves.
9:353:19399:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The central bank is a public institution that has a strong and restrictive legal framework
9:354:19489:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:governing its operations, and broad powers to regulate, supervise and close down the banks
9:355:19579:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that take deposits and issue these means of payments, and this allows the central bank to
9:356:19668:18:18:72:421:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ensure that banks almost always satisfy their claims to other banks.
9:357:19736:18:18:89:539:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A central bank can then be defined as the sole institution in a country with the power
9:358:19822:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to issue an interbank claim, called bank reserves at the central bank, that is used to settle
9:359:19915:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:interbank claims.  Since the central bank is the monopoly issuer of these reserves, it can freely
9:360:20012:18:18:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:choose which interest to pay on these reserves.  Insofar as the balances on these reserves are
9:361:20106:18:18:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:zero,  then this comes with no fiscal transfer on  aggregate from the  banking sector to the
9:362:20198:18:18:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:government sector.  But,  the central bank is special among government agencies by being
9:363:20286:18:18:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:able to issue this type of nominal government liability, independently of the fiscal authority.
9:364:20381:18:18:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Moreover, this liability is quite special because it is the unit of account in the economy:  its
9:365:20477:18:18:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:units define what the price levelptis.  From another perspective, the central bank can pay
9:366:20567:18:17:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the interest on reserves with more reserves,  and this fully satisfies its commitment to the
9:367:20659:17:18:72:454:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:banks, since reserves are the unit for nominal transactions in the economy.

10:390:21153:41:18:72:540:584:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:At this very general level, we can see the five channels through which the central bank can
10:391:21244:18:18:72:192:566:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:affect the fiscal burden.
10:392:21269:18:18:89:539:548:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:First, the central bank can affect the real value of reserves, and in doing so exert significant
10:393:21365:18:18:72:540:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:control  over  the  price  levelpt+j.   For  a  fixed  level  of  nominal  commitments  by  the  fiscal
10:394:21468:18:17:72:540:512:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:authority, higher prices lower the real burden of honoring those commitment.  In short, the
10:395:21559:17:18:72:496:495:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:central bank can try to inflate away the debt.  Section 3 is devoted to this channel.
10:396:21644:18:18:89:540:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Second,  the  central  bank  makes  real  transfers  to  the  governmentdt+j.   Every  savings
10:397:21738:18:18:72:540:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that the central bank achieves in its operations is an extra source of revenue to the fiscal
10:398:21830:18:18:72:540:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:authority.   More  importantly,  if  in  its  activities  the  central  bank  can  generate  revenue  to
10:399:21934:18:18:72:539:423:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f14:disburse that is not fully offset by lowering the revenues of the fiscal authority, so thatft+dt
10:400:22030:18:18:72:540:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rise, this will lower the fiscal burden.  The unique revenues of the central bank come from
10:401:22121:18:18:72:540:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:selling  banknotes,  which  society  finds  useful  to  undertake  payments:  these  are  studied  in
10:402:22222:18:18:72:120:369:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:section 4.
10:403:22232:18:18:89:539:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Third,  some of the nominal commitments of the government may have their source in
10:404:22314:18:18:72:539:333:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the central bank.  That is, Φtmay include the liabilities issued by the central bank, reserves,
10:405:22409:18:18:72:540:315:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:or perhaps even banknotes.  Section 5 spells out the resource constraint of the central bank
10:406:22501:18:18:72:512:297:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and connects it to the fiscal burden to understand what is part of Φtand what is not.
10:407:22586:18:18:89:539:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The  fourth  channel  through  which  central  banks  affect  the  fiscal  burden  woks  as  well
10:408:22683:18:17:72:539:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:throughdt+j, but in the opposite direction.  If the central bank takes on income risk in its
10:409:22775:17:18:72:540:244:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:asset holdings, then it may incur losses which must be met by the fiscal authority through
10:410:22865:18:18:72:539:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a negativedt+j.  In the extreme, if the central bank is insolvent, then a large flow of funds
10:411:22958:18:18:72:540:208:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:may be necessary to recapitalize it.  Sections 6 to 9 describe the different sources of income
10:412:23052:18:18:72:540:190:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for  central  banks  as  a  result  of  holding  different  assets,  and  how  these  affect  the  flow  of
10:413:23159:18:18:72:430:172:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dividends to the fiscal authority and the solvency of the central bank.
10:414:23230:18:18:89:539:154:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The fifth and final channel studied in this paper is across fiscal authorities.  For a given
10:415:23322:18:18:72:540:136:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:total fiscal burden for an economic union, the central bank may be able to redistribute it
10:416:23412:18:0:72:540:118:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:across regions.  Section 10 discusses how the central bank can perform these redistributions
11:417:23505:0:18:72:246:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:using all of the previous channels.
11:418:23540:18:18:89:539:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:There are three further, indirect, channels through which the central bank can lighten the
11:419:23630:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fiscal burden, which this paper will not cover. They occur through three equilibrium variables
11:420:23724:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that  the  central  bank  is  far  from  precisely  controlling,  but  which  it  probably  somewhat
11:421:23824:18:18:72:539:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:affects:mt,t+j,ft+j, andδt+j.  If there is monetary non-neutrality, then the central bank’s
11:422:23915:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:actions will affect the real interest rate.  If, moreover, the fiscal authority adjusts its plans
11:423:24012:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in response to the central bank’s actions, then fiscal revenues are also affected.  Finally, if
11:424:24107:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:private investors perceive that the attractiveness of sovereign default depends on inflation
11:425:24199:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and on the size of reserves, then the central bank will also have some effect on the recovery
11:426:24292:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rates on public debt.  Each of these effects may be important.  But they really pertain to
11:427:24382:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:discussions of the Phillips curve, of monetary-fiscal interactions, and of equilibrium sovereign
11:428:24478:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:default, respectively.  These are much studied topics that have been well covered in many
11:429:24567:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:other places (e.g., Mankiw & Reis, 2010; Leeper & Leith, 2016; Aguiar & Amador, 2014),
11:430:24653:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and which would require specifying the actions of many more agents than just the central
11:431:24741:17:46:72:277:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bank.  They are left aside in this article.
11:432:24784:46:29:72:250:411:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:3    Inflating the debt
11:433:24807:29:18:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The  central  bank  can  choose  the  nominal  interest  rate  that  remunerates  bank  reserves.
11:434:24904:18:18:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Because  there  is  no  counterparty  nominal  risk  in  lending  to  the  central  bank—who  will
11:435:25002:18:18:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:always repay and can always do so—this interest rate should put a floor, or lower bound, on
11:436:25093:18:18:72:540:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:other nominal interest rates in the economy. At the same time, in its role as the clearinghouse,
11:437:25189:18:18:72:540:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the central bank could also announce that it will make loans to banks (which are negative
11:438:25278:18:18:72:540:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:individual reserves) at an announced interest rate.  This in turn puts a ceiling on interest
11:439:25370:18:18:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rates, since being able to borrow at any time from the central bank, no bank would pay more
11:440:25461:18:18:72:540:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to borrow from anyone else.  Both floor and ceiling combined imply that the central bank is
11:441:25552:18:18:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:able to pin down, by the sheer force of its announcements, the market nominal interest rate
11:442:25643:18:18:72:307:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on 1-period investments, which I denote byit.
11:443:25688:18:18:89:539:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Outside of the fictional model description in the previous paragraph, in reality, all ad-
11:444:25777:18:18:71:539:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:vanced country central banks are able to control the overnight nominal interest rate in their
11:445:25870:18:17:71:539:166:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:economies.  They may not do so through the simple borrowing and lending of reserves as in
11:446:25959:17:18:71:539:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the previous paragraph, but via direct purchases or repurchase agreements.  Moreover, the
11:447:26048:18:18:71:539:131:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:institutional details of interbank markets in each country may lead to deviations from the
11:448:26138:18:0:71:539:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:floor and/or ceiling described above.  Further, the central bank may allow for a gap between
12:449:26231:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:its deposit and lending rates, or what is called a “corridor system”, while using the quantity
12:450:26325:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of reserves outstanding to pin down a desired rate.  In spite of all this diversity, decades of
12:451:26420:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:experience have confirmed that through different implementation methods the central bank
12:452:26508:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:has an almost perfect control of the overnight safe nominal interest rate in advanced financial
12:453:26603:18:39:72:115:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:systems.

12:462:26749:36:18:72:540:500:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Because the central bank choosesitand, under the classical dichotomy,mt,t+1is not affected
12:463:26839:18:18:72:540:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:by these choices, this Fisher relation provides an equation with which to solve for inflation.
12:464:26933:18:18:72:540:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:At the same time, it is clear that this is only one equation for more than one unknown:  one
12:465:27025:18:17:72:539:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:has to pin down both the initial price levelptas well as the future price levelpt+1at each
12:466:27115:17:18:72:540:429:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the many possible future states of the world.  Therefore, simply choosing one exogenous
12:467:27205:18:18:72:339:411:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:interest rate will leave the price level indeterminate.
12:468:27260:18:18:89:539:393:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:These  problems  are  relatively  well  understood  and  the  topic  of  determining  the  price
12:469:27356:18:18:72:540:375:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:level has produced a large literature as well as recent surveys (Reis, 2015b), filled with ways
12:470:27451:18:18:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in which the central bank can pick the price level to control inflation.  The most popular
12:471:27541:18:18:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:strategy is perhaps the Taylor (1993) rule, while the simplest and most robust one is perhaps
12:472:27634:18:18:72:540:321:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the payment on reserves rule of Hall & Reis (2016).  In the latter case, the central bank makes

12:475:27917:18:18:71:539:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:then plugging this into the no-arbitrage condition, and rearranging, one gets a unique global

12:483:28236:18:18:71:539:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from fluctuations in the stochastic discount factor, the central bank can control inflation.  In
12:484:28332:18:17:71:540:147:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:picking a path for{pt+j}∞j=0, it can then affect the real value of nominal bonds, and so the
12:485:28424:17:18:71:236:130:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fiscal burden of the government.
12:486:28456:18:40:89:539:112:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:While this control of the price level is achieved via the power to choose the remuneration

13:489:28641:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:it pays.  Given its total issuance of reserves and credits on aggregate to the whole banking
13:490:28733:18:33:72:463:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sector,vt, the law of motion for reserves net of credit by the central bank is:
13:491:28812:33:33:250:540:639:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f3:vt= (1 +rt)vt−1+dt,(8)
13:492:28834:33:18:72:540:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:where 1 +rt= (1 +it−1)pt−1/ptis the ex post real return paid on the reserves.  The central
13:493:28924:18:18:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bank can issue more reserves to pay for the transfers it sends to the fiscal authority and for
13:494:29018:18:18:72:540:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:its  past commitments  to remunerate  reserves.  For the  control of  the  price level,  it is not
13:495:29116:18:18:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:necessary to have net reserves outstanding; arbitrage suffices.  The size of the balance sheet
13:496:29210:18:17:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the central bank has no direct link to inflation (Reis, 2016a).  The central bank can choose
13:497:29305:17:18:72:540:517:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f3:vt= 0 at all dates,  and still the price level will be under control simply by the promised
13:498:29396:18:18:72:540:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:interest rate on reserves that could be issued on demand.  Under this scenario, dividends to
13:499:29488:18:18:72:540:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the fiscal authority are always zero, and the central bank is always solvent.  Its effect on the
13:500:29584:18:39:72:296:463:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fiscal burden works solely through inflation.
13:501:29629:39:26:72:288:424:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:3.2    Surprises and persistence
13:502:29661:26:18:72:540:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:By how much can the central bank lower the fiscal burden depends not just on the amount,
13:503:29749:18:18:72:540:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:but also on the type of inflation that it engineers, and how it interacts with the maturity of
13:504:29843:18:18:72:488:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the outstanding debt.  To see this clearly, consider two special and extreme cases.
13:505:29926:18:18:89:539:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:First, imagine that there is a singleJ-period government bond outstanding that always
13:506:30011:18:35:72:268:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:repays its holders in full.  In that case:
13:507:30053:35:0:248:304:291:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f14:Φt=BJtEt
13:508:30061:0:9:307:316:308:12:g_d0_f16:12:g_d0_f16:(
13:509:30062:9:16:317:347:299:12:g_d0_f13:8:g_d0_f14:mt,t+J
13:510:30068:16:0:322:342:283:12:g_d0_f13:8:g_d0_f14:pt+J
13:511:30072:0:17:349:358:308:12:g_d0_f16:12:g_d0_f16:)
13:512:30073:17:36:360:540:291:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f3:.(9)
13:513:30077:36:18:72:540:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Imagine also that because of the delays in setting policy or in its transmission to the real
13:514:30169:18:17:72:540:237:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:economy, the central bank’s interest policy only has an effect on inflation inTperiods’ time.
13:515:30262:17:18:72:539:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In that case, ifT≤Jthen the central bank can still affectpt+Jand lower the fiscal burden
13:516:30350:18:18:72:539:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:by as much as it wants to.  But, ifT > J, then the central bank can set inflation to whatever
13:517:30443:18:18:72:540:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:it wants yet this will be neutral with respect to the fiscal burden.  The more general lesson
13:518:30536:18:18:72:540:166:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is that only if the central bank engineers a surprise increase in the price level before most of
13:519:30632:18:18:72:439:148:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the debt is due will it be able to inflate away a significant amount of it.
13:520:30707:18:18:89:539:130:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Hilscher et al. (2014) show that this extreme case is not so far-fetched.  They construct
13:521:30796:18:40:72:540:112:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  distribution  of  privately-held  debt  in  the  United  States  for  2012  and  find  that  it  has
13:522:30901:40:0:300:312:72:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:11
14:523:30903:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dramatically  lowered  in  duration  relative  to  just  a  decade  before.   The  average  duration
14:524:31003:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is  only  3.7  years.   In  turn,  using  market  expectations  of  inflation,  they  also  find  that  the
14:525:31110:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:probability that the price level will jump significantly in the space of just one or two years
14:526:31204:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is quite low.  Inflation is inertial, and the Federal Reserve would find it difficult to suddenly
14:527:31301:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and  unexpectedly  shift  policy  so  much  so  as  to  change  the  price  level  by  much  in  only  a
14:528:31405:18:18:72:539:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:few years.  As a result, theT > Jcase above is not so far as an approximation to the U.S.
14:529:31494:18:18:71:539:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:situation in 2012.  Hilscher et al. (2014) conclude that the probability that the United States
14:530:31589:18:18:71:460:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:could inflate away its debt by even as little as 5% of GDP is well below 1%.
14:531:31665:18:18:89:539:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:For  the  second  case,  consider  a  different  set  of  special  assumptions:  (i)  the  stochastic
14:532:31766:18:18:71:539:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:discount factor across one period is a constantm∈(0,1) so thatmt,t+j=mj; (ii) there are
14:533:31853:18:18:71:539:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:only two types of bonds outstanding entering periodt, a one-period bond that paysBsright
14:534:31941:18:18:71:539:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:away, and a consol that paysBcevery period in perpetuity; (iii) the central bank can choose
14:535:32032:18:18:71:539:492:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f3:ptfreely right away, but after that the price level evolves according topt+j=πjpt.  With
14:536:32120:18:35:71:265:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:these restrictions, the fiscal burden is:

14:545:32181:17:35:369:540:439:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f3:.(10)
14:546:32186:35:18:89:539:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The more persistent is inflation, the lower the real value of the debt will be.  Moreover,
14:547:32276:18:18:72:540:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:more persistence of inflation implies that the fiscal burden falls by more per unit of higher
14:548:32369:18:18:72:540:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:prices today.  Intuitively, higher persistence implies that the price level will be higher in the
14:549:32466:18:18:72:540:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:future, eating away at the real value of the consol.  This formula also makes clear how this
14:550:32558:18:18:72:540:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:effect depends on the interaction with the maturity of the government’s debt.  The larger is
14:551:32650:18:18:72:539:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the ratioBc/Bs, the larger the effect that higher inflation persistence has on inflating the
14:552:32742:18:18:72:98:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:debt.
14:553:32747:18:18:89:539:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To conclude, being able to inflate more quickly and with more persistence increases the
14:554:32834:18:18:72:540:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reduction in the fiscal burden that can be achieved.  But both of these properties interact
14:555:32925:18:18:72:540:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with the maturity of the debt.  With more complicated maturities than the two special cases
14:556:33016:18:18:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in this section, figuring out this interaction is not easy, and it can make a large difference
14:557:33110:18:39:72:173:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for the calculations.
14:558:33131:39:25:72:301:167:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:3.3    An options-based approach
14:559:33163:25:18:72:540:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In back of the envelope calculations, it is common to assume that inflation can be increased
14:560:33255:18:18:72:540:124:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:instantly and permanently and that the distribution of the maturity of government debt is
14:561:33344:18:0:72:540:106:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:exponential.  However, Hilscher et al. (2014) show that these seemingly innocent assumptions
15:562:33438:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dramatically overstate the effect of higher inflation on the public debt.  Moreover, while so far
15:563:33535:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we have assumed for analytical transparency that higher inflation does not affect real interest
15:564:33630:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rates, this Phillips curve effect can be substantial in the data.  Is there a relatively simple
15:565:33725:18:18:72:533:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:way to provide reliable estimates given the large error in these and other approximations?
15:566:33815:18:18:89:539:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The answer is in the formula for the debt burden.  It is a result in financial economics that
15:567:33908:18:18:72:539:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:iff(πt,t+j) is the probability density for inflationπt,t+j≡pt+j/pt, andrft,t+jdenotes the risk-

15:569:34089:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the risk-adjusted measure for inflation as:fQ(πt,t+j)≡(1 +rft,t+j)f(πt,t+j)mt,t+j(πt,t+j).  The
15:570:34184:18:39:72:307:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fiscal burden without default is then equal to:

15:597:35305:18:18:71:539:228:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a  required  amount  of  reserves  at  the  central  bank,  usually  against  their  deposits.   These
15:598:35407:18:18:71:539:210:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f14:required reserves often pay zero interest, so they are distinct from the voluntary reservesvt
15:599:35500:18:18:71:539:192:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that were discussed already.  We denote them byHtinstead (recalling that capitals denote
15:600:35588:18:18:72:539:174:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:variables  in  nominal  units).   Still  taking  the  casevt=  0,  without  loss  of  generality,  the
15:601:35690:18:33:72:320:156:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:resource constraint of the central bank becomes:
15:602:35738:33:0:260:540:123:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f3:ptdt=Ht−Ht−1.(12)
16:603:35757:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:By forcing banks to hold more of these required reserves, the central bank generates resources
16:604:35851:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that  it  can  then  rebate  to  the  fiscal  authorities.   Ultimately,  this  regulation  is  a  form  of
16:605:35958:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:taxation of the banks, and as such it is subject to the usual tradeoffs:  on the one hand it
16:606:36050:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:generates fiscal revenues,  on the other hand,  it also introduces distortions on the optimal
16:607:36143:18:18:72:339:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:size of banks and on the extent of deposit financing.
16:608:36196:18:18:89:539:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Closely related is the ability of the central bank to issue banknotes.  By definition, they
16:609:36287:18:39:72:479:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:pay zero interest.  This section studies this central bank product in more detail.
16:610:36369:39:26:72:448:561:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:4.1    The central bank as a seller of payment services
16:611:36424:26:18:72:540:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Central banks all over the world issue banknotes.  Currency is the sum of banknotes or coins,
16:612:36517:18:18:72:540:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and while the latter are sometimes issued by the Treasury this is usually under strict rules on
16:613:36612:18:17:72:540:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the ratio of coins to banknotes so that the central bank effectively has almost perfect control
16:614:36707:17:18:72:540:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:over total currency.  Reserves and currency the dual bedrock of the monetary system.  They
16:615:36797:18:18:72:540:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:come with the promise that they can be exchanged for reserves and vice versa, at any time,
16:616:36887:18:18:72:540:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on simple request, at a fixed exchange rate of one to one (which is why currency and reserves
16:617:36980:18:18:72:371:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:can be interchangeably referred to as the unit of account).
16:618:37039:18:18:89:539:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:For some reason, people find currency useful to make payments.  There is an enormous
16:619:37123:18:18:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:literature  on  why  this  is  so  (e.g.,  Nosal  &  Rocheteau,  2011).   For  our  purposes,  it  only
16:620:37226:18:18:72:540:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:matters that people happen to demand these services, and the central bank is their monopoly
16:621:37317:18:18:72:540:356:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:supplier.  Because they are durable, the monopolist sales are the first difference of the stock
16:622:37412:18:18:72:539:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of currency; because of the one-to-one exchange rate with reserves, their real price is 1/pt.
16:623:37505:18:18:71:539:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Therefore with only a slight abuse of notation, we can denote the sum of required reserves
16:624:37595:18:34:71:468:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and currency byHt, so the revenue from providing these payment services is:
16:625:37670:34:0:264:286:268:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f3:st=
16:626:37673:0:16:290:342:276:12:g_d0_f13:8:g_d0_f18:Ht−Ht−1
16:627:37680:16:0:312:320:260:12:g_d0_f13:8:g_d0_f14:pt
16:628:37682:0:35:343:540:268:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f3:.(13)
16:629:37687:35:18:72:247:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This is typically called seignorage.
16:630:37723:18:18:89:539:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In the most standard model of monetary economics, due to Sidrauski (1967), the central
16:631:37809:18:18:72:540:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bank rebates this revenue to households every period.  An alternative story, due to Friedman
16:632:37901:18:17:72:540:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(1969) imagines the central bank dropping the banknotes from a helicopter,  or effectively
16:633:37991:17:18:72:540:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:giving  away  the  seignorage  revenue  by  distributing  currency  for  free.   In  either  of  these
16:634:38093:18:18:72:540:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:two  cases,  the  fiscal  effect  is  neutral.   The  central  bank  pays  zero  dividends  to  the  fiscal
16:635:38200:18:18:72:540:126:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:authorities,  and the analysis of the previous section applies,  so the central bank can only
16:636:38293:18:36:72:540:108:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:affect fiscal burdens via debasement of the nominal debt.  But this is not how central banks
16:637:38385:36:0:300:312:72:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:14
17:638:38387:0:39:72:156:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:supply currency.
17:639:38403:39:25:72:230:669:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:4.2    Fiscalist inflation
17:640:38429:25:18:72:540:644:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Closer  to  reality,  central  banks  collect  the  seignorage  revenue  and  pay  it  off  to  the  fiscal
17:641:38536:18:33:72:479:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:authority every period, so the resource constraint of the central bank is simply:
17:642:38617:33:33:287:540:593:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f3:dt=st.(14)
17:643:38627:33:18:71:539:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In this case, the central bank rebates the revenue from its monopoly supply of a publicly-
17:644:38717:18:18:71:539:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:provided good to the fiscal authorities.  From a different perspective, the central bank is a
17:645:38810:18:18:71:539:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:collector of the inflation tax on the holders of currency.  Either way, the central bank is not
17:646:38905:18:18:71:539:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:all that different from the parking tickets office, or the issuer of permits for boats:  it collects
17:647:39005:18:17:71:539:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a revenue and uses it to provide direct fiscal transfers that lower the fiscal burden of the
17:648:39097:17:18:71:133:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:government.
17:649:39108:18:18:89:539:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:It is tempting to say that by printing more banknotes the central bank can just increase
17:650:39196:18:18:71:539:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:this  revenue.   While  this  is  often  taught  in  introductory  economics  classes,  it  is  quite  far
17:651:39302:18:18:71:539:417:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:removed from the reality of central banking. No modern central bank choosesHtexogenously.
17:652:39391:18:18:71:539:399:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Rather, they choose the interest on reserves and in doing so give rise to some equilibrium
17:653:39481:18:18:71:539:381:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:inflation.   Then  they  simply  stand  ready  to  accommodate  whatever  demand  for  currency
17:654:39576:18:18:71:539:363:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:there is.  The amount of banknotes in circulation is not chosen by the central bank, as they
17:655:39668:18:18:71:379:345:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:satisfyanydemand that there is for this means of payment.
17:656:39725:18:18:89:539:327:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:How is the amount of currency in circulation then endogenously determined?  Because
17:657:39808:18:18:71:539:309:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:currency pays no interest, and households and firms could instead hold their savings in a bond
17:658:39902:18:18:71:539:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that pays the nominal interest rate, the opportunity cost of holding money is approximately
17:659:39993:18:18:71:539:273:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equal to the short-term interest rateit.  Almost all models of the demand for currency then
17:660:40084:18:18:71:540:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:give rise to a declining function of this opportunity cost:L(.) :IR+→IR+.  This gives the
17:661:40173:18:9:71:115:237:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:demand:
17:662:40180:9:17:267:280:228:12:g_d0_f13:8:g_d0_f14:Ht
17:663:40182:17:0:264:282:211:12:g_d0_f13:8:g_d0_f14:ptyt
17:664:40186:0:29:287:540:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:=L(1 +it).(15)
17:665:40200:29:18:71:539:191:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f3:L(.) is sometimes called the inverse velocity of currency.  The central bank therefore chooses
17:666:40294:18:18:71:539:173:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:an interest-rate,  which pins down inflation,  and this determines the demand for currency.
17:667:40385:18:18:71:532:155:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Printing currency is not an independent option from changing interest rates and inflation.
17:668:40475:18:18:89:539:137:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Sargent & Wallace (1981) clarified this point in a forceful way.  Imagine the central bank
17:669:40565:18:18:71:540:119:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:was  solely  focussed  on  generating  a  fiscal  revenue  for  the  fiscal  authorities,  sodt/ytwas
17:670:40666:18:29:71:539:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:imposed on it exogenously.  Then, this would pin down an inflation path, since combining
17:671:40754:29:0:300:312:72:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:15
18:672:40756:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equations (13)-(15) given an exogenousdt/yt, one gets a stochastic difference equation for

18:701:41017:18:18:89:539:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The general lesson is that “printing money” to generate revenue is not an independent
18:702:41102:18:18:71:539:591:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:choice from setting interest rates and determining inflation. The central bank is the monopoly
18:703:41196:18:18:71:539:573:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:supplier of a durable good;  it cannot just “sell more” to get more revenue, rather it must
18:704:41287:18:18:71:539:555:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:change the price for its good.  In the case of the central banks’ output, banknotes, the only
18:705:41380:18:39:71:369:537:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:way to raise its revenue, seignorage, is to let inflation rise.
18:706:41443:39:26:71:219:498:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:4.3    How large is it?
18:707:41466:26:18:71:539:472:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Because printing banknotes can be done quickly, seignorage is an appealing source of revenue
18:708:41558:18:18:71:539:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for the government, and it is an effective way for the central bank to lower the fiscal burden,
18:709:41653:18:17:71:539:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:albeit  at a  cost of higher inflation.  A  long literature has  discussed the use of this source
18:710:41750:17:18:71:539:419:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of revenue (Cagan, 1956; Fischer et al., 2002).  A common conclusion is that it is relatively

18:727:42134:18:18:71:539:275:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2015 was 6.11% on average, while average nominal income growth rate was 6.32%. Seignorage
18:728:42223:18:18:71:539:257:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:has therefore been approximately 0.36% of GDP. By comparison, in the data after taking
18:729:42309:18:18:71:539:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:away the costs of running its operations, the Federal Reserve’s average remittances to the
18:730:42399:18:18:71:276:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:U.S. Treasury have been 0.31% of GDP.
18:731:42436:18:18:89:539:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Increasingπwould raise the last term in brackets on the right-hand side, but at the same
18:732:42524:18:18:71:539:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:time it would lower inverse-velocity.  This is the typical taxation effect:  higher taxes directly
18:733:42622:18:18:71:539:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:raise  tax  revenue,  but  lower  it  by  reducing  the  tax  base.   A  standard  specification  of  the
18:734:42727:18:18:71:539:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:demand for currency writes velocity as an iso-elastic functionL(1 +it)≡L0[it/(1 +it)]−η.
18:735:42815:18:18:71:540:131:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:TheL0is a constant, while Lucas (2000) suggests thatη= 0.5 is roughly consistent with
18:736:42900:18:0:71:539:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  U.S.  data.   Under  this  particular  specification,  increasing  inflation  from  its  1960-2015
19:737:43005:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:average of 3.31% by one percentage point would raise seignorage by a mere 0.02% of GDP.
19:738:43092:18:18:72:523:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Even raising inflation by a whole 10% would increase seignorage by only 0.17% of GDP.
19:739:43177:18:18:89:539:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:It  is  not  easy  to  estimate  the  peak  of  this  Laffer  curve  for  banknotes.   Historically,
19:740:43277:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Fischer  et  al.  (2002)  suggest  from  looking  at  a  cross  section  of  countries  that  the  peak
19:741:43380:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:happens at 174% inflation with seignorage of about 6% of GDP. They also document that
19:742:43465:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:even in deep fiscal cises, when fiscal balances run at a 10% deficit, usually inflation is only
19:743:43560:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in  the  order  of  20%.   Outside  of  steady  state,  Hilscher  et  al.  (2016)  estimate  the  present
19:744:43665:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:value of seignorage for the United States through a variety of different perspectives using
19:745:43756:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:market inflation expectations.  Even under their most generous estimates, the present value
19:746:43847:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of seignorage is never above 30% of GDP, and a more accurate estimate is slightly above 20%.
19:747:43939:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The amount of banknotes in circulation is simply not that large for steady-state seignorage
19:748:44030:18:18:72:238:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to be all that fiscally significant.
19:749:44066:18:18:89:539:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Another source of seignorage revenue comes from requiring some reserves to be held by
19:750:44151:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:banks.  Measuring the limits on this implicit tax is harder.  Directly, this tax on collecting
19:751:44245:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:deposits should reduce savings in the banking sector, therefore affecting the tax base.  Per-
19:752:44338:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:haps more importantly though is the indirect effect.  As banks face a higher marginal cost
19:753:44428:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of financing, this should lead to fewer projects being financed by bank credit, which in turn
19:754:44521:18:18:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:should lower economic activity, the amount of wealth, and thus the amount held as deposits.
19:755:44612:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Estimating the full general-equilibrium Laffer curve is therefore not easy.  Insofar as a sudden
19:756:44708:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:increase in bank reserves can precipitate a financial crisis, trying this policy option can be
19:757:44802:18:18:72:252:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:very costly (Hoggarth et al., 2002).
19:758:44838:18:18:89:539:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To  conclude,  seignorage  may  be  useful  to  smooth  small  business-cycle  fluctuations  in
19:759:44933:18:18:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:government revenue while keeping tax rates fixed (Chari et al., 1991), so it may be a source
19:760:45025:18:45:72:498:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of fiscal smoothing.  But on average, its role in overall government revenue is small.

19:763:45248:18:18:72:540:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bank, they are a government liability.  This section asks whether reserves (and banknotes)
19:764:45338:18:0:72:245:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:should be part of the public debt.

20:766:45438:26:18:72:540:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:With both seignorage and reserves present, then the equality between sources and uses of

20:779:45676:40:18:89:539:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Reserves are just another form of government liability.  Banks must voluntarily choose to
20:780:45765:18:18:72:540:501:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:hold them and, like any other private agent, they will not be willing to hold an asset that is
20:781:45859:18:18:72:540:483:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a Ponzi scheme.  Of course the central bank can always just issue new reserves to pay for the
20:782:45952:18:18:72:540:465:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:interest on old reserves.  But so can a standard consumer issue new debt to pay past debt in
20:783:46044:18:18:72:540:447:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:textbook microeconomics.  The problem is not the ability to issue pieces of paper that stand
20:784:46136:18:18:72:540:429:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for liabilities, but rather whether these can have a positive value in the sense that private
20:785:46229:18:18:72:540:411:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:agents are willing to give you positive real resources in return.  Therefore, reserves cannot

20:810:46941:18:18:71:540:133:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:always count on the fiscal authority to set a sequence of{dt+j}∞j=0that satisfies the central

21:816:47508:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:liabilities are backed by the overall fiscal authorities, then a government agency cannot be

21:829:48017:18:18:89:539:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This equation makes clear that reserves are just another government liability.  They count
21:830:48107:18:18:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for the fiscal burden, and they could be included in the public debt.  However, counting them
21:831:48200:18:18:72:540:430:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:as public debt would require making two more adjustments to public accounting.  Once these
21:832:48290:18:18:72:539:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f20:are done, at least for the four countries in figure 1, including reserves would actuallylower
21:833:48383:18:18:72:209:394:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the calculated public debt.
21:834:48410:18:18:89:539:376:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:First, adding reserves to the left-hand side comes with adding seignorage to the right-hand
21:835:48501:18:18:72:540:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:side in the source of funds.  As discussed in section 4, the present value of U.S. seignorage
21:836:48594:18:18:72:540:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is  somewhere  between  20%  and  30%  of  GDP  while,  as  displayed  in  figure  1,  outstanding
21:837:48692:18:18:72:540:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reserves peaked at 15% of GDP. Second, the issuance of reserves often happens to fund the
21:838:48781:18:18:72:540:304:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:purchase of public debt.  When this happens, it leaves the right-hand side of the equation
21:839:48871:18:17:72:540:286:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:unchanged, since the highervt−1is immediately offset by a lower Φt.  Section 8 will further
21:840:48962:17:18:72:540:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:explore this Modigliani-Miller neutrality whereby exchanging one form of public liability for
21:841:49055:18:18:72:540:251:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:another makes no difference to the overall fiscal burden.  Currently, for the countries in figure
21:842:49152:18:18:72:540:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:1, the value of their bond portfolio exceeds the value of outstanding reserves.  Net of assets
21:843:49246:18:18:72:466:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and seignorage, including reserves would then actually lower the public debt.
21:844:49323:18:18:89:539:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Moreover, starting from an initial situation where reserves were zero, then the future path
21:845:49414:18:18:72:540:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of reserves from then onwards would make no difference to the fiscal burden.  The ability to
21:846:49506:18:18:72:540:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:issue reserves does not alleviate per se the fiscal burden of the government; it is the present
21:847:49601:18:18:72:540:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:value of seignorage that matters.  Intuitively,  no net transfers result from issuing reserves
21:848:49695:18:18:72:540:125:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:because  in  equilibrium  no  arbitrage  ensures  that  no  matter  what  nominal  interest  rate  is
21:849:49796:18:0:72:540:107:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:chosen, the price level will adjust and reserves will end up paying the market real return.
22:850:49889:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Therefore,  issuing reserves ends up boiling down to another government liability,  with no
22:851:49980:18:18:72:421:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:creation of new resources, so they do not alleviate the fiscal burden.
22:852:50050:18:18:89:539:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Finally, banknotes in circulation do not enter the resource constraint above.  They are
22:853:50137:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:not a liability of the government or of the central bank.  Rather, they are a durable good
22:854:50227:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that the central bank produces and sells.  Therefore, currency only affects the fiscal burden
22:855:50320:18:39:72:380:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:via the seignorage revenue discussed in the previous section.
22:856:50381:39:26:72:411:579:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:5.3    Central bank independence and insolvency
22:857:50428:26:18:72:540:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The analysis of the previous sub-section implies that there is no independent resource con-
22:858:50519:18:18:72:540:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:straint  on  the  actions  of  the  central  bank.   Whatever  losses  or  gains,  the  fiscal  authority
22:859:50624:18:18:72:540:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:would back the central bank, and as such the only binding constraint is the integrated bud-
22:860:50715:18:17:72:540:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:get constraint of the fiscal and monetary authorities.  As Hall & Reis (2015) clarified, the
22:861:50807:17:18:72:540:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:institution of central bank independence breaks this situation.  A minimal condition for in-
22:862:50899:18:18:72:540:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dependence of choices and actions of the central bank in terms of its setting of interest rates,
22:863:50995:18:18:72:540:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is the ability of the central bank to finance its operations without needing approval from the
22:864:51089:18:18:72:540:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Treasury (Amtenbrink, 2010; Masciandari & Romelli, 2017).  This requires the central bank
22:865:51178:18:18:72:540:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:having its own budget, independently of fiscal authorities, and to not relay on the Treasury
22:866:51270:18:18:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to approve recapitalizations of the central bank and impose conditions on monetary policy
22:867:51359:18:18:72:540:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:attached to these.  Formally, central bank independence means a constraint on the sequence
22:868:51449:18:18:72:540:356:12:g_d0_f15:12:g_d0_f3:{dt+j}∞j=0.  It is the joint combination of a constraint on the flow of dividends,{dt+j}∞j=0, and
22:869:51546:18:18:71:539:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the no Ponzi scheme condition in equation (20), that leads to a meaningful intertemporal
22:870:51634:18:18:71:363:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:resource constraint for the central bank in equation (21).
22:871:51692:18:18:89:539:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:There is no bankruptcy or insolvency procedure for a central bank.  That is, there is no
22:872:51780:18:18:71:539:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:legal framework or institution that will judge if a central bank’s liabilities exceed its assets
22:873:51876:18:17:71:539:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and force it to reorganize or be liquidated.  If any private agent wants to settle a claim on the
22:874:51973:17:18:71:539:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:central bank, or is willing to sell the central bank a good or asset, then as long as the claim
22:875:52068:18:18:71:539:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:or price are denominated in units of currency, the central bank can always pay by issuing
22:876:52157:18:18:71:539:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:more reserves and standing ready to exchange them for banknotes on request.  But if the
22:877:52244:18:18:71:539:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:central bank cannot go legally insolvent, how can it be that it has a resource constraint, like
22:878:52339:18:18:71:154:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we just derived?
22:879:52355:18:18:89:539:159:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The standard model of intertemporal consumer behavior taught in microeconomic text-
22:880:52438:18:18:71:539:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:books  also  does  not  have  insolvency  legal  proceedings,  but  it  puts  a  strict  constraint  on
22:881:52541:18:18:71:539:123:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the consumer.  That comes from the no-Ponzi constraint, so that insolvency in a rational-
22:882:52630:18:0:71:539:105:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:expectations model ends up typically being an off-equilibrium event, that is not observed but
23:883:52725:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is still relevant.  Likewise for the central bank in the standard economic model described so
23:884:52818:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:far, the no Ponzi scheme condition is the constraint that provides meaning to central-bank
23:885:52908:18:18:72:127:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:insolvency.
23:886:52919:18:18:89:539:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:If the central bank tries to have reserves shoot for infinity, as in a Ponzi scheme, then the
23:887:53012:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:real value of reserves for a private agent will be zero.  Since, by definition the value of reserves
23:888:53112:18:18:72:539:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is 1/pt, when no one wants to hold them, thenpt=∞.  This is what is special about central
23:889:53201:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:banks:  their  insolvency  is  synonymous  with  hyperinflation  or  currency  reform.   It  is  not
23:890:53301:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:impossible, or even rare, for central banks to go insolvent; it happens all the time around the
23:891:53396:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:world.  Insolvency happens when people no longer accept to hold the central bank’s liabilities
23:892:53490:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and the country has to re-denominate its currency, an event which countries frequently go
23:893:53579:18:18:72:116:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:through.
23:894:53587:18:18:89:539:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Still, you may wonder, how is it that a central bank that can print currency is unable
23:895:53673:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to pay all its nominal reserves debt?  Since banknotes are legal tender to settle any debt,
23:896:53764:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:isn’t reverting from interest-rate setting to exogenously choosing the supply of currency the
23:897:53857:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:answer to prevent insolvency?  To formally evaluate this intuition, consider a pseudo final
23:898:53948:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:date, datet, when the central bank must pay a very large nominal dividend.  After that, no
23:899:54038:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:more payments are made, but also no more reserves or banknotes are issued.  The flow of
23:900:54125:18:33:72:278:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:funds, now written in nominal terms, is:
23:901:54165:33:33:222:540:370:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f3:Ht−Ht−1= (1 +it−1)Vt−1+Dt,(23)
23:902:54195:33:18:72:540:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:whereVt−1andDtare reserves and dividends, respectively, in nominal terms.  From datet+1
23:903:54282:18:18:72:540:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:onwards, since there are no dividends or reserves, the central bank can close its doors, and
23:904:54374:18:18:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the currency supply stays fixed atHtforever.  This equation formalizes the intuition behind
23:905:54465:18:17:72:539:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the questions in this paragraph because, not matter how largeVt−1orDtare, the central
23:906:54550:17:18:72:539:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bank could always chooseHtlarge enough to make this hold.  Moreover, since reserves would
23:907:54639:18:18:72:539:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:be zero from datetonwards, clearly the no Ponzi scheme condition would be satisfied.  It
23:908:54727:18:18:72:540:230:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:might seem therefore that a central bank that switches from the current policy of setting
23:909:54816:18:18:72:442:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:interest rates to exogenously printing banknotes would not be insolvent.
23:910:54888:18:18:89:539:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This thinking is incorrect because it keeps inflation andVt−1fixed, when in fact the act
23:911:54976:18:18:72:540:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of printing banknotes would change them.  As already noted, given a stable demand function
23:912:55066:18:0:72:430:158:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f3:L(.), raising the supply of banknotes must come with higher inflation.
24:913:55138:0:36:89:495:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:If this inflation was unexpected, then the ex post real payment on the reserves:
24:914:55218:36:0:248:289:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:1 +rt=
24:915:55224:0:16:294:361:680:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f18:(1 +it−1)pt−1
24:916:55237:16:0:323:332:664:12:g_d0_f13:8:g_d0_f14:pt
24:917:55239:0:34:519:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(24)
24:918:55243:34:18:71:539:638:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:will be unexpectedly low.  Therefore, at this final date, holders of reserves will receive a much
24:919:55340:18:18:71:539:620:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lower return than expected.  The extra inflation is equivalent to the decline in the recovery
24:920:55433:18:18:71:539:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rate of a government bond during sovereign insolvency.  One may not call it insolvency, but in
24:921:55527:18:18:71:539:584:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fact it is just like it:  the payment on reserves is well below what was promised and expected.
24:922:55622:18:18:89:539:566:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Alternatively,  if  the  inflation  was  expected,  then  agents  would  have  asked  for  a  much
24:923:55720:18:18:71:539:548:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:largerit−1the  period  before.   But  this  leads  to  a  larger  needed  payment  on  reserves  this
24:924:55821:18:18:71:539:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:period, which in turn requires even more printing of banknotes in the current period, and
24:925:55910:18:18:71:539:512:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the process continues.  As we saw in the previous section, ultimately there is an upper bound
24:926:56003:18:18:71:539:494:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on the real resources that can be generated by seignorage, such that the central bank simply
24:927:56095:18:18:71:540:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cannot pay the real amount required by markets on its reserves at datet−1.  But in that
24:928:56182:18:18:71:539:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:case, banks will not want to accept reserves at datet−1, so their real value would be zero
24:929:56272:18:17:71:207:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:andpt−1would be infinity.
24:930:56297:17:18:89:539:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The argument that the ability to print banknotes without bound excludes insolvency is
24:931:56382:18:18:71:539:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:therefore  incorrect.   Ex  post  or  ex  ante,  the  ability  to  print  banknotes  does  not  stop  the
24:932:56487:18:18:71:539:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:two manifestations of insolvency:  the ex ante unwillingness of lenders to roll over the debt,
24:933:56581:18:18:71:539:369:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:or the ex post large haircuts on defaulting debt.  An alternative way to state this is that
24:934:56672:18:18:71:539:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:being solvent can be interpreted as being able to keep one’s promises.  A central bank that
24:935:56763:18:18:71:539:333:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:promised  a  nominal  interest  rate  on  reserves  and  that  promised  to  hit  a  certain  inflation

24:937:56957:18:18:71:539:297:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:actual returnrtis well below what was expected.  This happens when inflation is well above
24:938:57047:18:18:71:171:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:what was expected.
24:939:57065:18:18:89:539:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To sum up, it is the combination of central bank independence and central bank insol-

25:947:57679:30:18:72:540:678:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Most central banks across the world hold large reserves of foreign assets.  Foreign assets come
25:948:57774:18:18:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with what is perhaps the major source of income risk to the central bank, that associated
25:949:57863:18:18:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with fluctuations in exchange rates.  This section studies the implications this has for the
25:950:57955:18:18:72:540:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dividend flow to the fiscal authorities and how it interacts with the constraints that determine
25:951:58051:18:39:72:185:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:central bank solvency.
25:952:58073:39:26:72:220:567:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:6.1    Period solvency
25:953:58095:26:17:72:540:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The charters of the European Central Bank have no explicit allowance for automatic recap-
25:954:58184:17:18:72:540:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:italizations.   For  the  ECB  to  receive  a  transfer  from  the  fiscal  authorities  (a  negativedt)
25:955:58288:18:18:72:540:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:there must be an explicit agreement by all of the nation members of the Eurosystem.  In
25:956:58375:18:18:72:540:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:most circumstances, this is politically very difficult.  Therefore, the ECB can be interpreted
25:957:58469:18:18:72:540:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:as having the weakest of fiscal support from the European fiscal authorities, with negative
25:958:58560:18:18:72:296:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dividends being ruled out, or{dt+j}∞j=0≥0.
25:959:58602:18:18:89:539:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:At the same time, the charters of the ECB state that it must rebate its net income to the
25:960:58691:18:18:71:539:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:national central banks of the Eurosystem every year, and many of these are then required
25:961:58779:18:18:71:539:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:by national law to send them as dividends to their respective fiscal authorities.  Therefore,
25:962:58872:18:33:71:446:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to a first approximation, the dividend rule of the ECB can be written as:
25:963:58945:33:32:242:540:347:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f3:dt= max{st−rtvt−1,0}.(25)
25:964:58970:32:18:71:539:315:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:For our simple central bank that so far only issues reserves and prints banknotes, net income
25:965:59063:18:18:71:539:297:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is  equal  to  the  seignorage  from  printing  banknotes  minus  the  interest  paid  on  reserves.
25:966:59163:18:18:71:539:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:When paid interest exceeds seignorage, net income is negative, and the central bank does
25:967:59251:18:18:71:539:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:not receive any recapitalization form the fiscal authorities.  In this extreme reading of the
25:968:59344:18:18:71:539:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:charters of the ECB, every time the central bank records a positive net income it must rebate
25:969:59437:18:18:71:539:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:it to governments, but when net income is negative it can expect no transfer from the fiscal
25:970:59529:18:18:71:121:207:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:authority.
25:971:59539:18:18:89:539:189:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Over the past century, across most of the developed world, annual seignorage has usually
25:972:59627:18:18:71:539:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:been positive.  Nominal income growth has been positive in most years, and the velocity of
25:973:59717:18:18:71:539:153:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:currency seems to be stationary, sostis positive by the end of the year.  However, consider
25:974:59808:18:18:71:539:135:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:what would happen to our hypothetical central bank if in one year, seignorage turned out
25:975:59896:18:0:71:539:117:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:negative.  Starting from zero reserves and zero asset, that year the central bank would have
26:976:59990:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to borrow to offset this fall in income.  As banks come to deposit some of their currency at
26:977:60082:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the central bank, they receive reserves in return.  Interest must now be paid on these reserves
26:978:60177:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:forever since positive net income is sent to the fiscal authorities and cannot be used to retire
26:979:60273:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reserves.  Every time that net income is negative in the future, which happens more often
26:980:60362:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:when reserves are higher, again reserves grow.  At some point, the total interest on reserves
26:981:60455:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:exceeds seignorage at all dates, and the central bank must issue reserves every year just to
26:982:60547:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:pay for the interest.  The central bank is running a Ponzi scheme;  it is insolvent to start
26:983:60639:18:18:72:98:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with.
26:984:60644:18:18:89:539:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:More formally, combining the dividend rule with the resource constraint in equation (18)
26:985:60732:18:33:72:268:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:leads to the law of motion for reserves
26:986:60771:33:32:225:540:513:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f3:vt=vt−1+ max{0,rtvt−1−st}.(26)
26:987:60801:32:18:72:539:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Therefore,vt≥vt−1almost surely.  Moreover, oncevtis large, sostis negligible with respect

26:989:60984:18:18:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:value  of  reserves  is  strictly  positive,  violating  the  no-Ponzi  scheme  condition  in  equation
26:990:61087:18:18:72:96:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(20).
26:991:61092:18:18:89:540:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Reis  (2015a)  called  thisperiod insolvency.   Under  the  asymmetric  dividend  rule  that
26:992:61184:18:18:72:540:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:does  not  allow  for  any  negative  dividends,  then  as  long  as  there  is  a  positive  probability
26:993:61289:18:18:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of  negative  seignorage  in  one  period,  the  central  bank  becomes  insolvent.   Hall  &  Reis
26:994:61388:18:18:72:540:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(2015) characterize the circumstances wheredt<0 for the United States and the ECB, by
26:995:61473:18:18:72:540:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:measuring the necessary recapitalizations of the central bank to cover the possible losses.
26:996:61564:18:18:72:540:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Understanding  the  period  solvency  of  the  central  bank  reduces  then  to  inspecting  its  net
26:997:61665:18:18:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:income, and gauging the circumstances under which this can be negative, since these define
26:998:61755:18:39:72:368:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the cases where the central bank becomes a fiscal burden.
26:999:61812:39:25:72:394:244:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:6.2    Risky assets and central bank net worth
26:1000:61858:25:18:72:540:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Let the central bank now buy risky assets in the amountzt.  For simplicity, imagine that this
26:1001:61951:18:18:72:540:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:asset pays no dividend but has a non-zero real priceet, as in the case of foreign currency,
26:1002:62042:18:18:72:540:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:although one could extend the analysis to have a risky dividend with no significant changes
26:1003:62133:18:18:72:539:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to the conclusions.  In this case,etwould stand for the real exchange rate, such that when
26:1004:62223:18:0:72:540:147:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:this rises, the foreign currency appreciates relative to the domestic currency.  No arbitrage
27:1005:62318:0:36:72:273:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with respect to this asset imposes that:

27:1012:62382:35:33:89:353:637:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The resource constraint of this central bank now is:
27:1013:62434:33:33:200:540:604:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f3:vt= (1 +rt)vt−1−st+dt+et(zt−zt−1).(28)
27:1014:62472:33:18:72:540:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The new term reflects the fact that funding new purchases of the risky asset must be done
27:1015:62561:18:18:72:540:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:by issuing reserves.  The risk comes because whilezt−1is chosen last period, its real payment
27:1016:62654:18:18:72:540:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:today depends onet, so reserves today may have to be used to offset losses.  The no-Ponzi
27:1017:62743:18:33:72:259:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:scheme condition on reserves now is:

27:1021:62809:32:18:72:441:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reflecting the central bank’s assets that can be used to pay the reserves.
27:1022:62883:18:18:89:539:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Having introduced assets on the central bank balance sheet, there is also now a definition
27:1023:62973:18:18:72:540:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of  central  bank  net  worth  as  the  difference  between  the  value  of  assets  and  the  value  of
27:1024:63077:18:18:72:196:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:liabilities.  In real terms:

27:1026:63120:26:18:72:540:354:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:By itself,  this definition does not mean much.  Unlike private corporations,  central banks
27:1027:63212:18:18:72:540:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cannot  be  closed  down  by  their  creditors  demanding  a  sale  of  the  assets  in  order  to  pay
27:1028:63315:18:18:72:540:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for  the  liabilities,  so  whether  net  worth  is  positive  or  negative  has  in  itself  no  economic
27:1029:63421:18:18:72:540:300:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:implications.  However, when combined with the no Ponzi scheme condition, note that if net
27:1030:63511:18:18:72:540:282:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:worth is constant, as long asmt,Tdeclines withT, which is true in almost all models, then
27:1031:63600:18:18:72:540:264:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the central bank will always be solvent.  Requiring constancy of net worth is sufficient, but
27:1032:63693:18:17:72:243:246:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:not necessary, to ensure solvency.
27:1033:63727:17:18:89:539:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The pervasiveness of the concept of net worth has led to it creeping into the rules for
27:1034:63814:18:18:72:540:211:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  operations  of  central  banks  and  for  distribution  of  dividends  to  the  fiscal  authority.
27:1035:63917:18:18:72:540:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:For  instance,  the  way  in  which  net  income  is  calculated  is  often  following  the  accounting
27:1036:64020:18:18:72:540:175:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:convention of it being the first difference in the balance sheet.  In other words, net income is
27:1037:64116:18:18:72:540:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:such that if it was paid as a dividend, net worth would be constant.  In this case, net income
27:1038:64210:18:18:72:128:139:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is equal to:
27:1039:64222:18:0:221:540:121:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f3:xt=st−rtvt−1+ (et−et−1)zt−1.(31)
28:1040:64256:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The  first  two  terms  are  familiar.   They  are  the  income  from  seignorage  and  the  expenses
28:1041:64357:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from paying interest on reserves.  Both are expressed in real terms using market prices.  The
28:1042:64450:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:last term measures the marked-to-market capital gain from owning foreign reserves.  Because
28:1043:64541:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:net worth is constant, then the central bank is solvent as long as negative net income comes
28:1044:64633:18:39:72:315:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with a recapitalization by the fiscal authorities.

28:1055:64908:36:18:71:539:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:When this is negative, either the central bank is period insolvent, or it must be recapitalized,
28:1056:65004:18:18:71:214:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:increasing the fiscal burden.
28:1057:65033:18:17:89:539:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The first term in the expression is the same as in the previous subsection.  By  selling
28:1058:65121:17:18:71:539:429:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:banknotes, the central bank earns seignorage.  The second term is new, and equal the interest
28:1059:65214:18:18:71:539:411:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:earned on the net worth.  Insofar as the central bank started with assets exceeding reserves,
28:1060:65307:18:18:71:539:393:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:it will earn a return on this endowment.  This can be used as a buffer against fluctuations
28:1061:65398:18:18:71:539:375:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in the other components of income to prevent period insolvency.  Even though this term is
28:1062:65487:18:18:71:539:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:small  for  most  central  banks,  it  can  be  large  enough  to  offset  some  of  the  rare  instances
28:1063:65592:18:18:71:539:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:where seignorage is negative.  Central bank net worth can therefore eliminate the insolvency
28:1064:65684:18:18:71:539:321:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that  we  discussed  in  the  previous  subsection  and,  together  with  periodic  recapitalization,
28:1065:65785:18:18:71:539:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:account for why the Fed, the ECB or the Bank of England have not experienced insolvency
28:1066:65872:18:18:71:150:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in their history.
28:1067:65889:18:18:89:539:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The last term is zero in risk-adjusted expectation; just multiply by the stochastic discount
28:1068:65981:18:18:71:539:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:factor and take expectations using the no-arbitrage pricing conditions to see this. On average,
28:1069:66076:18:18:71:539:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  central  bank  does  not  earn  excess  returns  on  its  holdings  of  risky  assets.   Still,  given
28:1070:66183:18:18:71:539:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fluctuations in the price of those assets, if the portfolio of assets is large, the central bank
28:1071:66279:18:17:71:539:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:could  earn  a  large  positive  or  negative  income  in  any  given  year.   In  the  case  of  foreign
28:1072:66384:17:18:71:539:178:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:currency, losses happen if the domestic real exchange rate appreciates more than expected.
28:1073:66474:18:18:71:539:160:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:With the very large amount of reserves that were accumulated by the central banks in many
28:1074:66563:18:18:71:539:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:emerging  countries  so  far  this  century,  even  small  fluctuations  in  currency  can  make  the
28:1075:66664:18:18:71:415:124:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:central bank have losses, and even end up with negative net worth.
28:1076:66730:18:0:89:539:106:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The situation becomes more extreme when there are large fluctuations in exchange rates
29:1077:66818:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:during  crisis.   Countries  often  accumulate  large  foreign  reserves  in  order  to  defend  their
29:1078:66920:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:currency pegs.  When the markets expect the currency to depreciate and the central bank
29:1079:67007:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:successfully  defends  the  peg,  the  exchange  rate  depreciates  by  less  than  expected,  so  the
29:1080:67109:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:central bank accumulates a loss in its large foreign holdings.  When the peg is let go, the
29:1081:67200:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:surprise depreciation should give the central bank a large gain.  But this is typically done
29:1082:67292:18:18:72:539:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:by  the  time  whenztis  already  very  low,  so  the  gain  is  small  and  not  enough  to  offset
29:1083:67392:18:18:71:539:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  accumulated  losses  from  the  months  defending  the  peg.   By  the  end  of  the  year,  the
29:1084:67493:18:18:71:539:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:central bank of a country that went through a currency crisis often records very large losses.
29:1085:67587:18:18:71:532:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Ironically, if the central bank is successful at defending the peg, the losses are even larger.
29:1086:67682:18:18:89:539:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In the other direction, the Swiss National Bank in 2013-15 tried to keep the Swiss franc
29:1087:67770:18:18:71:539:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from appreciating relative to the euro by buying a larger amount of euro reserves.  Towards
29:1088:67861:18:18:71:539:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the end of 2014, it became clear that the exchange rate peg would have to be eventually let
29:1089:67952:18:18:71:539:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:go, especially as the real exchange rate of the Swiss franc was appreciating because the euro
29:1090:68045:18:17:71:539:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:was depreciating relative to the dollar.  Moreover, the holdings of foreign reserves were so
29:1091:68137:17:18:71:539:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:large relative to Switzerland’s GDP that there was no hope of a government recapitalization
29:1092:68228:18:18:71:539:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for when this happened.  The announcement of a further round of quantitative easing by the
29:1093:68318:18:18:71:539:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ECB, which was expected to lead to a further rise inztto defend the peg, led the SNB to
29:1094:68405:18:18:71:442:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:abandon the peg and realize the losses rather than risk its own solvency.
29:1095:68478:18:18:89:539:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:It is therefore not surprising that in many countries the central bank has stronger fiscal
29:1096:68568:18:18:71:539:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:support  when  it  comes  to  its  foreign  reserves  holdings.   Often,  charters  commit  the  fiscal
29:1097:68671:18:18:71:539:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:authority to recapitalize them in case of losses in foreign reserves.  In other countries, the
29:1098:68765:18:18:71:539:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:central  bank  is  an  agent  holding  the  foreign  currency  in  the  name  of  the  fiscal  authority
29:1099:68869:18:18:71:539:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:which  ultimately  own  it  and  bears  any  losses  associated  with  them.   The  central  banks
29:1100:68967:18:18:71:539:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of countries with large foreign reserve holdings and exchange rate pegs can sometimes not
29:1101:69056:18:18:71:539:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:count  the income  risk from these  holdings as part of  their  net  income,  transferring losses
29:1102:69153:18:18:71:539:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:automatically to the fiscal authorities.  Because foreign reserves expose the central bank to
29:1103:69246:18:17:71:539:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:such large income risk, they are brought back into the accounts of the fiscal authorities.  In
29:1104:69340:17:18:71:539:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:this case, the central bank’s actions in managing their portfolio of foreign exchange can add
29:1105:69433:18:46:71:273:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to or diminish the overall fiscal burden.
29:1106:69474:46:29:71:418:160:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:7    Private default risk and rule solvency
29:1107:69517:29:18:71:539:131:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In normal times, the central banks of advanced economies stay away from holding assets that
29:1108:69608:18:0:71:539:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are credits on the private sector.  This is seen as potentially interfering with the allocation of
30:1109:69708:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:credit across sectors in a way that goes beyond the mandate of the central bank.  Yet, many
30:1110:69799:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:central  banks  in  emerging  countries  routinely  do  so,  and  from  2013  onwards  the  Bank  of
30:1111:69899:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Japan started buying large amounts of corporate bonds as part of its QQE (qualitative and
30:1112:69988:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:quantitative easing) policies.  This section considers the risk that buying bonds that may
30:1113:70078:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:default brings to the solvency of the central bank, and thus to its ability to generate fiscal
30:1114:70172:18:39:72:223:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:resources for the government.
30:1115:70201:39:26:72:269:579:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:7.1    Bonds and default risk
30:1116:70230:26:18:72:540:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:I assume that private bonds are denominated in real terms, or alternatively that they are
30:1117:70319:18:18:72:540:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:indexed to inflation.  This is clearly unrealistic but plays only a pedagogical role.  I already
30:1118:70415:18:18:72:540:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:partly considered the effect of inflation on the value of bonds in section 3, and section 8 will
30:1119:70511:18:17:72:540:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:have more to say about government bonds that are assumed to be nominal.  Inflation would
30:1120:70599:17:18:72:540:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:not affect private bonds in a different interesting way than the way it affects government
30:1121:70689:18:18:72:106:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bonds.
30:1122:70695:18:18:89:539:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A bond promises to give one real unit tomorrow in exchange for a real priceqttoday.
30:1123:70778:18:18:72:540:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This promise may be unfulfilled if the bonds defaults, and instead pays a fraction of what
30:1124:70868:18:18:72:539:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:was promised.  With a slight abuse of notation, letδt+1be the repayment rate, as we did for
30:1125:70959:18:18:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:government bonds.  This equals 1 in most states of the world, but it is between 0 and 1 in
30:1126:71049:18:18:72:540:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:some of them.  No arbitrage as usual dictates that the risk-adjusted expected gross return
30:1127:71139:18:18:72:173:356:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on this bond is one:
30:1128:71159:18:26:258:540:338:12:g_d0_f19:12:g_d0_f3:Et[mt,t+1δt+1] =qt.(33)
30:1129:71182:26:18:89:540:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:As before, the central bank issues reservesvt, promises to pay a nominal interest rate on

30:1132:71458:18:18:71:539:258:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:just lead to an extra additive term in net income, which was already dissected in the previous
30:1133:71552:18:17:71:539:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:section.  The novelty is that the central bank buysbtbonds in real terms and collects the
30:1134:71641:17:18:71:539:223:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:repayment  on  the  bonds  it  bought  the  previous  period.   Therefore,  the  law  of  motion  for
30:1135:71742:18:18:71:126:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reserves is:
30:1136:71754:18:26:201:540:187:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f3:vt= (1 +rt)vt−1−st+dt+qtbt−δtbt−1.(34)
30:1137:71792:26:18:89:539:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Finally,  the new no Ponzi scheme condition on reserves again just states that reserves
30:1138:71879:18:33:71:352:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:minus the value of assets cannot be rolled over forever:

31:1142:71967:0:26:72:393:708:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:7.2    Rule solvency and accounting net worth
31:1143:72012:26:18:72:540:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Hall & Reis (2015) first combined the no-Ponzi scheme on reserves with the link to central
31:1144:72102:18:18:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bank independence to come up with a workable definition of central bank solvency.  They
31:1145:72189:18:18:72:540:646:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:interpreted  central  bank  independence  in  terms  of  a  rule  for  the  dividends,  leading  to  a
31:1146:72291:18:18:72:539:628:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:definition ofrule solvency:  a central bank is solvent while it can stay committed to the rule
31:1147:72385:18:18:72:540:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for dividends that is in its charters without reserves exploding.  This definition is explicitly
31:1148:72481:18:18:72:540:592:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:grounded on the key role of fiscal support by emphasizing how the rule for dividends fiscally
31:1149:72574:18:18:72:297:574:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:connects the central bank and the Treasury.
31:1150:72617:18:18:89:539:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Period  solvency,  which  was  studied  in  the  previous  section,  is  a  special  case  of  rule
31:1151:72716:18:17:72:540:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:solvency when the rule is that the central bank dividend can never be negative.  But this
31:1152:72805:17:18:72:540:521:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rule is more general because it can accommodate other cases.  The first rule considered by
31:1153:72895:18:18:72:540:503:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Hall  &  Reis  (2015)  came  from  an  economic  reading  of  most  central  bank  charters:  that
31:1154:72993:18:18:72:540:485:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dividends should be paid as net income.  In that case, as the previous section showed, net
31:1155:73083:18:33:72:319:467:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:worth would be constant.  Reserves would equal:
31:1156:73130:33:33:271:540:434:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f3:vt=qtbt−n0(36)
31:1157:73144:33:18:72:500:401:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:at all dates.  The central bank is solvent, and reserves track the purchases of bonds.
31:1158:73230:18:18:89:539:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:However, while for most central banks the rule is to pay out net income, this is interpreted
31:1159:73322:18:18:72:540:365:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:differently via the accounting rules used to calculate net income.  Most central banks differ
31:1160:73415:18:17:72:540:347:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in their accounting from a proper economic measure of net worth.  First, they count their
31:1161:73504:17:18:72:540:330:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:output of banknotes as a liability.  Second they measure net worth in nominal, rather than
31:1162:73594:18:33:72:423:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:real terms.  Therefore, accounting nominal net worth is measured as:
31:1163:73662:33:33:245:540:279:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f3:Wt=pt(qtbt−vt)−Ht.(37)
31:1164:73684:33:18:89:539:246:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:As a result, the rule that tells the central bank to keep its net worth constant over time
31:1165:73774:18:36:72:501:228:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(Wt=Wt−1) leads to a dividend payment equal to net income that is calculated as:

31:1178:73903:35:18:89:539:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The first difference relative to before is that seignorage disappears.  Because banknotes
31:1179:73992:18:18:71:539:139:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are recorded as a liability, printing and selling them is not counted as a revenue.  Of course,
31:1180:74087:18:18:71:539:121:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:this accounting definition does not change the reality that there is a seignorage revenue, but
31:1181:74181:18:31:71:539:103:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:it simply allows the central bank to keep this revenue instead of distributing it to the fiscal

32:1183:74278:0:18:72:130:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:authorities.
32:1184:74290:18:18:89:539:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The  second  difference  is  that  it  is  now  the  nominal  return  to  net  worth  that  raises
32:1185:74388:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dividends.  Because the nominal interest rate is always positive, this return is always positive.
32:1186:74485:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The reason is that by calculating net income in terms of nominal accounting net worth, the
32:1187:74575:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:calculation  suffers  from  a  version  of  money  illusion.   For  a  fixed  real  interest  rate,  higher
32:1188:74682:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:inflation raises the real dividend that gets paid.  With these accounting rules, if the central
32:1189:74777:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bank  holds  no  risky  assets,  then  its  dividend  is  sure  to  be  always  positive,  so  it  is  never
32:1190:74885:18:18:72:157:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:period insolvent.
32:1191:74902:18:18:89:539:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:With  a  bond,  or  other  risky  assets,  income  might  be  negative.   The  last  term  in  the
32:1192:75000:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:expression  is  zero  under  risk-adjusted  expectations  on  average,  which  means  that  in  the
32:1193:75099:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:states when the bond pays in full, the central bank will earn a small positive revenue on its
32:1194:75192:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:assets.  But, when it defaults, there will be a loss, which is larger the smaller the repayment
32:1195:75287:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rate and the larger is the price of the bond (for instance because default was less likely).
32:1196:75379:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:If the rule for fiscal transfers is still the max rule, then declines in central bank net worth
32:1197:75474:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:will measure the extent of the recapitalization that the central bank needs.  Private default
32:1198:75567:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:therefore ends up affecting central bank solvency and the impact of central bank actions on
32:1199:75658:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fiscal  burden  in  a  similar  way  as  exchange-rate  risk:  both  can  lead  to  fluctuations  in  net
32:1200:75763:18:18:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:income and in the regular remittances to the fiscal authorities which, if large enough, can
32:1201:75854:18:39:72:232:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:trigger central bank insolvency.
32:1202:75886:39:26:72:351:346:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:7.3    Provisioning and the fiscal burden
32:1203:75927:26:18:72:540:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Many central banks have the ability to retain earnings as provisions against future losses on
32:1204:76020:18:18:72:540:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:risky assets.  This consists of holding on to positive net income, instead of distributing it as
32:1205:76116:18:18:72:540:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a dividend, so it can be offset against future negative net income.  Provisioning raises the net
32:1206:76212:18:17:72:540:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:worth of the central bank, so that when losses happen, then net worth can fall back without
32:1207:76303:17:18:72:540:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:leading to insolvency of the central bank.  For instance, the ECB statute allows it to build
32:1208:76395:18:18:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a “risk provision” and a “general reserve” by retaining profits up to 100% of the statutory
32:1209:76486:18:18:72:110:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:capital.
32:1210:76494:18:18:89:539:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:By focusing on net worth, provisioning may at first seem peculiar since net worth should
32:1211:76582:18:18:72:540:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:not  be  a  relevant  concept  for  a  public  agency.   Yet,  for  an  independent  public  body  that
32:1212:76685:18:18:72:540:159:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:issues its own liabilities like the central bank, provisioning is a sensible way to accommodate
32:1213:76780:18:18:72:540:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:future income losses from investments in risky private assets, without needing future recapi-
32:1214:76873:18:18:72:540:123:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:talizations from the fiscal authority.  That is, provisioning is a form to relax the institutional
32:1215:76971:18:0:72:498:105:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:independence constraint on{dt+j}and in doing so prevent central bank insolvency.
33:1216:77053:0:18:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Returning to the fiscal burden, including both foreign reserves and bond holdings, the
33:1217:77139:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:present value of dividends from the central bank to the fiscal authority is still just equal to
33:1218:77234:18:39:72:534:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the net liabilities of the central bank.  Therefore, combining the resource constraints gives:

33:1228:77570:18:18:71:539:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:central  bank  does  not  choose  any  of  the  variables  on  the  right-hand-side,  so  none  of  its

33:1230:77730:18:33:89:274:520:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:As for past actions, we can re-write:

33:1232:77839:32:18:71:539:455:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:By issuing liabilities (reserves) to hold assets (foreign and private) the central bank has a

33:1234:78015:18:18:71:539:419:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f18:government and which it can use to pay down some of its debt.  Therefore,  a highernt−1
33:1235:78102:18:18:71:201:401:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reduces the fiscal burden.
33:1236:78128:18:18:89:539:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Yet, the discussion in this section and the previous one emphasized two properties of net
33:1237:78217:18:18:71:539:365:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:worth that severely limit its ability to relax the fiscal burden.  First, in theory, for a central
33:1238:78315:18:18:71:539:347:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bank that follows a net income rule to pay its dividends, net worth is constant over time.
33:1239:78405:18:18:71:539:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Thus,nt=n0and since the initial net worth was given to the central bank by the fiscal
33:1240:78490:18:18:71:539:311:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:authority, it will have added to the fiscal burden then.  The intertemporal effect is therefore
33:1241:78585:18:18:71:539:293:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:neutral.   Second,  in  practice,  the  net  worth  of  most  central  banks  is  quite  small  at  most
33:1242:78689:18:18:71:539:275:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dates,  and  two  orders  of  magnitude  smaller  than  the  public  debt,  so  this  effect  is  for  all
33:1243:78795:18:17:71:246:257:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:purposes quantitatively irrelevant.
33:1244:78830:17:18:89:539:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The remaining terms on the right-hand side of the equation above are all zero in risk-
33:1245:78916:18:18:71:539:222:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:adjusted expectation.  This is a more general lesson that applies to risky investment by the
33:1246:79008:18:18:71:539:204:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:central bank:  the central bank does not earn excess returns.  Therefore, holdings of private
33:1247:79101:18:18:71:539:186:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:assets  by  the  central  bank  does  not  lead  to  a  reduction  of  the  fiscal  burden  of  the  fiscal
33:1248:79208:18:18:71:539:168:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:authorities.  Some periods, the central bank will return a positive income beyond seignorage,
33:1249:79301:18:18:71:539:150:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:some periods it will require a recapitalization.  On average these will be zero, and if the fiscal
33:1250:79399:18:18:71:539:132:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:authority only receives the positive income and refuses to proceed with the recapitalizations,
33:1251:79493:18:0:71:539:114:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:then the central bank will become insolvent.  The balance sheet of the central bank is only

34:1255:79722:30:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Continuing to consider default,  I now turn attention to public nominal bonds.  These are
34:1256:79811:18:18:72:540:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:interesting  and  distinct  from  the  previous  discussion  for  two  reasons.   First,  because  the
34:1257:79913:18:18:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:central bank is a branch of the government, so issuing new public liabilities (reserves) to buy
34:1258:80008:18:18:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:old public liabilities (government bonds) is a purely intra-governmental transaction.  Second,
34:1259:80102:18:18:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:because sovereign default leads to a transfer from one branch of the government to the other.

34:1297:81347:18:18:71:539:137:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equal to zero.  The intuition is that in this case reserves and government bonds have identical
34:1298:81442:18:18:71:539:119:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:payoffs in the model:  they are both denominated in nominal terms, and they both pay one
34:1299:81530:18:29:71:539:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nominal unit next period.  In this case, the size of the balance sheet of the central bank is

35:1301:81625:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:irrelevant to its own net income.  Liabilities and assets are perfectly matched in payoffs and
35:1302:81719:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:maturity, so that any returns earned from the government bonds are immediately paid to
35:1303:81805:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the reserve holders.  This case roughly matches the experience of the U.S. Federal Reserve
35:1304:81895:18:18:72:339:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:over the fifty years before the 2007-8 financial crisis.
35:1305:81951:18:18:89:539:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This neutrality extends beyond the central bank balance sheet and applies to all variables
35:1306:82041:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in  most  monetary  equilibrium  models  (Wallace,  1981;  Benigno  &  Nistico,  2015).   When
35:1307:82135:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the central bank issues reserves and buys government bonds, it is substituting one type of
35:1308:82225:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:government liability for another.  Because the two have exactly the same payoff, they make
35:1309:82315:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:no difference to any choice or constraint of anyone in the economy. Conventional open market
35:1310:82407:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:operations by central banks, where they issue reserves to buy short-term government bonds,
35:1311:82497:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are neutral because they simply change the composition of the overall government liabilities
35:1312:82589:18:18:72:234:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:between two identical elements.
35:1313:82620:18:18:89:539:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In reality, there are two important distinctions between reserves and short-term govern-
35:1314:82708:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ment bonds that lead to non-neutralities.  First, reserves tend to be overnight, whereas the
35:1315:82800:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:more liquid government bonds traded in most countries are typically of maturities of at least
35:1316:82893:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a  few  months.   Therefore,  there  is  some,  even  if  short,  maturity  mismatch  in  the  central
35:1317:82995:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bank’s balance sheet which on the one hand makes the central bank affect real outcomes by
35:1318:83084:18:18:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:engaging in maturity transformation but on the other hand expose it to interest-rate risk
35:1319:83173:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(Greenwood et al., 2016).  This will be the topic of the next section.  Second, reserves can
35:1320:83265:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:only be held by banks, whereas government bonds are widely traded.  This segmentation of
35:1321:83353:18:18:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the two markets may break the no-arbitrage condition linking their returns, especially during
35:1322:83446:18:18:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:times of financial crisis when, by holding reserves, banks maybe able to relax liquidity and
35:1323:83538:18:39:72:253:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:collateral constraints (Reis, 2016b).

35:1336:83871:41:18:72:540:151:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Buying government bonds changes only the left-hand side.  Wallace neutrality can also be
35:1337:83959:18:18:72:540:133:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:seen  here:  with  no  default,  then  any  expansion  in  reserves  comes  by  buying  government
35:1338:84057:18:43:72:540:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bonds, which therefore reduces the bonds being held by the private sector.  The left-hand
35:1339:84146:43:0:300:312:72:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:33
36:1340:84148:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:side is completely unchanged by this change, and thus the fiscal burden is unchanged as well.
36:1341:84241:18:18:89:539:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:With sovereign default though, there is a clear difference.  The reason is that reserves are
36:1342:84333:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:default free.  Because they are the unit of account, they are always nominally paid.  When
36:1343:84423:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the central bank buys more sovereign bonds, there is a shift in the composition of the overall
36:1344:84517:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:public debt away from risky-default bonds and towards default-free reserves.  Insofar as the
36:1345:84609:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:government  intended  to  use  default  as  a  way  to  lower  its  fiscal  burden,  then  by  holding
36:1346:84711:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:government bonds, the central bank makes this harder.  To achieve the same real reduction
36:1347:84800:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in the debt burden, the government’s default must be greater in the sense that the recovery
36:1348:84891:18:18:72:539:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rate  on  the  bondsδtis  smaller.   This  all  applies  to  fundamental  default;  if  instead  the
36:1349:84991:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sovereign default is driven by multiplicity of equilibrium, then central bank purchases can
36:1350:85082:18:18:72:371:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:instead make default less likely (Corsetti & Dedola, 2016).
36:1351:85141:18:18:89:539:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In terms of central bank net income,  as equation (42) makes clear,  after the sovereign
36:1352:85229:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:default  the  central  bank  makes  a  loss.   Its  loss  is  the  gain  of  the  fiscal  authority,  and  it
36:1353:85338:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is  exactly  matched  by  a  lower  stream  of  dividends  from  the  former  to  the  latter,  so  that
36:1354:85442:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:this leads to no net reduction in the fiscal burden.  Another redistribution that occurs as a
36:1355:85535:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:result of default and central bank intervention is from the holders of the public debt towards
36:1356:85629:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:banks (Reis, 2016b).  Because only banks can hold reserves,  only they benefit from being
36:1357:85718:18:18:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:immune to sovereign default.  Of course, this redistribution towards banks is perhaps more
36:1358:85808:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:than  offset  by  the  extensive  financial  repression  that  governments  often  adopt  when  they
36:1359:85908:18:45:72:236:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:find themselves in a fiscal crisis.

36:1361:85973:30:18:72:540:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The  Federal  Reserve  holds  almost  entirely  domestic  assets,  issued  or  backed  by  the  U.S.
36:1362:86073:18:18:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Federal government,  and this has been the case for many decades (Toporowski, 2017).  It
36:1363:86161:18:18:72:540:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is exposed to almost no exchange-rate or private default risk.  If the Federal Reserve were
36:1364:86252:18:18:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to hold only short-term Treasuries (as it did until 2008), then the interest paid on reserves
36:1365:86345:18:18:72:540:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:would be almost always precisely offset by the interest earned on the Treasuries bought with
36:1366:86437:18:18:72:540:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:these reserves.  This would result in no change in the fiscal burden of the government and
36:1367:86527:18:18:72:220:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:no risk to the Fed’s solvency.
36:1368:86557:18:17:89:539:166:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:However, through its quantitative easing policies, the Fed increased the average maturity

37:1373:86934:18:18:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2-period bonds.  Extending the analysis to a full array of bonds of arbitrary maturities would
37:1374:87028:18:18:72:481:646:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:just involve keeping track of more involved notation, with little gain in insights.

38:1450:89910:18:18:71:539:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:income is positive,  the balance of the deferred account is first brought to zero before any

39:1500:92236:18:18:71:539:347:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:constraint to define theintertemporal solvencyof the central bank.  As long as the right-hand
39:1501:92329:18:18:71:539:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:side is positive, the central bank is solvent.  This is a weaker requirement than period or rule
39:1502:92425:18:18:71:539:311:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:solvency.  Even if the central bank has periods of negative net income, and even if it deviates
39:1503:92520:18:18:71:539:293:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from some rule, as long as it can use a deferred account then it can smooth out these income
39:1504:92612:18:18:71:539:275:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:shocks by driving its reserves up and down.  As long as the right-hand side of the expression
39:1505:92705:18:17:71:539:257:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:above is positive, it can ensure that it will always pay zero or positive dividends to the fiscal
39:1506:92802:17:46:71:529:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:authority, although this may require at times very large balances in the deferred account.

39:1508:92919:29:18:71:539:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The  fifth  and  final  channel  through  which  central  banks  can  affect  fiscal  burdens  is  by
39:1509:93020:18:18:71:539:147:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:redistributing them across different fiscal authorities.  In public finance, the ability of fiscal
39:1510:93118:18:18:71:539:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:authorities  to  generate  resources  from  taxation  and  then  spend  them  in  different  public
39:1511:93217:18:0:71:539:111:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:projects is as studied as the government’s ability to redistribute a fixed amount of resources
40:1512:93313:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to different groups.  Likewise, a study of the fiscal role of the central bank is not complete
40:1513:93407:18:18:72:505:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:without also discussing the fiscal redistributions that the central bank can engender.
40:1514:93493:18:18:89:539:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:At the same time, such a discussion is limited by two opposing forces.  On the one hand,
40:1515:93581:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:unlike fiscal authorities, central banks have no redistribution mandate, and in fact are often
40:1516:93675:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:explicitly disallowed from actively pursuing redistributive policies.  In fact, one of the main
40:1517:93770:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reasons why central banks are dissuaded from buying risky assets, as in sections 6 and 7, is
40:1518:93862:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the redistribution that they may lead to across the private issuers of these securities.  On
40:1519:93954:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the other hand,anycentral bank action that has some effect on inflation or real activity
40:1520:94042:18:18:71:539:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:will likely have some redistributive effects.  Households and firms are differentially exposed
40:1521:94136:18:18:71:539:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to inflation risk, through the multiple contracts they sign or the portfolios they choose, and
40:1522:94230:18:18:71:331:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:likewise they are hurt differently during recessions.
40:1523:94283:18:18:89:539:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:As a result of these two forces, a more institution-centered discussion of fiscal redistribu-
40:1524:94376:18:18:71:539:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tion by central banks might rule it out from the start, while a more consequentially-driven
40:1525:94467:18:17:71:539:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:one  would  require  a  whole  article  in  itself.   The  compromise  solution  in  this  section  is  to
40:1526:94573:17:18:71:539:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:focus only one one source of risk—public default—and to consider only redistribution across
40:1527:94664:18:39:71:237:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:regions within a currency union.

40:1531:94925:18:18:71:539:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:able to transfer fiscal burdens from one region to another.  This section extends the model

40:1533:95109:18:18:71:539:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:consider only the case of a short-term bond with default risk, although the other sources of

40:1552:95627:18:18:71:539:140:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:could promote unlimited redistribution across areas.  It would just have to setdatto a very

41:1556:95967:18:18:89:539:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Most central banks in advanced countries do not have this discretion.  They must return

41:1558:96146:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:An  exception  is  the  Eurosystem.   There  is  no  single  union-wide  fiscal  authority  to  send
41:1559:96246:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dividends to in the euro zone, and they are instead distributed to the member central banks,
41:1560:96338:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and so effectively to regions.  Each country’s central bank then has its rules of distribution
41:1561:96432:18:18:72:539:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to the fiscal authorities.  Yet, the Eurosystem itself has close tozerodiscretion in choosing
41:1562:96525:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:how  to  distribute  these  dividends  to  each  member  central  bank  and  region.   There  is  a
41:1563:96624:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:strict formula in the founding Treaty stipulating a fixed rule such that each country’s share
41:1564:96717:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of its dividends must equal the average of the country’s population share and GDP share
41:1565:96804:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in the Eurozone,  averaged over the last three years.  Therefore,  there is no scope for this
41:1566:96897:18:18:72:215:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:discretionary redistribution.
41:1567:96926:18:18:89:539:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:There is still discretion though in how the overalldtis calculated,  that is on how net
41:1568:97013:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:income is calculated, which can be subtly manipulated to lead to redistribution. Imagine that
41:1569:97106:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the expected repayment on countrya’s bonds is quite low perhaps because the probability
41:1570:97193:18:18:71:540:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of default is quite high.  As a result, the price of its bondsqatis low as well.  Yet, ex post,
41:1571:97288:18:18:72:539:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:default may not materialize.  In this case, the return on the bondδat/qat−1will ex post turn
41:1572:97380:18:18:72:539:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:out to be well above 1 +rt.  Even if on average the central bank earns no excess returns on
41:1573:97471:18:18:72:408:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:these bonds, for some states of the world the return may be high.
41:1574:97536:18:18:89:539:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In this situation, it may turn out to be politically difficult to justify the high returns by
41:1575:97629:18:18:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the central bank at the expense of a country going through a fiscal crisis and paying a high
41:1576:97721:18:18:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:interest rate on its bonds.  The ECB in 2014 agreed to raise the dividends to Greece above
41:1577:97811:18:18:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:their stipulated key, by including in the Greek dividend all the gains in holding Greek bonds.
41:1578:97905:18:18:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This is a form of redistribution.  If default materializes instead,  the redistribution goes in
41:1579:98000:18:18:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the other direction.  Countryareaps the benefits from not paying its bonds, but the fall in
41:1580:98091:18:18:72:539:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:net income lowers the dividends to both countryaandb.  Ex post, this is a transfer from

41:1586:98554:18:18:72:540:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:partly in this direction from 2015 onwards, when it instituted as a rule for its government

42:1611:99933:18:18:72:540:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and European constitutional courts assessed whether these bond holdings would lead to a
42:1612:100020:18:18:72:540:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:redistribution  contrary  to  the  charter  of  the  ECB.  Equation  (53)  shows  clearly  that  the
42:1613:100120:18:18:72:540:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:answer to  that question depends on a single criteria:  whether  the SMP was a temporary
42:1614:100208:18:18:72:540:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:or permanent program.  In the former case, no redistribution results from it.  In the latter,
42:1615:100301:18:18:72:191:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:redistribution happens.
42:1616:100324:18:17:89:539:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:On the side of reserves, the ECB was also set up to prevent this redistribution.  In the
42:1617:100412:17:18:72:540:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Eurosystem, when one financial institution moves its deposits from the central bank of one
42:1618:100502:18:18:72:540:273:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:country to another, the liabilities to the private sector of the first central bank fall, while
42:1619:100597:18:18:72:540:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the liabilities of the second central bank rise.  Via the TARGET2 system, this transaction
42:1620:100687:18:18:72:540:237:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is  recorded  in  the  Eurosystem  as  a  liability  of  the  first  country  to  the  second.   The  total
42:1621:100794:18:18:72:540:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:liabilities and reserves of each country are unchanged.  The crisis again led to a deviation
42:1622:100886:18:18:72:540:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from this principle.  The ECB allowed the national sovereign banks to give emergency lending
42:1623:100978:18:18:72:540:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:assistance (ELA) around this system.  Banks can get reserves from national central bank,
42:1624:101066:18:18:72:540:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and print euros with the ECB’s authorization.  Again, if this program is temporary, it implies
42:1625:101160:18:18:72:396:147:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:no redistribution.  The no-Ponzi scheme has real economic bite.
42:1626:101223:18:18:89:539:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The bottom line is that there are many channels through which a common central bank
42:1627:101306:18:39:72:540:111:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in a fragmented fiscal union can redistribute resources.  Because the central bank is a fiscal
42:1628:101400:39:0:300:312:72:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:40
43:1629:101402:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:actor,  with  a  resource  constraint  shared  by  all  the  regions,  it  can  be  used  to  voluntarily
43:1630:101507:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:redistribute  resources  across  regions.   Even  if  it  is  not  used  this  way,  it  will  still  lead  to
43:1631:101617:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ex post  involuntary transfers.  This is the inevitable consequence of sharing a  fiscal actor
43:1632:101711:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with a common resource constraint.  Many of the ECB’s rules were designed to prevent this
43:1633:101800:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:redistribution on average, yet its unconventional policies put these rules to the test.  Using
43:1634:101894:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  principles  laid  out  in  this  article,  one  can  measure  and  assess  this  redistribution  in  a
43:1635:102001:18:45:72:152:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:disciplined way.
43:1636:102017:45:30:72:203:555:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:11    Conclusion
43:1637:102033:30:18:72:540:525:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The central bank produces and supplies a public good (banknotes) for which it collects a
43:1638:102121:18:18:72:540:507:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:revenue  (seignorage),  it  affects  the  path  of  a  variable  that  works  as  a  tax  (inflation),  it
43:1639:102227:18:18:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:issues  a  public  liability  (reserves),  it  holds  other  public  liabilities  (government  bonds),  it
43:1640:102333:18:18:72:540:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:provides a stream of dividends to the fiscal authorities that can fluctuate significantly with
43:1641:102427:18:18:72:540:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:income (remmittances), and its policies interact with those of fiscal authorities to determine
43:1642:102521:18:18:72:540:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equilibrium  outcomes  that  affect  tax  revenue  and  public  spending.   From  more  than  one
43:1643:102618:18:17:72:540:417:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:perspective, the central bank is a fiscal agent.  In a broad sense, any study of central banks
43:1644:102712:17:18:72:489:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and monetary policy must therefore consider their interaction with fiscal policies.
43:1645:102795:18:18:89:539:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:There  are  several  surveys  on  how  the  interaction  between  monetary  and  fiscal  policy
43:1646:102890:18:18:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:determines inflation (Sims, 2013; Leeper & Leith, 2016).  This article reviewed a different set
43:1647:102985:18:18:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of results, from a more recent literature, which has explored the monetary-fiscal interactions
43:1648:103079:18:18:72:540:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from the perspective of the resource flows from the central bank to the fiscal authorities.  As
43:1649:103174:18:18:72:540:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:important as highlighting that the central bank is a fiscal agent,  is to understand that it
43:1650:103266:18:18:72:540:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is also subject to a fiscal limit.  This clarifies a few dangerous fantasies that are commonly
43:1651:103360:18:18:72:270:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:stated because they are partly correct.
43:1652:103399:18:18:89:539:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The first one is that “central banks can never go insolvent.” This is partly correct in that
43:1653:103491:18:18:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:there is no legal insolvency procedure for a central bank.  The danger associated with it is
43:1654:103583:18:18:72:540:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that it leads to claims that central banks can always pay for any public spending, and even
43:1655:103674:18:18:72:540:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:if that raises inflation a little, this may be desirable when inflation is below target anyway.
43:1656:103769:18:18:72:540:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:As  this  article  clarified,  central  banks  can  and  do  become  insolvent,  not  in  a  legal  sense,
43:1657:103875:18:17:72:540:166:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:but in an economic sense.  This happens whenever the central bank does not have support
43:1658:103962:17:18:72:540:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from the fiscal authorities to cover its losses, and the reserves outstanding are no longer fully
43:1659:104059:18:18:72:540:131:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:covered by its assets and the stream of income that it can retain post remittances to the
43:1660:104148:18:0:72:540:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fiscal authority.  When this happens, banks no longer wish to roll over reserves at the central
44:1661:104245:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bank,  their  value  falls  to  zero,  so  hyperinflation  and  currency  reform  result.   The  central
44:1662:104349:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bank is insolvent in the economic sense that no one accepts its liabilities,  and their value
44:1663:104442:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:must be written down.  This paper discussed how the extent of fiscal support conceptually
44:1664:104531:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:leads to different forms of insolvency (period, rule and intertemporal) and how in practice
44:1665:104622:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:different asset holdings some with different forms of income risk that may put solvency in
44:1666:104712:18:18:72:118:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:question.
44:1667:104721:18:18:89:539:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The second fantasy is that “a country that prints its own money can never have a sovereign
44:1668:104811:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:debt crisis.” This is partly correct because the central bank can issue default-free reserves or
44:1669:104907:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:banknotes to buy government bonds.  But this statement is dangerous and not quite right
44:1670:104994:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for many reasons linked to different conclusions in this article.  First, as we saw in section 5,
44:1671:105091:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:printing currency does not prevent central bank insolvency.  Second, the actual real revenues
44:1672:105184:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from printing currency are quite small, as discussed in section 4.  Third, as emphasized in
44:1673:105275:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:section  2,  printing  money  raises  inflation,  which  increases  the  interest  rate  that  nominal
44:1674:105377:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:government bonds must pay.  A country with a central bank may be able to commit to never
44:1675:105465:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:default, but if this comes with expected high inflation, the interest rates on its government
44:1676:105558:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bonds will be just as large.  Fourth,  we saw that it is not enough to generate inflation to
44:1677:105650:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:devalue the debt:  in a fiscal crisis where the maturity of the debt usually becomes very low,
44:1678:105744:18:18:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:this  must  be  done  so  suddenly  as  to  make  it  almost  infeasible  without  hyperinflation,  as
44:1679:105846:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:discussed  in  section  3.   Finally,  as  section  8  discussed,  if  to  prevent  sovereign  default  the
44:1680:105953:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:central bank buys most of the government bonds this will just lead the default to happen
44:1681:106041:18:18:72:341:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:through central bank insolvency, or currency reform.
44:1682:106093:18:18:89:539:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The third claim is that the central bank can freely redistribute across regions.  The ECB’s
44:1683:106184:18:18:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:misguided choices are then blamed for not doing more to help Greece during its debt crisis
44:1684:106274:18:18:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:post-2010.  Section 10 shows that indeed the central bank can redistribute across regions in
44:1685:106366:18:18:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a currency union.  But, the institutional design of the ECB (and the Federal Reserve or the
44:1686:106457:18:18:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Bank of England) make these extremely difficult without breaking the legal mandate of the
44:1687:106546:18:17:72:139:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:central bank.
44:1688:106559:17:18:89:539:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The overall point of this paper is not to say that central banks can not play a role in
44:1689:106646:18:18:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a fiscal crisis.  Neither is it to argue that monetary policy cannot constrain fiscal policy in
44:1690:106741:18:18:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:many ways.  Rather, it was to analyze the resource flows between the central bank and the
44:1691:106830:18:18:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fiscal  authorities.   From  that  analysis  comes  the  conclusion  that  these  resource  flows  are
44:1692:106932:18:0:72:280:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:typically small and do not come for free.
