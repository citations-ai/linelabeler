2:31:1531:28:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:We estimate the monetary return to attending a highly selective college using the College and Beyond
2:32:1631:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:(C&B) Survey linked to Detailed Earnings Records from the Social Security Administration (SSA).
2:33:1726:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:This paper extends earlier work by Dale and Krueger (2002) that examined the relationship between
2:34:1823:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:the college that students attended in 1976 and the earnings they self-reported reported in 1995 on the
2:35:1925:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:C&B follow-up survey. In this analysis, we use administrative earnings data to estimate the return
2:36:2023:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:to various measures of college selectivity for a more recent cohort of students: those who entered college
2:37:2129:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:in 1989. We also estimate the return to college selectivity for the 1976 cohort of students, but over
2:38:2230:14:28:72:430:476:12:Times:12:Times:a longer time horizon (from 1983 through 2007) using administrative data.
2:39:2303:28:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:We find that the return to college selectivity is sizeable for both cohorts in regression models that control
2:40:2412:14:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:for variables commonly observed by researchers, such as student high school GPA and SAT scores.
2:41:2507:14:14:72:540:420:12:Times:12:Times:However, when we adjust for unobserved student ability by controlling for the average SAT score
2:42:2602:14:14:72:540:406:12:Times:12:Times:of the colleges that students applied to, our estimates of the return to college selectivity fall substantially
2:43:2713:14:14:72:540:392:12:Times:12:Times:and are generally indistinguishable from zero. There were notable exceptions for certain subgroups.
2:44:2812:14:14:72:540:378:12:Times:12:Times:For black and Hispanic students and for students who come from less-educated families (in terms of
2:45:2910:14:14:72:540:364:12:Times:12:Times:their parents’ education), the estimates of the return to college selectivity remain large, even in models
2:46:3016:14:42:72:309:350:12:Times:12:Times:that adjust for unobserved student characteristics.

3:59:3297:0:13:72:188:708:144:Times:144:Times:I.     INTRODUCTION 
3:60:3316:13:28:72:75:695:144:Times:144:Times: 
3:61:3316:28:27:108:526:667:144:Times:144:Times:Understanding the labor market return to college quality is crucial for parents deciding 
3:62:3405:27:28:72:517:640:144:Times:144:Times:where to send their children to college, for colleges selecting students, and for policymakers 
3:63:3500:28:27:71:540:612:144:Times:144:Times:deciding whether to invest additional resources in higher quality institutions. However, obtaining 
3:64:3599:27:28:71:542:585:144:Times:144:Times:unbiased estimates of the return to college quality is difficult due to unobserved characteristics that 
3:65:3703:28:28:71:501:557:144:Times:144:Times:affect both a student’s attendance at a highly selective college and their later earnings. In 
3:66:3797:28:27:71:507:529:144:Times:144:Times:particular, the same characteristics (such as ambition) that lead students to apply to highly 
3:67:3891:27:28:71:500:502:144:Times:144:Times:selective colleges may also be rewarded in the labor market. Likewise, the attributes that 
3:68:3982:28:28:71:517:474:144:Times:144:Times:admissions officers are looking for when selecting students for college may be similar to the 
3:69:4076:28:27:71:439:446:144:Times:144:Times:attributes that employers are seeking when hiring and promoting workers.     
3:70:4152:27:28:107:505:419:144:Times:144:Times:Early research attempted to overcome this omitted-variable bias by controlling for 
3:71:4235:28:27:71:542:391:144:Times:144:Times:observed student characteristics, such as high school grades, standardized test scores, and parental 
3:72:4336:27:28:71:511:364:144:Times:144:Times:background (see, for example, Monks 2000 and Brewer and Ehrenberg 1996). More recent 
3:73:4421:28:28:71:516:336:144:Times:144:Times:research has tried to overcome the bias created by unobserved variables through a variety of 
3:74:4514:28:27:71:538:308:144:Times:144:Times:techniques. Hoekstra (2009) uses a regression discontinuity design that compares the earnings of 
3:75:4611:27:28:71:530:281:144:Times:144:Times:students who were just above the admissions cutoff for a state university to those that were just 
3:76:4709:28:27:71:541:253:144:Times:144:Times:below it. He finds that attending the flagship state university results in 20 percent higher earnings 
3:77:4811:27:28:71:542:226:144:Times:144:Times:five to ten years after graduation for white men, but he does not find an effect on earnings for white 
3:78:4914:28:28:71:542:198:144:Times:144:Times:women. Lindahl and Regner (2005) use sibling data to illustrate that the returns to college quality 
3:79:5014:28:27:71:542:170:144:Times:144:Times:might be overstated if family characteristics are not fully adjusted for, as cross-sectional estimates 
3:80:5117:27:28:71:535:143:144:Times:144:Times:of the return-to-schooling are twice as large as within-family estimates. Black and Smith (2004) 
3:81:5214:28:27:71:528:115:144:Times:144:Times:use propensity score methods to estimates to estimate the return to college quality for the 1979 
3:82:5311:27:0:71:517:88:144:Times:144:Times:cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. The magnitude of the effect of college 
4:83:5405:0:28:72:526:709:144:Times:144:Times:quality is similar whether they use OLS or propensity score methods, however, when they use 
4:84:5497:28:27:72:515:681:144:Times:144:Times:propensity score methods, the standard errors are large so the effect of college quality is not 
4:85:5593:27:28:72:524:654:144:Times:144:Times:statistically significant. Dale and Krueger (2002) hold unobserved student quality constant by 
4:86:5688:28:28:72:542:626:144:Times:144:Times:controlling for the selectivity of colleges that students apply to and are accepted or rejected by, and 
4:87:5792:28:27:72:541:598:144:Times:144:Times:find that the return to a variety of college characteristics falls substantially after implementing their 
4:88:5898:27:28:71:173:571:144:Times:144:Times:selection-correction. 
4:89:5920:28:28:107:536:543:144:Times:144:Times:To reconcile the findings across methods and data sources, Long (2008) re-estimated the 
4:90:6008:28:27:71:514:515:144:Times:144:Times:models used by Dale and Krueger (2002) and Black and Smith (2004); he also estimated an 
4:91:6096:27:28:71:539:488:144:Times:144:Times:ordinary least squared (OLS) model that controlled for student attributes, family background and 
4:92:6193:28:27:71:535:460:144:Times:144:Times:neighborhood characteristics, as well as an instrumental variables model that used the quality of 
4:93:6291:27:28:71:542:433:144:Times:144:Times:colleges located within a certain radius of the student’s home as an instrument for the quality of the 
4:94:6394:28:28:71:539:405:144:Times:144:Times:college that the student attends. In general, he found that a variety of college characteristics have 
4:95:6496:28:27:71:542:377:144:Times:144:Times:positive effects on educational attainment, even within specifications t hat adjust for selection bias; 
4:96:6600:27:28:71:482:350:144:Times:144:Times:however, there is  not consistent evidence for a positive relationship between college 
4:97:6687:28:27:71:392:322:144:Times:144:Times:characteristics and earnings across the selection adjusted models.   
4:98:6756:27:28:107:542:295:144:Times:144:Times:Because the percentage of students enrolling in college has increased over time, one might 
4:99:6847:28:28:71:529:267:144:Times:144:Times:expect that it would be more important for students who entered college recently to distinguish 
4:100:6943:28:139:71:310:239:144:Times:65:Times:themselves by attending more selective colleges.1
4:101:6992:139:8:216:218:100:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:                                                           
4:102:7050:8:18:72:524:92:65:Times:99:Times:1  For example, the percentage of 18 to 24-year olds enrolling in college increased from 26 percent in 1975 to 32 
4:103:7164:18:0:71:236:74:99:Times:99:Times:percent in 1990 (Fox and Snyder, 2005). 
4:104:7204:0:28:310:534:240:144:Times:144:Times:  However, little research has examined recent 
4:105:7251:28:28:72:529:212:144:Times:144:Times:cohorts, and those studies that do use recent cohorts tend to model earnings early in the career. 
4:106:7349:28:27:72:543:184:144:Times:144:Times:Long (2008 and 2009), for example, used the 1992 cohort of the National Education Longitudinal 
4:107:7444:27:28:72:543:157:144:Times:144:Times:Study (NELS) to examine the earnings of students relatively early in their careers, when they were 
4:108:7543:28:0:71:160:129:144:Times:144:Times:only 26 years old. 
5:109:7564:0:28:108:540:709:144:Times:144:Times:This paper replicates and extends earlier work that examined the relationship between the 
5:110:7654:28:27:72:543:681:144:Times:144:Times:college that students attended in 1976 and the earnings they reported in 1995 in the C&B follow-up 
5:111:7753:27:28:72:543:654:144:Times:144:Times:survey (Dale and Krueger 2002) in important respects. First, we estimate the return several college 
5:112:7853:28:28:71:542:626:144:Times:144:Times:characteristics that are commonly used as proxies for college quality (college average SAT score, 
5:113:7951:28:27:71:539:598:144:Times:144:Times:the Barron’s index, and net tuition) for a recent cohort of students—those who entered college in 
5:114:8049:27:28:71:542:571:144:Times:144:Times:1989. By linking the C&B data to administrative records from the Social Security Administration 
5:115:8145:28:28:71:542:543:144:Times:144:Times:(SSA), we are able to follow this cohort for 18 years after the students entered (and 14 years after 
5:116:8246:28:27:71:506:515:144:Times:144:Times:they likely would have graduated from) college. Second, we estimate the return to college 
5:117:8336:27:28:71:537:488:144:Times:144:Times:characteristics for the 1976 cohort over a long time horizon, from 1983 to 2007. Because we use 
5:118:8432:28:27:71:537:460:144:Times:144:Times:administrative earnings records from tax data, our earnings measure is presumably more reliable 
5:119:8528:27:28:71:532:433:144:Times:144:Times:than much of the prior literature, which is generally based on self-reported earnings. The use of 
5:120:8626:28:28:72:542:405:144:Times:144:Times:administrative earnings data allows us to follow a recent cohort of students over a longer period of 
5:121:8727:28:27:72:523:377:144:Times:144:Times:time than is possible in many of the longitudinal databases that are typically used to study the 
5:122:8824:27:28:72:517:350:144:Times:144:Times:returns to college characteristics. For example, the NELS, High School and Beyond, and the 
5:123:8915:28:27:72:530:322:144:Times:144:Times:National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 only follow students for 6 to 10 
5:124:9009:27:28:72:531:295:144:Times:144:Times:years after students would have likely graduated from college; while the National Longitudinal 
5:125:9104:28:28:72:531:267:144:Times:144:Times:Study of Youth (NLSY) follows students for a long period of time, students from the relatively 
5:126:9199:28:27:72:543:239:144:Times:144:Times:recent cohort (who were age 12 to 16 in 1997) are now too early in their post-collegiate careers to 
5:127:9299:27:28:72:398:212:144:Times:144:Times:generate accurate estimates of the return to college characteristics.   
5:128:9371:28:27:108:522:184:144:Times:144:Times:  As in the rest of the literature, we find that the return to each college characteristic is 
5:129:9465:27:28:72:508:157:144:Times:144:Times:sizeable for both cohorts in cross-sectional least squares regression models that control for 
5:130:9559:28:28:72:528:129:144:Times:144:Times:variables commonly observed by researchers (such as student characteristics and SAT scores). 
5:131:9652:28:0:72:505:101:144:Times:144:Times:However, when we adjust for a proxy for unobserved student characteristics – namely, by 
6:132:9742:0:28:72:535:709:144:Times:144:Times:controlling for the average SAT score of the colleges that students applied to – our estimates for 
6:133:9841:28:27:71:543:681:144:Times:144:Times:the return to college characteristics fall substantially and are generally indistinguishable from zero 
6:134:9943:27:28:72:509:654:144:Times:144:Times:for both the 1976 and 1989 cohort of students. Notable exceptions are for racial and ethnic 
6:135:10035:28:28:71:518:626:144:Times:144:Times:minorities (black and Hispanic students) and for students whose parents have relatively little 
6:136:10130:28:27:71:502:598:144:Times:144:Times:education; for these subgroups, our estimates remain large, even in models that adjust for 
6:137:10221:27:28:71:519:571:144:Times:144:Times:unobserved student characteristics. One possible explanation for this pattern of results is that 
6:138:10318:28:28:71:534:543:144:Times:144:Times:highly selective colleges provide access to networks for minority students and for students from 
6:139:10415:28:27:71:447:515:144:Times:144:Times:disadvantaged family backgrounds that are otherwise not available to them.

6:143:10503:27:28:107:537:419:144:Times:144:Times: The college application process involves a series of choices. First, students choose where to 
6:144:10597:28:27:71:518:391:144:Times:144:Times:apply to college. Then, colleges decide which students to admit. Finally, students  choose which 
6:145:10694:27:28:71:523:364:144:Times:144:Times:college to attend from among the set of schools to which they were admitted. The difficulty with 
6:146:10791:28:28:71:521:336:144:Times:144:Times:estimating the labor market return to college quality is that not all of the characteristics that lead 
6:147:10894:28:27:71:542:308:144:Times:144:Times:students to apply to and attend selective colleges are observed by researchers, and unobserved student 
6:148:10997:27:28:71:492:281:144:Times:144:Times:characteristics are likely to be positively correlated with both school quality and earnings. 
6:149:11091:28:29:107:441:253:144:Times:144:Times:     We assume the equation relating earnings to the students' attributes is:  
6:150:11169:29:38:71:279:224:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:(1)          ln  Wi = β0 + β1Qi + β2X1i + β3X2i + εi, 
6:151:11223:38:29:72:544:186:144:Times:144:Times:where Q is a measure of the selectivity of the college student i attended, X1 and X2 are two sets of 
6:152:11324:29:29:72:543:157:144:Times:144:Times:characteristics that affect earnings, and εi is an idiosyncratic error term that is uncorrelated with the 
6:153:11430:29:27:72:544:128:144:Times:144:Times:other explanatory  variables  (1).    X1 includes  variables  that  are  observable  to  researchers,  such  as  
6:154:11543:27:0:72:543:101:144:Times:144:Times:grades  and  SAT  scores,  while  X2 includes  variables  that  are  not  observable  to  researchers,  such  as  
7:155:11659:0:28:72:544:709:144:Times:144:Times:student  motivation  and  creativity  (that  are  at  least  partly  revealed  to  admissions  officers  through  
7:156:11773:28:27:72:543:681:144:Times:144:Times:detailed  transcript  information,  essays,  interviews,  and  recommendations).    Both X1  and  X2 affect 
7:157:11881:27:29:72:543:654:144:Times:144:Times:the set of colleges that students apply to, whether they are admitted, and possibly which school they 
7:158:11983:29:39:72:522:625:144:Times:144:Times:attend. The parameter β1 represents the monetary payoff to attending a more selective college.    
7:159:12080:39:28:108:548:586:144:Times:144:Times: In the early literature on the returns to school quality, researchers estimated   a wage equation 
7:160:12178:28:38:72:149:558:144:Times:144:Times:that omitted X2: 
7:161:12195:38:30:72:239:520:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:(2)    ln Wi = β'0 + β'1 Qi + β'2X1i + ui. 
7:162:12238:30:14:72:75:490:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: 
7:163:12238:14:27:72:539:476:144:Times:144:Times:Qi is typically measured by the average SAT score of the school where the student attended college. 
7:164:12338:27:29:72:539:449:144:Times:144:Times:Even if students randomly select the college they attend from the set of colleges that admitted them, 
7:165:12440:29:29:71:518:420:144:Times:144:Times:estimation of (2) will yield biased and inconsistent parameter estimates of β1 and β2. If students 
7:166:12538:29:28:72:543:391:144:Times:144:Times:choose their school randomly from their set of options, the payoff to attending a selective school will 
7:167:12642:28:27:72:545:363:144:Times:144:Times:be biased upward because students with higher values of the omitted variable, X2, are more likely to  
7:168:12743:27:28:72:539:336:144:Times:144:Times:be admitted to and therefore attend highly selective schools. Since the labor market rewards X2, and 
7:169:12844:28:38:72:506:308:144:Times:144:Times:Q and X2 are positively correlated, the coefficient on school quality will be biased upward.    
7:170:12939:38:27:108:542:270:144:Times:144:Times: To address the selection problem, we use one of the selection-adjusted models—referred to as 
7:171:13032:27:28:72:533:243:144:Times:144:Times:the “self-revelation model”--    in Dale and Krueger (2002). This model assumes  that students signal 
7:172:13133:28:27:72:542:215:144:Times:144:Times:their potential ability, motivation and ambition by the choice of schools they apply to. If students with 
7:173:13239:27:28:72:532:188:144:Times:144:Times:greater unobserved earnings potential are more likely to apply to more selective colleges, the error 
7:174:13340:28:27:72:541:160:144:Times:144:Times:term in equation (2) could be modeled as a function of the average SAT score (denoted AVG) of the 
7:175:13438:27:28:71:543:133:144:Times:144:Times:schools to which the student applied:   ui = t0 + t1AVGi + vi.      If vi is uncorrelated with the SAT score 
7:176:13547:28:28:71:542:105:144:Times:144:Times:of the school the student attended, one can solve the selection problem by including AVG in the wage 
7:177:13648:28:0:71:506:77:144:Times:144:Times:equation. This approach is called the "self-revelation" model because individuals reveal their 
8:178:13745:0:28:72:544:709:144:Times:144:Times:unobserved ability by their college application behavior. This model also includes  dummy variables 
8:179:13845:28:27:71:540:681:144:Times:144:Times:indicating the number of schools the students applied to (in addition to the average SAT score of the 
8:180:13947:27:28:71:535:654:144:Times:144:Times:schools), because the number of applications a student submits may also reveal unobserved student 
8:181:14045:28:38:71:283:626:144:Times:144:Times:traits, such as their ambition and persistence. 
8:182:14092:38:27:107:501:588:144:Times:144:Times: Dale and Krueger (2002) also estimated a matched applicant model that included an 
8:183:14174:27:28:71:542:561:144:Times:144:Times:unrestricted set of dummy variables indicating groups of students who received the same admissions 
8:184:14273:28:27:71:531:533:144:Times:144:Times:decisions (i.e., the same combination of acceptances and rejections) from the same set of colleges. 
8:185:14372:27:28:71:533:506:144:Times:144:Times:The self-revelation model is a special case of the matched applicant model. The matched applicant 
8:186:14470:28:28:71:541:478:144:Times:144:Times:model and self-revelation model yielded coefficients that were similar in size, but the self-revelation 
8:187:14574:28:27:71:534:450:144:Times:144:Times:model yielded smaller standard errors.   Because of the smaller sample size in the present analysis, 
8:188:14675:27:38:71:302:423:144:Times:144:Times:we therefore focus on the self-revelation model.  
8:189:14724:38:27:112:495:385:144:Times:144:Times:  As discussed in more detail Dale and Krueger (2002), a critical assumption of the 
8:190:14806:27:29:71:528:358:144:Times:144:Times:self-revelation model is that students' enrollment decisions are uncorrelated with the error term of 
8:191:14907:29:29:71:539:329:144:Times:144:Times:equation (2) and X2. Our selection correction provides an unbiased estimate of β1 if students' school 
8:192:15008:29:28:72:536:300:144:Times:144:Times:enrollment decisions are a function of X1 or any variable outside the model. However, it is possible 
8:193:15109:28:27:72:547:272:144:Times:144:Times:that student matriculation decisions are correlated with X2. For example, p  ast studies have found that 
8:194:15214:27:28:71:542:245:144:Times:144:Times:students are more likely to matriculate to schools that provide them with more generous financial aid 
8:195:15316:28:27:71:534:217:144:Times:144:Times:packages (see, e.g., van der Klaauw [1997]). If more selective colleges provide more merit aid, the 
8:196:15416:27:28:71:539:190:144:Times:144:Times:estimated effect of attending an elite college will be biased upward because relatively more students 
8:197:15518:28:28:71:530:162:144:Times:144:Times:with higher values of X2 will matriculate at elite colleges, even conditional on the outcomes of the 
8:198:15619:28:27:72:519:134:144:Times:144:Times:applications to other colleges. If this is the case, our selection-adjusted estimates of the effect of 
8:199:15722:27:28:71:525:107:144:Times:144:Times:college quality will be biased upward. However, if less selective colleges provide more generous 
8:200:15819:28:0:71:525:79:144:Times:144:Times:merit aid (leading students with higher values of X2 to attend less selective schools), the estimate 
9:201:15922:0:28:72:502:709:144:Times:144:Times:could be biased downward. More generally, our adjusted estimate would be biased upwards 
9:202:16010:28:27:72:539:681:144:Times:144:Times:(downwards) if students with high unobserved earnings potential are more (less) likely to attend the 
9:203:16111:27:28:72:391:654:144:Times:144:Times:more selective schools from the set of schools that admitted them.    
9:204:16180:28:29:108:526:626:144:Times:144:Times:Finally, it is possible that the effect of attending a highly selective school varies across 
9:205:16273:29:29:72:535:597:144:Times:144:Times:individuals (that is, β1 could have an “i” subscript), and students might sort among selective and 
9:206:16372:29:27:71:542:568:144:Times:144:Times:less selective colleges based on their potential returns at that college. In such a model, our estimate 
9:207:16476:27:29:72:539:541:144:Times:144:Times:of the return to attending a selective school can be biased upward or downward, and it would not 
9:208:16573:29:29:72:542:512:144:Times:144:Times:be appropriate to interpret an estimate of β1 as a causal effect for the average student. We explore 
9:209:16674:29:28:72:278:483:144:Times:144:Times:these potential threats to the model below.

9:212:16728:38:27:72:227:390:144:Times:144:Times:A.    College and Beyond Data 
9:213:16758:27:28:108:526:363:144:Times:144:Times:Our study is based on data from the 1976 and 1989 cohorts of the College and Beyond 
9:214:16842:28:27:72:539:335:144:Times:144:Times:Survey. The C&B dataset includes information drawn from the applications and transcripts of 34 
9:215:16937:27:28:72:506:308:144:Times:144:Times:colleges and universities (including 4 public universities, 4 historically black colleges and 
9:216:17031:28:28:72:519:280:144:Times:144:Times:universities (HBCUs), 11 liberal arts college, and 15 private universities).2  Much of the past 
9:217:17127:28:27:72:508:252:144:Times:144:Times:research using the C&B data (such as Bowen and Bok (1998) and Dale and Krueger (2002)) 
9:218:17214:27:54:72:187:225:144:Times:65:Times:excluded the 4 HBCUs.3

9:220:17294:8:18:72:507:163:65:Times:99:Times:2  The C&B schools that participated in this study included Barnard College, Bryn Mawr College, Columbia 
9:221:17399:18:11:72:542:145:99:Times:99:Times:University, Duke University, Emory University, Georgetown University, Kenyon College, Miami University of Ohio, 
9:222:17511:11:12:72:536:134:99:Times:99:Times:Morehouse College, Northwestern University, Oberlin College, Penn State University, Princeton University, Smith 
9:223:17623:12:11:72:534:122:99:Times:99:Times:College, Stanford University, Swarthmore College, Tufts University, Tulane University, University of Michigan,     
9:224:17738:11:12:72:542:111:99:Times:99:Times:University of Pennsylvania, Vanderbilt University, Washington University, Wellesley College, Wesleyan University, 
9:225:17852:12:0:72:317:99:99:Times:99:Times:Williams College, Xavier University, and Yale University.    
9:226:17912:0:28:187:539:225:144:Times:144:Times:  In this analysis, we include the 27 schools that agreed to participate in this 
9:227:17993:28:105:71:543:197:144:Times:144:Times:follow-up study, which included 3 public universities, 10 liberal arts colleges, 12 private universities, 
9:228:18098:105:18:72:537:92:65:Times:99:Times:3  At the time that Dale and Krueger (2002) was written, the HBCUs were not part of the standard C&B dataset that 
9:229:18212:18:0:72:187:74:99:Times:99:Times:was provided to researchers. 
10:230:18242:0:28:72:542:709:144:Times:144:Times:and 2 HBCUs. The students from these 27 schools represent 81 percent of the students included in the 
10:231:18343:28:27:72:176:681:144:Times:144:Times:original C&B dataset. 
10:232:18365:27:28:108:505:654:144:Times:144:Times:  The original C&B Survey, conducted by Mathematica Policy Research (MPR) in 
10:233:18442:28:28:72:515:626:144:Times:144:Times:1994-1996, contained questions about earnings, occupation, demographics, education, civic 
10:234:18532:28:27:72:542:598:144:Times:144:Times:activities and life satisfaction.4  MPR attempted to survey all students in the 1976 cohort from each 
10:235:18634:27:28:72:542:571:144:Times:144:Times:of the 34 C&B schools, with the exception of the four public universities, where a sample (of 2000 
10:236:18733:28:28:72:532:543:144:Times:144:Times:individuals) was drawn that included all racial and ethnic minorities and athletes, and a random 
10:237:18830:28:110:72:505:515:144:Times:65:Times:sample of other students.    For the 1989 cohort, students from 21 colleges were surveyed.5
10:238:18921:110:27:108:542:405:144:Times:144:Times:Early in the C&B questionnaire respondents were asked, "In rough order of preference, please 
10:239:19014:27:0:72:293:378:144:Times:144:Times:list the other schools you seriously considered."
10:240:19063:0:28:505:531:516:144:Times:144:Times:  The 
10:241:19069:28:28:71:526:488:144:Times:144:Times:original 1989 C&B sample included all racial and ethnic minorities and athletes and a random 
10:242:19162:28:27:71:523:460:144:Times:144:Times:sample of other students. Our regressions are weighted by the inverse of the probability that a 
10:243:19258:27:50:71:254:433:144:Times:144:Times:student was included in the sample.    
10:244:19297:50:33:293:542:383:65:Times:144:Times:6  Respondents were then asked whether they applied 
10:245:19349:33:28:71:540:350:144:Times:144:Times:to, and were accepted by, each of the schools they listed. Because our analysis relies on individuals’ 
10:246:19452:28:27:72:512:322:144:Times:144:Times:responses to these survey questions, the sample for our primary analysis is restricted to survey 
10:247:19549:27:62:71:135:295:144:Times:65:Times:respondents.7
10:248:19562:62:8:216:218:233:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:                                                           
10:249:19620:8:0:72:511:225:65:Times:99:Times:4 See Bowen and Bok (1998) for a full description of the schools and variables available in the C&B dataset. 
10:250:19727:0:28:135:543:295:144:Times:144:Times:  Survey response rates were 80 percent for the 1976 cohort and 84 percent for the 1989 
10:251:19815:28:56:72:112:267:144:Times:144:Times:cohort.   
10:252:19825:56:17:72:502:211:65:Times:99:Times:5  The participating C&B schools included in the 1989 survey were: Bryn Mawr College, Duke University, 
10:253:19928:17:12:71:528:194:99:Times:99:Times:Georgetown University,    Miami University of Ohio, Morehouse College, Oberlin College Penn State University,

10:255:20144:11:12:71:536:171:99:Times:99:Times:University, Washington University, Wellesley College, Wesleyan University, Williams College, Xavier University, 
10:256:20256:12:8:71:157:159:99:Times:99:Times:and Yale University. 
10:257:20276:8:17:72:543:151:65:Times:99:Times:6  Students who responded to the C&B pilot survey were not asked this question and are therefore excluded from our 
10:258:20391:17:8:72:113:134:99:Times:99:Times:analysis.   
10:259:20403:8:18:72:542:126:65:Times:99:Times:7  We were able to estimate our basic wage equation for the full sample of C&B students (including nonrespondents), 
10:260:20519:18:11:72:542:108:99:Times:99:Times:and obtained results that were similar to those restricted to survey respondents. For example, if we include all students 
10:261:20641:11:11:72:540:97:99:Times:99:Times:in the 1976 cohort with non-zero earnings, the coefficient on school SAT score in the 1995 earnings basic regression 
10:262:20758:11:12:71:518:86:99:Times:99:Times:model was .059 with a standard error of .021; for the sample of survey respondents with non-zero earnings, the 
10:263:20869:12:0:71:410:74:99:Times:99:Times:coefficient on school SAT score was .061 with a standard error of .019 (not shown). 
11:264:20955:0:28:108:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:The C&B Survey data are linked data drawn from individuals’ applications to college 
11:265:21039:28:27:72:543:681:144:Times:144:Times:(such as their SAT scores) as well as data drawn from their transcripts (such as grades in college). 
11:266:21139:27:28:72:538:654:144:Times:144:Times:The C&B data were also merged to the Higher Education Research Institute’s (HERI) Freshman 
11:267:21230:28:28:72:112:626:144:Times:144:Times:Survey. 
11:268:21238:28:27:72:246:598:144:Times:65:Times:B.   Regression Control Variables 
11:269:21271:27:28:108:543:571:144:Times:144:Times: Our basic regression model controls for race, sex, high school grade point average, student 
11:270:21363:28:27:72:547:543:144:Times:144:Times:SAT  score,  predicted  parental  income  and  whether  the  student  was  a  college  athlete;  our  
11:271:21465:27:28:72:542:516:144:Times:144:Times:self-revelation model includes these same variables, and also includes the average SAT score of the 
11:272:21565:28:28:72:543:488:144:Times:144:Times:schools  to  which  a  student  applied  and  the  number  of  applications  they  submitted.  Race,  gender, 
11:273:21675:28:27:72:542:460:144:Times:144:Times:parental education and occupation (used to predict parental income), information on the schools the 
11:274:21775:27:28:72:543:433:144:Times:144:Times:student applied to, whether the student was an athlete, and student SAT score were drawn from the 
11:275:21873:28:28:72:544:405:144:Times:144:Times:C&B  data.  To  construct  other  variables  about  students’  performance  in  high  school  and  their  
11:276:21979:28:27:72:544:377:144:Times:144:Times:parents’  income,  we  used  data  from  the  HERI  freshman  survey.  Because  parental  income  was  
11:277:22082:27:28:72:542:350:144:Times:144:Times:missing for many individuals in the sample, but information for other family background information 
11:278:22182:28:27:72:542:322:144:Times:144:Times:(such as parental education)  was generally available, we predicted parental income by first regressing 
11:279:22286:27:28:72:543:295:144:Times:144:Times:log parental income on mother's and father's education and occupation for the subset of students with 
11:280:22388:28:28:72:543:267:144:Times:144:Times:available family income data, and then multiplied the coefficients from this regression by the values 
11:281:22490:28:27:72:543:239:144:Times:144:Times:of the explanatory variables for every student in the sample. When regression control variables for 
11:282:22590:27:28:72:543:212:144:Times:144:Times:SAT score or high school GPA were missing, we set the variable equal to the mean value for the 
11:283:22685:28:38:72:449:184:144:Times:144:Times:sample, and also included a dummy variable indicating the data were missing. 
11:284:22761:38:27:72:215:146:144:Times:144:Times:C.   College Characteristics 
11:285:22789:27:27:108:543:119:144:Times:144:Times:Each college’s average SAT score and Barron’s index of college selectivity (as reported in 
11:286:22880:27:0:72:543:92:144:Times:144:Times:the 1978 and 1992 Barron’s guides) was linked to student’s responses to the questions concerning 
12:287:22980:0:111:72:205:709:144:Times:65:Times:the schools they applied to.8
12:288:23009:111:27:108:542:598:144:Times:144:Times: Net tuition for 1970, 1980, and 1990 was calculated by subtracting the average aid awarded 
12:289:23100:27:28:72:542:571:144:Times:144:Times:to undergraduates from the sticker price tuition, as reported in the 11th and 12th and 14th editions of 
12:290:23204:28:27:71:544:543:144:Times:144:Times:American  Universities  and  Colleges.  The  1976  net  tuition  was  interpolated  from  the  1970  and  
12:291:23310:27:0:71:353:516:144:Times:144:Times:1980 net tuition, assuming an exponential rate of growth.   
12:292:23370:0:28:205:542:709:144:Times:144:Times:  Because there were only one or two colleges in some categories of the 
12:293:23442:28:27:71:511:681:144:Times:144:Times:Barron’s index (particularly for the 1989 cohort), we represent the index with a continuous 
12:294:23534:27:28:72:523:654:144:Times:144:Times:variable. The schools in our sample ranged from “Competitive” (coded a 2 on our continuous 
12:295:23625:28:150:72:425:626:144:Times:144:Times:measure) to “Most Competitive” (coded a 5 on our continuous measure). 
12:296:23695:150:38:72:218:476:144:Times:144:Times:D.    Earnings Measures  
12:297:23718:38:27:107:527:438:144:Times:144:Times:The Social Security Administration linked College and Beyond data to SSA’s Detailed 
12:298:23802:27:28:71:525:411:144:Times:144:Times:Earnings Records for the period of 1981 through 2007. The earnings measure for this analysis 
12:299:23895:28:27:71:516:383:144:Times:144:Times:included the total earnings an individual reported to the Internal Revenue Service, including 
12:300:23989:27:194:72:478:356:144:Times:65:Times:earnings from self-employment and earnings that were deferred to retirement plans.9
12:301:24072:194:27:108:533:162:144:Times:144:Times: In addition to creating outcome measures that captured annual earnings, we also created 
12:302:24160:27:0:72:543:135:144:Times:144:Times:outcome measures that were the median of an individual’s log annual earnings in 2007 dollars over 
12:303:24258:0:28:478:536:356:144:Times:144:Times:      SSA ran 
12:304:24272:28:28:71:522:328:144:Times:144:Times:computer programs written by MPR on our behalf so that individual-level earnings data were 
12:305:24363:28:27:71:536:300:144:Times:144:Times:never viewed by researchers outside SSA. SSA was able to match over 95 percent of the student 
12:306:24457:27:28:71:511:273:144:Times:144:Times:records we provided. We converted annual earnings for each year to 2007 dollars using the 
12:307:24547:28:27:71:529:245:144:Times:144:Times:Consumer Price Index (CPI-U). The SSA earnings measure used in our primary analysis is not 
12:308:24638:27:28:71:539:218:144:Times:144:Times:topcoded; however, to compare to the C&B survey, for one analysis, we deliberately topcode the 
12:309:24733:28:88:71:460:190:144:Times:144:Times:SSA data to be consistent with the C&B data, as described in more detail below.

12:311:24870:8:14:72:486:94:65:Times:99:Times:8  HERI provided the file with average SAT scores for 1978 and Mark Long provided the file for 1992. 
12:312:24971:14:0:72:311:80:65:Times:99:Times:9 Income received from capital gains is excluded. 
13:313:25022:0:28:72:525:709:144:Times:144:Times:five year intervals (1983 through 1987, 1998 through 1992, 1993 through 1997, 1998 through 
13:314:25113:28:27:72:542:681:144:Times:144:Times:2002, and 2003 through 2007). For example, the dependent variable for the period of 1993 to 1997 
13:315:25210:27:28:71:542:654:144:Times:144:Times:was the median (for each individual) of his or her log earnings in the five years from 1993 to 1997. 
13:316:25311:28:28:71:530:626:144:Times:144:Times:By using medians over five-year intervals, we reduce noise in the earnings measure that would 
13:317:25405:28:27:71:526:598:144:Times:144:Times:result from brief periods of time that the students may have spent out of the labor market or in 
13:318:25502:27:38:71:200:571:144:Times:144:Times:non-covered employment. 
13:319:25525:38:27:107:542:533:144:Times:144:Times: Finally, the focus of this study is on the productivity of individuals who are employed (and 
13:320:25618:27:28:71:532:506:144:Times:144:Times:not on whether individuals choose to or are able to work). Because we cannot identify full-time 
13:321:25714:28:28:72:542:478:144:Times:144:Times:workers or hourly wages in the SSA administrative data, we generally restrict the sample to those 
13:322:25812:28:27:72:528:450:144:Times:144:Times:earning over $13,822 (in 2007 dollars) during the year, the equivalent of earning the minimum 
13:323:25906:27:28:72:510:423:144:Times:144:Times:wage for 2,000 hours at the 1982 federal minimum wage value (in 2007 dollars). For those 
13:324:25995:28:27:72:499:395:144:Times:144:Times:regressions in which the dependent variable is median earnings over a five year interval, 
13:325:26085:27:28:72:510:368:144:Times:144:Times:individuals were included in the sample if their median earnings over the five year interval 
13:326:26178:28:28:72:542:340:144:Times:144:Times:exceeded $13,822; individuals were still included in the sample they earned less than $13,822 in a 
13:327:26277:28:27:72:534:312:144:Times:144:Times:particular year as long as their median earnings exceeded $13,822. Estimates based on a sample 
13:328:26372:27:28:72:531:285:144:Times:144:Times:that use this restriction are more precise than those based on a sample of all non-zero earners.10 
13:329:26470:28:27:72:538:257:144:Times:144:Times:Also, as shown in Table 3, estimates based on the sample defined by this restriction are closer to 
13:330:26569:27:28:72:509:230:144:Times:144:Times:estimates drawn from the sample of full-time workers (according to the C&B survey) than 
13:331:26657:28:38:72:344:202:144:Times:65:Times:estimates drawn from a sample of all non-zero earners.11
13:332:26713:38:0:72:439:164:144:Times:144:Times:IV. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS FOR SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS  
13:333:26765:0:54:344:352:202:144:Times:144:Times:   
13:334:26768:54:8:216:218:148:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:                                                           
13:335:26826:8:18:72:527:140:65:Times:99:Times:10  Approximately 10 percent of workers in our sample (that is, those with any earnings) in the 1976 cohort and 8 
13:336:26940:18:8:72:533:122:99:Times:99:Times:percent those in the 1989 cohort had earnings that were between zero and this minimum wage threshold ($13,822). 
13:337:27051:8:17:72:526:114:65:Times:99:Times:11  Most studies on the return to college quality either restrict the sample to full-time workers (for example, Long 
13:338:27168:17:11:72:542:97:99:Times:99:Times:2008) or to non-zero earners (for example, Hoekstra 2009). If we estimate our model using levels instead of logs, and 
13:339:27286:11:12:72:542:86:99:Times:99:Times:include those with no earnings, we obtain qualitatively similar results. For example, for the 1976 cohort, the return to 
13:340:27407:12:0:72:496:74:99:Times:99:Times:selectivity was $26,575(7,566) in the basic model and fell to $2,154 (9,884) in the self-revelation model.  
14:341:27517:0:37:72:342:708:144:Times:144:Times:A. Characteristics of Colleges and Students in Sample 
14:342:27570:37:27:108:540:671:144:Times:144:Times: While the average SAT score for colleges in the C&B dataset ranged from approximately 
14:343:27656:27:28:72:541:644:144:Times:144:Times:800 to over 1300, most of the C&B schools were highly selective. The majority of C&B colleges 
14:344:27750:28:28:72:531:616:144:Times:144:Times:fell into one of the top two Barron’s categories (Most Competitive or Highly Competitive; see  
14:345:27844:28:27:72:542:588:144:Times:144:Times:Appendix Table 1), and had an average SAT score of greater than 1175. The high selectivity of the 
14:346:27942:27:28:72:531:561:144:Times:144:Times:colleges within the C&B database make it particularly well-suited for this analysis, because the 
14:347:28039:28:27:72:543:533:144:Times:144:Times:majority of students that attend selective colleges submit multiple applications, which is necessary 
14:348:28140:27:28:72:542:506:144:Times:144:Times:for our identification strategy. In contrast, many students who attend less selective colleges submit 
14:349:28242:28:28:72:522:478:144:Times:144:Times:only one application, because many less selective colleges accept all students who apply. For 
14:350:28336:28:27:72:524:450:144:Times:144:Times:example, according to data from the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 
14:351:28428:27:38:72:500:423:144:Times:144:Times:1972, only 46 percent of students who attended college applied to more than one school. 
14:352:28516:38:27:108:553:385:144:Times:144:Times: The regression sample includes students who entered (but did not necessarily graduate from)      
14:353:28613:27:28:72:503:358:144:Times:144:Times:one of the C&B schools. The student and school characteristics among those included in the 
14:354:28704:28:28:72:539:330:144:Times:144:Times:regression sample are shown in Table 1. Because the schools included in the database were highly 
14:355:28801:28:27:72:528:302:144:Times:144:Times:selective, the students were in the sample had high academic qualifications. The students in the 
14:356:28898:27:28:72:538:275:144:Times:144:Times:1976 cohort had an average SAT scores of 1160, and an average high school grade point average of 
14:357:28995:28:27:71:542:247:144:Times:144:Times:3.6. (Note that for ease of interpretation, in our tables and regression analysis, we divide our measures 
14:358:29101:27:28:71:520:220:144:Times:144:Times:of school SAT score and student SAT score by 100). Similarly, for the 1989 cohort, the average 
14:359:29196:28:28:71:526:192:144:Times:144:Times:student SAT score was over 1200, and the average GPA was 3.6. The percentage of students that 
14:360:29290:28:27:71:542:164:144:Times:144:Times:were racial and ethnic minorities was higher for the 1989 cohort than for the 1976 cohort. Of the 1976 
14:361:29393:27:28:71:541:137:144:Times:144:Times:cohort, 6 percent of students were black and 1 percent were Hispanic, whereas 8 percent in the 1989 
14:362:29493:28:27:71:535:109:144:Times:144:Times:cohort were black and 3 percent were Hispanic. Finally, earnings for the sample were high, as the 
14:363:29591:27:0:71:539:82:144:Times:144:Times:average of each individual’s median earnings over the 2003 to 2007 period was $164,009 for the 
15:364:29689:0:28:72:535:709:144:Times:144:Times:1976 cohort. Average annual earnings in 2007 were $183,411 for the 1979 cohort and $139,698 
15:365:29781:28:38:72:170:681:144:Times:144:Times:for the 1989 cohort. 
15:366:29802:38:37:72:290:643:144:Times:144:Times:B. Application and Matriculation Patterns    
15:367:29847:37:28:108:523:606:144:Times:144:Times: Table 2 provides descriptive statistics about the application behavior of the students who 
15:368:29938:28:27:72:536:578:144:Times:144:Times:entered one of the C&B schools in our study in 1976 or 1989. Nearly two-thirds of the 1976 cohort 
15:369:30036:27:28:72:525:551:144:Times:144:Times:and 71 percent of the 1989 cohort submitted at least one additional application (in addition to the 
15:370:30136:28:28:72:498:523:144:Times:144:Times:school they attended). For both cohorts, of those students submitting at least one additional 
15:371:30230:28:27:72:528:495:144:Times:144:Times:application, over half applied to a school with a higher average SAT score than that of the college 
15:372:30330:27:28:72:533:468:144:Times:144:Times:they attended, and nearly 90 percent of students were accepted to at least one additional school. Of 
15:373:30431:28:27:72:534:440:144:Times:144:Times:those accepted to more than one school, about 35 percent were accepted to a more selective school 
15:374:30529:27:28:72:541:413:144:Times:144:Times:than the one they ended up attending. The data for black and Hispanic students (shown in columns 2 
15:375:30628:28:27:72:539:385:144:Times:144:Times:and 4) are similar, though blacks and Hispanics were somewhat more likely than students in the full 
15:376:30728:27:28:72:543:358:144:Times:144:Times:sample to be accepted to at least one additional school, and to be accepted to a more selective school 
15:377:30831:28:38:72:200:330:144:Times:144:Times:than the one they attended. 
15:378:30859:38:27:108:535:292:144:Times:144:Times: While we could not explore whether students’ unobserved ability is related to the school 
15:379:30948:27:28:72:531:265:144:Times:144:Times:they attend, we were able to examine how students’ observed characteristics are related to their 
15:380:31045:28:28:72:542:237:144:Times:144:Times:choice of school, among those who were admitted to similar schools. Appendix Table 2 shows the 
15:381:31140:28:27:72:543:209:144:Times:144:Times:relationship between student characteristics and the average SAT score of a school they choose to 
15:382:31238:27:28:72:523:182:144:Times:144:Times:attend (conditional on the average SAT score of the most selective school to which they were 
15:383:31331:28:27:72:535:154:144:Times:144:Times:accepted). For 1976, the coefficient on student SAT score is positive and statistically significant 
15:384:31431:27:28:72:531:127:144:Times:144:Times:(for both the full sample and the black and Hispanic subgroup). While the relationship between 
15:385:31526:28:0:71:543:99:144:Times:144:Times:high school GPA and the selectivity of the college attended is close to zero for the full sample, it is 
16:386:31632:0:28:72:529:709:144:Times:144:Times:positive for black and Hispanic students. These results suggest that students in the 1976 cohort 
16:387:31729:28:28:72:534:681:144:Times:144:Times:with better academic credentials tended to matriculate to more selective schools, controlling for 
16:388:31827:28:37:71:434:653:144:Times:144:Times:the average SAT score of the most selective school they were accepted at.   
16:389:31903:37:28:107:542:616:144:Times:144:Times: For the 1989 cohort, there was not a consistent pattern between student characteristics and 
16:390:31995:28:27:71:543:588:144:Times:144:Times:students’ choice of schools. While the relationship between SAT score and school selectivity was 
16:391:32092:27:28:71:513:561:144:Times:144:Times:positive and statistically significant (within both the full sample and the black and Hispanic 
16:392:32187:28:28:71:534:533:144:Times:144:Times:subgroup), the relationship between high school GPA and the selectivity of the college attended 
16:393:32282:28:37:71:281:505:144:Times:144:Times:was negative and statistically significant.     
16:394:32330:37:28:107:542:468:144:Times:144:Times: Taken as a whole, these results do not suggest that students with greater potential chose to 
16:395:32423:28:27:71:542:440:144:Times:144:Times:attend less selective schools; in fact, if anything, results from the 1976 cohort suggest that students 
16:396:32527:27:28:71:523:413:144:Times:144:Times:with greater potential attend more selective schools. If, among students who were admitted to 
16:397:32621:28:28:71:533:385:144:Times:144:Times:similar schools, more ambitious students choose to attend more selective schools, then even our 
16:398:32717:28:34:71:489:357:144:Times:65:Tahoma:selection-adjusted estimates of the effect of college selectivity will be biased upwards.

16:402:32820:37:38:72:476:263:144:Times:144:Times:A. Comparison of Earnings Using C&B Survey and SSA Administrative Data   
16:403:32893:38:27:108:536:225:144:Times:144:Times:We begin by comparing earnings drawn from the C&B survey to those drawn from SSA 
16:404:32974:27:28:72:538:198:144:Times:144:Times:administrative data. The C&B survey asked individuals to report their earnings in categories; we 
16:405:33071:28:27:72:539:170:144:Times:144:Times:assigned those individuals with earnings over 200,000 a topcode of $245,662. (This topcode was 
16:406:33166:27:28:72:542:143:144:Times:144:Times:set to be equal to the mean log earnings for graduates age 36 to 38 who earned more than $200,000 
16:407:33264:28:28:71:540:115:144:Times:144:Times:per year, according to data from the 1990 census (in 1995 dollars)). If we recode the SSA data so 
16:408:33362:28:0:72:512:87:144:Times:144:Times:that those earning over 200,000 have this same topcode, the correlation for the 1976 cohort 
17:409:33457:0:55:72:467:709:144:Times:65:Times:between SSA earnings (in 1995) and C&B earnings during the same year is 0.90.12
17:410:33536:55:28:108:537:654:144:g_d0_f2:144:Times: To compare results from this analysis to the results reported in Dale and Krueger (2002), 
17:411:33626:28:28:72:511:626:144:Times:144:Times:we first estimated a regression where the log of C&B earnings is the outcome measure, but 
17:412:33716:28:27:72:542:598:144:Times:144:Times:restricted the sample to students in the merged C&B and SSA sample (that is, they matriculated at 
17:413:33814:27:28:72:520:571:144:Times:144:Times:one of the C&B schools participating in this study, reported that they were working full-time 
17:414:33908:28:28:72:534:543:144:Times:144:Times:during all of 1995 on the C&B survey, and matched to the SSA data). The coefficient on school 
17:415:34002:28:27:72:549:515:144:Times:144:Times:SAT score/100 in the basic model using this sample restriction is .068 (.014) (see Table 3,   column 
17:416:34103:27:28:71:507:488:144:Times:144:Times:3), indicating that attending a school with a 100-point higher SAT score is associated with 
17:417:34194:28:27:71:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:approximately 7 percent higher earnings later in a student’s career. This estimate is similar (though 
17:418:34296:27:28:72:520:433:144:Times:144:Times:slightly less than) the .076 (.016) estimate for the C&B sample reported in Dale and Krueger 
17:419:34389:28:0:71:232:405:144:Times:144:Times:(2002) (shown here in column 1).
17:420:34421:0:28:467:542:709:144:Times:144:Times:  This is similar 
17:421:34439:28:270:71:512:681:144:Times:144:Times:to estimates of the reliability of self-reported earnings data in Angrist and Krueger (1999).  
17:422:34533:270:71:233:241:411:65:Times:65:Times:13
17:423:34535:71:28:108:540:340:144:Times:144:Times: Next, we use earnings drawn from the SSA data. In column 5, we use the same sample of 
17:424:34621:28:27:72:537:312:144:Times:144:Times:full-time workers, but use SSA earnings that were topcoded in the same way that earnings in the 
17:425:34717:27:28:72:515:285:144:Times:144:Times:C&B survey were topcoded. In column 7, we use SSA earnings and use the same sample of 
17:426:34803:28:27:72:517:257:144:Times:144:Times:full-time workers, but do not topcode the data. In column 9, we use the median of [log(1993 
17:427:34895:27:28:71:540:230:144:Times:144:Times:earnings) through log (1997 earnings)] (in 2007 dollars) as our outcome measure, and restrict the 
17:428:34993:28:28:71:542:202:144:Times:144:Times:sample to those with non-zero earnings. In column 11, we restrict the sample to those with annual 
17:429:35091:28:27:71:543:174:144:Times:144:Times:earnings that were greater than a minimum wage threshold (defined as $13,822 in 2007 dollars). In 
17:430:35189:27:0:71:529:147:144:Times:144:Times:each model, the estimates for the coefficient on school SAT score drawn from our basic model 
17:431:35282:0:28:241:533:405:144:Times:144:Times:  In both samples, the return becomes indistinguishable from 
17:432:35343:28:263:71:370:377:144:Times:144:Times:zero in the self-revelation model (shown in columns 2 and 4). 
17:433:35405:263:9:216:218:114:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:                                                           
17:434:35463:9:13:72:521:105:65:Times:99:Times:12  When SSA earnings are not topcoded, the correlation between SSA earnings and C&B earnings falls to 0.67. 
17:435:35571:13:18:72:542:92:65:Times:99:Times:13  Note that the Dale and Krueger (2002) estimate is based on students from 30 C&B schools (all of the C&B schools 
17:436:35687:18:0:72:531:74:99:Times:99:Times:except for the HBCUs), whereas the estimate in column 3 includes the 27 C&B schools participating in this study. 
18:437:35802:0:28:72:533:709:144:Times:144:Times:range from .048 to .061, and are similar to (but somewhat less than) the estimate using earnings 
18:438:35899:28:37:72:305:681:144:Times:144:Times:from the C&B survey as the outcome measure.   
18:439:35945:37:28:108:526:644:144:Times:144:Times: Columns 6, 8, 10, and 12 show results from the self-revelation model for each of these 
18:440:36032:28:28:72:542:616:144:Times:144:Times:samples. The return to school SAT score in each of these selection-adjusted models is negative and 
18:441:36131:28:37:71:214:588:144:Times:144:Times:indistinguishable from zero.   
18:442:36162:37:28:107:530:551:144:Times:144:Times: In summary, for the 1976 cohort, across a variety of sample restrictions and across both 
18:443:36251:28:28:71:542:523:144:Times:144:Times:sources of earnings data (C&B survey data and SSA administrative data), the return to school SAT 
18:444:36348:28:27:71:528:495:144:Times:144:Times:score has a large and positive effect on earnings when we do not adjust for unobserved student 
18:445:36443:27:28:71:488:468:144:Times:144:Times:characteristics. However, when we adjust for unobserved student characteristics in the 
18:446:36530:28:38:71:508:440:144:Times:144:Times:self-revelation model, the return falls substantially, becoming indistinguishable from zero. 
18:447:36623:38:37:71:243:402:144:Times:144:Times:B. Alternative Selection Controls 
18:448:36656:37:27:107:542:365:144:Times:144:Times: We also re-estimated the series of models from Dale and Krueger (2002) that use a variety 
18:449:36746:27:28:71:542:338:144:Times:144:Times:of selection controls in place of the average SAT score that the student applied to. For example, in 
18:450:36847:28:28:71:538:310:144:Times:144:Times:one model, we controlled for the highest SAT score of the schools a student was accepted by but 
18:451:36943:28:27:71:529:282:144:Times:144:Times:did not attend.    In another model, we controlled for the average SAT score of the colleges that 
18:452:37041:27:28:71:542:255:144:Times:144:Times:rejected the student. Consistent with Dale and Krueger (2002), in each of these models, the return 
18:453:37140:28:27:71:542:227:144:Times:144:Times:to the school SAT score of the school that the student actually attended was less than the return to 
18:454:37241:27:28:72:541:200:144:Times:144:Times:the colleges they applied to but (did not attend). For example, for the 1976 cohort, the coefficient 
18:455:37342:28:28:72:532:172:144:Times:144:Times:on average school SAT score among the schools a student was rejected by was .079 (.022), and 
18:456:37435:28:27:72:542:144:144:Times:144:Times:from this same model the coefficient on the average SAT score for the school the student attended 
18:457:37533:27:0:72:416:117:144:Times:144:Times:was .035 (.028).    A  full set of these results is available upon request.     
19:458:37615:0:28:108:543:709:144:Times:144:Times: The finding that the average SAT score of schools that rejected a student is more than twice 
19:459:37708:28:27:72:539:681:144:Times:144:Times:as strong a predictor of the student’s subsequent earnings as the average SAT score of the school 
19:460:37806:27:28:72:518:654:144:Times:144:Times:the student attended provides powerful evidence that conventional estimates of the payoff to 
19:461:37899:28:38:72:450:626:144:Times:144:Times:attending highly selective colleges is biased upward, at least for this sample.     
19:462:37982:38:37:72:508:588:144:Times:144:Times:C. Estimated Effect of College Characteristics over the Lifecycle for the 1976 Cohort 
19:463:38068:37:28:108:527:551:144:Times:144:Times: To assess the return to school characteristics over the course of student’s career for the 
19:464:38159:28:28:72:534:523:144:Times:144:Times:1976 cohort, we estimate regressions where the outcome measure was the median of log(annual 
19:465:38251:28:27:72:541:495:144:Times:144:Times:earnings) for each individual (in 2007 dollars) over a five year interval (1983 through 1987, 1998 
19:466:38350:27:28:72:521:468:144:Times:144:Times:through 1992, 1993 through 1997, 1998 through 2002, and 2003 through 2007).   Results are 
19:467:38440:28:37:72:161:440:144:Times:144:Times:shown in Table 4. 
19:468:38458:37:28:108:528:403:144:Times:144:Times: In our basic model with a standard set of regression controls, the return to college SAT 
19:469:38547:28:28:72:522:375:144:Times:144:Times:score increases over the course of a student’s career, from indistinguishable from zero for the 
19:470:38643:28:27:72:530:347:144:Times:144:Times:earliest period (1983 to 1987, about 3 to 7 years after students likely would have graduated), to 
19:471:38741:27:28:72:523:320:144:Times:144:Times:over seven percent in for the period of 2003 to 2007 (23 to 27 years after college graduation). 
19:472:38837:28:27:72:541:292:144:Times:144:Times:However, in our self-revelation models, the estimates are not significantly different from zero for 
19:473:38937:27:28:72:537:265:144:Times:144:Times:any time period. (To save space, we only report parameter estimates for school characteristics in 
19:474:39035:28:37:72:542:237:144:Times:144:Times:these tables. In Appendix Table 3, we report a full set of parameter estimates for selected models). 
19:475:39136:37:28:108:517:200:144:Times:144:Times: We also estimated regressions separately by gender. In the basic model, the return to 
19:476:39222:28:28:72:543:172:144:Times:144:Times:college SAT score for men was about 5 percent in 1988 to 1992, and increased over time, reaching 
19:477:39318:28:27:72:509:144:144:Times:144:Times:a high of nearly 9 percent for the period of 1998 through 2002. For women, the return was 
19:478:39408:27:28:72:533:117:144:Times:144:Times:consistently lower than the return for men, ranging from 3 percent (in 1988 to 1992) to nearly 6 
19:479:39505:28:0:72:542:89:144:Times:144:Times:percent (in 2003 to 2007). The lower return for women does not appear to be due solely to the fact 
20:480:39607:0:28:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:that we cannot identify which women were working full time in SSA’s administrative data, as the 
20:481:39703:28:27:72:536:681:144:Times:144:Times:return for women (5 percent) was smaller than the return for men (7 percent) in the C&B survey 
20:482:39798:27:28:71:536:654:144:Times:144:Times:when we limited the sample to those who reported working full-time. For both men and women, 
20:483:39890:28:93:71:479:626:144:Times:65:Times:the coefficient was zero (and sometimes even negative) in the self-revelation model.14
20:484:39976:93:27:108:529:533:144:Times:144:Times: We estimated these same regressions for two other college characteristics, the Barron’s 
20:485:40064:27:28:72:529:506:144:Times:144:Times:Index and the log of net tuition. The results are summarized in Table 5. In our basic model, the 
20:486:40161:28:28:72:536:478:144:Times:144:Times:estimated impact of these school characteristics increased over the course of the career, with the 
20:487:40260:28:27:72:542:450:144:Times:144:Times:coefficient on log tuition reaching a high of 0.14 and the Barron’s Index reaching 0.08 at in the last 
20:488:40363:27:28:72:535:423:144:Times:144:Times:five year interval (last set of rows, Table 5). However, in the self-revelation model the estimates 
20:489:40463:28:0:72:392:395:144:Times:144:Times:fall substantially and are statistically insignificant at the 0.10 level.
20:490:40536:0:28:480:543:626:144:Times:144:Times:  To increase 
20:491:40550:28:27:72:534:598:144:Times:144:Times:sample size and improve the precision of our estimates, we focus on results based on the pooled 
20:492:40646:27:170:72:403:571:144:Times:144:Times:sample of men and women together throughout the rest of the paper. 
20:493:40713:170:43:393:401:401:65:Times:65:Times:15
20:494:40715:43:28:108:542:358:144:Times:144:Times: These results are partly a contrast to Dale and Krueger (2002), in that the earlier analysis of 
20:495:40811:28:28:72:543:330:144:Times:144:Times:self-reported earnings data showed a statistically significant relationship between earnings and the 
20:496:40912:28:0:72:543:302:144:Times:144:Times:log of net tuition in the self-revelation model, as the coefficient on net tuition was of .058 (.018). 
20:497:41014:0:129:401:409:395:144:Times:144:Times:   
20:498:41017:129:9:216:218:266:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:                                                           
20:499:41075:9:19:72:542:257:65:Times:99:Times:14 This lower return to college selectivity for women is consistent with other literature. Results from Hoekstra (2009), 
20:500:41195:19:13:72:526:238:99:Times:99:Times:Black and Smith (2004) and Long (2008) all suggest that the effect of college selectivity on earnings is lower for 
20:501:41310:13:13:72:521:225:99:Times:99:Times:women than for men. Also, while the coefficients for school SAT in the self-revelation model was negative and 
20:502:41420:13:14:71:541:212:99:Times:99:Times:significant for women in some years (1993 to 1997 and 1998 to 2002), the pattern of results across all of the models we 
20:503:41540:14:13:71:542:198:99:Times:99:Times:estimated (which included, for example, different measures of college quality measures and different minimum wage 
20:504:41654:13:13:72:541:185:99:Times:99:Times:thresholds)  did not suggest that the return for women was significantly less than zero. For example, the coefficients for 
20:505:41777:13:13:71:528:172:99:Times:99:Times:the Barron's index for women for women was .051 (.011) in the basic model and .010 (.022) in the self-revelation 
20:506:41890:13:14:71:534:159:99:Times:99:Times:model in 1993 to 1997; similarly in 1998 through 1992 the coefficient was .050 (.008) in the basic model and -.004 
20:507:42005:14:23:71:213:145:99:Times:99:Times:(.027) in the self-revelation model. 
20:508:42041:23:8:71:73:122:99:Times:99:Times: 
20:509:42041:8:17:72:498:114:65:Times:99:Times:15  We probed the sensitivity of the estimates by including dummy variables for categories (such as “Most 
20:510:42147:17:11:72:542:97:99:Times:99:Times:Competitive”) for the gradations of the Barron’s Index.    The estimates for the most selective categories were sizeable 
20:511:42268:11:12:72:526:86:99:Times:99:Times:and significant compared with the base group of the least selective schools in the basic model but were small and 
20:512:42382:12:0:72:287:74:99:Times:99:Times:statistically insignificant in the self-revelation model. 
21:513:42442:0:28:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:To attempt to reconcile these results with Dale and Krueger (2002), we re-estimated the effect of 
21:514:42540:28:27:72:543:681:144:Times:144:Times:net tuition on self-reported earnings for full-time workers from the C&B survey in 1995 using the 
21:515:42638:27:28:72:544:654:144:Times:144:Times:subset  of  students  from  the  schools  participating  in this  study,  and  found  that  the  coefficient  
21:516:42748:28:28:72:542:626:144:Times:144:Times:(adjusted for clustering) on log (net tuition)  from the self-revelation model was somewhat smaller: 
21:517:42849:28:27:72:543:598:144:Times:144:Times:.041 (.038), and not statistically significant. When we estimated the same regression for the same 
21:518:42948:27:28:72:544:571:144:Times:144:Times:sample,  but  used  SSA’s  administrative  earnings data in  1995  (instead  of  self-reported  earnings  
21:519:43054:28:28:72:542:543:144:Times:144:Times:data from the C&B survey), the coefficient (and standard error) on net tuition was even smaller: 
21:520:43151:28:27:72:542:515:144:Times:144:Times:.033 (.046). Moreover, over the full study period (1983 to 2007) the coefficient on net tuition was 
21:521:43251:27:28:72:543:488:144:Times:144:Times:generally between 0 and .02 (and never greater than .033) in the self-revelation model based on 
21:522:43346:28:27:72:544:460:144:Times:144:Times:earnings  drawn  from  SSA  administrative  data  as  the  outcome  measure.  Thus,  the  effect  of  net  
21:523:43453:27:28:72:544:433:144:Times:144:Times:tuition  based  on  the  single  year  of  self-reported  earnings  reported  in  Dale  and  Krueger  (2002)  
21:524:43563:28:28:72:543:405:144:Times:144:Times:appears to been atypically high relative to the series of estimates we were able to generate using 
21:525:43662:28:37:72:538:377:144:Times:144:Times:SSA’s administrative data, though the large standard errors make it difficult to draw inferences.   
21:526:43762:37:38:72:418:340:144:Times:144:Times:C. Estimated Effects of College Characteristics for the 1989 Cohort 
21:527:43830:38:27:108:543:302:144:Times:144:Times: Unlike the 1976 cohort where we have data for most of the student’s career, we only have a 
21:528:43921:27:28:72:543:275:144:Times:144:Times:limited number of post-college years for the 1989 cohort. As shown for the 1976 cohort, there is no 
21:529:44021:28:27:72:520:247:144:Times:144:Times:return to college characteristics in the early part of a student’s career, possibly because many 
21:530:44118:27:28:72:542:220:144:Times:144:Times:graduates from highly selective colleges attend graduate school, and thus forego work experience 
21:531:44215:28:28:72:513:192:144:Times:144:Times:early in their careers. Therefore, for the 1989 cohort, we focus on the most recent year with 
21:532:44308:28:27:72:527:164:144:Times:144:Times:earnings data available, 2007, when the students, were, on average, 35 years old. Although the 
21:533:44403:27:28:72:530:137:144:Times:144:Times:1989 cohort is too young to assess changes in the return to school selectivity over the student’s 
21:534:44501:28:28:72:538:109:144:Times:144:Times:career, it does allow us to assess whether estimates for the return to school selectivity are similar 
21:535:44603:28:0:72:290:81:144:Times:144:Times:across cohorts at one point in the lifecycle.     
22:536:44656:0:28:108:539:709:144:Times:144:Times:   In 2007, the coefficient for school SAT score/100 was .056 with a standard error of .014 
22:537:44747:28:27:72:531:681:144:Times:144:Times:(or .031 if we adjust for clustering among students who attended the same schools) in the basic 
22:538:44843:27:28:72:477:654:144:Times:144:Times:model (Table 6). Consistent with the results for the 1976 cohort, the coefficient was 
22:539:44929:28:28:71:520:626:144:Times:144:Times:indistinguishable from zero (-.008 with a standard error of .019) in the self-revelation model. 
22:540:45025:28:27:71:542:598:144:Times:144:Times:When we estimated these models by gender, the results are also similar to those of the 1976 cohort: 
22:541:45125:27:28:71:542:571:144:Times:144:Times:the coefficient for women (.032) was lower than the coefficient for men (.067) in the basic model, 
22:542:45224:28:28:71:530:543:144:Times:144:Times:and in the self-revelation model, estimates for both men and women are indistinguishable from 
22:543:45318:28:37:71:159:515:144:Times:144:Times:zero (not shown). 
22:544:45336:37:28:107:534:478:144:Times:144:Times: The results for the Barron’s index were consistent with the results for school SAT score. 
22:545:45426:28:27:71:541:450:144:Times:144:Times:Specifically, the return to the Barron’s index was nearly 7 percent in the basic model, but was close 
22:546:45528:27:28:71:542:423:144:Times:144:Times:to zero in the self-revelation model. For net tuition, our estimates from both models were negative 
22:547:45628:28:38:71:217:395:144:Times:144:Times:and had large standard errors. 
22:548:45659:38:37:71:479:357:144:Times:144:Times:D. Estimated Effect of College Characteristics for Racial and Ethnic Minorities 
22:549:45738:37:28:107:536:320:144:Times:144:Times: Because some past studies have found that the return to college selectivity varies by race 
22:550:45829:28:27:71:509:292:144:Times:144:Times:(Behrman et al. 1996, Long 2009, and Loury and Garman 1995), we also examined results 
22:551:45915:27:28:72:521:265:144:Times:144:Times:separately for racial and ethnic minorities. To increase the sample size, we pooled blacks and 
22:552:46010:28:28:72:532:237:144:Times:144:Times:Hispanics together, both of which often receive preferential treatment in the college admissions 
22:553:46107:28:27:72:537:209:144:Times:144:Times:process (Bowen and Bok, 1998). For the 1976 cohort, the return to each proxy for school quality 
22:554:46203:27:28:72:542:182:144:Times:144:Times:increased over the course of the students’ career, and the magnitude of the coefficients did not fall 
22:555:46305:28:27:72:541:154:144:Times:144:Times:substantially in the self-revelation model. The coefficient was most pronounced for the Barron’s   
22:556:46404:27:28:71:517:127:144:Times:144:Times:index, where going to a school in a higher Barron’s category translated to 6.7 percent higher 
22:557:46498:28:0:71:543:99:144:Times:144:Times:earnings (for the period of 2003 to 2007) in the basic model and 6.2 percent higher earnings in the 
23:558:46601:0:28:72:542:709:144:Times:144:Times:self-revelation model (not shown). However, the standard errors were large, so the estimate for the 
23:559:46701:28:37:72:515:681:144:Times:65:Times:Barron’s index in the self-revelation model was not statistically significant at the .10 level.16
23:560:46798:37:28:108:542:644:144:Times:144:Times: Estimates for the 1989 cohort are shown in Table 7. Parameter estimates for each proxy for 
23:561:46889:28:28:71:542:616:144:Times:144:Times:school quality a re large in the basic model, ranging from 6.3 for the Barron’s Index to 17.3 percent 
23:562:46991:28:27:71:532:588:144:Times:144:Times:for the log of net tuition (Table 7). In the self-revelation model, these estimates remained large, 
23:563:47091:27:28:71:542:561:144:Times:144:Times:ranging from 4.9 for the Barrons Index to 13.8 for the log of net tuition. While the standard errors 
23:564:47192:28:27:71:499:533:144:Times:144:Times:are also large, some of the estimates are significantly greater than zero. For example, the 
23:565:47284:27:28:71:501:506:144:Times:144:Times:coefficient on school SAT score/100 was .076 with a standard error of .032 (or .042 after 
23:566:47374:28:0:71:330:478:144:Times:144:Times:accounting for clustering of students within schools). 
23:567:47429:0:241:515:523:681:144:Times:144:Times:   
23:568:47432:241:27:108:535:440:144:Times:144:Times: Because the historically black colleges and universities in this sample had lower average 
23:569:47522:27:28:72:542:413:144:Times:144:Times:SAT scores (and lower Barron’s indices and net tuition) than the rest of the institutions in the C&B 
23:570:47623:28:27:72:516:385:144:Times:144:Times:database, we investigated whether the reason that there was a return to school selectivity for 
23:571:47718:27:28:72:514:358:144:Times:144:Times:minority students (but not for all students) was due to the greater range in school selectivity 
23:572:47813:28:204:72:230:330:144:Times:65:Times:observed for minority students.17
23:573:47846:204:0:72:447:126:144:Times:144:Times:E. Estimated Effect of School Average SAT Score by Parental Education 
23:574:47916:0:28:230:535:330:144:Times:144:Times:  Specifically, we re-estimated the regressions but excluded the 
23:575:47981:28:27:72:515:302:144:Times:144:Times:HBCUs from the sample. For the 1976 cohort, the return to the Barron’s Index fell from 6.2 
23:576:48072:27:28:72:543:275:144:Times:144:Times:percent to 1.6 percent (and indistinguishable from zero) when we imposed this sample restriction. 
23:577:48170:28:27:72:509:247:144:Times:144:Times:However, for the 1989 cohort, the estimates for minority students remained large when we 
23:578:48259:27:28:72:543:220:144:Times:144:Times:excluded the HBCUs, implying returns of 12 percent for attending a school with 100 point higher 
23:579:48355:28:28:72:509:192:144:Times:144:Times:SAT score and 14 percent for attending a school in a higher Barron’s category, even in the 
23:580:48446:28:62:72:182:164:144:Times:65:Times:self-revelation model.

23:583:48586:14:0:72:528:80:65:Times:99:Times:17  See Fryer and Greenstone (2007) for estimates of effect of HBCUs on earnings (and other outcome measures). 
24:584:48699:0:28:108:531:709:144:Times:144:Times: Finally, we explored whether the effect of college selectivity varied by average years of 
24:585:48789:28:314:72:171:681:144:Times:65:Times:parental education.18
24:586:48810:314:0:72:176:367:144:Times:144:Times:VI. CONCLUSION 
24:587:48825:0:27:171:542:681:144:Times:144:Times:  The interaction term for school-average SAT and years of parental education 
24:588:48903:27:28:71:535:654:144:Times:144:Times:was negative for both cohorts, implying a higher payoff to attending a more selective school for 
24:589:49000:28:28:72:484:626:144:Times:144:Times:students from more disadvantaged family backgrounds (Table 8). For example, in the 
24:590:49083:28:27:72:515:598:144:Times:144:Times:self-revelation model for the 1989 cohort, our results suggest that attending a college with a 
24:591:49178:27:28:72:520:571:144:Times:144:Times:200-point higher SAT score would lead to 5.2 percent higher earnings in 2007 for those with 
24:592:49270:28:28:72:540:543:144:Times:144:Times:average parental education of 12 years (equivalent to graduating from high school); however, for 
24:593:49367:28:27:72:503:515:144:Times:144:Times:those whose parents averaged 16 years of education (approximately equivalent to college 
24:594:49455:27:28:72:542:488:144:Times:144:Times:graduates), there was virtually no return to attending a more selective college. Similar to Dale and 
24:595:49556:28:27:72:520:460:144:Times:144:Times:Krueger (2002), we also found a negative interaction between predicted parental income and 
24:596:49647:27:28:72:509:433:144:Times:144:Times:school average SAT score, though for most years, the interaction term was not statistically 
24:597:49739:28:75:72:143:405:144:Times:144:Times:significant.      
24:598:49757:75:28:107:543:330:144:Times:144:Times: Consistent with the past literature, we find a positive and significant effect of the return to 
24:599:49853:28:27:72:541:302:144:Times:144:Times:college selectivity during a student’s prime working years in regression models that do not adjust 
24:600:49952:27:28:72:489:275:144:Times:144:Times:for unobserved student quality for cohorts that entered college in 1976 and 1989 using 
24:601:50039:28:27:72:525:247:144:Times:144:Times:administrative earnings data from the SSA’s Detailed Earnings Records. Based on these same 
24:602:50130:27:28:72:537:220:144:Times:144:Times:regression specifications, we also find that the return to selectivity increases over the course of a 
24:603:50232:28:28:72:527:192:144:Times:144:Times:student’s career. However, after we adjust for unobserved student characteristics, the return to 
24:604:50329:28:30:72:538:164:144:Times:144:Times:college selectivity falls dramatically. For the 1976 cohort, the return to school-SAT score for the 
24:605:50429:30:8:216:218:134:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:                                                           
24:606:50487:8:18:72:539:126:65:Times:99:Times:18  Average years of parental education was equal to the average of the mother’s and father’s education; if data were 
24:607:50605:18:11:72:542:108:99:Times:99:Times:missing for one parent, the average was set equal to the years of education for the parent for whom data were available. 
24:608:50726:11:11:72:522:97:99:Times:99:Times:The 13 students in the 1989 cohort and 22 students in the 1976 cohort that were missing education data for both 
24:609:50838:11:12:72:258:86:99:Times:99:Times:parents were excluded from these regressions. 
24:610:50883:12:0:72:74:74:99:Times:99:Times: 
25:611:50886:0:28:72:535:709:144:Times:144:Times:full sample is always indistinguishable from zero when we control for the average SAT score of 
25:612:50981:28:27:72:543:681:144:Times:144:Times:the colleges that students applied to in order to control for omitted student variables. Similarly, the 
25:613:51085:27:28:72:532:654:144:Times:144:Times:returns to other college characteristics (the Barron’s Index and net tuition) are substantial in the 
25:614:51186:28:28:72:519:626:144:Times:144:Times:basic model that controls for commonly observed student characteristics but small and never 
25:615:51278:28:27:72:535:598:144:Times:144:Times:statistically distinguishable from zero in the self-revelation model, which (partially) controls for 
25:616:51379:27:38:71:221:571:144:Times:144:Times:unobserved student variables.   
25:617:51411:38:27:107:541:533:144:Times:144:Times: There were noteworthy exceptions for subgroups. First, for the 1989 cohort, the estimates 
25:618:51501:27:28:71:526:506:144:Times:144:Times:indicate a positive return to attending a more selective school for black and Hispanic students, 
25:619:51598:28:28:71:533:478:144:Times:144:Times:which is robust in the selection-adjusted model.    Second, our results suggest that students from 
25:620:51697:28:27:71:542:450:144:Times:144:Times:disadvantaged family backgrounds (in terms of educational attainment) experience a higher return 
25:621:51794:27:28:71:507:423:144:Times:144:Times:to attending a selective college than those from more advantaged family backgrounds. For 
25:622:51883:28:27:71:530:395:144:Times:144:Times:example, for the 1989 cohort, our estimates from the selection-adjusted model imply a positive 
25:623:51978:27:28:71:536:368:144:Times:144:Times:return to attending a more selective college for students who had parents with an average of less 
25:624:52076:28:28:71:542:340:144:Times:144:Times:than 16 years of schooling; however, the return to attending a more selective college was zero (or 
25:625:52175:28:27:71:536:312:144:Times:144:Times:even negative) for students whose parents averaged 16 or more years of education. One possible 
25:626:52270:27:28:72:543:285:144:Times:144:Times:explanation for this pattern is that while most students who apply to selective colleges may be able

25:628:52461:27:28:72:506:230:144:Times:144:Times:opportunities that become available from attending a selective college may be particularly 
25:629:52552:28:38:72:495:202:144:Times:144:Times:valuable for black and Hispanic students, and for students from less educated families.   
25:630:52642:38:27:108:543:164:144:Times:144:Times: Contrary to expectations, our estimates do not suggest that the return to college selectivity 
25:631:52735:27:28:72:520:137:144:Times:144:Times:(within the set of C&B schools) increased for students who entered college more recently, as 
25:632:52827:28:27:72:543:109:144:Times:144:Times:estimates for the 1976 and 1989 cohort are similar when we compare the returns for each cohort at 
25:633:52925:27:0:72:531:82:144:Times:144:Times:a similar stage relative to college-entry (approximately 18 to 19 years after the students entered 
26:634:53027:0:28:72:539:709:144:Times:144:Times:college). Specifically, for the 1976 and 1989 cohorts, attending a college with a 100-point higher 
26:635:53126:28:27:72:542:681:144:Times:144:Times:SAT score lead to students receive about 6 percent higher earnings (in 1995 and 2007 respectively) 
26:636:53225:27:28:72:527:654:144:Times:144:Times:according to results from the basic model; for both cohorts, this return was close to zero in our 
26:637:53323:28:38:72:197:626:144:Times:144:Times:selection-adjusted model. 
26:638:53349:38:27:108:527:588:144:Times:144:Times: Several caveats should be borne in mind in interpreting our findings. First, the analysis 
26:639:53439:27:28:72:542:561:144:Times:144:Times:does not pertain to a nationally representative sample of schools, as the sample is derived from the 
26:640:53540:28:27:71:502:533:144:Times:144:Times:27 colleges and universities in the C&B dataset, the majority of which are very selective. 
26:641:53631:27:28:71:542:506:144:Times:144:Times:However, estimates of the return to school selectivity based on the C&B dataset were similar to -- 
26:642:53729:28:28:71:521:478:144:Times:144:Times:indeed, slightly higher than -- those based on a nationally representative dataset, the National 
26:643:53826:28:27:71:525:450:144:Times:144:Times:Longitudinal Study (NLS) of the High School Class of 1972 (see Dale and Krueger, 2002). In 
26:644:53917:27:28:71:516:423:144:Times:144:Times:addition, Dale and Krueger (2002) found an insignificant payoff to attending more selective 
26:645:54009:28:37:71:422:395:144:Times:144:Times:schools when they used the NLS to estimate the self-revelation model.     
26:646:54083:37:28:107:541:358:144:Times:144:Times: Second, the estimates from the selection-adjusted models are imprecise, especially for the 
26:647:54174:28:28:71:528:330:144:Times:144:Times:1989 cohort. Thus, even though the point-estimates for the return to school quality are close to 
26:648:54271:28:27:71:528:302:144:Times:144:Times:zero, the upper-bound of the 95 percent confidence intervals for these estimates are sometimes 
26:649:54366:27:28:71:542:275:144:Times:144:Times:sizeable. Nonetheless, our results do imply that estimates that do not adjust for unobserved student 
26:650:54467:28:27:71:532:247:144:Times:144:Times:characteristics are biased upward. Indeed, the finding that the average SAT score of the highest 
26:651:54564:27:28:71:524:220:144:Times:144:Times:ranked school that rejected a student is a much stronger predictor of that student’s subsequent 
26:652:54660:28:28:71:543:192:144:Times:144:Times:earnings than the average SAT score of the school the student actually attended should give pause 
26:653:54758:28:27:71:487:164:144:Times:144:Times:to those who interpret conventional regression-based estimates of the effect of college 
26:654:54846:27:0:71:361:137:144:Times:144:Times:characteristics as causal effects of the colleges themselves.  
27:655:54911:0:28:108:533:709:144:Times:144:Times: Finally, it is possible that our estimates are affected by students sorting into the colleges 
27:656:55005:28:27:72:526:681:144:Times:144:Times:they attended from their set of options based on their unobserved earnings potential. About 35 
27:657:55100:27:28:72:527:654:144:Times:144:Times:percent of the students in each cohort in our sample did not attend the most selective school to 
27:658:55196:28:397:72:207:626:144:Times:65:Times:which they were admitted.19
27:659:55223:397:0:216:219:229:144:Times:144:Times:  
27:660:55223:0:28:207:537:626:144:Times:144:Times:  Our analysis indicates that students who were more likely to attend 
27:661:55293:28:27:72:520:598:144:Times:144:Times:the most selective school to which they were admitted had observable characteristics that are 
27:662:55387:27:28:72:543:571:144:Times:144:Times:associated with higher earnings potential. If unobserved characteristics bear a similar relationship 
27:663:55488:28:28:72:542:543:144:Times:144:Times:to college choice, then our already-small estimates of the payoff from attending a selective college 
27:664:55589:28:27:72:512:515:144:Times:144:Times:would be biased upward. It is also possible that the benefit in terms of future earnings from 
27:665:55683:27:28:72:530:488:144:Times:144:Times:attending a selective college varies across students, and that students sort into college based on 
27:666:55782:28:27:72:542:460:144:Times:144:Times:their perceived benefit. For example, students who expect a lucrative career because they intend to 
27:667:55882:27:28:72:542:433:144:Times:144:Times:earn an M.B.A. after college may sort into less selective undergraduate colleges. If students sort on 
27:668:55984:28:28:71:538:405:144:Times:144:Times:the basis of their idiosyncratic return from attending a selective college, then equation (1) cannot 
27:669:56085:28:27:71:518:377:144:Times:144:Times:be given a causal interpretation. However, if this is the case, then our results suggest that the 
27:670:56183:27:28:71:542:350:144:Times:144:Times:typical student does not unambiguously benefit from attending the most selective college to which 
27:671:56281:28:27:71:525:322:144:Times:144:Times:he or she was admitted. Rather, our results would suggest that students need to think carefully 
27:672:56377:27:28:71:542:295:144:Times:144:Times:about the fit between their abilities and interests, the attributes of the school they attend, and their 
27:673:56482:28:144:71:166:267:144:Times:144:Times:career aspirations.

27:677:56793:11:12:72:541:86:99:Times:99:Times:students in the C&B sample used in Dale and Krueger (2002) did not attend the most selective college to which they 
27:678:56908:12:0:72:364:74:99:Times:99:Times:were admitted (similar to the results for the sample used in this paper).

32:1158:65161:16:11:72:722:222:81:Times:81:Times:Notes: Estimates are drawn from weighted least squares regressions that control for age, race, student SAT score, a dummy for whether student SAT score was missing, 
32:1159:65325:11:10:126:722:211:81:Times:81:Times:high school grade point average, a dummy for whether high school grade point average is missing, predicted parental income and student athlete. Weights were used 
32:1160:65487:10:10:126:722:201:81:Times:81:Times:to make the sample representative of the population of students at the C&B schools.  Each cell corresponds to a different regression.  Standard errors are in brackets 
32:1161:65654:10:11:126:724:191:81:Times:81:Times:and  are  robust  to  correlated  errors  among  students  who  attended  the  same  institutions.  Minimum  wage  threshold  is  equal  to  $13,822  in  2007  dollars.  The  top  
32:1162:65834:11:10:126:722:180:81:Times:81:Times:earnings category for the C&B data (greater than $200,000) was assigned a value of $242,662 (see text for details).  For comparison purposes, we topcoded the SSA 
32:1163:65995:10:12:126:392:170:81:Times:81:Times:data in the same way as the C&B data were topcoded in columns 5 and 6.

37:1528:76804:11:10:126:544:296:81:Times:81:Times:dummy  indicating  if  student  SAT  score  was  missing,  student's  high  school  grade  point  average,    a  dummy  
37:1529:76924:10:10:126:540:286:81:Times:81:Times:indicating if high school grade point average was missing, and whether the student was a college athlete; the self-
37:1530:77039:10:11:126:543:276:81:Times:81:Times:revelation model also controls for the average SAT score of the schools to which the student applied and dummies 
37:1531:77152:11:10:126:543:265:81:Times:81:Times:for the number of applications the student submitted. Two sets of standard errors are reported, one in parentheses 
37:1532:77267:10:10:126:543:255:81:Times:81:Times:and  one  in  brackets.  Standard  errors  in  brackets  are  robust  to  correlated  errors  among  students  who  attended  the  
37:1533:77398:10:11:126:543:245:81:Times:81:Times:same institution. The dependent variable for the 1989 cohort is the log(2007 earnings), and for the 1976 cohort is 
37:1534:77513:11:10:126:544:234:81:Times:81:Times:the  median  [log  (1993  annual  earnings)  through  log  (1997  annual  earnings)].  Individuals  are  excluded  if  their

37:1536:77769:11:10:125:543:213:81:Times:81:Times:2007  dollars.  The  parental  education  measure is  the  average  of  the  mother's  and  father's  education;  if  data  was  
37:1537:77898:10:10:125:543:203:81:Times:81:Times:missing  for  one  parent,  the  average  was  set  equal  to  the  years  of  education  of  the  parent  with  data.    Individuals  
37:1538:78033:10:11:125:543:193:81:Times:81:Times:with  no  parental  education  data  for  either  parent  are  excluded  from  the  regression.  The  average  (and  standard

38:1602:79205:16:10:72:543:209:81:Times:81:Times:Notes: The  C&B  Survey  in  1989  included  only  a  subset  of  schools  included  in  the  1976  Survey.  For  both  cohorts,  the  
38:1603:79339:10:11:125:541:199:81:Times:81:Times:sample is weighted to make the sample representative of the population of students attending the C&B institutions. 
38:1604:79454:11:10:125:543:188:81:Times:81:Times:Net tuition for 1970 and 1980 was calculated by subtracting the average aid awarded to undergraduates from the 
38:1605:79565:10:10:125:542:178:81:Times:81:Times:sticker price tuition, as reported in the eleventh and twelfth editions of American Universities and Colleges. Then, 
38:1606:79682:10:11:125:542:168:81:Times:81:Times:the 1976 net tuition was interpolated from the 1970 and 1980 net tuition, assuming an exponential rate of growth. 
38:1607:79796:11:19:125:504:157:81:Times:81:LucidaSans:Net tuition for the 1989 cohort was drawn from the 14th Edition of American Universities and Colleges.
