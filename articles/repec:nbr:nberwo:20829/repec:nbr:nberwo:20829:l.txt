2:31:1560:28:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:Beginning in the 1880s, southern states introduced pensions for Confederate veterans and widows.
2:32:1656:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:They continued to expand these programs through the 1920s, while states outside the region were
2:33:1751:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:introducing cash transfer programs for workers, poor mothers, and the elderly. Using legislative documents,
2:34:1858:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:application records for Confederate pensions, and county-level census and electoral data, we argue
2:35:1956:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:that political considerations guided the enactment and distribution of these pensions. We show that
2:36:2055:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:Confederate pensions programs were introduced and funded during years in which Democratic gubernatorial
2:37:2158:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:candidates were threatened at the ballot box. Moreover, we offer evidence that pensions were disbursed
2:38:2260:14:42:72:512:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:to counties in which these candidates had lost ground to candidates from alternative parties.

3:53:2580:0:32:72:185:709:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:1    Introduction
3:54:2597:32:20:72:540:677:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, U.S. states introduced cash transfer programs for the
3:55:2697:20:20:72:540:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:needy.  Such programs included Mothers’ Pensions for poor single parents, Workers’ Compensation
3:56:2792:20:21:72:540:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for men who became disabled on the job, and Old Age Pensions for the elderly.  By the 1920s, most
3:57:2889:21:20:72:540:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:states had passed aid legislation and begun administering cash transfers.  The notable exception
3:58:2985:20:20:72:540:596:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:was the South, which overwhelmingly failed to administer aid to mothers, workers, or the elderly,
3:59:3082:20:21:72:540:576:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:even in rare cases when aid programs were approved by state legislatures.1Instead, southern states
3:60:3180:21:20:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:widely  enacted  and  funded  Confederate  pension  programs,  which  were  modest  income  support
3:61:3279:20:20:72:540:535:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:programs for Confederate veterans and widows.  These programs were typically enacted during the
3:62:3374:20:20:72:540:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:late 1880s and early 1890s, but southern state legislatures continued to expand them through the
3:63:3470:20:21:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:1920s. Using newly compiled data on pension legislation, expenditures, and applications, we explore
3:64:3569:21:20:72:540:474:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the political factors that motivated southern states to introduce, fund, and disburse Confederate
3:65:3666:20:20:72:540:454:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:pensions.  As such, we offer new information on the development of the welfare state in the South.
3:66:3764:20:21:88:539:434:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:A major contribution of this paper is to provide the first cross-state accounting of the passage
3:67:3860:21:20:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and  distribution  of  Confederate  pensions.   More  broadly,  this  study  offers  new  insight  into  the
3:68:3968:20:20:72:540:393:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:economic  history  of  income  redistribution  in  the  region.   The  leading  explanation  for  southern
3:69:4074:20:21:72:540:373:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:states’ reluctance to adopt the types of welfare programs typical to other parts of the county is
3:70:4171:21:20:72:540:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that the political process in the South was captured by white rural elites.  Alston and Ferrie (1993;
3:71:4272:20:20:72:540:332:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:1999) write that paternalism – in which workers trade loyalty to their employer for nonmarket goods
3:72:4371:20:21:72:540:312:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:such as old-age assistance without an explicit contract – reduced turnover costs and increased work
3:73:4470:21:20:72:540:291:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:effort in cotton agriculture.  They argue that rural elites in the South actively blocked the adoption
3:74:4572:20:20:72:540:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of welfare programs because these programs would have disrupted the paternalistic employment
3:75:4664:20:21:72:540:251:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:contracts  they  had  with  their  workers.   Moreover,  southern  politicians  did  not  need  to  cater  to
3:76:4773:21:20:72:540:230:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:low income voters by enacting income redistribution programs because the Democratic party had
3:77:4866:20:20:72:540:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:effectively quashed all political opposition, through measures taken to disenfranchise poor and black
3:78:4967:20:21:72:326:190:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:voters [Kousser (1974), Margo (1990), Naidu (2012)].
3:79:5019:21:20:88:539:169:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We argue that Confederate pension programs provide a bridge between the standard view of
3:80:5107:20:20:72:540:149:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the  post-Reconstruction  South  and  conventional  economic  models  of  income  redistribution  in  a
3:81:5210:20:16:72:540:129:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:democracy.   Typically,  the  economic  literature  on  income  redistribution  argues  that  voter  pref-
3:82:5316:16:15:84:539:113:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:1Some southern states enacted legislation to provide Mothers’ Pensions but never actually awarded cash transfers
3:83:5428:15:11:72:540:98:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:to  poor  mothers.   For  example,  Arkansas  passed  a  program  in  1917  but  never  provided  aid  to  the  poor  (source:
3:84:5554:11:0:72:298:87:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:http://individual.utoronto.ca/sharieli/historymp.html).
4:85:5610:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:erences  matter  in  determining  policy.   The  most  basic  model  of  redistributive  policies  is  due  to
4:86:5720:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Meltzer and Richards (1981) who argue that policy is determined by the median voter:  high taxes
4:87:5816:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and redistributive programs emerge when the median voter becomes poorer relative to the mean.
4:88:5909:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Related literature,  surveyed in Alesina and Giuliano (2009),  suggests additional determinants of
4:89:6007:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:popular preferences for redistribution, including expectations of future mobility, direct and indirect
4:90:6109:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:preferences for inequality, and notions of “fairness.”  Other work explores the use of public funds to
4:91:6211:20:21:72:539:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cater to specific voting groups.2Cascio and Washington (2013) show that the Voting Rights Act
4:92:6304:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of 1965 increased the quantity of public funds disbursed to black communities, arguing that this
4:93:6400:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:occurred because of politicians’ desire to court black voters.  They argue that newly enfranchised
4:94:6498:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:black voters were an attractive group to target because they were “both geographically identifiable
4:95:6597:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and  tended  to  vote  cohesively”  (p.   5).   What  these  accounts  have  in  common  is  the  idea  that
4:96:6705:20:20:72:454:485:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:redistributive policies are introduced specifically to cater to voters’ preferences.3
4:97:6790:20:21:88:539:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We show that southern legislators did use a type of redistributive program – Confederate pen-
4:98:6883:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sions – to appeal to voters.  In support of this argument,  we offer evidence that southern states
4:99:6981:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:introduced and funded these pensions during years when Democratic gubernatorial candidates were
4:100:7076:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:threatened, and they distributed pensions to politically expedient counties.  The fact that southern
4:101:7176:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:states chose to redistribute income in the form of Confederate pensions, which were narrowly tai-
4:102:7273:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:lored to whites who were inclined to support the Democrats and unlikely to work as farm laborers,
4:103:7370:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is highly consistent with the existing literature on southern politics during this period.  However,
4:104:7470:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:by demonstrating that southern Democrats responded to electoral pressure through patronage of
4:105:7563:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:any  kind  (rather  than  solely  through  repressive  measures),  we  offer  a  somewhat  more  nuanced
4:106:7667:20:21:72:444:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:perspective on politics and the development of the welfare state in the region.
4:107:7746:21:16:88:539:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In this paper, we compile new data on Confederate pension legislation, spending, and individual
4:108:7841:16:14:84:539:245:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:2See Scott (2000), Cox and McCubbins (1986), and Dixit and Londregan (1996) for theoretical discussions of the
4:109:7951:14:7:72:280:231:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:use of income redistribution for political patronage.
4:110:8004:7:15:84:539:224:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:3There  is  a  large  literature  on  the  political  economy  of  income  support  programs  in  the  United  States  during
4:111:8129:15:11:72:540:209:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Eli (2014) examines the distribution of Union Army pensions and finds that
4:112:8244:11:11:72:540:198:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:larger pensions were awarded to veterans in contested congressional districts.  Eli argues that the Republican party
4:113:8360:11:11:72:540:187:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:used this program to buy veterans’ votes.  Skocpol (1992) argues that the passage of Mothers’ Pensions, which were
4:114:8474:11:11:72:540:176:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:state welfare programs for women with dependent children prior to 1935, were the result of the increasing ability of
4:115:8590:11:11:72:540:165:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:women’s clubs, who were united across social class, to press for aid.  Fishback and Kantor (1998) explore the adoption
4:116:8708:11:11:72:540:154:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:of Workers’ Compensation Laws across states and show that employers and insurance companies, as opposed to just
4:117:8819:11:11:72:540:143:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:employees, significantly gained from the law’s passage because they were able to pass the costs of higher post-accident
4:118:8938:11:11:72:540:132:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:compensation on to workers by lowering wages.  Workers benefitted because they had difficulty purchasing desired
4:119:9050:11:11:72:540:121:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:levels of accident insurance in the period [Fishback and Kantor (1998), p.  3].  While there is ample evidence that
4:120:9165:11:11:72:540:110:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:redistributive programs were used for political purposes during the 19th and early 20th centuries, this tendency seems
4:121:9283:11:11:72:540:99:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:to have declined by the mid to late 20th century.  Bailey and Duquette (2014) show that the distribution of funds for
4:122:9400:11:0:72:440:88:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:War of Poverty programs during the Johnson administration was not politically motivated.

5:124:9583:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:election returns.  We use these data to measure the effect of recent voting behavior – the share of the
5:125:9686:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:gubernatorial vote going to Republican or third party candidates – on the probability of passing an
5:126:9785:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:initial pension law, the percentage of state expenditures allocated to pensions, and the distribution
5:127:9886:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of pension funds within states.  While other studies have discussed Confederate pension programs
5:128:9982:20:20:72:539:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in individual states,4this is the first large, cross-state analysis of these programs.  Moreover, it is
5:129:10085:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the first study to use a large sample of individual pension applications to explore the geography of
5:130:10185:21:20:72:298:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Confederate pension applications within states.
5:131:10232:20:20:88:539:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We use the number of Confederate pension applications filed at the county-year level as our
5:132:10323:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:primary  measure  of  the  allocation  of  pension  funds  within  states.   Because  of  the  nature  of  the
5:133:10433:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:application records we are using, we view the number of applications filed from a county in a given
5:134:10532:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:year  as  a  noisy  measure  of  the  number  of  applications  from  that  county  in  that  year  that  were
5:135:10642:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:approved.  Moreover, we have reason to believe that county officials directly influenced the number
5:136:10741:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of applications forwarded to state pension boards, which we will discuss in detail in a later section.
5:137:10843:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:As such,  an increase in applications from a given county likely reflects the Democrats’ desire to
5:138:10941:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:patronize that county.  We take steps to rule out alternative explanations for a correlation between
5:139:11041:21:20:72:314:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:voting behavior and county-level application rates.
5:140:11092:20:20:88:539:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We find that the states were most likely to pass initial Confederate pension laws after a guber-
5:141:11188:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:natorial election in which there was a small spike in third party or Republican vote share.  Similarly,
5:142:11291:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the fraction of state expenditures on Confederate pensions significantly increased after third party
5:143:11391:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:or Republican gubernatorial candidates saw an increase in vote share.  Within states, the number
5:144:11487:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of applications from a county increased after that county experienced an increase in votes to third
5:145:11586:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:party or Republican candidates.  Importantly, this finding is robust to controlling for county-level
5:146:11686:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:economic indicators,  which suggests that political patronage drives this result.  Finally,  we show
5:147:11786:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that, in Texas, pensions were less likely to be rejected in counties in which third party candidates
5:148:11886:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:had  done  well  in  the  most  recent  election.   Taken  together,  we  feel  this  is  strong  evidence  that
5:149:11998:20:16:72:392:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:southern Democrats used Confederate pensions to maintain power.

6:154:12403:32:28:72:268:677:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:2.1    Civil War Military Pensions
6:155:12437:28:20:72:540:649:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:During the Civil War, the federal government passed the General Law of 1862 that allowed Union
6:156:12531:20:20:72:540:629:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Army veterans and their dependents to apply for pensions if their illnesses or injuries were shown
6:157:12629:20:21:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to be the result of their war experience.  Beginning in 1890,  Union Army veterans could receive
6:158:12725:21:20:72:539:588:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:pensions for any illness or injury that left the veteran unable to undertake manual labor.5By 1900,
6:159:12824:20:20:72:540:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:95% of Union Army veterans were collecting benefits of a little over $12 per month on average, an
6:160:12921:20:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:amount that is roughly equivalent to 50% of a farmer’s monthly earnings in the period.  The receipt
6:161:13020:20:21:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of Union Army pensions has been shown to increase the likelihood of retirement [Costa (1995)],
6:162:13114:21:20:72:540:507:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to facilitate the movement of veterans to less crowded living arrangements [Costa (1997)], and to
6:163:13211:20:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:decrease morbidity and mortality rates [Eli (2014)].  With regard to widows of Union Army soldiers,
6:164:13310:20:21:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the pension has been shown to lower the rate of remarriage by 25% [Salisbury (2014)].  Therefore,
6:165:13407:21:20:72:540:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the Union Army pension system – America’s first wide-scale entitlement program – had profound
6:166:13500:20:20:72:169:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:demographic effects.
6:167:13520:20:21:88:539:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Confederate veterans, however, were never allowed access to pensions from the federal govern-
6:168:13613:21:20:72:540:385:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ment.  Instead, individual southern states enacted their own pension systems.  While the Democrats
6:169:13711:20:20:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:had largely regained control of state legislatures by 1876, they did not start passing pension legis-
6:170:13812:20:21:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:lation in earnest until the mid 1880s.  Most existing work explains the emergence of Confederate
6:171:13908:21:20:72:540:324:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:pension laws by the fact that Confederate veterans and widows could not access Union Army pen-
6:172:14002:20:20:72:540:304:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sions, taking for granted that southern states would step in to fill this gap.  Other work points to
6:173:14102:20:21:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the elevated social position of Confederate veterans and widows in the South to explain why these
6:174:14199:21:20:72:277:263:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:states were willing to fund these programs.
6:175:14242:20:20:88:539:243:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Details  of  the  passage  of  Confederate  pension  legislation  are  summarized  in  table  1.   States
6:176:14347:20:21:72:540:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:differed in terms of precise eligibility requirements; however, features common to all state programs
6:177:14448:21:20:72:540:202:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are  apparent.   Pension  programs  typically  included  a  means  test,  a  residency  restriction,  and  a
6:178:14556:20:20:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:remarriage prohibition for widows, although there is considerable cross-state variation in the nature
6:179:14657:20:21:72:540:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of  these  restrictions.   For  example,  the  original  pension  law  passed  in  Texas  in  1899  required
6:180:14765:21:20:72:540:141:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:applicants to have been Texas residents since 1880, while North Carolina, Mississippi and Virginia
6:181:14863:20:20:72:540:121:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:merely  required  applicants  to  be  state  residents  at  the  time  of  application.   Pension  amounts
6:182:14969:20:16:72:540:101:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:different substantially by state, ranging from a low of $15 per year in Georgia to a high of $300
6:183:15066:16:0:84:363:85:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:A:5For a review of Union Army Pension legislation, see Glasson (1916).
7:184:15135:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:per  year  in  Tennessee.   While  many  states  initially  required  applicants  to  have  been  injured  or
7:185:15244:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:widowed during the war, by the turn of the century most pension programs functioned essentially
7:186:15339:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:as  welfare  for  Confederate  veterans  and  widows.   Much  like  the  Union  Army  pension,  southern
7:187:15443:20:21:72:416:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:pension programs had evolved to cover all veterans and widows in need.
7:188:15513:21:20:88:539:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Although Confederate pensions were substantially less generous than the Union Army pension,
7:189:15604:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:expenditure on these programs comprised a significant fraction of state budgets [Gorman (1999);
7:190:15699:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Short  (2006);  Ratchford  and  Heise  (1938)].   Appendix  figures  (1)  and  (2)  report  the  number  of
7:191:15806:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:pension applications filed in each year,  as well as the percentage of state expenditures allocated
7:192:15905:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to  pensions,  separately  by  state.   These  figures  indicate  that  these  programs  were  widely  taken
7:193:16013:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:up, with thousands of new applications filed form each state in most years.  Data on fractions of
7:194:16110:21:20:72:539:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:state budgets allocated to pensions comes from southern state treasurers’ annual reports.6Again,
7:195:16206:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:these figures indicate that states spent significant quantities of money on these programs, typically
7:196:16307:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:peaking at between 10 and 20 percent of the budget during the first two decades of the 20th century.
7:197:16407:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:It is notable that spending on Confederate programs peaked while northern states were introducing
7:198:16504:20:20:72:213:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:other cash transfer programs.
7:199:16533:20:21:88:539:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The administration of Confederate pension programs was fairly uniform across states.  Claims
7:200:16625:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:were evaluated first at the county level, by designated county pension boards.  After being reviewed
7:201:16725:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:locally, claims were submitted to a state pension board which reviewed them a second time and
7:202:16818:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rendered a final judgement on the merit of each case.  After approval by the state board, the state
7:203:16917:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:treasurer would issue a warrant for each claim on the treasury.  So,  while initial adjudication of
7:204:17016:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:pension  claims  was  done  at  the  county  level,  pensions  were  paid  out  of  a  central  pension  fund.
7:205:17126:20:21:72:484:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Pension legislation typically introduced a new property tax to fund pension programs.
7:206:17211:21:20:88:539:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Consider, as an example, the pension law in Alabama.  From 1899 onward, claims were assessed
7:207:17303:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:by  a  county  board  of  examiners,  appointed  by  the  governor,  and  consisting  of  one  “practicing
7:208:17409:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:physician of good standing in his profession” and one Confederate veteran “of good moral character”

8:221:18465:29:20:72:540:598:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:During these office hours,  county boards would “subject [applicants] to an oral and physical ex-

8:223:18658:21:20:72:540:557:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:would submit all claims to the state pension board for additional review (SS2011-2013).  The state
8:224:18756:20:20:72:540:537:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:board of examiners consisted of a physician and two ex-Confederate soldiers appointed by the gov-

8:230:19353:20:20:72:540:415:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:pension was funded by “a special tax of one mill on each dollar of the taxable property of the state”
8:231:19454:20:21:72:111:395:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(S2031).
8:232:19462:21:20:88:539:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:There is some evidence of corruption among county pension boards from the historical record.
8:233:19554:20:29:72:513:354:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The 1897 state auditor’s report from Alabama complains about local adjudication practices:
8:234:19644:29:21:99:512:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:This effort of the State to aid these worthy men is being sadly abused.  Applications are
8:235:19733:21:20:99:512:304:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:allowed in a great many instances that should be rejected.  The Boards of Examiners,
8:236:19817:20:20:99:512:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:in some counties, do not appreciate their trust.  They grant applications that they know
8:237:19905:20:21:99:512:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:are  based  upon  false  statements,  thereby  diverting  this  sacred  fund  from  its  proper
8:238:20000:21:20:99:512:243:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:course.  They should feel that every cent improperly allowed is taken from a pittance
8:239:20085:20:20:99:512:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:that is intended for a worthy Confederate soldierwho  is  not  able  to  makea living for
8:240:20174:20:29:99:240:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:himself [White (1897), p.  23].
8:241:20205:29:21:72:540:174:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Blanck and Millender (2000) also discuss the arbitrary power that elected county judges wielded
8:242:20300:21:20:72:540:153:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in  distributing  pensions  in  Virginia.   This  behavior  is  consistent  with  historical  accounts  of  the
8:243:20411:20:20:72:540:133:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:actions  of  county  officials  during  southern  elections.   Kousser  (1974)  discusses  the  tendency  for
8:244:20520:20:21:72:540:113:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:local officials to exert influence over voter registration by altering dates during which registration
8:245:20622:21:20:72:540:92:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:took place and selectively informing constituents of this fact.  He writes that “the county machine
8:246:20721:20:0:72:540:72:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:could always remind its followers of the closing date for registration, but it neglected those voters
9:247:20823:0:37:72:506:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:outside the dominant political structure, or even prevented them from registering” (p.  49).

9:249:20958:27:20:72:540:645:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:By the mid 1870s, the Democratic party had largely regained control of southern politics.  Voting in
9:250:21058:20:21:72:540:625:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the South during the later 19th century cut primarily along racial lines, with white voters supporting
9:251:21160:21:20:72:540:604:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Democrats  and  black  voters  supporting  Republicans  (Ayers  1992).   The  Democratic  party  was
9:252:21260:20:20:72:540:584:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:dominated  by  rural  elites  from  the  Black  Belt  –  the  portion  of  the  South  in  which  plantation
9:253:21368:20:21:72:540:564:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:style agriculture was common.  Alston and Ferrie (1993; 1999) argue that Democratic congressmen
9:254:21463:21:20:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:viewed these elites as their core constituency, and acted explicitly in the best interests of this group.
9:255:21568:20:20:72:540:523:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Legislative  efforts  to  disenfranchise  black  voters  in  the  South  during  this  period,  including  poll
9:256:21679:20:21:72:540:503:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:taxes and literacy tests, are well documented [Kousser (1974), Naidu (2012), Margo (1990)].  These
9:257:21777:21:20:72:540:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:policies began to be enacted in the region during the 1890s but did not become ubiquitous until
9:258:21872:20:20:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:around 1910.  Prior to adopting these policies aimed at disenfranchisement, Democrats employed
9:259:21966:20:21:72:540:442:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:measures  like  gerrymandering,  fraud,  and  voter  intimidation  to  maintain  power  in  the  region,
9:260:22070:21:20:72:540:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:subject  to  some  federal  oversight  up  to  the  mid  1890s  [Naidu  (2012)].   While  these  measures
9:261:22175:20:20:72:540:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:significantly  decreased  turnout  among  black  voters,  southern  elections  were  at  least  somewhat
9:262:22279:20:21:72:540:381:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:competitive  before  legal  disenfranchisement  [Naidu  (2012)].   Importantly,  Confederate  veterans
9:263:22381:21:20:72:540:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:were often exempt from poll taxes.  For example, the Georgia state legislature passed a law in 1882
9:264:22480:20:20:72:519:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:”to relieve crippled and disabled Confederate soldiers from poll tax” [Georgia (1882), p.  120].
9:265:22576:20:21:88:539:320:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:While  the  the  Democratic  party  claimed  a  majority  of  the  southern  white  vote  during  this
9:266:22678:21:20:72:540:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:period, they were at risk of losing vote share to third party candidates. Populist agrarian movements
9:267:22779:20:20:72:540:279:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:were a significant presence in the South during the years following the Civil War.  Beginning in
9:268:22875:20:20:72:540:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Texas  during  the  1870s,  the  Farmer’s  Alliance  had  become  an  important  political  force  in  state
9:269:22983:20:21:72:540:239:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:legislatures by the late 1880s and early 1890s (Woodward 1951).  This movement gained popularity
9:270:23079:21:20:72:540:218:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:among  farmers  in  the  face  of  falling  agricultural  prices  and  a  perceived  lack  of  power  in  their
9:271:23190:20:20:72:539:198:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:dealings with the banks and railroads [Ayers (1992)].7As Woodward (1951) notes, with exception
9:272:23284:20:21:72:540:178:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of Virginia, the majority of the populist vote came from small, poor, white farmers.  He quotes one
9:273:23383:21:20:72:540:157:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:account of the movement in Alabama that characterizes it as “an effort of the masses of the white
9:274:23480:20:20:72:540:137:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to free themselves from the rule of the black-belt Democratic party of the old slave-owning type”
9:275:23577:20:17:72:540:117:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(p 247).  Moreover, populist movements in the South during this period seemed to directly threaten
9:276:23675:17:15:84:539:100:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:7For a discussion of economic conditions in the South during this period, see Wright (1986).  See Goldin and Lewis

10:280:24103:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:them were ‘ex-democrats whose standing in the party was formerly as undisputed’ ” (Woodward
10:281:24194:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:1951, p 247).  Maintaining vote share among smaller white farmers at risk of voting for populist
10:282:24290:21:43:72:480:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:candidates would have been an important political objective for southern Democrats.

10:287:24695:20:21:72:539:492:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:primary and secondary sources,8and is summarized in table 1.  We obtain state balance sheet data
10:288:24791:21:20:71:540:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from published annual reports to state treasurers, which are accessed from Hathi Trust.9This allow

10:290:24973:20:20:88:539:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Individual  pension  data  consists  of  indexes  to  Confederate  pension  applications,  which  are
10:291:25074:20:21:71:539:411:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:available online from southern state archives.10In recent years, complete collections of Confederate
10:292:25174:21:20:71:539:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:pension files have been made publicly available through genealogical websites such as ancestry.com
10:293:25272:20:20:71:539:370:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and  familysearch.org.   These  files  are  indexed,  either  in  hard  copy  or  at  state  archive  websites.
10:294:25383:20:21:71:539:350:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We have obtained these indexes for nine states:  Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky,

10:297:25680:20:21:71:539:289:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:indexes varies by state.  In general, the index will indicate the name of the applicant, the type of
10:298:25780:21:20:71:539:268:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:application (veteran or widow), and the county of application.  In some cases, the indexes contain
10:299:25878:20:20:71:539:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:additional information, such as year of application, details of the soldier’s military service, and the
10:300:25981:20:21:71:539:228:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:outcome  of  the  pension  application.   Appendix  table  2  lists  the  number  of  pension  applications

11:311:26921:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from Haines and ICPSR (2010) and county-level data on gubernatorial election returns from the
11:312:27014:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ICPSR (1999).  We use the county-level census data to determine characteristics of counties from
11:313:27110:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:which Confederate veterans and widows applied for pensions,  i.e.  population,  race composition,
11:314:27207:20:21:72:539:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:prevalence of farming, farm ownership structure, and value of agricultural output.11We use the
11:315:27301:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:election returns data from 1876-1930 to determine the fraction of the gubernatorial vote that went
11:316:27399:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to Democratic, Republican, and third party candidates.  The “third party” designation is assigned
11:317:27496:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to  any  party  that  is  not  classified  as  Democrat/Democrat  equivalent  or  Republican/Republican
11:318:27599:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:equivalent.   These  were  generally  left-leaning  and  appealed  to  lower  income  farmers  and  labor-
11:319:27705:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ers.  Specific parties that appear frequently include the Communists, the Greenbacks, the People’s
11:320:27803:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Party, the Populists, Progressives, the Prohibition Party, Socialists, and Socialist-Labor.  We use
11:321:27902:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:gubernatorial elections as our baseline measure of voting behavior for two reasons:  these data are
11:322:28001:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:available at the county level, and they pertain to state elections rather than federal elections.  Hav-
11:323:28104:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ing county-level data on vote shares is important because it allows us to observe counties in which
11:324:28203:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Democrats were losing ground to other parties.  Having data on state elections is important because
11:325:28302:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:these pensions were state-level programs, so we should expect them to be responsive to state rather
11:326:28401:20:44:72:393:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:than federal voting patterns (although these are highly correlated).
11:327:28469:44:31:72:238:360:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:4    Empirical Approach
11:328:28492:31:20:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We are interested in exploring the effect of voting patterns on the enactment of Confederate pen-
11:329:28589:20:20:72:540:309:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sion programs, expenditure on these programs, and the distribution of pension funds within states.
11:330:28687:20:21:72:540:289:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Because the Democrats were almost always in control of state legislatures, we view the Democratic
11:331:28784:21:20:72:540:268:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:party as the sole decision-maker with respect to pensions.  Our hypothesis is that the Democrats
11:332:28880:20:20:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:used Confederate pensions to respond to political threats from other parties.  Specifically, we expect
11:333:28982:20:21:72:540:228:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:them to have enacted pension programs and increased funding for pension programs when alterna-
11:334:29076:21:20:72:540:207:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tive parties gained popularity.  Within states, we expect pension boards (controlled by Democrats)
11:335:29174:20:20:72:540:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to  have  funnelled  pensions  to  counties  in  which  alternative  parties  were  gaining  popularity  as
11:336:29281:20:21:72:540:167:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:well.  This may have occurred for two reasons:  first, Democrats may have been seeking to increase
11:337:29379:21:20:72:540:146:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:turnout among likely Democratic voters in the face of opposition; alternatively, they may have used
11:338:29478:20:20:72:540:126:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:pensions to discourage Confederate veterans from supporting Republican or populist third party
11:339:29572:20:16:72:540:106:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:candidates.  One confounding factor is that these other parties, particularly populist third parties,

12:341:29744:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:gained popularity during times of economic hardship.  As such, it may be that Democrats enacted
12:342:29839:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and funded pension programs when populists gained vote share because they were responding to
12:343:29931:20:20:72:537:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:economic hardship rather than a perceived political threat.  We will address this concern directly.
12:344:30030:20:21:88:539:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We will look at the effect of voting in gubernatorial elections on two classes of outcomes:  (1)
12:345:30126:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:state-level outcomes, which include the passage of Confederate pension legislation and spending on
12:346:30224:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Confederate pensions, and (2) county-level outcomes, namely the distribution of pension applica-
12:347:30320:20:37:72:163:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tions within states.

12:352:30627:21:20:72:539:461:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:program passage, we construct a panel of southern states, beginning in 1876 and ending in 1912,12
12:353:30724:20:37:72:259:441:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:which we use to estimate the following:
12:354:30763:37:36:207:540:404:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:A:Ls,t=α+β1Os,t+β2Rs,t+δt+θs+es,t(1)

12:359:31177:21:20:72:540:286:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from the most recent election, average of vote share over the last two elections, and average of vote
12:360:31278:20:20:72:540:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:share over the last and next elections.  We do this to capture the possibility that state legislatures
12:361:31380:20:21:72:540:246:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:responded to election results with a lag, or that legislatures responded to current public sentiment
12:362:31480:21:20:72:540:225:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:reflected in future election outcomes.13In addition, we allowOs,tandRs,tto affect the probability
12:363:31577:20:20:72:540:205:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of passing a pension law linearly or quadratically.  States exit the sample after they have passed an
12:364:31678:20:16:72:234:185:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:initial piece of pension legislation.
12:365:31715:16:11:80:377:169:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:A:12This is the last year in which a state in our panel passed a pension law.
12:366:31790:11:15:80:539:158:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:13While accurately forecasting election results during the late 19th and early 20th centuries was difficult, attempts
12:367:31907:15:11:72:540:143:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:were made at polling.  Some newspapers conducted straw polls in which thousands of questionnaires were sent out
12:368:32018:11:11:72:540:132:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:and the responses tallied, although these polls were often biased.  Rhode and Strumpf (2004) show that presidential
12:369:32133:11:11:72:540:121:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:betting markets during this period did a surprisingly good job of forecasting election outcomes prior to 1940.  Future
12:370:32251:11:11:72:540:110:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:election results may also important because of the widespread use of primaries in the South, which Kousser (1974)
12:371:32364:11:11:72:539:99:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:argues were used to restrict political competition to competitionwithinthe Democratic party.  These would have
12:372:32474:11:0:72:419:88:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:allowed candidates to gauge popular sentiment immediately in advance of an election.
13:373:32560:0:21:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In  addition  to  exploring  the  relationship  between  gubernatorial  voting  patterns  and  initial
13:374:32662:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:program  passage,  we  examine  the  effect  of  voting  patterns  on  spending  on  Confederate  pension
13:375:32767:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:programs at the state level.  State legislatures frequently amended their original pieces of pension
13:376:32867:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:legislation,  usually  expanding  access  or  pension  amounts;  this  continued  into  the  1920s.   The
13:377:32972:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:simplest way of summarizing changes in state legislatures’ behaviour regarding pensions is to look
13:378:33070:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:at changes in the percentage of a state’s budget that is spent on pensions.  Specifically, we estimate
13:379:33172:20:21:72:136:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the following:
13:380:33186:21:30:207:540:566:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:A:Es,t=α+β1Os,t+β2Rs,t+δt+θs+es,t(2)
13:381:33220:30:20:72:540:536:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Here,Es,tis the fraction of states’s total expenditures in yeartallocated to Confederate pensions.
13:382:33318:20:20:88:539:516:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Because  these  regressions  are  done  at  the  state  level,  we  have  very  few  observations,  which
13:383:33423:20:21:72:540:496:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:makes  it  difficult  to  pin  down  the  Democratic  party’s  precise  motives  for  enacting  and  funding
13:384:33531:21:20:72:540:475:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Confederate pensions.  As discussed earlier, the Democrats may have enacted and expanded access
13:385:33626:20:20:72:540:455:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to pensions in order to buy votes of Confederate veterans and their families.  At the same time, they
13:386:33727:20:21:72:540:435:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:may have been responding to poor economic conditions, which may generate a similar relationship
13:387:33822:21:20:72:540:414:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:between pension outcomes and political variables.  As such, we view these state-level regressions as
13:388:33922:20:36:72:462:394:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:descriptive.  We will address concerns about causality directly in the next section.
13:389:34006:36:28:72:394:358:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:4.2    Distribution of pension applications within states
13:390:34063:28:20:72:540:330:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Our  second  aim  is  to  characterize  the  way  voting  patters  affected  the  distribution  of  pensions
13:391:34171:20:20:72:540:310:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:across counties within states.  Because we view the Democrats as the decision-maker with respect
13:392:34267:20:21:72:540:290:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to pensions, we hypothesize that the Democrats funnelled pension funds to counties in which their
13:393:34364:21:20:72:540:269:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:gubernatorial candidate was threatened.14They may have approved more applications from these
13:394:34456:20:20:72:540:249:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:counties, processed claims from these counties more quickly, or actively solicited applications from
13:395:34556:20:21:72:540:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:these counties.  Our data allows us to observe the number of applications filed from each county in
13:396:34655:21:20:72:540:208:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:our data in each calendar year.  We use this as our primary measure of the distribution of pensions
13:397:34754:20:20:72:136:188:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:within states.
13:398:34768:20:20:88:539:168:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We believe that the number of applications filed from a county in a given year reflects effort on
13:399:34865:20:21:72:540:148:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the part of local authorities to distribute pensions to that county.  This is due to the nature of the
13:400:34967:21:20:72:540:127:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:pension application and review process, described in section (2).  Claims were heard at fixed times
13:401:35066:20:16:72:540:107:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:during  the  year  by  county  pension  boards,  who  exercised  tremendous  influence  on  the  outcome
13:402:35170:16:15:80:539:91:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:14Another plausible explanation is that pensions were used to bolster support for Democratic representatives in
13:403:35281:15:0:72:463:76:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:state legislatures.  This mechanism will yield similar results, as splitting tickets was not common.
14:404:35383:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of an application [Blanck and Millender (2000)].  After initial review, applications were forwarded
14:405:35482:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to the state pension board for further evaluation.  In many cases, pension applications were only
14:406:35579:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:forwarded  to  the  state  board  if  the  county  board  approved  them.   For  example,  the  Arkansas
14:407:35683:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:pension law indicates that application materials were forwarded to state boards “when said board
14:408:35779:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is satisfied with the justness of the claim made by the applicant” [Arkansas (1891), Act XCI S3].
14:409:35876:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Thus, county boards could influence the number of applications in two ways:  (i) by restricting or
14:410:35974:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:expanding access to the board itself during the designated time for hearing pension applications;
14:411:36071:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(ii) by being more or less conservative in the decision to forward an application to the state pension
14:412:36173:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:board.  Because our pension application records are comprised of collections at state archives, they
14:413:36273:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:can be presumed to be comprised primarily of records forwarded to or retained by state pension
14:414:36367:21:20:72:539:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:boards.15As such, we view our count of applications at the county level as a noisy measure of the
14:415:36464:20:20:72:324:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:number of approved applications at the county level.
14:416:36516:20:21:88:539:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:More formally, the number of applications from a given county in a given year depends on two
14:417:36608:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:factors.  First, local economic conditions – such as falling agricultural prices or output – would have
14:418:36711:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:affected the number of people who qualify for the pension, as these pensions were means tested.
14:419:36806:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Second,  political patronage would have affected the number of applications though the channels
14:420:36901:21:36:72:417:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:discussed above.  So, we can write the number of applications as follows:
14:421:36974:36:37:253:358:347:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:?:N=f(X) +g(P) +u
14:422:36989:37:20:72:540:310:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The number of applications (N) is a function of the current economic conditions (f(X)), political
14:423:37086:20:21:72:539:290:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:patronage (g(P)),  and a random component (u).  In principle,  a correlation betweenNand gu-
14:424:37178:21:20:72:540:269:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:bernatorial voting patterns may work through a correlation between voting patterns andg(P) or
14:425:37271:20:20:72:539:249:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:voting patterns andf(X).  Our hypothesis is that the former channel is most important, and we
14:426:37364:20:21:72:289:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:will offer evidence to support this hypothesis.
14:427:37411:21:20:88:539:208:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:To examine the political determinants of pension allocation, we construct a panel of counties,
14:428:37505:20:20:72:540:188:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:beginning in the election year immediately prior to initial program passage, and ending in 1930.
14:429:37601:20:37:72:252:168:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We use this to estimate the following:
14:430:37639:37:17:190:540:131:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:A:Nc,s,t=α+β1Rc,s,t+β2Oc,s,t+φs,t+χc+ec,s,t(3)
14:431:37683:17:15:80:539:114:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:15Even in states in which all applications (whether approved by the county board or not) were forwarded to the
14:432:37793:15:11:72:540:99:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:state  board  for  secondary  review,  only  accepted  pension  claims  were  ultimately  retained.   If  the  county  board’s
14:433:37919:11:11:72:540:88:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:decision had a substantial bearing on the ultimate outcome of a pension application, we are still less likely to observe
14:434:38039:11:0:72:393:77:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:the record of an applicant rejected at the county level in these state collections.

15:440:38616:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:as a change in the law expanding access to pensions, that might affect pension applications for all
15:441:38715:20:21:72:539:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f6:B:counties in that state.  As such,  we are identifying effects of political factors on thewithin-state
15:442:38816:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distribution of these applications.  As in the previous section, we look at the effect of gubernatorial
15:443:38919:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:vote share from the last election as well as average vote share over the last two elections and the
15:444:39018:20:21:72:182:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:last and next elections.
15:445:39042:21:20:88:539:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Of  course,  this  does  not  pin  down  the  channel  through  which  political  variables  affect  the
15:446:39146:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:number  of  pension  applications  to  come  from  a  particular  county.   The  challenge  is  that  we  do
15:447:39254:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:not have data on local economic conditions that vary at the same high frequency as our electoral
15:448:39350:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:data, so we cannot explicitly control for economic indicators in our primary specification.  To argue
15:449:39451:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that  patronage  rather  than  local  economic  conditions  drives  our  results,  we  construct  a  smaller
15:450:39559:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:panel,  taking  a  series  of  snapshots  of  application  rates  and  voting  behavior  around  1880,  1890,
15:451:39668:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:1900, 1910, and 1920.  We match this panel to county-level census data from Haines and ICPSR
15:452:39760:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(2010) to allow us to control for county-level economic indicators that may be jointly correlated with
15:453:39862:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:application rates and gubernatorial voting patterns.  These include measures of agricultural output,
15:454:39962:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the ownership structure in agriculture, and agricultural land inequality.  To use the notation from
15:455:40061:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:above, if the correlation betweenNand electoral variables is primarily working through a correlation
15:456:40161:20:21:72:539:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:between  electoral  variables  andf(X),  then  controlling  for  salient  local  economic  characteristics
15:457:40267:21:36:72:469:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:should dramatically alter the estimated effect of electoral variables on applications.
15:458:40353:36:27:72:349:225:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:4.3    Determinants of pension outcomes:  Texas
15:459:40400:27:20:72:540:198:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The only pension outcome variable that is broadly available at the county level is the number of
15:460:40496:20:21:72:540:178:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:pension applications filed; however, we have additional information about the outcome of pension
15:461:40592:21:20:72:540:157:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:applications from Texas. This is because we have merged two sources of data on pension applications
15:462:40691:20:20:72:540:137:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from Texas:  (i) an index available from the Texas state archives, which contains a list of pension
15:463:40790:20:17:72:540:117:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:applications  and  indicates  whether  these  applications  were  rejected  or  not;  (ii)  an  index  to  the
15:464:40900:17:15:80:539:100:6:g_d0_f4:6:g_d0_f11:F:16Gubernatorial elections typically occur every 2 years.  In the few states in which they occur every 4 years,Nc,s,t
15:465:41016:15:0:71:394:85:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:is defined as the number of applications filed between election yearstandt+ 4.
16:466:41096:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:collection of Texas pension files available at ancestry.com, which contains pension application dates.
16:467:41198:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The key difference between these two indexes is that the first index is based on a list of applications
16:468:41301:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:kept by Texas pension authorities, while the second index is a list of application records that were
16:469:41401:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:physically present in the archives at the time these records were digitized.  We are able to locate
16:470:41500:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:records in the ancestry.com index that match close to 90 percent of the records in the Texas archive
16:471:41600:20:20:72:101:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:index.
16:472:41606:20:21:88:539:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Having access to these two data sources allows us to do two important things.  First, it allows us
16:473:41704:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to directly test our conjecture that our data on pension applications is disproportionately composed
16:474:41804:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of accepted pension applications.  Recall that it was standard practice for state pension boards to
16:475:41903:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:return rejected pension application files to county pension offices after reviewing them.  So, rejected
16:476:42006:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:pension application records should be less likely to be found in surviving archival collections today.
16:477:42108:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:This is one of our reasons for interpreting the number of pension applications from a given county
16:478:42206:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:as a noisy measure of the number of accepted applications from that county.  So, it should be the
16:479:42303:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:case that applications recorded as “rejected” in the state archive index should be less likely to be
16:480:42403:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:linked to the ancestry index.  In fact, we find this to be the case.  Rejected pension records are 5
16:481:42503:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:percentage points less likely to be located in the ancestry pension data, a difference that is highly
16:482:42604:21:20:72:461:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:statistically significant and robust to including county of application fixed effects.
16:483:42690:20:20:88:539:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Another  benefit  from  observing  whether  pensions  were  rejected  is  that  it  allows  us  to  test
16:484:42794:20:37:72:489:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:whether political variables impacted this outcome.  We estimate the following equation:

16:491:43272:32:27:72:294:133:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:5.1    Pension legislation and spending
16:492:43311:27:21:72:540:106:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Table (2) contains estimates of equations (1) and (2).  In the top panel, we investigate the effect
16:493:43410:21:0:72:540:85:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of a state’s share of the most recent gubernatorial vote going to non-Democrats on the probability
17:494:43510:0:21:72:539:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of passing a new pension law.17We do this using a panel in which states exit the sample after
17:495:43603:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:they have introduced new legislation.  Because these regressions are run at the state-year level, we
17:496:43703:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:have a small number of observations to work with.  Still, these results give the impression that new
17:497:43803:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:pension legislation did respond to increases in popularity of alternative party candidates, up to a
17:498:43902:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:point.  When third party and republican vote shares enter into the regression linearly, there is no
17:499:44001:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:evidence of a significant effect, as seen in columns (1), (3) and (5).  However, when these vote shares
17:500:44104:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:enter quadratically, the picture changes somewhat.  In column (2), we can see that the probability
17:501:44202:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of passing new legislation decreases as the most recent vote share to third party candidates deviates
17:502:44303:20:20:72:539:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from about one quarter.18When we measure vote shares as averages across consecutive elections,
17:503:44397:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the coefficients on Republican vote share and squared Republican vote share are more significant,
17:504:44494:21:20:72:410:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:although vote shares to both parties have a qualitatively similar effect.
17:505:44567:20:20:88:539:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:While the findings in the top panel of table (2) are somewhat imprecise, they broadly suggest
17:506:44660:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that state legislatures passed initial pieces of pension legislation following a small spike in the vote
17:507:44764:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:share to parties other than the Democrats.  In figure (1),  we plot a time series of gubernatorial
17:508:44862:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:vote shares to third party candidates (panel A) and Republican candidates (panel B) relative to
17:509:44957:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the date of initial program passage.  In general, this picture supports our findings from table (2);
17:510:45057:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:however,  it  also  indicates  substantial  heterogeneity  across  states  in  the  incidence  and  timing  of
17:511:45167:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:these spikes relative to the passage of new pension laws.  In panel A, it is clear that the passage
17:512:45266:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of initial legislation either follows or coincides with an increase in third party vote share in Texas,
17:513:45369:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Alabama,  Arkansas,  Tennessee,  and  Louisiana;  it  follows  with  a  greater  lag  in  South  Carolina.
17:514:45475:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:However, there is no evidence for this in Florida, North Carolina, Mississippi, or Kentucky.19In
17:515:45571:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:panel B, initial legislation follows or coincides with spikes in Republican vote share in Louisiana,
17:516:45671:21:20:72:526:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Alabama, Arkansas, and, to a lesser degree, Kentucky; Mississippi and Texas follow with a lag.
17:517:45765:20:20:88:539:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In the bottom panel of table (2), we examine the effect of state voting patterns on expenditures
17:518:45861:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on Confederate pension programs.  State legislatures exercised discretion over spending on pensions
17:519:45960:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:by passing amendments to pension laws that expanded access, or by increasing pension amounts.
17:520:46053:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Moreover,  state  pension  boards  would  have  directly  affected  spending  on  pensions  by  raising  or
17:521:46160:20:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:lowering approval standards.  Our results clearly indicate that the rate of spending on Confederate
17:522:46259:21:15:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:pensions increased following spikes in either third party or Republican vote shares.  From column
17:523:46356:15:11:80:510:124:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:A:17Observations are weighted by the fraction of the state’s counties that report electoral data for that year.
17:524:46465:11:15:80:540:113:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:18Using  notation  from  equation  (1),  we  can  write∂Ls,t/∂Os,te=β11+ 2β12Os,te.   Given  our  estimates,  the
17:525:46578:15:7:71:522:98:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:probability of passing an initial piece of pension legislation is maximized with respect toOs,twhenOs,t= 0.25.
17:526:46688:7:15:80:539:91:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:19Georgia and Virginia are omitted from this figure because they are missing gubernatorial election data in the
17:527:46799:15:0:71:286:76:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:years surrounding the passage of program legislation.
18:528:46854:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(1),  a 10 percentage point increase in vote share to either third party or Republican candidates
18:529:46951:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:increased fraction of budget spent on pensions by almost 1 percentage point.  Since this expenditure
18:530:47051:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:was  typically  in  the  10-15%  range,  this  translates  into  a  5-10%  increase  in  the  fraction  of  state
18:531:47164:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:expenditures allocated to Confederate pensions, which quite a large number.  We find no evidence
18:532:47260:21:20:72:208:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that this effect is non-linear.
18:533:47291:20:20:88:539:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:These results suggest that state legislatures were responding to increases in the popularity of
18:534:47386:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Republican or third party candidates when they passed and funded Confederate pension programs.
18:535:47480:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:It is important to point out that,  because we do not have annual data on other potentially im-
18:536:47575:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:portant state-level characteristics, we are unable to pin down the precise mechanism driving these
18:537:47673:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:results.  It may be that democratic state legislatures felt threatened by the popularity of alterna-
18:538:47773:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tive candidates.  However, it is also true that non-Democrats tended to gain popularity in times
18:539:47869:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of economic distress, particularly on the farm.  As mentioned above, these were typically populist
18:540:47967:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:parties.  State legislatures may have been responding to this economic distress, or a desire among
18:541:48065:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:voters for redistributive policies,  rather than a perceived political threat.  As such,  we view our
18:542:48166:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:state-level results as descriptive, and we attempt to deal more thoroughly with causality when we
18:543:48263:20:37:72:288:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:look at pension outcomes at the county level.
18:544:48308:37:27:72:313:367:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:5.2    Distribution of pension applications
18:545:48351:27:20:72:540:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Table (3) contains estimates of equation (2).  Here, we are looking at the effect of voting patterns
18:546:48451:20:21:72:540:320:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on  the  number  of  applications  at  the  county-year  level.   Because  we  have  county  fixed  effects,
18:547:48559:21:20:72:540:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:we are effectively controlling for any permanent county characteristic that may jointly affect both
18:548:48658:20:20:72:540:279:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:application rates and voting behavior. So, we are looking at whether a deviation in voting behaviour
18:549:48758:20:20:72:540:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from a county’s norm induces a deviation in pension application rates from that county’s norm.
18:550:48852:20:21:72:540:239:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Moreover, because we are including state-year fixed effects, our results will not be driven by state-
18:551:48953:21:20:72:540:218:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:wide  trends  in  application  rates  (such  as  the  introduction  of  an  expansionary  amendment  to  a
18:552:49059:20:20:72:540:198:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:pension  law).   Here,  we  are  focusing  on  the  effect  of  local  voting  behavior  on  the  within-state
18:553:49169:20:21:72:220:178:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:allocation of pension resources.
18:554:49201:21:20:88:539:157:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Our results clearly indicate that pension application rates increased in counties that had ex-
18:555:49295:20:20:72:540:137:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:perienced  an  increase  in  third  party  or  Republican  vote  share  in  the  most  recent  gubernatorial
18:556:49403:20:21:72:540:117:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:election.  From column (1), 10% increase in third party vote share relative to Democrats increases
18:557:49501:21:20:72:540:96:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:expected applications by more than 1.  Given that the mean number of applications to be filed in
18:558:49597:20:0:72:540:76:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:one county-year is less than 20, this is a sizeable effect.  The coefficient on Republican vote share
19:559:49700:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is roughly half this size, which is still fairly substantial.  Figure (2) plots the predicted number of
19:560:49803:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:applications against gubernatorial vote share to both third party and Republican candidates, along
19:561:49901:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with the density of these vote shares in our sample.  These figures allow for a more flexible relation-
19:562:50004:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ship between applications and vote shares:  they include a quartic in vote shares instead of a linear
19:563:50105:21:20:72:539:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:or quadratic function.20These pictures suggest that the relationship between vote share to third
19:564:50201:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:party and Republican candidates is non-monotonic,  increasing at low levels and then decreasing
19:565:50296:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:when it exceeds a majority.  However, applications generally increase monotonically in vote share
19:566:50393:21:20:72:483:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to both parties over the range of vote shares that appear most commonly in our data.
19:567:50477:20:20:88:539:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In table (4), we explore this finding in more depth by estimating equation (3) under different
19:568:50571:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:specifications, focusing on linear effects of voting shares, using only the most recent election.  Col-
19:569:50674:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:umn  (1)  of  panel  A  repeats  our  baseline  estimate,  and  columns  (2)-(4)  should  be  thought  of  as
19:570:50783:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:robustness checks.  Specifically, we estimate our regression using congressional election returns data
19:571:50885:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:instead of gubernatorial data; we estimate the effect using log applications instead of levels; and
19:572:50984:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:we  disaggregate  our  third  party  category  into  populist  parties,  named  non-populist  parties,  and
19:573:51091:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:unnamed parties.21In columns (4) and (5),  we disaggregate by time period,  looking before and
19:574:51185:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:after  1910.   By  1910,  all  southern  states  had  adopted  measures  disenfranchising  black  and  poor
19:575:51292:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:voters,  so  we  are  interested  in  seeing  whether  electoral  variables  matter  differently  in  these  two
19:576:51404:20:20:72:425:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:periods.  Finally, in panel B, we estimate equation (3) separately by state.
19:577:51480:20:21:88:539:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The  overall  impression  we  get  from  this  table  is  that  populist  candidates  have  a  larger  and
19:578:51586:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:more robust effect on application rates than Republican candidates.  The coefficient on Republican
19:579:51684:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:vote share is not robust to using log applications instead of levels (column 3).  And, the significant
19:580:51786:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:effect  of  third  party  candidates  is  entirely  driven  by  populist  parties  (column  4).   Interestingly,
19:581:51898:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Republican  vote  shares  only  matter  before  1910,  while  populist  vote  shares  matter  during  both
19:582:52004:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:period.  This makes a lot of sense.  As Republican voters were mostly black during this period, the
19:583:52103:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:relationship between Republican vote shares and application rates is likely driven by the following:
19:584:52203:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a spike in Republican vote share likely indicates an increase in turnout among black voters, and
19:585:52299:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Democrats wanted to encourage whites to vote in response.  By 1910, these states had effectively
19:586:52395:20:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:disenfranchised  black  voters,  so  this  would  have  been  less  of  a  concern  for  southern  Democrats.
19:587:52504:21:20:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:However,  populist  third  party  candidates  likely  appealed  to  poor  Confederate  veterans  directly,
19:588:52610:20:16:72:540:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:which means that pensions may have been used explicitly to buy the veteran vote away from these
19:589:52705:16:15:80:539:103:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:20P-values  from  a  test  of  joint  significance  of  these  quartics  are  included  in  these  figures.   Predicted  values  are
19:590:52837:15:7:72:373:88:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:calculated at the mean for all other variables included in these regressions.
19:591:52914:7:0:80:404:81:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:A:21See appendix table 3 for a list of parties that fall into each of these categories.
20:592:53001:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:candidates.  As Confederate veterans were typically exempt from poll taxes, this would have been
20:593:53097:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:an important consideration for Democrats during our entire sample period.  Panel B shows that the
20:594:53194:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:effect of voting patterns on application rates is not uniform across states.  Third party candidates
20:595:53294:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:matter significantly (or almost significantly) in Alabama, Georgia, and Texas, but not in Virginia,
20:596:53393:21:20:72:523:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Arkansas, or Florida.  Republican candidates matter significantly in Virginia but nowhere else.
20:597:53488:20:20:88:539:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In tables (5) and (6), we try to rule out shocks to county economic conditions as an omitted
20:598:53580:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:variable driving the relationship between voting patterns and pension application rates.  The chal-
20:599:53679:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:lenge is that we do not have rich, time-varying data on county-level economic indicators; we only
20:600:53776:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:have such data available from decadal censuses.  In table (5), we characterize the effect of county-
20:601:53876:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:level  economic  indicators  on  the  number  of  applications  filed  per  decade,  controlling  for  county
20:602:53985:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:population.  Specifically, we regress the number of applications filed from countycbetween years
20:603:54081:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:B:tandt+ 10 on countyc’s characteristics in the census of yeart.  We always include state-decade
20:604:54175:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:fixed effects, so we continue to focus on the distribution of applications within states.  In columns
20:605:54276:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(1)-(7), we do not include county fixed effects, but we cluster standard errors at the county level;
20:606:54376:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in columns (8)-(14), we do include county fixed effects.  So, in the first 7 columns we are simply
20:607:54474:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:characterizing the types of counties that receive the most applications (conditional on population),
20:608:54574:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:while in the last 7 columns we are examining whether shocks to a county’s economic conditions
20:609:54667:20:20:72:348:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:generate changes in the county’s pension application rate.
20:610:54725:20:21:88:539:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We  find  that  county  characteristics  matter  greatly  for  pension  applications.   The  economic
20:611:54826:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:indicators we use are:  percent in agriculture, farm ownership rate, farm output per acre, and a gini
20:612:54927:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:coefficient for farm land inequality (Nunn 2008).  We also look at percent black and percent urban,
20:613:55026:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:although we consider the mechanism through which these variables should affect application rates
20:614:55122:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to be entirely consistent with our patronage story, since black and urban populations were a likely
20:615:55221:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:political threat to southern Democrats.  Consistent with this, we find that counties with large black
20:616:55322:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and  urban  minorities  generated  the  most  pension  applications,  whether  we  include  county  fixed
20:617:55427:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:effects or not.  We find that application rates are maximized in predominantly agricultural counties,
20:618:55528:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:although application rates do not respond significantly to changes in agriculture concentration – this
20:619:55630:20:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:variable does not enter significantly when county fixed effects are included.  However, the remaining
20:620:55731:21:20:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:economic  indicators  matter  significantly  under  both  specifications.   Applications  increase  when
20:621:55835:20:20:72:540:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:agricultural output per acre falls, and they are maximized when counties approach an intermediate
20:622:55932:20:20:72:338:99:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:farm ownership rate and degree of farm land inequality.
20:623:55987:20:0:88:539:79:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In table (6), we combine this county-level data with our electoral data, taking a series of snap-
21:624:56086:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:shots of county electoral and pension outcomes in 1880, 1890, 1900, 1910, and 1920.  Specifically,
21:625:56184:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:we regress number of applications between yearstandt+ 2 on vote shares in yeartand economic
21:626:56275:20:20:72:539:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:indicators from yeart.  One thing to notice is that, when we re-estimate equation (3) using this
21:627:56371:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:limited sample, the effect of vote shares on application rates becomes much less precisely estimated.
21:628:56472:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:This is not surprising, as our sample size has fallen by 80% relative to table (3):  we now have an
21:629:56571:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:average of 2.5 observations per county, compared with 12 observations per county in our baseline
21:630:56667:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:specification.  Here,  what we are interested in is whether or not controlling for county economic
21:631:56765:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:indicators significantly alters the estimated effect of vote shares on application rates.  If so,  this
21:632:56868:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:suggests that the correlation between vote shares and application rates is driven by a joint corre-
21:633:56967:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:lation between these two variables and local economic conditions.  If not, this would support our
21:634:57064:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:claim that political patronage is driving this correlation.  It clear from table (6) that controlling for
21:635:57169:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:county-level economic indicators – which do have an important effect on pension application rates
21:636:57266:20:37:72:410:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:– does not meaningfully alter the estimated coefficients on vote shares.
21:637:57338:37:27:72:251:428:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:5.3    Pension outcomes:  Texas
21:638:57369:27:20:72:540:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Table 7 contains estimates of equation (4), where we examine the effects of electoral variables on
21:639:57467:20:21:72:540:381:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the probability of a pension claim being rejected in Texas.  In panel A, we include all years of Texas
21:640:57569:21:20:72:540:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:data, including 1899, which is the year in which the pension program was first introduced.  In panel
21:641:57669:20:20:72:540:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:B, we exclude applications filed in 1899.  The idea is that there may be a learning curve associated
21:642:57769:20:21:72:540:320:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with using a pension system for political patronage, so any effect may not have been present at the
21:643:57868:21:20:72:540:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:beginning of the program’s life.  Given the large number of applications filed during the first year
21:644:57968:20:20:72:540:279:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the program was enacted, the outcome of these applications will have a large effect on our findings.
21:645:58068:20:20:72:540:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In panel A, we find that a county’s third party and Republican vote share typically have a negative
21:646:58167:20:21:72:540:239:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:effect on the probability of an application from that county begin rejected; however, this effect is
21:647:58267:21:20:72:540:218:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:not quite significant under most specifications.  In panel B, we omit applications from 1899, which
21:648:58366:20:20:72:540:198:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:causes the estimated effect of third party vote share to double in size and to become significant.
21:649:58464:20:21:72:540:178:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Specifically, based on column (1) from panel B, a 10% increase in third party vote share reduces the
21:650:58564:21:20:72:540:157:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:probability of having a claim rejected by 0.7 percentage points.  Because the rejection probability
21:651:58663:20:20:72:540:137:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:was only 10%, this translates into a 7% reduction in the probability of rejection.  This is a large
21:652:58762:20:21:72:100:117:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:effect.
21:653:58769:21:20:88:539:96:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In figure (3), we plot the overall rejection probability in Texas against vote share to the Republi-
21:654:58869:20:0:72:540:76:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:can or third party candidate.  While this is much more pronounced for third party candidates, these
22:655:58970:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:lines seem to inversely track one another.  Especially notable is the large dip in rejection probability
22:656:59074:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in 1912 that coincides with a large spike in third party vote share.  There is also a smaller dip in
22:657:59174:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rejection  probability  during  the  mid  1920s  that  coincides  with  a  large  spike  in  Republican  vote
22:658:59283:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:share.  It appears that Texas pension boards were more relaxed about awarding pensions in years
22:659:59378:21:43:72:438:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in which Democratic gubernatorial candidates were threatened in that state.
22:660:59453:43:31:72:173:584:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:6    Conclusion
22:661:59468:31:21:72:540:553:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:This  paper  offers  the  first  large,  multi-state  analysis  of  the  introduction  and  dissemination  of
22:662:59577:21:20:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Confederate  pensions  in  the  southern  United  States.   We  show  that  these  pensions  were  widely
22:663:59682:20:20:72:540:512:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:taken  up  and  funded  while  states  outside  the  region  were  passing  and  funding  other  types  of
22:664:59788:20:21:72:540:492:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:welfare legislation.  We show that the passage of Confederate pension legislation and the expansion
22:665:59887:21:20:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of funding for pensions are significantly related to increases in the popularity of third party and
22:666:59986:20:20:72:540:451:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Republican candidates. We also show that pensions were distributed to counties in which Democrats
22:667:60083:20:20:72:540:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:had  lost  ground  to  alternative  parties,  and  we  show  that  this  cannot  be  explained  by  changing
22:668:60191:20:21:72:540:411:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:underlying economic conditions.  We believe that these results indicate that southern Democrats
22:669:60286:21:20:72:402:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:used Confederate pensions to court the vote of Confederate veterans.
22:670:60354:20:20:88:539:370:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:These findings offer a new perspective on the welfare state in the American South.  The current
22:671:60449:20:21:72:540:350:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:literature on this subject posits that rural elites stopped southern legislatures from adopting welfare
22:672:60552:21:20:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:programs during the early 20th century,  and that they were able to get away with this because
22:673:60646:20:20:72:540:309:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:electoral competition had been effectively stifled.  Our results suggest a more qualified version of
22:674:60746:20:21:72:540:289:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:this story,  in which southern states did deploy income redistribution to curry favor with voters,
22:675:60844:21:20:72:540:268:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:albeit a very narrowly defined subset of all potential voters.  We believe this study offers new insight
22:676:60948:20:43:72:449:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:into the way in which voters and elites interact in order to shape public policy.
