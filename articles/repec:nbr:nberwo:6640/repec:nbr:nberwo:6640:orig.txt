3:0:1:0:28:108:518:708:144:Times:144:Times:In the past two presidential election years, proposals for fundamental tax reform were
3:1:87:28:28:72:497:680:144:Times:144:Times:widely circulated and debated during the primaries.  Challengers have discovered a large
3:2:175:28:29:72:526:652:144:Times:144:Times:constituency for a switch from the present income-based tax regime to a system based more on
3:3:267:29:28:72:522:623:144:Times:144:Times:consumption taxes.  Even passing references to tax reform and tax simplification are met with
3:4:360:28:28:72:528:595:144:Times:144:Times:considerable interest from the financial community.  Much of the political attention is based on
3:5:456:28:29:72:516:567:144:Times:144:Times:the perception that a consumption tax would increase the fairness and reduce the compliance
3:6:547:29:28:72:183:538:144:Times:144:Times:costs of the tax system.
3:7:571:28:28:108:531:510:144:Times:144:Times:There is also a belief that fundamental tax reform would generate higher saving, thereby
3:8:659:28:29:72:523:482:144:Times:144:Times:increasing the capital stock, worker productivity, and living standards.  The proponents of this
3:9:755:29:28:72:531:453:144:Times:144:Times:belief sometimes cite as evidence the twin observations that pension contributions account for a
3:10:851:28:28:72:512:425:144:Times:144:Times:large share of private saving and that pensions enjoy several tax advantages relative to other
3:11:945:28:29:72:499:397:144:Times:144:Times:methods of saving.1  However, the empirical literature on whether pension funds actually
3:12:1033:29:28:72:522:368:144:Times:65:Times:represent “new” saving or net additions to the capital stock has failed to achieve a consensus.2
3:13:1129:28:28:72:527:340:144:Times:144:Times:More importantly, the fact that pensions have characteristics other than their tax advantage that
3:14:1226:28:29:72:539:312:144:Times:144:Times:distinguish them from other forms of private saving in the current tax regime makes it impossible
3:15:1323:29:28:72:508:283:144:Times:144:Times:to simply generalize that extending consumption tax treatment to a greater share of savings
3:16:1414:28:28:72:239:255:144:Times:144:Times:vehicles will lead to higher saving.
3:17:1450:28:29:108:524:227:144:Times:144:Times:In particular, pensions are an illiquid and, in some cases, involuntary method of saving
3:18:1538:29:28:72:530:198:144:Times:144:Times:over horizons that do not extend to retirement.  Once the underlying model of household saving
3:19:1632:28:37:72:492:170:144:Times:144:Times:is expanded from the standard Life Cycle model to allow for non-retirement reasons for
3:20:1718:37:8:72:217:133:99:Times:99:Times:                                                           
3:21:1777:8:11:72:492:125:42:Times:99:Times:1 See Sabelhaus (1997) for a decomposition of personal saving into pension and nonpension components.
3:22:1878:11:17:72:523:114:42:Times:99:Times:2 The literature is comprised of two sets of studies.  The first pertains to Social Security and defined benefit (DB)
3:23:1995:17:11:72:514:97:99:Times:99:Times:pension plans and is well summarized in Gale (1995).  The second set of studies analyzes individual retirement
3:24:2105:11:12:72:521:86:99:Times:99:Times:accounts (IRAs) and 401(k) plans, which have more of a role for individual contributions.  Hubbard and Skinner
3:25:2215:12:0:72:374:74:99:Times:99:Times:(1996) provide a partial reconciliation of the mixed results in this literature.
4:26:2296:0:28:72:532:708:144:Times:144:Times:households to save and for other capital market imperfections, these characteristics—not the tax
4:27:2392:28:28:72:530:680:144:Times:144:Times:advantage—may determine whether pension savings are simply offset by lower private savings.
4:28:2483:28:29:72:540:652:144:Times:144:Times:Chief among these alternative motivations is the desire to save as a precaution against uncertainty
4:29:2582:29:28:72:515:623:144:Times:144:Times:in future budget constraints or consumption needs.  The main contribution of this paper is to
4:30:2675:28:28:72:504:595:144:Times:144:Times:show that the “target” saving described by Carroll (1997a) that may result in such a model
4:31:2765:28:29:72:532:567:144:Times:144:Times:drastically changes the degree to which households will offset lower pension wealth with higher
4:32:2860:29:28:72:537:538:144:Times:144:Times:wealth in other forms.  Specifically, if pension coverage is not entirely voluntary and people with
4:33:2959:28:28:72:540:510:144:Times:144:Times:pensions are not saving primarily for retirement, then if employers dismantle their pensions in the
4:34:3058:28:29:72:525:482:144:Times:144:Times:wake of tax reform, private saving will not offset the lost pension saving and total savings will
4:35:3155:29:28:72:91:453:144:Times:144:Times:fall.
4:36:3160:28:28:108:539:425:144:Times:144:Times:The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.  The next section briefly describes the
4:37:3251:28:29:72:524:397:144:Times:144:Times:source of the relative tax advantages to pensions under the current income tax system and how
4:38:3344:29:28:72:514:368:144:Times:144:Times:those advantages would be extended to other forms of saving under fundamental tax reform.
4:39:3433:28:28:72:532:340:144:Times:144:Times:Self-reported data on households’ motivations for saving are then analyzed, and several motives
4:40:3528:28:29:72:493:312:144:Times:144:Times:for saving that result in target rather than retirement saving behavior are identified.  The
4:41:3620:29:28:72:497:283:144:Times:144:Times:theoretical framework from Samwick (1995) is then used to show that such target saving
4:42:3706:28:28:72:490:255:144:Times:144:Times:behavior is consistent with reasonable parameterizations of the Life Cycle model under
4:43:3792:28:29:72:528:227:144:Times:144:Times:uncertainty.  The implications of this model and the self-reported data are then used to describe
4:44:3889:29:28:72:528:198:144:Times:144:Times:the likely responses of both target and life cycle savers to a consumption tax reform that causes
4:45:3986:28:28:72:536:170:144:Times:144:Times:their pensions to be eliminated.  The last section discusses the implications of this finding for the
4:46:4087:28:0:72:389:142:144:Times:144:Times:effect of fundamental tax reform on saving and economic welfare.
5:47:4152:0:28:72:264:708:144:Times:144:Times:Preferential Tax Treatment of Saving
5:48:4188:28:28:108:511:680:144:Times:144:Times:The current tax regime is designed to tax resources when they are earned as income.
5:49:4271:28:29:72:517:652:144:Times:144:Times:However, there are many examples of income flows that receive preferential treatment in the
5:50:4362:29:28:72:521:623:144:Times:144:Times:form of a lower effective tax rate.  Such preferences are often referred to as “consumption tax
5:51:4457:28:28:72:510:595:144:Times:144:Times:treatment,” and fundamental tax reform that switched to a consumption-based tax would be
5:52:4545:28:29:72:538:567:144:Times:144:Times:analogous to extending this treatment to a broader array of savings accounts.  This section briefly
5:53:4644:29:28:72:522:538:144:Times:144:Times:illustrates the source of potential tax advantages in the context of employer provided pensions
5:54:4739:28:28:72:523:510:144:Times:144:Times:before and after a tax reform.  More detailed discussions can be found in Salisbury (1995) and
5:55:4833:28:29:72:204:482:144:Times:144:Times:Engen and Gale (1996a, b).
5:56:4859:29:28:108:538:453:144:Times:144:Times:Engen and Gale (1996b) use the following expression to denote the amount of wealth that
5:57:4946:28:33:72:504:425:144:Times:144:Times:a dollar of income could generate in T years if saved by an employee in a taxable account:

5:61:5064:32:29:72:104:361:144:Times:144:Times:where:
5:62:5070:29:14:108:358:332:144:Times:144:Times:t0 = the income tax rate when the income is received
5:63:5122:14:14:108:370:318:144:Times:144:Times:SEE = the share of the payroll tax paid by the employee
5:64:5177:14:14:108:492:304:144:Times:144:Times:r = the rate of return before individual (but after corporate) taxes have been paid
5:65:5260:14:43:108:473:290:144:Times:144:Times:t1 = the income tax rate on asset income between the current year and year T
5:66:5336:43:28:108:522:247:144:Times:144:Times:Note that income and payroll taxes are paid immediately on the full amount of income
5:67:5420:28:28:72:533:219:144:Times:144:Times:when it is received by the employee.  Income taxes are also due each year on the taxable interest
5:68:5517:28:29:72:520:191:144:Times:144:Times:or dividends generated by the asset over the next T years.  In contrast, if the employer were to
5:69:5613:29:28:72:530:162:144:Times:144:Times:contribute that dollar to a pension account instead, it would generate the following amount after
5:70:5710:28:31:72:110:134:144:Times:144:Times:T years:

6:74:5745:0:28:72:104:708:144:Times:144:Times:where:
6:75:5751:28:14:108:369:680:144:Times:144:Times:SER = the share of the payroll tax paid by the employer
6:76:5806:14:15:108:415:666:144:Times:144:Times:tT = the income tax rate in year T when the account is liquidated
6:77:5871:15:43:108:450:651:144:Symbol:144:Times:θT = the (possibly zero) tax penalty on liquidating the account in year T
6:78:5944:43:29:108:518:608:144:Times:144:Times:Under this strategy, the initial amount that can be contributed includes the employer’s
6:79:6031:29:28:72:537:579:144:Times:144:Times:share of the payroll tax because non-employee pension contributions are exempt from the payroll
6:80:6126:28:28:72:518:551:144:Times:144:Times:tax.  That amount grows at the pre-tax rate of return while in the fund.  Upon withdrawal, the
6:81:6220:28:29:72:524:523:144:Times:144:Times:funds are subject to the income tax rate in year T and, possibly, a penalty for early withdrawal.
6:82:6317:29:28:108:512:494:144:Times:144:Times:The tax advantage therefore has three components: 1) the employer’s contribution is
6:83:6400:28:28:72:524:466:144:Times:144:Times:exempt from the payroll tax (if the account is employer-sponsored), 2) the “inside buildup” on
6:84:6494:28:29:72:523:438:144:Times:144:Times:the contributions is not taxed, and 3) the income tax rate paid on the withdrawal may be lower
6:85:6588:29:28:72:519:409:144:Times:144:Times:than when the contribution was made, especially if the withdrawal is made during retirement.
6:86:6680:28:28:72:529:381:144:Times:144:Times:These advantages may be sufficient to outweigh any potential penalties that are applied to early
6:87:6776:28:29:72:501:353:144:Times:144:Times:withdrawals, such as the ten percent excise tax and the twenty percent withholding tax on
6:88:6865:29:28:72:518:324:144:Times:144:Times:distributions that are not rolled over into qualified accounts.  These penalties are the price for
6:89:6963:28:28:72:411:296:144:Times:144:Times:converting an illiquid retirement account into a liquid savings account.
6:90:7035:28:29:108:538:268:144:Times:144:Times:Under fundamental tax reform, some or all of these relative advantages will be eliminated
6:91:7124:29:28:72:508:239:144:Times:144:Times:from the perspective of a household that is actively saving for retirement.  In particular, the
6:92:7219:28:28:72:503:211:144:Times:144:Times:removal of the tax on interest (t1) will make saving outside of pension accounts much less
6:93:7309:28:28:72:530:183:144:Times:144:Times:disadvantaged relative to pension contributions.  This is the source of most of the tax advantage
6:94:7406:28:29:72:522:155:144:Times:144:Times:to pensions and is at the heart of all consumption tax proposals.  If, in addition, the tax reform
6:95:7504:29:28:72:499:126:144:Times:144:Times:eliminates some of the progressivity of the current tax system by imposing a “flat tax” on
6:96:7594:28:0:72:520:98:144:Times:144:Times:consumption, then the advantages associated with a lower marginal tax rate in retirement will
7:97:7688:0:28:72:519:708:144:Times:144:Times:vanish.  A reform that offered tax credits for payroll taxes would eliminate the advantage that
7:98:7783:28:28:72:531:680:144:Times:144:Times:pensions enjoy through payroll tax deductibility.  As discussed below, if the tax advantage were
7:99:7879:28:29:72:486:652:144:Times:144:Times:made more widely available, then the employer costs of administering the pension and
7:100:7963:29:28:72:330:623:144:Times:144:Times:complying with regulations would also be eliminated.
7:101:8015:28:28:72:227:595:144:Times:144:Times:Household Motives for Saving
7:102:8043:28:29:108:526:567:144:Times:144:Times:The importance of heterogeneity in household saving behavior has recently become the
7:103:8127:29:28:72:536:538:144:Times:144:Times:topic of research on saving and wealth holding.3  Economic intuition suggests that the magnitude
7:104:8223:28:28:72:484:510:144:Times:144:Times:of the behavioral response to any price change depends critically on the amount of the
7:105:8309:28:29:72:526:482:144:Times:144:Times:household’s budget that was used to purchase the item whose price changed.  In the case of tax
7:106:8403:29:28:72:493:453:144:Times:144:Times:reform, it is the after-tax rate of return on saving that changes, and the item that is being
7:107:8496:28:28:72:524:425:144:Times:144:Times:purchased is, for example, retirement consumption.  It is therefore essential to understand how
7:108:8591:28:29:72:281:397:144:Times:144:Times:important a motive retirement is for saving.
7:109:8635:29:28:108:540:368:144:Times:144:Times:This section uses the household responses to questions about financial decision-making in
7:110:8724:28:28:72:527:340:144:Times:144:Times:the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) 1992 to demonstrate that a majority of the households
7:111:8815:28:29:72:521:312:144:Times:144:Times:are not in fact focusing on their retirement needs when making their consumption plans.  This
7:112:8908:29:28:72:527:283:144:Times:144:Times:result is quite general and is robust to controlling for expected differences in pension coverage,
7:113:9006:28:28:72:529:255:144:Times:144:Times:expected retirement income adequacy, and the horizon for financial decision-making.  The next
7:114:9099:28:29:72:501:227:144:Times:144:Times:section reconciles the empirical results on saving motives with a “Buffer Stock” model of
7:115:9188:29:28:72:224:198:144:Times:144:Times:consumption under uncertainty.
7:116:9218:28:28:108:519:170:144:Times:144:Times:The SCF 1992 was the fourth in a series of triennial surveys conducted by the Federal
7:117:9303:28:33:72:538:142:144:Times:144:Times:Reserve Board to obtain detailed information on wealth and other household characteristics.  The
7:118:9399:33:7:72:217:109:99:Times:99:Times:                                                           
7:119:9458:7:16:72:503:102:42:Times:99:Times:3 Dynan, Skinner, and Zeldes (1997) and Carroll (1997b) have addressed the issues of whether and why rich
7:120:9563:16:12:72:521:86:99:Times:99:Times:households save more than other households do.  Samwick (1997) examines the extent to which heterogeneity in
7:121:9671:12:0:72:451:74:99:Times:99:Times:tastes, parameterized by the discount rate, is a viable explanation for the distribution of wealth.
8:122:9771:0:28:72:481:708:144:Times:144:Times:sample size in the SCF 1992 is 3906, comprised of an area-probability sample and an
8:123:9854:28:28:72:509:680:144:Times:144:Times:oversampling of high income taxpayers.  Using the sample weights, the SCF is a nationally
8:124:9943:28:29:72:521:652:144:Times:144:Times:representative sample of the entire U.S. population of households.4  The SCF contains several
8:125:10036:29:28:72:535:623:144:Times:144:Times:questions on household expectations and attitudes, including a question that solicits up to five of
8:126:10135:28:28:72:526:595:144:Times:144:Times:the household’s most important reasons for savings (though only one third gave more than one
8:127:10227:28:29:72:286:567:144:Times:144:Times:and less than one tenth gave more than two).
8:128:10271:29:28:108:504:538:144:Times:144:Times:Table 1 tabulates the responses to these questions for all households in the sample,
8:129:10355:28:28:72:535:510:144:Times:144:Times:stratified by the age of the head of household.  The head of household for a married couple is the
8:130:10453:28:29:72:525:482:144:Times:144:Times:spouse with the higher labor income.  If the spouses have the same income (usually zero), then
8:131:10547:29:28:72:533:453:144:Times:144:Times:the older spouse is selected as the head.  The first row reports the percentages of households that
8:132:10646:28:28:72:536:425:144:Times:144:Times:gave “retirement or old age” as their most important reason for saving.  The values grow steadily
8:133:10743:28:29:72:511:397:144:Times:144:Times:with age before age 65, from a low of 3.62 percent for households under age 25 to a high of
8:134:10834:29:28:72:527:368:144:Times:144:Times:37.56 percent for households between 55 and 64.  The column marked “All” shows that for the
8:135:10925:28:28:72:538:340:144:Times:144:Times:whole sample, 18.25 percent listed retirement as their most important reason.  The last column in
8:136:11022:28:29:72:517:312:144:Times:144:Times:the table (“Any Mention”) reports the percentage of households who listed retirement among

8:138:11197:28:28:72:496:255:144:Times:144:Times:Approximately one fourth of the sample listed retirement as an important reason to save.
8:139:11285:28:29:108:539:227:144:Times:144:Times:By itself, the finding that only one fourth of the households list retirement as an important
8:140:11378:29:28:72:524:198:144:Times:144:Times:reason to save should cast suspicion on the most basic version of the Life-Cycle Hypothesis in
8:141:11472:28:28:72:524:170:144:Times:144:Times:which retirement is the primary reason that households save, regardless of their age.  The next
8:142:11567:28:29:72:509:142:144:Times:144:Times:row presents the analogous percentages of households reporting “uncertainty” as their most
8:143:11657:29:27:72:516:113:144:Times:144:Times:important reason for saving.  The percentages average 34.02 percent and show no systematic

8:145:11806:8:0:72:526:78:42:Times:99:Times:4 See Kennickell (1996) for documentation of the SCF 1992.  The SCFs from 1989 and 1995 yield similar results.
9:146:11917:0:28:72:537:708:144:Times:144:Times:trend with age, although the risks confronting households surely change over the life-cycle.5  The
9:147:12015:28:28:72:536:680:144:Times:144:Times:last column shows that 43.73 percent of the households list uncertainty as an important reason to
9:148:12112:28:29:72:511:652:144:Times:144:Times:save.  Uncertainty is the most important reason for saving for more households of every age
9:149:12203:29:28:72:470:623:144:Times:144:Times:except 55 - 64, when most households begin to make the transition into retirement.
9:150:12285:28:28:108:511:595:144:Times:144:Times:The remaining rows of the table present the analogous percentages for other savings
9:151:12368:28:29:72:494:567:144:Times:144:Times:motivations.  The third row pertains to saving done to purchase the household’s primary
9:152:12455:29:28:72:533:538:144:Times:144:Times:residence. The percentage starts at about nine percent for households under 35 and then declines
9:153:12551:28:28:72:500:510:144:Times:144:Times:with age.6  The fourth row reflects other saving done to acquire more valuable real estate,
9:154:12642:28:29:72:511:482:144:Times:144:Times:including second homes, home improvements, and durable goods (many of which are home
9:155:12726:29:28:72:522:453:144:Times:144:Times:furnishings).  Roughly three percent of households across all age categories save primarily for
9:156:12821:28:28:72:529:425:144:Times:144:Times:this reason.  The fifth row shows that the most important reason for the saving of ten percent of
9:157:12918:28:29:72:530:397:144:Times:144:Times:the households is to make transfers to other family members, largely through payments for their
9:158:13013:29:28:72:527:368:144:Times:144:Times:education.7  The sixth row reflects saving done for special purchases, including cars, vacations,
9:159:13110:28:28:72:516:340:144:Times:144:Times:own education, burial expenses, and charitable gifts.  The last two rows show that almost ten
9:160:13203:28:29:72:532:312:144:Times:144:Times:percent of the households save primarily because they believe that saving is simply a good thing
9:161:13299:29:28:72:523:283:144:Times:144:Times:to do, and a slightly larger number do not save, primarily because they don’t believe they have
9:162:13394:28:28:72:162:255:144:Times:65:Times:enough resources.8
9:163:13412:28:7:72:217:227:99:Times:99:Times:                                                           
9:164:13471:7:17:72:536:220:42:Times:99:Times:5 Households could give four different answers to be coded into this category: 1) Reserves in case of unemployment,
9:165:13586:17:12:72:486:203:99:Times:99:Times:2) In case of illness; medical/dental expense, 3) Emergencies; “rainy days”; other unexpected needs; for
9:166:13690:12:7:72:540:191:99:Times:99:Times:“security”/independence, and 4) Liquidity; to have cash available/on hand.  Of these, (3) is by far the most important.
9:167:13809:7:11:72:346:184:42:Times:99:Times:6 See Engelhardt (1996) for an analysis of saving for downpayments.
9:168:13876:11:17:72:529:173:42:Times:99:Times:7 The specific responses are: 1) Children’s or grandchildren’s education, and 2) “For the children/family”; “to help
9:169:13992:17:7:72:406:156:99:Times:99:Times:the kids out.”  See Feldstein (1995) for an analysis of saving for college educations.
9:170:14078:7:16:72:515:149:42:Times:99:Times:8 Samwick (1998) shows that results are similar when the responses are weighted by the household’s amount of
9:171:14186:16:12:72:540:133:99:Times:99:Times:financial assets.  A dollar-weighted calculation is more appropriate when answering the question of how much wealth
9:172:14301:12:12:72:502:121:99:Times:99:Times:will be offset, rather than what fraction of households will be affected.  The overall dollar-weighted fraction
9:173:14412:12:12:72:538:109:99:Times:99:Times:reporting retirement is equal to that reporting uncertainty, with retirement prevailing by a substantial margin between
9:174:14531:12:11:72:533:97:99:Times:99:Times:ages 45 and 64.  Since pension wealth is far less concentrated than financial assets, the most appropriate tabulations
9:175:14649:11:12:72:528:86:99:Times:99:Times:lie intermediate between those in Table 1 and the dollar-weighted calculations.   Even so, these differences are not
9:176:14765:12:0:72:499:74:99:Times:99:Times:large enough to be inconsistent with the application of the buffer stock model discussed in the next section.
10:177:14875:0:28:108:527:708:144:Times:144:Times:One reason why Table 1 might give a misleading account of saving motives is if survey
10:178:14960:28:28:72:533:680:144:Times:144:Times:respondents interpreted the “saving” to exclude the saving that is implicitly done for them in the
10:179:15058:28:29:72:522:652:144:Times:144:Times:form of pensions and Social Security.  In order to address this possibility, Table 2 presents the
10:180:15155:29:28:72:510:623:144:Times:144:Times:percentages of the working population reporting “retirement” and “uncertainty” as the most
10:181:15245:28:28:72:510:595:144:Times:144:Times:important reason, controlling for expected retirement adequacy.  The five categories are the
10:182:15337:28:29:72:537:567:144:Times:144:Times:households’ answers to the question, “How would you rate the retirement income you (expect to)
10:183:15431:29:28:72:523:538:144:Times:144:Times:receive from Social Security and job pensions?”  The three sets of numbers in the table are for
10:184:15526:28:28:72:517:510:144:Times:144:Times:the full sample of households in which the head is working, households in which at least one
10:185:15618:28:29:72:537:482:144:Times:144:Times:member is covered by a pension (55.14 percent), and households in which no one is covered by a
10:186:15712:29:28:72:188:453:144:Times:144:Times:pension (44.86 percent).
10:187:15736:28:28:108:522:425:144:Times:144:Times:These tabulations confirm that retirement is not the primary reason for saving.  For the
10:188:15824:28:29:72:526:397:144:Times:144:Times:full sample, the percentage reporting retirement as the most important reason is lower than that
10:189:15920:29:28:72:535:368:144:Times:144:Times:for uncertainty for each of the categories.  For the results by pension coverage, this result obtains
10:190:16021:28:28:72:521:340:144:Times:144:Times:in 9 out of 10 comparisons. The percentage citing uncertainty fluctuates primarily between 30
10:191:16114:28:29:72:523:312:144:Times:144:Times:and 40 percent across retirement income categories and is not particularly sensitive to pension
10:192:16209:29:28:72:523:283:144:Times:144:Times:coverage.  The increasing percentages citing retirement for higher expected retirement income
10:193:16302:28:28:72:527:255:144:Times:144:Times:are also not consistent with the objection, since households that expect low returns from Social
10:194:16398:28:29:72:533:227:144:Times:144:Times:Security and pensions do not appear to make up for it by placing more of an emphasis on saving
10:195:16492:29:28:72:141:198:144:Times:144:Times:for retirement.
10:196:16507:28:28:108:536:170:144:Times:144:Times:Table 3 provides some evidence for why retirement is not more prominently featured as a
10:197:16594:28:29:72:539:142:144:Times:144:Times:reason to save.  The columns in the table are the households’ response to a question asking which
10:198:16691:29:28:72:496:113:144:Times:144:Times:time period is most important to the household in planning its saving and spending.  The
10:199:16779:28:0:72:537:85:144:Times:144:Times:responses to that question are consistent with the households’ most important reasons for saving:
11:200:16877:0:28:72:495:708:144:Times:144:Times:there is a strong positive relationship between the length of the planning horizon and the
11:201:16967:28:28:72:495:680:144:Times:144:Times:probability that retirement is the most important reason for saving, regardless of pension
11:202:17057:28:29:72:513:652:144:Times:144:Times:coverage.  However, only 35 percent of those without pensions and 45 percent of those with
11:203:17147:29:28:72:526:623:144:Times:144:Times:pensions have a financial planning horizon of five years or greater.  It is interesting to note that
11:204:17247:28:28:72:523:595:144:Times:144:Times:retirement would be just as important a reason for saving as uncertainty if the population were
11:205:17342:28:29:72:282:567:144:Times:144:Times:entirely like the “Over 10 Year” subsample.
11:206:17385:29:28:72:309:538:144:Times:144:Times:Precautionary Saving in a Buffer Stock Model
11:207:17429:28:28:108:536:510:144:Times:144:Times:The results in Table 1 suggest three different types of saving motives.  The first is the life
11:208:17523:28:29:72:521:482:144:Times:144:Times:cycle motive, which is reflected by the households that cite retirement as their most important
11:209:17618:29:28:72:530:453:144:Times:144:Times:reason for saving.  The saving of these households should be well described by the standard life
11:210:17714:28:28:72:517:425:144:Times:144:Times:cycle model.  The second is the somewhat smaller percentage of households that cite explicit
11:211:17806:28:29:72:506:397:144:Times:144:Times:targets such as home purchases and family transfers.  Their decision to save in one form or
11:212:17897:29:28:72:521:368:144:Times:144:Times:another should be motivated by how well the saving vehicle enables the target to be achieved.
11:213:17990:28:28:72:529:340:144:Times:144:Times:The third is the sizable proportion of the population that cites uncertainty as the most important
11:214:18088:28:29:72:508:312:144:Times:144:Times:reason for saving.  Recent advances in the theory of precautionary saving by Carroll (1992,
11:215:18179:29:28:72:520:283:144:Times:144:Times:1997a) can be used to show that, under a broad range of circumstances, these households will
11:216:18271:28:28:72:515:255:144:Times:144:Times:behave in a manner similar to target savers.  The model of consumption under uncertainty in
11:217:18362:28:29:72:511:227:144:Times:144:Times:Samwick (1995) will be used below to illustrate this point.  The model is general enough to
11:218:18453:29:28:72:497:198:144:Times:144:Times:encompass both precautionary and life cycle motives for saving (though for simplicity, it
11:219:18542:28:28:72:521:170:144:Times:144:Times:abstracts from other explicit targets for saving).  Different parameterizations of the model can
11:220:18638:28:29:72:533:142:144:Times:144:Times:lead to profiles of wealth accumulation over the life cycle that reflect varying degrees of the two
11:221:18737:29:28:72:113:113:144:Times:144:Times:motives.
11:222:18745:28:0:108:509:85:144:Times:144:Times:The essential result from this model can be summarized by the following condition,
12:223:18829:0:36:72:292:708:144:Times:144:Times:which is based on the work of Deaton (1991):

12:233:18991:31:31:72:536:601:144:Times:144:Times:of time preference, ση2 is the variance of shocks to permanent income, and g is the rate of growth
12:234:19089:31:28:72:176:570:144:Times:144:Times:of household income.
12:235:19109:28:28:108:514:542:144:Times:144:Times:Carroll (1997a) shows that if this inequality is satisfied, then households will save in
12:236:19197:28:29:72:521:514:144:Times:144:Times:order to maintain a target wealth-to-income ratio.  He denotes this behavior as “Buffer Stock”
12:237:19291:29:28:72:516:485:144:Times:144:Times:saving.  The first term on the left-hand side is the expected growth rate of consumption in an
12:238:19385:28:28:72:535:457:144:Times:144:Times:infinite-horizon model with no uncertainty.  Consumption will grow more slowly if interest rates
12:239:19481:28:29:72:528:429:144:Times:144:Times:are low, risk aversion is high,9 or rates of time preference are high.  Carroll (1997a) denotes the
12:240:19580:29:31:72:474:400:144:Times:144:Times:situation in which the inequality holds in the absence of uncertainty (i.e., ση2 = 0) as
12:241:19668:31:28:72:524:369:144:Times:144:Times:“impatience.”  The second term on the left-hand side is the effect of income uncertainty on the
12:242:19763:28:29:72:498:341:144:Times:144:Times:growth rate of consumption.  Kimball (1990) denoted the precautionary saving motive as
12:243:19849:29:31:72:507:312:144:Times:144:Times:“prudence.”  In this model, ρ reflects the household’s prudence as well as its degree of risk
12:244:19942:31:28:72:512:281:144:Times:144:Times:aversion.  The more prudent the household or the greater the uncertainty faced, the higher is
12:245:20035:28:28:72:524:253:144:Times:144:Times:expected consumption growth.  In other words, the effect of precautionary saving is to depress
12:246:20129:28:29:72:496:225:144:Times:144:Times:current consumption and thereby raise the expected growth rate of consumption.  It is by
12:247:20217:29:28:72:523:196:144:Times:144:Times:consuming less today that the household can provide some insurance against the possibility of
12:248:20310:28:28:72:220:168:144:Times:144:Times:low consumption in the future.
12:249:20340:28:27:108:533:140:144:Times:144:Times:Thus, buffer-stock behavior emerges whenever the expected growth rate of consumption
12:250:20424:27:7:72:217:113:99:Times:99:Times:                                                           
12:251:20483:7:16:72:524:106:42:Times:99:Times:9 When Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) utility is assumed, then the inverse of the coefficient of relative
12:252:20596:16:12:72:538:90:99:Times:99:Times:risk aversion is the intertemporal elasticity of substitution.  A high degree of risk aversion is therefore analogous to a
12:253:20718:12:0:72:534:78:99:Times:99:Times:low willingness to substitute consumption from the current period to future periods.  This parameter restriction does
13:254:20837:0:28:72:496:708:144:Times:144:Times:is lower than the expected growth rate of income, with the magnitude of the buffer stock
13:255:20925:28:28:72:511:680:144:Times:144:Times:determined by the relative strength of impatience and prudence.  Carroll (1997a) shows that
13:256:21016:28:29:72:505:652:144:Times:144:Times:buffer-stock behavior is more likely to obtain during the early years of the life cycle, when
13:257:21109:29:28:72:512:623:144:Times:144:Times:income growth is relatively high, and shows that the buffer-stock model is consistent with a
13:258:21201:28:28:72:505:595:144:Times:144:Times:variety of empirical regularities in the distribution of wealth.  Carroll and Samwick (1997)
13:259:21293:28:29:72:536:567:144:Times:144:Times:present evidence that the buffer-stock model is an appropriate characterization of the behavior of
13:260:21391:29:28:72:528:538:144:Times:144:Times:most households over most of their working lives.  The buffer-stock model is further supported
13:261:21485:28:28:72:532:510:144:Times:144:Times:by the results for consumption profiles in Gourinchas and Parker (1995).  Using the buffer stock
13:262:21581:28:29:72:533:482:144:Times:144:Times:model to derive an empirical specification, Carroll and Samwick (1998) find that approximately
13:263:21675:29:28:72:420:453:144:Times:144:Times:one third of aggregate wealth can be attributed to precautionary motives.
13:264:21748:28:28:108:531:425:144:Times:144:Times:A primary contribution of Samwick (1995) is to show through simulations of this model
13:265:21833:28:29:72:531:397:144:Times:144:Times:that even a buffer-stock consumer will eventually behave as if retirement is an important reason
13:266:21929:29:28:72:530:368:144:Times:144:Times:to save as the date of retirement approaches.  The key point is that in a finite horizon model, the
13:267:22028:28:28:72:536:340:144:Times:144:Times:appropriate value of ‘g’ on the right-hand side of the inequality is similar to a present value of all
13:268:22130:28:29:72:517:312:144:Times:144:Times:future income growth rates.  Since retirement is represented in this model by a large negative
13:269:22224:29:28:72:538:283:144:Times:144:Times:value for income growth in the year of retirement, the inequality will inevitably fail to hold as the
13:270:22325:28:28:72:217:255:144:Times:144:Times:date of retirement approaches.
13:271:22355:28:29:108:528:227:144:Times:144:Times:This result is presented graphically in Figure 1.  The four different curves correspond to
13:272:22445:29:28:72:531:198:144:Times:144:Times:progressively higher retirement replacement rates of Social Security and pensions, ranging from
13:273:22540:28:28:72:513:170:144:Times:144:Times:25 to 100 percent of pre-retirement income.10  A striking feature of this graph is that all four
13:274:22636:28:27:72:532:142:144:Times:144:Times:households hold almost identical buffer stocks for the 20 years between ages 25 and 45.  During
13:275:22731:27:11:72:540:115:99:Times:99:Times:                                                                                                                                                                                                
13:276:22923:11:8:72:272:104:99:Times:99:Times:not affect the basic interpretation of the condition.
13:277:22976:8:16:72:523:96:42:Times:99:Times:10 This model assumes that all pensions are defined benefit and can be characterized by their promised retirement
13:278:23089:16:0:72:537:80:99:Times:99:Times:income flows.  See Engen (1994) for a model in which the household jointly chooses the level of saving and pension
14:279:23205:0:28:72:526:708:144:Times:144:Times:this time period, the anticipated drop at retirement is so far away that it has no effect on wealth
14:280:23304:28:29:72:537:680:144:Times:144:Times:holdings.  It is worth emphasizing that this lack of sensitivity to the replacement rate is not based
14:281:23405:29:31:72:539:651:144:Times:144:Symbol:on any irrationality.  Instead, it is due to the particular choice of parameters: ρ = 3, r = 0.02, and δ
14:282:23509:31:31:72:529:620:144:Times:144:Times:= 0.08 in all periods; g = 0.015 and ση = σε = 0.10 before retirement; and g = 0.00 and ση = σε =
14:283:23606:31:28:72:512:589:144:Times:144:Times:0.00 after retirement.  The condition guaranteeing buffer stock behavior is easily satisfied at
14:284:23701:28:28:72:136:561:144:Times:65:Times:young ages.11
14:285:23714:28:29:108:525:533:144:Times:144:Times:Each of the wealth profiles in which the replacement rate is less than one do eventually
14:286:23802:29:28:72:537:504:144:Times:144:Times:begin to accumulate more than just a buffer stock of wealth.  This occurs when the finite-horizon
14:287:23899:28:28:72:529:476:144:Times:144:Times:analog to the inequality fails to hold as date of retirement inevitably approaches.  The crossover
14:288:23997:28:29:72:539:448:144:Times:144:Times:point is earlier—and the subsequent accumulation of wealth is larger—for households with larger
14:289:24092:29:28:72:537:419:144:Times:144:Times:anticipated drops in income at retirement.  Note that this age-wealth profile is consistent with the
14:290:24192:28:28:72:536:391:144:Times:144:Times:results in Table 1 that showed that retirement becomes a more important reason for saving for an
14:291:24288:28:29:72:522:363:144:Times:144:Times:ever larger share of the households as they age.  If the inequality is not satisfied even at young
14:292:24386:29:28:72:511:334:144:Times:144:Times:ages, then the household never engages in a period of buffer stock saving and begins saving
14:293:24477:28:28:72:519:306:144:Times:144:Times:actively for retirement immediately.  Table 1 clearly shows the presence of young households
14:294:24569:28:29:72:403:278:144:Times:144:Times:that already cite retirement as their most important reason for saving.
14:295:24640:29:28:108:498:249:144:Times:144:Times:The salient feature of Figure 1 is that it shows that over much of the working life,
14:296:24724:28:28:72:514:221:144:Times:144:Times:households engaged in buffer stock saving will not alter their wealth holdings in response to
14:297:24817:28:29:72:520:193:144:Times:144:Times:fairly sizable changes in their retirement replacement rates.  In the context of fundamental tax
14:298:24913:29:31:72:536:164:144:Times:144:Times:reform, changing the replacement rate is akin to eliminating the retirement income in the form of
14:299:25010:31:12:72:540:133:99:Times:99:Times:                                                                                                                                                                                                
14:300:25202:12:7:72:127:121:99:Times:99:Times:contributions.
14:301:25216:7:17:72:527:114:42:Times:99:Times:11 The high value for the time preference rate is chosen to emphasize the point that even very impatient consumers
14:302:25330:17:11:72:530:97:99:Times:99:Times:will eventually save for retirement as long as income drops at retirement.  The same qualitative results hold (with a
14:303:25447:11:12:72:539:86:99:Times:99:Times:larger buffer stock) when a lower value is chosen as long as the inequality is still satisfied.  However, see Carroll and
14:304:25568:12:0:72:531:74:99:Times:99:Times:Samwick (1997), in addition to the results in Table 3, for a justification of a time preference rate of this magnitude.
15:305:25689:0:28:72:533:708:144:Times:144:Times:an employer provided pension.  If the condition for buffer-stock behavior is met, then the saving
15:306:25786:28:28:72:531:680:144:Times:144:Times:response of households who save primarily as a precaution against uncertainty will be similar to
15:307:25882:28:29:72:525:652:144:Times:144:Times:that of the households who were target savers for reasons such as a home purchase or transfers
15:308:25976:29:28:72:528:623:144:Times:144:Times:for education.  Households who save primarily to achieve preretirement targets will be unlikely
15:309:26071:28:29:72:511:595:144:Times:144:Times:to offset the reduction in expected retirement income with higher values of personal saving.
15:310:26163:29:28:72:245:566:144:Times:144:Times:Pension Saving After Tax Reform
15:311:26194:28:28:108:531:538:144:Times:144:Times:Under the present income tax regime, the tax advantages of pension plans are associated
15:312:26281:28:28:72:515:510:144:Times:144:Times:with two primary costs.  The first is the administrative cost to the employer of setting up and
15:313:26376:28:29:72:534:482:144:Times:144:Times:operating the plan.  If the tax advantages of pensions are made available to employees outside of
15:314:26473:29:28:72:510:453:144:Times:144:Times:the pension, then a pure efficiency gain results.  The resources that the employer previously
15:315:26566:28:28:72:516:425:144:Times:144:Times:devoted to administering the plan will be returned to the shareholders as higher profits or the
15:316:26661:28:29:72:506:397:144:Times:144:Times:employees as higher wages.  The amount of this gain that is saved will reflect the marginal
15:317:26752:29:28:72:282:368:144:Times:144:Times:propensities to save of those who receive it.
15:318:26797:28:28:108:504:340:144:Times:144:Times:The second is the cost associated with the uniformity of the pension plan across all
15:319:26881:28:29:72:523:312:144:Times:144:Times:workers at a given firm.  Table 3 clearly demonstrates that there is substantial heterogeneity in
15:320:26978:29:28:72:516:283:144:Times:144:Times:both the motives and horizons for saving among workers with pensions.  This heterogeneity,
15:321:27068:28:28:72:537:255:144:Times:144:Times:little of which can be ascertained systematically by the employer, means that it is not possible for
15:322:27168:28:29:72:489:227:144:Times:144:Times:the employer to design a pension plan that explicitly matches the desired amount of tax
15:323:27255:29:28:72:517:198:144:Times:144:Times:advantaged saving on a worker-by-worker basis.  At best, employers can establish a plan that
15:324:27347:28:28:72:534:170:144:Times:144:Times:provides the optimal benefits for a large subset of employees, perhaps those that the firm is most
15:325:27445:28:29:72:490:142:144:Times:144:Times:interested in retaining.  However, given the inability of the employer to ascertain which
15:326:27534:29:28:72:532:113:144:Times:144:Times:employers want the pension and which do not, the contributions can be funded only by reducing
15:327:27627:28:0:72:515:85:144:Times:144:Times:the wages of all workers covered by the plan. The imperfect match between workers’ saving
16:328:27718:0:28:72:526:708:144:Times:144:Times:preferences and the degree to which their pensions allow them access to tax advantaged saving
16:329:27811:28:28:72:503:680:144:Times:144:Times:imposes a welfare cost relative to a more straightforward consumption tax treatment of all
16:330:27901:28:29:72:114:652:144:Times:65:Times:saving.12
16:331:27910:29:28:108:518:623:144:Times:144:Times:Federal regulations on the distribution of pension contributions across employees at a
16:332:27996:28:28:72:504:595:144:Times:144:Times:given firm further prevent employees from obtaining their exactly preferred amount of tax
16:333:28085:28:29:72:521:567:144:Times:144:Times:advantaged saving under current pension plans.  A complicated set of nondiscrimination rules
16:334:28177:29:28:72:521:538:144:Times:144:Times:requires a rough parity of contributions made across different categories of employees (highly
16:335:28271:28:28:72:493:510:144:Times:65:Times:versus non-highly compensated workers) if the contributions are to be tax advantaged.13
16:336:28358:28:29:72:498:482:144:Times:144:Times:Regulations such as nondiscrimination rules are common when an exception (such as the
16:337:28443:29:28:72:522:453:144:Times:144:Times:consumption tax treatment of pension contributions) is made to the income tax code to ensure
16:338:28535:28:28:72:536:425:144:Times:144:Times:that the benefits of that exception are distributed in a way that is deemed to be equitable.  Garrett
16:339:28636:28:29:72:520:397:144:Times:144:Times:(1995) analyzes the extent to which the nondiscrimination rules are binding and demonstrates
16:340:28728:29:28:72:495:368:144:Times:144:Times:large effects of the rules on the relative contributions on behalf of highly and non-highly
16:341:28819:28:28:72:179:340:144:Times:144:Times:compensated workers.
16:342:28839:28:29:108:516:312:144:Times:144:Times:Given the presence of nondiscrimination rules, employees who wish to access the tax
16:343:28922:29:28:72:535:283:144:Times:144:Times:advantage of pensions must cross-subsidize the pension accounts of other employees who would
16:344:29014:28:28:72:538:255:144:Times:144:Times:prefer to receive their compensation in wages.  Enacting fundamental tax reform would allow the
16:345:29109:28:29:72:540:227:144:Times:144:Times:employees who wish to save at the pre-tax interest rate the opportunity to do so without having to
16:346:29207:29:28:72:514:198:144:Times:144:Times:comply with nondiscrimination rules.  Because pensions will no longer be as valuable to the
16:347:29298:28:26:72:523:170:144:Times:144:Times:workers who currently desire them most, it is reasonable to expect that a sizable percentage of
16:348:29393:26:7:72:217:144:99:Times:99:Times:                                                           
16:349:29452:7:17:72:536:137:42:Times:99:Times:12 There are circumstances under which this welfare cost can be at least partially recouped.  For example, if there are
16:350:29571:17:12:72:508:120:99:Times:99:Times:sufficiently many different combinations of wages and pension plans across employers, then workers can sort
16:351:29678:12:11:72:491:108:99:Times:99:Times:themselves according to their preferences for saving without compromising their productivity.  Given the
16:352:29782:11:12:72:540:97:99:Times:99:Times:heterogeneity in Table 3, this seems unlikely.  Another possibility is for the pension plan itself to accommodate many
16:353:29900:12:0:72:527:85:99:Times:99:Times:different tastes for saving.  Ippolito (1996) presents a model in which this is accomplished via the employer match
17:354:30017:0:28:72:408:708:144:Times:65:Times:firms that currently sponsor pensions will terminate them as a result.14
17:355:30089:28:28:108:498:680:144:Times:144:Times:To simplify the analysis only slightly, the saving response by different workers to
17:356:30172:28:29:72:540:652:144:Times:144:Times:fundamental tax reform can be viewed as the combination of two factors.  The first is whether the
17:357:30269:29:28:72:518:623:144:Times:144:Times:worker was saving primarily to support consumption during retirement as in the standard life
17:358:30361:28:28:72:536:595:144:Times:144:Times:cycle model or to achieve more specific, near-term targets like a buffer stock against uncertainty,
17:359:30460:28:29:72:525:567:144:Times:144:Times:a home purchase, or transfers to family members.  The second is whether the pension plan that
17:360:30553:29:28:72:533:538:144:Times:144:Times:covers the worker offers sufficient access to the tax advantage that it fully achieves the worker’s
17:361:30652:28:28:72:297:510:144:Times:65:Times:desire for saving, whether life cycle or target.15
17:362:30702:28:29:108:535:482:144:Times:144:Times:Consider first the workers who report “retirement” as their primary reason for saving and
17:363:30791:29:28:72:521:453:144:Times:144:Times:have pensions that allow them to achieve most of their retirement saving objectives.  If due to
17:364:30886:28:28:72:535:425:144:Times:144:Times:nondiscrimination rules they were cross-subsidizing the saving of other workers covered by their
17:365:30982:28:29:72:532:397:144:Times:144:Times:pension plans, then fundamental tax reform presents them with an increase in their after-tax rate
17:366:31079:29:28:72:525:368:144:Times:144:Times:of return on saving (equal to the size of the cross-subsidy).  This change in the return to saving
17:367:31177:28:28:72:538:340:144:Times:144:Times:will induce the familiar income and substitution effects.  Because retirement consumption is now
17:368:31273:28:29:72:530:312:144:Times:144:Times:cheaper, households will save more out of current income to purchase more in retirement, other
17:369:31367:29:28:72:523:283:144:Times:144:Times:things equal.  The income effect arises precisely because other things are not equal.  Lowering
17:370:31462:28:28:72:490:255:144:Times:144:Times:the price of retirement consumption means that the level of retirement consumption the
17:371:31548:28:36:72:511:227:144:Times:144:Times:household was previously expecting can be achieved by saving less today.  The substitution
17:372:31638:36:11:72:540:191:99:Times:99:Times:                                                                                                                                                                                                
17:373:31830:11:7:72:152:180:99:Times:99:Times:rate in 401(k) plans.
17:374:31851:7:12:72:451:173:42:Times:99:Times:13 See McGill, Brown, Haley, and Schieber (1996) for a description of nondiscrimination rules.
17:375:31945:12:17:72:533:161:42:Times:99:Times:14 Pensions will not disappear entirely because there are other reasons to set up pensions beyond the tax advantages.
17:376:32062:17:11:72:512:144:99:Times:99:Times:The most prominent reasons include the ability to purchase group annuities, to control turnover and retirement
17:377:32172:11:12:72:506:133:99:Times:99:Times:through deferred compensation (Gustman and Steinmeier (1995) and Kotlikoff and Wise (1987)), and to sort
17:378:32276:12:7:72:363:121:99:Times:99:Times:workers based on unobservable aspects of productivity (Ippolito (1996)).
17:379:32348:7:17:72:537:114:42:Times:99:Times:15 It is worth noting that the same factors are relevant for the more familiar debate of whether the amounts in pension
17:380:32467:17:11:72:530:97:99:Times:99:Times:funds represent “new” saving that would not have otherwise been done if pensions were not available.  That debate
17:381:32580:11:12:72:509:86:99:Times:99:Times:concerns proposals to extend the availability of tax advantaged saving through the current system, rather than
17:382:32690:12:0:72:201:74:99:Times:99:Times:through fundamental tax reform.
18:383:32723:0:28:72:498:708:144:Times:144:Times:effect leads to more saving, but the income effect leads to less.  Thus, even in the case of
18:384:32815:28:28:72:518:680:144:Times:144:Times:households that are actively saving for retirement, a change in the after-tax interest rate when
18:385:32911:28:29:72:530:652:144:Times:144:Times:consumption tax treatment is extended to another type of income will have an ambiguous effect
18:386:33004:29:28:72:129:623:144:Times:65:Times:on saving.16
18:387:33016:28:28:108:515:595:144:Times:144:Times:Next consider workers who report retirement as their reason for saving but who have
18:388:33099:28:29:72:512:567:144:Times:144:Times:pensions that do not offer enough of a tax advantage to fully achieve their retirement saving
18:389:33192:29:28:72:516:538:144:Times:144:Times:objectives.  These workers will be saving additionally outside of the pension to achieve their
18:390:33286:28:28:72:524:510:144:Times:144:Times:goals, possibly at the current after-tax rate of return.  Given the widespread result that workers
18:391:33384:28:29:72:525:482:144:Times:144:Times:covered by pensions have no less wealth outside of their pensions than do workers not covered
18:392:33477:29:28:72:532:453:144:Times:144:Times:by pensions, this scenario is probably the norm for pension covered workers.17   Maintaining the
18:393:33573:28:28:72:537:425:144:Times:144:Times:assumption that retirement savers experience an increase in the after-tax rate of return (due to the
18:394:33673:28:29:72:531:397:144:Times:144:Times:elimination of the cross-subsidy), the income effect will be comparatively large for them and on
18:395:33769:29:28:72:359:368:144:Times:144:Times:balance they can be expected to increase their consumption.
18:396:33828:28:28:108:520:340:144:Times:144:Times:The response of target savers will analogously depend on whether their pensions were
18:397:33912:28:29:72:532:312:144:Times:144:Times:previously a convenient means of achieving their target, despite their illiquidity.  Suppose that a
18:398:34011:29:28:72:509:283:144:Times:144:Times:worker was saving primarily for a downpayment on a home purchase or a child’s education
18:399:34098:28:28:72:523:255:144:Times:144:Times:through a 401(k) plan, intending to borrow against the plan or change jobs to receive the lump
18:400:34192:28:29:72:523:227:144:Times:144:Times:sum distribution (net of tax penalties) when the funds were needed.  Since the pension met the
18:401:34286:29:28:72:532:198:144:Times:144:Times:goal at the lowest possible cost, this worker would not have large balances outside of the 401(k)
18:402:34383:28:37:72:527:170:144:Times:144:Times:plan.  Fundamental tax reform would cause this saving to be done in a different tax advantaged
18:403:34477:37:8:72:217:133:99:Times:99:Times:                                                           
18:404:34536:8:16:72:513:125:42:Times:99:Times:16 Note that this set of effects is similar to that experienced by a worker saving for retirement who did not have
18:405:34650:16:12:72:520:109:99:Times:99:Times:access to a pension.  The latter worker would experience the effect for the entire change between the pre-tax and
18:406:34763:12:19:72:538:97:99:Times:99:Times:after-tax interest rates, however, rather than just the pre-tax return net of the cross-subsidy to the pre-tax return itself.
18:407:34888:19:0:72:491:78:42:Times:99:Times:17 See Gustman and Steinmeier (1998) for a recent example of such a study and a review of the literature.
19:408:34995:0:28:72:514:708:144:Times:144:Times:account, but the overall level of saving would remain about the same. Since these targets are
19:409:35088:28:28:72:522:680:144:Times:144:Times:fairly near-term, there would not be large substitution or income effects, even if these workers
19:410:35184:28:29:72:343:652:144:Times:144:Times:were also cross-subsidizing others covered by their plan.
19:411:35241:29:28:108:533:623:144:Times:144:Times:Suppose instead that a target saver found that it was not possible to use a pension plan to
19:412:35332:28:28:72:535:595:144:Times:144:Times:achieve the target.  This could happen if the pension had no loan provisions or if the target was a
19:413:35431:28:29:72:512:567:144:Times:144:Times:buffer stock and the prospect of changing jobs just to receive the balances was not a desired
19:414:35524:29:28:72:540:538:144:Times:144:Times:outcome.  Such a worker would be voluntarily contributing as little as possible to the pension and
19:415:35622:28:28:72:514:510:144:Times:144:Times:saving for the target outside of the plan.  In the wake of fundamental tax reform, this worker
19:416:35716:28:29:72:538:482:144:Times:144:Times:would consume any pension balances accumulated on his behalf.  Because this worker would not
19:417:35808:29:28:72:520:453:144:Times:144:Times:be cross-subsidizing any other worker through the plan, he would be in the same position as a
19:418:35901:28:28:72:518:425:144:Times:144:Times:worker not covered by a pension in other respects.  The shift to consumption tax treatment of
19:419:35994:28:29:72:511:397:144:Times:144:Times:saving in liquid accounts introduces substitution and income effects on the entire difference
19:420:36087:29:28:72:533:368:144:Times:144:Times:between the pre-tax and after-tax rates of return.  Since the buffer stock accumulated in Figure 1
19:421:36185:28:28:72:520:340:144:Times:144:Times:is very insensitive to the rate of return, the income effect is likely to dominate the substitution
19:422:36284:28:29:72:539:312:144:Times:144:Times:effect and the worker will consume more immediately and achieve his target with lower saving at
19:423:36379:29:28:72:190:283:144:Times:65:Times:the higher interest rate.18
19:424:36406:28:28:108:512:255:144:Times:144:Times:Some evidence on the issue of what would happen to pension account balances after
19:425:36487:28:29:72:509:227:144:Times:144:Times:fundamental tax reform can be inferred from Chang (1996).  She examines the effect of the
19:426:36576:29:28:72:527:198:144:Times:144:Times:introduction of the ten percent penalty on lump sum distributions under the Tax Reform Act of
19:427:36669:28:28:72:507:170:144:Times:144:Times:1986 on the probability that households who received distributions “rolled them over” into
19:428:36759:28:33:72:528:142:144:Times:144:Times:another retirement account.  She finds that rollover rates are fairly insensitive to the tax penalty
19:429:36859:33:7:72:217:109:99:Times:99:Times:                                                           
19:430:36918:7:16:72:535:102:42:Times:99:Times:18 It is also possible that the size of the non-precautionary targets expands (i.e., a bigger house or a better college) or
19:431:37041:16:12:72:534:86:99:Times:99:Times:that the higher interest rate increases consumption growth to the point where the worker no longer engages in buffer
19:432:37157:12:0:72:133:74:99:Times:99:Times:stock behavior.
20:433:37174:0:28:72:526:708:144:Times:144:Times:and attributes the result to the presence of liquidity constraints among low-income households.
20:434:37269:28:28:72:531:680:144:Times:144:Times:Although the receipt of a distribution is endogenous in that context,19 her results do suggest that
20:435:37368:28:29:72:487:652:144:Times:144:Times:if workers were given access to their pension funds in liquid form in the aftermath of a
20:436:37456:29:28:72:538:623:144:Times:144:Times:consumption tax reform, they would be inclined to spend them rather than continue to save them.
20:437:37551:28:28:72:220:595:144:Times:144:Times:Implications for Tax Reform
20:438:37578:28:29:108:503:567:144:Times:144:Times:An ongoing debate in the literature on saving is whether amounts in pension funds
20:439:37659:29:28:72:530:538:144:Times:144:Times:actually represent “new” saving.  The analysis in this paper shows that even if this claim is true,
20:440:37758:28:28:72:518:510:144:Times:144:Times:it provides an unreliable guide to the likely effects of fundamental tax reform on saving.  The
20:441:37853:28:29:72:527:482:144:Times:144:Times:critical factor is the heterogeneity in household motives for saving.  Some pension balances are
20:442:37949:29:28:72:501:453:144:Times:144:Times:clearly the result of extra saving to take advantage of the higher after-tax rate of return by
20:443:38043:28:28:72:516:425:144:Times:144:Times:households who cite retirement as their most important reason for saving.  But other pension
20:444:38135:28:29:72:511:397:144:Times:144:Times:balances are the result of households who don’t actively save for retirement being unable to
20:445:38227:29:28:72:538:368:144:Times:144:Times:dissave their retirement balances because what little wealth they do hold is earmarked for a down
20:446:38324:28:28:72:473:340:144:Times:144:Times:payment on a home, a child’s education, or a buffer stock against uncertain income.
20:447:38407:28:29:108:532:312:144:Times:144:Times:When tax reform extends the higher after-tax rate of return to forms of saving other than
20:448:38496:29:28:72:530:283:144:Times:144:Times:pensions, the workers at each firm who valued the opportunity to save for retirement at a higher
20:449:38592:28:28:72:512:255:144:Times:144:Times:interest rate will no longer need to rely on a pension plan to do it.  Because the pension plan
20:450:38687:28:29:72:536:227:144:Times:144:Times:imposes costs of both administration and regulation, there will a strong incentive for these savers
20:451:38786:29:28:72:502:198:144:Times:144:Times:to take their compensation in the form of higher wages and save the extra pay outside of a
20:452:38876:28:28:72:522:170:144:Times:144:Times:pension.  While their total saving may not change too much in either direction, the saving that
20:453:38971:28:29:72:525:142:144:Times:144:Times:was previously done on behalf of workers who were otherwise target savers will simply not be
20:454:39063:29:26:72:242:113:144:Times:144:Times:made up by higher personal saving.
20:455:39097:26:7:72:217:87:99:Times:99:Times:                                                           
20:456:39156:7:0:72:523:80:42:Times:99:Times:19 Lump sum distributions are typically received only when an employment relationship ends.  The set of workers
21:457:39269:0:28:108:532:708:144:Times:144:Times:This somewhat pessimistic conclusion demonstrates that there is a clear distinction to be
21:458:39358:28:28:72:533:680:144:Times:144:Times:made between policies that raise the level of saving and policies that raise the level of economic
21:459:39456:28:29:72:536:652:144:Times:144:Times:welfare.  While it is true that if the nation’s capital stock were increased exogenously or possibly
21:460:39556:29:28:72:530:623:144:Times:144:Times:due to lower taxation of capital income (with the revenue recouped in a more efficient manner),
21:461:39651:28:28:72:520:595:144:Times:144:Times:the extra capital could be put to use in production and raise the standard of living.  That is not
21:462:39749:28:29:72:503:567:144:Times:144:Times:exactly what happens when the government offers a tax advantage to pension saving in an
21:463:39836:29:28:72:518:538:144:Times:144:Times:income tax system and requires cross-subsidies to target savers.  The target savers have other
21:464:39930:28:28:72:527:510:144:Times:144:Times:economic goals in mind, and forcing retirement balances on them (possibly at the direct cost of
21:465:40025:28:29:72:529:482:144:Times:144:Times:lower wages) is not the way to make them better off.  This is especially true if they are liquidity
21:466:40124:29:28:72:280:453:144:Times:144:Times:constrained in their consumption decisions.
21:467:40167:28:28:108:526:425:144:Times:144:Times:This distinction does not mean that fundamental tax reform should not be pursued with
21:468:40252:28:29:72:536:397:144:Times:144:Times:the goal of raising the level of national saving.  It simply cautions that the distribution of pension
21:469:40354:29:28:72:512:368:144:Times:144:Times:saving across the population may currently be at odds with individual household objectives.
21:470:40445:28:28:72:530:340:144:Times:144:Times:Under the current tax system, both the tax advantage and the illiquidity are important aspects of
21:471:40542:28:29:72:516:312:144:Times:144:Times:how much wealth is held in the form of pensions.  Tax reform will open up opportunities for
21:472:40633:29:28:72:539:283:144:Times:144:Times:households to make themselves better off, possibly by changing their compensation from pension
21:473:40727:28:28:72:505:255:144:Times:144:Times:contributions to wages if pensions lose all of their relative tax advantages.  The theory and
21:474:40820:28:29:72:516:227:144:Times:144:Times:evidence presented in this paper strongly suggest that this will result in a reduction in private
21:475:40917:29:28:72:531:198:144:Times:144:Times:saving.  This possibility must be weighed against the more traditional predictions from standard
21:476:41013:28:28:72:521:170:144:Times:144:Times:life cycle models that suggest that a higher after-tax rate of return will raise saving in the long
21:477:41112:28:33:72:97:142:144:Times:144:Times:term.
