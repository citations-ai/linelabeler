2:28:1516:26:24:71:539:597:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Maternity leaves can affect mothers’ and infants’ welfare if they first affect the amount  of  time
2:29:1615:24:24:71:539:573:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:working women stay at home post birth. We provide new evidence of the labor supply effects of
2:30:1708:24:24:71:539:549:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:these leaves from an analysis of the introduction and expansion of job-protected maternity leave in
2:31:1807:24:24:71:539:525:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Canada. The substantial variation in leave entitlements across mothers by time and space is likely
2:32:1905:24:24:71:539:501:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:exogenous to their unobserved characteristics. This is important because unobserved heterogeneity
2:33:2002:24:24:71:539:477:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:correlated with leave entitlement potentially biases many previous studies of this topic. We find that
2:34:2104:24:24:71:539:453:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:modest mandates of 17-18 weeks do not increase the time mothers spend at home. The physical
2:35:2195:24:24:71:539:429:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:demands  of  birth  and  private  arrangements  appear  to  render  short  mandates  redundant.  These
2:36:2297:24:24:71:539:405:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:mandates do, however, decrease the proportion of women quitting their jobs, increase leave taking,
2:37:2395:24:24:71:539:381:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and  increase  the  proportion  returning  to  their  pre-birth  employers.  In  contrast,  we  find  that
2:38:2501:24:24:71:539:357:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:expansions of job-protected leaves to lengths up to 70 weeks do increase the time spent at home (as
2:39:2600:24:24:71:539:333:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:well as leave-taking and job continuity). We also examine whether this increase in time at home
2:40:2695:24:24:71:539:309:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:affects infant health, finding no evidence of an effect on the incidence of low birth weight or infant
2:41:2797:24:29:71:118:285:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:mortality.

3:57:3089:0:13:72:152:708:144:Times:144:Times:1. Introduction 
3:58:3105:13:14:72:75:695:144:Times:144:Times: 
3:59:3105:14:28:108:510:681:144:Times:144:Times:Job-protected maternity leave mandates are a common public policy directed to the 
3:60:3187:28:27:72:519:653:144:Times:144:Times:welfare of infants and mothers.  They vary considerably; universal, long and paid in Europe; 
3:61:3280:27:28:72:536:626:144:Times:144:Times:targeted, short and unpaid in the United States.  The recent trend in most jurisdictions is to more 
3:62:3380:28:28:72:529:598:144:Times:144:Times:generous entitlements.  The duration of leave has been lengthened in Europe and Canada.  Led 
3:63:3473:28:27:72:513:570:144:Times:144:Times:by California’s Family Leave Insurance Program of 2004, many U.S. states are considering 
3:64:3562:27:28:72:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:income replacement for the leaves provided under the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act.1  
3:65:3652:28:27:107:533:515:144:Times:144:Times:The benefits of the mandates for infants are thought to include better pre- and post-natal 
3:66:3743:27:28:71:537:488:144:Times:144:Times:care, a longer period of breastfeeding, more intense parental bonding and lower accident rates in 
3:67:3841:28:28:71:519:460:144:Times:144:Times:the first years.  The potential benefits for mothers are better post partum physical and mental 
3:68:3937:28:27:71:529:432:144:Times:144:Times:health, and improved long-run labor market outcomes due to increased employment continuity 
3:69:4028:27:28:71:531:405:144:Times:144:Times:over the birth event.  Waldfogel (1998b) argues that maternity leave is a key policy response to 
3:70:4125:28:27:71:519:377:144:Times:144:Times:the “family gap” in earnings between women with and without children.2 Based on available 
3:71:4215:27:28:71:533:350:144:Times:144:Times:evidence, the World Health Organization (2000) concludes that “women need at least 16 weeks 
3:72:4307:28:27:71:475:322:144:Times:144:Times:of absence from work after delivery” to protect the health of both mother and child. 
3:73:4392:27:28:107:525:295:144:Times:144:Times:These claims are based on research showing maternity leaves are positively associated 
3:74:4478:28:28:71:537:267:144:Times:144:Times:with post-birth wages (for example, Shapiro and Mott 1994, Waldfogel 1998a), the employment 
3:75:4570:28:27:71:504:239:144:Times:144:Times:of females in their childbearing years (for example, Ruhm 1998) and the mental health of 
3:76:4659:27:28:71:539:212:144:Times:144:Times:mothers (Chatterji and Markowitz 2004).  Leaves are also found to be negatively associated with 
3:77:4755:28:27:72:512:184:144:Times:144:Times:infant mortality (e.g., Ruhm 2000). Other studies find that breastfeeding tends to end in the 
3:78:4849:27:37:72:322:157:144:Times:144:Times:month the mother returns to work (Lindberg 1996). 
3:79:4899:37:8:216:219:120:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
3:80:4947:8:16:72:276:112:42:Times:100:Times:1 A summery of initiatives in 2004 can be found at 
3:81:4998:16:11:72:527:96:100:Times:100:Times:http://www.nationalpartnership.org/portals/p3/library/PaidLeave/StateRoundUp2004.pdf  (accessed December 2, 
3:82:5106:11:7:72:100:85:100:Times:100:Times:2004). 
3:83:5113:7:0:72:429:78:42:Times:100:Times:2  Phipps, Burton, and Lethbridge (2001) provide evidence of the family gap for Canada. 
4:84:5202:0:27:107:502:708:144:Times:144:Times:While supportive, these findings must be interpreted with care.  In some cases the 
4:85:5285:27:28:71:523:681:144:Times:144:Times:inference may be biased by heterogeneity across mothers who are eligible for maternity leave 
4:86:5378:28:27:71:537:653:144:Times:144:Times:and mothers who are not.  In addition, much of this evidence suffers from a “causality gap”:  the 
4:87:5476:27:28:71:515:626:144:Times:144:Times:positive outcomes attributed to maternity leaves rest on first stage relationships between the 
4:88:5571:28:28:71:499:598:144:Times:144:Times:mandates and mothers’ labor supply decisions that are theoretically ambiguous, and also 
4:89:5659:28:27:71:288:570:144:Times:144:Times:empirically ambiguous in previous research. 
4:90:5703:27:28:107:529:543:144:Times:144:Times:There are two key questions.  First, how do leave mandates affect the average length of 
4:91:5791:28:27:71:533:515:144:Times:144:Times:time mothers spend at home with their newborns?  This is the necessary first stage to any effect 
4:92:5888:27:28:71:490:488:144:Times:144:Times:of leaves on infants’ or mothers’ health and welfare.  Second, how do leaves affect the 
4:93:5976:28:28:71:507:460:144:Times:144:Times:proportion of mothers who return to employment with the pre-birth employer?  This is the 
4:94:6065:28:27:71:505:432:144:Times:144:Times:necessary first stage to any effect of leaves on females’ long run labor market outcomes.   
4:95:6157:27:28:107:537:405:144:Times:144:Times:The importance of answers to these questions is accentuated by growing recognition that 
4:96:6245:28:27:71:544:377:144:Times:144:Times:the first years of life are crucial to child development, which in turn is important to adult success.  
4:97:6349:27:28:71:521:350:144:Times:144:Times:Furthermore, if leave mandates cause working females to stay home longer with their babies, 
4:98:6441:28:27:71:538:322:144:Times:144:Times:they can serve as an instrument for maternal employment in a child’s first year.  Therefore, there 
4:99:6540:27:28:71:518:295:144:Times:144:Times:is also a link from these leaves to the important literature on maternal employment and child 
4:100:6634:28:28:71:143:267:144:Times:144:Times:development.  
4:101:6648:28:27:107:538:239:144:Times:144:Times:Our contribution in this paper is twofold.  First, we provide new evidence of the effect of 
4:102:6740:27:28:71:530:212:144:Times:144:Times:leave mandates on maternal labor supply.  The results offer clear answers to our two questions, 
4:103:6836:28:27:71:527:184:144:Times:144:Times:and fill in the gap between the mandates and the benefits they are thought to provide.  Second, 
4:104:6932:27:28:71:521:157:144:Times:144:Times:we relate our evidence on the amount of time mothers are at home with their infants to infant 
4:105:7026:28:28:71:523:129:144:Times:144:Times:mortality rates.  This is the link that is missing in previous studies of the relationship between 
4:106:7125:28:27:71:247:101:144:Times:144:Times:leave mandates and mortality rates.  
4:107:7162:27:0:107:535:74:144:Times:144:Times:Our inference is based on Canadian maternity leave mandates.  In Canada, job-protected 
5:108:7250:0:27:72:535:708:144:Times:144:Times:leave mandates are under provincial rather than federal jurisdiction for most workers.  Mothers’ 
5:109:7347:27:28:72:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:leave eligibility varies by time and space rather than by their choices to match with particular 
5:110:7444:28:27:72:539:653:144:Times:144:Times:employers, and is therefore less likely correlated with their unobserved characteristics.  Over our 
5:111:7544:27:28:72:499:626:144:Times:144:Times:sample period we observe the introduction of modest mandates (17-18 weeks) in several 
5:112:7630:28:28:72:424:598:144:Times:144:Times:provinces, followed by widespread expansions of leaves to 29-70 weeks. 
5:113:7701:28:27:108:522:570:144:Times:144:Times:These policy episodes provide an attractive basis for inference.  Exploiting provincial 
5:114:7789:27:28:72:491:543:144:Times:144:Times:differences in mandates and sharp discontinuities across time, we offer clear, graphical 
5:115:7878:28:27:72:512:515:144:Times:144:Times:motivation for our main estimation results.  The wide range of mandates observed provides 
5:116:7968:27:28:71:504:488:144:Times:144:Times:perspective on both the short leaves of the FMLA and the longer leaves available in other 
5:117:8058:28:28:71:127:460:144:Times:144:Times:countries.   
5:118:8071:28:27:107:506:432:144:Times:144:Times:Some of these benefits are manifest in figure 1, where we graph the proportions of 
5:119:8154:27:28:71:531:405:144:Times:144:Times:married females with a child aged less than one who are employed, employed and on leave and 
5:120:8246:28:27:71:522:377:144:Times:144:Times:employed an at work over the sample period.3   Overall employment displays the well known 
5:121:8336:27:28:71:523:350:144:Times:144:Times:positive trend over the period.  Its components, however, display very different patterns.  The 
5:122:8432:28:27:71:536:322:144:Times:144:Times:vertical lines mark two reforms that increased the amount of leave available to mothers.  Each is 
5:123:8530:27:28:71:534:295:144:Times:144:Times:associated with an increase in the proportion of mothers on leave and decrease in the proportion 
5:124:8627:28:28:71:523:267:144:Times:144:Times:at work; most dramatically the reform in 2000.  This provides some prima facie evidence of a 
5:125:8720:28:27:71:434:239:144:Times:144:Times:relationship between leaves and the time mothers stay at home after birth.   
5:126:8797:27:28:107:540:212:144:Times:144:Times:We offer three primary conclusions.  First, the introduction of modest mandates increases 
5:127:8887:28:27:71:514:184:144:Times:144:Times:the proportion of mothers employed and on leave and their job continuity with the pre-birth 
5:128:8979:27:28:71:533:157:144:Times:144:Times:employer, but has little effect on the length of time they are at home with their infants.  Second, 
5:129:9079:28:28:71:541:129:144:Times:144:Times:in contrast to the shorter leaves, mandate extensions significantly increase the period mothers are 
5:130:9179:28:16:71:515:101:144:Times:144:Times:at home post birth, and also increase job continuity over the birth event.  Finally, our results 
5:131:9276:16:7:216:219:85:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
5:132:9324:7:0:72:365:78:42:Times:100:Times:3 This graph is based on Labor Force Survey data described in Section 5. 
6:133:9398:0:27:72:540:708:144:Times:144:Times:indicate that these mandates have no effect on infant health as measured by infant mortality rates 
6:134:9497:27:28:72:256:681:144:Times:144:Times:and the incidence of low birth weight. 
6:135:9536:28:27:72:127:653:144:Times:144:Times:2. Theory  
6:136:9547:27:28:108:529:626:144:Times:144:Times:Klerman and Leibowitz (1997) explore the labor supply effects of maternity leaves in a 
6:137:9634:28:28:72:503:598:144:Times:144:Times:static framework.  With no mandate, employers may voluntarily offer an unpaid (or paid) 
6:138:9722:28:27:72:524:570:144:Times:144:Times:maternity leave.  This is a result of private incentives to preserve good employee matches and 
6:139:9817:27:28:72:523:543:144:Times:144:Times:job-specific human capital.  Females choose between this leave and severing the employment 
6:140:9908:28:27:72:500:515:144:Times:144:Times:relationship to be at home with their child for a longer period.  The cost of quitting is the 
6:141:10002:27:28:72:535:488:144:Times:144:Times:difference between the current wage and the alternative wage.  Females make an optimal choice 
6:142:10096:28:28:72:434:460:144:Times:144:Times:given a reservation wage that declines with each month after giving birth.   
6:143:10173:28:27:108:540:432:144:Times:144:Times:A leave mandate that exceeds the employer’s voluntary offer will lead some females who 
6:144:10260:27:28:71:526:405:144:Times:144:Times:previously would have quit their jobs to remain employed and take the mandated leave.  Also, 
6:145:10353:28:27:71:536:377:144:Times:144:Times:some females who had previously taken the shorter leave offered by the employer will now take 
6:146:10447:27:28:71:537:350:144:Times:144:Times:the additional weeks allowed under the mandate.  Therefore the mandate will reduce the number 
6:147:10541:28:27:71:536:322:144:Times:144:Times:of women quitting their jobs pre-birth to spend time at home, and clearly increase the number of 
6:148:10638:27:28:71:505:295:144:Times:144:Times:women who are employed and on leave over the birth event.  The model has no definitive 
6:149:10725:28:28:71:534:267:144:Times:144:Times:prediction, however, for the average amount of time women are at home with their child.  Some 
6:150:10819:28:27:71:439:239:144:Times:144:Times:females take longer leaves under the mandate but others take shorter leaves. 
6:151:10896:27:28:107:522:212:144:Times:144:Times:Because our analysis focuses on labor market decisions in specific months around the 
6:152:10981:28:27:71:511:184:144:Times:144:Times:month of birth (MOB), it is useful to parse this last prediction from a monthly perspective.  
6:153:11075:27:28:71:532:157:144:Times:144:Times:Women not at home with their child are employed and at work.  In months covered both by the 
6:154:11167:28:28:71:537:129:144:Times:144:Times:employer’s voluntary offer and the leave mandate (e.g., the MOB), there should be no change in 
6:155:11262:28:27:71:531:101:144:Times:144:Times:the proportion employed and at work, as the mandate simply duplicates the pre-existing private 
6:156:11357:27:0:71:541:74:144:Times:144:Times:arrangement.  In months the mandate exceeds the voluntary offer the proportion employed and at 
7:157:11453:0:27:72:519:708:144:Times:144:Times:work should fall. For example, if the voluntary offer is six weeks and the mandate 12 weeks, 
7:158:11546:27:28:72:535:681:144:Times:144:Times:assuming all leaves start at the point of birth the proportion employed and at work should fall in 
7:159:11645:28:27:72:541:653:144:Times:144:Times:weeks 7 through 12.  Finally, in weeks beyond the mandate the proportion employed and at work 
7:160:11739:27:28:72:486:626:144:Times:144:Times:may rise if the mandate encourages those who previously quit their jobs to take leave. 
7:161:11825:28:28:108:536:598:144:Times:144:Times:Leave mandates may also affect women’s wages.  There are two viewpoints.  The first is 
7:162:11912:28:27:72:542:570:144:Times:144:Times:provided by Summers’ (1989) analysis of mandated benefits.  Mandated benefits act like a tax on 
7:163:12008:27:28:72:521:543:144:Times:144:Times:the labor of the eligible group, decreasing their wages (received) and employment.4  Because 
7:164:12101:28:27:71:531:515:144:Times:144:Times:leave mandates increase the cost of employing females in their child bearing years, they should 
7:165:12197:27:28:71:507:488:144:Times:144:Times:lower the wages and employment of this group.5  The second is an informal argument that 
7:166:12285:28:28:71:518:460:144:Times:144:Times:mandates increase job continuity across the birth event so females with children end up with 
7:167:12378:28:27:71:531:432:144:Times:144:Times:higher levels of job specific human capital and are able to remain in good matches.  In the long 
7:168:12475:27:28:71:531:405:144:Times:144:Times:run this should improve this group’s economic stature.  Waldfogel (1998b) argues these effects 
7:169:12570:28:27:71:357:377:144:Times:144:Times:are important to improving the circumstances of mothers.   
7:170:12629:27:28:71:289:350:144:Times:144:Times:3. Previous Evidence on Maternity Leaves 
7:171:12670:28:27:107:529:322:144:Times:144:Times:Most previous studies of maternity leaves and the labor market are based on U.S. data.  
7:172:12758:27:28:71:527:295:144:Times:144:Times:The message of this research is mixed, but the variation of leave entitlement across mothers in 
7:173:12854:28:28:71:539:267:144:Times:144:Times:the U.S. may not provide an ideal forum for this analysis. Historically the provision of leave was 
7:174:12953:28:27:71:531:239:144:Times:144:Times:voluntary.6  Inference from this period is potentially biased by unobserved differences between 
7:175:13049:27:28:72:537:212:144:Times:144:Times:mothers who had access to maternity leave and those that didn’t.  More recently the FMLA (and 
7:176:13143:28:27:72:535:184:144:Times:144:Times:miscellaneous state-specific initiatives) mandates leave, but only for employers with 50 or more 
7:177:13240:27:14:72:503:157:144:Times:144:Times:employees.  Waldfogel (1999) estimates more than one-half of private sector workers are 
7:178:13328:14:8:216:219:143:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
7:179:13376:8:16:72:540:135:42:Times:100:Times:4 In the special case where employees’ valuation of the benefit matches employers’ costs, employment is unchanged 
7:180:13489:16:7:71:262:119:100:Times:100:Times:and the full incidence of the tax falls on wages. 
7:181:13539:7:16:72:529:112:42:Times:100:Times:5 Gruber (1994) uses this framework to investigate the effects of the U.S. Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1979.  
7:182:13653:16:7:71:501:96:100:Times:100:Times:He finds that the main (negative) effect of the Act was on the wages of females in their childbearing years. 
7:183:13762:7:16:72:534:89:42:Times:100:Times:6 A qualification is the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1979 by which firms had to treat pregnancy like any other 
7:184:13877:16:0:72:184:73:100:Times:100:Times:illness in their health plans. 
8:185:13909:0:27:72:503:708:144:Times:144:Times:uncovered.   This means the law affects those who are most likely to have access to leave 
8:186:13999:27:28:72:510:681:144:Times:144:Times:through their large employers, and presents the possibility that females sort across firms of 
8:187:14093:28:27:72:381:653:144:Times:144:Times:different sizes based on their preferences for work around birth. 
8:188:14159:27:28:108:533:626:144:Times:144:Times:Studies of the relationship between the FMLA (or state specific initiatives that preceded 
8:189:14249:28:28:72:517:598:144:Times:144:Times:it) and the employment status of new mothers, or the wages of females in their child bearing 
8:190:14342:28:27:72:523:570:144:Times:144:Times:years, often report no effect or estimates that are sensitive to specification (e.g., Baum 2003b, 
8:191:14440:27:28:71:530:543:144:Times:144:Times:Klerman and Leibowitz 1997,  Waldfogel 1999).  An exception is Waldfogel (1999) who finds 
8:192:14530:28:27:71:530:515:144:Times:144:Times:that the FMLA did increase the proportion of women with a child aged less than one who were 
8:193:14622:27:28:71:533:488:144:Times:144:Times:employed and on leave, but had no effect on overall employment.  Studies of the effect of leave 
8:194:14718:28:28:71:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:on job continuity are a little more optimistic.  Waldfogel (1998a) and Waldfogel et al  (1999) 
8:195:14813:28:27:71:536:432:144:Times:144:Times:show that females who have access to maternity leave are more likely to return to their pre-birth 
8:196:14911:27:28:71:525:405:144:Times:144:Times:employer.  The latter study reports that 64.3 percent of new mothers who have access to leave 
8:197:15005:28:27:71:533:377:144:Times:144:Times:returned to the same employer after childbirth compared to only 42.6 percent of those reporting 
8:198:15101:27:28:71:534:350:144:Times:144:Times:no access.  Baum (2003a) finds that the FMLA increased the proportion of mothers returning to 
8:199:15195:28:27:71:526:322:144:Times:144:Times:their pre-birth job, but his samples are small and the effects vary in statistical significance and 
8:200:15295:27:28:71:253:295:144:Times:144:Times:are sensitive to model specification.   
8:201:15335:28:28:107:530:267:144:Times:144:Times:Klerman and Leibowitz provide perspective on the job continuity results.  Klerman and 
8:202:15421:28:27:71:533:239:144:Times:144:Times:Leibowitz (1994) show that in the pre-FMLA era the vast majority of females who work within 
8:203:15513:27:28:71:540:212:144:Times:144:Times:their child’s first year of life remain employed (although on leave) over the birth event.  Klerman 
8:204:15613:28:27:71:529:184:144:Times:144:Times:and Leibowitz (1999) provide direct evidence (from the NLSY) that, pre-FMLA, 60 percent of 
8:205:15704:27:28:71:546:157:144:Times:144:Times:females working full time before the birth of their child returned to the same employer post-birth.  
8:206:15805:28:0:71:521:129:144:Times:144:Times:This high percentage leaves limited scope for leave mandates to increase job retention unless 
9:207:15900:0:27:72:366:708:144:Times:144:Times:they lead to a substantial increase in the incidence of leave.7  
9:208:15965:27:28:107:532:681:144:Times:144:Times:Studies based on European data provide more decisive inference, although many do not 
9:209:16050:28:27:71:528:653:144:Times:144:Times:directly examine the relationship between leave mandates and mothers’ labor supply.  There is 
9:210:16144:27:28:71:528:626:144:Times:144:Times:evidence that access to leave increases job continuity (Waldfogel et al. 1999).  Also, that leave 
9:211:16242:28:28:71:542:598:144:Times:144:Times:mandates increase the employment of females in their childbearing years (Winegarden and Bracy 
9:212:16336:28:27:71:518:570:144:Times:144:Times:1995 and Ruhm 1998) but decrease their relative wages at extended durations(Ruhm 1998).  
9:213:16425:27:28:71:542:543:144:Times:144:Times:Why mandates have these effects remains an open question.  Ruhm notes the employment effects 
9:214:16518:28:27:71:532:515:144:Times:144:Times:could result from 1) higher proportions of mothers remaining employed over the birth event, 2) 
9:215:16613:27:28:71:538:488:144:Times:144:Times:greater labor participation of childless females to qualify for leave benefits when they have kids, 
9:216:16713:28:28:71:307:460:144:Times:144:Times:and/or 3) new mothers returning to work sooner. 
9:217:16761:28:27:107:538:432:144:Times:144:Times:ten Cate (2000 and 2003) studies the effect of the same Canadian leave mandates studied 
9:218:16849:27:28:72:517:405:144:Times:144:Times:here, but focuses only on employment rates over a broad post-birth period.  She reports they 
9:219:16942:28:27:72:514:377:144:Times:144:Times:increased the relative employment rate of females with children aged 0-2, and increased the 
9:220:17034:27:28:72:359:350:144:Times:144:Times:probability of returning to work within two years of birth.8  
9:221:17096:28:27:107:531:322:144:Times:144:Times:Few studies have examined the relationship between maternity leaves and health. There 
9:222:17182:27:28:71:521:295:144:Times:144:Times:is evidence that European leave mandates decreased infant mortality (Winegarden and Bracy 
9:223:17272:28:28:71:535:267:144:Times:144:Times:1995 and Ruhm 2000).  The primary effect is in the post-neonatal period, the result of mandates 
9:224:17368:28:27:71:533:239:144:Times:144:Times:in excess of 30 weeks.  Research on maternal health suggests longer leaves positively affect the 
9:225:17465:27:28:71:491:212:144:Times:144:Times:mental health, vitality and role function of mothers (McGovern et al. 1997) and reduce 
9:226:17552:28:27:71:488:184:144:Times:144:Times:depressive symptoms, although  not the incidence of clinical depression (Chatterji and 
9:227:17639:27:37:71:168:157:144:Times:144:Times:Markowitz 2004).9  
9:228:17658:37:8:216:219:120:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
9:229:17706:8:11:72:534:112:42:Times:100:Times:7 Significantly, Baum (2003a) reports no effect of the FMLA and state specific mandates on the incidence of leave. 
9:230:17821:11:16:72:530:101:42:Times:100:Times:8 Phipps (2000) looks at the incentive effects of paid maternity leave through the unemployment insurance system 
9:231:17933:16:7:71:361:85:100:Times:100:Times:on fertility and hours worked, finding no evidence of changed behavior. 
9:232:18005:7:0:72:519:78:42:Times:100:Times:9 Lero (2003) provides a summary and references to some additional studies of maternal health after childbirth. 
10:233:18118:0:27:72:282:708:144:Times:144:Times:4. Maternity Leave Mandates in Canada 
10:234:18156:27:28:108:524:681:144:Times:144:Times:Maternity leave defined as a right to return to a pre-birth job after a specified period is 
10:235:18248:28:27:72:523:653:144:Times:144:Times:established by provincial labor standards legislation (or federal labor standards legislation for 
10:236:18346:27:28:72:539:626:144:Times:144:Times:employment in the federal public sector or federally regulated industries).  British Columbia was 
10:237:18444:28:28:72:529:598:144:Times:144:Times:the leader, prohibiting the employment of women for 6 weeks following childbirth through the 
10:238:18537:28:27:72:515:570:144:Times:144:Times:Maternity Protection Act of 1921. New Brunswick was next to act in the 1960s, and the last 
10:239:18628:27:28:72:438:543:144:Times:144:Times:province to introduce a mandate was Prince Edward Island (P.E.I.) in 1982. 
10:240:18703:28:27:108:512:515:144:Times:144:Times:The legislation has several common features across provinces.  First, employees are 
10:241:18787:27:28:72:530:488:144:Times:144:Times:protected from dismissal due to pregnancy.  Second, a maximum period for the leave is always 
10:242:18880:28:28:72:532:460:144:Times:144:Times:prescribed and the leave is specified as unpaid.  Initially the laws of several provinces provided 
10:243:18979:28:27:72:534:432:144:Times:144:Times:guidance to how the period of leave should be split pre- and post-birth, but current practice is to 
10:244:19079:27:28:72:514:405:144:Times:144:Times:leave this to the discretion of the mother and employer.  Third, the laws specify a minimum 
10:245:19170:28:27:72:534:377:144:Times:144:Times:period of employment for eligibility.  This varies widely: initially 52 weeks of employment was 
10:246:19266:27:28:72:512:350:144:Times:144:Times:common, although British Columbia effectively had no requirement.  The recent trend is to 
10:247:19356:28:27:72:499:322:144:Times:144:Times:shorter qualification periods.  Fourth, most laws specify which terms of employment are 
10:248:19444:27:28:72:534:295:144:Times:144:Times:preserved during the leave and any responsibility of the employer to maintain benefits.  Finally, 
10:249:19542:28:28:72:534:267:144:Times:144:Times:the laws of some provinces establish rules for extending leaves due to medical complications or 
10:250:19638:28:27:72:250:239:144:Times:144:Times:pregnancies that continue after term. 
10:251:19676:27:28:108:533:212:144:Times:144:Times:The maximum leave provisions of the federal jurisdiction and the provinces in the years 
10:252:19764:28:27:72:520:184:144:Times:144:Times:1963 through 2002 are listed in table 1.  This same information is graphed in figure 2.  In the 
10:253:19860:27:28:72:537:157:144:Times:144:Times:1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, the provinces introduced mandates at different points in time.  By 
10:254:19957:28:32:72:541:129:144:Times:144:Times:the mid 1980s all provinces mandated 17 or 18 weeks of leave.10  The next major innovation was 
10:255:20052:32:8:216:219:97:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
10:256:20100:8:16:72:531:89:42:Times:100:Times:10 It is possible that this policy variation followed the entry of women into the labor market in different provinces.  
10:257:20219:16:0:71:541:73:100:Times:100:Times:To test this policy endogeneity hypothesis, we regressed the policy variables on lagged province-year cells of female 
11:258:20338:0:27:72:516:708:144:Times:144:Times:in 1990/91 following a change in the treatment of maternity leave under the Unemployment 
11:259:20427:27:28:72:508:681:144:Times:144:Times:Insurance (UI) Act.  Eight of ten provinces increased their mandates to between 29 and 52 
11:260:20517:28:27:72:540:653:144:Times:144:Times:weeks, six of them moving within a six month period.  This change was actually the introduction 
11:261:20612:27:28:72:524:626:144:Times:144:Times:of a parental leave of between 12 and 34 weeks in addition to the existing maternity leave.  In 
11:262:20708:28:28:72:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:most provinces the additional leave could be taken by either the father or mother, although in 
11:263:20803:28:27:72:511:570:144:Times:144:Times:practice the vast majority of these leaves are taken by the mother.11  The final reform is the 
11:264:20898:27:28:71:537:543:144:Times:144:Times:extension of parental leave at the end of 2000, which brought the total amount of leave available 
11:265:20996:28:27:71:521:515:144:Times:144:Times:in all provinces to at least 52 weeks.  Again this change was induced by a reform of the (now 
11:266:21090:27:28:71:527:488:144:Times:144:Times:renamed) Employment Insurance (EI) Act, and seven of ten provinces changed their mandates 
11:267:21180:28:28:71:531:460:144:Times:144:Times:simultaneously.  Quebec had already extended its mandate in excess of one year in 1997, while 
11:268:21274:28:27:71:528:432:144:Times:144:Times:British Columbia and Saskatchewan did not change their mandates until early 2001.  Note that 
11:269:21367:27:28:71:532:405:144:Times:144:Times:the early reforms in figure 2 are staggered through time, while the later reforms are clustered in 
11:270:21466:28:27:71:496:377:144:Times:144:Times:short time-spans.  We accommodate these different patterns of variation in our analysis. 
11:271:21555:27:28:107:534:350:144:Times:144:Times:While provincial standards provide unpaid maternity leaves, leave benefits are available 
11:272:21644:28:27:71:496:322:144:Times:144:Times:to some mothers through the EI system.  EI in Canada provides protection for “earnings 
11:273:21731:27:28:71:537:295:144:Times:144:Times:interruptions” from a variety of sources.  Starting in 1971, the eligible sources were expanded to 
11:274:21830:28:28:71:518:267:144:Times:144:Times:include interruptions due to birth. Our analysis of labor supply starts in 1976, so leaves were 
11:275:21926:28:27:71:347:239:144:Times:144:Times:compensated for some mothers over our sample period.   
11:276:21981:27:28:107:520:212:144:Times:144:Times:In the absence of a job-protected leave mandate, the availability of maternity benefits 
11:277:22069:28:27:71:536:184:144:Times:144:Times:may alter the voluntary leaves offered by employers.  This is because the availability of benefits 
11:278:22168:27:37:71:533:157:144:Times:144:Times:will increase mothers’ reservation wages.  Within the context of the Klerman/Leibowitz model, 
11:279:22262:37:12:539:542:120:144:Times:144:Times:                                                                                                                                                             
11:280:22418:12:12:72:519:108:100:Times:100:Times:labor force participation.  Using lags of 1 to 10 years, we find that previous labor market participation is a poor 
11:281:22534:12:7:72:478:96:100:Times:100:Times:predictor of policy values, with coefficients that are both economically and statistically insignificant. 
11:282:22640:7:16:72:526:89:42:Times:100:Times:11 Most provincial laws stipulate that the parental leave must be completed within a set period post-birth (e.g., 52 
11:283:22757:16:0:72:355:73:100:Times:100:Times:weeks) and must be taken immediately following any maternity leave. 
12:284:22826:0:27:72:524:708:144:Times:144:Times:this will lower the proportion of females choosing the voluntary leave rather than quitting.  In 
12:285:22923:27:28:72:479:681:144:Times:144:Times:response, employers may lengthen their offered leave to retain attractive employees. 
12:286:23008:28:27:108:514:653:144:Times:144:Times:In table 2 we present some features of the EI maternity leave program for the period 
12:287:23093:27:28:72:527:626:144:Times:144:Times:1971-2000.  In the first column is the maximum duration of benefits available to mothers with 
12:288:23187:28:28:72:542:598:144:Times:144:Times:sufficient employment in the qualifying period.12   Benefits are proportional to insurable earnings 
12:289:23287:28:27:71:534:570:144:Times:144:Times:to a cap set roughly at the average wage (column 2).  This proportion, the statutory replacement 
12:290:23384:27:28:71:535:543:144:Times:144:Times:rate, is presented in column 3.  Finally, benefits are available after a two week waiting period so 
12:291:23484:28:27:71:539:515:144:Times:144:Times:the “effective” replacement rate is somewhat lower.  In the third column we present the effective 
12:292:23582:27:28:71:533:488:144:Times:144:Times:replacement rate assuming the individual takes the maximum period of leave.  Over our sample 
12:293:23675:28:28:71:541:460:144:Times:144:Times:period (1976+), females taking the maximum leave and earning less than the average wage could 
12:294:23769:28:27:71:397:432:144:Times:64:Times:expect to receive 50 to 55 percent of their pre-birth compensation.13
12:295:23838:27:28:108:519:405:144:Times:144:Times:The maternity leave provisions of the EI system do not provide (or require) a right of 
12:296:23925:28:27:71:527:377:144:Times:144:Times:return to pre-leave employment.  Therefore, females planning to leave the labor force with the 
12:297:24020:27:28:71:540:350:144:Times:144:Times:birth of their child can be eligible to collect EI benefits.  Also, the EI eligibility provisions do not 
12:298:24125:28:27:71:518:322:144:Times:144:Times:demand the qualifying period of employment be with a single employer.  It is possible that a 
12:299:24218:27:28:71:529:295:144:Times:144:Times:woman could qualify for leave under her provincial standards but fail to qualify for EI benefits 
12:300:24315:28:28:71:229:267:144:Times:144:Times:during the leave, and vice versa. 
12:301:24349:28:27:71:134:239:144:Times:144:Times:5. The Data 
12:302:24361:27:28:71:145:212:144:Times:144:Times:Labor Supply 
12:303:24374:28:28:108:536:184:144:Times:144:Times:The analysis of mothers’ labor supply is based on data from the master files of the Labor 
12:304:24464:28:8:216:219:156:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
12:305:24512:8:17:72:542:148:64:Times:100:Times:12 Initially qualification for benefits required 20 weeks employment in the previous year with earnings greater than 
12:306:24629:17:12:72:544:131:100:Times:100:Times:20  percent  of  maximum  weekly  insurable  earnings  in  each  week,  but  since  1996  qualification  has  been  based  on  
12:307:24756:12:11:72:543:119:100:Times:100:Times:hours of work.  Also, in the 1970s the “magic 10” rule restricted benefits to individuals who could show that 10 of 
12:308:24872:11:12:72:542:108:100:Times:100:Times:the 20 insurable weeks were from the 20 week period between the 31st and 50th weeks before the expected date of 
12:309:24984:12:7:72:514:96:100:Times:144:Times:birth.  This rule, eliminated in 1984, denied benefits to females who entered the labor force after conception.   
12:310:25097:7:16:72:518:89:42:Times:100:Times:13 Until 2000 benefits were taxed back at a 30% rate for beneficiaries whose annual income exceeded 1.5 times 
12:311:25207:16:0:72:193:73:100:Times:100:Times:maximum insurable earnings. 
13:312:25236:0:27:72:525:708:144:Times:144:Times:Force Survey (LFS).  The LFS is a monthly survey designed to provide timely information on 
13:313:25327:27:28:72:538:681:144:Times:144:Times:Canadians’ labor market activity.  The data are collected at the individual level, but it is possible 
13:314:25429:28:27:71:541:653:144:Times:144:Times:to aggregate individuals into families, and associate families with physical dwellings. The survey 
13:315:25528:27:28:71:516:626:144:Times:144:Times:has a rotating panel design. Individuals belong to a rotation group that is interviewed for six 
13:316:25624:28:28:71:507:598:144:Times:144:Times:consecutive months.  The entrance of rotation groups is staggered so that in any month six 
13:317:25715:28:27:71:531:570:144:Times:144:Times:groups are interviewed, with one group entering and another group leaving.  The survey covers 
13:318:25809:27:28:71:541:543:144:Times:144:Times:individuals living in the ten provinces, excluding those on Indian Reserves, full-time members of 
13:319:25907:28:27:71:530:515:144:Times:144:Times:the Armed Forces and inmates of institutions.  Information is collected on current labor market 
13:320:26003:27:28:71:530:488:144:Times:144:Times:status, demographics, job search activities and job characteristics.  The microdata are available 
13:321:26101:28:28:71:193:460:144:Times:144:Times:starting in January 1976. 
13:322:26126:28:27:107:533:432:144:Times:144:Times:We create two samples from these data.  The first takes advantage of the panel structure 
13:323:26215:27:28:72:508:405:144:Times:144:Times:of the survey to identify females who experience a birth and to examine their labor market 
13:324:26306:28:27:72:526:377:144:Times:144:Times:activity in the surrounding period.  All adult records include variables reporting the number of 
13:325:26403:27:28:71:499:350:144:Times:144:Times:own children living at home by the single ages 0 through 24.  We identify births through 
13:326:26492:28:27:71:540:322:144:Times:144:Times:increments in the number of own children less than one year of age between the first and second, 
13:327:26589:27:28:71:529:295:144:Times:144:Times:second and third, ..., fifth and sixth months of a rotation.14  The month this variable changes is 
13:328:26688:28:28:71:527:267:144:Times:144:Times:denoted the “month of birth”.  Assuming a uniform distribution of births within a given month 
13:329:26782:28:27:71:532:239:144:Times:144:Times:period, the survey information for the MOB is collected when the newborn is two weeks old on 
13:330:26875:27:28:71:517:212:144:Times:144:Times:average.  Depending on when the birth occurs we can observe labor market status up to four 
13:331:26966:28:27:71:530:184:144:Times:144:Times:months preceding or following the birth.  For example, if the birth occurs between the first and 
13:332:27063:27:37:71:541:157:144:Times:144:Times:second month of the rotation, we observe labor market activity in the month before the MOB and 
13:333:27158:37:8:216:219:120:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
13:334:27206:8:16:72:521:112:42:Times:100:Times:14 The strategy of identifying births only works for years prior to 1996 when demographic information for other 
13:335:27318:16:11:72:537:96:100:Times:100:Times:children was collected once in the first month of interview.  Starting 1996, this demographic information is updated 
13:336:27434:11:12:72:532:85:100:Times:100:Times:monthly.  Therefore, a change in the number of children less than one could result from a child having his/her first 
13:337:27550:12:0:72:110:73:100:Times:100:Times:birthday. 
14:338:27562:0:27:72:536:708:144:Times:144:Times:in the four months following.  If the birth occurs between the fifth and sixth months, we observe 
14:339:27660:27:28:72:375:681:144:Times:144:Times:up to four months before the MOB, but no months following.   
14:340:27721:28:27:108:532:653:144:Times:144:Times:We next form samples with monthly observations on labor supply for particular months 
14:341:27806:27:28:72:515:626:144:Times:144:Times:over the birth event.  For example, one sample contains monthly observations for the MOB, 
14:342:27896:28:28:72:532:598:144:Times:144:Times:while another contains the observations for one month after birth. Because births occurring in a 
14:343:27993:28:27:72:542:570:144:Times:144:Times:given month will come from different rotation groups, women will be captured at different points 
14:344:28090:27:28:72:501:543:144:Times:144:Times:in the rotation.  This means we capture pre- and post-birth labor supply for subsets of the 
14:345:28182:28:27:72:512:515:144:Times:144:Times:mothers having births in any given calendar month.  For example, we observe labor market 
14:346:28271:27:28:72:520:488:144:Times:144:Times:status three months prior to birth for only for a subset of the women who give birth in March 
14:347:28365:28:28:72:526:460:144:Times:144:Times:1985.  This is because some of these mothers entered the survey in February (or January), one 
14:348:28459:28:27:72:214:432:144:Times:144:Times:(two) month(s) prior to birth. 
14:349:28490:27:28:108:500:405:144:Times:144:Times:The second sample we create is a time series of cross sections (TSCS).  We draw 
14:350:28570:28:27:72:519:377:144:Times:144:Times:observations from the April and October surveys of each year.15  Our target group is females 
14:351:28663:27:28:71:518:350:144:Times:144:Times:with a child aged less than one.  The advantages of this sample are that we have much larger 
14:352:28756:28:27:71:511:322:144:Times:144:Times:sample sizes and that we capture women up to 12 months past the birth month, providing a 
14:353:28845:27:28:71:419:295:144:Times:144:Times:broader view of any changes in leave incidence and time spent at home. 
14:354:28916:28:28:107:532:267:144:Times:144:Times:We focus on “married” (married or cohabitating) adult (aged 20-39) females.  An initial 
14:355:29004:28:27:71:534:239:144:Times:144:Times:analysis revealed that unmarried mothers respond differently to leave mandates, but the number 
14:356:29099:27:28:71:517:212:144:Times:144:Times:of these women is too small in our data to conduct a full analysis.  We also exclude births to 
14:357:29194:28:27:71:533:184:144:Times:144:Times:married teenage mothers.  Our reasoning is that this group often has stronger family ties, and so 
14:358:29292:27:28:71:540:157:144:Times:144:Times:may make different decisions than older females whom we expect are more independent.   Again 
14:359:29385:28:28:71:398:129:144:Times:144:Times:sample sizes are too small to allow a separate analysis of teenagers.

15:363:29611:0:27:108:501:708:144:Times:144:Times:We measure infant health using annual vital statistics data on perinatal and infant

15:365:29792:28:27:72:483:653:144:Times:144:Times:these data and the control variables used in this analysis is provided in the appendix.

15:367:29976:28:28:71:202:598:144:Times:144:Times:6. Empirical Framework 
15:368:29999:28:27:71:145:570:144:Times:144:Times:Labor Supply 
15:369:30012:27:28:107:529:543:144:Times:144:Times:We use a variety of empirical strategies to accommodate the different types of mandate 
15:370:30099:28:27:71:492:515:144:Times:144:Times:variation we observe over the sample period (see figure 2).  We begin investigating the 
15:371:30187:27:28:71:512:488:144:Times:144:Times:introduction of 17-18 week mandates in Alberta, Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island and 
15:372:30274:28:28:71:492:460:144:Times:144:Times:Quebec and the mandate extensions from 12 to 18 weeks in British Columbia and New 
15:373:30356:28:27:71:498:432:144:Times:144:Times:Brunswick.  The analysis uses data from January 1976 through October 1990.  The base 
15:374:30441:27:32:71:402:405:144:Times:144:Times:estimating equation, for either our panel-based or TSCS samples, is  
15:375:30510:32:28:291:445:373:49:Times:144:Times:iptiptptiptXWKSLVyεβα++⋅=                                    (1)            
15:376:30586:28:28:71:506:345:144:Times:144:Times:where i indexes individuals, p provinces and t months.  WKSLV is weeks of mandated job-
15:377:30673:28:28:71:532:317:144:Times:144:Times:protected maternity leave. For the panel-based sample we code this variable using the statute in 
15:378:30770:28:27:71:526:289:144:Times:144:Times:effect in the month preceding the MOB.  For the TSCS sample we experiment coding WKSLV 
15:379:30857:27:28:71:521:262:144:Times:144:Times:either using the statute effective in the current month or a lagged statute.  Since our sample is 
15:380:30955:28:27:71:523:234:144:Times:144:Times:mothers with children aged less than one, the current statute will only be “correct”17 for those 
15:381:31052:27:28:71:533:207:144:Times:144:Times:who gave birth very recently.  By lagging the statute we ensure correct coding for mothers with 
15:382:31148:28:28:71:413:179:144:Times:144:Times:less recent births to discover if our results are sensitive on this margin. 
15:383:31224:28:27:107:524:151:144:Times:144:Times: The Xipt are control variables: province effects, year effects, calendar month effects, a 
15:384:31314:27:16:71:521:124:144:Times:144:Times:cubic in age, education (three categories) and a control for any other children aged 1-24.  For 
15:385:31410:16:7:216:219:108:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
15:386:31458:7:16:72:510:101:42:Times:100:Times:16 Detailed data covering the most recent expansions will soon be available, so we leave study of other health 
15:387:31568:16:7:72:174:85:100:Times:100:Times:measures to future work. 
15:388:31593:7:0:72:510:78:42:Times:100:Times:17 If the mandate has not changed recently, the coding will also be correct for mothers with less recent births. 
16:389:31708:0:27:72:541:708:144:Times:144:Times:specifications in which we add additional control groups, we include second order interactions of 
16:390:31806:27:28:72:254:681:144:Times:144:Times:province, year, and a mother dummy. 
16:391:31842:28:27:108:536:653:144:Times:144:Times:Our dependent variables are 0/1 indicators that the individual is “employed and at work” 
16:392:31931:27:28:72:526:626:144:Times:144:Times:or “employed and on leave”.  For our panel-based data we define these variables for the MOB 
16:393:32023:28:28:72:514:598:144:Times:144:Times:and for the first and second months preceding, and first through third months following, the 
16:394:32116:28:27:72:511:570:144:Times:144:Times:MOB.18   In our TSCS data they are defined for the month of observation, and record labor 
16:395:32206:27:28:71:392:543:144:Times:144:Times:market status over the one year period following the date of birth.  
16:396:32275:28:27:99:540:515:144:Times:144:Times:For the panel-based data we also create indicators of pre/post birth job continuity.  First are 
16:397:32371:27:28:71:524:488:144:Times:144:Times:0/1 indicators that the individual left a job, or left a job for personal reasons, in the 12 months 
16:398:32471:28:28:71:538:460:144:Times:144:Times:preceding the MOB.  Second is a 0/1 indicator that the individual is employed in the third month 
16:399:32568:28:27:71:524:432:144:Times:144:Times:following the MOB and has job tenure of three months or longer.  This variable is intended to 
16:400:32662:27:28:71:525:405:144:Times:144:Times:capture the proportion of mothers who are employed post-birth with their pre-birth employer.  
16:401:32756:28:27:71:514:377:144:Times:144:Times:This interpretation is problematic if individuals who quit their jobs pre-birth, but eventually 
16:402:32852:27:28:71:539:350:144:Times:144:Times:return to their pre-birth employer, report their tenure post-birth as starting at the time of return to 
16:403:32956:28:27:71:543:322:144:Times:144:Times:their job.  In the appendix we investigate this issue and present evidence that individuals interpret 
16:404:33058:27:28:71:538:295:144:Times:144:Times:the tenure question to ask when they initially started work with their current employer, not when 
16:405:33156:28:28:71:500:267:144:Times:144:Times:the current employment period with the employer started.  More detail on dependent and 
16:406:33243:28:27:71:337:239:144:Times:144:Times:explanatory variables is also provided in the appendix. 
16:407:33299:27:28:107:536:212:144:Times:144:Times:Equation (1) is estimated by ordinary least-squares (OLS).  Standard errors are corrected 
16:408:33389:28:27:71:521:184:144:Times:144:Times:for heteroskedasticity and, following the guidance in Hansen (2004), calculated clustering on 
16:409:33483:27:37:71:519:157:144:Times:144:Times:province to account for serial correlation within province.19  We also estimate variants of (1) 
16:410:33579:37:8:216:219:120:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
16:411:33627:8:16:72:501:112:42:Times:100:Times:18 While we can also construct a measure of employment for the fourth month following birth, many of the 
16:412:33732:16:7:72:516:96:100:Times:100:Times:province/year cells for this variable are empty over the period that the mandates were introduced (1976-1982). 
16:413:33843:7:16:72:530:89:42:Times:100:Times:19  Hansen reports that this method produces tests of approximately correct size, but of less power than tests based 
16:414:33959:16:0:72:537:73:100:Times:100:Times:on feasible GLS.  The standard errors calculated this way are mostly marginally larger than the estimates calculated 
17:415:34077:0:27:72:536:708:144:Times:144:Times:which add province-specific linear trends, or add married males aged 20-39 or married childless 
17:416:34173:27:28:72:541:681:144:Times:144:Times:females aged 20-39 to the sample.  In the latter case, we add a full set of interactions between 0/1 
17:417:34274:28:27:72:503:653:144:Times:144:Times:indicators that the individual is female or a mom and all the other explanatory variables.   
17:418:34367:27:28:108:525:626:144:Times:144:Times:We also investigate the introduction of parental leave in 1990-92, and the extension of 
17:419:34455:28:28:72:513:598:144:Times:144:Times:parental leave in 2000-2001.   In table 3 we present the dates of these reforms by province.  
17:420:34549:28:27:72:510:570:144:Times:144:Times:Because in both cases many provinces moved almost simultaneously, a conventional cross-
17:421:34636:27:28:72:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:section time-series identification strategy is not effective.  We therefore use a framework that 
17:422:34733:28:27:72:542:515:144:Times:144:Times:compares variables of interest immediately before and after the reforms were implemented, using 
17:423:34829:27:28:72:322:488:144:Times:144:Times:a variety of strategies to control for secular trends.   
17:424:34886:28:31:108:237:460:144:Times:144:Times:The estimating equation is 
17:425:34913:31:29:241:374:429:49:Times:144:Times:iptiptptiptXPOSTyεβα++⋅=                        (2)            
17:426:34976:29:28:71:540:400:144:Times:144:Times:where POST is a 0/1 indicator that the province’s leave mandate has been extended.    It captures 
17:427:35074:28:28:71:526:372:144:Times:144:Times:the average effect of these mandate extensions. The dependent variables are the same as in (1) 
17:428:35169:28:27:71:528:344:144:Times:144:Times:with the addition of employment status captured in the fourth month following the MOB.  The 
17:429:35261:27:28:71:520:317:144:Times:144:Times:additional explanatory variables are the same as in (1) with the exception of the year effects.  
17:430:35358:28:27:71:528:289:144:Times:144:Times:Because there is little temporal variation in POST across provinces, year effects will absorb all 
17:431:35456:27:28:71:541:262:144:Times:144:Times:the variation in the dependent variable due to the mandate reforms.  We approach this problem in 
17:432:35553:28:28:71:491:234:144:Times:144:Times:two ways.  In the first we exclude any controls for time, but limit the data to the period 
17:433:35643:28:27:71:522:206:144:Times:144:Times:immediately surrounding the reforms.  For the 1990 introduction of parental leave we use the 
17:434:35736:27:28:71:534:179:144:Times:144:Times:samples January 1990 through December 1991 and July 1989 through December 1992.  For the 
17:435:35825:28:31:71:533:151:144:Times:144:Times:2000 extension of parental leave we use the samples January 2000 through December 2001 and 
17:436:35916:31:12:539:542:120:144:Times:144:Times:                                                                                                                                                             
17:437:36072:12:12:72:505:108:100:Times:100:Times:clustering on province/year to account for the fact WKSLV only varies by province and time.  This might be 
17:438:36179:12:11:71:523:96:100:Times:100:Times:expected, as estimates of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd order autocorrelations, making approximate adjustment for the fixed 
17:439:36293:11:12:72:530:85:100:Times:100:Times:effects bias (Solon 1984), are generally quite small.  Cases in which the estimated standard errors are smaller than 
17:440:36410:12:0:72:276:73:100:Times:100:Times:those clustering on province/year are noted below. 
18:441:36463:0:27:72:538:708:144:Times:144:Times:July 1999 through December 2002.  In the second approach we use a longer time period and add 
18:442:36556:27:28:72:540:681:144:Times:144:Times:a polynomial in time.  This amounts to a regression discontinuity design, where the discontinuity 
18:443:36654:28:27:71:541:653:144:Times:144:Times:in leave entitlement occurs in the months reported in table 3.  In either approach we also estimate 
18:444:36754:27:28:71:534:626:144:Times:64:Times:(2) adding married males or married childless females as additional controls for secular trends.20

18:446:36868:28:27:108:513:570:144:Times:144:Times:Our analysis of infant health is based on annual data for the period 1961-2001.  The 
18:447:36953:27:32:72:182:543:144:Times:144:Times:estimating equation is  
18:448:36977:32:28:254:363:511:49:Times:144:Times:ptptptptXWKSLVyεβα++⋅=                (3)        
18:449:37026:28:28:71:532:483:144:Times:144:Times:where p indexes provinces and t indexes years.  The explanatory variables follow Ruhm (2000) 
18:450:37119:28:28:71:538:455:144:Times:144:Times:and include province and year effects, the employment population ratio of females aged 15+, the 
18:451:37215:28:27:71:516:427:144:Times:144:Times:fertility rate defined as the ratio of annual births to the female population aged 15 to 44, real 
18:452:37313:27:28:71:517:400:144:Times:144:Times:provincial GDP per capita and total provincial health expenditures as a percent of GDP. The 
18:453:37405:28:28:71:530:372:144:Times:144:Times:dependent variables are the perinatal, neonatal, post-neonatal and infant mortality rates and the 
18:454:37503:28:27:71:535:344:144:Times:144:Times:proportion of births that are low birth weight (<2500 grams).  Again a more detailed description 
18:455:37600:27:28:71:503:317:144:Times:144:Times:of these variables is available in the appendix.  We estimate (3) by OLS and calculate the 
18:456:37691:28:27:71:526:289:144:Times:144:Times:standard errors correcting for heteroskedasticity and clustering on province.  We also estimate 
18:457:37787:27:28:71:396:262:144:Times:144:Times:variants of (3) that add province-specific linear or quadratic trends. 
18:458:37858:28:28:71:224:234:144:Times:144:Times:7. The Results~Labor Supply 
18:459:37886:28:27:107:524:206:144:Times:144:Times:In table 4 we present descriptive statistics of the labor supply variables from the panel-
18:460:37976:27:28:71:540:179:144:Times:144:Times:based sample for the period 1976-2003. The proportion of mothers employed and on leave peaks 
18:461:38069:28:31:71:528:151:144:Times:144:Times:in the MOB at 42 percent, and then declines to 27 percent by the fourth month following.  The 
18:462:38163:31:8:216:219:120:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
18:463:38211:8:16:72:492:112:42:Times:100:Times:20 In this case we calculate the standard errors correcting for heteroskedasticity and random effects at the 
18:464:38320:16:11:72:529:96:100:Times:100:Times:province/year level.  Given the short temporal dimension of the sample we do not expect serial correlation to be a 
18:465:38434:11:12:72:531:85:100:Times:100:Times:problem.  Calculating the standard errors clustering only on province leads to substantially smaller standard errors 
18:466:38551:12:0:72:165:73:100:Times:100:Times:than the ones reported. 
19:467:38577:0:27:72:513:708:144:Times:144:Times:proportion employed and at work is very low in the MOB and two months following, at ten 
19:468:38665:27:28:72:523:681:144:Times:144:Times:percent or less.  Note that the complement of being employed and at work variable is being at 
19:469:38759:28:27:72:449:653:144:Times:144:Times:home, whether it be not in the labor force, unemployed or employed on leave. 
19:470:38836:27:28:108:537:626:144:Times:144:Times:In the second panel we present some measures of job continuity.  While in the regression 
19:471:38925:28:28:72:516:598:144:Times:144:Times:analysis we use unconditional measures, here we present the proportion of mothers working 
19:472:39015:28:27:72:537:570:144:Times:144:Times:three or four months after the MOB with tenure greater than three or four months conditional on 
19:473:39111:27:28:72:532:543:144:Times:144:Times:employment.  Viewed this way, Klerman and Leibowitz’s (1994, 1999) point is clear – the vast 
19:474:39204:28:27:72:471:515:144:Times:144:Times:majority of mothers working at this time have returned to their pre-birth employer.

19:476:39344:28:28:108:540:460:144:Times:144:Times:While equation (1) compares provinces changing their mandates to all other provinces, in 
19:477:39433:28:27:72:539:432:144:Times:144:Times:figure 3 we present an Ontario/Quebec comparison to motivate our identification strategy. These 
19:478:39529:27:28:72:519:405:144:Times:144:Times:adjacent provinces are of similar size and economic structure. We focus on the month before 
19:479:39621:28:27:72:528:377:144:Times:144:Times:birth, because in the months other than the MOB the mandate is less likely to duplicate private 
19:480:39717:27:28:72:534:350:144:Times:144:Times:arrangements. The statistic reported is the (annual) proportion of mothers on leave.  Ontario has 
19:481:39815:28:27:72:530:322:144:Times:144:Times:a mandate of 17 weeks throughout the sample period while Quebec introduces a mandate of 18 
19:482:39906:27:28:72:535:295:144:Times:144:Times:weeks in 1978 (indicated by the vertical line).  Prior to the Quebec reform the proportions in the 
19:483:40005:28:28:72:536:267:144:Times:144:Times:two provinces are very similar.  Starting the year of the reform, the proportion in Quebec begins 
19:484:40103:28:27:72:398:239:144:Times:144:Times:a steeper trajectory and a substantial Quebec/Ontario gap emerges.  
19:485:40171:27:28:108:541:212:144:Times:144:Times:In the first panel of table 5 we present estimates of the effect of WKSLV on the proportion 
19:486:40262:28:27:72:527:184:144:Times:144:Times:employed and on leave in the months surrounding birth.  Guided by the 1985 Maternity Leave 
19:487:40353:27:28:72:541:157:144:Times:144:Times:Survey we focus on the period two months before the MOB through three months following.21 In 
19:488:40446:28:21:71:533:129:144:Times:144:Times:this survey, which was conducted after leave mandates were enacted in all provinces, maternity

19:490:40589:7:16:72:520:101:42:Times:100:Times:21 The Maternity Leave Survey was an addendum to the February 1985 LFS, investigating the circumstances of 
19:491:40696:16:12:72:528:85:100:Times:100:Times:maternity leaves among females whose last absence from work or last two absences (of two weeks or more) from 
19:492:40804:12:0:72:227:73:100:Times:100:Times:work included one due to pregnancy.   
20:493:40844:0:27:72:439:708:144:Times:64:Times:leaves started six weeks before birth on average, four weeks at the median.22
20:494:40921:27:28:108:514:681:144:Times:144:Times:The first column results indicate some statistically significant impacts in the months 
20:495:41008:28:27:71:537:653:144:Times:144:Times:preceding the MOB.  The smaller and statistically insignificant estimates for the MOB and three 
20:496:41104:27:28:71:506:626:144:Times:144:Times:months following are plausible if the mandates duplicated existing private arrangements.   
20:497:41195:28:28:108:535:598:144:Times:144:Times:In the second column we add linear provincial trends.  There are strong secular trends in 
20:498:41285:28:27:71:509:570:144:Times:144:Times:mothers’ labor supply over the period (figure 1), and some part of it likely has a provincial 
20:499:41379:27:28:71:492:543:144:Times:144:Times:characteristic.  The estimate in the second month preceding the MOB is now small and 
20:500:41464:28:27:71:542:515:144:Times:144:Times:statistically insignificant.   We now also see statistically significant effects in all the other months 
20:501:41569:27:28:71:542:488:144:Times:144:Times:surrounding birth, which imply economically significant increases in the proportion on leave.  To 
20:502:41667:28:28:71:535:460:144:Times:144:Times:calibrate, we use averages of the dependent variables in the provinces that introduced mandates, 
20:503:41764:28:27:71:524:432:144:Times:144:Times:over the years there was no mandate in place.23  In the MOB, the estimate of 0.0031 per week 
20:504:41857:27:28:71:535:405:144:Times:144:Times:implies that an 18 week mandate leads to a 5.5 percentage point increase in this proportion off a 
20:505:41955:28:27:71:537:377:144:Times:144:Times:pre-mandate base of 18 percent.  In the third month following birth the effect is nine points off a 
20:506:42055:27:28:71:173:350:144:Times:144:Times:base of six percent.   
20:507:42078:28:27:107:540:322:144:Times:144:Times:In column 3 we address the problem of workers in the federal sector who have a different 
20:508:42167:27:28:71:494:295:144:Times:144:Times:leave mandate (see table 1). The federal sector covers federal public administration and 
20:509:42256:28:28:71:520:267:144:Times:144:Times:industries such as banking, and some parts of the transportation and communication sectors.  
20:510:42349:28:27:71:506:239:144:Times:144:Times:Workers in this sector represent four to five percent of employment at the aggregate level. 
20:511:42441:27:28:71:536:212:144:Times:144:Times:Industrial codes in the LFS (4-digit NAICS) do not allow us to uniquely identify these workers.  
20:512:42538:28:27:71:502:184:144:Times:144:Times:Therefore, we delete all individuals who, as of the MOB, had current or previous (last 12 
20:513:42628:27:28:71:496:157:144:Times:144:Times:months) employment in a 4-digit industry that contained federal workers.  The resulting 
20:514:42716:28:32:71:523:129:144:Times:144:Times:estimates are marginally larger than in column 2, although the differences are not statistically 
20:515:42813:32:8:216:219:97:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
20:516:42861:8:11:72:341:89:42:Times:100:Times:22 Recall that in the MOB newborns are two weeks old on average. 
20:517:42926:11:0:72:455:78:42:Times:100:Times:23 We use 1976-June 1978 data for Newfoundland, PEI and Quebec, and 1976 data for Alberta. 
21:518:43019:0:27:72:132:708:144:Times:144:Times:significant.  
21:519:43033:27:28:108:539:681:144:Times:144:Times:Given that many women were not employed pre-birth or were self-employed, our sample 
21:520:43117:28:27:72:534:653:144:Times:144:Times:includes women who were not eligible for leave.  To isolate individuals who are eligible to take 
21:521:43214:27:28:72:504:626:144:Times:144:Times:leave we exclude anyone who as of the MOB had not worked in the previous year in paid 
21:522:43300:28:28:72:496:598:144:Times:144:Times:employment (the LFS does not have enough work history information to implement the 
21:523:43383:28:27:72:502:570:144:Times:144:Times:province-specific employment requirements).  The result, as expected, is larger estimates 
21:524:43473:27:28:72:516:543:144:Times:144:Times:(column 4).  In the months following the MOB an 18 week mandate raises the proportion of 
21:525:43562:28:27:72:485:515:144:Times:144:Times:these mothers on leave between 10 and 14 percentage points.  Again, these results are 
21:526:43648:27:28:72:198:488:144:Times:144:Times:economically significant.  
21:527:43675:28:28:108:527:460:144:Times:144:Times:In the last two columns we add, sequentially, married males or childless females to the 
21:528:43763:28:27:72:540:432:144:Times:144:Times:sample as an additional control for province-specific trends.  If the mandates had no independent 
21:529:43861:27:28:72:523:405:144:Times:144:Times:effect on these control groups we would expect the results to be similar to those in column 2.  
21:530:43957:28:27:72:533:377:144:Times:144:Times:This is exactly what we find when adding males (column 5), and to a lesser extent when adding 
21:531:44051:27:28:72:486:350:144:Times:144:Times:childless females.  Certainly these experiments do not overturn our original inference. 
21:532:44139:28:27:108:524:322:144:Times:144:Times:The second panel of table 5 contains results for the proportion employed and at work.  
21:533:44226:27:28:71:520:295:144:Times:144:Times:Here, the full sample of mothers (that is, not conditional on work in the past 12 months) is of 
21:534:44321:28:28:71:515:267:144:Times:144:Times:particular interest, because we wish to discover whether the mandates increase time spent at 
21:535:44414:28:27:71:539:239:144:Times:144:Times:home.  The specifications and samples vary across columns as in the upper panel.  The estimates 
21:536:44510:27:28:71:531:212:144:Times:144:Times:provide little evidence that the mandates decreased work in the period surrounding birth.  Most 
21:537:44606:28:27:71:536:184:144:Times:144:Times:are uniformly small and statistically insignificant.  The exception is when we restrict the sample 
21:538:44705:27:28:71:516:157:144:Times:144:Times:to mothers with recent (paid) employment.  Here some of the estimates approach economic, 
21:539:44794:28:28:71:542:129:144:Times:144:Times:although not statistical, significance. There are also some positive and significant estimates in the 
21:540:44896:28:0:71:513:101:144:Times:144:Times:second month preceding the MOB, but statistical significance in this case is sensitive to the 
22:541:44992:0:27:72:292:708:144:Times:144:Times:method for calculating the standard errors.24   
22:542:45040:27:28:108:511:681:144:Times:144:Times:In table 6 we present estimates of the effect of the mandates on job continuity.  The 
22:543:45126:28:27:71:540:653:144:Times:144:Times:dependent variable in the first row is the proportion of females employed in the third month after 
22:544:45225:27:28:71:536:626:144:Times:144:Times:birth with current tenure greater than three months.  Conditional on province specific trends, the 
22:545:45324:28:28:71:541:598:144:Times:144:Times:estimates for WKSLV are all positive and mostly statistically significant.25  In the second column, 
22:546:45424:28:27:71:527:570:144:Times:144:Times:an 18 week mandate is estimated to raise the proportion by about 6 percentage points off a pre-
22:547:45519:27:28:71:214:543:144:Times:144:Times:mandate base of 21 percent.   
22:548:45549:28:27:107:537:515:144:Times:144:Times:There is a consistently statistically significant negative effect on the proportion leaving a 
22:549:45643:27:28:71:542:488:144:Times:144:Times:job within the 12 months preceding birth, and it is driven by exits for personal or family reasons.  
22:550:45744:28:28:71:516:460:144:Times:144:Times:In the second column, an 18 week mandate lowers the proportion by roughly 5.5 percentage 
22:551:45833:28:27:71:532:432:144:Times:144:Times:points (off a pre-mandate base of 35 percent).  Note that this estimate roughly matches both the 
22:552:45930:27:28:71:527:405:144:Times:144:Times:increase in the proportion of these women employed at 3 months after the MOB with their pre 
22:553:46022:28:27:71:528:377:144:Times:144:Times:birth employer, and the increase in the proportion employed and on leave for this specification 
22:554:46118:27:28:71:530:350:144:Times:144:Times:from the first panel.  The estimated change is ten percentage points for the sample who worked 
22:555:46213:28:27:71:537:322:144:Times:144:Times:in the 12 months preceding birth, which is perhaps the more appropriate sample since those who 
22:556:46308:27:28:71:261:295:144:Times:144:Times:were not working have no job to leave. 
22:557:46347:28:28:107:536:267:144:Times:144:Times:In table 7 we present estimates from the TSCS sample.  This exercise cross validates our 
22:558:46436:28:27:71:521:239:144:Times:144:Times:panel inference and provides better perspective on the average amount of time mothers are at 
22:559:46529:27:28:71:538:212:144:Times:144:Times:home with their infants.  Because the sample contains mothers up to a year post birth, it captures 
22:560:46628:28:27:71:521:184:144:Times:144:Times:both those who might take longer leaves as a result of the mandate, and those that might take 
22:561:46722:27:28:71:526:157:144:Times:144:Times:shorter leaves. The results are consistent with the estimates from the panel data.  First, there is 
22:562:46822:28:32:71:534:129:144:Times:144:Times:evidence of an effect on the proportion of mothers employed and on leave: an 18 week mandate 
22:563:46915:32:8:216:219:97:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
22:564:46963:8:11:72:540:89:42:Times:100:Times:24 In this case clustering on province produces substantially smaller standard errors than clustering on province/year. 
22:565:47083:11:0:72:540:78:42:Times:100:Times:25 If the standard errors are calculated clustering on province/year, most estimates are at most marginally significant. 
23:566:47206:0:27:72:518:708:144:Times:144:Times:raises the proportion 2.5 percentage points (column 2).  Second, estimates for the proportion 
23:567:47300:27:28:72:532:681:144:Times:144:Times:employed and at work are mostly small and uniformly statistically insignificant.  This indicates 
23:568:47397:28:27:72:516:653:144:Times:144:Times:no change on average in the period mothers are at home in the first year.  We present results 
23:569:47491:27:28:72:531:626:144:Times:144:Times:coding WKSLV to current and three month lagged mandates, the latter matching the mandate to 
23:570:47583:28:28:72:491:598:144:Times:144:Times:mothers with three month old children.  The estimates are not sensitive on this margin. 
23:571:47671:28:27:108:497:570:144:Times:144:Times:These results provide strong and robust evidence that the introduction and initial 
23:572:47754:27:28:72:527:543:144:Times:144:Times:expansions of leave mandates in the 1970s and 1980s led to increased leave taking.  However, 
23:573:47847:28:27:72:545:515:144:Times:144:Times:we find no consistent evidence that women switched to leaves from being employed and at work.  
23:574:47942:27:28:72:506:488:144:Times:144:Times:Instead, the evidence suggests that women staying at home with their child switched from 
23:575:48030:28:28:72:512:460:144:Times:144:Times:leaving their jobs to taking leave.  Importantly, this finding provides no basis to expect any 
23:576:48125:28:27:72:527:432:144:Times:144:Times:consequent change in the infants’ or the mothers’ health, since time at home does not change.  
23:577:48220:27:28:72:511:405:144:Times:144:Times:We also find a sharp decrease in job separations, which is accompanied with an increase in 
23:578:48311:28:27:72:513:377:144:Times:144:Times:retention of the pre-birth job.  This indicates that the introduction of leave can help females 
23:579:48407:27:28:72:344:350:144:Times:144:Times:preserve job specific human capital over the birth event. 
23:580:48465:28:27:72:458:322:144:Times:144:Times:An Extension of Mandated Leave: the 1990 Introduction of Parental Leave 
23:581:48537:27:28:108:537:295:144:Times:144:Times:The introduction of parental leave starting in 1990 increased the amount of job-protected 
23:582:48627:28:28:72:523:267:144:Times:144:Times:leave available to new mothers from 17-18 weeks to 29-52 weeks. To motivate our results, in 
23:583:48719:28:27:72:535:239:144:Times:144:Times:figures 4 and 5 we present semi-annual estimates of the proportion of mothers employed and on 
23:584:48813:27:28:72:532:212:144:Times:144:Times:leave in the provinces of British Columbia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Quebec 
23:585:48904:28:27:72:504:184:144:Times:144:Times:between 1985 and 1996.  These four provinces introduced parental leave over the first six 
23:586:48994:27:28:72:518:157:144:Times:144:Times:months of 1991, which is indicated by a vertical line in each graph.  While there is a definite 
23:587:49090:28:28:72:524:129:144:Times:144:Times:upward trend in the proportion employed and on leave in the MOB (figure 4) over the period, 
23:588:49182:28:27:72:529:101:144:Times:144:Times:there is at best subtle evidence of a break in the first half of 1991. In contrast, the graph for the 
23:589:49284:27:0:72:526:74:144:Times:144:Times:fourth month following the MOB (figure 5) displays an obvious upward shift starting in 1991. 
24:590:49379:0:27:108:528:708:144:Times:144:Times:In table 8 we report estimates of POST from equation (2) for the proportions employed 
24:591:49464:27:28:71:529:681:144:Times:144:Times:and on leave and at work.  Given the results in table 5, we focus on months in which mandated 
24:592:49558:28:27:71:529:653:144:Times:144:Times:leave was most likely unavailable before the extension: two months before the MOB and three 
24:593:49650:27:28:71:520:626:144:Times:144:Times:and four months following.  The results in the first column are from data for 1990 and 1991.  
24:594:49744:28:28:71:529:598:144:Times:144:Times:There is strong evidence of an increase in leave and offsetting decrease in work at four months 
24:595:49840:28:27:71:535:570:144:Times:144:Times:after birth.  The estimates indicate offsetting changes of more than ten percentage points.  In the 
24:596:49940:27:28:71:526:543:144:Times:144:Times:other months the results are mixed.  There is evidence of smaller decreases in work, and small 
24:597:50035:28:27:71:460:515:144:Times:144:Times:and statistically insignificant changes in the proportion employed and on leave.   
24:598:50118:27:28:107:527:488:144:Times:144:Times:In the next column the sample is July 1989 through December 1992.  This picks up the 
24:599:50203:28:28:71:544:460:144:Times:144:Times:reform in Newfoundland and provides longer periods to establish the pre- and post-reform levels.  
24:600:50301:28:27:71:528:432:144:Times:144:Times:There are significant increases in leave in both the third and fourth months following birth and 
24:601:50398:27:28:71:503:405:144:Times:144:Times:offsetting decreases in work.  There is also a very modest decrease in work in the MOB.   
24:602:50488:28:27:107:538:377:144:Times:144:Times:To calibrate the results we use the averages of the dependent variables in all provinces in 
24:603:50580:27:28:71:542:350:144:Times:144:Times:the period just before the reform: July 1989-October 1990.  The 15.6 percentage point increase in 
24:604:50678:28:27:71:536:322:144:Times:144:Times:leave in the fourth month following birth (column 2) is off a pre-reform base of 21 percent.  The 
24:605:50776:27:28:71:531:295:144:Times:144:Times:12.6 percentage point decrease in the proportion at work is off a base of 30 percent.  These are  
24:606:50874:28:28:71:536:267:144:Times:144:Times:large effects, indicating a large increase in the proportion of women at home with their children. 
24:607:50972:28:27:107:536:239:144:Times:144:Times:In the third column we check for spurious inference.  Using data from July 1986 through 
24:608:51060:27:28:71:529:212:144:Times:144:Times:1989 we code the changes in the provincial mandates subtracting three years from each date of 
24:609:51154:28:27:71:490:184:144:Times:144:Times:enactment.  This falsification exercise should provide evidence of the sensitivity of the 
24:610:51244:27:28:71:489:157:144:Times:144:Times:identification strategy to secular trends.  The estimates are almost uniformly small and 
24:611:51333:28:28:71:541:129:144:Times:144:Times:statistically insignificant, the exception being some effect in the second month before the MOB.   
24:612:51432:28:27:107:536:101:144:Times:144:Times:In the remaining four columns are the results when we delete the federal sector, focus on 
24:613:51522:27:0:71:521:74:144:Times:144:Times:those who had a paid job within 12 months of the MOB, and when we add males or childless 
25:614:51613:0:27:72:532:708:144:Times:144:Times:females as an additional control.  The estimates confirm the conclusions from column 2.  Some 
25:615:51707:27:28:72:516:681:144:Times:144:Times:notable differences are a much larger effect in the third month following the MOB when we 
25:616:51797:28:27:72:529:653:144:Times:144:Times:focus on those with recent employment, and the statistical insignificance of some estimates for 
25:617:51893:27:28:72:537:626:144:Times:144:Times:employed and at work when we add males or childless females to the sample. The latter result is 
25:618:51989:28:28:72:430:598:144:Times:144:Times:likely a consequence of the 1990/92 recession, an issue we take up below. 
25:619:52063:28:27:108:520:570:144:Times:144:Times:In table 9 are the results for our measures of job continuity.  They indicate significant 
25:620:52153:27:28:72:512:543:144:Times:144:Times:increases in the proportion of mothers employed with their pre-birth employer in the fourth 
25:621:52245:28:27:72:522:515:144:Times:144:Times:month following birth.  The nine percentage point increase in column 2 can be compared to a 
25:622:52337:27:28:72:540:488:144:Times:144:Times:pre-reform base of 41 percent.  There is also a statistically significant, although modest, decrease 
25:623:52438:28:28:72:495:460:144:Times:144:Times:in the proportion leaving a job in the 12 months preceding the MOB for family reasons. 
25:624:52525:28:27:108:520:432:144:Times:144:Times:As explained in Section 2, the expected source of increased job continuity is females, 
25:625:52612:27:28:72:528:405:144:Times:144:Times:who previously would have quit their job and taken long periods off, now taking the mandated 
25:626:52705:28:27:72:536:377:144:Times:144:Times:leave and remaining with their employers.  If this were the only effect at work, we would expect 
25:627:52802:27:28:72:534:350:144:Times:144:Times:strong evidence of a decline in the proportion quitting their last job, a corresponding increase in 
25:628:52902:28:27:72:515:322:144:Times:144:Times:the proportion employed and on leave in the MOB and the change in overall employment at 
25:629:52990:27:28:72:533:295:144:Times:144:Times:MOB+4 to equal the change in employment at MOB+4 with tenure greater than 4 months.  The 
25:630:53079:28:28:72:534:267:144:Times:144:Times:estimates for the quit rate (table 9) and the proportion on leave in the MOB (table 8) are equally 
25:631:53178:28:27:72:520:239:144:Times:144:Times:modest, however, and the estimates in table 8 show that the change in overall employment at 
25:632:53270:27:28:72:540:212:144:Times:144:Times:MOB+4 is relatively small because the increase in the proportion on leave is almost offset by the 
25:633:53368:28:27:72:241:184:144:Times:144:Times:change in the proportion at work.   
25:634:53404:27:28:108:517:157:144:Times:144:Times:To be concrete, consider the estimated increase in job continuity at four months after 
25:635:53491:28:28:72:535:129:144:Times:144:Times:birth from column 2 of table 9:  9.11 percentage points.  This is repeated in the first row of table 
25:636:53592:28:27:72:534:101:144:Times:144:Times:10.  The increase in overall employment at four months from this specification is the sum (table 
25:637:53689:27:0:72:534:74:144:Times:144:Times:8) of a 15.6 point increase in the proportion employed and on leave and a 12.6 point decrease in 
26:638:53788:0:27:72:503:708:144:Times:144:Times:the proportion employed and at work.  The net effect is almost +3 percentage points.  We 
26:639:53877:27:28:72:498:681:144:Times:144:Times:provide a direct estimate in the second row of table 10.  Therefore, the change in overall 
26:640:53968:28:27:72:511:653:144:Times:144:Times:employment is not consistent with the increase in job continuity being solely more females 
26:641:54059:27:28:72:531:626:144:Times:144:Times:taking the mandated leave.  The missing detail is provided in the third through sixth rows.  The 
26:642:54156:28:28:72:523:598:144:Times:144:Times:increase in job continuity is associated with a substantial decrease in employment with tenure 
26:643:54251:28:27:72:542:570:144:Times:144:Times:less than five months.  The estimates indicate that a strong plurality of the shift in the distribution 
26:644:54355:27:28:72:427:543:144:Times:144:Times:of tenure is a reduction in employment with tenure equal to two months.   
26:645:54429:28:27:108:520:515:144:Times:144:Times:An explanation of the decrease in employment at tenures less than five months is that 
26:646:54515:27:28:72:541:488:144:Times:144:Times:females who previously quit their job and returned to work shortly after the MOB are now taking 
26:647:54611:28:28:72:521:460:144:Times:144:Times:the longer leave provided by mandate.  Therefore, the introduction of parental leave caused a 
26:648:54705:28:27:72:539:432:144:Times:144:Times:shift of employment from tenures under five months to longer tenures.  This might occur if these 
26:649:54802:27:28:72:493:405:144:Times:144:Times:mothers preferred a gradual return to the labor market after birth to immediate full time 
26:650:54892:28:27:71:534:377:144:Times:144:Times:employment, but could not negotiate this arrangement with their employer.  The introduction of 
26:651:54986:27:28:71:489:350:144:Times:144:Times:parental leave allows them to put off full time employment to a more acceptable time.  
26:652:55073:28:27:71:525:322:144:Times:144:Times:Consistent with this story, almost two-thirds of the 6.1 point decline in employment at tenures 
26:653:55169:27:28:71:512:295:144:Times:144:Times:less than five months is in part time work.  The estimated change in part time work at these 
26:654:55262:28:28:71:521:267:144:Times:144:Times:tenures is -0.03921 with a standard error of 0.0128. This would explain why we do not find a 
26:655:55355:28:27:71:247:239:144:Times:144:Times:large impact on the job leaving rate. 
26:656:55392:27:28:108:530:212:144:Times:144:Times:In table 11 we present the results using the TSCS sample. Here we code the mandate in 
26:657:55478:28:27:72:523:184:144:Times:144:Times:the current month or a six month lag.  There is consistent evidence of a four to six percentage 
26:658:55574:27:28:72:535:157:144:Times:144:Times:point increase in the proportion employed and on leave.  There is also fairly consistent evidence 
26:659:55672:28:28:72:526:129:144:Times:144:Times:of a corresponding decline in the proportion employed and at work.  Therefore, if the mandate 
26:660:55766:28:27:72:511:101:144:Times:144:Times:extension led some women to spend less time at home, this effect is more than offset at the 
26:661:55858:27:0:72:527:74:144:Times:144:Times:average by women who increased their time at home.  The exception to this conclusion occurs 
27:662:55952:0:27:72:538:708:144:Times:144:Times:when we add males or childless females as a control group.  The source of this discrepancy, also 
27:663:56049:27:28:72:520:681:144:Times:144:Times:seen in the estimates for MOB+3 in table 8, is seen in figure 6.  The 1990-92 recession had a 
27:664:56143:28:27:72:519:653:144:Times:144:Times:differential impact on the overall employment of these different groups.  Males and childless 
27:665:56237:27:28:72:513:626:144:Times:144:Times:females experienced declines in both work and in overall employment (these categories are 
27:666:56327:28:28:72:521:598:144:Times:144:Times:effectively the same for these two groups).  While the mothers experienced a decline in work 
27:667:56420:28:27:72:527:570:144:Times:144:Times:(figure 1), their overall employment held steady.    Therefore, while the reductions in work for 
27:668:56517:27:28:72:510:543:144:Times:144:Times:males or childless females net out the reduction in work for mothers in these estimates, the 
27:669:56610:28:27:72:437:515:144:Times:144:Times:former is likely a recession effect while the latter is likely a mandate effect. 
27:670:56691:27:28:108:543:488:144:Times:144:Times:As a further check on inference we have re-estimated our models for both the panel-based 
27:671:56780:28:28:72:502:460:144:Times:144:Times:and TSCS samples using another identification strategy.  We add a polynomial in time to 
27:672:56868:28:27:72:536:432:144:Times:144:Times:equation (2) and expand the sample to 1988-1994.  This is like a regression discontinuity design 
27:673:56965:27:28:72:526:405:144:Times:144:Times:in which all effects of time, except the mandate reforms, are assumed to be smooth functions.  
27:674:57060:28:27:72:532:377:144:Times:144:Times:For the panel-based data these estimated effects are very similar for the fourth month following 
27:675:57157:27:28:72:542:350:144:Times:144:Times:the MOB, but generally smaller for other months.  For the TSCS data the results indicate a two to 
27:676:57255:28:27:72:542:322:144:Times:144:Times:three percentage point increase in the proportion on leave, and a modestly smaller decrease in the 
27:677:57354:27:28:72:531:295:144:Times:144:Times:proportion at work.  In either case the results are very robust to specification of the time effects 
27:678:57455:28:28:72:498:267:144:Times:144:Times:as linear, a quadratic or a cubic.  These results are available from the authors on request. 
27:679:57548:28:27:72:444:239:144:Times:144:Times:An Extension of Mandated Leave: the 2000 Extension of Parental Leave 
27:680:57617:27:28:108:537:212:144:Times:144:Times: As indicated in table 3, the extension of parental leave starting in 2000 raised the amount 
27:681:57709:28:27:72:535:184:144:Times:144:Times:of leave available to one year in all provinces except Quebec, where leave had been extended to 
27:682:57805:27:28:72:505:157:144:Times:144:Times:70 weeks in 1997.  The motivation for our inference is clear in figure 1.  In 2001 we see a 
27:683:57897:28:28:72:530:129:144:Times:144:Times:dramatic increase in the proportion of mothers with a child aged less who are employed and on 
27:684:57991:28:27:72:433:101:144:Times:144:Times:leave, and an offsetting decrease in the proportion employed and at work.   
27:685:58067:27:0:108:526:74:144:Times:144:Times:The extension of leave from roughly six to twelve months in most provinces is outside 
28:686:58155:0:27:72:513:708:144:Times:144:Times:the span of observation of our panel-based data, which only extend to four months after the 
28:687:58247:27:28:72:533:681:144:Times:144:Times:MOB.  We therefore focus on our TSCS sample.  Estimates of the proportion of mothers with a 
28:688:58339:28:27:72:510:653:144:Times:144:Times:child aged less than one on leave or at work are presented in table 12.    The progression of 
28:689:58433:27:28:71:509:626:144:Times:144:Times:samples and specifications is the same as in table 11.  In the first panel there is very strong 
28:690:58529:28:28:71:527:598:144:Times:144:Times:evidence of roughly a 9 percentage point increase in the proportion on leave and a 10-11 point 
28:691:58624:28:27:71:542:570:144:Times:144:Times:decrease in the proportion at work.  The results are uniformly larger in the second panel when we 
28:692:58722:27:28:71:536:543:144:Times:144:Times:lag the coding of the mandate by 9 months.  The estimated increase in leave is 12-13 percentage 
28:693:58818:28:27:71:506:515:144:Times:144:Times:points and the estimated decrease in work is 12-14 points.  The difference across panels is 
28:694:58910:27:28:71:526:488:144:Times:144:Times:expected, as figure 1 shows that the effect of the mandate reform grows over time.  Given that 
28:695:59005:28:28:71:539:460:144:Times:144:Times:we sample mothers who had a birth in the previous 12 months, it is not until 2002 data that all of 
28:696:59104:28:27:71:327:432:144:Times:144:Times:this group would be eligible to take the longer leave. 
28:697:59159:27:28:107:520:405:144:Times:144:Times:To calibrate these results we use the average of the dependent variables between July 
28:698:59245:28:27:71:532:377:144:Times:144:Times:1999 and November 2000 in all provinces save Quebec.26  The 12-13 percentage point increase 
28:699:59337:27:28:71:531:350:144:Times:144:Times:in leave is off a pre-reform base of 31 percent.  The 12-14 percentage point decrease in work is 
28:700:59434:28:27:71:533:322:144:Times:144:Times:off the same base.  These are large changes.  As figure 1 makes clear, by 2003 the proportion at 
28:701:59531:27:28:71:541:295:144:Times:144:Times:work was below its level in 1976.  Over the same period overall employment more than doubled. 
28:702:59625:28:28:107:525:267:144:Times:144:Times: The estimates from the other columns support this inference and vary in now expected 
28:703:59710:28:27:71:540:239:144:Times:144:Times:ways (e.g., larger estimates for those with recent work).  Also the estimates from the falsification 
28:704:59811:27:28:71:527:212:144:Times:144:Times:exercise are small and statistically insignificant. We have again re-estimated the model adding 
28:705:59907:28:27:71:521:184:144:Times:144:Times:polynomials in time and expanding the sample (to July 1997 through 2002).  The results (not 
28:706:59999:27:72:71:501:157:144:Times:144:Times:shown) support the inference from table 12, although the estimated effect of the mandate 
28:707:60088:72:7:216:219:85:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
28:708:60136:7:0:72:388:78:42:Times:100:Times:26 We exclude Quebec because was extended here to 70 weeks in March 1997. 
29:709:60212:0:27:72:370:708:144:Times:64:Times:extension is somewhat smaller when we add a cubic in time.27
29:710:60272:27:28:108:531:681:144:Times:144:Times: Since the extension is to one year of leave and the TSCS sample is mothers with a child 
29:711:60359:28:27:72:532:653:144:Times:144:Times:aged less than one, these results cannot establish whether time spent at home post birth went up 
29:712:60456:27:28:72:506:626:144:Times:144:Times:on average.  Mothers who quit their jobs and stayed at home more than one year may post 
29:713:60544:28:28:72:521:598:144:Times:144:Times:extension take a shorter leave.  We have re-estimated our models, however, for the sample of 
29:714:60637:28:27:72:536:570:144:Times:144:Times:women whose youngest child is aged one and find no effect of the extension on the labor supply 
29:715:60732:27:28:72:520:543:144:Times:144:Times:of this group.28  Therefore, it appears the number of mothers shortening their time at home is 
29:716:60827:28:27:71:137:515:144:Times:144:Times:negligible.     
29:717:60843:27:28:107:537:488:144:Times:144:Times: The estimates for both the 1990 and the 2000 mandate expansions reveal large effects on 
29:718:60931:28:28:71:521:460:144:Times:144:Times:leave-taking, time at home (the complement of employed at work) and job continuity.  These 
29:719:61022:28:27:71:536:432:144:Times:144:Times:results contrast with the estimates for mandates introductions in the 1970s and 1980s.  It may be 
29:720:61120:27:28:71:538:405:144:Times:144:Times:that private arrangements and the physical demands of birth render modest mandates redundant.  
29:721:61215:28:27:71:495:377:144:Times:144:Times:Longer mandates exceed private arrangements and thus have a large effect on behavior. 
29:722:61301:27:28:107:535:350:144:Times:144:Times: These conclusions have implications for researchers investigating the effect of leaves on 
29:723:61391:28:27:71:530:322:144:Times:144:Times:health and child development.  Short leaves, such as those mandated by the FMLA in the U.S., 
29:724:61484:27:28:71:536:295:144:Times:144:Times:may have no effect on time spent at home.  If there is no effect on labor supply, there is no basis 
29:725:61584:28:28:72:215:267:144:Times:144:Times:for the second-stage benefits.

29:727:61644:27:28:108:522:212:144:Times:144:Times:Maternity leave can have a positive impact on infant welfare.  While the benefits may 
29:728:61730:28:27:72:511:184:144:Times:144:Times:take a variety of forms—increased periods of breastfeeding, better cognitive and emotional 
29:729:61821:27:37:72:532:157:144:Times:144:Times:development—previous studies have focused on infant mortality rates and the incidence of low

29:732:62083:16:11:72:531:96:100:Times:100:Times:expected.  Figure 1 shows that the mandate reform does not cause a sharp discontinuity because there is a lag until 
29:733:62199:11:7:72:321:85:100:Times:100:Times:all of the sampled population is subject to the new provisions. 
29:734:62263:7:0:72:402:78:42:Times:100:Times:28 The estimates are very small, statistically insignificant and available on request. 
30:735:62352:0:27:72:531:708:144:Times:144:Times:birth weight.  The argument is that mothers provide better supervision of newborns, decreasing 
30:736:62447:27:28:72:514:681:144:Times:144:Times:accidents and better monitoring  any deterioration in infant health.  We focus on these same 
30:737:62540:28:27:72:359:653:144:Times:144:Times:measures of infant health to provide a link to this literature. 
30:738:62604:27:28:108:525:626:144:Times:144:Times:In table 13 we present estimates of equation (3) for the period 1961-2002.  This period 
30:739:62692:28:28:72:529:598:144:Times:144:Times:spans the mandate reforms examined in our analysis of labor supply, and adds the period 1961-
30:740:62785:28:27:72:495:570:144:Times:144:Times:1975 when five provinces introduced leave mandates.  In the first column there is fairly 
30:741:62874:27:28:72:528:543:144:Times:144:Times:consistent evidence that WKSLV has an effect on the measures of mortality.  For each measure 
30:742:62967:28:27:72:532:515:144:Times:144:Times:the estimate is negative—as expected—and statistically significant.  In the next column we add 
30:743:63062:27:28:72:524:488:144:Times:144:Times:province-specific linear trends to the specification.  Infant mortality rates have been declining 
30:744:63160:28:28:72:514:460:144:Times:144:Times:over the period in all provinces for a variety of reasons, and some of these may be province-
30:745:63253:28:27:72:516:432:144:Times:144:Times:specific.  The effect on inference is dramatic.  The estimates of WKSLV are uniformly much 
30:746:63344:27:28:72:525:405:144:Times:144:Times:smaller, and now positive and statistically insignificant.  In the third column we add quadratic 
30:747:63441:28:27:72:520:377:144:Times:144:Times:provincial trends that may be more appropriate given the length of the sample period.  While 
30:748:63534:27:28:72:533:350:144:Times:144:Times:some estimates turn negative again, they are very small and statistically insignificant.  We have 
30:749:63632:28:27:72:525:322:144:Times:144:Times:also experimented with a quadratic specification of the WKSLV variable to allow the effect on 
30:750:63726:27:28:72:514:295:144:Times:144:Times:infant health to vary across different durations.29 The original inference remains: there is no 
30:751:63822:28:28:71:400:267:144:Times:144:Times:evidence that leave mandates affect these measures of infant health. 
30:752:63891:28:27:107:522:239:144:Times:144:Times:The 1961-2001 sample period pools together different types of mandate reform.  This 
30:753:63975:27:28:71:537:212:144:Times:144:Times:may be inappropriate because our labor supply analysis indicates that different types of mandate 
30:754:64072:28:27:71:519:184:144:Times:144:Times:extensions had different effects.  In particular, we find little evidence that the introduction of 
30:755:64171:27:37:71:511:157:144:Times:144:Times:mandates had an effect on the proportion of mothers employed and at work.   To refine our

30:757:64309:8:16:72:525:112:42:Times:100:Times:29 Our experiments focus on neonatal and post-neonatal mortality, periods that correspond to the mandates under 
30:758:64421:16:11:72:541:96:100:Times:100:Times:study.  While the parameters of the quadratic in WKSLV are sometimes jointly significant, the inference is not robust 
30:759:64538:11:12:72:506:85:100:Times:100:Times:to the changes in the specification of the province-specific trends.  Also, the estimates often imply effects of 
30:760:64651:12:0:72:168:73:100:Times:100:Times:implausible magnitude. 
31:761:64676:0:27:72:540:708:144:Times:144:Times:analysis, we focus on the parental leave reforms of 1990 and 2000 that did have an impact on the 
31:762:64773:27:28:72:511:681:144:Times:144:Times:proportion of mothers at home with their newborns.  We expect these reforms to have their 
31:763:64863:28:27:72:287:653:144:Times:144:Times:primary effects in the post-neonatal period.   
31:764:64910:27:28:108:535:626:144:Times:144:Times:Figures 7 and 8 provide an overview.  We again compare Quebec and Ontario.  Near the 
31:765:64995:28:28:72:540:598:144:Times:144:Times:end of 1990, each province introduced parental leave although the Quebec mandate was far more 
31:766:65089:28:27:72:531:570:144:Times:144:Times:generous.  In 2000, Ontario extended parental leave.  Quebec had already extended its mandate 
31:767:65183:27:28:72:504:543:144:Times:144:Times:in 1997.  In neither figure is there evidence of an effect on these reforms on post neonatal 
31:768:65276:28:27:72:508:515:144:Times:144:Times:mortality.  There is no obvious trend break in 1991, nor evidence of a Quebec/Ontario gap 
31:769:65366:27:28:72:265:488:144:Times:144:Times:emerging in 1997 or closing after 2000. 
31:770:65406:28:28:108:528:460:144:Times:144:Times:Our mortality data are annual, so we cannot exploit intra-year differences in enactment 
31:771:65494:28:27:72:513:432:144:Times:144:Times:across provinces in our regression analysis.  We are also mindful that there are few obvious 
31:772:65587:27:28:72:526:405:144:Times:144:Times:additional controls for jurisdictional secular trends.  Our strategy is to estimate a variant of (3) 
31:773:65688:28:27:72:539:377:144:Times:144:Times:replacing the year effects with smooth functions of time, and replacing WKSLV with the variable 
31:774:65784:27:28:72:529:350:144:Times:144:Times:POST from equation (2). We code POST for each province on an annual basis.  It captures any 
31:775:65876:28:27:71:510:322:144:Times:144:Times:change in the within province time series variation of infant health with the introduction of 
31:776:65970:27:28:71:537:295:144:Times:144:Times:parental leave, in addition to what is captured by the time effects.  We use data for 1988 through 
31:777:66069:28:28:71:258:267:144:Times:144:Times:1993 and 1998-2002 for this analysis.  
31:778:66108:28:27:107:531:239:144:Times:144:Times:In the first panel of table 14 are the results for the 1990 reform.  The estimates of POST 
31:779:66198:27:28:71:523:212:144:Times:144:Times:are all negative and all insignificant. Taken at face value some of the results for post neonatal 
31:780:66296:28:27:71:529:184:144:Times:144:Times:mortality imply fairly large effect, as the rate in the late 1980 was just above 2 deaths per 1000 
31:781:66395:27:28:71:539:157:144:Times:144:Times:births.  In the next panel we present the results of a falsification exercise, coding the introduction 
31:782:66498:28:28:71:523:129:144:Times:144:Times:of parental leave in each province as if it occurred 3 years earlier and using data from 1985 to 
31:783:66595:28:27:71:526:101:144:Times:144:Times:1990.  While marginally larger, many of the estimates are again negative and insignificant.  In 
31:784:66691:27:0:71:386:74:144:Times:144:Times:fact there is not much to distinguish the results in the two panels. 
32:785:66762:0:27:108:524:708:144:Times:144:Times:We repeat the analysis in the third and fourth panels for the 2000 reform.  The story is 
32:786:66851:27:28:71:533:681:144:Times:144:Times:very similar, although now most estimates are positive and insignificant.  Again there is little to 
32:787:66951:28:27:71:521:653:144:Times:64:Times:distinguish the falsification exercise results from the estimates correctly coding the reforms.30
32:788:67048:27:28:108:541:626:144:Times:144:Times:We have re-estimated our equation adding the mortality rate for 1-4 year olds as a control 
32:789:67139:28:28:71:503:598:144:Times:144:Times:for province specific trends.  Focusing on post neonatal mortality, for the 1990 reform all 
32:790:67231:28:27:71:521:570:144:Times:144:Times:estimates of the interaction of POST and an infant dummy variable are small and statistically 
32:791:67324:27:28:71:526:543:144:Times:144:Times:insignificant.  For the 2000 reform the interaction is negative and insignificant, and we cannot 
32:792:67421:28:27:71:520:515:144:Times:144:Times:reject the hypothesis that the total effect for infants (the sum of the estimate of POST and the 
32:793:67517:27:28:71:208:488:144:Times:144:Times:interaction) is equal to zero. 
32:794:67548:28:28:107:525:460:144:Times:144:Times:We conclude that there is little evidence in these data that the increase in time at home 
32:795:67638:28:27:71:532:432:144:Times:144:Times:induced by the mandate reforms affected infant mortality.  We cannot distinguish the estimated 
32:796:67733:27:28:71:542:405:144:Times:144:Times:effects from regular secular variation in the data.  One could argue that our identification strategy 
32:797:67835:28:27:71:512:377:144:Times:144:Times:lacks power, but the evidence in figures 7 and 8 indicates that any effects of the reforms on 
32:798:67929:27:28:71:198:350:144:Times:144:Times:mortality are very subtle.  
32:799:67957:28:27:71:148:322:144:Times:144:Times:9. Conclusions 
32:800:67972:27:28:107:534:295:144:Times:144:Times:We investigate the relationship between mandated job-protected maternity leave and the 
32:801:68059:28:28:71:493:267:144:Times:144:Times:labor force behavior of mothers with newborns.  Most significantly, our results provide 
32:802:68147:28:27:71:531:239:144:Times:144:Times:convincing evidence of the first stage labor market relationships that must lie behind any effect 
32:803:68245:27:28:71:525:212:144:Times:144:Times:of leaves on infants’ or mothers’ welfare.  The analysis reveals that mandates can increase the 
32:804:68341:28:27:71:530:184:144:Times:144:Times:time mothers spend at home with their infants and increase job continuity over the birth event.  
32:805:68438:27:28:71:508:157:144:Times:144:Times:Importantly, the former result is not found for the introduction of modest mandates (17-18 
32:806:68529:28:21:71:534:129:144:Times:144:Times:weeks) that most likely duplicate existing private arrangements.  Instead it is in the extension of 
32:807:68628:21:7:216:219:108:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
32:808:68676:7:16:72:532:101:42:Times:100:Times:30 Here the falsification exercise involves lagging the reform dates by 2 years to ensure the sample period does not 
32:809:68793:16:12:72:539:85:100:Times:100:Times:contain the mandate changes in some provinces which occurred in the mid 1990s.  As coded, the falsification period 
32:810:68908:12:0:72:518:73:100:Times:100:Times:does overlap a 1997 mandate change in Quebec, but the results are insensitive to the omission of this province. 
33:811:69022:0:27:72:419:708:144:Times:144:Times:leaves to longer durations that the connection to labor supply is found.   
33:812:69097:27:28:108:504:681:144:Times:144:Times:These findings have important implications for previous research.  First, they may 
33:813:69180:28:27:72:525:653:144:Times:144:Times:explain the lack of consistent evidence of an impact of short mandates, such as the FMLA, on 
33:814:69273:27:28:72:540:626:144:Times:144:Times:labor supply.  Second, they provide some validation for the benefits ascribed to the longer leaves 
33:815:69372:28:28:72:229:598:144:Times:144:Times:available in European countries. 
33:816:69405:28:27:108:542:570:144:Times:144:Times:There are also implications for future research.  There is growing recognition that the first 
33:817:69499:27:28:72:509:543:144:Times:144:Times:years are crucial to child development (e.g., Carnegie Task Force on Meeting the Needs of 
33:818:69589:28:27:72:541:515:144:Times:144:Times:Young Children 1994), and in turn that childhood development is a strong predictor of success in 
33:819:69686:27:28:72:534:488:144:Times:144:Times:adulthood (e.g., Heckman 1999).  Maternity leave is a prominent government policy directed to 
33:820:69780:28:28:72:538:460:144:Times:144:Times:the welfare of infants.  There is also a connection to the large literature on maternal employment 
33:821:69879:28:27:72:485:432:144:Times:144:Times:and child development.  Increases in female employment over the last 100 years have 
33:822:69963:27:28:72:528:405:144:Times:144:Times:precipitated dramatic changes in the way children are brought up. A substantial and increasing 
33:823:70058:28:365:71:490:377:144:Times:144:Times:proportion of mothers work.  Researchers have investigated many effects of this social 
33:824:0:365:0:0:144:12:71:350:71:350:0
33:825:70145:0:28:118:502:350:144:Times:144:Times:ation on children’s cognitive, emotional and physical development.31  A central 
33:826:70225:28:27:71:537:322:144:Times:144:Times:challenge in this literature is finding an instrument for maternal employment.32  Our findings for 
33:827:70324:27:28:71:534:295:144:Times:144:Times:suggest that the maternity leave mandates may serve as an instrument for maternal employment 
33:828:70417:28:28:71:427:267:144:Times:144:Times:in the first year, which will assist in answering these important questions. 
33:829:70494:28:27:71:541:239:144:Times:144:Times:An outstanding issue is how the behavioral effect of leaves varies with income replacement.  The 
33:830:70591:27:28:71:538:212:144:Times:144:Times:compensation of leaves in Canada is modest to European standards, but  exceeds the norm in the 
33:831:70686:28:27:71:539:184:144:Times:144:Times:U.S.  If income replacement is important, our estimates likely overestimate the effect of a simple 
33:832:70785:27:28:71:523:157:144:Times:144:Times:extension of the FMLA.  That said, income replacement is gaining a constituency in the U.S.

33:836:71059:12:16:72:527:89:42:Times:100:Times:32 Recent advances involve richer controls for observable differences between working and non working mothers 
33:837:71169:16:0:72:421:73:100:Times:100:Times:(Baum 2002, Ruhm 2001), but typically there is no account of unobserved differences. 
34:838:71256:0:27:72:540:708:144:Times:144:Times:compensate maternity leaves through their Unemployment Insurance funds. While no states took 
34:839:71349:27:28:72:529:681:144:Times:144:Times:advantage of this policy, the spirit of this compensation scheme is very similar to the Canadian 
34:840:71446:28:27:72:501:653:144:Times:144:Times:system.  California’s Paid Family Leave Insurance Program, which supplements benefits 
34:841:71532:27:28:72:537:626:144:Times:144:Times:available under State Disability Insurance, provides six weeks of income replacement for family 
34:842:71628:28:28:72:516:598:144:Times:144:Times:leaves at a replacement ratio similar to Canada’s.33  Four other states provide benefits under 
34:843:71723:28:27:71:530:570:144:Times:144:Times:disability insurance plans.  Our estimates have relevance for this growing number of states that 
34:844:71820:27:435:71:282:543:144:Times:144:Times:offer income replacement for family leaves.

36:894:73500:0:27:99:526:708:144:Times:144:Times:Some evidence is provided in table A-1.  We report the distribution of current job tenure 
36:895:73590:27:28:72:540:681:144:Times:144:Times:for mothers employed in the indicated month following the MOB for our 1976-1990 panel-based 
36:896:73682:28:27:72:522:653:144:Times:144:Times:sample.  For example, 4.2 percent of mothers working in the third month following the MOB 
36:897:73772:27:28:72:261:626:144:Times:144:Times:report current job tenure of one month. 
36:898:73812:28:28:99:524:598:144:Times:144:Times:There are at least two striking results here.  First, the overwhelming majority of mothers 
36:899:73903:28:27:72:532:570:144:Times:144:Times:working in the third or fourth month following birth report a job tenure indicating they are with 
36:900:74001:27:28:72:537:543:144:Times:144:Times:their pre-birth employer.  Second, a substantial fraction of those who were not employed in their 
36:901:74099:28:27:72:523:515:144:Times:144:Times:MOB also report a job tenure that indicates they are at their pre-birth employer: 51 percent of 
36:902:74195:27:28:72:533:488:144:Times:144:Times:those working in the third month following birth and 41 percent of those working in the fourth.  
36:903:74292:28:28:72:524:460:144:Times:144:Times:This suggests that these individuals interpret the tenure question to ask when they first started 
36:904:74390:28:27:72:526:432:144:Times:144:Times:work with their current employer, not when the current employment period with the employer
