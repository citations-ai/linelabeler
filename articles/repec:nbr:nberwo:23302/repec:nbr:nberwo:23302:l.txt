2:40:2597:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:?:We  propose  a  dynamic  theory  of  financial  intermediaries  that  are  better  able  to  collateralize 
2:41:2704:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:?:claims than households, that is, have a collateralization advantage. Intermediaries require capital 
2:42:2803:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:?:as  they  can borrow  against  their  loans  only  to  the  extent  that  households  themselves  can 
2:43:2904:14:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:?:collateralize  the  assets backing  these  loans.  The  net  worth  of  financial  intermediaries  and  the 
2:44:3011:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:?:corporate  sector  are  both  state variables  affecting  the  spread  between  intermediated  and  direct

2:49:3543:14:14:71:546:462:12:Times:12:Times:?:credit  crunch  itself  affects  the  severity  and  persistence  of  downturns.  The  model captures  the

3:65:3924:0:29:80:216:699:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:1    Introduction
3:66:3941:29:17:80:532:670:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The capitalization of financial intermediaries is arguably critical for economic fluctuations
3:67:4034:17:18:80:532:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and growth.  We provide a dynamic theory of financial intermediaries that have a collater-
3:68:4124:18:17:80:532:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:alization advantage, that is, are better able to collateralize claims than households.  Firms
3:69:4217:17:17:80:532:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:need to collateralize promises to pay with tangible assets and can raise collateralized fi-
3:70:4308:17:18:80:532:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nancing from both intermediaries and households;  firms require net worth as collateral
3:71:4395:18:17:80:532:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:constraints limit financing.  Financial intermediaries require net worth as their ability to
3:72:4487:17:17:80:532:566:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:refinance their collateralized loans from households is in turn limited, as they, too, need
3:73:4578:17:18:80:532:549:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to collateralize their promises.  Importantly,  the net worth of both financial intermedi-
3:74:4668:18:17:80:532:531:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:aries and firms hence plays a role in our model, in contrast to most previous work, and
3:75:4755:17:17:80:532:514:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:these two state variables jointly determine the dynamics of economic activity, investment,
3:76:4845:17:18:80:532:497:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:financing, and loan spreads.  A key feature of our model is that the accumulation of the
3:77:4933:18:17:80:532:479:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:net  worth  of  intermediaries  is  slow  relative  to  that  of  the  corporate  sector.   The  slow-
3:78:5035:17:17:80:532:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:moving nature of intermediary capital results in economic dynamics that are consistent
3:79:5121:17:18:80:532:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with key stylized facts about macroeconomic downturns associated with a credit crunch,
3:80:5207:18:17:80:532:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:namely, their severity, their protractedness, and the fact that the severity of the credit
3:81:5297:17:18:80:532:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:crunch itself affects the severity and persistence of downturns.  Most uniquely, the model
3:82:5387:18:17:80:420:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:captures the tentative and halting nature of recoveries from crises.
3:83:5455:17:17:98:533:375:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the model firms can borrow from both intermediaries and households, and all fi-
3:84:5537:17:18:80:532:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nancing needs to be collateralized.  Firm financing is subject to two types of collateral
3:85:5626:18:17:80:532:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:constraints, one for loans from households and one for loans from intermediaries.  Since
3:86:5714:17:17:80:532:323:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intermediaries are better able to enforce collateralized claims, they can lend more than
3:87:5802:17:18:80:532:306:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:households,  but  the  additional  amount  that  they  can  lend  has  to  be  financed  out  of
3:88:5898:18:17:80:532:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their own net worth, giving a role to financial intermediary capital.  We show that these
3:89:5987:17:17:80:532:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:collateral constraints can be derived from an economy with limited enforcement that con-
3:90:6075:17:18:80:532:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:strains firms’ and intermediaries’ ability to make credible promises.  Intermediaries, but
3:91:6165:18:17:80:532:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not households, participate in markets at all times which affords intermediaries with an
3:92:6253:17:17:80:532:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:advantage in enforcing claims.  This economy with limited enforcement without exclusion
3:93:6340:17:18:80:530:202:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:and with limited participation is equivalent to our economy with collateral constraints.1
3:94:6429:18:17:98:533:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Intermediaries  are  essential  in  our  economy  in  the  sense  that  allocations  can  be
3:95:6521:17:17:80:532:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:achieved  with  financial  intermediaries,  which  cannot  be  achieved  otherwise.   Since  in-
3:96:6617:17:18:80:532:150:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:termediary net worth is limited, intermediated finance commands a positive spread.  In a
3:97:6705:18:17:80:532:132:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:deterministic steady state, the equilibrium capitalization of both the representative firm
3:98:6795:17:18:93:532:115:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:1We  model  limited  enforcement  `a  la  Kehoe  and  Levine  (1993)  but  without  exclusion,  as  in  Chien
3:99:6904:18:15:80:532:97:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:and Lustig (2010) and Rampini and Viswanathan (2010, 2013), and extend their results by introducing
3:100:7003:15:0:80:205:82:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:limited participation as well.
4:101:7034:0:17:80:532:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and intermediary are positive.  Steady state firm net worth is determined by the fraction
4:102:7123:17:18:80:532:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of tangible assets that firms cannot pledge to intermediaries or households and thus have
4:103:7212:18:17:80:532:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to finance internally.  Steady state intermediary net worth is determined by the fraction
4:104:7301:17:17:80:532:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of investment that intermediaries have to finance due to their collateralization advantage,
4:105:7392:17:18:80:532:630:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that is, by the difference in the ability to enforce collateralized claims between interme-
4:106:7483:18:17:80:532:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:diaries and households.  As an aside, the determinants of the capital structure for firms
4:107:7572:17:17:80:335:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and intermediaries are thus distinct in our model.
4:108:7622:17:18:98:533:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The equilibrium spread on intermediated finance is determined by the two state vari-
4:109:7706:18:17:80:532:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ables, firm and intermediary net worth, jointly.  Intermediary net worth increases inter-
4:110:7795:17:17:80:532:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mediated  loan  supply  and  hence  reduces  spreads  all  else  equal.   In  contrast,  firm  net
4:111:7893:17:18:80:532:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:worth has two opposing effects on intermediated loan demand:  on the one hand, firm net
4:112:7980:18:17:80:532:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:worth increases investment and lowers the levered marginal product of capital reducing
4:113:8066:17:17:80:532:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms’ willingness to pay, lowering spreads; on the other hand, firm net worth, by increas-
4:114:8157:17:18:80:532:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ing investment, increases firms’ collateralizable assets, which in turn raises loan demand,
4:115:8248:18:17:80:532:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:raising spreads.  Hence, spreads can be high or low when firm net worth is low as they
4:116:8334:17:17:80:532:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:depend on the relative capitalization of firms and intermediaries.  When intermediary net
4:117:8423:17:18:80:532:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:worth is relatively scarce, the collateral constraint on intermediated finance is slack and
4:118:8514:18:17:80:532:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firm net worth reduces spreads.  When firm net worth is relatively scarce instead, the col-
4:119:8605:17:17:80:532:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lateral constraint on intermediated finance binds and firm net worth increases spreads as
4:120:8694:17:18:80:532:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:it increases firms’ ability to pledge and hence loan demand.  Notably, equilibrium spreads
4:121:8784:18:17:80:532:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:can be low in the model even when firms are poorly capitalized.  This interaction of loan

4:123:8960:17:18:80:532:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spreads,  with  negative  shocks  to  net  worth  potentially  leading  to  spreads  dropping  on
4:124:9057:18:17:80:464:300:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:impact, then spiking, and finally falling as the economy gradually recovers.
4:125:9133:17:17:98:533:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our model allows the analysis of the dynamics of the capitalization of the corporate
4:126:9217:17:18:80:532:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and intermediary sector.  The two state variables, net worth of firms and intermediaries,
4:127:9306:18:17:80:532:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:jointly determine the dynamic supply and demand for intermediated loans and the equi-
4:128:9391:17:17:80:532:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:librium interest rate.  A key feature of the equilibrium dynamics is that intermediary net
4:129:9481:17:18:80:532:214:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:worth accumulation is slow relative to corporate net worth accumulation.  This feature is
4:130:9570:18:17:80:532:196:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reflected in several aspects of the dynamics of the model.  First, the recovery from a credit
4:131:9663:17:17:80:532:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:crunch, that is, a drop in intermediary net worth, is relatively slow making such episodes
4:132:9753:17:18:80:532:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:protracted. Second, the recovery from a downturn associated with a credit crunch, that is,
4:133:9843:18:17:80:532:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a drop in corporate and intermediary net worth, can stall, after an initial relatively swift
4:134:9935:17:17:80:532:127:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:recovery,  when firm net worth has partially recovered while intermediaries have yet to
4:135:10022:17:18:80:532:110:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:recover.  Third, the recovery from a downturn associated with a more severe credit crunch
4:136:10111:18:0:80:532:92:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is especially slow and halting, with output depressed and spreads elevated for a prolonged
5:137:10202:0:17:80:532:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:period of time.  The reason why intermediaries accumulate net worth more slowly in the
5:138:10288:17:18:80:532:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model is that their net worth grows at the intermediated interest rate, which is at most
5:139:10376:18:17:80:532:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the marginal levered product of capital, and may be lower than that when the collateral
5:140:10463:17:17:80:532:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:constraint on intermediated finance binds.  In contrast, firms accumulate net worth at the
5:141:10553:17:18:80:532:630:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:average levered product of capital, which in turn exceeds the marginal levered product of
5:142:10642:18:17:80:118:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:capital.
5:143:10650:17:17:98:533:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In a downturn without a credit crunch, that is, a drop in corporate net worth alone,
5:144:10734:17:18:80:532:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:corporate investment drops; as a consequence of the collateral constraints on intermedi-
5:145:10822:18:17:80:532:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ated finance, corporate loan demand for intermediated loans drops as well, resulting in a
5:146:10911:17:17:80:532:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:drop in the intermediated interest rate.  Indeed, intermediaries find themselves temporar-
5:147:11001:17:18:80:532:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ily  relatively  well  capitalized  and  facing  reduced  loan  demand  respond  in  two  possible
5:148:11099:18:17:80:532:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ways.  On the one hand, intermediaries may lend some funds to households at an inter-
5:149:11184:17:17:80:532:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:est rate lower than that implied by their own rate of time preference, and in this sense
5:150:11272:17:18:80:532:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intermediaries  may  hold  “cash,”  to  conserve  net  worth  in  order  to  meet  higher  future
5:151:11369:18:17:80:532:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:corporate loan demand.  Corporate loan demand is expected to recover relatively quickly
5:152:11456:17:17:80:532:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as  firms  reaccumulate  net  worth.   On  the  other  hand,  if  corporate  loan  demand  is  ex-
5:153:11554:17:18:80:532:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pected to remain depressed for an extended period of time, intermediaries may conserve
5:154:11640:18:17:80:532:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:only part of their net worth and pay out some net worth as an initial dividend.  As firms
5:155:11729:17:17:80:532:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reaccumulate  net  worth,  corporate  loan  demand  rises,  and  intermediary  net  worth  be-
5:156:11823:17:18:80:532:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:comes scarce.  Initially, the intermediated interest rate rises as the collateral constraint
5:157:11915:18:17:80:532:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:still binds,  limiting loan demand.  Eventually,  the intermediated interest rate starts to
5:158:12006:17:17:80:532:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fall again, as firms accumulate sufficient net worth, so that the collateral constraint no
5:159:12096:17:18:80:532:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:longer binds, and intermediary loan supply becomes the limiting factor.  Firms initiate
5:160:12183:18:17:80:532:300:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dividends  even  before  the  economy  has  fully  recovered,  whereas  intermediaries  do  not
5:161:12278:17:17:80:325:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:resume payout until the steady state is reached.
5:162:12326:17:18:98:533:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In a credit crunch, that is, a drop in intermediary net worth, investment drops even if
5:163:12413:18:17:80:532:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the corporate sector remains well capitalized, as firms need to finance a larger part of their
5:164:12507:17:17:80:532:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investment with internal funds due to the limited supply of intermediated loans.  Indeed,
5:165:12596:17:18:80:532:214:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms are forced to delever and may temporarily accumulate more net worth then they
5:166:12679:18:17:80:532:196:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:retain in the steady state.  Moreover, and importantly, a credit crunch can have persistent
5:167:12770:17:17:80:532:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:real effects as corporate investment may not recover for a prolonged period of time, due to
5:168:12861:17:18:80:532:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the slow recovery of intermediary capital.  We emphasize that while firms may seem to be
5:169:12949:18:17:80:532:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:well capitalized because they are paying dividends, the economy nevertheless has not fully
5:170:13039:17:17:80:532:127:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:recovered.  Downturns associated with a credit crunch, that is, a drop in both corporate
5:171:13127:17:18:80:532:110:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and intermediary net worth, are more severe and more protracted, lead to longer stalls
5:172:13213:18:0:80:513:92:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the recovery, and feature higher spreads, especially in a bank-dependent economy.
6:173:13298:0:17:98:533:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We revisit the evidence on the effect of financial crises from the vantage point of our
6:174:13385:17:18:80:532:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:theory.   There  are  three  main  stylized  facts  about  downturns  associated  with  financial
6:175:13482:18:17:80:532:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:crises that emerge from prior empirical work: (i) downturns associated with financial crises
6:176:13574:17:17:80:532:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are more severe; (ii) recoveries from financial crises are protracted and often tentative; and
6:177:13668:17:18:80:532:630:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(iii) the severity of the financial crises itself affects the severity and protractedness of the
6:178:13764:18:17:80:532:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:downturn.  Consistent with this evidence, our model predicts that the effects of a credit
6:179:13853:17:17:80:532:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:crunch on economic activity is protracted due to the slow accumulation of intermediary
6:180:13939:17:18:80:532:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:net  worth.   But  perhaps  most  uniquely,  our  model  captures  the  tentative  and  halting
6:181:14034:18:17:80:532:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nature of recoveries from such episodes emphasized by Reinhart and Rogoff (2014) and
6:182:14118:17:17:80:532:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:allows the analysis of the severity of the credit crunch itself on the recovery, which calls
6:183:14210:17:18:80:532:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for  a  model  with  two  state  variables.   Thus,  the  dynamic  interaction  of  the  two  state
6:184:14309:18:17:80:491:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variables in our model implies rich dynamics with empirically plausible features.
6:185:14390:17:17:98:533:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Few extant theories of financial intermediaries provide a role for intermediary capi-
6:186:14475:17:18:80:532:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tal.  Notable is in particular Holmstr ̈om and Tirole (1997) who model intermediaries as
6:187:14563:18:17:80:532:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:monitors that cannot commit to monitoring and hence need to have their own capital at
6:188:14648:17:17:80:532:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stake to have incentives to monitor.  In their analysis, firm and intermediary capital are
6:189:14738:17:18:80:532:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:exogenous and the comparative statics with respect to these are analyzed.  Holmstr ̈om
6:190:14824:18:17:80:532:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and Tirole conclude that “[a] proper investigation ...  must take into account the feed-
6:191:14912:17:17:80:532:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:back from interest rates to capital values.  This will require an explicitly dynamic model,
6:192:15003:17:18:80:532:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for  instance,  along  the  lines  of  Kiyotaki  and  Moore  [1997a].”   We  provide  a  dynamic
6:193:15099:18:17:80:532:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model in which the joint evolution of firm and intermediary net worth and the interest
6:194:15185:17:17:80:532:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rate on intermediated finance are endogenously determined.  Diamond and Rajan (2001)
6:195:15269:17:18:80:532:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  Diamond  (2007)  model  intermediaries  as  lenders  which  are  better  able  to  enforce
6:196:15364:18:17:80:532:300:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their claims due to their specific liquidation or monitoring ability in a similar spirit to
6:197:15455:17:17:80:532:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:our model, but do not consider equilibrium dynamics.  In contrast, the capitalization of
6:198:15543:17:18:80:532:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:financial intermediaries plays essentially no role in liquidity provision theories of finan-
6:199:15635:18:17:80:532:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cial intermediation (Diamond and Dybvig (1983)), in theories of financial intermediaries
6:200:15723:17:17:80:532:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as delegated, diversified monitors (Diamond (1984), Ramakrishnan and Thakor (1984),
6:201:15806:17:18:80:532:214:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and Williamson (1986)) or in coalition based theories (Townsend (1978) and Boyd and
6:202:15889:18:17:80:167:196:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Prescott (1986)).
6:203:15906:17:17:98:533:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Dynamic models in which net worth plays a role, such as Bernanke and Gertler (1989)
6:204:15989:17:18:80:532:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and Kiyotaki and Moore (1997a), typically consider the role of firm net worth only, al-
6:205:16076:18:17:80:532:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:though  dynamic  models  in  which  intermediary  net  worth  matters  have  recently  been
6:206:16167:17:17:80:532:127:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:considered (see, for example, Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010), who also summarize the recent
6:207:16255:17:19:80:532:110:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:literature, and Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014)).2However, to the best of our knowl-

7:209:16435:0:17:80:532:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:edge, we are the first to consider a dynamic contracting model in which both firm and
7:210:16520:17:18:80:532:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intermediary net worth are critical and jointly affect the dynamics of financing, spreads,
7:211:16610:18:17:80:194:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and economic activity.
7:212:16632:17:17:98:533:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In Section 2 we describe the model with two types of collateral constraints,  for in-
7:213:16717:17:18:80:532:630:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:termediated and direct finance, respectively, and discuss how these collateral constraints
7:214:16807:18:17:80:532:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:can be derived in an economy with limited enforcement and limited participation.  We
7:215:16891:17:17:80:532:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:establish the equivalence of these two economies formally in Appendix A. Section 3 shows
7:216:16979:17:18:80:532:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that intermediation is essential in our economy and determines the capitalization of in-
7:217:17067:18:17:80:532:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:termediaries  and  spreads  on  intermediated  finance  in  the  steady  state.   The  dynamics
7:218:17162:17:17:80:532:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of intermediary capital are analyzed in Section 4,  focusing on the dynamic interaction
7:219:17249:17:18:80:532:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:between  corporate  and  intermediary  net  worth,  the  two  state  variables  in  the  model;
7:220:17344:18:17:80:532:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:specifically, we consider the effects of a downturn, a credit crunch, and a downturn asso-
7:221:17434:17:17:80:532:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ciated with a credit crunch.  In Section 5 we use the model to revisit three main stylized
7:222:17524:17:18:80:532:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:facts about downturns associated with financial crises.  Section 6 concludes.  All proofs

7:225:17678:29:17:80:532:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We  propose  a  dynamic  model  of  financial  intermediaries  that  have  a  collateralization

7:227:17863:18:17:80:532:348:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms can borrow from both intermediaries and households, and all financing needs to be
7:228:17950:17:17:80:532:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:collateralized.   Firm  financing  is  subject  to  two  types  of  collateral  constraints,  one  for

7:230:18149:18:17:80:532:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:better able to enforce collateralized claims, they can lend more than households, but the
7:231:18238:17:17:80:532:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:additional  amount  that  they  can  lend  has  to  be  financed  out  of  their  own  net  worth,
7:232:18336:17:18:80:532:262:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:giving a role to financial intermediary capital.  Thus, the net worth of both intermediaries
7:233:18428:18:17:80:435:244:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and firms are state variables and jointly determine economic activity.
7:234:18498:17:18:98:533:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We show that these collateral constraints can be derived from an economy with limited
7:235:18583:18:17:80:532:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:enforcement that constrains firms’ and intermediaries’ ability to make credible promises.
7:236:18672:17:17:80:532:192:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Intermediaries, but not households, participate in markets at all times which affords inter-
7:237:18764:17:18:80:532:175:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mediaries with an advantage in enforcing claims.  This economy with limited enforcement
7:238:18851:18:21:80:499:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and limited participation is equivalent to our economy with collateral constraints.

8:241:18997:25:17:80:532:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Time is discrete and the horizon infinite.  There are three types of agents:  entrepreneurs,
8:242:19089:17:18:80:417:657:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:financial intermediaries, and households; we discuss these in turn.
8:243:19156:18:17:98:533:639:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:There is a continuum of entrepreneurs or firms with measure one which are risk neutral

8:245:19330:17:18:80:532:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:environment with a representative firm.  The representative firm (which we at times refer
8:246:19419:18:17:80:532:587:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to simply as the firm or the corporate sector) has limited net worthw0at time 0 and has

8:251:19847:17:18:80:532:501:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and strictly concave and satisfies the usual Inada condition, that is, limk→0fk(k) = +∞.
8:252:19935:18:17:80:532:483:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Total factor productivityA(st+1) depends on the statest+1realized at timet+ 1 which
8:253:20018:17:17:80:532:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:follows a Markov process with transition function Π(st,st+1).  The firm can raise financing
8:254:20109:17:18:80:397:449:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from both intermediaries and households as we discuss below.

8:257:20352:17:18:80:532:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  problem  of  a  representative  financial  intermediary  with  limited  net  worthwi0at

8:259:20528:17:17:80:188:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in more detail below.
8:260:20549:17:18:98:533:345:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:There  is  a  continuum  of  households  with  measure  one  which  are  risk  neutral  and
8:261:20640:18:17:80:532:327:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:discount future payoffs at a rateR−1∈(0,1).  Households are assumed to have a large
8:262:20723:17:17:80:532:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:endowment of funds and collateral in all dates and states, and hence are not subject to
8:263:20810:17:18:80:532:293:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:enforcement problems but rather are able to commit to deliver on their promises.  They
8:264:20896:18:17:80:532:275:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are willing to provide any state-contingent claim at an expected rate of returnRas long
8:265:20983:17:17:80:457:258:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as such claims satisfy the firms’ and intermediaries’ collateral constraints.
8:266:21060:17:18:98:532:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We assume thatβ < βi< R−1, that is, households are more patient than intermedi-
8:267:21139:18:17:80:532:223:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:aries which in turn are more patient than the firms.  Since firms and intermediaries are
8:268:21227:17:17:80:532:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:financially constrained, they would have an incentive to accumulate net worth and save
8:269:21313:17:18:80:532:189:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:themselves out of their constraints.  Assuming that firms and intermediaries are impatient
8:270:21403:18:17:80:532:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relative to households is a simple way to ensure that their net worth matters even in the
8:271:21492:17:17:80:532:154:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:long run.  Moreover, assuming that intermediaries are somewhat more patient than firms
8:272:21578:17:18:80:532:137:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:implies that the net worth of both the corporate sector and the intermediary sector are
8:273:21665:18:18:93:532:119:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:3There is a representative intermediary in our model since intermediaries have constant returns to
8:274:21763:18:15:80:532:101:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:scale, making the distribution of intermediaries’ net worth irrelevant and aggregation in the intermedia-
8:275:21868:15:0:80:520:86:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:tion sector straightforward, and thus only the aggregate capital of the intermediation sector matters.
9:276:21971:0:17:80:532:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:uniquely determined in the long run, too.  We think these features are desirable properties
9:277:22062:17:18:80:427:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of a dynamic model of intermediation and are empirically plausible.
9:278:22129:18:17:98:533:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Financial intermediaries in this economy have a collateralization advantage.  Specif-
9:279:22214:17:17:80:532:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ically, intermediaries are better able to collateralize claims than households, that is, in-
9:280:22306:17:18:80:533:630:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:termediaries are able to seize up to fractionθi∈(0,1) of the (resale value of) collateral
9:281:22395:18:17:80:532:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:backing promises issued to them whereas households are able to seize only fractionθ < θi,
9:282:22484:17:17:80:164:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:whereθ∈(0,1).
9:283:22497:17:18:98:533:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:One interpretation of the environment is that there are three types of capital, working
9:284:22584:18:17:80:532:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:capital,  equipment  (fractionθi−θ),  and  structures  (fractionθ)  (see  Figure  1).   Firms
9:285:22677:17:17:80:532:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have to finance working capital entirely out of their own net worth.  Only intermediaries
9:286:22766:17:18:80:532:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:can  lend  against  equipment,  but  both  households  and  intermediaries  can  lend  against
9:287:22860:18:17:80:532:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:structures.  Equipment loans have to be extended by intermediaries and have to be finance
9:288:22949:17:17:80:532:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:out of financial intermediary capital.  We refer to these loans as intermediated finance.
9:289:23038:17:18:80:532:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In contrast, structure loans can be provided by either intermediaries or households.  We
9:290:23126:18:17:80:532:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assume  that  these  loans  are  provided  by  households  and  refer  to  such  loans  as  direct
9:291:23224:17:17:80:532:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:finance.   This  is  without  loss  of  generality  and  we  could  equivalently  assume  that  all
9:292:23323:17:18:80:532:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:corporate loans are extended by the intermediary who in turn borrows from households,
9:293:23408:18:17:80:532:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which we refer to as theindirect implementation.  However, we focus on the (equivalent)
9:294:23495:17:17:80:532:387:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f3:B:direct implementationin which households extend all structure loans directly throughout
9:295:23582:17:18:80:294:370:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:as it simplifies the notation and analysis.4
9:296:23626:18:17:98:533:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We  assume  that  loans  are  one-period  and  state-contingent  and  thus,  the  economy
9:297:23715:17:17:80:532:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:has complete markets in two types of one-period ahead Arrow securities, claims provided
9:298:23802:17:18:80:532:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by intermediaries and claims provided by households, each subject to state-by-state col-
9:299:23890:18:17:80:532:300:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lateral constraints.  These collateral constraints are similar to the ones in Kiyotaki and
9:300:23980:17:17:80:532:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Moore (1997a), except that there are different collateral constraints for promises to pay
9:301:24069:17:18:80:512:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intermediaries and households, and that the collateral constraints are state-by-state.
9:302:24155:18:17:98:533:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Here we simply assume that there are only one-period ahead claims and that inter-
9:303:24236:17:17:80:532:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mediaries provide the equipment loans, and only the equipment loans, and must finance
9:304:24321:17:18:80:532:214:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:these out of their own net worth.  In Section 2.3 we provide an environment with limited
9:305:24409:18:17:80:532:196:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:enforcement  and  limited  participation  which  is  equivalent  to  the  economy  with  collat-
9:306:24505:17:17:80:532:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:eral  constraints  described  here.   In  that  environment  each  period  has  two  subperiods,
9:307:24601:17:18:80:532:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:morning and afternoon, and equipment can serve as collateral only in the morning.  The
9:308:24687:18:17:80:532:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:key assumption affording intermediaries an enforcement advantage is that intermediaries,
9:309:24775:17:18:80:532:127:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:but not households, participate in markets at all times; thus, equipment loans must be
9:310:24861:18:18:93:532:109:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:4Holmstr ̈om and Tirole’s (1997) model of financial intermediation also has two implementations – a
9:311:24960:18:0:80:532:91:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:direct one and an indirect one – which are equivalent and they, too, focus on the direct implementation.
10:312:25065:0:17:80:532:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:provided by intermediaries.  Moreover,  limited enforcement of intermediaries’ liabilities
10:313:25155:17:18:80:532:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:implies that intermediaries must finance such loans out of their own funds.  Thus,  the
10:314:25242:18:17:80:532:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:properties that we have simply assumed here are in fact endogenous properties of optimal
10:315:25330:17:38:80:177:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dynamic contracts.

11:346:27225:18:17:80:532:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:While equation (3) is stated as an inequality, which allows for free disposal, it binds at

13:450:33008:25:17:80:532:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This section describes an economy with limited enforcement which is equivalent to the
13:451:33093:17:18:80:532:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:economy with collateral constraints described above.  First, we describe the environment
13:452:33181:18:17:80:532:294:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with limited enforcement; second, we state the equivalent representation with collateral
13:453:33269:17:17:80:532:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:constraints; and third we sketch our equivalence result which we formally state and prove
13:454:33358:17:18:80:533:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in Appendix A.9This equivalence is significant for three reasons;  it shows that (i) the
13:455:33446:18:17:80:532:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:restriction to one-period ahead contracts is without loss of generality; (ii) intermediaries
13:456:33538:17:17:80:532:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:must provide equipment loans, that is, loans against the additional amount of collateral
13:457:33626:17:18:80:532:208:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:they  can  seize;  and  (iii)  intermediaries  must  finance  these  loans  out  of  their  own  net
13:458:33726:18:17:80:532:190:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:worth.  Thus, the economy with limited enforcement endogenizes three key properties of
13:459:33812:17:17:80:532:173:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the model with collateral constraints that we have simply assumed so far.  That said, a
13:460:33899:17:18:80:532:156:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reader, who is primarily interested in the dynamic implications of our model, may choose
13:461:33987:18:17:80:370:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to skip this derivation and proceed directly to Section 3.
13:462:34045:17:17:98:533:121:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Suppose that the environment is as before, but that each period has two subperiods
13:463:34127:17:18:80:532:104:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which we refer to as morning and afternoon.  The economy has limited participation by
13:464:34212:18:0:93:532:86:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:9In Appendix C, we establish this equivalence and characterize the equilibrium in a static environment.
14:465:34317:0:17:80:532:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:households.  All types of agents participate in markets in the afternoon.  In the morning,
14:466:34407:17:18:80:532:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:however, only entrepreneurs and intermediaries participate in markets but not households.
14:467:34496:18:17:80:483:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This is the key assumption affording intermediaries an enforcement advantage.
14:468:34573:17:17:98:533:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The economy has limited enforcement in the spirit of Kehoe and Levine (1993) ex-
14:469:34653:17:18:80:532:630:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cept that firms or intermediaries that default cannot be excluded from participating in
14:470:34740:18:17:80:532:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:financial and real asset markets going forward.  Rampini and Viswanathan (2010, 2013)
14:471:34825:17:17:80:532:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:study this class of economies but consider an economy with only one type of lender with
14:472:34912:17:18:80:532:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:deep pockets and hence take the interest rate as given.  We build on their work by con-
14:473:34999:18:17:80:532:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sidering an economy with two types of lenders, intermediaries and households, of which
14:474:35085:17:17:80:532:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:one has limited net worth, and extend their analysis by determining the interest rates on
14:475:35174:17:18:80:500:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intermediated finance in dynamic general equilibrium with aggregate fluctuations.
14:476:35255:18:17:98:533:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Specifically, enforcement is limited as follows:  Firms can abscond both in the morning
14:477:35342:17:17:80:532:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and in the afternoon.  In the morning,  after cash flows are realized,  firms can abscond
14:478:35431:17:18:80:532:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with  all  cash  flows  and  a  fraction  1−θiof  depreciated  capital,  whereθi∈(0,1).   In
14:479:35523:18:17:80:532:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the afternoon, firms can abscond with cash flows net of payments made in the morning
14:480:35607:17:17:80:532:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and a fraction 1−θof depreciated capital, whereθ∈(0,1).  Critically, we assume that
14:481:35690:17:18:80:532:422:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:B:θi> θ,  which  means  that  firms  can  abscond  with  less  capital  in  the  morning  than  in
14:482:35786:18:17:80:532:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  afternoon.   Intermediaries,  too,  can  abscond  in  both  subperiods,  although  there  is
14:483:35883:17:17:80:532:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:no  temptation  for  intermediaries  to  do  so  in  the  morning,  as  they  will  at  best  receive
14:484:35984:17:18:80:532:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:payments, and so we can ignore this constraint and focus just on the afternoon.  In the
14:485:36071:18:17:80:532:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:afternoon, intermediaries can abscond with any payments received in the morning.  To
14:486:36155:17:17:80:502:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reiterate, neither firms nor intermediaries are excluded from markets after default.
14:487:36239:17:18:98:533:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The timing is summarized as follows (see Figure 2):  Each afternoon, firms and inter-
14:488:36324:18:17:80:532:300:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mediaries first decide whether to make their promised payments or default.  Then, firms,
14:489:36412:17:17:80:532:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intermediaries, and households consume, invest, and borrow and lend.  The next morning,
14:490:36499:17:18:80:532:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cash flows are realized.  Firms decide whether to make their promised morning payments
14:491:36585:18:17:80:532:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or  default.   Firms  carry  over  the  cash  flows  net  of  payments  made  and  intermediaries
14:492:36682:17:17:80:532:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:carry over any funds received until the afternoon.  No other decisions are made until the
14:493:36771:17:18:80:132:214:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:afternoon.
14:494:36781:18:17:98:533:196:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:It is critical that intermediated loans backed by the additional amount of collateral
14:495:36866:17:17:80:532:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that can be seized in the morning, that is,θi−θ, are in fact repaid in the morning, as by the
14:496:36959:17:18:80:532:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:afternoon firms can abscond with that additional amount of capital and these payments
14:497:37044:18:17:80:532:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are no longer enforceable.  This implies that these loans are explicitly short term, that is,
14:498:37137:17:17:80:532:127:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are extended in the afternoon and must be repaid in the morning and cannot be rolled
14:499:37221:17:18:80:532:110:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:over.  It moreover implies that these loans must be extended by intermediaries, as only
14:500:37308:18:0:80:532:92:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:they participate in markets in the morning when the claims need to be enforced.  And
15:501:37394:0:17:80:532:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:finally it means that intermediaries must finance these loans out of their own net worth,
15:502:37483:17:18:80:532:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as they cannot in turn finance them by borrowing from households because they could
15:503:37566:18:17:80:532:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:simply default on promises to repay the households in the afternoon and abscond with
15:504:37650:17:17:80:285:647:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:the payments received in the morning.10
15:505:37689:17:18:98:533:630:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Financial intermediaries are able to refinance loans that they make to firms up to a
15:506:37773:18:17:80:532:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fractionθof collateral which are repaid in the afternoon by borrowing from households.
15:507:37859:17:17:80:532:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In other words, intermediaries’ corporate loans up to fractionθcan be used as collateral
15:508:37947:17:18:80:532:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to borrow from households,  whereas loans beyond that,  for fractionθi−θ,  have to be
15:509:38032:18:17:80:516:560:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:financed by intermediaries themselves, that is, out of financial intermediary capital.11
15:510:38120:17:17:98:533:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:As discussed before, one interpretation of the environment is that there are three types
15:511:38208:17:18:80:533:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of capital, working capital, equipment (fractionθi−θ), and structures (fractionθ) (see
15:512:38294:18:17:80:532:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Figure 1).  Firms can always abscond with working capital.  Firms cannot abscond with
15:513:38379:17:17:80:532:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equipment in the morning, but can abscond with equipment in the afternoon.12Firms can
15:514:38464:17:18:80:532:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:never abscond with structures.  Structure loans can be provided by either intermediaries
15:515:38552:18:17:80:532:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or households.  In contrast, equipment loans have to be extended by intermediaries, have
15:516:38640:17:17:80:532:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to be repaid in the morning, and have to be finance out of financial intermediary capital.
15:517:38730:17:18:98:533:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:For our environment with two subperiods, we can now state the equivalent problem
15:518:38810:18:17:80:532:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with collateral constraints in sequence form.  Thefirm’s problem(PCC0) at time 0 in the
15:519:38897:17:17:80:532:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:afternoon is to choose a sequencexCC0≡{xCCt}∞t=0wherexCCt= (dt,kt,bt,bit,bat), that is,

15:521:39070:18:18:80:532:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:loans from intermediaries to be repaid in the morningbitand in the afternoonbat, given
15:522:39156:18:17:89:532:334:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:10If households were to participate in the morning as well, then they would have the same ability to
15:523:39256:17:15:80:532:317:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:enforce  claims  as  intermediaries,  and  since  households  have  deep  pockets,  there  would  be  no  role  for
15:524:39371:15:14:80:532:302:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:intermediaries at all.  If instead there were only one subperiod and default decisions would have to be
15:525:39474:14:15:80:532:288:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:made simultaneously, and one were to assume that intermediaries nevertheless retained their repossession
15:526:39578:15:14:80:532:273:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:advantage, this would not be sufficient, since intermediaries would have no incentive to default before
15:527:39681:14:14:80:532:259:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:receiving any payments, and intermediaries could finance all corporate loans, including equipment loans,
15:528:39785:14:15:80:532:245:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:with loans from households and hence would not need any intermediary capital; effectively, households
15:529:39886:15:14:80:532:230:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:could use the enforcement ability of the intermediaries fully,  and the economy would be equivalent to
15:530:39988:14:14:80:532:216:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:an economy without subperiods and with only one type of lender,  households,  that can enforce up to
15:531:40088:14:15:80:532:202:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:fractionθi.  Thus, limited participation is essential as a foundation for the economy with two types of
15:532:40191:15:9:80:173:187:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:collateral constraints.
15:533:40214:9:18:89:532:178:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:11In contrast, an intermediary could promise corporate loans backed byθi−θto other intermediaries,
15:534:40312:18:14:80:532:160:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:as these participate in markets in the morning as well, that is, the interbank market is frictionless in our
15:535:40420:14:9:80:445:146:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:model, which is why we are able to consider a representative financial intermediary.
15:536:40504:9:18:89:532:137:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:12The idea is that unlike immovable assets such as structures which are always collateralizable, movable
15:537:40608:18:14:80:532:119:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:assets such as machinery and equipment are bolted down in the morning and hence collateralizable then,
15:538:40710:14:0:80:421:105:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:but are unbolted by the afternoon and hence can no longer serve as collateral.

17:591:43097:17:18:80:532:494:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:constraints imply that intermediaries can borrow from households only to the extent that
17:592:43185:18:17:80:532:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:they have corporate loans that pay off (in the afternoon) in that state.  Intermediaries

17:594:43361:17:18:80:395:442:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intermediaries themselves could abscond with such payments.
17:595:43420:18:26:98:506:424:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We define an equilibrium for the economy with collateral constraints as follows:

17:601:43915:26:18:98:532:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Observe that the firm’s problemPCC0and the intermediary’s problemPCCi0only deter-

17:603:44079:17:17:80:532:268:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:without loss of generality, that is, we can assume that all afternoon loans are extended by
17:604:44170:17:18:80:532:251:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:households only.  With this assumption and defining the state variables, net worth, for the

17:606:44337:17:17:80:532:216:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:respectively, we obtain the recursive formulation of the firm’s and intermediary’s problem
17:607:44427:17:18:80:316:199:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in equations (1)-(6) and (7)-(10), respectively.
17:608:44475:18:17:98:533:181:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, let us sketch our main equivalence result (see Appendix A for the formal state-
17:609:44563:17:17:80:532:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ment and proof).  The economic intuition for the equivalence of the economy with limited
17:610:44651:17:18:80:532:147:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:enforcement,  described  in  detail  in  Appendix  A,  and  the  economy  with  collateral  con-
17:611:44747:18:17:80:532:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:straints discussed in this section is based on two main insights.  First, limited enforcement
17:612:44840:17:17:80:532:112:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:implies that the present value of any sequence of promises can never exceed the current
17:613:44927:17:18:80:532:95:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:value of collateral, as otherwise delivering on these promises would not be optimal and the
17:614:45018:18:0:80:532:77:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:borrower would default.  Indeed, limited enforcement constraints are equivalent to a type
18:615:45109:0:17:80:532:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of collateral constraint on the present value of sequences of promises (see Theorem A.1).
18:616:45198:17:18:80:532:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Second, any sequence of promises satisfying these collateral constraints on present values
18:617:45288:18:17:80:532:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:can be implemented with one-period ahead morning and afternoon claims subject to the
18:618:45372:17:17:80:532:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:collateral constraints in (25) and (26) for the firm and (31) for the intermediary, respec-
18:619:45463:17:18:80:532:630:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tively (see Theorem A.2).  The economy with collateral constraints is tractable, in part
18:620:45551:18:17:80:532:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:because we can hence restrict attention, without loss of generality, to complete markets
18:621:45639:17:17:80:532:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in one-period ahead morning and afternoon Arrow securities.  An important subtlety in
18:622:45724:17:18:80:532:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:establishing the equivalence is the determination of the present values of morning and
18:623:45810:18:17:80:532:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:afternoon promises.  The fact that afternoon promises are discounted to the previous af-
18:624:45898:17:17:80:532:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ternoon by both households and intermediaries at the interest rate charged by households
18:625:45986:17:18:80:532:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:obtains by no arbitrage.  Morning promises are discounted to the previous afternoon at
18:626:46072:18:17:80:532:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the interest rate on intermediated finance, and, if necessary, discounted further back at
18:627:46161:17:17:80:284:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the interest rate charged by households.
18:628:46201:17:18:98:533:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This economy with limited enforcement and limited participation therefore endoge-

18:630:46367:17:17:80:532:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lateral constraints.  Henceforth, we work with the equivalent, recursive formulation of the
18:631:46458:17:44:80:264:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:economy with collateral constraints.

18:633:46536:30:17:80:532:348:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Intermediary capital is scarce in the model.  We first show that, as a consequence, inter-
18:634:46626:17:17:80:532:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mediated finance carries a premium and that that premium affects investment and hence
18:635:46711:17:18:80:532:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:real economic activity.  We then show that intermediaries are essential in our economy,
18:636:46798:18:17:80:532:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that is, allow the economy to achieve allocations that would not be achievable in their
18:637:46885:17:17:80:532:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:absence.  Finally, we show that in a steady state intermediary finance carries a positive
18:638:46974:17:38:80:532:262:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spread over direct finance and determine the steady state capitalization of intermediaries.

18:642:47292:17:17:80:532:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of finance.  Since the firm would never be willing to pay more for intermediated finance
18:643:47380:17:18:80:532:147:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:than the shadow cost of internal funds, the premium on internal finance is higher than the
18:644:47470:18:17:80:532:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f8:B:premium on intermediated finance. Define the premium on internal fundsρas 1/(R+ρ)≡

20:709:51903:28:27:98:374:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We define the essentiality of intermediaries as follows:

20:712:52113:27:18:98:533:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The above results together imply that financial intermediaries must always be essen-

20:714:52282:17:17:80:532:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:since direct finance is relatively cheap.  If firms moreover always borrow a positive amount
20:715:52374:17:18:80:532:189:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from intermediaries, then they must achieve an allocation that would not otherwise be

22:766:56051:18:17:80:532:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In contrast, intermediary leverage can be defined in our indirect implementation as the

22:771:56496:17:18:80:532:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in  practice  may  simply  be  a  consequence  of  the  fact  that  their  capital  structures  are
22:772:56595:18:17:80:532:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:determined by different factors.  Thus, the model has the potential to provide consistent
22:773:56684:17:17:80:403:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:guidance on the financial structure of firms and intermediaries.
22:774:56748:17:18:98:533:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Financial intermediaries are essential in our economy.  Intermediated finance is costly
22:775:56835:18:17:80:532:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the spread on intermediated finance affects investment and aggregate economic out-

22:779:57187:17:17:80:532:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dynamics of our economy with intermediated finance, including the dynamics of firm and
22:780:57273:17:45:80:412:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intermediary net worth and the spread on intermediated finance.
22:781:57336:45:29:80:392:273:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:4    Dynamics of intermediary capital
22:782:57373:29:17:80:532:244:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Our model allows the analysis of the joint dynamics of the capitalization of the corporate
22:783:57463:17:18:80:532:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  intermediary  sector.   The  net  worth  of  firms  and  intermediaries  are  the  key  state
22:784:57561:18:17:80:532:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variables determining dynamic intermediated loan demand and supply and the interest
22:785:57644:17:17:80:532:192:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rate on intermediated finance.  The interaction between firms and intermediaries which
22:786:57730:17:18:80:532:175:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are both subject to financial constraints leads to subtle dynamics with several compelling
22:787:57820:18:17:80:532:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:features.  For example, spreads on intermediated finance are high when both firms’ and
22:788:57906:17:17:80:532:140:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intermediaries’ net worth is low and intermediaries are poorly capitalized even relative
22:789:57994:17:18:80:532:123:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to  firms.   A  key  feature  is  that  intermediary  capital  accumulation  is  slow  relative  to
22:790:58093:18:17:80:532:105:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:corporate  net  worth  accumulation,  at  least  early  in  a  recovery.   One  reflection  of  this
22:791:58193:17:0:80:532:88:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is that the recovery from a credit crunch, that is, a drop in intermediary net worth, is
23:792:58283:0:17:80:532:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relative slow.  Another reflection is that a simultaneous drop in the net worth of both
23:793:58370:17:18:80:532:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms  and  intermediaries,  that  is,  a  downturn  associated  with  a  credit  crunch,  results
23:794:58468:18:17:80:532:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in an especially slow recovery,  and that such recoveries can stall,  with firm investment
23:795:58558:17:17:80:532:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and output remaining depressed for an extended period of time.  We relate the dynamic
23:796:58643:17:39:80:400:630:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:properties of our economy to stylized facts in the next section.
23:797:58707:39:25:80:442:591:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:4.1    Dynamics of intermediary capital and spreads
23:798:58758:25:17:80:532:566:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Consider  the  recovery  of  the  economy  from  an  initial,  low  level  of  net  worth  of  firms
23:799:58858:17:17:80:532:549:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and/or intermediaries, say after a downturn or credit crunch, that is, the deterministic
23:800:58946:17:18:80:532:532:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dynamics in an equilibrium converging to the steady state.  We show that the equilibrium
23:801:59034:18:17:80:532:514:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dynamics evolve in two main phases, an initial one in which the corporate sector pays no
23:802:59122:17:17:80:532:497:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dividends and a second one in which the corporate sector pays dividends.  Intermediaries
23:803:59210:17:18:80:532:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:do  not  pay  dividends  until  the  steady  state  is  reached,  except  that  they  may  pay  an
23:804:59308:18:17:80:532:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:initial dividend, if they are initially well capitalized relative to the corporate sector, as
23:805:59401:17:17:80:169:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we discuss below.
23:806:59418:17:18:98:533:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Before stating these results formally (see Proposition 5 below), we provide an intuitive
23:807:59506:18:17:80:532:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:discussion (see also Figure 3 for an illustration).  Suppose both firms and intermediaries
23:808:59596:17:17:80:532:393:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are constrained, that is, the marginal value of net worth strictly exceeds 1; then neither
23:809:59686:17:18:80:532:376:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms  nor  intermediaries  pay  dividends  (Region  ND  in  the  proposition  below).   If  the
23:810:59782:18:17:80:532:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms’ collateral constraint on intermediated finance is slack, the intermediated interest
23:811:59872:17:17:80:532:341:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rate equals firms’ marginal levered return on capital (and exceeds the corporate discount

23:834:60377:17:17:80:532:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:so that firms’ loan demand exceeds intermediaries loan supply, which is constrained by
23:835:60463:17:18:80:532:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intermediary net worth.  Intermediaries then lend their entire net worthwito firms, which
23:836:60552:18:17:80:533:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in turn use their own net worthwplus loans from intermediaries to finance the fraction

23:838:60726:17:18:80:532:131:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the intermediated interest rate decreases in both firm and intermediary net worth since

24:850:61312:17:18:80:532:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:case, the ratio of the net worth of firms relative to intermediaries matters, and remarkably
24:851:61404:18:17:80:532:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  intermediated  interest  rate  increases  in  firms’  net  worth  keeping  intermediary  net
24:852:61501:17:18:80:532:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:worth the same; the economic intuition is that higher firm net worth raises investment
24:853:61587:18:17:80:529:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and thus the collateral firms are able to pledge, increasing the equilibrium interest rate.
24:854:61678:17:17:98:532:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:If the ratiowwiis sufficiently low, loan demand can be so low that the interest rate on
24:855:61765:17:18:80:532:512:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intermediated finance is below not just the firms’ discount rate but also intermediaries’

24:857:61954:17:17:80:532:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:asR,  the  discount  rate  of  households;  this  can  happen  when  intermediaries  save  net
24:858:62048:17:18:80:532:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:worth by lending to households, because current corporate loan demand is very low but
24:859:62133:18:17:80:532:442:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expected  to  increase  as  firms  recover.   Throughout  Region  ND,  firm  net  worth  must
24:860:62226:17:17:80:532:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:accumulate faster than intermediary net worth because firms’ net worth grows at their
24:861:62311:17:18:80:532:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:average levered return on capital (which exceeds their marginal levered return on capital)
24:862:62401:18:17:80:532:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:whereas intermediaries accumulate net worth at the intermediated interest rate, which,
24:863:62487:17:17:80:454:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as just argued, is weakly below firms’ marginal levered return on capital.

26:964:67086:17:17:80:532:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more quickly.  Both of these features are in a sense a consequence of the fact that inter-

26:967:67354:17:17:80:532:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:do not pay dividends.  The dynamics of financial intermediary net worth are relatively
26:968:67440:17:18:80:532:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:simple,  since  as  long  as  they  do  not  pay  dividends  (which  is  the  case  until  the  steady

27:996:69118:17:17:80:532:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  a  downturn  associated  with  a  credit  crunch,  that  is,  a  simultaneous  drop  in  both

27:999:69304:25:17:80:532:566:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Suppose the economy experiences a downturn, which we model as an unanticipated one-
27:1000:69387:17:17:80:533:549:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time drop in corporate net worthw. We consider a downturn without a credit crunch, that
27:1001:69474:17:18:80:532:532:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is,  assume that intermediaries’ net worth remains unchanged at its ex-dividend steady
27:1002:69560:18:17:80:532:514:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:state level.  Figure 4 illustrates the dynamics of firm and intermediary net worth, the in-
27:1003:69651:17:17:80:532:497:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:terest rate on intermediated finance, intermediary lending, and investment following such
27:1004:69740:17:18:80:532:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a downturn (at time 0).  In terms of Proposition 5, the recovery evolves in several phases,
27:1005:69831:18:17:80:532:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as the net worths of the two sectors transit through various parts of first Region ND and
27:1006:69920:17:17:80:158:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:then Region D.
27:1007:69934:17:18:98:533:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:On impact the drop in corporate net worth results in a drop in corporate loan de-
27:1008:70015:18:17:80:532:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mand, leaving intermediaries initially relatively well capitalized.  Indeed, as can be seen in
27:1009:70109:17:17:80:532:393:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Panel A and Panel B2 of Figure 4, intermediaries respond by paying an initial dividend,
27:1010:70196:17:18:80:532:376:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as their previous net worth is much more than firms’ reduced loan demand can accom-
27:1011:70279:18:17:80:532:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:modate.  Moreover, intermediaries do not pay out all excess funds but conserve some net
27:1012:70366:17:17:80:532:341:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:worth to meet future loan demand by lending some of their funds to households; in fact,
27:1013:70453:17:18:80:532:324:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the intermediaries’ lending to households exceeds their lending to the corporate sector
27:1014:70540:18:17:80:532:306:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:early on (see Panel B3).  Because intermediaries lend to households at the margin, the
27:1015:70626:17:17:80:532:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equilibrium spread on intermediated finance is zero, that is,R′i=R(see Panel B1); in
27:1016:70710:17:18:80:532:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this sense, intermediaries are holding “cash” at an interest rate below their discount rate
27:1017:70801:18:17:80:532:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for some time.  The reason why intermediaries are willing to hold cash at a rate of re-
27:1018:70888:17:17:80:532:237:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:turn below their rate of time preference is because they anticipate an eventual rise in the
27:1019:70979:17:18:80:519:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intermediated interest rate above their rate of time preference, at least for some time.
27:1020:71067:18:17:98:532:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Intermediaries accumulate net worth at rateRin this phase while the corporate sector
27:1021:71151:17:17:80:532:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:accumulates net worth at a faster rate, given the high marginal levered return on capital;
27:1022:71241:17:18:80:532:168:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:thus, the net worth of the corporate sector rises relative to the net worth of intermediaries.
27:1023:71335:18:17:80:532:150:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:As firms’ net worth rises, so do corporate investmentk=w/℘i(R) as well as corporate
27:1024:71418:17:17:80:410:133:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f7:B:loan demand.  In Figure 4, this phase last from time 0 to time 4.
27:1025:71483:17:18:98:533:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Eventually, the increased net worth of the corporate sector raises loan demand to the
27:1026:71568:18:17:80:532:98:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:point  where  intermediated  finance  becomes  scarce  and  the  intermediated  interest  rate
27:1027:71662:17:0:80:532:81:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rises  (time  5  in  the  figure).   In  the  case  considered  in  Figure  4,  since  the  initial  drop
28:1028:71769:0:17:80:532:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in net worth is not too large,  it turns out that the cost of intermediated finance stays
28:1029:71858:17:18:80:532:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:belowβ−1and firms happen to initiate dividend payments at the same time; that is, the
28:1030:71943:18:17:80:532:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:economy has reaches Region D at time 5.  Firms’ collateral constraint continues to bind
28:1031:72030:17:17:80:532:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and, together with firms’ investment Euler equation, jointly determines the intermediated
28:1032:72119:17:18:80:532:630:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interest rate and investment.  Although firms are paying dividends from time 5 onwards,
28:1033:72206:18:17:80:532:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:neither investment nor intermediaries have fully recovered.  As intermediaries continue to
28:1034:72296:17:17:80:532:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:accumulate net worth between time 5 and time 8, intermediary loan supply increases and
28:1035:72382:17:18:80:532:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the intermediated interest rate drops.  In response, firms continue to increase investment.
28:1036:72473:18:17:80:532:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Intermediaries’ net worth reaches its (ex dividend) steady state value at time 8 and the
28:1037:72561:17:17:80:532:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:economy is back in steady state (as described in Proposition 4) from then on, with the
28:1038:72647:17:18:80:532:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cost of intermediated finance equal toβ−1i, the unconstrained intermediaries’ shadow cost
28:1039:72736:18:17:80:232:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for providing corporate loans.
28:1040:72766:17:17:98:533:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We emphasize two key aspects of the dynamics of intermediary capital illustrated by
28:1041:72849:17:18:80:532:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  recovery  from  a  downturn  traced  out  here,  beyond  the  fact  that  intermediary  and
28:1042:72945:18:17:80:532:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firm net worth affect the dynamics jointly.  First, intermediary capital accumulates more
28:1043:73034:17:17:80:532:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:slowly than corporate net worth as long as both firms and intermediaries are constrained.
28:1044:73123:17:18:80:532:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Second, when the corporate sector is temporarily relatively poorly capitalized, the interest
28:1045:73215:18:17:80:532:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rate on intermediated finance is low and intermediaries conserve net worth by lending to
28:1046:73303:17:17:80:532:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:households at a low interest rate to meet the higher subsequent corporate loan demand.
28:1047:73389:17:18:80:532:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Of course, the second observation is a reflection of the relatively slow pace of intermediary
28:1048:73482:18:38:80:228:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:capital accumulation as well.
28:1049:73511:38:25:80:317:314:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:4.3    Dynamics of a credit crunch
28:1050:73545:25:17:80:533:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Suppose the economy experiences acredit  crunch, which we model here as an unantic-
28:1051:73628:17:18:80:532:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ipated  one-time  drop  in  intermediary  net  worthwi.   We  assume  that  the  economy  is
28:1052:73720:18:17:80:532:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:otherwise deterministic and is in steady state when the credit crunch hits with corpo-
28:1053:73806:17:17:80:532:237:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rate net worth at its (ex-dividend) steady state value.  Figure 5 illustrates the effects of
28:1054:73898:17:18:80:532:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:such a credit crunch on interest rates, net worth, intermediary lending, and investment.
28:1055:73986:18:17:80:532:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The drop in intermediary net worth results in a reduction in lending and an increase in
28:1056:74073:17:17:80:532:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the spread on intermediated finance on impact (see time 0 in Panel B1).16Moreover, the
28:1057:74159:17:18:80:532:168:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:higher cost of intermediated finance increases the user cost of capital (33) as the premium
28:1058:74250:18:17:80:532:150:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on internal finance increases as well and so the investment Euler equation implies that
28:1059:74337:17:17:80:532:133:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investment drops (see Panel B4).  Hence, a credit crunch has real effects in our model.
28:1060:74424:17:18:80:532:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Due to the limited supply of intermediated finance firms are forced to delever at time 0,
28:1061:74513:18:18:89:532:98:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:16If the credit crunch would hit before dividends are paid, then firms and intermediaries could absorb
28:1062:74615:18:0:80:385:80:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:the shock by cutting dividends, at least partially, reducing its impact.
29:1063:74689:0:17:80:532:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:replacing  reduced  intermediary  loans  with  internal  funds.   Given  their  limited  internal
29:1064:74786:17:18:80:312:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:funds, firms are moreover forced to downsize.
29:1065:74831:18:17:98:533:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:At time 1, the corporate sector reaccumulates net worth leading to an initial partial
29:1066:74916:17:17:80:532:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:recovery in investment and output; indeed, firms reinitiate dividend payments at time 1.
29:1067:75004:17:18:80:532:630:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:However, the economy and especially intermediaries have not fully recovered at this point,
29:1068:75094:18:17:80:532:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as intermediary net worth remains well below its steady state level.  The recovery stalls,
29:1069:75184:17:17:80:532:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:potentially for a long time (from time 1 to time 14 in Figure 5),  in the sense that the
29:1070:75272:17:18:80:532:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interest rate on intermediated finance remains elevated atR′i=β−1> R′∗i=β−1iand
29:1071:75351:18:17:80:533:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investment remains constant below its steady state level at ̄k < k∗.  The reason is that
29:1072:75439:17:17:80:532:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms’ user cost of capital remains elevated despite the fact that the corporate sector is
29:1073:75529:17:18:80:532:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:well  capitalized  and  paying  dividends,  as  intermediaries’  capacity  to  extend  relatively
29:1074:75626:18:17:80:532:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cheap financing is reduced.  Thus, the real effects in our model are persistent, even if the
29:1075:75718:17:17:80:532:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:corporate sector recapitalizes relatively quickly, and the full recovery of the real economy
29:1076:75810:17:18:80:532:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is delayed.  We emphasize that while firms seem to be well capitalized because they are
29:1077:75897:18:17:80:429:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:paying dividends at this point, the economy has not fully recovered.
29:1078:75965:17:17:98:533:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The recovery only resumes once intermediaries accumulate sufficient capital to meet
29:1079:76048:17:18:80:532:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:corporate loan demand atR′i=β−1.  At that point, intermediary interest rates start to
29:1080:76133:18:17:80:532:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fall and investment begins to recover (time 15 to 18); as the interest rate on intermediated
29:1081:76225:17:17:80:532:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:finance is now below the shadow cost of internal funds of the corporate sector, the collat-
29:1082:76316:17:18:80:532:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:eral constraint binds again.  Investment increases due to the reduced cost of intermediated
29:1083:76407:18:17:80:532:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:financing and the recovery resumes.  Eventually (at time 18), intermediaries accumulate
29:1084:76494:17:17:80:532:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their steady state level of net worth and the cost of intermediated finance reachesβ−1i,
29:1085:76582:17:18:80:532:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the unconstrained intermediaries’ shadow cost of providing loans, and investment recovers
29:1086:76671:18:17:80:373:300:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fully; and finally the steady state is reached (at time 19).
29:1087:76731:17:17:98:533:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We  emphasize  two  key  additional  aspects  of  the  dynamics  of  our  economy.   First,
29:1088:76822:17:18:80:532:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  recovery  from  a  credit  crunch  can  be  much  delayed,  or  can  stall,  due  to  the  slow
29:1089:76922:18:17:80:532:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:accumulation of intermediary net worth; thus, one feature of a credit crunch in our model
29:1090:77011:17:17:80:532:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is the persistence of the real effects.  Second, the response of firms’ to a credit crunch is
29:1091:77104:17:18:80:532:214:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:also striking.  In response to a credit crunch, firms cut dividends to substitute retained
29:1092:77194:18:17:80:532:196:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:earnings for intermediated loans.  That is, firms delever and temporarily accumulate more
29:1093:77283:17:17:80:532:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:net worth than they retain in the steady state, and only as the intermediaries recover, do
29:1094:77373:17:18:80:532:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms gradually relever.  The interaction between the two sectors which are both subject
29:1095:77461:18:0:80:448:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to financial constraint leads to rich implications for economic dynamics.

30:1101:77940:17:18:80:532:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:finance.  We find that downturns associated with a credit crunch are more severe and more
30:1102:78029:18:17:80:515:587:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:protracted, and feature higher spreads and slower corporate net worth accumulation.
30:1103:78112:17:17:98:533:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Figure 6 traces out three scenarios: a downturn in corporate net worth without a credit
30:1104:78199:17:18:80:532:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:crunch (solid), and downturns in corporate net worth associated with a moderate and a
30:1105:78284:18:17:80:532:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:severe credit crunch (dotted and dashed, respectively).  The downturn in corporate net
30:1106:78370:17:17:80:532:518:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:worth without a credit crunch is the baseline scenario analyzed in Section 4.1 and Figure 4
30:1107:78461:17:18:80:532:501:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:above.  As noted there, in this scenario, the intermediary is initially well-capitalized and
30:1108:78553:18:17:80:532:483:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:can hence accommodate the reduced corporate loan demand easily; spreads are initially
30:1109:78638:17:17:80:532:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:low, as intermediaries conserve net worth by lending to households.  As corporate loan
30:1110:78724:17:18:80:532:449:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:demand  increases  and  the  economy  recovers,  spreads  begin  to  rise  and  eventually  fall
30:1111:78820:18:17:80:532:431:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:back to the steady state level.  The corporate sector accumulates net worth faster and
30:1112:78906:17:17:80:374:414:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reinitiates dividends sooner than the intermediary sector.
30:1113:78964:17:18:98:533:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:A moderate credit crunch slows the recovery of investment and intermediary lending
30:1114:79046:18:17:80:532:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(see Panel B4 and B3, respectively), and raises spreads earlier and to a higher level (see
30:1115:79136:17:17:80:532:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Panel B1).17Corporate net worth accumulation is also slowed somewhat and the reiniti-
30:1116:79221:17:18:80:532:345:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ation of corporate dividends is delayed; moreover, the corporate sector first accumulates
30:1117:79310:18:17:80:532:327:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:net  worth,  and  then  partially  draws  down  its  net  worth  as  intermediaries  recover  (see
30:1118:79408:17:17:80:532:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Panel B2).  Moreover,  the recovery stalls,  albeit briefly,  when the corporate sector has
30:1119:79499:17:18:80:532:293:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:recovered to the point where it initiates dividends, but the intermediary sector still has
30:1120:79589:18:17:80:532:275:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not accumulated sufficient net worth to meet loan demand atR′i=β−1(see the leveling
30:1121:79672:17:17:80:532:258:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:off of investment and spreads from time 6 to 8 in Panels B4 and B1).  Once intermediaries
30:1122:79761:17:18:80:532:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:accumulate enough net worth to accommodate loan demand at an interest rate equal to
30:1123:79844:18:18:80:378:223:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the corporate sector’s discount rate, the recovery resumes.
30:1124:79903:18:18:89:532:205:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:17Indeed,  spreads  rise  over  a  couple  of  periods  (from  time  1  to  time  3);  at  time  2  the  corporate
30:1125:80017:18:14:80:533:187:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:sector borrows all the funds intermediaries are able to lend and investsk= (w+wi)/℘.The interest
30:1126:80113:14:14:80:532:173:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:rate on intermediated finance is determined by the collateral constraint,  which is binding,  and equals
30:1127:80217:14:15:80:532:159:10:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f6:F:R′i= (θi−θ) (w/wi+ 1) (1−δ)/℘; and since corporate net worth increases faster than intermediary net
30:1128:80316:15:14:80:532:144:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:worth, the interest rate on intermediated finance rises in this phase.  As the corporate sector accumulates
30:1129:80423:14:14:80:532:130:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:net worth, it can pledge more and the equilibrium interest rate rises.  As the net worth and investment
30:1130:80526:14:15:80:532:116:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:of the corporate sector continues to rise faster than intermediary net worth, eventually the increase in
30:1131:80630:15:14:80:532:101:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:firms’ collateral means that firms’ ability to pledge no longer constrains their ability to raise intermediated
30:1132:80741:14:0:80:278:87:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:finance, at which point spreads start to drop.
31:1133:80789:0:17:98:533:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:A severe credit crunch magnifies all these effects, amplifying the downturn, making it
31:1134:80875:17:18:80:532:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more protracted, leading to longer stalls in the recovery, and raising spreads.  Investment
31:1135:80966:18:17:80:532:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:initially  drops  more,  and  then  recovers  more  slowly,  stalling  for  an  extend  period  of
31:1136:81064:17:17:80:532:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time  (time  7  through  16)  before  eventually  recovering  (see  Panel  B4).   The  spread  on
31:1137:81161:17:18:80:532:630:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intermediated finance shoots up on impact, because intermediated finance is limited not
31:1138:81248:18:17:80:532:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by  corporate  loan  demand  but  by  the  supply  of  intermediated  funds;18the  spread  is
31:1139:81341:17:17:80:532:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hence determined by the levered marginal product of capital, which is high because the
31:1140:81427:17:18:80:532:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:corporate sector is financially constrained.19As both sectors accumulate net worth, the
31:1141:81514:18:17:80:532:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spread comes down from its initial highs, but stalls once the corporate sector starts to
31:1142:81602:17:17:80:532:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pay  dividends.   Indeed,  the  spread  stays  at  this  elevated  level  while  the  intermediary
31:1143:81700:17:18:80:532:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sector reaccumulates net worth, and returns to its steady state level only later on (see
31:1144:81788:18:17:80:532:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Panel  B1).   Intermediary  lending  is  also  noteworthy,  as  it  remains  substantially  below
31:1145:81885:17:17:80:532:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  steady  state  level  for  an  extended  amount  of  time  (see  Panel  B3).   Finally,  note
31:1146:81983:17:18:80:532:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that  the  corporate  sector  temporarily  accumulates  more  net  worth  than  in  the  steady
31:1147:82078:18:17:80:532:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:state, a result of corporate deleveraging, as firms substitute internal funds for the lack of
31:1148:82171:17:38:80:267:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intermediated finance for some time.

31:1150:82258:25:18:80:532:376:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Suppose now that the economy is more bank dependent; specifically, consider an economy
31:1151:82344:18:17:80:532:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with a higher value ofθi.  Recall from Proposition 4 that this implies that the ratio of
31:1152:82432:17:17:80:532:341:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intermediary net worth to corporate net worth in the steady state is higher, that is, a larger
31:1153:82526:17:18:80:532:324:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fraction of investment is financed by intermediaries.  How does such a bank-dependent
31:1154:82611:18:17:80:532:306:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:economy respond to downturns with and without a credit crunch?  The dynamic response
31:1155:82695:17:17:80:532:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of such an economy is illustrated in Figure 7.  To facilitate the comparison, we keep all the
31:1156:82788:17:18:80:532:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parameters unchanged from the previous figures, except for two:  first, we raiseθifrom

31:1159:83042:17:18:80:532:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intermediary net worth is unchanged as well, facilitating the comparison.  We consider the
31:1160:83132:18:17:80:532:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:same three scenarios as in Figure 6, a downturn without a credit crunch (solid), as well as
31:1161:83223:17:17:80:532:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:downturns with a moderate and a severe credit crunch (dotted and dashed, respectively).
31:1162:83310:17:18:98:533:168:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Several  features  of  the  response  are  worth  noting:  First,  the  severity  of  the  credit
31:1163:83407:18:17:80:532:150:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:crunch itself has a more significant impact on the initial drop in investment (see Panel B4).
31:1164:83500:17:18:80:532:133:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Moreover, investment is more substantially reduced both early in the downturn and the
31:1165:83585:18:18:89:532:115:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:18Since intermediaries lend out their entire net worthwito the corporate sector, the law of motion of
31:1166:83686:18:9:80:211:97:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:investment isk= (w+wi)/℘.
31:1167:83711:9:0:89:532:88:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f14:F:19That is, the equilibrium interest rate on intermediated finance isR′i= [A′fk(k) + (1−θ)(1−δ)]/℘.
32:1168:83811:0:17:80:532:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:recovery stalls at a lower level of investment.  Further,  and perhaps most significantly,
32:1169:83901:17:18:80:532:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  downturn  is  also  more  protracted  with  investment  reduced,  intermediated  finance
32:1170:83994:18:17:80:532:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:depressed  (see  Panel  B3),  and  spreads  elevated  (see  Panel  B1)  for  longer.   The  effects
32:1171:84093:17:17:80:532:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on net worth of the two sectors are also magnified:  intermediary net worth takes a long
32:1172:84181:17:18:80:532:630:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time to recover and the corporate sector temporarily accumulates substantially more net
32:1173:84268:18:17:80:532:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:worth than it has in the steady state, again in an effort to substitute internal funding for
32:1174:84360:17:17:80:329:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the lack of intermediated finance (see Panel B2).
32:1175:84409:17:18:98:533:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our theory predicts that in a bank-dependent economy, downturns associated with a
32:1176:84490:18:17:80:532:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:credit crunch are more severe and more protracted, with slower net worth accumulation
32:1177:84575:17:17:80:532:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and longer stalls of the recovery at lower levels of investment.  Thus, the recovery from
32:1178:84664:17:18:80:532:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:crises in more bank-dependent economies such as Europe or Japan may be substantially
32:1179:84748:18:17:80:532:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:different from,  and more sluggish than,  that in less bank-dependent economies such as
32:1180:84835:17:38:80:321:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the U.S., where it may be typically more swift.

32:1182:84932:25:18:80:532:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The focus of our analysis thus far has been on the deterministic dynamics following unan-

32:1185:85198:17:18:80:532:376:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we can ask whether we should expect the corporate sector and the intermediary sector to
32:1186:85285:18:17:80:532:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be constrained at the same time, as arguably is the case in downturns associated with a
32:1187:85372:17:17:80:532:341:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:credit crunch in practice.  In other words, should we expect the net worth (or the marginal
32:1188:85463:17:18:80:380:324:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:value of net worth) of firms and intermediaries to comove?
32:1189:85521:18:17:98:533:306:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We consider this question in a stochastic economy which is deterministic from time 1
32:1190:85605:17:17:80:532:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:onward.  Importantly, this allows both firms and intermediaries to engage in risk man-

33:1204:86780:28:17:98:533:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Proposition  6  implies  that  the  marginal  values  of  firm  and  intermediary  net  worth
33:1205:86873:17:17:80:532:637:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:comove, for example, when the intermediary has very limited net worth and hence the
33:1206:86956:17:18:80:532:620:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:collateral constraints for intermediated finance are slack for all states.  They also comove
33:1207:87048:18:17:80:532:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:if the firm hedges one of two possible states, as then the intermediary effectively must be
33:1208:87139:17:17:80:532:585:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hedging that state, too.  Thus, the marginal value of intermediary net worth may be high
33:1209:87227:17:18:80:532:568:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:exactly when the marginal value of firm net worth is high, too.  The marginal values may
33:1210:87315:18:17:80:532:550:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:however  move  in  opposite  directions,  for  example,  if  a  high  realization  of  productivity
33:1211:87414:17:17:80:532:533:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:raises  firm  net  worth  substantially,  which  lowers  the  marginal  product  of  capital  and
33:1212:87511:17:18:80:532:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hence the marginal value of firm net worth, while it may raise loan demand substantially
33:1213:87599:18:17:80:397:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and hence raise the marginal value of intermediary net worth.
33:1214:87660:17:17:98:533:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Comovement between the value of corporate and intermediary net worth is thus plau-
33:1215:87742:17:18:80:532:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sible but not a foregone conclusion.  The nature of economic shocks affecting net worth
33:1216:87829:18:17:80:532:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:may also play a role.  Throughout we have considered stochastic total factor productivity,
33:1217:87919:17:17:80:532:429:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which  directly  affects  corporate  net  worth  only.   Alternatively,  one  could  easily  adapt
33:1218:88017:17:18:80:532:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the model to consider stochastic depreciation of capital, which would directly affect both
33:1219:88107:18:17:80:532:394:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:corporate and intermediary net worth; in fact, stochastic depreciation shocks would ar-
33:1220:88194:17:17:80:532:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:guably affect intermediary net worth relatively more, as the assets of intermediaries are
33:1221:88283:17:18:80:532:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:collateralized claims.  Depreciation shocks are one way to model shocks to the value of
33:1222:88370:18:17:80:532:342:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:collateral.  A shock to total factor productivity may then result in a downturn without
33:1223:88457:17:17:80:532:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a  credit  crunch,  whereas  a  depreciation  shock  to  the  value  of  capital  may  result  in  a
33:1224:88557:17:18:80:532:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:downturn associated with a credit crunch.  We leave an explicit analysis of a model with
33:1225:88645:18:44:80:449:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:both stochastic productivity and stochastic depreciation to future work.

33:1227:88763:29:17:80:532:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Our model provides guidance on the joint dynamics of the macro economy and the fi-
33:1228:88845:17:18:80:532:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nancial  sector.   We  use  the  model  and  the  analysis  of  the  net  worth  dynamics  in  the
33:1229:88943:18:17:80:532:182:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:previous section to revisit three main stylized facts about downturns associated with fi-
33:1230:89032:17:17:80:532:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nancial crises, namely their severity, their protractedness, and the relation between the
33:1231:89121:17:0:80:515:148:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:severity of the financial crisis itself and the severity and persistence of the downturn.
34:1232:89212:0:25:80:535:699:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:F:5.1    Fact 1: Severity of downturns associated with financial crises
34:1233:89281:25:17:80:532:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Prior empirical research shows that downturns associated with financial crises are more
34:1234:89368:17:18:80:532:657:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:severe.   Reinhart  and  Rogoff  (2014)  find  that  “the  average  peak-to-trough  decline  for
34:1235:89464:18:17:80:532:639:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  US  real  per  capita  GDP  across  nine  major  crises  is  about  9  percent.”   Similarly,
34:1236:89562:17:17:80:532:622:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:using panel data for a large set of countries, Cerra and Saxena (2008) find that “banking
34:1237:89651:17:18:80:532:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:crises  lead  to  severe  output  loss  [even  in  high-income  countries]”  (page  442).   Finally,
34:1238:89751:18:17:80:532:587:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Krishnamurthy and Muir (2016) conclude that “[o]ur results affirm  that financial crises
34:1239:89839:17:17:80:408:570:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:do result in deeper and more protracted recessions” (page 15).20
34:1240:89903:17:18:98:533:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Thus, the evidence shows a first stylized fact, namely that downturns associated with
34:1241:89988:18:17:80:532:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:financial  crises  are  more  severe  in  the  sense  that  output  losses  are  larger,  suggesting
34:1242:90088:17:17:80:532:518:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:amplification of macroeconomic shocks.  The evidence also shows that such downturns
34:1243:90171:17:18:80:532:501:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are  more  severe  in  the  sense  of  being  more  protracted,  but  while  these  two  notions  of
34:1244:90271:18:17:80:532:483:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:severity are often commingled in the literature, we treat their persistence as a separate
34:1245:90360:17:17:80:532:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stylized fact which we discuss in the next subsection.  Comparing the dynamics of our
34:1246:90445:17:18:80:532:449:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model  without  and  with  a  credit  crunch  in  Figures  4  and  6,  we  find  that  downturns
34:1247:90541:18:17:80:532:431:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:associated with a financial crisis are more severe, in the sense that output drops by more
34:1248:90631:17:17:80:532:414:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on impact and that output is lower at any fixed horizon.  That said, the initial effect of
34:1249:90721:17:18:80:532:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the credit crunch on output can be muted in the model if the drop in corporate net worth
34:1250:90809:18:17:80:532:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reduces loan demand so much that loan demand drops below (ex-dividend) intermediary
34:1251:90892:17:38:80:133:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:net worth.
34:1252:90902:38:25:80:425:324:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:5.2    Fact 2:  Slow recoveries after financial crises
34:1253:90956:25:18:80:532:299:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The evidence also shows that recoveries after financial crises are protracted.  Reinhart and
34:1254:91048:18:17:80:532:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Rogoff (2014) state that “a significant part of the costs of [systemic banking] crises lies in
34:1255:91142:17:17:80:532:264:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the protracted and halting nature of the recovery” (page 50).  Moreover, they argue that
34:1256:91230:17:19:80:532:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:”[t]he halting, tentative nature of the post-crisis recoveries (even in cases where there is a
34:1257:91324:19:18:89:532:228:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:20We recognize that the conclusions regarding these stylized facts in part turn on the assumptions made
34:1258:91427:18:14:80:532:210:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:for measurement, for example, the severity cutoff used in defining a crisis, the definition of a recovery
34:1259:91532:14:15:80:532:196:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:(return to the previous output level or trend), adjustment for population growth, the definition of the
34:1260:91635:15:14:80:532:181:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:start of the episode (previous output peak or start of the financial disruption), and finally whether the
34:1261:91740:14:14:80:532:167:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:data includes emerging economies and pre-war episodes.  Indeed, some recent studies provide a contrarian
34:1262:91844:14:15:80:532:153:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:view.  For example, Bordo and Haubrich (2012) find “generally . . . rapid recoveries” with the exception of
34:1263:91951:15:14:80:532:138:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:the 1930s, 1990s, and the present recovery.  Similarly, Romer and Romer (2015) find that “output declines
34:1264:92056:14:14:80:532:124:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:following financial crises in modern advanced countries are highly variable, on average only moderate,
34:1265:92158:14:15:80:532:110:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:and often temporary,” (abstract) using a new, qualitative measure of financial distress with a relatively
34:1266:92263:15:14:80:532:95:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:fine scale, thus, challenging the conventional wisdom that “the aftermath of financial crises is typically
34:1267:92369:14:0:80:487:81:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:severe and long-lasting” (page 1).  We match the stylized facts that are the mainstream view.
35:1268:92464:0:17:80:532:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sharp—but not sustained—growth rebound) is evidenced in the relatively high incidence
35:1269:92549:17:18:80:532:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of double dips (or secondary downturns before the previous peak is reached)” (page 52).
35:1270:92636:18:17:80:532:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:They  find  that  “[o]n  average  it  takes  about  eight  years  to  reach  the  pre-crisis  level  of
35:1271:92739:17:17:80:532:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:income,” with a median time of about 6.5 years, and that about 45% of the 100 crises
35:1272:92823:17:18:80:532:630:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:they study are associated with a double dip, and about two-thirds of the most severe crises
35:1273:92914:18:17:80:532:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:involve double-dips.  Cerra and Saxena (2008) find “that the large output loss associated
35:1274:93003:17:17:80:532:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with financial crises ... is highly persistent” (page 456); specifically, they show that the
35:1275:93095:17:18:80:532:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:output loss on impact of a banking crisis is about 7.5 percent and the output loss at a
35:1276:93182:18:17:80:423:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ten-year horizon exceeds 6 percent, that is, is extremely persistent.
35:1277:93251:17:17:98:533:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our second stylized fact is therefore the persistence of downturns associated with fi-
35:1278:93337:17:18:80:532:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nancial crises; recoveries are slow and frequently stall, at least temporarily.  The dynamics
35:1279:93430:18:17:80:532:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of our model in Figure 5 highlight the protractedness of a credit crunch:  the recovery
35:1280:93517:17:17:80:532:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of output after a credit crunch is slower than after a regular downturn (compare to Fig-
35:1281:93605:17:18:80:532:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ure 4).  In addition, spreads remain elevated for an extended period of time.  This is due
35:1282:93695:18:17:80:429:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to the relative sluggishness of intermediary net worth accumulation.
35:1283:93763:17:17:98:533:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Moreover, when both corporate and intermediary net worth drop at the same time,
35:1284:93842:17:18:80:532:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that is,  in a downturn associated with a credit crunch,  downturns are more prolonged
35:1285:93928:18:17:80:532:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(see  Figure  6)  and  the  recovery  can  stall,  potentially  for  an  extended  period  of  time,
35:1286:94028:17:17:80:532:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:due to the joint dynamics of corporate and intermediary net worth; note that such stalls
35:1287:94116:17:18:80:532:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:can occur even in cases in which the initial rebound of output is quite brisk, consistent
35:1288:94205:18:17:80:532:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with the data.  The model therefore captures what Reinhart and Rogoff call the “halting,
35:1289:94293:17:17:80:532:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tentative nature” of such recoveries.  We are not aware of other models that predict such
35:1290:94382:17:39:80:297:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stalls in the economic recovery post crises.
35:1291:94426:39:25:80:426:279:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:5.3    Fact 3:  Impact of severity of financial crises
35:1292:94480:25:17:80:532:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Further,  the  evidence  suggests  that  how  severe  the  financial  crises  per  se  is  plays  an
35:1293:94580:17:17:80:532:237:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:important role.  Romer and Romer (2015) find that “one factor that appears to be im-
35:1294:94664:17:18:80:532:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:portant to the variation [in the aftermath of crises] is the severity and persistence of the
35:1295:94756:18:17:80:532:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:crisis itself” (page 41).  For example, “Japan’s dismal economic performance ...  [may be]
35:1296:94846:17:17:80:532:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:related to the fact that the distress was particularly severe and long-lasting” (page 38),
35:1297:94936:17:18:80:532:168:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and for the 2008 Crisis they argue that “the extreme nature of the recent distress is one
35:1298:95025:18:17:80:532:150:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:likely reason for the severe and continuing economic weakness” (page 41-42).  In a similar
35:1299:95115:17:17:80:532:133:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spirit, Krishnamurthy and Muir (2016) measure the severity of a crisis using the spread
35:1300:95202:17:18:80:532:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:between high-yield and low-yield bonds, and conclude that “recessions in the aftermath
35:1301:95288:18:17:80:532:98:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of financial crises are severe and protracted” and that furthermore “the severity of the
35:1302:95376:17:0:80:503:81:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:subsequent crisis can be forecast by the size of [changes in the spread]” (abstract).
36:1303:95463:0:17:98:533:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Thus, the third stylized fact is that the severity of the financial crises itself in turn
36:1304:95552:17:18:80:532:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:affects  both  the  severity  and  protractedness  of  the  downturn;  in  other  words,  Fact  1
36:1305:95649:18:17:80:532:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(“severity”) and Fact 2 (“protractedness”) are a matter of degree.  Our model captures
36:1306:95735:17:17:80:532:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this fact as demonstrated in Figure 6: the more severe the drop in intermediary net worth,
36:1307:95825:17:18:80:532:630:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the larger the drop in output and the more protracted the recovery;  indeed,  recoveries
36:1308:95913:18:17:80:532:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from severe financial crises are more protracted in the sense that (i) the initial recovery
36:1309:96004:17:17:80:532:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is slower, (ii) the recovery stalls for longer, and (iii) the economy takes longer to recover
36:1310:96097:17:18:80:105:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fully.
36:1311:96103:18:17:98:533:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The dynamics of spreads also have empirically plausible features:  spreads “blow out”
36:1312:96188:17:17:80:532:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:when the financial crisis is more severe, recover relatively quickly initially, but then re-
36:1313:96280:17:18:80:532:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:main  elevated  and  recover  fully  only  after  an  extended  period  of  time.   For  spreads,
36:1314:96377:18:17:80:532:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Krishnamurthy and Muir (2016) find that “the start of a crisis is associated with a spike
36:1315:96466:17:17:80:532:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in  spreads”  and  “a  spike  in  spreads  shifts  down  the  conditional  distribution  of  output
36:1316:96565:17:18:80:532:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:growth,  fattening the lower tail” (page 17).  Our model captures these observations in
36:1317:96652:18:17:80:532:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:two ways:  first, more severe downturns are associated with higher spreads, and, second,
36:1318:96740:17:17:80:343:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spreads spike at the beginning of very severe crises.
36:1319:96793:17:18:98:533:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The measurement in the aforementioned studies is predicated on the assumption that
36:1320:96875:18:17:80:532:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:there are two separate driving forces, one for downturns and one for financial crises.  Con-
36:1321:96967:17:17:80:532:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sidering the effects of a credit crunch or financial crisis on aggregate dynamics implicitly
36:1322:97059:17:18:80:532:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assumes that the financial disruption is a separate, exogenous force, rather than simply
36:1323:97147:18:17:80:532:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an endogenous reflection of a single aggregate source of fluctuations.  Understanding these
36:1324:97238:17:17:80:532:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:facts therefore calls for a model with two state variables, one for the corporate sector and
36:1325:97330:17:45:80:469:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:one for financial intermediaries, which is the type of model that we provide.
36:1326:97407:45:29:80:202:273:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:6    Conclusion
36:1327:97422:29:17:80:532:244:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We develop a dynamic theory of financial intermediation and show that the capital of
36:1328:97506:17:18:80:532:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:both the financial intermediary and corporate sector affect real economic activity, such
36:1329:97594:18:17:80:532:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as firm investment, financing, and the spread between intermediated and direct finance.
36:1330:97681:17:17:80:532:192:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We derive collateral constraints from an explicit model of limited enforcement in which
36:1331:97768:17:18:80:532:175:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:financial intermediaries have a collateralization advantage due to limited participation by
36:1332:97859:18:17:80:532:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:households.  Financial intermediaries participate in markets at all times allowing them to
36:1333:97949:17:17:80:532:140:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:enforce claims when more of the capital is collateralizable.  This advantage in enforcement
36:1334:98040:17:18:80:532:123:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:enables financial intermediaries to lend more than households, but they cannot in turn
36:1335:98126:18:17:80:532:105:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:finance such loans by borrowing from households and hence have to finance these loans
36:1336:98211:17:0:80:532:88:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:out of their own net worth; we argue that this is why financial intermediaries need capital.
37:1337:98305:0:17:80:532:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In our view, the enforcement of payment is a key rationale for the existence of financial
37:1338:98394:17:18:80:532:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intermediaries, in addition to the monitoring and liquidity provision motives emphasized
37:1339:98482:18:17:80:211:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the previous literature.
37:1340:98509:17:17:98:533:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The  determinants  of  capital  structure  of  firms  and  intermediaries  in  the  model  are
37:1341:98603:17:18:80:532:630:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:distinct.  Firms’ capital structure is determined by the extent to which firms can pledge
37:1342:98692:18:17:80:532:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their  tangible  assets  required  for  production  as  collateral  to  intermediaries  and  house-
37:1343:98791:17:17:80:532:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:holds.  In contrast, intermediaries’ capital structure is determined by the extent to which
37:1344:98882:17:18:80:532:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their collateralized loans can be collateralized themselves, that is, by the difference be-
37:1345:98973:18:17:80:532:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tween the intermediaries’ and households’ ability to collateralize claims.  In other words,
37:1346:99064:17:17:80:532:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms issue promises against tangible assets whereas intermediaries issue promises against
37:1347:99154:17:18:80:532:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:collateralized claims, which are in turn backed by tangible assets.  Thus, given these dis-
37:1348:99245:18:17:80:532:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tinct determinants, firm leverage may be substantially lower than intermediary leverage
37:1349:99332:17:17:80:208:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as is the case in practice.
37:1350:99359:17:18:98:533:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Central  to  the  aggregate  implications  is  the  fact  that  our  model  features  two  state
37:1351:99455:18:17:80:532:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variables, the net worth of the corporate and intermediary sector.  It is the joint dynamics
37:1352:99547:17:17:80:532:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  these  two  state  variables  that  result  in  the  compelling  dynamics  of  the  model.   In
37:1353:99646:17:18:80:532:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:downturns associated with a credit crunch, while the initial recovery can be quite brisk,
37:1354:99735:18:17:80:532:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the recovery can stall as the intermediary sector is more slow to recover; thus, investment
37:1355:99826:17:17:80:532:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and macroeconomic activity may remain depressed, and spreads elevated, potentially for
37:1356:99912:17:18:80:532:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a  prolonged  period  of  time,  even  if  the  corporate  sector  seems  to  have  recovered  and
37:1357:100010:18:17:80:532:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pays dividends.  In a downturn without a credit crunch, corporate loan demand falls, and
37:1358:100098:17:17:80:532:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intermediaries  may  hold  cash  to  meet  future  corporate  loan  demand  and  thus  spreads
37:1359:100192:17:18:80:532:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:may  initially  be  very  low.   A  key  factor  driving  these  results  is  that  intermediary  net
37:1360:100293:18:17:80:445:300:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:worth accumulates more slowly than corporate net worth in the model.
37:1361:100361:17:17:98:533:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our model is consistent with three key stylized facts about macroeconomic downturns
37:1362:100444:17:18:80:532:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:associated with a credit crunch, namely, their severity, their protractedness, and the fact
37:1363:100535:18:17:80:532:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that the severity of the credit crunch itself in turn affects the severity and the persistence
37:1364:100629:17:17:80:532:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  the  downturn.   Most  uniquely,  our  model  captures  the  tentative  and  halting  nature
37:1365:100725:17:18:80:532:214:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of recoveries from such episodes, a fact emphasized by Reinhart and Rogoff (2014).  Our
37:1366:100812:18:17:80:532:196:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model provides a useful framework for the analysis of the dynamic interaction between
37:1367:100897:17:0:80:291:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:financial structure and economic activity.
38:1368:100941:0:26:80:532:699:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:F:Appendix A: Equivalence of limited enforcement and
38:1369:100991:26:29:80:256:673:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:collateral constraints
38:1370:101013:29:18:80:532:644:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We start by stating the representative firm’s and the representative intermediary’s prob-

38:1372:101192:17:17:80:532:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we first develop some notation for states and the stochastic process for productivity, as
38:1373:101281:17:18:80:532:592:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:well  as  state  prices,  stochastic  discount  factors,  and  state-dependent  interest  rates  for
38:1374:101381:18:17:80:269:574:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:both the morning and the afternoon.

38:1379:101756:17:18:80:465:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:subperiods, morning and afternoon, and states are realized in the morning.
38:1380:101830:18:17:98:533:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Each  afternoon  there  are  markets  in  Arrow  securities  for  all  subsequent  mornings
38:1381:101921:17:17:80:532:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  afternoons.   We  define  the  (endogenous)  state  prices  in  these  markets  as  follows:
38:1382:102018:17:18:80:532:436:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:B:Qmτt≡Qm(sτ,st)  is  the  price  in  the  afternoon  in  statesτof  one  unit  of  goods  in  the

38:1386:102368:18:17:80:532:366:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is, the price of a unit of goods in the afternoon today is just one unit.  We also define
38:1387:102457:17:29:80:452:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stochastic discount factorsqmτt≡qm(sτ,st) andqaτt≡qa(sτ,st) as follows:

38:1390:102583:29:17:80:533:270:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:Moreover, we define state-dependent interest ratesRmt+1≡Rm(st,st+1)≡(qm(st,st+1))−1

42:1602:109232:18:17:98:533:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Suppose now that the present value collateral constraint (A.16) holds in the afternoon

42:1609:109669:29:17:80:532:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Hence, the firm could pay the present value of its current promises and make the same

42:1618:110173:28:18:80:532:95:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Thus,  a  feasible  strategy  without  default  yields  a  weakly  higher  payoff,  implying  that

43:1620:110299:0:17:98:533:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Next we show that if the present value collateral constraint (A.15) does not hold in

43:1625:110698:28:29:80:407:590:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Since the present value collateral constraint is violated, we have

43:1632:111085:17:17:98:533:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The  proof  that  the  present  value  collateral  constraint  in  the  morning  implies  the

43:1634:111273:18:17:80:227:388:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:closely and is hence omitted.
43:1635:111302:17:17:98:533:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Next we turn to the intermediary’s problem.  Since the intermediary receives a non-
43:1636:111385:17:18:80:532:354:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:negative payment in the morning, intermediary default is a concern only in the afternoon.
43:1637:111474:18:28:80:532:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Suppose that the present value collateral constraint (A.17) at dateτis violated, that is,
43:1638:111563:28:29:153:459:308:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:phτ+  ̄paτ+ PVτ(phτ+1) + PVmτ( ̄pmτ+1) + PVaτ( ̄paτ+1)<0.
43:1639:111620:29:29:80:494:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f7:B:The intermediary could default with  ˆwiτ=   ̄pmτand issue new promises at dateτ
43:1640:111700:29:29:142:472:250:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:ˆphτ=−PVτ(phτ+1)    andˆ ̄paτ=−PVmτ( ̄pmτ+1)−PVaτ( ̄paτ+1)
43:1641:111758:29:17:80:532:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:while keeping the promises and dividends in all future dates and states the same.  Hence,
43:1642:111847:17:25:81:405:204:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ˆphτ+ˆ ̄paτ> phτ+  ̄paτand the dividend at dateτis higher since
43:1643:111910:25:32:182:412:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f7:?:ˆdiτ=wiτ+ ˆphτ+ˆ ̄paτ> wiτ+phτ+  ̄paτ=diτ,
43:1644:111952:32:18:80:452:147:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:implying that the limited enforcement constraint would be violated, too.
43:1645:112024:18:17:98:533:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To see that (A.17) implies (A.13) proceed analogously to the proof for the firm by

43:1647:112191:17:0:80:258:95:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f22:B:least as well without defaulting.2
44:1648:112227:0:17:98:533:699:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Before proceeding, we define a notion of consistency of state prices.  Essentially, the

44:1657:112779:26:27:80:523:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:State prices in an equilibrium in the economy with limited enforcement are consistent.

44:1660:112972:27:17:80:533:441:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:B:Proof  of  Lemma  A.1.Consider  first  consistency  of  state  prices  for  afternoon  pay-
44:1661:113063:17:17:80:532:424:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ments.  Suppose consistency is violated at timeτfor statesτ+2and assume w.l.o.g.  that
44:1662:113149:17:18:80:532:407:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:B:Qa(sτ,sτ+2)> Qa(sτ,sτ+1)Qa(sτ+1,sτ+2).The intermediary could issue a claim against
44:1663:113231:18:17:80:533:389:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:statesτ+2and receiveQa(sτ,sτ+2) at timeτand at the same time purchaseQa(sτ+1,sτ+2)
44:1664:113313:17:17:80:532:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:units of statesτ+1claims at a per unit cost ofQa(sτ,sτ+1),  yielding a positive payout
44:1665:113399:17:18:80:533:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:today.  In statesτ+1,  the promise the intermediary issued will be worthQa(sτ+1,sτ+2)
44:1666:113484:18:17:80:532:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which equals the payoff of the one-period claim.  Thus the intermediary can repurchase
44:1667:113570:17:17:80:532:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the claim at that time, yielding a zero payout then.  Note that the payoff to the inter-

44:1669:113744:18:17:80:532:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:implying that the present value collateral constraint is satisfied throughout.  This is an
44:1670:113834:17:17:80:533:268:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:arbitrage  and  hence  afternoon  state  prices  have  to  be  consistent  for  timeτ+ 2,  and,
44:1671:113929:17:18:80:284:251:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:proceeding recursively, for allt≥τ+ 2.
44:1672:113967:18:17:98:533:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To  prove  the  consistency  claim  for  morning  state  prices,  we  have  to  maintain  the

44:1678:114486:18:17:80:532:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:off of the one-period claims bought.  Thus the firm can repurchase the claim at that time,
44:1679:114576:17:17:80:532:112:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:yielding a zero payout then.  Note that the payoff to the firm is positive at timeτ, that

45:1683:114934:17:18:80:532:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:against statesτ+2in the morning and proceed analogously to the firm above, reversing

45:1685:115121:17:17:80:532:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:morning state prices have to be consistent for timeτ+ 2, and, proceeding recursively, for

45:1695:115882:17:17:80:532:443:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Therefore,Ra(sτ,sτ+1)≤Rfor  all  (sτ,sτ+1).   Moreover,  ifRa(sτ,sτ+1)< Rfor  some

45:1697:116053:18:17:80:532:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the interest rate on one-period ahead afternoon claims equalsRin all dates and states.

45:1701:116316:17:26:80:476:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in a state-dependent way.  Using Lemmas A.1 and A.2 recursively then yields

45:1709:116919:17:17:80:532:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:morning claims is used only once.  The interest rates for one-period ahead morning claims

52:1950:130973:17:17:98:533:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We now show that the above policies are optimal for both the firm and the interme-

66:2509:155602:17:17:80:532:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We emphasize that the intermediary’s limited enforcement constraint in the morning is

67:2528:156620:28:17:80:532:566:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The intermediary can borrow from the household only against claims it has on the firm.
67:2529:156706:17:18:98:533:549:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Next we show that the interest rate on intermediated loans repaid in the afternoon

67:2533:157046:18:17:80:532:479:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spread.  Moreover, since the intermediary can always lend atRto the household, loans
67:2534:157130:17:27:80:307:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f7:B:repaid in the morning must yield at leastR.

68:2556:158589:41:18:98:533:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We can now show that the firm’s limited enforcement constraints are equivalent to

68:2560:158749:22:17:80:532:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We need to show that (C.19) and (C.20) are equivalent to (C.16) and (C.17).  First, note
68:2561:158837:17:18:80:532:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that (C.20) and (C.17) are identical. Second, observe that adding (C.19) and (C.20) yields
68:2562:158927:18:17:80:532:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(C.16) which establishes the first direction.  To establish the other direction, suppose that
68:2563:159020:17:17:80:532:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(C.19) does not hold, i.e., (θi−θ)k(1−δ)< p′m.  Then (C.20) must be slack as otherwise
68:2564:159106:17:18:80:532:545:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f7:B:adding (C.19) and (C.20) would imply that (C.16) is violated.  Thus,θk(1−δ)> p′+p′a.

69:2612:162108:18:17:80:532:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:implies that the intermediary can borrow from the household up to the amount that the

69:2616:162364:25:17:80:532:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The equilibrium spread on intermediated finance depends on both firm and intermedi-
69:2617:162447:17:18:80:532:214:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ary net worth.  Given firm net worth, spreads are higher when the intermediary is less
69:2618:162533:18:17:80:532:196:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:well capitalized.  Importantly, the spread on intermediated finance depends on the rela-
69:2619:162621:17:17:80:532:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tive capitalization of firms and intermediaries.  Spreads are particularly high when firms
69:2620:162711:17:18:80:532:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are  poorly  capitalized  and  intermediaries  are  relatively  poorly  capitalized  at  the  same
69:2621:162809:18:17:80:532:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time.  Poor capitalization of the corporate sector does not per se imply high spreads, as
69:2622:162898:17:17:80:532:127:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms’  limited  ability  to  pledge  may  result  in  a  reduction  in  firms’  loan  demand  which
69:2623:162998:17:17:80:431:110:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:intermediaries with given net worth can more easily accommodate.22
