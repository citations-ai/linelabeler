2:20:741:31:21:71:539:599:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This paper takes a novel approach to trying to disentangle the impact of globalization on wages by
2:21:839:21:22:71:539:578:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:focusing on changes in the return to speaking English, the international language of commerce, in
2:22:936:22:26:71:539:556:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:South Africa as that country re-integrated with the global economy after 1993.  The paper finds that
2:23:1036:26:27:71:536:530:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the return to speaking English increased overall and that within racial groups the return increased

3:35:1421:61:27:71:160:604:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:1. Introduction.
3:36:1437:27:20:71:539:577:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:The literature on globalization and wages is, by the standards of economics, huge. It is a literature
3:37:1538:20:20:71:539:557:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:that compensates for its volume by offering precious little in the way of convincing results.  This
3:38:1637:20:20:71:539:537:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:is not (usually) the fault of the researchers.  Rather, it is just very difficult to identify the role of
3:39:1742:20:19:71:539:517:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:international trade and/or investment on wages relative to the multitude of other factors that
3:40:1836:19:20:71:539:498:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:influence wages  (and which frequently  occur  simultaneously  with globalization.)   This has led
3:41:1934:20:20:71:539:478:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:researchers to debate, for example, whether trade explains a growing wage gap between high wage
3:42:2029:20:20:71:539:458:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:and low wage earners or whether the real determinant of increasing wage disparity is coincident skill-
3:43:2131:20:19:71:539:438:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:biased technical change. Yet others (correctly) claim that even this dichotomy is a false one since
3:44:2230:19:21:71:539:419:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:international trade and investment and skill-biased technical change are themselves co-determined.
3:45:2328:21:19:88:540:398:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:With this cacophony as background, this paper steps back and experiments with a very different
3:46:2422:19:20:71:539:379:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:approach to investigating the impact of globalization on wages.  Noting the special circumstances
3:47:2519:20:20:71:539:359:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:around South Africa’s emergence from the Apartheid era (and the relatively closed economy that
3:48:2613:20:20:71:539:339:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:accompanied the Apartheid era), this paper asks whether the return to speaking English (measured
3:49:2709:20:20:71:539:319:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:in a narrow way) increased as the South African economy embarked upon its integration with the
3:50:2803:20:20:71:221:299:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:rest of the industrialized world.
3:51:2836:20:19:88:540:279:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:There is a certain logic to trying to measure the impact of globalization on wages in this manner.
3:52:2934:19:20:71:539:260:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:Following the advent of democracy in South Africa in 1994, there were several huge changes in the
3:53:3031:20:20:71:539:240:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:economy, many of which might be expected to change wages. One, but only one, of these changes
3:54:3124:20:20:71:539:220:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:was South Africa’s re-integration with the global economy.  Others included legislated changes in
3:55:3221:20:20:71:539:200:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:the labor market (with an emphasis on affirmative action) and the outbreak of the HIV/AIDS
3:56:3311:20:19:71:539:180:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:pandemic. Decomposing the changes in South African wages into those fractions due to increased
3:57:3405:19:20:71:539:161:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:disease, the dismantling of Apartheid and ensuing affirmative action, changes in technology during
3:58:3503:20:32:71:539:141:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:the 1990’s, and increased integration into the global economy is a Herculean (or outright impossible)
3:59:3604:32:10:92:539:109:76:g_d0_f6:76:g_d0_f6:I would like to thank without implicating Raquel Fernandez, Ann Harrison, Mark Rosenzweig, and Duncan
3:60:3705:10:10:71:539:99:76:g_d0_f6:76:g_d0_f6:Thomas as well as participants at the NBER’s conference on globalization and poverty. Thanks to Nzinga Broussard
3:61:3817:10:0:71:163:89:76:g_d0_f6:76:g_d0_f6:for research assistance.
4:62:3842:0:20:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:task. Measuring changes in the return to speaking English is a simple task and I argue below that
4:63:3939:20:20:72:540:689:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:it is one that at least stands a chance of shedding light on the impact of globalization on wages in
4:64:4039:20:19:72:136:669:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:South Africa.
4:65:4052:19:20:88:540:650:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:The underlying idea is that as South Africa re-integrated with the rest of the world, the return to
4:66:4151:20:19:72:540:630:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:speaking an international language of commerce might plausibly increase. In South Africa, English
4:67:4248:19:20:72:540:611:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:is that language.  (The other widely spoken languages such as Zulu and Afrikaans are not used
4:68:4341:20:19:72:540:591:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:much in international commerce.) It is less obvious why some of the other changes concurrent with
4:69:4438:19:20:72:540:572:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:the fall of Apartheid should change the return to speaking English. It is, for example, unclear why
4:70:4537:20:19:72:540:552:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:AIDS should have much of an impact on the returns to speaking English (although it almost surely
4:71:4633:19:20:72:540:533:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:impacts wages.)1Nor is it clear why the sort of skill-biased technological change that occurred
4:72:4728:20:20:71:539:513:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:world-wide in the 1990s ought to impact returns to speaking English. Skill-biased technical change
4:73:4826:20:19:71:539:493:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:probably changes the returns to different levels of education but, conditional on education, it is
4:74:4924:19:20:71:539:474:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:hard to see why this sort of technical change would elevate the returns to speaking English.  It
4:75:5020:20:19:71:539:454:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:is easier to suspect that affirmative action might impact the return to speaking English.  This is
4:76:5118:19:20:71:539:435:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:a confounding influence that is explicitly discussed when presenting econometric specification and
4:77:5216:20:19:71:193:415:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:when interpreting results.
4:78:5242:19:20:88:540:396:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:When substantial parts of the world did not openly trade with or invest in South Africa, there
4:79:5336:20:19:71:539:376:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:was still a return to speaking English.  South Africa, after all, was not Albania.  There remained
4:80:5434:19:20:71:539:357:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:some international trade, the mining industry produced traded goods, and there was some, albeit
4:81:5529:20:19:71:539:337:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:minimal, international investment in South Africa. Each of these might support a return to speaking
4:82:5628:19:20:71:539:318:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:English. Furthermore, speaking English was probably coincident with other factors that impacted
4:83:5723:20:20:71:539:298:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:wages given South Africa’s history (see The Boer War.)   For these reasons, this paper focuses
4:84:5817:20:19:71:540:278:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:whether that return to speaking Englishchanged.  Of course, if there is no return to speaking
4:85:5910:19:20:71:506:259:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:English in the first place, searching for changes in that return is not especially informative.
4:86:6005:20:19:88:540:239:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:This approach to investigating the impact of globalization on wages is intended as a complement
4:87:6100:19:20:71:539:220:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:to the way economists usually address this question.  My aims are pretty modest.  This approach
4:88:6195:20:19:71:539:200:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:will not offer the definitive word on the impact of globalization on wages in post-Apartheid South
4:89:6293:19:20:71:539:181:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:Africa. Put another way, hard to imagine evidence on language as being dispositive. Nonetheless,
4:90:6389:20:19:71:539:161:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:when the cultural situation is appropriate, this approach might usefully add to the trade and wages
4:91:6488:19:20:71:539:142:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:debate (a.k.a. ”cacophony.”). Furthermore, this approach uses the sort of survey data that has for
4:92:6586:20:20:71:364:122:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:the most part been ignored in the trade and wages literature.
4:93:6647:20:14:78:540:102:58:g_d0_f7:76:g_d0_f6:1One can of course concoct stories,  some of them plausible,  but few involve as direct a link between global
4:94:6756:14:0:71:387:88:76:g_d0_f6:76:g_d0_f6:integration and wages as that associated with the returns to speaking English
5:95:6834:0:20:88:540:709:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:This paper is not the first to examine economic implications of speaking English.  One paper
5:96:6926:20:20:71:539:689:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:even does so in the context of considering globalization. Munshi and Rosenzweig (2003) use Indian
5:97:7023:20:20:71:539:669:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:data to show that lower caste families are increasingly sending their female children to English
5:98:7119:20:19:71:539:649:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:schools and this has encouraging implications for occupational outcomes. Most of the literature on
5:99:7217:19:20:71:539:630:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:the returns to speaking English uses U.S. data and focuses on the role of language on immigrant
5:100:7312:20:19:71:539:610:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:earnings.  See, for example, Bleakley (2003), Bleakley and Chin (2004), and the literature cited
5:101:7408:19:20:71:422:591:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:therein. A paper in this vein using U.K. data is Shields and Price (2002).
5:102:7482:20:20:88:540:571:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:The paper proceeds in Section 2 by first describing some of the changes in openness in South
5:103:7574:20:19:71:539:551:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:Africa since the fall of Apartheid. Section 3 introduces the data that are used and provides some
5:104:7671:19:20:71:539:532:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:descriptive statistics. Section 4 estimates changes in the return to speaking English, while Section
5:105:7771:20:33:71:129:512:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:5 concludes.
5:106:7783:33:27:71:152:479:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:2. Background
5:107:7796:27:19:71:539:452:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:In 1993, the first year of my data, South Africa was preparing for its first nationally representative
5:108:7898:19:20:71:539:433:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:election in decades. It was clear to all that a new government would be taking power in 1994. There
5:109:7997:20:20:71:539:413:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:was, though, considerable uncertainty regarding just what economic policies would be pursued by
5:110:8092:20:19:71:539:393:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:President Nelson Mandela.  There were competing pressures to assure the international financial
5:111:8187:19:20:71:539:374:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:community of continued stability on the one hand, and to dramatically improve the lot of those
5:112:8281:20:20:71:539:354:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:who had for decades been excluded under the policies of the previous governments (and who were
5:113:8375:20:19:71:432:334:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:principally responsible for electing the new government) on the other hand.
5:114:8450:19:20:88:540:315:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:South Africa quickly implemented a policy of macroeconomic stabilization to reassure the in-
5:115:8542:20:20:71:539:295:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:ternational financial community. Called GEAR for Growth, Employment, and Redistribution, the
5:116:8634:20:19:71:539:275:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:policy seemed to contribute to stabilization of key macro indicators such as inflation, real interest
5:117:8735:19:20:71:539:256:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:rates, and the budget deficit. It is less obvious that the policy enhanced growth, employment, and
5:118:8833:20:20:71:539:236:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:redistribution, but this of course depends on the counter-factual.  Each component of the GEAR
5:119:8927:20:19:71:411:216:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:moniker might have been that much worse in the absence of the policy.
5:120:8996:19:20:88:540:197:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:Encouraged by the sober fiscal policies of GEAR, companies from around the world that had
5:121:9085:20:20:71:539:177:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:hesitated before investing substantially in South Africa began to get off the sidelines. Foreign direct
5:122:9188:20:19:71:530:157:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:investment skyrocketed. Table 1 presents data for foreign direct investment in millions of Rand.
5:123:9284:19:20:88:540:138:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:The data in Table 1 show that annual FDI inflows went from only 33 million Rand to over
5:124:9371:20:20:71:539:118:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:1.3 billion as soon as the new government was ensconced and proceeded to increase to over  6
5:125:9463:20:19:71:539:98:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:billion Rand by 2000.  The huge inflow for the first half of 2001 is not typical and represents the
5:126:9562:19:0:71:539:79:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:one-off purchase of De Beers by the London-listed Anglo American Corporation.  Even excluding
6:127:9656:0:20:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:that transaction, 2001 showed continued healthy increases in FDI inflows. According to the South
6:128:9752:20:19:72:540:689:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:African Reserve Bank, FDI was split pretty evenly between mining, manufacturing, and the financial
6:129:9850:19:20:72:103:670:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:sector.
6:130:9857:20:19:88:540:650:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:South Africa also joined the WTO on January 1, 1995. Tariffs, never that high anyway, fell into
6:131:9952:19:20:72:540:631:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:the single digit range.  The largest barrier to trade during the Apartheid era, though, was never
6:132:10049:20:19:72:540:611:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:tariffs.  Rather, it was the willingness of the rest of the world to trade with South Africa.  Under
6:133:10149:19:20:72:540:592:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:the new government, South Africa entered into regional free trading agreements with the European
6:134:10245:20:19:72:540:572:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:Union and with the Southern African Development Community.  Trade, as a percentage of GDP,
6:135:10335:19:20:72:540:553:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:increased substantially.  Table 2 presents these figures. From 1991 to 1993, a period during which
6:136:10433:20:19:72:540:533:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:it became pretty clear that Apartheid was going to be replaced with a representative democracy,
6:137:10528:19:20:72:540:514:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:trade to GDP was pretty flat. It was with the new government in 1994 that trade as a fraction of
6:138:10624:20:19:72:540:494:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:GDP started to really increase. By 2000, the last year of my survey data, trade to GDP had risen
6:139:10720:19:20:72:540:475:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:almost 50 percent from .424 to .611. The ratio continued to rise and was .704 in 2002. By almost
6:140:10816:20:19:72:540:455:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:any standard, these are meteoric increases. Mirrored by the even greater increases in foreign direct
6:141:10916:19:20:72:540:436:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:investment, there is little doubt that the South African economy “globalized.” South Africa clearly
6:142:11015:20:19:72:540:416:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:became more integrated with the global economy after 1993. I turn now to the question of whether
6:143:11111:19:32:72:412:397:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:the return to speaking English increased over the course of this period.
6:144:11183:32:25:72:115:365:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:3. Data
6:145:11190:25:20:72:540:340:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:This study uses data drawn from three South African household surveys-one from 1993 and two
6:146:11281:20:19:72:539:320:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:from 2000.  The 1993 data are from the LSMS household survey conducted by The World Bank.
6:147:11370:19:20:72:540:301:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:This survey included about 44,000 individuals comprising just over 8800 households.2The version
6:148:11465:20:19:71:540:281:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:of the data often used by researchers contains about 300 variables.3Information on language and
6:149:11560:19:20:71:539:262:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:income are key variables for the study at hand.  The data on language are not ideal due to the
6:150:11654:20:19:71:539:242:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:way that the survey instrument was worded.  In particular, language is a household-level variable
6:151:11751:19:20:71:539:223:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:and the head of the household was asked to identify the ”main language spoken at home.”The fact
6:152:11846:20:19:71:539:203:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:that language is a household-level variable is not of particular concern, since the language spoken
6:153:11945:19:20:71:539:184:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:at home typically does not vary within the household.  The fact that there is no information on
6:154:12040:20:19:71:539:164:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:whether a person could speak English instead of whether it is the main language spoken at home is
6:155:12137:19:14:78:540:145:58:g_d0_f7:76:g_d0_f6:2A cleaned and ready-to-use version of the data set, along with a primer to analyzing household survey data in
6:156:12247:14:19:71:428:131:76:g_d0_f6:76:g_d0_f6:STATA and the survey instruments are available at http://saproject.psc.isr.umich.edu/.
6:157:12333:19:14:78:539:112:58:g_d0_f7:76:g_d0_f6:3The original data set includes over 2000 variables although many of these are essentially individual-level variables
6:158:12450:14:10:71:539:98:76:g_d0_f6:76:g_d0_f6:that are easily aggregated.  Researchers who have used this data include Case and Deaton (1998), Thomas (1996),
6:159:12561:10:0:71:200:88:76:g_d0_f6:76:g_d0_f6:and Duflo (2000) among others.
7:160:12592:0:20:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:a cause for concern and the results presented below must be considered in light of this. One would
7:161:12690:20:20:72:540:689:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:of course like to know whether one could speak English and how well, not whether it was spoken
7:162:12784:20:19:72:114:669:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:at home.
7:163:12792:19:20:88:540:650:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:This is an example of one-sided measurement error.  Some of those who are reported as not
7:164:12881:20:19:72:540:630:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:speaking English (as measured by the language spoken at home) in fact can speak English quite
7:165:12974:19:20:72:540:611:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:fluently. On the other hand, few or none of those who stated that English was their first language
7:166:13072:20:19:72:540:591:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:were in fact unable to speak English. This is because the answer to the language question was asked
7:167:13171:19:20:72:540:572:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:at the outset and determined the language in which the survey was administered. For example, if
7:168:13266:20:19:72:540:552:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:someone who spoke only Zulu stated that English was their language, that individual would have
7:169:13360:19:20:72:540:533:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:to then complete a multi-hour survey in English. It would not be hard to detect the mis-statement
7:170:13457:20:20:72:206:513:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:of language in this instance.
7:171:13486:20:19:88:540:493:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:The 1993 data on income are pretty good.  The measure I use in this paper is an individual’s
7:172:13578:19:20:72:540:474:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:total monthly income and is a constructed variable comprised mostly of wage income. It is common
7:173:13674:20:19:72:540:454:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:in developing countries to highlight the importance of accounting for self-production of food to
7:174:13770:19:20:72:535:435:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:properly compute income, but this is not an issue in South Africa. Own production is negligible.
7:175:13866:20:19:88:540:415:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:For the 2000 data, I combine two surveys, the September 2000 Labour Force Survey (LFS) and
7:176:13956:19:20:72:307:396:119:g_d0_f4:58:g_d0_f7:the 2000 Income and Expenditure Survey (IES).4
7:177:14002:20:19:88:540:376:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:Although the surveys are not explicitly linked,  it turns out that the same households were
7:178:14093:19:20:71:539:357:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:included in both. The merged surveys result in a data set with about 101,000 individuals comprising
7:179:14192:20:19:71:539:337:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:about 26,000 households. The language question is in the 2000 LFS while income comes from the
7:180:14285:19:20:71:539:318:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:2000 IES. The wording of the language question is the same as 1993.  It again asks about the
7:181:14377:20:20:71:539:298:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:language  spoken most often  at home.   The 2000  individual income  data are used to  compute
7:182:14471:20:19:71:539:278:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:total individual income in a manner most comparable with the 1993 definition.  This amounts to
7:183:14565:19:20:71:378:259:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:subtracting various grants and pensions from individual income.
7:184:14628:20:19:88:540:239:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:Table 3 presents frequency counts of language by race for each year of the sample. The sample
7:185:14721:19:20:71:539:220:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:is taken only among those reporting positive income and between the ages of 20 to 60. The lower
7:186:14816:20:19:71:539:200:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:bound is intended to exclude students and results are robust to a lower bound of 25 years instead of
7:187:14916:19:20:71:539:181:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:the somewhat arbitrary 20. The advantage of using 20 years old instead of 25 is that the sample size
7:188:15016:20:19:71:539:161:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:increases substantially.  The upper bound is intended to exclude those receiving old-age pensions
7:189:15113:19:20:71:539:142:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:since those clearly do not depend on language spoken.  Also, old age pensions are not going to be
7:190:15210:20:14:78:539:122:58:g_d0_f7:76:g_d0_f6:4There was also  an Income and Expenditure Survey in 1995 and a linkable household  survey  (the October
7:191:15314:14:10:71:539:108:76:g_d0_f6:76:g_d0_f6:Household Survey). The 1995 IES and OHS are an attractive data source since questions are asked in the same way
7:192:15425:10:10:71:539:98:76:g_d0_f6:76:g_d0_f6:and one can be comfortable that income is measured consistently across the 1995 and 2000 surveys. Alas, the 1995
7:193:15537:10:0:71:319:88:76:g_d0_f6:76:g_d0_f6:survey ”forgot”to include the standard question on language.
8:194:15598:0:20:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:impacted by globalization as wage income might be. Some women begin to collect these pensions at
8:195:15694:20:20:72:538:689:119:g_d0_f4:58:g_d0_f7:age 60, hence the upper bound. There are three key messages from Table 3. First, very few Blacks5
8:196:15791:20:20:72:540:669:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:list English as their primary language. This is especially true in 1993 and it suggests that the return
8:197:15894:20:19:72:540:649:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:to speaking English within Blacks is going to be identified off of precious few observations. Second,
8:198:15995:19:20:72:540:630:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:Coloureds and Whites have a substantial numbers of English speakers. For each, Afrikaans is the
8:199:16090:20:20:72:540:610:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:majority language and for each there are substantial shifts in the fraction of the population group
8:200:16189:20:19:72:540:590:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:reporting English as their primary language.  That fraction declines for Coloureds and increases
8:201:16285:19:20:72:540:571:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:for Whites.  Third, English is essentially co-linear with Indian so that it will not be possible to
8:202:16384:20:20:72:473:551:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:separately identify the impact of English from the impact of being Indian on wages.
8:203:16467:20:20:88:540:531:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:Whereas Table 3 indicated the racial composition of English speakers, Table 4 illustrates in which
8:204:16565:20:19:72:540:511:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:sectors of the economy these English speakers work. Tabulating only individuals between the ages
8:205:16661:19:20:72:540:492:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:of 20 and 60, Table 4 shows what fraction of workers in each of 11 sectors list English as their first
8:206:16763:20:20:72:540:472:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:language.  That fraction is highest in Business Services (comprised mostly of the financial sector)
8:207:16862:20:19:72:540:452:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:at 35.75 percent in 1993 and 32.2 percent in 2000.  Other sectors with large fractions of English
8:208:16959:19:20:72:540:433:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:speakers (or, more accurately, English “listers”) include manufacturing, electricity, wholesale and
8:209:17058:20:20:72:540:413:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:retail trade, and community services (which includes doctors, teachers, and lawyers.) In all sectors,
8:210:17159:20:19:72:540:393:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:the fraction listing English declined from 1993 to 2000, usually modestly.  There are in principle
8:211:17257:19:20:72:540:374:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:two ways that the economy might adapt to an increased demand for English.  The supply could
8:212:17348:20:20:72:540:354:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:increase and/or the return could increase. Table 4 suggests that the supply did not increase. I turn
8:213:17448:20:33:72:400:334:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:next to examining whether the return to speaking English increased.
8:214:17515:33:27:72:266:301:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:4. The Return to Speaking English
8:215:17548:27:19:72:540:274:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:The question at hand is whether the return to speaking English (as imperfectly measured) increased
8:216:17646:19:20:72:540:255:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:as South Africa opened up to the international economy from 1993 to 2000. The return to speaking
8:217:17742:20:20:72:540:235:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:English is not directly observable and so needs to be inferred from econometric evidence.  The
8:218:17836:20:19:72:540:215:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:approach adopted here is to estimate Mincer-like wage regressions and include as an explanatory
8:219:17931:19:20:72:540:196:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:variable whether the wage-earner listed English as his or her primary language.  While simple in
8:220:18027:20:20:72:265:176:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:principle, several issues arise in practice.
8:221:18071:20:20:88:540:156:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:First, it is necessary even in the cross-section to include as explanatory variables key determi-
8:222:18168:20:21:72:539:136:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:nants of wages.6Omission of an explanatory variable that itself might be correlated with speaking
8:223:18265:21:13:78:539:115:58:g_d0_f7:76:g_d0_f6:5I use the term “Blacks” since this seems to be preferred by most South Africans to the term “Africans” that is
8:224:18376:13:19:71:418:102:76:g_d0_f6:76:g_d0_f6:used in the survey instrument. For data purposes, the two terms are interchangeable.
8:225:18460:19:0:78:539:83:58:g_d0_f7:76:g_d0_f6:6A difference in differences approach is ill-advised because of concurrent changes in many other variables impacting
9:226:18577:0:20:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:English will bias the estimate on the return to speaking English.  Second, the many changes in
9:227:18671:20:20:72:540:689:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:South Africa from 1993 to 2000 probably impacted many of the determinants of wages. It is widely
9:228:18767:20:20:72:540:669:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:believed, for example, that the return to education and the wage differentials apparently due to
9:229:18863:20:19:72:540:649:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:race changed over this period.  Holding them constant and only allowing the return to English to
9:230:18959:19:20:72:540:630:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:change will yield biased estimates of the true change in the return to speaking English.  (On the
9:231:19056:20:20:72:540:610:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:other hand, such an approach pretty much guarantees finding a pretty big change in the return to
9:232:19152:20:19:72:540:590:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:speaking English.) Third, the fact that about 40 percent of English speakers are Indian and there
9:233:19249:19:20:72:540:571:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:is virtually no language variation within this population group poses a challenge. The most flexible
9:234:19349:20:20:72:540:551:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:approach to estimating the returns to speaking English examines the change in that return within
9:235:19445:20:20:72:447:531:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:population group yet this approach is going to be non-informative for Indians.
9:236:19523:20:19:88:539:511:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:The simplest specification regresses log individual income (yi) on indicator variables for each

9:246:20139:20:19:71:539:320:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:(OLS) with the appropriate sample weights.  Estimating the regression separately for each year is
9:247:20236:19:20:71:539:301:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:necessary to capture the changes in returns to education between 1993 and 2000 as well as changes
9:248:20333:20:20:71:539:281:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:in the return to being male and/or of a particular population group. Use of indicator variables for
9:249:20432:20:20:71:539:261:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:each level of education permits returns to vary non-linearly with years. The coefficient on English,
9:250:20532:20:19:71:540:241:119:g_d0_f8:119:g_d0_f4:β8is interpreted as the percentage wage differential attributable to speaking English conditional
9:251:20629:19:20:71:539:222:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:on the other included regressors. The results from this specification applied to the 1993 and 2000
9:252:20727:20:20:71:214:202:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:data are presented in Table 5.
9:253:20757:20:19:88:540:182:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:The results from 1993 are discussed first to fix ideas. The first 12 rows show the usual returns to
9:254:20856:19:20:71:539:163:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:education. For example, someone with 12 years of education, all else equal, earns about 168 percent
9:255:20955:20:25:71:539:143:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:more than those with one year or less of education conditional on the other co-variates. The wage
9:256:21052:25:10:72:540:118:76:g_d0_f6:76:g_d0_f6:wages. That is, while one could measure the difference in wages between those who list English as their first language
9:257:21170:10:10:72:540:108:76:g_d0_f6:76:g_d0_f6:and those who do not, and one could then examine the difference over time in this difference, the result would be
9:258:21283:10:9:72:540:98:76:g_d0_f6:76:g_d0_f6:hard to interpret. This is because many other variables changed over this period and some of those changes are not
9:259:21397:9:0:72:291:89:76:g_d0_f6:76:g_d0_f6:orthogonal to an observed return to speaking English.
10:260:21451:0:20:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:premium for being a member of a race other than Black ranges from 32 percent for Coloured to 98
10:261:21546:20:20:72:540:689:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:percent for White. Males earn 46 percent more than similar females. The coefficient of interest for
10:262:21645:20:20:72:540:669:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:this study, though, is that on “English.”  Conditional on education, experience, gender, and race,
10:263:21743:20:19:72:540:649:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:people who list English as their primary language earn about 18 percent more than those who list
10:264:21839:19:20:72:373:630:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:another language. This differential is quite precisely estimated.
10:265:21904:20:20:88:540:610:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:Equation (1) is estimated using the 2000 data and the results are in column two of Table 5.
10:266:21995:20:20:72:540:590:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:While there are several interesting comparisons between 1993 and 2000 to be made (the changing
10:267:22089:20:19:72:540:570:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:pattern of the return to education for instance), the focus here is on the impact of speaking English.
10:268:22191:19:20:72:540:551:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:The “English premium” jumps from .183 in 1993 to .252 in 2000.  The 2000 premium is precisely
10:269:22284:20:20:72:540:531:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:estimated  and the change between the two years is significantly different than zero.   Allowing
10:270:22380:20:19:72:540:511:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:the entire pattern of returns to years of schooling to vary from 1993 to 2000, and allowing for
10:271:22475:19:20:72:540:492:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:differing returns to race, gender, and experience, it is still the case that the return to speaking
10:272:22574:20:20:72:540:472:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:English increased substantially.  This change in the English premium as well as its level are of
10:273:22670:20:19:72:540:452:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:an economically large magnitude.  By 2000, English speakers were earning about 25 percent more
10:274:22764:19:20:72:540:433:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:after conditioning on other observables and the premium had increased by 7 percentage points since
10:275:22862:20:20:72:97:413:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:1993.
10:276:22867:20:20:88:540:393:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:The specification reported in Table 5 imposes that the returns to education, experience, and
10:277:22959:20:19:72:540:373:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:gender are identical across racial groups. A convincing body of research suggests this is too strong
10:278:23059:19:20:72:540:354:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:an assumption.  I proceed by looking for the English premium within each of the racial groups.
10:279:23153:20:20:72:540:334:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:Doing so allows the returns on all the other observables to vary by racial group.  This flexibility
10:280:23252:20:20:72:540:314:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:is clearly a good thing for it lets the data speak more “freely.”  The flexibility, though, will carry
10:281:23354:20:19:72:540:294:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:a price. Thirty to forty percent of the sample that listed English as the language spoken at home
10:282:23451:19:20:72:540:275:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:are Indian, and virtually all Indians list English as the primary language. There is, then, no within
10:283:23552:20:20:72:540:255:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:group language variation for Indians.  Hence, it is not feasible to estimate a return to speaking
10:284:23649:20:19:72:540:235:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:English for Indians since that return is not identifiably different than the return to simply being
10:285:23748:19:20:72:109:216:119:g_d0_f4:58:g_d0_f7:Indian.7
10:286:23756:20:20:88:540:196:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:Table 6 reports results from the within-group regressions for Blacks, Coloureds, and Whites.
10:287:23848:20:21:71:539:176:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:In the interest of parsimony, only the coefficient on speaking English is reported.8This approach
10:288:23945:21:14:78:539:155:58:g_d0_f7:76:g_d0_f6:7It is possible to estimate a return to speaking English among Indians, but the effect is identified off of 3 individuals
10:289:24066:14:10:71:539:141:76:g_d0_f6:76:g_d0_f6:who listed “Other” in 1993 and about 6 Afrikaans-speaking Indians in 2000. The English premium, when separate
10:290:24175:10:19:71:362:131:76:g_d0_f6:76:g_d0_f6:regressions are run for Indians, is never significantly different than zero.
10:291:24251:19:14:78:539:112:58:g_d0_f7:76:g_d0_f6:8Were it the case that the returns on the other observables (not reported in this table) did not vary significantly
10:292:24366:14:9:71:539:98:76:g_d0_f6:76:g_d0_f6:across racial groups, it would be efficient to pool groups.  Alas, coefficients vary across groups and one can readily
10:293:24484:9:0:71:532:89:76:g_d0_f6:76:g_d0_f6:reject the hypothesis that the returns to observables other than the English premium are the same across groups.
11:294:24597:0:20:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:is pretty flexible. It allows the returns on all observables to vary both over time and across racial
11:295:24698:20:20:72:107:689:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:groups.
11:296:24705:20:20:88:540:669:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:As is usually the case with a more flexible specification, the messages are more mixed than
11:297:24796:20:20:72:540:649:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:those reported in Table 5. The first row of Table 6 reports the English premium from Table 5 for
11:298:24892:20:19:72:540:629:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:comparison’s sake.  The next three rows report the English premium for the other racial groups
11:299:24986:19:20:72:540:610:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:(except Indian for reasons discussed above.)  For Blacks,  the English premium stayed constant
11:300:25080:20:20:72:540:590:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:from 1993 to 2000.  It was huge (about 60 percent) but did not increase over time, although the
11:301:25175:20:20:72:540:570:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:precision of the estimate did increase.   One should recall,  though,  that this premium is being
11:302:25272:20:19:72:540:550:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:identified off of very few individuals– 6 out of 2468 in 1993 and 118 out of 20,222 in 2000.  For
11:303:25369:19:20:72:540:531:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:Coloureds, the return to speaking English fell about 11 percentage points.  The decline, while not
11:304:25467:20:20:72:540:511:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:large, is statistically significantly different than zero. The largest change from 1993 to 2000 in the
11:305:25569:20:20:72:540:491:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:English premium impacted Whites.  The return went from being basically non-existent in 1993 to
11:306:25663:20:19:72:540:471:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:a precisely estimated 14.5 percent.  Another way to interpret this result is that the “penalty” to
11:307:25761:19:20:72:297:452:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:speaking Afrikaans among Whites skyrocketed.
11:308:25805:20:20:88:540:432:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:The general pattern reported in Table 6 is robust to many alternative specifications. For exam-
11:309:25900:20:20:72:540:412:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:ple, the inclusion of indicator variables for the province in which a household lives, using a single
11:310:26001:20:20:72:540:392:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:variable for years of education instead of the more flexible set of indicator variables, the exclusion
11:311:26103:20:19:72:540:372:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:of the variable for male, using age 25 as a lower age bound, using 65 as an upper age bound, and
11:312:26199:19:20:72:540:353:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:interacting the return to English with education all yield basically the same message when it comes
11:313:26298:20:20:72:540:333:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:to the English premium.  Namely, that premium became much larger for Whites, fell slightly for
11:314:26392:20:20:72:539:313:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:Coloureds and for Blacks.9These results, though, exclude a large number of those with positive
11:315:26486:20:33:71:337:293:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:income for whom English is the first language– Indians.
11:316:26541:33:27:71:202:260:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:5. Concluding Remarks
11:317:26562:27:20:71:539:233:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:Did globalizationreallycause the return to English to increase in South Africa?  The evidence in
11:318:26658:20:20:71:539:213:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:this paper is, in some cases, corroborating, but hardly conclusive. The strongest and most robust
11:319:26755:20:20:71:539:193:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:result is the the return to speaking English increased for Whites over the period during which South
11:320:26855:20:19:71:539:173:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:Africa re-integrated with the world economy. This result strong because it results from the flexible
11:321:26955:19:20:71:539:154:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:within-group estimates, and it is robust because it arises in all the investigated specifications. When
11:322:27058:20:20:71:539:134:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:Indians are included and a (necessarily) less flexible estimation strategy is adopted, I again find that
11:323:27162:20:21:71:539:114:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:the return to English increased and that the increase is precisely estimated. These are the results
11:324:27261:21:0:78:334:93:58:g_d0_f7:76:g_d0_f6:9For some specification, the premium rises slightly for Blacks.
12:325:27325:0:20:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:in Table 5. If one thinks of these results as indicating an “average” effect of speaking English, that
12:326:27427:20:19:72:540:689:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:effect is positive.  There is less evidence, though, that the return to speaking English increased
12:327:27525:19:19:72:213:670:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:among Blacks and Coloureds.
12:328:27552:19:20:88:540:651:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:One explanation for the lack of an increase in the return to speaking English among Blacks is
12:329:27645:20:19:72:540:631:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:the following.  In 1993, there were few Blacks that spoke English and they earned a premium for
12:330:27740:19:19:72:540:612:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:their language skills. With the advent of affirmative action, the premium for speaking English fell
12:331:27839:19:20:72:540:593:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:as more Blacks were promoted into higher paying jobs. In this case, it was no longer just the few
12:332:27936:20:19:72:540:573:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:English speaking Blacks earning the relatively higher wages.  This scenario illustrates one of the
12:333:28034:19:19:72:540:554:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:difficulties of disentangling the impact of globalization (which might actually increase the return
12:334:28133:19:19:72:540:535:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:to speaking English) with the impact of affirmative action for Blacks (which was concurrent with
12:335:28229:19:20:72:497:516:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:globalization and which might actually decrease the “extra” return to speaking English.)
12:336:28317:20:19:88:540:496:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:There was  no affirmative  action  for Whites  and among this  group,  the return to speaking
12:337:28410:19:19:72:540:477:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:English clearly rose. Put another way the penalty for speaking Afrikaans rose for Whites. This is
12:338:28507:19:20:72:540:458:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:consistent with capturing an impact of globalization. Afrikaans, unlike English, is much less useful
12:339:28607:20:19:72:540:438:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:in international commerce.  Those Whites whose first language was English benefited conditional
12:340:28702:19:19:72:540:419:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:on education, gender, and experience.  This is, as noted above, corroborating but not conclusive
12:341:28798:19:20:72:115:400:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:evidence.
12:342:28807:20:19:88:540:380:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:The finding that the return to speaking English did not increase for Coloureds muddles the
12:343:28897:19:19:72:540:361:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:waters. Coloureds did not benefit from affirmative action as did Blacks under the new government.
12:344:28994:19:19:72:540:342:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:Still, the return to speaking English did not rise and in fact fell. If globalization is what moves the
12:345:29097:19:20:72:540:323:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:return to speaking English, one should have found an increase to speaking English among Coloureds
12:346:29194:20:19:72:196:303:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:and this was not the case.
12:347:29220:19:19:88:540:284:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:The evidence in the end is mixed.  On the whole, the return to speaking English increased
12:348:29309:19:20:72:540:265:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:but within racial groups, the pattern is not consistent.10The approach adopted in this paper is
12:349:29404:20:19:71:539:245:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:perhaps a novel way to revisit the wages and globalization issue. It is an approach that is especially
12:350:29506:19:19:71:539:226:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:well-suited to developing countries,  many of which have a rich variety of languages spoken, as
12:351:29601:19:20:71:539:207:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:they integrate with the global economy. In other contexts (India, for example), or with better data
12:352:29700:20:19:71:539:187:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:(industry of employment data, for example), the approach adopted here may prove more conclusive.
12:353:29796:19:19:71:539:168:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:Or not. Even if language is an accurate way to isolate an impact of globalization on wages, it may
12:354:29894:19:19:71:539:149:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:simply be that globalization  has differing impacts on differing segments of a population.   This
12:355:29991:19:18:71:258:130:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:appears to be the case in South Africa.
12:356:30030:18:14:73:540:112:58:g_d0_f7:76:g_d0_f6:10It should be noted that precious few of the English speakers are among the very poor.  In 1993, virtually none
12:357:30142:14:10:71:539:98:76:g_d0_f6:76:g_d0_f6:are while in 2000 only a handful are. Hence, this approach does not speak to the role of globalization on the incomes
12:358:30259:10:0:71:139:88:76:g_d0_f6:76:g_d0_f6:of the very poor.
