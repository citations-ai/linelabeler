2:32:1757:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:a solvent bank to a run. Uncertainty about the bank’s liquidity and potential failure motivates depositors
2:33:1863:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:who hear the rumor to acquire additional noisy signals. Depositors with less informative signals may
2:34:1963:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:wait before gradually running on the bank, leading to an endogenous aggregate withdrawal speed and

2:37:2264:14:42:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:can mitigate runs by indirectly crowding-out individual depositors’ effort to acquire liquidity information.

3:50:2581:0:33:72:185:709:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:1  Introduction
3:51:2596:33:22:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Bank runs are unfortunately still with us. Runs occurred recently on major traditional banks such
3:52:2693:22:22:72:539:654:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:as Northern Rock and IndyMac, and on non-traditional “shadow” banks. In Section2, we document
3:53:2786:22:22:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:several intriguing features of the largest ever bank failure, which resulted from the 2008 run on
3:54:2883:22:22:72:540:610:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Washington Mutual: (i) the bank survived a first run, followed by deposit inflows; (ii) rumors circu-
3:55:2984:22:22:72:540:588:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:lated, but there was no public information of the first run happening; (iii) uncertainty about bank
3:56:3083:22:22:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:liquidity played a key role in a second fatal run; (iv) both runs had an important time dimension;
3:57:3181:22:22:72:540:544:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(v) worried depositors (even those covered by FDIC insurance) acquired additional information,
3:58:3275:22:22:72:540:522:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:then some withdrew immediately, while others decided to wait. The empirical pattern that runs
3:59:3368:22:21:72:540:500:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:have an important time dimension and that uncertainty and learning play a key role, has been
3:60:3460:21:22:72:540:479:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:documented as far back as the 1857 run on the Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank, and is especially
3:61:3557:22:22:72:540:457:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:important for the uninsured shadow banking system (e.g., money market funds behavior amid the
3:62:3650:22:22:72:539:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:European debt crisis discussed in Section2). The dynamic effects of information acquisition and
3:63:3745:22:22:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the incentives to wait, on the existence and duration of bank runs, have not been studied by existing
3:64:3846:22:22:72:270:391:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:bank run models. We aim to fill this gap.
3:65:3887:22:22:88:539:369:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We study dynamic rumor-based bank runs with endogenous information acquisition. Our model
3:66:3976:22:22:72:539:347:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:incorporates uncertainty about bank liquidity into the asynchronous awareness framework ofAbreu
3:67:4071:22:22:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and Brunnermeier(2003). A liquidity event occurs at some unobservable random time, at which
3:68:4162:22:22:72:540:303:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:point a solvent bank becomes illiquid with a known probability or remains liquid. An illiquid bank
3:69:4260:22:22:72:540:281:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:has only a limited amount of cash exposing it to a run, while a liquid bank has sufficient reserves to
3:70:4362:22:22:72:540:259:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:avoid a run. In the 07/08 financial crisis, the liquidity event can be thought of as banks with opaque
3:71:4464:22:22:72:540:237:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:exposure to mortgage-backed securities becoming weak and thus “illiquid” following adverse shocks
3:72:4561:22:21:72:540:215:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:in the housing market. The liquidity event triggers the spread of arumorsaying the liquidity event
3:73:4659:21:22:72:540:194:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:has occurred and the bank may be illiquid, exposing the bank to a run. Agents (depositors) can
3:74:4753:22:22:72:540:172:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:withdraw or deposit funds back at any time for a small transaction cost, but in the unique bank
3:75:4848:22:22:72:540:150:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:run equilibrium, upon hearing the rumor, agents wait, fully withdraw, and then redeposit if the
3:76:4943:22:22:72:540:128:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:bank survives. The optimal withdrawal time trades-off the marginal benefit of waiting inside the
3:77:5039:22:22:72:540:106:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:bank due to the yield on deposits, with the marginal cost of waiting due to risk of loss in a bank
3:78:5137:22:0:72:105:84:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:failure.
4:79:5146:0:22:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We first show that a straightforward application ofAbreu and Brunnermeier(2003) to bank
4:80:5233:22:22:71:540:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:runswithoutinformation acquisition is rather uninteresting: in equilibrium,eitherbank runs never
4:81:5329:22:22:71:540:665:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:occur,ordepositors run on the bank immediately upon hearing the rumor.  Intuitively, if the
4:82:5420:22:22:71:539:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:conjectured (off-equilibrium) bank survival time is so long that every agent decides to wait a bit
4:83:5518:22:22:71:539:621:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:longer, then the illiquid bank would fail later. This longer survival time pushes agents to wait even
4:84:5619:22:22:71:539:599:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:longer. This force is so strong that, in equilibrium, agents never withdraw and the bank survives
4:85:5716:22:22:71:539:577:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:indefinitely, i.e. runs never occur. On the other hand, if every agent decides to withdraw a bit
4:86:5812:22:22:71:539:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:earlier, then the equilibrium force of a shorter bank survival time pushes all agents to withdraw
4:87:5909:22:22:71:539:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:immediately upon hearing the rumor. In this bank run equilibrium, the withdrawal speed and the
4:88:6003:22:22:71:488:511:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f6:implied bank survival time are exogenously determined by the rumor spreading speed.1
4:89:6087:22:22:88:539:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We then allow uncertainty-motivated informed agents who hear the rumor to acquire additional
4:90:6179:22:22:71:539:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:noisy signals. Our main result shows that private information acquisition about liquidity exposes
4:91:6276:22:21:71:539:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:otherwise safe banks to destructive runs with endogenous waiting. There are three potential signal
4:92:6374:21:22:71:540:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:realizations:good,fair, andbad, which are independent across agents conditional on the bank liquid-
4:93:6473:22:22:71:539:402:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:ity state. Information acquisition with noisy signals creates belief heterogeneity among depositors,
4:94:6573:22:22:71:539:380:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:which is key to our result. A good or bad signal reveals the liquidity state perfectly. Receiving
4:95:6670:22:22:71:539:358:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:a fair signal can be interpreted as seeing mixed evidences, leaving the agent still uncertain about
4:96:6769:22:22:71:539:336:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:bank liquidity as his prior. A higher quality signal is more likely to reveal the state perfectly. If the
4:97:6874:22:22:71:539:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:bank is indeed illiquid, then in aggregate a higher quality implies more agents receive bad signals
4:98:6973:22:22:71:231:292:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:thus knowing the bank is illiquid.
4:99:7007:22:22:88:539:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Fixing the signal quality, we show that in a setting where bank runs never exist otherwise, an
4:100:7101:22:22:71:539:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:interesting bank run equilibrium with endogenous waiting emerges once we allow agents to acquire
4:101:7197:22:22:71:539:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:information. Conditional on the bank being illiquid, agents with bad signals perceive a high bank
4:102:7294:22:22:71:539:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:failure hazard rate and withdraw immediately.  Agents with uninformative fair signals maintain
4:103:7388:22:22:71:539:182:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the same beliefs they had before acquiring the signals, but now also worry about withdrawals by
4:104:7483:22:21:71:539:160:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:bad-signal agents—hence fair-signal agents withdraw earlier than they would otherwise. This effect
4:105:7581:21:22:71:539:139:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:goes a long way in changing the qualitative nature of the bank run equilibrium. In equilibrium,
4:106:7676:22:16:71:539:117:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:instead of waiting indefinitely, agents with fair signals wait some endogenous time, earning a yield on
4:107:7779:16:15:84:539:101:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:1In deriving the endogenous bubble burst time,Abreu and Brunnermeierresolve this issue by assuming that the
4:108:7886:15:11:72:540:86:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:bubble component increases over time. This would be a hard assumption to swallow in a bank run setting: it would
4:109:7998:11:0:72:427:75:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:require that for aperfectly liquid bankthe value of a dollar deposited declines over time.
5:110:8089:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:deposits, but withdraw once the failure hazard rate becomes substantial, leading to an endogenous
5:111:8186:22:22:72:267:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:equilibrium (illiquid) bank survival time.
5:112:8228:22:22:88:539:665:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The mechanism is as follows. Without information acquisition, all agents effectively have fair
5:113:8322:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:signals. If all agents were to wait longer, the equilibrium bank failure time would be delayed by
5:114:8419:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the same amount.  This force pushes all agents to wait indefinitely and thus banks never fail.
5:115:8513:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:With information acquisition, there is belief heterogeneity among depositors; specifically, there are
5:116:8614:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:both fair-signal and bad-signal agents conditional on the bank being illiquid. When all fair-signal
5:117:8713:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:agents wait a bit longer, the delay in bank failure is limited, because more bad-signal agents have
5:118:8812:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:withdrawn. A “fear-of-bad-signal-agents” increases the equilibrium hazard rate perceived by fair-
5:119:8909:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:signal agents, and results in a unique endogenous withdrawal time that equates the marginal cost

5:121:9028:22:22:88:539:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We then study the endogenous choice of signal quality with the bank run equilibrium. With
5:122:9117:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:this additional ingredient, our model features both strategiccomplementarityandsubstitutability
5:123:9212:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:in information acquisition among individual agents.  Potential bank failure motivates agents to
5:124:9307:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:acquire higher quality signals, which in turn, shorten the equilibrium survival time of the failing
5:125:9406:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:bank. This positive spiral between bank runs and information acquisition makes bank runs more
5:126:9499:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:likely. We show that in an economy that without information acquisition is free of bank runs, there
5:127:9598:22:22:72:539:336:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:could be two equilibria once information acquisition is allowed: ano-run-no-acquisition equilibrium
5:128:9697:22:22:72:539:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:where agents do not acquire additional signals and do not run, and arun-acquisition equilibrium
5:129:9792:22:22:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:where agents acquire information aggressively and run on the illiquid bank.  Socially inefficient
5:130:9889:22:22:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:information acquisition about bank illiquidity thus exhibits strategic complementarity regarding
5:131:9985:22:22:72:226:248:11:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:whether to acquire information.2
5:132:10017:22:22:88:539:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:However, in our setting with smooth information acquisition costs, information acquisition
5:133:10107:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:exhibits strategic substitutability regardinghow much information to acquiredue to a learning
5:134:10200:22:22:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:effect. In our model there is a natural “public” signal conveyed by the fact that the bank has not
5:135:10298:22:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:yet failed. If others study more about the bank and run on the illiquid one, then the illiquid bank
5:136:10397:21:16:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:fails faster. As a result, this public signal becomes more informative. Because a more informative
5:137:10495:16:15:84:540:123:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:2This positive feedback effect is similar toHellwig and Veldkamp(2009) who show that in their particular static
5:138:10606:15:11:71:539:108:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:setting, information acquisition exhibits complementarity if and only if ensuing actions (in our model, running on
5:139:10720:11:11:71:539:97:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:the bank) are complementary.  In other economic settings, information acquisition complementarity arises even
5:140:10829:11:11:71:539:86:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:though ensuing actions are not complementary; one such example is the ex ante investment in high-frequency trading
5:141:10943:11:0:71:311:75:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:technology analyzed inBiais, Foucault, and Moinas(2013).
6:142:11000:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:public signal lowers the value of private signals, individual agents hearing the rumor respond by
6:143:11097:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:acquiring less information.  This learning effect also explains a counter-intuitive result that the
6:144:11196:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:wider the awareness window over which the rumor spreads, implyingmorepotential withdrawers,
6:145:11287:22:22:72:539:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:thelongerthe illiquid bank survives. The intuition is that conditional on the bank surviving thus
6:146:11384:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:far, the bank is more likely to be liquid given that the rumor could have started spreading a long
6:147:11482:22:22:72:369:599:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:time ago, which discourages incentives to acquire information.
6:148:11544:22:22:88:539:577:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We extend our model along two dimensions. First, we consider fundamentally insolvent banks.
6:149:11635:22:22:72:539:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:When agents privately collect information about banksolvency, they inevitably learn about bank
6:150:11729:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:liquidity. Effort spent acquiring one reduces the effort needed to acquire the other. We show that
6:151:11827:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:public provision of solvency information curbs the private acquisition of bank liquidity information
6:152:11927:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and delays a bank’s failure, which, even for a short while, can help both regulators and industry
6:153:12024:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:organize an orderly resolution that minimizes damage to the banking system.3Thus our model
6:154:12114:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:implies that carefully constructed stress tests can help prevent or mitigate bank runs by crowding
6:155:12212:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:out information acquisition by individuals.  Second, we show it is beneficial to avoid providing
6:156:12308:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:too much information that differentiates competing solvent but potentially illiquid banks, as small
6:157:12407:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:differences in liquidity can result in runs on slightly weaker banks. This justifies U.S. government
6:158:12507:22:22:72:482:358:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:actions that forced all “Big 9” banks to take government capital on October 13, 2008.
6:159:12592:22:22:88:540:336:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Our model is related to a vast literature on the role of information instaticbank runs, and
6:160:12683:22:22:72:539:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:it is beyond the scope of our paper to have a thorough review on this topic.4The distinguishing
6:161:12778:22:22:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:feature is gradual withdrawal, which is an important aspect of modern bank runs (see Section2).
6:162:12873:22:22:71:539:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The dynamic nature of bank runs has been explored by studying the sequential service constraint
6:163:12968:22:22:71:540:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:in theDiamond and Dybvigsetting.Green and Lin(2003) point out that no bank runs exist if
6:164:13056:22:22:71:539:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:depositors know their clock times of arrival and thus infer their relative positions in the queue,
6:165:13154:22:16:71:539:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:whilePeck and Shell(2003) show that bank runs exist if the relative queue position information is

6:169:13551:11:11:71:540:151:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:opposed to a sunspot-based theory (Gorton and Winton,2003, Ch. IV). On the topic of information acquisition and
6:170:13662:11:11:71:540:140:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:bank runs,Nikitin and Smith(2008) study how information acquisition about banksolvencyaffects the bank run
6:171:13768:11:11:71:539:129:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:equilibrium in a staticDiamond and Dybvigsetting. In contrast, we focus on information acquisition about bank
6:172:13877:11:11:71:540:118:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f8:liquidity. Based on theMorris and Shin(2002) global games technique,Goldstein and Pauzner(2005) study the
6:173:13982:11:11:71:539:107:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:optimal deposit contract by deriving a unique equilibrium when depositors in aDiamond and Dybvigtype setting
6:174:14090:11:11:71:539:96:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:are endowed with private noisy signals about bank fundamentals. We allow for endogenous information acquisition,
6:175:14202:11:0:71:538:85:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:and show that excessive socially wasteful learning may lead to socially inefficient runs on solvent-but-illiquid banks.
7:176:14322:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:unavailable.5In this regard, our paper is similar toPeck and Shell(2003) since each agent in our
7:177:14418:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:model assigns the same distribution to her relative position in the queue. Relative to these models,
7:178:14518:22:22:72:500:665:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:we emphasize the endogenous interaction between information acquisition and bank runs.
7:179:14604:22:22:88:539:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Gu (2011) studies depositors’ withdrawal strategy sequentially for a potentially insolvent bank in
7:180:14702:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:a Diamond and Dybvigsetting. Unlike our paper, (some) depositors inGu (2011) observe previous
7:181:14795:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:withdrawals. Because withdrawals indicate bank insolvency,Gu (2011) shows that herding (ignoring
7:182:14891:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:private information which is endowed exogenously) after a long sequence of withdrawals may lead
7:183:14986:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to inefficient bank runs. Our paper with endogenous information quality emphasizes individual
7:184:15079:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:depositors’ uncertainty and forming of rational expectation over other depositors’ withdrawal timing
7:185:15179:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and strategies.  This aspect is important given the modern age of electronic banking, the high
7:186:15273:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:frequency nature of repo in the context of shadow banking, or the large scale runs by money market
7:187:15371:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:funds that faced the European sovereign debt crisis. Thus our mechanism is complementary toGu
7:188:15464:22:21:72:500:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(2011) in understanding the dynamics of bank runs together with the role of information.
7:189:15552:21:22:88:539:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:From a modeling perspective, our framework features more empirically appealing timing as-
7:190:15641:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:sumptions in that individual depositors can withdraw or redeposit their funds at any time; this
7:191:15736:22:22:72:539:380:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:represents a substantial improvement from theDiamond and Dybvigframework and the above-
7:192:15823:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:mentioned important extensions. If high frequency micro-level data is available, our analytically
7:193:15920:22:22:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:tractable model is particularly calibration-friendly thanks to its empirically-interpretable time di-
7:194:16021:22:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:mension.6An alternative approach to bank run modeling isHe and Xiong(2012a,b) who develop
7:195:16110:22:22:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:dynamic debt run models of a firm with a time-varying fundamental and a staggered debt structure.
7:196:16207:22:22:88:540:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Rumors are studied byBanerjee(1993) andvan Bommel(2003). We build on the approach
7:197:16288:22:22:72:539:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of Abreu and Brunnermeier(2002,2003) who consider the asynchronous timing of awareness to
7:198:16377:22:22:72:539:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:study “rational” bubbles.7We add to their model uncertainty about the capacity of the bubble
7:199:16469:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(bank), decouple the spreading rate from the length of the awareness window, and allow agents
7:200:16562:22:16:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to acquire additional noisy information upon awareness. This ex post heterogeneity generates the
7:201:16658:16:14:84:539:166:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:5This literature focuses on optimal mechanism design; for related papers, seeWallace(1988,1990),Andolfatto,
7:202:16765:14:7:72:319:152:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:Nosal, and Wallace(2007), andAndolfatto and Nosal(2008).
7:203:16821:7:15:84:540:145:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:6By contrast,Green and Lin(2003) andPeck and Shell(2003) study finite-agent economy, and depositors can
7:204:16924:15:11:72:540:130:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:either withdraw at period 1, when called in line, or wait until period 2.Gu (2011) considers a relaxation that a finite
7:205:17043:11:11:72:540:119:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:number of depositors can withdraw at any time within an interim stage before period 2. A significant departure
7:206:17153:11:11:72:540:108:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:from theDiamond and Dybvigframework seems necessary for developing dynamic models that are both calibration-
7:207:17261:11:11:72:540:97:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:friendly and tractable. A sacrifice our model makes is to assume away the preference (early or late) type of depositors,
7:208:17381:11:7:72:381:86:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:an ingredient critical forDiamond and Dybvig, but inessential for our paper.
7:209:17457:7:0:84:536:79:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:7Brunnermeier and Morgan(2010) generalize this idea to a class of “clock games” and test its main predictions.
8:210:17568:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:fear-of-bad-signal-agent effect, which naturally leads fair-signal agents to withdraw earlier, giving
8:211:17669:22:22:72:480:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:rise to a bank run equilibrium in which the illiquid bank fails at an endogenous time.
8:212:17755:22:22:88:540:665:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The paper proceeds as follows. Section2 summarizes empirical facts on bank run dynamics.
8:213:17843:22:22:71:540:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Section3 builds a rumor-based bank run setting. Section4 shows that information acquisition
8:214:17934:22:22:71:539:621:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:with noisy signals leads to an interesting bank run equilibrium with an endogenous (aggregate)
8:215:18028:22:22:71:539:599:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:withdrawal speed.  Section5 discusses empirical predictions of our model.  Section6 provides

8:217:18199:45:33:71:309:532:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:2  Empirical Bank Run Evidence
8:218:18229:33:22:71:539:499:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We begin by providing new evidence about the failure of Washington Mutual (WaMu), and syn-
8:219:18319:22:22:71:539:477:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:thesizing the empirical literature on bank run dynamics. Many of the stylized facts about runs on
8:220:18416:22:22:71:539:455:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:traditional regulated commercial banks also appear in shadow bank runs. In organizing these facts
8:221:18513:22:22:71:539:433:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:about bank runs, we highlight three aspects that are key contributions of our model: (i) bank runs
8:222:18611:22:22:71:539:411:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:are dynamic and gradual with rumors spreading among depositor-like agents; (ii) uncertainty and
8:223:18706:22:22:71:539:389:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:learning about the bank’s liquidity drive agents’ withdrawal/redeposit behavior; and (iii) individual
8:224:18807:22:38:71:395:367:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:agents are actively acquiring their own information before they run.
8:225:18875:38:29:71:207:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2.1  Traditional Banks
8:226:18897:29:21:71:539:300:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Figure1 shows that the runs on WaMu were dynamic in nature. The bank suffered two separate
8:227:18987:21:22:71:539:279:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:runs: it experienced gradual withdrawals of $9 billion during a first run lasting 20 days in July
8:228:19084:22:22:71:539:257:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:2008, and withdrawals of $15 billion during a second run lasting 15 days in September 2008, leading
8:229:19183:22:22:71:223:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:up to its takeover by the FDIC.
8:230:19214:22:22:88:539:213:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Information and uncertainty play an important role in both runs on WaMu.  Following the

9:255:20949:22:22:72:540:347:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:its eventual fate played a key role in a fatal second run. The bank’s ability to secure funds from
9:256:21047:22:22:72:539:325:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the Fed was questionable.9Depositors sought out additional information about its liquidity, then

9:259:21348:7:15:84:539:276:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:9WaMu depended on borrowings from the FHLBs of San Francisco and Seattle and the San Francisco Fed acting as
9:260:21456:15:11:72:540:261:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:lenders of last resort. Given its composite CAMELS rating of 4, there was no assurance that funds would be available

9:265:21922:14:11:72:540:207:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:This run was nothing like July’s, which had been tame by comparison. Now people were frenzied, acting purely out
9:266:22034:11:11:72:540:196:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:of fear. ‘We just didn’t have any control,’ said one branch manager. The tellers’ talking points no longer placated the
9:267:22153:11:11:72:540:185:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:customers—even the tellers didn’t understand them. ‘They kept telling us to say that we have $44 billion, whatever
9:268:22267:11:11:72:540:174:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:that meant,’ said one employee, likely referencing WaMu’s liquidity position. The customers demanded to talk to
9:269:22378:11:11:72:540:163:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:whoever was in charge. At one Seattle location, they lined up and waited all day to speak to the branch manager.
9:270:22490:11:11:72:540:152:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:‘Should I take my money out?’ they asked her when they reached her, over and over again. ‘Is WaMu going under?’
9:271:22601:11:11:72:540:141:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:And they asked the inevitable question: ‘What wouldyoudo?’ The branch manager, who knew most of the people’s
9:272:22709:11:11:72:540:130:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:names and their kids, would say, ‘I don’t know any more than you do. But if you’re uncomfortable, do what makes
9:273:22820:11:11:72:540:119:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:you sleep at night.’ She wasn’t sleeping, either. ‘You went to work and you go hammered,’ the branch manager said
9:274:22933:11:11:72:540:108:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:later. ‘By the end of the day, you were exhausted. And you didn’t know if you had a job, or what was going on.’
9:275:23044:11:11:72:540:97:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:WaMu headquarters told the branches repeatedly that everything was fine, but the news reports and the blogs and
9:276:23155:11:11:72:540:86:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:the stories posted on Facebook all said otherwise. ‘You told the customers something, and then they watched the
9:277:23266:11:0:72:540:75:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:news, and then they would come back,’ the branch manager said. Many took their money out anyway.” (Grind,

10:279:23440:22:22:88:539:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Surprisingly, more than half of running WaMu depositors were in fact covered by FDIC insur-
10:280:23531:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:ance. Withdrawals by insured depositors could make sense if they worry the FDIC might tem-
10:281:23621:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:porarily freeze their accounts, or that it could not afford to cover WaMu’s insured deposits which
10:282:23719:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:were several times the Deposit Insurance Fund at the time, or simply as one depositor explained,
10:283:23815:22:22:72:254:599:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:they “just don’t want to deal with it.”
10:284:23854:22:22:88:539:577:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Iyer and Puri (2012) document the dynamic nature of an Indian bank run influenced by its
10:285:23942:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:depositors’ social network.  They also find that deposit insurance is only partially effective in
10:286:24039:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:preventing runs. Unlike in WaMu’s first run in July 2008, deposit balances of most depositors who
10:287:24136:22:22:72:349:511:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f6:ran on the Indian bank, did not return to pre-run levels.11
10:288:24195:22:22:88:539:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:O Grada and White(2003) find that the 1857 bank run on the Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank
10:289:24286:22:22:71:540:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:had an important time dimension: “In neither 1854 nor 1857 did depositors respond to a single
10:290:24379:22:21:71:539:445:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:signal that led them to crowd into banks all at once. Instead, panics lasted a few weeks, building
10:291:24477:21:22:71:540:424:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:and sometimes ebbing in intensity, and only a fraction of all accounts were closed.” They conclude
10:292:24575:22:22:71:539:402:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:that the 1857 run was driven by informational shocks in the face of asymmetric information about
10:293:24671:22:22:71:540:380:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the true condition of bank portfolios.Kelly and O Grada(2000) provides further evidence on
10:294:24761:22:38:71:269:358:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:information transmission during this run.

10:297:24912:22:22:71:539:269:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:banks, which include securitization vehicles and investment banks, provides short-term funding for
10:298:25010:22:22:71:539:247:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:long-term projects in a broad sense and has developed into an unregulated substitute to traditional
10:299:25109:22:22:71:539:225:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:commercial banks. With short-term funding contracts akin to demand deposits, these “shadow”
10:300:25200:22:22:71:305:203:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f6:banks are subject to runs with similar features.12
10:301:25250:22:19:88:539:181:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:In September 2008 the Securities and Exchange Commission conducted an audit of the collapse

10:304:25460:7:15:80:539:144:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:11In our main model with a single bank (which can be either liquid or illiquid), depositors return to the surviving
10:305:25575:15:11:72:540:129:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:bank once they endogenously learn it is liquid. In Section6.2 we introduce competing banks. There, withdrawing
10:306:25685:11:7:72:539:118:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:depositors never return to their original bank, which offers a possible rationale for the findings ofIyer and Puri(2012).
10:307:25806:7:15:80:539:111:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:12For instance,Gorton and Metrick(2011),Covitz, Liang, and Suarez(forthcoming), andAcharya, Schnabl, and

10:309:26016:11:0:72:478:85:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:and Taylor(2013) find that runs on ABCP are sensitive to leverage, asset values, and asset liquidity.
11:310:26118:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of Bear Stearns. Consistent with our modeling of dynamic nature of rumor, the executive sum-
11:311:26210:22:22:72:539:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:mary starts with: “During the week of March 10, 2008, rumors spread about liquidity problems at
11:312:26305:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Bear Stearns. As the rumors spread, Bear Stearns was unable to obtain secured financing from
11:313:26397:22:22:72:155:643:11:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:counterparties.”13
11:314:26415:22:22:88:539:621:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Given the sophisticated multi-layered structure of the modern financial system, “bank runs”
11:315:26506:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:can be interpreted broadly as funding withdrawals by one class of short-term lenders (i.e., not just
11:316:26606:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:household depositors) from other institutions. For instance, during the 2011 European sovereign
11:317:26701:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:debt crisis, money market funds (like depositors) divested from European banks. Fears of liquidity,
11:318:26800:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:or rollover risk, rather than solvency drove fund managers to cut their exposure to Spanish and
11:319:26895:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Italian banks.14Consistent with our model, this run was dubbed the “slow-motion” bank run in
11:320:26987:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the popular press, referring to its gradual nature: money market funds reduced their exposure
11:321:27080:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to all Eurozone banks by 37% from $453 billion to $287 billion between May and August 2011
11:322:27170:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(Chernenko and Sunderam(2012)). More interestingly, individual information acquisition played a
11:323:27265:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:crucial role, as fund managers each did their own research and came up with different conclusions,
11:324:27363:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:prompting some to run and others to rollover their investment.15Eventually, U.S. money market
11:325:27456:22:22:72:539:380:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:funds returned to the European money market.16Their return to these positions is hard to generate
11:326:27553:22:46:71:404:358:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:using existing models, but is a feature of ours, which we turn to next.
11:327:27624:46:32:71:445:312:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:3  The Base Model without Information Acquisition
11:328:27673:32:22:71:539:280:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We first build a rumor-based bank run model by introducing uncertainty into the asynchronous
11:329:27765:22:22:71:539:258:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:awareness setting ofAbreu and Brunnermeier(2003), which is our base setting without information
11:330:27860:22:22:71:539:236:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:acquisition. Most of the analysis here, such as learning and optimal withdrawal strategies, applies
11:331:27959:22:22:71:539:214:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to later situations with information acquisition. We show that, without information acquisition,
11:332:28055:22:22:71:540:192:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:eitherbank runs do not occur at all,ordepositors run on the bank immediately upon hearing the
11:333:28148:22:16:71:539:170:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:rumor. Therefore, bank runs, if they occur, exhibit an exogenous withdrawal speed, which implies

12:347:29260:22:22:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(depositors) with a zero discount rate. Bank deposits yield a constant rate of returnr >0when the
12:348:29357:22:22:72:540:547:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:bank is operating, while holding cash outside the bank earns nothing. Broadly, one can interpret the
12:349:29457:22:22:72:540:525:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:bank as some investment vehicle in the shadow banking system or even the entire financial system,
12:350:29554:22:22:72:540:503:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and the positive relative wedge reflects either a higher investment growth rate or a convenience
12:351:29650:22:22:72:540:481:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:yield for keeping funds in the institution.  Our main analysis focuses on a single bank, but we
12:352:29745:22:22:72:456:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:consider competing banks offering similar returns as an extension in Section6.2.
12:353:29825:22:22:88:539:437:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:To avoid exploding values for a dollar inside the potentially safe bank, we assume that the
12:354:29916:22:21:71:540:415:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:bank’s growth stops at some “maturing” event modeled as a Poisson shock with intensityδ > r, and
12:355:30012:21:22:72:539:394:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:afterwards the game ends (e.g., each agent gets his deposit back for consumption).17Throughout,
12:356:30107:22:38:71:470:372:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:this maturing event is independent of any other random variables that we consider.
12:357:30189:38:29:71:297:334:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f13:3.1.2  Uncertainty about Bank Liquidity
12:358:30228:29:21:71:539:305:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:There are two potential types of banks that are fundamentally solvent (i.e., bank survival is the
12:359:30325:21:22:71:539:284:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:first-best allocation), with one type of bank being “illiquid,” and a second “liquid” bank impervious
12:360:30426:22:22:71:539:262:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to runs. Uncertainty about bank liquidity is crucial to our analysis, though its source could be
12:361:30522:22:22:71:176:240:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f6:fundamental shocks.18
12:362:30543:22:22:88:539:218:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Bank liquidity is defined as the mass of depositors it takes to run down the bank. For simplicity,
12:363:30641:22:22:71:539:196:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:we assume a binary structure for the state of bank liquidity ̃κ. When the bank is illiquid, ̃κtakes a
12:364:30742:22:22:72:540:174:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:lower valueκL<1, and it fails when aκLmeasure of depositors have fully withdrawn their funds.
12:365:30835:22:16:72:540:152:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:One can literally interpret ̃κas the bank’s cash reserves to meet withdrawals. We broadly interpret
12:366:30934:16:15:80:539:136:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:17A similar but more natural interpretion is that individual agent suffers liquidity shocks with immediate consump-
12:367:31049:15:11:72:540:121:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:tion need (therefore withdrawal). The analysis, which is available upon request, is similar but much more complicated
12:368:31166:11:7:72:214:110:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:(due to the replacement of agents).
12:369:31201:7:15:80:539:103:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:18We consider uncertainty with known probabilities (risk). Generalizing our model to Knightian uncertainty might
12:370:31313:15:0:72:207:88:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:be interesting for future research.
13:371:31350:0:22:72:539:709:10:g_d0_f17:11:g_d0_f4: ̃κas the liquidity of the bank, which could represent uncertainty about the willingness of a lender
13:372:31450:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of last resort (e.g. central bank) to lend to bank (see footnote9 for an example). For the liquid
13:373:31547:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:bank with a higher liquidity reserve, ̃κ=κH> κL. We focus on the case that there is no run on
13:374:31640:22:22:72:539:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the liquid bank; hence for now it is useful to think ofκH>1, i.e. the sufficiently liquid bank can
13:375:31738:22:22:72:539:621:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:survive any severe run. However, in Section6.3.1we verify that our asynchronous awareness model
13:376:31833:22:22:72:353:599:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:can haveκH<1but still rule out runs on the liquid bank.
13:377:31888:22:22:88:539:577:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:In our economy, it is common knowledge that conditional on the liquidity event (to be introduced
13:378:31984:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:shortly), the probability of the illiquid state isp∈(0,1).When the illiquid bank fails, its assets
13:379:32082:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:have a fire-sale price to recoverγ∈(0,1)dollar for each dollar of deposits. Afterwards, all agents
13:380:32180:22:22:72:306:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:go to autarky consuming their remaining wealth.
13:381:32227:22:22:88:539:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We focus on uncertainty about liquidity for solvent banks for better comparison to the litera-
13:382:32321:22:22:72:539:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:ture.19Section2.2 documents that during the 2007/08 financial crisis, concerns regarding liquidity
13:383:32419:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of financial institutions are often highlighted among investors and regulators. No doubt, both sol-
13:384:32518:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:vency and liquidity are highly linked to bank fundamentals. In reality, banks are not just either
13:385:32615:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:solvent or insolvent; within solvent banks, there are strong ones and weak ones that differ in their
13:386:32715:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:fundamentals. Our modeling of liquid/illiquid banks can be equivalently interpreted as strong/weak
13:387:32813:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:banks. Indeed, as detailed in the next subsection, one can interpret the illiquid bank as an institu-
13:388:32914:22:22:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:tion whose capital base is hit by adverse shocks to its mortgage-backed securities, making it weak
13:389:33012:22:37:72:539:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:but still solvent. Later in Section6.1 we introduce fundamentally insolvent banks as an extension.
13:390:33110:37:29:72:430:277:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f13:3.1.3  Liquidity Event, Spreading Rumors, and Informed Agents
13:391:33171:29:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Att= 0the bank is liquid, i.e., ̃κ=κH. At some unobservable random time ̃t0>0referred to
13:392:33259:22:22:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:as the liquidity event, the bank may become illiquid, and the uncertainty is as modeled in Section
13:393:33357:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:3.1.2. Mapping to the 2007/08 crisis in which banks have opaque exposure to real estate, one may
13:394:33453:22:22:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:think of this event as the gradual deterioration of mortgage-backed securities which hurts banks’
13:395:33550:22:22:72:539:160:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:liquidity but keeps them solvent. Although the exact liquidity event timet0is publiclyunobservable,
13:396:33649:22:22:72:540:138:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:it is common knowledge that ̃t0is exponentially distributed on[0,∞)with cumulative distribution
13:397:33744:22:22:72:307:116:11:g_d0_f16:11:g_d0_f4:Φ (t0)≡1−e−θt0, whereθis a positive constant.
13:398:33789:22:16:88:540:94:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Knowledge of this liquidity event starts spreading in the population after ̃t0, i.e., some agents
13:399:33886:16:0:80:455:78:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:19For instance,Nikitin and Smith(2008) andGu (2011) focus on bank solvency information.
14:400:33975:0:22:72:539:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:hear a “rumor” that “the liquidity event ̃t0has occurred and thus the bank might be illiquid.”
14:401:34069:22:22:71:540:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Since the exact liquidity event time ̃t0is unknown, this spreading information captures the essence
14:402:34168:22:22:71:539:665:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of an unverified rumor of uncertain origin that spreads gradually in the depositor population.
14:403:34262:22:22:71:540:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Importantly, hearing the rumor informs the agent that “the liquidity event ̃t0has occurred and
14:404:34356:22:22:72:385:621:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:hence other agents in the population may have heard the rumor.”
14:405:34419:22:22:88:539:599:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We call those agents who hear the rumor “informed,” or simply “agents,” and the rest “unin-
14:406:34510:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:formed.” Since att= 0the bank is liquid, throughout we assume that agents’ beliefs are such that
14:407:34606:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:they stay inside the bank unless they hear the rumor. In Section6.3.2we show this is indeed the
14:408:34701:22:22:72:457:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:case under certain conditions, by analyzing the problem of an uninformed agent.
14:409:34780:22:22:88:539:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Given a realization of ̃t0=t0, the rumor begins to spread over an interval[t0,t0+η]with a
14:410:34869:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:positive constant (exogenous) lengthη. FollowingAbreu and Brunnermeier(2003) we refer toηas
14:411:34960:22:22:72:539:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the “awareness window.” At any interval[t,t+dt]wheret∈(t0,t0+η), uninformed agents become
14:412:35049:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:informed by hearing this rumor with probabilityβdt, whereβis an exogenous positive constant.
14:413:35141:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The rumor shock is i.i.d. across the population of uninformed agents. Then fort∈[t0,t0+η], the
14:414:35235:22:22:72:539:402:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:mass of uninformed and informed agents aree−β(t−t0)and1−e−β(t−t0)respectively, and the mass
14:415:35326:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of newly informed agents within[t,t+dt]isβe−β(t−t0)dt. To make the problem interesting, we
14:416:35416:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:assume that at timet0+ηthe fraction of informed agents, which is1−e−βη, is sufficient to take
14:417:35509:22:22:72:277:336:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:down the illiquid bank, i.e.,1−e−βη> κL.
14:418:35549:22:22:88:540:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:This spreading technology is different from that ofAbreu and Brunnermeier(2003) in that we
14:419:35639:22:22:72:539:292:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:allow for separation between the spreading rateβand the awareness windowη.20As shown later,
14:420:35730:22:22:72:435:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the awareness windowηhas interesting effects opposite to common wisdom.
14:421:35801:22:22:88:540:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Call the informed agent who hears the rumor atti≥t0simply agentti.  Consistent with
14:422:35884:22:22:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:electronic age banking, he neither observes withdrawals before him, nor the potential queue in
14:423:35978:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:front of the bank.  In the context of shadow banking, given the high frequency nature of repo
14:424:36071:22:22:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:financing, we assume that individual creditors do not observe, but do form rational expectations
14:425:36167:22:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:about, other creditors’ rollover decisions.  We share withAbreu and Brunnermeier(2003) the
14:426:36257:21:22:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:simplifying assumption that agents do not observe the market price of bank equity, which future
14:427:36352:22:16:72:297:117:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f6:work can introduce by adding noise to prices.21
14:428:36399:16:7:80:403:101:6:g_d0_f7:6:g_d0_f21:20Abreu and Brunnermeier assume a linear spreading technology with rate1
14:429:36471:7:10:398:540:94:6:g_d0_f22:9:g_d0_f8:ηso that the entire population is
14:430:36504:10:8:72:462:84:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:informed att0+η. This way, the awareness windowηis artificially tied to the spreading rate1η.
14:431:36597:8:0:80:539:76:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:21If investors trading in the stock market have the same information as depositors, then bank stock prices convey

15:433:36756:29:22:72:540:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:To eliminate strategies with infinite transactions, we assume a constant, yet arbitrarily small,
15:434:36852:22:22:72:539:658:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:transaction costcper dollar when the agent receives cash from, or deposits cash back in the bank—
15:435:36949:22:22:72:539:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:including the maturing event (so the agent receives1−cper dollar of deposit) or bankruptcy (so
15:436:37043:22:22:72:532:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:he receivesγ(1−c)). This assumption is innocuous as our analysis carries through whenc→0.
15:437:37132:22:22:88:539:592:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:In sum, after hearing the rumor an agent can withdraw his deposits whenever he believes bank
15:438:37224:22:22:72:540:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:failure is imminent, and redeposit this cash in the future if the bank’s survival sufficiently improves
15:439:37327:22:22:72:539:548:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:his posterior belief, both subject to a transaction costc. Due to the linearity of this problem, a
15:440:37425:22:22:72:510:526:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:“bang-bang” strategy, i.e. keeping the entire wealth either in or out of the bank, is optimal.
15:441:37519:22:22:88:539:504:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Our model allows for the possibility of depositors redepositing back to the bank, unlike exist-
15:442:37614:22:22:72:539:482:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:ing literature based on theDiamond and Dybvigmodel (e.g.,Green and Lin(2003),Gu (2011),
15:443:37701:22:22:72:540:460:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:etc). Though it is not necessary for our qualitative results, the redepositing option is empirically
15:444:37801:22:21:72:539:438:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:motivated and theoretically appealing. Redepositing behavior is apparent in Figure1, which shows
15:445:37897:21:22:72:540:417:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:that after the first run on WaMu, the bank regained much of its deposit base.  From a theory

19:607:44709:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:naive strategy may be suboptimal, but we will show that analyzing this naive strategy is of great
19:608:44806:22:22:72:257:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:help in analyzing the optimal strategy.
19:609:44845:22:22:88:539:665:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The following function captures the marginal impact of postponing withdrawal on the value of
19:610:44937:22:40:72:192:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the above naive strategy:

19:612:44990:40:21:71:540:563:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Specifically, we compare two strategies: one is withdrawing atτand staying outside untilζ, and
19:613:45084:21:22:71:539:542:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the other is staying inside the bank atτ, withdrawing a bit later atτ+dtand staying outside until
19:614:45181:22:22:71:539:520:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f4:ζ. The marginal cost is the transaction-cost adjusted expected loss due to potential bank failure
19:615:45278:22:22:71:539:498:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f4:h(τ) (1−γ) (1−c). The marginal benefit isr(1−c)̂VO(τ), because by waiting the deposited dol-
19:616:45370:22:22:71:540:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:lar grows at a rate ofr, and under the naive strategy each deposited dollar is taken out immediately
19:617:45470:22:22:71:475:454:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and worths(1−c)̂VO(τ)after transaction cost. Factoring out1−cwe obtaing(τ).
19:618:45545:22:22:88:540:432:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The functiong(τ)only applies to the naive strategy; however, Proposition2 shows that the
19:619:45633:22:22:72:540:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:sign ofg(τ)is the same as that of the first-order condition under the truly optimal strategy. What
19:620:45731:22:22:72:539:388:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:is behind this result is the optimality of threshold strategies, i.e., agents do not redeposit beforeζ.
19:621:45834:22:22:72:440:366:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:This also impliesVO(τ) =̂VO(τ)forτafter the optimal withdrawal timeτw.
19:622:45904:22:22:88:540:344:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f16:At the optimal withdrawal timeτw, we haveg(τw)  =  0.  SinceVI(τw)  =  (1−c)VO(τw)  =

19:630:46209:22:22:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:due to potential bank failure, while the right hand side is the marginal benefit of staying due to

20:650:47050:29:30:72:408:407:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We define a bank run equilibrium and a no run equilibrium as follows:

20:652:47212:22:22:72:540:355:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:in which informed agents’ strategies depend on the time since they heard the rumor, and the bank
20:653:47308:22:31:72:483:333:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:survival time is finite. Ano run equilibriumis when the bank survival time is infinite.
20:654:47395:31:22:88:539:302:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We focus on symmetric equilibria where ex ante identical agents take the same strategy. Sta-
20:655:47487:22:22:72:539:280:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:tionarity here means that agentti’s strategy depends onτ=t−ti, nott; it follows from the
20:656:47575:22:22:72:539:258:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:hazard rate’s independence of the absolute timetiat which the agent becomes informed. A bank
20:657:47667:22:22:72:540:236:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:run means the illiquid bank fails at a finitet0+ζ <∞, while a no run equilibrium means the
20:658:47757:22:22:72:540:214:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:bank survives forever. Of course, a no run equilibrium always exists without further refinements
20:659:47853:22:22:72:540:192:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:on the behavior of agents, since ignoring the rumor is an equilibrium for solvent-but-illiquid banks.
20:660:47954:22:16:72:454:170:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Throughout, our focus is on the existence and properties of bank run equilibria.
20:661:48034:16:14:80:539:154:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:25We emphasize that the sufficient parameter condition12, which facilitates our analysis with detailed functional
20:662:48147:14:11:72:540:140:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:forms greatly, is far from the tight necessary condition. The optimality of threshold strategy is fairly general as long

21:696:49418:22:22:71:539:301:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:First, since in equilibrium withdrawing agents hear the rumor over[t0,t0+ζ−τw](who then

21:699:49673:22:22:72:540:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:ratehin (3) as the cost. Given stationarity,̂VOas the value of an outside dollar over the time
21:700:49767:22:22:72:539:213:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f16:interval[τw,ζ]depends only on the differenceζ−τw. By Proposition 1the hazard rateh(τw;ζ)
21:701:49855:22:22:72:539:191:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:depends onζ−τwalone. In this economy, the underlying uncertainty is about the liquidity event

21:704:50134:22:22:72:540:125:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:absolute value oftishould not matter, and thus the hazard rate depends onζ−τwalone. The
21:705:50221:22:31:72:316:103:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:following lemma shows this general result formally:

22:712:50783:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:coincide, there does not exist any bank run equilibrium with endogenous waiting: either there is
22:713:50879:22:22:72:362:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:no bank run, or a bank run occurs without waiting (τw= 0).

22:739:51697:22:22:71:539:239:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:always want to wait, thus bank runs never occur. On the other hand, withdrawing earlier is optimal
22:740:51795:22:22:71:539:217:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:underG(τur)>0, implying immediate withdrawalsτw= 0in equilibrium, with an exogenous (or at

22:742:51980:22:22:72:539:173:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f18:zero, the equilibrium survival time mechanically depends only on the capacity of illiquid bankκL

22:744:52172:22:31:71:456:129:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:indifferent, thus equilibria are indeterminate. We have the following proposition.
22:745:52254:31:22:71:493:98:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f5:Proposition 3.The bank run equilibrium without information acquisition is as follows:
22:746:52339:22:0:71:539:76:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:1. IfG(τur)>0, the unique bank run equilibrium is that every informed agent withdraws immedi-
23:747:52434:0:22:72:409:708:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ately upon hearing the rumor, so thatτw= 0, andζ=τur=−ln(1−κL)β.
23:748:52498:22:22:72:334:686:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:2. IfG(τur)<0, a bank run equilibrium does not exist.
23:749:52551:22:22:71:539:664:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f16:3. If the primitive parameters are such thatG(τur) = 0, then in this knife-edge case, anyτw≥0
23:750:52644:22:30:71:314:642:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:andζ=τw+τurconstitute a bank run equilibrium.
23:751:52689:30:22:88:540:612:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Consider the second case in Proposition3. Hypothetically, imagine that each agent believes
23:752:52779:22:22:71:539:590:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:others are running immediately withτw=  0henceζ=τur.  BecauseG(τur)<0, each agent
23:753:52860:22:22:71:540:568:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:postpones withdrawal, say toτw= ∆>0.26But the aggregate withdrawal condition (AW) says
23:754:52946:22:22:71:540:546:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:that the survival time adjusts one-to-one toζ=τur+∆. Then, given the new bank survival time, the
23:755:53042:22:22:71:539:524:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:individual optimality condition (IO) implies that the new waiting time responds one-to-one again
23:756:53138:22:22:71:540:502:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:withτw= ∆ + ∆ = 2∆. Applying this thought experiment repeatedly implies that both waiting
23:757:53227:22:22:71:539:480:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:time and bank survival time are postponed indefinitely. Clearly, this logic reverses ifG(τur)>0,
23:758:53323:22:22:71:539:458:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:pushing agents to withdraw as early as possible—hence in equilibrium they withdraw upon hearing
23:759:53418:22:22:71:122:436:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the rumor.
23:760:53428:22:22:88:539:414:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The third knife-edge case is uninteresting, not only because of its indeterminacy of bank run
23:761:53521:22:22:71:539:392:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:equilibria but also because it holds only on a parameter space with zero measure. For the latter
23:762:53617:22:22:71:539:370:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:reason, the knife-edge case is not “generic,” and we only focus on generic equilibria throughout the

23:764:53735:45:33:71:383:303:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:4  The Model with Information Acquisition
23:765:53776:33:22:71:539:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:In the base model above, the aggregate withdrawal condition (AW) implies that the survival time
23:766:53871:22:22:71:540:248:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f4:ζresponds one-to-one to changes in the waiting timeτw, and vice versa according to the individual
23:767:53968:22:21:71:539:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:optimality condition (IO). This somewhat interlocked stationarity is behind the tension between
23:768:54063:21:22:71:517:205:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:conditions (AW) and (IO) that precluded bank runs with waiting except in a knife-edge case.
23:769:54154:22:22:88:540:183:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:In deriving the endogenous bubble burst time,Abreu and Brunnermeier(2003) resolves this
23:770:54241:22:22:71:539:161:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:issue by assuming that the bubble component of prices increases over time. As a result, the net
23:771:54336:22:22:71:539:139:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f18:benefit of attacking increases, so that in theindividual optimality conditionthe waiting timeτw
23:772:54431:22:22:71:540:117:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:responds less than one-to-one to the survival timeζ. In a bank run setting, this would be a hard
23:773:54527:22:16:71:539:95:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:assumption to swallow, which would require that the value of a dollar in a perfectly safe bank
23:774:54621:16:0:80:469:79:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:26Implicitly, it says thatG(τ∗r−∆) = 0which is the condition for the optimal withdrawal time.

24:796:55554:22:22:71:539:373:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:that are free from runs prone to runs, and shortens the survival time of failing banks. The point is
24:797:55654:22:22:71:539:351:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:that, although bank runs never exist if information acquisition is not possible, inefficient bank runs
24:798:55756:22:21:71:539:329:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:with endogenous waiting reemerge once we allow for the possibility of acquiring additional signals,
24:799:55855:21:38:71:490:308:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:because individual information acquisition imposes negative externalities on each other.
24:800:55943:38:29:71:369:270:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:4.1  Information Acquisition and Signal Structure

24:802:56085:22:22:71:539:219:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:type at some cost. For example, agents could spend time sifting through call reports, calling their
24:803:56184:22:22:71:539:197:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:branch manager, etc. To emphasize that it is the noisiness of the signal, rather than its precision,
24:804:56284:22:22:71:539:175:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:that plays the crucial role, we first assume a binary information acquisition structure: either no
24:805:56382:22:22:71:539:153:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:acquisition, or acquiring an additional signal with a fixed precisionq >0. We endogenizeqin
24:806:56473:22:22:71:325:131:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Section4.4 by assuming a quadratic acquisition cost.
24:807:56525:22:22:88:539:109:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Agents payχ >0per dollar of deposits for the additional signal. Supposeχis realtively small
24:808:56616:22:0:71:539:87:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:that when facing a bank run equilibrium it is optimal to acquire the signal. For tractability, the
25:809:56716:0:22:72:539:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:signal takes three possible values ̃y∈ {yL,yM,yH}with conditional probabilities as in Figure2.
25:810:56810:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:With probabilityq >0, the bank’s type is perfectly revealed by the signalyH(yL); while with
25:811:56901:22:22:72:539:665:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:probability1−q, the agent receives an uninformative “medium” signalyM(e.g., seeing mixed
25:812:56989:22:22:72:124:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:evidences).
25:813:57000:22:22:88:539:621:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Conditional on the bank’s state, the realizations of these signals are i.i.d. across agents. Uncon-
25:814:57099:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:ditionally, the signals are correlated across agents, as signals tend to be low (high) in the illiquid
25:815:57201:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(liquid) state. Hence there are more agents with unfavorable signals given the bank being illiquid,
25:816:57300:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:a feature captured by the simple signal structure in Figure2.27We emphasize that this signal
25:817:57392:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:structure is consistent with the fact documented in Section2.2, that during the Euro zone crisis,
25:818:57489:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:money market fund managers each did their own research and came up with different conclusions.
25:819:57583:22:22:88:540:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The analysis of optimal withdrawal strategies in Section3.3 applies once we condition on the
25:820:57675:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:signal realization. ForyH(yL) agents, we can simply replace the priorpwith0(1) in Proposition
25:821:57768:22:21:72:539:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:2. Agents withyHknow the bank is not subject to runs and thus stay inside the bank always. For
25:822:57862:21:40:72:341:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:agents withyL, it is optimal to withdraw immediately if
25:823:57917:40:0:208:271:384:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f16:g(0;p= 1) =

25:827:57955:40:22:72:540:344:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We will show later in Lemma 2 that in bank run equilibriumζ < η. Recallλ(1−γ)< rgiven
25:828:58040:22:39:72:508:322:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:condition (12), the condition (15) is implied by the following imposed parameter condition:
25:829:58131:39:40:242:369:283:11:g_d0_f16:11:g_d0_f14:(λ(1−γ)−r)eλη+r >0,
25:830:58150:40:22:72:539:243:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:which requires the loss1−γto be significant.28Finally, Proposition2 directly applies toyMagents,
25:831:58246:22:22:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and our later analysis focuses on their endogenous waiting timeτw, from which we omit the index
25:832:58341:22:14:72:272:199:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f4:Mfrom now on without risk of confusion.
25:833:58380:14:14:80:540:185:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:27More formally, we need the signal to be informative on average, i.e.,Cov[ ̃y, ̃κ]>0. Our results are robust to the
25:834:58496:14:8:72:434:171:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:introduction of richer signal structures with potentially multiple levels of medium signals.
25:835:58588:8:14:80:540:163:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:28In fact, (15) has to hold in any bank run equilibrium. As mentioned in Lemma2 later, generically (i.e. except
25:836:58699:14:11:72:540:149:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:for some zero measure sets of parameters), for bank run equilibrium to existyLagents must withdraw immediately

26:838:58868:0:29:72:399:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:4.2  Bank Run Equilibrium with Acquired Information
26:839:58919:29:22:72:540:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We now solve for the bank run equilibrium given that agents are acquiring signals upon hearing the

26:852:59340:28:22:72:539:506:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:As in Section3.4.1, the individual optimality and aggregate withdrawal conditions pin down the
26:853:59434:22:22:72:539:484:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:bank run equilibrium. We know thatyLagents withdraw immediately under (15). ForyMagents,

26:855:59579:22:22:88:539:440:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The ex post heterogeneity due to acquired noisy signals gives rise to an interesting twist in the

30:1064:67626:12:22:147:540:494:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f5:≥0, there are two equilibria: one where agents do not acquire information and the
30:1065:67707:22:28:71:522:472:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:bank does not fail, and the bank run equilibrium with information acquisition of Proposition4.

30:1083:68608:22:22:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:rules out bank runs given nobody knows exactly whether the bank is illiquid; or everybody acquires
30:1084:68706:22:22:72:540:225:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:information and runs on the bank according to their private signal, which justifies the acquisition
30:1085:68805:22:22:72:225:203:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of information in the first place.
30:1086:68839:22:22:88:540:181:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Proposition5 supposesG(τur)<0. Suppose insteadG(τur)≥0, i.e., bank runs occur even
30:1087:68921:22:22:72:540:159:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:if agents cannot acquire liquidity information and they are already withdrawing upon hearing
30:1088:69013:22:22:72:540:137:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the rumor.  The next corollary shows that in equilibrium agents acquire information, then run
30:1089:69106:22:22:72:539:115:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:immediately on the illiquid bank that generates equal (yM) or worse (yL) signals only.  Hence
30:1090:69199:22:22:72:540:93:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:in our model, in this case information acquisition has no effect on the existence of the bank run
30:1091:69296:22:0:72:346:71:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:equilibrium, nor on the survival time of the illiquid bank:

31:1097:69823:22:22:72:540:590:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:However, if without the additional information bank runs did occur, information acquisition could
31:1098:69920:22:22:72:540:568:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:mitigate runs on stronger banks.32Moreover, collecting information about bank solvency could be
31:1099:70015:22:22:72:315:546:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:socially beneficial, a topic we revisit in Section6.1.

31:1102:70253:22:22:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:acquisition offers perhaps the most natural way to introduce belief heterogeneity into the model.
31:1103:70350:22:21:72:539:458:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Exogenously endowed noisy signals, i.e.χ= 0, would suffice to generate the bank run equilibrium
31:1104:70445:21:22:72:540:437:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:with endogenous waiting. However, ifχ= 0, then there is another uninteresting equilibrium where
31:1105:70540:22:22:72:540:415:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:agents ignore their signals (so there is no bank run), in addition to the equilibria characterized in
31:1106:70641:22:22:72:539:393:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Proposition5. A strictly positive signal cost eliminates such an uninteresting equilibrium, because
31:1107:70740:22:38:72:331:371:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:agents do not acquire signals that they plan to ignore.

33:1225:74123:29:22:72:539:310:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Our model features both strategiccomplementarityandsubstitutabilityin information acquisition
33:1226:74216:22:22:72:540:288:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:among individual agents. For better understating, we first take the model in Section4.4 and study
33:1227:74313:22:21:72:539:266:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the comparative statics of the rumor spreading rateβand the awareness windowη. Recall that
33:1228:74403:21:22:72:539:245:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:relative toAbreu and Brunnermeier(2003), our model decouples the rumor spreading rate from
33:1229:74493:22:22:72:180:223:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the awareness window.
33:1230:74514:22:22:88:539:201:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The comparison between these two comparative static results are intriguing. The top panels
33:1231:74604:22:22:72:539:179:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of Figure4 shows that, intuitively, the greater the rumor spreading rateβ, the faster the illiquid
33:1232:74702:22:22:72:540:157:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:bank fails (Panel4a), and the greater precision the acquired signals (Panel4b). A surprising result
33:1233:74801:22:22:72:540:135:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:emerges when we turn to the awareness windowηin the bottom panels. Whenηincreases so that
33:1234:74890:22:22:72:540:113:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:everybody knows that potentially there will be more informed agents attacking the bank, each

34:1256:75691:22:22:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:earlier, and other depositors may have run on the bank for a longer time. As a result, conditional

34:1258:75856:22:22:88:539:418:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We have seen that in our bank run setting, information acquisition exhibits strategic comple-
34:1259:75949:22:21:72:539:396:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:mentarity regardingwhether to acquire information. This is evident from the existence of multiple
34:1260:76046:21:22:72:539:375:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:equilibria in Proposition5 with binary information choices: the information acquisition of other
34:1261:76142:22:22:72:540:353:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:agents makes a bank run possible, which prompts this agent to acquire his information as well. In
34:1262:76239:22:22:72:540:331:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:this way, acquisition of liquidity information can subject solvent but illiquid banks to runs. This
34:1263:76338:22:22:72:539:309:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:positive feedback effect shares the same spirit toHellwig and Veldkamp(2009) who show that, in
34:1264:76432:22:22:72:540:287:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:a static model, information acquisition exhibits complementarity if actions (in our model, running
34:1265:76530:22:22:72:211:265:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:on bank) are complementary.
34:1266:76557:22:22:88:539:243:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:In the setting with smooth information acquisition cost, (21) implies that individual information
34:1267:76654:22:22:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:acquisition exhibits strategic substitutability regardinghow much information to acquire. This is
34:1268:76751:22:22:72:540:199:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:because there is a natural public signal conveyed by the fact that the bank has not yet failed. If
34:1269:76849:22:22:72:540:177:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:others study more about the bank and run on the illiquid one, then the illiquid bank fails sooner.
34:1270:76947:22:22:72:540:155:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:As a result, this public signal becomes more informative—(21) suggests that the mere survival of
34:1271:77043:22:22:72:540:133:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the bank, upon hearing the rumor, leads the agent to perceive the bank to be stronger. Because
34:1272:77137:22:21:72:540:111:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:a more informative public signal lowers the value of private signals, individual agents hearing the
34:1273:77236:21:15:72:509:90:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f6:rumor respond to the public signal of “bank survival tillti” by acquiring less information.34
34:1274:77329:15:0:80:539:75:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:34This is similar to the effect of price information in a noisy Rational Expectation Equilibrium (REE) asset pricing
35:1275:77447:0:22:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The result thatηmitigates bank runs goes against the casual intuition that runs are more
35:1276:77535:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:severe with more prone-to-run agents, which stems from the premise that bank failure requires a
35:1277:77630:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:sufficient mass of running depositors. By contrast, we show that in a dynamic learning setting,
35:1278:77725:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:when cumulative informed agents are enough to run down the bank, artificially shortening the
35:1279:77817:22:46:72:516:621:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f6:awareness window gives rise to a novel information effect with the exact opposite direction.35
35:1280:77911:46:32:72:249:575:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:5  Empirical Predictions
35:1281:77935:32:22:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Beyond the empirical bank run evidence presented in Section2, our model offers additional insights
35:1282:78033:22:22:72:502:521:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:for future empirical research, especially for high-frequency deposits and withdrawals data.
35:1283:78124:22:22:88:539:499:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:First, our model makes several qualitative testable predictions about the nature of bank runs.
35:1284:78218:22:22:72:540:477:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Specifically, bank runs would empirically manifest as follows. There are two broad types of deposi-
35:1285:78317:22:22:72:540:455:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:tors, with one type better informed than the other. These better informed agents start withdrawing
35:1286:78415:22:22:72:540:433:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:first, then joined by less informed agents. Importantly, a unique prediction of our model is that
35:1287:78512:22:22:72:540:411:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:for banks that survive a run, we should observe some agents withdrawing at the same time other
35:1288:78606:22:22:72:540:389:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:agents are redepositing back into the bank. This cannot occur in a model where a homogeneous
35:1289:78698:22:22:72:451:367:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:depositor population responds to a common signal as inHe and Xiong(2012a).
35:1290:78772:22:22:88:539:345:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Second, our comparative statics generate testable predictions about how bank run dynamics
35:1291:78861:22:21:71:540:323:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:would respond to variation in key model parameters, such as those shown in Figure4.  Since
35:1292:78951:21:22:71:539:302:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:rumors are often not made public, it could be challenging to empirically measure the endogenous
35:1293:79046:22:22:71:540:280:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:withdrawal time and bank survival time. However, the remaining survival timeτr, which is the
35:1294:79138:22:22:71:539:258:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:difference between the endogenous withdrawal time and bank survival timeζ−τw, is free of this
35:1295:79231:22:22:71:539:236:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:issue. Given high-frequency depositor transaction data,τrcan be measured as the time between
35:1296:79323:22:20:71:539:214:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:when withdrawals begin and when the bank fails, or until redeposits begin for a surviving bank. In
35:1297:79421:20:11:72:539:194:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:models (e.g. Grossman and Stiglitz,1980). We thank an anonymous referee for pointing out the similarity between
35:1298:79532:11:7:72:396:183:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:“bank failure” in our model and “price” in a noisy REE model as public signals.
35:1299:79611:7:15:80:539:176:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:35One real world example of this point involves the subprime mortgage crisis. On May 17, 2007 Fed Chairman
35:1300:79717:15:11:72:540:161:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:Bernanke indicated in a speech about the subprime mortgage market that looser lending standards were pervasive
35:1301:79827:11:11:72:540:150:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:especially in loans originated in 2006 (Bernanke,2007).  The speech took place at a time when low teaser rates
35:1302:79937:11:11:72:540:139:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:on many adjustable-rate mortgages were set to expire, suggesting that the rise in defaults was just the tip of an
35:1303:80050:11:11:72:540:128:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:iceberg. Subsequently, asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) outstanding dropped from $1.3 trillion in July 2007
35:1304:80161:11:11:72:540:117:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:to $833 billion in December 2007 (Acharya, Schnabl, and Suarez,2013). One interpretation within our model of this
35:1305:80274:11:11:72:540:106:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:speech is that it signaled a relatively short awareness window, and there was not much to learn from the survival
35:1306:80387:11:11:72:540:95:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:of ABCP conduits up to that point in time. Suppose that instead that looser lending standards were pervasive in
35:1307:80498:11:10:72:540:84:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:loans originated since 2003. Having observed that the ABCP market kept growing despite this fact, investors would
35:1308:80611:10:0:72:458:74:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:perceive a high probability of the system being liquid and conclude that a run might not occur.

36:1330:81079:33:22:71:539:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:our model, the higher the rumor spreading speedβ, the faster the (illiquid) bank fails, the smaller
36:1331:81178:22:22:71:540:475:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the remaining survival time. The effect of bankruptcy recoveryγon the remaining survival time
36:1332:81271:22:22:71:539:453:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f4:τris also negative: a lower recoveryγprompts depositors to withdraw earlier, leading to a longer

36:1334:81450:22:22:88:539:409:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Third, our model has testable implications regarding the probability of bank runs. Proposition
36:1335:81544:22:22:71:539:387:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:6 characterizes different parameter regions in which a bank run can constitute an equilibrium. By
36:1336:81641:22:22:71:539:365:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:assigning a probability measure on the parameter space,36one can relate model parameters to the
36:1337:81736:22:21:71:539:343:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:likelihood of bank runs, which has a straightforward empirical counterpart. Consider, for example,
36:1338:81834:21:22:71:540:322:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the rumor spreading speed.  One can show that all else equal, a largerβmakes the condition
36:1339:81924:22:22:71:540:300:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f4:G(τur)≥0easier to satisfy; thus Proposition6 implies that bank runs are more likely. In the
36:1340:82015:22:22:71:539:278:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:working paper version of this article, which is listed as NBER Working Paper 18513, we also show
36:1341:82111:22:22:71:539:256:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:that the lower the information acquisition costα, the more likely is the bank run equilibrium. These
36:1342:82211:22:22:71:539:234:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:are testable predictions given proxies for the spreading speed or the cost of information. Approaches
36:1343:82312:22:22:71:539:212:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:for their measurement using social media and press coverage have been recently developed in the
36:1344:82407:22:22:71:277:190:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:asset pricing literature (e.g.Manela,2014).
36:1345:82450:22:22:88:539:168:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Finally, if our model withstands the above tests, one could use our structural framework to
36:1346:82541:22:22:71:539:146:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:estimate key model parameters.  For example, using the moment condition (17) of remaining
36:1347:82630:22:22:71:539:124:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:survival timeτr, one could estimate the expected deposit recovery rateγgiven bankruptcy as
36:1348:82720:22:16:71:327:102:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:perceived by depositors, a highly interesting quantity.
36:1349:82775:16:14:80:539:86:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:36In those parameter regions where multiple equilibria are possible, one need some exogenous sunspots with certain
36:1350:82889:14:0:72:258:72:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:likelihood to predict the equilibrium outcome.
37:1351:82937:0:33:72:289:709:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:6  Extensions and Discussions
37:1352:82966:33:22:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We study two extensions of our model with quadratic information acquisition cost. In Section6.1
37:1353:83061:22:22:72:540:654:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:we introduce fundamentally insolvent banks, so that it is alsosociallyefficient for individual agents
37:1354:83162:22:22:72:539:632:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to acquire information and run on insolvent banks. Section6.2 considers a two-bank economy where
37:1355:83258:22:22:71:539:610:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:competition amplifies the individual agent’s socially wasteful information production. Finally we
37:1356:83355:22:38:71:296:588:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:provide discussion on several theoretical issues.
37:1357:83404:38:29:71:296:550:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:6.1  Insolvent Banks and Stress Tests
37:1358:83441:29:29:71:381:521:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f13:6.1.1  Solvency information versus liquidity information
37:1359:83497:29:22:71:539:492:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Suppose that the bank might becomeinsolventat the timet0, which randomly fails (rather than
37:1360:83588:22:21:71:539:470:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:matures) with intensityξ > rand recovers nothing. Of course the bank can also be solvent, and if
37:1361:83684:21:22:71:347:449:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:so it can be either liquid or illiquid as we modeled before.
37:1362:83744:22:22:88:539:427:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:When agenttihears the rumor, the possibility of insolvency motivates him to spend a fixed

37:1364:83926:22:22:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:whether the bank is solvent or not. We focus on situations where the agent acquires this solvency
37:1365:84023:22:22:72:540:361:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:signal1s(which is optimal if the default intensityξis sufficiently high). Hence after hearing the
37:1366:84120:22:22:72:540:339:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:rumor, all agents will figure out the bank’s insolvency and run on the insolvent bank immediately.
37:1367:84218:22:22:88:539:317:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The information regarding bank solvency is both socially and individually valuable. In contrast,
37:1368:84314:22:22:72:540:295:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the information regarding bank liquidity is individually valuable but socially destructive when
37:1369:84409:22:22:72:540:273:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:agents realize that runs on the illiquid bank become a concern. We aim to capture the fact that
37:1370:84504:22:22:72:540:251:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:bank solvency information and liquidity information are naturally linked when individual agents
37:1371:84599:22:22:72:165:229:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:are acquiring them.
37:1372:84618:22:22:88:539:207:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We assume that a by-product of the agent’s private learning about bank solvency, i.e., collecting
37:1373:84715:22:21:72:540:185:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the solvency signal1s, is that he also learns something about the liquidity of the bank. To model
37:1374:84812:21:22:72:540:164:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:this, we assume that given the efforteof acquiring1s, if the bank turns out to be solvent, then the
37:1375:84911:22:22:72:539:142:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:baseline qualityqof the bank’s liquidity signaly—which is the signal we modeled in Section 4.1—is
37:1376:85008:22:18:71:540:120:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:juste. As a result, the agent’s additional liquidity information precision choice isq≥ewith cost

37:1379:85111:0:27:113:539:103:8:g_d0_f19:11:g_d0_f4:2. The interpretation is that the process of collecting insolvency information inevitably
37:1380:85200:27:0:72:540:76:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:teaches the agent something about bank liquidity. The more effort that the agent spends in figuring
38:1381:85301:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:out whether the bank is insolvent, the more he knows about the bank’s liquidity. Our modeling
38:1382:85394:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:that the effort of collecting insolvency information (i.e.,e) becomes the baseline quality of liquidity
38:1383:85497:22:37:72:314:665:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:information captures this idea in the simplest way.
38:1384:85548:37:29:72:285:628:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f13:6.1.2  Policy Implication: Stress Tests
38:1385:85587:29:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The above setting has important implications for stress tests in revealing the fundamentally prob-
38:1386:85685:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:lematic banks. Byproviding insolvency information alone, the government can use stress tests to
38:1387:85780:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:reduceeto eliminate runs on solvent-but-illiquid banks. According to our model, if a great effort is
38:1388:85880:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:required to learn about whether the bank is insolvent (say institutions like Lehman), i.e., a higher
38:1389:85980:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f4:e, then each agent will be automatically endowed with significant information about the liquidity
38:1390:86077:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of solvent banks (say institutions like Citibank with weak liquidity condition). As a result, runs on
38:1391:86178:22:22:72:519:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:solvent banks may start, which pushes each agent to acquire even more liquidity information.
38:1392:86270:22:22:88:540:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Stress tests provide transparency on potentially insolvent banks (Bernanke,2009), and therefore
38:1393:86365:22:22:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:reducee. Government, by providing higher quality information about banks’ insolvency, can crowd
38:1394:86460:22:22:72:540:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:out private acquisition of insolvency information. Because public information can be better targeted
38:1395:86560:22:22:72:540:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:at insolvency alone, while the process of private acquisition of solvency information inevitably
38:1396:86656:22:22:72:540:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:reveals liquidity information, public provision of solvency information helps all agents know that
38:1397:86754:22:21:72:540:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:other agents do not have superior information regarding banks liquidity situation. Therefore, our
38:1398:86851:21:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:model suggests that the public provision of insolvency information indirectly reduces the socially
38:1399:86949:22:22:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:wasteful information acquisition regarding liquidity, and therefore make runs on illiquid banks less
38:1400:87049:22:22:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:likely. Figure 6 plots the equilibrium signal precision when we varyewhich measures the extent of
38:1401:87146:22:22:72:266:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:public provision of solvency information.
38:1402:87187:22:22:88:539:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:This view is consistent with the Federal Reserve Board’s recent break from the traditional
38:1403:87277:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:supervisory view of opaqueness in favor of more public disclosure to restore the confidence of
38:1404:87371:22:22:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:investors.  However, our rationale is different than the one described byBernanke(2010) who
38:1405:87462:22:22:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:argues that transparency allows for scrutiny by outside analysts, which enhances the credibility
38:1406:87558:22:22:72:540:138:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of the tests. Instead, we argue that by providing more information, the government crowds out
38:1407:87651:22:22:72:540:116:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the information collection effort by individuals about the solvency of the banks, and the perfect
38:1408:87748:22:16:72:539:94:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:revelation of insolvent bank clarifies the channel that we are emphasizing.37Since liquidity and

39:1433:88505:22:37:72:519:500:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:collection about bank liquidity and therefore reducing the incidence of runs on illiquid banks.
39:1434:88600:37:29:72:241:463:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:6.2  Multiple Solvent Banks
39:1435:88627:29:22:72:540:434:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We now investigate the model with competing solvent banks.  Instead of holding cash, a bank
39:1436:88718:22:22:72:540:412:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:run in this setting involves the transfer of deposited funds from one illiquid bank to another more
39:1437:88817:22:22:72:540:390:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:liquid one. Information is privately more valuable in this setup since the outside option is a nearly
39:1438:88918:22:22:72:540:368:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:identical bank rather then holding cash.  Here, the two banks’ difference might be minuscule,
39:1439:89011:22:22:72:540:346:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and transfers between the two institutions only involve social losses (transaction fees and bank
39:1440:89107:22:22:72:540:324:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:failure). Apparently, if only one of the multiple competing banks could be potentially illiquid, then
39:1441:89208:22:22:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:redepositing back to the surviving bank becomes off-equilibrium, as it is optimal to stay inside the
39:1442:89308:22:22:72:540:280:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:liquid competing bank. This might be the underlying reason for the finding of Iyer and Puri (2012)
39:1443:89406:22:22:72:443:258:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:that only 10% of running depositors’ bank balances return to pre-crisis levels.
39:1444:89485:22:22:88:539:236:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f14:Suppose there are two banks, ex-ante identical except half the population deposits in bankA
39:1445:89576:22:22:72:539:214:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and half deposits in bankB. Both banks promise the same rate of returnr. However, transferring
39:1446:89670:22:21:72:539:192:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:funds between banks requires a transaction costc. A liquidity event occurs at a random timet0,
39:1447:89764:21:22:72:540:171:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and a rumor starts that exactly one of the banks is illiquid (withκL) while the other is liquid (with
39:1448:89865:22:21:72:540:149:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f4:κH). The prior probability that each bank is illiquid isp= 0.5since they are ex-ante identical. The
39:1449:89964:21:11:72:539:128:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:bank quality once the stress test isolates those insolvent ones. When the planner variese, agents can always perfectly
39:1450:90082:11:11:72:540:117:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:spot insolvent banks, therefore the channel of insolvency information is shut down. Rather, the channel is through
39:1451:90196:11:11:72:540:106:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:the strategic interaction of individual agents, as now everybody knows that everybody will wait to see the stress test
39:1452:90314:11:11:72:540:95:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:instead of scrambling to search the insolvent banks. As a result, everybody will have less precise information on
39:1453:90427:11:0:72:304:84:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:which solvent bank is less liquid and susceptible to a run.
40:1454:90488:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:learning process in the two bank set-up is simpler, because the passage of time without a failure
40:1455:90585:22:22:72:380:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:teaches agents nothing about the relative viability of their bank.
40:1456:90651:22:22:88:539:665:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Agents can acquire a costly signal ̃y∈ {yL,yM,yH}about their bank with probability distri-

40:1458:90835:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:withdraw; agents who receive theyMsignal gain no useful information and staying in their original
40:1459:90932:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:bank is optimal; and agents withyLsignals run on their bank immediately.38Proposition 7in the

40:1461:91098:22:22:88:539:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:In this setting, information acquisition to figure out the relative liquidity position of two solvent
40:1462:91199:22:22:71:539:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:banks is socially undesirable, as it shortens the survival time of the illiquid bank by inducing more
40:1463:91300:22:22:71:539:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:agents to realize that one bank strictly dominates the other. Thus it is socially beneficial to blur the
40:1464:91404:22:22:71:539:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:differences between competing solvent banks. Consider the Capital Purchase Program commonly
40:1465:91495:22:22:71:539:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:known as the bailout of the nine largest U.S. financial institutions on October 13, 2008. When
40:1466:91589:22:21:71:539:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:presenting the program to the CEOs of the 9 banks, Secretary of Treasury Henry M. Paulson was
40:1467:91682:21:22:71:539:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:concerned the strongest banks (e.g.  JPMorgan) would not participate.  To make sure they do,
40:1468:91774:22:22:71:539:402:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:government officials suggested that if a bank refused the funds, its regulator would later force it to
40:1469:91876:22:22:71:539:380:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:raise capital anyway and under worse terms.39The government was in fact injecting noise about
40:1470:91969:22:22:71:539:358:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the liquidity of competing solvent banks into the economy. By pooling banks together the incentive
40:1471:92067:22:38:71:539:336:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to transfer funds between them was kept low enough so that none of the nine banks suffered a run.

40:1476:92432:22:17:71:539:181:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:relative to the one in the static setting (e.g.,Diamond and Dybvig(1983),Goldstein and Pauzner
40:1477:92526:17:14:80:539:164:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:38From the perspective ofyLagents, the value of a dollar in their bank falls and the value of a dollar in the

40:1480:92851:11:7:72:420:126:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:this setup since the outside option is a nearly identical bank rather then holding cash.

40:1482:93046:15:11:72:540:104:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:wanted to be sure he would accept the capital.” “Look, we’re making you an offer,” I said, jumping in. “If you don’t

41:1486:93493:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:withdrawals, our rich dynamic setting gives a non-trivial minimum reserve threshold that eliminates
41:1487:93592:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the run equilibrium. In other words, even for the illiquid bank, the minimum reserve requirement
41:1488:93688:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to fence off bank runs,κL, is below1which is the level that is sufficient to cover all potential
41:1489:93784:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:withdrawals.  As fully analyzed in the working paper version NBER Working Paper 18513 and
41:1490:93873:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:explained briefly in AppendixB.1, this result is rooted in the uncertainty over the timing of liquidity
41:1491:93976:22:22:72:486:577:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:event and other depositors’ withdrawal timings in our asynchronous awareness setting.
41:1492:94061:22:22:88:540:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Following the same logic, there exists a minimum reserve threshold forκH, so that rumor-based
41:1493:94154:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:bank runs never occur for the liquid bank as long asκHis above this threshold. This result justifies
41:1494:94254:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the assumption that staying in the bank is optimal given ayHsignal (and hence the bank is liquid),
41:1495:94352:22:37:72:488:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:which we have taken as given in Section4.1. For detailed argument, see AppendixB.1.
41:1496:94435:37:29:72:289:452:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f13:6.3.2  What about uninformed agents?
41:1497:94471:29:22:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Uninformed agents play no role in our analysis of rumor-based bank runs. So far, we have assumed
41:1498:94567:22:22:72:540:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:that uninformed agents remain fully deposited before they hear the rumor.  We now provide a
41:1499:94658:22:22:72:540:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:justification for the optimality of this strategy. Uninformed learning is more complicated because,
41:1500:94757:22:22:72:540:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:in addition to the failure hazard rate, they keep updating the rumor arrival rate, i.e. the probability
41:1501:94860:22:21:72:540:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of hearing the rumor in the next instant given no bank failure and no rumor. Nevertheless, because
41:1502:94958:21:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:it does not matter much whether an agent hears the rumor inside or outside the bank (up to small
41:1503:95054:22:22:72:490:292:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:transaction costs), the rumor arrival rate plays a minor role in the withdrawal decision.
41:1504:95143:22:22:88:539:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The failure hazard rate from the perspective of uninformed agents, on the other hand, is im-
41:1505:95235:22:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:portant even when transaction costs vanish. Importantly, the failure hazard rate converges to zero
41:1506:95333:22:22:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:ast→ ∞; a formal analysis is available upon request. Intuitively, as time passes and uninformed
41:1507:95428:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:agents observe no failure and no rumor, they will attach a higher and higher probability to the
41:1508:95523:22:22:72:539:182:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:event that ̃t0already happened (and they missed the rumor), but the bank is liquid so no failure
41:1509:95619:22:22:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:occurs. Similar to the analysis for informed agents in (11), an uninformed agent will stay inside
41:1510:95716:22:39:72:347:138:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the bank from timetgoing forward if the following holds:
41:1511:95772:39:0:208:539:99:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f4:hU(s) (1−γ) (1−c)≤rUI(s)fors≥t,(22)
42:1512:95809:0:22:72:539:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:wherehU(s)andUI(s)are the failure hazard rate and the value of an inside dollar perceived
42:1513:95898:22:22:72:539:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:by uninformed agents.  Since whent→ ∞the failure hazard rate decreases to zero, while the
42:1514:95987:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:right hand sideUI(s)> pγ(1−c) + (1−p)(1−c)δδ−r,40condition (22) must hold for anytsuch that
42:1515:96078:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f16:11:g_d0_f4:0≤tf≤t <∞, for some finitetf. In fact, for the parameters chosen to illustrate our results, the
42:1516:96173:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:maximum hazard rate is sufficiently low thattf= 0, i.e. it is always optimal for uninformed agents
42:1517:96271:22:46:72:195:599:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to remain fully deposited.
42:1518:96297:46:32:72:173:553:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:7  Conclusion
42:1519:96310:32:22:72:540:521:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We study above new dimensions of bank runs, previously unexplored, by focusing on information
42:1520:96403:22:22:72:540:499:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:acquisition in rumor-based runs.  Our model incorporates uncertainty and information acquisi-
42:1521:96496:22:22:72:540:477:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:tion about bank liquidity into the asynchronous awareness framework ofAbreu and Brunnermeier
42:1522:96588:22:22:72:540:455:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(2003). Information acquisition about liquidity exposes otherwise safe banks to destructive runs
42:1523:96684:22:22:72:540:433:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:with endogenous waiting through a “fear-of-bad-signal-agents” effect: agents unsure about bank
42:1524:96778:22:22:72:540:411:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:liquidity worry that agents who receive worse signals withdraw before them, which increases their
42:1525:96875:22:22:72:540:389:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:own incentives to run. Even in the situation where runs never occur without information acqui-
42:1526:96969:22:22:72:540:367:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:sition, this effect of information acquisition results in a unique and interior bank run equilibrium
42:1527:97069:22:22:72:262:345:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:with an endogenous bank survival time.
42:1528:97107:22:21:88:539:323:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We use our model to analyze the role that government information policy can play in bank run
42:1529:97199:21:22:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:prevention, when solvency is uncertain, and in a multiple bank setting. Empirically, our model
42:1530:97293:22:22:72:540:280:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:sheds new light on both traditional bank runs and debt runs more broadly.  Our model makes
42:1531:97383:22:22:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:new predictions linking the likelihood of a run to the spreading rate of the rumor, the cost of
42:1532:97478:22:22:72:540:236:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:acquiring information, and the recovery value in case of bankruptcy. It also generates the unique
42:1533:97575:22:22:72:540:214:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:prediction that for banks that survive a run, we should observe agents withdraw at the same time
42:1534:97671:22:22:72:540:192:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:earlier informed agents redeposit. Our model is flexible and rich enough for structural estimation
42:1535:97769:22:22:72:540:170:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:or calibration of its parameters given detailed withdrawals data, which can result in meaningful
42:1536:97865:22:22:72:540:148:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:policy implications. In the Appendix, we discuss the possibility of depositors choosing the optimal
42:1537:97964:22:16:72:540:126:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:time to acquire signals (SectionB.2), and the possibility of endogenizing the rumor spreading speed
42:1538:98063:16:15:80:539:110:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:40The lower bound for the valueUI(s)is achieved under the simple strategy of never withdrawing from the bank,
42:1539:98172:15:11:72:540:95:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:and assuming that the illiquid bank fails immediately. This is a lower bound because i) the illiquid bank survives
42:1540:98286:11:11:72:540:84:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:for a while; and ii) at any later time, the posterior probability of an illiquid bank conditional on no failure is weakly
42:1541:98407:11:0:72:462:73:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:lower than their priorp(similar to the effect in (21); the formal proof is available upon request).
43:1542:98508:0:22:72:138:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(Section B.3).
43:1543:98522:22:22:88:539:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:More broadly, the dynamic bank run model we provide above can shed new light on other
43:1544:98607:22:56:72:524:665:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:economic settings such as arbitrageur behavior, currency attacks, and R&D investment games.

49:1965:112294:29:13:72:540:267:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:First note that theGfunction is the mirror image of individual FOC condition function, i.e.,

49:1967:112471:31:31:72:417:223:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f5:Corollary 2.G(τr)crosses zero from above at most once onτr∈[0,ζ].
49:1968:112536:31:15:88:476:192:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:This result implies that the following holds for the three cases of the proposition:

49:1973:112635:11:17:178:539:177:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f4:≤0, thenG(τr)≤0for allτr≥τlr. Thus if all other agents strategy is to

49:1975:112803:13:14:71:310:147:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Therefore,ζ∗→∞and no run equilibrium exists.

49:1978:113028:14:15:71:471:106:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:earlier. Therefore, agents withdraw immediately in the only symmetric equilibrium.

52:2360:118581:13:14:88:539:260:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:In general, due to the asynchronous nature of our rumor-based setting, even without information
52:2361:118676:14:13:71:539:246:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:acquisition, immediate withdrawal after hearing the rumor might not be an equilibrium. Similar to
52:2362:118773:13:14:71:540:233:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the insight ofAbreu and Brunnermeier(2003), this is because the depositor knows that the bank
52:2363:118866:14:14:71:539:219:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:survives for a while, a feature absent in any static bank run setting. Thus, eliminating dynamic
52:2364:118962:14:13:71:533:205:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:rumor-based runs requires less liquidity reserve than the one suggested by the static perspective.
52:2365:119060:13:14:88:540:192:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Here is an outline on how to determine the threshold thresholdκHso that there never exist runs
52:2366:119154:14:13:71:539:178:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:on the liquid bank. Our information structure in Figure2 implies that the agent withyHknows the
52:2367:119249:13:14:71:538:165:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f18:bank is liquid for sure. More importantly, the agent knows that he is among theqfraction ofyH
52:2368:119342:14:13:71:540:151:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:agents, and there are1−qfraction of informed agents with medium signalsyM. We are interested
52:2369:119434:13:14:71:540:138:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:in the equilibrium behavior ofyHagents who endogenously wait a while to withdraw, by holding
52:2370:119526:14:13:71:540:124:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the belief that1−qfraction ofyMagents withdraw immediately upon hearing the rumor. Thus,
52:2371:119614:13:17:71:539:111:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f4:yHagents face a tradeoff similar to (11). This harshest belief regardingyMagents allows us to
52:2372:119707:17:7:80:388:94:6:g_d0_f7:5:g_d0_f27:41In this two-bank setting we no longer impose the restriction ofq≤κL

52:2374:119815:8:0:72:373:79:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:onlyyLagents are withdrawing to potentially take down the illiquid bank.
53:2375:119889:0:14:72:539:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:determine the upper bound of theκHthreshold that rules out runs byyHagents. Interestingly, this
53:2376:119984:14:14:72:539:695:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f18:is in the same nature as the equilibrium for the illiquid bank studied in the main model, whereyL

53:2381:120377:29:14:72:540:588:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We have so far assumed agents acquire the additional signalyimmediately upon hearing the
53:2382:120465:14:14:72:540:574:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:rumor. Although early information allows for a superior action, there is an option value derived
53:2383:120561:14:13:72:540:560:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:from waiting to acquire the signal later: the agent learns from the passage of time that the bank is
53:2384:120661:13:14:72:539:547:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:more likely to be liquid, and the bank might fail (thus making the additional signal unnecessary).

54:2460:122749:13:15:72:539:564:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:withdrawing dominates acquiring it just after. Using the fact thatVI(τw|yM) = (1−c)VO(τw|yM),

54:2463:123034:13:14:71:539:522:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:who withdraws, acquires information, and then redeposits would waste the transaction cost, but

54:2466:123236:13:14:88:539:481:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We could also allow agents to acquire signals more than once. But if we impose, as one should, a
54:2467:123332:14:13:71:539:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:small fixed cost of acquiring information, we get in equilibrium a finite number of such acquisitions.
54:2468:123434:13:14:71:539:454:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:After these, the population is fully described by the same three types (yL,yM,yH) as in the main

54:2471:123645:29:13:71:539:373:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:One can extend our model by linking the spreading speed to the fraction already informed, which
54:2472:123740:13:14:71:540:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:leads the equilibrium fraction of informed agents to be anS-shaped function in the spreading time.
54:2473:123838:14:13:71:539:346:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Such a modification only makes the conditional distribution for ̃t0in (2) more complicated, but
54:2474:123933:13:14:71:232:333:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:would not affect our main results.
54:2475:123967:14:13:88:540:319:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A more ambitious/interesting extension would be to follow the spirit ofBanerjee(1993) by

54:2486:124237:15:13:71:540:276:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:withdrawal shown in Figure3. As a result, the rumor spreading speed depends on not only the
54:2487:124328:13:14:71:539:263:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:underlying bank liquidity ̃κ, but also the endogenous equilibrium waiting timeτwofyMagents.
54:2488:124419:14:13:71:539:249:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Both can be viewed as amplification forces.  First, sinceyLagents immediately withdraw only
54:2489:124510:13:14:71:539:236:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:when the bank is illiquid, relative to the case of ̃κ=κHthe rumor spreads faster, giving rise
54:2490:124603:14:14:71:539:222:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of a more severe run on the illiquid bank. Second, ifyMagents wait a bit longer to withdraw,
54:2491:124695:14:13:71:539:208:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the rumor spreading speed is slower, and thus the illiquid bank will survive longer, feeding back
54:2492:124792:13:14:71:539:195:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to later withdrawal ofyMagents. Although mathematically challenging, the critical feature for
54:2493:124885:14:13:71:539:181:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:our analysis, that the hazard rates depend only on time elapsed since hearing the rumor, would
54:2494:124979:13:14:71:539:168:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:be preserved. As a result, with the aid of numerical methods one can analyze such settings with
54:2495:125074:14:0:71:398:154:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:endogenous rumors, and we leave this possibility for future research.
55:2496:125145:0:33:72:281:709:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:C  Non-stationary Equilibria
55:2497:125173:33:14:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We consider the non-stationary part of the model here.  Ift0< η, then some early informed

55:2499:125355:13:14:72:539:649:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:However, as shown inAbreu and Brunnermeier(2003), those early agents will be bunching together
55:2500:125449:14:13:71:418:635:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to eliminate the non-stationarity. We modify their results to our setting.

55:2503:125704:13:14:71:539:595:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:rumor exactly atτr. The strategy of the agent who hears rumor atτris that, independent of signal
55:2504:125800:14:14:71:539:581:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(yLoryM) he will withdraw atτr+τw=ζ. Moreover, for agents who hear rumor atti∈[τr,ζ],
55:2505:125885:14:13:71:540:567:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:they take the following strategy. If they receiveyLsignal then he will withdraw atζ, while if they
55:2506:125983:13:14:71:539:554:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:getyMsignal then they withdraw atti+τw. This additional modification is because relative to
55:2507:126074:14:13:71:454:540:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Abreu and Brunnermeier(2003) agents may have different signals in our model.
55:2508:126150:13:14:88:540:527:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:For illustration, suppose thatt0= 0so the bank should fail atζ. Recall that there areqmeasure

55:2551:127765:14:13:72:540:188:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:bank being illiquid is alwayŝp0. Also, we have to fix the signal quality structureqto be the same
55:2552:127863:13:14:72:540:175:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:as in the stationary phase. We deem these technical issue non-essential for the economic questions
