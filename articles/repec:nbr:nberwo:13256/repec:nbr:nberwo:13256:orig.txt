2:29:1363:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:This paper examines the empirical anomaly that in a sample of 5811 patents on which US faculty are
2:30:1461:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:listed as inventors, 26% of the patents are assigned solely to firms rather than to the faculty member's
2:31:1565:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:university as is dictated by US university employment policies or the Bayh Dole Act. In this paper
2:32:1663:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:we estimate a series of probability models of assignment as a function of patent characteristics, university
2:33:1771:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:policy, and inventor fields in order to examine the extent to which outside assignment is nefarious
2:34:1870:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:or comes from legitimate activities, such as consulting. Patents assigned to firms (whether established
2:35:1973:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:or start-ups with inventor as principal) are less basic than those assigned to universities suggesting
2:36:2075:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:these patents result from faculty consulting. A higher inventor share increases the likelihood of university
2:37:2183:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:assignment as compared with assignment to a firm in which the inventor is a principal but it has no
2:38:2282:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:effect on consulting with established firms versus assignment to the university. Faculty in the physical
2:39:2386:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:sciences and engineering are more likely to assign their patents to established firms than those in biological
2:40:2496:14:28:72:115:434:12:Times:12:Times:sciences.

3:58:2850:0:19:72:146:709:121:Times:121:Times:1. Introduction 
3:59:2866:19:19:108:533:690:121:Times:121:Times:The role of universities in industrial innovation has long been a topic of keen interest to academ-
3:60:2965:19:19:72:534:671:121:Times:121:Times:ics, practitioners, and policy makers. Despite extensive research, there is still much that we do not under-
3:61:3073:19:19:72:527:652:121:Times:121:Times:stand, in large part because knowledge flows do not always leave a publicly accessible “paper trail.” In 
3:62:3178:19:19:72:535:633:121:Times:121:Times:this regard, patents are a useful tool as citations to prior patents or publications provide such a trail. Thus 
3:63:3290:19:19:72:528:614:121:Times:121:Times:much of our understanding of the impact of academic research on industrial innovation comes from the 
3:64:3391:19:19:72:532:595:121:Times:121:Times:literature on spillovers, which is based on citations to university assigned patents (e.g., Henderson et al., 
3:65:3501:19:19:72:539:576:121:Times:121:Times:1998; Jaffe, 1989; Jaffe et al., 1993; Trajtenberg et al., 1997). The contribution of other mechanisms such 
3:66:3609:19:18:72:524:557:121:Times:121:Times:as consulting, sponsored research, and licensing has relied on the analysis of proprietary data from sur-
3:67:3714:18:19:72:533:539:121:Times:121:Times:veys or interviews (e.g., Cohen et al., 1998; Mansfield, 1995; Mowery et al., 2001; Thursby et al., 2001; 
3:68:3820:19:19:72:537:520:121:Times:121:Times:Thursby and Thursby, 2004; Zucker and Darby, 2006). A key insight from the latter stream of research is 
3:69:3924:19:19:72:505:501:121:Times:121:Times:that faculty themselves, rather than their disembodied work, often play a critical role in university-
3:70:4026:19:19:72:539:482:121:Times:121:Times:industry technology transfer. In this paper, we focus on faculty inventors and show that patent data, when 
3:71:4133:19:19:72:528:463:121:Times:121:Times:collected not by assignee, but by inventor, provide a more comprehensive picture of the contribution of 
3:72:4237:19:19:72:366:444:121:Times:121:Times:universities to industrial patenting than is commonly understood.   
3:73:4305:19:19:108:523:425:121:Times:121:Times:We examine a sample of 5811 US patents on which one or more of the inventors were faculty 
3:74:4395:19:19:72:519:406:121:Times:121:Times:members of 87 PhD granting departments of Research I universities at the time of patent application. 
3:75:4496:19:19:72:534:387:121:Times:121:Times:Only 62.4 percent of these patents were assigned solely to universities. This is a remarkably low percent-
3:76:4602:19:19:72:537:368:121:Times:121:Times:age since employment contracts in US universities specify that inventions resulting from faculty research 
3:77:4708:19:19:72:541:349:121:Times:121:Times:belong to the university when university resources are used in the research. Further, the Bayh-Dole Act of 
3:78:4815:19:19:72:532:330:121:Times:121:Times:1980 allows universities to own and patent the intellectual property (IP) resulting from federally-funded 
3:79:4921:19:19:72:518:311:121:Times:121:Times:research and, in the case of industry sponsored research, US universities historically have insisted on 
3:80:5025:19:19:72:225:292:121:Times:121:Times:ownership (Thursby et al., 2001).  
3:81:5060:19:19:108:530:273:121:Times:121:Times:An immediate implication of this low percentage is that the common practice of identifying US 
3:82:5154:19:19:72:535:254:121:Times:121:Times:university patents by institutional assignment misses a surprisingly large percentage of inventive activity 
3:83:5262:19:19:72:532:235:121:Times:121:Times:by faculty in US universities. Others have found a similar phenomenon in Europe where the majority of 
3:84:5364:19:19:72:523:216:121:Times:121:Times:patents listing faculty as inventors are assigned outside the inventors’ universities (Crespi et al., 2006; 
3:85:5472:19:19:72:527:197:121:Times:121:Times:Geuna and Nesta, 2006; Saragossi and van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie, 2003).  It is important to recog-
3:86:5576:19:19:72:527:178:121:Times:121:Times:nize, however, that until recently professor privilege (faculty ownership of inventions) was common in 
3:87:5679:19:19:72:538:159:121:Times:121:Times:Europe so that inventors typically assigned patent rights to their research sponsors rather than to their uni-
3:88:5789:19:19:72:480:140:121:Times:121:Times:versities (Geuna and Nesta 2006). This of course cannot explain the phenomenon in the US. 
3:89:5879:19:19:108:529:121:121:Times:121:Times:It is therefore important to ask why the faculty in our data assign patents outside the university. 
3:90:5979:19:19:72:532:102:121:Times:121:Times:While patents assigned outside may legitimately belong to the university, our interviews with university 
3:91:6084:19:0:72:531:83:121:Times:121:Times:technology transfer, industry personnel and faculty inventors suggest that the bulk of this assignment re-
4:92:6191:0:19:72:532:709:121:Times:121:Times:sults from faculty consulting. In this paper we estimate a series of probability models of assignment as a 
4:93:6298:19:19:72:538:690:121:Times:121:Times:function of patent, university, and inventor characteristics in order to examine the extent to which outside 
4:94:6407:19:19:72:425:671:121:Times:121:Times:assignment is nefarious or comes from legitimate activities, such as consulting.  
4:95:6489:19:19:108:539:652:121:Times:121:Times:Our main regression is a multinomial logit model in which assignment can be of four types: 1) as-
4:96:6586:19:19:72:530:633:121:Times:121:Times:signment to a university, 2) assignment to a firm in which the inventor is a principal, 3) assignment to a 
4:97:6693:19:19:72:524:614:121:Times:121:Times:firm in which the inventor is not a principal, or 4) the patent is unassigned and therefore owned by the 
4:98:6798:19:19:72:523:595:121:Times:121:Times:inventor(s). Any type of assignment other than assignment to a university can result from a number of 
4:99:6900:19:19:72:529:576:121:Times:121:Times:scenarios, some legitimate and some not. In our analysis we rely on patent characteristics to make infer-
4:100:7005:19:18:72:525:557:121:Times:121:Times:ences in this regard. In particular, we argue that where the research is conducted determines legitimate 
4:101:7110:18:19:72:529:539:121:Times:121:Times:assignment. Since university research tends to be more basic or fundamental than industry research, we 
4:102:7213:19:19:72:534:520:121:Times:121:Times:would expect patents based on research in university labs to be more basic than those resulting from con-
4:103:7318:19:19:72:534:501:121:Times:121:Times:sulting in firm labs. Thus if firm-assigned patents are more incremental than university-assigned patents, 
4:104:7425:19:19:72:531:482:121:Times:121:Times:we infer that they are the result of consulting. In contrast, if firm-assigned patents are similar to or more 
4:105:7535:19:19:72:528:463:121:Times:121:Times:fundamental than those assigned to universities, the inference is that they may have emanated from uni-
4:106:7638:19:19:72:527:444:121:Times:121:Times:versity labs. In the regression analysis, we find that the patents assigned to firms are indeed more incre-
4:107:7745:19:19:72:530:425:121:Times:121:Times:mental than those assigned to universities. Thus, our results support Thursby and Thursby’s (2005) con-
4:108:7848:19:19:71:520:406:121:Times:121:Times:jecture that firm assignment is primarily the result of consulting. Moreover, we show that while some 
4:109:7950:19:19:71:534:387:121:Times:121:Times:firm assignments may be nefarious, simply assuming that outside assignment represents inventor circum-
4:110:8052:19:19:71:538:368:121:Times:121:Times:vention of university policy, as do Audretsch et al. (2006) and Markman et al. (2006) can be misleading.1 
4:111:8157:19:19:107:522:349:121:Times:121:Times:From a policy perspective, one of the interesting university factors we consider is the share of 
4:112:8254:19:19:71:528:330:121:Times:121:Times:revenue from licensing that accrues to the inventor when inventions are assigned to and licensed by the 
4:113:8358:19:19:71:529:311:121:Times:121:Times:university. If, as in Jensen and Thursby (2001) and Lach and Schankerman (2004) faculty respond to fi-
4:114:8460:19:19:71:524:292:121:Times:121:Times:nancial incentives associated with licensing, faculty would be more likely to disclose inventions to the 
4:115:8565:19:19:71:525:273:121:Times:121:Times:university the higher is their share of any revenue the university earns from licensing those inventions. 
4:116:8671:19:19:71:526:254:121:Times:121:Times:Further, in Jensen et al.’s (2006) theoretical analysis of consulting, faculty are less likely to consult the 
4:117:8781:19:19:71:535:235:121:Times:121:Times:higher is the inventor’s share of revenue. In our regression analysis, a higher inventor share increases the 
4:118:8890:19:19:71:517:216:121:Times:121:Times:likelihood of university assignment as compared with assignment to a firm in which the inventor is a 
4:119:8991:19:19:71:531:197:121:Times:121:Times:principal but it has no effect on assignment to a university versus other firms or on ownership of the pat-
4:120:9098:19:19:71:525:178:121:Times:121:Times:ent by the inventor (unassigned patents). This suggests two possibilities. First, faculty in low share uni-
4:121:9205:19:27:71:521:159:121:Times:121:Times:versities may be more willing to seek outside remuneration via assignment to a start-up firm in which 
4:122:9307:27:8:216:219:132:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
4:123:9355:8:16:72:535:124:42:Times:100:Times:1 In Audretsch et al.’s (2006) survey of scientists funded by the National Cancer Institute nearly 30% of the faculty 
4:124:9473:16:11:71:540:108:100:Times:100:Times:inventors had at least one patent assigned to a firm rather than a university. Markman et al.’s (2006) study of patents 
4:125:9593:11:12:71:536:97:100:Times:100:Times:of faculty in 54 universities finds that 33% of patents are assigned outside the university. Both studies assume these 
4:126:9712:12:11:71:539:85:100:Times:100:Times:assignment involve circumvention of the university’s technology transfer office. Thursby and Thursby (2005) report 
4:127:9827:11:0:71:339:74:100:Times:100:Times:that 29% of the patents in their sample had been assigned to firms. 
5:128:9896:0:19:72:528:709:121:Times:121:Times:they are a principal.2 Second, revenue shares may have little if any effect on start-up activity, but rather 
5:129:10005:19:19:71:526:690:121:Times:121:Times:simply reduce the number of inventions that are disclosed to the university. Thus, our results on shares 
5:130:10110:19:19:71:223:671:121:Times:121:Times:may reflect either or both effects.  
5:131:10147:19:19:108:537:652:121:Times:121:Times:We also find significant differences between faculty in the physical sciences and engineering ver-
5:132:10245:19:19:71:521:633:121:Times:121:Times:sus those in biological sciences and between faculty in high quality versus lower quality departments. 
5:133:10348:19:19:71:535:614:121:Times:121:Times:Significant differences are found between assignment by faculty in public versus private universities and 
5:134:10454:19:19:71:306:595:121:Times:121:Times:between universities in urban versus rural locations.  
5:135:10509:19:19:108:531:576:121:Times:121:Times:The work closest to ours is Jensen et al. (2006) which presents a theoretical model of faculty re-
5:136:10607:19:18:71:532:557:121:Times:121:Times:search and consulting, as well as an empirical analysis of faculty publications and patents from 8 US Re-

5:146:11376:19:19:108:531:368:121:Times:121:Times:The passage of the Bayh-Dole Act in 1980 contributed to a landscape of federal court cases and 
5:147:11471:19:19:72:533:349:121:Times:121:Times:scientific developments (particularly in biotechnology) in which universities have increased their claims 
5:148:11577:19:19:72:539:330:121:Times:121:Times:on intellectual property (Mowery et al., 2001).  The Act gave US universities the right to own and license 
5:149:11684:19:19:72:536:311:121:Times:121:Times:the results from federally funded research. In return for this right, the university is required to file for pat-
5:150:11797:19:19:72:527:292:121:Times:121:Times:ent protection for patentable inventions and to share a portion of any license revenue with the inventor. 
5:151:11903:19:19:108:541:273:121:Times:121:Times:Since then there has been a dramatic growth in university licensing through university technology 
5:152:12001:19:19:71:530:254:121:Times:121:Times:transfer offices (TTO).  These are the offices responsible for evaluating inventions and applying for pat-
5:153:12107:19:19:71:531:235:121:Times:121:Times:ents. They are, however, dependent on university researchers to disclose when they think they have a re-
5:154:12211:19:19:71:525:216:121:Times:121:Times:search result with commercial potential. With few exceptions university employment contracts require 
5:155:12312:19:19:71:537:197:121:Times:121:Times:that employees disclose such information to the TTO as the university owns patentable research based on 
5:156:12416:19:19:71:533:178:121:Times:121:Times:university resources.3 Not surprisingly, however, the TTO personnel interviewed in an earlier study indi-
5:157:12521:19:19:71:533:159:121:Times:121:Times:cated that they believe less than half of the faculty inventions with commercial potential are disclosed to 
5:158:12629:19:20:71:542:140:121:Times:121:Times:their office (Thursby et al., 2001).  In some cases faculty may not realize the commercial potential of their

5:160:12787:7:16:72:539:113:42:Times:100:Times:2 Di Gregorio and Shane (2003) find an inverse relationship between start-up activity and inventor share. This result 
5:161:12905:16:7:71:423:97:100:Times:100:Times:differs from ours in that they consider only inventions that are owned by the university. 
5:162:12995:7:16:72:526:90:42:Times:100:Times:3 To our knowledge, the University of Wisconsin is the only major research university to allow for faculty owner-
5:163:13108:16:0:71:357:74:100:Times:100:Times:ship but this ownership does not extend to federally funded inventions. 
6:164:13181:0:19:72:535:709:121:Times:121:Times:ideas, but often they do not disclose inventions because they are unwilling to become involved in the uni-
6:165:13287:19:19:72:535:690:121:Times:121:Times:versity licensing process. Some faculty may prefer not to become involved in patenting and commerciali-
6:166:13390:19:19:72:521:671:121:Times:121:Times:zation altogether, but some who are interested in commercialization may avoid the TTO because they 
6:167:13489:19:19:72:542:652:121:Times:121:Times:consider the office difficult to work with or they may simply want to avoid foregoing the share of revenue 
6:168:13596:19:19:72:503:633:121:Times:121:Times:from commercialization that would accrue to the university or TTO (Thursby and Thursby, 2005; 
6:169:13690:19:19:72:535:614:121:Times:121:Times:Audretsch et al., 2006).  Thus a portion of the patents in our data that are assigned to firms may be inven-
6:170:13798:19:19:72:412:595:121:Times:121:Times:tions that emanated from university labs and that are illegitimately assigned.  
6:171:13878:19:19:108:536:576:121:Times:121:Times:We interviewed TTO professionals, industry R&D personnel and faculty inventors and asked for 
6:172:13971:19:18:72:530:557:121:Times:121:Times:their explanation for the outside assignments. The primary reason given by all three groups was consult-
6:173:14075:18:19:72:521:539:121:Times:121:Times:ing. As such, the research did not use university resources.4 For start-up companies that are originally 
6:174:14180:19:19:71:536:520:121:Times:121:Times:based on a faculty member’s research, it is common for the inventor to serve as a board member or scien-
6:175:14284:19:19:71:541:501:121:Times:121:Times:tific advisor and spend time in the company. In this case, our interviews showed that although the original 
6:176:14392:19:19:71:538:482:121:Times:121:Times:patent(s) may be licensed from the university, the follow-on patents on research conducted in the start-up 
6:177:14499:19:19:71:537:463:121:Times:121:Times:are legitimately assigned to it.  Further, our discussions indicated that continued faculty consulting is con-
6:178:14609:19:19:71:515:444:121:Times:121:Times:sidered vital to the commercialization efforts of the university invention (Fuller and Thursby, 2007). 
6:179:14712:19:19:107:535:425:121:Times:121:Times:There are also cases where patents resulting from projects using university resources might be le-
6:180:14810:19:19:71:520:406:121:Times:121:Times:gitimately assigned outside the university. Typically TTOs patent only a portion of the inventions dis-
6:181:14913:19:19:71:521:387:121:Times:121:Times:closed to them, effectively shelving those that they have no interest in licensing (Macho-Stadler et al, 
6:182:15018:19:19:71:535:368:121:Times:121:Times:2005). In the case of shelved disclosures, the TTO may decide to turn over ownership of the invention to 
6:183:15123:19:19:71:541:349:121:Times:121:Times:the inventor. In our database, 5.6 percent of the inventions are unassigned, which means that the invention 
6:184:15231:19:19:71:541:330:121:Times:121:Times:is owned by the inventor (though not all of these are likely to be shelved inventions). Also a portion of the 
6:185:15341:19:19:71:521:311:121:Times:121:Times:assignments to firms with inventors as principals may be shelved patents that the inventor assigned to 
6:186:15444:19:19:71:532:292:121:Times:121:Times:her/his start-up. Finally, when university research is sponsored by a company, it is possible for resulting 
6:187:15552:19:19:71:520:273:121:Times:121:Times:patents to be assigned to both the university and the firm. If the company sponsoring the research has 
6:188:15655:19:19:71:532:254:121:Times:121:Times:considerable background IP for the research, the university may agree on sole assignment to the firm. In 
6:189:15760:19:19:71:371:235:121:Times:121:Times:our regression analysis, we exclude patents with joint assignments.  
6:190:15829:19:19:107:531:216:121:Times:121:Times:If the research activity is consulting then, according to our interviews, assignment will be to the 
6:191:15929:19:19:71:533:197:121:Times:121:Times:firm for which the consulting was conducted. If the consulting is within the limits of the number of days 
6:192:16035:19:19:71:530:178:121:Times:121:Times:allowed by the university, then the activity and assignment are legitimate. Note, as well, that consulting 
6:193:16142:19:19:71:532:159:121:Times:121:Times:with firms in which the inventor is a principal is legitimate.  Moreover, as shown by Mansfield’s survey 
6:194:16247:19:31:71:539:140:121:Times:121:Times:(1995), consulting projects are generally more incremental (less fundamental or basic) than those originat-
6:195:16354:31:8:216:219:109:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
6:196:16402:8:16:72:523:101:42:Times:100:Times:4 In our interviews with university licensing professionals, we discovered that increasingly university policies in-
6:197:16518:16:11:72:536:85:100:Times:100:Times:clude a clause stating that faculty should not enter into contracts that violate their employment agreement. Thus fac-
6:198:16636:11:0:72:525:74:100:Times:100:Times:ulty are being advised against sharing IP developed in their labs outside the formal technology transfer channels. 
7:199:16752:0:19:72:534:709:121:Times:121:Times:ing in university labs, so that the resulting patents should be more incremental than those assigned to the 
7:200:16860:19:19:72:522:690:121:Times:121:Times:university. In other words, if the research activity is consulting, then we would expect the patent to be 
7:201:16966:19:19:72:421:671:121:Times:121:Times:assigned to a firm and to be more incremental than university assigned patents. 
7:202:17046:19:19:108:534:652:121:Times:121:Times:In contrast, if firm-assigned patents rightly belong to the university, the underlying research will 
7:203:17147:19:19:72:537:633:121:Times:121:Times:have been conducted in a university lab. Unless the faculty members who circumvent the university TTO 
7:204:17249:19:19:72:530:614:121:Times:121:Times:conduct research that differs systematically from the research of those faculty members who disclose to 
7:205:17353:19:19:72:522:595:121:Times:121:Times:the TTO, these patents should have the same characteristics as patents assigned to the university. This 
7:206:17457:19:19:72:524:576:121:Times:121:Times:along with Mansfield’s results suggests that university-assigned patents and illegitimate firm-assigned 
7:207:17561:19:18:72:534:557:121:Times:121:Times:patents would be more basic than the firm-assigned patents associated with consulting. If faculty circum-
7:208:17666:18:19:72:541:539:121:Times:121:Times:vent the TTO with some patents and not others, the natural assumption is that they circumvent the process 
7:209:17772:19:19:72:535:520:121:Times:121:Times:for their most important patents rather than the more incremental ones. Thus a finding that firm-assigned 
7:210:17878:19:19:72:542:501:121:Times:121:Times:patents generally are more incremental than university assigned patents would lead us to conclude that the 
7:211:17985:19:19:72:531:482:121:Times:121:Times:assignments are legitimate. Note that it may be legitimate because it reflects consulting or it may reflect 
7:212:18093:19:19:72:532:463:121:Times:121:Times:patents on inventions that the TTO deemed were unimportant. The latter may be included among the un-
7:213:18193:19:19:72:199:444:121:Times:121:Times:assigned patents in our data.

7:216:18242:19:19:108:529:387:121:Times:121:Times:To create a sample of faculty patents we matched the last names of the 34,202 scientists and en-
7:217:18338:19:19:72:535:368:121:Times:121:Times:gineers in Ph.D. granting departments of the 87 US Research I Universities in 1993 with names of inven-
7:218:18441:19:19:72:529:349:121:Times:121:Times:tors on US patents.5 The faculty names are from the National Research Council (1995). By area, 35.9% 
7:219:18542:19:19:71:528:330:121:Times:121:Times:were in the physical sciences, 24.3% in engineering and 39.8% in biological sciences. We compare fac-
7:220:18643:19:19:71:523:311:121:Times:121:Times:ulty names with inventor names listed in the National Bureau of Economic Research Patent Database. 
7:221:18742:19:19:71:525:292:121:Times:121:Times:This database provides not only inventor names and locations but also measures of the importance and 
7:222:18843:19:19:71:537:273:121:Times:121:Times:generality of patents (Hall et al., 2001).  To make our problem manageable we use the NBER patent data-
7:223:18946:19:19:71:524:254:121:Times:121:Times:base only for those patents applied for in 1993 and/or granted in 1997 or 1999 (after eliminating dupli-
7:224:19050:19:19:72:527:235:121:Times:121:Times:cates). Since the NBER patent database includes only patents granted by 1999 we supplement that data 
7:225:19151:19:19:72:537:216:121:Times:121:Times:with all patents granted in 2004.6 From the NRC survey we know that a faculty member is at a respective 
7:226:19255:19:19:72:522:197:121:Times:121:Times:university in 1993 (the year of the survey). For any patent application year other than 1993, we had to 
7:227:19359:19:19:72:539:178:121:Times:121:Times:independently verify that the faculty member was still associated with their university of record. Thus our 
7:228:19467:19:27:72:535:159:121:Times:121:Times:choice of patents applied for in 1993 greatly reduced our data collection efforts. Using patents granted in

7:230:19623:8:16:72:529:124:42:Times:100:Times:5 To reduce this problem to a manageable level, our approach was, primarily, a match of faculty with inventors lo-
7:231:19737:16:11:71:539:108:100:Times:100:Times:cated in the same state as the university. For example, we match inventors in Massachusetts with the R1 universities 
7:232:19854:11:12:71:529:97:100:Times:100:Times:in Massachusetts. In those states with universities located close to state borders we also include inventors in those 
7:233:19972:12:7:71:140:85:100:Times:100:Times:bordering states. 
7:234:19990:7:0:72:363:78:42:Times:100:Times:6 This latter data was made available to us by Professor Bhaven Sampat. 
8:235:20063:0:19:72:510:709:121:Times:121:Times:1997, 1999 and 2004 gives us a distribution of patent applications across most years from the early 
8:236:20163:19:19:72:527:690:121:Times:121:Times:1990’s until 2004 (see Table 1). From this initial match we eliminated those for whom first and middle 
8:237:20266:19:19:72:528:671:121:Times:121:Times:names or initials did not match. Unfortunately, it is not common for either the NRC or the patent office 
8:238:20371:19:19:71:525:652:121:Times:121:Times:lists to include complete first, middle and last names, and, in some cases, we had only first and middle 
8:239:20476:19:19:72:536:633:121:Times:121:Times:initials. We then eliminated common names. Our elimination filter was conditional on whether or not we 
8:240:20579:19:19:72:535:614:121:Times:121:Times:had more than initials for first names and/or middle names; that is, the filter was less dense when we had 
8:241:20686:19:19:71:531:595:121:Times:121:Times:more than initials. We further reduced the file by calculating the distance between the zip code of the in-
8:242:20793:19:19:72:530:576:121:Times:121:Times:ventor’s city and the zip code of the faculty member’s university. We eliminated matches where the dis-
8:243:20896:19:18:72:480:557:121:Times:121:Times:tance was more than 50 miles. In our data the average zip code distance is less than 7 miles.

8:246:21121:19:19:72:540:501:121:Times:121:Times:ther than 1993 was the following. If the assignment was to the inventor’s 1993 university we assumed the 
8:247:21226:19:19:71:530:482:121:Times:121:Times:inventor was with the university. If the assignment was not to that university, we used a combination of 
8:248:21331:19:19:71:521:463:121:Times:121:Times:web searches and the faculty listing in the National Faculty Directory to verify affiliation. If we deter-
8:249:21437:19:19:71:539:444:121:Times:121:Times:mined that a faculty member was on the faculty in any year after 1993 we assumed she was on the faculty 
8:250:21541:19:19:71:523:425:121:Times:121:Times:in the intervening years between 1993 and the latter year. A more detailed description of our selection 
8:251:21645:19:19:71:249:406:121:Times:121:Times:algorithm is provided in the Appendix.7 
8:252:21684:19:19:107:535:387:121:Times:121:Times:Our sample purposely excludes faculty who do not patent. Our interests are only in those faculty 
8:253:21781:19:19:71:527:368:121:Times:121:Times:whose work can result in commercializable inventions. By restricting our sample to those who success-
8:254:21882:19:19:71:534:349:121:Times:121:Times:fully patent we have clearly excluded any faculty whose work is not of immediate commercial relevance 
8:255:21984:19:19:71:521:330:121:Times:121:Times:to industry. We have also excluded faculty whose work might be of interest to industry but has not re-
8:256:22086:19:19:71:542:311:121:Times:121:Times:sulted in patentable and patented inventions. We have no way of separating faculty whose work is close to 
8:257:22192:19:19:71:523:292:121:Times:121:Times:the interests of industry but who do not patent from those whose work is not of commercial interest to

8:261:22346:19:19:107:534:216:121:Times:121:Times:Our matching process produced 6472 patent/inventor pairs, 5818 unique patents and 2900 differ-
8:262:22440:19:19:71:529:197:121:Times:121:Times:ent inventors. A single patent was held by 56.2% of the inventors, 19.4% had 2 patents, 9.3% had 3 pat-
8:263:22543:19:19:71:466:178:121:Times:121:Times:ents and 15.0% had 4 or more including a dozen inventors with 20 or more patents each.  
8:264:22631:19:19:107:455:159:121:Times:121:Times:Patent assignments were examined and assignees were categorized as follows: 
8:265:22707:19:13:125:326:140:121:Times:121:Times:1. assigned to not-for-profit organizations,  
8:266:22752:13:12:125:267:127:121:Times:121:Times:2. assigned to for-profit firms, 
8:267:22784:12:18:125:198:115:121:Times:121:Times:3. unassigned, 
8:268:22798:18:7:216:219:97:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
8:269:22846:7:16:72:530:90:42:Times:100:Times:7 We did not employ the Soundex name matching methodology of Trajtenberg, Shiff & Melamed (2006) since we 
8:270:22952:16:0:71:541:74:100:Times:100:Times:are interested in a random sample of faculty patents rather than the universe of a particular faculty members patents.  
9:271:23073:0:12:126:320:709:121:Times:121:Times:4. assigned to both firms and non-profits,  
9:272:23116:12:13:126:457:697:121:Times:121:Times:5. assigned to the federal government or the government and non-profits. 
9:273:23188:13:13:71:74:684:121:Times:121:Times: 
9:274:23188:13:19:71:539:671:121:Times:121:Times:Since the not-for-profit organizations are almost always a university or university hospital we shall hence-
9:275:23296:19:19:71:532:652:121:Times:121:Times:forth refer to not-for-profit assignments as university assignments. Six hundred and twenty-one (10.7%) 
9:276:23400:19:19:71:531:633:121:Times:121:Times:patents had 2 or more assignees. For 7 of the patents the assignee could not be categorized. These seven 
9:277:23505:19:19:71:240:614:121:Times:121:Times:patents are dropped from the sample.  
9:278:23543:19:19:107:529:595:121:Times:121:Times:Table 1 gives the number of patent applications by year and the assignment percentages accord-
9:279:23637:19:19:71:541:576:121:Times:121:Times:ing to this categorization.8 Across all years 26% of patent assignments are solely to firms while 62.4% are 
9:280:23745:19:18:72:526:557:121:Times:121:Times:assigned solely to universities. The percentage assigned to firms increases over the years of the sample 
9:281:23850:18:19:72:533:539:121:Times:121:Times:and the percentage assigned to universities falls accordingly. The unassigned and federal government as-
9:282:23954:19:19:72:214:520:121:Times:121:Times:signments are relatively stable.  
9:283:23988:19:19:108:405:501:121:Times:121:Times:                                                    (Insert             Table             2             about             here)             
9:284:24128:19:19:108:537:482:121:Times:121:Times:Table 2 tabulates patent/inventor pairs by the major program area of the inventors (biological sci-
9:285:24227:19:19:72:540:463:121:Times:121:Times:ences, engineering and physical sciences). Note that the point of reference here is the patent/inventor pair, 
9:286:24337:19:19:72:531:444:121:Times:121:Times:thus the assignment percentages in Table 2 differ slightly from those in Table 1 where the point of refer-
9:287:24443:19:19:72:534:425:121:Times:121:Times:ence is the patent. Patent/inventor pairs are least likely to come from the physical sciences: 25.4% of the 
9:288:24551:19:19:72:537:406:121:Times:121:Times:pairs are from inventors from physical sciences while 35.7% of faculty in the NRC study are in the physi-
9:289:24656:19:19:72:526:387:121:Times:121:Times:cal sciences. Engineering faculty account for 24.3% of the NRC faculty, but they account for 38.9% of 
9:290:24758:19:19:72:539:368:121:Times:121:Times:the pairs in our sample. Biological sciences are 39.8% of the NRC faculty, and they account for 35.7% of 
9:291:24863:19:19:72:537:349:121:Times:121:Times:the pairs. When we consider assignment, biological science faculty are least likely to assign to a firm and 
9:292:24971:19:19:72:527:330:121:Times:121:Times:most likely to assign to a university. Only 14.2% of the biological science assignments are to for-profit 
9:293:25077:19:19:72:536:311:121:Times:121:Times:firms whereas the percentage for the other fields is around 30%. The percentage assigned to firms by bio-
9:294:25182:19:19:72:512:292:121:Times:121:Times:logical science faculty is statistically significantly smaller (1% level) then those for the other fields. 
9:295:25289:19:19:108:533:273:121:Times:121:Times:What is not shown in the table is the fact that firm assignment by engineering faculty has grown 
9:296:25386:19:19:72:535:254:121:Times:121:Times:steadily over the period of our sample from about 25% of patents in the earliest years to over 35% of pat-
9:297:25492:19:19:72:522:235:121:Times:121:Times:ents in the last years. Firm assignment by physical science faculty was fairly constant at about 25% to 
9:298:25596:19:19:72:536:216:121:Times:121:Times:30% but it jumped in the last years to over 35%. There is little variation in firm assignment by biological 
9:299:25704:19:19:72:249:197:121:Times:121:Times:science faculty over the sample period.  
9:300:25745:19:19:108:405:178:121:Times:121:Times:                                                    (Insert             Table             3             about             here)             
9:301:25885:19:19:108:528:159:121:Times:121:Times:Assignment patterns based on whether the university is public or private is found in Table 3. A 
9:302:25981:19:19:72:534:140:121:Times:121:Times:patent from a public university is more likely to be assigned to a firm. Of the 6465 patent/inventor pairs, 
9:303:26089:19:24:72:537:121:121:Times:121:Times:62.9% are public university pairs and 25.5% of these are assigned only to firms. Firm assignments by pri-

9:305:26242:7:16:72:541:90:42:Times:100:Times:8 The fall off in applications in 1998 & 1999 and again in 2003 follows from the fact that the NBER patent data ends 
9:306:26359:16:0:71:497:74:100:Times:100:Times:with patents granted in 1999 and we added patents granted in 2004 to get a distribution across the period. 
10:307:26467:0:19:72:527:709:121:Times:121:Times:vate university pairs are 22.1%. These percentages are statistically significantly different at a 1% level. 
10:308:26575:19:19:72:517:690:121:Times:121:Times:The corresponding figure for patents assigned to universities is 62.6% for the public universities and 
10:309:26678:19:19:72:538:671:121:Times:121:Times:67.3% for the private universities. What Table 3 does not show is the change over time in assignment pat-
10:310:26783:19:19:72:534:652:121:Times:121:Times:terns depending on whether the university is public or private. For the private universities the percentage 
10:311:26891:19:19:72:530:633:121:Times:121:Times:assigned to universities has fallen from roughly 70% in the early years to around 62% in the later years. 
10:312:26997:19:19:72:533:614:121:Times:121:Times:Firm assignment has risen from less than 20% to almost 30%. University assignment for public universi-
10:313:27099:19:19:71:542:595:121:Times:121:Times:ties has fallen from roughly 65% to 60% and firm assignment has risen from roughly 22% to 29%. Private 
10:314:27202:19:19:72:291:576:121:Times:121:Times:and public universities appear to be converging.   
10:315:27253:19:18:108:531:557:121:Times:121:Times:In Table 4 we give the number of patent/inventor pairs by university and their assignment distri-
10:316:27350:18:19:72:522:539:121:Times:121:Times:bution for universities with at least 40 patents in our sample. Universities are ordered according to the 
10:317:27456:19:19:72:536:520:121:Times:121:Times:number of patent/inventor pairs. The use of patent/inventor pairs rather than patents involves some multi-
10:318:27562:19:19:72:498:501:121:Times:121:Times:ple counting of patents since it is common to have several faculty inventors for the same patent.  
10:319:27661:19:19:108:405:482:121:Times:121:Times:                                                    (Insert             Table             4             about             here)             
10:320:27801:19:19:108:523:463:121:Times:121:Times:Thirty-seven of the universities have 50 or fewer patents/inventor pairs and only twenty-three 
10:321:27896:19:19:72:540:444:121:Times:121:Times:have 100 or more pairs. MIT has the largest number (315) of patent/inventor pairs followed by Wisconsin 
10:322:28000:19:19:72:537:425:121:Times:121:Times:with 232, Stanford with 223, UC San Diego at 216 and rounding out those with over 200 is UC Berkeley 
10:323:28101:19:19:72:535:406:121:Times:121:Times:with 207. There is substantial variation across universities in assignments. For the universities in Table 4 
10:324:28210:19:19:72:534:387:121:Times:121:Times:the percentage assigned to universities varies from a low of 25% (Arizona with 68 patent/inventor pairs) 
10:325:28315:19:19:72:537:368:121:Times:121:Times:to a high of 87.8% (Columbia with 74 pairs). Assignment solely to firms varies from a low of 1.5% (Van-
10:326:28418:19:19:72:365:349:121:Times:121:Times:derbilt with 68 pairs) to a high of 52.6% (Colorado with 97 pairs). 
10:327:28486:19:19:108:536:330:121:Times:121:Times:Of the 5811 patents in our sample 1513 are assigned solely to firms and 241 are assigned both to 
10:328:28583:19:19:72:537:311:121:Times:121:Times:firms and universities. Since start-up activity is common at research universities we searched for whether 
10:329:28690:19:19:72:529:292:121:Times:121:Times:the faculty member was a “principal” in the sense that she is linked to the firm as a founder, a senior ex-
10:330:28797:19:19:72:529:273:121:Times:121:Times:ecutive, a member of the scientific advisory board or as a member of the board of directors.9 Faculty in-
10:331:28902:19:19:72:537:254:121:Times:121:Times:ventors are principals in the assignee firms for 488 (32.3%) of the patents assigned solely to firms and 57 
10:332:29010:19:19:72:532:235:121:Times:121:Times:(24%) of the patents that were assigned both to firms and universities. That is, faculty inventors are prin-
10:333:29118:19:19:72:529:216:121:Times:121:Times:cipals in the assignee firms for 9.4% of all patents in the sample. This is a lower bound since it is likely 
10:334:29227:19:19:72:530:197:121:Times:121:Times:that the search for links failed to uncover all links. If we combine these patents with the 327 unassigned 
10:335:29334:19:19:72:527:178:121:Times:121:Times:patents, then our sample suggests that, as a lower bound, faculty have a direct ownership role for about 
10:336:29439:19:19:72:529:159:121:Times:121:Times:15% of all patents for which they are inventors. Hereafter we refer to the firms in which we have found 
10:337:29543:19:43:72:523:140:121:Times:121:Times:that the inventor is a principal as a “linked” firm. As noted, these are start-up firms. We refer to the re-
10:338:29651:43:7:216:219:97:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
10:339:29699:7:16:72:534:90:42:Times:100:Times:9 For a number of patent/inventor pairs the inventor is listed as having several of these functions. In such a case we 
10:340:29818:16:0:71:340:74:100:Times:100:Times:consider that there is only a single link between inventor and firm. 
11:341:29889:0:19:72:532:709:121:Times:121:Times:maining firms as “established” to differentiate them from start-ups although we caution that some of the 
11:342:29994:19:19:72:427:690:121:Times:121:Times:firms labeled as established may be start-ups for which we could not find a link. 
11:343:30076:19:19:108:533:671:121:Times:121:Times:It is likely that many of the unassigned patents are being used in firms in which the inventor is a 
11:344:30176:19:19:72:538:652:121:Times:121:Times:principal. We did a search of whether the inventor for an unassigned patent had ever founded a company, 
11:345:30280:19:19:72:535:633:121:Times:121:Times:been a senior executive of a company or had been a member of the scientific advisory board (or board of 
11:346:30384:19:19:72:540:614:121:Times:121:Times:directors) of a company. Note that this, unlike the first search, does not link the patent to a company since 
11:347:30494:19:19:71:541:595:121:Times:121:Times:the patent does not have an assignee. We found that 26.4% of the unassigned patents were associated with 
11:348:30599:19:19:72:405:576:121:Times:121:Times:inventors who could be linked to a company. Again, this is a lower bound.

11:350:30674:19:18:72:178:538:121:Times:121:Times:5. Econometric Model 
11:351:30695:18:19:108:536:520:121:Times:121:Times:In this section logit and multinomial logit models are used to explore the relationship between as-
11:352:30794:19:19:72:519:501:121:Times:121:Times:signment and characteristics of patents, inventors and the inventor’s universities. Our interest is in as-
11:353:30900:19:19:72:525:482:121:Times:121:Times:signment by type of organization (university, firm, unassigned) so that the patents assigned jointly to a 
11:354:31006:19:19:71:542:463:121:Times:121:Times:university and to a firm are also deleted from the sample. Finally, we drop the few patents with the federal 
11:355:31115:19:19:71:541:444:121:Times:121:Times:government as an assignee. These are generally defense-related patents (government assignees are usually 
11:356:31220:19:19:71:252:425:121:Times:121:Times:sections of the Department of Defense).  
11:357:31261:19:19:108:534:406:121:Times:121:Times:The econometric models are used to determine partial correlations between the probability of as-
11:358:31357:19:19:72:541:387:121:Times:121:Times:signment to a particular type of organization and a set of patent characteristics. In specifying these models 
11:359:31467:19:19:72:528:368:121:Times:121:Times:we are not implying a causal relationship between patent characteristics and assignment, but rather cau-
11:360:31571:19:19:72:536:349:121:Times:121:Times:sality between research activities and assignment and between research and patent characteristics. As dis-
11:361:31677:19:19:72:532:330:121:Times:121:Times:cussed in Section 2, where the research is conducted determines legitimate assignment. Since university 
11:362:31781:19:19:72:519:311:121:Times:121:Times:research tends to be more basic or fundamental than industry research, we expect patents based on re-
11:363:31882:19:19:72:525:292:121:Times:121:Times:search in university labs to be more basic or fundamental than those that result from consulting in firm 
11:364:31987:19:19:72:527:273:121:Times:121:Times:labs. Thus if firm-assigned patents are more incremental than university-assigned patents, we infer that 
11:365:32092:19:19:72:533:254:121:Times:121:Times:they are the result of consulting. If firm-assigned patents are similar to or more fundamental than univer-
11:366:32199:19:19:72:541:235:121:Times:121:Times:sity-assigned patents, the inference is that they may have emanated from university labs. We rely on these 
11:367:32306:19:19:72:520:216:121:Times:121:Times:inferences since it is the patents along with their assignment and other characteristics that we observe 
11:368:32411:19:19:72:246:197:121:Times:121:Times:rather than the research activity itself.

11:371:32482:19:19:108:534:140:121:Times:121:Times:We include four measures of the originality and/or importance of patents from the NBER Patent 
11:372:32576:19:19:72:536:121:121:Times:121:Times:Database (Hall et al., 2001). Two of the measures are backward looking and attempt to capture basicness 
11:373:32680:19:19:72:457:102:121:Times:121:Times:of the research. The first is the log of the number of backward citations to prior patents 
11:374:32771:19:0:72:530:83:121:Times:121:Times:(LN_CITES_MADE) contained in the focal patent. The larger the number of backward citations the lar-
12:375:32872:0:19:72:537:709:121:Times:121:Times:ger is the existing body of related work, so that we would expect patents with more backward citations to 
12:376:32978:19:19:72:530:690:121:Times:121:Times:be more incremental. The second backward looking measure is the Trajtenberg et al. (1997) measure of 
12:377:33079:19:19:72:538:671:121:Times:121:Times:patent originality (ORIGINAL). ORIGINAL is based on a Herfindahl index that reflects the dispersion of 
12:378:33182:19:26:71:365:652:121:Times:121:Times:citations made by the patent across patent classes. The measure is

12:384:33373:28:21:80:527:572:49:Times:121:Times:jnpatent technology classes. The originality score is higher the wider the range of classes to which the 
12:385:33478:21:19:72:532:551:121:Times:121:Times:patent makes citations. A score of 0 indicates that all citations to prior art are in a single patent class and 
12:386:33590:19:19:72:537:532:121:Times:121:Times:scores close to one indicate citations to many classes. A patent is considered more original if it cites prior 
12:387:33701:19:19:72:297:513:121:Times:121:Times:art from many rather than few technology classes.  
12:388:33752:19:18:108:528:494:121:Times:121:Times:The other two patent variables we include are measures of the patent’s importance. We include 
12:389:33846:18:19:72:518:476:121:Times:121:Times:the log of the total number of claims (LN_CLAIMS) since we expect more important patents to have 
12:390:33943:19:19:72:498:457:121:Times:121:Times:more claims. The log of the number of forward citations received by the patent by October 2006 
12:391:34038:19:19:72:539:438:121:Times:121:Times:(LN_FOR_CITES) is included to reflect importance in the sense that the patent has been considered prior 
12:392:34142:19:19:72:531:419:121:Times:121:Times:art by either subsequent inventors or patent examiners.10 The latter measure is subject to error from trun-
12:393:34249:19:19:72:538:400:121:Times:121:Times:cation. For example, the average patent granted in 1995 has 17.6 forward citations, but the average patent 
12:394:34356:19:19:72:542:381:121:Times:121:Times:granted in 1999 has only 9.5 citations (these are significantly different at the 1% level). For this reason we 
12:395:34467:19:19:72:512:362:121:Times:121:Times:caution against placing a great deal of weight on forward citations as a measure of importance even 
12:396:34567:19:19:72:533:343:121:Times:121:Times:though we do include year fixed effects which should serve to mitigate the error. Finally, including both 
12:397:34673:19:19:72:533:324:121:Times:121:Times:LN_CITES_MADE and LN_FOR_CITES controls for differences in citation propensities across techno-
12:398:34768:19:19:72:135:305:121:Times:121:Times:logical fields. 
12:399:34784:19:19:108:543:286:121:Times:121:Times:Clearly, there are flaws in these measures (Sampat, 2004). For example, a patent that has only one 
12:400:34883:19:19:72:535:267:121:Times:121:Times:citation (hence less dependent on prior art) will have an originality score of zero which suggests that it is 
12:401:34993:19:19:72:524:248:121:Times:121:Times:not very original. In addition, the number of claims in the patent may simply reflect better patent attor-
12:402:35099:19:19:72:533:229:121:Times:121:Times:neys. The NBER Patent Database only includes patents granted by 1999 so that the regressions necessar-
12:403:35201:19:19:72:354:210:121:Times:121:Times:ily exclude the subset of our patents that were granted in 2004.  
12:404:35267:19:19:108:528:191:121:Times:121:Times:The regressions also include information on the inventor and her department from the National 
12:405:35361:19:19:72:523:172:121:Times:121:Times:Research Council’s survey of Ph.D. granting departments (NRC, 1995). Faculty are divided into three 
12:406:35461:19:19:72:532:153:121:Times:121:Times:major program areas: physical sciences, engineering and biological sciences. We use indicator variables 
12:407:35565:19:19:72:523:134:121:Times:121:Times:for physical sciences  and engineering (PHY_SCI = 1 if the department is in the physical sciences and 
12:408:35667:19:29:72:533:115:121:Times:121:Times:ENG = 1 for engineering faculty). Just under 4% of the patent/inventor pairs have faculty from different 
12:409:35772:29:8:216:219:86:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
12:410:35820:8:0:72:451:78:42:Times:100:Times:10 Since the NBER patent data end in 1999, we updated the forward citations to October 2006. 
13:411:35915:0:19:72:535:709:121:Times:121:Times:areas (about 19% of all patent/inventor pairs have multiple identified faculty), and this creates a problem 
13:412:36023:19:19:72:518:690:121:Times:121:Times:in the assignment of major program area to a patent. We approach this in the following way. We con-
13:413:36122:19:19:72:536:671:121:Times:121:Times:structed an indicator variable to indicate whether the patent has more than one identified faculty inventor 
13:414:36230:19:19:72:537:652:121:Times:121:Times:(CO_INVENT=1 if the patent has several faculty inventors).11 Then we randomly dropped all but one co-
13:415:36331:19:19:72:523:633:121:Times:121:Times:inventor; thus assignment is considered at the unique patent level. As a robustness check we added an-
13:416:36433:19:19:72:529:614:121:Times:121:Times:other indicator variable equal to one when the patent had several faculty inventors from different major 
13:417:36538:19:19:72:531:595:121:Times:121:Times:program areas and we included all inventor pairs, not just the unique patents. We also estimated models 
13:418:36642:19:19:72:538:576:121:Times:121:Times:with and without the CO_INVENT variable. Results change very little from model to model so we report 
13:419:36743:19:18:72:528:557:121:Times:121:Times:only the regressions that use patent level data based on one randomly selected inventor and without the 
13:420:36847:18:19:72:183:539:121:Times:121:Times:CO_INVENT variable.   
13:421:36869:19:19:108:515:520:121:Times:121:Times:We include a measure of the academic quality of the inventor’s department (DEPT_QUAL) 
13:422:36955:19:19:72:528:501:121:Times:121:Times:where higher numbers indicate higher quality academic departments. The measure is from the NRC. In 
13:423:37054:19:19:72:529:482:121:Times:121:Times:cases where an inventor is listed in several departments a weighted average of quality is used where the 
13:424:37159:19:19:72:537:463:121:Times:121:Times:weights are the number of faculty in each department. The NRC database includes the rank of the faculty 
13:425:37263:19:19:72:538:444:121:Times:121:Times:member in 1993, the year the NRC collected the data. We create an indicator variable for faculty who are 
13:426:37368:19:19:72:513:425:121:Times:121:Times:tenured in 1993 (TENURE_93 = 1 if faculty is a full or associate professor in 1993). This is a crude 
13:427:37469:19:19:72:530:406:121:Times:121:Times:measure of academic career profile in that someone tenured in 1993 is further along in her career at any 
13:428:37574:19:19:72:311:387:121:Times:121:Times:year in our sample than someone not tenured in 1993. 
13:429:37627:19:19:108:537:368:121:Times:121:Times:The other university regressors include an indicator variable for public/private status (PUBLIC = 
13:430:37725:19:19:72:515:349:121:Times:121:Times:1 if the university is public) as well as an indicator for urban/rural university location (URBAN =1). 
13:431:37828:19:19:72:532:330:121:Times:121:Times:Given the widespread expectation that research in public universities should benefit their local and state 
13:432:37935:19:19:72:537:311:121:Times:121:Times:economies, we expect faculty in public universities to be more likely to consult and therefore more likely 
13:433:38042:19:19:72:541:292:121:Times:121:Times:to assign patents to firms. Faculty in universities located in urban areas may well have greater opportunity 
13:434:38151:19:19:72:538:273:121:Times:121:Times:for local consulting. In addition, access to venture capital is generally regarded to be better in urban areas 
13:435:38262:19:19:71:524:254:121:Times:121:Times:hence firm start-up activity may be enhanced. For these reasons we expect faculty in urban areas to be 
13:436:38365:19:19:71:527:235:121:Times:121:Times:more likely to assign to firms. We include the percentage of licensing revenue shared with the inventor 
13:437:38469:19:38:71:506:216:121:Times:121:Times:(INVENT_SHARE).12 This varies across our sample from 20% to 100% with a mean of 37.8%.13  
13:438:38559:38:8:216:219:178:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
13:439:38607:8:16:72:539:170:42:Times:100:Times:11 We are only measuring whether more than one of the faculty in the NRC listing is an inventor. We do not rule out 
13:440:38723:16:7:72:382:154:100:Times:100:Times:the possibility that there are other university personnel who are co-inventors. 
13:441:38803:7:16:72:529:147:42:Times:100:Times:12 We also collected share of licensing revenues that accrue to the inventor’s department however this was not sig-
13:442:38918:16:7:72:369:131:100:Times:100:Times:nificant in any of our models so we dropped it from the reported analysis. 
13:443:38993:7:16:72:532:124:42:Times:100:Times:13 Several universities have a sliding scale for sharing of licensing proceeds; in such cases we used the share for in-
13:444:39112:16:11:72:530:108:100:Times:100:Times:come that falls between $25k and $50k as the measure since this is close to the average income across all active li-
13:445:39228:11:12:72:518:97:100:Times:100:Times:censes. The University of Iowa provides the inventor 100% of net proceeds for the first $100k so it is therefore 
13:446:39341:12:11:72:541:85:100:Times:100:Times:loaded at 100% in our data.  We also tested minimum university license shares and shares at $1,000,000 payout with 
13:447:39456:11:0:72:281:74:100:Times:100:Times:all results consistent with our results reported here.  
14:448:39514:0:19:108:533:709:121:Times:121:Times:After dropping observations with missing data we are left with 4108 observations. Summary sta-
14:449:39608:19:19:71:265:690:121:Times:121:Times:tistics for these observations are in Table 5.

14:451:39821:19:19:71:194:652:121:Times:121:Times:5.2. Bivariate Logit Model  
14:452:39849:19:19:107:539:633:121:Times:121:Times:We first consider a logit regression model of whether the patent is assigned to a university (coded 
14:453:39949:19:19:71:527:614:121:Times:121:Times:as a 1) or not assigned to a university (coded as a zero) as a function of patent, inventor, and university 
14:454:40057:19:19:71:533:595:121:Times:121:Times:characteristics. Patents assigned to both firms and universities or to the federal government are excluded 
14:455:40164:19:19:71:523:576:121:Times:121:Times:from the analysis so that those patents not assigned to a university either are unassigned or they are as-
14:456:40270:19:18:71:529:557:121:Times:121:Times:signed to firms. In addition to the regressors discussed above, some of the regressions include year, uni-
14:457:40376:18:19:71:515:539:121:Times:121:Times:versity and technology fixed effects. The technology categories are from the NBER patent database. 
14:458:40475:19:19:107:532:520:121:Times:121:Times:Results in terms of odds ratios are in Table 6.14 Ratios greater than one imply that an increase in 
14:459:40575:19:19:71:531:501:121:Times:121:Times:the regressor leads to a higher probability of assignment to a university with the opposite for odds ratios 
14:460:40683:19:19:71:529:482:121:Times:121:Times:less than one. In each regression we have included year fixed effects and have included or excluded the 
14:461:40787:19:19:71:527:463:121:Times:121:Times:technology and university fixed effects. When university fixed effects are included the regressors PUB-
14:462:40890:19:19:71:526:444:121:Times:121:Times:LIC, URBAN and INVENT_SHARE are redundant since they vary only across universities. The inclu-
14:463:40984:19:19:71:534:425:121:Times:121:Times:sion of technology fixed effects is expected to capture much of the effects of the field indicator variables 
14:464:41093:19:19:71:542:406:121:Times:121:Times:(ENG and PHY_SCI). In the top panel of the Table (regressions A and B) we have included the university 
14:465:41196:19:19:71:542:387:121:Times:121:Times:fixed effects. In regression A (B) the technology fixed effects are included (excluded). In the second panel 
14:466:41305:19:19:71:533:368:121:Times:121:Times:of Table 6 the university fixed effects are excluded and the technology effects are included in regression 
14:467:41412:19:19:71:529:349:121:Times:121:Times:C and excluded from regression D. Excluding year effects has very little effect on the results so, for the 
14:468:41519:19:19:71:280:330:121:Times:121:Times:sake of brevity, those results are not presented. 
14:469:41569:19:19:107:368:311:121:Times:121:Times:                                       (Insert             Table             6             about             here)             
14:470:41696:19:19:107:535:292:121:Times:121:Times:The most salient variables for making inferences as to whether assignment outside the university 
14:471:41793:19:19:71:540:273:121:Times:121:Times:is illicit are the four patent characteristic regressors LN_CLAIMS, LN_CITES_MADE, LN_FOR_CITES 
14:472:41889:19:19:71:534:254:121:Times:121:Times:and ORIGINAL. As we argued in Section 2, if outside assignment results from consulting, then more ba-
14:473:41990:19:19:71:537:235:121:Times:121:Times:sic or important patents should have a higher likelihood of university assignment. Conversely, if research 
14:474:42097:19:19:71:525:216:121:Times:121:Times:emanating from university labs is illicitly assigned to firms, one would expect either no relationship to 
14:475:42203:19:19:71:473:197:121:Times:121:Times:patent characteristics or more basic or important patents assigned outside. ORIGINAL and 
14:476:42292:19:19:71:541:178:121:Times:121:Times:LN_CITES_MADE are always significant at a 1% level and consistent with outside assignment reflecting 
14:477:42393:19:19:71:525:159:121:Times:121:Times:consulting as was suggested in our interviews.  Recall the larger the number of backward citations, the 
14:478:42497:19:19:71:471:140:121:Times:121:Times:larger is the existing related work and therefore the more incremental the patent.  Thus the 
14:479:42590:19:24:71:535:121:121:Times:121:Times:LN_CITES_MADE coefficient below one indicates more incremental patents are not assigned to the uni-
14:480:42689:24:7:216:219:97:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
14:481:42737:7:16:72:524:90:42:Times:100:Times:14 An odds ratio gives the effect of a unit change in a right hand side variable on the ratio of the probability of an 
14:482:42856:16:0:72:337:74:100:Times:100:Times:assignment to a university divided by one minus that probability.  
15:483:42925:0:19:72:524:709:121:Times:121:Times:versity.  A higher value on ORIGINAL indicates more fundamental work thus a coefficient above one 
15:484:43023:19:19:72:404:690:121:Times:121:Times:also indicates more incremental patents are not assigned to the university.   
15:485:43101:19:19:108:528:671:121:Times:121:Times:The other two patent variables are less clear. LN_CLAIMS (the number of claims) is never sig-
15:486:43194:19:19:72:537:652:121:Times:121:Times:nificant. When technology fixed effects are present in the regression LN_FOR_CITES (forward citations 
15:487:43296:19:19:72:537:633:121:Times:121:Times:or citations to the patent) is not significant. It is likely that significance for this variable when technology 
15:488:43409:19:19:71:534:614:121:Times:121:Times:effects are absent is due to differences in forward citations across technology categories and a difference 
15:489:43517:19:19:72:535:595:121:Times:121:Times:in the rate of firm assignment by technology class. That is, the results suggest that the technology classes 
15:490:43626:19:19:71:517:576:121:Times:121:Times:that have the most forward citations are likely to be the classes that have the greatest frequency of as-
15:491:43731:19:18:71:157:557:121:Times:121:Times:signment to firms.  
15:492:43751:18:19:108:531:539:121:Times:121:Times:Regressions C and D of Table 6 include INVENT_SHARE. The higher the inventor share of in-
15:493:43840:19:19:71:522:520:121:Times:121:Times:come the more likely the patent will be assigned to the university. All else equal, high inventor shares 
15:494:43945:19:19:71:543:501:121:Times:121:Times:provide an incentive for faculty to disclose inventions to the TTO, so this result may simply reflect faculty 
15:495:44055:19:19:71:534:482:121:Times:121:Times:responding to this incentive. In addition, it may be the case that, as suggested in Jensen et al. (2007), fac-
15:496:44165:19:19:71:536:463:121:Times:121:Times:ulty in high share universities may spend less time trying to augment their income by consulting. Both of 
15:497:44271:19:19:71:439:444:121:Times:121:Times:these effects would tend to increase the likelihood of assignment to the university.  
15:498:44357:19:19:107:537:425:121:Times:121:Times:When technology fixed effects are included (regressions A and C) there is not a significant differ-
15:499:44456:19:19:71:524:406:121:Times:121:Times:ence between assignment of engineers (ENG) and biological scientists and between physical scientists 
15:500:44557:19:19:71:524:387:121:Times:121:Times:(PHY_SCI) and biological sciences. We tested whether ENG and PHY_SCI are significantly different 
15:501:44654:19:19:71:541:368:121:Times:121:Times:and found that there is a significantly higher probability (1% level) that engineers assign to the university. 
15:502:44765:19:19:71:526:349:121:Times:121:Times:However, when we exclude the technology fixed effects both physical scientists and engineers are less 
15:503:44867:19:19:71:537:330:121:Times:121:Times:likely to assign to the university than are biological scientists and this is significant at the 1% level. Tests 
15:504:44980:19:19:71:429:311:121:Times:121:Times:of differences between ENG and PHY_SCI reveal that they are not significantly. 
15:505:45059:19:19:107:530:292:121:Times:121:Times:Department quality is significant only in regression C but the level of significance is only 10%. 
15:506:45157:19:19:71:517:273:121:Times:121:Times:There is also weak evidence that older faculty (crudely measured as having tenure in 1993) are more 
15:507:45257:19:19:71:541:254:121:Times:121:Times:likely to assign to the university and that faculty in urban universities are more likely to assign outside the 
15:508:45369:19:19:71:530:235:121:Times:121:Times:university. As expected, public university faculty are more likely to assign to a firm than the university. 
15:509:45477:19:19:107:541:216:121:Times:121:Times:As an additional robustness check, these models were estimated with a more restrictive dependent 
15:510:45574:19:19:71:520:197:121:Times:121:Times:variable; the unassigned patents were deleted from consideration and the models run on those patents 
15:511:45675:19:19:71:481:178:121:Times:121:Times:solely assigned to universities and those solely assigned to firms. The results are unchanged.

15:513:45770:19:0:71:205:140:121:Times:121:Times:5.3. Multinomial Comparison 
16:514:45800:0:19:108:537:709:121:Times:121:Times:Thus far, we have compared university patents with all other patents. In this section, we disaggre-
16:515:45899:19:19:71:536:690:121:Times:121:Times:gate the other patents and use a multinomial logit model of assignment. The categories and the shorthand 
16:516:46004:19:19:71:164:671:121:Times:121:Times:notation for each are 
16:517:46026:19:12:125:402:652:121:Times:121:Times:1. UNIV – The patent is assigned to one or more universities 
16:518:46086:12:13:125:492:640:121:Times:121:Times:2. UNASSIGN – The patent is unassigned and therefore owned by the inventor(s) 
16:519:46163:13:13:125:532:627:121:Times:121:Times:3. LINK – The patent is assigned to a firm in which a link could be found between the firm 
16:520:46253:13:12:143:425:614:121:Times:121:Times:and the inventor. That is, the inventor is a principal in the firm. 
16:521:46321:12:13:125:542:602:121:Times:121:Times:4. ESTBL  – The patent is assigned to a firm and it could not be determined that the inventor 
16:522:46414:13:12:143:495:589:121:Times:121:Times:is a principal in the firm. The firm is an established firm rather than a start-up. 
16:523:46498:12:13:107:110:577:121:Times:121:Times: 
16:524:46498:13:19:107:542:564:121:Times:121:Times:The “link” category consists of all patents for which we were able to identify a faculty inventor as 
16:525:46599:19:19:71:521:545:121:Times:121:Times:a principal in the assignee firm (that is, she either is a founder, an executive or a member of a board).  
16:526:46706:19:19:71:529:526:121:Times:121:Times:Since this search is unlikely to have uncovered all links, group 4 may well include patents that properly 
16:527:46812:19:19:71:524:507:121:Times:121:Times:belong to group 3. This misclassification is most likely to occur for young firms since young firms are 
16:528:46916:19:19:71:539:488:121:Times:121:Times:more likely to be start-ups in which faculty members are principals. Thus we also separated the patents in 
16:529:47023:19:19:71:527:469:121:Times:121:Times:group 4 into those assigned to old, established firms and those assigned to young firms. We considered 
16:530:47126:19:19:71:534:450:121:Times:121:Times:any firm established before 1980 as old, so that an old firm is one that is 10 years old or older at the time 
16:531:47236:19:19:71:525:431:121:Times:121:Times:of the patent application. In both logit and multinomial logit regressions we find the only difference in 
16:532:47342:19:19:71:531:412:121:Times:121:Times:these two groups is that faculty from engineering and the physical sciences and faculty in higher quality 
16:533:47448:19:19:71:534:393:121:Times:121:Times:departments are more likely to assign to an old rather than a young firm. Thus we drop further considera-
16:534:47553:19:19:71:532:374:121:Times:121:Times:tion of firm age. Unassigned patents might be argued to properly belong with the patents in group 3, but 
16:535:47658:19:19:71:537:355:121:Times:121:Times:there are important differences between the patents in groups 2 and 3 so that we will consider unassigned 
16:536:47764:19:19:71:209:336:121:Times:121:Times:patents as a separate category.  
16:537:47797:19:19:107:522:317:121:Times:121:Times:The results are in Table 7. The coefficients are presented as relative risk ratios (RRR).15 If the 
16:538:47896:19:19:71:530:298:121:Times:121:Times:RRR of an independent variable is greater than one (smaller than one), then an increase in the independ-
16:539:48000:19:19:71:534:279:121:Times:121:Times:ent variable is associated with an increase (decrease) in the risk of the numerator type of assignment rela-
16:540:48108:19:19:71:515:260:121:Times:121:Times:tive to the denominator type of assignment. For example, consider the results in panel A of the table 
16:541:48210:19:19:71:499:241:121:Times:121:Times:which shows the comparison of unassigned patents with patents assigned to a university (UNAS-
16:542:48303:19:19:71:539:222:121:Times:121:Times:SIGN/UNIV). If DEPT_QUAL increases by a score of one the risk of UNASSIGN relative to UNIV rises 
16:543:48400:19:19:71:532:203:121:Times:121:Times:by 36.4% so that faculty in higher quality departments are more likely to have unassigned patents. If the 
16:544:48506:19:19:71:541:184:121:Times:121:Times:faculty member is a physical scientist (PHY_SCI = 1), then the risk of UNASSIGN relative to UNIV falls 
16:545:48609:19:19:71:539:165:121:Times:121:Times:by 32.1% so that physical scientists are more likely to assign to their university in comparison to the omit-
16:546:48718:19:19:71:223:146:121:Times:121:Times:ted category biological scientists.  
16:547:48755:19:41:108:408:127:121:Times:121:Times:                                                    (Insert             Table             7             about             here)                          
16:548:48908:41:8:216:219:86:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
16:549:48956:8:0:72:288:78:42:Times:100:Times:15 A relative risk ratio is very similar to an odds ratio. 
17:550:49017:0:19:108:531:709:121:Times:121:Times:Panels A, B and C are comparisons of patents assigned to universities (UNIV) versus those that 
17:551:49112:19:19:71:528:690:121:Times:121:Times:are unassigned (UNASSIGN), universities versus patents assigned to firms where there is link between 
17:552:49213:19:19:71:524:671:121:Times:121:Times:the firm and the inventor (LINK) and universities versus patents assigned to firms where we could not 
17:553:49315:19:19:71:535:652:121:Times:121:Times:find a link to the inventor (ESTBL). Interestingly, among these three comparisons the greatest difference 
17:554:49421:19:19:71:532:633:121:Times:121:Times:between university and non-university assignment is that for LINK versus UNIV. With the exception of 
17:555:49522:19:19:71:536:614:121:Times:121:Times:PHY_SCI all coefficients in panel B are significant at least at a 10% level and the magnitudes of the rela-
17:556:49629:19:19:71:543:595:121:Times:121:Times:tive risk ratios are generally larger than they are for the other two comparisons. In other words, the patents 
17:557:49740:19:19:71:541:576:121:Times:121:Times:that are most different from university assigned patents are those patents assigned to start-up firms. Panels 
17:558:49850:19:18:71:370:557:121:Times:121:Times:D, E and F are comparisons of patents not assigned to universities.  
17:559:49919:18:19:107:533:539:121:Times:121:Times:Only models with technology class fixed effects are considered to allow for the greatest number 
17:560:50015:19:19:71:539:520:121:Times:121:Times:of regressors. We also consider year fixed effects. Results with university fixed effects are very similar to 
17:561:50125:19:19:71:423:501:121:Times:121:Times:those reported in Table 7 so for the sake of brevity we omit the detailed results. 
17:562:50208:19:19:71:201:482:121:Times:121:Times:5.3.1. Patent Characteristics 
17:563:50238:19:19:108:537:463:121:Times:121:Times: As before, the variables most pertinent for examining illicit assignment are the patent characteris-
17:564:50338:19:19:71:529:444:121:Times:121:Times:tic variables LN_CLAIMS, LN_CITES_MADE, LN_FOR_CITES and ORIGINAL in the comparisons 
17:565:50423:19:19:71:527:425:121:Times:121:Times:that involve university assignments. These are in panels A, B and C. There is evidence that the broader 
17:566:50527:19:19:71:539:406:121:Times:121:Times:the patent, in terms of more claims, the more likely it will be assigned to the university versus a firm with 
17:567:50637:19:19:71:523:387:121:Times:121:Times:an inventor link or unassigned, but the number of claims is not significant in the ESTBL versus UNIV 
17:568:50738:19:19:71:541:368:121:Times:121:Times:assignment (panel C). Before we continue with panels A, B and C note that LN_CLAIMS is significant in 
17:569:50840:19:19:71:529:349:121:Times:121:Times:the comparisons ESTBL/LINK (panel E) and UNASSIGN/ESTBL (panel F), and, in both, more claims 
17:570:50933:19:19:71:528:330:121:Times:121:Times:imply a higher likelihood of ESTBL assignment. Since we would expect universities and firms with no 
17:571:51033:19:19:71:523:311:121:Times:121:Times:inventor links (which tend to be large firms) to have more resources for patent applications, this result 
17:572:51139:19:19:71:310:292:121:Times:121:Times:may reflect access to better legal advice in patenting.  
17:573:51196:19:19:108:524:273:121:Times:121:Times:More forward cites are positively related to assignment to LINK firms versus UNIV while the 
17:574:51288:19:19:71:522:254:121:Times:121:Times:opposite holds for ESTBL versus UNIV assignment. LINK firm patents also have more citations than 
17:575:51385:19:19:71:522:235:121:Times:121:Times:either ESTBL or UNASSIGN.  As we cautioned earlier, care must be taken in attributing much to our 
17:576:51483:19:19:71:541:216:121:Times:121:Times:measure of forward citations because of truncation error. LN_CITES_MADE is significant for each of the 
17:577:51586:19:19:71:524:197:121:Times:121:Times:three comparisons involving universities with more citations having a higher likelihood of assignment 
17:578:51688:19:19:71:526:178:121:Times:121:Times:outside the university. The more original the patent the more likely it will be assigned to UNIV than to 
17:579:51793:19:19:71:528:159:121:Times:121:Times:LINK or ESTBL. ORIGINAL is not significant in the UNASSIGN/UNIV comparison. Taken together, 
17:580:51885:19:19:71:537:140:121:Times:121:Times:the results are similar to those obtained in the bivariate logit model: more basic patents are more likely to 
17:581:51995:19:19:71:486:121:121:Times:121:Times:be assigned to the university regardless of whether the firm is or is not linked to the inventor.  
17:582:52094:19:19:108:535:102:121:Times:121:Times:To the extent that the backward looking measures reflect how basic the underlying research was, 
17:583:52190:19:0:71:541:83:121:Times:121:Times:the backward looking measures suggest that the research behind patents assigned to universities was more 
18:584:52297:0:19:72:534:709:121:Times:121:Times:fundamental than the research behind those assigned elsewhere. By implication, therefore, we argue that 
18:585:52401:19:19:72:526:690:121:Times:121:Times:the backward looking measures do not support the case that assignment outside the university is nefari-
18:586:52504:19:19:72:518:671:121:Times:121:Times:ous. By contrast the results for forward cites are mixed. When the comparison is between non-linked 
18:587:52604:19:19:72:535:652:121:Times:121:Times:firms and universities the results suggest legitimate assignment. However, for linked firms versus univer-
18:588:52710:19:19:71:537:633:121:Times:121:Times:sities the more important the patent (in terms of forward cites) the more likely the patent will be assigned 
18:589:52819:19:19:72:531:614:121:Times:121:Times:to a linked firm. The lack of significance for LN_CLAIMS (except for the 10% significance in panel B) 
18:590:52921:19:19:71:286:595:121:Times:121:Times:does not support the legitimate assignment case. 
18:591:52970:19:19:108:538:576:121:Times:121:Times:Results are somewhat mixed in the comparison between UNASSIGN and UNIV (panel A). Unas-
18:592:53057:19:18:72:540:557:121:Times:121:Times:signed patents are more incremental than university assigned patents and they tend to be less broad in that 
18:593:53165:18:19:71:531:539:121:Times:121:Times:they have fewer claims. However, there appears to be no difference in the originality of the patents. Ear-
18:594:53271:19:19:71:533:520:121:Times:121:Times:lier we noted that unassigned patents include some that have been turned back to the inventor by the uni-
18:595:53376:19:19:71:292:501:121:Times:121:Times:versity, hence the weak results are not a surprise.  
18:596:53429:19:19:71:277:482:121:Times:121:Times:5.3.2. Inventor and University Characteristics 
18:597:53476:19:19:108:520:463:121:Times:121:Times:As shown in panels B and C, a higher inventor share increases the likelihood of university as-
18:598:53570:19:19:71:537:444:121:Times:121:Times:signment as compared with assignment to a firm in which the inventor is a principal (LINK) but it has no 
18:599:53675:19:19:71:539:425:121:Times:121:Times:effect on assignment to established firms (ESTBL) versus the university. INVENT_SHARE is significant 
18:600:53776:19:19:71:538:406:121:Times:121:Times:in ESTBL/LINK and UNASSIGN/LINK and in both cases higher inventor share decreases the likelihood 
18:601:53873:19:19:71:535:387:121:Times:121:Times:of assignment to a linked firm. Thus all of the comparisons involving linked firms suggest that faculty in 
18:602:53980:19:19:71:520:368:121:Times:121:Times:high share universities are less likely to assign patents to firms in which they are principals. As in the 
18:603:54087:19:19:71:534:349:121:Times:121:Times:bivariate model, the results on INVENT_SHARE may simply reflect faculty in low share universities be-
18:604:54188:19:19:71:531:330:121:Times:121:Times:ing less willing to disclose, but they may also reflect increased efforts to earn income outside the univer-
18:605:54296:19:19:71:540:311:121:Times:121:Times:sity. The lack of significance in the comparison of ESTBL/UNIV suggests that to the extent this occurs, it 
18:606:54403:19:19:71:525:292:121:Times:121:Times:is not through consulting with established firms but through work with firms in which the inventor is a 
18:607:54507:19:19:71:536:273:121:Times:121:Times:principal. Note, however, that we cannot say whether the latter effect involves legitimate consulting with 
18:608:54614:19:19:71:443:254:121:Times:121:Times:startups or illegally taking university generated inventions outside of the university. 
18:609:54702:19:19:107:534:235:121:Times:121:Times:Despite the fact that technology fixed effects are included in the regressions reported in Table 7, 
18:610:54802:19:19:71:538:216:121:Times:121:Times:there are still some significant effects by major program area. Physical scientists and engineers tend to be 
18:611:54911:19:19:71:535:197:121:Times:121:Times:more similar to each other than to biological scientists as each shows similar assignment trend across the 
18:612:55018:19:19:71:533:178:121:Times:121:Times:panels. Though the coefficients are not always significant, they are more likely than biological scientists 
18:613:55126:19:19:71:539:159:121:Times:121:Times:to assign to ESTBL than to LINK, UNASSIGN or UNIV. They are also more likely than biological scien-
18:614:55225:19:19:71:312:140:121:Times:121:Times:tists to assign to UNIV than to LINK or UNASSIGN.  
18:615:55276:19:19:107:535:121:121:Times:121:Times: Faculty in public universities are more likely than those in private universities to assign to LINK 
18:616:55376:19:19:71:526:102:121:Times:121:Times:rather than UNIV, ESTBL or UNASSIGN. That is, public university inventors are more likely to be in-
18:617:55475:19:0:71:528:83:121:Times:121:Times:volved with start-ups. Public university faculty are also more likely to assign to ESTBL than to UNIV.  
19:618:55581:0:19:72:536:709:121:Times:121:Times:Faculty in urban universities are more likely to assign to LINK than UNIV or ESTBL.  Urban faculty are 
19:619:55684:19:19:71:534:690:121:Times:121:Times:also more likely be inventors on UNASSIGN patents than UNIV or ESTBL.  Urban university inventors

19:622:55830:19:19:72:138:633:121:Times:121:Times:6. Conclusion 
19:623:55843:19:19:107:513:614:121:Times:121:Times:University-industry knowledge flows occur through a wide variety of mechanisms, some of 
19:624:55931:19:19:71:539:595:121:Times:121:Times:which are formal and easily tracked - such as publications, patents, licenses - and others that are harder to 
19:625:56041:19:18:71:532:576:121:Times:121:Times:track such as faculty consulting and the movement of personnel (Mowery et al., 2004). Because consult-
19:626:56143:18:19:71:521:558:121:Times:121:Times:ing is less visible, it is one of the less researched aspects of university to industry technology transfer. 
19:627:56252:19:19:71:525:539:121:Times:121:Times:This is an important gap in our understanding since the research that has been done suggests industrial 
19:628:56356:19:19:71:539:520:121:Times:121:Times:R&D personnel view consulting as important and, in fact, more important than patents or licenses (Cohen 
19:629:56460:19:19:71:518:501:121:Times:121:Times:et al., 1998).16 In our attempt to better understand the role of university faculty in university-industry 
19:630:56567:19:19:72:525:482:121:Times:121:Times:technology transfer, we have shown that patents themselves can provide some insights (albeit indirect) 
19:631:56670:19:19:72:226:463:121:Times:121:Times:into this understudied mechanism. 
19:632:56704:19:19:108:527:444:121:Times:121:Times:In contrast to prior work that identified faculty patents by searching for patents assigned to uni-
19:633:56803:19:19:72:522:425:121:Times:121:Times:versities, our approach has been to find faculty patents by focusing on the inventors. This allows us to 
19:634:56908:19:19:72:539:406:121:Times:121:Times:find faculty patents that are not assigned to universities (or other non-profits). With this approach we find 
19:635:57018:19:19:72:532:387:121:Times:121:Times:that a substantial fraction of faculty patents (around 26%) are assigned solely to firms. According to uni-
19:636:57125:19:19:72:531:368:121:Times:121:Times:versity and industry personnel, this likely is the result of consulting. However, a third of the firm assign-
19:637:57234:19:19:72:532:349:121:Times:121:Times:ments are to firms in which we can identify the faculty inventor as a principal. In this case, it is possible 
19:638:57344:19:19:72:536:330:121:Times:121:Times:that the intellectual property in these patents includes not only the IP developed in the course of consulta-
19:639:57453:19:19:72:517:311:121:Times:121:Times:tion, but also IP that is rightfully (according to employment contracts) the property of the university. 
19:640:57558:19:19:108:536:292:121:Times:121:Times: We estimated a series of probability models of assignment as a function of patent and university 
19:641:57656:19:19:72:527:273:121:Times:121:Times:characteristics as well as inventor field. In both our logit and multinomial logit models we find that pat-
19:642:57763:19:19:72:533:254:121:Times:121:Times:ents assigned to the university tend to be more basic than those assigned outside, suggesting that outside 
19:643:57870:19:19:72:540:235:121:Times:121:Times:assignment results from research conducted in firm labs. We also find faculty in the physical sciences and 
19:644:57977:19:19:72:537:216:121:Times:121:Times:engineering are much more likely to assign to established firms than those in biological sciences. Faculty 
19:645:58084:19:19:72:527:197:121:Times:121:Times:at urban universities are much more likely to assign their patents to a firm in which they are a principal 
19:646:58191:19:19:72:533:178:121:Times:121:Times:than faculty from a rural area, which as noted, could be an effect of better access to venture capital in ur-
19:647:58300:19:50:72:121:159:121:Times:121:Times:ban areas.

19:649:58360:8:16:72:536:101:42:Times:100:Times:16 In the Carnegie Mellon Survey conducted in the early 1990s, 31 percent of respondents listed consulting as “very 
19:650:58476:16:11:72:526:85:100:Times:100:Times:important” for industrial R&D, while only 17 percent said the same for patents and 9 percent said the same for li-
19:651:58590:11:0:72:103:74:100:Times:100:Times:censes. 
20:652:58600:0:19:108:537:709:121:Times:121:Times:From a policy perspective, perhaps the most interesting university factor we consider is the share 
20:653:58699:19:19:71:540:690:121:Times:121:Times:of revenue from licensing that accrues to the inventor when inventions are assigned to and licensed by the 
20:654:58806:19:19:71:521:671:121:Times:121:Times:university. In our regression analysis, a higher inventor share increases the likelihood of university as-
20:655:58912:19:19:71:542:652:121:Times:121:Times:signment as compared with assignment to a firm in which the inventor is a principal but it has no effect on 
20:656:59020:19:19:71:383:633:121:Times:121:Times:consulting with established firms versus assignment to the university.  
20:657:59092:19:19:108:530:614:121:Times:121:Times:Again, with regard to policy, recent research examining the impact of the 2000 Bayh-Dole type 
20:658:59186:19:19:71:526:595:121:Times:121:Times:legislation in Denmark expresses concerns that the ability of universities to claim ownership of faculty 
20:659:59291:19:19:71:526:576:121:Times:121:Times:patents might interfere with healthy university industry collaboration (Valentin and Jensen, 2007). Our 
20:660:59395:19:18:71:535:557:121:Times:121:Times:results suggest that in the United States, Bayh-Dole may not have interfered with this collaboration. This 
20:661:59502:18:19:71:537:539:121:Times:121:Times:is not to say, however, that universities asserting invention ownership has not caused frictions in industry 
20:662:59611:19:19:71:530:520:121:Times:121:Times:relations. As evidenced by recent policy discussions, aggressive university effort to own results of spon-
20:663:59717:19:19:71:494:501:121:Times:121:Times:sored research has become a controversial issue (see, for example, Thursby and Thursby, 2006) 
20:664:59811:19:19:108:530:482:121:Times:121:Times: Finally, we should note the limitations of our analysis. While our results allow us to make infer-
20:665:59909:19:19:71:537:463:121:Times:121:Times:ences about the nature of faculty consulting, they only provide insights on the nature of consulting which 
20:666:60016:19:19:71:521:444:121:Times:121:Times:results in patents. This research shows, however, that a view of university research which does not ac-
20:667:60119:19:19:71:531:425:121:Times:121:Times:count for such faculty work in industrial settings will miss a good deal of the innovative work produced 
20:668:60224:19:19:71:347:406:121:Times:121:Times:by U.S. university science and engineering faculty members.

21:678:60868:0:12:72:267:709:121:Times:121:Times:Appendix: Name Ranking and Screening 
21:679:60904:12:13:102:535:697:121:Times:121:Times:Once the university faculty names were paired up with the inventor names and addresses from the 
21:680:61000:13:13:71:522:684:121:Times:121:Times:patent application, a multi-staged name screening process was developed. The first step in the process 
21:681:61103:13:12:71:541:671:121:Times:121:Times:was to check the university address with the address provided for the inventor on the patent application. If 
21:682:61212:12:13:71:531:659:121:Times:121:Times:the university zip code was a distance of more than 50 miles from the inventor address in the patent, the 
21:683:61318:13:13:71:524:646:121:Times:121:Times:patent was removed from the database. This conservative approach will likely remove some valid pair-
21:684:61418:13:12:71:536:633:121:Times:121:Times:ings; however there is no reason to believe this approach introduces any bias between patents assigned to 
21:685:61524:12:13:72:300:621:121:Times:121:Times:a university and those not assigned to a university.  
21:686:61578:13:12:101:531:608:121:Times:121:Times:Once the zip code distances were established, surname data from the 1990 Census was employed 
21:687:61671:12:13:72:525:596:121:Times:121:Times:to evaluate the incidence of each name. Over 60,000 surnames and their frequency of occurrence were 
21:688:61771:13:13:72:524:583:121:Times:121:Times:downloaded from the U.S. Census Bureau. This represents over 88% of the total surnames in the 1990 
21:689:61870:13:12:72:533:570:121:Times:121:Times:Census database. The most commonly used name was “Smith” representing 1.006% of the Census popu-
21:690:61966:12:13:72:521:558:121:Times:121:Times:lation. The lower end of our surname dataset contains names representing less than 0.000125% of the 
21:691:62066:13:13:72:159:545:121:Times:121:Times:census population.  
21:692:62086:13:12:101:521:532:121:Times:121:Times:We then categorized each inventor into one of 6 name match types. We utilized this data to set 
21:693:62181:12:13:71:538:520:121:Times:121:Times:name matching cutoff points for each type of name match. For example if a name matched completely on 
21:694:62282:13:13:71:528:507:121:Times:121:Times:first, middle and last name for the university faculty listing and the patent listing it was a ‘type 1’ name 
21:695:62391:13:12:71:540:494:121:Times:121:Times:match. Given that this match type is the most rigorous we set the most permissible threshold for this type. 
21:696:62499:12:13:71:536:482:121:Times:121:Times:One could ask why we did not accept all of the matches for this name type however we chose a conserva-
21:697:62601:13:13:71:526:469:121:Times:121:Times:tive approach to limit a name such as “James Robert Smith” from our dataset due to the relatively high 
21:698:62704:13:12:71:539:456:121:Times:121:Times:occurrence of each of those three names. Our optimal threshold (0.8%) eliminates any Smith and Johnson 
21:699:62807:12:13:71:194:444:121:Times:121:Times:surnames from the dataset.  
21:700:62835:13:13:101:538:431:121:Times:121:Times:The next name types are a full match for two names and also a match of initials for the other name 
21:701:62934:13:12:71:534:418:121:Times:121:Times:(either first or middle). Our optimal threshold (0.28%) eliminates the top 13 possible surnames from this 
21:702:63040:12:13:71:528:406:121:Times:121:Times:name type. Next we considered those names with matching first and last and a missing middle name or 
21:703:63140:13:12:71:532:393:121:Times:121:Times:initial. We set the threshold (0.1%) for this category to eliminate the top 75 surnames. Therefore a name 
21:704:63246:12:13:71:529:381:121:Times:121:Times:such as “John Sanders” in this name type is deleted from the dataset. The final two categories deal with 
21:705:63351:13:13:71:523:368:121:Times:121:Times:only initials matching in the first and/or middle names. In the case where both first and middle initials 
21:706:63457:13:12:71:533:355:121:Times:121:Times:match, our threshold (0.03%) eliminates 378 possible surnames so that “M.B. Walton” would be deleted 
21:707:63558:12:13:71:525:343:121:Times:121:Times:from our dataset. Finally when only one initial was a match, we set a threshold (0.0005%) to eliminate 
21:708:63661:13:13:71:526:330:121:Times:121:Times:over 18,800 surnames so that “R. Acres” would be deleted. These thresholds yielded about 90% of our 
21:709:63761:13:12:71:269:317:121:Times:121:Times:database to continue on for further analysis.  
21:710:63808:12:13:107:531:305:121:Times:121:Times:Next we sought a secondary source to verify the university affiliation for each remaining name. 
21:711:63904:13:13:71:541:292:121:Times:121:Times:Here we focused on patents that were not assigned to a university. We reasoned the likelihood of a faculty 
21:712:64011:13:12:72:533:279:121:Times:121:Times:match is quite high if the inventor assigns the patent to a university. We utilized the National Faculty Di-
21:713:64119:12:13:72:527:267:121:Times:121:Times:rectory (NFD) from years just prior and after the patent application date. Realizing the NFD is oriented 
21:714:64224:13:13:72:534:254:121:Times:121:Times:towards textbook publishers and may not have some research oriented faculty, we did further school and 
21:715:64327:13:12:72:537:241:121:Times:121:Times:internet searches of faculty not successfully identified through the NFD. Quite often we were able to find 
21:716:64434:12:13:72:533:229:121:Times:121:Times:faculty through the university web-sites sometimes even if they are currently emeritus status. In the case 
21:717:64541:13:13:72:529:216:121:Times:121:Times:where we were not able to explicitly identify the name match with the focal school, the entry was elimi-
21:718:64645:13:0:72:179:203:121:Times:121:Times:nated from our dataset.
