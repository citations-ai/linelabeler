2:37:2171:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:A:Mounting evidence documents a stark correlation between income and health, yet the causal mechanisms
2:38:2271:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:A:behind this gradient are poorly understood. This paper examines the impact of access to expertise on
2:39:2371:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:A:health, and whether unequal access to expertise contributes to the health-income gradient. Our empirical
2:40:2475:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:A:setting, Sweden, allows us to shut down inequality in formal access to health care; we first document
2:41:2576:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:A:that strong socioeconomic gradients nonetheless persist. Second, we study the effect of access to health-related
2:42:2688:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:A:expertise – captured by the presence of a health professional in the extended family – on health. Exploiting
2:43:2796:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:A:“admissions lotteries” into medical schools and variation in the timing of degrees, we show that access
2:44:2899:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:A:to intra-family medical expertise has far-reaching health consequences, at all ages: It raises longevity,
2:45:3004:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:A:improves drug adherence and reduces the occurrence of lifestyle-related disease in adulthood, raises
2:46:3104:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:A:vaccination rates in adolescence, and reduces tobacco exposure in utero. Third, we show that the effects
2:47:3208:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:A:of expertise are larger at the lower end of the income distribution – precisely where access to expertise
2:48:3313:14:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:A:is scarcer. Unequal access to health-related expertise can account for as much as 18% of the health-SES
2:49:3416:14:42:72:439:420:12:Times:12:Times:A:gradient, and may thus play a significant role in sustaining health inequality.

3:72:3918:28:18:62:549:691:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:Poorer people have worse health at birth, are sicker in adulthood, and die younger than richer people. Indeed,
3:73:4028:18:17:62:549:673:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:mounting evidence across various disciplines reveals stark correlations between health capital throughout the
3:74:4137:17:18:62:549:656:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:course of life and a range of measures of socioeconomic status (SES), such as education, social class, and income
3:75:4250:18:18:62:492:638:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:(see, e.g., Marmot et al., 1991;Case et al.,2002;Deaton,2002;Currie,2009;Lleras-Muney,2018).
3:76:4342:18:18:77:549:620:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:There is less evidence, however, on the exact pathways between SES and health. Multiple channels have
3:77:4443:18:18:62:549:602:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:been proposed. First, early-life health disparities driven by differentialin uteroconditions or genetic capital may
3:78:4558:18:18:62:549:584:10:g_d0_f2:7:g_d0_f4:B:perpetuate economic inequality (see, e.g.,Currie,2011;Aizer and Currie,2014;Persson and Rossin-Slater,2018).1
3:79:4667:18:18:62:549:566:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:Second, differences in health investments through diet, addictive behaviors, physical activity, and utilization of
3:80:4781:18:18:62:549:548:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:healthcare could lead to differential health outcomes.2Third, individuals on the lower rungs of the income ladder
3:81:4894:18:18:62:549:530:10:g_d0_f2:7:g_d0_f4:B:tend to have jobs that involve more manual labor, may experience more stress, and live in more polluted areas.3
3:82:5005:18:18:62:549:512:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:Finally, health disparities across the income distribution could be driven by differential treatment conditional
3:83:5117:18:18:62:549:494:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:on disease, due to differences in formal insurance coverage, the quality of available medical care, or individuals’
3:84:5232:18:18:62:549:476:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:ability to navigate the health care system.4The relative contributions of these channels (or existence of others)
3:85:5345:18:18:62:257:458:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:to the health-SES gradient remain unknown.
3:86:5387:18:18:77:549:440:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:In this paper, we investigate one possible underlying factor: the role of (unequal) access to health-related
3:87:5495:18:18:62:549:422:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:expertise. Intuitively, if health-related expertise improves health investment decisions, then an unequal distri-
3:88:5608:18:17:62:549:404:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:bution of expertise across the income ladder would induce a socioeconomic gradient in health. The goal of this
3:89:5718:17:18:62:549:387:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:paper is to shed light on, first, whether better access to expertise improves health; and second, to quantify the
3:90:5831:18:18:62:549:369:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:importance of this channel in sustaining health inequality. We use the presence of a health professional within
3:91:5942:18:18:62:355:351:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the family as a broad measure of access to health-related expertise.
3:92:6010:18:18:77:549:333:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Investigating the causal impact of access to health-related expertise on health and the importance of this
3:93:6116:18:18:62:549:315:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:channel in perpetuating health inequality requires addressing two challenges. First, as emphasized byCurrie
3:94:6223:18:18:62:549:297:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:(2011), analyses of health inequality, while ubiquitous, suffer from a lack of comprehensive data on health
3:95:6330:18:18:62:549:279:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:outcomes, often relying on self-reported health rather than medical records, coupled with a lack of detailed
3:96:6438:18:18:62:550:261:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:measures of socioeconomic status. WhileChetty et al.(2016) overcome this by linking mortality data to tax
3:97:6543:18:15:62:549:243:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:records, an analysis of inequality in health outcomes other than mortality requires data linking individual medical
3:98:6658:15:12:73:549:228:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:1For more evidence on the causal relationship between early-life health and future economic outcomes, see, e.g.,Black et al.(2007);
3:99:6789:12:9:62:549:216:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:Oreopoulos et al.(2008);Bharadwaj et al.(2018a).Almond and Mazumder(2011) document a causal link between low birthweight
3:100:6909:9:10:62:549:207:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:and disability in adulthood. In the context of Sweden,Bharadwaj et al.(2018b) provide causal estimates of own birthweight on a
3:101:7035:10:7:62:225:197:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:range of own outcomes, including mortality.
3:102:7078:7:12:73:549:190:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:2See, e.g.,Rehm et al.(2016) on dietary intake,Hiscock et al.(2012) on smoking, andOgden et al.(2010) on obesity. The
3:103:7195:12:9:62:550:178:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:formation of these health behaviors is poorly understood (Hut and Oster,2018provides the most recent example), and recent
3:104:7316:9:10:62:549:169:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:evidence emphasizes differences in education (e.g.Allcott et al.,2017), peer imitation (e.g.Fowler and Christakis,2008, Rosenquist
3:105:7446:10:9:62:549:159:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:et al.,2010,Rosenquist et al.,2011,Salvy et al.,2012) or costs (e.g.Walker et al.,2010,Allcott et al.,2017and the broader literature
3:106:7578:9:7:62:294:150:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:on food deserts;Meckel,2017on a food program for mothers).
3:107:7636:7:12:73:549:143:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:3See, e.g.,Clougherty et al.(2010) on types of employment,Kunz-Ebrecht et al.(2004) on stress, andIsen et al.(2017) on
3:108:7754:12:10:62:549:131:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:pollution exposure. Also seeFinkelstein et al.(2018a) andBjörkegren(2018) for estimates of the causal effect of location on elderly
3:109:7885:10:9:62:77:121:8:g_d0_f6:6:g_d0_f5:F:mortality and youth health, respectively.4
3:110:7927:9:10:77:549:112:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:Differential access to formal insurance has traditionally been one of the impediments to studying the health-inequality gradient
3:111:8055:10:9:62:549:102:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:in the United States, as insurance coverage varies significantly across income and within income across stages of life. Differences in
3:112:8189:9:9:62:549:93:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:health by income have thus traditionally been partially attributed to differential access to care resulting from differential coverage.
3:113:8324:9:10:62:549:84:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:While Americans at the upper end of the income distribution are likely to be covered by employer-sponsored health insurance from
3:114:8452:10:9:62:549:74:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:birth until they turn 65, coverage is more sporadic in the lower quartiles of the income distribution and may involve moving in and
3:115:8583:9:0:62:249:65:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:out of insurance coverage throughout the lifecycle.
4:116:8635:0:18:62:549:719:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:records to detailed measures of income. Second, individuals receive streams of information relevant to their health
4:117:8750:18:18:62:549:701:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:from many sources throughout their lifetime, and this exposure is not randomly assigned. Thus, it is difficult to
4:118:8863:18:18:62:549:683:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:separate the impact of better access to expertise from other unobservable differences between individuals with
4:119:8973:18:18:62:170:665:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:and without such access.
4:120:8997:18:17:77:549:647:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:We address the first challenge by leveraging Swedish administrative population-wide tax records linked to
4:121:9102:17:18:62:549:630:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:inpatient, outpatient, prescription drug, and birth records, described in Section 2. Beyond the availability of
4:122:9213:18:18:62:549:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:data, Sweden is a particularly attractive empirical context because its universal health insurance system allows
4:123:9325:18:18:62:549:594:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:us to shut down another often-hypothesized driver of health inequality: inequality in formal access to health
4:124:9434:18:18:62:549:576:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:care. In Section 3, we begin by documenting three robust facts in this setting: Health inequality emerges early
4:125:9545:18:18:62:549:558:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:in life, persists throughout adulthood, and is, at the end of life, as pronounced in Sweden as it is in the United
4:126:9659:18:18:62:549:540:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:States.5These facts underscore the importance of studying other drivers of health inequality, and motivate our
4:127:9769:18:18:62:342:522:10:g_d0_f2:7:g_d0_f4:B:subsequent analysis of the role of (unequal) access to expertise.6
4:128:9835:18:18:77:549:504:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:To address the second challenge – non-random allocation of access to health-related expertise – we zoom
4:129:9938:18:18:62:549:486:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:into an environment where we can precisely measure individuals’ access to expertise, and where the institutional
4:130:10050:18:18:62:549:468:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:setting provides several sources of variation for causal identification. We hypothesize that members of a health
4:131:10162:18:18:62:549:450:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:professional’s extended family have informal access to health-related expertise, and that this may improve their
4:132:10274:18:18:62:549:432:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:investments into their own health capital. If so, then we may observe better health, and possibly lower mortality,
4:133:10388:18:18:62:342:414:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:among individuals with access to intra-family medical expertise.
4:134:10452:18:18:77:549:396:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Indeed, this is what we show in Section 4. We begin by comparing the mortality and health outcomes of
4:135:10553:18:17:62:549:378:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:individuals in families with and without a health professional in the raw data. We show that, conditional on
4:136:10661:17:18:62:549:361:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:individual income rank at age 55, individuals with a doctor or nurse in the extended family are more likely to
4:137:10771:18:18:62:549:343:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:survive until age 80 and less likely to suffer from chronic lifestyle-related conditions. Further, children with a
4:138:10885:18:18:62:549:325:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:health professional in the extended family are substantially more likely to have undertaken a preventive investment
4:139:11000:18:18:62:550:307:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:that we observe – HPV vaccination by age 20 – and less likely to have been exposed to tobaccoin utero.7These
4:140:11108:18:18:62:549:289:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:patterns in the raw data remain economically and statistically significant when we control non-parametrically for
4:141:11221:18:18:62:549:271:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:a wide range of observable demographics, in the spirit of the identification strategies pursued byBronnenberg et
4:142:11333:18:18:62:248:253:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:al. (2015) andJohnson and Rehavi(2016).
4:143:11372:18:18:77:549:235:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Comparing demographically equivalent individuals with and without a health professional in the extended
4:144:11475:18:18:62:549:217:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:family may still yield a biased estimate of the effect of intra-family access to expertise ifunobservables are
4:145:11585:18:18:62:549:199:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:correlated with this exposure, however.  To assuage these concerns, we also pursue two quasi-experimental
4:146:11690:18:18:62:549:181:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:approaches to identify causal effects. First, we leverage a set of medical school “admissions lotteries.” In Sweden,
4:147:11806:18:18:62:549:163:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:a centralized admission process usually generates sharp GPA thresholds for admission to any university program.
4:148:11917:18:14:62:549:145:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:Due to substantial grade inflation (see, e.g.,Diamond and Persson,2016), the cutoff for all medical schools hit the
4:149:12032:14:12:73:549:131:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:5Data from the United States used in this comparison is reported by the Health Inequality Project https://healthinequality.org/.
4:150:12160:12:10:62:549:119:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:Also see Sjogren and Hartman (2018) for an analysis of how mortality inequality has evolved over time in Sweden. A large body of
4:151:12288:10:9:62:549:109:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:research on early-life health has documented that poor children are born less healthy than their advantaged counterparts; also, see,
4:152:12420:9:7:62:533:100:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:e.g., Currie and Moretti(2007) andRoyer(2009) for evidence of intergenerational correlations with early life health in the US.
4:153:12546:7:12:73:549:93:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:6The idea of considering factors other than formal access to healthcare is consistent with the largely mixed findings of a voluminous
4:154:12679:12:10:62:549:81:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:literature (mostly in US settings) that has investigated the causal effect of health insurance – which lowers the price and ease of
4:155:12810:10:9:62:77:71:8:g_d0_f6:6:g_d0_f5:F:access to formal healthcare – on long- and short-run health outcomes (Finkelstein et al.,2018b;Sommers et al.,2017).7
4:156:12927:9:0:77:346:62:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:A:We rank children by their parents’ household income percentile at birth.
5:157:13000:0:18:62:549:719:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:top GPA starting in 2002, and admission was randomized within the group of applicants with the highest possible
5:158:13111:18:18:62:549:701:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:GPA. Our identification strategy leverages this randomization, by comparing family members of applicants to
5:159:13218:18:18:62:446:683:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:medical school with a top GPA who were admitted and not admitted to medical school.
5:160:13301:18:18:77:549:665:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Our results from the lottery analysis are consistent with our non-parametric findings and show far-reaching
5:161:13408:18:17:62:549:647:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:health benefits for the admitted applicants’ extended family (including grandparents, parents, siblings, children,
5:162:13522:17:18:62:549:630:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:cousins, and in-laws). Among older relatives, access to intra-family expertise reduces the occurrence of lifestyle-
5:163:13637:18:18:62:549:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:related diseases and improves drug adherence. For example, eight years after the applicant’s matriculation, older
5:164:13750:18:18:62:549:594:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:relatives are 3 (5) percentage points less likely to have had a heart attack (heart failure), and 27% more likely to
5:165:13866:18:18:62:549:576:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:adhere to medication that can prevent heart attacks. Among younger relatives, access to intra-family expertise
5:166:13976:18:18:62:549:558:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:also raises preventive investments: adolescents are 20 percentage points more likely to be vaccinated against HPV
5:167:14089:18:18:62:500:540:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:by the age 25. Further, children have fewer inpatient stays, suggesting general health improvements.
5:168:14189:18:18:77:549:522:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:While the medical school lottery resembles an ideal experiment, this design only permits a relatively short
5:169:14296:18:18:62:549:504:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:follow-up period, as the lotteries were recent. This precludes studying outcomes such as mortality and the gradual
5:170:14410:18:18:62:549:486:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:onset of some lifestyle-related chronic conditions, as the parents of medical school applicants are relatively young
5:171:14526:18:18:62:549:468:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:(while grandparents are frequently already deceased). We therefore complement this analysis with a second quasi-
5:172:14638:18:18:62:549:450:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:experimental approach: event studies that compare individuals’ health before and after their (often younger)
5:173:14746:18:18:62:549:432:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:family member receives either a medical degreeor a law degree.8We find striking differences in the health and
5:174:14855:18:18:62:549:414:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:mortality profiles of the two groups in the raw data, and our results are confirmed in a rich regression specification
5:175:14973:18:18:62:549:396:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:that reveal little trends in health outcomes predating the arrival of a health professional or lawyer in the family.
5:176:15089:18:17:62:549:378:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:“Getting” a doctor in the family yields a 10% reduction in mortality 25 years after the doctor’s matriculation,
5:177:15200:17:18:62:549:361:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:along with substantially lower rates of heart attacks, heart failure, diabetes, and lung cancer.  These effects
5:178:15311:18:18:62:435:343:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:emerge gradually, which points to improved health behaviors over a long time period.
5:179:15395:18:18:77:549:325:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Despite the fact that the results from our three identification strategies are not directly comparable due to the
5:180:15508:18:18:62:549:307:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:different samples and time horizons, they deliver largely overlapping insights, which underscores their credibility.
5:181:15624:18:18:62:549:289:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:In sum, access to intra-family medical expertise improves physical health and raises investment in health capital,
5:182:15738:18:18:62:549:271:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:at all ages. Moreover, across all empirical approaches and outcomes, we find that the treatment effects are equal
5:183:15851:18:18:62:549:253:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:or more pronounced at the lower end of the income distribution, suggesting that the value of intra-family health
5:184:15963:18:18:62:214:235:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:expertise is larger among the poor.
5:185:15998:18:18:77:549:217:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Section 5 discusses the mechanism and the implications of our findings for health inequality. We find no
5:186:16102:18:18:62:549:199:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:evidence of income effects. Similarly, our results do not appear to stem from preferential treatment, e.g., through
5:187:16217:18:18:62:549:181:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:higher-cost procedures or faster care, which would come at the expense of patients who lack intra-family medical
5:188:16329:18:18:62:549:163:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:connections. Instead, intra-family transmission of health-related expertise increases preventive investments and
5:189:16441:18:18:62:549:145:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:induces behavioral changes that, from society’s perspective, are simple, cheap, and inherentlynot“zero-sum”: for
5:190:16553:18:18:62:549:127:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:example, adherence to low-cost but highly effective preventive drugs, take-up of universally accessible vaccines,
5:191:16666:18:14:62:267:109:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:and cessation of tobacco use during pregnancy.
5:192:16712:14:13:73:549:95:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:8The comparison of morbidity and mortality profiles at older ages between parents of doctors and lawyers is motivated by the
5:193:16836:13:9:62:549:82:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:fact that doctors and lawyers are both high-social status professions with similar income distributions; we verify that the parents of
5:194:16970:9:0:62:324:73:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:lawyers and doctors also have similar income distributions in the data.
6:195:17042:0:18:77:549:719:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:This, in turn, suggests that the benefits accruing to health professionals’ family members may, at least in
6:196:17149:18:18:62:549:701:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:part, be scalable through policies that mimic intra-family provision of expertise and promote these preventive
6:197:17259:18:18:62:549:683:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:investments and behavioral changes. What’s more, as we document weakly larger impacts of expertise at the
6:198:17364:18:18:62:549:665:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:lower end of the income distribution, such policies may have the potential to close part of the health-income gap
6:199:17477:18:17:62:198:647:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:(see, e.g., Lleras-Muney,2018).
6:200:17508:17:18:77:549:630:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:To explore this point, we use our results to create a “universal access to expertise” counterfactual. That is, we
6:201:17621:18:18:62:549:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:ask how the health-SES gradient would change if we gave everyone in society access to expertise. An input into
6:202:17731:18:18:62:549:594:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:this calculation, in addition to our estimated treatment effects, is the baseline distribution of access to expertise
6:203:17848:18:18:62:549:576:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:in society (in the absence of any policy intervention). Data from the European Social Survey shows that this
6:204:17956:18:18:62:549:558:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:distribution is skewed, with less expertise among low-SES individuals. Consequently, a larger share of low-SES
6:205:18066:18:18:62:517:540:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:individuals (than high-SES individuals) wouldgainexpertise under a universal expertise counterfactual.
6:206:18168:18:18:77:549:522:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Our back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that providing universal access to expertise, and thereby equal-
6:207:18278:18:18:62:549:504:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:izing access to expertise across the income distribution, could close as much as 18% of the health inequality
6:208:18387:18:18:62:549:486:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:gap. While this universal expertise benchmark is instructive in its own right – not the least by emphasizing that
6:209:18500:18:18:62:549:468:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:unequal access to expertise can generate substantial health inequality, even in a setting with equalized access to
6:210:18614:18:18:62:549:450:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:health insurance – we close by discussing whether and how a policy maker may be able to mimic intra-family
6:211:18720:18:18:62:549:432:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:provision of expertise.  We speculate that such policies could be driven by both public and private entities,
6:212:18829:18:18:62:508:414:10:g_d0_f2:7:g_d0_f4:B:encompassing public health interventions as well as targeted design of private health insurance plans.9
6:213:18932:18:18:77:549:396:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Our work builds on and contributes to several strands of the literature. While a broad literature studies

6:216:19246:18:18:62:549:343:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:importance of the family as a nexus for transmission of expertise, information, and norms. For example,Hvide

6:218:19462:18:18:62:549:307:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:parent-child transmission of know-how and norms relevant to innovation. We instead focus on familial transfers
6:219:19572:18:18:62:549:289:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:of health-related expertise; further, we do not restrict attention to the the nuclear family, but analyze these
6:220:19683:18:18:62:242:271:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:processes in the broader extended family.
6:221:19724:18:18:77:549:253:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Our focus on health-related expertise relates the paper to the large and growing literature in many fields
6:222:19830:18:18:62:549:235:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:that analyzes the impact of information, broadly defined, on health behaviors, including the following most

6:224:20043:18:18:62:549:199:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:– and show that dietary habits fail to respond to an individual’s own disease diagnosis or to governmental diet

6:228:20491:12:10:62:549:136:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:health history and habits that come with a relationship that spans a long period of time, effective policies may need to strive to
6:229:20621:10:9:62:549:126:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:mimic the depth of these relationships. One example of such a policy may be a nurse outreach program with a strong emphasis

6:231:20872:10:9:62:549:107:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:the patient (in their case, same-race providers) may gain more trust. Having a health professional in the family can essentially be
6:232:21003:9:10:62:549:98:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:thought of as one extreme on the spectrum between “unconnected” to the health care system and “connected within the family” on
6:233:21129:10:9:62:549:88:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:the other (the case that we study). Existing literature documents positive health impacts of interventions that lie “in between” on
6:234:21260:9:10:62:549:79:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:this spectrum, such as nurse home visiting programs (see, e.g.,Wüst,2012;Hjort et al.,2017) and community health care centers
6:235:21385:10:0:62:504:69:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:(see, e.g.,Bailey and Goodman-Bacon,2015). See Appendix SectionC for a more detailed discussion of this literature.

7:237:21610:18:18:62:549:701:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:theirs in that they underscore the importance of one’s family for models of health behaviors.  We explore a
7:238:21717:18:18:62:549:683:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:different mechanism, however: rather than salience of a health condition or the arrival of information about
7:239:21825:18:18:62:549:665:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:genetic disposition towards a disease, we analyze the role of spillovers from expert knowledge in the family. Our
7:240:21938:18:17:62:549:647:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:focus on expertise about health relates toJohnson and Rehavi(2016) who show that female physicians are less
7:241:22045:17:18:62:549:630:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:likely to receive a c-section when they themselves give birth, suggesting that their expertise on the health costs
7:242:22159:18:18:62:549:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:of this procedure affects their own health care consumption, and toArtmann et al.(2019) who study healthcare

7:244:22325:18:18:77:549:576:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:More generally, our findings contribute to the literature documenting a positive association between educa-
7:245:22432:18:18:62:549:558:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:tional attainment and own health and health behaviors (see, e.g.,Cutler and Lleras-Muney,2008;Cutler and
7:246:22536:18:18:62:549:540:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:Lleras-Muney,2010;Meghir et al.,2018). Further,Currie and Moretti(2003) document positive spillovers of
7:247:22639:18:18:62:549:522:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:maternal education on child health as measured by birth weight.11We build on this literature by considering a
7:248:22748:18:18:62:495:504:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:precise type of education – a medical degree – and by analyzing spillovers across large family trees.
7:249:22849:18:18:77:549:486:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, contrary to the papers cited above, on expertise and information broadly defined or on educational
7:250:22956:18:18:62:549:468:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:attainment in particular, we quantitatively explore the implications of our findings for the broader question
7:251:23065:18:18:62:550:450:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:of the roots of health inequality, relating our work to a plethora of research on health inequality.12Here, we
7:252:23175:18:18:62:549:432:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:make two distinct contributions.  First, we deliver estimates of the health-income gradient and show that it
7:253:23283:18:18:62:549:414:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:steepens over time using comprehensive, non-self-reported data on both health outcomes and precise measures
7:254:23390:18:18:62:549:396:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:of income.13Second, we provide quasi-experimental evidence on one particular causal mechanism underlying the
7:255:23498:18:41:62:509:378:10:g_d0_f2:7:g_d0_f4:B:health-income gradient, and show that it may play an important role in sustaining health inequality.14

7:257:23633:31:25:62:221:306:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:2.1  Healthcare in Sweden
7:258:23658:25:18:62:549:281:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:Swedish healthcare is a textbook case of a universal health insurance system. The government runs a large public
7:259:23770:18:17:62:549:263:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:insurer and finances its expenditures from tax revenue. Coverage includes inpatient care, primary and specialty
7:260:23881:17:15:62:549:246:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:outpatient care, and prescription pharmaceuticals. Patients incur little out of pocket cost, paying at most a
7:261:23990:15:12:69:549:231:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:10Similarly, Bronnenberg et al.(2015) provide evidence on how expert knowledge among pharmacists affects their willingness to
7:262:24115:12:7:62:247:219:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:pay for branded (versus genetic) pharmaceuticals.
7:263:24164:7:12:69:549:212:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:11McCrary and Royer(2011) also establish a positive effect of maternal education on infant health. Further,Lundborg and Majlesi
7:264:24291:12:10:62:549:200:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:(2018) exploit a Swedish compulsory schooling reform to document spillovers in the opposite direction, from children’s education to

7:270:24976:9:10:77:549:143:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:The fact that the gradient weekly steepens throughout childhood and adolescence is consistent with evidence (using less granular
7:271:25104:10:9:62:549:133:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:measures of socioeconomic status) from the United States byCase et al.(2002), from Canada byCurrie and Stabile(2006), and
7:272:25225:9:7:62:241:124:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:from the United Kingdom byCase et al.(2008).
7:273:25269:7:12:69:549:117:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:14Our exercise relates to that ofAizer and Stroud(2010), who show that the arrival of novel information – in particular, the
7:274:25393:12:10:62:549:105:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:Surgeon General’s recommendation, made in 1964, that women should refrain from smoking during pregnancy – induced women
7:275:25512:10:9:62:549:95:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:with higher education to respond but elicited little response among mothers with lower educational attainment, thus increasing
7:276:25638:9:9:62:549:86:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:inequality at birth. Our findings, in contrast, suggest that intra-family expertise elicits a weakly larger response at the lower end of
7:277:25774:9:0:62:151:77:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:the income distribution.
8:278:25799:0:18:62:549:719:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:small co-pay.15Further, the public safety net reduces existing out of pocket obligations for some particularly
8:279:25909:18:18:62:549:701:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:vulnerable groups. Thus, in practice, individuals at any point in the income distribution have the same formal
8:280:26019:18:35:62:151:683:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:access to healthcare.
8:281:26040:35:24:62:121:648:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:2.2  Data
8:282:26049:24:18:62:549:624:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:For the universe of individuals living in Sweden over an extended time period, we use detailed mortality and
8:283:26157:18:18:62:549:606:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:medical records, matched to individual-level tax and educational records and a mapping of family trees spanning
8:284:26268:18:18:62:549:588:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:up to four generations.16Here, we describe the overall structure of the data; in subsequent sections, we define
8:285:26379:18:32:62:387:570:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the variables and sub-populations that we use in each part of the analysis.
8:286:26454:32:18:62:549:538:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f2:B:Overall sampleWe have data on the universe of individuals born between 1936 and 2016 that were living
8:287:26555:18:17:62:549:520:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:in Sweden in 1961 or at some later point in time. For these individuals, we know the exact year and month of
8:288:26663:17:18:62:549:503:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:birth, as well as the year of death (recorded starting with 1961 and up until 2017), and whether the individual
8:289:26774:18:18:62:549:485:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:was born in Sweden. From Statistics Sweden we obtain a file that connects each individual in this sample to the
8:290:26885:18:18:62:549:467:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:individual’s mother and father. Equipped with these data, we can connect all individuals born in 1936 or later to
8:291:26998:18:18:62:549:449:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:both their own parents, as well as to their siblings and descendants – children, nieces, nephews, and grandchildren.
8:292:27114:18:32:62:521:431:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:Similarly, for later-born cohorts, these data allow us to identify parents, aunts, uncles, and grandparents.
8:293:27222:32:18:62:549:399:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f2:B:Socioeconomic informationWe merge these data to annual income tax records for the adult population (age
8:294:27325:18:18:62:549:381:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:16-74) over a 27-year time period, 1990 - 2016. These records contain detailed, third-party reported information
8:295:27437:18:18:62:549:363:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:about labor income, financial income, government transfers, as well as self-reported information about self-
8:296:27545:18:18:62:550:345:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:employment income. We use individual work and business income in our analysis.17The average individual
8:297:27647:18:18:62:549:327:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:pre-tax work and business income (among individuals with a positive income) in the last year of our data (2016)
8:298:27758:18:18:62:549:309:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:is 298,597 SEK ($34,878) with a standard deviation of 256,047 SEK. In the same database, we also observe
8:299:27862:18:18:62:549:291:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:educational attainment at an annual level, which allows us to know when individuals complete their degrees and
8:300:27972:18:31:62:182:273:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:which subject they studied.
8:301:27999:31:18:62:549:242:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f2:B:Healthcare recordsTo construct measures of health outcomes, health investments, and healtcare utilization
8:302:28104:18:18:62:549:224:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:throughout individuals’ lives, we merge in information from inpatient records, specialist outpatient care records,
8:303:28218:18:18:62:549:206:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:prescription drug records, and cause of death records.  Inpatient records cover years 1997 to 2016, specialist
8:304:28328:18:18:62:549:188:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:outpatient records years 2001 to 2016, and prescription drug records years 2005 to 2017. The inpatient records
8:305:28438:18:15:62:549:170:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:contain information on the universe of a patient’s visits to the hospital, including cases where the individual is
8:306:28552:15:12:69:549:155:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:15Once a patient’s out-of-pocket cost for medical care reaches SEK 1100 ($120) over a twelve month period, the co-pay is zero
8:307:28677:12:10:62:549:143:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:for all subsequent care during the remainder of the twelve-month period. Similarly, for prescription drugs, once ahousehold’s total
8:308:28808:10:9:62:549:133:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:out of pocket spending reaches SEK 2300 ($247) over a twelve month period, the co-pay is zero for all subsequent prescription fills
8:309:28939:9:10:62:549:124:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:during the remainder of the twelve-month period. For the purposes of calculating a household’s total out-of-pocket drug spending,
8:310:29068:10:9:62:76:114:8:g_d0_f6:6:g_d0_f5:F:a household is defined as one adult plus all children aged 18 or below that reside in the same abode.16
8:311:29171:9:7:77:438:105:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:A:Statistics Sweden provides detailed description of the administrative registry data at www.scb.se.
8:312:29269:7:12:69:549:98:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:17We examined several alternative measures of income, varying whether government transfers and investment income is included or
8:313:29396:12:9:62:549:86:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:excluded in the income measure. We did not find that our results were sensitive to these alternative specifications, as these variations
8:314:29532:9:0:62:163:77:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:tend to be rank-preserving.
9:315:29560:0:18:62:550:719:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:admitted and discharged on the same day. The outpatient data records all visitsoutside ofprimary care.18For
9:316:29667:18:18:62:549:701:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:each inpatient admission and outpatient specialist visit, the data contain rich information on the date of the visit,
9:317:29784:18:18:62:549:683:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the associated International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9 and ICD-10) diagnosis codes, procedure codes, and
9:318:29896:18:18:62:549:665:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the length of stay (for inpatient admissions). Drug records contain the universe of an individual’s prescription
9:319:30008:18:17:62:549:647:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:drug purchases made in pharmacies, but do not include over the counter drugs or drugs administered in hospitals.
9:320:30120:17:18:62:549:630:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:For each prescription drug purchase, the data contain the drug name, the active substance, the average daily
9:321:30228:18:18:62:549:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:dose, and the drug’s Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification code. The ATC classification allows
9:322:30337:18:32:62:183:594:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:us to link drugs to diseases.
9:323:30366:32:18:62:549:562:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f2:B:Birth recordsWe further merge in complete medical birth records for the time period between 1995 to 2016,
9:324:30471:18:18:62:549:544:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:matching them to individual tax records. The birth records contain data on the month and year of birth, birth
9:325:30580:18:18:62:549:526:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:weight, birth length, head circumference, gestation (in days), and a variety of diagnosis codes at birth.  We
9:326:30689:18:18:62:549:508:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:also have variables from the electronic medical records related to pregnancy and delivery: tobacco use during
9:327:30798:18:18:62:549:490:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:pregnancy, pregnancy risk factors (diabetes, kidney disease, epilepsy, asthma, hypertension, or urinary infection),
9:328:30913:18:18:62:549:472:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the first date of prenatal care and the number of prenatal visits, caesarean section (c-section) delivery, induction
9:329:31029:18:32:62:329:454:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:of labor, and the occurrence of any complications at delivery.
9:330:31091:32:18:62:550:422:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f2:B:Educational recordsFinally, we merge in educational records for year 2007 and onwards. There are two
9:331:31191:18:18:62:549:404:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:types of records. First, we use high school GPA information. This allows us to find medical school applicants
9:332:31300:18:17:62:549:386:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:with top GPAs, who would be competitive for randomized admission spots. Second, we use college application
9:333:31406:17:18:62:549:369:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:information. As college admissions in Sweden are centralized, we can observe the full set of programs to which
9:334:31516:18:18:62:549:351:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:each individual applies in each application cycle. We also observe admission outcomes, allowing us to track who
9:335:31627:18:42:62:299:333:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:gets admitted into (undergraduate) medical programs.
9:336:31679:42:28:62:298:291:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:3  Inequality in health: the facts
9:337:31713:28:18:62:549:263:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:We begin by documenting three robust stylized facts about health inequality in our setting: Health inequality
9:338:31822:18:18:62:549:245:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:emerges early in life, persists throughout adulthood, and is, at the end of life, as pronounced in Sweden as it
9:339:31933:18:18:62:549:227:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:is in the United States – despite Sweden’s universal health insurance and a generous social safety net. These
9:340:32042:18:18:62:549:209:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:facts underscore the importance of studying the role of factors other than social insurance in sustaining health
9:341:32154:18:32:62:452:191:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:inequality, and motivate our subsequent analysis of the importance of access to expertise.
9:342:32244:32:18:62:550:159:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f2:B:Inequality in mortalityTo study inequality in mortality, we start with all individuals that are alive at age
9:343:32352:18:18:62:549:141:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:55. These individuals are still several years away from retirement, allowing us to measure their work-related
9:344:32461:18:17:62:549:123:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:income, but are old enough to allow us to observe their deaths within our sample period. For each individual in
9:345:32572:17:16:62:549:106:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:this sample, we define an indicator for whether (s)he has died by age 80 – one of the key outcomes throughout
9:346:32681:16:12:69:549:90:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:18Primary care is provided at municipal “Care centrals” (Vårdcentraler); data from these centers has historically not been collected,
9:347:32814:12:9:62:549:78:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:limiting our ability to analyze individuals’ utilization of primary care, except for the case of care during pregnancy, which is recorded
9:348:32951:9:0:62:101:69:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:separately.
10:349:32963:0:18:62:549:719:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:our paper. Panel A of Figure1 plots the share of individuals that died by age 80 against individual income rank
10:350:33074:18:18:62:550:701:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:at age 55.19Despite Sweden’s generous social safety net and equalized formal access to health care, there is a
10:351:33184:18:18:62:549:683:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:strong gradient in cumulative mortality at older ages conditional on surviving to 55.20At the very bottom of
10:352:33292:18:18:62:549:665:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the income distribution, more than 40% have died by age 80; at the very top, the corresponding number is below
10:353:33402:18:17:62:83:647:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:25%.
10:354:33406:17:18:77:549:630:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:It is instructive to briefly put these numbers in relation to the income gradient in mortality that has recently
10:355:33518:18:18:62:550:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:been documented in the U.S.. Figure2 plots one-year log-mortality against own income rank in both countries,
10:356:33626:18:18:62:549:594:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:for three combinations of age at death and age of income measurement for which we were able to construct
10:357:33730:18:18:62:549:576:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:estimates that can can be directly compared to those reported for the U.S. inChetty et al.(2016). In the first
10:358:33840:18:18:62:549:558:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:two panels of Figure2, we plot log-mortality at age 75 against income rank at age 61 in the U.S. and age 60 for
10:359:33951:18:18:62:549:540:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:Sweden (a year before the earliest retirement ages in the respective countries), separately for men (Panel A) and
10:360:34064:18:18:62:549:522:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:women (Panel B).21We observe substantially lower mortality, atanypoint in the relative income distribution, in
10:361:34174:18:18:62:549:504:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:Sweden relative to the U.S., consistent with the notion that universal health insurance and a broad safety net may
10:362:34288:18:18:62:549:486:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:raise a society’s overall level of well-being; however, the slopes of the mortality gradients are nearly identical in
10:363:34405:18:18:62:549:468:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the two countries. The subsequent four panels of Figure2 plot log-mortality at ages 60 and 40, by gender, against
10:364:34518:18:18:62:549:450:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:(gender-cohort-specific) income rank ventile measured two years earlier. While mortality inequality estimated at
10:365:34630:18:18:62:549:432:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:earlier ages is lower in Sweden than in the U.S. – especially age-40 inequality among women – the Swedish data
10:366:34740:18:32:62:320:414:10:g_d0_f2:7:g_d0_f4:B:reveals a pronounced mortality gradient at all three ages.22
10:367:34800:32:17:62:549:382:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f2:B:Inequality in health outcomes in adulthoodTo measure inequality in health outcomes in adulthood,
10:368:34896:17:18:62:549:365:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:we start by defining indicators variables that capture any occurrence, at the individual level, of four common
10:369:35006:18:18:62:549:347:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:conditions that can be linked to lifestyle causes and that we can measure precisely in our data: heart attack,
10:370:35116:18:18:62:549:329:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:heart failure, lung cancer, and type 2 diabetes. PanelB of Figure1 displays the share of individuals aged 55 or
10:371:35227:18:18:62:549:311:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:older that have a history of being diagnosed with at least one of these conditions, against individual income rank
10:372:35341:18:18:62:549:293:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:at age 55. The panel displays a steep gradient in the presence of these lifestyle-related conditions in the adult
10:373:35454:18:18:62:549:275:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:population. Individuals at the bottom ventile of the income distribution are more than twice as likely to have at
10:374:35567:18:18:62:549:257:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:least one of these conditions (20 percent) than individuals at the top ventile (10 percent). The income gradient
10:375:35679:18:18:62:344:239:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:is strongly pronounced in each of the four underlying conditions.
10:376:35744:18:15:77:549:221:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:For younger adults – who do not have a high prevalence of the chronic conditions analyzed above – we
10:377:35844:15:12:69:549:206:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:19We use work-related income defined as the sum of income from employment-related activities as well as (positive) business income
10:378:35974:12:9:62:549:194:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:from self-employment. To calculate the individual’s income rank, we measure individual’s income at age 55, and rank individuals
10:379:36101:9:10:62:549:185:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:within birth cohort and gender. We use cohorts born in Sweden between 1936 and 1937, for whom we observe both income at age
10:380:36224:10:7:62:459:175:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:55 and survival until age 80. The shape of the gradient remains the same if we use household income rank.
10:381:36329:7:12:69:549:168:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:20We investigate, but do not separately report, mortality by gender.  Among men at the at the 5th percentile of the income
10:382:36451:12:9:62:549:156:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:distribution at age 55, 48 percent are no longer alive by age 80; among men at the 95th percentile, the corresponding share is 25
10:383:36580:9:10:62:549:147:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:percent. Female mortality is lower at all points in the income distribution, but we observe a very similar gradient. Women in the
10:384:36709:10:9:62:549:137:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:lowest 5 percent of the income distribution have a 11 percentage point lower probability of being alive than their most advantaged
10:385:36839:9:7:62:249:128:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:peers, 18 percent of whom are not alive by age 80.
10:386:36889:7:12:69:549:121:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:21For these comparisons, we adjust our income measure so that it corresponds to the U.S. (positive) Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)
10:387:37016:12:10:62:549:109:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:measure, as used in Chetty et al.(2016). In particular, we add capital-based income and non-disability government transfers; we
10:388:37143:10:9:62:76:99:8:g_d0_f6:6:g_d0_f5:F:continue excluding individuals with zero or negative income levels.22

11:394:37693:18:18:62:549:665:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:aggregate vaccination levels in our data, while the hollow circles are estimated separately for year 2007, which was
11:395:37809:18:17:62:549:647:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the first year the vaccine was available in Sweden. The figure shows a sharpreversegradient in this preventive
11:396:37919:17:18:62:549:630:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:health measure. Only about 10 percent of women born into households at the bottom of the income distribution
11:397:38027:18:18:62:549:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:get vaccinated against HPV, while 40 percent of women with parents at the top of the income distribution do. In
11:398:38138:18:18:62:549:594:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:2007, the first year that the vaccine was available in Sweden (right y-axis), the levels of vaccination are an order
11:399:38254:18:18:62:549:576:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:of magnitude lower than in the aggregate data. The gradient is similar in shape, however, highlighting that young
11:400:38367:18:18:62:549:558:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:adults coming from more affluent households were much more likely to be early adopters of the new vaccine.
11:401:38473:18:18:62:549:540:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:This evidence of a gradient in the early adoption of a new medical technology is consistent with the argument in
11:402:38585:18:18:62:549:522:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:Link and Phelan(1995) andCutler et al.(2006) that differential adoption of new medical technologies could be
11:403:38693:18:18:62:549:504:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:an important driver of health inequality. Our paper sheds light on a potential mechanism that could drive such
11:404:38803:18:32:62:163:486:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:differences in adoption.
11:405:38827:32:18:62:549:454:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f2:B:Early emergence of the health-SES gradientHaving documented pronounced gradients in mortality, adult
11:406:38927:18:18:62:549:436:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:health, and youth preventive investments in Sweden, we now investigate whether the gradient emerges already
11:407:39034:18:18:62:549:418:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:in early life. This can help formulate or reject hypotheses about the mechanisms that lead to the gradient, and
11:408:39145:18:18:62:506:400:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:also point to the most efficient timing of potential countervailing forces such as exposure to expertise.
11:409:39250:18:17:77:549:382:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:The lifestyle-related health outcomes analyzed above are rare early in life. Hence, to examine the extent of
11:410:39358:17:18:62:549:365:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the health gradient in childhood, we zoom in into one of the most common chronic conditions in childhood -
11:411:39464:18:18:62:549:347:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:asthma.25PanelA of Appendix FigureA1 reports the gradient. We define an indicator that turns on when
11:412:39564:18:18:62:549:329:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:children have a record of an asthma diagnosis in their inpatient or outpatient records at ages zero to five. We
11:413:39675:18:18:62:549:311:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:observe a substantially higher prevalence of asthma among children growing up in lower-SES households than
11:414:39781:18:18:62:253:293:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:among their more advantaged counterparts.
11:415:39822:18:18:77:549:275:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Further, to assess whether there is a gradient even earlier in life, we create two measures of the prenatal
11:416:39929:18:18:62:549:257:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:environment: an indicator for whether the mother is using tobacco right before or during pregnancy and an
11:417:40034:18:18:62:550:239:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:indicator for whether the child experiences a risky birth.26The gradient in tobacco use, depicted in PanelD
11:418:40141:18:18:62:549:221:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:of Figure1, is remarkable, with more than 30 percent of mothers in the bottom income ventile using tobacco
11:419:40247:18:18:62:549:203:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:around the time of pregnancy, as compared to slightly above 5 percent of mothers at the top of the income
11:420:40352:18:18:62:549:185:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:distribution. Tobacco use and especially smoking is known to be associated with substantial risks to the fetus,
11:421:40463:18:18:62:549:167:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:including an increased risk of miscarriage, pre-term birth, and low birth weight (see, e.g.,Centers for Disease
11:422:40574:18:15:62:549:149:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:Control and Prevention,2017); the steep gradient in tobacco exposure in-utero thus implies that babies born into
11:423:40686:15:9:69:445:134:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:A:23Human Papillomavirus (HPV) has been linked to several types of cancer, including cervical cancer.
11:424:40785:9:13:69:549:125:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:24To calculate parental household income rank at birth, we average two years of annual earnings of the child’s mother and father,
11:425:40914:13:9:62:549:112:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:measured one and two years before the child’s birth, respectively; sum them into household income; and rank households within each
11:426:41044:9:7:62:136:103:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f6:F:child’sbirth cohort.
11:427:41064:7:12:69:550:96:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:25Asthma is affecting nearly ten percent of all children in the United States (Chorniy et al.,2017); and in Sweden, already at age
11:428:41194:12:7:62:236:84:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:five roughly 11 percent are affected by asthma.
11:429:41241:7:12:69:549:77:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:26A risky birth is defined as whether the mother has any of the following conditions during pregnancy: chronic kidney diseases,
11:430:41368:12:0:62:541:65:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:diabetes, epilepsy, lung diseases, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), ulcerative colitis, hypertension, or urinary tract infections.
12:431:41502:0:18:62:549:719:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:disadvantaged households have received substantively lower health investments already before birth. Similarly,
12:432:41612:18:18:62:549:701:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:as shown in Panel B of Appendix FigureA1, adverse events at birth are more likely at the bottom of the income
12:433:41721:18:18:62:549:683:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:distribution than at the top,despitethe fact that mothers are almost eight years older at the top of the income
12:434:41832:18:18:62:473:665:10:g_d0_f2:7:g_d0_f4:B:distribution and the latent probability of a high risk pregnancy increases with maternal age.27
12:435:41927:18:17:77:549:647:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, to track the evolution of the health gradient over the life cycle, we use a health measure that is
12:436:42034:17:18:62:549:630:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:relevant at all ages: the number of inpatient visits. PanelC of Appendix FigureA1 displays the gradient in the
12:437:42144:18:18:62:549:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:number of inpatient visits in the first five years of life. While we observe a pronounced gradient already at age
12:438:42257:18:18:62:549:594:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:5, it steepens substantially over the course of the life cycle, as illustrated in PanelD of the same figure, which
12:439:42371:18:18:62:316:576:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:displays the same outcome in the five years from 45 to 50.
12:440:42429:18:18:77:549:558:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:In sum, this section documents that the health-SES gradient emerges early in life and persists and gradually
12:441:42537:18:18:62:549:540:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:steepens throughout the life cycle – despite Sweden’s broad social safety net. This underscores the importance
12:442:42647:18:18:62:549:522:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:of studying the role of factors other than social insurance in sustaining health inequality. In the remainder of
12:443:42759:18:42:62:545:504:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:this paper, we examine one such potential piece of the puzzle: differential exposure to health-related expertise.
12:444:42872:42:31:62:373:462:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:4  Access to expertise and health outcomes
12:445:42914:31:24:62:309:431:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:4.1  Measuring access to health expertise
12:446:42955:24:18:62:549:407:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:We are interested in measuring whether access to health-related expertise affects individuals’ investments into
12:447:43066:18:18:62:549:389:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:their health and their subsequent health outcomes. Access to expertise may affect individuals through multiple
12:448:43176:18:18:62:549:371:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:mechanisms. Experts can transmit new knowledge about the costs and benefits of healthy behaviors and health
12:449:43283:18:18:62:549:353:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:investments, or they can remind, nudge or corroborate existing knowledge, making it more salient and trustworthy.
12:450:43396:18:18:77:549:335:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:While it is intuitive that exposure to any or all of these underlying mechanisms may lead to more health
12:451:43500:18:18:62:549:317:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:investments and better health outcomes (indeed, the provision of knowledge has traditionally been one of the
12:452:43608:18:18:62:549:299:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:most common policy instruments), investigating the causal role of access to expertise is challenging.  First,
12:453:43717:18:18:62:549:281:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:individuals receive streams of information and reminders relevant to their health from many differences sources
12:454:43828:18:17:62:549:263:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:throughout their lifetime, and these flows may be hard to measure; second, exposure to expertise is typically
12:455:43937:17:18:62:549:246:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:not randomly assigned. To overcome these challenges, we zoom in into an environment where we can precisely
12:456:44043:18:18:62:549:228:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:measure individuals’ exposure to expertise, and where the institutional environment provides several sources of
12:457:44154:18:18:62:457:210:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:variation for causal identification: the presence of a health professional (HP) in the family.
12:458:44248:18:18:77:549:192:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Having an HP in the family can affect individuals’ health in a variety of ways, which we can broadly classify
12:459:44357:18:18:62:549:174:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:into two distinct channels. First – and this is our channel of interest – having an HP in the family is likely
12:460:44467:18:18:62:549:156:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:to increase access to health-related expertise in the familial environment. This “access to expertise” channel
12:461:44577:18:18:62:549:138:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:encompasses transmission of (new) health-related knowledge to family members in a variety of informal settings;
12:462:44688:18:18:62:549:120:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:as well as reminding family members to invest into their health by undertaking beneficial health behaviors,
12:463:44795:18:15:62:549:102:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:avoiding harms, adhering to medications, and doing regular check-ups. Second, having an HP in the family may
12:464:44903:15:12:69:549:87:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:27The lowest rate of adverse events, however, occurs in the middle of the income distribution, where mothers are have access to
12:465:45030:12:0:62:229:75:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:more resources, but are still relatively young.
13:466:45079:0:18:62:549:719:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:affect health through what we call the “access to care” channel: this, in turn, encompasses a variety of ways in
13:467:45191:18:18:62:549:701:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:which individuals may leverage the intra-family social capital and connections to the health care system to get
13:468:45302:18:18:62:319:683:10:g_d0_f2:7:g_d0_f4:B:better (for example, more expensive) or faster treatment.28
13:469:45361:18:18:77:549:665:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Throughout our analysis, we are interested in investigating the importance of the “access to expertise” channel,
13:470:45473:18:17:62:549:647:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:for two reasons. First, increasing access to health-related expertise in the population is fundamentally a scalable
13:471:45588:17:18:62:549:630:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:public policy. (In Appendix Section C, we review the extensive literature on several existing interventions that at
13:472:45703:18:18:62:549:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:their core all aim to increase health-related expertise in the population, such as nurse outreach programs, efforts
13:473:45818:18:18:62:549:594:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:to improve the continuity of primary care, and public health campaigns against smoking or for cancer screening.)
13:474:45930:18:18:62:549:576:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:The “access to care” channel in contrast, is fundamentally not scalable, as it implies individuals with family
13:475:46040:18:18:62:549:558:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:connections in the health care system getting ahead of those lacking such connections. This makes any policy
13:476:46148:18:18:62:549:540:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:that increases access to care, holding the total amount of healthcare resources fixed, a zero sum policy. Second,
13:477:46261:18:18:62:549:522:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:historically, the “extensive” margin of disease prevention through changes in social and individual investments
13:478:46372:18:18:62:549:504:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:into health - that we hypothesize can be affected by access to health expertise - has had a larger effect on
13:479:46480:18:18:62:549:486:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:population health than the “intensive” margin of moving from a lower to a higher quality of care provider, or
13:480:46589:18:18:62:389:468:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:getting care faster within a given system (Cutler and Lleras-Muney,2008).
13:481:46662:18:18:77:549:450:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:In this section, we analyze the impact of having a health professional on the extended family’s health; we
13:482:46768:18:18:62:549:432:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:then return to a discussion about the mechanism in Section5.1 – there, we present evidence consistent with the
13:483:46878:18:35:62:368:414:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:“access to expertise” channel being an important driver of our results.
13:484:46949:35:24:62:240:379:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:4.2  Non-parametric evidence
13:485:46977:24:18:62:549:355:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:We use the records of higher education to find individuals with health professional degrees - physicians and nurses
13:486:47092:18:18:62:350:337:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:- among the cohorts of working age adults in our analytic sample.
13:487:47157:18:18:77:549:319:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:We define two groups of individuals who may benefit from (differential degrees of) access to expertise: the
13:488:47264:18:18:62:549:301:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:health professionals’narrowandextendedfamilies, respectively.  The narrow family is defined as the health
13:489:47369:18:18:62:549:283:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:professional’s spouse, parents, parents-in-law, children, and children-in-law. The extended family further includes
13:490:47484:18:18:62:404:265:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the health professional’s siblings, aunts and uncles, grandparents, and cousins.
13:491:47564:18:17:77:549:247:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:We start by documenting differences in health between individuals in families with and without a health
13:492:47667:17:18:62:549:230:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:professional. Panel3A of Figure3 revisits the mortality gradient from Figure1A, but now plots it separately for
13:493:47778:18:18:62:549:212:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:individuals with and without a health professional in theextendedfamily.29We drop observations for individuals
13:494:47888:18:18:62:292:194:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:who are educated as health professionals themselves.
13:495:47940:18:18:77:549:176:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Panel3A reveals two clear patterns in the raw data. First, there is a visually detectable difference in the
13:496:48047:18:15:62:549:158:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:probability of being alive at age 80, which persists throughout the income distribution: Conditional on income
13:497:48157:15:12:69:549:143:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:28Interestingly, in their ongoing workArtmann, Oosterbeek and van der Klaauw(2019) are finding - in the Dutch setting - that
13:498:48281:12:10:62:549:131:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:having a physician in the family in factdoes notresult in substantially increased access to care (on the contrary, it sometimes leads
13:499:48414:10:9:62:76:121:8:g_d0_f6:6:g_d0_f5:F:to less use), neither in terms of the quantity nor in terms of the price of care.29
13:500:48497:9:10:77:549:112:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:Recall that the x-axis is the percentile of the individuals’ age-55 work income rank, where work income includes wage income
13:501:48621:10:9:62:549:102:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:and self-employment income, but excludes government transfers and capital income. Our results are not sensitive to whether we
13:502:48746:9:9:62:549:93:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:include or exclude the other two sources of income. We use work income in our preferred specifications, as intuitively this is a broader
13:503:48882:9:10:62:549:84:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:measure of socio-economic status, pre redistribution programs. We restrict the sample to individuals with positive work income.
13:504:49009:10:9:62:549:74:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:As we condition on work income, we implicitly condition on being alive at age 55. Our results are also not sensitive to replacing
13:505:49138:9:0:62:257:65:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:individual income rank with household income rank.
14:506:49190:0:18:62:549:719:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:rank, individuals with an extended relative who is educated as a physician or a nurse are more likely to survive
14:507:49302:18:18:62:472:701:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:to age 80. Second, this mortality difference is larger at the bottom of the income distribution.
14:508:49398:18:18:77:549:683:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:We estimate the magnitude of the difference in cumulative mortality by age 80 at each income decile using
14:509:49503:18:21:62:200:665:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the following OLS specification:

14:514:49564:30:18:62:549:614:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:Here,Yiis the mortality (or health) outcome of interest for individuali,HPiis an indicator variable that takes

14:516:49782:18:18:62:549:578:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:controls that are included in some specifications. The first term is a sum of indicators for having a medical
14:517:49891:18:18:62:549:560:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:professional in the family interacted with income rank deciles. The coefficients of interest areδd(i)that measure
14:518:50004:18:18:62:549:542:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the average difference in the health outcome between individuals with and without a health professional in the
14:519:50114:18:18:62:549:524:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:extended family, for each age-55 income deciled(i). We report the results of this regression in Panel3B. The
14:520:50222:18:18:62:549:506:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:dashed line reports the estimates ofδd(i)without any controls; thus, these estimates measure the raw vertical
14:521:50331:18:18:62:549:488:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:distance between the two plotted lines in Panel1A. We estimate that, on average, individuals that have at least
14:522:50442:18:18:62:549:470:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:one extended family member who is a doctor or a nurse are 5.9 percentage points less likely to have died by
14:523:50549:18:18:62:549:452:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the age of 80 conditional on being alive at age 55. This is a large difference relative to the average probability
14:524:50663:18:18:62:549:434:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:of having died by age 80 in the full sample, which is 31 percent, as it implies an 19 percent reduction in the
14:525:50773:18:17:62:549:416:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:probability of death. This is equivalent in magnitude to moving from the 70th to 100th percentile in the income
14:526:50884:17:18:62:549:399:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:rank distribution. Further, the difference varies by income rank, ranging from 7 percentage points on average in
14:527:50996:18:18:62:467:381:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the lower half of the distribution to 4 percentage points in the upper half of the distribution.
14:528:51092:18:18:77:549:363:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Next, we examine whether these differences remain when controlling non-parametrically for a wide range
14:529:51194:18:18:62:549:345:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:of observable demographics, in the spirit of the identification strategies pursued byBronnenberg et al.(2015)
14:530:51303:18:18:62:549:327:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:and Johnson and Rehavi(2016). The solid line in Panel3B, as well as Panel A of Table1, report results from
14:531:51409:18:18:62:549:309:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:regression equation (1) including the vector of observablesXi.30The pattern remains qualitatively the same
14:532:51515:18:18:62:549:291:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:across all income deciles: Individuals with a health professional in the family are less likely to have died by age
14:533:51630:18:18:62:437:273:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:80, and the difference is on average larger at the lower end of the income distribution.
14:534:51718:18:18:77:549:255:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:We now revisit the prevalence of chronic conditions that are commonly considered to be linked to lifestyle
14:535:51824:18:18:62:549:237:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:decisions throughout the life-cycle. In panelC of Figure3 we report differences in the probability of having
14:536:51932:18:18:62:549:219:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the following conditions: heart attack, heart failure, type II diabetes, and lung cancer, by whether or not an
14:537:52042:18:18:62:549:201:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:individual has a health professional in the extended family. The conditions are aggregated into a z-score index.
14:538:52154:18:18:62:549:183:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:The raw data again shows a visible separation in the prevalence of these chronic conditions between individuals
14:539:52265:18:18:62:549:165:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:with and without a health professional in their extended families. As the dashed line in PanelD suggests, the
14:540:52374:18:17:62:549:147:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:differences in the raw data are larger at the bottom of the income distribution.  Moreover, less than 50% of
14:541:52482:17:18:62:549:130:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the difference can be explained by our rich set of observables, leaving us with a clear pattern (solid line) of
14:542:52593:18:18:62:549:112:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:significantly lower prevalence of lifestyle-related conditions among older individuals with health professionals in
14:543:52708:18:15:62:549:94:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:their families. As Panel B in Table1 documents, the difference remains on average larger at lower income levels.
14:544:52820:15:12:69:549:79:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:30The vector of controls includes fixed effects for: own income rank percentile, highest-earning relative’s income percentile, year
14:545:52951:12:0:62:436:67:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:of birth, gender, individual’s (discretized) educational attainment, and county of residence at age 55.
15:546:53056:0:18:77:550:719:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 4 reports similar analyses for younger ages. In PanelsA and B we examine the probability of young
15:547:53160:18:18:62:549:701:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:women receiving the HPV vaccine by age 20. We observe large differences in the probability of these health
15:548:53266:18:18:62:549:683:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:investments across young adults with and without a health professional in the family, across all points in the
15:549:53376:18:18:62:549:665:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:income distribution. About two thirds of the differences persist when we control for observable characteristics,
15:550:53488:18:17:62:440:647:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:as can be seen in Panel C in Table1 as well as in the solid line in PanelB of Figure4.
15:551:53574:17:18:77:549:630:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, panels4C and4D report the same analysis for the probability of being exposed to tobacco usein
15:552:53676:18:18:62:549:612:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:B:utero. We observe large differences in tobacco exposure rates for an unborn child in families with and without
15:553:53786:18:18:62:549:594:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:a health professional (including the mother of the child herself), especially at the lower deciles of the income
15:554:53898:18:18:62:549:576:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:distribution.31A child with parents in the first two deciles of the income distribution who has a health professional
15:555:54015:18:18:62:549:558:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:in the family is up to 8 percentage points less likely to have been prenatally exposed to tobacco than a child
15:556:54125:18:18:62:549:540:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:who has no medical professionals in the family. As Panel4D and Panel D in Table1 document, the gap in
15:557:54226:18:18:62:549:522:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:tobacco exposure rates monotonically declines with income rank and gets close to a precise zero at the top of the
15:558:54339:18:18:62:549:504:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:income distribution. While a substantial portion of the differences can be attributed to differences in observable
15:559:54453:18:18:62:549:486:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:demographics, observables do not account for the full gap, leaving a significant discrepancy of up to nearly 5
15:560:54563:18:18:62:549:468:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:percentage points (or 14%) at the lower end of the income distribution (Panel D in Table1). Further, observable
15:561:54674:18:18:62:532:450:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:differences cannot fully explain the pattern of a monotonically increasing gap with declining a income rank.
15:562:54782:18:18:77:549:432:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Figures5 and 6 examine the heterogeneity in our non-parametric results along the intensive margin of exposure
15:563:54891:18:18:62:549:414:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:to a health professional in the family. We examine two dimensions of heterogeneity: geographic proximity, and
15:564:55000:18:18:62:549:396:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:proximity along the family tree. The left-hand side panels in Figures5 and 6 report the estimated differences in
15:565:55112:18:17:62:549:378:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:health outcomes between: (i) individuals with a health professional in their broad (but not narrow) family and
15:566:55222:17:18:62:549:361:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:those individuals without any health professional relative (dashed lines); as well as (ii) between individuals with a
15:567:55339:18:18:62:549:343:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:health professional in their narrow family and those without any health professional (solid line). The differences
15:568:55453:18:18:62:549:325:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:in health outcome at each point in the income rank distribution are reported from the OLS regressions with the
15:569:55563:18:18:62:549:307:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:full set of controls as in PanelsB,  D of Figure3, as well as the respective Panels in Figure4). The right-hand
15:570:55674:18:18:62:549:289:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:side panels report the same analysis, but now splitting the sample by geographically close (solid line) and far
15:571:55785:18:18:62:549:271:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:(dashed line) health professional relatives. We define two family members as being geographically close if they
15:572:55896:18:18:62:541:253:10:g_d0_f2:7:g_d0_f4:B:have lived in the same county for more than 50% of the time during which they are observed in the sample.32
15:573:56003:18:18:77:549:235:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:We consistently find - for both older and younger relatives - that the effects of a health professional in
15:574:56109:18:18:62:549:217:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the family are substantially more pronounced if the health professional is a close relative. The differences are
15:575:56221:18:18:62:549:199:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:especially clear when zooming in onto the lower part of the income distribution. For example, at lower income
15:576:56330:18:18:62:549:181:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:rungs, having a health professional relative who is farther away along the family tree has very little effect on the
15:577:56446:18:18:62:549:163:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:prevalence of lifestyle-related conditions after age 55 (PanelC), while the effect is very pronounced for having a
15:578:56560:18:18:62:549:145:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:close relative who is a health professional. These results are intuitive, as we would expect the communication
15:579:56670:18:14:62:549:127:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:about health to be both more frequent and more open among closer family members.  The results are more
15:580:56772:14:13:69:549:113:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:31Notably, we find even larger differences when we consider only (children of) expecting mothers that are healthcare professionals
15:581:56902:13:9:62:549:100:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:themselves. There is almostno gradientin the probability of tobacco exposurein uteroamong children of these mothers, with a
15:582:57025:9:10:62:549:91:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:level difference of up to minus 20 percentage points relative to the general population. FigureA2 in the Appendix illustrates this
15:583:57155:10:9:62:76:81:8:g_d0_f6:6:g_d0_f5:F:striking difference.32
15:584:57177:9:9:77:549:72:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:County (“län”) is the top level geographic division in Sweden, with 21 counties as of 2019. The largest county (Stockholm) has
15:585:57303:9:0:62:372:63:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:2.3 million individuals, while the smallest (Gotland) has about 59 thousand people.
16:586:57388:0:18:62:549:719:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:mixed for geographic proximity.  We observe in FigureB that the mortality effect at the lower rungs of the
16:587:57494:18:18:62:549:701:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:income distribution is almost entirely driven by geographically close relatives, while the effects are similar at
16:588:57607:18:18:62:549:683:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:higher income rungs. For lifestyle-related diseases, there is almost no difference in the effects of having a health
16:589:57723:18:18:62:549:665:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:professional relative who lives far or nearby. For young children, the family tree and geographic proximity are
16:590:57834:18:17:62:549:647:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:often hard to separate, as children are likely to live in the same household as a close relative. In both cases,
16:591:57946:17:18:62:549:630:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:however, we find that HPV vaccination is more pronounced among young adults exposed to a health professional
16:592:58054:18:18:62:549:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:who is either a close family member or lives close by. For tobacco exposure, there is little difference on either
16:593:58167:18:18:62:549:594:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:of the intensive margins at the top of the income distribution, while the intensity of exposure appears more
16:594:58275:18:18:62:549:576:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:important at the bottom of the income distribution. These results suggest that intensity of access to expertise is
16:595:58389:18:18:62:549:558:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:crucial for health production. Frequent communication with close family members generates consistent two-way
16:596:58497:18:18:62:549:540:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:information flows that are typically not present and not emphasized in the interactions within a formal healthcare
16:597:58611:18:18:62:94:522:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:system.
16:598:58618:18:18:77:549:504:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:While we control flexibly for a wide range of individual characteristics in this analysis, akin to the identification
16:599:58735:18:18:62:549:486:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:strategies pursued byBronnenberg et al.(2015) andJohnson and Rehavi(2016), a remaining concern is that
16:600:58837:18:18:62:549:468:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the presence of an HP in the family may be correlated withunobservables. We therefore use two additional
16:601:58941:18:18:62:549:450:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:identification strategies to quantify the causal impact on health and longevity of having a health professional in
16:602:59055:18:35:62:151:432:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the extended family.

16:604:59133:24:18:62:549:373:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:Our second research design exploits the fact that admission to medical school in Sweden, for a subset of years,
16:605:59244:18:18:62:549:355:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:contained an element of randomization.33“Medical school” in the Swedish context refers to an undergraduate
16:606:59350:18:18:62:549:337:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:major in medicine - medical training starts directly in college and not in a post-graduate professional school.
16:607:59461:18:18:62:549:319:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:Students choose their undergraduate majors before starting higher education, apply to specific departments, and
16:608:59572:18:18:62:297:301:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:follow a curriculum recommended by the department.
16:609:59622:18:18:77:549:283:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f3:A:University applications in Sweden are centralized and handled by a governmental agency,Universitets- och
16:610:59726:18:18:62:549:265:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:B:högskolerådet(henceforth UHR). All prospective students interested in studying for all degrees and at all uni-
16:611:59836:18:17:62:549:247:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:versities apply through the same system. There are two university application cycles per year, for programs
16:612:59943:17:18:62:549:230:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:starting in the fall and spring semesters, respectively. In each application cycle, a prospective student submits a
16:613:60058:18:18:62:549:212:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:rank ordered list of programs to the UHR. The applicant is not required to apply to programs only in the same
16:614:60167:18:18:62:549:194:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:discipline. For example, an applicant may rank the medical school program at the Karolinska Institute in Stock-
16:615:60278:18:18:62:549:176:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:holm as her first alternative, the medical school program at Gothenburg University as her second alternative, a
16:616:60389:18:18:62:391:158:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:program in business at Lund University as her third alternative, and so on.
16:617:60464:18:18:77:549:140:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:The centralized agency allocates the bulk of the applicants to programs by ranking them by their high-school
16:618:60572:18:15:62:550:122:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:GPA.34The applicant with the highest GPA gets her preferred choice, the second highest ranked applicant gets
16:619:60680:15:12:69:549:107:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:33There are no tuition fees for post-secondary education in Sweden. To cover living expenses, most students are eligible for financial
16:620:60814:12:7:62:373:95:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:support (part loan/part grant) from The Swedish Board of Student Finance (CSN).
16:621:60893:7:12:69:549:88:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:34There are also other quotas allocating applicants. The most important of these alternative quotas is the one allocating applicants
16:622:61025:12:9:62:549:76:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:to slots based on their scores on the Swedish Scholastic Aptitude Test (SSAT, in Swedishhögskoleprovet). In addition, five years of
16:623:61156:9:0:62:270:67:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:work experience can add some extra points to the GPA.
17:624:61211:0:18:62:549:719:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the highest available choice for which she qualifies, and so on. For competitive programs, in which demand exceeds
17:625:61325:18:18:62:549:701:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:supply, this process generates GPA admission cutoffs for each program, around which admission is effectively
17:626:61433:18:18:62:115:683:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:randomized.
17:627:61444:18:18:77:549:665:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:The high school GPA ranges from 0.0 to 20.0. Since the inception of this grading system in 1997, grade
17:628:61546:18:17:62:549:647:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:inflation has been substantial (see, e.g.,Diamond and Persson,2016). The share of students graduating from
17:629:61652:17:18:62:549:630:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:high school with a GPA of 20.0 increased from less than 0.1 percent in 1997 to 0.8 percent in 2008 (Vlachos,2010)
17:630:61765:18:18:62:549:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:– an increase of more than 800 percent. As a consequence, many university programs saw their GPA admission
17:631:61871:18:18:62:549:594:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:cutoffs steadily increase over time. For medical school programs, which generally have the highest cutoffs of any
17:632:61984:18:18:62:549:576:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:programs in Sweden, this process eventually led to the cutoff hitting the 20.0 mark at all of Sweden’s medical
17:633:62094:18:18:62:95:558:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:schools.
17:634:62102:18:18:77:549:540:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Figure7 displays the maximum, minimum, and median GPA cutoffs for admissions to Sweden’s six medical
17:635:62202:18:18:62:549:522:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:schools from 1998 to 2017.35Prior to the fall 2002 application cycle, the admission cutoffs were gradually
17:636:62308:18:18:62:549:504:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:increasing over time, with slightly higher cutoffs in the fall than in the spring (reflecting the fact that more
17:637:62420:18:18:62:549:486:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:students apply right after graduating high school in the preceding summer). Starting in the fall of 2002 and
17:638:62528:18:18:62:549:468:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:during the subsequent fifteen application cycles (until the spring of 2010), both the highest and the lowest cutoffs
17:639:62644:18:18:62:549:450:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:were 20.0. Thus, admission to any medical school in the country necessitated the highest possible GPA of 20.0,
17:640:62754:18:18:62:549:432:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:and the admission wasrandomizedby the UHR within this group. Our primary identification strategy leverages
17:641:62860:18:18:62:549:414:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:this randomization, by comparing applicants to medial school with a GPA of 20.0 who were admitted and not
17:642:62965:18:18:62:191:396:10:g_d0_f2:7:g_d0_f4:B:admitted to medical school.36
17:643:62994:18:17:77:549:378:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:While the randomization of students with 20.0 into admission resembles a perfect RCT, one aspect of the
17:644:63097:17:18:62:549:361:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:institutional context complicate our analysis. Applicants who are not admitted on their first attempt, have the

17:646:63323:18:18:62:549:325:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:that are not admitted in a particular cycle may still eventually gain admission and become physicians; thus, even
17:647:63436:18:18:62:549:307:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:conditional on a GPA of 20.0, being lotteried in or out is not a “sharp” allocation of students to medical schools.
17:648:63551:18:18:62:549:289:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:At the same time, not all students who are declined admission in their first application round choose to reapply.
17:649:63664:18:18:62:549:271:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:Instead, they may choose to pursue other professions. Thus, being admitted on the applicant’s first application
17:650:63775:18:18:62:549:253:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:cycle (which is effectively random) affects the probability of the applicants eventually matriculating into a medical
17:651:63892:18:18:62:101:235:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:program.
17:652:63900:18:18:77:549:217:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Given this, we exploit admission on the student’sfirstapplication attempt an instrument for whether an

17:654:64108:18:18:62:549:181:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:by estimating the following two stage least squares (2SLS) relationship (and the associated intent to treat (ITT)

17:657:64264:14:12:69:549:131:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:35Sweden has six medical schools during the time period for which we observe admissions data, with a seventh added in 2010 (in
17:658:64390:12:10:62:549:119:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:Örebro). In the years when not all schools’ cutoffs are 20.0, the highest admission cutoff is typically to the Karolinska Institute in
17:659:64524:10:9:62:76:109:8:g_d0_f6:6:g_d0_f5:F:Stockholm or to Lund University.36
17:660:64558:9:10:77:549:100:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:Randomization is not common, but is present in multiple higher education settings across different countries. SeeKetel et al.

18:682:66769:18:18:62:549:405:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:medical school because they won admission in their first application cycle, but who would not have matriculated
18:683:66880:18:18:62:516:387:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:in a medical school had they lost this first lottery. The standard errors are clustered at the family level.
18:684:66988:18:17:77:549:369:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:We observe ten years of complete application and admissions records, starting in the fall of 2007 and ending
18:685:67096:17:18:62:549:352:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:in the Spring of 2016. Our baseline sample of applicants includes all applicants to medical school in Sweden
18:686:67204:18:18:62:549:334:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:up until the spring of 2010 (when the cutoff score was 20.0), who had a GPA of exactly 20.0. Our sample of
18:687:67310:18:18:62:549:316:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:family members include all their grandparents, parents, parents-in-law, spouses, own children, aunts and uncles,
18:688:67422:18:18:62:233:298:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:siblings, siblings’ children, and cousins.
18:689:67464:18:18:77:549:280:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Table 2 displays the mean of observable baseline demographics as well the probability of matriculating into
18:690:67571:18:18:62:549:262:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:medical studies for two groups of applicants: those who were admitted (188 applicants) and those who were
18:691:67676:18:18:62:549:244:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:not admitted (555 applicants) in their first application cycle. First, we see a large difference in matriculation
18:692:67789:18:18:62:549:226:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:into medical school. Among applicants admitted in the first application cycle, 96% matriculated into a medical
18:693:67899:18:18:62:549:208:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:program. Among those who were not admitted in their first cycle (but could re-apply), the corresponding figure
18:694:68009:18:18:62:549:190:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:is 59%, giving us a large and precise first stage of 37 percentage point difference in the matriculation probability.
18:695:68126:18:18:77:549:172:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:The accepted and rejected students were equally likely to be women (57 percent in the accepted group) and
18:696:68231:18:18:62:549:154:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:had an equal number of siblings (1.82 in the accepted group). They had similar ages, although the accepted group
18:697:68343:18:18:62:549:136:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:is statistically (but not economically) significantly older (19.67 in the accepted group vs. 19.48 in the rejected
18:698:68457:18:15:62:549:118:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:group).38Accepted and rejected applicants were equally likely to be born in Sweden (97 percent in the accepted
18:699:68567:15:12:69:549:103:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:38The difference in age stems from the institutional nuances of the admission system – applicants can strengthen their applications
18:700:68698:12:10:62:549:91:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:by gaining five years of work experience; so, if there is a big time gap between the first and subsequent applications for some applicants
18:701:68836:10:9:62:549:81:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:who chose this route for their applications, we may in a small number of cases mis-classify the first application cycle and capture
18:702:68967:9:10:62:549:72:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:individuals who gained work experience before re-applying. The differences in age shrinks substantially when we zoom in into small
18:703:69097:10:0:62:549:62:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:subsamples, where we can more conservatively define the first application cycle and focus on high school graduates from the same
19:704:69227:0:18:62:549:719:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:group), and to have parents that were born in Sweden (87 percent of fathers and 86 percent of mothers born in
19:705:69336:18:18:62:549:701:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:Sweden for the accepted group). Both groups had similar parental household income and father’s income, both
19:706:69443:18:18:62:549:683:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:measured before the applicant’s high school graduation and before the first medical school application cycle. A

19:708:69665:18:17:62:549:647:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:first application to medical school in the admitted and non-admitted groups (in the admitted group, 1 percent
19:709:69774:17:18:62:549:630:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:of fathers, 1 percent of mothers, 57 (48) percent of paternal (maternal) grandfathers, and 32 (30) percent of
19:710:69883:18:18:62:429:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:paternal (maternal) grandmothers were deceased prior to the student’s application).
19:711:69966:18:18:77:549:594:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:In sum, 15 out of 16 observables are balanced across the admitted and non-admitted groups, and the t-test
19:712:70071:18:18:62:550:576:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:comparisons are far from any conventional significance levels with the lowest p-value of0.33(for whether the
19:713:70179:18:18:62:550:558:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:father was born in Sweden) for all observables except age. We conclude that the evidence in Table2 is consistent
19:714:70291:18:18:62:549:540:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:with an essentially random breaking of ties in medical school admission decisions for this group of highest GPA
19:715:70402:18:18:62:549:522:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:students. We thus proceed to use the first application cycle admission decision as an instrument for whether an
19:716:70513:18:18:62:252:504:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:individual matriculates into medical school.
19:717:70557:18:18:77:549:486:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:We report results (ITT and LATE estimates) separately for older and younger relatives of the health profes-

19:720:70844:18:18:62:549:418:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:education on the health outcomes of relatives aged 50 and above. For each relative, we track health outcomes
19:721:70952:18:18:62:549:400:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:starting in yeart+ 1after matriculation and untilt+ 8, which is the maximum time horizon that we observe in
19:722:71059:18:17:62:549:382:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:our sample. This time horizon captures the period of medical education, which typically lasts for 6 years, and
19:723:71169:17:18:62:284:365:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the first two years after medical school completion.
19:724:71221:18:18:77:549:347:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:For older relatives, we consider two sets of outcomes: (i) outcomes that capture preventive investments, and
19:725:71329:18:18:62:549:329:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:(ii) outcomes that capture physical health, in particular the life-style related conditions analyzed above. For
19:726:71440:18:18:62:549:311:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:preventive investments we focus on those that are likely to reduce the risk of life-style related conditions, and
19:727:71553:18:18:62:549:293:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:those that can be measured precisely in our data. In a final step, we aggregate all the specific outcomes into a
19:728:71665:18:18:62:466:275:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:single health index. All outcomes are scaled in per 1,000 individuals to aid in interpretation.
19:729:71760:18:18:77:549:257:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:A:Preventive investmentsWe consider eight measures of preventive investments that can be observed in our
19:730:71862:18:18:62:549:239:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:data: adherence to three types of drugs that reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease; adherence to diabetes
19:731:71971:18:18:62:549:221:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:drugs; take-up of Vitamin D (among women, for whom this vitamin is recommended in old age); adherence to
19:732:72075:18:18:62:549:203:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:asthma medication; the occurrence of preventable hospitalizations, and addiction to alcohol or drug substances.
19:733:72186:18:18:77:549:185:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Columns (1), (2), and (3) report the intent to treat (ITT) effects (with and without controls), and the local
19:734:72295:18:18:62:549:167:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:average treatment effect (LATE), respectively. In columns (4) and (5) we report two different benchmarks that
19:735:72404:18:18:62:549:149:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:are useful for interpreting the ITT and LATE coefficients. Column (4) reports a simple mean among family
19:736:72508:18:18:62:549:131:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:members of applicants who loose the lottery on their first application attempt. In column (5) we report the
19:737:72615:18:17:62:549:113:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:complier mean among control compliers. Within our control group, we observe individuals that decide not to
19:738:72721:17:18:62:549:96:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:attempt another medical school application when they loose the lottery. Conceptually, this group of individuals
19:739:72832:18:9:62:550:78:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:year – the sample of these individuals, however, is too small to perform our analysis. Hence, we keep the sample in Table2, and
19:740:72959:9:0:62:307:69:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:control for the year of birth non-parametrically in our regressions.
20:741:73029:0:18:62:549:719:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:includes (untreated) compliers and never takers. From2, we see that only 4% of individuals that win the lottery
20:742:73140:18:18:62:549:701:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:do not matriculate into a medical school, so the share of never-takers in our data is extremely low. In that
20:743:73248:18:18:62:549:683:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:case, family members of individuals who loose the lottery and do not re-apply, are predominantly compliers.
20:744:73355:18:18:62:549:665:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:Computing the mean of outcomes among the family members of these individuals allows us to directly estimate
20:745:73462:18:17:62:522:647:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the mean of potential outcomes under no treatment for compliers. This is what we report in Column (5).
20:746:73564:17:18:77:549:630:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:We first study effects on adherence to chronic medication.  We measure adherence as the probability of

20:750:73994:18:18:62:549:558:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:conditions). Individuals in the treatment group, i.e., relatives of individuals who win the medical school lottery
20:751:74108:18:18:62:549:540:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:in their first application attempt, are substantially more likely to adhere to these medications. The effects are
20:752:74221:18:18:62:549:522:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:economically large for all three outcomes, and statistically precise for statins and blood thinners. For example,
20:753:74334:18:18:62:549:504:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:on average 247 out of 1,000 individuals in the control group purchase blood thinners, while in the treatment
20:754:74442:18:18:62:549:486:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:group it is 31 more people per 1,000 - a 13% increase (ITT). The effect of having a relative matriculate into
20:755:74551:18:18:62:549:468:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:medical school (on the compliers) is in turn larger, with 69 more people taking the blood thinning medication,
20:756:74661:18:18:62:549:450:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:which represents a 25% increase off of the control complier mean (LATE). The relative increases are qualitatively
20:757:74774:18:18:62:549:432:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:similar for the other two cardiovascular drugs: 27% and 9% increases in adherence to statins and beta blockers,
20:758:74885:18:18:62:549:414:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:respectively (LATE). Further, older family members of lottery winners are 20% (ITT) more likely to adhere to
20:759:74993:18:18:62:549:396:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:diabetes medication conditional on having the disease. Female older relatives also take prescription strength
20:760:75102:18:17:62:549:378:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:(rather than over-the-counter) vitamin D (vitamin D deficiency is common with aging, especially among women)
20:761:75210:17:18:62:549:361:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:at higher rates: 32 out of 1,000 women in the conditional complier mean take the vitamin, while 41 per 1,000
20:762:75318:18:18:62:549:343:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:more do among treatment compliers (LATE). We find positive but noisy differences in adherence to asthma
20:763:75421:18:18:62:549:325:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:medication. We find no systematic evidence of a decline in what we measure as preventable hospitalizations for
20:764:75531:18:18:62:549:307:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:older adults, but find some evidence of a decreased probability of addiction-related diagnoses in medical data,
20:765:75642:18:18:62:304:289:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:which captures addiction to alcohol or drug substances.
20:766:75697:18:18:77:549:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:A:Physical healthWe next turn to the analysis of the effect on physical health, in particular conditions that
20:767:75804:18:18:62:549:253:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:commonly are considered to be linked to lifestyle decisions. We find that 42 out of 1,000 individuals in the control
20:768:75920:18:18:62:549:235:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:group have a heart attack during our observation period. Among individuals whose relative wins the medical
20:769:76026:18:18:62:549:217:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:school lottery, the rate declines by 18 out of 1,000 people - a remarkable decrease of 44% (ITT). Exposure to
20:770:76135:18:18:62:549:199:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:a health professional among compliers leaves this group with only 14 per 1,000 individuals with a heart attack.
20:771:76246:18:18:62:549:181:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:Importantly, as we are measuring the effects over a relatively short time frame, we cannot ascertain whether this
20:772:76359:18:18:62:549:163:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:decline is permanent or represents a short-run delay of this acute cardiovascular event.40We find similarly large
20:773:76472:18:14:62:549:145:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:effects on the probability of being diagnosed with heart failure: a decline of 27 per 1,000 individuals (ITT), or
20:774:76585:14:12:69:549:131:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:39In addition to the controls discussed above, the subset of regressions where the outcome captures individuals’ drug purchases
20:775:76712:12:10:62:549:119:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:also includes controls for the presence of asthma, type II diabetes, heart failure, ischemic heart diseases, stroke, hyperlipidemia, or
20:776:76847:10:9:62:76:109:8:g_d0_f6:6:g_d0_f5:F:hypertension.40
20:777:76862:9:10:77:549:100:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:In general, our estimates are not inconsistent with the results of related clinical trials; however, the direct comparison is hard
20:778:76992:10:9:62:549:90:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:to achieve for two key reasons: first, our timeline is actually long for the world of clinical trials, hence only few trials have been run
20:779:77130:9:10:62:549:81:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:over a comparable time period; second, nearly all large-scale clinical trials test the effect of one medication at a time, so that the
20:780:77264:10:9:62:549:71:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:composite effect of higher exposure to several cardiovascular medications at a time - which we are clearly observing in the data - is
20:781:77397:9:0:62:98:62:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:unknown.
21:782:77407:0:18:62:549:719:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:51 per 1,000 among compliers (LATE), off of the mean of 74 per 1,000 cases in the control group and 101 among
21:783:77516:18:18:62:484:701:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:control compliers. We do not find any evidence of a reduction of type II diabetes or lung cancer.
21:784:77613:18:18:77:549:683:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:To address the issue of inference with multiple outcomes and to improve statistical power, we aggregate all
21:785:77720:18:18:62:549:665:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:eleven measures into a “health index,” following the approach in Kling et al.(2007). We first orient all outcomes
21:786:77833:18:17:62:549:647:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:in the same qualitative direction (for example, for statins more is “good,” while for addiction less is “good”). We
21:787:77948:17:18:62:549:630:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:then construct a z-score for each outcome (subtracting the control group mean and dividing by the control group
21:788:78059:18:18:62:549:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:standard deviation) and take an unweighted average across all outcomes.41The result suggests that, among older
21:789:78169:18:18:62:549:594:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:adults, exposure to a family member who matriculates into medical school yields a large and statistically precise
21:790:78282:18:18:62:163:576:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:improvement in health.
21:791:78304:18:18:77:549:558:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:In the analysis of medical school lotteries, we are restricted to examining a shorter time horizon and have a
21:792:78413:18:18:62:549:540:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:limited sample, which likely accounts for the imprecise estimates for some conditions. At the same time, focusing
21:793:78526:18:18:62:549:522:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:on the shorter time horizon has the advantage of shedding light on the potential mechanisms at play in our
21:794:78632:18:18:62:549:504:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:findings. Since we mostly observe family members exposed to physicians in the family during their training and
21:795:78742:18:18:62:549:486:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:early on in their career, we can with high certainty exclude the possibility that the “access to care” channel is
21:796:78855:18:18:62:549:468:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:an important driver of these results. While in training, future physicians are exposed to a lot of information,
21:797:78966:18:18:62:549:450:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:but they cannot directly write drug prescriptions and are unlikely to have strong professional networks to enable
21:798:79079:18:18:62:549:432:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:them to help their family members “jump lines.” We return to the long-run analysis of the prevalence of chronic
21:799:79190:18:18:62:549:414:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:conditions and mortality in Section4.4, where we use a different empirical strategy to examine these important
21:800:79300:18:18:62:105:396:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:outcomes.
21:801:79309:18:17:77:549:378:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Overall, the point estimates in our analysis are consistent with the idea that older relatives of a physician are
21:802:79422:17:18:62:549:361:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:in better health and that they undertake more - cheap and simple - investments into their health, than similar
21:803:79532:18:32:62:539:343:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:individuals in families without a physician in training, and hence without informal access to health expertise.

21:805:79748:18:18:62:549:293:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:outcomes of younger relatives.42We measure health outcomes starting in yeart+1after matriculation and until
21:806:79855:18:18:62:549:275:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:yeart+ 6.43We consider eight outcomes that are either preventive investments or health outcomes that are
21:807:79959:18:18:62:549:257:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:plausibly amenable to health expertise: HPV vaccination, not using hormonal contraceptives, having substance
21:808:80067:18:18:62:549:239:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:addiction, experiencing injury or poisoning that require a hospitalization, the number of inpatient stays, and
21:809:80177:18:18:62:438:221:10:g_d0_f2:7:g_d0_f4:B:occurrence of respiratory infections, intestinal infections, and chronic tonsil diseases.44
21:810:80268:18:18:77:549:203:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Columns (1), (2), and (3) again report intent to treat (ITT) effects without and with covariates, and the local
21:811:80379:18:15:62:549:185:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:average treatment effect (LATE), respectively. Among female relatives aged 10 to 25, we estimate a large and
21:812:80487:15:12:69:549:170:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:41The index is on average equal to zero in the control group, by construction, since we are normalizing the z-score to the control
21:813:80617:12:7:62:108:158:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:group mean.
21:814:80628:7:9:69:455:151:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:A:42Recall that these include the health professional’s siblings, cousins, own children, or siblings’ children.
21:815:80737:9:13:69:549:142:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:43We take a shorter time window for younger relatives. There are fewer younger than older relatives in the sample, while they
21:816:80862:13:9:62:549:129:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:experience adverse health events much less frequently. A shorter follow-up window allows us to increase the sample size, and unlike
21:817:80993:9:10:62:549:120:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:for the chronic conditions of the older relatives, for the conditions of the younger relatives, we would expect the effects to appear
21:818:81126:10:9:62:76:110:8:g_d0_f6:6:g_d0_f5:F:faster.44
21:819:81135:9:10:77:549:101:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:We considernotusing hormonal contraceptives as a positive health investment, since we find overwhelming evidence of physicians
21:820:81261:10:9:62:549:91:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:themselves substituting away from hormonal birth control.  Concerns about the side effects of these medicines that have been
21:821:81385:9:10:62:549:82:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:documented in the clinical literature may drive this observation, although we cannot pin down the exact underlying mechanism with
21:822:81514:10:0:62:96:72:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:certainty.
22:823:81526:0:18:62:549:719:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:positive effect on take-up of the HPV vaccine. While 119 out of 1,000 individuals are vaccinated in the control
22:824:81637:18:18:62:549:701:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:group (174 among compliers), our estimates imply increases of 62 per 1,000 (ITT) and 202 per 1,000 (LATE) – an
22:825:81747:18:18:62:549:683:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:increase of more than 200% among compliers.45We estimate similarly large effects for the avoidance of hormonal
22:826:81857:18:18:62:549:665:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:contraception. While 655 out of 1,000 young women aged between 10 to 20 do not use hormonal contraception
22:827:81962:18:17:62:549:647:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:in the control group, 132 women (20% more) refrain from this form of contraception among those with a lottery
22:828:82071:17:18:62:372:630:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:winner (in the first application attempt) in the extended family (ITT).
22:829:82142:18:18:77:549:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:We further find large effects of being exposed to a health professional in the family on the probability of
22:830:82249:18:18:62:549:594:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:having an injury or poisoning that warrants a visit to a hospital (in inpatient or outpatient specialist care). The
22:831:82364:18:18:62:549:576:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:rate of substance addiction that warrants a visit to a hospital or specialist care among young individuals in the
22:832:82477:18:18:62:549:558:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:control group is 19 per 1,000; the corresponding number in the treatment group is significantly lower at 7 per
22:833:82587:18:18:62:198:540:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:1,000 - a decline of 63% (ITT).
22:834:82618:18:18:77:549:522:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Our estimates for inpatient stays paint a similar picture. We find that younger relatives of those who win
22:835:82724:18:18:62:549:504:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the lottery have a third of the number of inpatient stay days. We do not capture any differences in the rates
22:836:82833:18:18:62:549:486:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:of severe injuries or poisoning (which are experienced by about a quarter of individuals in the sample), and we
22:837:82944:18:18:62:549:468:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:also do not find that being exposed to a health professional lowers the rates of respiratory infections, intestinal
22:838:83059:18:18:62:199:450:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:infections, or chronic tonsillitis.
22:839:83094:18:18:77:549:432:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Overall, we conclude that for younger generations, having a new doctor-in-training in the family appears
22:840:83198:18:18:62:549:414:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:to have positive effects on health: We see lower prevalence of addiction, fewer inpatient days, and a larger
22:841:83306:18:18:62:549:396:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:probability of preventive investments. Finally, we summarize our eight measures into a health index, constructed
22:842:83418:18:17:62:549:378:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:in the same way as for the older family members. The estimate suggests that, among younger family members,
22:843:83524:17:35:62:549:361:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:informal exposure to a health professional yields economically and statistically significant improvements in health.

22:845:83704:25:18:62:549:301:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:While the Swedish medical school lotteries resemble an RCT and thus represent a near-ideal setting to examine
22:846:83813:18:18:62:549:283:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:causal effects, the short follow-up period precludes us from studying the long-run impact of exposure to expertise
22:847:83927:18:18:62:549:265:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:on older adults. We therefore complement this research design with event studies that exploit the timing of the
22:848:84038:18:17:62:549:247:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:arrival of a health professional in the family. Consistent with the analysis in Section4.3, we define the event
22:849:84149:17:18:62:549:230:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:of a family member matriculating into medical school as the start of exposure to expertise.46Which families
22:850:84256:18:18:62:549:212:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:experience this event is not random. However, we can still assess whether having a doctor in the family impacts

22:852:84479:18:18:62:386:176:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:this event relative to the trends in health in (similar) families that do not.
22:853:84557:18:18:77:549:158:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:In particular, we compare the families of individuals trained as medical doctors to the families of individuals
22:854:84668:18:18:62:549:140:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:trained as lawyers. Both types of families have similar socio-economic status, with income distributions that are
22:855:84781:18:18:62:549:122:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:skewed towards the top ventiles (although family members are present at all points in the income distribution).
22:856:84892:18:15:62:503:104:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:Moreover, admittance into law school – a similarly prestigeous education – also requires a high GPA.
22:857:84992:15:12:69:549:89:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:45Interestingly, even in the families of compliers, we still only estimate an about 40% take up of this routinely recommended
22:858:85117:12:7:62:91:77:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:vaccine.
22:859:85125:7:0:69:540:70:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:A:46We do not require that the medical profession is pursued after college, though in practice the vast majority pursue medicine.
23:860:85254:0:18:77:549:719:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:We need two key identifying assumptions that appear plausible in our context. First, we require that access
23:861:85361:18:18:62:549:701:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:to health expertise arrives to families after an individual starts medical training. Second, for our results to be
23:862:85475:18:18:62:549:683:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:consistent with a causal interpretation, we need to assume that individuals do not decide to undertake medical
23:863:85585:18:18:62:549:665:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:training based on thetrendin the health of their extended family members. These assumptions appear plausible
23:864:85693:18:17:62:549:647:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:given the long timeline that typically accompanies the decision to pursue a medical degree and the slow process
23:865:85804:17:18:62:199:630:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:of chronic disease development.
23:866:85835:18:18:77:549:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Before turning to a formal regression specification, we investigate whether the assumptions we require for
23:867:85941:18:18:62:550:594:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:identification, as well as the hypothesized effects, are supported by the raw data.  Figure8 documents raw
23:868:86047:18:18:62:549:576:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:differences in the probability of adverse health outcomes between individuals with a child who received a medical
23:869:86160:18:18:62:549:558:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:degree versus a law degree. In Panel8A, we plot mortality. In particular, we take the five cohorts of individuals
23:870:86273:18:18:62:549:540:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:born in Sweden between 1936 to 1940, and select individuals who have at least one child with a medical or law
23:871:86382:18:18:62:549:522:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:degree. We exclude individuals who are health professionals themselves (either a doctor or a nurse) or who have
23:872:86493:18:18:62:549:504:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:a health professional spouse.47In this sample, we compute the share of individuals that died by each calendar
23:873:86602:18:18:62:549:486:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:year starting with year 1980 (i.e. starting when the individuals are aged 40 to 45). We keep individuals in the
23:874:86713:18:18:62:550:468:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:sample even if they die, so the figure records cumulative mortality. Panel8B confirms that individuals in our two
23:875:86826:18:18:62:549:450:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:samples have identical average age. (This is what we would expect absent any dramatic–and unlikely–differences
23:876:86936:18:18:62:549:432:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:in the probability of having a lawyer or a doctor child across the 1936 to 1940 cohorts.) In earlier years, mortality
23:877:87053:18:18:62:549:414:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:rates are visually identical between the two groups. Around 1995 (ages 55 to 60), however, a diversion emerges
23:878:87163:18:18:62:549:396:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:between the mortality trends of lawyer-parents (hollow circles) and doctor-parents (filled triangles). Throughout
23:879:87276:18:17:62:549:378:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:years 1997 to 2017, parents of doctors are dying at a slower rate than parents of lawyers. The difference becomes
23:880:87389:17:18:62:549:361:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:economically and statistically significant over time, converging to a difference of 243 per 1,000 individuals having
23:881:87505:18:18:62:549:343:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:died among lawyers’ parents by 2017, as compared to 208 per 1,000 individuals among doctors’ parents. The
23:882:87610:18:18:62:450:325:10:g_d0_f2:7:g_d0_f4:B:difference of 35 per 1,000 lives (or 14%) is statistically significant at less than 1% level.48
23:883:87705:18:18:77:549:307:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:In Panels8C to 8F, we repeat a similar exercise for our set of four chronic, lifestyle-related conditions: heart
23:884:87817:18:18:62:549:289:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:attacks, heart failure, type II diabetes, and lung cancer. As our medical claims data starts much later than our
23:885:87929:18:18:62:549:271:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:mortality data, we track individuals starting in year 1997 (up until 2016). To be able to observe individuals
23:886:88038:18:18:62:549:253:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:prior to older age when the onset of conditions is already likely to have had started (and to increase precision),
23:887:88152:18:18:62:549:235:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:we increase the sample size by pooling the cohorts from 1936 to 1961. This cohort choice implies that we track
23:888:88262:18:18:62:549:217:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:individuals’ chronic diagnoses from the age of 36 to 81.  We observe remarkably similar patterns across all
23:889:88369:18:18:62:549:199:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:of these conditions. As with mortality, in the early years of our data, the prevalence of chronic conditions is
23:890:88480:18:18:62:549:181:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:indistinguishable among individuals with a lawyer and a doctor child. Eventually, significant differences emerge,
23:891:88593:18:18:62:549:163:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:however, with parents of doctors having a persistently lower prevalence of all four chronic conditions. By the
23:892:88703:18:18:62:549:145:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:end of our sample period, in 2016, parents of doctors will have had 3 per 1,000 fewer heart attacks (7% fewer
23:893:88812:18:15:62:549:127:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:compared to the base of 42 heart attacks per 1,000 individuals in the lawyer-child sample); 4 per 1,000 fewer cases
23:894:88927:15:12:69:549:112:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:47For lawyer-parents we further exclude those who had a child that became a nurse, while for the physician-parents, we exclude
23:895:89053:12:7:62:365:100:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:those who had a child that became a nurse before another child became a doctor.
23:896:89132:7:12:69:549:93:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:48Note that in Sweden, it is extremely rare for individuals to reside with their children, even at a very old age; the social norm
23:897:89262:12:10:62:549:81:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:is that parents live alone and, if this is no longer possible, move into a long-term care facility (which is part of the municipal social
23:898:89399:10:0:62:355:71:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:insurance system). Thus, our results do not reflect an in-house caregiver effect.
24:899:89482:0:18:62:549:719:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:of heart failure (10% fewer relative to the base of 40 per 1,000 among lawyer-parents); 8 per 1,000 fewer cases of
24:900:89596:18:18:62:549:701:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:type II diabetes (11% fewer relative to 76 per 1,000 among lawyer-parents), and finally 2 per 1,000 fewer cases
24:901:89707:18:18:62:549:683:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:of lung cancer (18% fewer relative to the lawyer-parents baseline of 11 per 1,000 cases). All of these differences
24:902:89821:18:18:62:324:665:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:are again economically large and highly statistically precise.
24:903:89883:18:17:77:549:647:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:These sharp patterns in the raw data support our event study approach, as they suggest both that the
24:904:89983:17:18:62:549:630:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:deviation in the trend of chronic condition incidence and mortality happens long after individuals’ children
24:905:90091:18:18:62:549:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:are likely to decide to start their (undergraduate) degrees in law or medicine. Further, we observe non-trivial
24:906:90202:18:18:62:549:594:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:differences in the incidence of chronic conditions and mortality between these two groups of parents at older ages,
24:907:90317:18:18:62:464:576:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:despite their largely similar socio-economic standing (as illustrated in Appendix FigureA4).

24:940:92943:9:10:62:549:98:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:studies that examine mortality, we consider cohorts born in 1936 to 1940. In 17% of cases for doctor-relatives and 21% of cases for
24:941:93074:10:9:62:549:88:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:lawyer-relatives, we do not observe the exact year in which the relative acquired a medical or a legal degree. For these observations,
24:942:93208:9:10:62:549:79:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:we impute the age of matriculation as the year of high school graduation. In the analysis of chronic conditions, we observe the exact

25:945:93550:18:18:62:549:701:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:profession based on trends in familial health. Our estimates strongly support this assumption, which is consistent
25:946:93664:18:18:62:390:683:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:with our observations in the raw data on parental mortality and morbidity.

25:956:94688:18:18:62:549:504:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:observations in the raw data and our lottery-based results, we observe a significant divergence in health between
25:957:94801:18:18:62:549:486:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:relatives of doctors and lawyers that emerges around year 5 post college matriculation. The divergence widens
25:958:94910:18:18:62:482:468:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:for two decades post college matriculation, as can also be seen in Column 1, Panel B of Table5.
25:959:95005:18:18:77:549:450:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:We report separate event study results for the four chronic conditions underlying the lifestyle index in Ap-
25:960:95113:18:18:62:549:432:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:pendix TableA1, and graphically in Appendix FigureA5). We observe that differences emerge at around year 9
25:961:95219:18:18:62:549:414:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:post matriculation in the probability of having a heart attack and at around year 5 for congestive heart failure.
25:962:95332:18:18:62:549:396:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:The differences persist and expand over time. We observe a similar pronounced divergence in the incidence of
25:963:95440:18:17:62:549:378:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:type II diabetes and lung cancer. Fifteen years after matriculation, relatives of doctors are 1 percentage point
25:964:95552:17:18:62:549:361:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:(23 percent) less likely to have a diabetes diagnosis and 20 percent less likely to have lung cancer. These long-run
25:965:95668:18:18:62:549:343:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:patterns are consistent with the idea that responses to exposure to expertise include the formation of healthier
25:966:95780:18:18:62:549:325:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:behaviors and the adoption of new preventive measures, and that these long-run processes yield cumulative health
25:967:95892:18:18:62:235:307:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:benefits that grow important over time.
25:968:95931:18:18:77:549:289:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:As in the non-parametric analysis, we further examine the heterogeneity of our event study effects by income
25:969:96039:18:18:62:549:271:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:and proximity - both geographically and along the family tree. Columns (2) to (7) in TableA1 report the results.
25:970:96151:18:18:62:549:253:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:As in the non-parametric analysis, we find that individuals with income in the lower half of the distribution are
25:971:96264:18:18:62:549:235:10:g_d0_f2:7:g_d0_f4:B:more affected (we find 35% higher impact in the fist half of the income distribution) by exposure to expertise.51
25:972:96377:18:18:62:549:217:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:Further, family members that live closer to each other geographically benefit more, which is consistent with
25:973:96485:18:18:62:549:199:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the importance of rich and persistent information transmission between the family member and the health
25:974:96588:18:18:62:549:181:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:professional, playing a key role in our results. We do not find substantial differences in the impact on mortality
25:975:96702:18:18:62:549:163:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:along the family tie dimension, while the impact on chronic conditions is stronger among closer family members.
25:976:96813:18:18:77:549:145:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Overall, we conclude that having a relative with a medical education has positive and quantitatively significant
25:977:96925:18:14:62:549:127:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:health benefits. These effects are present both at the top and at the bottom of the income distribution. In families
25:978:97041:14:13:69:550:113:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:50The outcome is an indicator taking the value of 1 if the individual has died by timet, and the value zero otherwise (i.e., if the
25:979:97172:13:9:62:76:100:8:g_d0_f6:6:g_d0_f5:F:individual is still alive in timet. The outcome thus captures the timing of death.51
25:980:97256:9:10:77:549:91:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:To facilitate the heterogeneity analysis by income and geography, we switch our sample to younger cohorts - 1946 to 1955. While
25:981:97383:10:9:62:549:81:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:our mortality records go far back, the information on income and geography is available for a more recent time period only. The
25:982:97510:9:0:62:451:72:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:difference in samples accounts for the differences in relative and point estimates across the specifications.
26:983:97621:0:18:62:549:719:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:with a physician, older relatives live longer and are less likely to experience common chronic conditions such as
26:984:97734:18:18:62:549:701:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:diabetes or a heart failure. Our event study results on long-run outcomes are qualitatively and quantitatively
26:985:97844:18:18:62:549:683:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:in line with our non-parametric and (short-run) lottery-based analyses, despite the fact that the three analysis
26:986:97956:18:42:62:294:665:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:samples are different and cover different time frames.
26:987:98010:42:30:62:396:623:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:5  Exposure to expertise and health inequality
26:988:98056:30:25:62:164:593:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:5.1  Mechanisms
26:989:98071:25:18:62:549:568:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:So far we have used three strategies to estimate the same empirical object - how the presence of a health
26:990:98176:18:18:62:549:550:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:professional in the family affects the health of family members. Having a health professional in the family is
26:991:98286:18:17:62:549:532:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:likely to affect individuals though multiple channels. We have focused our analysis on a set of outcomes that we
26:992:98398:17:18:62:549:515:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:argue are amenable to expertise, but that are unlikely to respond to other mechanisms. We lay this argument
26:993:98505:18:18:62:208:497:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:out in more detail in this section.
26:994:98540:18:18:77:549:479:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:There are two key other potential interpretations. First, our results could be driven driven by an income
26:995:98645:18:18:62:549:461:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:effect. Second, the effect of a health professional in the family could stem from access to care rather than access
26:996:98760:18:18:62:549:443:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:to expertise. This “social capital” channel would imply that health professionals get their family members more
26:997:98871:18:18:62:549:425:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:or betterhealthcarerather than to more or betterexpertise- for example, by getting them quicker appointments
26:998:98979:18:32:62:224:407:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:or advocating for costlier treatments.
26:999:99017:32:18:62:549:375:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f2:B:Income effectsIf there are economic returns to becoming a medical doctor (Ketel et al.,2016), so that
26:1000:99118:18:18:62:549:357:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:becoming a physician also affects the economic well-being of the household, then we might be concerned that our
26:1001:99229:18:18:62:381:339:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:estimates simply reflect the fact that families with a physician are richer.
26:1002:99305:18:18:77:549:321:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:There are several pieces of evidence that suggest that our results are unlikely to be driven by income effects.
26:1003:99416:18:18:77:549:303:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:In our OLS analysis, we flexibly control for individual income as well as for the income of the highest-earning
26:1004:99527:18:18:62:549:285:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:relative. In the event studies, to address the potential concern of income effects, we contrast family members of
26:1005:99640:18:17:62:420:267:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:physicians to family members of lawyers, who have similar overall income profiles.
26:1006:99722:17:18:77:549:250:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:There are several points to consider in the lottery analysis. First, we directly test whether there are income
26:1007:99832:18:18:62:549:232:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:gains to “winning” the medical school lottery over the time horizon we consider, and we find no such effect at
26:1008:99942:18:18:62:549:214:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:any conventional level of statistical significance. This is intuitive for two reasons. The time horizon we consider
26:1009:100057:18:18:62:549:196:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:encompasses primarily the years of training rather than the years of working as a physician. Further, for the
26:1010:100166:18:18:62:549:178:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:highest achieving students who apply to medical schools, the most common second-preferred option after medical
26:1011:100276:18:18:62:549:160:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:school is another high-income occupation, such as business or engineering (we can directly observe this in the
26:1012:100386:18:18:62:549:142:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:university applications data, which contains each applicant’s rank ordered list of university programs).52Second,
26:1013:100499:18:18:62:549:124:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:in the 2SLS specifications for the health outcomes of younger generations, we are effectively measuring effects
26:1014:100610:18:15:62:549:106:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:on the siblings and cousins of physicians, since only very few young doctors have children of their own over the
26:1015:100722:15:12:69:549:91:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:52This finding differs from Ketel et al.(2016) who do find financial returns to medical school in the Dutch setting. This likely
26:1016:100850:12:9:62:549:79:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:reflects differential distributions of salaries, differences in the details of the educational systems in the two countries, as well as
26:1017:100985:9:0:62:177:70:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:differences in the time horizon.
27:1018:101019:0:18:62:549:719:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:time horizon that we consider. The income of the physician is unlikely to have a direct effect on the physician’s
27:1019:101132:18:18:62:549:701:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:sibling’s or cousin’s household incomes. Finally, when we focus on older generations (in the 2SLS specifications as
27:1020:101247:18:18:62:549:683:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:well as in the event studies), then any economic returns to the profession of the child are indirect, since parents,
27:1021:101363:18:31:62:526:665:10:g_d0_f2:7:g_d0_f4:B:aunts/uncles, and grandparents are not likely to live in the physician’s household in the Swedish setting.53
27:1022:101471:31:18:62:549:634:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f2:B:Social capitalAnother mechanism through which the presence of health professionals in the family can affect
27:1023:101578:18:18:62:549:616:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:health outcomes is what we refer to as the access to care (or “social capital”) mechanism, where the impact runs
27:1024:101690:18:18:62:428:598:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:through preferential informal access to healthcare within the formally equal system.
27:1025:101774:18:18:77:549:580:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:It is instructive to distinguish between the access to expertise and access to care channels, which in principle
27:1026:101886:18:18:62:549:562:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:may exist in tandem, as they have distinct policy implications. Conceptually, responses that stem from improved
27:1027:101997:18:18:62:549:544:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:access to expertise may be scalable through policy interventions; we discuss this in more detail later in this
27:1028:102107:18:18:62:549:526:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:section.  Benefits that stem from improved access to formal care, in contrast, cannot be scaled with fixed
27:1029:102213:18:18:62:549:508:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:healthcare resources, almost by definition: If the family members of health professionals bypass other patients
27:1030:102324:18:18:62:549:490:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:who lack connections, then this implies a zero-sum game where connected patients benefit at the expense of
27:1031:102430:18:18:62:549:472:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:unconnected ones. Hence, it is important to understand whether there is any evidence suggesting the presence
27:1032:102538:18:18:62:549:454:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:of the (potentially scalable) access to expertise channel. To do this, we focused our analysis in section4 on
27:1033:102647:18:18:62:506:436:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:outcomes that are more likely to be amenable to expertise and less likely to depend on access to care.
27:1034:102749:18:18:77:549:418:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Specifically, for older adults, we considered a set of chronic cardiovascular and metabolic conditions. The
27:1035:102856:18:18:62:549:400:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:prevalence and onset of these conditions is commonly attributed to lifestyle behaviors and adherence to medica-
27:1036:102967:18:17:62:549:382:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:tion rather than to any expensive (and hence potentially in shortage in the Swedish health care system) clinical
27:1037:103079:17:18:62:549:365:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:interventions. Further, improvements in these outcomes are not zero-sum: one patient avoiding a heart attack
27:1038:103187:18:18:62:549:347:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:does not come at the expense of another patient avoiding a heart attack, and so on. Second, we considered
27:1039:103292:18:18:62:549:329:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:preventive investments by older adults related to these lifestyle conditions: adherence to chronic cardiovascu-
27:1040:103403:18:18:62:549:311:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:lar medication, consumption of drugs for diabetes and asthma, and taking prescription strength Vitamin D.
27:1041:103508:18:18:62:549:293:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:A response in adherence to such drugs would very likely be driven by the expertise channel (which, broadly
27:1042:103614:18:18:62:549:275:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:defined, includes the provision of information about the benefits of these drugs; as well as reminders, nudges,
27:1043:103725:18:18:62:549:257:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:and “nagging” about drug adherence) rather than the access to care channel, as these medications are cheap and
27:1044:103835:18:18:62:549:239:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:easily obtainable – they are off patent, and included on the national prescription drug insurance formulary.54We
27:1045:103947:18:18:62:549:221:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:further investigated addiction andavoidanceof (potentially costly) hospitalizations, neither of which we would
27:1046:104057:18:18:62:217:203:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:expect to respond to access to care.
27:1047:104093:18:18:77:549:185:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Similarly, responses in the outcomes that we consider for the younger relatives are unlikely to stem from social
27:1048:104205:18:18:62:549:167:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:capital-type mechanisms. One patient obtaining the HPV vaccine or a non-hormonal method of contraception,
27:1049:104310:18:18:62:549:149:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:for example, does not come at the expense of another patient obtaining the same treatment. We also documented
27:1050:104419:18:18:62:549:131:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:a reduction in the number of inpatient stay days among family members of health care professionals; under the
27:1051:104528:18:14:62:549:113:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:access to care channel, we would have expected the reverse. Further, the rates of addiction and infections is likely
27:1052:104644:14:13:69:549:99:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:53The Swedish social insurance system stipulates widespread municipal care for the elderly that need long-term care, so even in
27:1053:104771:13:9:62:76:86:8:g_d0_f6:6:g_d0_f5:F:those cases any possible economic gains of the physician child are likely to be of secondary importance for health outcomes.54
27:1054:104897:9:9:77:549:77:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:In the lottery analysis, our results “show up” while physicians are still in training, and hence cannot prescribe these medications
27:1055:105028:9:0:62:267:68:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:themselves. This rules out “ease-of-prescribing”-effects.
28:1056:105087:0:18:62:549:719:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:to be diagnosed at higher rates conditional on the true prevalence of the disease among families with links to the
28:1057:105201:18:18:62:549:701:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:healthcare system; despite this, we consistently find either negative results or noisy zeros. In a nutshell, effects
28:1058:105317:18:18:62:371:683:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:on all these outcomes likely do not reflect the impact of access to care.
28:1059:105390:18:18:77:550:665:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:In sum, we establish impacts on outcomes that are inherentlynotzero-sum; that are driven by decisions that
28:1060:105496:18:17:62:549:647:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:individuals make in their everyday lives as opposed to actions by physicians within the healthcare system (lifestyle
28:1061:105612:17:18:62:549:630:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:decisions such as diet and exercise, tobacco use during pregnancy, and so on); and that involve adherence to
28:1062:105720:18:18:62:549:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:cheap and readily available drugs. These are outcomes for which “connections” to the healthcare system likely
28:1063:105829:18:18:62:549:594:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:matter very little. This is consistent with the fact that, in our lottery analysis, the “treated” group is exposed
28:1064:105943:18:18:62:549:576:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:to a young physician – either in medical school, or in the first two years after finishing medical training – who
28:1065:106056:18:18:62:177:558:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:likely has few connections.
28:1066:106083:18:18:77:549:540:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:In addition to focusing our analysis on outcomes that are likelynotdriven by access to care, we examine
28:1067:106186:18:18:62:549:522:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the importance of this channel directly. To do this, we investigate several outcomes that we can capture in the
28:1068:106297:18:18:62:549:504:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:data that reflect expensive or (in our setting) potentially rationed health care services, for which responses likely
28:1069:106414:18:18:62:331:486:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:would reflect the impact of connections rather than expertise.
28:1070:106476:18:18:77:549:468:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:First, we investigate whether family members of health professionals obtain more expensive heart attack
28:1071:106579:18:18:62:549:450:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:treatments.  The underlying idea is as follows.  There are two common invasive therapies, one of which is
28:1072:106684:18:18:62:549:432:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:substantially more expensive than the other, and one non-invasive (drug) therapy, which is the cheapest; under
28:1073:106794:18:18:62:549:414:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the “social capital” hypothesis, connected patients may be more likely to get a relatively expensive treatment
28:1074:106904:18:18:62:549:396:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:option (holding severity of the condition constant).55We find no evidence of differences in the probability of
28:1075:107014:18:17:62:549:378:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:getting an invasive (versus non-invasive) heart attack treatment across patients with and without an HP in the
28:1076:107124:17:18:62:549:361:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:extended family. Further, we find no difference in the intensity of invasive treatment conditional on getting an
28:1077:107236:18:18:62:285:343:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:invasive (i.e. surgery rather than drugs) treatment.
28:1078:107288:18:18:77:549:325:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Second, we investigate whether family members of health professionals have systematically longer stays in the
28:1079:107397:18:18:62:549:307:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:hospital after childbirth (conditioning on a wide range of characteristics capturing postpartum maternal health
28:1080:107508:18:18:62:549:289:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:and the child’s health at birth). Despite the fact that the duration of postpartum care is generally rationed in
28:1081:107620:18:18:62:549:271:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the Swedish healthcare system – mothers are discharged as early as six hours after childbirth, while mothers in
28:1082:107731:18:18:62:549:253:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the U.S. are legally entitled to stay for up to 48 hours, depending on the state – we do not find any differences
28:1083:107844:18:18:62:390:235:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:in the length of stay across patients with and without an HP in the family.
28:1084:107919:18:18:77:549:217:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Third, we examine the importance of the access to care channel for cancer treatment, as existing literature
28:1085:108026:18:18:62:549:199:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:has documented that connections appear relevant for the choice and speed of cancer treatments (Fiva et al.,
28:1086:108133:18:18:62:549:181:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:2014). Here, we do find a smaller time window between the first diagnosis of breast cancer and breast cancer
28:1087:108241:18:18:62:549:163:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:surgery among family members of health professionals. However, there is no pronounced income gradient in the
28:1088:108349:18:18:62:549:145:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:prevalence of cancers, nor in mortality attributable to cancer.56This suggests that, at the population level, the
28:1089:108462:18:14:62:549:127:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:access to care channel does not generate substantial differences in cancer-related outcomes across the income
28:1090:108571:14:13:69:549:113:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:55The two invasive therapies are coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), with the
28:1091:108697:13:9:62:76:100:8:g_d0_f6:6:g_d0_f5:F:former being a more expensive open heart surgery.56
28:1092:108748:9:10:77:549:91:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:In fact, if anything, we observe aninverseSES-gradient in cancers, which likely is driven by competing risks with cardiovascular
28:1093:108876:10:9:62:549:81:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:diseases as well as more screening at the upper end of the income distribution. The exception is lung cancer; however, it accounts
28:1094:109006:9:0:62:196:72:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:for a very small share of all cancers.
29:1095:109046:0:18:62:116:719:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:distribution.
29:1096:109059:18:18:77:549:701:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:To be clear, our investigation into access to care mechanisms is not exhaustive – this, however, is beyond the
29:1097:109169:18:18:62:549:683:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:scope of our paper. Overall, our focus on expertise-amenable outcomes allows us to argue that there exists an
29:1098:109278:18:18:62:550:665:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:effect of health professionals on their family members’ healththat does not run through social capital, and hence
29:1099:109391:18:17:62:549:647:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:that may be scalable. Moreover, our results point to simple interventions such as encouragement of vaccination,
29:1100:109502:17:18:62:549:630:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:promotion of adherence to basic chronic medication, and aid in cessation of tobacco use among pregnant women.
29:1101:109611:18:18:62:549:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:It is noteworthy that any interventions that increase these beneficial behaviors will have only a small effect
29:1102:109721:18:18:62:549:594:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:on health care expenditure. Moreover, they are cheap when compared to other potential interventions aimed
29:1103:109826:18:18:62:549:576:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:at improving population health, such as expansions of access to expensive treatments conditional on having a
29:1104:109934:18:35:62:95:558:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:disease.
29:1105:109942:35:24:62:349:523:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:5.2  Implications for the health-income gradient
29:1106:109990:24:18:62:549:499:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:So far we have showed that there is an average treatment effect of being exposed to a health professional in
29:1107:110098:18:18:62:549:481:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the family on health. We have also documented that the effects on health do not accrue only at the top of the
29:1108:110207:18:18:62:549:463:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:income distribution, but instead are similar, or even more pronounced, in the first half of the income distribution.
29:1109:110323:18:18:62:549:445:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:We now use these findings to create a “fully-informed” counterfactual. That is, we ask how the health-income
29:1110:110431:18:18:62:549:427:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:gradient would change if we made everyone in society exposed to expertise. We then discuss potential policy
29:1111:110538:18:18:62:549:409:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:interventions that could “mimic” intra-family expertise (without raising the number of health professionals in
29:1112:110648:18:18:62:274:391:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:families) for moving towards this counterfactual.
29:1113:110697:18:18:77:549:373:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:To create our counterfactual, we need two inputs: (i) the impact of expertise on health at different points
29:1114:110804:18:18:62:549:355:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:in the income distribution; and (ii) the baseline distribution of access to expertise in society today, i.e., in the
29:1115:110920:18:18:62:213:337:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:absence of any policy intervention.
29:1116:110955:18:18:77:549:319:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:It is straightforward to see why we need (i), and our finding that the beneficial effects of exposure to health-
29:1117:111067:18:18:62:549:301:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:related information are weakly larger at the lower end of the income distribution already suggests that a policy
29:1118:111179:18:18:62:549:283:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:that makes everyone exposed to expertise could close part of the health-SES gradient. If, in addition, individuals
29:1119:111293:18:18:62:549:265:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:at the lower end of the income distribution have access to less expertise, then this would further reinforce the
29:1120:111405:18:17:62:549:247:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:impact of policies that provide access to expertise on overall health inequality (as a larger share of individuals at
29:1121:111522:17:18:62:549:230:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the lower end of the income distribution would move from “unexposed” to “exposed” under such a counterfactual).
29:1122:111633:18:18:62:221:212:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:Thus, we turn to a discussion of (ii).
29:1123:111671:18:18:77:549:194:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f2:A:The baseline distribution of expertiseIt seems a priori reasonable to hypothesize that individuals at
29:1124:111772:18:18:62:549:176:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the higher rungs of the income ladder have access to more expertise. Intuitively, they likely have had a longer
29:1125:111883:18:18:62:549:158:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:formal education, have access to more informed friends and relatives, a higher ability to search for information
29:1126:111995:18:18:62:549:140:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:on their own, and possibly more “mental bandwidth” to remember to take prescribed medications, among other
29:1127:112101:18:18:62:549:122:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:channels (Mullainathan and Shafir,2013). Table6 provides empirical evidence in support of this idea. Here,
29:1128:112207:18:18:62:549:104:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:we use data for Sweden from two waves of the European Social Survey, run in 2004 and 2014, when the health-
29:1129:112314:18:18:62:549:86:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:related questionnaires were included. We use six measures that may reflect the degree of access to health-related
29:1130:112427:18:0:62:549:68:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:expertise: (i) whether individuals agree to the statement that “a doctor always tells the truth;” (ii) whether
30:1131:112539:0:18:62:549:719:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:they prefer to see the same doctor over time; (iii) whether they regularly eat fruits; (iv) whether they regularly
30:1132:112653:18:18:62:549:701:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:eat vegetables; (v) whether they exercise regularly; and (vi) whether they smoke. The first two measures are in
30:1133:112764:18:18:62:549:683:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:principle indicative of the “demand” for expertise and trust-based relationships, which we would expect to be
30:1134:112873:18:18:62:549:665:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:higher if access to expertise outside of the formal healthcare environment is scarcer. The latter four measures
30:1135:112984:18:17:62:263:647:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:are indicative of individuals’ health behaviors.
30:1136:113032:17:18:77:549:630:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:We relate these survey responses to whether the individual has a college degree.  This is a measure of
30:1137:113134:18:18:62:549:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:socioeconomic status that is both available in the survey and allows us to connect the survey evidence to our
30:1138:113243:18:18:62:549:594:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:administrative data, since in the administrative data we observe the share of individuals with a college degree
30:1139:113354:18:18:62:549:576:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:at any point in the income distribution. As columns (1)-(6) of Table6 illustrate, we find a strong correlation
30:1140:113464:18:18:62:549:558:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:between formal education and our proxy measures for exposure to health expertise. This is consistent with the
30:1141:113573:18:18:62:544:540:10:g_d0_f2:7:g_d0_f4:B:idea that individuals with lower socioeconomic status have access to less health-related expertise at baseline.57
30:1142:113686:18:18:77:549:522:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Given this evidence, in our counterfactual calculation we use the share of individuals with a college degree as a
30:1143:113799:18:18:62:549:504:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:proxy measure for the prevalence of access to expertise. FigureA3 in the Appendix plots the share of individuals
30:1144:113911:18:18:62:549:486:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:with a college degree across the income distribution in Sweden. For the cohorts for which we consider mortality
30:1145:114022:18:18:62:549:468:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:outcomes by age 80 - 1936 to 1937 - 7% of individuals had a college degree in the lower half of the income
30:1146:114128:18:18:62:549:450:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:distribution, while 31% had a college degree in the top half of the income distribution.58The large difference
30:1147:114238:18:18:62:549:432:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:in formal education – and in the health-related survey responses associated with it in the ESS data – across
30:1148:114346:18:18:62:549:414:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the income distribution suggests that access to the type of expertise that is relevant for making decisions about
30:1149:114459:18:18:62:549:396:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:health behaviors and health investments likely is substantially scarcer at the lower end of the SES spectrum than
30:1150:114572:18:17:62:108:378:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:at the top.
30:1151:114583:17:18:77:549:361:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f2:A:A counterfactual: universal access to expertiseIn Figure10, we combine our findings into a back-of-
30:1152:114682:18:18:62:549:343:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the-envelope calculation of the potential effect of providing universal access to expertise on the mortality-income
30:1153:114797:18:18:62:549:325:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:gradient. We make the following two assumptions: First, we assume a uniform treatment effect of access to
30:1154:114902:18:18:62:549:307:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:expertise on mortality of 10% across the income distribution. This is our aggregate estimate from the event study
30:1155:115015:18:18:62:549:289:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:(which is consistent with the estimate from our non-parametric analysis); thus, it is a conservative estimate of
30:1156:115127:18:18:62:549:271:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the impact on mortality at the lower end of the income distribution. Second, we assume that the baseline level
30:1157:115237:18:18:62:549:253:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:of expertise follows the same distribution as the college share, so that we start from a situation in which 7% of
30:1158:115350:18:18:62:549:235:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:individuals in the first half of the income distribution have access to expertise, while 31% do at the top. Under
30:1159:115463:18:18:62:549:217:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:these two assumptions, we compute the counterfactual mortality levels that would result, in the top and the
30:1160:115570:18:18:62:540:199:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:bottom halves of the income distribution, respectively, under a policy that gives universal access to expertise.
30:1161:115682:18:18:77:549:181:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:To compute counterfactual morality as the bottom (top) half of the income distribution, we start with
30:1162:115783:18:18:62:549:163:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:observed mortality by age 80 (at the level reported in Figure1A). We then assume that a hypothetical policy
30:1163:115890:18:18:62:549:145:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:moves the percentage of individuals that have access to expertise by 93 (69) percentage points (moving everyone
30:1164:116001:18:15:62:549:127:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:to 100%), and that these “treated” individuals experience a 10% reduction in mortality.59The calculation
30:1165:116105:15:12:69:549:112:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:57As a sanity check on the ESS survey data, we also verify that individuals without a college degree report being in worse health

30:1167:116261:7:12:69:549:93:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:58The gap in formal education is comparable for younger cohorts. In a pooled sample across all cohorts for whom we can observe
30:1168:116387:12:10:62:549:81:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:formal education levels, 16% of individuals have a college degree in the bottom half of the income distribution, and 44% in the top
30:1169:116518:10:9:62:76:71:8:g_d0_f6:6:g_d0_f5:F:half.59
30:1170:116525:9:0:77:549:62:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:The resulting formula for counterfactual mortality is: observed mortality within the income group times the treatment effect
31:1171:116651:0:18:62:549:719:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:suggests that a policy that creates universal access to health-related expertise by successfully mimicking intra-
31:1172:116764:18:18:62:549:701:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:family communication would shrink the mortality-income gap substantially: from the observed mortality gap of
31:1173:116872:18:18:62:549:683:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:0.076 between the top and the bottom halves of the income distribution, to 0.063. This corresponds to a 18%
31:1174:116979:18:18:62:239:665:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:reduction in the mortality-SES gradient.
31:1175:117019:18:17:77:549:647:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Our illustrative computation has important implications for health inequality, as it suggests that the asym-
31:1176:117127:17:18:62:549:630:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:metry in the quality and ease of access to health-related expertise across the socio-economic distribution can
31:1177:117237:18:18:62:549:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:generate and sustain a significant share of the health-SES gradient,evenin the presence of the equalized formal
31:1178:117348:18:18:62:296:594:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:access to healthcare, and a generous social safety net.
31:1179:117403:18:18:77:550:576:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f2:A:Towards closing the health inequality gapWhile the benchmark of universal expertise is instructive in
31:1180:117504:18:18:62:549:558:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:its own right – not the least by emphasizing that unequal access to expertise can, on its own, sustain substantial
31:1181:117618:18:18:62:549:540:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:health inequality – we now speculate as to whether our findings point to particular policy interventions that may
31:1182:117731:18:18:62:336:522:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:be able to scale up the beneficial impact of access to expertise.
31:1183:117796:18:18:77:549:504:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:One view of our results is that they emphasize the limits of government intervention.  Sweden provides
31:1184:117898:18:18:62:549:486:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:cheap and universal access to inpatient and specialized care, prenatal care, primary care, prescription drugs, and
31:1185:118012:18:18:62:549:468:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:vaccines; and yet substantial inequality remains. Our results indicate that this remaining inequality could in
31:1186:118122:18:18:62:549:450:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:part stem from decisions that individuals make outside of the healthcare system, such as whether to undertake
31:1187:118231:18:18:62:549:432:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:beneficial lifestyle investments, whether to adhere to prescribed (and cheap) drugs, whether to take up vaccines,
31:1188:118344:18:18:62:289:414:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:and whether to cease tobacco use during pregnancy.
31:1189:118394:18:18:77:549:396:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:On the other hand, our results suggest that a policy that were able to “mimic” what health professionals do
31:1190:118501:18:17:62:549:378:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:for their family members – and thus induce better drug adherence, a higher immunization rate, and cessation of
31:1191:118611:17:18:62:549:361:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:tobacco use in pregnancy, for example – would have the potential to make a substantial dent in population health
31:1192:118723:18:18:62:549:343:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:and reduce health inequality. It is thus worthwhile to consider the specific features of intra-family communication,
31:1193:118839:18:18:62:549:325:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:and whether a policy maker may be able to replicate (some of) those. If intra-family health professionals simply
31:1194:118951:18:18:62:549:307:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:transfer knowledge to their family members, then any information provision campaign may be effective.  To
31:1195:119056:18:18:62:549:289:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the extent that the power of intra-family communication about health stems from trust or detailed knowledge
31:1196:119163:18:18:62:549:271:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:about the health history and habits that come with a relationship that spans a long period of time, effective
31:1197:119272:18:18:62:549:253:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:policies may need to strive to mimic the depth of these relationships. We speculate that elements of such a
31:1198:119379:18:18:62:549:235:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f3:B:policy could include nurse outreach programs with a strong emphasis on the continuity of care (yieldinglong-
31:1199:119487:18:18:62:549:217:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:B:termrelationships), coupled with a strengthening of the role of a trusted and easily accessible - both in terms
31:1200:119598:18:18:62:549:199:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:of geographic location and the administrative hurdles - general practitioner who knows patients, and potentially
31:1201:119710:18:18:62:550:181:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:their whole family, over a long period of time. Further,Alsan et al.(2018) suggests that providers which resemble
31:1202:119823:18:18:62:549:163:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the patient (in their case, same-race providers) may gain more trust. Finally, given the heterogeneous effects
31:1203:119933:18:18:62:549:145:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:across the income distribution, such programs specifically targeted at the poor may have the largest potential to
31:1204:120046:18:17:62:169:127:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:reduce health inequality.

31:1206:120203:10:9:62:549:100:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:denominator term re-scales the numerator to account for the differences in the baseline levels of access to expertise and hence the
31:1207:120334:9:0:62:201:91:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:share of individuals that gets treated.
32:1208:120375:0:28:62:163:719:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:6  Conclusion
32:1209:120388:28:18:62:549:691:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:Growing evidence across various disciplines reveals stark correlations between health capital throughout the
32:1210:120496:18:17:62:549:673:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:course of life and a range of measures of socioeconomic status, such as education, social class, and income. Yet,
32:1211:120609:17:18:62:364:656:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the mechanisms underlying these associations are poorly understood.
32:1212:120676:18:18:77:549:638:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:A common explanation (and a policy focus) for the existence and persistence of health-SES gradients is the
32:1213:120782:18:18:62:549:620:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:difference in formal access to healthcare across the SES-spectrum. Our evidence suggests that this explanation can
32:1214:120896:18:18:62:549:602:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:only be one piece of the puzzle when it comes to understanding the origins of SES-gradients (as crucially distinct
32:1215:121010:18:18:62:549:584:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:from levels) in health. Using rich administrative data from Sweden, we document that strong socioeconomic
32:1216:121115:18:18:62:549:566:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:gradients in mortality and morbidity persist in Sweden, across a range of ages and conditions,despiteequalized
32:1217:121225:18:18:62:549:548:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:formal access to healthcare and a well-developed social safety net. This fact motivates us to examine a mechanism
32:1218:121338:18:18:62:549:530:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:other than access to formal health insurance and healthcare that may perpetuate socio-economic gradients in
32:1219:121445:18:18:62:92:512:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:health.
32:1220:121452:18:18:77:549:494:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Specifically, we investigate whether access to health-related expertise - throughout an individual’s lifetime -
32:1221:121563:18:18:62:549:476:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:can improve (the level) of health outcomes, while differences in access to such expertise at different points on the
32:1222:121679:18:18:62:344:458:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:socio-economic ladder can sustain inequality in health outcomes.
32:1223:121743:18:18:77:549:440:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:To create a quantifiable metric of access to expertise, we zoom into an environment where we can precisely
32:1224:121849:18:18:62:549:422:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:measure individuals’ exposure to health-related expertise: the presence of a health professional in the family.
32:1225:121960:18:17:62:549:404:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:Using non-parametric evidence, event studies, and exploiting “admissions lotteries” into medical school, we find
32:1226:122072:17:18:62:549:387:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:that access to expertise has an important impact on health (level): children and adults that are “exposed” to a
32:1227:122183:18:18:62:549:369:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:health professional in the family live longer, are significantly healthier, are more likely to engage in preventive
32:1228:122298:18:18:62:549:351:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:health behaviors, and are more likely to adhere to medication. What’s more, the benefits of access to expertise
32:1229:122409:18:18:62:428:333:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:appear to be weakly larger for individuals at the bottom of the income distribution.
32:1230:122493:18:18:77:549:315:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:These estimates imply that the scarcity of access to expertise in households at the lower rungs of the socio-
32:1231:122602:18:18:62:549:297:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:economic ladder could create and sustain inequality in health outcomes — even in an environment with fully
32:1232:122708:18:18:62:549:279:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:equalized access to formal healthcare, generous social insurance programs, and a wide social safety net. It is
32:1233:122818:18:18:62:549:261:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:encouraging, however, that the benefits accruing to medical professionals’ family members appear to be scalable.
32:1234:122930:18:18:62:549:243:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:Our analysis suggests that access to expertise improves health not through preferential treatment, but rather
32:1235:123039:18:18:62:549:225:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:through intra-family transmission of “low-tech” (and hence, cheap) determinants of health, likely ranging from
32:1236:123149:18:18:62:549:207:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:the sharing of nuanced knowledge about healthy behaviors, to reminders about adherence to chronic medication,
32:1237:123258:18:18:62:549:189:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:to frequent and trustful communication about existing health. This implies that public health policies, as well as
32:1238:123372:18:18:62:549:171:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:carefully designed public and private health insurance contracts that successfully mimic intra-famiy transmission
32:1239:123485:18:18:62:549:153:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:of health-related expertise, would have the potential to close a significant share - our estimates suggest as much
32:1240:123599:18:0:62:214:135:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:as 18% - of the SES-mortality gap.

62:1993:174179:24:18:62:549:664:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:A growing literature has documented that early life interventions have a positive effect on infant mortality and
62:1994:174291:18:18:62:549:646:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:can promote health in the long-run, suggesting that conditions in infancy are a relevant source of health and

62:1999:174829:18:18:62:549:556:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:that the intervention had a positive and significant effect on the infant first-year survival rate in Danish towns
62:2000:174943:18:17:62:549:538:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:and was most effective in the majority of small and medium-sized municipalities. The authors suggests that the
62:2001:175053:17:18:62:549:521:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:main driver of the programâs impact was the promotion of breastfeeding and appropriate infant nutrition by
62:2002:175159:18:18:62:549:503:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:visiting nurses. In a related study,Hjort et al.(2017) examine the long-term impact of the Danish home visiting
62:2003:175270:18:18:62:549:485:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:program.  They find that treated individuals that were visited by nurses in infancy experience better health

62:2005:175493:18:18:62:549:449:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:cardiovascular diseases. Similarly,Butikofer et al.(2015) investigate the long-term impact of mother and child
62:2006:175603:18:18:62:549:431:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:health care centers in Norway and find that the increasing access to well-child visits had a positive effect on

62:2012:176192:24:18:62:549:300:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:Community health workers (CHWs) have been employed in many countries to provide health-related services
62:2013:176295:18:18:62:549:282:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:to their fellow community members.  Although there has not been many rigorous evaluations, most existing
62:2014:176399:18:18:62:549:264:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:evidence suggests that CHWs increase takeup rates of a wide variety of healthy behaviors and improve disease

62:2018:176830:18:18:62:549:192:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:have been shown to improve access to medical services, especially for marginalized populations (Felix et al.,2011;

62:2023:177286:18:18:62:549:103:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:poor. The paper finds that, in one decade after CHCs were established, CHCs reduced age-adjusted all-cause
62:2024:177392:18:18:62:549:85:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:mortality rates by 7 to 13 percent among the poor aged 50 and older, with the reduction primarily driven by the
62:2025:177503:18:0:62:549:67:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:decline in cardiovascular-related deaths. The authors argue that having access to a regular source of care, lower
63:2026:177618:0:18:62:549:719:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:medication cost, and improved compliance with prescription drugs were the main mechanisms for the effects of

63:2041:179002:18:18:62:549:427:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:disease, and diabetes patients. The authors find that, regardless of study design and time horizon, interventions
63:2042:179115:18:18:62:549:409:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:that promote patient education are beneficial in terms of decreased hospital admissions, fewer visits to emergency

63:2044:179320:18:18:77:549:373:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A:Similarly,Wang et al.(2017) review randomized control trials that investigate effects of self-management

63:2048:179750:18:18:62:549:301:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:with coronary heart diseases. The study reviews 22 randomized control trials that assigned patients to different
63:2049:179862:18:18:62:549:283:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:educational interventions that ranged from face-to-face counseling to residential stays with follow-up sessions.
63:2050:179974:18:18:62:549:265:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:Patients in control groups received usual medical care in cardiac rehab that comprises exercise counseling and
63:2051:180084:18:17:62:549:247:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:training and psychological support. The paper finds that, although there is limited evidence that education-
63:2052:180192:17:18:62:549:230:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:B:based interventions reduce total mortality, the risk of a heart attack, or the number of hospitalizations, these
