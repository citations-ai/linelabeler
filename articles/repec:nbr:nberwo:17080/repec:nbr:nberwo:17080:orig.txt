2:28:1462:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:What monetary policy framework, if adopted by the Federal Reserve, would have avoided the Great
2:29:1557:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:Inflation of the 1960s and 1970s? We use counterfactual simulations of an estimated model of the
2:30:1653:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:U.S. economy to evaluate alternative monetary policy strategies. We show that policies constructed
2:31:1751:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:using modern optimal control techniques aimed at stabilizing inflation, economic activity, and interest
2:32:1854:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:rates would have succeeded in achieving a high degree of economic stability as well as price stability
2:33:1956:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:only if the Federal Reserve had possessed excellent information regarding the structure of the economy
2:34:2058:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:or if it had acted as if it placed relatively low weight on stabilizing the real economy. Neither condition
2:35:2165:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:held true. We document that policymakers at the time both had an overly optimistic view of the natural
2:36:2267:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:rate of unemployment and put a high priority on achieving full employment. We show that in the presence
2:37:2370:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:of realistic informational imperfections and with an emphasis on stabilizing economic activity, an
2:38:2468:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:optimal control approach would have failed to keep inflation expectations well anchored, resulting
2:39:2566:14:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:in high and highly volatile inflation during the 1970s. Finally, we show that a strategy of following
2:40:2667:14:14:72:540:420:12:Times:12:Times:a robust first-difference policy rule would have been highly effective at stabilizing inflation and unemployment
2:41:2779:14:14:72:540:406:12:Times:12:Times:in the presence of informational imperfections. This robust monetary policy rule yields simulated outcomes
2:42:2885:14:42:72:532:392:12:Times:12:Times:that are close to those seen during the period of the Great Moderation starting in the mid-1980s.

3:55:3333:22:22:117:495:672:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the general price level. By training, if not also by temperament, they are inclined
3:56:3416:22:22:117:495:650:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:to lay great stress on price stability. . . .  And yet, despite their antipathy to
3:57:3498:22:22:117:495:628:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:inflation and the powerful weapons they could yield against it, central bankers
3:58:3577:22:22:117:495:606:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:have failed so utterly in this mission in recent years. In this paradox lies the
3:59:3657:22:35:117:379:584:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:anguish of central banking. (Arthur Burns, 1979, p. 7)
3:60:3711:35:33:89:202:549:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:1  Introduction
3:61:3726:33:22:90:522:516:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Numerous explanations have been put forward for the causes of the Great Inflation of the
3:62:3814:22:22:89:521:494:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:late 1960s and 1970s in the United States.  But one explanation that may be the most
3:63:3898:22:22:90:522:472:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:worrisome for the future is that policy mistakes made by otherwise well-informed and well-
3:64:3988:22:22:89:521:450:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:intentioned policymakers, free of institutional and political constraints, were responsible
3:65:4079:22:22:90:522:428:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:for these outcomes.  The epigraph quoted above, from the 1979 Per Jacobsson Lecture
3:66:4162:22:22:89:521:406:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:delivered by Arthur Burns shortly after the end of his tenure as Chairman of the Federal
3:67:4250:22:23:90:522:384:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Reserve, exemplifies this concern. In this paper, we provide a historical account of the Great
3:68:4344:23:22:89:521:361:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Inflation and subsequent evolution of the economy in the United States using an estimated
3:69:4433:22:22:90:522:339:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:model with a benevolent and sophisticated policymaker.  We examine how the economy
3:70:4515:22:22:89:521:317:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:would have fared if the Federal Reserve had applied modern optimal control techniques—of
3:71:4603:22:22:90:522:295:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the type recommended by many academic researchers today—to reach its policy decisions
3:72:4688:22:22:89:522:273:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:from the middle of the 1960s on.1We then compare the resulting simulated outcomes to
3:73:4772:22:22:89:521:251:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:those obtained under alternative monetary policy strategies designed to be robust to model
3:74:4862:22:22:90:168:229:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:misspecification.
3:75:4879:22:22:106:521:207:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:The main thesis of this paper is that the modern optimal control approach to monetary
3:76:4964:22:23:89:521:185:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:policy is prone to inviting policy errors that lead to instability in inflation and inflation
3:77:5057:23:16:90:522:162:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:expectations like those that occurred during the Great Inflation, while alternative robust
3:78:5147:16:14:102:521:146:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:1Optimal control methods were first developed in the 1960s and have gained popularity in the academic

4:83:5635:0:22:90:522:694:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:policy strategies could have been more effective at stabilizing inflation and unemployment.
4:84:5726:22:22:89:521:672:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Our reading of the narrative evidence highlights three critical factors that contributed to
4:85:5817:22:22:90:522:650:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the unmooring of inflation expectations and the resulting runaway inflation of the Great
4:86:5905:22:22:89:521:628:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Inflation. First, policymakers placed a high priority on stabilizing real economic activity
4:87:5996:22:22:90:522:606:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:relative to price stability. Second, they severely overestimated the productive capacity of
4:88:6087:22:23:89:521:584:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the economy during the critical period of 1965 to 1975. In particular, contemporaneous
4:89:6173:23:22:90:522:561:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:measures of the unemployment rate corresponding to full employment were significantly
4:90:6258:22:22:89:521:539:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:lower than retrospective estimates. Third, they were overly confident of their understanding
4:91:6350:22:22:90:522:517:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:of the precise linkage between measures of utilization gaps and inflation.  The modern
4:92:6436:22:22:89:472:495:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:optimal control approach is not designed to protect against any of these factors.
4:93:6517:22:22:106:521:473:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:This paper provides a “stress test” of optimal control policies and other policy strategies
4:94:6608:22:22:89:521:451:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:to see how they would have fared in times of particular macroeconomic turmoil and when the
4:95:6698:22:22:90:522:429:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:central bank faced imperfect information. The 1960s and 1970s provide an ideal laboratory
4:96:6787:22:22:89:521:407:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:for such an experiment. The U.S. economy was buffeted by large shocks, providing severe
4:97:6874:22:23:90:522:385:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:stress to the economy, and the realized macroeconomic performance was abysmal.  Our
4:98:6957:23:22:89:521:362:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:analysis is related to that of Orphanides (2002) and Orphanides and Williams (2005a), who
4:99:7046:22:22:90:522:340:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:show that a strong response to flawed measures of economic slack can help explain the
4:100:7131:22:22:89:521:318:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:very high inflation and unemployment that developed during the 1960s and 1970s and that
4:101:7218:22:22:90:522:296:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:policies that reacted less aggressively to slack would have been more effective at stabilizing
4:102:7312:22:22:89:521:274:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:both inflation and unemployment during that period.  The contribution of the current
4:103:7396:22:22:90:522:252:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:paper is to analyze the stabilization properties of optimal control policies and alternative
4:104:7488:22:22:89:521:230:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:policy approaches using counterfactual simulations of the U.S. economy over the past several
4:105:7580:22:23:90:522:208:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:decades. In so doing, we aim to use the experiences of the past to glean lessons for the
4:106:7668:23:22:89:317:185:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:design of robust monetary policy for the future.
4:107:7716:22:22:106:521:163:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Our model respects the natural rate hypothesis and shares key features with modern
4:108:7798:22:22:89:521:141:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:models used for monetary policy analysis. We investigate what would have happened over
4:109:7884:22:22:90:522:119:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:history had policymakers implemented state-of-the-art optimal control methods under the
4:110:7971:22:0:89:521:97:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:assumption of rational expectations. We focus on the difficulties associated with anchoring
5:111:8063:0:22:90:522:694:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:inflation expectations when policymakers attempt to maintain a high degree of employment
5:112:8151:22:22:89:521:672:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:stability relative to price stability in an environment where the central bank has imperfect
5:113:8243:22:22:90:522:650:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:information about the economy.  The estimated model confirms the presence of adverse
5:114:8327:22:22:89:521:628:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:supply shocks and natural rate misperceptions during the 1970s, which caused policy to
5:115:8413:22:22:90:522:606:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:become overly expansionary. However, we find that these shocks alone cannot account for
5:116:8500:22:23:89:236:584:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the Great Inflation experience.
5:117:8531:23:22:106:521:561:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Using counterfactual simulations, we show that in the absence of informational im-
5:118:8613:22:22:89:521:539:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:perfections, following the optimal control policy during the 1960s and 1970s would have
5:119:8700:22:22:90:522:517:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:maintained reasonably well-anchored inflation expectations and succeeded in achieving a
5:120:8787:22:22:89:521:495:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:relatively high degree of economic and price stability. Under these assumptions, monetary
5:121:8876:22:22:90:477:473:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:policy could have offset the shocks that buffeted the economy during this period.
5:122:8957:22:22:106:521:451:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:However, our model simulations also show that informational imperfections, such as
5:123:9039:22:22:89:521:429:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:policymakers’ misperceptions of the natural rate of unemployment, significantly reduce the
5:124:9129:22:22:90:522:407:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:effectiveness of this approach to policy. The presence of imperfect knowledge amplifies the
5:125:9220:22:23:89:521:385:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:effects of the underlying shocks, and optimal control monetary policies designed assuming
5:126:9309:23:22:90:522:362:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:complete information would have failed to keep inflation expectations well anchored. Indeed,
5:127:9401:22:22:89:521:340:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:optimal control policies would have avoided the Great Inflation only if the weight given to
5:128:9492:22:22:90:522:318:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:stabilizing the real economy were relatively modest—with the best results achieved if the
5:129:9581:22:22:89:307:296:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:most weight were placed on stabilizing prices.
5:130:9627:22:22:106:521:274:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:We also examine an alternative policy strategy that could have been more robust and
5:131:9710:22:22:89:521:252:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:avoided this experience, even in the presence of supply shocks and natural rate mispercep-
5:132:9800:22:22:90:522:230:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:tions. We show that such a strategy would have been very effective at stabilizing inflation
5:133:9891:22:23:89:521:208:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:and economic activity, despite the large shocks of the 1970s. A striking result is that this
5:134:9983:23:22:90:522:185:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:policy rule yields simulated outcomes close to the realized behavior of the economy dur-
5:135:10071:22:22:89:521:163:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:ing the Great Moderation starting in the mid-1980s, suggesting that the actual practice of
5:136:10161:22:22:90:522:141:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:monetary policy during this period changed in ways that incorporated the key properties
5:137:10248:22:22:89:256:119:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:of the robust monetary policy rule.
5:138:10283:22:0:106:521:97:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 examines the narrative
6:139:10368:0:22:90:522:694:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:evidence of policymakers’ views on the natural rate of unemployment and the importance
6:140:10454:22:22:89:521:672:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:of stabilizing economic activity during the 1960s and 1970s. Our model of the U.S. economy
6:141:10544:22:22:90:522:650:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:and its estimation are described in Section 3. Section 4 describes the optimal control mon-
6:142:10635:22:22:89:521:628:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:etary policy and its implementation in the model simulations. The models of expectations
6:143:10723:22:22:90:522:606:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:formation and the simulation methods are described in Sections 5 and 6, respectively. Sec-
6:144:10813:22:23:89:521:584:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:tion 7 examines the performance of the optimal control policy using counterfactual model
6:145:10901:23:22:90:522:561:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:simulations. Section 8 analyzes the performance of a simple robust monetary policy rule,
6:146:10989:22:34:89:206:539:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:and Section 9 concludes.
6:147:11013:34:33:90:258:505:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:2  A Narrative History
6:148:11035:33:22:89:521:472:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:In this section, we examine the narrative evidence regarding the views of policymakers
6:149:11121:22:22:90:522:450:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:regarding the natural rate of unemployment and the role of stabilizing real activity at “full
6:150:11214:22:22:89:522:428:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:employment” before, during, and after the Great Inflation.2We use this narrative evidence
6:151:11303:22:22:89:521:406:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:to inform the specification of monetary policy in the model simulations reported in the
6:152:11390:22:23:90:248:384:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:subsequent sections of the paper.
6:153:11423:23:22:106:521:361:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:To set the stage for later events, it is useful to recall the evolution of the policy debate in
6:154:11518:22:22:89:521:339:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the post-World War II period. In the Employment Act of 1946, Congress declared that “it
6:155:11605:22:22:90:522:317:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:is the continuing policy and responsibility of the Federal Government to use all practicable
6:156:11697:22:22:89:521:295:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:means ... to promote maximum employment, production and purchasing power” (quoted in
6:157:11781:22:22:90:522:273:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Council of Economic Advisers, 1966, p. 170).3Until the 1960s, policymakers interpreted the
6:158:11871:22:22:89:521:251:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Employment Act of 1946 to be a broad mandate to protect price stability, that is, to promote
6:159:11963:22:22:90:522:229:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:“purchasing power” and growth and to dampen business cycle fluctuations. In congressional
6:160:12052:22:22:89:521:207:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:testimony in August 1957, for example, Federal Reserve Chairman William McChesney
6:161:12133:22:23:90:522:185:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Martin stated that “[t]he objective of the System is always the same—to promote monetary
6:162:12221:23:16:89:521:162:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:and credit conditions that will foster sustained economic growth together with stability in

6:165:12448:7:15:102:522:125:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:3Chapter 7 of the 1966Economic Report of the Presidentwas devoted to the 20 years of experience with
6:166:12548:15:11:89:521:110:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:the Act since it became law on February 20, 1946.  This edition of the report, published in early 1966,

7:168:12734:0:22:90:522:694:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the value of the dollar.” To this end, he stressed the importance of price stability: “Price
7:169:12826:22:22:89:521:672:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:stability is essential to sustainable growth. Inflation fosters maladjustments” (Martin, 1957,
7:170:12920:22:22:90:117:650:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:p. 8).
7:171:12926:22:22:106:521:628:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:During the 1960s, an increasing number of economists argued that fiscal and monetary
7:172:13010:22:22:89:521:606:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:policy should play a more active role in managing aggregate demand with the goal of achiev-
7:173:13101:22:23:90:522:584:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:ing and maintaining full employment. In 1961, the incoming Council of Economic Advisers
7:174:13188:23:22:89:521:561:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:(CEA) adopted what became known as the “New Economics,” which was highlighted in
7:175:13268:22:22:90:522:539:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the 1962Economic Report of the President(Council of Economic Advisers, 1962). The new
7:176:13353:22:22:89:521:517:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:strategy was eloquently summarized by Walter Heller, who, according toTime Magazine,
7:177:13437:22:22:89:521:495:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:as “Chief Economic Adviser of the Kennedy Council, presided over the birth of the New
7:178:13522:22:28:90:460:473:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Economics as a practical policy” (Time Magazine, 1965, p. 67A). Heller said:
7:179:13598:28:22:117:495:445:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:The promise of modern economic policy, managed with an eye to maintain-
7:180:13669:22:22:117:495:423:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:ing prosperity, subduing inflation, and raising the quality of life, is indeed great.
7:181:13754:22:23:117:495:401:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:And although we have made no startling conceptual breakthroughs in economics
7:182:13830:23:22:117:494:378:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:in recent years, wehave, more effectively than ever before, harnessed the ex-
7:183:13907:22:22:117:495:356:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:isting economics—the economics that has been taught in the nation’s college
7:184:13982:22:22:117:495:334:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:classrooms for some twenty years—to the purposes of prosperity, stability, and
7:185:14060:22:28:117:380:312:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:growth. (Heller, 1966, p. 116, emphasis in the original)
7:186:14116:28:22:106:521:284:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:A key aspect of the New Economics was a heightened focus on achieving a desired
7:187:14195:22:22:89:522:262:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f1:levelof economic activity, as measured by the unemployment rate or the level of GDP,
7:188:14279:22:23:89:521:240:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:rather than the less demanding goal of economic expansion. This focus on achieving the
7:189:14365:23:22:90:522:217:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:economy’s potential level of activity necessitated the measurement of potential output and
7:190:14455:22:22:89:521:195:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the unemployment rate corresponding to full employment. Arthur Okun, Chairman of the
7:191:14539:22:22:90:522:173:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:CEA in the late 1960s, later summarized the implications of the new strategy for economic
7:192:14628:22:28:89:170:151:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:policy as follows:
7:193:14646:28:22:117:495:123:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:The revised strategy emphasized, as the standard for judging economic perfor-
7:194:14723:22:22:117:495:101:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:mance, whether the economy was living up to its potential rather than merely
7:195:14799:22:0:117:495:79:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:whether it was advancing. Ideally, total demand should be in balance with the
8:196:14877:0:22:117:495:694:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:nation’s supply capabilities. When the balance is achieved, there is neither the
8:197:14957:22:22:117:495:672:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:waste of idle resources nor the strain of inflationary pressure. The nation is then
8:198:15040:22:31:117:406:650:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:actually producing its potential output. (Okun, 1970, p. 40)
8:199:15100:31:22:89:521:619:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Okun explained that the New Economics reflected a “shift in emphasis from the achievement
8:200:15189:22:22:90:522:597:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:of expansion to the realization of potential” (p. 41) and explained how this implied greater
8:201:15281:22:31:89:164:575:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:policy activism:
8:202:15297:31:23:117:495:544:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:[T]he focus on the gap between potential and actual output provided a new
8:203:15370:23:22:117:495:521:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:scale for the evaluation of economic performance, replacing the dichotomized
8:204:15446:22:22:117:495:499:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:business cycle standard which viewed expansion as satisfactory and recession
8:205:15522:22:22:117:495:477:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:as unsatisfactory. This new scale of evaluation, in turn, led to greater activism
8:206:15603:22:22:117:495:455:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:in economic policy: As long as the economy was not realizing its potential,
8:207:15678:22:22:117:495:433:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:improvement was needed and government had a responsibility to promote it.
8:208:15751:22:31:117:150:411:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:(p. 41)
8:209:15758:31:22:106:521:380:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:The shift in emphasis towards more explicit targets for employment and the level of eco-
8:210:15846:22:23:89:521:358:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:nomic activity was not intended to downplay the need to preserve price stability. The twin
8:211:15936:23:22:90:522:335:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:policy objectives of full employment and price stability were stressed repeatedly, starting
8:212:16027:22:22:89:521:313:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:with the very first study that provided the quantitative definitions of full employment that
8:213:16119:22:22:90:522:291:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:would shape policy throughout the 1960s: “The full employment goal must be understood
8:214:16204:22:22:89:495:269:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:as striving for maximum production without inflation pressure” (Okun, 1962, p. 82).
8:215:16287:22:22:106:521:247:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:The New Economics also emphasized the importance of monetary policy in achieving
8:216:16367:22:22:89:521:225:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:these goals.  Indeed, the essence of monetary policy was seen in a rather conventional
8:217:16453:22:22:90:521:203:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f7:manner not inconsistent with current views. According to the 1962Economic Report of the
8:218:16540:22:22:89:522:181:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f1:President: “The proper degree of ‘tightness’ or ‘easiness’ of monetary policy . . .  depend[s]
8:219:16634:22:23:89:521:159:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:on the state of the domestic economy, on the fiscal policies of the Government, and on
8:220:16720:23:22:90:522:136:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the international economic position. When the economy is in recession or beset by high
8:221:16806:22:22:89:521:114:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:unemployment and excess capacity, monetary policy should clearly be expansionary. . . .
8:222:16893:22:0:90:522:92:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:When demand is threatening to outrun the economy’s production potential, monetary policy
9:223:16982:0:22:90:522:694:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:should be restrictive” (Council of Economic Advisers, 1962, p. 85). As this quote makes
9:224:17069:22:22:89:503:672:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:clear, such a policy depends crucially on measuring the economy’s capacity accurately.
9:225:17155:22:22:106:521:650:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:The critical test for the New Economics would begin in 1965, when the economy was
9:226:17236:22:22:89:521:628:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:nearing what was perceived at the time to be full employment. The apparent success of
9:227:17321:22:22:90:522:606:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:economic policy up to that point was the topic of the cover story of the December 1965
9:228:17407:22:23:89:521:584:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f1:Timemagazine.  The story noted that “[e]conomists have descended in force from their
9:229:17491:23:22:89:521:561:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:ivory towers and now sit confidently at the elbow of almost every important leader in
9:230:17576:22:22:90:522:539:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Government and business, where they are increasingly called upon to forecast, plan and
9:231:17662:22:22:89:521:517:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:decide” (p. 65). Indeed, Okun later remarked, “The high-water mark of the economists
9:232:17746:22:22:90:440:495:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:prestige in Washington was probably reached late in 1965” (1970, p. 59).
9:233:17818:22:22:106:521:473:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Although the New Economics held sway at the CEA and at many academic institutions,
9:234:17900:22:22:89:521:451:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Federal Reserve Chairman Martin remained skeptical that policymakers would ever possess
9:235:17987:22:22:90:522:429:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the precise knowledge of the economy demanded by the policies of the New Economics.
9:236:18070:22:22:89:521:407:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Although Martin’s attitude was interpreted by some as a mistrust of economists, it would
9:237:18158:22:23:90:522:385:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:be more accurate to describe his views as reflecting a mistrust of the fine-tuning approach
9:238:18249:23:22:89:521:362:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:advocated by some economists who were gaining influence at the time. As Sherman Maisel,
9:239:18336:22:22:90:522:340:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:an economist who joined the Board of Governors in 1965, later recounted: “The press
9:240:18419:22:22:89:521:318:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:frequently reported Martin’s dismay over the number of economists appointed to the Board.
9:241:18508:22:22:90:522:296:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:He felt that the economy was too complex to explain in detail; intuition would be lost and
9:242:18598:22:22:89:521:274:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:false leads followed if too much stress were put on measurement” (Maisel 1973, p. 114).
9:243:18685:22:22:90:522:252:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Nonetheless, by 1965, the center of gravity at the Federal Reserve was shifting away from
9:244:18774:22:22:89:521:230:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:what we would describe as Martin’s robust policy approach toward a fine-tuning approach
9:245:18861:22:23:90:490:208:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:that sought to achieve a quantitative full-employment goal as well as price stability.
9:246:18947:23:22:106:521:185:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:By July 1965 the unemployment rate had fallen to about 4-1/2 percent and the balance of
9:247:19034:22:22:89:521:163:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:payments was deteriorating. Martin believed that policy needed to be tightened to restrain
9:248:19124:22:22:90:522:141:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:inflationary pressures. During the second half of 1965, he attempted to forge a consensus
9:249:19213:22:22:89:521:119:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:at the Federal Reserve towards policy tightening. But the Council of Economic Advisers
9:250:19299:22:0:90:522:97:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:and like-minded economists at the Federal Reserve argued against such a preemptive move.
10:251:19388:0:22:90:522:694:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:In their view, a 4 percent unemployment rate corresponded to full employment. Therefore,
10:252:19476:22:22:89:521:672:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the economy was operating below its full-employment level and inflationary pressures were
10:253:19565:22:22:90:184:650:11:g_d0_f1:8:g_d0_f3:unlikely to emerge.4
10:254:19585:22:22:106:521:628:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Martin postponed proposing a policy tightening until December 1965, when, despite
10:255:19666:22:22:89:521:606:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:significant opposition from members of the Board of Governors, he felt it was no longer
10:256:19753:22:23:90:522:584:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:prudent to wait. On December 3, 1965, the Federal Reserve Board increased the discount
10:257:19839:23:22:89:521:561:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:rate from 4.0 to 4.5 percent with four members of the Board voting in favor of and three
10:258:19927:22:22:90:522:539:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:voting against the rate hike. The published announcement explained: “With slack in man-
10:259:20014:22:22:89:521:517:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:power and productive capacity now reduced to narrow proportions, with the economy closer
10:260:20102:22:22:90:522:495:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:to full potential than at any time in nearly a decade ... it was felt that excessive additions
10:261:20196:22:22:89:521:473:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:to money and credit availability in an effort to hold present levels of interest rates would
10:262:20288:22:22:90:522:451:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:spill over into further price increases. Such price rises would endanger the sustainable na-

10:265:20555:22:23:89:521:385:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:rate action “on the ground that it was at least premature in the absence of more compelling

10:268:20745:22:22:106:521:318:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:In remarks that were delivered a few days later, on December 8, Chairman Martin had
10:269:20828:22:31:89:362:296:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:an opportunity to explain his reasoning for the rate hike:
10:270:20886:31:22:117:495:265:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:The Federal Reserve, in all its actions, aims always at the same goal: to help the
10:271:20968:22:22:117:495:243:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:economy move forward at the fastest sustainable pace. We reach our destination
10:272:21046:22:22:117:494:221:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:most rapidly as well as more assuredly when we travel at maximumsafespeed—
10:273:21120:22:27:117:480:199:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:and this speed cannot be the same under all conditions and at all times. . . .
10:274:21198:27:16:117:495:172:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:To me, the effective time to act against inflationary pressures is when they are
10:275:21278:16:15:102:521:156:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:4The CEA (1962) put the unemployment rate corresponding to full employment at 4 percent. The 1962
10:276:21375:15:11:89:521:141:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f5:Economic Report of the Presidentindicated that “in the existing economic circumstances, an unemployment
10:277:21478:11:11:89:521:130:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:rate of about 4 percent is a reasonable and prudent full employment target for stabilization policy” (p. 46).
10:278:21587:11:11:90:522:119:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:Although this goal of a 4 percent unemployment rate may appear overly ambitious in retrospect, it did not
10:279:21692:11:11:89:521:108:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:appear so at the time. Indeed, many considered the 4 percent goal for the unemployment rate insufficiently
10:280:21798:11:11:90:522:97:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:ambitious. For them, 4 percent was seen to be an interim goal, with the ultimate objective being even lower
10:281:21905:11:0:89:151:86:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:unemployment.

11:283:21993:22:22:117:495:672:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:has been done.  Precautionary measures are more likely to be effective than
11:284:22068:22:22:117:495:650:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:remedial action: the old proverb that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound
11:285:22145:22:27:117:429:628:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:of cure applies to monetary policy as well as to anything else. . . .
11:286:22214:27:22:117:495:601:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:[S]o long as inflation is merely a threat rather than a reality, it is enough to
11:287:22294:22:22:117:495:579:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:prevent the pace of economic expansion from accelerating dangerously.  But
11:288:22368:22:22:117:495:557:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:once that pace has become unsustainably fast, then it becomes necessary to
11:289:22442:22:22:117:495:535:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:reduce the speed, and once such a reduction is started, there is no assurance it
11:290:22522:22:22:117:495:513:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:can be stopped in time to avoid an actual downswing (Martin, 1965, emphasis
11:291:22597:22:31:117:173:491:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:in original).
11:292:22610:31:23:106:521:460:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:The discount rate increase prompted a bruising congressional hearing the following week,
11:293:22698:23:22:89:521:437:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:on December 13-14, 1965. The hearing on “Recent Federal Reserve Action and Economic
11:294:22781:22:22:90:522:415:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Policy Coordination” (U.S. Congress, 1966) served as a forum for criticizing Chairman
11:295:22866:22:22:89:521:393:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Martin for tightening policy. It provides an invaluable glimpse into the policy debate at the
11:296:22959:22:22:90:522:371:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:time and highlights the crucial role that perceptions about full employment had acquired.
11:297:23048:22:22:89:521:349:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Martin represented the majority view and Governors Mitchell and Maisel, who opposed the
11:298:23135:22:22:90:522:327:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:tightening, represented the dissenting view at the hearing on December 13, 1965. At the
11:299:23222:22:22:89:521:305:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:hearing, it was confirmed that a crucial reason for the disagreement on the tightening was
11:300:23312:22:23:90:522:283:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:a disagreement about the risks to the inflation outlook. Furthermore, details emerged as
11:301:23400:23:22:89:521:260:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:to the assessments of the Chairman and dissenting members of the Board regarding what
11:302:23485:22:22:90:227:238:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:constituted full employment.
11:303:23513:22:22:106:521:216:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:The discussion centered on whether a 4 percent unemployment rate was the appropriate
11:304:23597:22:22:89:521:194:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:definition of full employment. Martin remarked, “As long as unemployment of manpower
11:305:23681:22:22:90:522:172:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:and plant capacity was greater than could be considered acceptable or normal, we had
11:306:23765:22:22:89:521:150:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:every reason to lean on the side of monetary stimulus.” Senator Jacob Javits asked, “Do
11:307:23852:22:22:90:522:128:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:you consider a 4 percent unemployment acceptable and normal and is that the basis for
11:308:23937:22:22:89:521:106:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:your decision?” (U.S. Congress, 1966, p. 116). Noting that this is a long-standing debate
11:309:24026:22:0:90:522:84:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:among experts, Martin replied that, although the Federal Reserve Board would want “as
12:310:24112:0:22:90:522:694:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:low a level as it is possible to have,” he did not know what the right level ought to be.
12:311:24201:22:22:89:521:672:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Responding to subsequent questions he added, “We [the Board of Governors] have never
12:312:24285:22:22:90:522:650:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:addressed ourselves to a definitive discussion of the 3 or 4 or 5 percent.” But he admitted
12:313:24376:22:22:89:521:628:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:that in making the policy decision the Board deemed that “we were approaching a state
12:314:24461:22:22:90:522:606:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:of full employment” (pp. 116-117). The unemployment rate had fallen to 4.2 percent in
12:315:24546:22:23:89:165:584:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:November 1965.
12:316:24560:23:22:106:521:561:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Those arguing against a policy tightening pointed to the fact that unemployment was
12:317:24643:22:22:89:521:539:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:still above 4 percent and therefore inflationary pressures should be absent, despite the fact
12:318:24736:22:22:90:522:517:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:that inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, had been edging up for some time.
12:319:24826:22:22:89:521:495:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:In his prepared statement at the hearing, Governor Mitchell explained that the challenge
12:320:24914:22:22:90:522:473:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:to policy at the end of 1965 was to “ease the economy onto a steady growth path at full
12:321:25001:22:22:89:521:451:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:employment,” adding, “I believe this can be done with reasonably stable prices” (United
12:322:25088:22:22:90:522:429:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:States Congress, 1966, p. 21). But, with the unemployment rate exceeding 4 percent, he
12:323:25174:22:22:89:521:407:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:disagreed that a policy tightening was necessary. “[T]he evidence on prices does not, in my
12:324:25265:22:23:90:522:385:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:view, now call for more monetary restraint than is already being applied” (p. 22). The
12:325:25351:23:22:89:521:362:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:crux of his argument evolved around the definition of full employment: “Those who regard
12:326:25439:22:22:90:522:340:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:4 percent unemployment ... as the approximate total of the frictionally unemployed ... may
12:327:25529:22:22:89:521:318:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:feel that we have achieved our employment goals and that any further progress in reducing
12:328:25618:22:22:90:522:296:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:unemployment cannot come from aggregate demand. ... I am not yet ready to agree that
12:329:25702:22:22:89:476:274:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:there is no further room for compression of the unemployment rate” (pp. 22-23).
12:330:25781:22:22:106:521:252:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Indeed, Governor Maisel argued that 4 percent may have been too high a target for the
12:331:25866:22:22:89:521:230:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:unemployment rate. He explained that he disagreed with the policy decision because he
12:332:25951:22:23:90:522:208:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:felt that policy tightening was premature. In his prepared remarks, he noted, “Raising the
12:333:26041:23:22:89:521:185:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:discount rate would be interpreted as a view by the Board that because full employment
12:334:26127:22:22:90:522:163:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:increases inflationary problems, restrictive monetary policy must be invoked at its mere
12:335:26215:22:22:89:521:141:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:approach” (p. 31). Asked about his views on full employment, in the light of the various
12:336:26303:22:22:90:522:119:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:efforts to reduce frictional unemployment he replied, “My assumption is that the retraining
12:337:26394:22:0:89:521:97:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:enables us to say that 4 percent unemployment was only an interim goal. ... As a result
13:338:26483:0:22:90:522:694:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:4 percent might have been a proper goal five years ago. ... Now we need to think of these
13:339:26572:22:22:89:521:672:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:retraining programs you have cited and see what our present goal should be. Should it be
13:340:26660:22:22:90:522:650:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:3 percent or what?” (p. 181). The view that the interim goal for unemployment could
13:341:26743:22:22:89:521:628:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:perhaps be adjusted downwards was also shared by the Council of Economic Advisers. As
13:342:26828:22:22:90:522:606:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:noted in theEconomic Report of the Presidentpublished in early 1966, “The unemployment
13:343:26914:22:23:89:521:584:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:rate has now virtually reached the interim target and is projected to fall below 4 percent
13:344:27004:23:22:90:522:561:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:in 1966. There is strong evidence that the conditions originally set for lowering the target
13:345:27096:22:22:89:521:539:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:are in fact being met, and that the economy can operate efficiently at lower unemployment
13:346:27185:22:22:90:337:517:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:rates” (Council of Economic Advisers, 1966, p. 75).
13:347:27236:22:22:106:521:495:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:This debate centered on estimates of the unemployment rate consistent with price sta-
13:348:27321:22:22:89:521:473:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:bility and the proper policy response to movements in inflation and unemployment. Im-
13:349:27406:22:22:90:522:451:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:portantly, the participants did not possess fundamentally divergent views of the inflation
13:350:27496:22:22:89:521:429:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:process. Indeed, both sides used a relatively conventional understanding of the process of
13:351:27586:22:22:90:522:407:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:inflation and the effect of “gaps” on inflation. In particular, policymakers clearly believed
13:352:27679:22:23:89:521:385:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f7:that they had the power to control inflation through monetary policy. The 1966Economic
13:353:27765:23:31:89:522:362:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f1:Report of the Presidentprovides a view of inflation that relates well to models used today:

13:355:27930:22:22:117:495:309:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:to expect that the change in the price level will depend mainly on the size of
13:356:28008:22:22:117:495:287:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the gap between capacity and actual output. The more production falls short

13:358:28162:22:22:117:495:243:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:should drop. Conversely, when demand outruns aggregate supply, the imbalance
13:359:28238:22:27:117:222:221:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:should raise prices. ...

13:361:28337:22:22:117:495:172:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:to price stability is less vulnerable to inflation” (Council of Economic Advisers,

13:364:28529:16:15:102:521:103:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:5To be sure, there are differences between the reasoning in the 1960s and modern models. One important
13:365:28631:15:0:89:521:88:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:difference is that the models of the New Economics era typically implied a long-term trade-off between infla-
14:366:28742:0:22:106:521:694:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Even when inflation got noticeably higher in the second half of the 1960s, the mistaken
14:367:28829:22:22:89:521:672:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:belief that the full-employment unemployment rate was very low continued to distort policy
14:368:28919:22:22:90:522:650:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:decisions, exacerbating inflationary pressures. Although the rise in inflation during 1966
14:369:29009:22:22:89:521:628:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:and thereafter vindicated Martin’s position, this evidence proved insufficient to stem the
14:370:29099:22:22:90:522:606:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:tide toward greater fine-tuning with an emphasis on achieving what was believed to be full
14:371:29189:22:23:89:521:584:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:employment. Later, Herbert Stein went so far as to call the belief that the natural rate of
14:372:29280:23:22:90:522:561:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:unemployment was 4 percent “the most serious error of the Nixon CEA” (Stein, 1996, p.
14:373:29365:22:22:89:521:539:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:19). As he explained, “fascinated by the idea of ‘the natural rate of unemployment,’ which
14:374:29455:22:22:90:522:517:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:we thought to be 4 percent, we thought it necessary only to let the unemployment rate rise
14:375:29545:22:22:89:521:495:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:slightly above that to hold down inflation” (pp. 19-20). The resulting policy actions would
14:376:29636:22:22:90:522:473:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:have been the “optimum feasible path,” except that they built upon a fatally flawed view
14:377:29724:22:22:89:521:451:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:of the productive capacity of the economy. Instead of restoring stability, they led to further
14:378:29818:22:22:90:191:429:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:increases in inflation.
14:379:29841:22:22:106:521:407:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:The inflation rate rose from below 2 percent in the early 1960s to over 5 percent by
14:380:29925:22:23:89:521:385:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:1970.  Figure 1 shows the four-quarter average of the U.S. inflation rate, measured by
14:381:30011:23:22:90:522:362:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the GDP price deflator, from 1955 to 2003.  (Note that throughout this paper, unless
14:382:30095:22:22:89:521:340:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:otherwise indicated, the figures show the four-quarter moving average of the inflation rate
14:383:30186:22:22:90:522:318:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:to reduce the visual clutter caused by quarterly volatility in this series.) For comparison, the
14:384:30282:22:22:89:521:296:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:horizontal line shows the 2 percent inflation target that we assume reflects the policymaker’s
14:385:30376:22:22:90:522:274:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:price stability objective for our counterfactual simulations reported in later sections. The
14:386:30468:22:22:89:521:252:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:inflation rate was around this level before the Great Inflation and returned once again to
14:387:30558:22:22:90:522:230:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:this level in the last decade of our sample. Inflation expectations became unmoored during
14:388:30648:22:23:89:521:208:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the Great Inflation (see Levin and Taylor, 2009, for further discussion of the evidence on
14:389:30738:23:22:90:522:185:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:inflation expectations) and only in the 1990s did they become anchored again.  By the
14:390:30823:22:19:89:521:163:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:beginning of the 1980s, survey measures of long-run inflation expectations had risen to over
14:391:30915:19:11:90:522:144:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:tion and unemployment, whereas modern models such as ours typically respect the natural rate hypothesis.
14:392:31019:11:11:89:521:133:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:But this difference is not key for explaining the Great Inflation in our view. As explained by Modigliani
14:393:31124:11:11:90:522:122:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:and Papademos (1975), in both types of models, there exists a rate of unemployment (the NAIRU) that is
14:394:31226:11:11:89:521:111:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:consistent with the policymaker’s definition of reasonable price stability. In our model, this corresponds to
14:395:31335:11:11:90:522:100:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:the natural rate of unemployment. What is critical is that in both types of models, misperceptions about
14:396:31439:11:0:89:518:89:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:the NAIRU (or natural rate) have inflationary consequences under the optimal control approach to policy.
15:397:31545:0:22:90:137:694:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:8 percent.
15:398:31555:22:22:106:521:672:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Under Arthur Burns, who became Fed Chairman in 1970, the Federal Reserve continued
15:399:31637:22:22:89:521:650:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the activist bent with even greater force (Hetzel, 1998, Orphanides, 2003). The high degree
15:400:31728:22:22:90:522:628:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:of confidence that economists had regarding their ability to measure the capacity of the
15:401:31816:22:22:89:521:606:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:economy and to gauge inflationary pressures is nicely illustrated by the staff briefing to the
15:402:31910:22:23:90:522:584:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Board of Governors from August 1970 presented by John Charles Partee (who become a
15:403:31992:23:22:89:521:561:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Governor in 1976): “there is substantial underutilization of resources, as evidenced by a
15:404:32081:22:22:90:522:539:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:5 per cent unemployment rate and an operating rate in manufacturing estimated at well
15:405:32166:22:22:89:521:517:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:under 80 per cent of capacity. In these circumstances, there is virtually no risk that economic
15:406:32261:22:22:90:522:495:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:recovery over the year ahead would add to the inflationary problem through stimulation of
15:407:32350:22:22:89:521:473:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:excess—or even robust—demand in product or labor markets” (Board of Governors, 1970,
15:408:32434:22:22:90:122:451:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:p. 19).
15:409:32441:22:22:106:521:429:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:In hisAnguishlecture, Burns admitted that the Federal Reserve was slow to recognize
15:410:32524:22:22:89:521:407:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the upward drift in the natural rate of unemployment, thus adding to inflation (Burns, 1979).
15:411:32617:22:23:90:522:385:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Figure 2 plots real-time estimates of the natural rate of unemployment and a retrospective
15:412:32707:23:22:89:521:362:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:measure of the natural rate equal to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates
15:413:32791:22:22:90:522:340:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:available at the time that this paper was written. The actual unemployment rate is plotted
15:414:32881:22:22:89:521:318:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:as well. The real-time series for the natural rate is taken from Orphanides and Williams
15:415:32969:22:22:90:522:296:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:(2005a), extended to include more recent data. These real-time estimates were constructed
15:416:33058:22:22:89:521:274:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:drawing on a number of sources (see Orphanides and Williams, 2002, for details). As seen in
15:417:33149:22:22:90:522:252:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the figure, differences between real-time estimates of the natural rate of unemployment and
15:418:33240:22:22:89:521:230:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:current retrospective estimates were especially large and persistent during the second half
15:419:33331:22:23:90:522:208:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:of the 1960s and the 1970s. The mean absolute difference between the real-time and current
15:420:33421:23:22:89:521:185:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:estimates was 1.2 percentage points over this period. But such natural rate “misperceptions”
15:421:33513:22:22:90:522:163:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:are not merely a historical curiosity, with the mean absolute difference between the two
15:422:33601:22:16:89:427:141:11:g_d0_f1:8:g_d0_f3:measures equaling 0.6 percentage points over the period of 1980-2003.6
15:423:33671:16:15:102:521:125:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:6Note that this measure of natural rate misperceptions does not take into account uncertainty regarding
15:424:33774:15:10:89:521:110:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:the CBO’s estimates of the natural rate. Instead, it merely measures changes in the estimates that reflect
15:425:33880:10:0:90:301:100:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:changes in methodology and the effects of new data.
16:426:33933:0:22:106:521:694:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:The overly optimistic estimates of the economy’s capacity was of particular importance
16:427:34019:22:22:89:521:672:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:in light of the high value placed on achieving full employment relative to price stability.
16:428:34110:22:22:90:522:650:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Despite the upward trend in inflation since 1965, the Federal Reserve remained focused on
16:429:34199:22:22:89:521:628:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:stabilizing real activity, with the hope that inflationary pressures would subside. At the
16:430:34289:22:22:90:522:606:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:May 1975 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Board staff argued that
16:431:34371:22:23:89:521:584:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:“there is such a large amount of slack in the economy now that real growth would have to
16:432:34459:23:22:90:522:561:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:exceed our projection by a wide margin, and for an extended period, before excess aggregate
16:433:34550:22:22:89:521:539:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:demand once again emerged as a significant problem.” (Board of Governors of the Federal

16:435:34723:22:22:89:521:495:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:that a considerably faster rate of expansion could be stimulated without having a significant
16:436:34816:22:22:90:522:473:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:effect on the rate of increase in prices–that a considerably more rapid rate of increase in
16:437:34907:22:22:89:521:451:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:real GNP would still be consistent with a further winding down of inflationary pressures”

16:439:35084:22:22:89:521:407:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:over the next few years, but bottomed out above 5 percent, well in excess of conventional
16:440:35173:22:23:90:200:385:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:views of price stability.

16:442:35283:22:22:89:521:340:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:an approach focused more on inflation stabilization only after Paul Volcker became Chair-

16:444:35458:22:22:89:521:296:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:goal of price stability, seeing this as the only way to effectively reanchor inflation expec-

16:449:35870:23:22:117:495:176:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:ally been more preoccupied with the possibility of near-term weakness in eco-

16:451:36027:22:22:117:495:132:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:future inflation. To some degree, that has been true even during the long pe-
16:452:36104:22:22:117:495:110:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:riod of expansion since 1975. As a consequence, fiscal and monetary policies
16:453:36180:22:0:117:495:88:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:alike too often have been prematurely or excessively stimulative or insufficiently
17:454:36264:0:22:117:495:694:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:restrictive. The result has been our now chronic inflationary problem, with a
17:455:36341:22:22:117:495:672:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:growing conviction on the part of many that this process is likely to continue.

17:457:36502:27:22:117:495:623:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:The broad objective of policy must be to break that ominous pattern. That

17:459:36653:22:22:117:495:579:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:national priority. Success will require that policy be consistently and persistently
17:460:36737:22:22:117:495:557:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:oriented to that end. Vacillation and procrastination, out of fears of recession
17:461:36817:22:22:117:495:535:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:or otherwise, would run grave risks. Amid the present uncertainties, stimulative
17:462:36897:22:22:117:495:513:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:policies could well be misdirected in the short run. More importantly, far from

17:466:37141:34:33:89:413:408:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:3  An Estimated Model of the U.S. Economy
17:467:37182:33:23:90:522:375:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:We now turn to the evaluation of alternative monetary policy strategies.  We use coun-
17:468:37268:23:22:89:521:352:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:terfactual simulations of the estimated quarterly model of the U.S. economy described in
17:469:37356:22:22:90:522:330:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Orphanides and Williams (2008). The specification of the model is motivated by the recent
17:470:37445:22:22:89:521:308:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:literature on micro-founded models incorporating some inertia in inflation and output (see
17:471:37535:22:22:90:522:286:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Woodford, 2003, for a fuller discussion). The main difference from other monetary policy
17:472:37623:22:22:89:521:264:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:models is that the unemployment gap is substituted for the output gap in the model to
17:473:37708:22:22:90:522:242:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:facilitate estimation using real-time data. The two concepts are closely related in practice
17:474:37800:22:29:89:513:220:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:by Okun’s law, and the key properties of the model are largely unaffected by this choice.
17:475:37889:29:30:90:185:191:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:3.1  The Model
17:476:37903:30:22:89:521:161:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:The structural model consists of two equations that describe the behavior of the unemploy-
17:477:37993:22:22:90:522:139:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:ment rate and the inflation rate and equations describing the time-series properties of the
17:478:38084:22:22:89:521:117:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:exogenous shocks. To close the model, the short-term interest rate is set by the central
17:479:38172:22:0:90:274:95:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:bank, as described in the next section.
18:480:38213:0:22:106:521:694:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:The “IS curve” equation is motivated by the Euler equation for consumption with ad-
18:481:38296:22:33:89:203:672:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:justment costs or habit:

18:484:38401:29:22:89:522:577:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Equation (1) relates the unemployment rate,ut, to the unemployment rate expected in the
18:485:38488:22:22:89:521:555:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:next period, one lag of the unemployment rate, and the difference between the expected
18:486:38574:22:22:90:522:533:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:ex ante real interest rate—equal to the difference between the expected nominal short-
18:487:38660:22:22:89:521:511:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:term interest rate,iet, and the expected inflation rate in the following period,πet+1—and
18:488:38749:22:22:89:522:489:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the natural rate of interest,r∗. The unemployment rate is subject to a shock,vt, that is
18:489:38837:22:22:89:521:467:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:assumed to follow an AR(1) process with innovation varianceσ2ev. The AR(1) specification
18:490:38925:22:23:89:521:445:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:for the shock is based on the evidence of serial correlation in the residuals of the estimated
18:491:39019:23:22:90:297:422:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:unemployment equation, as discussed later.
18:492:39061:22:22:106:521:400:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:The “Phillips curve” equation is motivated by the New Keynesian Phillips curve with
18:493:39144:22:33:89:142:378:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:indexation:
18:494:39155:33:33:149:522:345:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f1:πt=φππet+1+ (1−φπ)πt−1+απ(ut−u∗t) +eπ,t,  eπ∼N(0, σ2eπ).(3)

18:497:39386:22:22:90:522:268:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:during quartertto lagged inflation, expected future inflation , and the difference between
18:498:39476:22:22:89:522:246:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the unemployment rate,ut, and the natural rate of unemployment,u∗t, during the current
18:499:39562:22:23:89:521:224:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:quarter. The parameterφπmeasures the importance of expected inflation on the determi-
18:500:39647:23:22:89:522:201:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:nation of inflation, while (1−φπ) captures the effects of inflation indexation. The “markup”
18:501:39739:22:22:89:440:179:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:shock,eπ,t, is assumed to be a white noise disturbance with varianceσ2eπ.
18:502:39812:22:22:106:521:157:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:We model the low frequency behavior of the natural rate of unemployment as an exoge-

19:505:40005:0:22:90:522:694:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:We assume this process is stationary based on the finding using the standard augmented

19:507:40182:22:29:90:270:650:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:over 1950–2003 at the 5 percent level.
19:508:40220:29:29:89:322:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:3.2  Model Estimation and Calibration
19:509:40257:29:23:90:522:592:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:The IS curve and Phillips curve equations are estimated using forecasts from the Survey of
19:510:40347:23:22:89:521:569:11:g_d0_f1:8:g_d0_f3:Professional Forecasters (SPF) as proxies for the expectations that appear in the equations.7
19:511:40440:22:22:89:521:547:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Expectations are assumed to be formed in the previous quarter; that is, the expectations
19:512:40528:22:22:90:522:525:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:affecting inflation and unemployment in periodtare those collected in quartert−1. This
19:513:40614:22:22:89:521:503:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:matches the informational structure in many theoretical models (see Woodford, 2003, and
19:514:40701:22:22:90:522:481:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Giannoni and Woodford, 2005). To match the inflation and unemployment data as closely
19:515:40786:22:22:89:521:459:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:as possible with these forecasts, the first announced estimates of these series are used. These
19:516:40881:22:22:90:522:437:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:are obtained from the Real-Time Dataset for Macroeconomists maintained by the Federal
19:517:40966:22:23:89:521:415:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. In estimating the inflation equation, the Congressional Bud-
19:518:41056:23:22:90:522:392:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:get Office (2001) estimates of the natural rate of unemployment are used as proxies for the
19:519:41147:22:22:89:521:370:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:true values over time. The data sample used for estimating the model runs from 1968:Q4
19:520:41233:22:22:90:440:348:11:g_d0_f1:8:g_d0_f3:to 2004:Q2, where the starting date is the first sample point in the SPF.8
19:521:41307:22:22:106:521:326:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Estimation results are reported in equations (5) through (7), with standard errors in-
19:522:41393:22:22:89:521:304:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:dicated in parentheses. The IS curve equation is estimated using least squares with AR(1)
19:523:41482:22:22:90:522:282:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:residuals. Unrestricted estimation of the IS curve equation yields a point estimate forφuof
19:524:41573:22:22:89:521:260:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:0.39, with a standard error of 0.15. This estimate is below the lower bound of 0.5 implied
19:525:41663:22:22:90:521:238:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:by theory; however, the null hypothesis of a value of 0.5 is not rejected by the data.9Thus
19:526:41754:22:16:89:522:216:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the restrictionφu= 0.5 is imposed in estimating the remaining parameters of the equation.
19:527:41843:16:15:102:521:200:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:7Specifically, the mean forecasts of the unemployment rate and the three-month Treasury bill rate are
19:528:41944:15:11:89:521:185:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:used. The inflation forecasts are constructed using the annualized log difference of the GNP or GDP price
19:529:42049:11:11:90:522:174:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:deflator, taken from the reported forecasts of real and nominal GNP or GDP. The survey is currently
19:530:42148:11:11:89:521:163:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. See Croushore (1993) and Croushore and Stark
19:531:42248:11:7:90:273:152:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:(2001) for details on the survey methodology.
19:532:42293:7:15:102:521:145:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:8Expectations for the Treasury bill rate were not collected in the first few years of the sample. When
19:533:42395:15:11:89:521:130:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:these are not available, the expectations of the three-month rate implied by the slope of the term structure
19:534:42503:11:7:90:267:119:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:under the expectations hypothesis are used.
19:535:42546:7:15:102:521:112:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:9This finding is consistent with the results reported in Giannoni and Woodford (2005) who, in a similar
19:536:42649:15:0:89:479:97:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:model, find that the corresponding coefficient is constrained to be at its theoretical lower bound.
20:537:42750:0:22:90:522:694:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Note that the estimated equation also includes a constant term (not shown) that provides
20:538:42838:22:22:89:461:672:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:an estimate of the natural real interest rate, which is assumed to be constant:

20:548:43077:33:22:106:521:532:11:g_d0_f1:8:g_d0_f9:Unrestricted estimation of the Phillips curve equation yields a point estimate forφπ
20:549:43161:22:22:89:522:510:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:of 0.51, just barely above the lower bound implied by theory.10For symmetry with the
20:550:43245:22:22:89:522:488:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:treatment of the IS curve, the restrictionφπ= 0.5 is imposed and the remaining parameters
20:551:43334:22:23:89:521:466:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:are estimated using ordinary least squares. The estimated residuals for this equation show
20:552:43424:23:22:90:522:443:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:no signs of serial correlation in the price equation, consistent with the assumption of the
20:553:43515:22:22:89:121:421:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:model.
20:554:43521:22:22:106:521:399:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:We do not estimate the model of the natural rate of unemployment; instead, we set
20:555:43602:22:22:89:521:377:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the autocorrelation parameter,ρr∗, to 0.99 and set the unconditional mean to the sample
20:556:43689:22:34:89:255:355:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:average of the unemployment rate.
20:557:43722:34:33:90:232:321:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:4  Monetary Policy
20:558:43740:33:22:89:521:288:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:We focus on two alternative approaches to monetary policy. The first is the optimal control
20:559:43831:22:23:90:522:266:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:approach. The second is a simple monetary policy that is closely related to nominal income
20:560:43921:23:22:89:521:243:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:growth targeting. In both cases, the policy instrument is the nominal short-term interest
20:561:44010:22:22:90:522:221:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:rate. We assume that the central bank observes all variables from previous periods when
20:562:44097:22:22:89:521:199:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:making the current-period policy decision.  We further assume that policy is conducted
20:563:44183:22:14:90:184:177:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:under commitment.
20:564:44200:14:14:98:521:163:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:10For comparison, Giannoni and Woodford (2005) find that the corresponding coefficient is constrained
20:565:44301:14:0:89:260:149:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:to be at its theoretical lower bound of 0.5.
21:566:44347:0:29:90:320:694:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:4.1  Optimal Control Monetary Policy
21:567:44383:29:22:89:521:665:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:It is important to make clear from the start that we make no claim that the Federal Reserve
21:568:44474:22:22:90:522:643:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:set policy according to the mechanical optimal control algorithms we describe in this paper
21:569:44565:22:22:89:521:621:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:during the 1960s and 1970s. Indeed, the development of formal quantitative monetary policy
21:570:44655:22:22:90:522:599:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:evaluation exercises was still in its infancy at that time. The Federal Reserve Board staff
21:571:44746:22:23:89:521:577:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:first completed an ambitious project using optimal control in the mid-1970s (Kalchbrenner
21:572:44835:23:22:90:522:554:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:and Tinsley, 1976). Although Federal Reserve Governor Henry Wallich (1976) stated that
21:573:44921:22:22:89:521:532:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:“[t]he use of optimal control techniques in planning for economic stabilization is approaching
21:574:45015:22:22:90:522:510:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the policy stage,” in fact, this project was never integrated with the policy process at the
21:575:45107:22:22:89:522:488:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Federal Reserve during this period.11We would argue that the optimal control approach
21:576:45192:22:22:89:521:466:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:resembles the spirit of fine-tuning practiced by policymakers at that time. In any case, our
21:577:45284:22:22:90:522:444:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:goal is to evaluate the performance of such an optimal control strategy under the conditions
21:578:45376:22:22:89:261:422:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:that existed in the 1960s and 1970s.
21:579:45412:22:23:106:521:400:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:The optimal control approach stipulates that the policy instrument is chosen to minimize
21:580:45500:23:22:89:521:377:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the central bank’s loss function given the constraints imposed by the central bank’s model.
21:581:45591:22:22:90:522:355:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:We construct the optimal control policy rule, as is typical in the literature, assuming that
21:582:45683:22:22:89:521:333:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the policymaker knows the true parameters of the structural model and assumes all agents
21:583:45771:22:22:90:522:311:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:use rational expectations.  The parameters of the optimal control policy are computed
21:584:45856:22:22:89:522:289:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:assuming the central bank knows the natural rate of unemployment.12Note that for the
21:585:45940:22:22:89:521:267:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:optimal control policy, as well as the simple monetary policy rules described later, we use
21:586:46031:22:22:90:522:245:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:lagged information in the determination of the interest rate, reflecting the lagged release of
21:587:46125:22:22:89:113:223:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:data.
21:588:46130:22:23:106:521:201:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:We assume that the central bank’s objective is to minimize a loss equal to the weighted
21:589:46217:23:22:89:521:178:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:sum of the unconditional variances of the inflation rate, the difference between the unem-
21:590:46307:22:16:90:522:156:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:ployment rate and the natural rate of unemployment, and the first-difference of the nominal
21:591:46398:16:14:98:521:140:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:11Nonetheless, it is worth noting that the loss function in Kalchbrenner and Tinsley (1976) penalized
21:592:46499:14:11:89:521:126:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:an unemployment rate above 4.8 percent and an inflation rate above 2.5 percent.  This target for the
21:593:46599:11:11:90:522:115:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:unemployment rate is consistent with our analysis of real-time estimates of the natural rate of unemployment
21:594:46707:11:11:89:521:104:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:used in the model simulations in this paper. The 2.5 percent inflation target is somewhat higher than the 2
21:595:46814:11:7:90:334:93:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:percent inflation target we assume in our model simulations.

22:599:47016:32:22:89:521:629:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:whereV ar(x) denotes the unconditional variance of variablex. We assume an inflation
22:600:47100:22:22:89:521:607:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:target of 2 percent. In the following, we consider different values of the parameters of the
22:601:47192:22:23:90:160:585:11:g_d0_f1:8:g_d0_f3:loss function.13
22:602:47208:23:22:106:521:562:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:The optimal control policy is described by a set of equations that describes the first-
22:603:47295:22:22:89:521:540:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:order optimality condition for monetary policy and the behavior of the Lagrange multipliers
22:604:47386:22:22:90:522:518:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:associated with the constraints on the optimization problem implied by the structural equa-
22:605:47477:22:22:89:521:496:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:tions of the model economy. Because we are interested in describing the setting of interest
22:606:47568:22:22:90:522:474:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:rates in a potentially misspecified model, it is useful to represent the optimal control policy
22:607:47663:22:22:89:521:452:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:by an equation that relates the policy instrument to macroeconomic variables, rather than
22:608:47752:22:22:90:522:430:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:in terms of Lagrange multipliers that are model specific. There are infinitely many such
22:609:47840:22:23:89:521:408:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:representations. In the following, we focus on one representation of the optimal control
22:610:47928:23:22:90:522:385:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:policy, denoted as the “OC” policy. In the OC policy, the current interest rate depends
22:611:48015:22:22:89:521:363:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:on three lags of the inflation rate, the difference between the unemployment rate and the
22:612:48104:22:22:90:522:341:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:central bank’s estimate of the natural rate of unemployment, and the difference between the
22:613:48195:22:22:89:521:319:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:nominal interest rate and the natural rate of interest. The OC representation yields a de-
22:614:48285:22:22:90:522:297:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:terminate rational expectations equilibrium in our model. We find that including three lags
22:615:48376:22:22:89:521:275:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:of these variables is sufficient to very closely mimic the optimal control outcome assuming
22:616:48467:22:22:90:387:253:11:g_d0_f1:8:g_d0_f3:the central bank observes the natural rate of unemployment.14
22:617:48528:22:22:106:521:231:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:As discussed previously, during much of the 1960s and 1970s, policymakers placed a
22:618:48610:22:23:89:521:209:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:great deal of weight on the stabilization of real activity. We represent such preferences with
22:619:48704:23:32:90:522:186:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:values ofλ= 16 andν= 1. In that case, the OC policy is given by the following equation:
22:620:48791:32:17:225:522:154:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f1:it= 1.16it−1−0.05it−2−0.21it−3(9)
22:621:48824:17:14:98:521:137:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:13Based on an Okun’s law type relationship, the variance of the unemployment gap is about one-fourth
22:622:48924:14:11:89:521:123:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:that of the output gap, so a choice ofλ= 4 corresponds to equal weights on inflation and output gap
22:623:49023:11:8:89:132:112:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:variability.
22:624:49035:8:14:98:521:104:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:14In deriving the OC policy, we use the innovation processes from the estimated model and set the
22:625:49132:14:11:89:521:90:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:innovation standard deviation of the natural rate of unemployment to 0.07. See Orphanides and Williams

23:631:49508:22:22:106:521:593:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:In the following, we also examine the performance of the OC policy derived for alter-
23:632:49593:22:23:89:521:571:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:native values ofλ. The resulting OC policy forλ= 4 andν= 1 is given by the following
23:633:49677:23:22:89:133:548:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:equation:

23:637:49807:28:23:89:522:441:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Compared to the OC policy derived withλ= 16, this policy is characterized by a stronger
23:638:49894:23:22:89:521:418:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:response to inflation and a much smaller response to the unemployment rate. Finally, the
23:639:49982:22:33:90:332:396:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:OC policy derived forλ= 0 andν= 1 is given by:
23:640:50028:33:33:225:521:363:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f1:it= 1.12it−1+ 0.13it−2−0.34it−3(11)

23:643:50148:29:22:89:521:273:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:As expected, this policy is characterized by a stronger response to inflation and a much
23:644:50236:22:29:90:480:251:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:smaller response to the unemployment rate than the OC policy derived forλ= 4.

23:646:50353:29:23:90:522:193:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:As seen in these equations, a key input into the setting of OC policies is the central bank’s
23:647:50446:23:22:89:521:170:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:estimate of the natural rate of unemployment. In deriving the OC policy, we assume that the
23:648:50537:22:22:90:522:148:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:central bank knows the true structure of the economy, including the value of the natural
23:649:50625:22:22:89:521:126:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:rate of unemployment.  In the model simulations, however, we also examine alternative
23:650:50710:22:22:90:522:104:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:assumptions regarding the central bank’s knowledge of the natural rate. One alternative
23:651:50797:22:0:89:521:82:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:is that the central bank’s estimates of the natural rate follow the historical pattern of the
24:652:50892:0:22:90:522:694:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:real-time estimates reported in Figure 2. We refer to this case as “historical natural rate
24:653:50983:22:22:89:521:672:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:misperceptions.” A second alternative is that the central bank estimates the natural rate
24:654:51072:22:22:90:522:650:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:based on the Kalman filter applied to the Phillips curve equation for inflation. We refer to
24:655:51164:22:22:89:521:628:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:this case as “Kalman filter estimates.” In each case, we assume that the true values of the
24:656:51255:22:22:90:490:606:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:natural rate of unemployment follow the current CBO estimates shown in Figure 2.
24:657:51335:22:23:106:521:584:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:In the case of Kalman filter estimation of the natural rate of unemployment, we as-
24:658:51418:23:22:89:521:561:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:sume that the central bank uses an appropriate Kalman filter consistent with the data.
24:659:51504:22:22:90:522:539:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:In particular, the central bank’s real-time Kalman filter estimate of the natural rate of
24:660:51593:22:31:89:235:517:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:unemployment, ˆu∗t, is given by
24:661:51624:31:31:231:521:486:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:ˆu∗t=a1ˆu∗t−1+a2(u∗t−eπ,t/απ),(12)
24:662:51658:31:22:89:522:455:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:wherea1anda2are the Kalman gain parameters. The term within the parentheses is the
24:663:51740:22:22:89:521:433:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:current-period “shock” to inflation that incorporates the effects of the transitory inflation
24:664:51833:22:22:90:522:411:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:disturbance and the deviation of the natural rate of unemployment from its unconditional
24:665:51921:22:22:89:521:389:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:mean, scaled in units of the unemployment rate. Note that the central bank only observes
24:666:52009:22:22:90:412:367:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:this “surprise” and not the decomposition into its two components.
24:667:52075:22:22:106:521:345:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:The optimal values of the gain parameters depend on the variances of the various shocks
24:668:52162:22:23:89:521:323:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:in the model. Based on a calibrated Kalman filter model, we assume that the central bank
24:669:52250:23:22:90:521:300:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:uses the following values:a1= 0.982 anda2= 0.008 (see Orphanides and Williams, 2009,
24:670:52334:22:22:89:521:278:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:for the derivation of these values). We assume that the central bank starts the simulation
24:671:52424:22:22:90:522:256:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:with the value of 4 percent, consistent with the evidence from real-time estimates reported
24:672:52515:22:34:89:122:234:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:earlier.

24:674:52561:33:22:89:521:167:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:We assume that private agents and, in some cases, the central bank form expectations
24:675:52645:22:22:90:522:145:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:using an estimated reduced-form forecasting model. Specifically, following Orphanides and
24:676:52734:22:22:89:521:123:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Williams (2005b), we posit that private agents engage in perpetual learning, that is, they
24:677:52824:22:22:90:522:101:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:reestimate their forecasting model using a constant-gain least squares algorithm that weights
24:678:52917:22:0:89:521:79:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:recent data more heavily than past data. (See Sargent, 1999; Cogley and Sargent, 2001; and
25:679:53009:0:22:90:522:694:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Evans and Honkapohja, 2001 for related treatments of learning.) This approach to modeling
25:680:53098:22:22:89:521:672:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:learning allows for the possible presence of time variation in the economy, including the
25:681:53187:22:22:90:522:650:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:natural rates of interest and unemployment.  It also implies that agents’ estimates are
25:682:53274:22:22:89:521:628:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:always subject to sampling variation, that is, the estimates do not eventually converge to
25:683:53364:22:22:90:148:606:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:fixed values.
25:684:53377:22:23:106:521:584:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Private agents forecast inflation, the unemployment rate, and the short-term interest
25:685:53462:23:22:89:521:561:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:rate using an unrestricted vector autoregression (VAR) model containing three lags of these
25:686:53553:22:22:90:522:539:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:three variables and a constant. Note that we assume that private agents do not observe or
25:687:53642:22:22:89:521:517:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:estimate the natural rate of unemployment directly in forming expectations. The effects of
25:688:53732:22:22:90:522:495:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:time variation in the natural rate on forecasts are reflected in the forecasting VAR by the
25:689:53823:22:22:89:521:473:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:lags of the interest rate, inflation rate, and unemployment rate. As discussed in Orphanides
25:690:53915:22:22:90:522:451:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:and Williams (2008), this VAR forecasting model provides accurate forecasts in model
25:691:53999:22:22:89:146:429:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:simulations.
25:692:54011:22:22:106:521:407:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:At the end of each period, agents update their estimates of their forecasting model
25:693:54094:22:23:89:522:385:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:using data through the current period. LetYtdenote the 1×3 vector consisting of the
25:694:54177:23:22:89:521:362:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:inflation rate, the unemployment rate, and the interest rate, each measured at timet:
25:695:54262:22:22:89:522:340:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f1:Yt= (πt, ut, it). Further, letXtbe the 10×1 vector of regressors in the forecast model:
25:696:54349:22:22:89:521:318:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f1:Xt= (1, πt−1, ut−1, it−1, . . . , πt−3, ut−3, it−3). Also, letctbe the 10×3 vector of coefficients
25:697:54447:22:22:89:521:296:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:of the forecasting model. Using data through periodt, the coefficients of the forecasting
25:698:54536:22:30:89:327:274:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:model can be written in recursive form as follows:
25:699:54586:30:25:218:521:244:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f1:ct=ct−1+κR−1tXt(Yt−X′tct−1),(13)
25:700:54618:25:30:214:521:219:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f1:Rt=Rt−1+κ(XtX′t−Rt−1),(14)
25:701:54644:30:22:89:521:189:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:whereκis the gain. Agents construct the multiperiod forecasts that appear in the inflation
25:702:54734:22:22:89:420:167:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:and unemployment equations in the model using the estimated VAR.
25:703:54798:22:22:106:521:145:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:The matrixRtmay not be full rank at times.  To circumvent this problem, in each
25:704:54877:22:22:89:521:123:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:period of the model simulations, we check the rank ofRt. If it is less than full rank, we
25:705:54966:22:22:89:521:101:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:assume that agents apply a standard Ridge regression (Hoerl and Kennard, 1970), where
25:706:55051:22:0:90:458:79:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f1:Rtis replaced byRt+ 0.00001∗I(10) andI(10) is a 10×10 identity matrix.
26:707:55123:0:29:90:299:694:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:5.1  Calibrating the Learning Rate
26:708:55157:29:22:89:521:665:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:A key parameter in the learning model is the private-agent updating parameter,κ. Esti-
26:709:55243:22:22:89:521:643:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:mates of this parameter tend to be imprecise and sensitive to model specification, but tend
26:710:55334:22:34:90:492:621:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:to lie between 0 and 0.04.15We take 0.02 to be a reasonable benchmark value forκ.
26:711:55415:34:33:89:245:587:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:6  Model Simulations
26:712:55435:33:22:90:522:554:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:We examine a set of alternative counterfactual simulations to investigate the implications
26:713:55525:22:22:89:521:532:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:of alternative monetary policy frameworks on macroeconomic developments over the past
26:714:55610:22:23:90:522:510:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:40 years. We start our simulations in the first quarter of 1966, which corresponds to what
26:715:55700:23:22:89:521:487:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:we and many observers consider to be the beginning of the Great Inflation in the United
26:716:55787:22:29:90:122:465:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:States.
26:717:55794:29:29:89:223:436:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:6.1  Initial Conditions
26:718:55817:29:22:90:522:407:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:The state variables of the model economy with learning are as follows: the current and
26:719:55903:22:22:89:521:385:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:lagged values of the inflation rate, the federal funds rate, the unemployment rate, the true
26:720:55995:22:22:90:522:363:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:natural rate of unemployment, the real-time estimate of the natural rate, the shocks to the
26:721:56086:22:22:89:521:341:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:structural equations, and the matricesCandRfor the forecasting model. We initialize the
26:722:56173:22:22:89:521:319:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f1:CandRmatrices using the values implied by the reduced-form solution of the model under
26:723:56259:22:22:89:521:297:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:rational expectations for the stipulated monetary policy rule. In so doing, we are implicitly
26:724:56352:22:22:90:522:275:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:assuming that the initial conditions for the agents’ learning model are consistent with the
26:725:56443:22:23:89:521:253:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:policy rule in place. That is, we assume that at the start of the simulation, expectations are
26:726:56537:23:22:90:522:230:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:well aligned with the monetary policy regime under consideration. Over time, expectations
26:727:56626:22:22:89:521:208:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:then evolve as described above. This assumption implies that the initial conditions for these
26:728:56719:22:22:90:522:186:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:state variables are different across the counterfactual simulations. As a result, the simulated
26:729:56814:22:22:89:390:164:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:paths will often differ significantly from the historical patterns.
26:730:56881:22:22:106:521:142:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:To compute the history of equation residuals, we first compute the implied forecasts
26:731:56965:22:22:89:521:120:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:from our forecasting model of inflation, the unemployment rate, and the federal funds rate
26:732:57055:22:15:90:522:98:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:over the period 1966–2003.  We treat the forecasts generated by the learning model as
26:733:57140:15:0:98:517:83:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:15See Sheridan (2003), Orphanides and Williams (2005a), Branch and Evans (2006), and Milani (2007).
27:734:57241:0:22:90:522:694:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the true data for agents’ expectations and then compute tracking residuals, that is, the
27:735:57329:22:22:89:521:672:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:values of the historical residuals for the equations for the unemployment rate, the inflation
27:736:57422:22:22:90:522:650:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:rate, and the natural rate of unemployment. Thus, given these residuals and the historical
27:737:57512:22:22:89:521:628:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:path for the nominal interest rate, the model’s predictions will exactly match the historical
27:738:57605:22:22:90:522:606:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:paths for all endogenous variables. We then conduct counterfactual experiments in which
27:739:57692:22:23:89:521:584:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:we modify assumptions regarding monetary policy, but do not change the paths for the
27:740:57776:23:22:90:522:561:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:equation residuals for unemployment, inflation, and the natural rate of unemployment,
27:741:57861:22:22:89:521:539:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:which we assume are exogenous. Each counterfactual simulation starts in the first quarter
27:742:57950:22:34:90:314:517:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:of 1966 and ends in the fourth quarter of 2003.

27:744:58039:33:22:90:522:450:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:If the Federal Reserve had accurate estimates of the natural rate of unemployment, then
27:745:58126:22:22:89:521:428:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the OC policy derived assuming a moderately large weight on unemployment stabilization
27:746:58212:22:22:90:522:406:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:would have avoided the Great Inflation. Figure 3 shows the simulated paths for key variables
27:747:58304:22:23:89:521:384:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:assuming that the Fed follows the OC policy derived underλ= 16 andν= 1.  The
27:748:58380:23:22:89:521:361:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:left column of the figure shows the outcomes assuming the Fed knew the true values of
27:749:58465:22:22:90:522:339:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the natural rate of unemployment.  Inflation would have been somewhat volatile during
27:750:58550:22:22:89:521:317:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the 1970s, reflecting the effects of the large shocks hitting the economy at the time, but
27:751:58640:22:22:90:522:295:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the deviation of the four-quarter inflation rate from target would not have exceeded three
27:752:58730:22:22:89:268:273:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:percentage points during that period.
27:753:58767:22:22:106:521:251:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:In the absence of natural rate misperceptions, inflation expectations would have re-
27:754:58851:22:22:89:521:229:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:mained reasonably contained during the 1970s. The middle left panel shows the simulated
27:755:58938:22:22:90:522:207:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:four-quarter-ahead inflation expectations under the OC policy. For comparison, the fig-
27:756:59025:22:23:89:521:185:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:ure also shows the corresponding SPF inflation forecasts, which rose dramatically in the
27:757:59113:23:22:90:521:162:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:1970s.16As seen in Figure 3, the OC policy acts to raise the unemployment rate up to the
27:758:59201:22:22:89:521:140:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:natural rate by 1967 and holds the unemployment rate moderately above the natural rate
27:759:59287:22:16:90:522:118:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:through most of the 1970s, offsetting the inflationary effects of the supply shocks of that
27:760:59378:16:15:98:521:102:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:16For this figure and those that follow, the SPF three-quarter-ahead inflation forecast is substituted for
27:761:59484:15:0:89:449:87:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:the four-quarter-ahead forecast in the periods when the latter is missing from the survey.
28:762:59576:0:22:90:522:694:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:period. These policy actions help stabilize inflation and inflation expectations and avoid
28:763:59666:22:22:89:378:672:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the need of a disinflationary policy at the end of the decade.
28:764:59728:22:22:106:521:650:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:According to our model simulation, this same OC policy performs dismally in the face
28:765:59812:22:22:89:521:628:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:of the historical natural rate misperceptions, leading to a Great Inflation outcome in the
28:766:59902:22:22:90:522:606:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:1970s. The panels in the right column of Figure 3 show the outcomes when the Fed uses
28:767:59987:22:23:89:521:584:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the historical real-time natural rate estimates. The simulated path of inflation during the
28:768:60078:23:22:90:522:561:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:1970s is similar to that seen in the actual data.  But, unlike the actual data, the high
28:769:60166:22:22:89:521:539:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:volatility of inflation continues through to the end of the sample. Owing to the low real-
28:770:60256:22:22:90:522:517:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:time estimate of the natural rate of unemployment, in this simulation the Fed does not
28:771:60342:22:22:89:521:495:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:act to raise unemployment during the latter part of the 1960s and early 1970s, as seen in
28:772:60431:22:22:90:522:473:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the right panel of Figure 3. This extended period of easy policy leads to a sustained rise
28:773:60521:22:22:89:521:451:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:in inflation and inflation expectations. By the time the supply shocks of the 1970s strike,
28:774:60612:22:22:90:492:429:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:inflation expectations are completely untethered from the assumed 2 percent target.
28:775:60695:22:22:106:521:407:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Could the high inflation of the late 1970s have been mitigated by following an optimal
28:776:60781:22:23:89:521:385:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:control policy predicated on placing a much lower weight on unemployment stabilization?
28:777:60868:23:22:90:522:362:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Orphanides and Williams (2008, 2009) show that “robust optimal control” policies derived
28:778:60956:22:22:89:521:340:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:assuming downward biased values ofλandνcan be robust to imperfect knowledge of
28:779:61034:22:22:89:521:318:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the type studied in the present paper. We examine the effectiveness of such an approach
28:780:61121:22:22:90:522:296:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:by evaluating the performance of the OC policies derived assuming alternative weights on
28:781:61209:22:22:89:329:274:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:unemployment in the central bank loss of 4 and 0.
28:782:61258:22:22:106:522:252:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:The OC policy derived assumingλ= 4 avoids the worst of the Great Inflation during
28:783:61339:22:22:89:521:230:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the 1970s, even with natural rate misperceptions. The left column in Figure 4 shows the
28:784:61426:22:23:90:522:208:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:simulation results when the natural rate is known by the Fed. The results are similar to the
28:785:61518:23:22:89:522:185:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:case of the OC policy derived assumingλ= 16. In the case of natural rate misperceptions,
28:786:61606:22:22:89:521:163:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:monetary policy is too easy during the late 1960s and early 1970s and, as a result, inflation
28:787:61699:22:22:90:522:141:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:and inflation expectations trend upwards. But, the rise in inflation during this period is
28:788:61789:22:22:89:289:119:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:not as extreme as seen in the actual data.
28:789:61831:22:0:106:521:97:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:In the absence of natural rate misperceptions, the OC policy that places no weight on
29:790:61918:0:22:90:521:694:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:unemployment stabilization,λ= 0, is effective at stabilizing inflation during the 1970s (and
29:791:62010:22:22:89:521:672:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:indeed for the entire sample period). The left column panels in Figure 5 show the simulated
29:792:62101:22:22:90:522:650:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:paths of inflation, inflation expectations, and unemployment under this policy in the case
29:793:62191:22:22:89:521:628:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:of no natural rate misperceptions. Under this policy, fluctuations in inflation and inflation
29:794:62284:22:22:90:522:606:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:expectations are far more muted than under the OC policy derived assumingλ= 4 or 16.
29:795:62368:22:23:89:521:584:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:This greater stabilization of inflation comes at the cost of only somewhat greater variability
29:796:62462:23:22:90:217:561:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:in the unemployment rate.
29:797:62487:22:22:106:521:539:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:With the historical natural rate misperceptions, the OC policy derived with a zero
29:798:62569:22:22:89:521:517:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:weight placed on the stabilization of unemployment in the loss function avoids the Great
29:799:62657:22:22:90:522:495:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Inflation, but still allows some inflation volatility to develop. The panels in the right column
29:800:62753:22:22:89:521:473:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:of Figure 5 show the simulated paths of inflation, inflation expectations, and unemployment
29:801:62844:22:22:90:522:451:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:under this policy in the case of historical natural rate misperceptions. Given the incorrect
29:802:62936:22:22:89:521:429:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:low estimate of the natural rate of unemployment at the start of the simulation, this policy
29:803:63028:22:22:90:522:407:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:keeps unemployment too low for too long. As a result, in the simulation, the inflation rate
29:804:63119:22:23:89:521:385:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:rises and inflation expectations become untethered. Note that the policy error does not
29:805:63206:23:22:90:522:362:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:stem from a concern for stabilizing unemployment for its own good, but instead reflects
29:806:63293:22:22:89:521:340:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the importance of deviations of unemployment from its natural rate for the future path of
29:807:63382:22:22:90:522:318:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:inflation. With inflation reaching 6 percent by mid-decade, policy acts aggressively to bring
29:808:63475:22:22:89:512:296:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:inflation back down to target by the end of the 1970s and a major stagflation is averted.

29:810:63651:22:22:89:521:252:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:1970s. The first three columns report the root mean squared differences of the inflation
29:811:63739:22:22:90:522:230:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:rate from its target value of 2 percent, the unemployment rate from it natural rate, and the
29:812:63831:22:23:89:521:208:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:first difference of the short-term interest rate, respectively. The final three columns report
29:813:63925:23:22:90:522:185:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the implied values of the central bank loss for three different values ofλ, the weight placed
29:814:64018:22:22:89:521:163:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:on the squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural rate. Table 2 reports
29:815:64107:22:22:90:365:141:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the same set of statistics for the full sample of 1966-2003.
29:816:64167:22:22:106:521:119:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:The first row of Table 1 reports key summary statistics for the actual data over the
29:817:64251:22:0:89:521:97:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:period of the Great Inflation from 1966 to 1979. Corresponding results for the full sample are
30:818:64347:0:22:90:522:694:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:reported in Table 2. Rows 2-4 of each table report the simulated outcomes under OC policies
30:819:64438:22:22:89:521:672:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:in the case of no natural rate misperceptions. All three of these policies yield fluctuations
30:820:64531:22:22:90:522:650:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:in inflation and the unemployment rate over 1966-1979 that are broadly comparable to
30:821:64615:22:22:89:521:628:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:those experienced during the period of the Great Moderation and nothing like the horrible
30:822:64704:22:22:90:390:606:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:performance that actually occurred during the Great Inflation.

30:824:64851:23:22:89:521:561:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:cal natural rate misperceptions depends crucially on the weight placed on unemployment
30:825:64937:22:22:90:522:539:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:stabilization in the objective function. Rows 5-7 of Tables 1 and 2 report the results for
30:826:65027:22:22:89:521:517:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:OC policies with historical natural rate misperceptions. The policy designed assuming no
30:827:65115:22:22:90:522:495:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:weight on unemployment stabilization performs the best of the three, even if the true value
30:828:65206:22:22:89:522:473:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:ofλis 16. The OC policy designed forλ= 16 yields much larger central bank losses over
30:829:65291:22:22:89:144:451:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:this period.
30:830:65303:22:22:106:521:429:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Interestingly, given the presence of natural rate misperceptions, the OC policies derived
30:831:65392:22:22:89:521:407:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:with a nonnegligible weight on stabilizing unemployment yield much greater inflation vari-
30:832:65482:22:23:90:522:385:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:ability in the final 20 years of our sample than is seen in the data. Although these policies
30:833:65575:23:22:89:521:362:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:describe the Great Inflation period reasonably well, they do not match the experience since
30:834:65666:22:22:90:522:340:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the disinflation of the early 1980s. In contrast, the OC policy derived assuming no weight
30:835:65756:22:22:89:521:318:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:on unemployment stabilization does a much better job of describing inflation during the
30:836:65843:22:22:90:210:296:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:latter part of the sample.
30:837:65869:22:22:106:521:274:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:The performance of OC policies is significantly improved if the central bank uses an
30:838:65953:22:22:89:521:252:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:appropriate Kalman filter to estimate the natural rate of unemployment, rather than using
30:839:66042:22:22:90:522:230:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the historical estimates.  Rows 8-10 of Tables 1 and 2 report the summary statistics in
30:840:66129:22:23:89:521:208:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the case of Kalman filter estimation of natural rates. The simulated outcomes lie between
30:841:66218:23:22:90:522:185:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:those of the two cases previously considered of no misperceptions and historical mispercep-
30:842:66309:22:22:89:521:163:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:tions. As in the case of historical misperceptions, the OC policy designed for no weight
30:843:66397:22:22:90:522:141:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:on unemployment stabilization performs the best. We also experimented with alternative
30:844:66483:22:22:89:521:119:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:values of the Kalman gain (not shown). A higher gain applied to the inflation surprise,
30:845:66570:22:0:90:522:97:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f1:a2, implies a quicker adjustment of the central bank’s estimate of the natural rate from 4
31:846:66662:0:22:90:522:694:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:percent toward its true value of roughly 6 percent early in the sample. As a result, the OC
31:847:66753:22:22:89:521:672:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:policies using higher gains perform somewhat better than the results reported in Tables 1
31:848:66842:22:22:90:522:650:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:and 2. Conversely, a lower value ofa2than our benchmark value implies worse performance
31:849:66929:22:22:89:248:628:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:during this period than reported.
31:850:66962:22:22:106:521:606:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:In summary, this analysis suggests that a benevolent policymaker striving to achieve
31:851:67046:22:23:89:521:584:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:full employment and price stability using modern optimal control methods could well have
31:852:67134:23:22:90:522:561:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:made policy decisions during the 1960s and 1970s that would have led to unmoored inflation
31:853:67224:22:22:89:521:539:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:expectations and highly volatile inflation. The magnitude of these problems depends on the
31:854:67314:22:22:90:522:517:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:weight that the policymaker places on the stabilization of real activity. Only if that weight
31:855:67407:22:22:89:521:495:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:is relatively small or if the policymaker has excellent information about the economy does
31:856:67497:22:22:90:522:473:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the optimal control policy perform reasonably well in terms of stabilizing inflation and
31:857:67585:22:35:89:162:451:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:unemployment.
31:858:67598:35:32:90:375:416:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:8  Performance of a Simple Policy Rule
31:859:67636:32:23:89:521:384:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:We now examine the performance of an alternative monetary policy rule that has proven
31:860:67721:23:22:90:522:361:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:to be robust to various forms of model uncertainty in other contexts (see Tetlow, 2006, and
31:861:67812:22:22:89:521:339:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Orphanides and Williams, 2008, 2009). The rule was proposed by Orphanides and Williams
31:862:67898:22:33:90:217:317:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:(2007) and takes the form:
31:863:67924:33:33:198:521:284:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f1:it=it−1+θπ( ̄πet+3−π∗) +θ∆u(ut−1−ut−2).(15)
31:864:67967:33:22:89:521:251:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:A key feature of this policy is the absence of any measures of natural rates in the determi-
31:865:68059:22:22:90:522:229:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:nation of policy. This policy rule is related to the elastic price standard proposed by Hall
31:866:68151:22:22:89:521:207:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:(1984), whereby the central bank aims to maintain a stipulated relationship between the
31:867:68238:22:22:90:522:185:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:forecast of the unemployment rate and the price level. It is also closely related to the first
31:868:68332:22:23:89:521:163:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:difference of a modified Taylor-type policy rule in which the forecast of the price level is
31:869:68424:23:22:90:319:140:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:substituted for the forecast of the inflation rate.
31:870:68475:22:22:106:521:118:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:We choose the parameters of these simple rules to minimize the central bank loss for
31:871:68559:22:0:89:522:96:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f1:λ= 4 andν= 1, under the assumptions of rational expectations and constant natural
32:872:68642:0:32:90:357:694:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:rates.17The resulting optimized simple rule is given by:
32:873:68698:32:33:190:521:662:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f1:it=it−1+ 1.74 ( ̄πet+3−π∗)−1.19 (ut−1−ut−2).(16)
32:874:68746:33:22:89:521:629:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:This is the same rule as analyzed in Orphanides and Williams (2008, 2009), where it was
32:875:68833:22:22:90:522:607:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:shown to be effective at stabilizing inflation and unemployment in model simulations with
32:876:68922:22:22:89:190:585:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:imperfect knowledge.
32:877:68942:22:23:106:521:563:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:According to the model simulation, if the Fed had followed this simple rule over the past
32:878:69031:23:22:89:521:540:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:40 years, inflation would have been relatively stable and the Great Inflation would never
32:879:69120:22:22:90:522:518:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:have occurred. Figure 6 compares the simulated paths of inflation, inflation expectations,
32:880:69210:22:22:89:521:496:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the real interest rate, and the unemployment rate under this simple robust policy rule to
32:881:69299:22:22:90:522:474:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the actual data. Because this simple policy rule does not respond to the natural rate of
32:882:69387:22:22:89:521:452:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:unemployment, the simulations are invariant to the assumed path of central bank natural
32:883:69474:22:22:90:522:430:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:rate estimates. Inflation does fluctuate a bit during the 1970s, reflecting the large shocks of
32:884:69569:22:22:89:521:408:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:that period, but the deviations from target are short-lived. The simulated path for inflation
32:885:69662:22:22:90:253:386:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:is very stable since the mid-1980s.
32:886:69697:22:23:106:521:364:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:This simple policy rule is extremely effective at keeping inflation expectations well an-
32:887:69786:23:22:89:521:341:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:chored. Although the inflation rate itself fluctuates under the simple policy rule, inflation
32:888:69879:22:22:90:522:319:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:is expected to return to near its target rate of 2 percent within one year. As discussed
32:889:69967:22:22:89:521:297:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:in Orphanides and Williams (2008), the anchoring of inflation expectations is key to the
32:890:70055:22:22:90:522:275:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:success of this rule in stabilizing inflation and unemployment. A striking result is that this
32:891:70149:22:22:89:521:253:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:simple rule does better at stabilizing inflation and inflation expectations than the OC policy
32:892:70243:22:22:90:522:231:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:derived forλ= 0. The anchoring of inflation expectations implies that the gap between
32:893:70328:22:22:89:521:209:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the unemployment rate and the natural rate is considerably smaller throughout the sample
32:894:70416:22:23:90:204:187:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:than in the actual data.
32:895:70440:23:22:106:521:164:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Interestingly, the simulated behavior of inflation, inflation expectations, and unemploy-
32:896:70529:22:22:89:521:142:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:ment over the latter part of our sample is very close to that of the actual data.  This
32:897:70616:22:16:90:522:120:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:finding suggests that the actual policy framework during this period may not have been
32:898:70702:16:14:98:521:104:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:17If we allow for time-varying natural rates that areknown by all agents, the optimized parameters of this
32:899:70808:14:11:89:521:90:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:simple rule under rational expectations are nearly unchanged. The relative performance of this policy is also
32:900:70917:11:0:90:134:79:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:unaffected.
33:901:70930:0:22:90:385:694:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:very different from that prescribed by this robust simple rule.
33:902:70993:22:22:106:521:672:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:The simple robust policy rule performs as well as or better than the best OC policy where
33:903:71082:22:22:89:521:650:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the central bank uses the Kalman filter to estimate the natural rate of unemployment. The
33:904:71171:22:22:90:522:628:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:final rows of Tables 1 and 2 report the summary statistics for the robust policy rule. This
33:905:71262:22:22:89:438:606:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:holds for any of the three values of the central bank loss considered here.
33:906:71337:22:23:106:521:584:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:The anchoring of long-run inflation expectations under the simple robust policy rule
33:907:71421:23:22:89:521:561:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:is illustrated by the small variance in the simulated path for inflation expectations over
33:908:71511:22:22:90:522:539:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the next 10 years. The thin solid line in Figure 7 shows the simulated path for 10-year
33:909:71598:22:22:89:521:517:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:inflation expectations when monetary policy follows the simple robust policy rule. This line
33:910:71690:22:22:90:522:495:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:fluctuates very little over the entire sample. By comparison, surveys of 10-year consumer
33:911:71779:22:22:89:521:473:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:price index inflation expectations (not shown) reached around 8 percent at the start of the
33:912:71870:22:22:90:522:451:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:1980s, and then gradually fell to around 2-1/2 percent in the late 1990s. Since that time,
33:913:71960:22:22:89:393:429:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:these long-run inflation expectations have fluctuated very little.
33:914:72026:22:22:106:521:407:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:In contrast, the OC policy derived assumingλ= 16 does a poor job of anchoring long-
33:915:72109:22:23:89:521:385:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:run inflation expectations.  The thick solid line in the chart shows the path of 10-year
33:916:72197:23:22:90:521:362:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:inflation expectations under the OC policy optimized forλ= 16 and assuming historical
33:917:72282:22:22:89:521:340:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:natural rate misperceptions. This line fluctuates considerably over the sample, reflecting the
33:918:72376:22:22:90:522:318:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:relatively poor anchoring of inflation expectations under this regime. The dashed line shows
33:919:72468:22:22:89:521:296:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the corresponding outcomes under the OC policy optimized forλ= 16 and assuming no
33:920:72549:22:22:89:521:274:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:natural rate misperceptions. Not surprisingly, long-run inflation expectations are generally
33:921:72641:22:22:90:522:252:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:reasonably well anchored in this case.  However, even in this case, there are extended
33:922:72727:22:22:89:521:230:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:episodes during the 1970s and early 2000s when long-run inflation expectations fluctuate
33:923:72815:22:35:90:149:208:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:significantly.
33:924:72829:35:33:89:190:173:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:9  Conclusion
33:925:72842:33:22:90:522:140:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:Our narrative account and counterfactual simulations squarely attribute the Great Inflation
33:926:72933:22:22:89:521:118:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:to policy actions that were viewed by many at the time to reflect the latest advances in
33:927:73021:22:0:90:522:96:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:macroeconomics as embodied in the New Economics. The fine-tuning approach to monetary
34:928:73108:0:22:90:522:694:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:policy, with its emphasis on stabilizing the level of real activity, might have succeeded in
34:929:73200:22:22:89:521:672:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:stabilizing the economy if policymakers had possessed accurate real-time assessments of
34:930:73287:22:22:90:522:650:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:the natural rate of unemployment. In the event, they did not and they failed to account
34:931:73374:22:22:89:521:628:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:for their imperfect information regarding the economy’s potential and the effects of these
34:932:73464:22:22:90:522:606:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:misperceptions on the evolution of inflation expectations and inflation. Price and economic
34:933:73555:22:23:89:521:584:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:stability were only restored after the Federal Reserve, under Chairman Volcker, refocused
34:934:73644:23:22:90:346:561:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:policy on establishing and maintaining price stability.
34:935:73699:22:22:106:521:539:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:This paper shows that, even if the Federal Reserve had applied modern optimal control
34:936:73784:22:22:89:521:517:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:techniques in conducting monetary policy, it would not have been more effective at stabiliz-
34:937:73876:22:22:90:522:495:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:ing inflation during the 1970s owing to the presence of realistic informational imperfections
34:938:73969:22:22:89:521:473:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:such as misperceptions of the natural rate of unemployment. Such optimal control policies
34:939:74058:22:22:90:522:451:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:would likely have failed to keep inflation expectations well anchored, resulting in highly
34:940:74148:22:22:89:521:429:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:volatile inflation. An optimal control policy would have succeeded only if the weight placed
34:941:74240:22:22:90:522:407:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:on stabilizing the real economy were relatively modest—with the best results achieved if
34:942:74328:22:23:89:521:385:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:virtually all the weight were placed on stabilizing prices. Finally, we show that a strategy
34:943:74420:23:22:90:522:362:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:of following a simple first-difference policy rule would have been more successful than opti-
34:944:74513:22:22:89:521:340:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:mal control policies in maintaining price stability and employment stability in the presence
34:945:74605:22:22:90:522:318:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:of realistic informational imperfections. In addition, this policy rule yields simulated out-
34:946:74698:22:22:89:521:296:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:comes close to the realized behavior of the economy during the Great Moderation starting
34:947:74786:22:22:90:522:274:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:in the mid-1980s, suggesting that the actual practice of monetary policy during this period
34:948:74877:22:0:89:515:252:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:changed in ways that incorporated the key properties of the robust monetary policy rule.
