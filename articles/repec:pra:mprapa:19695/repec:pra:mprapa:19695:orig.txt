3:56:811:12:12:70:525:632:11:Times:11:Times:This unique study discusses the theory of taxation in Islam and the role of Zakat in an Islamic economy. 
3:57:916:12:13:70:526:620:11:Times:11:Times:Zakat  is  a  compulsory  payment  i.e.  a  tax  in  this  sense  paid  to  the  government  on  one’s  income  and 
3:58:1032:13:12:70:525:607:11:Times:11:Times:wealth.  The  Zakat  rates  are  studied  for  their  viability  and  effectiveness  to  fulfill  fiscal  needs  of  the 
3:59:1153:12:12:70:525:595:11:Times:11:Times:government.  Based  on  the  evidence  from  many  countries,  it  is  argued  that  Zakat  rates  are  substantial 
3:60:1269:12:12:70:525:583:11:Times:11:Times:enough  to  generate  the  needed  public  finance  given the  large  tax  base  and  free  the  government  from 
3:61:1383:12:13:70:525:571:11:Times:11:Times:using  seignorage  and  deficit  financing.  Its  compulsory  nature  both  as  per  law  of  the  land  and  as  per 
3:62:1501:13:12:70:525:558:11:Times:11:Times:religion  would  ensure  minimum  tax  evasion  and  its  progressive  and  direct  nature  would  effectively 
3:63:1612:12:13:70:525:546:11:Times:11:Times:redistribute  income.  The  effect  of  Zakat  on  the  overall  macroeconomy,  the  financial  system,  monetary 
3:64:1726:13:12:70:525:533:11:Times:11:Times:system,  property market,  stock market,  inflation, foreign  debt, balance  of  payments, FDI  and the  on the 
3:65:1838:12:12:70:525:521:11:Times:11:Times:development  oriented  variables  like  inequality  and poverty  are  also  discussed  to  give  a  holistic  view of 
3:66:1956:12:12:70:235:509:11:Times:10:Helvetica:the effects of the proposed system.

3:71:2160:12:11:70:151:449:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:1.     Introduction 
3:72:2179:11:11:70:73:438:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
3:73:2179:11:12:70:525:427:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Zakah is  a  religious  obligation to  pay a part  of wealth and income to  the government.  However, in most 
3:74:2288:12:11:70:525:415:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:countries, Zakat is not collected by the government and is not considered a compulsory payment (Powell, 
3:75:2392:11:11:70:527:404:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:n.d).  Respected  Muslim  scholar  Ab-ul-ala  Maududi  reasoned  (1970)  that  Zakat  is  a  religious  obligation 
3:76:2507:11:11:70:525:393:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:and is not a substitute of tax. Taxes other than Zakat can be imposed in an interest free economy if these 
3:77:2614:11:11:70:525:382:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:taxes  are  levied  by  the  legislative  council  and  used  for  public  welfare.  He  reasoned  that  the  taxes 
3:78:2730:11:11:70:525:371:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:discouraged  in  Ahadith  are  those  which  were   imposed  by  autocratic  kings  for  their  own  lavish 
3:79:2838:11:12:70:525:360:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:consumption  and  this  kind  of  usurpation  of  public  property  was  discouraged.  Rehman  (2006)  also 
3:80:2946:12:11:70:528:348:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:asserted  that  Zakat  is  not  the  same  as  taxes  as  the  former  is  paid  by  the  individuals  to  purify  one’s 
3:81:3067:11:11:70:525:337:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:income  and  wealth  based  on  the  direction  of  Allah  and  the  later  is  usually  imposed  by  government  for 
3:82:3185:11:11:70:525:326:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:running its affairs of the state. Islahi (1985) explained that it is not necessary to make some living person 
3:83:3295:11:11:70:525:315:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:the  owner  of  the  Zakah.  Zakah  can  be  given  to  any  person  or  cause  or  an  organization  working  for  a 
3:84:3413:11:12:70:411:304:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:cause. It is not necessary to make some living person the owner of the Zakah.  
3:85:3492:12:11:70:73:292:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
3:86:3492:11:11:70:525:281:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Liam (2002) reasoned that property rights are valid in a post-tax environment i.e. one obtains the right to 
3:87:3600:11:11:70:525:270:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:own  property  in  the  eyes  of  law  when  one  pays  the  taxes  due.  The  sanctity  of  property  rights  is 
3:88:3714:11:12:70:525:259:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:conditional  to  paying  taxes.  Consistent  with  logic and  this  economic  philosophy,  property  rights  in  Islam 
3:89:3833:12:11:70:239:247:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:are also valid in a post-Zakat context.   
3:90:3875:11:11:70:73:236:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
3:91:3875:11:11:70:526:225:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:The respected Muslim scholar Muhammad Taqi Usmani (2009) arguing in favor of limited liability used the 
3:92:3979:11:11:70:525:214:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:argument  that  a  judicial  person  can  have  separate  existence  and  thereby  practically  granting  and 
3:93:4089:11:11:70:526:203:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:reaching the same result as that of Islahi’s work on Tamlik, but the arguments of both are different since 
3:94:4196:11:12:70:350:192:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Islahi’s work is not based on logic alone, but on Quranic Arabic.   
3:95:4264:12:11:70:73:180:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
3:96:4264:11:11:70:527:169:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Hashmi  (2002)  explained  Islahi’s  viewpoint  on  ‘Tamlik’.  In  the  following  lines,  a  summary  of  Islahi’s 
3:97:4380:11:11:70:426:158:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:viewpoint as explained by Hashmi from Islahi’s original work in Urdu is presented.  
3:98:4464:11:11:70:73:147:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
3:99:4464:11:12:70:525:136:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Literally,  tamlīk  means  ‘to  put  somebody  in  possession  of  something’.  Here,  with  reference  to  Zakāh,  it 
3:100:4583:12:11:70:525:124:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:means  ‘the  transfer  of  ownership  of  Zakāh  money  to  the  real  beneficiary’.  Our  scholars  regard  it 
3:101:4695:11:0:70:525:113:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:necessary  to  transfer  the  ownership  of  Zakāh  fund  to  a  needy  person.  Therefore,  the  money  of  Zakāh 
4:102:4810:0:12:70:525:727:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:cannot  be  spent  for  general  welfare  of  the  poor.  For  example,  we  cannot  build  hospitals  for  the  free 
4:103:4928:12:11:70:525:715:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:treatment of the poor, cannot establish schools for their children, and cannot provide their dwellings with 
4:104:5036:11:11:70:525:704:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:fresh water. Likewise, we cannot arrange for the burial of a poor person or pay loans outstanding against 
4:105:5142:11:11:70:343:693:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:him, for he cannot be made the owner of the money in person.  
4:106:5204:11:11:70:73:682:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
4:107:5204:11:12:70:511:671:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Those who consider tamlīk compulsory for the payment of Zakāh put forward the following arguments: 
4:108:5303:12:11:70:73:659:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
4:109:5303:11:11:70:525:648:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:1. In the  Qur’ānic  verse  ’....‘َِاء-َ-ُ-ْ-ِ-$#"َ!َ تُ  \u001eا   َ%#&ِإ (Indeed, the alms  are for the poor... (9:60), the preposition 
4:110:5441:11:11:87:165:637:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:‘lam’ is for tamlīk. 
4:111:5462:11:11:87:90:626:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
4:112:5462:11:11:70:419:615:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:2. The word Itā (giving) in ‘َ2#آ0َة-0ُ34ا’ (pay Zakāh) connotes the meaning of tamlīk. 
4:113:5550:11:12:87:90:604:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
4:114:5550:12:11:70:523:592:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:3.    The Qur’ān uses the word Sadaqah for Zakāh and tasadduq (give in charity) originally implies tamlīk. 
4:115:5657:11:11:70:73:581:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
4:116:5657:11:11:70:525:570:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Amīn Ahsan Islāhī, a distinguished religious scholar  has effectively refuted  these arguments in his book 
4:117:5764:11:11:70:503:559:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:‘Masa’alah-i-Tamlīk’. His viewpoint in response to the first argument of the said school is as follows:  
4:118:5869:11:12:70:73:548:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
4:119:5869:12:11:70:525:536:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:1.    There  is  no  clear  instruction  in  the  Qur’ān  and  Sunnah  which  says  that  tamlīk  is  an  indivisible 
4:120:5987:11:11:87:172:525:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:condition of Zakāh. 
4:121:6007:11:11:87:90:514:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
4:122:6007:11:11:70:525:503:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:2. The  preposition  lām  (ل)  in  the  word  ‘َِاء-َ-ُ-ْ--’,  is  not  merely  used  for  tamlīk  in  the  Holy  Qur’ān  rather  it 
4:123:6140:11:12:87:525:492:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:connotes  a  host  of  meanings.  Ibn  Hishām,  a  renowned  grammarian  of  the  Arabic  language,  has 
4:124:6245:12:11:87:525:480:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:enumerated nearly twenty-two usages of this preposition in his celebrated treatise ‘Mughnī al-Labīb’.

4:139:7106:11:12:70:525:313:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:It is worth mentioning that Ibn Hishām has cited examples mostly from the Holy Qur’ān. For tamlīk, he has 
4:140:7212:12:11:70:525:301:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:cited  a  common  expression  of  the  Arabic  language.  Had  the  meaning  of  tamlīk  been  so  pronounced  in 
4:141:7326:11:11:70:396:290:10:g_d0_f6:10:Helvetica:the lām used in ’...‘َِاءِإ-َ-ُ-ْ-ِ-$#"َ!َ تُ \u001eا  َ%#&, he would have quoted it as an example.

4:143:7426:11:12:70:525:268:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:3.    Muslim  jurists  and  scholars  do  not  agree  upon  one  meaning  of  this  lam.  The  Hanafites  take  it  for 
4:144:7546:12:11:87:364:256:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:‘āqibah (consequence) whereas the Malikites take it for tamlīk.

4:146:7612:11:11:70:525:234:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:4.    The context of the verse does not allow this sense of the preposition. Following is the context in which 
4:147:7723:11:11:87:166:223:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:the verse occurs:  
4:148:7742:11:11:70:73:212:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
4:149:7742:11:12:70:525:201:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Among these hypocrites are people who level allegations against you concerning the distribution of alms. 
4:150:7847:12:11:70:525:189:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:If  they  are  given  according  to  their  wishes,  they  are  pleased.  If  they  are  given  nothing,  they  grow 
4:151:7964:11:11:70:525:178:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:resentful.  It  would  have  been  better  if  they  were  satisfied  with  what  God  and  His  Prophet  have  given 
4:152:8082:11:11:70:525:167:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:them,  and  said:  ‘God  is  sufficient  for  us.  He  will provide  for  us  from  His  own  abundance  and  so  will  his 
4:153:8206:11:11:70:526:156:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Messenger.  To God we  will submit.’ Alms  shall  be only for  the poor  and the destitute; for those that are 
4:154:8317:11:12:70:525:145:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:engaged  in  the  management  of  alms  and  those  whose  hearts  are  to  be  won  in  favour  of  Faith;  for  the 
4:155:8435:12:11:70:525:133:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:freeing  of  slaves  and  debtors:  for  the  advancement of  God’s  cause;  and  for  the  traveler.  That  is  a  duty 
4:156:8556:11:11:70:317:122:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:enjoined by God. God is all-knowing and wise. (9:58-60).

5:158:8613:0:12:70:401:727:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Amīn Ahsan Islāhī’s explanation of the context of these verses is as follows:  
5:159:8692:12:11:70:73:715:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
5:160:8692:11:11:70:528:704:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:These verses portray the picture of the hypocrites whose response to the Prophet was conditional upon 
5:161:8794:11:11:70:525:693:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:their self-interest. If they were given what they wished, they would remain pleased; otherwise, they would 
5:162:8901:11:11:70:525:682:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:get annoyed and  accuse the  Prophet of partiality  and favoritism. And they  would spread such  depraved 
5:163:9007:11:12:70:525:671:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:thoughts  among  Muslims.  Now  consider  what  needs  to be  made  clear.  Does  the  situation  need  a 
5:164:9113:12:11:70:525:659:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:statement making transfer of Zakāh fund directly to the recipients compulsory or the explanation that alms 
5:165:9220:11:11:70:257:648:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:are only meant for such and such people?  
5:166:9262:11:11:70:73:637:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
5:167:9262:11:11:70:481:626:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:5.    The construction of the verse does not accept the meaning of tamlīk. In Islāhī’s own words: 
5:168:9360:11:11:70:73:615:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
5:169:9360:11:12:70:525:604:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:In the verse, it is obvious, there are eight things mentioned as the lawful use of the Zakāh fund. Of these, 
5:170:9469:12:11:70:525:592:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:four  come  under  influence  of  the  preposition  lām  and  the  remaining  four  come  under  the  preposition  fī. 
5:171:9588:11:11:70:525:581:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:We  must construe something  corresponding  with  both the  prepositions  lām  and  fī.  If  we  take  lām  in  the 
5:172:9704:11:11:70:525:570:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:meaning  of  tamlīk,  the  first  part  of  the  sentence  is  separated  from  the  rest,  as  fī  does  not  imply  the 
5:173:9826:11:11:70:526:559:10:Helvetica:10:g_d0_f6:meaning of tamlīk at all. It only connotes the meaning of ‘usefulness’ or ‘service’ as it does in the following 
5:174:9938:11:12:70:525:548:10:g_d0_f6:10:Helvetica:narrative  of  the  Holy  Prophet:  ‘=ْJِjَ0َْنِ  ا`  ْQِR  ُ"ْ[َkْ\u001eآَ نَ  ا َK’  (until  one  remains  in  the  service  of  his  brothers). 
5:175:10085:12:11:70:526:536:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Therefore, a compact and well-knit structure of the verse, like this, demands that the both lām and fī imply 
5:176:10194:11:11:70:526:525:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:the meaning  of ‘deserving’  or ‘benefiting from’ so that  the  verse may be interpreted  giving  an  intelligible 
5:177:10309:11:11:70:525:514:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:set  of  meanings.  To  take  the  lām  in  the  sense  of  tamlīk  would  not  be  possible  without  sacrificing  the 
5:178:10429:11:11:70:223:503:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:eloquent expression of the Qur’ān.  
5:179:10465:11:12:70:73:492:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
5:180:10465:12:11:70:525:480:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:As  regards  the  second  and  third  argument,  it  is  correct  that  sometimes  Itā  and  tasadduq  connote  the 
5:181:10581:11:11:70:525:469:10:Helvetica:10:g_d0_f6:sense  of  tamlīk,  but the  ultimate  interpretation  rests  on  the  context  of  the  usage.  It  does  not  serve  as  a 
5:182:10706:11:11:70:525:458:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:stance  to  prove that the  meaning  of  tamlīk is  inseparable  in  this  lām.  Had  it  be the  case,  we  would  have 
5:183:10827:11:11:70:525:447:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:taken this  meaning in the sentences ‘ب َeِd-ْا  ْaُه َGْJَ34َو’ (and we gave  him the  book) and ‘0ُْرًاmَدَاوُدَ ز  َGْJَ34َو’ (and we 
5:184:10964:11:12:70:525:436:10:g_d0_f6:10:Helvetica:bestowed upon David  Zabūr), which of course would  be  wrong. Likewise, the  verse ‘َIْJِ?ِ-$# -ا  َIsK  ْIُقَ  وَاَآ#"suَ َR’ 
5:185:11092:12:11:70:528:424:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:(so I would give in charity  and be among the pious ones) means ‘I would spend in the way of Allah and 
5:186:11195:11:11:70:525:413:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:would spend my money for the benefit of the poor’. It does not mean at all that I would transfer money in 
5:187:11301:11:11:70:192:402:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:the possession of the poor.  
5:188:11330:11:11:70:73:391:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
5:189:11330:11:11:70:290:380:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Islāhī elucidates this aspect in the following words: 
5:190:11384:11:12:70:73:369:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
5:191:11384:12:11:70:525:357:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:The meaning of tamlīk is not manifest in the words itā and tasadduq. Therefore, it cannot be presented as 
5:192:11489:11:11:70:525:346:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:the  final  proof  in  favour  of  the  concept  of  tamlīk.  The  only  thing  these  words  represent  is  giving  or 
5:193:11609:11:11:70:525:335:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:spending.  It  can  be  done  by  transferring  the  ownership  of  the  money  to  a  poor  or  spending  it  for  the 
5:194:11729:11:11:70:221:324:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:betterment of the poor community. 
5:195:11763:11:12:70:73:313:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
5:196:11763:12:11:70:525:301:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:It  is  clear  from  above  explanation  that  it  is  not  necessary  to  make  some  living  person  an  owner  of  the 
5:197:11884:11:11:70:156:290:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:proceeds of Zakah. 
5:198:11903:11:11:70:73:279:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
5:199:11903:11:12:70:528:268:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Ghamidi (2007) in his monumental book ‘Meezan’ has argued that no tax can be levied other than Zakah. 
5:200:12005:12:11:70:525:256:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Further, concept of ‘Ushr’ can be applied in industrial production as well on the premise that rain fed land 
5:201:12114:11:11:70:528:245:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:was taxed at 10% and irrigated land was taxed at 5%. Based on this argument, he deduced that rain fed 
5:202:12216:11:11:70:525:234:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:land  use  primarily  labor  as  a  factor  of  production;  whereas,  irrigated  land  use  both  labor  and  capital. 
5:203:12336:11:11:70:525:223:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Thus, industries employing both labor and capital can be taxed at 5% and those employing only labor or 
5:204:12438:11:11:70:195:212:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:capital can be taxed at 10%. 
5:205:12467:11:12:70:73:201:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
5:206:12467:12:11:70:525:189:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Furthermore, Ghamidi (2007) argued that since stock-in-trade is exempted from Zakah, it can be deduced 
5:207:12569:11:11:70:525:178:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:from this principle that investments made for earning  profits can also be exempted from Zakah and only 
5:208:12672:11:11:70:525:167:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:income  from  such  investments  would  be  taxable  at  10%  since  no  labor  is  usually  involved  when  one 
5:209:12785:11:11:70:525:156:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:purchases  a  share  or  equity  stake  in  a  business  concern.  However,  Usmani  (2003)  asserted  that  Zakat 
5:210:12900:11:12:70:525:145:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:on shares would be paid by excluding from the total assets the value of operational assets such as plant 
5:211:13005:12:11:70:525:133:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:and machinery i.e. those coming under the ambit of means of production. From the resultant, the liabilities 
5:212:13113:11:11:70:525:122:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:owed to the business can be deducted. Then, the Zakat can be paid on the value of those assets arrived 
5:213:13215:11:0:70:523:111:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:as a resultant of two adjustments based on the proportional ownership of the investor in that business.     
6:214:13322:0:12:70:73:727:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
6:215:13322:12:11:70:525:715:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:As  discussed  before,  most  Muslim  scholars  maintained  that  Zakat  is  not  the  only  form  of  revenue  for 
6:216:13438:11:11:70:525:704:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:government generated from public’s income and wealth and secondly, taxes can be imposed for running 
6:217:13538:11:11:70:496:693:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:the affairs of the state other than Zakat and it is not the mandate of Zakat to fulfill that fiscal need.   
6:218:13646:11:11:70:73:682:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
6:219:13646:11:12:70:525:671:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:This led some economists to raise questions as to how public finance would work in an Islamic economy. 
6:220:13748:12:11:70:525:659:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Some  studies  have  shown  concern  over  the  applicability  of  Islamic  finance  principles  beyond  the 
6:221:13857:11:11:70:525:648:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:commercial  banking  into  the  pricing  of  loans  between  countries  and  IFIs  (Reddy,  2001)  and  monetizing

6:264:16231:25:11:70:525:126:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Nisaab on  wealth  was  basically specified  in  silver. For calculation  purposes, people  used the cross rate 
6:265:16343:11:0:70:525:115:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:between  gold  and  silver  and  determined  their  nisaab  in  gold  as  well.  This  cross  rate  has  changed 
7:266:16456:0:12:70:525:727:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:historically; that is why, we will have to resort to the original base i.e. 612 grams of silver. One important 
7:267:16567:12:11:70:525:715:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:implication  of  this  principle  is  that  tax  exemption  amount  in  silver  is  much  lower  than  gold  using  current 
7:268:16691:11:11:70:525:704:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:cross  rate  and  hence  taxable  assets  will  increase  in  magnitude.  If  the  wealth,  production  or  livestock 
7:269:16808:11:11:70:525:693:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:exceeds  the  minimum  exemption  limit,  Zakah  would  be  levied  as  per  the  ceiling  rates  defined  for  each 
7:270:16925:11:11:70:217:682:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:category of wealth or production.  
7:271:16960:11:12:70:73:671:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
7:272:16960:12:11:70:525:659:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:It is generally understood that Zakah is only 2-½% on capital. But rates of Zakah are different on various 
7:273:17067:11:11:70:525:648:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:heads  of  income.  Agriculture  economy  existed  1400  years  ago.  If  there  was  Zakah  on  agricultural 
7:274:17177:11:11:70:525:637:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:produce, there should be Zakah on industrial produce if it exists today. Ushr and Khums was in principle a 
7:275:17284:11:11:70:426:626:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:production tax. It should be imposed today on all heads of income and production. 
7:276:17366:11:11:70:73:615:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
7:277:17366:11:11:70:205:604:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:The classification is as follows: 
7:278:17400:11:12:70:73:593:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
7:279:17400:12:11:70:525:581:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:a) 2-½% on cash, wholesale value of held for trade inventory and capital in excess of need payable once 
7:280:17504:11:11:70:525:570:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:a  year at a particular set date.  Diamond and  precious stones should  be taxable  as Zakah  is paid  out of 
7:281:17613:11:11:70:525:559:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:wealth and all that constitute wealth should be taxable. Property/Vehicle & other assets used for personal 
7:282:17720:11:12:70:377:548:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:consumption beyond a limit (in excess of need) should also be taxable. 
7:283:17791:12:11:70:73:536:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
7:284:17791:11:11:70:526:525:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:b)  5%  on  production  using  both  labor  and  capital.  It  is  applicable  on  production  in  industries  and 
7:285:17906:11:11:70:525:514:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:agriculture or on any other  income  earned  where  both labor and  capital are  utilized. It is  charged at the 
7:286:18019:11:11:70:237:503:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:completion of the production process.  
7:287:18058:11:12:70:73:492:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
7:288:18058:12:11:70:525:480:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:c)  10%  on  production  using  either  labor  or  capital.  It  is  applicable  on  rental  income,  dividend  income, 
7:289:18178:11:11:70:525:469:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:income  from  selling  securities  yielding  capital  gains,  salaries  and  pure  service  industries  such  as 
7:290:18291:11:11:70:334:458:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:consultancy. It is charged as soon as the income is realized.  
7:291:18354:11:11:87:90:447:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
7:292:18354:11:12:70:525:436:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:d) 20% on  production  using neither labor nor capital. This is applicable on treasure or any  other natural 
7:293:18463:12:11:70:295:424:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:gift obtained without using neither labor nor capital.  
7:294:18519:11:11:70:73:413:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
7:295:18519:11:11:70:525:402:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Production is not limited to agriculture nowadays, but major part of it is coming from industries. Therefore, 
7:296:18629:11:11:70:525:391:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Nisaab  for  industrial  production  will  have  to  be  defined  for  the  first  time.  As  discussed  above,  Nisaab 
7:297:18749:11:11:70:525:380:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:implies  the  minimum  exemption  amount;  it  can  be  increased  as  well  as  defined  afresh  on  new  assets, 
7:298:18864:11:12:70:305:369:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:production or income added into the tax net over time.

7:301:18958:11:11:70:73:335:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
7:302:18958:11:11:70:525:324:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Ghamidi (2007) has argued in his research that the rates on Zakah are ceiling rates. This is discovered by 
7:303:19065:11:12:70:525:313:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:looking  at  the  linguistic  construction  of  that  said  directive.  This  paper  will  not  go  into  details  about  the 
7:304:19191:12:11:70:525:301:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:linguistic construction but one can refer to his work for further research. It implies that government cannot 
7:305:19301:11:11:70:525:290:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:charge  anything  above  these  rates  on  the  particular  heads  of  income  as  specified  above.  But,  the 
7:306:19413:11:11:70:525:279:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:government  can  charge  a  rate  below  these  ceiling  rates.  The  government  can  give  a  tax  benefit  for  a 
7:307:19530:11:12:70:526:268:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:particular  social  purpose  to  any  industry,  group  of  people  and  socio-economic  activity.  The  Prophet 
7:308:19643:12:11:70:424:256:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) gave tax exemption to vegetables, horses etc.

7:310:19719:11:11:70:526:234:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:In  pure  service  industries  like  consultancy  service,  services  of  doctors  and  lawyers  etc,  a  rate  of  10% 
7:311:19839:11:11:70:525:223:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Zakah  can  be  charged.  When  a  particular  industry  moves  away  from  a  pure  service  industry  to  a 
7:312:19949:11:11:70:525:212:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:producing industry; the rate of Zakah can be decreased up to not less than 5%. Between the service and 
7:313:20051:11:12:70:525:201:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:goods  producing  industry,  tax  can  be  levied  within the  range  of  5%  and  10%.  The  industries  in  which 
7:314:20167:12:11:70:438:189:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:producers have producer surplus should be taxed a little heavily in the defined range.

7:317:20298:11:11:70:73:156:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
7:318:20298:11:12:70:525:145:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Zakah is payable to the  government. It is declared as a right of the government and the duty of citizens 
7:319:20404:12:11:70:525:133:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:towards the government. Only when the government is not collecting Zakah, one can pay it privately. But 
7:320:20508:11:11:70:451:122:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:if the government collects Zakah in a community, people must pay it to the government.

8:325:20640:12:11:70:525:693:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:The  government  cannot  levy  any  tax  other  than  Zakah.  This  will  serve  as  an  automatic  check  on  the 
8:326:20755:11:11:70:424:682:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:government to effectively and efficiently collect and spend the proceeds of Zakah.

8:348:21987:11:12:87:526:436:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:intensive mix and use of factors of production (labor and capital) is taxed leniently at 5%. Production 
8:349:22091:12:11:87:525:424:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:with less intensive mix and use of factors of production (labor or capital) is taxed at a minimum of 5% 
8:350:22195:11:11:87:525:413:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:to  a  maximum  of  10%.  Windfall  gain  is  taxed  at  20% if  it  arises  from  neither  the  use  of  labor  nor

8:358:22674:11:11:70:525:324:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:4.    It levies  a special tax on cash,  cash equivalents and  capital in excess of need that makes sure that 
8:359:22784:11:12:87:351:313:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:the money circulates and is used in the productive activities.  
8:360:22848:12:11:87:90:301:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
8:361:22848:11:11:70:525:290:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:5.    Tax on cash and capital will force the people to invest their money in productive uses. With prohibition

8:365:23123:11:11:70:407:245:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:6.    It results in an increase in tax base because it covers all heads of income.

8:376:23648:11:11:70:525:122:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:10.  Including the amount of liability and receivables in Zakah accounting would encourage spot and cash 
8:377:23753:11:0:87:418:111:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:transactions whenever possible and decrease the size of credit transactions.

9:380:23896:12:11:70:73:704:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
9:381:23896:11:11:70:525:693:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Pakistan’s fiscal deficit is around 7% of its GDP. The current tax to GDP ratio is approximately 10% of the 
9:382:24004:11:11:70:525:682:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:GDP.  It  suggests  that  if  tax-to-GDP  ratio  can  be  increased  to  more  than  15%,  the  fiscal  deficit  will 
9:383:24122:11:12:70:525:671:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:substantially reduce. Zakah at rates of 5% to 10% on  all  production  will  result in the tax to  GDP ratio of 
9:384:24234:12:11:70:525:659:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:around 8%. Moreover, with the removal of interest expense from the income statement of all enterprises, 
9:385:24338:11:11:70:464:648:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:the taxable income of all enterprises will increase, resulting in an increase in tax collection.

9:387:24436:11:11:70:525:626:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:In the system of Zakah, the tax exemption amount is very low on cash and capital in excess of need i.e. 
9:388:24540:11:11:70:525:615:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:612  gram  silver  which results in increase  in  taxable  income and tax collection. The 2-½%  wealth tax  on 
9:389:24650:11:12:70:525:604:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:cash and capital in a country will be adequate enough in attaining the total Zakah/GDP ratio of more than

9:392:24765:11:11:70:525:570:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Moreover,   such   a   lenient   taxation   structure   will   itself   increase   productive   activities,   employment

9:397:25141:11:11:70:528:514:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:through  the  private  sector.  The  income  from  those  public  enterprises  will  not  only  put  a  check  on  the 
9:398:25260:11:11:70:525:503:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:private  sector  but  also  achieve  the  social  objectives,  such  as  reducing  inequality  of  income.  Industry 
9:399:25376:11:12:70:525:492:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:specific studies can be undertaken to determine which industries must be kept in public sector and which 
9:400:25481:12:11:70:525:480:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:must be privatized. Since the fiscal incentives are attractive enough to lure foreign investors, they can be 
9:401:25590:11:11:70:525:469:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:asked to buy at least one loss incurring public enterprise with a cash cow enterprise. A hefty license fee 
9:402:25697:11:11:70:525:458:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:can  be  charged  to  generate  fiscal  space  for  subsidizing  the  public  sector  enterprises  and  turning  them 
9:403:25814:11:11:70:108:447:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:around.

9:405:25823:12:11:70:525:424:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:A Natural Monopoly provides an important necessity to masses. We call it natural because of the peculiar 
9:406:25928:11:11:70:525:413:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:nature of that industry  which  requires heavy capital  expenditure. Now,  when  more firms enter a market, 
9:407:26035:11:11:70:525:402:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:market share gets divided, but not the capital expenditure. For that capital expenditure to be recovered, a 
9:408:26143:11:11:70:528:391:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:firm  needs  volume  and  economies  of  scale.  Therefore,  market  in  that  situation  "naturally"  needs  to  be 
9:409:26260:11:27:70:132:380:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:concentrated. 
9:410:26274:27:11:70:525:353:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:When a Natural Monopoly is privatized, the market at best can be oligopolistic. There is no problem with 
9:411:26379:11:12:70:525:342:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:oligopolistic markets in usual if the demand for the products is elastic. But, if it is inelastic, as is the case 
9:412:26493:12:11:70:525:330:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:for products of a Natural Monopoly, the oligopoly would run into cartelization or by the application of game 
9:413:26602:11:11:70:525:319:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:theory  would  again  turn  into  a  monopoly.  The  size  of  the  pie  can  hardly  be  increased  because  the 
9:414:26716:11:11:70:525:308:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:demand is  inelastic. Since  the demand is  inelastic, the decrease  in  price  will  decrease revenue  and  not 
9:415:26829:11:27:70:483:297:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:increase it assuming that the products are not exportable i.e. market size can not be increased.  
9:416:26927:27:11:70:525:270:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Therefore, competition in such a market may not depress prices, it will (even if number of firms increase 
9:417:27033:11:12:70:525:259:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:in  short  run)  result  in  exit  of  firms  to  once  again  make  market  oligopolistic.  But,  the  market  will  not  be 
9:418:27159:12:11:70:525:247:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:stagnant as an oligopoly as the demand is inelastic, it will either result in cartels or in monopoly after firms 
9:419:27272:11:11:70:525:236:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:try to predict other firms' behavior and make strategic choices. That is why, a Natural Monopoly exists in 
9:420:27379:11:27:70:447:225:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:industries which produce an important necessity, but require heavy capital expenditure. 
9:421:27467:27:11:70:525:198:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Privatization  of  a  natural  monopoly in  "developing countries"  raises few  questions  as  in  most  developed 
9:422:27582:11:11:70:525:187:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:countries;  there  is  less  inequality  in  infrastructure,  income,  wealth,  job opportunities  than  developing 
9:423:27698:11:12:70:525:176:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:countries  in  South  America,  Africa  and  South  Asia. Therefore,  in  developed  countries,  the  whole 
9:424:27806:12:11:70:525:164:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:operations can be subdivided and sold in pieces to individual companies. But, in a developing country like 
9:425:27913:11:11:70:526:153:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Pakistan, hardly any  body  would be  willing to buy an  electric  company  in NWFP and  Baluchistan  where 
9:426:28021:11:11:70:525:142:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:line  losses  and  significantly  different  infrastructure  facilities,  law  and  order  situation  and  dispersed 
9:427:28138:11:11:70:525:131:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:population  exists.  Therefore,  operations  of  a  giant  big  Monopoly  can  not  be  easily  divided  and  sold  in 
9:428:28256:11:11:70:525:120:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:pieces. Some can be sold, but not all divisions can be sold. If government takes over those pieces, then it 
9:429:28364:11:0:70:525:109:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:will  be  more  inefficient  with  less  profitable  business  divisions  than  having  all  mixed  up  in  one  big 
10:430:28481:0:12:70:525:727:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:corporation.  In  addition  to  that,  a  Natural  Monopoly  can adjust losses from  one  with  profits from  another 
10:431:28599:12:11:70:525:715:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:division.  It  can  fulfill  deficiencies  internally.  If  some  divisions  remain  unsold,  the  less profitable  divisions 
10:432:28725:11:11:70:525:704:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:will have to fill the gap paying the market price than just a mere transfer of shortfall from one division to 
10:433:28835:11:11:70:525:693:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:another as  in Natural Monopoly. This will further increase the gap between profitable and less profitable 
10:434:28942:11:11:70:525:682:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:divisions  and  eventually  it  will  once  again  become a  consolidated  industry  and  may  even  become  a 
10:435:29053:11:27:70:118:671:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:monopoly. 
10:436:29063:27:11:70:525:644:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:In  that  case, a  Natural  Monopoly  is  better  off  being  in  Public  ownership  and  hence  the  concept  'Public 
10:437:29181:11:12:70:526:633:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Monopoly'.  The  only  thing  forgone  is  tax  revenue.  But,  it  comes  if  it  is  profitable.  If  it  is  profitable,  then, 
10:438:29312:12:11:70:525:621:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:profits do overcome taxes.  Tax revenue can not be greater than profits. Further, the government avoids 
10:439:29415:11:11:70:525:610:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:regulation. Moreover, in developing countries, this huge capital expenditure would usually be provided by 
10:440:29521:11:27:70:482:599:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:foreign companies. They can repatriate profits and hence will increase capital flight.                    
10:441:29627:27:11:70:525:572:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:In  other  cases, we  can  give  private  sector  the  chance  to  lead  the  economy.  In  the  proposed  model, 
10:442:29741:11:11:70:525:561:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Defense, Communication, Transport, Education and Health would be run in Public sector as is the case in 
10:443:29845:11:12:70:525:550:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:most  other  countries  too.  In  other  sectors,  government can  either  privatize or  give  operating  rights  to 
10:444:29962:12:27:70:306:538:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:private sector and retaining ownership to some extent. 
10:445:30017:27:11:70:527:511:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Privatization would  increase  layoffs  and  increase  structural  unemployment.  Structural  unemployment  is 
10:446:30128:11:11:70:525:500:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:classified  as natural  in  Economics. The government is only responsible to  avoid  cyclical unemployment. 
10:447:30235:11:11:70:525:489:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Structural unemployment  requires  education  to  be  in  Public  sector  and  subsidized.  Scandinavian  and 
10:448:30345:11:11:70:525:478:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:many European countries have an efficient public sector education system. It is subsidized and it needs 
10:449:30449:11:12:70:525:467:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:to be subsidized to enable people to change their fortunes after structural unemployment. In the time lag 
10:450:30555:12:11:70:525:455:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:between the change of fortunes, they also need subsidized health facilities and hence health should also 
10:451:30660:11:11:70:525:444:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:be in public sector. Private education system and health can run in tandem with public sector. But, some 
10:452:30765:11:27:70:280:433:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:education and health must exist in public sector. 
10:453:30815:27:11:70:525:406:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:One  possible  question  may  arise  here  as  to  how  such  lenient  tax  rates  would  increase  revenue.  If  the 
10:454:30933:11:11:70:527:395:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:government has a fiscal deficit of 7% of GDP when corporate tax rates are 35%; then, how can reducing 
10:455:31035:11:11:70:209:384:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:tax rates increase the revenue? 
10:456:31067:11:12:70:73:373:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
10:457:31067:12:11:70:525:361:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:The answer to this is that higher tax rates discourage entrepreneurship as they decrease the incentive to 
10:458:31173:11:11:70:525:350:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:produce.  Lower  tax  rates  encourage  entrepreneurship  and  hence  increase  the  size  of  producing  sector 
10:459:31286:11:11:70:525:339:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:and hence production. With the increase in production, tax revenue in amount increases. Lower tax rates 
10:460:31390:11:11:70:525:328:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:can still ensure high tax to GDP ratio. This is evident from Table 6 which lists countries with corporate tax 
10:461:31500:11:12:70:260:317:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:rates below 20% and their tax to GDP ratio.

11:528:34084:11:11:70:525:148:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:checks. Therefore, private sectors including both local and foreign investors have an essential role to play 
11:529:34193:11:11:70:525:137:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:in achieving the desired growth and development targets. The goal is not only to redistribute the pie, but 
11:530:34300:11:11:70:187:126:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:to increase the pie is well.

12:533:34434:12:11:70:525:715:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:for  reinvestment  and  profit  distribution  among  shareholders  i.e.  dividend.  Since  the  proposed  economic 
12:534:34548:11:11:70:525:704:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:framework is holistic, the monetary policy effect of discontinuing interest-based products will make savers 
12:535:34656:11:11:70:528:693:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:go  for  equity  investments  and  the  whole  economy  will  gradually  transform  from  debt-based  financing  to 
12:536:34772:11:11:70:176:682:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:equity-based financing.

12:538:34797:12:11:70:525:659:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Dealing  with  risk  averse  investors  is  also  a  major issue.  Here, the  credit  rating  agencies  will  have  a  big 
12:539:34920:11:11:70:525:648:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:and active role to play in providing timely information and fact based forecasts. However, what will make it 
12:540:35029:11:11:70:525:637:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:all possible is the massive inflow of FDI1 because of tax advantage. This will increase the competition and 
12:541:35137:11:11:70:525:626:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:convert   the   major   oligopolistic2   industries   into   more   competitive   industries.   Therefore,   sectoral 
12:542:35255:11:11:70:310:615:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:diversification will be possible for risk averse investors.  
12:543:35316:11:12:70:73:604:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica: 
12:544:35316:12:11:70:526:592:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:It  can  be  seen  from  fiscal  models  presented  above  that  if  any  form  of  wealth  i.e.  property,  fixed  asset, 
12:545:35439:11:11:70:525:581:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:cash  etc  is  put  into  investment,  its  nature  for  fiscal  treatment  changes  and  tax  saving  of  at  least  2.5% 
12:546:35562:11:11:70:525:570:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:results  on the  gross investment i.e. if there is no  income  on  investment, 2.5% tax  saving results and no 
12:547:35673:11:11:70:264:559:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:income tax is paid since there is no income.

12:550:35833:11:11:70:525:525:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:provided  with fiscal  incentives, investment both local  and foreign  is  expected to  increase, bringing more 
12:551:35945:11:11:70:525:514:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:employment,  making  industries  competitive  and  hence  more  responsive  to  their  stakeholders  i.e.

12:559:36339:12:11:70:241:424:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:A simplified model is presented below:

12:569:36579:11:11:70:525:305:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:If the shareholder does not want to sell the stock, but still wants to benefit from the fiscal incentive, he can 
12:570:36692:11:12:70:525:294:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:keep  and  pay  tax  on  dividend.  Purchase  of  stocks  for  capital  gain/dividend  will  be  considered  an 
12:571:36804:12:11:70:525:282:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:investment and hence instead of wealth tax, income tax will be charged. 10% income tax will be charged 
12:572:36906:11:11:70:330:271:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:on dividend income.  A simplified model is presented below:

13:588:37471:11:11:70:526:704:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:The  fiscal  incentives  provided  will  bring  in  investment  from  local  as  well  as  foreign  investors  and  the 
13:589:37591:11:11:70:525:693:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:discontinuation of interest based  investment avenues will make equity financing by companies possible. 
13:590:37694:11:11:70:526:682:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:Therefore,  those  commercial  enterprises  with  own  funds  will  come  for  fiscal  incentives  and  those

13:593:37914:11:11:70:527:648:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:It  will  transform  the  oligopolistic  markets  into  competitive  markets.  Hence,  firms  will  not  have  much 
13:594:38030:11:11:70:525:637:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:influence  to  effect  prices.  Therefore,  artificial  price  increases  through  collusion  and  hoarding  will not  be 
13:595:38152:11:11:70:525:626:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:possible. The  other notable driver  of inflation  is the interest rate.  Since the  interest will  be  discontinued, 
13:596:38270:11:11:70:525:615:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:inflation  will not be derived from interest. Therefore, inflation will only increase at the natural rate and its 
13:597:38384:11:12:70:525:604:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:effect will not be felt by common person due to direct taxation since there will not be indirect taxes which 
13:598:38493:12:11:70:528:592:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:inflate  prices  of  inelastic  goods.  Furthermore,  increase  in  investment  and  new  entrants  will  increase

13:620:40030:12:11:70:525:346:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:This unique study discussed the theory of taxation in Islam and the role of Zakat in an Islamic economy. It 
13:621:40138:11:11:70:525:335:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:maintained that Zakat is a compulsory payment  i.e. a tax in this sense  paid  to the government  on one’s 
13:622:40244:11:11:70:525:324:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:income and wealth. The Zakat rates were studied for their viability and effectiveness to fulfill fiscal needs 
13:623:40354:11:12:70:525:313:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:of the government in general and taking the specific case of Pakistan. Based on the evidence from many 
13:624:40456:12:11:70:527:301:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:countries,  it  is  argued  that  Zakat  rates  are  substantial  enough  to  generate  the  needed  public  finance 
13:625:40573:11:11:70:528:290:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:given  the  large  tax  base.  Its  compulsory  nature  both  as  per  law  of  the  land  and  as  per  religion  would 
13:626:40694:11:11:70:525:279:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:ensure minimum  tax evasion and its progressive  and direct nature would effectively  redistribute income. 
13:627:40801:11:12:70:525:268:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:The  effect  of  Zakat  on  the  overall  macroeconomy,  the  financial  system,  monetary  system,  property 
13:628:40911:12:11:70:525:256:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:market,  stock  market,  inflation,  foreign  debt,  balance  of  payments,  FDI  and  the  on  the  development 
13:629:41024:11:11:70:525:245:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:oriented variables like inequality and poverty are also discussed to give a holistic view of the effects of the 
13:630:41136:11:11:70:149:234:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:proposed system.
