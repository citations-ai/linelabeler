2:11:228:24:16:106:189:638:127:Times:127:Times:1. Introduction  
2:12:244:16:13:122:125:622:127:Times:127:Times: 
2:13:244:13:13:106:510:609:127:Times:127:Times:After  three  post  independence  decades  of  insufficient  progress,  India  grew  at  6%  per  
2:14:342:13:13:106:509:596:127:Times:127:Times:annum from 1980 to 2002 and at 7,6% from 2002 through 2007. Its rising path has been 
2:15:427:13:13:106:511:583:127:Times:127:Times:quite  unique:  rather  than  exporting  labor  intensive,  low-priced  manufactured  goods,  
2:16:521:13:13:106:512:570:127:Times:127:Times:India  relied  on  its  domestic  market  more  than  on  exports,  consumption  more  than  
2:17:614:13:13:106:515:557:127:Times:127:Times:investment,   services   more   than   industry   and   high-tech   more   than   low-skilled   
2:18:710:13:13:106:509:544:127:Times:127:Times:manufacturing. Moreover, 30-40% of GDP growth depends on rising productivity rather 
2:19:794:13:13:106:512:531:127:Times:127:Times:than  to  increases  in  the  amount  of  capital  or  labor.  Bosworth  and  Collins  (2007)  
2:20:889:13:13:106:510:518:127:Times:127:Times:document that, over the period 1993-2004, 2.3% of the growth (out of a total of 6.5%) 
2:21:975:13:13:106:509:505:127:Times:127:Times:was accounted for by productivity changes. This suggests that India’s reforms processes 
2:22:1063:13:13:106:510:492:127:Times:127:Times:has  been  able  to  obtain  results  in  terms  of  better  incentives  and  competition,  inducing  
2:23:1165:13:13:106:246:479:127:Times:127:Times:improvements in productivity. 
2:24:1195:13:13:106:509:466:127:Times:127:Times:As for Indian banking, it has lived three phases, so far. The first one (before 1969), was 
2:25:1286:13:13:106:510:453:127:Times:127:Times:dominated by private ownership. The government nationalized most banks in 1969 and 
2:26:1369:13:13:106:509:440:127:Times:127:Times:in 1980, and imposed quantitative targets and tight administrative constraints. Financial 
2:27:1459:13:13:106:515:427:127:Times:127:Times:liberalization   started   in   1992,   with   reforms   aimed   at   increasing   stability   and   
2:28:1560:13:13:106:510:414:127:Times:127:Times:competitiveness.  India  is  now  on  track  to  create  a  modern  financial  system.  Skeptics,  
2:29:1659:13:13:106:513:401:127:Times:127:Times:though,  point  to  the  still  high  weight  of  the  public  sector,  the  major  remaining  
2:30:1754:13:13:106:509:388:127:Times:127:Times:constraints relate to foreign ownership and statutory priority lending and the remaining 
2:31:1843:13:13:106:515:375:127:Times:127:Times:indications   of   credit   exclusion   (the   words   ‘credit’   and   ‘advances’   are   used   
2:32:1941:13:24:106:193:362:127:Times:127:Times:interchangeably).   
2:33:1961:24:16:106:300:338:127:Times:127:Times:2. From protectionism to liberalization 
2:34:2000:16:13:106:510:322:127:Times:127:Times:Indian growth averaged 3,5% from 1950 to 1980. In this so called ‘Hindu’ growth rate 
2:35:2085:13:13:106:510:309:127:Times:127:Times:period, India adopted an import substitution and infant industry strategy. India pursued 
2:36:2174:13:13:106:514:296:127:Times:127:Times:nationalization   in   many   sectors   (including   banking),   high   public   investment   in   
2:37:2273:13:13:106:512:283:127:Times:127:Times:infrastructure  and  implemented  a  centralized  planning  strategy.  Such  an  approach  
2:38:2364:13:13:106:510:270:127:Times:127:Times:yielded  good  growth  rates  during  1951-1964:  about  4.3%.  Nonetheless,  from  1965  to  
2:39:2458:13:13:106:510:257:127:Times:127:Times:1980,  growth  slowed  down  significantly  (annual  GDP  growth  averaged  2.9%),  in  part  
2:40:2552:13:13:106:509:244:127:Times:127:Times:due to the failure of the centralized planning strategy, other than to external factors such 
2:41:2645:13:13:106:510:231:127:Times:127:Times:as  drought  and  ‘oil  shocks’.  The  economy  had,  in  fact,  become  overtly  controlled  and  
2:42:2744:13:13:106:511:218:127:Times:127:Times:rigid  and  largely  closed  to  international  trade  and  investment;  such  a  development  
2:43:2839:13:13:106:511:205:127:Times:127:Times:strategy  implied  that  entrepreneurship  was  heavily  constrained.  That  was  no  longer  
2:44:2933:13:13:106:296:192:127:Times:127:Times:acceptable in a rapidly globalizing world. 
2:45:2976:13:13:106:109:179:127:Times:127:Times: 
2:46:2976:13:12:106:511:166:127:Times:127:Times:In  the  early  1980s,  India  embarked  on  a  path  of  economic  reforms  in  the  so-called  
2:47:3073:12:18:106:513:154:127:Times:127:Times:Bharatiya   (meaning,   Indian)   growth   period.   Modest   liberal   reforms   –   especially

2:52:3549:11:10:106:509:92:89:Times:89:Times:paper are purely personal. This is an earlier draft of the paper which has been subsequently published in 
2:53:3655:10:0:106:359:82:89:Times:89:Times:the book titled Emerging Banking System by Palgrace MacMillan.  
3:54:3720:0:13:106:510:701:127:Times:127:Times:lowering  marginal  tax  rates  and  tariffs  and  providing  some  leeway  to  manufacturers  –  
3:55:3818:13:13:106:512:688:127:Times:127:Times:revived  average  growth  to  5.6%.  A  pro-active  attitude  towards  the  private  sector  
3:56:3911:13:13:106:509:675:127:Times:127:Times:strongly contributed to an improvement in the scenario. Nonetheless, by the start of the 
3:57:4000:13:13:106:509:662:127:Times:127:Times:1990s, profligateness brought India to the brink of a balance of payments crisis with a 
3:58:4088:13:13:106:513:649:127:Times:127:Times:realistic   threat   of   sovereign   default;   fiscal   deficits   increased   significantly,   while   
3:59:4194:13:13:106:510:636:127:Times:127:Times:inflation  crept  up  to  uncomfortable  levels.  These  developments  triggered  wide-ranging  
3:60:4290:13:13:106:511:623:127:Times:127:Times:pro-liberalization  reforms  and  much  more  attention  to  fiscal  health.  All  such  reforms  
3:61:4388:13:13:106:510:610:127:Times:127:Times:laid  the  groundwork  for  increasingly  high  growth  rates,  averaging  6,2%  in  1993-2000  
3:62:4484:13:13:106:231:597:127:Times:127:Times:and over 7,5% since 2003.

3:64:4511:13:13:106:506:571:127:Times:127:Times:Financial sector reform was central. Introduction of some operational autonomy in state-
3:65:4599:13:13:106:511:558:127:Times:127:Times:owned  banks,  entry  of  new  private  and  of  a  greater  number  of  foreign  banks,  and  
3:66:4694:13:13:106:513:545:127:Times:127:Times:(limited)  permission  for  foreign  investment  in  banking  were  some  of  the  major  
3:67:4784:13:13:106:510:532:127:Times:127:Times:measures.  Besides,  prudential  regulation  was  strengthened,  in  line  with  international  
3:68:4880:13:13:106:511:519:127:Times:127:Times:best  practices.  The  capital  market  has  been  revived  with  policy  reforms,  financial  
3:69:4975:13:13:106:509:506:127:Times:127:Times:infrastructure innovation and an improved payment and settlement architecture. Among 
3:70:5060:13:13:106:511:493:127:Times:127:Times:major  interventions,  we  signal  the  1992  abolition  of  the  Controller  of  Capital  Issues  
3:71:5159:13:13:106:513:480:127:Times:127:Times:(CCI),   which   was   in   charge   of   both   controlling   the   issuance   of   securities   and   
3:72:5263:13:13:106:508:467:127:Times:127:Times:administering their price; such reform  liberalized the issuing of corporate bonds and the 
3:73:5354:13:24:106:341:454:127:Times:127:Times:subsequent demutualization of the stock exchange.  
3:74:5405:24:16:106:280:430:127:Times:127:Times:3. The bank nationalization period 
3:75:5439:16:13:106:509:414:127:Times:127:Times:After independence, national savings were low and supplied mainly by households. The 
3:76:5524:13:13:106:510:401:127:Times:127:Times:banking  sector  was  invested  of  a  very  important  intermediation  role.  By  1951,  there  
3:77:5621:13:13:106:510:388:127:Times:127:Times:were  566  banks  in  India.  Nonetheless,  many  rural  and  semi-urban  areas  were  not  well  
3:78:5719:13:13:106:510:375:127:Times:127:Times:serviced. Also, the bulk of credit was directed towards large corporates, at the expense 
3:79:5808:13:13:106:509:362:127:Times:127:Times:of  the  agricultural  and  SMEs.  The  All-India  Rural  Credit  Survey  Committee  reported  
3:80:5903:13:13:106:511:349:127:Times:127:Times:that  out  of  the  total  borrowings  of  farmers  of  about  INR  7.5bn,  commercial  banks  
3:81:5998:13:13:106:484:336:127:Times:127:Times:provided less than 1%, while money lenders accounted for an overwhelming 70%.

4:97:7185:0:13:106:511:701:127:Times:127:Times:Such  features  were  not  in  sync  with  the  national  objective  of  achieving  equitable  
4:98:7280:13:13:106:511:688:127:Times:127:Times:allocation  of  credit.  Therefore,  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  (RBI)  was  envisaged  to  
4:99:7375:13:13:106:512:675:127:Times:127:Times:promote  credit,  with  special  attention  to  agriculture.  Moreover,  since  1967  a  Bill  
4:100:7470:13:13:106:508:662:127:Times:127:Times:imposed extensive social control over banks and banking policy. Banks were required to 
4:101:7557:13:13:106:510:649:127:Times:127:Times:implement the government's objectives of improving banking access of rural areas and 
4:102:7642:13:13:106:510:636:127:Times:127:Times:SMEs.  These  developments  culminated  in  a  two-stage  bank  nationalisation  process,  in  
4:103:7737:13:13:106:510:623:127:Times:127:Times:1969  and  in  1980,  aimed  at  ensuring  that  financial  intermediaries  fully  met  the  credit  
4:104:7838:13:13:106:510:610:127:Times:127:Times:demands  according  to  national  priorities.  In  fact,  political  economy  considerations  and  
4:105:7937:13:13:106:509:597:127:Times:127:Times:borrowers’ needs gained primacy over the financial viability of the banking sector. Such 
4:106:8026:13:13:106:512:584:127:Times:127:Times:choices  were  supported  by  an  intensified  public  control  over  the  financial  system  
4:107:8120:13:13:106:506:571:127:Times:127:Times:through   various   measures   such   as   active   mobilisation   of   savings   through   bank-
4:108:8217:13:13:106:443:558:127:Times:127:Times:dominated network, directed lending, interest rate regulation and the like.

4:110:8294:13:13:106:513:532:127:Times:127:Times:Two   important   facets   of   banking   during   the   post-nationalization   period   deserve   
4:111:8393:13:13:106:510:519:127:Times:127:Times:mention.  The  first  was  ‘priority  sector  lending’:  both  the  State  Bank  of  India,  and  the  
4:112:8496:13:13:106:508:506:127:Times:127:Times:nationalised banks and private banks were required to lend at least a fixed percentage of 
4:113:8586:13:13:106:512:493:127:Times:127:Times:credit  to  agriculture  and  small-scale  industry  (RBI,  1983).  Secondly,  the  branch  
4:114:8678:13:13:106:510:480:127:Times:127:Times:licensing  policy  entailed  banks  to  open  four  branches  in  unbanked  locations  for  every  
4:115:8777:13:13:106:509:467:127:Times:127:Times:branch opened elsewhere. Such policy increased the scope of banking in India to a scale 
4:116:8865:13:13:106:511:454:127:Times:127:Times:unique  to  its  level  of  development:  by  2000,  India  had  over  60,000  bank  branches,  
4:117:8961:13:13:106:509:441:127:Times:127:Times:spanning every district across the country (Table 1). Burgess and Pande (2005) showed 
4:118:9047:13:13:106:510:428:127:Times:127:Times:that  the  re-distributive  nature  of  branch  expansion  led  to  a  substantial  decline  in  rural  
4:119:9151:13:24:106:149:415:127:Times:127:Times:poverty.  
4:120:9161:24:16:106:228:391:127:Times:127:Times:4. The Banking reforms 
4:121:9183:16:13:106:509:375:127:Times:127:Times:The unprecedented balance-of-payments crisis of the early 1990s, coupled with limited 
4:122:9269:13:13:106:509:362:127:Times:127:Times:public resources for investment or provision of public services, rapidly brought forth the 
4:123:9360:13:13:106:509:349:127:Times:127:Times:imperatives for financial sector strengthening. It was recognised that the success of the 
4:124:9450:13:13:106:510:336:127:Times:127:Times:economy  is  contingent  on  a  healthy  financial  system.  India  started  a  banking  sector  
4:125:9547:13:13:106:512:323:127:Times:127:Times:reform  package  in  1992.  The  thrust  of  the  reforms  was  to  promote  a  diversified,  
4:126:9641:13:13:106:514:310:127:Times:127:Times:efficient   and   competitive   financial   system.   Its   first   phase   was   guided   by   the   
4:127:9743:13:13:106:510:297:127:Times:127:Times:recommendations  of  the  Committee  on  the  Financial  System  which  proposed  to  bring  
4:128:9836:13:13:106:510:284:127:Times:127:Times:about “operational flexibility” and “functional autonomy” so as to enhance “efficiency, 
4:129:9924:13:12:106:510:271:127:Times:127:Times:productivity  and  profitability”  (Government  of  India,  1991).  The  second  stage  of  the  
4:130:10021:12:13:106:511:259:127:Times:127:Times:reforms  paid  more  attention  towards  strengthening  the  foundations  of  the  banking  
4:131:10113:13:13:106:457:246:127:Times:127:Times:system and make it internationally competitive (Government of India, 1998). 
4:132:10189:13:13:106:109:233:127:Times:127:Times: 
4:133:10189:13:13:106:510:220:127:Times:127:Times:The  approach  to  reforms  is  based  on  five  principles:  cautious  and  proper  sequencing;  
4:134:10287:13:13:106:511:207:127:Times:127:Times:mutually  reinforcing  measures;  complementarities  between  reforms  in  banking  sector  
4:135:10379:13:13:106:516:194:127:Times:127:Times:and   changes   in   fiscal,   external   and   monetary   policies;   developing   financial   
4:136:10475:13:13:106:508:181:127:Times:127:Times:infrastructure; and developing financial markets. The reforms were carefully sequenced: 
4:137:10563:13:13:106:511:168:127:Times:127:Times:prudential  norms  and  supervisory  strengthening  were  introduced  early,  followed  by  
4:138:10655:13:13:106:509:155:127:Times:127:Times:interest rate deregulation and gradual lowering of statutory preemption, while legal and 
4:139:10744:13:13:106:510:142:127:Times:127:Times:accounting  measures  were  ushered  in  only  when  the  basic  tenets  of  the  reforms  were  
4:140:10841:13:13:106:512:129:127:Times:127:Times:already  in  place.  Concurrently,  a  process  of  gradualism  was  pursued  along  with  a  
4:141:10935:13:13:106:511:116:127:Times:127:Times:process  of  continuous  consultation  with  all  stakeholders:  such  involvement  enhanced  
4:142:11029:13:13:106:512:103:127:Times:127:Times:the  credibility  of  policies  (Ahluwalia,  2002).  Another  positive  feature  has  been  the  
4:143:11126:13:0:106:510:90:127:Times:127:Times:constant  rebalancing  of  priorities  according  to  evolution  of  the  business  environment,  
5:144:11225:0:13:106:509:701:127:Times:127:Times:and  its  harmonization  with  other  policies:  recognising  the  inter-linkages,  wide-ranging  
5:145:11323:13:13:106:511:688:127:Times:127:Times:reforms  were  also  undertaken  in  the  real  sector  so  that  financial  intermediation  kept  
5:146:11422:13:13:106:506:675:127:Times:127:Times:pace with underlying economic activity. Finally, the reforms were characterized by non-
5:147:11509:13:13:106:362:662:127:Times:127:Times:reversals, taking on board the views of all stakeholders.  
5:148:11568:13:13:106:109:649:127:Times:127:Times: 
5:149:11568:13:13:106:512:636:127:Times:127:Times:At  the  same  time,  the  weight  of  the  public  sector  in  banking  has  been  reduced.  
5:150:11662:13:13:106:514:623:127:Times:127:Times:Moreover,   the   ownership   base   in   state-owned   banks   has   been   diversified.   The   
5:151:11760:13:13:106:509:610:127:Times:127:Times:regulations  were  amended  to  enable  these  banks  to  raise  private  capital,  not  exceeding  
5:152:11860:13:13:106:509:597:127:Times:127:Times:49% of their equity, in order for the government to retain majority shareholding. Equity 
5:153:11949:13:13:106:511:584:127:Times:127:Times:sales  in  the  market  aggregating  around  INR.180bn  (US  $4.5bn)  have  been  made  by  
5:154:12041:13:13:106:509:571:127:Times:127:Times:these banks, with several banks making subsequent follow-on offerings. Over the period 
5:155:12128:13:13:106:511:558:127:Times:127:Times:1993-2007,  as  many  as  20  state-owned  banks  have  accessed  the  capital  market.  At  
5:156:12221:13:13:106:511:545:127:Times:127:Times:present,  state-owned  banks  with  100%  government  ownership  comprise  only  around  
5:157:12310:13:13:106:500:532:127:Times:127:Times:10% of commercial bank assets compared to around 90% at the beginning of reforms.  
5:158:12393:13:13:106:512:519:127:Times:127:Times:A  set  of  progressively  tighter  micro-prudential  measures  were  instituted,  with  the  
5:159:12487:13:13:106:512:506:127:Times:127:Times:objective  of  benchmarking  against  international  best  practices.  Risk-based  capital  
5:160:12579:13:13:106:508:493:127:Times:127:Times:standards was hiked to 9%. Asset classification into doubtful, sub-standard and standard 
5:161:12668:13:13:106:509:480:127:Times:127:Times:assets and related provisioning requirements were strengthened. Moreover, also rules on 
5:162:12756:13:13:106:512:467:127:Times:127:Times:exposure  limits  for  single  and  group  borrowers,  accounting  rules,  and  investment  
5:163:12848:13:13:106:510:454:127:Times:127:Times:valuation  norms  were  improved.  As  part  of  such  effort,  the  process  of  regulation  and  
5:164:12947:13:13:106:511:441:127:Times:127:Times:supervision  has  been  strengthened  with  a  strategy  of  on-site  inspection  and  off-site  
5:165:13044:13:13:106:509:428:127:Times:127:Times:surveillance, together with greater accountability of external auditors. In such a context, 
5:166:13136:13:13:106:509:415:127:Times:127:Times:the RBI has been focusing on ensuring 'fit and proper' owners and directors of the bank 
5:167:13224:13:13:106:509:402:127:Times:127:Times:(banks have been advised to ensure that a nomination committee screens the nominated 
5:168:13309:13:13:106:404:389:127:Times:127:Times:and elected directors) and laying stress on diversified ownership.  
5:169:13377:13:12:106:109:376:127:Times:127:Times: 
5:170:13377:12:13:106:510:364:127:Times:127:Times:As  for  Basel  II,  banks  will  initially  adopt  Standardized  Approach  for  credit  risk  and  
5:171:13477:13:13:106:510:351:127:Times:127:Times:Basic Indicator Approach for operational risk. From 2008, capital adequacy levels will 
5:172:13564:13:13:106:509:338:127:Times:127:Times:be determined by a three-track approach. On the first track, commercial banks would be 
5:173:13651:13:13:106:512:325:127:Times:127:Times:required  to  maintain  capital  for  both  credit  and  operational  risks  as  per  Basel  II  
5:174:13748:13:13:106:509:312:127:Times:127:Times:framework. The cooperative banks, on the second track, are required to maintain capital 
5:175:13836:13:13:106:509:299:127:Times:127:Times:for credit risk as per Basel I framework and through surrogates for market risk; and the 
5:176:13925:13:13:106:512:286:127:Times:127:Times:regional  rural  banks,  on  the  third  track,  have  a  minimum  capital  requirement.  The  
5:177:14020:13:13:106:511:273:127:Times:127:Times:banking  system  has  also  witnessed  greater  levels  of  transparency  and  standards  of  
5:178:14114:13:13:106:509:260:127:Times:127:Times:disclosure in order to promote greater market discipline in line with the envisaged Basel 
5:179:14204:13:13:106:161:247:127:Times:127:Times:II Accord.

5:181:14217:13:13:106:509:221:127:Times:127:Times:Institutional arrangement to improve supervision and to ensure integrity of payment and 
5:182:14305:13:13:106:511:208:127:Times:127:Times:settlement  systems  has  been  put  in  place.  Key  measures  include  the  institution  of  a  
5:183:14403:13:13:106:511:195:127:Times:127:Times:Board  for  Financial  Supervision  (1994)  in  order  to  ensure  an  integrated  approach  to  
5:184:14500:13:13:106:510:182:127:Times:127:Times:supervision. In order to address the issue of regulatory gaps and overlaps across major 
5:185:14588:13:13:106:508:169:127:Times:127:Times:regulatory authorities, a High Level Co-ordination Committee on Financial and Capital 
5:186:14674:13:13:106:299:156:127:Times:127:Times:Markets has been operational since 1999.

5:188:14716:13:13:106:513:130:127:Times:127:Times:The  legal  infrastructure  has  also  been  strengthened.  For  instance,  corporate  debt  
5:189:14809:13:13:106:509:117:127:Times:127:Times:restructuring process has been improved. Compromise settlements have been introduced 
5:190:14894:13:13:106:510:104:127:Times:127:Times:to  provide  an  opportunity  to  borrowers  for  settlement  of  their  outstanding  dues.  These  
5:191:14994:13:0:106:513:91:127:Times:127:Times:have   been   supplemented   by   Debt   Recovery   Tribunals   (DRTs)   and   Lok   Adalats   
6:192:15090:0:13:106:511:701:127:Times:127:Times:(people’s  court)  for  settling  limited  banking  disputes.  Visaria  (2006)  reports  that  the  
6:193:15190:13:13:106:512:688:127:Times:127:Times:establishment  of  DRTs  significantly  lowered  loan  delinquency.  More  recently,  the

6:195:15373:13:13:106:511:662:127:Times:127:Times:Interest  Act  (2002)  has  allowed  secured  creditors  to  enforce  their  interests  and  take  
6:196:15472:13:13:106:514:649:127:Times:127:Times:possess   of   secured   assets,   in   order   to   improve   loan-recovery   rates.   The   Credit   
6:197:15575:13:13:106:511:636:127:Times:127:Times:Information  Companies  (Regulation)  Act  (2004)  is  expected  to  make  available  credit  
6:198:15669:13:13:106:509:623:127:Times:127:Times:histories of both individuals and small businesses, lower transactions costs and enhance 
6:199:15758:13:13:106:280:610:127:Times:127:Times:the quality of credit decision making.

6:201:15798:13:13:106:509:584:127:Times:127:Times:The net impact of these policy changes is getting reflected in the financial performance 
6:202:15887:13:13:106:513:571:127:Times:127:Times:of  banks  (Table  2).  Overall,  efficiency  and  productivity  has  been  improved  by  
6:203:15977:13:13:106:511:558:127:Times:127:Times:enhancing  competition  (Prasad  and  Ghosh,  2005).  Moreover,  Das  and  Ghosh  (2006)  
6:204:16067:13:13:106:514:545:127:Times:127:Times:report   significant   improvements   in   the   performance   of   state-owned   banks,   post   
6:205:16165:13:13:106:510:532:127:Times:127:Times:liberalization  and  a  gradual  convergence  in  their  performance  with  foreign-owned  and  
6:206:16261:13:13:106:511:519:127:Times:127:Times:new  private  peers.  The  overall  capital  adequacy  ratio  (CAR)  of  commercial  banks,  
6:207:16354:13:13:106:511:506:127:Times:127:Times:which  was  10,4%  in  1996-97  has  since  trended  upwards  to  reach  12,3%  in  2006-07.  
6:208:16448:13:13:106:509:493:127:Times:127:Times:Likewise, improved recovery management and better risk assessment, has resulted in a 
6:209:16533:13:13:106:511:480:127:Times:127:Times:steady  decline  in  the  NPLs  ratio  of  banks,  from  15,7%  in  the  mid-1990s  to  2.7%  in  
6:210:16631:13:13:106:435:467:127:Times:127:Times:2006-07. Such figures compare favorably with other emerging markets.

6:220:17128:24:16:106:336:329:127:Times:127:Times:5. The structure of the Indian banking system  
6:221:17174:16:13:106:511:313:127:Times:127:Times:India's  financial  system  is  broadly  serviced  by  two  major  groups  of  intermediaries:  
6:222:17270:13:13:106:509:300:127:Times:127:Times:banks (commercial and co-operative, Table 3) and financial institutions, which includes 
6:223:17358:13:13:106:510:287:127:Times:127:Times:development  banks  and  the  broadly  defined  non-bank  financial  institutions.  The  focus  
6:224:17454:13:13:106:511:274:127:Times:127:Times:of  this  paragraph  is  on  commercial  banks  which  account  for  over  85%  of  banking  
6:225:17547:13:13:106:509:261:127:Times:127:Times:assets.  As  of  March  2006,  there  were  222  scheduled  commercial  banks,  133  of  which  
6:226:17643:13:13:106:509:248:127:Times:127:Times:were regional rural institutions. Indian law makes no distinction between universal and 
6:227:17731:13:13:106:426:235:127:Times:127:Times:strictly commercial banks and most banks operate as universal banks.

6:229:17801:12:13:106:510:210:127:Times:127:Times:India's  scheduled  commercial  banks  are  the  major  depository  institutions  and  mobilize  
6:230:17898:13:13:106:510:197:127:Times:127:Times:most  of  the  country's  savings.  They  traditionally  provide  short-term  credit  to  meet  the  
6:231:17999:13:13:106:510:184:127:Times:127:Times:working-capital  needs  of  enterprises.  Since  deregulation,  however,  many  of  the  larger

8:296:23231:13:13:106:511:688:127:Times:127:Times:The  traditional  contribution  of  foreign  banks  has  been  to  meet  the  banking  needs  of

8:299:23526:13:13:106:510:649:127:Times:127:Times:border transactions involving trade finance with the larger Indian corporates. Recently,

8:319:25020:13:13:106:508:389:127:g_d0_f10:127:Times:9 Since March 2005, foreign banks could either choose to operate through branches or

8:321:25186:12:13:122:509:364:127:Times:127:Times:WOS status. The WOS will be treated on par with the existing branches of foreign 
8:322:25267:13:13:122:510:351:127:Times:127:Times:banks  for  branch  expansion.  To  allow  Indian  banks  sufficient  time  to  prepare  for  
8:323:25361:13:13:122:511:338:127:Times:127:Times:global  competition,  foreign  banks  M&A  will  be  permitted  only  in  private-sector

8:336:26367:13:13:106:509:169:127:Times:127:Times:So far, in several new private banks, the extent of foreign ownership is over 50%; these 
8:337:26456:13:13:106:510:156:127:Times:127:Times:banks  account  for  roughly  half  of  the  total  assets  of  domestic  private  banks.  Even  in  
8:338:26557:13:13:106:509:143:127:Times:127:Times:several  public-sector-owned  banks,  the  extent  of  foreign  ownership  within  the  private  
8:339:26654:13:13:106:513:130:127:Times:127:Times:holding  is  close  to  that  of  domestic  private  holding.  Moreover,  there  is  selected  
8:340:26749:13:13:106:512:117:127:Times:127:Times:evidence  of  foreign  banks  owning  significant  shares  of  Indian  private  banks.  For  
8:341:26842:13:13:106:513:104:127:Times:127:Times:instance,  Bank  Muscat  International  (Oman)  owns  18,64%  of  Centurion  Bank  of

9:346:27179:13:13:106:510:662:127:Times:127:Times:Notwithstanding  such  evidence,  several  issues  are  still  hampering  a  broader  consensus  
9:347:27276:13:13:106:510:649:127:Times:127:Times:over larger foreign presence in the banking sector: a) a concern about “cherry-picking” 
9:348:27364:13:13:106:513:636:127:Times:127:Times:practices  of  foreign  banks,  which  could  leave  domestic  banks  saddled  with  less  
9:349:27455:13:13:106:512:623:127:Times:127:Times:creditworthy  customers;  b)  the  fact  that  the  supervision  of  the  more  sophisticated  
9:350:27550:13:13:106:511:610:127:Times:127:Times:activities  of  foreign  banks  entails  a  continuous  challenge  for  regulators;  c)  doubts  on  
9:351:27651:13:13:106:510:597:127:Times:127:Times:whether  depositors  in  foreign  banks  would be  entitled  to  receive  the  same  degree  of  
9:352:27747:13:13:106:509:584:127:Times:127:Times:protection as depositors in domestic banks; d) fears that the host country should extend 
9:353:27836:13:13:106:510:571:127:Times:127:Times:the  ‘lender  of  last  resort’  umbrella  to  foreign  banks;  e)  concerns  about  the  still  limited  
9:354:27942:13:13:106:510:558:127:Times:127:Times:dimension and profitability of many Indian banks, which might make them exposed to 
9:355:28025:13:13:106:226:545:127:Times:127:Times:hostile foreign takeovers.

9:358:28094:16:13:106:109:492:127:Times:127:Times: 
9:359:28094:13:13:106:509:479:127:Times:127:Times:As the economy begins to grow rapidly and an increasing number of people migrate out 
9:360:28179:13:13:106:511:466:127:Times:127:Times:of  the  poverty  levels,  the  banking  system  will  have  to  intermediate  large  amounts  of  
9:361:28278:13:13:106:510:453:127:Times:127:Times:funds  than  at  present.  The  ratio  of  bank  asset  to  GDP,  loans  and  deposit  to  GDP  and  
9:362:28379:13:13:106:510:440:127:Times:127:Times:loans  to  deposits,  although  increasing  in  recent  times,  is  still  much  lower  than  in  other  
9:363:28484:13:13:106:512:427:127:Times:127:Times:comparable  bank-based  economies,  which  suggests  significant  scope  for  financial  
9:364:28573:13:13:106:510:414:127:Times:127:Times:deepening.  In  such  a  changed  scenario,  banks  would  need  to  harness  modern  delivery  
9:365:28669:13:13:106:512:401:127:Times:127:Times:mechanisms  that  economize  on  transactions  costs  and  provide  better  access  to  the  
9:366:28762:13:13:106:511:388:127:Times:127:Times:presently  under-served  customers.  This  will  call  for  devising  innovative  channels  for  
9:367:28859:13:13:106:510:375:127:Times:127:Times:credit  delivery  coupled  with  risk-related  pricing  of  products  and  services.  The  role  of  
9:368:28960:13:13:106:463:362:127:Times:127:Times:prudent risk management, in such a situation, can hardly be over-emphasized.  
9:369:29037:13:13:106:109:349:127:Times:127:Times: 
9:370:29037:13:13:106:512:336:127:Times:127:Times:It  is  also  increasingly  recognized  that  large  segments  of  the  rural  population  face  
9:371:29134:13:13:106:510:323:127:Times:127:Times:‘financial  exclusion’  and  continue  their  traditional  dependence  on  the  informal  sector.

9:373:29321:13:13:106:510:297:127:Times:127:Times:that,  India  ranked  24th  in  terms  of  geographic  branch  penetration  (number  of  branches  
9:374:29420:13:13:106:510:284:127:Times:127:Times:per  1000  sq.  kms)  with  a  figure  of  22.6  and  59th  in  terms  of  demographic  penetration  
9:375:29521:13:12:106:510:271:127:Times:127:Times:(number  of  branches  per  100000  people)  with  a  figure  of  6.3,  whereas  the  highest  for

9:377:29717:13:13:106:509:246:127:Times:127:Times:Government-appointed Committee on Financial Inclusion (Chairman: Dr.C.Rangarajan) 
9:378:29799:13:13:106:510:233:127:Times:127:Times:in its Report in 2008 notes that, 45.9 million farmer households in the country out of a 
9:379:29888:13:13:106:506:220:127:Times:127:Times:total  of  89.3  million  households  do  not  access  credit,  either  from  institutional  or  non-
9:380:29989:13:13:106:514:207:127:Times:127:Times:institutional   sources.   The   challenge   remains   for   developing   appropriate   policies,   
9:381:30089:13:13:106:509:194:127:Times:127:Times:procedures and products that can overcome this difficulty within the bounds of resource 
9:382:30177:13:13:106:509:181:127:Times:127:Times:constraints. Some of the challenges which need to be effectively addressed include lack 
9:383:30265:13:13:106:513:168:127:Times:127:Times:of  adequate  infrastructure  in  rural  areas,  relatively  low  volumes  of  transactions,  
9:384:30359:13:13:106:510:155:127:Times:127:Times:comparatively  higher  transaction  costs,  and  other  factors  such  as  the  literacy  levels  of  
9:385:30461:13:13:106:189:142:127:Times:127:Times:target customers.

9:387:30480:13:13:106:512:116:127:Times:127:Times:In  order  to  facilitate  a  deeper  financial  system  and  a  wider  inclusion,  technology  
9:388:30576:13:13:106:509:103:127:Times:127:Times:upgrading of the Indian banking system is crucial. In effect, technology has become the 
9:389:30664:13:0:106:509:90:127:Times:127:Times:key to servicing all customer segments – offering convenience to the retail customer and 
10:390:30754:0:13:106:510:701:127:Times:127:Times:operating  efficiencies  to  corporates  and  government  clients.  Moreover,  the  increasing  
10:391:30850:13:13:106:509:688:127:Times:127:Times:sophistication, flexibility and complexity of products and servicing offerings makes the 
10:392:30939:13:13:106:511:675:127:Times:127:Times:effective  use  of  technology  critical  for  managing  the  risks  associated  with  banking  
10:393:31035:13:13:106:510:662:127:Times:127:Times:business.  However,  the  ‘technological  penetration’  in  India  has  been  quite  modest:  the  
10:394:31134:13:13:106:510:649:127:Times:127:Times:percentage  of  ‘computer  literate’  employees  as  ratio  of  total  staff  in  2000  was  around  
10:395:31235:13:13:106:510:636:127:Times:127:Times:20%  in  public  sector  banks  compared  with  100  per  cent  in  new  private  and  around  90  
10:396:31334:13:13:106:511:623:127:Times:127:Times:per  cent  in  foreign  banks  (RBI,  2002).  The  challenge,  therefore,  remains  three  fold:  
10:397:31432:13:13:106:510:610:127:Times:127:Times:acquiring  the  ‘right’  technology,  deploying  it  optimally  and  remaining  cost-effective  
10:398:31528:13:13:106:509:597:127:Times:127:Times:whilst  delivering  sustainable  returns  to  shareholders.  In  effect,  ‘managing’  technology  
10:399:31626:13:13:106:513:584:127:Times:127:Times:to  achieve  and  maintain  high  service  and  efficiency  standards  so  as  to  reap  the  
10:400:31720:13:13:106:310:571:127:Times:127:Times:maximum benefits remains a key challenge.

10:402:31763:24:16:106:179:534:127:Times:127:Times:7. Conclusion 
10:403:31776:16:13:106:509:518:127:Times:127:Times:To  sum  up,  the  Indian  financial  system  has  undertaken  several  important  steps  on  the  
10:404:31875:13:13:106:513:505:127:Times:127:Times:road  towards  a  modern  and  efficient  financial  system,  which  can  be  a  positive  
10:405:31966:13:13:106:509:492:127:Times:127:Times:contributor to its economic development. This is in line with the philosophy itself of the 
10:406:32057:13:13:106:509:479:127:Times:127:Times:gradualist Indian financial reforms process. Nonetheless, many steps are to be done, yet. 
10:407:32147:13:13:106:512:466:127:Times:127:Times:Among  the  many  issues,  development  of  a  domestic  market  for  corporate  debt  is  
10:408:32238:13:13:106:512:453:127:Times:127:Times:crucial.  Developing  a  debt  market  can  in  turn  provide  corporates  with  alternative  
10:409:32332:13:13:106:512:440:127:Times:127:Times:sources  of  financing  and  complete  the  scope  of  the  financial  market  with  positive  
10:410:32427:13:13:106:510:427:127:Times:127:Times:spillover  on  its  resilience  from  financial  crises  and  ‘’sudden  stops’  in  financial  flows  
10:411:32529:13:13:106:509:414:127:Times:127:Times:from abroad. An easier access of foreign investors in Indian banks (already planned by

10:413:32714:13:13:106:509:388:127:Times:127:Times:priority lending could, finally, instill further competition in the market and be important
