2:35:1953:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:In  many  growth  models,  economic  growth  arises  from  people  creating  ideas,  and  the  long-run 
2:36:2057:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:growth rate  is  the  product  of  two  terms:  the  effective  number  of  researchers  and  their  research 
2:37:2166:14:14:71:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:productivity. We  present  a  wide  range  of  evidence  from  various  industries,  products,  and  firms 
2:38:2272:14:14:71:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:showing  that  research effort  is  rising  substantially  while  research  productivity  is  declining 
2:39:2375:14:14:71:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:sharply.  A  good  example  is  Moore's Law.  The  number  of  researchers  required  today  to  achieve 
2:40:2479:14:14:71:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:the  famous  doubling  every  two  years  of the  density  of  computer  chips  is  more  than  18  times 
2:41:2584:14:14:71:546:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:larger  than  the  number  required  in  the  early  1970s. Across  a  broad  range  of  case  studies  at 
2:42:2690:14:14:71:545:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:various levels of (dis)aggregation, we find that ideas — and in particular the exponential growth 
2:43:2787:14:14:71:545:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:they  imply  —  are  getting  harder  and  harder  to  find.  Exponential growth  results  from  the  large 
2:44:2894:14:28:72:379:462:12:Times:12:Times:C:increases in research effort that offset its declining productivity.

3:73:3487:32:18:94:518:655:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:This paper applies the growth accounting ofSolow(1957) to the production function
3:74:3568:18:19:94:518:637:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for new ideas. The basic insight can be explained with a simple equation, highlighting
3:75:3654:19:34:94:494:618:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a stylized view of economic growth that emerges from idea-based growth models:

3:83:3820:34:19:94:518:519:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Economic  growth  arises  from  people  creating  ideas.   As  a  matter  of  accounting,  we
3:84:3913:19:19:94:518:500:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:can decompose the long-run growth rate into the product of two terms:  the effective
3:85:3997:19:19:94:518:481:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:number of researchers and their research productivity. We present a wide range of em-
3:86:4082:19:18:94:518:462:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:pirical evidence showing that in many contexts and at various levels of disaggregation,
3:87:4169:18:19:94:518:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:research effort is rising substantially, while research productivity is declining sharply.
3:88:4259:19:19:94:471:425:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Steady growth, when it occurs, results from the offsetting of these two trends.
3:89:4338:19:19:111:518:406:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Perhaps the best example of this finding comes from Moore’s Law, one of the key
3:90:4417:19:19:94:518:387:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:drivers of economic growth in recent decades.  This “law” refers to the empirical reg-
3:91:4503:19:19:94:518:368:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ularity that the number of transistors packed onto a computer chip doubles approxi-
3:92:4586:19:19:94:518:349:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:mately every two years.  Such doubling corresponds to a constant exponential growth
3:93:4669:19:19:94:518:330:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rate of around 35% per year, a rate that has been remarkably steady for nearly half a
3:94:4754:19:19:94:518:311:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:century.   As  we  show  in  detail  below,  this  growth  has  been  achieved  by  engaging  an
3:95:4850:19:19:94:518:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ever-growing number of researchers to push Moore’s Law forward.  In particular,  the
3:96:4934:19:19:94:518:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:number  of  researchers  required  to  double  chip  density  today  is  more  than  18  times
3:97:5028:19:19:94:518:254:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:larger than the number required in the early 1970s.  At least as far as semiconductors
3:98:5114:19:19:94:518:235:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are concerned,  ideas are getting harder and harder to find.   Research productivity in
3:99:5201:19:19:94:447:216:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:this case is declining sharply, at a rate that averages about 6.8% per year.
3:100:5277:19:19:111:518:197:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We document qualitatively similar results throughout the U.S. economy.  We con-
3:101:5356:19:19:94:525:178:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sider detailed microeconomic evidence on idea production functions, focusing on places
3:102:5442:19:19:94:518:159:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:where we can get the best measures of both the output of ideas and the inputs used to
3:103:5527:19:19:94:518:140:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:produce them.  In addition to Moore’s Law, our case studies include agricultural pro-
3:104:5612:19:19:94:518:121:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ductivity (corn, soybeans, cotton, and wheat) and medical innovations.  Research pro-
3:105:5697:19:19:94:518:102:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ductivity for seed yields declines at about 5% per year. We find a similar rate of decline
3:106:5787:19:0:94:518:83:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:when studying the mortality improvements associated with cancer and heart disease.
4:107:5903:0:19:94:518:686:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Finally,  we  examine  firm-level  data  from  Compustat  to  provide  another  perspective.
4:108:5995:19:19:94:518:667:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:While the data quality from this sample is not as good as for our case studies, the latter
4:109:6085:19:19:94:518:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:suffer from possibly not being representative. We find substantial heterogeneity across
4:110:6172:19:19:94:518:629:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:firms, but research productivity is declining in more than 85% of our sample. Averaging
4:111:6259:19:19:94:467:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:across firms, research productivity declines at a rate of around 10% per year.
4:112:6337:19:19:111:518:591:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Perhaps research productivity is declining sharply within every particular case that
4:113:6421:19:19:94:518:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:we look at and yet not declining for the economy as a whole.  While existing varieties
4:114:6507:19:19:94:518:553:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:run into diminishing returns, perhaps new varieties are always being invented to stave
4:115:6593:19:19:94:518:534:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:this off.  We consider this possibility by taking it to the extreme.  Suppose each variety
4:116:6683:19:19:94:518:515:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:has a productivity that cannot be improved at all, and instead aggregate growth pro-
4:117:6767:19:19:94:518:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ceeds entirely by inventing new varieties.  To examine this case, we consider research
4:118:6853:19:19:94:518:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:productivity for the economy as a whole. We once again find that it is declining sharply:
4:119:6942:19:19:94:518:458:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:aggregate growth rates are relatively stable over time,1while the number of researchers
4:120:7029:19:19:94:518:439:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:has risen enormously. In fact, this is simply another way of looking at the original point
4:121:7119:19:19:94:518:420:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of Jones(1995),  and for this reason,  we present this application first to illustrate our
4:122:7209:19:19:94:518:401:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:methodology.  We find that research productivity for the aggregate U.S. economy has
4:123:7292:19:19:94:518:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:declined by a factor of 41 since the 1930s,  an average decrease of more than 5% per
4:124:7376:19:19:94:117:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:year.
4:125:7381:19:19:111:518:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:This is a good place to explain why we think looking at the macro data is insufficient
4:126:7467:19:19:94:518:325:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and why studying the idea production function at the micro level is crucial; Section 3
4:127:7553:19:19:94:518:306:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:below  discusses  this  issue  in  more  detail.   The  overwhelming  majority  of  papers  on

4:130:7812:19:19:94:518:249:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:productivity is an observation first made in the late 1990s by a series of papers written
4:131:7901:19:19:94:517:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in  response  to  the  aggregate  evidence.3These  papers  highlighted  that  composition
4:132:7990:19:19:94:518:211:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:effects could render the aggregate evidence misleading: perhaps research productivity
4:133:8075:19:19:94:518:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:at the micro level is actually stable.  The rise in aggregate research could apply to an
4:134:8163:19:14:107:518:173:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:1There  is  a  debate  over  whether  the  slower  rates  of  growth  over  the  last  decade  are  a  temporary
4:135:8275:14:11:94:518:159:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:phenomenon due to the global financial crisis, or a sign of slowing technological progress. Gordon (2016)
4:136:8380:11:11:94:518:148:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:argues  that  the  strong  US  productivity  growth  between  1996  and  2004  was  a  temporary  blip  and  that
4:137:8493:11:11:94:518:137:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:productivity growth will, at best, return to the lower growth rates of 1973–1996. Although we do not need
4:138:8598:11:11:94:518:126:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:to take a stance on this, note that if frontier TFP growth really has slowed down, this only strengthens our
4:139:8706:11:8:94:136:115:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:argument.

5:145:9123:19:19:94:518:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:themselves — are constant.  The aggregate evidence, then, may tell us nothing about
5:146:9206:19:19:94:518:629:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:research productivity at the micro level.  Hence the contribution of this paper:  study

5:149:9413:19:19:111:518:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Not only is this question interesting in its own right, but it is also informative about
5:150:9501:19:19:94:518:553:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the kind of models that we use to study economic growth.   Despite large declines in

5:152:9673:19:19:94:518:515:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the cases we study (and in the aggregate U.S. economy). How is this possible? Look-

5:154:9846:19:19:94:518:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:must be offset by increased research effort, and this is indeed what we find. Moreover,
5:155:9933:19:19:94:518:458:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:we  suggest  at  the  end  of  the  paper  that  the  rapid  declines  in  research  productivity
5:156:10030:19:19:94:518:439:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that  we  see  in  semiconductors,  for  example,  might  be  precisely  due  to  the  fact  that
5:157:10127:19:19:94:518:420:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:research effort is rising so sharply.  Because it gets harder to find new ideas as research
5:158:10218:19:19:94:518:401:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:progresses, a sustained and massive expansion of research like we see in semiconduc-
5:159:10302:19:19:94:518:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tors (for example, because of the “general purpose technology” nature of information
5:160:10386:19:19:94:483:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:technology) may lead to a substantial downward trend in research productivity.
5:161:10464:19:19:111:518:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Others have also provided evidence suggesting that ideas may be getting harder to

5:168:11067:19:19:94:518:211:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to the point where researchers are capable of pushing the frontier forward. We see our
5:169:11153:19:18:94:518:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:evidence as complementary to these earlier studies but more focused on drawing out
5:170:11235:18:19:94:285:174:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the tight connections to growth theory.
5:171:11274:19:19:111:518:155:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.  Section 2 lays out our concep-
5:172:11357:19:19:94:518:136:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tual framework and presents the aggregate evidence on research productivity to illus-
5:173:11442:19:19:94:518:117:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:trate our methodology. Section 3 places this framework in the context of growth theory
5:174:11528:19:0:94:518:98:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and suggests that applying the framework to micro data is crucial for understanding the
6:175:11649:0:19:94:518:686:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:nature of economic growth.  Sections 4 through 7 consider our applications to Moore’s
6:176:11734:19:19:94:518:667:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Law,  agricultural yields,  medical technologies,  and Compustat firms.   Section 8 then
6:177:11822:19:56:94:501:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:revisits the implications of our findings for growth theory, and Section 9 concludes.

6:180:11981:29:19:94:518:529:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:An equation at the heart of many growth models is an idea production function taking
6:181:12065:19:11:94:180:510:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a particular form:

6:185:12097:28:19:94:518:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Classic examples includeRomer(1990) andAghion and Howitt(1992), but many recent
6:186:12176:19:19:94:518:442:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:papers follow this approach,  includingAghion,  Akcigit and Howitt(2014),Acemoglu
6:187:12257:19:19:94:518:423:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and Restrepo(2016), Akcigit, Celik and Greenwood(2016b), andJones and Kim(2018).
6:188:12337:19:19:94:518:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In the equation above, ̇At/Atis total factor productivity growth in the economy.  The
6:189:12422:19:19:94:518:385:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:variableSt(think “scientists”) is some measure of research input, such as the number
6:190:12506:19:19:94:518:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of researchers. This equation then says that the growth rate of the economy — through
6:191:12591:19:19:94:468:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the production of new ideas — is proportional to the number of researchers.
6:192:12666:19:19:111:518:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Relating ̇At/Atto ideas runs into the familiar problem that ideas are hard to mea-
6:193:12748:19:19:94:518:309:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sure.  Even as simple a question as “What are the units of ideas?”  is troublesome.  We
6:194:12835:19:19:94:518:290:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:follow  much  of  the  literature  —  includingAghion  and  Howitt(1992),Grossman  and
6:195:12921:19:19:94:518:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Helpman(1991), andKortum(1997) — and define ideas to be in units so that a constant
6:196:13004:19:19:94:518:252:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:flow of new ideas leads to constant exponential growth inA.  For example, each new
6:197:13086:19:19:94:518:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:idea  raises  incomes  by  a  constant  percentage  (on  average),  rather  than  by  a  certain
6:198:13182:19:19:94:518:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:number  of  dollars.   This  is  the  standard  approach  in  the  quality  ladder  literature  on
6:199:13280:19:19:94:518:195:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:growth: ideas are proportional improvements in productivity.  The patent statistics for
6:200:13367:19:19:94:518:176:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:most  of  the  20th  century  are  consistent  with  this  view;  indeed,  this  was  a  key  piece
6:201:13466:19:19:94:518:157:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of evidence motivatingKortum(1997).  This definition means that the left hand side
6:202:13548:19:19:94:518:138:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of  equation  (1)  corresponds  to  the  flow  of  new  ideas.   However,  this  is  clearly  just  a
6:203:13649:19:19:94:518:119:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:convenient definition, and in some ways a more accurate title for this paper would be

6:205:13784:18:0:111:518:82:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We can now define the productivity of the idea production function as the ratio of
7:206:13901:0:37:94:351:686:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the output of ideas to the inputs used to make them:

7:214:14020:46:19:111:518:603:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The null hypothesis tested in this paper comes from the relationship assumed in (1).
7:215:14104:19:19:94:518:584:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Substituting this equation into the definition of research productivity, we see that (1)
7:216:14192:19:19:94:518:565:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:implies that research productivity equalsα— that is, research productivity is constant
7:217:14278:19:19:94:518:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:over time. This is the standard hypothesis in much of the growth literature. Under this
7:218:14365:19:19:94:496:527:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:null, a constant number of researchers can generate constant exponential growth.
7:219:14445:19:18:111:518:508:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The reason this is such a common assumption is also easy to see in equation (1).
7:220:14525:18:19:94:518:490:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:With constant research productivity, a research subsidy that increases the number of
7:221:14609:19:19:94:518:471:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:researchers  permanently  will  permanently  raise  the  growth  rate  of  the  economy.   In
7:222:14702:19:19:94:518:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:other words “constant research productivity” and the fact that sustained research sub-
7:223:14788:19:19:94:518:433:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sidies produce “permanent growth effects” are equivalent statements.4This clarifies
7:224:14871:19:19:94:518:414:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a claim in the introduction:  testing the null hypothesis of constant research produc-
7:225:14957:19:19:94:518:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tivity is interesting in its own right but also because it is informative about the kind of
7:226:15048:19:19:94:518:376:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:models that we use to study economic growth. The finding that research productivity is
7:227:15134:19:19:94:518:357:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:declining virtually everywhere we look poses problems for a large class of endogenous
7:228:15219:19:19:94:518:338:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:growth models. Moreover, the way we have defined ideas gives this concept economic

7:232:15447:28:19:94:518:232:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The bulk of the evidence presented in this paper concerns the extent to which a con-
7:233:15531:19:19:94:518:213:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:stant level of research effort can generate constant exponential growth within a rela-

7:235:15704:19:19:94:518:175:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tion.  We provide consistent evidence that the historical answer to this question is no:
7:236:15792:19:19:94:513:156:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:research productivity is declining at a substantial rate in virtually every place we look.
7:237:15882:19:19:111:518:137:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:This finding raises a natural question, however.  What if there is sharply declining

7:239:16063:15:11:94:518:103:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:models where research is measured in goods rather than in bodies or models with both horizontal and
7:240:16162:11:10:94:518:92:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:vertical dimensions to growth. These extensions will be incorporated below in such a way as to maintain
7:241:16265:10:0:94:461:82:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:the equivalence between “constant research productivity” and “permanent growth effects.”
8:242:16387:0:19:94:518:686:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:research productivitywithineach product line, but the main way that growth proceeds
8:243:16470:19:19:94:518:667:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is  by  developing  ever-better  new  product  lines?   First  there  was  steam  power,  then
8:244:16564:19:19:94:518:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:electric  power,  then  the  internal  combustion  engine,  then  the  semiconductor,  then
8:245:16655:19:19:94:518:629:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:gene editing, and so on.  Maybe there is limited opportunity within each area for pro-
8:246:16741:19:19:94:518:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ductivity improvement and long-run growth occurs through the invention of entirely
8:247:16823:19:19:94:518:591:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:new areas. Maybe research productivity is declining within every product line, but still
8:248:16911:19:19:94:518:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:not declining for the economy as a whole because we keep inventing new products. An
8:249:16994:19:19:94:518:553:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:analysis focused on microeconomic case studies would never reveal this to be the case.
8:250:17080:19:19:111:518:534:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The answer to this concern turns out to be straightforward and is an excellent place
8:251:17164:19:19:94:518:515:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to begin. First, consider the extreme case where there is no possibility at all for produc-
8:252:17255:19:19:94:518:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tivity improvement in a product line and all productivity growth comes from adding
8:253:17337:19:19:94:518:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:new product lines. Of course, this is just the originalRomer(1990) model itself, and to
8:254:17424:19:19:94:518:458:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:generate constant research productivity in that case requires the equation we started

8:260:17624:19:19:94:518:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:gate number of researchers.  Even with no ability to improve productivity within each
8:261:17709:19:19:94:518:352:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:variety, a constant number of researchers can sustain exponential growth if the variety-
8:262:17797:19:19:94:382:333:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:discovery function exhibits constant research productivity.
8:263:17856:19:19:111:518:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:This  hypothesis,  however,  runs  into  an  important  well-known  problem  noted  by
8:264:17942:19:19:94:518:295:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Jones (1995).  For the U.S. economy as a whole, exponential growth rates in GDP per
8:265:18025:19:19:94:518:276:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:person since 1870 or in total factor productivity since the 1930s — which are related
8:266:18110:19:19:94:518:257:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to the left side of equation (3) — are relatively stable or even declining.  But measures
8:267:18199:19:19:94:518:238:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of research effort — the right side of the equation — have grown tremendously.  When
8:268:18283:19:19:94:518:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:applied to the aggregate data, our approach of looking at research productivity is just
8:269:18370:19:19:94:288:200:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:another way of making this same point.
8:270:18408:19:19:111:518:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To illustrate the approach, we use the decadal averages of TFP growth to measure
8:271:18488:19:18:94:518:162:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the “output” of the idea production function. For the input, we use the NIPA measure of
8:272:18575:18:19:94:518:144:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:investment in “intellectual property products,” a number that is primarily made up of
8:273:18660:19:19:94:518:125:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:research and development spending but also includes expenditures on creating other

9:311:20257:19:19:94:518:176:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:year. Research productivity has fallen by an even larger amount — by a factor of 41 (or
9:312:20344:19:19:94:518:157:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:at an average growth rate of -5.1 percent per year).  By construction, a factor of 23 of
9:313:20432:19:19:94:518:138:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:this decline is due to the rise in research effort and so less than a factor of 2 is due to the

10:345:21445:19:19:94:518:316:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the 2000s, research productivity fell by a factor of 8.0.  And between the 1980s and the
10:346:21533:19:19:94:494:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:2000s, it fell by a factor of 1.7, with the entire amount due to rising research effort.
10:347:21621:19:19:111:518:278:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:This aggregate evidence could be improved on in many ways.  One might question
10:348:21699:19:19:94:518:259:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the TFP growth numbers — how much of TFP growth is due to innovation versus real-
10:349:21780:19:19:94:518:240:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:location or declines in misallocation? One might seek to include international research
10:350:21867:19:19:94:518:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the input measure. But reasonable variations along these lines would not change the
10:351:21953:19:19:94:518:202:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:basic point: a model in which economic growth arises from the discovery of newer and
10:352:22037:19:19:94:518:183:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:better varieties with limited possibilities for productivity growthwithineach variety ex-
10:353:22126:19:19:94:518:164:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:hibits sharply-declining research productivity. If one wishes to maintain the hypothesis
10:354:22214:19:19:94:518:145:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of constant research productivity, one must look elsewhere. It is for this reason that the
10:355:22304:19:0:94:457:126:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:literature — and this paper — turns to the micro side of economic growth.

11:360:22699:19:19:94:518:596:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of research productivity when the input to research is R&D expenditures (i.e.  “goods”)
11:361:22786:19:18:94:518:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rather than just bodies or researchers (i.e.  “time”).  Finally, we discuss various exten-
11:362:22876:18:43:94:330:559:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sions to our calculation of research productivity.

11:364:22958:28:19:94:518:488:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The null hypothesis that research productivity is constant over time is attractive con-
11:365:23045:19:19:94:518:469:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ceptually  in  that  it  leads  to  models  in  which  changes  in  policies  related  to  research
11:366:23144:19:19:94:518:450:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:can  permanently  affect  the  growth  rate  of  the  economy.   Several  papers,  then,  have
11:367:23238:19:19:94:518:431:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:proposed alternative models in which the calculations using aggregate data can be mis-
11:368:23324:19:19:94:518:412:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:leading about research productivity. The insight ofDinopoulos and Thompson(1998),
11:369:23405:19:19:94:518:393:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Peretto(1998),Young(1998),  andHowitt(1999)  is  that  the  aggregate  evidence  may
11:370:23489:19:19:94:518:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:be masking important heterogeneity, and that research productivity may nevertheless
11:371:23572:19:19:94:518:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:be  constant  for  a  significant  portion  of  the  economy.   Perhaps  the  idea  production

11:373:23749:18:19:94:518:318:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:numbers may simply capture the fact that every time the economy gets larger we add

11:385:24394:19:21:94:518:117:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:can occur in equilibrium if the number of products itself grows endogenously at the

12:400:25270:28:19:94:518:432:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In many applications, the input that we measure is R&D expenditures rather than the
12:401:25353:19:19:94:518:413:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:number of researchers.  In fact, one could make the case that this is a more desirable
12:402:25439:19:19:94:518:394:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:measure, in that it weights the various research inputs according to their relative prices:

12:404:25616:19:19:94:518:356:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:measured by R&D spending.  When the only input into ideas is researchers, then de-
12:405:25698:19:19:94:518:337:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:flating R&D expenditures by an average wage will appropriately recover the effective
12:406:25782:19:19:94:518:318:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:quantity of researchers.  In practice, R&D expenditures also typically involve spending
12:407:25869:19:19:94:518:299:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on capital goods and materials.  As explained next, deflating by the nominal wage to

12:416:26451:19:19:94:518:119:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:issue in the context of a single-good economy; in the next section, we explain how the
12:417:26537:19:18:94:335:100:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:analysis extends to the case of multiple products.
12:418:26587:18:0:111:518:82:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To see why equation (6) delivers endogenous growth, it is necessary to specify the
13:419:26705:0:19:94:518:686:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:economic environment more fully.  First, suppose there is a final output good that is
13:420:26790:19:35:94:400:667:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:produced with a standard Cobb-Douglas production function:
13:421:26848:35:34:263:518:632:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f3:A:Yt=Kθt(AtL)1−θ,(7)
13:422:26866:34:19:94:518:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:where we assume labor is fixed,  for simplicity.   Next,  the resource constraint for this
13:423:26956:19:19:94:150:579:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:economy is
13:424:26966:19:28:265:518:560:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f3:A:Yt=Ct+It+Rt(8)
13:425:26980:28:19:94:518:532:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:That  is,  final  output  is  used  for  consumption,  investment  in  physical  capital,  or  re-

13:427:27085:19:19:111:518:494:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We can now combine these three equations to get the endogenous growth result.
13:428:27162:19:19:94:517:475:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f8:B:First, notice that dividing both sides of the production function for final output byYθ

14:476:28626:19:19:111:518:539:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In other words, if we deflate R&D spending by the economy’s wage rate, we get ̃St,
14:477:28708:19:19:94:518:520:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a measure of the number of researchers the R&D spending could purchase. Of course,
14:478:28790:19:19:94:518:501:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:research labs spend on other things as well, like lab equipment and materials, but the
14:479:28876:19:19:94:518:482:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:theory makes clear how ̃Stis a useful measure for constructing research productivity.
14:480:28961:19:19:94:425:463:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Hence we will refer to ̃Stas “effective scientists” or “research effort.”
14:481:29034:19:26:111:404:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The idea production function in  (12) can then be written as
14:482:29094:26:18:287:294:418:11:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f8:C: ̇At
14:483:29098:18:0:283:294:400:11:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f8:C:At
14:484:29100:0:36:298:518:408:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f3:A:=  ̃αt ̃St(13)
14:485:29114:36:19:94:518:372:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:where both ̃αtand ̃Stwill be constant in the long run under the null hypothesis of en-
14:486:29200:19:19:94:518:353:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:dogenous growth.  We can therefore define research productivity in the lab equipment
14:487:29284:19:36:94:338:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:setup in a way that parallels our earlier treatment:
14:488:29336:36:0:227:349:298:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f6:A:Research productivity:=
14:489:29359:0:16:357:380:308:11:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f8:C: ̇At/At
14:490:29366:16:28:364:518:292:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f3:A: ̃St.(14)
14:491:29375:28:19:94:518:264:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The only difference is that we deflate R&D expenditures by a measure of the nominal
14:492:29458:19:19:94:518:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:wage to get ̃S.  Under the null hypothesis of endogenous growth, this measure of re-
14:493:29542:19:19:94:518:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:search productivity should be constant in the long run (and would only vary outside
14:494:29625:19:19:94:391:207:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the long-run because of changes in the capital-output ratio).
14:495:29686:19:19:111:518:188:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:An easy intuition for (14) is this:  endogenous growth requires that a constant pop-
14:496:29770:19:19:94:518:169:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ulation — or a constant number of researchers — be able to generate constant expo-
14:497:29852:19:19:94:518:150:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:nential growth.  Deflating R&D spending by the wage puts the R&D input in units of
14:498:29934:19:19:94:518:131:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:“people” so that constant research productivity is equivalent to the null hypothesis of
14:499:30021:19:16:94:195:112:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:endogenous growth.
14:500:30039:16:14:107:518:96:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:6The “bar” overθallows for the possibility, common in these models, that labor is paid proportionately
14:501:30141:14:0:94:355:82:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:less than its marginal product because of imperfect competition.
15:502:30241:0:19:111:518:686:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Equation (12) above also makes clear why deflating R&D spending by the wage is
15:503:30319:19:19:94:518:667:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:important. If we did not and instead naively computed research productivity by divid-
15:504:30404:19:19:94:518:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ing ̇At/AtbyRt, we would find that research productivity would be falling because of
15:505:30488:19:19:94:517:629:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the rise inAt, even in the endogenous growth case. In other words, this naive approach
15:506:30574:19:19:94:518:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to research productivity would not really correspond to anything economically useful.
15:507:30659:19:19:94:518:591:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Economic theory suggests deflating by the research wage in order to get a meaningful
15:508:30743:19:19:94:518:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:concept of research  productivity,  in this case,  one that corresponds to an  important
15:509:30831:19:19:94:266:553:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:hypothesis in the growth literature.
15:510:30867:19:19:111:518:534:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:As a measure of the nominal wage in our empirical applications, we use mean per-
15:511:30947:19:19:94:518:515:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sonal income from the Current Population Survey for males with a Bachelor’s degree or
15:512:31032:19:19:94:518:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:more of education.7This approach means that researchers of heterogeneous quality
15:513:31112:19:19:94:518:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are combined according to their relative wages. For example, if the best researchers are
15:514:31200:19:19:94:518:458:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:hired first and subsequent researchers are less talented, the additional researchers will
15:515:31289:19:19:94:518:439:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:be given a lower weight in our research measure.  The potential depletion of research
15:516:31374:19:41:94:433:420:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:talent is then appropriately incorporated in our empirical approach.8

15:518:31502:28:19:94:518:351:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In the previous two subsections, we discussed (i) what happens if research productivity
15:519:31589:19:19:94:518:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is only constant within each product while the number of products grows and (ii) how
15:520:31673:19:19:94:518:313:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to define research productivity when the input to research is measured in goods rather
15:521:31759:19:19:94:391:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:than bodies. Here, we explain how to put these two together.
15:522:31819:19:19:111:518:275:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Among the very first models that used both horizontal and vertical research to neu-
15:523:31902:19:19:94:518:256:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tralize scale effects, onlyHowitt(1999) used the lab-equipment approach.  In that pa-
15:524:31987:19:20:94:518:237:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:per, it turns out that the method we have just discussed — deflating R&D expenditures
15:525:32072:20:15:107:518:217:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:7These   data   are   from   Census   Tables   P18   and   P19,   available   at   http://www.census.gov/topics/
15:526:32184:15:11:94:518:202:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:income-poverty/income/data/tables.html. Prior to 1991, we use the series for “4 or more years of college.”
15:527:32290:11:11:94:518:191:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:For  years  between  1939  and  1967,  we  use  the  series  Bc845  from  the  Historical  Statistics  for  the  U.S.
15:528:32407:11:11:94:518:180:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:Economy, Millennial Edition.  Finally, for the aggregate research productivity calculation in Figure1, we
15:529:32512:11:11:94:518:169:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:require a deflator from the 1930s. We extrapolate the college earnings series backward into the 1930s using
15:530:32619:11:7:94:263:158:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:nominal GDP per person for this purpose.
15:531:32659:7:15:107:518:151:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:8A shortcoming of using the college earnings series is that the increase in college participation may
15:532:32760:15:11:94:518:136:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:mean that less talented people are attending college over time. To the extent that this is true, our deflator
15:533:32869:11:11:94:518:125:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:may understate the rise in the wage for a constant-quality college graduate and hence overstate the rise
15:534:32973:11:11:94:518:114:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:in  research  productivity.   As  an  alternative,  we  redid  all  our  results  using  nominal  GDP  per  person  to
15:535:33091:11:11:94:518:103:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:deflate R&D expenditures — which according to the discussion surrounding equation (12) is a valid way to
15:536:33195:11:10:94:518:92:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:proceed. The results are similar, in part because the increases in research productivity that we document
15:537:33300:10:0:94:142:82:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:are so large.
16:538:33348:0:19:94:518:686:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by the economy’s average wage — works precisely as explained above. That is, research
16:539:33433:19:19:94:518:667:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:productivity for each product should be constant if one divides the growth rate by the
16:540:33519:19:19:94:518:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:effective number of researchers working to improve that product.9This is true more
16:541:33601:19:19:94:518:629:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:generally in these horizontal/vertical models of growth whenever product variety grows
16:542:33687:19:19:94:518:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:at the same rate as the economy’s population.  Peretto(2016a) cites a large literature
16:543:33773:19:19:94:518:591:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:suggesting  that  this  is  the  case:   product  variety  and  population  scale  together  over
16:544:33870:19:19:94:518:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:time and across countries.10The two previous subsections then merge together very
16:545:33951:19:41:94:140:553:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:naturally.
16:546:33961:41:28:94:220:512:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:3.4.Stepping on Toes
16:547:33981:28:19:94:518:484:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:One other potential modification to the idea production function that has been con-
16:548:34064:19:19:94:518:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sidered  in  the  literature  is  a  duplication  externality.   For  example,  perhaps  the  idea
16:549:34162:19:19:94:518:446:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:production function depends onSλt, whereλis less than one. Doubling the number of
16:550:34243:19:19:94:518:427:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:researchers may less than double the production of new ideas because of duplication
16:551:34326:19:19:94:368:408:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:or because of some other source of diminishing returns.
16:552:34381:19:19:111:518:389:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We could incorporate this effect into our analysis explicitly but choose instead to
16:553:34464:19:19:94:518:370:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:focus  on  the  benchmark  case  ofλ=  1for  several  reasons.   First  and  foremost,  our
16:554:34555:19:19:94:518:351:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:measurement of  research effort already incorporates  a market-based adjustment  for
16:555:34639:19:19:94:518:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the depletion of talent: R&D spending weights workers according to their wage, and less
16:556:34726:19:19:94:518:313:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:talented researchers will naturally earn a lower salary. If more of these workers are hired
16:557:34817:19:19:94:518:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:over time, R&D spending will not rise by as much.  Second, adjusting forλonly affects
16:558:34902:19:19:94:518:275:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the magnitude of the trend in research productivity, but not the overall qualitative fact
16:559:34991:19:19:94:518:256:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of whether or not there is a downward trend.   It is easy to deflate the growth rate of
16:560:35078:19:20:94:518:237:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:research effort by any particular value ofλto get a sense for how this matters; cutting
16:561:35165:20:15:107:518:217:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:9The  main  surprise  in  confirming  this  observation  is  thatwt/Aitis  constant.    In  particular,wtis
16:562:35272:15:11:94:518:202:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:proportional to output per worker, and one might have expected that output per worker would grow with
16:563:35373:11:11:94:518:191:9:g_d0_f20:9:g_d0_f3:F:At(an average across varieties) but also withNt, the number of varieties.  However, this turns out not to
16:564:35478:11:11:94:518:180:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:be the case:  Howitt includes a fixed factor of production (like land), and this fixed factor effectively eats
16:565:35588:11:11:94:518:169:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:up the gains from expanding variety. More precisely, the number of varieties grows with population while
16:566:35692:11:7:94:466:158:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:the amount of land per person declines with population, and these two effects exactly offset.
16:567:35785:7:15:103:518:151:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:10Building on the preceding footnote, it is worth also considering Peretto (2016b) in this context.  Like
16:568:35890:15:11:94:518:136:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:Howitt,  that  paper  has  a  fixed  factor  and  for  some  parameter  values,  his  setup  also  leads  to  constant
16:569:36008:11:11:94:518:125:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f14:F:research  productivity.   For  other  parameter  values  (e.g.   if  the  fixed  factor  is  turned  off ),  the  wagewt
16:570:36128:11:11:94:518:114:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:grows both because of quality improvements and because of increases in variety.  Nevertheless, deflating
16:571:36232:11:11:94:518:103:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:by the wage is still a good way to test the null hypothesis of endogenous growth:  in that case, research
16:572:36337:11:10:94:518:92:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:productivityrisesalong an endogenous growth path.  So the finding below that research productivity is
16:573:36438:10:0:94:303:82:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:declining is also relevant in this broader framework.
17:574:36527:0:19:94:518:686:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:our  growth  rates  in  half  —  an  extreme  adjustment  —  would  still  leave  the  nature  of
17:575:36624:19:19:94:518:667:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:our results unchanged.  Third, one might expect a “short-run” value ofλto differ from
17:576:36709:19:19:94:518:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:its “long-run” value.  For example,  the duplication and talent depletion effects could
17:577:36796:19:19:94:518:629:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:certainly apply if we tried to double the amount of research in a given year. However, to
17:578:36885:19:19:94:518:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the extent that the increase occurs gradually over time, one might expect these effects
17:579:36972:19:19:94:518:591:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to be mitigated.  Finally, there is no consensus on what value ofλone should use —
17:580:37054:19:19:94:518:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Kremer (1993) even considers the possibility that it might be larger than one because

17:588:37653:33:19:94:518:373:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:One of the key drivers of economic growth during the last half century is Moore’s Law:
17:589:37739:19:18:94:518:354:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the empirical regularity that the number of transistors packed onto an integrated cir-
17:590:37825:18:19:94:518:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cuit serving as the central processing unit for a computer doubles approximately every
17:591:37911:19:19:94:518:317:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:two  years.   Figure3shows  this  regularity  back  to  1971.   The  log  scale  of  this  figure
17:592:38008:19:19:94:518:298:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:indicates the overall stability of the relationship, dating back nearly fifty years, as well
17:593:38100:19:19:94:518:279:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:as the tremendous rate of growth that is implied. Related formulations of Moore’s Law
17:594:38185:19:19:94:518:260:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:involving  computing  performance  per  watt  of  electricity  or  the  cost  of  information
17:595:38278:19:19:94:518:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:technology could also be considered, but the transistor count on an integrated circuit
17:596:38364:19:19:94:468:222:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:is the original and most famous version of the law, so we use that one here.11
17:597:38442:19:19:111:518:203:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:A doubling time of two years is equivalent to a constant exponential growth rate
17:598:38522:19:19:94:518:184:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of 35 percent per year.  While there is some discussion of Moore’s Law slowing down
17:599:38605:19:19:94:518:165:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in recent years (there always seems to be such discussion!), we will take the constant
17:600:38691:19:19:94:518:146:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:exponential growth rate as corresponding to a constant flow of new ideas back to 1971.
17:601:38777:19:19:94:518:127:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:That  is,  we  assume  the  output  of  the  idea  production  for  Moore’s  Law  is  a  stable  35
17:602:38876:19:23:94:518:108:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:percent per year.  Other alternatives are possible.  For example, we could use decadal

19:606:39213:0:19:94:518:686:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:growth rates or other averages, and some of these approaches will be employed later
19:607:39296:19:19:94:518:667:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the paper. However, from the standpoint of understanding steady, rapid exponential
19:608:39381:19:19:94:518:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:growth for nearly half a century, the stability implied by the straight line in Figure 3 is
19:609:39472:19:19:94:518:629:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a good place to start. And any slowing of Moore’s Law would only reinforce the finding
19:610:39558:19:19:94:234:610:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:we are about to document.12
19:611:39585:19:19:111:518:591:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:If the output side of Moore’s Law is constant exponential growth, what is happening
19:612:39668:19:19:94:518:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on the input side?  Many commentators note that Moore’s Law is not a law of nature
19:613:39750:19:19:94:518:553:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:but instead results from intense research effort:  doubling the transistor density is of-
19:614:39839:19:19:94:518:534:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ten viewed as a goal or target for research programs.   We measure research effort by
19:615:39924:19:19:94:518:515:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:deflating the nominal semiconductor R&D expenditures of all the main firms by the
19:616:40005:19:19:94:518:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:nominal wage of high-skilled workers, as discussed above. Our semiconductor R&D se-

19:618:40174:19:19:94:518:458:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Texas Instruments, Samsung, and more than two dozen other semiconductor firms and
19:619:40255:19:19:94:518:439:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:equipment manufacturers. More details are provided in the notes to Table 1 below and

19:621:40367:19:19:111:518:401:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The striking fact, shown in Figure4, is that research effort has risen by a factor of
19:622:40452:19:19:94:518:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:18 since 1971.   This increase occurs while the growth rate of chip density is more or
19:623:40538:19:19:94:518:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:less stable: the constant exponential growth implied by Moore’s Law has been achieved
19:624:40623:19:19:94:518:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:only by a massive increase in the amount of resources devoted to pushing the frontier
19:625:40708:19:19:94:136:325:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:forward.
19:626:40716:19:19:111:518:306:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Assuming a constant growth rate for Moore’s Law, the implication is that research
19:627:40797:19:19:94:518:287:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:productivity has fallen by this same factor of 18, an average rate of 6.8 percent per year.
19:628:40888:19:19:94:518:268:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:If the null hypothesis of constant research productivity were correct, the growth rate
19:629:40974:19:19:94:518:249:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:underlying  Moore’s  Law  should  have  increased  by  a  factor  of  18  as  well.   Instead,  it
19:630:41072:19:19:94:518:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:was remarkably stable.  Put differently, because of declining research productivity, it is
19:631:41162:19:19:94:518:211:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f3:B:around 18 timesharder today to generate the exponential growth behind Moore’s Law
19:632:41243:19:18:94:188:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:than it was in 1971.
19:633:41263:18:19:111:518:174:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Table1  reports  the  robustness  of  this  result  to  various  assumptions  about  which
19:634:41353:19:19:94:518:155:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:R&D expenditures should be counted.  No matter how we measure R&D spending, we
19:635:41431:19:19:94:518:136:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:see a large increase in effective research and a corresponding large decline in research
19:636:41519:19:21:94:518:117:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:productivity. Even by the most conservative measure in the table, research productivity

20:663:42783:19:19:94:518:251:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:natural places to find support for this aspect of endogenous growth theory.  Instead, it
20:664:42871:19:46:94:281:232:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:provides one of the sharpest critiques.

21:681:43800:11:11:108:504:370:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:assistance from Unni Pillai and Antoine Dechezlepretre.  We start with the R&D spending data on
21:682:43895:11:11:108:504:359:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:30 semiconductor firms plus an additional 11 semiconductor equipment manufacturers from all
21:683:43986:11:11:108:504:348:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:over the world.  Next, we gathered data from PATSTAT on patents from the U.S. patent office.  The
21:684:44083:11:11:108:504:337:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:different rows in this table differ in how we add up the data across firms. There are two basic ways
21:685:44183:11:11:108:504:326:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:we  treat  the  R&D  data.   In  the  “Narrow”  treatment,  we  recognize  that  firms  engage  in  different
21:686:44292:11:11:108:504:315:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:kinds of R&D, only some of which may be relevant for Moore’s Law.  We therefore weight a firm’s
21:687:44387:11:11:108:504:304:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:R&D according to a (moving average) of the share of its patents that are in semiconductors (IPC
21:688:44482:11:11:108:504:293:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:group “H01L”). For example, in 1970, 75% of Intel’s patents were for semiconductors, but by 2010
21:689:44578:11:11:108:504:282:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:this number had fallen to just 8%.  In the “Broad” category, we include all R&D by semiconductor
21:690:44674:11:11:108:504:271:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:firms like Intel and National Semiconductor but use the patent data to infer semiconductor R&D

21:692:44869:11:11:108:504:249:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:conglomerates”  label  means  that  we  further  downweight  the  R&D  spending  of  conglomerates
21:693:44967:11:11:108:504:238:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:and newer firms like Micron and SK Hynix that focus on memory chips or chips for HDTVs and
21:694:45057:11:11:108:504:227:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:automobiles by a factor of 1/2, reflecting the possibility that even their semiconductor patenting
21:695:45155:11:11:108:504:216:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:data may be broader than Moore’s Law.  Finally the last two rows show results when we consider
21:696:45249:11:11:108:504:205:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:the “Narrow” measure of R&D but focus on only one or two firms. See the online data appendix for

22:698:45393:0:19:94:518:686:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:example, progress in a completely different branch of materials science may lead to a
22:699:45478:19:19:94:518:667:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:new idea that improves computer chips. Such positive spillovers are not a problem for
22:700:45563:19:19:94:518:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:our analysis since they would show up as anincreasein research productivity rather
22:701:45645:19:19:94:358:629:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:than as the declines that we document in this paper.13
22:702:45699:19:19:111:518:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:A type of measurement error that could cause our findings to be misleading is if
22:703:45779:19:19:94:518:591:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:we systematically understate R&D in early years and this bias gets corrected over time.
22:704:45866:19:19:94:518:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In the case of Moore’s Law, we are careful to include research spending by firms that
22:705:45951:19:19:94:518:553:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are no longer household names, like Fairchild Camera and Instrument (later Fairchild
22:706:46035:19:19:94:518:534:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Semiconductor) and National Semiconductor so as to minimize this bias: for example,
22:707:46118:19:19:94:518:515:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in 1971, Intel’s R&D was just 0.4 percent of our estimate for total semiconductor R&D
22:708:46203:19:19:94:518:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in that year. Throughout the paper, we try to be as careful as we can with measurement
22:709:46289:19:46:94:366:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:issues, but this type of problem must be acknowledged.

22:711:46369:31:19:94:518:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Our  next  application  for  measuring  research  productivity  examines  the  evolution  of
22:712:46461:19:19:94:518:381:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:crop  yields  for  various  crops  over  time.   Due  partly  to  the  historical  importance  of
22:713:46558:19:19:94:518:362:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:agriculture in the economy,  crop yields and agricultural R&D spending are relatively
22:714:46643:19:19:94:518:343:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:well-measured for various crops.   For each of corn,  soybeans,  cotton,  and wheat,  we
22:715:46731:19:19:94:518:324:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:measure ideas as crop yields, and research inputs as R&D expenditure directed at im-
22:716:46815:19:19:94:518:305:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:proving  those  yields.   Crop  R&D  is  generally  broken  down  into  research  on  biologi-
22:717:46909:19:19:94:518:286:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cal efficiency (cross-breeding and bioengineering), mechanization, management, pro-
22:718:46992:19:19:94:518:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tection and maintenance, and post-harvest (see, for example,Huffman and Evenson
22:719:47071:19:19:94:518:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(2006)). We count research on biological efficiency and protection and maintenance as
22:720:47156:19:19:94:317:229:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the portion devoted to improving crop yields.

22:725:47569:11:7:94:344:147:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:this. For example, see Lucking, Bloom and Van Reenen (2017).
22:726:47629:7:15:103:518:140:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:14For our measure of ideas, we use the national realized yields series for each crop available from the

24:779:48833:19:19:94:518:667:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and random shocks. These shocks, especially adverse weather and pest events, tend to
24:780:48917:19:19:94:518:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:have asymmetric effects:  adverse events cause much larger reductions in yields than

24:783:49187:19:19:94:442:591:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:yields across these four crops roughly doubled between 1960 and 2015.

24:792:49862:19:19:94:518:420:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rising number corresponds to research targeted only at so-called biological efficiency.
24:793:49949:19:19:94:518:401:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:This includes cross-breeding (hybridization) and genetic modification directed at in-

24:798:50388:19:19:94:518:306:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:has grown sharply since 1969,  rising by a factor that ranges from 3 to more than 25,

24:800:50520:19:19:111:518:268:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:It is immediately evident from Figure6 that research productivity has fallen sharply

27:918:54120:19:19:94:518:492:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:one of the most important goods we purchase.  Our third collection of industry case

27:920:54257:19:19:111:518:454:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Figure7 shows U.S. life expectancy at birth and at age 65.   This graph makes the
27:921:54338:19:19:94:518:435:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:important point that life expectancy is one of the few economic goods that does not
27:922:54421:19:19:94:518:416:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:exhibit exponential growth. Instead, arithmetic growth provides a better description of
27:923:54508:19:19:94:518:397:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the time path of life expectancy. Since 1950, U.S. life expectancy at birth has increased
27:924:54597:19:19:94:518:378:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:at a relatively stable rate of 1.8 years each decade, and life expectancy at age 65 has risen
27:925:54690:19:19:94:302:359:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:at 0.9 years per decade (see Deaton, 2013).
27:926:54733:19:19:111:518:340:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Also  shown  in  the  graph  is  the  well-known  fact  that  overall  life  expectancy  grew
27:927:54826:19:19:94:518:321:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:even  more  rapidly  during  the  first  half  of  the  20th  century,  at  around  3.8  years  per
27:928:54925:19:19:94:518:302:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:decade.   This  raises  the  question  of  whether  even  arithmetic  growth  is  an  appropri-
27:929:55020:19:19:94:518:283:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ate characterization.  We believe that it is for two reasons.  First, there is no sign of a
27:930:55111:19:19:94:518:264:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:slowdown in the years gained per decade since 1950, either in life expectancy at birth
27:931:55197:19:19:94:518:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:or in life expectancy at age 65.  The second reason is a fascinating empirical regularity
27:932:55286:19:19:94:518:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:documented byOeppen and Vaupel(2002).  That paper shows that “record female life
27:933:55366:19:19:94:518:207:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:expectancy”  —  the  life  expectancy  of  women  in  the  country  for  which  they  live  the
27:934:55461:19:19:94:518:188:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:longest — has risen at a remarkably steady rate of 2.4 years per decade ever since 1840.
27:935:55549:19:41:94:512:169:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Steady linear increases in life expectancy, not exponential ones, seem to be the norm.

28:966:56154:19:19:94:518:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:drugs, including both chemical and biological products, that have been approved by
28:967:56236:19:19:94:518:309:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the FDA. Virtually all pharmaceutical advances in the last 50 years show up in these

28:971:56589:19:19:94:518:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cer).  Only two or three of the NMEs in any given year become commercial successes.
28:972:56672:19:19:94:518:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Among  famous  drugs,  only  morphine  and  aspirin  do  not  show  up  in  these  counts,
28:973:56762:19:19:94:518:195:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:because their discovery pre-dates the FDA. The flow of NMEs is well-known to show

29:1005:58509:67:14:103:518:96:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:15A  limitation  is  that  it  does  not  include  R&D  done  by  foreign  companies  that  is  performed  abroad.

31:1060:60132:35:19:94:518:385:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:That is, the expected years of life saved from a decline in, say, cancer mortality is the
31:1061:60221:19:18:94:518:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:product of three terms. First is the fraction of deaths that result from cancer. Second is
31:1062:60311:18:19:94:518:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the average years of life lost if someone dies from cancer at agea, and the final term is
31:1063:60400:19:19:94:304:329:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the percentage decline in cancer mortality.
31:1064:60443:19:19:111:518:310:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Vaupel and Canudas-Romo(2003) show that this expression generalizes to a much
31:1065:60520:19:19:94:518:291:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:richer setting. In particular, the expected years of life saved is the product of three terms
31:1066:60613:19:19:94:518:272:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:with the same interpretation. For example, they allow for an arbitrary number of causes
31:1067:60700:19:19:94:463:253:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:of death each of which has a mortality rate that varies arbitrarily with age.16
31:1068:60779:19:19:111:518:234:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:As discussed at the start of this section, life expectancy tends to rise linearly. There-
31:1069:60868:19:19:94:518:215:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:fore,  constant  exponential  growth  in  income  per  person  is  associated  with  constant

31:1073:61240:29:15:103:518:129:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:16Their formula involves an extra covariance term as well. In particular, the covariance between the age-

31:1075:61448:11:11:94:518:103:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:cancer is averted. When the percentage decline in mortality rates is the same across ages, this covariance
31:1076:61554:11:10:94:518:92:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:is zero. More generally, it can differ from zero, but in many of the calculations in their paper, the covariance
31:1077:61666:10:0:94:127:82:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:is small.

32:1079:61717:19:19:111:518:667:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The research input aimed at reducing mortality from a given disease is at first blush
32:1080:61802:19:19:94:518:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:harder to measure.  For example, it is difficult to get research spending broken down
32:1081:61887:19:19:94:518:629:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:into spending on various diseases.   Nevertheless,  we implement a potential solution
32:1082:61972:19:19:94:518:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to this problem by measuring the number of scientific publications in PUBMED that
32:1083:62053:19:19:94:518:591:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:have “Neoplasms,” for example, as a MESH (Medical Subject Heading) term.  MESH is
32:1084:62134:19:19:94:518:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the National Library of Medicine’s controlled vocabulary thesaurus.18We do this in two
32:1085:62220:19:19:94:518:553:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ways. Our broader approach (“publications”) uses all publications with the appropriate
32:1086:62306:19:19:94:518:534:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:MESH keyword as our input measure. Our narrower approach (“trials”) further restricts
32:1087:62391:19:19:94:518:515:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:our  measure  to  those  publications  that  according  to  MESH  correspond  to  a  clinical
32:1088:62484:19:19:94:517:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:trial.  Rather than using scientific publications as anoutputmeasure, as other studies
32:1089:62570:19:19:94:518:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:have done, we use publications and clinical trials asinputmeasures to capture research
32:1090:62656:19:19:94:386:458:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:effort aimed at reducing mortality for a particular disease.19
32:1091:62718:19:19:111:518:439:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Figure 10shows our basic “idea output” measures for mortality from all cancers,
32:1092:62797:19:19:94:518:420:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:from breast cancer, and from heart disease.  Heart disease and cancer are the top two
32:1093:62882:19:19:94:518:401:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:leading causes of death in the United States, and in the spirit of looking as narrowly as
32:1094:62971:19:19:94:518:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:possible, we also chose to look at breast cancer mortality. For the two cancer types, we
32:1095:63059:19:19:94:518:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:use the 5-year mortality rate conditional on being diagnosed with either type of cancer
32:1096:63146:19:19:94:518:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and see an S-shaped decline since 1975.  This translates into a hump-shaped “Years of
32:1097:63231:19:19:94:518:325:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:life saved per 1000 people” — the empirical analog of equation (16).  For example, for
32:1098:63317:19:19:94:518:306:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:all cancers, the years of life saved series peaks around 1990 at more than 100 years of
32:1099:63404:19:19:94:518:287:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:life saved per 1000 people before declining to around 60 years in the 2000s.  For heart
32:1100:63491:19:19:94:518:268:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:disease, a substantial part of the decline in deaths comes from people not contracting
32:1101:63577:19:19:94:518:249:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the disease in the first place, so we focus on the (smoothed) crude death rate for people
32:1102:63666:19:24:94:518:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:aged 55 to 64. The death rate declines at different rates in different periods, leading to a

37:1307:69504:0:19:111:518:686:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Several general comments about research productivity for medical research deserve
37:1308:69585:19:19:94:518:667:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:mention.   First,  for  this  application,  the  units  of  research  productivity  are  different
37:1309:69683:19:19:94:518:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:than what we’ve seen so far.  For example, between 1985 and 2006, declining research
37:1310:69767:19:19:94:518:629:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:productivity  means  that  the  number  of  years  of  life  saved  per  100,000  people  in  the
37:1311:69864:19:19:94:518:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:population by each publication of a clinical trial related to cancer declined from more
37:1312:69951:19:19:94:518:591:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:than 8 years to just over one year. For breast cancer, the changes are even starker: from
37:1313:70040:19:19:94:481:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:around 16 years per clinical trial in the mid 1980s to less than one year by 2006.
37:1314:70122:19:19:111:518:553:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Next, however, notice that the changes were not monotonic if we go back to 1975.
37:1315:70202:19:19:94:518:534:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Between 1975 and the mid-1980s, research productivity for these two cancer research
37:1316:70285:19:19:94:518:515:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:categories increased quite substantially.  The production function for new ideas is ob-
37:1317:70372:19:19:94:518:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:viously complicated and heterogeneous.  These cases suggest that it may get easier to
37:1318:70457:19:45:94:417:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:find new ideas at first before getting harder, at least in some areas.

37:1320:70569:31:19:94:518:401:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Our studies of semiconductors, crops, and medicine are illuminating, but at the end of
37:1321:70655:19:19:94:518:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the day, they are just case studies.  One naturally wonders how representative they are
37:1322:70742:19:19:94:518:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the broader economy.  In addition, some growth models associate each firm with a
37:1323:70825:19:19:94:518:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:different variety: perhaps the number of firms making corn or semiconductor chips is
37:1324:70909:19:19:94:518:325:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rising sharply, so that research effort per firm is actually constant, as is research pro-
37:1325:70999:19:19:94:518:306:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ductivity at the firm level.  Declining research productivity for corn or semiconductors
37:1326:71087:19:19:94:393:287:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:could in this view simply reflect a further composition bias.20
37:1327:71150:19:19:111:518:268:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To help address these concerns, we turn to Compustat data on US publicly-traded
37:1328:71229:19:19:94:518:249:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:firms.   The  strength  of  these  data  is  that  they  are  more  representative  than  the  case
37:1329:71328:19:19:94:518:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:studies, but of course they too have limitations.  Publicly-traded firms are still a select
37:1330:71419:19:19:94:518:211:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sample, and our measures of “ideas” and research inputs are likely less precise.  How-

37:1332:71578:19:19:111:518:173:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:As a measure of the output of the idea production function, we use decadal averages

37:1336:71941:15:11:94:518:103:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:and Howitt(1992) take the alternative view that different firms may be involved in producing the same

38:1342:72399:19:19:94:518:629:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sizing precisely these links.  Many papers have shown that news of patent grants for a

38:1345:72657:19:19:94:518:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are  also  positively  correlated  with  the  firm’s  subsequent  growth  in  employment  and

38:1348:72833:19:19:94:518:515:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Melitz(2003), increases in the fundamental productivity of a firm show up in the long

38:1350:73008:19:19:94:518:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:This motivates our use of sales revenue or employment to measure fundamental pro-

38:1355:73436:19:19:94:518:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Haltiwanger  and  Scarpetta,  2013).   And  sales  revenue  and  employment  can  change
38:1356:73524:19:19:94:518:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for reasons other than the discovery of new ideas.   We try to address these issues by
38:1357:73610:19:19:94:518:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:also looking at revenue productivity and through various sample selection procedures,
38:1358:73695:19:19:94:518:325:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:discussed below. These problems also motivate the earlier approach of looking at case
38:1359:73780:19:19:94:132:306:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:studies.
38:1360:73788:19:19:111:518:287:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To  measure  the  research  input,  we  use  a  firm’s  spending  on  research  and  devel-

38:1362:73972:19:19:94:518:249:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:report  formal  R&D,  and  such  firms  are  well-known  to  be  a  select  sample  (e.g.   dis-
38:1363:74068:19:19:94:518:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:proportionately in manufacturing and large).  We look at firms since 1980 that report
38:1364:74153:19:19:94:518:211:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:non-zero R&D, and this restricts us to an initial sample of 15,128 firms. Our additional
38:1365:74241:19:19:94:394:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:requirements for sample selection in our baseline sample are
38:1366:74301:19:15:103:518:173:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:21This is obvious when one thinks about the equilibrium condition for the allocation of labor across
38:1367:74401:15:11:94:518:158:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:firms in simple settings:  in equilibrium, a worker must be indifferent between working in two different
38:1368:74505:11:11:94:518:147:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:firms, which equalizes wages.  But wages are typically proportional to output per worker.  Moreover, with
38:1369:74610:11:11:94:518:136:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:Cobb-Douglas production and a common exponent on labor, sales revenue per worker would be precisely
38:1370:74709:11:11:94:518:125:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:equated across firms even if they had different underlying productivities. In aLucas(1978) span of control
38:1371:74815:11:11:94:518:114:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:setting, more productive firms just hire more workers, which drives down the marginal product until it is
38:1372:74920:11:11:94:518:103:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:equated across firms.  In alternative settings with monopolistic competition, it is the price of a particular
38:1373:75029:11:10:94:518:92:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:variety that declines as the firm expands. Regardless, higher fundamental productivity shows up as higher
38:1374:75134:10:0:94:366:82:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:employment or sales revenue, but not in higher sales per employee.
39:1375:75236:0:19:107:518:686:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:1.  We observe at least 3 annual growth observations for the firm in a given decade.
39:1376:75320:19:19:121:518:667:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:These growth rates are averaged to form the idea output growth measure for that

39:1378:75419:29:19:107:518:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:2.  We only consider decades in which our idea output growth measure for the firm
39:1379:75500:19:29:121:485:600:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:is positive (negative growth is clearly not the result of the firm innovating).
39:1380:75579:29:19:107:518:571:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:3.  We require the firm to be observed (for both the output growth measure and the
39:1381:75661:19:19:121:518:552:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:research input measure) for two consecutive decades. Our decades are the 1980s,
39:1382:75740:19:19:121:517:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:the 1990s, the 2000s (which refers to the 2000-2007 period), and the 2010s (which
39:1383:75821:19:19:121:517:514:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:refers to the 2010-2015 period); we drop the years 2008 and 2009 because of the
39:1384:75900:19:21:121:195:495:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:financial crisis.

39:1389:76240:19:19:94:518:398:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:four  decades.   In  all  samples,  there  is  substantial  growth  in  the  effective  number  of

39:1391:76421:19:19:94:518:360:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:year.   Under  our  null  hypothesis,  this  rapid  growth  in  research  should  translate  into

43:1483:82719:49:19:111:518:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Table 5 provides additional evidence of the robustness of these results. In the inter-
43:1484:82805:19:19:94:518:309:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ests of brevity, we report these results for the sales revenue output measure for firms
43:1485:82892:19:19:94:518:290:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that we observe across three decades,  but the results for our other output measures
43:1486:82976:19:19:94:518:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and time frames are similar.  The first row of the table repeats the benchmark results
43:1487:83062:19:19:94:518:252:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:described earlier.  The second and third rows relax the requirement that sales growth
43:1488:83147:19:19:94:518:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is positive.  In the second row, we replace all growth rates less than 1% with 1%, while
43:1489:83235:19:19:94:518:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the third row we additionally winsorize an equal number of firms at the top of the
43:1490:83320:19:19:94:518:195:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:growth rate distribution.   This increases the sample size considerably and brings the

43:1492:83498:19:19:94:518:157:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sharply, reassuring us that this sample selection criteria is not driving the results.  The
43:1493:83589:19:19:94:530:138:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:fourth row imposes the restriction that research is increasing across the observed decades.
43:1494:83680:19:19:94:518:119:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The fifth row tightens our restrictions and drops firm in which sales revenue declines

43:1496:83851:18:0:94:518:82:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:than mean sales growth as our output measure.  And the last row reports unweighted
44:1497:83968:0:19:94:518:686:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:averages rather than weighting firms by the effective number of researchers.  The gen-
44:1498:84054:19:44:94:430:667:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:eral finding of substantial declines in research productivity is robust.

44:1500:84138:31:19:94:518:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The evidence presented in this paper concerns the extent to which a constant level of
44:1501:84223:19:19:94:518:573:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:research effort can generate constant exponential growth, either in the economy as a
44:1502:84307:19:19:94:518:554:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:whole or within relatively narrow categories, such as a firm or a seed type or a health
44:1503:84394:19:19:94:518:535:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:condition. We provide consistent evidence that the historical answer to this question is
44:1504:84482:19:19:94:518:516:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:no: as summarized in Table 6, research productivity is declining at a substantial rate in
44:1505:84571:19:19:94:518:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:virtually every place we look.  The table also provides a way to quantify the magnitude
44:1506:84658:19:19:94:518:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the declines in research productivity by reporting the half-life in each case.  Taking
44:1507:84747:19:19:94:518:459:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the aggregate economy number as a representative example, research productivity de-
44:1508:84830:19:19:94:518:440:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:clines at an average rate of 5.3 percent per year, meaning that it takes around 13 years
44:1509:84918:19:19:94:518:421:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for research productivity to fall by half. Or put another way, the economy has to double
44:1510:85006:19:19:94:518:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:its research efforts every 13 years just to maintain the same overall rate of economic

44:1512:85099:19:19:111:518:364:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:A natural question is whether or not these empirical patterns can be reproduced in
44:1513:85181:19:19:94:518:345:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a general equilibrium model of growth.  One class of models that is broadly consistent
44:1514:85267:19:19:94:518:326:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:with this evidence is the semi-endogenous growth approach ofJones(1995),Kortum

46:1569:88143:19:19:94:525:553:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:duction functions. Some goods, like semiconductors, can have rapid productivity growth
46:1570:88229:19:19:94:518:534:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:because theirβis small, while other goods like the speed of airplanes or perhaps the
46:1571:88313:19:19:94:518:515:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:education industry itself could have slow rates of innovation because theirβis large.
46:1572:88398:19:19:94:518:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Nevertheless,  all  of  these  products  could  exhibit  constant  exponential  growth  if  the
46:1573:88493:19:19:94:482:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:amount of research effort put toward innovation is itself growing exponentially.
46:1574:88573:19:19:111:518:458:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:This framework helps us address a phenomenon that might at first have appeared
46:1575:88651:19:19:94:518:439:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:puzzling:  research productivity is declining very rapidly in the fastest growing sector
46:1576:88739:19:19:94:518:420:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the economy, semiconductors.  Why?  In particular, why are we throwing so many
46:1577:88820:19:19:94:459:401:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:resources at a sector that has such sharp declines in research productivity?
46:1578:88896:19:19:111:518:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The last column of Table6 reports estimates ofβfor each of our case studies, ac-
46:1579:88976:19:19:94:518:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cording to equation (17),  and  the results speak to the semiconductor puzzle we  just
46:1580:89062:19:19:94:518:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:highlighted. In particular, semiconductors is the application with the smallest value of
46:1581:89150:19:19:94:518:325:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f3:B:β, coming in at 0.2, suggesting that it is the sector with theleastdegree of diminishing
46:1582:89238:19:19:94:518:306:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:returns in idea production:Ais growing at 35% per year, while research productivity
46:1583:89321:19:19:94:518:287:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is falling at 7% per year.  From (17), this implies a value ofβof7/35 = 0.2.  In contrast,
46:1584:89411:19:19:94:518:268:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:economy-wide TFP growth averages about 1.5% per year, while research productivity
46:1585:89492:19:19:94:518:249:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is  declining  at  a  rate  of  about  5%  per  year,  yielding  aβof  more  than  3!   So  in  fact,
46:1586:89593:19:19:94:506:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:semiconductors shows muchlessdiminishing returns than the economy as a whole.
46:1587:89670:19:19:111:518:211:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Research productivity for semiconductors falls so rapidly, not because that sector
46:1588:89752:19:18:94:518:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:has  the  sharpest  diminishing  returns  —  the  opposite  is  true.    It  is  instead  because
46:1589:89849:18:19:94:518:174:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:research in that sector is growing more rapidly than in any other part of the economy,
46:1590:89935:19:19:94:518:155:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:pushing  research  productivity  down.   A  plausible  explanation  for  the  rapid  research
46:1591:90028:19:19:94:518:136:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:growth in this sector is the “general purpose” nature of information technology.  De-
46:1592:90113:19:19:94:518:117:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:mand for better computer chips is growing so fast that it is worth suffering the declines
46:1593:90202:19:0:94:518:98:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in research productivity there in order to achieve the gains associated with Moore’s Law.
47:1594:90327:0:32:94:197:686:14:g_d0_f4:14:g_d0_f4:C:9.Conclusion
47:1595:90339:32:19:94:518:654:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:A key assumption of many endogenous growth models is that a constant number of
47:1596:90417:19:19:94:518:635:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:researchers can generate constant exponential growth.  We show that this assumption
47:1597:90500:19:18:94:518:616:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:corresponds to the hypothesis that the total factor productivity of the idea production
47:1598:90587:18:19:94:518:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:function is constant, and we proceed to measure research productivity in many differ-
47:1599:90672:19:19:94:157:579:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ent contexts.
47:1600:90685:19:19:111:518:560:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Our  robust  finding  is  that  research  productivity  is  falling  sharply  everywhere  we
47:1601:90777:19:19:94:518:541:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:look.  Taking the U.S. aggregate number as representative,  research productivity falls
47:1602:90864:19:19:94:518:522:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in half every 13 years — ideas are getting harder and harder to find.   Put differently,
47:1603:90952:19:19:94:518:503:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:just to sustain constant growth in GDP per person, the U.S. must double the amount of
47:1604:91037:19:19:94:518:484:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:research effort searching for new ideas every 13 years to offset the increased difficulty
47:1605:91126:19:19:94:196:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of finding new ideas.
47:1606:91147:19:19:111:518:446:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:This  analysis  has  implications  for  the  growth  models  that  economists  use  in  our
47:1607:91238:19:19:94:518:427:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:own research,  like those cited in the introduction.   The standard approach in recent
47:1608:91324:19:19:94:518:408:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:years employs models that assume constant research productivity, in part because it
47:1609:91407:19:19:94:518:389:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is convenient and in part because the earlier literature has been interpreted as being
47:1610:91493:19:19:94:518:370:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:inconclusive on the extent to which this is problematic. We believe the empirical work
47:1611:91579:19:19:94:518:351:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:we have presented speaks clearly against this assumption.  A first-order fact of growth
47:1612:91666:19:19:94:362:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:empirics is that research productivity is falling sharply.
47:1613:91724:19:19:111:518:313:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Future work in the growth literature should determine how best to understand this
47:1614:91805:19:19:94:518:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:fact. One possibility is the semi-endogenous growth models discussed in the preceding
47:1615:91890:19:19:94:518:275:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:section.   These models have important implications.   For example,  they have a “Red
47:1616:91975:19:19:94:518:256:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Queen” prediction in which we have to run faster and faster to maintain constant ex-
47:1617:92059:19:19:94:518:237:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ponential growth.24If the growth rate of research inputs were to slow, this could cause
47:1618:92146:19:19:94:518:218:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:economic growth itself to slow down.  It is possible that this contributes to the global
47:1619:92234:19:19:94:399:199:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:slowdown in productivity growth during the past fifteen years.
47:1620:92296:19:19:111:518:180:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:One way in which the overall interpretation of the evidence in this paper could be
47:1621:92378:19:19:94:518:161:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:wrong is if there is indeed declining research productivity in every sector, but the entire
47:1622:92469:19:19:94:518:142:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:increase  in  aggregate  R&D  occurs  in  making  quality/productivity  improvements  for
47:1623:92558:19:16:94:518:123:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:individual varieties. The separate idea production function for producing new varieties
47:1624:92645:16:15:103:518:107:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:24Recall Lewis Carroll’sThrough the Looking Glass: “Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can
47:1625:92749:15:10:94:518:92:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:do, to keep in the same place.  If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as
47:1626:92854:10:0:94:117:82:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:that!”
48:1627:92895:0:19:94:518:686:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:could then exhibit constant research productivity if in fact the research going to create
48:1628:92984:19:19:94:518:667:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:new varieties is not increasing over time.  While this is conceptually possible, it seems
48:1629:93073:19:19:94:518:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:unlikely.  We do not have any growth models in the literature that suggest this could
48:1630:93158:19:19:94:518:629:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:occur  in  an  equilibrium  in  which  there  is  population  growth.   Why,  despite  a  grow-
48:1631:93253:19:19:94:518:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ing population and constant research productivity,  would the equilibrium allocation
48:1632:93337:19:19:94:518:591:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:feature  a  constant  number  of  researchers  creating  new  varieties?   Nevertheless,  this
48:1633:93431:19:19:94:377:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:loophole is one that future research may wish to consider.
48:1634:93489:19:19:111:518:553:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Alternatively, there are other possible explanations for declining research produc-
48:1635:93572:19:19:94:518:534:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tivity. Incumbent firms may be shifting to “defensive” R&D to protect their market posi-
48:1636:93660:19:19:94:518:515:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tion, and this could cause research productivity to decline; Dinopoulos and Syropoulos
48:1637:93746:19:19:94:518:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(2007) provide a model along these lines. Or perhaps declines in basic research spend-

48:1640:94016:19:19:94:252:439:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:important policy implications.25

48:1643:94232:19:19:94:518:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:reason models with declining research productivity can sustain exponential growth in
48:1644:94316:19:19:94:518:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:living standards is because of the key insight from that literature:  ideas are nonrival.
48:1645:94405:19:19:94:518:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:And if research productivity were constant, sustained growth would actually not require

48:1649:94756:19:19:94:518:268:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:dogenous growth theory is not that research productivity is constant or that subsidies
48:1650:94842:19:19:94:518:249:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to research can necessarily raise growth.   Rather it is that ideas are different from all
