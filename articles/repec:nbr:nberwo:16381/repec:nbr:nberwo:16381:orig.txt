2:39:2160:28:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:In Project STAR, 11,571 students in Tennessee and their teachers were randomly assigned to classrooms
2:40:2261:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:within their schools from kindergarten to third grade. This paper evaluates the long-term impacts of
2:41:2361:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:STAR by linking the experimental data to administrative records. We first demonstrate that kindergarten
2:42:2464:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:test scores are highly correlated with outcomes such as earnings at age 27, college attendance, home
2:43:2564:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ownership, and retirement savings. We then document four sets of experimental impacts. First, students
2:44:2666:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:in small classes are significantly more likely to attend college and exhibit improvements on other outcomes.
2:45:2774:14:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Class size does not have a significant effect on earnings at age 27, but this effect is imprecisely estimated.
2:46:2884:14:14:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Second, students who had a more experienced teacher in kindergarten have higher earnings. Third,
2:47:2980:14:14:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:an analysis of variance reveals significant classroom effects on earnings. Students who were randomly
2:48:3081:14:14:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:assigned to higher quality classrooms in grades K-3 – as measured by classmates' end-of-class test
2:49:3179:14:14:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:scores – have higher earnings, college attendance rates, and other outcomes. Finally, the effects of
2:50:3279:14:42:72:526:420:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:class quality fade out on test scores in later grades but gains in non-cognitive measures persist.

3:92:4153:0:32:256:356:709:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:I.  Introduction
3:93:4169:32:20:72:540:677:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:What are the long-term impacts of early childhood education?  Evidence on this important policy
3:94:4264:20:20:72:540:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:question remains scarce because of a lack of data linking childhood education and outcomes in
3:95:4357:20:21:72:540:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:adulthood.  This paper analyzes the long-term impacts of Project STAR, one of the most widely
3:96:4450:21:20:72:540:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:studied education experiments in the United States.  The Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio
3:97:4540:20:20:72:540:596:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(STAR) experiment randomly assigned one cohort of 11,571 students and their teachers to di§erent
3:98:4636:20:21:72:540:576:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:classrooms within their schools in grades K-3.  Some students were assigned to small classes (15
3:99:4732:21:20:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:students on average) in grades K-3, while others were assigned to large classes (22 students on
3:100:4827:20:20:72:540:535:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:average).  The experiment was implemented across 79 schools in Tennessee from 1985 to 1989.
3:101:4918:20:20:72:540:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Numerous studies have used the STAR experiment to show that class size, teacher quality, and
3:102:5010:20:21:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:peers have signiÖcant causal impacts on test scores (see Schanzenbach 2006 for a review). Whether
3:103:5107:21:20:72:540:474:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:these gains in achievement on standardized tests translate into improvements in adult outcomes
3:104:5201:20:20:72:278:454:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:such as earnings remains an open question.
3:105:5243:20:21:88:539:434:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We link the original STAR data to administrative data from tax returns, allowing us to follow
3:106:5336:21:20:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:95% of the STAR participants into adulthood.1We use these data to analyze the impacts of STAR
3:107:5429:20:20:72:540:393:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on outcomes ranging from college attendance and earnings to retirement savings, home ownership,
3:108:5524:20:21:72:540:373:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and marriage.  We begin by documenting the strong correlation between kindergarten test scores
3:109:5618:21:20:72:540:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and adult outcomes. A one percentile increase in end-of-kindergarten (KG) test scores is associated
3:110:5717:20:20:72:540:332:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with a $132 increase in wage earnings at age 27 in the raw data, and a $94 increase after controlling
3:111:5818:20:21:72:540:312:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for parental characteristics.   Several other adult outcomes ñ such as college attendance rates,
3:112:5914:21:20:72:540:291:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:quality of college attended, home ownership, and 401(k) savings ñ are also all highly correlated
3:113:6010:20:20:72:540:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with kindergarten test scores.  These strong correlations motivate the main question of the paper:
3:114:6108:20:21:72:543:251:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:do classroom environments that raise test scores ñ such as smaller classes and better teachers ñ
3:115:6204:21:20:72:312:230:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:cause analogous improvements in adult outcomes?
3:116:6251:20:20:88:539:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our analysis of the experimental impacts combines two empirical strategies. First, we study the
3:117:6346:20:21:72:540:190:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:impacts of observable classroom characteristics. We analyze the impacts of class size using the same
3:118:6446:21:20:72:540:169:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:intent-to-treat speciÖcations as Krueger (1999), who showed that students in small classes scored
3:119:6543:20:20:72:540:149:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:higher on standardized tests.  We Önd that students assigned to small classes are 1.8 percentage
3:120:6639:20:16:72:540:129:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:points more likely to be enrolled in college at age 20, a signiÖcant improvement relative to the mean
3:121:6740:16:15:84:539:113:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:1The data for this project were analyzed through a program developed by the Statistics of Income (SOI) Division
3:122:6851:15:11:72:540:98:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:at the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to support research into the e§ects of tax policy on economic and social outcomes
3:123:6969:11:0:72:275:87:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:and improve the administration of the tax system.
4:124:7018:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:college attendance rate of 26.4% at age 20 in the sample.  We do not Önd signiÖcant di§erences in
4:125:7115:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings at age 27 between students who were in small and large classes, although these earnings
4:126:7211:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:impacts are imprecisely estimated.  Students in small classes also exhibit statistically signiÖcant
4:127:7310:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:improvements on a summary index of the other outcomes we examine (home ownership, 401(k)
4:128:7398:21:20:72:463:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:savings, mobility rates, percent college graduate in ZIP code, and marital status).
4:129:7481:20:20:88:539:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We study variation across classrooms along other observable dimensions, such as teacher and
4:130:7572:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:peer characteristics, using a similar approach.  Prior studies (e.g. Krueger 1999) have shown that
4:131:7670:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:STAR students with more experienced teachers score higher on tests.  We Önd similar impacts
4:132:7761:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on earnings.  Students randomly assigned to a KG teacher with more than 10 years of experience
4:133:7855:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earn an extra$1;093(6.9% of mean income) on average at age 27 relative to students with less
4:134:7947:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:experienced teachers.2We also test whether observable peer characteristics have long-term impacts
4:135:8044:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by regressing earnings on the fraction of low-income, female, and black peers in KG. These peer
4:136:8139:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:impacts are not signiÖcant, but are very imprecisely estimated because of the limited variation in
4:137:8237:21:20:72:253:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:peer characteristics across classrooms.
4:138:8276:20:20:88:539:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Because we have few measures of observable classroom characteristics, we turn to a second
4:139:8365:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:empirical strategy that captures both observed and unobserved aspects of classrooms.  We use an
4:140:8460:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:analysis of variance approach analogous to that in the teacher e§ects literature to test whether
4:141:8556:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings are clustered by kindergarten classroom.  Because we observe each teacher only once
4:142:8648:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in our data, we can only estimate ìclass e§ectsî ñ the combined e§ect of teachers, peers, and
4:143:8741:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:any class-level shock ñby exploiting random assignment to KG classrooms of both students and
4:144:8833:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:teachers.  Intuitively, we test whether earnings vary across KG classes by more than what would
4:145:8928:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:be predicted by random variation in student abilities.  AnFtest rejects the null hypothesis that
4:146:9024:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:KG classroom assignment has no e§ect on earnings.  The standard deviation of class e§ects on
4:147:9116:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:annual earnings is approximately 10% of mean earnings, highlighting the large stakes at play in
4:148:9211:20:21:72:198:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:early childhood education.
4:149:9237:21:20:88:539:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The analysis of variance shows that kindergarten classroom assignment has signiÖcant impacts
4:150:9329:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on earnings, but it does not tell us whether classrooms that improve scores also generate earnings
4:151:9427:20:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:gains.  That is, are class e§ects on earnings correlated with class e§ects on scores?  To analyze
4:152:9524:21:20:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:this question, we proxy for each studentís KG ìclass qualityî by the average test scores of his
4:153:9619:20:16:72:540:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:classmates at the end of kindergarten.  We show that end-of-class peer test scores are an omnibus
4:154:9716:16:15:84:539:103:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:2Because teacher experience is correlated with many other unobserved attributes ñ such as attachment to the
4:155:9823:15:11:72:540:88:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:teaching profession ñwe cannot conclude that increasing teacher experience would improve student outcomes.  This
4:156:9935:11:0:72:483:77:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:evidence simply establishes that a studentís KG teacher has e§ects on his or her earnings as an adult.
5:157:10038:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:measure of class quality because they capture peer e§ects, teacher e§ects, and all other classroom
5:158:10136:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:characteristics that a§ect test scores.  Using this measure, we Önd that kindergarten class quality
5:159:10235:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:has signiÖcant impacts on both test scores and earnings. Students randomly assigned to a classroom
5:160:10333:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that is one standard deviation higher in quality earn 3% more at age 27.  Students assigned to
5:161:10427:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:higher quality classes are also signiÖcantly more likely to attend college, enroll in higher quality
5:162:10527:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:colleges, and exhibit improvements in the summary index of other outcomes.  The class quality
5:163:10620:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:impacts are similar for students who entered the experiment in grades 1-3 and were randomized
5:164:10713:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:into classes at that point.  Hence, the Öndings of this paper should be viewed as evidence on the
5:165:10810:20:20:72:486:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:long-term impacts of early childhood education rather than kindergarten in particular.
5:166:10896:20:21:88:539:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our analysis of ìclass qualityîmust be interpreted very carefully. The purpose of this analysis
5:167:10991:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is to detect clustering in outcomes at the classroom level: are a childís outcomes correlated with
5:168:11089:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:his peersíoutcomes?  Although we test for such clustering by regressing own scores and earnings
5:169:11184:20:21:72:539:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on peer test scores, we emphasize that such regressions arenotintended to detect peer e§ects.
5:170:11277:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Because we use post-intervention peer scores as the regressor, these scores incorporate the impacts
5:171:11376:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of peer quality, teacher quality, and any random class-level shock (such as noise from construction
5:172:11475:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:outside the classroom).  The correlation between own outcomes and peer scores could be due to
5:173:11568:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:any of these factors.  Our analysis shows that the classroom a student was assigned to in early
5:174:11663:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:childhood matters for outcomes 20 years later, but does not shed light on which speciÖc factors
5:175:11758:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:should be manipulated to improve adult outcomes.  Further research on which factors contribute
5:176:11852:21:20:72:493:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to high ìclass qualityîwould be extremely valuable in light of the results reported here.
5:177:11941:20:20:88:539:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The impacts of early childhood class assignment on adult outcomes may be particularly surpris-
5:178:12035:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ing because the impacts on test scores ìfade outîrapidly.  The impacts of class size on test scores
5:179:12134:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:become statistically insigniÖcant by grade 8 (Krueger and Whitmore 2001), as do the impacts of
5:180:12228:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:class quality on test scores.  Why do the impacts of early childhood education fade out on test
5:181:12323:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:scores but re-emerge in adulthood? We Önd some suggestive evidence that part of the explanation
5:182:12418:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:may be non-cognitive skills. We Önd that KG class quality has signiÖcant impacts on non-cognitive
5:183:12515:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:measures in 4th and 8th grade such as e§ort, initiative, and lack of disruptive behavior.  These
5:184:12611:20:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:non-cognitive measures are highly correlated with earnings even conditional on test scores but are
5:185:12709:21:20:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:not signiÖcant predictors of future standardized test scores. These results suggest that high quality
5:186:12810:20:20:72:540:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:KG classrooms may build non-cognitive skills that have returns in the labor market but do not
5:187:12903:20:20:72:540:99:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:improve performance on standardized tests. While this evidence is far from conclusive, it highlights
5:188:13003:20:0:72:366:79:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the value of further empirical research on non-cognitive skills.
6:189:13068:0:21:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In addition to the extensive literature on the impacts of STAR on test scores, our study builds
6:190:13163:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on and contributes to a recent literature investigating selected long-term impacts of class size in
6:191:13262:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the STAR experiment.  These studies have shown that students assigned to small classes are more
6:192:13357:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:likely to complete high school (Finn, Gerber, and Boyd-Zaharias 2005) and take the SAT or ACT
6:193:13450:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:college entrance exams (Krueger and Whitmore 2001) and are less likely to be arrested for crime
6:194:13545:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(Krueger and Whitmore 2001). Most recently, Muennig et al. (2010) report that students in small
6:195:13640:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:classes have higher mortality rates, a Önding that we do not obtain in our data as we discuss below.
6:196:13740:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We contribute to this literature by providing a uniÖed evaluation of several outcomes, including
6:197:13836:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the Örst analysis of earnings, and by examining the impacts of teachers, peers, and other attributes
6:198:13936:20:21:72:268:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the classroom in addition to class size.
6:199:13979:21:20:88:539:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our results also complement the Öndings of studies on the long-term impacts of other early
6:200:14069:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:childhood interventions, such as the Perry and Abecederian preschool demonstrations and the
6:201:14160:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Head Start program, which also Önd lasting impacts on adult outcomes despite fade-out on test
6:202:14253:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:scores (see Almond and Currie 2010 for a review).  We show that a better classroom environment
6:203:14347:20:20:72:526:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:from ages 5-8 can have substantial long-term beneÖts even without intervention at earlier ages.
6:204:14442:20:21:88:539:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The paper is organized as follows.  In Section II, we review the STAR experimental design
6:205:14531:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and address potential threats to the validity of the experiment.  Section III documents the cross-
6:206:14629:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sectional correlation between test scores and adult outcomes.  Section IV analyzes the impacts of
6:207:14726:20:21:72:543:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:observable characteristics of classrooms ñ size, teacher characteristics, and peer characteristics ñ
6:208:14826:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on adult outcomes.  In Section V, we study class e§ects more broadly, incorporating unobservable
6:209:14922:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:aspects of class quality.   Section VI documents the fade-out and re-emergence e§ects and the
6:210:15015:20:35:72:482:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:potential role of non-cognitive skills in explaining this pattern.  Section VI concludes.

6:212:15137:24:28:72:261:223:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:II.A.  Background on Project STAR
6:213:15170:28:20:72:540:195:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Word et al. (1990), Krueger (1999), and Finn et al. (2007) provide a comprehensive summary of
6:214:15263:20:20:72:540:175:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Project STAR; here, we brieáy review the features of the STAR experiment most relevant for our
6:215:15357:20:21:72:540:155:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:analysis.  The STAR experiment was conducted at 79 schools across the state of Tennessee over
6:216:15450:21:20:72:540:134:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:four years.  The program oversampled lower-income schools, and thus the STAR sample exhibits
6:217:15542:20:20:72:540:114:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:lower socioeconomic characteristics than the state of Tennessee and the U.S. population as a whole.
6:218:15641:20:21:88:539:94:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In the 1985-86 school year, 6,323 kindergarten students in participating schools were randomly
6:219:15735:21:0:72:540:73:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:assigned to a small (target size 13-17 students) or regular-sized (20-25 students) class within their
7:220:15837:0:21:72:539:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:schools.3Students were intended to remain in the same class type (small vs. large) through 3rd
7:221:15931:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:grade, at which point all students would return to regular classes for 4th grade and subsequent years.
7:222:16033:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:As the initial cohort of kindergarten students advanced across grade levels, there was substantial
7:223:16131:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:attrition because students who moved away from a participating school or were retained in grade
7:224:16226:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:no longer received treatment.  In addition, because kindergarten was not mandatory and due to
7:225:16319:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:normal residential mobility, many children joined the initial cohort at the participating schools after
7:226:16422:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:kindergarten. A total of 5,248 students entered the participating schools in grades 1-3. These new
7:227:16520:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:entrants were randomly assigned to classrooms within school upon entry.  Thus all students were
7:228:16615:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:randomized to classrooms within school upon entry, regardless of the entry grade. As a result, the
7:229:16713:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:randomization pool is school-by-entry-grade, and we include school-by-entry-grade Öxed e§ects in
7:230:16809:21:20:72:226:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:all experimental analyzes below.
7:231:16841:20:20:88:539:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Upon entry into one of the 79 schools, the study design randomly assigned students not only
7:232:16932:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to class type (small vs. large) but also to a classroom within each type (if there were multiple
7:233:17028:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:classrooms per type, as was the case in 50 of the 79 schools). Teachers were also randomly assigned
7:234:17127:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to classrooms.  Unfortunately, the exact protocol of randomization into speciÖc classrooms was
7:235:17221:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:not clearly documented in any of the o¢ cial STAR reports, where the emphasis was instead the
7:236:17314:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:random assignment into class type rather than classroom (Word et al. 1990). We present statistical
7:237:17412:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:evidence conÖrming that both students and teachers indeed appear to be randomly assigned directly
7:238:17509:20:21:72:459:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to classrooms upon entry into the STAR project, as the original designers attest.
7:239:17590:21:20:88:539:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:As in any Öeld experiment, there were some deviations from the experimental protocol.  In
7:240:17679:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:particular, some students moved from large to small classes and vice versa.  To account for such
7:241:17775:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:potentially non-random sorting, we adopt the standard approach taken in the literature and assign
7:242:17872:21:20:72:407:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:treatment status based on initial random assignment (intent-to-treat).
7:243:17942:20:20:88:539:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In each year, students were administered the grade-appropriate Stanford Achievement Test, a
7:244:18033:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:multiple choice test that measures performance in math and reading.  These tests were given only
7:245:18129:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to students participating in STAR, as the regular statewide testing program did not extend to the
7:246:18226:20:20:72:539:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:early grades.4Following Krueger (1999), we standardize the math and reading scale scores in each
7:247:18322:20:16:71:539:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:grade by computing the scale scoreís corresponding percentile rank in the distribution for students
7:248:18421:16:15:84:539:144:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:3There was also a third treatment group: regular sized class with a full-time teacherís aide. This was a relatively
7:249:18536:15:11:71:539:129:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:minor intervention, since all regular classes were already assigned a 1/3 time teacherís aide. Prior studies of STAR
7:250:18652:11:11:71:539:118:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:Önd no impact of a full-time teacherís aide on test scores.  We follow the convention in the literature and group the
7:251:18769:11:7:71:294:107:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:regular and regular plus aide class treatments together.
7:252:18825:7:15:84:539:100:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:4These K-3 test scores contain considerable predictive content.  As reported in Krueger Whitmore (2001), the
7:253:18933:15:11:71:539:85:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:correlation between test scores in grades g and g+1 is 0.65 for KG and 0.80 for each grade 1-3.  The values for grades
7:254:19051:11:0:71:474:74:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:4-7 lie between 0.83 and 0.88, suggesting that the K-3 test scores contain similar predictive content.
8:255:19154:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in large classes.  We then assign the appropriate percentile rank to students in small classes and
8:256:19252:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:take the average across math and reading percentile ranks. Note that this percentile measure is a

8:259:19439:28:20:72:540:611:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We measure adult outcomes of Project STAR participants using administrative data from United
8:260:19531:20:20:72:540:591:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:States tax records. 95.0% of STAR records were linked to the tax data using an algorithm based on
8:261:19628:20:21:72:540:571:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:standard identiÖers (SSN, date of birth, gender, and names) that is described in Online Appendix

8:263:19727:20:20:88:539:530:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We obtain data on students and their parents from federal tax forms such as 1040 individual
8:264:19818:20:21:72:540:510:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:income tax returns.  Information from 1040ís is available from 1996-2008.  Approximately 10%
8:265:19910:21:20:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of adults do not Öle individual income tax returns in a given year.  We use third-party reports
8:266:20005:20:20:72:540:469:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to obtain information such as wage earnings (form W-2) and college attendance (form 1098-T) for
8:267:20100:20:21:72:540:449:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:all individuals, including those who do not Öle 1040s.  Data from these third-party reports are
8:268:20195:21:20:72:540:428:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:available since 1999.  The year always refers to the tax year (i.e., the calendar year in which the
8:269:20294:20:20:72:540:408:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:income is earned or the college expense incurred). In most cases, tax returns for tax yeartare Öled
8:270:20393:20:21:72:539:388:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:during the calendar yeart+1. The analysis dataset combines selected variables from individual tax
8:271:20490:21:20:72:540:367:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:returns, third party reports, and information from the STAR database, with individual identiÖers

8:273:20620:20:21:88:539:327:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We now describe how each of the adult outcome measures and control variables used in the
8:274:20708:21:20:72:540:306:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:empirical analysis is constructed.  Table I reports summary statistics for these variables for the
8:275:20806:20:20:72:540:286:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:STAR sample as well as a random 0.25% sample of the US population born in the same years
8:276:20894:20:21:72:131:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(1979-1980).

8:278:20997:20:20:72:539:225:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for both Ölers and non-Ölers.6We deÖne earnings in each year as the sum of earnings on all W-2
8:279:21091:20:20:72:540:205:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:forms Öled on an individualís behalf.  We express all monetary variables in 2009 dollars, adjusting
8:280:21190:20:21:72:540:185:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for ináation using the Consumer Price Index.  We cap earnings in each year at $100,000 to reduce
8:281:21286:21:16:72:540:164:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the ináuence of outliers; fewer than 1% of individuals in the STAR sample report earnings above

8:283:21493:15:10:72:540:133:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:that the matching algorithm was su¢ ciently precise that it uncovered 28 cases in the original STAR dataset that were
8:284:21610:10:8:72:530:123:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:a single split observation or duplicate records. After consolidating these records, we are left with 11,571 students.
8:285:21727:8:14:84:539:115:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:6We obtain similar results using household adjusted gross income reported on individual tax returns. We focus on
8:286:21839:14:11:72:540:101:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:the W-2 measure because it provides a consistent deÖnition of individual wage earnings for both Ölers and non-Ölers.
8:287:21955:11:0:72:415:90:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:One limitation of the W-2 easure is that it does not include self-employment income.
9:288:22040:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:$100,000 in a given year. To increase precision, we typically use average (ináation indexed) earnings
9:289:22141:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:from year 2005 to 2007 as an outcome measure. The mean individual earnings for the STAR sample
9:290:22235:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in 2005-2007 (when the STAR students are 25-27 years old) is $15,912.  This earnings measure
9:291:22327:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:includes zeros for the 13.9% of STAR students who report no income 2005-2007. The mean level of
9:292:22422:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings in the STAR sample is lower than in the same cohort in the U.S. population, as expected
9:293:22518:20:20:72:373:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:given that Project STAR targeted more disadvantaged schools.

9:297:22870:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:schools and other postsecondary institutions.  Comparisons to other data sources indicate that
9:298:22964:21:20:72:539:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1098-T forms accurately capture US college enrollment.8We have data on college attendance from
9:299:23058:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1098-T forms for all students in our sample since 1999, when the STAR students were 19 years
9:300:23150:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:old.  We deÖne college attendance as an indicator for having one or more 1098-T forms Öled on
9:301:23243:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:oneís behalf in a given year.  In the STAR sample, 26.4% of students are enrolled in college at age
9:302:23342:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:20 (year 2000). 45.5% of students are enrolled in college at some point between 1999 and 2007,
9:303:23436:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:compared with 57.1% in the same cohort of the U.S. population. Because the data are based purely
9:304:23532:21:20:72:515:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on tuition payments, we have no information about college completion or degree attainment.
9:305:23622:20:20:88:539:363:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:College Quality.Using the institutional identiÖers on the 1098-T forms, we construct an
9:306:23709:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings-based index of college quality as follows. First, using the full population of all individuals
9:307:23812:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the United States aged 20 on 12/31/1999 and all 1098-T forms for year 1999, we group individuals
9:308:23911:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by the higher education institution they attended in 1999.  This sample contains over 1.4 million
9:309:24008:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:individuals.9We take a 1% sample of those not attending a higher education institution in 1999,
9:310:24103:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:comprising another 27,733 individuals, and pool them together in a separate ìno collegeîcategory.
9:311:24200:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Next, we compute average earnings of the students in 2007 when they are aged 28 by grouping
9:312:24291:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:students according to the educational institution they attended in 1999.   This earnings-based
9:313:24385:21:15:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:index of college quality is highly correlated with the US News ranking of the best 125 colleges and
9:314:24484:15:15:84:539:185:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:7These forms are used to administer the Hope and Lifetime Learning education tax credits created by the Taxpayer
9:315:24596:15:11:72:540:170:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:Relief Act of 1997.  Colleges are not required to Öle 1098-T forms for students whose qualiÖed tuition and related
9:316:24710:11:11:72:540:159:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:expenses are waived or paid entirely with scholarships or grants; however, in many instances the forms are available
9:317:24826:11:7:72:372:148:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:even for such cases, perhaps because of automation at the university level.
9:318:24901:7:15:84:539:141:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:8In 2009, 27.4 million 1098-T forms were issued (Internal Revenue Service, 2010).  According to the Current
9:319:25008:15:11:72:540:126:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:Population Survey (US Census Bureau, 2010, Tables V and VI), in October 2008, there were 22.6 million students in
9:320:25121:11:11:72:540:115:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:the U.S. (13.2 million full time, 5.4 million part-time, and 4 million vocational).  As an individual can be a student
9:321:25239:11:11:72:540:104:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:at some point during the year but not in October and can receive a 1098-T form from more than one institution, the
9:322:25353:11:7:72:534:93:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:number of 1098-T forms for the calendar year should indeed be higher than the number of students as of October.
9:323:25464:7:14:84:539:86:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:9Individuals who attended more than one institution in 1999 are counted as students at all institutions they
9:324:25572:14:0:72:110:72:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:attended.
10:325:25582:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:universities: the correlation coe¢ cient of our measure and the log US news rank is 0.75.  The
10:326:25676:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:advantages of our index are that while the US News ranking only covers the top 125 institutions,
10:327:25772:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ours covers all higher education institutions in the U.S. and provides a simple cardinal metric for
10:328:25871:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:college quality.  Among colleges attended by STAR students, the average value of our earnings
10:329:25964:21:20:72:539:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:index is $35,080 for four-year colleges and $26,920 for two-year colleges.10For students who did
10:330:26060:20:20:72:332:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:not attend college, the imputed mean wage is $16,475.
10:331:26113:20:21:88:539:587:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:Other Outcomes.We identify spouses using information from 1040 forms.  For individuals
10:332:26199:21:20:71:539:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:who Öle tax returns, we deÖne an indicator for marriage based on whether the tax return is Öled
10:333:26294:20:20:71:539:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:jointly.  We code non-Ölers as single because most non-Ölers in the U.S. who are not receiving
10:334:26388:20:21:71:539:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Social Security beneÖts are single (Cilke 1998, Table I). We deÖne a measure of ever being married
10:335:26486:21:20:71:539:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by age 27 as an indicator for ever Öling a joint tax return in any year between 1999 and 2007.  By
10:336:26584:20:20:71:432:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:this measure, 43.2% of individuals are married at some point before age 27.
10:337:26659:20:21:88:539:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We measure retirement savings using contributions to 401(k) accounts reported on W-2 forms
10:338:26749:21:20:71:539:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:from 1999-2007.  28.2% of individuals in the sample make a 401(k) contribution at some point
10:339:26841:20:20:71:539:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:during this period.  We measure home ownership using data from the 1098 form, a third party
10:340:26932:20:21:71:539:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:report Öled by lenders to report mortgage interest payments. We include the few individuals who
10:341:27027:21:20:71:539:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:report a mortgage deduction on their 1040 forms but do not have 1098ís as homeowners. We deÖne
10:342:27121:20:20:71:539:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:any individual who has a mortgage interest deduction at any point between 1999 and 2007 as a

10:345:27399:20:20:71:539:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:individuals own a home by age 27.  We use data from 1040 forms to identify each householdís ZIP
10:346:27494:20:21:71:539:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:code of residence in each year. For non-Ölers, we use the ZIP code of the address to which the W-2
10:347:27592:21:20:71:539:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:form was mailed.  If an individual did not Öle and has no W-2 in a given year, we impute current
10:348:27688:20:20:71:539:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ZIP code as the last observed ZIP code. We deÖne a measure of cross-state mobility by an indicator
10:349:27786:20:21:71:539:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for whether the individual ever lived outside Tennessee between 1999 and 2007.  27.5% of STAR
10:350:27879:21:20:71:539:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:students lived outside Tennessee at some point between age 19 and 27.  We construct a measure
10:351:27972:20:20:71:539:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of neighborhood quality using data on the percentage of college graduates in the individualís 2007
10:352:28070:20:21:71:539:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ZIP code from the 2000 Census.  On average, STAR students lived in 2007 in neighborhoods with
10:353:28163:21:20:71:187:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:17.6% college graduates.

10:355:28279:16:15:80:539:103:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:10For the small fraction of STAR students who attend more than one college in a single year, we deÖne college

11:358:28581:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(in days divided by 365.25) as of September 1, 1985.  Virtually all students in STAR were born in
11:359:28678:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the years 1979-1980.  To simplify the exposition, we say that the cohort of STAR children is aged
11:360:28775:20:21:72:539:648:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f2:ain year1980 +a(e.g., STAR children are 27 in 2007). Approximately 1.7% of the STAR sample
11:361:28865:21:20:72:168:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is deceased by 2009.
11:362:28885:20:20:88:539:607:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:Parent Characteristics.We link STAR children to their parents by Önding the earliest 1040
11:363:28974:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:form from 1996-2008 on which the STAR student was claimed as dependents.  Most matches were
11:364:29065:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:found on 1040 forms for the tax year 1996, when the STAR children were 16.  We identify parents
11:365:29160:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for 86% of the STAR students in our linked dataset.  The remaining students are likely to have
11:366:29254:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:parents who did not Öle tax returns in the early years of the sample when they could have claimed
11:367:29351:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:their child as a dependent, making it impossible to link the children to their parents.  Note that
11:368:29449:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:this deÖnition of parents is based on who claims the child as a dependent, and thus may not reáect
11:369:29547:20:21:72:230:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the biological parent of the child.
11:370:29582:21:20:88:539:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We deÖne parental household income as average Adjusted Gross Income (capped at $252,000,
11:371:29670:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the 99th percentile in our sample) from 1996-1998, when the children were 16-18 years old.  For
11:372:29765:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:years in which parents did not Öle, we deÖne parental household income as zero.  For divorced
11:373:29858:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:parents, this income measure captures the total resources available to the household claiming the
11:374:29955:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:child as a dependent (including any alimony payments), rather than the sum of the individual
11:375:30047:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:incomes of the two parents.  By this measure, mean parent income is $48,010 (in 2009 dollars) for
11:376:30144:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:STAR students whom we are able to link to parents.  We deÖne marital status, home ownership,
11:377:30236:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and 401(k) saving as indicators for whether the parent who claims the STAR child ever Öles a joint
11:378:30334:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tax return, has a mortgage interest payment, or makes a 401(k) contribution over the period for
11:379:30429:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:which relevant data are available.  We deÖne motherís age at childís birth using data from Social
11:380:30526:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Security Administration records on birth dates for parents and children.  For single parents, we
11:381:30622:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:deÖne the motherís age at childís birth using the age of the Öler who claimed the child, who is
11:382:30717:21:20:72:539:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:typically the mother but is sometimes the father or another relative.11By this measure, mothers
11:383:30812:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are on average 25.0 years old when they give birth to a child in the STAR sample.  When a child
11:384:30907:20:16:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:cannot be matched to a parent, we deÖne all parental characteristics as zero, and we always include
11:385:31006:16:27:80:539:144:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:10Alternative deÖnitions of income for non-Ölers ñsuch as income reported on W-2ís starting in 1999 ñyield very
11:386:31117:27:7:72:230:117:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:similar results to those reported below.
11:387:31157:7:15:80:539:110:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:11We deÖne the motherís age at childís birth as missing for 471 observations in which the implied motherís age
11:388:31267:15:11:72:540:95:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:at birth based on the claiming parentís date of birth is below 13 or above 65.  These are typically cases where the
11:389:31382:11:0:72:351:84:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:parent does not have an accurate birth date recorded in the SSA Öle.

12:392:31622:20:20:71:539:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we use some demographic information from the STAR database in our analysis.  This includes
12:393:31712:20:21:71:539:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:gender, race (an indicator for being black), and whether the student ever received free or reduced
12:394:31810:21:20:71:539:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:price lunch during the experiment.  36% of the STAR sample are black and 60% are eligible for
12:395:31903:20:20:71:539:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:free or reduced-price lunches.  Finally, we use data on teacher characteristics ñexperience, race,
12:396:32001:20:21:71:539:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and highest degree ñfrom the STAR database. The average student has a teacher with 10.8 years
12:397:32094:21:20:71:539:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of experience. 19.5% of kindergarten students have a black teacher, and 35.9% have a teacher with
12:398:32191:20:20:71:203:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a masterís degree or higher.
12:399:32219:20:21:88:539:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our analysis dataset contains one observation for each of the 10,992 STAR students we link
12:400:32309:21:20:71:539:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to the tax data.  Each observation contains information on the studentís adult outcomes, parent
12:401:32404:20:20:71:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:characteristics, and classroom characteristics in the grade the studententeredthe STAR project
12:402:32498:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and was randomly assigned to a classroom. Hence, when we pool students across grades, we include
12:403:32594:21:29:72:343:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:test score and classroom data only from the entry grade.
12:404:32650:29:27:72:291:415:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:II.C.  Validity of the Experimental Design
12:405:32692:27:21:72:540:388:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The validity of the causal inferences that follow rests on two assumptions: successful randomization
12:406:32792:21:20:72:540:367:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of students into classrooms and no di§erences in attrition (match rates) across classrooms.  We
12:407:32887:20:20:72:232:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:now evaluate each of these issues.
12:408:32921:20:21:88:539:327:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:Randomization into Classrooms.To evaluate whether the randomization protocol was imple-
12:409:33008:21:20:72:540:306:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:mented as designed, we test for balance in pre-determined variables across classrooms. The original
12:410:33107:20:20:72:540:286:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:STAR dataset contains only a few pre-determined variables: age, gender, race, and free-lunch status.
12:411:33207:20:21:72:540:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Although the data are balanced on these characteristics, some skepticism naturally has remained
12:412:33302:21:20:72:356:245:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:because of the coarseness of the variables (Hanushek 2003).
12:413:33361:20:20:88:539:225:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The tax data allow us to improve upon the prior evidence on the validity of randomization
12:414:33450:20:20:72:540:205:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by investigating a wider variety of family background characteristics.   In particular, we check
12:415:33546:20:21:72:540:185:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for balance in the following Öve parental characteristics: household income, 401(k) savings, home
12:416:33643:21:20:72:540:164:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ownership, marital status, and motherís age at childís birth. Although most of these characteristics
12:417:33743:20:20:72:540:144:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are not measured prior to random assignment in 1985, they are measured prior to the STAR cohortís
12:418:33840:20:21:72:540:124:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:expected graduation from high school and are unlikely to be impacted by the childís classroom
12:419:33933:21:20:72:540:103:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:assignment in grades K-3.  We Örst establish that these parental characteristics are in fact strong
12:420:34032:20:0:72:540:83:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:predictors of student outcomes.  In column 1 of Table II, we regress the childís earnings on the
13:421:34130:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Öve parent characteristics, the studentís age, gender, race, and free-lunch status, and school-by-
13:422:34228:21:20:72:543:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:entry-grade Öxed e§ects. We also include indicators for missing data on certain variables (parentsí
13:423:34327:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:characteristics, motherís age, studentís free lunch status, and studentís race).  The student and
13:424:34424:20:21:72:451:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:parent demographic characteristics are highly signiÖcant predictors of earnings.
13:425:34504:21:20:88:539:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Having identiÖed a set of pre-determined characteristics that predict childrenís future earnings,
13:426:34601:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we test for balance in these covariates across classrooms. We Örst evaluate randomization into the
13:427:34699:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:small class treatment by regressing an indicator for being assigned to a small class upon entry on
13:428:34797:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the same variables as in column 1.  As shown in column 2 of Table II, none of the demographic
13:429:34890:20:20:72:539:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:characteristics predict the likelihood that a child is assigned to a small class. AnFtest for the joint
13:430:34993:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:signiÖcance of all the pre-determined demographic variables is insigniÖcant (p= 0:26), showing that
13:431:35092:21:20:72:435:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:students in small and large classes have similar demographic characteristics.
13:432:35169:20:20:88:539:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Columns 3-5 of Table II evaluate the random assignment of teachers to classes by regressing
13:433:35260:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:teacher characteristics ñexperience, bachelorís degree, and race ñon the same student and parent
13:434:35356:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:characteristics.  Again, none of the pre-determined variables predict the type of teacher a student
13:435:35455:20:20:72:423:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is assigned, consistent with random assignment of teachers to classrooms.
13:436:35528:20:21:88:539:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Finally, we evaluate whether students were randomly assigned into classrooms within small or
13:437:35620:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:large class types.  If students were randomly assigned to classrooms, then conditional on school
13:438:35716:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Öxed e§ects, classroom indicator variables should not predict any pre-determined characteristics of
13:439:35815:20:21:72:539:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the students. Column 6 of Table II reportspvalues fromFtests for the signiÖcance of kindergarten
13:440:35911:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:classroom indicators in regressions of each pre-determined characteristic on class and school Öxed
13:441:36009:20:20:72:539:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:e§ects.  None of theFtests is signiÖcant, showing that each of the parental and child character-
13:442:36105:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:istics is balanced across classrooms.  To test whether the pre-determined variables jointly predict
13:443:36204:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:classroom assignment, we predict earnings using the speciÖcation in column 1 of Table II. We then
13:444:36301:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:regress predicted earnings on KG classroom indicators and school Öxed e§ects and run anFtest
13:445:36393:20:21:72:539:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for the signiÖcance of the classroom indicators.  Thepvalue of thisFtest is0:92, conÖrming that
13:446:36488:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:one would not predict clustering of earnings by KG classroom based on pre-determined variables.
13:447:36583:20:20:72:539:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We use only kindergarten entrants for theFtests in column 6 becauseFtests for class e§ects
13:448:36673:20:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are not powerful in grades 1-3 as only a few students enter each class in those grades.  In Online
13:449:36771:21:20:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Appendix Table II, we extend these randomization tests to include students who entered in grades

14:453:37100:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:classrooms (Hanushek 2003).  Attrition is a much less serious concern in the present study than
14:454:37195:21:20:72:539:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in past evaluations of STAR because we are able to locate95%of the students in the tax data.
14:455:37287:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Nevertheless, we investigate whether the likelihood of being matched to the tax data varies by
14:456:37381:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:classroom assignment within schools.  In columns 1 and 2 of Table III, we test whether the match
14:457:37477:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rate varies signiÖcantly with class size by regressing an indicator for being matched on the small
14:458:37575:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:class dummy.  Column 1 includes no controls other than school-by-entry-grade Öxed e§ects.  It
14:459:37668:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:shows that, eliminating the between-school variation, the match rate in small and large classes
14:460:37763:21:20:72:539:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:di§ers by less than0:02percentage points.  Column 2 shows that controlling for the full set of
14:461:37857:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:demographic characteristics used in Table II does not uncover any signiÖcant di§erence in the
14:462:37950:20:21:72:538:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f4:match rate across class types.  Thepvalues reported at the bottom of columns 1 and 2 are forF
14:463:38043:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tests of the signiÖcance of classroom indicators in predicting match rates in regression speciÖcations
14:464:38145:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:analogous to those in column 6 of Table II. Thepvalues are approximately0:9, showing that there
14:465:38240:20:21:72:440:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are no signiÖcant di§erences in match rates across classrooms within schools.
14:466:38317:21:20:88:539:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Another potential source of attrition from the sample is through death.  Columns 3 and 4
14:467:38405:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:replicate the Örst two columns, replacing the dependent variable in the regressions with an indicator
14:468:38506:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for death before January 1, 2010.  We Önd no evidence that mortality rates vary with class size or
14:469:38604:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:across classrooms.  The di§erence in death rates between small and large classes is approximately
14:470:38701:20:20:72:539:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:0:01percentage points.  This Önding is inconsistent with recent results reported by Muennig et
14:471:38795:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:al. (2010), who Önd that students in small classes and regular classes with a certiÖed teaching
14:472:38890:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:assistant are slightly more likely to die using data from the National Death Index.  We Önd that
14:473:38986:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:154 STAR students have died by 2007 while Muennig et al. (2010) Önd 141 deaths in their data.
14:474:39079:20:35:72:477:282:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:The discrepancy between the Öndings might be due to di§erences in match quality.12
14:475:39161:35:31:123:488:247:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:III.  Test Scores and Adult Outcomes in the Cross-Section
14:476:39218:31:20:71:539:216:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We begin by documenting the correlations between test scores and adult outcomes in the cross-
14:477:39311:20:20:71:539:196:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:section to provide a benchmark for assessing the impacts of the randomized interventions.  Figure
14:478:39408:20:21:71:539:176:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Ia documents the association between end-of-kindergarten test scores and mean earnings from age
14:479:39503:21:16:71:539:155:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:25-27.13To construct this Ögure, we bin individuals into twenty equal-width bins (vingtiles) and
14:480:39599:16:15:80:539:139:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:12As 95% of STAR students are matched to the our data and have a valid Social Security Number, we believe
14:481:39704:15:11:71:539:124:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:that deaths are recorded accurately in our sample.  It is unclear why a lower match rate would lead to a systematic
14:482:39819:11:11:71:539:113:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:di§erence in death rates by class size.  However, given the small number of deaths, slight imbalances might generate
14:483:39935:11:7:71:337:102:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:marginally signiÖcant di§erences in death rates across class types.
14:484:40002:7:15:80:539:95:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:13Although individualsíearnings trajectories remain quite steep at age 27, earnings levels from ages 25-27 are highly
14:485:40119:15:0:71:539:80:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:correlated with earnings at later ages (Haider and Solon 2006), a Önding we have conÖrmed with our population wide
15:486:40235:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:plot mean earnings in each bin.  A one percentile point increase in KG test score is associated
15:487:40330:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with a $132 (0.83%) increase in earnings twenty years later. If one codes the x-axis using national
15:488:40429:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:percentiles on the standardized KG tests instead of within-sample percentiles, the earnings increase
15:489:40529:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is $154 per percentile.  The correlation between KG test score percentiles and earnings is linear
15:490:40626:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and remains signiÖcant even in the tails of the distribution of test scores. However, KG test scores
15:491:40726:20:20:72:539:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:explain only a small share of the variation in adult earnings: the adjustedR2of the regression of
15:492:40823:20:21:72:198:587:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:earnings on scores is 5%.14
15:493:40850:21:20:88:539:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Figures Ib and Ic show that KG test scores are highly predictive of college attendance rates and
15:494:40946:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the quality of the college the student attends, as measured by our earnings-based index of college
15:495:41044:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:quality. To analyze the other adult outcomes in a compact manner, we construct a summary index
15:496:41138:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of Öve outcomes: ever owning a home by 2007, 401(k) savings by 2007, ever married by 2007, ever
15:497:41233:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:living outside Tennessee by 2007, and living in a higher SES neighborhood in 2007 as measured
15:498:41326:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by the percent of college graduates living in the ZIP code.  Following Kling, Liebman, and Katz
15:499:41421:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(2007), we Örst standardize each outcome by subtracting its mean and dividing it by its standard
15:500:41517:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:deviation.  We then sum the Öve standardized outcomes and divide by the standard deviation
15:501:41607:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the sum to obtain an index that has a standard deviation of 1.  A higher value of the index
15:502:41701:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:represents more desirable outcomes.  Students with higher entry-year test scores have stronger
15:503:41795:20:20:72:431:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:adult outcomes as measured by the summary index, as shown in Figure Id.
15:504:41866:20:21:88:539:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The summary index should be interpreted as a broader measure of success in young adulthood.
15:505:41957:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Some of its elements proxy for future earnings conditional on current income. For example, having
15:506:42054:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:401(k) savings reáects holding a good job that o§ers such beneÖts.  Living outside Tennessee is
15:507:42149:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a proxy for cross-state mobility, which is typically associated with higher socio-economic status.
15:508:42247:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:While none of these outcomes are unambiguously positive ñfor instance, marriage or homeownership
15:509:42343:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by age 27 could in principle reáect imprudence ñ existing evidence suggests that, on net, these
15:510:42438:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:measures are associated with better outcomes.  In our sample, each of the Öve outcomes is highly
15:511:42534:21:20:72:496:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:positively correlated with test scores on its own, as shown in Online Appendix Table III.
15:512:42623:20:20:88:539:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table IV quantiÖes the correlations between test scores and adult outcomes. We report standard
15:513:42717:20:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:errors clustered by school in this and all subsequent tables.  Column 1 replicates Figure Ia by
15:514:42812:21:20:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:regressing earnings on KG test scores without any additional controls.  Column 2 controls for
15:515:42905:20:20:72:540:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:classroom Öxed e§ects and a vector of parent and student demographic characteristics.   The
15:516:42996:20:7:72:269:99:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:longitudinal data (see Online Appendix Table I).
15:517:43044:7:15:80:539:92:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:14These cross-sectional estimates are consistent with those obtained by Currie and Thomas (2001) using the British
15:518:43158:15:0:72:496:77:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:National Child Development Survey and Currie (2010) using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.
16:519:43260:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:parent characteristics are a quartic in parentís household income interacted with an indicator for
16:520:43358:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:whether the Öling parent is ever married between 1996 and 2008, motherís age at childís birth,
16:521:43452:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and indicators for parentís 401(k) savings and home ownership.  The student characteristics are
16:522:43547:20:21:72:539:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:gender, race, age at entry-year entry, and free lunch status.15We use this vector of demographic
16:523:43643:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:characteristics in most speciÖcations below. When the class Öxed e§ects and demographic controls
16:524:43739:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are included, the coe¢ cient on kindergarten percentile scores falls to $94, showing that part of
16:525:43836:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the raw correlation in Figure Ia is driven by these characteristics.  Equivalently, a one standard
16:526:43934:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:deviation (SD) increase in test scores is associated with an 18% increase in earnings conditional on
16:527:44034:20:20:72:207:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:demographic characteristics.
16:528:44062:20:21:88:539:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Columns 1 and 2 use only kindergarten entrants.  55% of students entered STAR in Kinder-
16:529:44150:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:garten, with 20%, 14% and 11% entering in grades 1 through 3, respectively. In column 3, we also
16:530:44246:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:include students who entered in grades 1-3 in order to obtain estimates consistent with the exper-
16:531:44344:20:21:72:542:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:imental analysis below, which pools all entrants.  To do so, we deÖne a studentís ìentry-gradeî
16:532:44439:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:test score as her score at the end of the grade in which she entered the experiment.  Column 3
16:533:44533:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:shows that a 1 percentile increase in entry-grade scores is associated with a $90 increase in earnings
16:534:44635:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:conditional on demographic controls. This $90 coe¢ cient is a weighted average of the correlations
16:535:44733:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:between grade K-3 test scores and earnings, with the weights given by the entry rates in each grade.
16:536:44833:20:20:88:539:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In column 4, we include both 8th grade scores (the last point at which data from standardized
16:537:44926:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tests are available for most students in the STAR sample) and entry-grade scores in the regression.
16:538:45025:21:20:72:539:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The entire e§ect of entry-grade test score is absorbed by the 8th grade score, but the adjustedR2is
16:539:45124:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:essentially unchanged.  In column 5, we compare the relative importance of parent characteristics
16:540:45221:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and cognitive ability as measured by test scores. We calculate the parentís income percentile rank
16:541:45319:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:using the tax data for the U.S. population.  We regress earnings on test scores, parentsíincome
16:542:45414:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:percentile, and controls for the studentís race, gender, age, and class Öxed e§ects. A one percentile
16:543:45515:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:point increase in parental income is associated with approximately a $148 increase in earnings,
16:544:45610:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:suggesting that parental background a§ects earnings as much as or more than cognitive ability in
16:545:45706:20:20:72:161:180:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:the cross section.16
16:546:45726:20:21:88:539:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Columns 6-9 of Table IV show the correlations between entry-grade test scores and the other
16:547:45817:21:15:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:outcomes we study. Conditional on demographic characteristics, a one percentile point increase in
16:548:45914:15:15:80:539:124:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:15We code all parental characteristics as 0 for students whose parents are missing, and include an indicator for
16:549:46026:15:11:72:540:109:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:missing parents as a control. We also include indicators for missing data on certain variables (motherís age, studentís
16:550:46145:11:7:72:413:98:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:free lunch status, and studentís race) and code these variables as zero when missing.
16:551:46230:7:0:80:527:91:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:16Moreover, this $148 coe¢ cient is an underestimate if parental income directly a§ects entry-grade test scores.
17:552:46344:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:entry-grade score is associated with a 0.36 percentage point increase in the probability of attending
17:553:46445:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:college at age 20 and a 0.51 percentage point increase in the probability of attending college at
17:554:46542:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:some point before age 27.  A one percentile point increase in score is associated with $32 higher
17:555:46639:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:predicted earnings based on the college the student attends and a 0.5% of a standard deviation

17:562:47254:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:outcomes, which motivates the central question of the paper: do classroom environments that raise
17:563:47351:20:34:72:411:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:early childhood test scores also yield improvements in adult outcomes?

17:565:47473:32:20:72:540:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In this section, we analyze the impacts of three features of classrooms that we can observe in our

17:574:48088:20:21:71:539:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:classrooms within schools in the Örst year they joined the STAR cohort, we include school-by-

17:579:48567:20:20:71:539:97:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:indicators for missing data).  To examine the robustness of our results, we report the coe¢ cient
17:580:48664:20:0:71:539:77:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:both with and without this vector of controls. The inclusion of these controls does not signiÖcantly

18:582:48864:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:speciÖcations, we cluster standard errors by school. Although treatment occurred at the classroom
18:583:48961:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:level, clustering by school provides a conservative estimate of standard errors that accounts for any
18:584:49062:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:cross-classroom correlations in errors within schools, including across students in di§erent entry
18:585:49160:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:grades.  These standard errors are in nearly all cases larger than those from clustering on only

18:587:49268:20:21:88:539:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We report estimates of equation (1) for various outcomes in Table V using the full sample of
18:588:49360:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:STAR students; we show in Online Appendix Table VIII that similar results are obtained for the
18:589:49454:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:subsample of students who entered in kindergarten.  As a reference, in column 1 of Table V, we
18:590:49548:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:estimate equation (1) with the entry grade test score as the outcome.  Consistent with Krueger
18:591:49642:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(1999), we Önd that students assigned to small classes score 4.8 percentile points higher on tests in
18:592:49743:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the year they enter a participating school. Note that the average student assigned to a small class
18:593:49842:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:spent 2.27 years in a small class, while those assigned to a large class spent 0.13 years in a small
18:594:49942:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:class.  On average, large classes had 22.6 students while small classes had 15.1 students.  Hence,
18:595:50040:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the impacts on adult outcomes below should be interpreted as e§ects of attending a class that is
18:596:50136:20:21:72:200:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:33% smaller for 2.14 years.
18:597:50163:21:20:88:540:383:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:College Attendance.We begin by analyzing the impacts of class size on college attendance.
18:598:50252:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Figure IIa plots the fraction of students who attend college in each year from 1999 to 2007 by class
18:599:50352:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:size.  In this and all subsequent Ögures, we adjust for school-by-entry-grade e§ects to isolate the
18:600:50451:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:random variation of interest.  To do so, we regress the outcome variable on school-by-entry-grade
18:601:50548:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:dummies and the small class indicator in each tax year.  We then construct the two series shown
18:602:50643:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the Ögure by setting the di§erence between the two lines equal to the regression coe¢ cient on
18:603:50740:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the small class indicator in the corresponding year and the weighted average of the lines equal to
18:604:50838:20:20:72:226:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the sample average in that year.
18:605:50870:20:21:88:539:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Figure IIa shows that students assigned to a small class are more likely to attend college,
18:606:50961:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:particularly before age 25.  As the cohort ages from 19 (in 1999) to 27 (in 2007), the attendance
18:607:51058:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rate of both treatment and control students declines, consistent with patterns in the broader U.S.
18:608:51156:20:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:population.  Because our measure of college attendance is based on tuition payments, it includes
18:609:51252:21:20:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:students who attend higher education institutions both part-time and full-time. Measures of college
18:610:51351:20:20:72:540:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:attendance around age 20 (two years after the expected date of high school graduation) are most
18:611:51446:20:16:72:540:99:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:likely to pick up full-time attendance to two-year and four-year colleges, while college attendance
18:612:51545:16:0:80:532:83:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:17Online Appendix Table VII compares standard errors when clustering at di§erent levels for key speciÖcations.
19:613:51657:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in later years may be more likely to reáect part-time enrollment. This could explain why the e§ect
19:614:51755:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of class size becomes much smaller after age 25.  We therefore analyze two measures of college
19:615:51849:20:20:72:505:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:attendance below: college attendance at age 20 and attendance at any point before age 27.
19:616:51938:20:21:88:539:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The regression estimates reported in Column 2 of Table V are consistent with the results in
19:617:52029:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Figure IIa.  Controlling for demographic characteristics, students assigned to a small class are 1.8
19:618:52129:20:20:72:539:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:percentage points (6:7%) more likely to attend college in 2000. This e§ect is marginally signiÖcant
19:619:52228:20:21:72:539:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:withp= 0:06. Column 3 shows that students in small classes are 1.6 percentage points more likely
19:620:52324:21:20:72:290:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to attend college at some point before age 27.
19:621:52370:20:20:88:539:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Next, we investigate how class size a§ects the quality of colleges that students attend. Using the
19:622:52468:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings-based college quality measure described above, we plot the distribution of college quality
19:623:52567:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:attended in 2000 by small and large class assignment in Figure IIb.  We compute residual college
19:624:52663:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:mean earnings from a regression on school-by-entry-grade e§ects and plot the distribution of the
19:625:52759:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:residuals within small and large classes, adding back the sample mean to facilitate interpretation
19:626:52857:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of units. To show where the excess density in the small class group lies, the densities are scaled to
19:627:52958:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:integrate to the total college attendance rates for small and large classes.  The excess density in
19:628:53057:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the small class group lies primarily among the lower quality colleges, suggesting that the marginal
19:629:53156:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:students who were induced to attend college because of reduced class size enrolled in relatively low
19:630:53256:20:20:72:147:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:quality colleges.
19:631:53273:20:21:88:539:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Column 4 of Table V shows that students assigned to a small class attend colleges whose students
19:632:53369:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:have mean earnings that are $109 higher. That is, based on the cross-sectional relationship between
19:633:53468:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings and attendance at each college, we predict that students in small classes will be earning
19:634:53566:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:approximately $109 more per year at age 28.  This earnings increase incorporates the extensive-
19:635:53661:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:margin of higher college attendance rates, because students who do not attend college are assigned
19:636:53759:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the mean earnings of individuals who do not attend college in our index.18Conditional on attending
19:637:53857:20:21:72:539:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:college, students in small classes attendlowerquality colleges on average because of the selection
19:638:53955:21:20:72:206:200:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:e§ect shown in Figure IIb.19
19:639:53983:20:20:88:539:180:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:Earnings.Figure IIc shows the analog of Figure IIa for wage earnings.  Earnings rise rapidly
19:640:54075:20:16:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:over time because many students are in college in the early years of the sample.  Individuals in
19:641:54171:16:15:80:539:144:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:18Alternative earnings imputation procedures for those who do not attend college yield similar results. For example,
19:642:54287:15:11:72:540:129:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:assigning these students the mean earnings of Tennessee residents or STAR participants who do not attend college
19:643:54399:11:7:72:179:118:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:generates larger estimates.
19:644:54426:7:15:80:539:111:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:19Because of the selection e§ect, we are unable to determine whether there was an intensive-margin improvement
19:645:54536:15:11:72:540:96:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:in quality of college attended.  Quantifying the e§ect of reduced class size on college quality for those who were
19:646:54650:11:0:72:471:85:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:already planning to attend college would require additional assumptions such as rank preservation.
20:647:54750:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:small classes have slightly higher earnings than those in large classes in most years.  Column 5 of
20:648:54849:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table V shows that without controls, students who were assigned to small classes are estimated
20:649:54943:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to earn $4 more per year on average between 2005 and 2007.  With controls for demographic
20:650:55032:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:characteristics, the point estimate of the earnings impact becomes -$124 (with a standard error of
20:651:55130:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:$336).  Though the point estimate is negative, the upper bound of the 95% conÖdence interval is
20:652:55225:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:an earnings gain of $535 (3.4%) gain per year.  If we were to predict the expected earnings gain
20:653:55321:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:from being assigned to a small class from the cross-sectional correlation between test scores and
20:654:55418:21:20:72:539:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings reported in column 4 of Table IV, we obtain an expected earnings e§ect of4:8percentiles
20:655:55514:20:20:71:540:546:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f2:-$90 = $432.  This prediction lies within the 95% conÖdence interval for the impact of class size
20:656:55611:20:21:71:539:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on earnings.  In Online Appendix Table IX, we consider several alternative measures of earnings,
20:657:55707:21:20:71:539:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:such as total household income and an indicator for positive wage earnings.  We Önd qualitatively
20:658:55804:20:20:71:539:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:similar impacts ñpoint estimates close to zero with conÖdence intervals that include the predicted
20:659:55902:20:21:71:539:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:value from cross-sectional estimates ñfor all of these measures.  We conclude that the class size
20:660:55999:21:20:71:539:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:intervention, which raises test scores by 4.8 percentiles, is unfortunately not powerful enough to
20:661:56097:20:20:71:539:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:detect earnings increases of a plausible magnitude as of age 27.  Because class size has impacts
20:662:56193:20:21:71:539:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on college attendance, earnings e§ects might emerge in subsequent years, especially since college
20:663:56290:21:20:71:424:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:graduates have much steeper earnings proÖles than non college graduates.
20:664:56362:20:20:88:539:363:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:Other Outcomes.Column 6 of Table V shows that students assigned to small classes score 4.6
20:665:56452:20:21:71:539:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:percent of a standard deviation higher in the summary outcome index deÖned in Section III, an

20:668:56735:20:21:71:539:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In Online Appendix Table X, we analyze the impacts of class size on each of the Öve outcomes
20:669:56827:21:20:71:539:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:separately.   We Önd particularly large and signiÖcant impacts on the probability of having a
20:670:56920:20:20:71:539:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:401(k), which can be thought of as a proxy for having a good job.  This result is consistent with
20:671:57017:20:21:71:539:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the view that students in small classes may have higher permanent income that could emerge in
20:672:57110:21:20:71:539:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:wage earnings measures later in their lifecycles.   We also Önd positive e§ects on all the other
20:673:57206:20:20:71:498:180:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:components of the summary index, though these e§ects are not individually signiÖcant.20
20:674:57293:20:21:88:539:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In Online Appendix Table XI, we document the heterogeneity of class size impacts across
20:675:57380:21:15:71:539:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:subgroups.  We replicate the analysis of class size impacts in Table V for six groups: black and
20:676:57476:15:15:80:539:124:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:20In Online Appendix Table X, we also analyze an alternative summary index that weights each of the Öve compo-
20:677:57586:15:11:71:539:109:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:nents by their impacts on wage earnings. We construct this index by regressing wage earnings on the Öve components
20:678:57700:11:11:71:539:98:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:in the cross-section and predicting wage earnings for each individual.  We Önd signiÖcant impacts of class size on
20:679:57814:11:11:71:539:87:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:this predicted-earnings summary index, conÖrming that our results are robust to the way in which the components
20:680:57925:11:0:71:216:76:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:of the summary index are weighted.
21:681:57961:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:white students, males and females, and lower- and higher-income students (based on free lunch
21:682:58054:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:status).  The point estimates of the impacts of class size are positive for most of the groups and
21:683:58152:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:outcomes.  The impacts on adult outcomes are somewhat larger for groups that exhibit larger
21:684:58243:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:test scores increases.  For instance, black students assigned to small classes score 6.9 percentile
21:685:58342:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:points higher on their entry-grade test, are 5.3 percentage points more likely to ever attend college,
21:686:58444:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and have an earnings increase of $250 (with a standard error of $540).  There is some evidence
21:687:58538:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that reductions in class size may have more positive e§ects for men than women and for higher
21:688:58631:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:income than lower income (free-lunch eligible) students.  Overall, however, the STAR experiment
21:689:58726:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is not powerful enough to detect heterogeneity in the impacts of class size on adult outcomes with
21:690:58824:20:30:72:117:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:precision.

21:698:59327:21:20:71:539:325:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f2:y.  Note that we control for class size in these regressions, so the variation identifying teacher and
21:699:59429:20:20:71:286:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:peer e§ects is orthogonal to that used above.
21:700:59474:20:21:88:540:285:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:Teachers.We begin by examining the impacts of teacher experience on scores and earnings.
21:701:59562:21:20:71:539:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Figure IIIa plots KG scores vs. the numbers of years of experience that the studentís KG teacher
21:702:59658:20:20:71:539:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:had at the time she taught his class.  We exclude students who entered the experiment in grades
21:703:59753:20:21:71:539:224:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1 to 3 in these graphs for reasons we discuss below.  We adjust for school e§ects by regressing the
21:704:59852:21:20:71:539:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:outcome and dependent variables on these Öxed e§ects and computing residuals.  The Ögure is a
21:705:59945:20:20:71:539:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:scatter plot of the residuals, with the sample means added back in to facilitate interpretation of
21:706:60043:20:21:71:539:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the axes.  Figure IIIa shows that students randomly assigned to more experienced KG teachers
21:707:60135:21:20:71:539:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:have higher test scores.  The e§ect of experience on KG scores is roughly linear in the STAR
21:708:60227:20:20:71:539:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:experimental data, in contrast with other studies which Önd that the returns to experience drop
21:709:60322:20:21:71:224:102:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sharply after the Örst few years.
21:710:60355:21:0:88:539:81:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Figure IIIb replicates IIIa for the earnings outcome. It shows that students who were randomly
22:711:60451:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:assigned to more experienced KG teachers have higher earnings at age 27.  As with scores, the
22:712:60544:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:impact of experience on earnings in these data appear roughly linear. Figure IIIc characterizes the
22:713:60643:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:time path of the earnings impact. We divide teachers in two groups ñthose with experience above
22:714:60738:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and below 10 years (since mean years of experience is 9.3 years).  We then plot mean earnings
22:715:60831:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for the students in the low- and high-experience groups by year, adjusting for school Öxed e§ects
22:716:60928:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:as in Figure IIIb.  From 2000 to 2004 (when students are aged 20 to 24), there is little di§erence
22:717:61026:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in earnings between the two curves.  A gap opens starting in 2005; by 2007, students who had
22:718:61118:21:20:72:440:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:high-experience teachers in kindergarten are earning $1,104 more on average.
22:719:61194:20:20:88:539:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Columns 1-2 of Table VI quantify the impacts of teacher experience on scores and earnings,
22:720:61284:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:conditioning on the standard vector of student and parent demographic characteristics as well as
22:721:61380:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:whether the teacher has a masterís degree or higher and the small class indicator. Column 1 shows
22:722:61477:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that students assigned to a teacher with more than 10 years of experience score 3.2 percentile
22:723:61571:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:points higher on KG tests. Column 2 shows that these same students earn $1,093 more on average
22:724:61665:21:20:72:247:444:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:between ages 25 and 27 (p <0:05).21
22:725:61700:20:20:88:539:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Columns 3-4 show that teacher experience has a much reduced e§ect for children entering the
22:726:61791:20:21:71:539:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:experiment in grades 1 to 3 on both test scores and earnings.  The e§ect of teacher experience
22:727:61885:21:20:71:539:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on test scores is no longer statistically signiÖcant in grades 1-3.   Consistent with this result,
22:728:61983:20:20:71:539:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:teacher experience in grades 1-3 also does not have a statistically signiÖcant e§ect on wage earnings.
22:729:62085:20:21:71:539:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Unfortunately, the STAR dataset includes very few teacher characteristics, so we are unable to
22:730:62179:21:20:71:487:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:provide deÖnitive evidence on why the e§ect of teacher experience varies across grades.
22:731:62266:20:20:88:539:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The impact of kindergarten teacher experience on earnings must be interpreted very carefully.
22:732:62359:20:21:71:539:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our results show that placing a child in a kindergarten class taught by a more experienced teacher
22:733:62457:21:20:71:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:yields improved outcomes.  This Önding doesnotimply that increasing a given teacherís experi-
22:734:62550:20:20:71:539:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ence will improve student outcomes.  The reason is that while teachers were randomly assigned to
22:735:62646:20:21:71:539:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:classrooms, experience was not randomly assigned to teachers.  The di§erence in earnings of stu-
22:736:62742:21:20:71:539:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:dents with experienced teachers could be due to the intrinsic characteristics of experienced teachers
22:737:62843:20:20:71:539:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rather than experience of teachers per se. For instance, teachers with more experience have selected
22:738:62943:20:21:71:539:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to stay in the profession and may be more passionate or more skilled at teaching.  Alternatively,
22:739:63040:21:16:71:539:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:teachers from older cohorts may have been more skilled (Corcoran, Evans, and Schwab 2004, Hoxby
22:740:63135:16:15:80:539:123:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:21In Online Appendix Table XII, we replicate columns 1 and 2 for small and large classes separately to evaluate
22:741:63246:15:11:71:539:108:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:whether teacher experience is more important in managing classrooms with many students.  We Önd some evidence
22:742:63355:11:11:71:539:97:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:that teacher experience has a larger impact on earnings in large classes, but the di§erence in impacts is not statistically
22:743:63478:11:0:71:114:86:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:signiÖcant.
23:744:63491:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and Leigh 2004, Bacolod 2007).  These factors may explain the di§erence between the e§ect of
23:745:63583:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:teacher experience in Kindergarten and later grades.  For instance, the selection of teachers may
23:746:63680:20:20:72:420:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:vary across grades or cohort e§ects may di§er for Kindergarten teachers.
23:747:63752:20:21:88:539:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The linear relationship between kindergarten teacher experience and scores in the STAR data
23:748:63843:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:stands in contrast to earlier studies that track teachers over time in a panel and Önd that teacher
23:749:63942:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:performance improves with the Örst few years of experience and then plateaus.   This further
23:750:64034:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:suggests that other factors correlated with experience may drive the observed impacts on scores
23:751:64129:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and earnings.  We therefore conclude that early childhood teaching has a causal impact on long
23:752:64223:20:20:72:519:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:term outcomes but we cannot isolate the characteristics of teachers responsible for this e§ect.
23:753:64318:20:21:88:539:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The few other observable teacher characteristics in the STAR data (degrees, race, and progress
23:754:64412:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on a career ladder) have no signiÖcant impact on scores or earnings.  For instance, columns 1-4 of
23:755:64510:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table VI show that the e§ect of teachersídegrees on scores and earnings is statistically insigniÖcant.
23:756:64612:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The Önding that experience is the only observable measure that predicts teacher quality matches
23:757:64707:21:20:72:442:444:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:earlier studies of teacher e§ects (Hanushek 2010, Rocko§ and Staiger 2010).22
23:758:64784:20:20:88:539:424:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:Peers.Better classmates could create an environment more conducive to learning, leading to
23:759:64874:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:improvements in adult outcomes. To test for such peer e§ects, we follow the standard approach in
23:760:64970:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the recent literature by using linear-in-means regressions speciÖcations.  We include students who
23:761:65068:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:enter in all grades and measure peer characteristics in their Örst, randomly assigned classroom, and
23:762:65168:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:condition on school-by-entry-grade e§ects. We proxy for peer abilities (z) in equation (2) with the
23:763:65267:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:following exogenous peer characteristics: fraction black, fraction female, fraction eligible for free or
23:764:65371:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reduced-price lunch (a proxy for low income), and mean age. Replicating previous studies, we show
23:765:65468:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in column 5 of Table VI that the fraction of female and low-income peers signiÖcantly predict test
23:766:65566:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:scores.  Column 6 replicates column 5 with earnings as the dependent variable.  The estimates on
23:767:65662:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:all four peer characteristics are very imprecise. For instance, the estimated e§ect of increasing the
23:768:65763:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:fraction of low-income peers by 10 percentage points is an earnings loss of $28, but with a standard
23:769:65863:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:error of $173. In an attempt to obtain more power, we construct a single index of peer abilities by
23:770:65962:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Örst regressing scores on the full set of parent and student demographic characteristics described
23:771:66060:20:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:above and then predicting peersíscores using this regression.  However, as column 7 shows, even
23:772:66155:21:20:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the predicted peer score measure does not yield a precise estimate of peer e§ects on earnings; the

24:778:66659:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on earnings precisely because the experimental design randomized students across classrooms. As a
24:779:66756:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:result, it does not generate signiÖcant variation in mean peer abilities across classes. The standard

24:781:66955:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:than two percentile points.  This small degree of variation in peer abilities is adequate to identify

24:785:67294:31:21:72:540:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Many unobserved aspects of teachers and peers could impact student achievement and adult out-
24:786:67387:21:20:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:comes.  For instance, some teachers may generate greater enthusiasm among students or some
24:787:67477:20:20:72:540:460:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:peers might be particularly disruptive.  To test whether such unobservable aspects of class quality

25:848:71134:20:16:72:540:135:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:analyze unobservable attributes of classrooms, we use two techniques: an analysis of variance to
25:849:71230:16:15:80:539:119:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:24As an extreme example, teachers who help students raise test scores by cheating may have zero impact on
25:850:71335:15:11:72:539:104:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:earnings.  The\festimated below applies to the set of classroom characteristics that a§ected test scores in the STAR
25:851:71451:11:7:72:119:93:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:experiment.
25:852:71462:7:14:80:539:86:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:25Suppose teaching to the test a§ects only test scores while teaching discipline a§ects only earnings. If the decisions
25:853:71581:14:0:72:501:72:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:of teachers to teach to the test and teach discipline are correlated, then we would still obtain\f >0in (6).

26:858:72043:21:20:72:539:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:an ANOVA.  Intuitively, the ANOVA tests whether the outcomeyvaries across classes by more
26:859:72132:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:than what would be predicted by random variation in students across classrooms. We measure the
26:860:72226:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:magnitude of the class e§ects on earnings using a random class e§ects speciÖcation for equation
26:861:72321:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(6) to estimate the standard deviation of class e§ects under the assumption that they are normally
26:862:72419:20:20:72:127:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:distributed.
26:863:72431:20:21:88:539:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Although the ANOVA is useful for estimating the magnitude of class e§ects on earnings, it has
26:864:72524:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:two limitations.  First, it does not tell us whether class e§ects on scores are correlated with class
26:865:72625:20:20:72:539:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:e§ects on earnings (i.e., whether\f >0).  Hence, it does not answer a key question: do classroom
26:866:72721:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:environments that raise test scores also improve adult outcomes?  This is an important question
26:867:72816:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:because the impacts of most educational policies can be measured only by test scores in the short
26:868:72913:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:run.  Second, in the STAR data, roughly half the students enter in grades 1-3 and are randomly
26:869:73007:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:assigned to classrooms at that point.  Because only a small number of students enter each school
26:870:73103:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in each of these later grades, we do not have the power to detect class e§ects in later grades and
26:871:73201:20:20:72:336:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:therefore do not include these students in the ANOVA.

30:1015:81820:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:deviations). Note that this measure represents the impact of improving class quality by one SD of

30:1017:82010:20:20:88:539:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Column 2 of Table VII replicates the analysis in column 1 with 8th grade test scores as the
30:1018:82101:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:outcome.  We Önd no evidence that kindergarten classroom assignment has any lasting impact

30:1021:82379:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:suggests that KG class e§ects fade out by grade 8, a Önding that we revisit and explore in detail
30:1022:82476:21:20:72:138:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in Section VI.
30:1023:82490:20:20:88:539:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Columns 3-6 of Table VII implement the ANOVA for earnings (averaged over ages 25-27).
30:1024:82575:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Column 3 implements the analysis without any controls besides school Öxed e§ects.  Column 4
30:1025:82666:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:introduces the full vector of parental and student demographic characteristics. Both speciÖcations
30:1026:82764:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:show statistically signiÖcant class e§ects on earnings (p <0:05). Recall that the same speciÖcation
30:1027:82863:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:revealed no signiÖcant di§erences inpredictedearnings (based on pre-determined variables) across

30:1029:83055:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by classroom is the consequence of treatments or common shocks experienced by students after
30:1030:83147:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:random assignment to a KG classroom. The standard deviation of KG class e§ects on earnings in
30:1031:83240:21:20:72:539:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:column 4 (with controls) is-c= $1;520.  Assigning students to a classroom that is one standard
30:1032:83334:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:deviation better than average in kindergarten generates an increase in earnings at ages 25-27 of
30:1033:83430:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:$1,520 (9:6%) per year for each student. While the mean impact of assignment to a better classroom
30:1034:83528:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is large, kindergarten class assignment explains a small share of the variance in earnings. The intra-
30:1035:83630:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:class correlation coe¢ cient in earnings implied by the estimate in Column 4 of Table VII is only

30:1037:83751:17:15:80:539:143:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:30The clustering of earnings detected by the ANOVA may appear to contradict that fact that clustering standard
30:1038:83861:15:10:71:539:128:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:errors by classroom or school has little impact on the standard errors in the regression speciÖcation in, for example,
30:1039:83979:10:11:71:539:118:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:equation (1) (see Online Appendix Table VII).  The intra-class correlation in earnings of 0.01 implies a Moulton
30:1040:84091:11:11:71:539:107:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:correction factor of 1.09 for clustering at the classroom level with a mean class size of 20.3 students (Angrist and
30:1041:84207:11:11:71:539:96:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:Pischke 2009, equation 8.2.5). The Moulton adjustment of 9% assumes that errors are equi-correlated across students
30:1042:84322:11:11:71:539:85:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:within a class.   Following standard practice, we report clustered standard errors that do not impose this equi-
30:1043:84434:11:0:71:539:74:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:correlation assumption.  Clustered standard errors can be smaller than un-clustered estimates when the intra-class
31:1044:84550:0:21:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Column 5 of Table VII restricts the sample to students assigned to large classes, to test for class
31:1045:84649:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:e§ects purely within large classrooms.  This speciÖcation is of interest for two reasons.  First, it
31:1046:84749:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:isolates variation in class quality orthogonal to class size.  Second, students in large classes were
31:1047:84850:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:randomly reassigned to classrooms in Örst grade. Hence, column 5 speciÖcally identiÖes clustering
31:1048:84947:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by kindergarten classrooms rather than a string of teachers and peers experienced over several years
31:1049:85047:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by a group of children who all started in the same KG class.  Class quality continues to have a
31:1050:85142:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:signiÖcant impact on earnings within large classes, showing that components of kindergarten class
31:1051:85239:21:20:72:262:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:quality beyond size matter for earnings.
31:1052:85279:20:20:88:539:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Column 6 expands upon this approach by controlling for all observable classroom characteristics:
31:1053:85375:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:indicators for small class, teacher experience above 10 years, teacher race, teacher with degree higher

31:1056:85666:20:21:72:490:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:class e§ects are driven by features of the classroom that we cannot observe in our data.
31:1057:85754:21:20:88:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:TheFtests in Table VII rely on parametric assumptions to test the null of no class e§ects.
31:1058:85844:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:As a robustness check, we run permutation tests in which we randomly permute students between
31:1059:85937:20:21:72:539:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:classes within each school. For each random permutation, we calculate theFstatistic on the class
31:1060:86033:21:20:71:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:dummies.  Using the empirical distribution ofFstatistics from 1,000 within-school permutations
31:1061:86127:20:20:71:539:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of students, we calculate a non-parametricpvalue based on where the trueFstatistic (from row
31:1062:86219:20:21:71:539:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1) falls in the empirical distribution. Reassuringly, these non-parametricpvalues are quite similar
31:1063:86318:21:29:71:493:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to those produced from the parametricFtest, as shown in the second row of Table VII.

32:1077:87460:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:errors at the school level to adjust for the fact that outcomes are correlated across students within
32:1078:87561:20:21:72:260:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:classrooms and possibly within schools.
32:1079:87600:21:20:88:539:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We begin by characterizing the impact of class quality on test scores.  Figure IVa plots each

32:1086:88278:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:quality is estimated to raise own test scores by 0.68 percentiles, conÖrming that test scores are
32:1087:88375:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:highly correlated across students within a classroom.  Figure IVb replicates Figure IVa, changing
32:1088:88472:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the dependent variable to 8th grade test score.  Consistent with the earlier ANOVA results, the
32:1089:88567:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:impact fades out by grade 8.  A one percentile increase in the quality of the studentís entry-year

32:1091:88764:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:evaluate the e§ects of class quality on adult wage earnings.  Students assigned to a one percentile

32:1093:88945:20:21:88:539:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We verify that our method of measuring class quality does not generate a mechanical correlation
32:1094:89040:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:between peers scores and own outcomes using permutation tests.  We randomly permute students
32:1095:89132:20:20:72:539:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:across classrooms within schools and replicate equation (12).  We use thetstatistics on\ffrom

32:1097:89319:21:20:72:539:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:class e§ects.  We Önd that fewer than 0.001% of thetstatistics from the random permutations
32:1098:89410:20:20:72:539:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are larger than the actualtstatistic on kindergarten test score in Figure IVa of 22.7.  For the
32:1099:89505:20:21:72:539:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings outcome, fewer than 0.1% of thetstatistics from the random permutations are larger
32:1100:89596:21:20:72:539:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f4:than the actualtstatistic of 3.55.  These non-parametric permutation tests conÖrm that thep
32:1101:89687:20:20:72:416:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:values obtained using parametric t-tests are accurate in our application.
32:1102:89760:20:21:88:539:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:As noted above, part of the relationship between earnings and peersítest scores may be driven
32:1103:89853:21:20:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by reáection bias: high ability students raise their peersíscores and themselves have high earnings.
32:1104:89953:20:20:72:540:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This could generate a correlation between peer scores and own earnings even if class quality has no
32:1105:90052:20:20:72:540:99:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:causal impact on earnings.  However, the fact that end-of-kindergarten peer scores are not highly
32:1106:90149:20:0:72:540:79:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:correlated with 8th grade test scores (Figure IVb) places a tight upper bound on the degree of this
33:1107:90250:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:bias. In the presence of reáection bias, a high ability student (who raises her classroom peersíscores

33:1109:90452:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:between Örst-classroom peer scores and own 8th grade scores.  Therefore, if Örst-classroom peer
33:1110:90547:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:scores have zero correlation with 8th grade scores, there cannot be any reáection bias.  In Online
33:1111:90645:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Appendix B, we formalize this argument by deriving a bound on the degree of reáection bias in a
33:1112:90740:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:linear-in-means model as a function of the empirical estimates in Table VIII and the cross-sectional
33:1113:90840:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:correlations between test scores and earnings.  If class quality has no causal impact on earnings
33:1114:90937:21:20:72:539:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(\f= 0), the upper bound on the regression coe¢ cient of earnings on class quality is $9, less than
33:1115:91036:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:20% of our empirical estimate of $56.6. Although this quantitative bound relies on the parametric
33:1116:91133:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:assumptions of a linear-in-means model, it captures a more general intuition: the rapid fade out
33:1117:91229:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of class quality e§ects on test scores rules out signiÖcant reáection bias in impacts of peer scores
33:1118:91329:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on later adult outcomes.   Recall that the class quality estimates also su§er from a downward
33:1119:91422:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:attenuation bias of 23%, the same magnitude as the upper bound on the reáection bias.   We
33:1120:91512:21:20:72:479:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:therefore proceed by using end-of-year peer scores as a simple proxy for class quality.
33:1121:91599:20:20:88:539:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Figure Va characterizes the time path of the impact of class quality on earnings, dividing
33:1122:91689:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:classrooms in two groups ñ those with class quality above and below the median.   The time
33:1123:91779:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:pattern of the total class quality impact is similar to the impact of teacher experience shown in
33:1124:91876:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Figure IIIc. Prior to 2004, there is little di§erence in earnings between the two curves, but the gap
33:1125:91977:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:noticeably widens beginning in 2003.  By 2007, students who were assigned to classes of above-
33:1126:92071:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:median quality are earning $875 (5.5%) more on average.  Figure Vb shows the time path of the
33:1127:92164:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:impacts on college attendance.  Students in higher quality classes are more likely to be attending
33:1128:92262:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:college in their early 20ís, consistent with their higher earnings and steeper earnings trajectories in
33:1129:92365:21:20:72:125:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:later years.
33:1130:92377:20:20:88:539:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table VIII quantiÖes the impacts of class quality on wage earnings using regressions with the
33:1131:92470:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:standard vector of parent and student controls used above.  Column 1 shows that conditional
33:1132:92561:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on the demographic characteristics, a one percentile point increase in class quality increases a
33:1133:92657:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:studentís own test score by 0.66 percentile points.  This e§ect is very precisely estimated, with a
33:1134:92756:20:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f2:tstatistic of 27.6, because the intra-class correlation of test scores among students in very large.
33:1135:92856:21:20:72:539:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Column 2 of Table VIII shows the e§ect of class quality on earnings.32Conditional on demographic

33:1138:93159:15:0:71:404:88:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:positive impacts on all Öve alternative measures of wage earnings described above.

34:1140:93340:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:this e§ect, note that a one standard deviation increase in class quality as measured by peer scores
34:1141:93439:20:20:72:334:668:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:leads to a $455 (2.9%) increase in earnings at age 27.33
34:1142:93495:20:21:88:539:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The impact of class quality on earnings is estimated much more precisely than the impacts of
34:1143:93587:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:observable characteristics on earnings because class quality varies substantially across classrooms.
34:1144:93687:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Recall from Table V that students assigned to small classes scored 4.8 percentile points higher on
34:1145:93785:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:end-of-year tests.  If class quality varied only from -2.4 to 2.4, we would be unable to determine
34:1146:93883:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:whether the relationship between class quality and earnings is signiÖcant, as can be seen in Figure
34:1147:93982:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:IVc. By pooling all observable and unobservable sources of variation across classrooms, we obtain
34:1148:94079:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:more precise (though less policy relevant) estimates of the impact of classroom environments on
34:1149:94174:21:20:72:148:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:adult outcomes.
34:1150:94189:20:20:88:539:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Column 3 of Table VIII isolates the variation in class quality that is orthogonal to observable
34:1151:94284:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:classroom characteristics by controlling for class size, teacher characteristics, and peer characteris-
34:1152:94387:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tics as in column 6 of Table VII. Class quality continues to have a signiÖcant impact on earnings
34:1153:94484:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:conditional on these observables, conÖrming that components of class quality orthogonal to observ-
34:1154:94582:20:21:72:194:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ables matter for earnings.

34:1156:94699:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:entrants and shows that a one percentile increase in KG class quality raises earnings by $53.4.
34:1157:94794:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Column 5 includes only those who entered STAR after kindergarten. This point estimate is similar
34:1158:94890:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to that in column 4, showing that class quality in grades 1-3 matters as much for earnings as class
34:1159:94989:20:20:72:185:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:quality in kindergarten.
34:1160:95013:20:21:88:539:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Columns 6-9 show the impacts of class quality on other adult outcomes.   These columns
34:1161:95099:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:replicate the baseline speciÖcation for the full sample in column 2.  Columns 6 and 7 show that a
34:1162:95196:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1 percentile improvement in class quality raises college attendance rates by 0.1 percentage points,
34:1163:95295:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:both at age 20 and before age 27 (p <0:05).  Column 8 shows that a one percentile increase in
34:1164:95388:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:class quality generates an $9.3 increase in the college quality index (p <0:05).  Finally, column 9
34:1165:95487:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:shows that a one percentile point improvement in class quality leads to an improvement of0:25%
34:1166:95581:20:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of a standard deviation in our outcome summary index (p <0:05).  Online Appendix Table X
34:1167:95669:21:15:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reports the impacts of class quality on each of the Öve outcomes separately and shows that the
34:1168:95763:15:15:80:539:124:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:33Part of the impact of being randomly assigned to a higher quality class in gradewmay come from being placed
34:1169:95872:15:11:72:540:109:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:in higher quality classes in subsequent grades.  A 1 percentile increase in KG class quality (peer scores) is associated
34:1170:95992:11:11:72:540:98:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:with a 0.15 percentile increase in class quality (peer scores) in grade 1. The analogous e§ect of grade 1 class quality
34:1171:96111:11:0:72:244:87:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:on grade 2 class quality is 0.37 percentiles.
35:1172:96158:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:point estimates of the impacts are positive for all of the outcomes.  Online Appendix Table XI
35:1173:96252:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:documents the heterogeneity of class quality impacts across subgroups. The point estimates of the
35:1174:96349:20:20:72:400:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:impacts of class quality are positive for all the groups and outcomes.
35:1175:96419:20:21:88:539:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Finally, we check the robustness of our results by implementing instrumental-variable methods
35:1176:96512:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of detecting covariance between class e§ects on scores and earnings. The e§ects of class quality on
35:1177:96611:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:test scores and earnings in columns 1 and 2 of Table VIII can be combined to produce a jackknife
35:1178:96707:20:21:72:539:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:IV estimate of the earnings gain associated with an increase in test scores:$50:61=0:662 = $76:48.
35:1179:96805:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:That is, class-level factors that raise test scores by one percentile point raise earnings by $76.48
35:1180:96905:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on average.  In Online Appendix Table XIII, we show that other IV estimators yield very similar
35:1181:97000:20:21:72:119:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:estimates.
35:1182:97010:21:20:88:539:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:While class e§ects on scores and earnings are highly correlated, a substantial portion of class
35:1183:97105:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:e§ects on earnings is orthogonal to our measure of class quality. Using a random e§ects estimator
35:1184:97202:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:as in Column 4 of Table VII, we Önd that the standard deviation of class e§ects on earnings falls
35:1185:97299:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:from $1520 to $1372 after we control for our peer-score class quality measure-s-icnw.   Hence,
35:1186:97393:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:roughly1-(13721520)2-1=5of the variance of the class e§ect on earnings comes through class e§ects

35:1189:97558:31:20:72:540:338:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In this section, we explore why the impacts of class size and class quality in early childhood fade

35:1191:97751:20:21:72:540:298:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:benchmark to document fade-out, we use only kindergarten entrants throughout this section and

35:1193:97934:20:20:88:539:257:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We Örst document the fade-out e§ect using the class quality measure by estimating equation
35:1194:98024:20:21:72:540:237:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(12) with test scores in each grade as the dependent variable and with the standard vector of parent
35:1195:98124:21:20:72:540:216:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and student controls as well as school Öxed e§ects.  Figure VIa plots the estimated impacts on
35:1196:98218:20:20:72:540:196:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:test scores in grades K-8 of increasing KG class quality by one (within-school) standard deviation.
35:1197:98317:20:21:72:540:176:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A one (within school) SD increase in KG class quality increases end-of-kindergarten test scores by
35:1198:98415:21:20:72:540:155:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:6.27 percentiles, consistent with our Öndings above. In grade 1, students who were in a 1 SD better
35:1199:98514:20:20:72:540:135:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:KG class score approximately 1.50 percentile points higher on end-of-year tests, an e§ect that is
35:1200:98611:20:21:72:539:115:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:signiÖcant withp <0:001. The e§ect gradually fades over time, and by grade 4 students who were
35:1201:98705:21:16:71:389:94:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:in a better KG class no longer score signiÖcantly higher on tests.34
35:1202:98773:16:0:80:539:78:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:34This fade-out e§ect is consistent with the rapid fade-out of teacher e§ects documented by Jacob, Lefgren, and
36:1203:98886:0:21:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:If a one percentile increase in 8th grade test scores is more valuable than a one percentile
36:1204:98978:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:increase in KG test scores, then the evidence in Figure VIa would not necessarily imply that the
36:1205:99074:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:e§ects of early childhood education fade out. To evaluate this possibility, we convert the test score
36:1206:99175:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:impacts to predicted earnings gains.  We run separate OLS regressions of earnings on the test
36:1207:99268:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:scores for each grade from K-8 to estimate the cross-sectional relationship between each gradeís
36:1208:99364:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:test score and earnings (see Online Appendix Table V, Column 1 for these coe¢ cients).  We then
36:1209:99459:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:multiply the class quality e§ect on scores shown in Figure VIa by the corresponding coe¢ cient on
36:1210:99556:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:scores from the OLS earnings regression.  Figure VIb plots the earnings impacts predicted by the
36:1211:99652:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:test score gains in each grade that arise from attending a better KG class.  The pattern in Figure
36:1212:99750:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:VIb looks very similar to that in Figure VIa, showing that there is indeed substantial fade-out of

36:1214:99945:20:20:72:487:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:per year gain in earnings from a better KG class based on observed test score impacts.
36:1215:100031:20:21:88:539:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The Önal point in Figure VIb shows the actual observed earnings impact of a one SD improve-
36:1216:100122:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ment in KG class quality.  The actual impact of $483 is similar to what one would have predicted
36:1217:100218:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:based on the improvement in KG test scores ($588).  The impacts of early childhood education

36:1219:100383:21:20:88:539:383:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:Non-Cognitive Skills.One potential explanation for fade-out and re-emergence is the acquisition
36:1220:100478:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of non-cognitive skills (e.g.  Heckman 2000, Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua 2006, Lindqvist and
36:1221:100570:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Vestman 2011). We evaluate whether non-cognitive skills could explain our Öndings using data on
36:1222:100665:21:20:72:472:322:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:non-cognitive measures collected for a subset of STAR students in grades 4 and 8.35
36:1223:100748:20:20:88:539:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Finn et al. (2007) and Dee and West (2008) describe the non-cognitive measures in the STAR
36:1224:100838:20:21:71:539:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:data in detail; we provide a brief summary here. In grade 4, teachers in the STAR schools were asked
36:1225:100938:21:20:71:539:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to evaluate a random subset of their students on a scale of 1-5 on several behavioral measures, such
36:1226:101038:20:20:71:539:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:as whether the student ìannoys others.î These responses were consolidated into four standardized
36:1227:101134:20:21:71:539:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:scales measuring each studentís e§ort, initiative, nonparticipatory behavior, and how the student
36:1228:101231:21:20:71:539:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is seen to ìvalueî the class.  In grade 8, math and English teachers were asked to rate a subset
36:1229:101327:20:20:71:539:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of their students on a similar set of questions, which were again consolidated into the same four
36:1230:101424:20:21:71:539:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:standardized scales.  To obtain a measure analogous to our percentile measure of test scores, we
36:1231:101520:21:19:71:539:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:construct percentile measures for these four scales and compute the average percentile score for
36:1232:101616:19:7:71:274:120:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:Sims (2008), Kane and Staiger (2008), and others.
36:1233:101665:7:15:80:539:113:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:35Previous studies have used the STAR data to investigate whether class size a§ects non-cognitive skills (Finn et al.
36:1234:101782:15:11:71:539:98:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:1989, Dee and West 2008). They Önd mixed evidence on the impact of class size on non-cognitive skills: statistically
36:1235:101898:11:11:71:539:87:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:signiÖcant impacts are detected in grade 4, but not in grade 8.  Here, we analyze the impacts of our broader class
36:1236:102012:11:0:71:137:76:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:quality measure.
37:1237:102030:0:21:72:531:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:each student.  For 8th grade, we then take the average of the math and English teacher ratings.
37:1238:102125:21:20:88:539:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Among the 6,025 students who entered Project STAR in KG and whom we match in the IRS
37:1239:102209:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:data, we have data on non-cognitive skills for 1,671 (28%) in grade 4 and 1,780 (30%) in grade
37:1240:102303:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:8.   The availability of non-cognitive measures for only a subset of the students who could be
37:1241:102397:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tracked until grade 8 naturally raises concerns about selective attrition.  Dee and West (2008)
37:1242:102492:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:investigate this issue in detail, and we replicate their Öndings with our expanded set of parental
37:1243:102590:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:characteristics.  In grade 8, we Önd no signiÖcant di§erences in the probability of having non-
37:1244:102685:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:cognitive data by KG classrooms or class types (small vs. large), and conÖrm that in this sample
37:1245:102781:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the observable background characteristics are balanced across classrooms and class types.   In
37:1246:102875:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:grade 4, non-cognitive data are signiÖcantly more likely to be available for students assigned to
37:1247:102972:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:small classes, but among the sample with non-cognitive data there are no signiÖcant di§erences in
37:1248:103069:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:background characteristics across classrooms or class types.  Hence, the sample for whom we have
37:1249:103165:20:21:72:538:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:non-cognitive data appear to be balanced across classrooms at least on observable characteristics.
37:1250:103263:21:20:88:539:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We begin by estimating the cross-sectional correlation between non-cognitive outcomes and
37:1251:103352:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings. Column 1 of Table IX shows that a 1 percentile improvement in non-cognitive measures in
37:1252:103449:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:grade 4 is associated with a $106 gain in earnings conditional on the standard vector of demographic
37:1253:103549:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:characteristics used above and school-by-entry-grade Öxed e§ects. Column 2 shows that controlling
37:1254:103646:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for math and reading test scores in grade 4 reduces the predictive power of non-cognitive scores
37:1255:103742:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:only slightly, to $88 per percentile.  In contrast, column 3 shows that non-cognitive skills in grade
37:1256:103843:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:4 are relatively weak predictors of 8th grade test scores when compared with math and reading
37:1257:103936:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:scores in 4th grade.  Because non-cognitive skills appear to be correlated with earnings through
37:1258:104032:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:channels that are not picked up by subsequent standardized tests, they could explain fade-out and
37:1259:104129:21:20:72:137:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:re-emergence.
37:1260:104142:20:20:88:539:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:To further evaluate this mechanism, we investigate the e§ects of KG class quality on non-
37:1261:104231:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:cognitive skills in grade 4 and 8.  As a reference, column 4 shows that a 1 percentile improvement
37:1262:104329:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in KG class quality increases a studentís test scores in grade 4 by a statistically insigniÖcant 0.05
37:1263:104430:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:percentiles. In contrast, column 5 shows that the same improvement in KG class quality generates
37:1264:104526:20:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a statistically signiÖcant increase of 0.15 percentiles in the index of non-cognitive measures in grade
37:1265:104629:21:20:72:539:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:4. Columns 6 and 7 replicate columns 4 and 5 for grade 8.36Again, KG class quality does not have
37:1266:104725:20:16:72:540:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a signiÖcant impact on 8th grade test scores but has a signiÖcant impact on non-cognitive measures.
37:1267:104824:16:15:80:539:103:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:36We use all KG entrants for whom test scores are available in columns 4 and 6 to increase precision.  The point
37:1268:104936:15:0:72:540:88:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:estimates on test score impacts are similar for the subsample of students for whom non-cognitive data are available.
38:1269:105054:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Finally, columns 8 and 9 show that the experience of the studentís teacher in kindergarten ñwhich
38:1270:105151:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we showed above also impacts earnings ñhas a small and statistically insigniÖcant impact on test
38:1271:105247:20:20:72:514:668:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:scores but a substantially larger impact on non-cognitive measures in 8th grade (p= 0:07).37
38:1272:105339:20:21:88:539:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We can translate the impacts on non-cognitive skills into predicted impacts on earnings fol-
38:1273:105431:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:lowing the method in Figure VIb.  We regress earnings on the non-cognitive measure in grade 4,
38:1274:105525:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:conditioning on demographic characteristics, and obtain an OLS coe¢ cient of $101 per percentile.
38:1275:105622:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Multiplying this OLS coe¢ cient by the estimated impact of class quality on non-cognitive skills
38:1276:105718:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in grade 4, we predict that a 1 SD improvement in KG class quality will increase earnings by
38:1277:105810:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:$139.  The same exercise for 4th grade math+reading test scores yields a predicted earnings gain
38:1278:105906:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of $40.  These results suggest that improvements in non-cognitive skills explain a larger share
38:1279:106001:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of actual earnings gains than improvements in cognitive performance, consistent with Heckman
38:1280:106093:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:et al.ís (2010) Öndings for the Perry Preschool program.  In contrast, a one standard deviation
38:1281:106188:20:21:72:539:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:increase in class quality is predicted to raise 8th grade test scores by only0:47percentiles based on
38:1282:106289:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:its observed impacts on non-cognitive skills in grade 4 and the cross-sectional correlation between
38:1283:106388:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:grade 4 non-cognitive skills and grade 8 test scores.  This predicted impact is quite close to the
38:1284:106486:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:actual impact of class quality on 8th grade scores of0:57percentiles.  Hence, the impacts of class
38:1285:106584:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:quality on non-cognitive skills is consistent with both fade-out on scores and re-emergence on adult
38:1286:106684:20:20:72:119:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:outcomes.
38:1287:106693:20:21:88:539:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Intuitively, a better kindergarten classroom might simultaneously increase performance on end-
38:1288:106787:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of-year tests and improve untested non-cognitive skills.  For instance, a KG teacher who is able to
38:1289:106886:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:make her students memorize vocabulary words may instill social skills in the process of managing
38:1290:106982:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:her classroom successfully.  These non-cognitive skills may not be well measured by standardized
38:1291:107078:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tests, leading to very rapid fade-out immediately after KG. However, these skills could still have
38:1292:107176:20:20:72:206:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:returns in the labor market.
38:1293:107204:20:21:88:539:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Although non-cognitive skills provide one plausible explanation of the data, our analysis is far
38:1294:107300:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:from deÖnitive proof of the importance of non-cognitive skills.  The estimates of non-cognitive
38:1295:107395:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:impacts could su§er from attrition bias and are somewhat imprecisely estimated.  Moreover, our
38:1296:107489:20:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:analysis does not show that manipulating non-cognitive skills directly has causal impacts on adult
38:1297:107587:21:20:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:outcomes.  We have shown that high quality KG classes improve both non-cognitive skills and
38:1298:107678:20:16:72:540:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:adult outcomes, but the mechanism through which adult outcomes are improved could run through

39:1302:108014:21:34:72:450:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to analyze interventions that target non-cognitive skills directly in future work.
39:1303:108096:34:31:252:358:654:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:VII.  Conclusion
39:1304:108112:31:21:72:540:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The impacts of education have traditionally been measured by achievement on standardized tests.
39:1305:108207:21:20:72:540:602:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This paper has shown that the classroom environments that raise test scores also improve long-term
39:1306:108305:20:20:72:540:582:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:outcomes.  Students who were randomly assigned to higher quality classrooms in grades K-3 earn
39:1307:108399:20:21:72:540:562:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:more, are more likely to attend college, save more for retirement, and live in better neighborhoods.
39:1308:108499:21:20:72:540:541:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Yet the same students do not do much better on standardized tests in later grades.  These results
39:1309:108596:20:20:72:540:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:suggest that policy makers may wish to rethink the objective of raising test scores and evaluating
39:1310:108694:20:21:72:540:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:interventions via long-term test score gains.  Researchers who had examined only the impacts of
39:1311:108789:21:20:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:STAR on test scores would have incorrectly concluded that early childhood education does not
39:1312:108881:20:20:72:540:460:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:have long-lasting impacts.  While the quality of education is best judged by directly measuring its
39:1313:108980:20:21:72:540:440:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:impacts on adult outcomes, our analysis suggests thatcontemporaneous(end-of-year) test scores
39:1314:109073:21:20:71:409:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are a reasonably good short-run measure of the quality of a classroom.
39:1315:109143:20:20:88:539:399:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We conclude by using our empirical estimates to provide rough calculations of the beneÖts of
39:1316:109235:20:20:71:539:379:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:various policy interventions (see Online Appendix C for details).  These cost-beneÖt calculations
39:1317:109332:20:21:71:539:359:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rely on several strong assumptions.  We assume that the percentage gain in earnings observed at
39:1318:109427:21:20:71:539:338:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:age 27 remains constant over the lifecycle.  We ignore non-monetary returns to education (such as
39:1319:109524:20:20:71:539:318:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reduced crime) as well as general equilibrium e§ects.  We discount earnings gains at a 3% annual
39:1320:109620:20:21:71:302:298:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rate back to age 6, the point of the intervention.
39:1321:109670:21:20:88:539:277:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(1) Class Quality. The random-e§ects estimate reported in column 4 of Table VII implies that
39:1322:109762:20:20:71:539:257:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:increasing class quality by one standard deviation of the distribution within schools raises earnings
39:1323:109863:20:21:71:539:237:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by $1,520 (9.6%) at age 27.  Under the preceding assumptions, this translates into a lifetime
39:1324:109956:21:20:71:539:216:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings gain of approximately $39,100 for the average individual.   For a classroom of twenty
39:1325:110050:20:20:71:539:196:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:students, this implies a present-value beneÖt of $782,000 for improving class quality for a single
39:1326:110148:20:21:71:539:176:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:year by one (within-school) standard deviation.  This large Ögure includes all potential beneÖts
39:1327:110244:21:20:71:539:155:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:from an improved classroom environment, including better peers, teachers, and random shocks,
39:1328:110336:20:20:71:539:135:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and hence is useful primarily for understanding the stakes at play in early childhood education. It
39:1329:110435:20:21:71:539:115:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is less helpful from a policy perspective because one cannot implement interventions that directly
39:1330:110533:21:20:71:539:94:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:improve classroom quality. This motivates the analysis of class size and better teachers, two factors
39:1331:110634:20:0:71:246:74:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that contribute to classroom quality.
40:1332:110673:0:21:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(2) Class Size.  We calculate the beneÖts of reducing class size by 33% in two ways.  The Örst
40:1333:110767:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:method uses the estimated earnings gain from being assigned to a small class reported in column
40:1334:110862:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:5 of Table V.  The point estimate of $4 in Table V translates into a lifetime earnings gain from
40:1335:110958:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reducing class size by 33% for one year of $103 in present value per student, or $2,057 for a class that
40:1336:111062:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:originally had twenty students. But this estimate is imprecise: the 95% conÖdence interval for the
40:1337:111160:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:lifetime earnings gain of reducing class size by 33% for one year ranges from -$17,500 to $17,700 per
40:1338:111261:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:child. To obtain more precision, we predict the beneÖts of class size reduction using the estimated
40:1339:111360:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:impact of classroom quality on scores and earnings.  We estimate that a 1 percentile increase in
40:1340:111456:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:class quality raises test scores by 0.66 percentiles and earnings by $50.6, implying an earnings gain
40:1341:111557:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of $76.7 per percentile increase in test scores. Next, we make the strong assumption that the ratio
40:1342:111656:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of earnings gains to test score gains is the same for changes in class size as it is for improvements
40:1343:111757:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in class quality more generally.  Under this assumption, a 33% class size reduction in grades K-3
40:1344:111854:20:21:72:539:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:(which raised test scores by 4.8 percentiles) is predicted to raise earnings by4:8-$76:7 = $368
40:1345:111949:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(2.3%) at age 27.  This calculation implies a present value earnings gain from class size reduction
40:1346:112048:20:20:72:335:424:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:of $9,460 per student and $189,000 for the classroom.38
40:1347:112103:20:21:88:539:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(3) Teachers. We cannot directly estimate the total impacts of teachers on earnings in this study
40:1348:112200:21:20:71:539:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:because we observe each teacher in only one classroom, making it impossible to separate teacher
40:1349:112295:20:20:71:539:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:e§ects from peer e§ects and classroom-level shocks.  However, we can predict the magnitudes of
40:1350:112389:20:21:71:540:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:teacher e§ects as measured by value-added on test scores by drawing upon prior work.  Rocko§
40:1351:112481:21:20:71:539:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(2004), Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain (2005), and Kane and Staiger (2008) use datasets with multiple
40:1352:112578:20:20:71:539:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:classrooms per teacher to estimate that a one standard deviation increase in teacher quality raises
40:1353:112677:20:21:71:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:test scores by between 0.1 and 0.2 standard deviations (2.7-5.4 percentiles).39Under the strong
40:1354:112772:21:20:71:539:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:assumption that the ratio of earnings gains to test score gains is the same for changes in teacher
40:1355:112870:20:20:71:540:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:quality and class quality more broadly, this test score gain implies an earnings gain of$208-$416
40:1356:112967:20:21:71:539:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(1.3%-2.6%) at age 27 and a present-value earnings gain ranging from $5,350-$10,700 per student.
40:1357:113063:21:20:71:539:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Hence, we predict that a one standard deviation improvement in teacher quality in a single year
40:1358:113158:20:20:71:539:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:would generate earnings gains between $107,000 and $214,000 for a classroom of twenty students.
40:1359:113253:20:17:71:539:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:These predictions are roughly consistent with the Öndings of Chetty, Friedman, and Rocko§ (2011),
40:1360:113350:17:15:80:539:143:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:38Krueger (1999) projects a gain from small-class attendence of$9;603for men and$7;851for women.  Neither
40:1361:113455:15:7:72:359:128:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:of our estimates are statistically distinguishable from these predictions.
40:1362:113529:7:14:80:539:121:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:39We use estimates of the impacts of teacher quality on scores from other studies to predict earnings gains because
40:1363:113644:14:11:72:540:107:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:we do not have repeat observations on teachers in our data.  In future work, it would be extremely valuable to
40:1364:113754:11:11:72:542:96:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:link datasets with repeat observations on teachers to administrative data on students in order to measure teachersí
40:1365:113869:11:0:72:188:85:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:impacts on earnings directly.
41:1366:113900:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:who directly estimate the impacts of teacher value-added on earnings using a dataset that contains
41:1367:113998:21:20:72:300:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:information on multiple classrooms per teacher.
41:1368:114045:20:20:88:539:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our results suggest that good teachers could potentially create great social value, perhaps
41:1369:114136:20:21:72:539:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:several times larger than current teacher salaries.40However, our Öndings do not have direct
41:1370:114228:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:implications for optimal teacher salaries or merit pay policies as we do not know whether higher
41:1371:114324:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:salaries or merit pay would improve teacher quality.41Relative to e§orts that seek to improve the
41:1372:114421:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:quality of teachers, class size reductions have the important advantage of being more well-deÖned
41:1373:114518:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and straightforward to implement. However, reductions in class size must be implemented carefully
41:1374:114615:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to generate improvements in outcomes.  If schools are forced to reduce teacher and class quality
41:1375:114711:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:along other dimensions when reducing class size, the net gains from class size reduction may be
41:1376:114806:21:20:72:307:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:diminished (Jepsen and Rivkin 2009, Sims 2009).
41:1377:114853:20:20:88:539:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Finally, our analysis raises the possibility that di§erences in school quality perpetuate income
41:1378:114949:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:inequality.  In the U.S., higher income families have access to better public schools on average
41:1379:115045:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:because of property-tax Önance.   Using the class quality impacts reported above, Chetty and
41:1380:115137:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Friedman (2011) estimate that the intergenerational correlation of income would fall by roughly
41:1381:115232:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1/3 if all children attended schools of the same quality.  Improving early childhood education in
41:1382:115329:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:disadvantaged areas ñ e.g. through federal tax credits or tax policy reforms ñ could potentially
41:1383:115425:20:16:72:232:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reduce inequality in the long run.
41:1384:115459:16:15:80:539:347:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:40According to calculations from the 2006-2008 American Community Survey, the mean salary for elementary and
41:1385:115567:15:7:72:332:332:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:middle school teachers in the U.S. was $39,164 (in 2009 dollars).
41:1386:115632:7:15:80:539:325:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:41An analogy with executive compensation might be helpful in understanding this point.  CEOsídecisions have
41:1387:115739:15:11:72:540:310:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:large impacts on the Örms they run, and hence can create or destroy large amounts of economic value.  But this does
41:1388:115854:11:0:72:523:299:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:not necessarily imply that increasing CEO compensation or pay-for-performance would improve CEO decisions.

45:1504:124125:14:14:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:detail.  The match algorithm was designed to match as many records as possible using variables

45:1507:124411:14:13:72:540:507:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on ex post outcomes. First name and ZIP code in tax data are contingent on observing some ex
45:1508:124503:13:14:72:540:494:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:post outcome. First name data derive from information returns, which are typically generated after
45:1509:124601:14:13:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:an adult outcome like employment (W-2 forms), college attendance (1098-T forms), and mortgage
45:1510:124694:13:14:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:interest payment (1098 forms). The ZIP code on the claiming parentís 1040 return is typically from
45:1511:124792:14:13:72:540:453:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1996 and is thus contingent on the ex post outcome of the STAR subject not having moved far

45:1513:124920:14:13:88:539:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:89.8% of STAR records were matched using only ex ante information.  The algorithm Örst
45:1514:125006:13:14:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:matched as many records as possible using only SSN, date of birth, gender, and last name. It then

45:1516:125196:14:13:72:540:385:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:often leaving only one candidate record remaining. Because that exclusion did not condition on an
45:1517:125293:13:14:72:540:372:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:information return having been Öled on behalf of that remaining candidate, these matches also did
45:1518:125390:14:13:72:240:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:not condition on ex post outcomes.
45:1519:125424:13:14:88:539:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The match algorithm proceeded as follows, generating seven match types denoted A through

45:1521:125602:13:14:72:540:318:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and account for 89.8% of STAR records. Matches based on ex-post-information are denoted F and
45:1522:125695:14:13:72:540:304:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:G below and constitute an additional 5.4% of STAR records. The paper reports results using the

50:1857:137205:25:14:88:539:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We make the following assumptions to calculate the beneÖts of the policies considered in the
50:1858:137297:14:14:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:conclusion.  First, following Krueger (1999), we assume a 3% annual discount rate and discount
50:1859:137391:14:13:72:540:288:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:all earnings streams back to age 6, the point of the intervention.  Second, we use the mean wage
50:1860:137487:13:14:72:540:275:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings of a random sample of the U.S. population in 2007 as a baseline earnings proÖle over the
50:1861:137584:14:13:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:lifecycle.  Third, because we can observe earnings impacts only up to age 27, we must make an
50:1862:137677:13:14:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:assumption about the impacts after that point.  We assume that the percentage gain observed
50:1863:137768:14:13:72:540:234:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:at age 27 remains constant over the lifecycle.  This assumption may understate the total beneÖts
50:1864:137864:13:14:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:because the earnings impacts appear to grow over time, for example as college graduates have
50:1865:137956:14:13:72:540:207:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:steeper earnings proÖles.  Finally, our calculations ignore non-monetary returns to education such
50:1866:138054:13:14:72:540:194:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:as reduced crime.  They also ignore general equilibrium e§ects: increasing the education of the
50:1867:138149:14:13:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:population at large would increase the supply of skilled labor and may depress wage rates for more
50:1868:138247:13:14:72:540:167:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:educated individuals, reducing total social beneÖts.  Under these assumptions, we calculate the
50:1869:138342:14:14:72:540:153:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:present-value earnings gains for a classroom of 20 students from three interventions: improvements
50:1870:138440:14:13:72:465:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in classroom quality, reductions in class size, and improvements in teacher quality.
50:1871:138524:13:14:88:539:126:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(1) Class Quality. The random-e§ects estimate reported in column 4 of Table VII implies that
50:1872:138616:14:13:72:540:112:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:increasing class quality by one standard deviation of the distribution within schools raises earnings
50:1873:138717:13:14:72:540:99:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by $1,520 (9.6%) at age 27.   Under the preceding assumptions, this translates into a lifetime
50:1874:138811:14:13:72:540:85:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings gain of approximately $39,100 for the average individual.  This implies a present-value
50:1875:138907:13:0:72:490:72:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:beneÖt of $782,000 for improving class quality by one within-school standard deviation.
51:1876:138996:0:14:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(2) Class Size.  We calculate the beneÖts of reducing class size by 33% in two ways.  The Örst
51:1877:139090:14:14:72:540:695:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:method uses the estimated earnings gain from being assigned to a small class reported in column
51:1878:139185:14:13:72:540:681:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:5 of Table V.  The point estimate of $4 in Table V translates into a lifetime earnings gain from
51:1879:139281:13:14:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reducing class size by 33% for one year of $103 in present value per student, or $2,057 for a class
51:1880:139380:14:13:72:540:654:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that originally had twenty students.  But this estimate is imprecise: the 95% conÖdence interval
51:1881:139476:13:14:72:540:641:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for the lifetime earnings gain of reducing class size by 33% for one year ranges from -$17,500 to
51:1882:139573:14:13:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:$17,700 per child. Moreover, the results for other measures such as college attendance suggest that
51:1883:139672:13:14:72:314:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the earnings impact may be larger in the long run.
51:1884:139722:14:13:88:539:600:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:To obtain more precise estimates, we predict the gains from class size reduction using the
51:1885:139812:13:14:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:estimated impact of classroom quality on scores and earnings.  We estimate that a 1 percentile
51:1886:139906:14:13:72:540:573:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:increase in class quality raises test scores by 0.66 percentiles and earnings by $50.6.  This implies
51:1887:140007:13:14:72:540:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:an earnings gain of $76.67 per percentile (or 13.1% per standard deviation) increase in test scores.
51:1888:140107:14:14:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We make the strong assumption that the ratio of earnings gains to test score gains is the same
51:1889:140201:14:13:72:539:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for changes in class size as it is for improvements in class quality more generally.44Under this
51:1890:140297:13:14:72:540:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:assumption, smaller classes (which raised test scores by 4.8 percentiles) are predicted to raise
51:1891:140393:14:13:72:539:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings by4:8-$76:7 = $368(2.3%) at age 27. This calculation implies a present value earnings
51:1892:140487:13:14:72:472:492:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:gain from class size reduction of $9,460 per student and $189,000 for the classroom.
51:1893:140571:14:13:88:539:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Calculations analogous to those in Krueger (1999) imply that the average cost per child of
51:1894:140661:13:14:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reducing class size by 33% for 2.14 years (the mean treatment duration for STAR students) is
51:1895:140753:14:13:72:539:451:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:$9,355 in 2009 dollars.45Our second calculation suggests that the beneÖt of reducing class size
51:1896:140848:13:14:72:540:438:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:might outweigh the costs. However, we must wait for more time to elapse before we can determine
51:1897:140943:14:14:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:whether the predicted earnings gains based on the class quality estimates are in fact realized by
51:1898:141040:14:13:72:241:410:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:those who attended smaller classes.
51:1899:141075:13:14:88:539:397:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(3) Teachers.  We calculate the beneÖts of improving teacher quality in two ways.  The Örst
51:1900:141166:14:13:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:method uses the estimated earnings gain of $57 from being assigned to a kindergarten teacher with
51:1901:141263:13:14:72:540:370:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:one year of extra experience, reported in Figure IIIb. The standard deviation of teacher experience
51:1902:141362:14:13:72:540:356:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in our sample is 5.8 years.  Hence, a one standard deviation increase in teacher experience raises
51:1903:141460:13:14:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings by $331 (2.1%) at age 27. This translates into a lifetime earnings gain of $8,500 in present
51:1904:141561:14:13:72:303:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:value, or $170,000 for a class of twenty students.
51:1905:141611:13:14:88:539:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The limitation of the preceding calculation is that it is based upon only one observable aspect of
51:1906:141709:14:13:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:teacher quality. To incorporate other aspects of teacher quality, we again develop a prediction based
51:1907:141810:13:14:72:540:289:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on the impacts of class quality on scores and earnings. Rocko§ (2004), Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain
51:1908:141907:14:14:72:540:275:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(2005), and Kane and Staiger (2008) use datasets with repeated teacher observations to estimate
51:1909:142002:14:13:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that a one standard deviation increase in teacher quality raises test scores by approximately 0.2
51:1910:142099:13:14:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:standard deviations (5.4 percentiles). Under the strong assumption that the ratio of earnings gains
51:1911:142198:14:13:72:540:234:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to test score gains is the same for changes in teacher quality and class quality more broadly, this
51:1912:142297:13:14:72:539:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:translates into an earnings gain of5:4-$76:7 = $416(2.6%) at age 27. This implies a present-value
51:1913:142394:14:13:72:540:207:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings gain of $10,700 per student. A one standard deviation improvement in teacher quality in
51:1914:142490:13:16:72:453:194:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a single year generates earnings gains of $214,000 for a class of twenty students.
51:1915:142572:16:15:80:539:178:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:44This assumption clearly does not hold for all types of interventions.  As an extreme example, raising test scores
51:1916:142687:15:11:72:540:163:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:by cheating would be unlikely to yield an earnings gain of $77 per percentile improvement in test scores.  The $77
51:1917:142801:11:11:72:540:152:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:per percentile measure should be viewed as a prior estimate of the expected gain when evaluating interventions such
51:1918:142916:11:7:72:474:141:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:as class size or teacher quality for which precise estimates of earnings impacts are not yet available.
51:1919:143019:7:15:80:539:134:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:45This cost is obtained as follows. The annual cost of school for a child is $8,848 per year. Small classes had 15.1
51:1920:143135:15:11:72:540:119:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:students on average, while large classes had 22.56 students on average. The average small class treatment lasted 2.14
51:1921:143252:11:0:72:449:108:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:years. Hence, the cost per student of reducing class size is (22.56/15.1-1)*2.14*8848= $9,355.

76:2865:189463:13:14:54:552:231:104:Times:104:Times:randomly assigned to small and large classes. Panel (b) plots the distribution of college quality attended in 2000 using the
76:2866:189587:14:14:54:558:217:104:Times:104:Times:earnings-based college quality index described in Figure I. Individuals who did not attend college are included in Panel (b)
76:2867:189711:14:13:54:485:203:104:Times:104:Times:with college quality defined as mean earnings in the U.S. population for those who did not attend college.
76:2868:189817:13:14:54:555:190:104:Times:104:Times:Kernel-smoothed densities in Panel (b) are scaled to integrate to total attendance rates for both small and large classes. All
76:2869:189943:14:14:54:545:176:104:Times:104:Times:figures adjust for school-by-entry-grade effects to isolate the random variation in class size. In (a) and (c), we adjust for
76:2870:190068:14:14:54:544:162:104:Times:104:Times:school-by-entry-grade effects by regressing the outcome variable on school-by-entry-grade dummies and the small class
76:2871:190185:14:13:54:545:148:104:Times:104:Times:indicator in each tax year. We then construct the two series shown in the figure by requiring that the difference between
76:2872:190306:13:14:54:550:135:104:Times:104:Times:the two lines equals the regression coefficient on the small class indicator in the corresponding year and that the weighted
76:2873:190430:14:14:54:533:121:104:Times:104:Times:average of the lines equals the sample average in that year. In (b), we compute residual college mean earnings from a
76:2874:190547:14:14:54:550:107:104:Times:104:Times:regression on school-by-entry-grade effects and plot the distribution of the residual within small and large classes, adding
76:2875:190671:14:13:54:557:93:104:Times:104:Times:back the sample mean to facilitate interpretation of units. See notes to Figure I for definitions of wage earnings and college

78:2949:192883:197:13:54:535:274:104:Times:104:Times:The x axis in all panels is class quality, defined as the difference between the mean end-of-entry-grade test scores of a
78:2950:193004:13:14:54:531:261:104:Times:104:Times:student’s classmates and (grade-specific) schoolmates. Class quality is defined based on the first, randomly assigned
78:2951:193121:14:14:54:544:247:104:Times:104:Times:STAR classroom (i.e., KG classroom for KG entrants, 1st grade classroom for 1st grade entrants, etc.). In all panels, we
78:2952:193241:14:14:54:541:233:104:Times:104:Times:bin class quality into twenty equal sized (5 percentile point) bins and plot the mean of the outcome variable within each
78:2953:193362:14:13:54:535:219:104:Times:104:Times:bin. The solid line shows the best linear fit estimated on the underlying student-level data using OLS. The dependent
78:2954:193479:13:14:54:546:206:104:Times:104:Times:variable in Panel (a) is the student’s own test score at the end of the grade in which he entered STAR. The coefficient of
78:2955:193601:14:14:54:530:192:104:Times:104:Times:end-of-entry-grade test scores on class quality is 0.68 (s.e.0.03), implying that a 1 percentile improvement in class
78:2956:193719:14:14:54:548:178:104:Times:104:Times:quality is associated with a 0.68 percentile improvement in test scores. The dependent variable in Panel (b) is a student’s
78:2957:193842:14:13:54:523:164:104:Times:104:Times:test score at the end of 8th grade. The coefficient of 8th grade test scores on class quality is 0.08 (s.e.0.03). The
78:2958:193960:13:14:54:556:151:104:Times:104:Times:dependent variable in Panel (c) is a student’s mean wage earnings over years 2005-2007. The coefficient of wage earnings
78:2959:194080:14:14:54:549:137:104:Times:104:Times:on class quality is $57.6 (s.e.$16.2), implying that a 1 percentile improvement in class quality leads to a $57.6 increase
78:2960:194203:14:14:54:548:123:104:Times:104:Times:in a student’s annual earnings. All panels adjust for school-by-entry-grade effects to isolate the random variation in class
78:2961:194327:14:0:54:445:109:104:Times:104:Times:quality using the technique in Figure IIIa. See notes to Figure I for definition of wage earnings.

79:2985:194846:13:14:54:556:152:104:Times:104:Times:groups of classes: those that were above the class quality median and those that were below. Class quality is defined as the
79:2986:194970:14:14:54:538:138:104:Times:104:Times:difference between the mean end-of-entry-grade test scoresof a student’s classmates and (grade-specific) schoolmates.
79:2987:195087:14:14:54:541:124:104:Times:104:Times:Class quality is defined based on the first, randomly assigned STAR classroom (i.e., KG classroom for KG entrants, 1st
79:2988:195205:14:13:54:541:110:104:Times:104:Times:grade classroom for 1st grade entrants, etc.). Both panels adjust for school-by-entry-grade effects to isolate the random

80:3014:195800:49:14:54:531:246:104:Times:104:Times:Panel (a) shows the impact of a 1 standard deviation improvement in class quality in kindergarten on test scores from
80:3015:195917:14:14:54:557:232:104:Times:104:Times:kindergarten through grade 8, estimated using specifications analogous to Column 1 of Table VIII. Class quality is defined
80:3016:196039:14:14:54:513:218:104:Times:104:Times:as the difference between the mean end-of-kindergarten test scores of a student’s classmates and (grade-specific)
80:3017:196152:14:13:54:551:204:104:Times:104:Times:schoolmates. Panel (b) shows the effect of a 1 standard deviation improvement in KG class quality on predicted earnings.
80:3018:196272:13:14:54:530:191:104:Times:104:Times:To construct this figure, we first run separate cross-sectional regressions of earnings on test scores in each grade (see
80:3019:196393:14:14:54:552:177:104:Times:104:Times:Column 1 of Appendix Table V). We then multiply these OLS coefficients by the corresponding estimated impacts of a 1
80:3020:196509:14:14:54:555:163:104:Times:104:Times:SD improvement in KG class quality on test scores in each grade shown in Panel (a). The last point in Panel (b) shows the
80:3021:196630:14:13:54:552:149:104:Times:104:Times:actual earnings impact of a 1 SD improvement in KG class quality, estimated using a specification analogous to Column 4
80:3022:196749:13:14:54:549:136:104:Times:104:Times:of Table VIII. All regressions used to construct these figuresare run on the sample of KG entrants and control for school
80:3023:196870:14:14:54:539:122:104:Times:104:Times:fixed effects and the student and parent demographic characteristics used in Table VIII: a quartic in parent’s household
