2:32:1613:28:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:We use the Business Roundtable’s challenge to the SEC’s 2010 proxy access rule as a natural experiment
2:33:1715:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:to measure the value of shareholder proxy access.  We find that firms that would have been most vulnerable
2:34:1821:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:to proxy access, as measured by institutional ownership and activist institutional ownership in particular,
2:35:1928:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:lost value on October 4, 2010, when the SEC unexpectedly announced that it would delay implementation
2:36:2029:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:of the Rule in response to the Business Roundtable challenge. We also examine intra-day returns and
2:37:2128:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:find that the value loss occurred just after the SEC’s announcement on October 4. We find similar
2:38:2225:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:results on July 22, 2011, when the D.C. Circuit ruled in favor of the Business Roundtable.  These findings
2:39:2331:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:are consistent with the view that financial markets placed a positive value on shareholder access, as
2:40:2432:14:42:72:254:462:12:Times:12:Times:implemented in the SEC’s 2010 Rule.

3:59:2810:19:18:192:423:672:257:Times:257:Times:the Business Roundtable Challenge 
3:60:2844:18:15:305:309:654:257:Times:257:Times: 
3:61:2844:15:27:108:533:639:144:Times:144:Times:Shareholder access to the company’s proxy statement has been one of the most heated – 
3:62:2930:27:28:71:517:612:144:Times:144:Times:if not the most heated – topics in corporate governance over the past decade.1  Opponents of 
3:63:3023:28:27:72:490:584:144:Times:144:Times:proxy access argue that it would shift a dangerous amount of power to certain kinds of 
3:64:3110:27:28:72:498:557:144:Times:144:Times:shareholders (for example, union pension funds) who could pursue objectives counter to 
3:65:3197:28:28:72:511:529:144:Times:144:Times:shareholder value maximization (e.g., Bainbridge 2003).  They also argue that high-quality 
3:66:3288:28:27:72:534:501:144:Times:144:Times:directors may be less willing to serve on boards if they must face competition from shareholder-
3:67:3384:27:28:72:516:474:144:Times:144:Times:sponsored candidates (e.g., Lipton and Rosenblum 2003).  Proponents of shareholder access 
3:68:3474:28:27:72:529:446:144:Times:144:Times:argue that competition in the director election process is desirable, and that giving institutional 
3:69:3574:27:28:72:511:419:144:Times:144:Times:investors more influence in the director election process will likely benefit all shareholders 
3:70:3669:28:28:72:279:391:144:Times:144:Times:(Bebchuk 2003, Bebchuk and Hirst 2010). 
3:71:3709:28:27:108:499:363:144:Times:144:Times:We use the Business Roundtable’s challenge to the proxy access rule as a natural 
3:72:3790:27:28:72:507:336:144:Times:144:Times:experiment to measure the value of shareholder proxy access.  On August 25, 2010, under 
3:73:3878:28:27:72:501:308:144:Times:144:Times:authority provided by Section 971 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
3:74:3962:27:28:72:523:281:144:Times:144:Times:Protection Act, the SEC enacted a shareholder proxy access rule (the “Rule”).  This Rule was 
3:75:4055:28:27:72:516:253:144:Times:144:Times:intended to go into effect on November 15, 2010.  On September 29, however, the Business 
3:76:4144:27:28:71:509:226:144:Times:144:Times:Roundtable filed a petition in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals challenging the new Rule, 
3:77:4235:28:28:72:522:198:144:Times:144:Times:alleging that it was arbitrary and capricious, exceeded the SEC’s authority, and would reduce 
3:78:4329:28:27:72:514:170:144:Times:144:Times:overall shareholder wealth.  In a move that surprised most observers, on October 4 the SEC 
3:79:4420:27:34:72:523:143:144:Times:144:Times:announced that it would delay implementation of the new Rule until the Business Roundtable 
3:80:4511:34:8:216:219:109:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
3:81:4559:8:16:72:516:101:42:Times:100:Times:1 See, e.g., Business Roundtable and U.S. Chamber of Commerce v. U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission, 
3:82:4663:16:11:71:520:85:100:Times:100:Times:Complaint filed Sept. 29, 2010 at 2 (“Few issues in corporate governance have generated more disagreement or 
3:83:4772:11:0:71:155:74:100:Times:100:Times:stronger passions.”). 
4:84:4796:0:27:71:537:708:144:Times:144:Times:challenge was resolved.  On July 22, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit struck 
4:85:4893:27:28:71:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:down the Rule under the Administrative Procedure Act, accepting the Business Roundtable’s 
4:86:4983:28:27:71:502:653:144:Times:144:Times:argument that the SEC was insufficiently deliberate and rational in adopting the Rule.  In 
4:87:5074:27:28:71:542:626:144:Times:144:Times:September 2011, the SEC announced that it would not appeal the D.C. Circuit’s ruling, but rather 
4:88:5171:28:28:71:448:598:144:Times:144:Times:would permit shareholders to pursue access on a company-by-company basis. 
4:89:5245:28:27:107:530:570:144:Times:144:Times:The Business Roundtable’s challenge to the SEC’s proxy access rule provides the basis 
4:90:5331:27:28:71:541:543:144:Times:144:Times:for an event study.  If shareholder access increases shareholder value, then companies that would 
4:91:5429:28:27:71:514:515:144:Times:144:Times:have been most exposed to the new Rule should decline in value, relative to companies that 
4:92:5520:27:28:71:518:488:144:Times:144:Times:would have been more insulated from the Rule, in response to the SEC’s unexpected stay on 
4:93:5610:28:28:71:523:460:144:Times:144:Times:proxy access (October 4, 2010) and the (arguably) unexpected decision by the D.C. Circuit to 
4:94:5703:28:27:71:517:432:144:Times:144:Times:invalidate proxy access (July 22, 2011).  If instead shareholder access decreases shareholder 
4:95:5797:27:28:71:532:405:144:Times:144:Times:value, then companies that would have been most exposed to the Rule should increase in value, 
4:96:5891:28:27:71:533:377:144:Times:144:Times:relative to those what would have been more insulated, on these dates.  This natural experiment 
4:97:5987:27:28:71:493:350:144:Times:144:Times:allows a rough quantification of the value of shareholder proxy access.  In addition, the 
4:98:6077:28:27:71:531:322:144:Times:144:Times:experiment allows testing of hypotheses about board influence.  If there is heterogeneity across 
4:99:6174:27:28:71:518:295:144:Times:144:Times:firms in the value of shareholder influence through the board of directors, or across different 
4:100:6270:28:28:71:506:267:144:Times:144:Times:types of shareholders in their ability to improve the value of firms, our natural experiment 
4:101:6363:28:27:71:333:239:144:Times:144:Times:provides an opportunity to quantify those differences. 
4:102:6418:27:28:107:510:212:144:Times:144:Times:We use measures of institutional ownership, and activist institutional ownership2 in 
4:103:6503:28:75:71:537:184:144:Times:144:Times:particular, as a proxy for vulnerability to the Rule.  Using a 1-day event window around October 
4:104:6600:75:8:216:219:109:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
4:105:6648:8:16:72:501:101:42:Times:100:Times:2 By activist hedge fund, we refer to hedge funds with a history of corporate activism and intervention (see 
4:106:6757:16:11:71:519:85:100:Times:100:Times:Greenwood and Schor 2009 and Brav, Jiang, Partnoy, and Thomas 2008). We discuss the motivation for this in 
4:107:6864:11:0:71:148:74:100:Times:100:Times:more detail below. 
5:108:6885:0:27:71:520:708:144:Times:144:Times:4, 2010,3 we find that share prices of companies that would have been most vulnerable to the 
5:109:6978:27:28:72:526:681:144:Times:144:Times:Rule declined significantly compared to share prices of companies that would have been most 
5:110:7070:28:27:72:531:653:144:Times:144:Times:insulated from the Rule.   Specifically, we find a 44 basis point spread between firms with high 
5:111:7167:27:28:72:521:626:144:Times:144:Times:institutional ownership and firms with low institutional ownership for that day’s returns. The 
5:112:7262:28:28:72:502:598:144:Times:144:Times:pattern of lower returns for firms with higher institutional ownership holds true for equal-
5:113:7354:28:27:72:516:570:144:Times:144:Times:weighted excess return portfolios (37 basis point differential), as well as portfolios based on 
5:114:7450:27:28:72:508:543:144:Times:144:Times:activist ownership (43 basis point differential). All three of these estimates are statistically 
5:115:7547:28:27:72:506:515:144:Times:144:Times:significant. In a regression setting, we confirm that institutional ownership, and especially 
5:116:7641:27:28:72:534:488:144:Times:144:Times:activist institutional ownership, was correlated with negative returns on October 4.  For July 22, 
5:117:7740:28:28:72:539:460:144:Times:144:Times:2011, we find results that are directionally similar to the October 4, 2010 results, slightly smaller 
5:118:7842:28:27:72:528:432:144:Times:144:Times:in magnitude and statistically significant.  Taken as a whole, these findings are consistent with 
5:119:7940:27:28:72:537:405:144:Times:144:Times:the view that financial markets placed a positive value on shareholder access, as implemented in 
5:120:8037:28:27:72:513:377:144:Times:144:Times:the SEC’s August 2010 Rule. Presumably, the stock market perceived the stay as a reduced 
5:121:8126:27:28:72:529:350:144:Times:144:Times:likelihood of proxy access in the short run as well as in the long run, perhaps seeing the stay as 
5:122:8225:28:27:72:466:322:144:Times:144:Times:indication of the SEC’s own perception of their ability to defend the rule in court. 
5:123:8310:27:28:108:532:295:144:Times:144:Times:We also use intra-day data on October 4 to determine whether our overall results can be 
5:124:8398:28:28:72:529:267:144:Times:144:Times:attributed to shareholder proxy access.  We find that virtually all of the observed activist effect 
5:125:8498:28:27:72:519:239:144:Times:144:Times:comes after the 12:21 pm announcement of the SEC stay – a period during which the overall 
5:126:8588:27:28:72:496:212:144:Times:144:Times:market hardly moved.   The value loss in activist-held firms appears to have accelerated 
5:127:8677:28:27:72:536:184:144:Times:144:Times:substantially after a Bloomberg news story about the SEC stay appeared at 3:20 pm. These intra-
5:128:8772:27:48:72:506:157:144:Times:144:Times:day results suggest that the relative drop in the market value of equity for firms with large 
5:129:8866:48:8:216:219:109:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
5:130:8914:8:16:72:537:101:42:Times:100:Times:3 Using a one-day event window to study proxy access is tantamount to focusing on the market’s short term view of 
5:131:9028:16:11:71:531:85:100:Times:100:Times:the announcement’s value effect. Unfortunately, the event study methodology is much less suitable for identifying 
5:132:9142:11:0:71:508:74:100:Times:100:Times:the market’s long-term views (since long term stock returns are more variable than short term stock returns). 
6:133:9254:0:27:71:516:708:144:Times:144:Times:activist ownership can be attributed to the SEC’s announcement delaying shareholder proxy

6:135:9352:28:27:108:528:653:144:Times:144:Times:The paper proceeds in six sections.  Section 1 summarizes the evolution of shareholder 
6:136:9439:27:28:72:540:626:144:Times:144:Times:access in the U.S.  Section 2 reviews the existing related literature on proxy access and corporate 
6:137:9539:28:28:72:531:598:144:Times:144:Times:governance more generally.  Section 3 explains our empirical strategy.  Section 4 describes our 
6:138:9635:28:27:72:495:570:144:Times:144:Times:data and methodology.  Section 5 presents our results, and Section 6 discusses potential 
6:139:9724:27:28:72:249:543:144:Times:144:Times:interpretations. Section 7 concludes.

6:142:9835:28:28:108:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:The corporate law of every U.S. jurisdiction requires that corporations hold an annual 
6:143:9922:28:27:72:520:432:144:Times:144:Times:meeting to elect directors.  In this election, the company will invariably nominate exactly the 
6:144:10018:27:28:72:536:405:144:Times:144:Times:number of candidates to fill the available seats – for example, seven candidates for seven seats.   
6:145:10118:28:27:72:523:377:144:Times:144:Times:Shareholders of the corporation have the right to nominate their own candidates to the board.  
6:146:10213:27:28:72:527:350:144:Times:144:Times:Any shareholder can propose a nominee to the board’s nominating committee, but if the board 
6:147:10305:28:27:72:511:322:144:Times:144:Times:refuses to put the shareholder’s candidate on the company’s slate (which is by far the more 
6:148:10397:27:28:72:525:295:144:Times:144:Times:common outcome), the shareholder would have to engage in a time-consuming and expensive 
6:149:10485:28:28:72:539:267:144:Times:144:Times:process in order to get their candidate seated.  Specifically, a shareholder who wants to nominate 
6:150:10584:28:27:72:524:239:144:Times:144:Times:one or more candidates would have to file Schedule 14A with the SEC, hire a proxy solicitor, 
6:151:10677:27:69:72:537:212:144:Times:144:Times:and often engage in an expensive public campaign to support their nominee or nominees.  These

6:153:10819:7:16:72:524:136:42:Times:100:Times:4 The intra-day findings respond to critics of an earlier version of our paper, who expressed skepticism about the 
6:154:10934:16:12:72:487:120:100:Times:100:Times:validity of event study methodology in general and the causal inferences that can be drawn from such a 
6:155:11037:12:11:72:522:108:100:Times:100:Times:methodology. See, e.g., David Marcus, The Proxy Access Problem, THE DEAL (Nov. 24, 2010) (“[R]eaders with 
6:156:11143:11:12:72:526:97:100:Times:100:Times:little understanding of and less confidence in the black art of regression analysis may well be skeptical of a paper 
6:157:11260:12:11:72:538:85:100:Times:100:Times:that claims to be able to assign a value measured in basis points to a single amorphous factor on a single trading day 
6:158:11379:11:0:72:280:74:100:Times:100:Times:among the dozens that affect the value of stocks.”). 
7:159:11434:0:27:71:511:708:144:Times:144:Times:expenses are only reimbursed if the shareholder gains control of the board.5  Moreover, the 
7:160:11526:27:28:72:535:681:144:Times:144:Times:shareholder must share the benefits of any improvement in corporate performance pro rata with 
7:161:11620:28:27:72:521:653:144:Times:144:Times:the other shareholders.  As a result of these obstacles, contested director elections outside the 
7:162:11718:27:28:72:520:626:144:Times:144:Times:context of a hostile takeover bid have been exceedingly rare in corporate America  (Bebchuk 
7:163:11810:28:28:72:110:598:144:Times:144:Times:2003).6 
7:164:11817:28:27:108:505:570:144:Times:144:Times:Against this backdrop, many commentators have viewed shareholder access to the 
7:165:11896:27:28:72:540:543:144:Times:144:Times:company’s proxy statement as an essential step to make director elections more meaningful, and, 
7:166:11992:28:27:72:524:515:144:Times:144:Times:by extension, to improve overall corporate governance.  After decades of discussion,7 and not 
7:167:12086:27:28:72:542:488:144:Times:144:Times:coincidentally in the wake of corporate scandals at Enron, Worldcom, and other large U.S. public 
7:168:12183:28:28:71:531:460:144:Times:144:Times:companies, the SEC proposed a shareholder access rule in October 2003.  Under the 2003 rule, 
7:169:12276:28:27:72:505:432:144:Times:144:Times:shareholders would gain the right to place one or more nominees on the company’s proxy 
7:170:12363:27:28:72:541:405:144:Times:144:Times:statement after one of two trigger events had occurred: (1) “withhold” votes of more than 35% of 
7:171:12460:28:27:71:514:377:144:Times:144:Times:votes had been cast for one or more directors; or (2) a majority vote for a 14a-8 shareholder 
7:172:12554:27:28:71:536:350:144:Times:144:Times:access proposal, proposed by a shareholder or shareholder group that had held at least 1% of the 
7:173:12651:28:27:72:538:322:144:Times:144:Times:company’s shares for at least one year.   The Business Roundtable and other groups representing 
7:174:12747:27:28:72:529:295:144:Times:144:Times:director and management interests engaged in a lobbying effort against the proposed Rule.  By 
7:175:12841:28:28:72:540:267:144:Times:144:Times:early 2005, the SEC issued a series of no-action letters permitting companies to omit shareholder 
7:176:12939:28:61:72:434:239:144:Times:144:Times:proposals based on the proposed rule, effectively withdrawing its proposal. 
7:177:13015:61:8:216:219:178:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
7:178:13063:8:16:72:533:170:42:Times:100:Times:5 For the classic statement of this rule, see Rosenfeld v. Fairchild Engine & Airplane Corp., 128 N.E. 2d 291 (N.Y. 
7:179:13179:16:7:71:97:154:100:Times:100:Times:1955) 
7:180:13185:7:16:72:526:147:42:Times:100:Times:6 In July 2007, the SEC promulgated its long-awaited “eProxy Rules,” which allow insurgents to post their proxy 
7:181:13297:16:11:72:527:131:100:Times:100:Times:materials on-line and simply mail shareholders a “Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials.”   In theory, 
7:182:13413:11:12:72:531:120:100:Times:100:Times:eProxy rules should reduce the costs of proxy solicitation and increase the number of contested director elections.  
7:183:13530:12:11:72:519:108:100:Times:100:Times:However, the early empirical evidence suggests that the number of contested director elections did not increase 
7:184:13642:11:7:72:267:97:100:Times:100:Times:substantially in the 2009 or 2010 proxy seasons. 
7:185:13691:7:16:72:520:90:42:Times:100:Times:7 See Proposed Rule, 74 Fed. Reg. at 29,029 n. 73 (June 18, 2009) (noting that the Commission first considered 
7:186:13802:16:0:71:163:74:100:Times:100:Times:proxy access in 1942). 
8:187:13827:0:27:107:486:708:144:Times:144:Times:In 2006, the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees 
8:188:13902:27:28:71:530:681:144:Times:144:Times:(AFSCME) submitted a shareholder proposal to American International Group (AIG) to amend 
8:189:13991:28:27:71:530:653:144:Times:144:Times:AIG’s bylaws so that a 3% shareholder could place one nominee in AIG’s proxy materials – in 
8:190:14083:27:28:71:540:626:144:Times:144:Times:effect, trying to do at AIG what the SEC’s proposed Rule 14a-11 had tried to do more generally.  
8:191:14180:28:28:71:537:598:144:Times:144:Times:Surprising many commentators, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals held that this proposal was 
8:192:14274:28:27:71:528:570:144:Times:144:Times:not excludable under the Rule 14a-8(i)(8) exclusion, which at the time permitted companies to 
8:193:14368:27:28:71:492:543:144:Times:144:Times:exclude proposals “relat[ing] to an election for membership on the company’s board of 
8:194:14454:28:27:71:529:515:144:Times:144:Times:directors.”  The court found that the proposal related to board elections broadly, and not to “an 
8:195:14551:27:28:71:512:488:144:Times:144:Times:election” of directors.8  The holding seemed to open up the possibility of proxy access on a 
8:196:14644:28:28:72:518:460:144:Times:144:Times:company-by-company basis.  But in December 2007, the SEC amended the Rule 14a-8(i)(8) 
8:197:14730:28:27:72:539:432:144:Times:144:Times:exclusion to permit corporations to exclude proposals “relating to an election for membership on 
8:198:14827:27:28:72:500:405:144:Times:144:Times:the company’s board” or relating to “a procedure for such nomination or election.”  This 
8:199:14916:28:27:72:486:377:144:Times:144:Times:amendment was intended to reverse the Second Circuit’s holding in AFSCME v. AIG. 
8:200:14997:27:28:108:531:350:144:Times:144:Times:Shareholder proxy access remained dormant until May 2009, when the SEC returned to 
8:201:15080:28:27:72:512:322:144:Times:144:Times:the issue with a new shareholder access proposal.  The SEC explained: “The nation and the 
8:202:15170:27:28:72:534:295:144:Times:144:Times:markets have recently experienced, and remain in the midst of, one of the most serious crises of 
8:203:15267:28:28:72:535:267:144:Times:144:Times:the past century.  This crisis has led many to raise serious concerns about the accountability and 
8:204:15366:28:27:72:528:239:144:Times:144:Times:responsiveness of some companies and boards of directors to the interests of shareholders, and 
8:205:15461:27:28:72:543:212:144:Times:144:Times:has resulted in a loss of investor confidence.”9  Under the proposed Rule 14a-11, a shareholder or 
8:206:15560:28:27:72:533:184:144:Times:144:Times:shareholder group that owned more than 1% of a large U.S. public company (defined as market 
8:207:15652:27:28:72:523:157:144:Times:144:Times:capitalization greater than $700 million), more than 3% of a midsize public company (market 
8:208:15744:28:20:72:487:129:144:Times:144:Times:capitalization $75-$700 million), or more than 5% of a small public company (market

8:210:15876:8:11:72:272:101:42:Times:100:Times:8 AFSCME v. AIG, 462 F.3d 121 (2nd Cir. 2006). 
8:211:15923:11:16:72:521:90:42:Times:100:Times:9 Securities and Exchange Commission Proposed Rule Facilitating Shareholder Director Nominations (June 10, 
8:212:16030:16:0:71:99:74:100:Times:100:Times:2009). 
9:213:16039:0:27:71:534:708:144:Times:144:Times:capitalization less than $75 million) would have the ability to place nominees on the company’s 
9:214:16135:27:28:71:369:681:144:Times:144:Times:proxy statement for up to one-quarter of the total board seats. 
9:215:16199:28:27:107:527:653:144:Times:144:Times:In an effort to preempt or at least shape the SEC’s consideration of shareholder access, 
9:216:16288:27:28:71:531:626:144:Times:144:Times:Delaware amended its corporate code to confirm that shareholders could amend the company’s 
9:217:16379:28:28:71:534:598:144:Times:144:Times:bylaws to permit proxy access.  Section 112 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, enacted 
9:218:16472:28:27:71:542:570:144:Times:144:Times:in May 2009, provides that: “The bylaws may provide that if the corporation solicits proxies with 
9:219:16570:27:28:71:510:543:144:Times:144:Times:respect to an election of directors, it may be required . . . to include in its proxy solicitation 
9:220:16669:28:27:71:508:515:144:Times:144:Times:materials . . . 1 or more individuals nominated by a stockholder.”  Section 112 reflects one 
9:221:16762:27:28:71:537:488:144:Times:144:Times:application of the Delaware Supreme Court’s holding in CA v. AFSCME,10 handed down in July 
9:222:16853:28:28:72:530:460:144:Times:144:Times:2008, which permits shareholders to regulate procedural aspects of corporate governance (e.g., 
9:223:16948:28:27:72:529:432:144:Times:144:Times:how decisions are made) but not substantive aspects, which are left to the board.  Thus Section 
9:224:17044:27:28:72:521:405:144:Times:144:Times:112 confirmed the shareholders’ right to opt-in to proxy access (a so-called “voluntary proxy 
9:225:17138:28:27:72:157:377:144:Times:144:Times:access regime”).  
9:226:17156:27:28:108:495:350:144:Times:144:Times:In July 2010, the U.S. Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 
9:227:17233:28:27:72:503:322:144:Times:144:Times:Consumer Protection Act.  Notwithstanding Delaware’s efforts to preempt federal action, 
9:228:17321:27:28:72:542:295:144:Times:144:Times:Section 971 of the Act amended Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act to provide the SEC 
9:229:17416:28:28:72:529:267:144:Times:144:Times:explicit authority to adopt proxy access rules.  By confirming that the SEC had the authority to 
9:230:17513:28:27:72:540:239:144:Times:144:Times:issue shareholder access rules and signaling Congress’s support for such rules, Section 971 made 
9:231:17610:27:28:72:390:212:144:Times:144:Times:shareholder proxy access inevitable, according to most observers. 
9:232:17676:28:27:108:534:184:144:Times:144:Times:On August 25, 2010, by a 3-2 vote, the SEC announced the adoption of a final Rule 14a-
9:233:17762:27:28:72:538:157:144:Times:144:Times:11, mandating proxy access at all U.S. public companies.  Any shareholder or shareholder group 
9:234:17857:28:28:72:525:129:144:Times:144:Times:that held more than 3% of a U.S. public company’s shares for more than three years would be 
9:235:17949:28:15:72:537:101:144:Times:144:Times:eligible to nominate candidates for up to 25% of the company’s board seats.   The new Rule 14a-

9:237:18092:8:0:72:189:78:42:Times:100:Times:10 953 A.2d 227 (Del. 2008). 
10:238:18123:0:27:71:524:708:144:Times:144:Times:11 was planned to go in to effect on November 15, 2010, well in time for the April/May 2011 
10:239:18215:27:28:71:149:681:144:Times:144:Times:proxy season.11 
10:240:18230:28:27:108:537:653:144:Times:144:Times:On September 29, the Business Roundtable, along with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 
10:241:18313:27:28:72:541:626:144:Times:144:Times:filed a complaint in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, alleging that the SEC’s proxy access rules 
10:242:18412:28:28:72:500:598:144:Times:144:Times:were unlawful under U.S. securities laws and “arbitrary and capricious.”12  The Business 
10:243:18501:28:27:72:525:570:144:Times:144:Times:Roundtable complaint also asserted – but did not explain – that the SEC’s proxy rules “do not 
10:244:18595:27:28:72:488:543:144:Times:144:Times:promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation.”13  The complaint was widely-
10:245:18680:28:27:72:514:515:144:Times:144:Times:anticipated by the marketplace based on public statements, including in the comment letters 
10:246:18772:27:28:72:492:488:144:Times:144:Times:submitted by these two groups to the SEC on the proxy access proposal.  Nevertheless, 
10:247:18858:28:28:72:510:460:144:Times:144:Times:Congress’s authorization to the SEC under Section 971 of the Dodd-Frank was intended to 
10:248:18946:28:27:72:488:432:144:Times:144:Times:largely shut down this kind of challenge; perhaps as a result, the filing of the Business 
10:249:19036:27:28:72:385:405:144:Times:144:Times:Roundtable complaint did not attract significant media attention. 
10:250:19102:28:27:108:477:377:144:Times:144:Times:However, on October 4, the SEC unexpectedly announced that it would stay 
10:251:19175:27:28:72:531:350:144:Times:144:Times:implementation of Rule 14a-11, pending resolution of the Business Roundtable litigation in the 
10:252:19270:28:27:72:527:322:144:Times:144:Times:D.C. Circuit.  The SEC explained: “Among other things, a stay avoids potentially unnecessary 
10:253:19363:27:28:72:499:295:144:Times:144:Times:costs, regulatory uncertainty, and disruption that could occur if the rules were to become 
10:254:19454:28:89:72:528:267:144:Times:144:Times:effective during the pendency of a challenge to their validity.”14  News accounts noted that the 
10:255:19551:89:8:216:219:178:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
10:256:19599:8:16:72:536:170:42:Times:100:Times:11 The three year rule excluded many investors with shorter holding periods. However, the rule would have allowed 
10:257:19713:16:11:72:533:154:100:Times:100:Times:investors with two year holdings, for example, to qualify relatively soon. Cella (2011) shows that activist investors 
10:258:19831:11:7:72:311:143:100:Times:100:Times:have longer holding periods than other investors in the US. 
10:259:19891:7:16:72:505:136:42:Times:100:Times:12 For ease of exposition we refer to this litigation as the “Business Roundtable complaint” or the “Business 
10:260:20001:16:7:72:214:120:100:Times:100:Times:Roundtable challenge” hereinafter.

11:265:20382:0:27:71:537:708:144:Times:144:Times:SEC’s announcement was a surprise.15  Commentators also noted that the SEC’s stay meant that 
11:266:20475:27:28:72:425:681:144:Times:144:Times:proxy access rules would not go into effect for the 2011 proxy season.16   
11:267:20550:28:27:108:530:653:144:Times:144:Times:On July 22, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit struck down Rule 14a-
11:268:20636:27:28:72:479:626:144:Times:144:Times:11 under the Administrative Procedure Act.  The D.C. Circuit accepted the Business 
11:269:20719:28:28:72:523:598:144:Times:144:Times:Roundtable’s argument that the SEC’s process in considering and adopting the new Rule was 
11:270:20809:28:27:72:266:570:144:Times:144:Times:insufficiently deliberate and rational.17   
11:271:20853:27:28:107:541:543:144:Times:144:Times:In September 2011, the SEC announced that it would not appeal the D.C. Circuit’s ruling, 
11:272:20942:28:27:72:527:515:144:Times:144:Times:but instead would re-instate its amendments to Rule 14a-8, which would allow shareholders to 
11:273:21035:27:28:72:524:488:144:Times:144:Times:vote on a resolution recommending or requiring the inclusion of shareholder-sponsored board 
11:274:21127:28:28:72:506:460:144:Times:144:Times:candidaets in the next year’s corporate proxy statement.  The SEC thus moved away from 
11:275:21214:28:27:72:521:432:144:Times:144:Times:comprehensive proxy access to a two-step, company-by-company approach.  Shareholders at 
11:276:21302:27:28:72:535:405:144:Times:144:Times:several major companies, including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Hewlett-Packard, Sprint 
11:277:21393:28:27:72:532:377:144:Times:144:Times:Nextel, and Wells Fargo, have proposed proxy access resolutions for the 2012 proxy season.18

11:281:21588:28:28:72:516:267:144:Times:144:Times:modern capitalism (see Berle and Means 1932), and one that raises the possibility of agency

11:283:21774:27:28:72:519:212:144:Times:144:Times:has been difficult because of econometric identification challenges.  Hermalin and Weisbach

12:292:22501:0:27:71:473:708:144:Times:144:Times:correlations between board characteristics and firm performance may be that board 
12:293:22583:27:28:71:530:681:144:Times:144:Times:characteristics are endogenous, i.e. across firms, board characteristics are likely not assigned at 
12:294:22683:28:27:71:524:653:144:Times:144:Times:random.  This makes the effect of any board characteristic (e.g., the presence of outsiders, the 
12:295:22780:27:28:71:533:626:144:Times:144:Times:number of directors) impossible to identify based only on the observed correlation between that 
12:296:22876:28:28:71:252:598:144:Times:144:Times:characteristic and firm performance.  
12:297:22914:28:27:107:506:570:144:Times:144:Times:Shareholder access to the company’s proxy statement is one specific dimension of 
12:298:22995:27:28:71:538:543:144:Times:144:Times:corporate governance that has been heavily debated over the years.  As an illustration, more than 
12:299:23093:28:27:71:523:515:144:Times:144:Times:700 different comment letters were submitted to the SEC when proxy access was proposed in 
12:300:23183:27:28:71:512:488:144:Times:144:Times:2003; more than 200 different comment letters were submitted during the 2007 rulemaking 
12:301:23271:28:28:71:523:460:144:Times:144:Times:process; and more than 500 different comment letters were submitted when proxy access was 
12:302:23361:28:27:71:525:432:144:Times:144:Times:proposed again in 2009.  Proponents of shareholder access (e.g., Bebchuk 2003, Bebchuk and 
12:303:23452:27:28:71:518:405:144:Times:144:Times:Hirst 2010) point out that proxy contests under the existing regime are exceedingly rare, and 
12:304:23546:28:27:71:500:377:144:Times:144:Times:argue that a meaningful director election process would improve corporate governance.   
12:305:23634:27:28:71:518:350:144:Times:144:Times:Opponents of shareholder access argue that shareholders already have sufficient voice in the 
12:306:23727:28:27:71:534:322:144:Times:144:Times:election of directors (e.g., Bainbridge 2010), that shareholder access rules would likely shift too 
12:307:23827:27:28:71:499:295:144:Times:144:Times:much power to shareholders or shareholders with specific agendas, and that high-quality 
12:308:23915:28:28:71:533:267:144:Times:144:Times:directors may be less willing to serve on boards if they must face competition from shareholder-
12:309:24011:28:27:71:532:239:144:Times:144:Times:sponsored candidates (e.g., Lipton and Rosenblum 2003).19  A third set of commentators object 
12:310:24105:27:28:71:512:212:144:Times:144:Times:to the “one-size-fits-all” approach of mandatory shareholder access (e.g., Grundfest 2009).  
12:311:24198:28:27:71:540:184:144:Times:144:Times:These commentators propose that shareholders should be able to opt-in, or at least opt-out, of the 
12:312:24297:27:48:71:205:157:144:Times:144:Times:SEC’s proxy access rules.   
12:313:24325:48:8:216:219:109:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
12:314:24373:8:16:72:526:101:42:Times:100:Times:19 This argument is related to the idea proposed by Burkart, Gromb and Panunzi (1997) that closer oversight may 
12:315:24485:16:11:72:528:85:100:Times:100:Times:weaken managerial incentives. Adams and Ferreira (2007) argue that management-friendly boards are sometimes 
12:316:24593:11:0:72:535:74:100:Times:100:Times:optimal because they pose a weaker monitoring threat, which enables them to solicit more information from CEOs. 
13:317:24708:0:27:107:539:708:144:Times:144:Times:A recent theory paper by Harris and Raviv (2010) addresses the optimal extent of control 
13:318:24797:27:28:71:487:681:144:Times:144:Times:to place in the hands of shareholders versus managers.  Their model includes strategic 
13:319:24884:28:27:71:500:653:144:Times:144:Times:communication between self-interested and potentially privately informed managers and 
13:320:24970:27:28:71:501:626:144:Times:144:Times:shareholders as well as delegation.  Harris and Raviv find that when shareholders seek to 
13:321:25060:28:28:71:525:598:144:Times:144:Times:maximize firm value and are not misinformed, it is optimal to place the delegation decision in 
13:322:25155:28:27:71:489:570:144:Times:144:Times:the hands of shareholders, allowing them to decide ex ante which decisions to leave to 
13:323:25242:27:28:71:484:543:144:Times:144:Times:management and which to make directly.  Owners will then delegate decisions where 
13:324:25324:28:27:71:541:515:144:Times:144:Times:management’s information advantage outweighs its agency costs to managers.  The authors view 
13:325:25417:27:28:71:530:488:144:Times:144:Times:this result as being consistent with Bebchuk’s (2005) recommendation to allow shareholders to 
13:326:25511:28:28:71:457:460:144:Times:144:Times:set the “rules of the game” regarding decision power and corporate governance. 
13:327:25590:28:27:107:536:432:144:Times:144:Times:A recent paper by Kahan and Rock (2011) argues that proxy access would be unlikely to 
13:328:25676:27:28:71:540:405:144:Times:144:Times:yield a significant number of shareholder-nominated candidates, and would be unlikely to have a 
13:329:25772:28:27:71:508:377:144:Times:144:Times:meaningful effect on corporate governance more generally.  Drawing inferences from past 
13:330:25860:27:28:71:516:350:144:Times:144:Times:behavior, the authors argue that neither mutual funds nor private pension funds would make 
13:331:25951:28:27:71:476:322:144:Times:144:Times:significant use of shareholder access.  Large public pension funds “may make some 
13:332:26033:27:28:71:520:295:144:Times:144:Times:nominations,” but hedge funds and union-affiliated funds, which historically have been more 
13:333:26125:28:28:71:523:267:144:Times:144:Times:activist, would generally not satisfy the ownership and holding period requirements under the 
13:334:26219:28:27:71:514:239:144:Times:144:Times:Rule.  In addition, Kahan and Rock argue that the proxy access rule would not substantially 
13:335:26311:27:28:71:536:212:144:Times:144:Times:lower the costs of running a short slate contest, and that, in some respects, the costs of running a 
13:336:26412:28:27:71:538:184:144:Times:144:Times:candidate using the company’s proxy statement would be greater than running a candidate in the 
13:337:26507:27:28:71:165:157:144:Times:144:Times:traditional manner. 
13:338:26527:28:28:107:508:129:144:Times:144:Times:While we agree with Kahan and Rock that the number of actual candidates under a 
13:339:26607:28:0:71:519:101:144:Times:144:Times:shareholder access regime may very well be small, we believe that Kahan and Rock give too 
14:340:26700:0:27:71:513:708:144:Times:144:Times:little weight to the potential for more meaningful “constructive engagement” between large 
14:341:26791:27:28:71:532:681:144:Times:144:Times:shareholders and the company under a proxy access regime, when the “stick” of a proxy access 
14:342:26884:28:27:71:496:653:144:Times:144:Times:candidate is lurking in the background.  Moreover, Kahan and Rock’s predictions about 
14:343:26970:27:28:71:537:626:144:Times:144:Times:shareholders’ willingness to use proxy access are based on past behavior, and do not account for 
14:344:27067:28:28:71:530:598:144:Times:144:Times:the possibility that shareholder behavior would change in response to a new regime.20  Leaving 
14:345:27162:28:27:72:532:570:144:Times:144:Times:aside the hypothetical future role of proxy access, our study focuses on a set of investors with a 
14:346:27261:27:28:72:523:543:144:Times:144:Times:track record of activism (i.e., we study the value changes for firms held by such investors). In 
14:347:27358:28:27:72:538:515:144:Times:144:Times:any event, we agree with Kahan and Rock that proxy access would have both costs and benefits; 
14:348:27452:27:28:71:530:488:144:Times:144:Times:the question then becomes how best to predict whether the benefits outweigh the costs, and the 
14:349:27547:28:28:72:249:460:144:Times:144:Times:magnitude of the net benefits if any. 
14:350:27585:28:27:108:503:432:144:Times:144:Times:The idea of empirically evaluating regulatory changes with stock market data was 
14:351:27666:27:28:72:514:405:144:Times:144:Times:introduced by Schwert (1981).21 Two prior studies and one contemporaneous study use this 
14:352:27755:28:27:72:503:377:144:Times:144:Times:methodology to examine the wealth effects of shareholder proxy access.  Akyol, Lim and 
14:353:27842:27:28:72:530:350:144:Times:144:Times:Verwijmeren (2010) examines 14 events between September 2006 and December 2009 that, in 
14:354:27930:28:29:72:527:322:144:Times:144:Times:their interpretation, increased22 or decreased23 the likelihood of shareholder proxy access.  For 
14:355:28028:29:8:216:219:293:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
14:356:28076:8:16:72:540:285:42:Times:100:Times:20 In a recent presentation of this paper at NYU alongside Kahan and Rock, one of us observed that Kahan & Rock’s 
14:357:28190:16:11:72:513:269:100:Times:100:Times:approach to proxy access could similarly be used to predict that texting is unlikely to be a significant mode of 
14:358:28303:11:12:72:539:258:100:Times:100:Times:communication: texting is just slightly less costly than e-mail (e.g., no need for a header, as is the convention with e-
14:359:28424:12:11:72:542:246:100:Times:100:Times:mail), and in some ways texting is more costly than e-mail (e.g., you need to know the phone number rather than just 
14:360:28541:11:12:72:535:235:100:Times:100:Times:the e-mail address).   Of course, this prediction would be highly inaccurate because behavior has in fact changed in 
14:361:28658:12:11:72:529:223:100:Times:100:Times:response to the new technology, at least in part because text messages go to a space (the phone number) that is far 
14:362:28774:11:12:72:516:212:100:Times:100:Times:more sacrosanct than the e-mail in box.  The analogy to proxy access should be apparent: a simple cost/benefit 
14:363:28885:12:11:72:528:200:100:Times:100:Times:analysis ignores the possibility for behavior change due to the fact that a proxy access candidate goes to a “sacred 
14:364:29002:11:7:71:293:189:100:Times:100:Times:space,” namely, the company’s own proxy statement.   
14:365:29055:7:12:72:395:182:42:Times:100:Times:21 See Hochberg, Sapienza and Vissing-Jorgensen (2009) for a recent example.   
14:366:29134:12:16:72:519:170:42:Times:100:Times:22 The nine events that, according to the authors, increased the likelihood of shareholder proxy access were: the 
14:367:29248:16:11:72:530:154:100:Times:100:Times:Second Circuit’s holding in AFSCME v. CA (Sept. 5, 2006), the SEC announcement of a roundtable discussion on 
14:368:29357:11:12:72:538:143:100:Times:100:Times:proxy access (April 24, 2007), the SEC’s disclosure of a proposed rule on proxy access (July 27, 2007), a speech by 
14:369:29473:12:11:72:542:131:100:Times:100:Times:SEC Commissioner Elisse Walter on proxy access (Feb. 18, 2009), a speech by SEC Chairwoman Mary Schapiro on 
14:370:29581:11:12:72:526:120:100:Times:100:Times:proxy access (April 6, 2009), the SEC’s announcement that it would vote on a proposed rule (May 12, 2009), the 
14:371:29692:12:11:72:541:108:100:Times:100:Times:SEC’s announcement of the content of the proposed rule (May 14, 2009), the introduction of the Schumer Bill in the 
14:372:29807:11:7:72:518:97:100:Times:100:Times:U.S. Senate (May 19, 2009), and the SEC’s vote in favor of the proposed rule on proxy access (May 20, 2009). 
14:373:29916:7:16:72:519:90:42:Times:100:Times:23 The five events that, according to the authors, decreased the likelihood of shareholder proxy access were: the 
14:374:30030:16:0:72:522:74:100:Times:100:Times:SEC’s publication of a final Rule 14a-8 with no substantial changes (Nov. 28, 2007), the SEC’s publication of a 
15:375:30145:0:27:71:516:708:144:Times:144:Times:each event date, they compare the return of a portfolio of U.S. firms to the return of a global 
15:376:30241:27:28:71:525:681:144:Times:144:Times:market portfolio (excluding U.S. firms) and to a Canadian market portfolio.  They also isolate 
15:377:30336:28:27:71:513:653:144:Times:144:Times:U.S. financial firms from other U.S. firms, on the theory that financial firms might be more 
15:378:30429:27:28:71:509:626:144:Times:144:Times:likely to be targeted by shareholders for proxy access.  Six of the events taken individually 
15:379:30523:28:28:71:523:598:144:Times:144:Times:produce statistically significant abnormal returns around the event dates (at 95% confidence), 
15:380:30618:28:27:71:522:570:144:Times:144:Times:and when the events are aggregated the returns are highly significant and inversely correlated 
15:381:30713:27:28:71:515:543:144:Times:144:Times:with shareholder proxy access.  Specifically, the authors find that an increased likelihood of

15:383:30906:27:28:71:491:488:144:Times:144:Times:for U.S. financial firms relative to non-financial U.S. firms.  The authors conclude that 
15:384:30996:28:28:71:529:460:144:Times:144:Times:“increasing shareholder rights . . . may actually be detrimental to shareholder wealth,” and that 
15:385:31094:28:27:71:513:432:144:Times:144:Times:the results “highlight the need for the SEC to further deliberate on the proposed rule, and to 
15:386:31189:27:28:71:320:405:144:Times:144:Times:consider not implementing the proposed changes.”  
15:387:31239:28:27:107:539:377:144:Times:144:Times:Larcker, Ormazabal, and Taylor (2010) similarly use an event study approach to examine 
15:388:31326:27:28:71:533:350:144:Times:144:Times:thirteen events between March 2007 and June 2009 that arguably increased24 or decreased25 the 
15:389:31420:28:27:72:528:322:144:Times:144:Times:likelihood of shareholder proxy access.  The authors use the number of institutions with 1% or 
15:390:31515:27:25:72:532:295:144:Times:144:Times:more ownership (NLargeBlock) and the number of possible coalitions that would control 1% or

15:392:31763:12:12:72:531:258:100:Times:100:Times:final Rule 14a-8(i)(8) with no substantial changes (Dec. 12, 2007), the introduction of an opt-in shareholder proxy

15:394:31996:11:12:72:536:235:100:Times:100:Times:(March 18, 2009), the passage of the bill in the Delaware Senate (April 8, 2009), and the reopening of the comment 
15:395:32111:12:7:72:365:223:100:Times:100:Times:period on the SEC proposed Rule on shareholder access (Dec. 14, 2009). 
15:396:32182:7:16:72:518:216:42:Times:100:Times:24 The eight events that, according to the authors, increased the likelihood of shareholder proxy access are: first 
15:397:32298:16:11:72:537:200:100:Times:100:Times:mention of the Schumer Bill in the press (April 25, 2009), introduction of the Schumer Bill in the U.S. Senate (May 
15:398:32414:11:12:72:538:189:100:Times:100:Times:19, 2009), first mention of the Shareholder Empowerment Act in the press (June 12, 2009),  the SEC announcement 
15:399:32526:12:11:72:532:177:100:Times:100:Times:of a roundtable discussion on proxy access (April 24, 2007), the SEC announcement of amendments to Rule 14a-8 
15:400:32636:11:12:71:541:166:100:Times:100:Times:14a-8(i)(8) (July 27, 2007), first mention of potential amendments to Rule 14a-11 (April 6, 2009),  the SEC’s vote in 
15:401:32754:12:11:71:539:154:100:Times:100:Times:favor of the proposed rule on proxy access (May 20, 2009), and the publication of the SEC’s draft proposal for Rule 
15:402:32870:11:7:71:169:143:100:Times:100:Times:14a-11 (June 10, 2009). 
15:403:32894:7:16:72:540:136:42:Times:100:Times:25 The five events that, according to the authors, decreased the likelihood of shareholder proxy access are: the SEC’s 
15:404:33013:16:12:72:536:120:100:Times:100:Times:publication of a final Rule 14a-8 with no substantial changes (Nov. 28, 2007), the SEC’s publication of a final Rule 
15:405:33130:12:11:72:538:108:100:Times:100:Times:14a-8(i)(8) with no substantial changes (Dec. 6, 2007), the introduction of an opt-in shareholder proxy access bill in 
15:406:33249:11:12:71:526:97:100:Times:100:Times:the Delaware House of Representatives (Mar. 10, 2009), the passage of this bill in the Delaware House (Mar. 18, 
15:407:33361:12:11:71:530:85:100:Times:100:Times:2009), the passage of the bill in the Delaware Senate (April 8, 2009), and the reopening of the comment period on 
15:408:33475:11:0:71:325:74:100:Times:100:Times:the SEC proposed Rule on shareholder access (Dec. 14, 2009). 
16:409:33539:0:27:71:517:708:144:Times:144:Times:more of the shares outstanding (NSmallCoalitions) as proxies for a company’s exposure to a 
16:410:33630:27:28:71:503:681:144:Times:144:Times:shareholder access rule.  For five out of the thirteen events, the authors find a statistically 
16:411:33726:28:27:71:509:653:144:Times:144:Times:significant (at 95% confidence) negative correlation between NLargeBlock and events that 
16:412:33815:27:28:71:516:626:144:Times:144:Times:increased the likelihood of shareholder proxy access.  For a (somewhat different) five out of 
16:413:33909:28:28:71:487:598:144:Times:144:Times:thirteen events, the authors find a statistically significant negative correlation between 
16:414:34000:28:27:71:527:570:144:Times:144:Times:NSmallCoalitions and events that increased the likelihood of proxy access.  As with the Akyol 
16:415:34094:27:28:71:525:543:144:Times:144:Times:study, the coefficients for both NLargeBlock and NSmallCoalitions become highly significant 
16:416:34186:28:27:71:537:515:144:Times:144:Times:and inversely correlated with increased likelihood of shareholder access when all thirteen events 
16:417:34284:27:28:71:509:488:144:Times:144:Times:are pooled.  The authors conclude that their findings are consistent with the view that >1% 
16:418:34376:28:28:71:532:460:144:Times:144:Times:shareholders “will use the privileges afforded to them by proxy access regulation to manipulate 
16:419:34472:28:27:71:518:432:144:Times:144:Times:the governance process to make themselves better off at the expense of other shareholders.”  
16:420:34565:27:28:71:529:405:144:Times:144:Times:Larcker and Tayan (2010) summarize this literature as suggesting that “regulation of corporate 
16:421:34660:28:27:71:321:377:144:Times:144:Times:governance is viewed negatively by shareholders.”  
16:422:34711:27:28:107:539:350:144:Times:144:Times:One problem inherent in these prior event studies is that at least some of the events being 
16:423:34803:28:27:71:515:322:144:Times:144:Times:studied are of questionable importance.  For example, both the Akyol study and the Larcker 
16:424:34894:27:28:71:531:295:144:Times:144:Times:study identify the announcement of a SEC roundtable discussion series on April 24, 2007 as an 
16:425:34988:28:28:71:514:267:144:Times:144:Times:event that increased the likelihood of proxy access.  With the SEC having considered proxy 
16:426:35079:28:27:71:523:239:144:Times:144:Times:access off-and-on for most of the prior decade (and having already promised to take up proxy 
16:427:35172:27:28:71:515:212:144:Times:144:Times:access after the AFSCME decision the prior year), it is not clear why the announcement of a 
16:428:35264:28:27:71:541:184:144:Times:144:Times:roundtable discussion – with, of course, no prediction on what conclusions the discussants would 
16:429:35361:27:28:71:504:157:144:Times:144:Times:reach – should convey meaningful information to the marketplace, much less increase the 
16:430:35449:28:0:71:206:129:144:Times:144:Times:likelihood of proxy access.  
17:431:35481:0:27:107:536:708:144:Times:144:Times:In fact, the impact of the April 24 announcement on the likelihood of proxy access is not 
17:432:35571:27:28:71:515:681:144:Times:144:Times:even directionally clear.  At the time of the announcement, the AFSCME decision permitted 
17:433:35661:28:27:71:533:653:144:Times:144:Times:proxy access on a company-by-company basis.  In the press release announcing the Roundtable 
17:434:35753:27:28:71:505:626:144:Times:144:Times:series, SEC Chairman Christopher Cox noted generally: “This roundtable will explore the 
17:435:35841:28:28:71:536:598:144:Times:144:Times:relationship between the federal proxy rules and state corporation law, and pose questions to the 
17:436:35939:28:27:71:531:570:144:Times:144:Times:participants about whether this relationship can be improved.”26  After the Roundtable, the first 
17:437:36037:27:28:72:483:543:144:Times:144:Times:move from the SEC, proposed in October 2007 and finalized in December 2007, was 
17:438:36117:28:27:72:513:515:144:Times:144:Times:amendments to Rule 14a-8(i)(8) that overruled the AFSCME decision and eliminated proxy 
17:439:36204:27:28:72:499:488:144:Times:144:Times:access.  To the extent that investors interpreted Cox’s general statement to mean that the 
17:440:36295:28:28:72:486:460:144:Times:144:Times:AFSCME decision was vulnerable (which, in retrospect, would have been an accurate 
17:441:36377:28:27:72:529:432:144:Times:144:Times:interpretation) the April 24 announcement should have decreased the likelihood of shareholder 
17:442:36471:27:28:72:424:405:144:Times:144:Times:access, rather than increased it as the Akyrol and Larcker studies predict. 
17:443:36547:28:27:108:511:377:144:Times:144:Times:A second potential problem with the Akyrol and Larcker studies is that many of the 
17:444:36630:27:28:72:522:350:144:Times:144:Times:events were predicted in advance, at least in part, by the marketplace.  For example, it is well-
17:445:36727:28:27:72:508:322:144:Times:144:Times:known that the Corporate Law Section of the Delaware Bar Association, not the Delaware 
17:446:36814:27:28:72:539:295:144:Times:144:Times:legislature, creates Delaware corporate law.  Once the Corporate Law Section voted in favor of a 
17:447:36911:28:28:72:527:267:144:Times:144:Times:shareholder access amendment on February 26, 2009, its implementation in Delaware became 
17:448:37000:28:27:72:505:239:144:Times:144:Times:virtually a foregone conclusion.  Both the Akyol study and the Larcker study examine the 
17:449:37089:27:28:72:537:212:144:Times:144:Times:introduction of the shareholder access bill in the Delaware House of Representatives (March 10, 
17:450:37185:28:27:71:495:184:144:Times:144:Times:2009), the passage of the bill in the House (March 18), and the passage of the bill in the 
17:451:37276:27:28:71:518:157:144:Times:144:Times:Delaware Senate (April 8), but fail to examine the recommendation from the Corporate Law 
17:452:37365:28:28:71:530:129:144:Times:144:Times:Council that occurred on February 26.  Similarly, the promulgation of the final Rule on August 
17:453:37460:28:15:71:537:101:144:Times:144:Times:25, 2010 was very accurately predicted in press reports ahead of its actual announcement.  If the

17:455:37606:8:0:72:479:78:42:Times:100:Times:26 SEC Announces Roundtable Discussions Regarding Proxy Access, Press Release (April 24, 2007). 
18:456:37705:0:27:71:493:708:144:Times:144:Times:marketplace fully anticipates an event, then wealth effects around the event date can be 
18:457:37794:27:28:71:136:681:144:Times:144:Times:meaningless. 
18:458:37807:28:27:107:541:653:144:Times:144:Times:Despite these deficiencies, the Akyol and Larcker studies have led some commentators to 
18:459:37895:27:28:71:520:626:144:Times:144:Times:conclude that shareholder proxy access reduces shareholder wealth.  For example, Grundfest 
18:460:37986:28:28:71:458:598:144:Times:144:Times:(2010) summarizes the “consistent conclusion” from the two studies as follows: 
18:461:38065:28:13:107:491:570:144:Times:144:Times: [P]roxy access, as currently proposed by the Commission, reduces shareholder 
18:462:38143:13:14:107:488:557:144:Times:144:Times:wealth, and, even if preferred by vocal institutional investors, is inimical to the 
18:463:38227:14:14:107:485:543:144:Times:144:Times:best interests of the shareholder community as a whole. . . . The best currently 
18:464:38308:14:14:107:496:529:144:Times:144:Times:available empirical data indicate that, given a choice between the current regime 
18:465:38390:14:14:107:477:515:144:Times:144:Times:and the Commission’s proxy access rules, shareholders seeking to maximize 
18:466:38464:14:13:107:496:501:144:Times:144:Times:returns would prefer the status quo because the proposed rules appear to destroy 
18:467:38545:13:14:107:204:488:144:Times:144:Times:shareholder wealth. 
18:468:38565:14:14:107:110:474:144:Times:144:Times: 
18:469:38565:14:14:107:110:460:144:Times:144:Times: 
18:470:38565:14:27:107:518:446:144:Times:144:Times:It should also be noted that both the Akyol and Larcker studies were submitted to the 
18:471:38651:27:28:71:529:419:144:Times:144:Times:SEC as comment letters during the rulemaking process, and were referenced by the SEC in the 
18:472:38743:28:28:71:538:391:144:Times:144:Times:final Rule.  We find the reliance on these prior event studies to be troubling because many of the 
18:473:38842:28:27:71:524:363:144:Times:144:Times:events were widely-anticipated, confounded, directionally unclear, and/or not meaningful, for 
18:474:38936:27:28:71:475:336:144:Times:144:Times:reasons described above. 27  In contrast, we study a main event that in our view was 
18:475:39021:28:27:72:526:308:144:Times:144:Times:unanticipated, unconfounded, directionally clear, and highly meaningful with respect to proxy 
18:476:39115:27:28:72:523:281:144:Times:144:Times:access. Our second event, the Supreme Court ruling in 2011, was predictable but of unknown 
18:477:39206:28:27:72:253:253:144:Times:144:Times:direction and also directionally clear. 
18:478:39246:27:28:108:490:226:144:Times:144:Times:Cohn, Gillan, and Hartzell (2010) also study proxy access using an event study 
18:479:39325:28:28:72:519:198:144:Times:144:Times:methodology, focusing on firms with activist investors (but using a classification scheme for 
18:480:39419:28:27:72:541:170:144:Times:144:Times:investors that differs from ours). They use three event dates, all more recent than the Larcker and 
18:481:39519:27:7:216:219:143:144:Times:144:Times:

18:483:39668:16:12:72:519:120:100:Times:100:Times:(“What is remarkable about these arguments is the lack of empirical evidence about the actual effect that proxy 
18:484:39780:12:11:72:518:108:100:Times:100:Times:access would have on the value of public corporations. That is, there is no scientific evidence either way on the 
18:485:39894:11:12:71:507:97:100:Times:100:Times:impact that shareholder proxy access will have on the stock prices of public corporations. Will it make these 
18:486:40004:12:11:71:517:85:100:Times:100:Times:companies more or less valuable? Behind this question is whether proxy access has positive or negative worth. 
18:487:40114:11:0:71:485:74:100:Times:100:Times:Until this month, there have only been two empirical studies even purporting to look at these issues.”). 
19:488:40221:0:27:71:535:708:144:Times:144:Times:Akyol studies: a refinement of the proxy access rule that clarified the position size requirements 
19:489:40320:27:28:71:538:681:144:Times:144:Times:for proxy access (June 16-17, 2010); an additional refinement that led to the dropping of the five 
19:490:40419:28:27:71:531:653:144:Times:144:Times:percent threshold from the Dodd-Frank bill (June 24-25, 2010); and the ultimate passage of the 
19:491:40514:27:28:71:534:626:144:Times:144:Times:proxy access rule (August 25, 2010).  Cohn et al. argue that the 5% size requirement introduced 
19:492:40610:28:28:71:533:598:144:Times:144:Times:on June 16/17 was a higher threshold than expected in the marketplace, and therefore should be 
19:493:40705:28:27:71:519:570:144:Times:144:Times:interpreted as a negative event for proxy access.  When this 5% requirement was dropped on 
19:494:40796:27:28:71:521:543:144:Times:144:Times:June 24/25 this was, in turn, a positive event for proxy access.  On August 25, when the final 
19:495:40891:28:27:71:535:515:144:Times:144:Times:Rule was announced, Cohn et al. argue that the surprise event was the three-year holding period 
19:496:40987:27:28:71:536:488:144:Times:144:Times:rather than two years expected by the marketplace; therefore this was a negative event for proxy 
19:497:41084:28:28:71:526:460:144:Times:144:Times:access.   The authors find a positive correlation between proxy access and shareholder wealth, 
19:498:41179:28:27:71:530:432:144:Times:144:Times:i.e., the two negative events reduced value for companies most vulnerable to proxy access, and 
19:499:41274:27:28:71:522:405:144:Times:144:Times:the one positive event increased value for companies most vulnerable to proxy access.  These 
19:500:41367:28:27:71:516:377:144:Times:144:Times:findings stand in contrast to the findings from the Akyol and Larcker studies.The Cohn et al 
19:501:41460:27:28:71:523:350:144:Times:144:Times:paper is similar to this study in that it examines the differential return between firms with and 
19:502:41558:28:27:71:538:322:144:Times:144:Times:without activist owners. We use different event dates, and sources of the set of activists. Like us, 
19:503:41659:27:28:71:533:295:144:Times:144:Times:Cohn et al conclude that proxy access appears to have been ascribed positive value by the stock 
19:504:41755:28:28:71:110:267:144:Times:144:Times:market.

19:506:41763:27:28:71:184:212:144:Times:144:Times:3. Empirical Strategy 
19:507:41784:28:27:108:497:184:144:Times:144:Times:The unexpected delay that occurred on October 4, 2010 provides the basis for an 
19:508:41864:27:28:72:528:157:144:Times:144:Times:empirical test of the wealth effects of shareholder access. We apply the idea of Schwert (1981) 
19:509:41960:28:0:72:515:129:144:Times:144:Times:that stock price changes following the announcement can be informative about the market’s 
20:510:42053:0:27:71:538:708:144:Times:144:Times:evaluation of the impact of regulation on value.   While our focus is on October 4, 2010, we also 
20:511:42151:27:28:71:418:681:144:Times:144:Times:examine July 22, 2011, when the D.C. Circuit invalidated proxy access. 
20:512:42222:28:27:107:538:653:144:Times:144:Times:For an event to be useful as a natural experiment, there are several requirements.  First, it 
20:513:42316:27:28:71:505:626:144:Times:144:Times:has to be unexpected. By all accounts, the SEC’s delay was unexpected, and therefore not 
20:514:42405:28:28:71:525:598:144:Times:144:Times:predicted in advance by the marketplace. Second, the value impact has to affect stock prices – 
20:515:42500:28:27:71:537:570:144:Times:144:Times:that is, it must be a relatively significant event.  The degree of debate and press coverage around 
20:516:42600:27:28:71:533:543:144:Times:144:Times:shareholder proxy access suggests that implementation of the Rule was a significant event, and, 
20:517:42696:28:27:71:506:515:144:Times:144:Times:by extension, the delay of the rule was also significant.  The fact that the SEC had already 
20:518:42789:27:28:71:532:488:144:Times:144:Times:implemented shareholder access means that a specific Rule was on the table, and all companies 
20:519:42883:28:28:71:527:460:144:Times:144:Times:reacted to the same Rule.  Finally, evading the proposed regulatory reform must be difficult or 
20:520:42979:28:27:71:514:432:144:Times:144:Times:impossible.  Rule 14a-11 is a mandatory rule, with no prospect for opt-out.  For this reason, 
20:521:43073:27:28:71:535:405:144:Times:144:Times:market prices before October 4 likely did not reflect any possibility that companies might evade 
20:522:43170:28:27:71:117:377:144:Times:144:Times:the Rule. 
20:523:43180:27:28:107:527:350:144:Times:144:Times:If the marketplace perceived that shareholder access would increase shareholder value, 
20:524:43267:28:27:71:519:322:144:Times:144:Times:then companies that would have been most exposed to the new Rule should decline in value, 
20:525:43357:27:28:71:522:295:144:Times:144:Times:relative to companies that would have been more insulated from the Rule.  If the marketplace 
20:526:43450:28:28:71:535:267:144:Times:144:Times:perceived that shareholder access would decrease shareholder value, then companies that would 
20:527:43544:28:27:71:528:239:144:Times:144:Times:have been most exposed to the Rule should increase in value, relative to those that would have 
20:528:43639:27:28:71:528:212:144:Times:144:Times:been more insulated.  Furthermore, we can use the event to test if the perceived value effect of 
20:529:43736:28:27:71:506:184:144:Times:144:Times:shareholder access depends on the features of a firm or its shareholders.  For example, the 
20:530:43828:27:28:71:540:157:144:Times:144:Times:possibility of board representation may be more valuable when shareholders are sophisticated, or 
20:531:43925:28:28:71:541:129:144:Times:144:Times:if they are more willing to get involved with the governance of a firm.  Board representation may 
20:532:44023:28:0:71:471:101:144:Times:144:Times:be less valuable if the board already represents the views of outside investors well. 
21:533:44112:0:27:107:539:708:144:Times:144:Times:We use several proxies for determining which companies were more and less likely to be 
21:534:44199:27:28:71:490:681:144:Times:144:Times:affected by the SEC’s proxy access Rule.  First, and most importantly, we examine the 
21:535:44285:28:27:71:512:653:144:Times:144:Times:institutional ownership of the companies in our sample, on the assumption that institutions, 
21:536:44378:27:28:71:525:626:144:Times:144:Times:particularly institutions that held 3% or more of the company’s stock, would be most likely to 
21:537:44473:28:28:71:540:598:144:Times:144:Times:make use of proxy access.  We also distinguish between activist institutions such as hedge funds, 
21:538:44571:28:27:71:522:570:144:Times:144:Times:and traditionally passive institutions such as index funds, on the view that activist institutions 
21:539:44670:27:28:71:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:would be more likely to make use of proxy access. Many institutions are reluctant to exercise 
21:540:44764:28:27:71:505:515:144:Times:144:Times:control rights and participate in activism (Pozen 2003, Kahan and Rock 2011).  Examples 
21:541:44852:27:28:71:526:488:144:Times:144:Times:include index funds and some pension funds (see e.g. Del Guercio and Hawkins 1999).  Other 
21:542:44943:28:28:71:532:460:144:Times:144:Times:institutions are much more prone to activism and direct influence on corporate governance. For 
21:543:45038:28:27:71:533:432:144:Times:144:Times:example, Kahan and Rock (2006) argue that hedge funds have stronger financial incentives and 
21:544:45131:27:28:71:541:405:144:Times:144:Times:fewer regulatory constraints than mutual funds, and may therefore be better able to monitor firms 
21:545:45229:28:27:71:542:377:144:Times:144:Times:in their portfolios. Greenwood and Schor (2009) also suggest that hedge funds may be better able 
21:546:45326:27:28:71:274:350:144:Times:144:Times:to identify underperforming companies.    
21:547:45368:28:27:107:524:322:144:Times:144:Times: Finally, because the SEC’s Rule would have given proxy access to investors who had 
21:548:45452:27:28:71:510:295:144:Times:144:Times:held their positions for at least 3 years, we explore empirical specifications that capture the 
21:549:45548:28:28:71:522:267:144:Times:144:Times:length of time that the firms’ existing investors, activist or otherwise, have held their stakes.   
21:550:45648:28:27:107:530:239:144:Times:144:Times:We also use three other governance-related measures for determining which companies 
21:551:45732:27:28:71:529:212:144:Times:144:Times:were more impacted by the SEC’s proxy access rule.  First, we distinguish between companies 
21:552:45824:28:27:71:515:184:144:Times:144:Times:incorporated in Delaware and those that are not.  At least since May 2009 and likely before, 
21:553:45917:27:28:71:530:157:144:Times:144:Times:shareholders in Delaware companies have had the ability to opt-in to shareholder access, while 
21:554:46012:28:0:71:525:129:144:Times:144:Times:shareholders of companies incorporated in other states do not clearly have this right.  It seems 
22:555:46112:0:27:71:523:708:144:Times:144:Times:possible, therefore, that Delaware companies would have benefitted less from SEC-mandated 
22:556:46202:27:28:71:388:681:144:Times:144:Times:shareholder access than companies incorporated in other states.    
22:557:46269:28:27:107:525:653:144:Times:144:Times:Finally, we differentiate companies according to whether they have a staggered board, 
22:558:46355:27:28:71:528:626:144:Times:144:Times:perhaps the most important antitakeover defense (Bebchuk, Coates & Subramanian 2002), and 
22:559:46445:28:28:71:497:598:144:Times:144:Times:according to their Governance Index (Gompers, Ishii and  Metrick 2003).  Both of these 
22:560:46532:28:27:71:534:570:144:Times:144:Times:measures test the theory that companies with greater entrenchment might be more vulnerable to 
22:561:46626:27:28:71:151:543:144:Times:144:Times:the SEC’s Rule. 
22:562:46642:28:27:107:532:515:144:Times:144:Times:The impact of shareholder proxy access may also depend on the scope for improvement 
22:563:46726:27:28:71:528:488:144:Times:144:Times:in firm performance.  A firm with strong current performance and a high stock price may offer 
22:564:46820:28:28:71:533:460:144:Times:144:Times:fewer opportunities for intervention.  We therefore sort firms based on lagged stock returns and 
22:565:46917:28:27:71:535:432:144:Times:144:Times:valuation ratios, to test whether the impact of institutional and activist institutional ownership is 
22:566:47019:27:28:71:373:405:144:Times:144:Times:strongest among the firms with the worst recent performance.  
22:567:47081:28:27:107:536:377:144:Times:144:Times:Because our empirical results are based on a single event and stock returns have patterns 
22:568:47171:27:28:71:533:350:144:Times:144:Times:of cross-sectional correlation, our approach and our measures of statistical significance must be 
22:569:47269:28:27:71:511:322:144:Times:144:Times:adjusted accordingly.  Our baseline regressions use risk-adjusted returns, which control for 
22:570:47362:27:28:71:520:295:144:Times:144:Times:market performance and the two additional risk factors identified in Fama and French (1993) 
22:571:47454:28:28:71:509:267:144:Times:144:Times:(see the data section for details).  Using risk-adjusted returns means that we control for the 
22:572:47549:28:27:71:507:239:144:Times:144:Times:overall pattern of market movements on October 4.  We also report results from using raw 
22:573:47638:27:28:71:375:212:144:Times:144:Times:returns as the dependent variable for the sake of completeness. 
22:574:47702:28:27:107:514:184:144:Times:144:Times:We also need to address cross-sectional correlation among stock returns. Incorrectly 
22:575:47787:27:28:71:524:157:144:Times:144:Times:assuming independence in stock movements can yield standard error estimates that are biased 
22:576:47879:28:28:71:530:129:144:Times:144:Times:downward (Fama and French 2000). Therefore, we do not rely on standard regression standard 
22:577:47970:28:0:71:514:101:144:Times:144:Times:error estimates to assess the significance of our coefficient estimates. Instead, we assess the 
23:578:48069:0:27:71:516:708:144:Times:144:Times:significance of our results in two ways: GLS standard errors and non-parametric assessment 
23:579:48160:27:28:71:525:681:144:Times:144:Times:using the empirical distribution of coefficient estimates. To calculate GLS standard errors, we 
23:580:48256:28:27:71:521:653:144:Times:144:Times:follow Greenwood (2005) and use pre-event return data for our sample stocks to estimate the 
23:581:48348:27:28:71:528:626:144:Times:144:Times:covariance matrix for individual stock returns. We then use the estimated covariance matrix to 
23:582:48443:28:28:71:515:598:144:Times:144:Times:calculate standard error estimates that adjust for the observed correlations between different 
23:583:48538:28:27:71:532:570:144:Times:144:Times:stocks.28  Applied to this setting, we find GLS standard error estimates are approximately twice 
23:584:48635:27:28:72:532:543:144:Times:144:Times:as large as OLS standard errors.  In all tables reporting regressions, we report the GLS standard 
23:585:48733:28:27:72:468:515:144:Times:144:Times:errors as well as p-values from the empirical distribution of coefficient estimates.  
23:586:48819:27:28:108:541:488:144:Times:144:Times:As a less parametric approach to assessing significance, we re-estimate each regression in 
23:587:48910:28:28:72:540:460:144:Times:144:Times:the 67 trading days after June 30, 2010.  We do not use earlier dates because our key variables of 
23:588:49009:28:27:72:536:432:144:Times:144:Times:interest are based on institutional holdings as of June 30.  We then use the empirical distribution 
23:589:49109:27:28:72:525:405:144:Times:144:Times:of coefficient estimates to test the significance of each of our regression coefficients.  In other 
23:590:49209:28:27:72:528:377:144:Times:144:Times:words, we empirically estimate how many days other than the event day would have delivered 
23:591:49300:27:28:72:535:350:144:Times:144:Times:estimated coefficients equal in magnitude to the coefficient we estimate for October 4.  Because 
23:592:49397:28:27:72:509:322:144:Times:144:Times:our significance estimates using this empirical approach are very similar to the GLS-based 
23:593:49488:27:28:72:355:295:144:Times:144:Times:estimates, our tables report only the GLS standard errors.   
23:594:49549:28:28:72:75:267:144:Times:144:Times: 
23:595:49549:28:27:72:111:239:144:Times:144:Times:4. Data 
23:596:49556:27:28:108:536:212:144:Times:144:Times:We collect stock price data from Datastream, and define each stock’s return as the log of 
23:597:49646:28:27:72:541:184:144:Times:144:Times:the closing stock price on Monday, October 4, minus the log of the closing stock price on Friday, 
23:598:49744:27:35:72:512:157:144:Times:144:Times:October 1.  We use a one-day event window because the SEC’s announcement on delaying 
23:599:49829:35:8:216:219:122:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
23:600:49877:8:16:72:539:114:42:Times:100:Times:28 In matrix notation, we use ൌܸሺܺᇱܺሻିଵሺܺᇱܺΩሻሺܺᇱܺሻିଵ to estimate standard errors, where X is a vector of return 
23:601:49989:16:13:72:538:98:100:Times:100:Times:data, and  is the pre-event covariance matrix of returns. This differs from basic OLS standard errors which use the 
23:602:50106:13:11:72:534:85:100:Times:100:Times:identity matrix in place of .  An underlying assumption in this approach is that the pre-event covariance matrix is 
23:603:50223:11:0:72:397:74:100:Times:100:Times:an appropriate estimate for the true underlying covariance matrix on October 4.   
24:604:50308:0:27:71:538:708:144:Times:144:Times:shareholder access came out during the trading day on October 4.29  We estimate factor-adjusted 
24:605:50404:27:28:72:538:681:144:Times:144:Times:returns based on the Fama-French (1993) three-factor model, which controls for firms’ exposure 
24:606:50499:28:27:72:535:653:144:Times:144:Times:to overall stock market movements as well as a value/growth effect and a small firm effect.  We 
24:607:50595:27:28:72:533:626:144:Times:144:Times:estimate firm betas on the Fama-French factors using daily stock returns for the period between 
24:608:50691:28:28:72:542:598:144:Times:144:Times:January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2009.  We use the daily factor returns from Ken French’s data 
24:609:50786:28:27:72:453:570:144:Times:144:Times:library.30  We winsorize all three beta estimates at the 5th and 95th percentiles.   
24:610:50871:27:28:108:532:543:144:Times:144:Times:We take the Gompers, Ishii and Metrick (2003) governance measure for each S&P1500 
24:611:50953:28:27:71:508:515:144:Times:144:Times:firm in 2006, the last year for which the index has been calculated.  From RiskMetrics, we 
24:612:51044:27:28:71:544:488:144:Times:144:Times:identify firms with staggered board provisions and collect data on the number of board members.  
24:613:51141:28:28:71:499:460:144:Times:144:Times:We collect data on each firm’s equity value from CRSP; this allows us to run both value-
24:614:51229:28:27:71:294:432:144:Times:144:Times:weighted and equal-weighted empirical tests.  
24:615:51275:27:28:107:530:405:144:Times:144:Times:Institutional ownership data come from ThomsonReuters, which summarizes data from 
24:616:51357:28:27:71:542:377:144:Times:144:Times:13F filings by institutional investors.  We use data from the second quarter of 2010, because later 
24:617:51457:27:28:71:499:350:144:Times:144:Times:data are incomplete.31  We look exclusively at shares held by U.S. institutions.  For each 
24:618:51548:28:27:72:539:322:144:Times:144:Times:investment manager, we calculate total holdings, as both dollars and number of stocks.  For each 
24:619:51645:27:28:71:541:295:144:Times:144:Times:firm in the sample we construct the following measures of institutional ownership: the number of 
24:620:51742:28:28:71:532:267:144:Times:144:Times:institutional owners; the number of institutional owners above the 3% ownership threshold (the 
24:621:51837:28:27:71:533:239:144:Times:144:Times:requirement for proxy access under the Rule); a dummy variable equal to 1 if a firm has at least 
24:622:51934:27:28:71:460:212:144:Times:144:Times:one institutional owner with a 3% stake; and the total ownership by institutions.  
24:623:52017:28:27:107:540:184:144:Times:144:Times:Activist institutional investors are more willing to intervene in corporate governance than 
24:624:52109:27:37:71:527:157:144:Times:144:Times:institutions overall.  Because these investors are particularly aggressive about influencing firm

24:626:52255:7:16:72:535:113:42:Times:100:Times:29 The SEC announcement was time-stamped at 12:21 pm on October 4.  The announcement hit Bloomberg at 3:20 
24:627:52362:16:7:72:124:97:100:Times:100:Times:pm that day.

24:629:52483:12:0:72:399:78:42:Times:100:Times:31 An earlier draft of the paper used holdings data from the first quarter of 2010.   
25:630:52572:0:27:71:537:708:144:Times:144:Times:management and board composition, they are more likely to have made use of proxy access (see 
25:631:52665:27:28:71:514:681:144:Times:144:Times:e.g. Brav, Jiang, Partnoy, and Thomas 2008).  We use the classification of activist investors 
25:632:52759:28:27:71:531:653:144:Times:144:Times:identified by Greenwood and Schor (2009).  They construct a sample of activists based on 13D 
25:633:52852:27:28:71:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:filings and DFAN filings with the SEC.  Investment managers and other investors must file a 
25:634:52944:28:28:71:524:598:144:Times:144:Times:13D filling with the SEC within 10 days of acquiring 5% or more of any class of a company's 
25:635:53036:28:27:71:540:570:144:Times:144:Times:securities.  13D filings also include a “Purpose of Transaction” section which allows Greenwood 
25:636:53132:27:28:71:529:543:144:Times:144:Times:and Schor to identify activist purposes and exclude investors whose 13D filings reflect passive 
25:637:53228:28:27:71:541:515:144:Times:144:Times:strategies.  DFAN filings are filed with the SEC by investors intending to engage in a proxy fight 
25:638:53327:27:28:71:531:488:144:Times:144:Times:with firm management.  These filings allow Greenwood and Schor to construct a list of activist 
25:639:53422:28:28:71:528:460:144:Times:144:Times:investors, which they identify as investors whose 13D or DFAN filings indicate activist intent. 
25:640:53518:28:27:71:521:432:144:Times:144:Times:They identify 177 investment managers as activists, of which 139 are hedge funds and 38 are 
25:641:53610:27:28:71:527:405:144:Times:144:Times:non-hedge funds. Many of the activist investors in the Greenwood and Schor sample are serial 
25:642:53703:28:27:71:509:377:144:Times:144:Times:activists.  In particular, eleven hedge funds account for more than two-thirds of the activist 
25:643:53798:27:28:71:508:350:144:Times:144:Times:activity in the Greenwood and Schor sample.32 The Greenwood and Schor classification is 
25:644:53886:28:27:71:533:322:144:Times:144:Times:narrow in the sense that some activist investors will not appear because they (a) held stakes that 
25:645:53985:27:28:71:526:295:144:Times:144:Times:were too small to trigger the 13D filing requirement; or (b) the purpose statements may not be 
25:646:54080:28:28:71:529:267:144:Times:144:Times:accurate, or may become less accurate over time for a given holding (since the filing is done at 
25:647:54177:28:27:71:168:239:144:Times:144:Times:initial acquisition).  
25:648:54200:27:28:107:518:212:144:Times:144:Times: We collect firm data from the CRSP-Compustat merged database. For each firm, we 
25:649:54281:28:27:71:540:184:144:Times:144:Times:calculate its 2009 end of year book-to-market ratio (book value of common equity divided by the 
25:650:54377:27:60:71:503:157:144:Times:144:Times:stock price times number of shares outstanding), minus the mean of its Fama-French (48) 
25:651:54465:60:7:216:219:97:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
25:652:54513:7:16:72:539:90:42:Times:100:Times:32 They are: Farallon Capital, Steel Partners, VA Partners, Wynnefield, Blum Capital, Carl Icahn, Chapman Capital, 
25:653:54628:16:0:72:312:74:100:Times:100:Times:Newcastle Partners, JANA, Third Point, and Pirate Capital. 
26:654:54690:0:27:71:535:708:144:Times:144:Times:industry. Similarly, we calculate the industry-adjusted calendar year 2009 stock return using the 
26:655:54788:27:28:71:312:681:144:Times:144:Times:Fama-French 48-sector industry classification.33

26:657:54839:27:28:72:124:626:144:Times:144:Times:5. Results 
26:658:54849:28:28:108:512:598:144:Times:144:Times:Our main sample is the S&P 1500 because these firms are large, liquid, and heavily 
26:659:54932:28:27:72:530:570:144:Times:144:Times:traded, but our results also hold for the larger universe of all publicly-traded companies.  In the 
26:660:55032:27:28:72:500:543:144:Times:144:Times:S&P 1500, we have ownership data for 1,388 firms.  Panel A of Table 1 shows the mean 
26:661:55117:28:27:72:504:515:144:Times:144:Times:institutional ownership as well as activist institutional ownership, both by decile. There is 
26:662:55211:27:28:72:539:488:144:Times:144:Times:substantial variation in each of these measures.  Institutional ownership overall amounts to about 
26:663:55310:28:28:72:529:460:144:Times:144:Times:half of the typical company’s shares, but in the bottom decile, institutional ownership averages 
26:664:55407:28:27:72:500:432:144:Times:144:Times:about 25.3 percent.  In the top decile it averages almost 70 percent.  Activist institutional 
26:665:55501:27:28:72:530:405:144:Times:144:Times:ownership averages 0.05% of the shares in the bottom decile, but over 13% of shares in the top 
26:666:55596:28:27:72:110:377:144:Times:144:Times:decile.  
26:667:55605:27:28:108:233:350:144:Times:144:Times:a. Institutional ownership 
26:668:55631:28:27:108:496:322:144:Times:144:Times:Panel B of Table 1 presents summary statistics for four measures of institutional 
26:669:55713:27:28:71:526:295:144:Times:144:Times:ownership: the raw total institutional ownership; the number of owners with at least 3% of the 
26:670:55808:28:28:72:507:267:144:Times:144:Times:capital; the highest single activist institutional ownership stake; and the number of activist 
26:671:55903:28:27:72:173:239:144:Times:144:Times:institutional owners. 
26:672:55925:27:28:108:532:212:144:Times:144:Times:Table 2 sorts firms by institutional ownership, and examine returns on October 4 across 
26:673:56013:28:27:72:539:184:144:Times:144:Times:the different levels of institutional ownership.  Figure 1 presents the same information in graphic 
26:674:56113:27:28:72:535:157:144:Times:144:Times:form.  The first column shows that the average equal-weighted return was -124 basis points, but 
26:675:56209:28:28:72:512:129:144:Times:144:Times:firms in the highest ownership decile dropped 44 basis points more than firms in the lowest 
26:676:56301:28:15:72:522:101:144:Times:144:Times:ownership decile.  The difference is statistically significant at the 1 percent confidence level.  
26:677:56400:15:8:216:219:86:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
26:678:56448:8:0:72:520:78:42:Times:100:Times:33 Results are similar when we use 12 Fama-French industries, 2-digit NAICS codes, and S&P Industry sectors. 
27:679:56560:0:27:107:536:708:144:Times:144:Times:The next column reports excess returns, which control for firms’ exposure to the market, 
27:680:56649:27:28:71:541:681:144:Times:144:Times:size, and value factors.  Using this return measure, the difference between the returns of high and 
27:681:56749:28:27:71:514:653:144:Times:144:Times:low institutional ownership stocks is 37 basis points.  Sorting on activist owners produces a 
27:682:56843:27:28:71:483:626:144:Times:144:Times:differential of 43 basis points.  Both of these differences are statistically significant.   
27:683:56936:28:28:107:519:598:144:Times:144:Times:Table 3 presents the baseline regression results.  In column (1), we regress the excess 
27:684:57024:28:27:71:494:570:144:Times:144:Times:returns for the day of each stock in the S&P 1500 index on institutional ownership. The 
27:685:57112:27:28:71:533:543:144:Times:144:Times:coefficient estimate in this specification is -137 basis points, significantly different from zero at 
27:686:57214:28:27:71:516:515:144:Times:144:Times:the 10 percent confidence level. Here and throughout the paper, our reported standard errors 
27:687:57307:27:28:71:530:488:144:Times:144:Times:account for the observed correlation of individual stock returns, as discussed in Section 3.  The 
27:688:57405:28:28:71:518:460:144:Times:144:Times:R-squared in this regression is low, reflecting the noisy nature of stock returns and the many 
27:689:57500:28:27:71:540:432:144:Times:144:Times:factors that will affect individual securities. Although our event clearly affected a subset of firms 
27:690:57602:27:28:71:539:405:144:Times:144:Times:(i.e. the t-stat is significant), it was not the major mover of stock prices that day (this also applies 
27:691:57707:28:27:71:515:377:144:Times:144:Times:to the specifications we report below). The coefficient estimate implies that a 10 percentage 
27:692:57801:27:28:71:535:350:144:Times:144:Times:point increase in institutional ownership was associated with an additional 14 basis point loss of 
27:693:57900:28:27:71:536:322:144:Times:144:Times:value on October 4.  Column (2) of Table 3 presents a similar regression for activist institutions. 
27:694:58000:27:28:71:524:295:144:Times:144:Times:The estimated coefficients are larger in magnitude and statistically significant at the 1 percent 
27:695:58098:28:28:71:538:267:144:Times:144:Times:confidence level.  The coefficient estimate implies that a ten percentage point increase in activist 
27:696:58199:28:27:71:436:239:144:Times:144:Times:ownership is associated with a 55 basis point drop in value on October 4.34  
27:697:58276:27:28:108:516:212:144:Times:144:Times:In columns (3) and (4), we repeat these tests using excess returns.  Our excess return 
27:698:58363:28:27:72:541:184:144:Times:144:Times:measures  adjust returns based on the Fama-French three-factor model.  Betas for the three-factor 
27:699:58461:27:28:72:475:157:144:Times:144:Times:model are estimated using daily data from 2009.  The coefficient estimate using the 
27:700:58545:28:20:72:532:129:144:Times:144:Times:comprehensive institutional ownership measure is -113 basis points, again significant at the ten 
27:701:58642:20:8:216:219:109:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
27:702:58690:8:16:72:517:101:42:Times:100:Times:34 Results using the time window [0,2] or [-1,2], i.e. returns of October 2 and October 5, are similar to baseline 
27:703:58805:16:11:72:531:85:100:Times:100:Times:results in magnitude and statistical significance. Results with the [0,3] time window which incorporates returns on 
27:704:58921:11:0:72:353:74:100:Times:100:Times:October 5 and October, 6, are similar in magnitudes but insignificant. 
28:705:58995:0:27:71:526:708:144:Times:144:Times:percent level.  The coefficient estimate for the activist institutional ownership measure is -527 
28:706:59093:27:28:71:517:681:144:Times:144:Times:basis points, significant at the 1 percent confidence level. From this point on, we only report 
28:707:59189:28:27:71:505:653:144:Times:144:Times:regressions with excess returns.  This approach is more conservative, and controls for any 
28:708:59280:27:28:71:521:626:144:Times:144:Times:differences in factor exposures across stocks.  Columns (5) and (6) of Table 3 examine value-
28:709:59373:28:28:71:521:598:144:Times:144:Times:weighted excess returns. Coefficient estimates are slightly larger, but the estimated statistical 
28:710:59471:28:27:71:173:570:144:Times:144:Times:significance falls.35   
28:711:59495:27:28:107:532:543:144:Times:144:Times: These results are consistent with a loss in value for those firms expected to benefit from 
28:712:59586:28:27:72:487:515:144:Times:144:Times:proxy access in the future. Are they also consistent with a general loss of faith in SEC 
28:713:59675:27:28:72:509:488:144:Times:144:Times:enforcement? We believe that they are. However, this does not appear to explain the lower 
28:714:59765:28:28:72:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:returns for firms that were more likely proxy access targets, since there is no reason that SEC 
28:715:59861:28:27:72:520:432:144:Times:144:Times:enforcement generally should affect exactly those firms that had high activist ownership. Put 
28:716:59955:27:28:72:536:405:144:Times:144:Times:differently, we cannot evaluate the extent that the case was perceived as bad news for the SEC’s 
28:717:60052:28:27:72:533:377:144:Times:144:Times:ability to enforce more generally, as long as that effect was market-wide (or affected a different 
28:718:60151:27:28:72:530:350:144:Times:144:Times:set of firms from those we identified using activist ownership). We cannot extract the market’s 
28:719:60247:28:27:72:315:322:144:Times:144:Times:view of the SEC’s general ability to enforce rules. 
28:720:60299:27:28:108:203:295:144:Times:144:Times:b. Intra-day returns 
28:721:60319:28:28:108:525:267:144:Times:144:Times:We now turn to intra-day returns to assess the extent to which our 1-day results can be 
28:722:60407:28:27:72:526:239:144:Times:144:Times:attributed to the SEC’s announcement on proxy access.  We start with within-day trading data 
28:723:60500:27:28:72:532:212:144:Times:144:Times:from Bloomberg for all available firms from the S&P 1500 for October 4, 2010.  We divide the 
28:724:60593:28:27:72:536:184:144:Times:144:Times:trading day into 5-minute windows and calculate for each stock the average trading price during 
28:725:60689:27:25:71:541:157:144:Times:144:Times:the 5-minute window.  We then calculate a cumulative return measure for each 5-minute window 
28:726:60782:25:8:216:219:132:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
28:727:60830:8:16:72:526:124:42:Times:100:Times:35 If the observed price drop for firms with high activist ownership reflected temporary price pressure as activists 
28:728:60947:16:11:72:531:108:100:Times:100:Times:dumped their positions, we might expect smaller responses for large institutions since these have deeper and more 
28:729:61061:11:12:72:530:97:100:Times:100:Times:liquid trading, and can be expected to have smaller price responses to idiosyncratic trading. The fact that the point 
28:730:61179:12:11:72:536:85:100:Times:100:Times:estimates in the value weighted regress are larger, suggests that we are not necessarily measuring a temporary price 
28:731:61296:11:0:71:456:74:100:Times:100:Times:movement. We discuss this issue, and try longer time windows to address this concnern, below. 
29:732:61393:0:27:71:527:708:144:Times:144:Times:using the change in price from the previous day’s close to price observed within that window.  
29:733:61488:27:28:71:541:681:144:Times:144:Times:We then estimate 79 different regressions of cumulative returns on our activism measure: one for 
29:734:61585:28:27:71:505:653:144:Times:144:Times:each of the 78 within-day windows and one for the return based on market closing price.   
29:735:61675:27:28:107:515:626:144:Times:144:Times:Figure 2 shows the results of our analysis.  The aggregate market movement that we 
29:736:61758:28:28:71:535:598:144:Times:144:Times:document in Table 2 occurs mostly during the morning hours, while the divergence between the 
29:737:61851:28:27:71:516:570:144:Times:144:Times:activist-owned firms and other firms appears to have come mostly in the afternoon, after the 
29:738:61944:27:28:71:517:543:144:Times:144:Times:SEC’s announcement.  The effect appears to have accelerated at the end of the day, after the 
29:739:62037:28:27:71:514:515:144:Times:144:Times:Bloomberg coverage of the SEC’s announcement.  This intra-day analysis suggests that our 
29:740:62126:27:28:71:530:488:144:Times:144:Times:observed activism effect is not a spurious result arising from insufficient control for the overall 
29:741:62226:28:28:71:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:market movement; in addition, the timing also appears consistent with the hypothesis that the 
29:742:62320:28:27:71:525:432:144:Times:144:Times:SEC’s announcement caused the underperformance of activist-held firms on October 4, 2010. 
29:743:62410:27:28:107:245:405:144:Times:144:Times:c. Alternative specifications 
29:744:62439:28:27:108:515:377:144:Times:144:Times:Table 4 examines alternative measures of institutional ownership. In column (1), we 
29:745:62523:27:28:72:524:350:144:Times:144:Times:measure the largest institutional stake (as a share of firm equity value), including both activist 
29:746:62622:28:27:72:489:322:144:Times:144:Times:and non-activist institutions.  The estimated coefficient is negative and not statistically 
29:747:62714:27:28:72:539:295:144:Times:144:Times:significant.  Column (2) regresses the October 4 excess return on the largest single activist stake, 
29:748:62815:28:28:72:511:267:144:Times:144:Times:and our estimated coefficient of -642 basis points is statistically significant at the 1 percent 
29:749:62912:28:27:72:515:239:144:Times:144:Times:confidence level.  The fact that this coefficient is larger than the coefficient for total activist 
29:750:63012:27:28:72:502:212:144:Times:144:Times:ownership highlights the role of large single activist investors.  This is consistent with an 
29:751:63106:28:27:72:522:184:144:Times:144:Times:important role for concentrated institutional ownership, and may reflect coordination costs or 
29:752:63201:27:28:72:430:157:144:Times:144:Times:free-riding (see e.g., Grossman and Hart 1980, Shleifer and Vishny 1986). 
29:753:63275:28:28:108:538:129:144:Times:144:Times:The third alternative measure is motivated by the details of the SEC’s Rule, which would 
29:754:63364:28:0:72:535:101:144:Times:144:Times:have required an owner to have a 3 percent stake to qualify for proxy access. Although the Rule 
30:755:63463:0:27:71:532:708:144:Times:144:Times:would have allowed investors to combine for the purpose of proxy access, having an individual 
30:756:63557:27:28:71:539:681:144:Times:144:Times:owner above the 3 percent threshold means that proxy access was feasible without coordination.  
30:757:63653:28:27:71:539:653:144:Times:144:Times:Having more such owners might increase the likelihood further (this number ranges from zero to 
30:758:63748:27:28:71:529:626:144:Times:144:Times:four).  In column (3), the coefficient on the number of institutional owners with stakes above 3 
30:759:63845:28:28:71:523:598:144:Times:144:Times:percent is negative and significant at the 1 percent level. The coefficient estimate implies that 
30:760:63943:28:27:71:534:570:144:Times:144:Times:each additional large, institutional owner in a firm is associated with a reduction of equity value 
30:761:64043:27:28:71:229:543:144:Times:144:Times:by 33 basis points on October 4. 
30:762:64076:28:27:107:214:515:144:Times:144:Times:d. Firm heterogeneity 
30:763:64097:27:28:108:538:488:144:Times:144:Times:Having established that activist ownership is associated with negative returns on October 
30:764:64187:28:28:72:525:460:144:Times:144:Times:4, we now test hypotheses about the relationship between firm characteristics and the value of 
30:765:64282:28:27:72:535:432:144:Times:144:Times:proxy access.  Table 5 presents the results of this analysis.  All of these results use excess return 
30:766:64384:27:28:72:535:405:144:Times:144:Times:measures, use the S&P 1500 sample, and control for activist institutional ownership. In general, 
30:767:64481:28:27:72:346:377:144:Times:144:Times:the evidence of any role for governance metrics is weak. 
30:768:64538:27:28:108:541:350:144:Times:144:Times:Our first test looks at the impact of staggered boards, as a proxy for corporate governance 
30:769:64630:28:27:72:533:322:144:Times:144:Times:at each firm.   The regression results in column (1) of Table 5 suggest that having a staggered is 
30:770:64729:27:28:72:522:295:144:Times:144:Times:not predictive of stock return on the event day.  In column (2), we use the Gompers, Ishii and 
30:771:64824:28:28:72:515:267:144:Times:144:Times:Metrick (2003) governance index (“G”).  The hypothesis is that firms with poor governance 
30:772:64914:28:27:72:511:239:144:Times:144:Times:measures (high G values) may see larger potential benefits from shareholder proxy access.  
30:773:65005:27:28:72:518:212:144:Times:144:Times:Again, the results are close to zero, and we cannot reject a zero effect at standard confidence 
30:774:65101:28:27:72:120:184:144:Times:144:Times:levels.36   
30:775:65113:27:28:108:504:157:144:Times:144:Times:We next turn to Delaware incorporation. Because Delaware corporate law already 
30:776:65192:28:32:72:504:129:144:Times:144:Times:facilitates opt-in proxy access, the SEC rule might have had a smaller effect for Delaware 
30:777:65283:32:7:216:219:97:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
30:778:65331:7:16:72:534:90:42:Times:100:Times:36 We have also included the interaction of the GIM index with activist ownership. This interaction is not related to 
30:779:65449:16:0:72:501:74:100:Times:100:Times:returns, suggesting that the value of the governance index does not mediate the important of proxy access.  
31:780:65560:0:27:71:519:708:144:Times:144:Times:companies.37  Alternatively, if investors perceived that a proxy access proposal would not be 
31:781:65654:27:28:72:531:681:144:Times:144:Times:prohibited in other states, notwithstanding their lack of explicit recognition of the possibility of 
31:782:65755:28:27:72:518:653:144:Times:144:Times:opting in, then Delaware firms should react no differently than firms in other states.  We test 
31:783:65851:27:28:72:539:626:144:Times:144:Times:these competing hypotheses by including the interaction of a dummy for Delaware incorporation 
31:784:65945:28:28:72:508:598:144:Times:144:Times:and institutional ownership, as well as a dummy variable for Delaware incorporation.  The 
31:785:66035:28:27:72:541:570:144:Times:144:Times:coefficient estimate on the Delaware dummy itself is negative and significant.  The interaction of 
31:786:66134:27:28:72:524:543:144:Times:144:Times:the Delaware dummy with institutional ownership is positive and significant at the 10 percent 
31:787:66228:28:27:72:538:515:144:Times:144:Times:confidence level. The different coefficients imply that non-Delaware firms saw value drop by 81 
31:788:66324:27:28:72:533:488:144:Times:144:Times:basis points for every 10 percentage points of activist ownership, while  Delaware-incorporated 
31:789:66420:28:28:72:520:460:144:Times:144:Times:firms dropped by only 31 basis points per 10 percentage points of activist ownership (=0.1*(-
31:790:66513:28:27:72:537:432:144:Times:144:Times:810+497) basis points). Thus, the estimated effect of institutional ownership is much smaller for 
31:791:66611:27:28:72:490:405:144:Times:144:Times:Delaware firms, consistent with our prediction that the marketplaces considers explicit 
31:792:66699:28:27:72:418:377:144:Times:144:Times:recognition of opt-in proxy access at Delaware firms to be meaningful.  
31:793:66771:27:28:108:528:350:144:Times:144:Times:We also examine board structure, specifically, board size.  Yermack (1996) argues that 
31:794:66858:28:27:72:524:322:144:Times:144:Times:smaller boards are more effective than large boards. If this is true, there may be less scope for 
31:795:66956:27:28:72:529:295:144:Times:144:Times:improvement for firms with small boards, and so the proxy rule announcement return might be 
31:796:67048:28:28:72:497:267:144:Times:144:Times:larger (i.e., smaller losses for firms that were already well managed). On the other hand, 
31:797:67139:28:27:72:541:239:144:Times:144:Times:shareholder nominees might have more influence on a smaller board than on a larger board (even 
31:798:67234:27:28:72:518:212:144:Times:144:Times:though the fraction of directors remains the same, at one-quarter), and so the withdrawn rule 
31:799:67328:28:27:72:526:184:144:Times:144:Times:might have had more impact on firms with small boards.  We test these competing hypotheses 
31:800:67419:27:37:72:542:157:144:Times:144:Times:for board size in column (4) of Table 5.  The coefficient on the board size variable is positive and 
31:801:67520:37:7:216:219:120:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
31:802:67568:7:16:72:508:113:42:Times:100:Times:37 The same argument would also hold for North Dakota companies, where the corporate law since 2007 has 
31:803:67672:16:12:72:515:97:100:Times:100:Times:provided mandatory proxy access for any 5% shareholder that has held their shares for at least two years.  See 
31:804:67783:12:11:72:535:85:100:Times:100:Times:Publicly Traded Corporations Act ch. 102, 2007 N.D. Laws 497, codified at North Dakota Cent. Code § 10-35-08.  
31:805:67894:11:0:72:316:74:100:Times:100:Times:However, there are no North Dakota firms in the S&P 1500. 
32:806:67955:0:27:71:521:708:144:Times:144:Times:statistically insignificant, indicating that the value loss on October 4 did not depend on board 
32:807:68052:27:28:71:104:681:144:Times:144:Times:size.38 
32:808:68059:28:27:108:311:653:144:Times:144:Times:e. Investor heterogeneity: holding periods 
32:809:68101:27:28:108:519:626:144:Times:144:Times:We next examine the effect of institutional holding periods.  The proposed SEC Rule 
32:810:68185:28:28:72:539:598:144:Times:144:Times:would have given proxy access to investors whose stakes had been held for 3 years or more.  We 
32:811:68280:28:27:72:516:570:144:Times:144:Times:thus construct two additional measures of institutional ownership: the first measure (used in 
32:812:68374:27:28:72:520:543:144:Times:144:Times:columns (2) and (5) of Table 6) is a measure of institutional ownership that includes only the 
32:813:68469:28:27:72:538:515:144:Times:144:Times:institutional stakes that have been held for more than 3 years.  The second measure is based on a 
32:814:68567:27:28:72:526:488:144:Times:144:Times:weighting scheme, applying a (1/12) weight for holdings held for only 3 months, up through a 
32:815:68660:28:28:72:533:460:144:Times:144:Times:(12/12) weight to holdings held for 12 quarters. Therefore, the variable puts progressively more 
32:816:68757:28:27:72:538:432:144:Times:144:Times:weight on holdings that are closer to qualifying under the Rule. Columns (1)-(3) use the baseline 
32:817:68855:27:28:72:507:405:144:Times:144:Times:measure of institutional ownership, the measure of three year old stakes, and the weighted 
32:818:68946:28:27:72:518:377:144:Times:144:Times:measure. Columns (4)-(6) we use only activist investors, and apply the same three methods.  
32:819:69038:27:28:72:538:350:144:Times:144:Times:Coefficient estimates are higher when we use the measures of ownership that control for holding 
32:820:69134:28:27:72:528:322:144:Times:144:Times:duration, and as before borderline significant for overall institutions, and highly significant for 
32:821:69234:27:28:72:519:295:144:Times:144:Times:activists.  This finding is consistent with the marker reaction on October 4 reflecting holding 
32:822:69330:28:28:72:346:267:144:Times:144:Times:periods as well as the amount of institutional ownership. 
32:823:69388:28:27:108:244:239:144:Times:144:Times:f. Lagged firm performance 
32:824:69414:27:28:108:524:212:144:Times:144:Times:Our final analysis examines the relationship between lagged firm performance and the 
32:825:69499:28:27:72:529:184:144:Times:144:Times:results we have described above.  The scope for improvement by activist investors should vary 
32:826:69593:27:28:72:530:157:144:Times:144:Times:across firms, and be related to firms’ previous performance.  We test this hypothesis by sorting 
32:827:69690:28:32:72:541:129:144:Times:144:Times:firms based on variables related to recent performance: the end of 2009 book-to-market ratio (the 
32:828:69788:32:7:216:219:97:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
32:829:69836:7:16:72:513:90:42:Times:100:Times:38 We have replicated this finding with alternative measures of board size, such as the number of directors per 
32:830:69948:16:0:72:281:74:100:Times:100:Times:million dollars of equity market value (unreported). 
33:831:70004:0:27:71:518:708:144:Times:144:Times:ratio of equity book value to market value) and the stock return over 2007-2009. For each of 
33:832:70097:27:28:71:518:681:144:Times:144:Times:these variables, we demean by Fama-French industry using all firms in the same 48-industry 
33:833:70188:28:27:71:527:653:144:Times:144:Times:classification.   Our assumption is that poor performance relative to a firm’s industry is a good 
33:834:70286:27:28:71:517:626:144:Times:144:Times:proxy for the available scope of potential improvements.  Table 7 presents the results of this 
33:835:70381:28:28:71:534:598:144:Times:144:Times:analysis.  Columns (1) and (2) are split by 2007-2009 stock return; columns (3) and (4) are split 
33:836:70479:28:27:71:533:570:144:Times:144:Times:by market-to-book ratios.39 The impact of activist institutional ownership is larger in firms with 
33:837:70578:27:28:71:534:543:144:Times:144:Times:poor recent performance.  The difference between the coefficient estimates in the subsamples is 
33:838:70674:28:27:71:255:515:144:Times:144:Times:large but insignificant for both splits.  
33:839:70716:27:28:107:374:488:144:Times:144:Times:g. The D.C. Circuit decision event date (July 22, 2011) 
33:840:70771:28:28:108:498:460:144:Times:144:Times:We repeat our event study methodology on July 22, 2011, when the D.C. Circuit 
33:841:70849:28:27:72:527:432:144:Times:144:Times:invalidated the proxy access Rule.  Results are reported in Table 8, using 2010Q2 measures of 
33:842:70943:27:28:72:509:405:144:Times:144:Times:activist holdings, for equal-weighted raw returns, equal-weighted excess returns and value-
33:843:71034:28:27:72:534:377:144:Times:144:Times:weighted excess returns for the one day event window of the day of the ruling. The estimate for 
33:844:71130:27:28:72:527:350:144:Times:144:Times:equal-weighted excess return (the smallest estimate of the three) is -463 basis points, implying 
33:845:71227:28:27:72:539:322:144:Times:144:Times:that a 10% difference in activist holdings corresponds to a 4.6% loss in value on the July 22. The 
33:846:71326:27:28:72:506:295:144:Times:144:Times:loss in value for firms with activist owners is therefore slightly smaller on July 22 than on 
33:847:71420:28:28:72:540:267:144:Times:144:Times:October 4 of the previous year, but directionally similar. To the extent that the court’s ruling was 
33:848:71521:28:27:72:537:239:144:Times:144:Times:a further negative surprise regarding the availability of proxy access going forward, these results 
33:849:71621:27:28:72:492:212:144:Times:144:Times:are consistent with the results reported with respect to the October 4 event date (that is, 
33:850:71713:28:27:72:533:184:144:Times:144:Times:companies that were more vulnerable to shareholder proxy access suffered an abnormal decline 
33:851:71806:27:25:72:533:157:144:Times:144:Times:on that day)The smaller estimated effect might be due to the fact that the July 22 event changed 
33:852:71903:25:8:216:219:132:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
33:853:71951:8:16:72:539:124:42:Times:100:Times:39 Because we split by whether a firm is above or below average, not median, industry performance, and because we 
33:854:72065:16:11:71:532:108:100:Times:100:Times:define averages for all Compustat firms, not just the S&P1500 group, the subsamples are not exactly of equal size. 
33:855:72180:11:12:71:535:97:100:Times:100:Times:The logic of the test seems to suggest that the best possible split into strong and weak performers is more important 
33:856:72298:12:11:71:525:85:100:Times:100:Times:than getting equal size samples. Splitting so that samples are equal size provides qualitatively similar results. We 
33:857:72415:11:0:71:394:74:100:Times:100:Times:have also performed splits into more groups (i.e., quartiles), with similar results. 
34:858:72503:0:27:71:516:708:144:Times:144:Times:expectations on proxy access less than the October 4 event.  On October 4, the likelihood of 
34:859:72596:27:28:71:531:681:144:Times:144:Times:proxy access went from virtually 100% to 0%, at least for 2011 and maybe for longer.  On July 
34:860:72690:28:27:71:527:653:144:Times:144:Times:22, the likelihood of proxy access went from something substantially less than 100% to 0%, at 
34:861:72784:27:28:71:264:626:144:Times:144:Times:least for 2012 and maybe for longer.  40

34:863:72824:28:27:72:144:570:144:Times:144:Times:6. Discussion  
34:864:72839:27:28:108:491:543:144:Times:144:Times:We find that the companies that would have been most vulnerable to the SEC’s 
34:865:72916:28:27:72:506:515:144:Times:144:Times:shareholder proxy access rule experienced a statistically significant drop in value after the 
34:866:73010:27:28:72:538:488:144:Times:144:Times:unexpected delay in the Rule on October 4, 2010.    The magnitude of the implied positive effect 
34:867:73107:28:28:72:540:460:144:Times:144:Times:of proxy access that we find is economically significant.  We estimate that firms that would have 
34:868:73205:28:27:72:540:432:144:Times:144:Times:been most affected by proxy access, as measured by overall institutional ownership, lost 12 basis 
34:869:73303:27:28:72:520:405:144:Times:144:Times:points of value for each standard deviation of ownership.  For firms that had large ownership 
34:870:73397:28:27:72:540:377:144:Times:144:Times:stakes held by historically activist institutions, the value loss was almost five times as large.  The 
34:871:73500:27:28:72:483:350:144:Times:144:Times:results highlight the importance of the process for nominating and electing directors.  
34:872:73588:28:27:108:520:322:144:Times:144:Times:This value loss is particularly striking because the October 4 event only created some 
34:873:73675:27:28:72:517:295:144:Times:144:Times:probability (less than 1) of losing shareholder proxy access.  We find a directionally similar, 
34:874:73771:28:28:72:524:267:144:Times:144:Times:though not statistically significant, drop in shareholder value on July 22, 2011, when the D.C. 
34:875:73867:28:27:72:535:239:144:Times:144:Times:Circuit invalidated the SEC’s proxy access rule.  To the extent that the market did not anticipate 
34:876:73966:27:28:72:516:212:144:Times:144:Times:the D.C. Circuit’s decision, our October 4 results only measure the value loss from delaying 
34:877:74059:28:27:72:536:184:144:Times:144:Times:shareholder proxy access by one year.  That is, the value of shareholder proxy access is likely to 
34:878:74158:27:37:72:314:157:144:Times:144:Times:be larger than what is captured in our event study. 
34:879:74210:37:7:216:219:120:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
34:880:74258:7:16:72:535:113:42:Times:100:Times:40 By way of comparison, Bebchuk, Cohen and Wang (2011) found a positive and significant stock market reaction 
34:881:74369:16:12:72:527:97:100:Times:100:Times:when the Delaware Chancery Court (in effect) unexpectedly weakened staggered boards, and then a negative and 
34:882:74478:12:11:72:503:85:100:Times:100:Times:statistically significant stock market reaction when the Delaware Supreme Court unexpectedly reversed the 
34:883:74584:11:0:72:479:74:100:Times:100:Times:Chancery Court decision.  The two events in the Bebchuk et al. study operated in opposite directions. 
35:884:74689:0:27:107:524:708:144:Times:144:Times:Our findings are consistent with Cohn et al. (2011), which uses three event dates from 
35:885:74776:27:28:71:532:681:144:Times:144:Times:2010 (though not October 4).  They find that the events that they argue increased the likelihood 
35:886:74873:28:27:71:537:653:144:Times:144:Times:or impact of shareholder proxy access increased firm equity value, and events that decreased the 
35:887:74970:27:28:71:416:626:144:Times:144:Times:likelihood or impact of shareholder access decreased firm equity value. 
35:888:75042:28:28:107:528:598:144:Times:144:Times:Our findings are inconsistent with Larcker et al. (2010) and Akyol et al. (2010).  These 
35:889:75131:28:27:71:512:570:144:Times:144:Times:prior papers found that events that (arguably) increased the likelihood of shareholder proxy 
35:890:75224:27:28:71:531:543:144:Times:144:Times:access reduced firm value, and vice versa.  The difference between our findings and these prior 
35:891:75320:28:27:71:537:515:144:Times:144:Times:papers might be explained by time differences.  For example, in 2006-09, the market might have 
35:892:75415:27:28:71:523:488:144:Times:144:Times:had a negative view of shareholder proxy access, but this view might have changed by 2010.  
35:893:75507:28:28:71:530:460:144:Times:144:Times:Alternatively, or in addition, in 2006-09, the market did not have clarity on what the final Rule 
35:894:75605:28:27:71:465:432:144:Times:144:Times:would look like, but by October 2010 the market reacted to a well-defined Rule.   
35:895:75687:27:28:107:530:405:144:Times:144:Times:Another possibility that would explain the different findings between our paper and the 
35:896:75775:28:27:71:498:377:144:Times:144:Times:prior related work might be the different methodologies used, or the nature of the events 
35:897:75865:27:28:71:537:350:144:Times:144:Times:themselves.  For reasons explained in Sections 2-3, we believe that the October 4 event provides 
35:898:75962:28:27:71:525:322:144:Times:144:Times:the cleanest test on the value of shareholder proxy access because the October 4 event.  In our 
35:899:76058:27:28:71:533:295:144:Times:144:Times:view, the October 4 event, unlike all prior events, was material, directionally clear, and also not 
35:900:76158:28:28:71:214:267:144:Times:144:Times:expected by the marketplace. 
35:901:76187:28:27:107:528:239:144:Times:144:Times:In order to examine the influence of methodological differences, we examined some of 
35:902:76272:27:28:71:519:212:144:Times:144:Times:the dates proposed in other papers using our methodology: i.e. regressing three-factor excess 
35:903:76366:28:27:71:535:184:144:Times:144:Times:returns on our measure of activist holdings. In our sample of large firms (S&P1500), coefficient 
35:904:76463:27:28:71:504:157:144:Times:144:Times:estimates (the return difference for a one hundred percentage point change in institutional 
35:905:76555:28:0:71:534:129:144:Times:144:Times:ownership) for June 16-17, 2010; June 24-25, 2010 and August 25, 2010 were 156, 17, and 279 
36:906:76650:0:27:71:526:708:144:Times:144:Times:basis points, respectively.41 The t-statistics for these coefficients, using the Greenwood (2005) 
36:907:76747:27:28:72:538:681:144:Times:144:Times:GLS standard errors, are -0.78, 0.11 and 1.77, respectively. In other words, by our methodology, 
36:908:76844:28:27:72:533:653:144:Times:144:Times:these dates do not deliver significant returns at the 95% statistical confidence level, a result that 
36:909:76946:27:28:72:523:626:144:Times:144:Times:is consistent with our view (as discussed in Section 2) that these events were unlikely to have 
36:910:77042:28:28:72:517:598:144:Times:144:Times:surprised the market. If instead of using the Greenwood (2005) GLS standard errors, we use 
36:911:77133:28:27:72:516:570:144:Times:144:Times:standard error estimates that do not control for cross-stock correlations, our estimated t-stats 
36:912:77230:27:28:72:523:543:144:Times:144:Times:become -1.37, 0.17, and 3.25, respectively. With these less precise standard errors, one out of 
36:913:77326:28:27:72:521:515:144:Times:144:Times:three events appears to be statistically significant. When we use raw returns as the dependent 
36:914:77421:27:28:72:539:488:144:Times:144:Times:variable (i.e. returns that are not adjusted for the impact of broad market movements, as captured 
36:915:77520:28:28:72:517:460:144:Times:144:Times:by the 3-factor Fama French model), the coefficients and t-statistics (still unadjusted) are 57 
36:916:77616:28:27:72:538:432:144:Times:144:Times:(t=6.47), 26 (t=2.48) and -837 (t=2.91). Using raw rather than factor-adjusted returns amounts to 
36:917:77714:27:28:72:506:405:144:Times:144:Times:ignoring the factor and market exposures of activist-held firms, and is not, in our view, an 
36:918:77807:28:27:72:518:377:144:Times:144:Times:appropriate econometric approach. These differences highlight the importance of addressing 
36:919:77898:27:28:71:522:350:144:Times:144:Times:econometric concerns related to cross-correlation when dealing with individual stock returns. 
36:920:77992:28:27:108:541:322:144:Times:144:Times:Regardless of the underlying explanations for the difference between our findings and the 
36:921:78082:27:28:72:508:295:144:Times:144:Times:prior work, our paper, along with Cohn et al., challenges the conventional wisdom that the 
36:922:78173:28:28:72:531:267:144:Times:144:Times:market believed that shareholder access reduced equity values.   The causal mechanism for this 
36:923:78268:28:27:72:531:239:144:Times:144:Times:alternative view is straightforward: enhancing activist investors’ voice in corporate governance 
36:924:78365:27:28:72:497:212:144:Times:144:Times:increases firm value.  This value effect was a consistent theme among proponents of the 
36:925:78453:28:27:72:509:184:144:Times:144:Times:shareholder access Rule during the SEC’s comment period.   For example, Roy Katzovicz, 
36:926:78540:27:28:72:500:157:144:Times:144:Times:general counsel for Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital, noted in his comment letter: 
36:927:78628:28:14:108:483:129:144:Times:144:Times:Engaged shareholders with meaningful stakes in the companies in which they 
36:928:78703:14:14:107:504:115:144:Times:144:Times:invest have the potential to regulate corporate conduct through private and market 
36:929:78786:14:15:107:475:101:144:Times:144:Times:behavior.  The existing tools of shareholder engagement, however, have not 
36:930:78861:15:8:216:219:86:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
36:931:78909:8:0:72:267:78:42:Times:100:Times:41 These dates are included in Cohn et al (2011). 
37:932:78962:0:13:107:474:708:144:Times:144:Times:proven to be sufficient or optimally suited for that task.  We believe that the 
37:933:79042:13:14:107:493:695:144:Times:144:Times:SEC’s proposal to require public companies to include shareholder nominees in 
37:934:79120:14:14:107:495:681:144:Times:144:Times:corporate proxy materials goes a long way toward better equipping shareholders 
37:935:79199:14:14:107:502:667:144:Times:144:Times:to be more effective monitors of corporate behavior and, as a result, another force 
37:936:79283:14:14:107:269:653:144:Times:144:Times:for good corporate governance.42

37:939:79315:14:28:107:536:612:144:Times:144:Times:An alternative interpretation is that activist investors “dumped” shares on October 4.  As 
37:940:79406:28:27:72:540:584:144:Times:144:Times:a starting point in assessing this claim, we find no evidence (in unreported analyses) of abnormal 
37:941:79505:27:28:72:530:557:144:Times:144:Times:trading volumes on October 4, either overall or at companies that would have been particularly 
37:942:79600:28:28:72:528:529:144:Times:144:Times:vulnerable to the Rule.  Indeed, it would be unusual for an activist investor to have held shares 
37:943:79698:28:27:72:516:501:144:Times:144:Times:for three years in anticipation of proxy access, and then to have dumped shares within hours 
37:944:79791:27:28:72:535:474:144:Times:144:Times:when there was a delay in gaining access to this right.  But even taking this theory at face value, 
37:945:79891:28:27:72:542:446:144:Times:144:Times:it would be important to understand why activist investors dumped shares.  If they did so because 
37:946:79989:27:28:72:489:419:144:Times:144:Times:their future voice had been unexpectedly reduced and therefore future cash flows were 
37:947:80075:28:28:72:539:391:144:Times:144:Times:diminished, then this motivation would be consistent with the conclusion that shareholder access 
37:948:80172:28:27:72:531:363:144:Times:144:Times:improves firm equity value.   If instead activists dumped shares because they would be delayed 
37:949:80267:27:28:72:528:336:144:Times:144:Times:in their ability to extract private benefits at the expense of other shareholders and the company 
37:950:80365:28:27:72:519:308:144:Times:144:Times:overall, then this motivation would be consistent with the conclusion that shareholder access 
37:951:80459:27:28:72:507:281:144:Times:144:Times:reduces firm equity value.   As above, our analyses thus far cannot rule out this alternative 
37:952:80553:28:28:72:134:253:144:Times:144:Times:explanation.

37:958:80841:11:12:72:501:97:100:Times:100:Times:engaged in voting proxies in the interest of our funds’ shareholders, we support a process which allows for 
37:959:80949:12:11:72:528:85:100:Times:100:Times:meaningful director elections, particularly in cases where corporate boards historically have been unresponsive to 
37:960:81064:11:0:72:152:74:100:Times:100:Times:investor concerns.” 
38:961:81087:0:27:107:519:708:144:Times:144:Times:This paper uses a relatively clean natural experiment to assess the shareholder wealth 
38:962:81174:27:28:71:527:681:144:Times:144:Times:implications of shareholder proxy access.  Contrary to the prior event studies on proxy access, 
38:963:81270:28:27:71:504:653:144:Times:144:Times:we find significant negative abnormal returns for companies that were most vulnerable to 
38:964:81359:27:28:71:523:626:144:Times:144:Times:shareholder access on October 4, 2010, when the SEC unexpectedly delayed proxy access for 
38:965:81449:28:28:71:523:598:144:Times:144:Times:U.S. public companies.  We find directionally similar, but slightly smaller, results on July 22, 
38:966:81546:28:27:71:510:570:144:Times:144:Times:2011, when the D.C. Circuit ruled in favor of the Business Roundtable.  These findings are 
38:967:81637:27:28:71:534:543:144:Times:144:Times:consistent with the view that financial markets placed a positive value on shareholder access, as 
38:968:81735:28:27:71:530:515:144:Times:144:Times:implemented in the SEC’s 2010 Rule.  The difference between our result and earlier work may 
38:969:81827:27:28:71:532:488:144:Times:144:Times:reflect different methodologies, and in particular the different events used.  Our view is that the 
38:970:81927:28:28:71:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:October 4 announcement makes a particularly useful event for empirical work because it was 
38:971:82018:28:27:71:225:432:144:Times:144:Times:both material and unexpected.   
38:972:82050:27:28:107:530:405:144:Times:144:Times:Our results might be useful to shareholders in determining how to vote on proxy access 
38:973:82137:28:27:71:510:377:144:Times:144:Times:proposals under the current regime.  In addition, because the D.C. Circuit did not reach the 
38:974:82230:27:28:71:538:350:144:Times:144:Times:Business Roundtable’s constitutional challenges, it remains possible that the SEC might propose 
38:975:82326:28:27:71:534:322:144:Times:144:Times:a new proxy access rule in the future.  Prior to the announcement of the D.C. Circuit’s decision, 
38:976:82424:27:28:71:540:295:144:Times:144:Times:the New York Times observed that “the lack of empirical evidence at the time the S.E.C. made its 
38:977:82521:28:28:71:540:267:144:Times:144:Times:decision will be an issue in the District of Columbia court case.”   Our results might contribute to 
38:978:82622:28:27:71:537:239:144:Times:144:Times:addressing this perceived deficiency if the SEC were to return to the issue of proxy access in the 
38:979:82721:27:0:71:106:212:144:Times:144:Times:future.
