2:33:1725:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:Existing  models  of  structural  change  typically  assume  that  all  of  investment  is  produced  in 
2:34:1830:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:manufacturing. This  assumption  is  strongly  counterfactual:  in  the  postwar  US,  the  share  of 
2:35:1931:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:services value added in investment expenditure has been steadily growing and it now exceeds 0.5. 
2:36:2027:14:14:72:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:We  build  a  new  model, which  takes  a  unified  approach  to  structural  change  in  investment  and 
2:37:2132:14:14:71:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:consumption.   Our   unified   approach leads   to   three   new   insights:   technological   change   is 
2:38:2238:14:14:71:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:endogenously investment specific; having constant TFP growth in all sectors is inconsistent with 
2:39:2334:14:14:71:546:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:structural  change  and  aggregate  balanced  growth  occurring jointly;  the  sector  with  the  slowest 
2:40:2439:14:14:71:545:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:TFP  growth  absorbs  all  resources  asymptotically.  We  also  provide empirical  support  from  the 
2:41:2541:14:28:71:269:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:postwar US for the first and third insight.

3:63:3028:0:30:71:190:762:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:1    Introduction
3:64:3045:30:18:71:523:732:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:A large, recent literature has proposed extensions of the one-sector growth model in order to
3:65:3138:18:18:71:523:714:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:jointly  study  growth  and  structural  change.   While  the  standard  framework  in  the  literature
3:66:3241:18:18:71:523:696:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:allows  for  multiple  consumption  goods  and  structural  change  among  the  sectors  producing
3:67:3339:18:18:71:523:678:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:them, it abstracts from structural change within investment and assumes instead that all invest-
3:68:3435:18:18:71:523:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ment reflects value added from the manufacturing sector.1Given that one popular use of these
3:69:3527:18:18:71:523:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:models is to help us understand the decline of the manufacturing sector observed in advanced
3:70:3619:18:18:71:523:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:economies, it seems important to assess the assumption that all investment reflects value added
3:71:3714:18:18:71:523:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from the manufacturing sector.  In this paper we show that the standard assumption is strongly
3:72:3808:18:18:71:523:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:counterfactual and has important implications for the model’s predictions.  In other words, we
3:73:3902:18:17:71:523:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:show that abstracting from structural change in investment is neitherempirically plausiblenor
3:74:3995:17:18:71:186:553:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:B:theoretically innocuous.
3:75:4019:18:18:88:523:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our analysis begins by presenting a decomposition of final investment expenditures in the
3:76:4108:18:18:71:523:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:post WWII US into the value added shares coming from the goods sector and the services sector.
3:77:4202:18:18:71:523:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This analysis is the analogue of the analysis of final consumption expenditure in Herrendorf et
3:78:4297:18:18:71:523:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:al. (2013). Two key findings emerge. First, although it is true that the share of goods value added
3:79:4396:18:18:71:523:463:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:has always been much higher in investment expenditure than in consumption expenditure, we
3:80:4485:18:18:71:523:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:show that the standard assumption is squarely at odds with the data.  Specifically, the share of
3:81:4581:18:18:71:523:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:services value-added in investment expenditure is large, and in fact now exceeds the share of
3:82:4674:18:18:71:523:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:goods value added in investment expenditure. Second, and more importantly, there is structural
3:83:4768:18:18:71:523:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:change within the investment sector and it features the same qualitative patterns as structural
3:84:4863:18:18:71:523:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:change within the consumption sector:  the expenditure share of services has increased at the
3:85:4956:18:18:71:348:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:same time that the relative price of services has increased.
3:86:5016:18:18:88:523:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Motivated  by  these  facts,  we  develop  a  general  equilibrium  model  of  growth  and  struc-
3:87:5114:18:17:71:523:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tural change.  Our framework can accommodate various levels of disaggregation, but, to best
3:88:5205:17:18:71:523:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:highlight the key economic interactions, our core analysis focuses on the simplest two-by-two-
3:89:5299:18:18:71:523:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by-two structure, featuring two final expenditure categories (investment and consumption), two
3:90:5393:18:18:71:523:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:underlying sectors that produce value added (goods and services), and two factor inputs in the
3:91:5487:18:18:71:523:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:production of value added (capital and labor). Final investment and final consumption are pro-
3:92:5581:18:18:71:523:230:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:duced by combining value added from the goods and services sectors which are in turn produced
3:93:5674:18:18:71:523:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by labor and capital. Notably, we take a unified approach and treat the production of consump-
3:94:5768:18:18:71:523:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tion and investment in a symmetric manner by assuming that each is a CES aggregator of goods
3:95:5860:18:18:71:492:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and services value added, with possibly different weights and elasticities of substitution.
3:96:5951:18:18:88:523:158:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Having developed our new model, we proceed to examine the properties of its equilibrium.
3:97:6039:18:16:85:523:140:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:1This  practice  started  with  the  early  models  of  growth  and  structural  change  by  Echevarria  (1997)  and
3:98:6155:16:12:71:523:124:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:Kongsamut et al. (2001).   See Herrendorf et al. (2014) for a review of the literature on structural change that
3:99:6267:12:11:71:523:112:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:has emerged since then. An important recent exception is Garcia-Santana et al. (2016), which we discuss in more
3:100:6378:11:0:71:122:101:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:detail below.
4:101:6392:0:18:71:523:762:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We show that our framework allows for a two-step procedure for analyzing structural change
4:102:6482:18:18:71:523:744:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and balanced growth.  Specifically, one can first analyze balanced growth focusing purely on
4:103:6574:18:18:71:523:726:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:aggregate consumption and investment, and then exam structural change after balanced growth
4:104:6665:18:18:71:523:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:has been established.   Key to this result is establishing the importance of a concept we call
4:105:6759:18:18:71:523:690:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:B:effective TFPfor the investment sector.  This result generalizes the result in Herrendorf et al.
4:106:6855:18:17:71:523:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(2014) to a setting that also allows for structural change in investment.  We provide necessary
4:107:6950:17:18:71:418:655:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and sufficient conditions for a generalized balanced growth path to exist.
4:108:7024:18:18:88:523:637:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Structural  change  within  each  of  consumption  and  investment  is  dictated  by  a  standard
4:109:7121:18:18:71:523:619:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:force:  changes in relative prices combined with a less than unitary elasticity implies that ex-
4:110:7217:18:18:71:523:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:penditure shares increase for the input whose relative price increases. We call this the intensive
4:111:7315:18:18:71:523:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:margin of structural change.  If investment and consumption have different value added shares
4:112:7408:18:18:71:523:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of goods and services, aggregate structural change can occur also via an extensive margin. The
4:113:7502:18:18:71:523:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:extensive margin results from changes in the mix of consumption and investment, which lead
4:114:7592:18:18:71:523:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to structural change because investment and consumption have different value added mixes of
4:115:7683:18:18:71:523:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:goods and services value added.  We show that along a balanced growth path there is no ad-
4:116:7773:18:18:71:523:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:justment along the extensive margin,  so that all structural change comes from the intensive
4:117:7865:18:18:71:108:475:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:margin.
4:118:7872:18:18:88:523:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Taking a unified approach to structural change in investment and consumption leads to dis-
4:119:7962:18:18:71:523:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tinct conclusions along several key dimensions. In particular, three key insights emerge. First,
4:120:8058:18:17:71:523:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for empirically plausible parameter values, technological change is endogenously investment
4:121:8149:17:18:71:523:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:specific. Second, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a balanced
4:122:8245:18:18:71:523:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:growth path and show that constant (but possibly different) growth in each of the three TFP
4:123:8336:18:18:71:523:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:terms is inconsistent with structural change and aggregate balanced growth occurring jointly.
4:124:8429:18:18:71:468:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Third, the sector with the slowest TFP growth absorbs all resources asymptotically.
4:125:8512:18:18:88:523:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The CES aggregators in the consumption and investment sectors of our simple framework
4:126:8597:18:18:71:523:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are admittedly somewhat specialized, and so there may be concern about how well our speci-
4:127:8687:18:18:71:523:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fication performs quantitatively.  We show that it can quantitatively capture most of the salient
4:128:8784:18:18:71:523:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:features of structural change in the US data in the post WWII period, with the best fit coming
4:129:8878:18:18:71:523:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from a specification in which there is little scope for substitution between goods and services
4:130:8973:18:18:71:523:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the production of both investment and consumption.  This result extends the earlier analysis
4:131:9068:18:18:71:523:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of Herrendorf et al. (2013) to the case of structural change within the investment sector.  This
4:132:9164:18:18:71:432:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:specification captures structural change within investment remarkably well.
4:133:9239:18:18:88:523:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We also carry out an empirical assessment of our theoretical condition that is necessary
4:134:9327:18:17:71:523:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for balanced growth.  Our theoretical condition places a non-linear restriction on the evolution
4:135:9423:17:18:71:523:153:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the sectoral TFPs in our model.  We estimate the sectoral TFP growth rates using standard
4:136:9515:18:18:71:523:135:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:growth accounting methods and evaluate the extent to which our theoretical condition holds
4:137:9605:18:0:71:523:117:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the role of changes in each of the sectoral TFPs.  We find that our theoretical condition
5:138:9699:0:18:71:523:762:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:holds approximately in the data. Interestingly, however, it holds despite the fact that the growth
5:139:9797:18:18:71:523:744:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rates of the sectoral TFP terms vary quite dramatically over time.  This suggests that, contrary
5:140:9893:18:18:71:523:726:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to common practice,  constant growth of sectoral TFPs is not a natural restriction to impose
5:141:9985:18:18:71:523:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on  the  parameters  in  the  context  of  balanced  growth  in  multi-sector  models.   We  also  find
5:142:10088:18:18:71:523:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that quantitatively most of the investment-specific technological change arises endogenously.
5:143:10181:18:17:71:523:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We conclude from this finding that our first insight (“technological change is endogenously
5:144:10272:17:18:71:353:655:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investment biased”) is far more than a theoretical curiosity.
5:145:10333:18:18:88:523:637:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our work is closely related to a recent paper by Garcia-Santana et al. (2016).  They also
5:146:10422:18:18:71:523:619:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:begin with the observation that investment is produced by a combination of goods and services
5:147:10515:18:18:71:523:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and that goods represent a higher share of value added for investment than for consumption.
5:148:10606:18:18:71:523:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Despite this similarity, the papers focus on distinct issues. We focus on analytically establishing
5:149:10705:18:18:71:523:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the existence and properties of a generalized balanced growth path with structural change in a
5:150:10799:18:18:71:524:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:B:general equilibrium setting. Structural change in our analysis arises entirely from theintensive
5:151:10895:18:18:71:523:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:margin, because we show that along a generalized balanced growth path the extensive margin is
5:152:10988:18:18:71:523:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not operational.  In contrast, they focus on transition dynamics in a partial equilibrium setting,
5:153:11086:18:18:71:523:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and establish empirically that theextensivemargin is a key driver of structural change away
5:154:11177:18:18:71:523:475:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from the balanced growth path.  Specifically, they study how movements in the investment-to-
5:155:11269:18:18:71:523:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:GDP ratio, for example during an investment boom, produce hump-shaped movements in the
5:156:11355:18:18:71:442:439:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:value added share of the manufacturing sector in a large sample of countries.2
5:157:11433:18:17:88:523:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:An outline of the paper follows.  In the next section we present the key facts from the US
5:158:11523:17:18:71:523:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time series data.  Section 3 presents our model and Section 4 characterizes the key properties
5:159:11617:18:18:71:523:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  the  competitive  equilibrium.   Section  5  studies  the  features  of  structural  change  along  a
5:160:11722:18:18:71:523:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:GBGP. Section 6 derives the three insights that result from our unified approach.  Section 7
5:161:11814:18:18:71:523:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:examines key aspects of the model and its theoretical properties from an empirical perspective.
5:162:11909:18:18:71:523:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Section 8 discusses extending the analysis to consider three different categories of investment
5:163:12004:18:46:71:252:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expenditure, and Section 9 concludes.

5:166:12154:18:18:71:523:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and final consumption for the US over the post WWII period. This serves to both complement
5:167:12244:18:18:71:523:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:existing presentations of the stylized facts of structural change and motivate the framework
5:168:12336:18:18:71:524:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that we develop in the next section.3The basic strategy is to combine US industry data from
5:169:12427:18:18:71:523:166:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:WORLD KLEMS with the annual input-output tables from the BEA and to then decompose
5:170:12509:18:12:85:469:148:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:2We will point further, more subtle differences between our work and their work as we go along.
5:171:12604:12:16:85:523:136:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:3Our evidence complements that presented in Garcia-Santana et al. (2016) for 40 developed countries covering
5:172:12712:16:12:71:523:120:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:a recent time period.  Whereas we plot the sectoral shares for a single country (the US) over a long period, they
5:173:12825:12:0:71:501:108:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:pool short time series data for many countries to characterize how sectoral shares vary with GDP per capita.

6:204:13350:18:18:71:523:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:various levels of disaggregation, but to best highlight the novel implications of our analysis we
6:205:13447:18:18:71:523:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consider two final expenditure categories – consumption and investment – and two value-added
6:206:13539:18:18:71:523:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:components – goods and services.   In a later section we present evidence for an alternative
6:207:13631:18:18:71:523:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decomposition in which we consider three categories of investment – structures, equipment and
6:208:13724:18:17:71:210:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intellectual property product.
6:209:13754:17:18:88:523:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In generating these decompositions we define the goods sector to consist of agriculture,
6:210:13842:18:18:71:523:417:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:construction, manufacturing, mining, and public utilities.4Services consists of the remaining
6:211:13935:18:18:71:523:399:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:industries  –  business  services,  government,  personal  services,  transportation,  wholesale  and
6:212:14036:18:18:71:523:381:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:retail trade.  Our analysis in the following sections focuses on the case of a closed economy.
6:213:14130:18:18:71:523:363:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:To connect the closed economy model to the data requires allocating net exports between con-
6:214:14222:18:18:71:523:345:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sumption and investment.  Because net exports are not that large, the rule for allocating them
6:215:14316:18:18:71:523:327:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is not of first-order significance.  In what follows we allocate all of net exports to consump-
6:216:14411:18:18:71:523:309:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tion.  One benefit of this choice is that the notion of investment and capital in the model will
6:217:14507:18:18:71:428:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:correspond to the notion of investment and capital as measured in the data.
6:218:14582:18:18:88:524:273:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We decompose each final expenditure category into the value added from different sectors
6:219:14670:18:18:71:523:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:following the methodology developed in Herrendorf et al. (2013), which involves the use of
6:220:14760:18:18:71:523:237:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:input–output relationships and total requirement matrices.   Note that while in Herrendorf et
6:221:14853:18:18:71:523:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:al. (2013) we decomposed final consumption expenditure into the value added from agricul-
6:222:14942:18:17:71:523:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ture, manufacturing, and services, here we decompose final investment expenditure and final
6:223:15033:17:18:71:523:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consumption expenditure into the value added components produced in the goods and services
6:224:15123:18:16:71:107:166:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sectors.
6:225:15131:16:16:85:523:150:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:4Much of the structural change literature considers three sectors: agriculture, non-agricultural goods (typically
6:226:15244:16:12:71:523:134:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:referred to as manufacturing) and services.  Because we focus on the US during the post World War II period
6:227:15351:12:12:71:523:122:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:when agriculture is relatively unimportant, we have chosen to combine agriculture and manufacturing into a single
6:228:15464:12:0:71:327:110:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:goods producing-sector. We hope that this facilitates exposition.

7:237:15687:187:18:88:523:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Figure 1 shows the key facts for this two–by–two decomposition.  While investment has a
7:238:15774:18:18:71:523:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:significantly higher goods-valued-added share than does consumption, we see that both con-
7:239:15864:18:18:71:523:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sumption and investment exhibit an increase in the services-value-added share and a decrease
7:240:15956:18:18:71:223:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the goods-value-added share.
7:241:15987:18:18:88:523:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We stress three key properties relative to the existing literature on structural change.  First,
7:242:16083:18:17:71:523:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assuming that investment is produced entirely by the goods sector is strongly at odds with the
7:243:16177:17:18:71:523:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:data; in fact, by the end of the sample the goods value added share is less than the services value
7:244:16276:18:18:71:523:417:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:added share in investment.5Second,  the value added shares exhibit important changes over
7:245:16365:18:18:71:523:399:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time in both investment and consumption. This suggests that any analysis of structural change
7:246:16458:18:18:71:523:381:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at the aggregate level needs to confront the reality that structural change occurs both within the
7:247:16556:18:18:71:523:363:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investment–producing sector and the consumption–producing sector.  Third, the value added
7:248:16645:18:18:71:523:345:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shares of goods differ significantly between investment and consumption, suggesting that it is

7:250:16804:18:18:88:523:309:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Because relative prices will play an important role in the analysis to come, we also present
7:251:16896:18:18:71:523:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:evidence on two key relative price movements over time.  In particular, Figure 2 displays time
7:252:16990:18:18:71:523:273:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:series evidence on the prices of services relative to goods and consumption relative to invest-
7:253:17085:18:18:71:523:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ment.  The Figure reveals two key secular trends that are familiar from the existing literature.
7:254:17181:18:18:71:523:237:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:First, there has been a marked increase in the price of services relative to goods. The somewhat
7:255:17277:18:18:71:523:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unusual behavior of this relative price in the 1970s is driven by a dramatic spike in the prices
7:256:17373:18:17:71:523:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of agricultural products and oil during the early 1970s.  While this suggests that a more de-
7:257:17466:17:18:71:523:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tailed analysis might warrant further disaggregation, the somewhat anomalous behavior of the
7:258:17558:18:18:71:523:166:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1970s should not distract us from the clear secular trend over the entire postwar period. Second,
7:259:17655:18:18:71:523:148:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:there is also a marked increase in the price of consumption relative to investment. Notably, the
7:260:17751:18:16:85:523:130:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:5As noted in Herrendorf et al. (2013), a different but related problem with the standard assumption is that in
7:261:17861:16:0:71:470:114:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:recent years, the value of US investment has exceeded the value added produced in the goods sector.
8:262:17961:0:18:71:523:762:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:behavior is quite distinct between the pre- and post-1980 periods, with little trend in the first
8:263:18058:18:46:71:373:744:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:subperiod and a marked positive trend in the second subperiod.

8:265:18130:30:18:71:523:668:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We build a multi-sector extension of the standard one-sector neoclassical growth model, formu-
8:266:18224:18:18:71:523:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lated in continuous time. Motivated by the presentation in the previous section, our approach is
8:267:18320:18:18:71:523:632:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to start with sectoral valued-added production functions and to model the production for final
8:268:18414:18:18:71:374:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expenditure categories by aggregating the sectoral value added.
8:269:18477:18:18:88:524:596:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Specifically, we assume that goods and services value added (denoted byYgtandYst, re-
8:270:18562:18:18:71:523:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spectively) are each produced according to Cobb-Douglas production functions with the same
8:271:18652:18:33:71:404:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:capital shares but potentially different rates of technological progress:

8:274:18838:18:18:71:523:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the underlying production functions are Cobb-Douglas with identical capital shares is common
8:275:18930:18:18:71:523:459:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:in the literature on structural change, as it allows for the existence of a balanced growth path.6
8:276:19028:18:18:71:523:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Moreover, Herrendorf et al. (2015) show that this case also does a reasonable job of replicating
8:277:19124:18:18:71:324:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the labor allocation across sectors in the postwar US.

9:325:20556:18:18:88:523:726:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:While these CES specifications are analytically convenient, we show later that they also do
9:326:20647:18:18:71:523:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a reasonable job of capturing the empirical patterns presented in the previous section.  A key
9:327:20741:18:18:71:523:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:feature of our model is that we treat the production of consumption and investment symmetri-
9:328:20833:18:17:71:96:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cally.
9:329:20839:17:18:88:523:655:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We make two remarks concerning the specification forCt. First, our consumption aggrega-
9:330:20926:18:18:71:523:637:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tor is homothetic. The literature has argued that non-homotheticities account for at least part of
9:331:21024:18:18:71:523:619:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the structural change in consumption and, as we will see in Section 7, our specification will not
9:332:21121:18:18:71:524:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be able to account for all of the structural change within consumption.8We nonetheless adopt
9:333:21213:18:18:71:523:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a homothetic aggregator for consumption because it allows us to better focus on the novel im-
9:334:21306:18:18:71:523:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:plications of our formulation of investment. Importantly, our specification does a very good job
9:335:21402:18:18:71:389:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of capturing structural change within final investment expenditure.
9:336:21469:18:18:88:523:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Second, it does not matter whether we think of the household buying goods and services
9:337:21555:18:18:71:523:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the market and combining them itself to produceCt,  or alternatively,  that a stand-in firm
9:338:21649:18:18:71:523:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:purchases goods and services, combines them into the aggregateCt, and then sells the aggregate
9:339:21743:18:18:71:523:475:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consumption good to the household. The advantage of the latter formulation is that it provides
9:340:21837:18:18:71:523:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an explicit market price for the consumption aggregate, which will be useful for the analysis
9:341:21930:18:18:71:523:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that follows.  We will therefore view relationship (1) as a production function for a firm that
9:342:22025:18:17:71:180:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:operates in the market.

10:367:23596:18:18:71:426:588:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:concept is standard, we do not provide a formal definition of equilibrium.9
10:368:23671:18:17:88:523:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the remainder of this section, we provide a partial characterization of the equilibrium. We
10:369:23765:17:18:71:523:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:first derive analytic expressions for the prices of the four outputs in terms of model primitives.
10:370:23863:18:18:71:523:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:As a by product of the first step we also generate expressions for relative expenditure shares on

10:372:24056:18:18:71:523:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:representations to characterize production in equilibrium that provide a connection between our
10:373:24151:18:40:71:391:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model and more standard two-sector versions of the growth model.

10:375:24235:26:18:71:523:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We start with the first-order conditions for capital and labor for the two firms producing goods
10:376:24331:18:33:71:290:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and services. Forj∈{g,s}these are given by:

10:388:24538:36:18:71:523:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:It follows that capital-labor ratios are equalized.  Given that aggregate labor is one, it follows

10:397:24796:27:16:85:523:142:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:9Because the equilibrium allocation of our model is efficient, we could instead study the planner problem. But
10:398:24906:16:12:71:523:126:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:since the evidence on relative prices in Figure 2 provides important information regarding parameter values, it is
10:399:25020:12:0:71:277:114:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:useful to study the competitive equilibrium directly.
11:400:25074:0:18:71:523:762:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This is a standard result in the structural change literature when the sector production functions

11:402:25227:18:18:88:523:726:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Next we derive expressions forPctandPxtin terms ofPgtandPst.  To do this we use the
11:403:25310:18:18:71:523:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fact that constant-returns-to-scale production functions imply that profits must equal zero in a
11:404:25406:18:18:71:523:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:competitive equilibrium.  It follows thatPctmust equal the minimum cost to produce a unit of
11:405:25498:18:17:71:523:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consumption, and similarly thatPxt(which is normalized to one) must equal the minimum cost
11:406:25588:17:35:71:403:655:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of producing a unit of investment. Straightforward calculation yields:

12:496:27423:26:18:71:523:518:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Our formulation of technology involved a two-level structure in which we started with value-
12:497:27515:18:18:71:523:500:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:added production functions for goods and services, and then produced final-expenditure cate-
12:498:27607:18:18:71:523:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:gories by combining valued added from the goods and services sectors. A common alternative
12:499:27697:18:18:71:523:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:formulation of the two-sector growth model is to directly posit value added productions for
12:500:27788:18:51:71:475:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:each of consumption and investment. More concretely, this approach would assume:
12:501:27868:51:21:253:333:395:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:C:Ct= ̃ActKθctL1−θct
12:502:27886:21:32:254:334:374:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:C:Xt= ̃AxtKθxtL1−θxt
12:503:27904:32:18:71:523:342:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:A simple prediction of this model is that in equilibrium, the price of consumption relative to
12:504:27998:18:18:71:523:324:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investment is equal to ̃Axt/ ̃Act, so that relative TFP growth of the two sectors can be inferred
12:505:28095:18:18:71:523:306:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:directly from data on relative price changes. Additionally, a balanced growth path exists as long
12:506:28192:18:18:71:217:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as ̃Axtgrows at a constant rate.
12:507:28224:18:18:88:523:270:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This formulation abstracts from the process of structural transformation, a feature that is the
12:508:28319:18:18:71:523:252:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:focus of our analysis. However, because the analysis of balanced growth is well established in
12:509:28413:18:18:71:523:234:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this setting it is instructive to provide a connection between this formulation and our two-level
12:510:28510:18:18:71:322:216:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:formulation, a task that we turn to in this subsection.
12:511:28565:18:18:88:523:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To develop this connection we derive the mappings between equilibrium inputs of capital
12:512:28652:18:18:71:523:180:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and labor to equilibrium outputs of consumption and investment. Intuitively, given equilibrium
12:513:28746:18:18:71:523:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prices,  we can solve for the optimal input mix of goods and services for each ofCandX.
12:514:28833:18:17:71:523:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Because we know the equilibrium capital-labor ratios in each of goods and services, we can
12:515:28923:17:18:71:523:127:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:then infer the relative inputs of capital and labor used to produce the optimal mix of goods and
12:516:29019:18:0:71:442:109:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:services in each ofCandX. The next proposition characterizes this mapping.
13:517:29095:0:33:71:374:762:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:C:Proposition 1Along any equilibrium path, the following hold:

13:544:29374:18:17:88:523:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The two expressions (14) and (15) have the appearance of production functions, with the
13:545:29461:17:18:71:523:547:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f3:B:Ajtas  TFPs.   But  because  they  are  relations  that  hold  only  in  equilibrium  we  will  refer  to
13:546:29566:18:18:71:523:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:them aspseudo production functionsand we will refer to theAjtaseffective TFPs. Our model
13:547:29654:18:18:71:523:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:posits Cobb-Douglas production functions at the sector level, whose outputs are aggregated in
13:548:29747:18:18:71:523:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:non-linear ways to produce final consumption and final investment. Interestingly, these pseudo-
13:549:29842:18:18:71:523:475:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:production functions show that the Cobb-Douglas property is preserved with regard to inputs of
13:550:29936:18:18:71:523:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:labor and capital and that the non-linear aggregation only affects the expressions for effective
13:551:30032:18:18:71:99:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:TFPs.
13:552:30037:18:34:88:479:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Note that given the definition of the effective TFPs, equation (11) is equivalent to:
13:553:30122:34:0:272:297:387:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f5:C:Pct=

13:557:30133:35:17:71:523:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which is the analogue of the result that holds in the more standard formulation of the two-sector
13:558:30230:17:18:71:524:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:growth model.  Importantly, and a point that we will return to later, the ratio of effective TFPs
13:559:30327:18:18:71:523:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is a non-linear function of all three TFPs in our model, and is not the same asAxt, the TFP for
13:560:30422:18:18:71:309:299:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:production of investment relative to consumption.
13:561:30471:18:18:88:523:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:It is also instructive to derive another pseudo production function, this one for aggregate
13:562:30562:18:18:71:523:263:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:final output, where we define aggregate final output as measured in units of final investment:
13:563:30656:18:18:71:523:245:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:B:Yt=Xt+PctCt.11In the context of the standard two sector model it is easy to show that one
13:564:30745:18:18:71:523:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:obtainsYt= ̃AxtKθt.   See,  for example the derivations in Herrendorf et al. (2014).   We next
13:565:30839:18:18:71:523:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:develop the analogous relationship for our model.  Because payments to inputs will exhaust
13:566:30929:18:33:71:495:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:income for each of the investment- and consumption-producing firms, we can also write:
13:567:31015:33:19:130:465:158:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f12:C:Yt=PgtXgt+PstXst+PgtCgt+PstCst=Pgt(Xgt+Cgt)+Pst(Cst+Xst).
13:568:31072:19:15:81:523:139:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:11Duernecker et al. (2017a) stress that this is not the way in which output is defined in NIPA and that one needs
13:569:31185:15:12:71:523:124:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:to be careful when mapping model output into data output. We nonetheless use this definition of output because it
13:570:31298:12:0:71:511:112:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:allows us to analytically characterize the equilibrium path of the model as a generalized balanced growth path.

14:613:32318:18:18:71:523:378:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:difference is that in our framework the level of effective TFP in the investment sector is a non-

15:626:33028:26:18:71:523:736:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The dimension of structural change that concerns us is the composition of aggregate economic
15:627:33120:18:18:71:523:718:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:activity across goods and services.  This can be measured either as changes in sectoral value
15:628:33213:18:18:71:523:700:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:added shares or changes in sectoral employment shares.  In our model these two measures are
15:629:33304:18:18:71:523:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:identical in equilibrium, a property shared by many models in the literature.  To see this, note
15:630:33400:18:18:71:523:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that the nominal value added shares for goods and services, which we denote asVjt(j∈{g,s}),

16:717:34993:18:18:71:523:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:final consumption and final investment. We call this the intensive margin of structural change,

16:722:35391:18:18:88:523:509:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:From the perspective of the overall economy,  structural change is also potentially influ-
16:723:35481:18:17:71:523:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:enced by the extensive margin that arises from changes in the composition of final expenditure
16:724:35575:17:18:71:523:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:between investment and consumption.  If the final expenditure shares are constant over time,
16:725:35667:18:18:71:523:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:then the above effects imply that labor is moving systematically from the goods-producing sec-
16:726:35761:18:18:71:523:438:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tor to the services-producing sector. But if there is a change in final expenditure shares between
16:727:35859:18:18:71:523:420:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consumption and investment, then one cannot infer the nature of structural change without addi-
16:728:35954:18:18:71:523:402:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tional assumptions. This is because expenditure could be reallocated to investment – the sector
16:729:36049:18:18:71:523:384:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with a higher goods share – at a sufficiently high rate so that the overall goods share could rise
16:730:36147:18:18:71:273:366:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:even though it declines within each sector.
16:731:36190:18:18:88:523:348:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the next subsection we show that along a generalized balanced growth path (GBGP), the
16:732:36278:18:18:71:523:330:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:final expenditure shares are indeed constant so that only the intensive margin operates and the
16:733:36373:18:18:71:523:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nature of structural change along such a path can be inferred without additional assumptions. In
16:734:36469:18:18:71:523:294:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:contrast, Garcia-Santana et al. (2016) focus on changes in the extensive margin associated with
16:735:36564:18:18:71:523:276:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dynamics away from the balanced growth path. Specifically, they show that investment booms
16:736:36654:18:39:71:500:258:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:associated with high growth episodes can give rise to hump-shaped manufacturing shares.

16:738:36775:26:18:71:523:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We previously derived properties that will hold along any equilibrium path.  In this subsection
16:739:36870:18:18:71:523:175:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we  examine  the  properties  of  our  model  along  a  GBGP.  As  mentioned  in  the  introduction,
16:740:36970:18:18:71:523:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:balanced growth is too strict an equilibrium concept to impose in settings with structural change,
16:741:37068:18:18:71:523:139:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:since sectoral labor inputs cannot feasibly grow at a constant yet different rates forever.  The
16:742:37164:18:18:71:523:121:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:termgeneralizedbalanced growth relaxes balanced growth by requiring thataggregatevariables
16:743:37254:18:0:71:523:103:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:grow at constant rates or remain constant without restricting the growth ofsectoralvariables.
17:744:37349:0:18:71:523:762:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We adopt the definition of Kongsamut et al. (2001), who defined a GBGP as an equilibrium
17:745:37437:18:18:71:341:744:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:path along which the rental price of capital is constant.13
17:746:37496:18:18:88:523:726:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To this point, our analysis has only made use of equilibrium conditions from the production
17:747:37587:18:18:71:523:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:side of the economy.  To characterize the properties of a GBGP, we will also need to use the
17:748:37679:18:18:71:523:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equilibrium conditions that arise from the household side of the equilibrium.  The household
17:749:37771:18:32:71:499:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:seeks to maximize the present discounted integral of utility subject to its budget equation:

17:751:37887:33:18:71:523:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:whereEt≡PctCtdenotes consumption expenditure.  Using “hats” to denote growth rates, the
17:752:37974:18:30:71:468:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Euler equation and the transversality condition for the household can be written as:
17:753:38058:30:28:259:523:559:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f3:A:̂Et=Rt−δ−ρ,(22)

17:760:38094:34:18:88:523:497:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The first proposition establishes that if a GBGP exists, it must be the case thatKt,Xt,Yt, and
17:761:38188:18:18:71:523:479:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:B:Etall grow at the same constant rate, which is determined by the right-hand side of the Euler
17:762:38281:18:18:71:523:461:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equation. Note that whereas bothKtandXtare physical quantities, the other two terms –Ytand
17:763:38371:18:30:71:258:443:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:B:Et– include both prices and quantities.
17:764:38410:30:30:71:517:413:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:C:Proposition 2If a GBGP exists and R is the rental rate along the GBGP, then it must be that

17:766:38523:22:18:71:194:361:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:B:Proof.See the Appendix.
17:767:38546:18:18:88:523:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Having established the properties of a GBGP in Proposition 2, we can now revisit the issue
17:768:38636:18:18:71:523:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of structural change along the GBGP. As noted in the previous subsection, although knowing
17:769:38726:18:18:71:523:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the direction of relative price changes for goods and services together with the elasticity of
17:770:38820:18:18:71:524:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:substitution between goods and services in production is sufficient to determine the intensive
17:771:38914:18:18:71:523:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:margins of structural change within consumption and investment individually, changes in the
17:772:39005:18:18:71:523:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:composition  of  final  output  between  consumption  and  investment  could  create  an  opposing
17:773:39103:18:17:71:523:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effect via the extensive margin.  But what we have just shown is that along a GBGP the com-
17:774:39194:17:18:71:523:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:position of final expenditure is constant, and thus there is no opposing effect from composition
17:775:39290:18:30:71:165:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:changes. It follows:
17:776:39310:30:18:71:524:170:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:C:Proposition 3If a GBGP exists,εx,εc∈(0,1), and̂Agt>̂Ast, then the shares of the services
17:777:39398:18:18:71:523:152:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:sector in total value added and total employment will increase over time.   The value added
17:778:39489:18:18:71:519:134:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:share of the services sector will also increase for both final consumption and final investment.
17:779:39585:18:15:81:523:116:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:13This is equivalent to a constant real interest rate, which equals the rental price of capital minus the depreciation
17:780:39703:15:0:71:88:101:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:rate.
18:781:39710:0:18:88:523:762:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The previous propositions characterized what happens along a GBGP assuming that such a
18:782:39796:18:18:71:523:744:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:path exists. The next proposition provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence
18:783:39892:18:25:71:126:726:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of a GBGP.
18:784:39902:25:26:71:421:701:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:C:Proposition 4A GBGP exists if and only ifAxtgrows at a constant rate.
18:785:39971:26:18:88:523:675:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To show the claims of this proposition, we use the pseudo aggregate production function
18:786:40058:18:18:71:163:657:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:derived previously:
18:787:40077:18:26:269:326:639:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f12:C:Yt=AxtKθt.
18:788:40087:26:18:71:523:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Taking the derivative with respect to capital, the requirement that the rental price of capital be
18:789:40185:18:18:71:159:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:constant becomes:
18:790:40202:18:26:250:523:577:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:A:Rt=R=θAxtKθ−1t.(24)
18:791:40221:26:18:71:523:551:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We previously showed that along a GBGP,Ktnecessarily grows at a constant rate.  It follows
18:792:40311:18:18:71:523:533:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:that ifRtis constant thenAxtmust also grow at a constant rate.  Conversely, suppose thatAxt
18:793:40402:18:18:71:523:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:B:grows at a constant rate. Given thatKtmust grow at rateR−δ−ρthere is a unique value ofR
18:794:40489:18:17:71:524:497:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that is consistent with a constant rental rate given the constant growth rate ofAxt.  Evaluating
18:795:40585:17:18:71:523:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equation (24) at time zero pins downK0. A final issue is to guarantee that the present discounted
18:796:40682:18:18:71:523:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:value of utility is finite. With log utility this is indeed the case as long as all of the growth rates
18:797:40785:18:18:71:198:444:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:are bounded from above.14
18:798:40810:18:18:88:523:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:It is worth emphasizing that condition (24) remains surprisingly tractable. In fact, it has the
18:799:40905:18:18:71:523:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:same functional form as the condition for GBGP in the model of Ngai and Pissarides (2007).
18:800:40995:18:18:71:524:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This is surprising given the fundamental difference between their model and our model. Specif-
18:801:41089:18:18:71:523:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ically,  Ngai-Pissarides  assumed  that  all  investment  is  manufacturing  output,  whereas  in  our
18:802:41191:18:18:71:523:354:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model investment is a composite of value added from the goods and services sectors. There are
18:803:41284:18:18:71:523:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:two reasons why the functional form of condition (24) is nonetheless the same in both models.
18:804:41377:18:18:71:523:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The sectoral production functions are of the Cobb-Douglas form with the same capital-share
18:805:41467:18:18:71:523:300:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parameter in both models, implying that in equilibrium the sectoral capital-labor ratios equal
18:806:41561:18:18:71:523:282:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the aggregate capital-labor ratio. This implies that one can aggregate in both models, and so the
18:807:41658:18:18:71:523:264:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:GBGP condition can be written in terms of the aggregate capital-to-labor ratio. For our model,
18:808:41752:18:17:71:523:246:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Proposition 1 above shows that this also implies that investment output can be written in terms
18:809:41847:17:18:71:523:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of a sectoral pseudo-production function of the Cobb-Douglas form with the same share param-
18:810:41939:18:18:71:523:211:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:eter.  Given that the rental price of capital is the derivative of that sectoral pseudo-production
18:811:42037:18:18:71:523:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:function with respect to capital, sectoral variables enter the GBGP condition only through the
18:812:42131:18:18:71:523:175:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effective TFP term and the sectoral composition does not enter the GBGP condition at all. This
18:813:42225:18:17:71:361:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equilibrium property makes our model analytically tractable.
18:814:42285:17:16:81:523:140:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:14To see this note that with log utility, the present value of discounted utility is finite as long as the growth rate
18:815:42403:16:12:71:523:124:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:of consumption is bounded.  Given thatAxtgrows at a constant rate, the growth rate of consumption is bounded
18:816:42511:12:11:71:524:112:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:by the difference between this growth rate and the growth of the price of consumption relative to investment. If all
18:817:42627:11:0:71:333:101:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:TFP growth rates are bounded then this rate will also be bounded.
19:818:42694:0:18:88:523:762:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Put somewhat differently, our analysis shows that one can study structural change separately
19:819:42786:18:18:71:523:744:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from balanced growth.  That is, the analysis of balanced growth relies sole on the pseudo pro-
19:820:42880:18:18:71:523:726:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:duction functions for aggregate consumption and investment, just as in a standard two-sector
19:821:42972:18:18:71:523:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model.  Conditional on establishing a balanced growth path, one can then analyze structural
19:822:43063:18:18:71:523:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:B:change.  This result requires that one identifies the important role played byAxt, theeffective
19:823:43158:18:46:71:211:672:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:B:TFPof the investment sector.

19:825:43231:30:18:71:523:596:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In  this  section,  we  present  three  insights  that  arise  from  our  unified  approach  to  structural
19:826:43338:18:18:71:523:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:change  in  investment  and  consumption.   As  mentioned  in  the  introduction,  these  are:  that
19:827:43438:18:18:71:523:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:technical change is endogenously investment-biased;  that constant TFP growth in all sectors
19:828:43530:18:18:71:523:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is inconsistent with structural change and aggregate balanced growth; and that the sector with
19:829:43624:18:18:71:523:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the slowest TFP growth absorbs all resources asymptotically. Although we derived a represen-
19:830:43716:18:17:71:523:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tation of our model that makes it appear like a standard two-sector model, the first two insights
19:831:43813:17:18:71:523:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are in direct contrast to the predictions of that model. In both cases the key point that explains
19:832:43911:18:18:71:524:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the divergence in predictions is that the effective TFPs in our two-sector representation are in
19:833:44007:18:18:71:523:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:turn non-linear functions of the three primitive TFPs.   The third insight relates to structural
19:834:44103:18:18:71:523:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:change and so has no counterpart in the standard two sector model. But our result is in contrast
19:835:44199:18:40:71:458:417:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to models of structural change that abstract from structural change in investment.

19:848:44535:35:18:71:524:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:As noted previously, in the standard two-sector model one obtains thatPct= ̃Axt/ ̃Act, i.e., the
19:849:44631:18:18:71:523:230:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relative price of consumption equals the TFP of the investment sector relative to the consump-
19:850:44725:18:18:71:523:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tion sector. The change in ̃Axt/ ̃Actover time is a measure of investment-biased technical change,
19:851:44823:18:18:71:523:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the previous result says that relative price movements directly reflect this bias in technical
19:852:44921:18:18:71:108:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:change.
19:853:44928:18:18:88:523:158:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:One can see from equation (11) that in the special case in whichωc=ωxandεc=εx, our
19:854:45010:18:18:71:523:140:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model would similarly predict thatPct=Axt. Recall that since we have normalizedActto unity,
19:855:45101:18:18:71:523:122:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this has the same form as in the standard model.  But in general, our model features additional
19:856:45196:18:0:71:523:104:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:forces that impact on this relative price and one cannot say whether the additional forces lead
20:857:45293:0:18:71:523:762:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to higher or lower growth inPct. But for now, consider the case in whichωx> ωc,εc=εxand
20:858:45380:18:18:71:523:744:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:B:Agtgrows faster thanAst. We argue later that this specification is empirically reasonable. In this
20:859:45478:18:18:71:524:726:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:case, equation (11) implies thatPctwould increase even absent any change inAxt. This effect is
20:860:45572:18:18:71:524:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:driven by theendogenousinput choices for the firms producing consumption and investment.
20:861:45660:18:18:71:523:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Because the investment producing firmchooses to have a greater ratio of goods to services, a
20:862:45752:18:17:71:523:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:given decrease in the relative price of goods leads to a greater decline in their minimum cost and
20:863:45850:17:18:71:523:655:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hence a decline in their relative price.  Because the literature has identified investment biased
20:864:45947:18:18:71:523:637:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:technical change with the exogenous movements inAxtwe refer to this additional channel in
20:865:46036:18:18:71:524:619:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:our model asendogenous investment biased technical change.15We note that this result holds
20:866:46126:18:18:71:428:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:along any equilibrium path and is not restricted to behavior along a GBGP.
20:867:46200:18:18:88:523:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:As additional perspective on this result, recall that we also showed that the equilibrium price
20:868:46295:18:18:71:523:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of consumption relative to investment is the inverse of theeffectiveTFP levels in our pseudo
20:869:46387:18:18:71:523:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:production functions.  Importantly, exogenous investment-biased technical change (i.e.,Axt) is
20:870:46481:18:18:71:230:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:only one component of this ratio.
20:871:46514:18:18:88:523:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Garcia-Santana et al. (2016) also note that the price of investment relative to consumption
20:872:46605:18:18:71:523:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is influenced by the relative prices of the outputs of the underlying sectors in addition to exoge-
20:873:46704:18:18:71:523:475:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nous investment specific technical change.  Our analysis goes one level deeper by linking this
20:874:46798:18:39:71:520:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relative price to underlying TFP levels.16Below, we will evaluate this mechanism empirically.
20:875:46891:39:26:71:369:418:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:6.2    Insight 2: Sectoral TFP Growth and GBGP
20:876:46937:26:18:71:524:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In the standard model, all that is required for the existence of a GBGP is that ̃Axtgrows at a
20:877:47031:18:16:71:523:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:constant rate that is not too large.  In particular, one can look for a GBGP assuming that both
20:878:47126:16:20:74:523:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: ̃Axtand ̃Actgrow at constant rates. Put somewhat differently, one can impose that all TFPs grow
20:879:47222:20:18:71:523:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at constant but potentially different rates when looking for a GBGP. While our model has the
20:880:47314:18:18:71:523:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:seemingly analogous requirement that constant growth inAxtis required, it turns out that his
20:881:47406:18:18:71:523:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:has a very different implication for what is allowed for the primitive TFPs.  In particular, the
20:882:47502:18:18:71:523:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:next Proposition establishes that constant though potentially different growth rates in all TFPs
20:883:47598:18:31:71:363:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are inconsistent with a GBGP that exhibits structural change.
20:884:47659:31:18:71:523:235:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:C:Proposition 5Ifεx,1,  a  necessary  condition  for  the  existence  of  a  BGP  with  structural
20:885:47755:18:19:71:423:217:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:change is that at least one of the growth rateŝAxt,̂Agt,̂Astis not constant.
20:886:47832:19:12:81:381:198:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:15In the introduction, we referred to sector-specific TFP as “effective TFP”.
20:887:47909:12:15:81:523:186:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:16A similar insight is noted in Duernecker and Herrendorf (2015).  They show that if sectoral labor input is a
20:888:48019:15:12:71:523:171:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:CES aggregator of two labor inputs that are subject to different technological progress, then sectoral differences in
20:889:48136:12:12:71:523:159:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:the relative weights of the labor inputs imply that technological progress becomes endogenously sector specific.
20:890:48248:12:12:71:523:147:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:Be that as it may, they also show that it matters for aggregate productivity growth which sector takes over, if one
20:891:48363:12:0:71:273:135:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:measures GDP as the BEA does by a Fisher index.
21:892:48412:0:33:88:389:762:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:As previously noted, for the existence condition to be satisfied,
21:893:48477:33:0:205:373:729:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f3:A:Axt=Axt(ωxAεx−1gt+(1−ωx)Aεx−1st)
21:894:48509:0:40:379:387:737:6:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:F:1εx−1
21:895:48514:40:18:71:523:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:must  grow  at  a  constant  rate.   And  a  necessary  condition  for  structural  change  to  occur  is
21:896:48619:18:18:71:523:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:thatεx,1.  It then follows that if structural change occurs along a GBGP, then at most two
21:897:48709:18:18:71:524:661:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the three growth rates ofAxt,Agt,  andAstcan be constant in general.   Specifically,  if we
21:898:48803:18:18:71:523:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:were to restrict attention to constant rates of investment-specific technological change and of
21:899:48898:18:18:71:523:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:technological change in both the goods and services sector, the existence condition could only
21:900:48992:18:18:71:523:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hold if both the goods and services sectors experienced the same rate of technological progress.
21:901:49088:18:18:71:523:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:But that would imply that there would not be any changes in the price of services relative to
21:902:49181:18:18:71:351:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:goods and hence there would not be any structural change.
21:903:49238:18:18:88:523:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:While the literature on structural change and balanced growth has tended to focus on the
21:904:49326:18:18:71:523:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:case in which sectoral TFPs grow at constant rates, there is no natural reason to favor this case.
21:905:49424:18:18:71:523:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In  a  one-sector  model,  constant  growth  at  the  aggregate  level  necessarily  requires  constant
21:906:49527:18:18:71:523:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:growth in aggregate TFP. But in a multi–sector model with non-linear aggregators, the fact that
21:907:49622:18:17:71:523:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:certain aggregates grow at (approximately) constant rates does not translate to (approximately)
21:908:49717:17:18:71:523:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:constant rates of growth in sectoral TFPs.  In fact, the previous result shows that not only is
21:909:49812:18:18:71:523:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:it restrictive to only consider constant growth rates in sectoral TFPs,  but that imposing this
21:910:49907:18:18:71:523:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:restriction will make it impossible to find a GBGP that exhibits structural change.17In the next
21:911:50003:18:40:71:452:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:section, we examine the behavior ofAxtand its various components in the data.
21:912:50080:40:26:71:295:370:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:6.3    Insight 3: Asymptotic Behavior
21:913:50117:26:18:71:523:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Baumol (1967) was the first to note that if resources move systematically from sectors with high
21:914:50213:18:18:71:523:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:productivity growth to sectors with low productivity growth, then the economy will exhibit a
21:915:50305:18:18:71:523:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:secular decline in aggregate productivity growth. Taken to the extreme, this argument suggests
21:916:50399:18:18:71:523:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that if there is one sector with low, or even zero, productivity growth, it will eventually dominate
21:917:50499:18:18:71:468:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the entire economy. Importantly, Baumol’s formal analysis abstracted from capital.
21:918:50581:18:18:88:523:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In contrast, Ngai and Pissarides (2007) built a model of structural change with capital and
21:919:50672:18:18:71:523:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:showed that it has a different asymptotic implication. Among the many sectors of their model,
21:920:50765:18:17:71:524:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:each of which produces a different consumption good, only one sector is assumed to produce
21:921:50855:17:18:71:523:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:capital.  Since the capital-to-output ratio is constant along a GBGP, the capital-producing sec-
21:922:50951:18:18:71:523:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tor  does  not  disappear,  even  asymptotically.   Making  the  usual  assumption  that  the  capital-
21:923:51054:18:18:71:523:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:producing sector is manufacturing,  and noting that in the data the manufacturing sector has
21:924:51146:18:18:71:523:147:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stronger productivity growth than many stagnant services sectors, their model implies that while
21:925:51242:18:16:81:523:129:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:17Herrendorf and Valentinyi (2015) construct a model of endogenous technological change that is consistent
21:926:51348:16:12:71:523:113:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:with this implication of the current model, in that the endogenous equilibrium growth rates of the sectoral TFPs
21:927:51460:12:0:71:195:101:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:are not constant in their model.
22:928:51494:0:18:71:523:762:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the sector with the slowest productivity growth will dominate consumption, it will not dominate
22:929:51589:18:18:71:165:744:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the entire economy.
22:930:51608:18:18:88:523:726:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To translate this result to our setting, recall that we have only two value–added producing
22:931:51699:18:18:71:523:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sectors, that is, the goods sector and the services sector.  A version of their result obtains in
22:932:51796:18:18:71:523:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:our model if we assume that investment is produced only with goods, that goods and services
22:933:51887:18:17:71:523:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are complements in the production of consumption, that TFP grows more strongly in the goods
22:934:51978:17:18:71:523:655:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sector, and that in the limit the growth rate of goods TFP is larger than the growth rate of services
22:935:52079:18:18:71:523:637:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:TFP. While the service sector then takes over consumption asymptotically,  the goods sector
22:936:52170:18:18:71:523:619:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:continues  to  produce  investment.   Since  along  the  GBGP,  investment  constitutes  a  constant
22:937:52270:18:18:71:523:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fraction of GDP, the share of the goods sector will converge to that of investment, and so the
22:938:52364:18:18:71:295:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:goods sector will not disappear asymptotically.
22:939:52411:18:18:88:523:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Consider instead our more general specification in which both goods and services are used
22:940:52500:18:18:71:523:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to produce investment.  Additionally, assume again that goods and services are complements
22:941:52590:18:18:71:523:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the production of both investment and consumption, that TFP grows more strongly in the
22:942:52679:18:18:71:523:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:goods sector, and that in the limit the growth rate of goods TFP is larger than the growth rate
22:943:52774:18:18:71:523:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of services TFP. Under these assumptions, it remains true that investment will be a constant
22:944:52866:18:18:71:523:475:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fraction of output, but the value added share of services will approach one for both consumption
22:945:52962:18:18:71:523:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and investment. Therefore, all labor will asymptotically be in the services sector, which in our

22:967:53723:30:18:71:523:163:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In this section we complement the preceding theoretical analysis of the model of Section 3 with
22:968:53818:18:17:71:523:145:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an empirical assessment of two questions. First, to what extent are the CES aggregators in our
22:969:53912:17:16:81:523:128:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:18In related work, Duernecker et al. (2017b) point out that in a more disaggregated setting, the sector with the
22:970:54024:16:11:71:523:112:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:slowest productivity growth may not take over the economy asymptotically, because services with fast and slow
22:971:54133:11:0:71:353:101:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:productivity growth turn out to be substitutes, instead of complements.

23:976:54381:18:18:71:523:617:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that we observe something that looks like approximate balanced growth in the data, what is the

23:981:54704:26:18:71:523:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We begin with the first question. Our analysis focuses on the expressions for goods and services

23:1004:54977:35:18:88:523:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To assess whether the assumed CES structure is empirically reasonable we ask whether
23:1005:55061:18:18:71:524:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:there are values for the share and elasticity parameters (theωjandεj) such that when taking
23:1006:55152:18:18:71:523:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relative prices as given by the data, we are able to capture the key secular changes in expendi-
23:1007:55248:18:18:71:523:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ture shares. To implement this we use the data as presented in Section 2 and calibrate the share
23:1008:55344:18:18:71:523:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and elasticity parameters to minimize the sum of squared deviations between the implied ex-
23:1009:55435:18:18:71:523:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:penditure shares and the expenditure shares in the data. This is effectively the same procedure
23:1010:55530:18:18:71:523:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that we used in Herrendorf et al. (2013) when estimating a CES aggregator for consumption
23:1011:55619:18:18:71:523:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with three components–agriculture, non-agricultural goods, and services.  The implied values
23:1012:55711:18:18:71:301:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for the current exercise are presented in Table 1.
23:1013:55761:18:18:88:523:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:As expected, the relative weight of goods is estimated to be higher in investment than in
23:1014:55850:18:17:71:524:211:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consumption; compare Figures 1. The striking result is thatbothelasticity parameters turn out
23:1015:55943:17:18:71:523:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to be zero, implying that both aggregators are Leontief. While the result thatεc=0 is somewhat
23:1016:56037:18:18:71:523:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expected given the results obtained earlier in Herrendorf et al. (2013), it is perhaps surprising
23:1017:56134:18:18:71:516:158:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that the aggregator in the investment sector features a similarly low degree of substitutability.
23:1018:56231:18:18:88:523:140:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To understand why Leontief aggregators provide the best fit for the composition of final
23:1019:56319:18:18:71:524:122:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expenditures in the postwar US we consider the ratio of therealinputs of goods to services
23:1020:56409:18:0:71:523:104:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in each sector.  With CES aggregators and inputs being complements, real ratios move in the

24:1036:56721:187:18:71:523:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:opposite direction of expenditure shares.  That is, with an elasticity of substitution less than
24:1037:56817:18:18:71:523:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unity, an increase in the relative price of services implies that the expenditure share of services
24:1038:56916:18:18:71:523:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increases, but that the ratio of real services to real goods decreases. Intuitively, the reallocation
24:1039:57017:18:18:71:523:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of relative real quantities serves to the dampen the change in expenditure shares, but it does not
24:1040:57115:18:18:71:523:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:overturn the initial impact of the change in prices. In the extreme case of a Leontief aggregator,
24:1041:57213:18:17:71:272:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:there is a constant ratio for real quantities.
24:1042:57259:17:18:88:523:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:With this in mind Figure 3 displays the time series for ratios of real inputs. The figure shows
24:1043:57354:18:18:71:523:417:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that for investment, the ratio of real services to real goods inputs increases modestly. Given that
24:1044:57453:18:18:71:523:399:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the relative price of services to goods increases quite dramatically over the period of investi-
24:1045:57549:18:18:71:523:381:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:gation,  this points to a Leontief specification,  which keeps the real composition unchanged.
24:1046:57643:18:18:71:523:363:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This suggests that the Leontief specification actually seems to be the natural specification for
24:1047:57739:18:18:71:271:345:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:modeling structural change in investment.
24:1048:57780:18:18:88:523:327:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Moving  to  consumption,  we  observe  that  the  ratio  of  real  services  to  real  goods  inputs
24:1049:57880:18:18:71:523:309:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increases significantly at the same time that the relative price of services to goods also increases
24:1050:57980:18:18:71:523:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:significantly. Given our earlier discussion, a CES aggregator is unable to capture this, because
24:1051:58076:18:18:71:523:273:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the most extreme case is the Leontief specification, in which case the real composition remains
24:1052:58171:18:18:71:523:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unchanged in the face of a large change in relative prices.  In all other specifications with an
24:1053:58267:18:18:71:523:237:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:elasticity of substitution less than unity, the real quantity of services would in factdecrease.
24:1054:58363:18:18:71:523:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This suggests that, again, the Leontief specification will do the best possible job, though it will
24:1055:58462:18:17:71:523:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:still miss an important part of the changes in the real composition of inputs into consumption.
24:1056:58557:17:18:71:523:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:However, as we noted earlier, the latter result is to be expected since we have abstracted from
24:1057:58652:18:18:71:523:166:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:income effects by virtue of considering a homothetic aggregator.  Given that our earlier work
24:1058:58745:18:18:71:523:148:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that focused solely on consumption did find a role for income effects, including them would
24:1059:58836:18:18:71:523:130:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:add a force leading to an increase in the ratio of real services to real goods in the production of
24:1060:58935:18:0:71:136:112:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consumption.

25:1093:59376:18:18:71:523:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:values in the data. As suggested by the previous discussion, we find that the fitted values track
25:1094:59473:18:18:71:523:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the secular change within the investment sector very well, whereas the fitted values for con-

25:1096:59656:18:18:71:523:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Additionally, recall that we have aggregated agriculture and manufacturing into a single goods
25:1097:59750:18:17:71:523:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sector and that nonhomotheticities are typically found to be of particular importance for the
25:1098:59843:17:18:71:523:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decline of agriculture.   Given that our primary focus in this paper was on structural change
25:1099:59936:18:18:71:523:417:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:within investment, and that we abstracted from non-homotheticities within consumption in or-

25:1101:60122:18:18:71:523:381:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the structural change in consumption here. Importantly, the figures show that our CES aggrega-

25:1107:60530:18:18:71:524:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:do this we use the estimated values forωxfrom the previous exercise and compute series for the

26:1156:62159:18:18:71:523:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the second component.  As we explained in Insight 1, technological progress is endogenously
26:1157:62250:18:18:71:524:223:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investment biased in our model because the effective TFP puts a higher weight on goods in
26:1158:62339:18:18:71:465:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investment than in consumption, and goods have higher TFP growth than services.

27:1185:63108:18:18:88:523:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We  emphasize  two  points.   First,  the  construction  of  this  figure  did  not  directly  use  the
27:1186:63211:18:18:71:523:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:information that the average growth of chained GDP in the US data is approximately constant.
27:1187:63303:18:18:71:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Second, althoughAxtdoes grow at an approximately constant rate over the time period being
27:1188:63392:18:18:71:523:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:studied, none of the individual TFP terms exhibits approximate constant growth. In particular,
27:1189:63486:18:17:71:524:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:while the growth inAstdeclines over time, the growth inAxtactually increases over time. Note

27:1195:63937:18:18:71:523:304:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sector to assess the extent to which the previously documented patterns reflect compositional
27:1196:64030:18:17:71:523:286:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:changes across categories of investment versus changes within specific categories. To this end
27:1197:64124:17:18:71:523:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we disaggregate total investment into three categories:  structures, equipment, and intellectual
27:1198:64220:18:18:71:523:251:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:property product (IPP henceforth).  The BEA counts three types of IPP investments: software,
27:1199:64312:18:18:71:301:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:research and development, and artistic products.
27:1200:64360:18:18:88:523:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Figure 7 shows the evolution of the shares of total investment accounted for by each of these
27:1201:64453:18:18:71:523:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:three categories.  The dominant secular pattern is a steady decline in the share of investment
27:1202:64547:18:18:71:523:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:accounted for by structures, totalling roughly fifteen percentage points since 1947. There is also
27:1203:64645:18:18:71:523:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a steady downward trend for the share of total investment that is accounted for by equipment,
27:1204:64738:18:18:71:523:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:though this series also has some low frequency fluctuations.  Offsetting these two downward
27:1205:64829:18:18:71:523:125:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:trends  is  the  steady  increase  in  the  share  of  investment  accounted  for  by  IPP.  While  at  the
27:1206:64936:18:0:71:523:107:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:beginning  of  the  sample  structures  accounts  for  more  than  half  of  total  investment  and  IPP

28:1230:65366:0:187:336:499:729:53:Times:53:Times:C:The share of equipment in equipment and structures
28:1231:65416:187:18:71:523:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:accounts for less than ten percent,  at the end of the sample structures accounts for roughly
28:1232:65509:18:18:71:523:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:40% of the total with each of the other two categories accounting for roughly 30% each.  For
28:1233:65601:18:18:71:523:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:future purposes, we show in the right panel of Figure 7 that if we focus purely on structures
28:1234:65694:18:18:71:523:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and equipment, the share of this total accounted for by structures is relatively constant over the
28:1235:65792:18:18:71:141:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sample period.
28:1236:65806:18:17:88:523:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The three panels in Figure 8 display the extent of structural change within each of the three
28:1237:65899:17:18:71:523:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investment categories.  Interestingly, we see that structural change occurs within both equip-
28:1238:65993:18:18:71:523:417:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ment and IPP, but is absent in structures.  Additionally, note that the initial share of services is
28:1239:66093:18:18:71:523:399:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:much higher for IPP than for the other two categories. As of the end of the sample period, ser-
28:1240:66188:18:18:71:523:381:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:vices accounts for more than half of final equipment expenditure and for over 90% of final IPP
28:1241:66282:18:18:71:523:363:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expenditure.  To first approximation, the series for equipment mimics the series for aggregate
28:1242:66376:18:18:71:305:345:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investment that we displayed earlier in the paper.
28:1243:66426:18:18:88:523:327:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The left panel of Figure 9 displays the evolution of prices for structures and IPP relative
28:1244:66517:18:18:71:523:309:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to equipment.  The key message from this figure is that the price of structures has increased
28:1245:66610:18:18:71:523:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dramatically relative to the prices of the two other categories.  While the price of IPP has also
28:1246:66707:18:18:71:523:273:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increased relative to equipment, the increase is quite modest compared to the increase in the
28:1247:66800:18:18:71:199:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relative price of structures.
28:1248:66829:18:18:88:523:237:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Combining data on relative shares and relative prices we can assess the secular trends in the
28:1249:66922:18:18:71:523:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quantity of investment in each of the three categories. This information is presented in the right
28:1250:67020:18:17:71:523:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:panel of Figure 9, where we have normalized the initial level for each category equal to unity.
28:1251:67115:17:18:71:523:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:As the figure shows, IPP and equipment are both increasingly important in terms of accounting
28:1252:67208:18:18:71:215:166:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for the quantity of investment.
28:1253:67239:18:18:88:523:148:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We draw two main messages from the above empirical patterns.  First, the phenomenon of
28:1254:67325:18:18:71:523:130:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:structural change within the investment sector is strongly present in both equipment and IPP.
28:1255:67418:18:0:71:523:112:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:That is, structural change within investment is not purely a phenomenon of changing composi-

30:1333:68747:18:18:71:523:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Given that the extent of structural change varies across the three categories we think the above
30:1334:68843:18:18:71:523:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:empirical facts do suggest that it is of interest to extend our analysis to consider three different
30:1335:68943:18:17:71:523:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:categories of investment. We leave a full analysis of this to future work, because disaggregating
30:1336:69040:17:18:71:523:655:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investment destroys the analytical tractability of our simple two-by-two-by-two structure and
30:1337:69133:18:18:71:523:637:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:implies that one needs to simulate the model. We leave this for future work, because our point
30:1338:69227:18:18:71:523:619:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in this paper is to characterize in the simplest, most intuitive way the key forces that are at work
30:1339:69327:18:18:71:523:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with structural change in investment. In what follows, we therefore only map out a formulation
30:1340:69421:18:18:71:435:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the more general model that is motivated by the above empirical patterns.
30:1341:69497:18:18:88:523:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:As a first step in extending the previous framework, we note that it is straightforward to
30:1342:69587:18:18:71:523:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assume that there are now four categories of final expenditure: consumption and the three cat-
30:1343:69681:18:18:71:523:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:egories of investment. Consistent with our previous framework, we can express the production
30:1344:69773:18:18:71:523:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of each of these four categories of final expenditure as CES functions of value added from the
30:1345:69867:18:40:71:344:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:goods and services sectors. In particular, we would have:

30:1362:70077:18:18:71:523:406:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that we allow the weights and the elasticity of substitution to vary across the three categories, as
30:1363:70177:18:18:71:523:388:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:well as for each category to have its own level of technical progress. As noted previously, in the
30:1364:70275:18:18:71:523:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:face of large changes in the price of services relative to goods, the expenditure share for services
30:1365:70375:18:18:71:523:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:has increased in both equipment and IPP, but has remained constant in structures.  The same
30:1366:70466:18:18:71:523:334:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:logic that we applied previously would lead us to conclude that the elasticity of substitution
30:1367:70560:18:18:71:523:316:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is less than unity for both equipment and IPP but is equal to unity for structures.  That is, the
30:1368:70657:18:17:71:523:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:aggregator for structures is Cobb-Douglas. Similarly, the weight on services will be greatest for
30:1369:70754:17:18:71:523:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:IPP and smallest for structures. Finally, given these parameters, the behavior of relative prices
30:1370:70851:18:18:71:523:263:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the three categories would provide information on the category specific rate of technical
30:1371:70943:18:18:71:114:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:progress.
30:1372:70952:18:18:88:523:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The second step in the extension needs to specify how the three types of capital enter into the
30:1373:71047:18:18:71:523:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:production function.  The existing literature has considered this for the case in which there are
30:1374:71144:18:18:71:523:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:two categories of capital – equipment and structures, and used different formulations.  Green-
30:1375:71238:18:18:71:523:173:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wood et al. (1997) effectively used a Cobb-Douglas aggregator to aggregate the two types of
30:1376:71329:18:18:71:523:155:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:capital into a single capital good.  In contrast, Krusell et al. (2001) allowed for two different
30:1377:71426:18:18:71:524:137:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:labor inputs and assumed that equipment and structures had differential substitutability with
30:1378:71519:18:18:71:508:119:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the two different types of labor, and so do not aggregate the two capitals into a single stock.
30:1379:71614:18:0:88:523:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:For present purposes we continue to assume a single type of labor and look to aggregate
31:1380:71703:0:18:71:523:762:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  three  capital  categories  into  a  single  stock.   The  previously  presented  facts  suggest  that
31:1381:71810:18:18:71:524:744:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a single elasticity of substitution between the three categories will not be sufficient.   To see
31:1382:71907:18:18:71:523:726:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:why note that both IPP and equipment have decreasing prices relative to structures, but that
31:1383:71999:18:18:71:523:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:whereas expenditure on equipment is roughly constant relative to structures,  expenditure on
31:1384:72091:18:18:71:523:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:IPP increases quite dramatically.  In view of this there are of course multiple ways to nest the
31:1385:72187:18:17:71:523:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:aggregation of the three different capitals. Here we present one simple form that seems intuitive
31:1386:72284:17:18:71:523:655:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:given the empirical patterns noted above.  In particular, the fact that the share of equipment in
31:1387:72381:18:18:71:523:637:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the aggregate of equipment and structures is roughly constant in the face of large changes in
31:1388:72474:18:18:71:523:619:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the relative price of the two, suggests a Cobb-Douglas aggregator of the two.  This aggregate
31:1389:72567:18:18:71:523:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:would then be combined with IPP using a CES aggregator.  The previous evidence suggests
31:1390:72654:18:18:71:523:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that this aggregator would have an elasticity of substitution greater than unity. Specifically, the
31:1391:72753:18:18:71:523:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:IPP share in total investment rises while the price of IPP relative to the structures/equipment
31:1392:72848:18:18:71:354:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:composite falls; compare the left panels of Figures 7 and 9.
31:1393:72908:18:18:88:523:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The above discussion suggests an empirically reasonable specification for an analysis that
31:1394:72998:18:18:71:523:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wants to consider a disaggregation of investment into three categories.  Given these functional
31:1395:73093:18:18:71:523:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:forms, it is not possible to derive analytic expressions to characterize the aggregate behavior
31:1396:73188:18:18:71:523:475:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and so any further analysis will require numerical simulations. We leave this analysis for future
31:1397:73285:18:18:71:98:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:work.
31:1398:73290:18:18:88:523:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:As  final point we note one other issue that the disaggregation of investment into structures,
31:1399:73384:18:17:71:523:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equipment, and IPP naturally brings up. This issue is that IPP capital is part of intangible cap-
31:1400:73481:17:18:71:523:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ital, which has some nonrival components because the underlying ideas can often be used by
31:1401:73571:18:18:71:524:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:everyone.21To avoid confusion of what this means in the context of IPP capital, it is crucial to
31:1402:73667:18:18:71:523:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:make the distinction between the concepts of nonrival and excludable.  Nonrivalry is a feature
31:1403:73761:18:18:71:523:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of nature whereas excludability is a feature of the institutions chosen by society.  Nonrivalry
31:1404:73856:18:18:71:523:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:means that the use of an idea by one person does not diminish its usefulness for other persons.
31:1405:73951:18:18:71:523:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Excludability means that property rights allow the legal restriction of use to one person.  Irre-
31:1406:74048:18:18:71:523:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spective of whether IPP capital is rival or nonrival, it is excludable. That is, the BEA counts as
31:1407:74146:18:18:71:523:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:IPP capital only those investments that result in well defined property rights and have observ-
31:1408:74241:18:18:71:523:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:able market prices. For software, property rights are established by copyrights and by tailoring
31:1409:74337:18:18:71:523:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the software to the particular user; for research and development, property rights are established
31:1410:74435:18:18:71:523:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by patents; and for artistic products property rights are established by copyrights. The fact that
31:1411:74533:18:18:71:523:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:IPP capital has well defined property rights implies that, in the context of the standard growth
31:1412:74629:18:18:71:523:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model, one may treat its stock in the same way as we treat the stock of any other type of capital.
31:1413:74727:18:0:81:502:170:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:21For recent attempts to model intangible capital, see McGrattan and Prescott (2009,2010) and Xi (2016).
32:1414:74833:0:30:71:179:762:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:9    Conclusion
32:1415:74848:30:18:71:523:732:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In this paper, we have proposed a new framework for studying structural change and growth
32:1416:74937:18:18:71:523:714:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that treats consumption and investment in a symmetric manner. In particular, we have modelled
32:1417:75030:18:18:71:523:696:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:production at the level of sector value added and have treated both final consumption and final
32:1418:75125:18:18:71:523:678:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investment as aggregates of the underlying sectoral value added.   We have studied a simple
32:1419:75216:18:18:71:523:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:form of this framework with two final demand sectors – consumption and investment – and
32:1420:75303:18:18:71:523:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:two underlying sectors producing value added – goods and services.  We have focused on this
32:1421:75394:18:18:71:523:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:simple framework to best able to illustrate its distinctive features. First, for empirically plausible
32:1422:75496:18:18:71:523:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parameter values technological change is endogenously investment specific.  Second, constant
32:1423:75588:18:18:71:523:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:growth in all sectoral TFPs is generically inconsistent with aggregate balanced growth.  Third,
32:1424:75683:18:17:71:523:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the sector with the lowest productivity growth asymptotically dominates the entire economy.
32:1425:75774:17:18:71:523:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Lastly, we have shown that a version of the model with a CES aggregator in the investment
32:1426:75863:18:18:71:508:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sector can account for the salient trends in the value-added composition of final investment.
32:1427:75956:18:18:88:523:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We believe that richer versions of this model will prove useful in refining our view of the
32:1428:76047:18:18:71:523:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nature of structural change and the forces that drive it.   In particular,  we think it will be of
32:1429:76145:18:18:71:523:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interest to pursue more fully a formulation that separates investment into the three components
32:1430:76240:18:18:71:523:463:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  structures,  equipment  and  IPP.  We  believe  this  framework  will  help  us  better  isolate  the
32:1431:76345:18:18:71:238:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:underlying sources of TFP growth.
32:1432:76378:18:18:88:523:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Lastly, in this paper, we have abstracted from non-homotheticities in the aggregator of value
32:1433:76471:18:18:71:524:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:added from different sectors to final consumption.  Our empirical analysis has confirmed that
32:1434:76564:18:18:71:523:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:these non-homotheticities play a quantitatively important role.  It is therefore of interest to ex-
32:1435:76663:18:18:71:523:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:plore to what extent one can integrate them in the present framework without losing tractability.
32:1436:76760:18:46:71:226:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We plan to turn to this task next.

34:1485:80014:18:18:88:523:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We emphasize that characterizing a GBGP is more challenging in our framework than usual,
34:1486:80102:18:18:71:523:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:because we have structural change in both the consumption sector and the investment sector. In
34:1487:80196:18:18:71:523:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:contrast, existing models of structural change typically abstract from structural change within
34:1488:80291:18:18:71:523:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the investment sector. Doing this has the advantage that it “anchors” the economy and makes it
34:1489:80385:18:18:71:523:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fairly straightforward to obtain a constant rental price of capital by imposing that TFP growth in
34:1490:80483:18:18:71:523:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investment, which is a primitive of the existing models, is constant. Things are rather different
34:1491:80580:18:18:71:523:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in our framework in which TFP in investment is an endogenous, non–linear aggregator of the

35:1624:81603:26:18:71:523:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Note first that ifRtis constant, the household’s Euler equation (22) implies thatEtmust grow

36:1669:82840:36:18:71:510:520:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:But this implies that the transversality condition, which requires that̂Kt< γ+ρ, is violated.
36:1670:82933:18:18:88:523:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Suppose alternatively that at some timeTwe havêKt< γ. Arguing as above,Et/Ktis now
