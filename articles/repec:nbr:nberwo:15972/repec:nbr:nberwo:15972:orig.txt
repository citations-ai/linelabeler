2:27:1216:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:Using a very large sample of matched author-referee pairs, we examine how the gender of referees
2:28:1312:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:and authors affects the former’s recommendations.  Relying on changing matches of authors and referees,
2:29:1415:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:we find no evidence of gender differences among referees in charitableness toward authors; nor do
2:30:1512:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:we find any effect of the interaction between the referees’ and authors’ gender.  With substantial research
2:31:1619:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:showing gender differences in fairness, the results suggest that an ethos of objectivity can overcome
2:32:1720:14:42:72:422:518:12:Times:12:Times:tendencies toward same-group favoritism/opposite-group discrimination.

3:45:2017:0:27:90:169:708:144:Times:144:Times:I. Introduction 
3:46:2033:27:28:126:526:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Discrimination  is  perhaps  the  most  heavily  researched  topic  in  the  field  of  labor  
3:47:2128:28:27:90:524:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:economics and perhaps even among all endeavors in applied economics.  Much less work 
3:48:2213:27:28:90:528:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:has  been  done  on  differences  in  fairness/charitableness  by  individuals  with  different  
3:49:2310:28:28:90:530:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:characteristics,   but   that   too   is   attracting   increasing   attention   (e.g.,   Andreoni   and   
3:50:2417:28:27:90:526:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Vesterlund, 2001, and the extensive summary by Croson and Gneezy, 2009).  Very little 
3:51:2503:27:28:90:534:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:research    has    combined    these    two    topics,    asking    whether    the    amount    of    
3:52:2605:28:27:90:528:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:favoritism/discrimination  exhibited  varies  with  the  extent  of  the  match  between  the  
3:53:2700:27:28:90:529:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:parties  (but  see  Parsons  et  al,  2011,  Price  and  Wolfers,  2010,  for  differences  by  
3:54:2796:28:28:90:484:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:race/ethnicity, and Dillingham et al, 1994, for some sparse evidence on gender).   
3:55:2879:28:27:126:526:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Our  purpose  here  is  to  combine  these  two  questions,  focusing  on  differences  by  
3:56:2971:27:28:90:526:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:gender.    In  particular,  we  ask  whether  women  are  generally  more  or  less  generous  than  
3:57:3072:28:27:90:528:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:men  in  making  up-or-down  recommendations  about  others’  work,  and  whether  their  
3:58:3162:27:28:90:526:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:degree  of  generosity  is  affected  by  the  gender  of  those  whose  output  they  are  asked  to  
3:59:3265:28:27:90:527:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:judge.    While  we  despair  of  distinguishing  favoritism  toward  one’s  own  group  from  
3:60:3360:27:28:90:525:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:discrimination against another, at least our results provide some evidence on whether the 
3:61:3450:28:28:90:529:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:extent of favoritism/discrimination differs by gender of the favoring/discriminating party.   
3:62:3544:28:27:126:528:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Perhaps  analogously  to  the  theory  of  religious  sects  (Iannaccone,  1992),  one  
3:63:3632:27:28:90:522:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:might argue that the degree of solidarity within a group is a function of its relative size—
3:64:3724:28:27:90:525:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:that smaller groups will be more cohesive and more likely to favor other members of the 
3:65:3812:27:28:90:525:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:group.  We  test  this  possibility  too  here,  examining  whether  women  favor  other  women  
3:66:3909:28:28:90:526:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:more  when  they  account  for  a  smaller  share  of  the  relevant  population  of  those  making  
3:67:4010:28:0:90:242:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the judgments or being judged. 
4:68:4042:0:27:90:301:708:144:Times:144:Times:II. Modeling Preferences and Favoritism 
4:69:4082:27:28:90:521:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:  We  seek  to  model  interactions  between  members  of  two  groups,  with  within-
4:70:4168:28:27:90:528:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:group distinctions by gender.  Call the two groups that are involved authors and referees.  
4:71:4260:27:28:90:525:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Members of the two groups interact on what they perceive to be a one-to-one basis, with 
4:72:4348:28:28:90:530:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:authors  seeking  a  judgment  of  their  work,  referees  either  giving  their  approval  or  not.    
4:73:4452:28:27:90:525:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Denote authors as Ai (i = 1,..., I) and referees as Rj (j = 1,..., J).  Denote the gender of an 
4:74:4548:27:28:90:525:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:author or referee by f(Ai) or f(Rj), equaling 1 for females and 0 for males.  The utility of 
4:75:4641:28:27:90:297:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:referee Rj when matched with author Ai is: 
4:76:4684:27:28:90:395:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(1)       U(Ai , Rj) = μi + ψj + αf(Ai) + βf(Rj)  + λf(Ai)f(Rj) + εij . 
4:77:4756:28:28:90:526:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The  terms  μi  and  ψj indicate  the  idiosyncratic  values  of  author  i’s  work  and  referee  j’s  
4:78:4860:28:27:90:532:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:valuation   of   papers,   respectively.   Finally,   there   is   some   randomly   distributed   
4:79:4959:27:28:90:421:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:unobservable effect, εij , that results with each author-referee match.  
4:80:5032:28:27:126:336:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A paper is recommended for acceptance if: 
4:81:5074:27:28:90:200:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(2)       U(Ai , Rj) > 0 , 
4:82:5101:28:27:90:240:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:which occurs with probability: 
4:83:5132:27:28:90:375:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(3)       Pr{μi + ψj + αf(Ai) + βf(Rj)  + λf(Ai)f(Rj) + εij > 0}. 
4:84:5198:28:28:89:524:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:To  understand  the  meaning  of  the  parameters  in  (3),  view  the  idiosyncratic  μi  and  ψj as 
4:85:5300:28:27:90:525:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:random draws, so that the composite error term is eij = μi + ψj + εij.  Letting G(.) denote 
4:86:5392:27:28:89:460:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the c.d.f. of -eij, the acceptance-recommendation probabilities of interest are: 
4:87:5473:28:21:89:365:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: Pr(accept | male referee, male author)        = G(0) 
4:88:5526:21:20:89:366:163:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: Pr(accept | male referee, female author)     = G(α) 
4:89:5578:20:21:89:366:143:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: Pr(accept | female referee, male author)     = G(β) 
4:90:5630:21:0:89:398:122:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: Pr(accept | female referee, female author)  = G(α+β+λ) . 
5:91:5688:0:27:90:526:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Therefore,  the  effect  of  female  authorship  on  a  male  referee’s  acceptance  probability  is  
5:92:5790:27:28:90:527:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:G(α)-G(0)  and  on  a  female  referee’s  acceptance  probability  is  G(α+β+λ)-G(β).    The  
5:93:5884:28:27:90:527:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:relevant  “difference-in-difference”  effect  is  then  [G(α+β+λ)-G(β)]-[G(α)-G(0)].1  This 
5:94:5976:27:28:90:527:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:difference-in-difference  will  be  positive  (negative)  if  female  referees  are  comparatively  
5:95:6076:28:28:90:463:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:more (less) generous than male referees when matched with female authors.   
5:96:6152:28:27:90:525:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: The formulation of utility in (1) implicitly assumes that the referees j can identify 
5:97:6238:27:28:90:525:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the gender of authors i.  If this were not so, then we would expect that λ ≡ 0, since, from 
5:98:6329:28:27:90:525:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the viewpoint of referees j, f(Ai) would be noise.  (Note that α could still be non-zero if 
5:99:6421:27:28:90:526:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:paper  quality  differs  by  authors’  gender.)    Generalizing  (1)  and  (3)  to  account  for  the  
5:100:6524:28:28:90:525:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:possibility that in some cases the identity of authors is known, while in others it is not, we 
5:101:6619:28:27:90:126:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:obtain: 
5:102:6627:27:28:90:325:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(3’)      Pr{μi + ψj + αf(Ai) + βf(Rj) + λf(Ai)f(Rj)  
5:103:6681:28:27:90:411:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:  + α’Zijf(Ai) + β’Zijf(Rj)  + λ’Zijf(Ai)f(Rj) + εij  > 0}, 
5:104:6741:27:28:89:525:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:as  the  expanded  condition  for  the  probability  of  recommending  acceptance,  where  Zij  is  
5:105:6841:28:27:89:525:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:an indicator of whether f(Ai) is known to referee j.  With this expanded formulation, we 
5:106:6930:27:28:90:526:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:would  expect  λ =  0  and  would  infer  whether  there  is  within-group  favoritism  from  the  
5:107:7028:28:28:90:534:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:difference-in-difference    effect,    which    for    Zij=1    (author    gender    observed)    is    
5:108:7132:28:27:89:325:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:[G(α+β+λ+α’+β’+λ’)-G(β+β’)]-[G(α+α’)-G(0)].

5:110:7208:28:27:89:525:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:  In  order  to  estimate  the  parameters  describing  charity  and  favoritism,  we  need  a  
5:111:7304:27:28:89:524:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:panel of referees and authors that is sufficiently long that individual idiosyncrasies can be 
5:112:7398:28:32:89:526:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:accounted  for  through  multiple  observations  on  the  same  referee  matched  to  different  
5:113:7495:32:7:89:237:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:                                                 
5:114:7543:7:16:90:525:90:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:1Note  that,  unlike  in  the  linear  regression  setting,  the  difference-in-difference  is  not  given  directly  by  the  
5:115:7670:16:0:89:337:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:interaction-variable parameter λ.   See Ai and Norton (2003). 
6:116:7733:0:27:90:525:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:authors.  Referees should also be aware of the author’s gender, so that there is scope for 
6:117:7824:27:28:90:527:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:them  to  indulge  their  preferences,  if  any,  for  their  own  gender.    Obviously,  the  latter  
6:118:7927:28:27:90:528:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:problem  does  not  arise  in  laboratory  work—parties’  gender  can,  if  the  experimenter  
6:119:8022:27:28:90:527:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:desires,  be  identified  to  others.    The  former  problem  generally  cannot,  however,  be  
6:120:8119:28:28:90:502:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:handled extensively in what are typically very short-duration laboratory experiments. 
6:121:8205:28:27:90:525:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: Our data set contains all the submissions to a leading field journal that were sent 
6:122:8289:27:28:90:521:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:out to referees between 1986 and early 2008.  The journal had a strict policy of double-
6:123:8377:28:27:90:525:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:blind refereeing, so that it took some effort for referees to discover whether they matched 
6:124:8469:27:28:90:525:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the author’s gender.  We cannot know whether or not they discovered that a match did or 
6:125:8557:28:28:90:525:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:did not exist—whether Z=1 or 0.  Evidence from another journal (Blank, 1991), however, 
6:126:8644:28:27:90:525:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:suggests that even in the late 1980s referees could identify authors of half the papers they 
6:127:8737:27:28:90:457:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:were assigned. This fact suggests that Z = 1 for many of these assignments.  
6:128:8814:28:27:126:526:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:In  case  the  ease  of  identifying  authors  has  changed,  we  need  a  proxy  for  Z  that  
6:129:8910:27:28:90:525:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:might indicate whether it was possible for the referee to make this discovery.  Today it is 
6:130:9002:28:27:90:526:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:trivial  to  discover  the  identity  of  the  authors  of  most  unpublished  scholarly  papers  by  
6:131:9104:27:28:90:529:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:doing  an  internet-based  search  for  the  paper’s  title.    Such  internet  discovery  was  
6:132:9200:28:28:89:525:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:presumably far less prevalent during the early part of our sample.2  We thus proxy Z by 
6:133:9288:28:27:90:525:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:dividing the sample period into three parts:  1986-1994, when author gender could not be 
6:134:9377:27:28:90:527:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:identified  via  the  internet  (but  perhaps  could  be  through  working  paper  series,  direct  
6:135:9477:28:27:90:528:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:knowledge  of  the  paper,  etc.);  2000-2008,  when  authors’  gender  could  be  identified  
6:136:9572:27:37:90:525:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:easily via the internet; and 1995-1999, when the degree of identifiability via the internet 
6:137:9664:37:7:90:237:120:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:                                                 
6:138:9712:7:16:90:525:113:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:2Whereas  45  percent  of  American  adults  in  2000  had  reported  using  the  internet  in  the  previous  month,  
6:139:9831:16:12:90:524:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:only 9 percent had reported doing so in 1996 (Statistical Abstract of the United States, various years).  The 
6:140:9941:12:11:89:515:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:internet-usage statistic is not available before 1996, but would no doubt indicate lower usage percentages. 
6:141:10049:11:0:89:92:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3: 
7:142:10050:0:27:90:526:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:may  have  been  unclear.    In  most  of  our  comparisons  and  estimation,  we  drop  matches  
7:143:10148:27:28:90:525:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:from this middle period.3  To the extent that authors’ gender is more likely to be known 
7:144:10237:28:27:90:525:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:to the referee (Z=1) in the late period (2000-2008) than in the early period (1986-1994), 
7:145:10327:27:28:90:526:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:our  ability  to  detect  statistically  a  gender-matching  effect  would  be  greater  in  the  late  
7:146:10431:28:28:90:127:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:period. 
7:147:10439:28:27:126:526:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:2940 initial submissions were sent to at least one referee.  In the early period not 
7:148:10524:27:28:90:527:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:all  authors’  names  were  listed  in  the  data  file,  so  that,  as  Table  1  shows,  for  only  70  
7:149:10630:28:27:90:527:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:percent  of  the  papers  were  all  the  authors  identifiable.    In  the  later  period  the  records  
7:150:10736:27:28:90:528:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:were  nearer  to  being  complete.  Authors’  gender  was  completely  identifiable  on  80  
7:151:10829:28:28:90:526:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:percent  of  the  manuscripts,  with  our  inability  to  identify  authors’  gender  due  mostly  to  
7:152:10932:28:27:90:525:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ambiguity  about  the  gender  identification  of  various  given  names.    Around  one-sixth  of  
7:153:11032:27:28:90:528:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the  papers  for  which  the  gender  of  all  authors  could  be  identified  had  only  female  
7:154:11130:28:27:89:524:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:authors, and one-third had at least one female.  Both fractions increased between the early 
7:155:11222:27:28:89:524:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and late periods, significantly so for the “any female” category.  Because of differences in 
7:156:11315:28:27:89:525:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:both levels and changes of the “all female” and “any female” classifications, our analysis 
7:157:11406:27:28:89:449:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:considers both classifications as indicators of female authorship (f(Ai)=1). 
7:158:11483:28:28:126:527:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The  journal  used  6165  referees  to  judge  these  papers,  but  we  were  unable  to  
7:159:11573:28:27:90:525:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:identify the gender of 32 of them.  A total of 1514 different referees judged papers during 
7:160:11665:27:28:90:527:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:this  time  period.  One  instance  of  refereeing  was  most  common,  but  179  individuals  
7:161:11760:28:64:89:528:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:judged  at  least  ten  manuscripts  (and  the  busiest  referee  judged  36  papers).    Of  the  
7:162:11859:64:7:90:237:120:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:                                                 
7:163:11907:7:16:90:525:113:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:3Dividing  the  entire  period  into  two  equal-length  parts  and  replicating  our  analysis  does  not  qualitatively  
7:164:12030:16:12:90:525:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:change any of our conclusions.  Nor are our results altered qualitatively when we include all observations 
7:165:12137:12:11:90:232:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:from 1986-2008 in the estimation.  
7:166:12172:11:0:90:93:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3: 
8:167:12173:0:27:90:526:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:identifiable  referees,  19  percent  were  women,  a  percentage  that  increased  significantly  
8:168:12272:27:28:90:381:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:between the early and late periods, as Table 2 demonstrates. 
8:169:12333:28:27:126:525:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The identification strategy here relies on multiple matches between a referee and a 
8:170:12417:27:28:90:526:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:variety  of  authors,  and  multiple  matches  of  a  particular  article  to  referees.    It  is  thus  
8:171:12523:28:28:90:524:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:identical to the strategy used to identify firm-worker match effects by Abowd et al (1999) 
8:172:12614:28:27:90:528:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and,  in  the  context  of  discrimination,  by  Parsons  et  al  (2011).    This  approach  is  
8:173:12711:27:28:90:525:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:unaffected by the identity of the (very few) editors, so long as they do not assign referees 
8:174:12804:28:27:90:525:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:to articles based on their belief that particular referees will or will not discriminate/show 
8:175:12898:27:28:90:346:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:favoritism that depends on the gender of the authors. 
8:176:12952:28:28:126:525:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:As Table 2 also shows, the matching of  authors  and  referees was not random by 
8:177:13033:28:27:90:525:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:gender over the entire period:  Female referees were more likely than male referees to be 
8:178:13123:27:28:90:527:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:matched  with  papers  that  had  any  or  all  female  authors.    This  was  not  true  during  the  
8:179:13226:28:27:90:525:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:early period.  The relatively few papers that had female authors were only slightly more 
8:180:13315:27:28:90:525:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:likely  than  others  to  be  assigned  a  female  referee;  but  in  the  late  period  there  was  more  
8:181:13422:28:27:90:525:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:gender matching, especially of papers on which all authors were women.  The difference 
8:182:13509:27:28:90:526:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in the extent of gender-matching with “all-female” and “any-female” papers may reflect 
8:183:13596:28:28:90:526:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the specialization of women in certain sub-fields.  Regardless, this phenomenon justifies 
8:184:13686:28:27:90:356:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:accounting for this non-randomness in our estimation.  
8:185:13741:27:28:126:525:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Each referee was asked to rate the assigned paper on a four-point scale, with the 
8:186:13823:28:27:90:526:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:possible  ratings  being:    accept;  accept  with  minor  changes;  accept  with  major  changes;  
8:187:13923:27:28:90:526:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:reject.    As  the  first  two  columns  of  Table  3  indicate,  referees  recommend  that  roughly  
8:188:14025:28:28:90:527:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:half  of  the  papers  be  rejected.    A  recommendation  of  outright  acceptance  is  extremely  
8:189:14125:28:0:90:528:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:rare—most  positive  recommendations  involve  the  referee  offering  asking  for  major  
9:190:14217:0:27:90:526:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:changes  in  the  manuscript.    The  crucial  thing  to  note  in  the  table  is  the  comparison  by  
9:191:14322:27:28:90:526:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:gender.  In the entire sample, and in each sub-period, there is absolutely no evidence of 
9:192:14412:28:27:90:526:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:any  difference  in  charitableness  by  gender:    Chi-square  tests  are  very  far  from  rejecting  
9:193:14516:27:28:90:524:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the null hypothesis that the distributions of judgments by male and female referees are the 
9:194:14608:28:28:90:525:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:same.  Ignoring possible gender differences in the quality of papers that are assigned, the 
9:195:14700:28:27:90:524:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:evidence in Table 3 is consistent with the view that the women judging others’ work were 
9:196:14789:27:28:90:473:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:no more or less charitable than their male counterparts within any time period.4 
9:197:14869:28:27:126:529:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Comparing  responses  across  periods,  however,  suggests  a  slightly  different  
9:198:14953:27:28:90:525:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:implication.  While the rejection rate among males rose by 2.1 percentage points between 
9:199:15042:28:28:90:525:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the two periods, the rejection rate among female referees rose by 11.0 percentage points, 
9:200:15132:28:27:90:524:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:a  double-difference of 8.9 percentage points (s.e. = 3.9).  The women who refereed in the 
9:201:15223:27:28:90:525:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:late period were significantly less charitable than their male counterparts, as compared to 
9:202:15315:28:27:90:178:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the earlier period. 
9:203:15335:27:28:126:528:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:This  last  comparison  ignores  the  likelihood  that  the  identity  of  the  authors  
9:204:15424:28:27:90:527:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:changed  and  the  possibility  that  the  female  referees  were  assigned  different  kinds  of  
9:205:15523:27:28:90:528:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:papers  in  the  two  periods  (which  we  saw  was  true  along  the  dimension  of  gender  
9:206:15617:28:28:90:526:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:matching).    To  examine  the  charitableness  issue  further,  and  to  test  for  gender-matched  
9:207:15718:28:27:90:529:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:favoritism,   Table   4   presents   estimates   of  the  equations  (3’)  describing  refereeing  
9:208:15817:27:28:90:527:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:decisions.    In  light  of  the  fact  that  there  are  very  few  recommendations  of  outright  
9:209:15917:28:27:90:525:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:acceptance or even acceptance with minor revisions, we define the outcome as non-reject 
9:210:16005:27:37:90:525:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:versus reject.  For both all-female and any-female papers, we interact the referee’s gender

9:212:16145:7:16:90:524:113:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:4Referees’ views do matter:  All 13 papers rated “accept” by at least one referee and not below “accept with

9:214:16365:12:11:90:525:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:from complete agreement on quality by referees.  For example, if one referee rated a paper at least “accept 
9:215:16473:11:0:90:526:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:with minor revision,” 28 percent of the other referees (in two-referee cases) also rated it at least this highly.   
10:216:16590:0:27:90:521:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:with an indicator of the authors’ gender. Also, to account for the possible changing non-
10:217:16679:27:28:90:527:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:observability  of  authors’  gender,  and  thus  to  provide  estimates  of  α’, β’  and  λ’,  we  
10:218:16778:28:27:90:499:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:include interactions with an indicator for the judgment being made in the late period. 
10:219:16865:27:28:125:529:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:We   first   estimate   the   equations   using   simple   logit   regressions,   then   using   
10:220:16962:28:28:89:522:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:conditional logit regressions (conditional on the identity of the referee).  The conditional-
10:221:17055:28:27:89:525:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:logit results limit variation in the outcome to differences in the interaction of a particular 
10:222:17150:27:28:90:529:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:referee   with   authors   of   different   gender,   thus   accounting   for   the   referee-specific   
10:223:17255:28:27:90:527:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:idiosyncrasies ψj  in  (3’).    While  we  have  no  information  on  referees’  characteristics  
10:224:17353:27:28:90:525:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(other than gender), we include a quadratic in the number of previous times a person had 
10:225:17442:28:28:89:334:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:refereed for the journal—a measure of experience. 
10:226:17492:28:27:125:527:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The  results  from  both  the  logit  and  conditional-logit  specifications  in  Table  4  
10:227:17584:27:28:89:526:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:yield  the  same  conclusions  about  the  possibility  of  gender  favoritism:    It  is  simply  not  
10:228:17688:28:27:89:526:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:evident  in  these  data.    None  of  the  difference-in-difference  estimates  (the  “Difference”  
10:229:17789:27:28:89:526:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:rows  near  the  bottom  of  the  table)  is  statistically  significantly  different  from  zero.  The  
10:230:17894:28:27:89:524:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:point estimates are also quite small, ranging from 0.1 percentage points to 4.4 percentage 
10:231:17985:27:28:89:527:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:points  for  the  logit  specifications.    Even  if  referees  in  both  periods  could  identify  the  
10:232:18090:28:28:89:526:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:gender  of  the  authors  of  the  papers  they  were  assigned  (so  that  Z=1  equally  in  both  
10:233:18190:28:27:89:538:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:periods),      our      estimates      for      the      separate      sub-periods      show      that      no      
10:234:18306:27:28:89:527:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:favoritism/discrimination   based   on   gender   matching/non-matching   was   apparent.5  
10:235:18398:28:27:89:528:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Moreover,  the  triple  differences,  the  coefficients  on  the  interaction  term  of  female  
10:236:18495:27:25:89:504:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:referees with female authors and the Late period (2000-2008), are all essentially zero. 
10:237:18583:25:8:89:237:132:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:                                                 
10:238:18631:8:16:90:524:124:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:5One  additional  possibility  is  that  some  of  the  control  variables, particularly experience, are related to the 
10:239:18751:16:11:89:525:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:impacts of the gender match and its effects in the separate sub-periods.  Interactions of referee experience 
10:240:18860:11:12:89:525:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:with  the  referee-author  match  and  its  interaction  with  the  sub-period  identifier  were  essentially  zero  and  
10:241:18982:12:11:89:362:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:had no effect on our conclusions about the possibility of favoritism. 
10:242:19052:11:0:89:92:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3: 
11:243:19053:0:27:126:527:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The  biggest  change  from  the  early  (1986-1994)  to  the  late  (2000-2008)  period  
11:244:19142:27:28:90:525:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:appears in the author-gender effect upon male referees.  Male referees between 1986 and 
11:245:19230:28:27:90:529:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:1994   were   more   likely   to   recommend   rejection   of   female-authored   papers   (11.2   
11:246:19329:27:28:89:524:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:percentage points more likely in the first column, with a 95-percent confidence interval of 
11:247:19421:28:28:89:525:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:[4.1, 18.2]).  This difference disappears in the late period for the logit specifications.  The 
11:248:19517:28:27:89:527:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:change  does  not  necessarily  reflect  anything  about  gender  favoritism,  however,  as  an  
11:249:19614:27:28:89:490:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:increase in the quality of female-authored papers could also explain the difference. 
11:250:19699:28:27:125:525:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:One might thus argue that the relevant idiosyncrasies are manuscript- rather than 
11:251:19781:27:28:89:530:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:referee-specific.6      To   examine   this   possibility,   we   re-estimated   (3’)   using   logits   
11:252:19886:28:28:90:525:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:conditional on manuscript identifiers (which causes any variable that does not vary across 
11:253:19977:28:27:90:521:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:referees  on  the  same  manuscript  to  drop  out  of  the  equation).    Here  again,  the  author-
11:254:20078:27:28:90:526:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:referee  gender  interaction  was  insignificantly  different  from  zero  in  both  the  early  and  
11:255:20180:28:27:90:526:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:late  periods.    Finally,  when  we  account  for  both  referee  and  manuscript  idiosyncrasies,  
11:256:20281:27:28:90:528:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:we  find  no  qualitative  differences  (although  standard  errors  increase,  as  one  would  
11:257:20377:28:27:90:367:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:expect, with the increase in the number of fixed effects).7 
11:258:20436:27:28:126:522:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:These  estimates  do  not  account  for  the  likelihood,  as  indicated  by  the  across-
11:259:20526:28:28:89:526:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:period  comparisons  in  Table  3,  that  a  change  in  the  mix  of  referees  altered  observed  
11:260:20626:28:27:89:526:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:behavior  between  periods.    Perhaps  women  who  refereed  during  the  early  period  were  
11:261:20722:27:7:90:237:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:                                                 
11:262:20770:7:16:90:440:205:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:6Clustering by manuscript or by referee has essentially no effect on the standard errors. 
11:263:20860:16:7:90:93:189:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3: 
11:264:20860:7:16:90:524:182:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:7Another potentially confounding problem is a gender difference in self-selection.  Willingness to complete 
11:265:20968:16:12:89:525:166:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:the  assigned  task  may  differ  by  gender,  with  women  perhaps  being  more  compliant  (as  they  are  in  their  
11:266:21088:12:11:89:526:154:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:propensity  to  complete  surveys—Moore  and  Tarnai,  2002).    Differential  selectivity  will  only  bias  the  
11:267:21203:11:12:89:525:143:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:results  if  the  propensity  to  complete  the  task  is  related  to  the  charitableness  of  doers  and  refusers.    We  
11:268:21329:12:11:89:524:131:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:cannot get at this problem, since we have no information on non-compliant referees.  If men are more likely 
11:269:21437:11:12:89:525:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:not  to  comply,  and  non-compliers  are  nastier,  then  our  results  are  biased  in  favor  of  finding  that  female  
11:270:21561:12:11:89:525:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:referees  are  less  charitable  than  males.  A  related  difficulty  may  arise  from  the  selection  of  referees  by  
11:271:21684:11:12:89:526:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:editors.    We  cannot  solve  these  problems  completely;  but  the  fact  that  the  fraction  female  referees  is  
11:272:21804:12:11:89:524:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:slightly above the fraction female in the American Economic Association (Donald and Hamermesh, 2006) 
11:273:21905:11:0:89:269:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:should allay some concerns about this issue. 
12:274:21952:0:27:90:525:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:inherently more favorable to female authors, but could not observe authors’ gender, while 
12:275:22042:27:28:90:527:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:female  referees  who  entered  the  refereeing  pool  during  the  late  period  discriminated  
12:276:22139:28:27:90:527:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:against  female  authors.    This  might  have  occurred  because  of  the  increase  in  female  
12:277:22237:27:28:90:525:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:representation  in  the  set  of  referees—possibly  a  reduced  sense  of  solidarity  among  later  
12:278:22339:28:28:90:524:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:cohorts of female economists. If this were correct, we would estimate λ’ = 0, even though 
12:279:22429:28:27:90:529:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the   agents’   preferences   exhibited   favoritism   in   one   case   (the   early   referees)   and   
12:280:22535:27:28:90:420:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:discrimination in the other case (the new referees in the late period). 
12:281:22607:28:27:126:526:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:To examine this possibility, we re-estimated the equations, restricting the sample 
12:282:22690:27:28:90:525:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:to the 295 individuals who refereed in both the early and late periods.  The estimates for 
12:283:22781:28:28:90:526:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:this  reduced  sample  are  presented  in  Table  5.    A  comparison  to  the  results  in  Table  4  
12:284:22884:28:27:90:526:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:suggests  that  the  apparent  lack  of  favoritism  or  discrimination  could  not  have  resulted  
12:285:22985:27:28:90:525:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:from the changing mix of referees.  Even within this sub-sample there is no evidence of a 
12:286:23075:28:27:90:525:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:significant change in behavior toward female authors when the authors’ genders became 
12:287:23161:27:28:90:518:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:more readily observable. The parameter estimates are quite similar across the two tables. 
12:288:23251:28:27:90:264:322:144:Times:144:Times:IV. Conclusions and Implications 
12:289:23284:27:28:126:525:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Whereas many previous studies have found differences in altruism by gender, our 
12:290:23364:28:28:90:521:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:examination  of  a  unique  and  very  large  sample  on  author-referee  outcomes  in  a  high-
12:291:23460:28:27:90:525:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:stakes field environment yields no evidence of gender differences.  Even accounting for 
12:292:23548:27:28:90:526:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the  idiosyncrasies  of  both  the  judge  and  the  judged,  we  still  find  no  such  differences.  
12:293:23651:28:27:90:526:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Moreover, we find no evidence of relative favoritism toward one’s own gender by either 
12:294:23738:27:28:90:171:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:men or women.  
12:295:23753:28:28:126:526:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Female  and  male  economists,  at  least  in  this  specific  setting,  appear  to  behave  
12:296:23846:28:0:90:524:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:similarly and in a gender-neutral manner.  This might be the result of some inherent sense 
13:297:23939:0:27:90:526:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of  fairness,  with  participants  feeling  that  exercising  their  prejudices  is  inappropriate  in  
13:298:24043:27:28:90:525:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:this particular judging activity—that “there own identity is often tied to their self-concept 
13:299:24137:28:27:90:530:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:as  experts  who  are  able  to  stand  above  their  personal  interest”  (Lamont,  2009,  p.  9).    
13:300:24240:27:28:90:527:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Moreover,  given  the  absence  of  an  interaction  of  experience  with  gender,  our  results  
13:301:24338:28:28:90:521:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:suggest  either  that  there  is  no  self-selection  by  gender  attitudes,  or  that  fairness/non-
13:302:24439:28:27:90:525:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:discrimination  develops  very  early  in  the  scholars’  professional  careers.  Combined  with  
13:303:24538:27:28:90:526:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:previous  findings,  our  results  suggest  that  gender  differences  in  fairness  and  favoritism  
13:304:24640:28:27:90:526:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:are  context-specific.    Future  research,  including  laboratory  experiments,  might  examine  
13:305:24738:27:28:90:525:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:how the extent of fairness/lack of favoritism depends on the perceived importance of the 
13:306:24827:28:0:90:252:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:particular two-sided relationship.
