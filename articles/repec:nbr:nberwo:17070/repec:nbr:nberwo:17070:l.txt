2:29:1521:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:In the United States, public health insurance programs cover over 90 million individuals.  Changes
2:30:1619:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:in the scope of these programs, such as the Medicaid expansions under the recently passed Patient
2:31:1716:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:Protection and Affordable Care Act, may have large effects on physician behavior.  This study finds
2:32:1815:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:that following the implementation of the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, physicians decreased
2:33:1919:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:the number of hours spent with patients, but increased their participation in the expanded program.
2:34:2018:14:14:72:539:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:Suggestive evidence is found that this decrease in hours was a result of shorter office visits. These
2:35:2119:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:findings are consistent with the predictions from a mixed-economy model of physician behavior with
2:36:2217:14:42:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:public and private payers and also provide evidence of crowd out resulting from the creation of SCHIP.

3:45:2510:0:27:72:167:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:I. Introduction 
3:46:2525:27:28:108:509:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: In the United States, public health insurance programs provide coverage to over 90 
3:47:2608:28:27:72:528:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:million individuals (United States Census, 2010).  Due to the prominence of these programs in 
3:48:2702:27:28:72:539:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the healthcare sector, their expansion may have large effects on physician behavior such as labor 
3:49:2800:28:28:72:532:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:supply.  For example, the recent health care reform debate in the United States culminated with 
3:50:2896:28:27:71:531:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the signing of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA)—which is expected to, 
3:51:2988:27:28:71:510:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:among other things, increase enrollment in public health insurance programs by 16 million 
3:52:3078:28:27:72:537:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:(Congressional Budget Office, 2010).  Given the existing predictions of physician shortages, the 
3:53:3175:27:28:72:505:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:expected increase in the utilization of medical services by these millions of newly insured 
3:54:3267:28:28:72:511:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Americans has generated concerns among policymakers and health professionals about the 
3:55:3354:28:27:72:512:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:potential for dramatically longer waiting times for appointments, lower quality of care, and 
3:56:3447:27:28:72:536:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:overloaded physician practices (AAMC, 2010). These concerns will only be magnified if public 
3:57:3540:28:27:72:451:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:health insurance expansions decrease the labor supply of existing physicians.   
3:58:3620:27:28:108:519:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:Any negative effects of decreased physician labor supply may be worse for Medicaid 
3:59:3703:28:27:72:531:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:patients who are already covered by a program that is increasingly not accepted by physicians.  
3:60:3799:27:28:72:501:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Cunningham and May (2006) found that from 1996 to 2005 the percentage of physicians 
3:61:3883:28:28:72:529:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:reporting no Medicaid patients (as defined by practice revenue) increased by 13 percent.  Over 
3:62:3978:28:27:72:525:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the same time period, the percentage of physicians reporting that they were not accepting new 
3:63:4072:27:28:72:543:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Medicaid patients increased from 19.4 to 21 percent. The increase was largest for physicians who 
3:64:4169:28:27:72:311:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:reported receiving little revenue from Medicaid.   
3:65:4220:27:28:108:533:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:It is, therefore, important to understand how large expansions of public health insurance 
3:66:4310:28:28:72:512:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:programs affect physician labor supply and participation in the newly-expanded programs.  
3:67:4400:28:0:72:530:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:However, there is little existing evidence about the impact of an increase in the size of a public 
4:68:4502:0:27:72:532:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:insurance program on the behavior of physicians. The creation and implementation of the State 
4:69:4596:27:28:72:491:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) in the 1990s provides an opportunity to 
4:70:4680:28:27:72:510:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:investigate this question.  SCHIP was a partnership between federal and state governments 
4:71:4770:27:28:72:497:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:intended to increase insurance coverage for low-income Americans under the age of 19. 
4:72:4856:28:28:108:507:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:I apply the Sloan, Mitchell, and Cromwell (1978) model of a mixed economy with 
4:73:4935:28:27:72:478:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:private and public payers to this question and predict that physicians affected by the 
4:74:5022:27:28:72:519:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:implementation of SCHIP should decrease the quantity of medical services they provide and 
4:75:5112:28:27:72:537:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:increase their participation in the public insurance program.  This results from the fact that, for a 
4:76:5214:27:28:72:537:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:portion of the physicians who were not previously participating in the public insurance program, 
4:77:5311:28:28:72:497:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the implementation of SCHIP changes the marginal patient from one covered by private 
4:78:5396:28:27:72:426:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:Times:B:insurance to one covered by the lower-reimbursing government program. 
4:79:5465:27:28:108:542:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:I test the predictions of this mixed economy model using a difference-in-differences (DD) 
4:80:5555:28:27:72:539:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:identification strategy that exploits the practice patterns of different types of physicians. Because 
4:81:5657:27:28:72:506:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of the age limit for SCHIP beneficiaries (children under the age of 19), pediatricians were 
4:82:5749:28:27:72:520:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:disproportionately affected by the new insurance program. Physicians in other specialties are 
4:83:5843:27:28:72:540:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:used to control for secular trends and contemporaneous events that may have influenced the time 
4:84:5939:28:28:72:521:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:path of outcomes.  To capture state level differences in program generosity which may affect 
4:85:6032:28:27:72:540:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:physician behavior, I use the simulated SCHIP eligibility measure in Gruber and Simon (2008).   
4:86:6128:27:28:108:508:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:In this analysis I use two different nationally-representative datasets. Each of these 
4:87:6215:28:27:72:535:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:datasets has strengths and weaknesses with respect to this analysis.  The primary dataset for this 
4:88:6314:27:28:72:522:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:analysis, the Community Tracking Study physician survey (CTS), contains data on physician 
4:89:6404:28:28:72:525:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:hours spent on patient care, insurance acceptance patterns, and practice level revenue data.  In 
4:90:6501:28:0:72:501:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:addition, this dataset also allows researchers to track a group of physicians over time and 
5:91:6596:0:27:72:520:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:contains state identifiers—both of which are critical for the proposed identification strategy.  
5:92:6693:27:28:71:538:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:However, the CTS does not contain any visit level data detailing the length of office visits or the 
5:93:6793:28:27:72:531:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:number of diagnostic services performed—limiting my ability to investigate the mechanism by 
5:94:6885:27:28:72:522:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:which physicians alter their labor supply in response to a public health insurance expansion.   
5:95:6981:28:28:108:534:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:The second dataset, the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS), is a visit-
5:96:7065:28:27:72:503:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:level survey of office-based physicians.  These data cover, among other things, physician 
5:97:7155:27:28:72:514:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:demographics, patient insurance status, and the amount of time the physician spent with the 
5:98:7247:28:27:72:522:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:patient.  However, this dataset does not contain state identifiers or provide the ability to track 
5:99:7346:27:28:72:537:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:physicians over time.  It also has no practice level information about Medicaid acceptance or the 
5:100:7444:28:28:72:536:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:hours worked by physicians.  These weaknesses decrease the precision of estimates of the effect 
5:101:7540:28:27:72:125:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of SCHIP. 
5:102:7550:27:28:108:537:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:Implementing the DD strategy utilizing the state-based measures of simulated eligibility, 
5:103:7640:28:27:72:496:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:I find that SCHIP decreased the number of hours spent on patient care.  In addition, this 
5:104:7730:27:28:71:513:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:expansion of public health insurance increased the percentage of pediatricians that reported 
5:105:7823:28:27:72:512:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:seeing any Medicaid patients, accepting new Medicaid patients, and the amount of revenue 
5:106:7912:27:28:72:518:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:received from Medicaid.  Examining the visit-level data from the NAMCS, I find suggestive 
5:107:8002:28:28:72:541:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:evidence that this decrease in labor supply comes from shorter visit lengths for Medicaid patients 
5:108:8101:28:27:72:509:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:after the implementation of SCHIP—in particular, I find a decrease in the number of visits 
5:109:8192:27:28:72:304:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:lasting more than 10 minutes (p-value < 0.10).   
5:110:8241:28:27:108:526:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:Taken together, the above results support the predictions of the mixed economy model 
5:111:8326:27:28:72:538:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:across several different outcomes including labor supply, accepting patients from the new public 
5:112:8423:28:0:72:539:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:insurance program, and the amount of revenue received from the new program.  The consistency 
6:113:8519:0:27:72:533:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:across these wide ranging outcomes, which are not intuitively connected through a means other 
6:114:8613:27:28:72:473:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:than those proposed by the model, provides support for the totality of the findings.

6:120:9020:28:27:72:542:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:qualify for coverage under the income limits for traditional Medicaid.  The legislation gave states 
6:121:9120:27:28:72:540:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:three options for creating a program.  States could enroll progressively higher income children in 
6:122:9219:28:28:72:504:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the existing Medicaid program, create a separate state insurance program, or implement a 
6:123:9308:28:27:72:535:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:combination of these two approaches.  Separate SCHIP programs were allowed more flexibility 
6:124:9400:27:28:72:520:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:in program rules.1  Initial enrollments in the program grew quickly and by 1999 there were 2 
6:125:9493:28:27:71:539:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:million children enrolled in the program (Herz, Fernandez, and Peterson, 2005).  As of 2009, the 
6:126:9590:27:28:71:356:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:program covered 4.9 million children (Smith et al. 2010).

6:129:9735:27:28:107:533:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:There are two main strands of research upon which this study builds.  The first analyzes 
6:130:9824:28:27:71:528:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the determinants of physician procedure intensity and labor supply.  There is a long theoretical 
6:131:9921:27:28:71:521:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:literature studying the ability of physicians to induce demand for their services (Fuchs, 1978; 
6:132:10017:28:27:72:516:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Pauly, 1980; Dranove, 1988).  The essence of the induced demand model is that following a 
6:133:10107:27:71:72:508:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:negative shock to earnings, doctors take advantage of the information asymmetry between

7:137:10453:27:28:72:357:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:for models of physician-induced-demand has been mixed.2 
7:138:10508:28:27:107:500:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: The induced demand literature primarily addressed questions related to treatment 
7:139:10589:27:28:72:537:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:intensity and revenue generating activities—not specifically labor supply (although the concepts 
7:140:10686:28:28:71:536:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:are clearly correlated).  An outstanding question in the literature is: What is the effect of income 
7:141:10787:28:27:71:537:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:shocks on the actual amount of labor supplied by physicians, as opposed to simply their revenue 
7:142:10883:27:28:71:539:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:generating activities such as increased testing or referrals?  Enterline, McDonald, and McDonald 
7:143:10980:28:27:71:542:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:(1973) interviewed random samples of Canadian physicians before and after the introduction of a 
7:144:11076:27:28:71:508:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:universal health care program in Quebec.  In this context, physicians decreased their hours 
7:145:11168:28:28:71:512:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:worked following the implementation of the universal health care program.  More recently,

7:147:11352:27:28:71:515:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of hours worked for physicians from 1996 to 2008 was related to declines in physician fees. 
7:148:11444:28:27:107:531:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:In addition to the literature describing physician-induced-demand and labor supply, this 
7:149:11533:27:28:71:513:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:analysis builds on previous work estimating the physician Medicaid participation decision.  
7:150:11625:28:27:71:537:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Sloan, Mitchell and Cromwell (1978) provided one of the first models of physician participation 
7:151:11721:27:28:71:527:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:in Medicaid.  Their mixed-economy model, which serves as the starting point for this paper, is 
7:152:11816:28:32:71:514:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:described in detail below.  In addition to their theoretical contribution, the authors analyzed

7:154:11972:7:16:72:540:228:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:2 Many of the original empirical tests of induced demand used two-stage least squares methods to estimate the effect 
7:155:12089:16:12:71:525:212:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:of the supply of physicians on the demand of services (Fuchs, 1978; Cromwell and Mitchell, 1986).  The authors 
7:156:12200:12:11:71:508:200:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:attempted to identify plausibly exogenous variation in the location decision of physicians, and then used this 
7:157:12311:11:12:71:539:189:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:exogenous increase in supply to determine the effect on the consumption of medical services.  Dranove and Wehner 
7:158:12424:12:11:71:537:177:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:(1994) highlighted potential econometric flaws in this approach and, as a falsification test, applied the same method 
7:159:12542:11:12:71:521:166:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:to childbirth—an area where there is likely little induced demand.  The empirical approach still found an effect,

7:161:12767:11:12:71:506:143:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:examined differences in diagnostic testing patterns based on physician ownership of the testing equipment—
7:162:12873:12:11:71:515:131:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:physicians receive more revenue from each diagnostic test performed when they own the equipment.   Several 
7:163:12980:11:12:71:537:120:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:authors have found the physician ownership of this equipment increases the utilization of these services (Hillman et

8:171:13633:27:28:71:491:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:studies have also found that non-participation was sensitive to the reimbursements and

8:176:14087:27:28:108:527:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:Two previous works have examined the effect of an increase in Medicaid eligibility on 
8:177:14173:28:28:72:536:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:physician behavior.  Baker and Royalty (2000) found that the Medicaid expansions for pregnant 
8:178:14267:28:27:72:532:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:women led to improved access to public clinics and hospitals.  Bronstein, Adams, and Florence 
8:179:14361:27:28:72:532:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:(2004) examined physician participation responses to SCHIP in communities in Alabama (who 
8:180:14451:28:27:72:514:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:expanded their existing Medicaid program) and Georgia (who implemented a separate state 
8:181:14539:27:28:72:517:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:SCHIP program).  They found that physicians in Georgia increased their participation in the 
8:182:14631:28:27:72:528:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:government insurance program while those in Alabama did not.  The analysis did not examine 
8:183:14722:27:28:72:498:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:physician labor supply or practice patterns beyond public health insurance participation.

8:187:14896:13:28:108:527:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:Policy makers are often concerned with “crowd out,” a phenomenon whereby many of 
8:188:14977:28:27:72:518:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the newly insured individuals following an expansion previously had coverage from another 
8:189:15067:27:28:72:523:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:source.  Cutler and Gruber (1996) found that following the original Medicaid expansions, the 
8:190:15160:28:28:72:532:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:uninsurance rate fell by only half as much as the increase in those covered by the expansion—a 
8:191:15255:28:0:72:533:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:crowd out rate of 50 percent.  Building on this foundational study, a sizeable literature emerged 
9:192:15356:0:27:72:523:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:estimating the presence and magnitude of crowd out following the expansion of public health 
9:193:15448:27:28:72:527:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:insurance programs.  Using a variety of methods, authors have also found evidence of varying 
9:194:15541:28:27:72:537:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:levels of crowd-out (Dubay and Kenney, 1996 and 1997; Yazici and Kaestner, 2000).  A second 
9:195:15633:27:28:71:539:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:set of authors have used the longitudinal data in Survey of Income Program Participation (SIPP), 
9:196:15730:28:28:72:540:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and found little evidence of crowd out (Bloomberg et al., 2000; Card and Shore Sheppard, 2004;  
9:197:15826:28:27:72:238:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Ham and Shore Sheppard, 2005).  
9:198:15858:27:28:108:498:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:These earlier studies estimated the crowd out from the original expansions to the 
9:199:15940:28:27:72:522:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Medicaid program in the late 1980s.  Since that time, a number of authors have examined the 
9:200:16032:27:28:72:532:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:amount of crowd out from SCHIP.   Similar to Cutler and Gruber’s original work, LoSasso and

9:205:16330:27:28:108:497:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f2:?: I apply the model of physician pricing in a mixed economy introduced by Sloan, 
9:206:16409:28:27:72:532:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Mitchell, and Cromwell (1978) to examine how physicians respond to an increase in the size of 
9:207:16503:27:28:72:537:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the government’s role in the insurance sector.  In this model, a physician faces two markets: one 
9:208:16601:28:28:72:528:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:with privately-insured patients displaying a downward sloping demand curve and another with 
9:209:16693:28:27:72:512:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:government-insured patients whose insurance pays a fixed reimbursement.  Physicians will 
9:210:16782:27:28:72:489:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:accept patients in the private market until the marginal revenue equals the government 
9:211:16869:28:27:72:537:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:reimbursement rate.  After that threshold, they will accept Medicaid patients until their marginal 
9:212:16968:27:28:72:511:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:costs are equal to the Medicaid reimbursement rate.  For simplicity, the model traditionally 
9:213:17061:28:28:72:536:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:assumes that physicians provide a homogenous good, which can be thought of as office visits or 
9:214:17156:28:0:72:488:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:other standard medical services.  Extensions to this assumption are discussed below.    
10:215:17247:0:27:108:517:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:Figure 1 provides a graphical representation of this model. In the pre-expansion time 
10:216:17333:27:28:72:530:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:period, the marginal revenue curve faced by a physician is the bold line composed of segments 
10:217:17427:28:27:71:534:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of the MRp curve (which represents the marginal revenue from treating privately insured or self-
10:218:17523:27:28:72:532:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:pay patients) and the Pm curve (which represents the fixed reimbursement from the government 
10:219:17616:28:28:72:533:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:insurance program).  In this case, physicians with marginal costs curves of MC and MC’ would 
10:220:17709:28:27:72:473:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:not accept patients from the government market.3 A physician with the curve in the 
10:221:17792:27:28:72:542:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:neighborhood of MC’’, however, would see a mixture of both private and public sector patients.   
10:222:17889:28:27:107:536:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: The most obvious effect of the expansion of a public insurance program is an increase in

10:224:18075:28:28:72:522:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:private to public health coverage.  Under the simplifying assumption that the crowd-out from 
10:225:18168:28:27:72:538:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:SCHIP occurs randomly across insured individuals regardless of their pre-expansion willingness 
10:226:18263:27:28:72:541:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:to pay for medical services, the effect on the private market can be seen by the inward rotation of

10:229:18553:28:27:72:164:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:with the Pm curve.

10:232:18760:28:27:72:542:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:marginal cost curve in the neighborhood of MC.  In the pre-expansion time period, this physician 
10:233:18857:27:28:72:521:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:would not treat Medicaid patients.  After the expansion, this doctor’s behavior is predicted to 
10:234:18953:28:18:72:538:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:change in two ways: (1) the physician will provide a lower quantity of medical services (moving

10:236:19109:7:16:72:535:159:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:3 These physicians are easily observable in the CTS, where 12.33 percent of physicians report receiving no revenue 
10:237:19224:16:12:72:523:143:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:from Medicaid and 19 percent of physicians report they are not accepting new Medicaid patients during the first 
10:238:19336:12:7:72:158:131:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:panel of the survey.   
10:239:19359:7:16:72:509:124:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:4 The simplifying assumption is reasonable and makes the following analysis more intuitive.  The qualitative 
10:240:19468:16:11:72:535:108:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:predictions from the model will carry through under more complicated assumptions about the pattern of crowd out. 
10:241:19581:11:12:72:534:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:The most realistic alternate assumption would be that the crowd out would primarily occur among individuals who

12:271:21839:0:27:108:506:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:The model described above is used traditionally to describe the provision of office 
12:272:21923:27:28:72:535:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:services or other discrete medical activities.  As is the case in this study, the quantity of medical 
12:273:22025:28:27:72:525:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:services underlying the model above can also be extended to the broader concept of physician 
12:274:22118:27:28:72:539:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:labor supply and hours worked.  In this case, the marginal revenue curve represents the expected 
12:275:22215:28:28:72:534:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:reimbursements received by the physician for the next hour of work seeing a patient covered by 
12:276:22310:28:27:72:503:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:either private or the public health insurance.  One might worry that physicians respond to 
12:277:22401:27:28:71:521:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:exogenous changes in the insurance market by spending more time with each patient without 
12:278:22491:28:27:71:541:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:billing them for the extra care. However, since physicians trade-off patient hours for leisure time, 
12:279:22592:27:28:71:532:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:it is reasonable to assume they would not react to changes in the insurance market by providing 
12:280:22688:28:28:71:540:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:more unreimbursed labor.  Under this assumption, the quantity of medical services in predictions

12:282:22846:27:28:107:517:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:It is important to note that the mixed economy model, in a situation of no crowd-out, 
12:283:22932:28:27:71:534:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:predicts either no change (or an increase) in the number of hours worked by affected physicians 
12:284:23028:27:28:71:530:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and no effect on physician participation.  Without any crowd out, there is no inward rotation of 
12:285:23125:28:27:71:509:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the upper segment of the demand curve.  Instead, the increase in the number of individuals 
12:286:23216:27:28:71:532:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:eligible for Medicaid comes primarily from the downward sloping portion of the demand curve

12:289:23497:27:28:71:541:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:from their marginal patient.  Since this marginal patient was either uninsured or privately insured 
12:290:23597:28:27:71:536:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:by an insurer paying reimbursement rates lower than those offered by Medicaid, there should be 
12:291:23692:27:28:71:512:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:no decrease in labor supply or increase in program participation.  Therefore, finding results 
12:292:23786:28:0:71:547:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:consistent with the model’s predictions serve as further evidence of crowd-out caused by SCHIP.   
13:293:23888:0:27:107:517:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: The mixed economy model was first developed to explain physician responses to the 
13:294:23970:27:28:72:526:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:expansion of an existing fixed reimbursement government insurance program.  Given that this 
13:295:24062:28:27:72:497:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:paper focuses on the creation of a new government program, it is natural to question the 
13:296:24151:27:28:72:537:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:appropriateness of the model in this context.  As discussed above, states were given the freedom 
13:297:24248:28:28:72:532:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:to implement SCHIP through various means.   Therefore, the magnitude of the effect of SCHIP 
13:298:24340:28:27:72:513:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:on physician behavior may differ depending on the type of state-level implementation.6  To

14:331:27318:28:28:71:541:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and medical care, respectively.7  Two questions pertain to participation in the Medicaid program: 
14:332:27416:28:27:72:526:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:whether the physician is accepting “new Medicaid patients” and the percentage of the practice 
14:333:27510:27:28:72:524:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:revenue from Medicaid.  Data on Medicaid reimbursement rates are available for 1993, 1998, 
14:334:27601:28:27:72:519:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and 2003 from the Urban Institute’s survey of physician fees (Zuckerman and Norton, 2000; 
14:335:27691:27:28:72:525:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Zuckerman et al., 2004).  These data are matched to the closest respective years in the CTS.8   
14:336:27787:28:27:108:524:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:The longitudinal component of the CTS allows physicians to be tracked over time and 
14:337:27871:27:28:72:530:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:includes data about hours worked, insurance participation, and practice revenue.  However, the 
14:338:27966:28:28:72:523:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:data contain no information on the number of patients seen, office visits provided, or services 
14:339:28062:28:61:72:531:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:rendered during a visit.  In addition, the revenue data is at the practice rather than the physician 
14:340:28163:61:8:72:218:178:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:                                                            
14:341:28223:8:16:72:511:170:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:7 Physicians are asked for the number of hours spent on “medically related activities” and “direct patient care 
14:342:28335:16:11:72:540:154:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:activities” during the last completed week of work.  Because the number of hours spent on patient care is a subset of 
14:343:28453:11:12:72:538:143:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:all medical activities, the patient care variable is replaced with the medical care data if the reported number of hours 
14:344:28574:12:11:72:537:131:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:on patient care exceeds the reported number for medical activities.  This occurred for only 0.14% of observations in 
14:345:28691:11:7:72:123:120:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:the sample.  
14:346:28704:7:16:72:513:113:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:8 These data are for the Medicaid fee for service (FFS) system.  Many Medicaid enrollees are now covered by 
14:347:28812:16:12:72:541:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:managed care, but in general the reimbursements for the physicians under these systems are intended to be similar to 
14:348:28929:12:11:72:527:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:those for the FFS system. A small number of observations were dropped in years when Medicaid fee data are not 
14:349:29039:11:0:72:178:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:available for a physician.  
15:350:29071:0:27:72:538:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:level.  I address this last limitation by using a subset of data from small group practices with one 
15:351:29172:27:28:72:535:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:or two physicians—a group whose practice income is closely related to their personal income.    
15:352:29268:28:27:108:531:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:Since the CTS does not contain a visit-level component, it is not possible to analyze the 
15:353:29358:27:28:72:507:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:effect of SCHIP on visit-level practice patterns.  Therefore, I use data from the 1993-2002 
15:354:29450:28:28:72:532:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS).9  NAMCS is a nationally-representative 
15:355:29538:28:27:72:522:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:survey designed to provide information on the use of ambulatory medical care services in the 
15:356:29631:27:28:72:521:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:United States.  The survey is administered by the Centers for Disease Control.  Similar to the 
15:357:29726:28:27:72:518:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:CTS, the sampling frame from the NAMCS comes from the masterfiles of the AMA and the 
15:358:29811:27:28:72:526:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:AOA, and contains physicians who are classified as providing “office-based, patient care.”  A 
15:359:29905:28:28:72:540:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:random sample of these physicians is surveyed about their practice patterns during one randomly 
15:360:30001:28:27:72:524:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:selected week. Data are collected on a variety of dimensions, including patient demographics, 
15:361:30095:27:28:72:237:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:insurance status, and visit length.  
15:362:30132:28:27:108:518:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:Because it does not contain longitudinal data, the NAMCS cannot be used to classify 
15:363:30216:27:28:72:528:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:physicians based on their pre-expansion participation in Medicaid.  The survey also lacks state 
15:364:30312:28:27:72:507:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:identifiers and, therefore, eliminates any ability to use the simulated eligibility measure of 
15:365:30407:27:28:72:482:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:variation in SCHIP generosity—reducing the precision of estimates from these data.

15:368:30516:27:28:107:522:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f2:?: The sample for the difference-in-differences analysis described below is composed of 
15:369:30601:28:27:71:506:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:physicians with low pre-expansion participation in Medicaid.  From the CTS, I categorize 
15:370:30690:27:71:71:534:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:physicians as low-Medicaid participators if the percentage of their revenue from Medicaid prior

15:372:30846:8:0:72:411:78:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:9 This covers the period of five years of data before and after the creation of SCHIP. 
16:373:30937:0:27:72:519:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:to SCHIP is less than or equal to five percent.  In the first panel of the CTS, 42 percent of all 
16:374:31035:27:28:72:398:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:physicians and 31 percent of pediatricians fall into this category.10   
16:375:31107:28:27:108:537:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:To implement the difference-in-differences strategy, I must identify a treatment group of 
16:376:31197:27:28:72:516:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:physicians who are affected by the public health insurance expansion and a control group of 
16:377:31289:28:28:72:500:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:physicians whose practices were not affected by the policy change.  As discussed above, 
16:378:31377:28:27:72:539:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:pediatricians, whose caseload is primarily composed of individuals under the age of 19, form the 
16:379:31474:27:28:72:523:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:treatment group.  Identifying a comparison group requires selecting a set of physicians whose 
16:380:31568:28:27:72:535:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:time path of outcomes would be, in the absence of the implementation of SCHIP, similar to that 
16:381:31663:27:28:72:447:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of pediatricians.  I use physicians in all other specialties as the control group.  
16:382:31747:28:28:108:539:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:The lack of several periods of pre-treatment data in the CTS eliminates any direct tests of 
16:383:31839:28:27:72:510:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the parallel trends assumption underlying the DD identification strategy. Instead, I provide 
16:384:31932:27:28:72:528:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:descriptive statistics by specialty to assess the similarity of these two groups.  Table 1 presents 
16:385:32032:28:27:72:540:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:these statistics for the first panel of the CTS based on both specialty and pre-expansion Medicaid 
16:386:32131:27:28:72:535:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:participation.  Focusing on the physicians reporting less than five percent of their pre-expansion 
16:387:32230:28:27:72:494:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:practice revenue from Medicaid, pediatricians are most similar to internists and general 
16:388:32319:27:28:72:530:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:practitioners.  They are less similar to physicians in the general specialties, surgical specialties, 
16:389:32421:28:28:72:496:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:obstetrics and gynecology, and psychiatrists.  The outcome variables defining Medicaid 
16:390:32508:28:27:72:499:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:participation appear in the last two columns.  On average, the percentage of revenue that 
16:391:32598:27:34:72:507:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:pediatricians earn from Medicaid is similar to the physicians with “internal medicine” and 
16:392:32689:34:8:72:218:178:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:                                                            
16:393:32749:8:16:72:525:170:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:10 Data on the percentage of revenue from Medicaid have large concentrations of respondents clustered on round 
16:394:32860:16:11:71:504:154:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:numbers (5, 10, 15). Ideally, I would identify physicians that report no pre-SCHIP revenue from Medicaid.  
16:395:32967:11:12:71:541:143:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:However, in the first panel of CTS only 10 percent of pediatricians fall into this category.  Another possible measure 
16:396:33086:12:11:71:538:131:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:of a low Medicaid provider is not accepting new Medicaid patients in the time period prior to the implementation of 
16:397:33202:11:12:71:529:120:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:SCHIP.  The sample size of this group is larger than those reporting no revenue from Medicaid, but still relatively 
16:398:33318:12:11:71:507:108:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:small, creating concerns of Type II errors.  Estimating the main results of the paper using either of these two 
16:399:33430:11:12:71:530:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:alternate pre-SCHIP Medicaid participation produces estimates that are qualitatively similar in magnitude but less 
16:400:33545:12:11:71:516:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:precise than those presented below.  The estimates are also robust to a range of other cutoffs between 5 and 10 
16:401:33657:11:0:71:113:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f3:F:percent.    
17:402:33673:0:27:72:536:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:“general and family practice” specialties. The outcomes of new Medicaid patient acceptance are 
17:403:33768:27:28:71:537:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:also similar between the groups—though here there is a larger difference between pediatrics and 
17:404:33864:28:27:71:540:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:general and family practice.  Pediatricians appear to work slightly fewer hours than physicians in 
17:405:33963:27:28:72:392:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:other specialties, although this difference is small in magnitude.11  
17:406:34033:28:28:108:541:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:Without several periods of pre-expansion data on physicians, it is not possible to examine 
17:407:34124:28:27:72:537:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the pre-treatment trends of CTS outcomes by physician specialty.  However, using the NAMCS, 
17:408:34216:27:28:72:530:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:I can examine differences in the trends between the treatment and control groups for visit-level 
17:409:34313:28:27:72:537:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:outcomes such as amount of time spent with the physician.  Figure 2 shows the average duration 
17:410:34408:27:28:72:536:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of a physician visit by specialty between 1993 and 2002.  The dashed vertical line represents the 
17:411:34506:28:28:72:529:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:implementation year of SCHIP for the vast majority of states.12  Prior to the implementation of 
17:412:34602:28:27:72:526:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:SCHIP, the average duration for each specialty followed generally similar trends.  After 1998, 
17:413:34697:27:28:72:527:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the average duration for a visit between physician types exhibits a sharp break.  Although they 
17:414:34793:28:27:72:524:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:are for a different outcome and data, combined with the descriptive statistics in Table 1, these 
17:415:34890:27:28:72:443:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:similar pre-treatment trends provide additional support for the DD strategy.   
17:416:34969:28:27:108:530:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:Recall that states were given discretion over the size of their program, including setting 
17:417:35060:27:28:71:499:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:income eligibility limits.  If physicians’ responses to the expansion of a public insurance 
17:418:35152:28:28:72:527:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:expansion are related to the scale of the program, then this variation in program sizes provides 
17:419:35249:28:27:72:530:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:valuable information. One naïve method of exploiting the state-based variation in program size 
17:420:35344:27:28:72:505:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:classifies states by the number of children actually enrolled in the program.  This method, 
17:421:35436:28:18:72:474:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:however, conflates other factors such as changes in local economic conditions with

17:423:35579:7:16:72:515:159:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:11 The most striking way in which pediatricians differ from other physicians is that pediatricians are almost all 
17:424:35693:16:12:71:539:143:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:primary care physicians.  While the main results of my analysis will pertain to a comparison group of all physicians, 
17:425:35811:12:11:71:530:131:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:I also estimated results containing only primary care physicians.  This smaller sample size decreases precision but 
17:426:35927:11:12:71:506:120:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:produces results of similar magnitude.  Finding similar results with this more limited control group provides 
17:427:36037:12:7:71:428:108:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f3:F:suggestive evidence that using the full sample of physicians is not biasing the estimates.  
17:428:36129:7:16:72:533:101:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:12 NAMCS does not contain state identifiers and, therefore, it is not possible to perfectly identify when SCHIP was 
17:429:36245:16:11:71:536:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:implemented for each physician.  Examining data from the simulated eligibility measure, I find that 1998 marks the 
17:430:36360:11:0:71:535:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:first year of a large increase in the percentage of children who are eligible for Medicaid and SCHIP in most states.   
18:431:36483:0:27:72:504:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:programmatic changes such as income eligibility limits.  If local economic conditions are

18:433:36667:28:27:72:505:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:biased estimates of the effect of public health insurance expansions on supplier behavior.  
18:434:36759:27:28:108:526:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:This problem in identifying state variation in the size of Medicaid expansions was first 
18:435:36848:28:28:72:508:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:identified in Cutler and Gruber (1996).  To overcome the problem, the authors generated a 
18:436:36938:28:27:72:521:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:simulated eligibility measure. Gruber and Simon (2008) implemented a similar procedure for 
18:437:37029:27:28:72:499:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:SCHIP.  Under this procedure, the Medicaid and SCHIP eligibility was determined for a 
18:438:37115:28:27:72:515:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:nationally-representative sample of children under the age of 19 from the 1996 CPS (whose 
18:439:37205:27:28:72:529:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:family income was adjusted for inflation in subsequent years).  This eligibility was determined 
18:440:37301:28:28:71:473:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:using program rules in place in 1996, 1999, and 2001—the years for which there is 
18:441:37383:28:27:71:493:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:corresponding CTS data.  Simulated eligibility was then aggregated to the state level to 
18:442:37472:27:28:71:538:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:determine the percentage of children under the age of 19 from the CPS sample eligible for either 
18:443:37569:28:27:71:539:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Medicaid or SCHIP in each year in each state.13  Changes in this percentage provide an unbiased 
18:444:37665:27:28:72:523:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:measure of state-level differences in program rules.  The following analysis explores whether 
18:445:37759:28:27:72:432:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:physicians’ responsiveness varies with the magnitude of state expansions.

18:447:37920:28:28:71:536:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:expansion.  Between 1996 and 2001, the average increase in the percentage of children from the 
18:448:38015:28:27:72:514:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:national sample eligible for this public insurance coverage was 20.9 percentage points.  For 
18:449:38108:27:28:72:534:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:states included in the CTS, the smallest increase was 5.4 percentage points in North Dakota and

19:463:39277:28:27:72:534:537:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:described above.  The coefficient of interest is β2.  Under the assumption that the pre-expansion 
19:464:39375:27:28:71:539:510:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:trends in hours worked are common across all physicians, this coefficient represents the effect of

19:468:39724:28:27:71:540:399:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:discussed above, states that created a separate state program instead of expanding Medicaid were 
19:469:39821:27:28:71:535:372:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:also allowed to make programmatic changes such as different provider networks, administrative

19:471:40010:28:27:71:510:316:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:physician participation in the program by decreasing the difference between the public and 
19:472:40101:27:28:71:535:289:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:private insurance plans.  Another significant difference is that in states with a separate program, 
19:473:40201:28:27:72:529:261:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:physicians could choose to treat SCHIP patients without opening their practice to all Medicaid 
19:474:40296:27:28:72:511:234:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:patients—limiting the impact of the decision to participate in the program.  To address any 
19:475:40388:28:28:72:497:206:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:concerns of bias from these programmatic differences, I generate estimates for a sample 
19:476:40476:28:27:72:288:178:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:containing only Medicaid expansion states.   
19:477:40521:27:28:108:540:151:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:The underlying assumption of the differences-in-differences model is that the behavior of

20:480:40802:0:27:72:537:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:were other unmeasured and time varying factors differentially affecting only pediatricians in the 
20:481:40900:27:28:72:539:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:low-Medicaid exposure sample, β2 would provide a biased measure of the effect of SCHIP.  This 
20:482:40994:28:27:72:514:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:potential bias can be overcome by using the behavior of another group of pediatricians who 
20:483:41085:27:28:72:530:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:should react similarly to secular trends and contemporaneous shocks but are unaffected, or less 
20:484:41181:28:28:72:534:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:affected, by the implementation of SCHIP.  Under the predictions of the mixed economy model 
20:485:41273:28:27:72:522:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:above, SCHIP should not affect either the Medicaid participation or labor supply decisions of 
20:486:41367:27:28:72:516:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:physicians who are already heavily participating in the Medicaid program.  Therefore, these 
20:487:41459:28:27:72:485:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:physicians can be used as an additional control for specialty specific secular trends or

20:509:42322:27:28:72:517:219:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Therefore, I also estimate specifications of equation (1) and (2) with dependent variables for

20:513:42626:28:27:108:543:108:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:The shortcomings of the NAMCS make the empirical strategy above infeasible with these 
20:514:42712:27:0:72:502:81:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:data, and I propose an alternative empirical strategy here.  Instead of using state and time 
21:515:42809:0:27:72:541:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:variation in SCHIP, I exploit the fact that most states implemented their program in 1998 and use 
21:516:42907:27:28:72:532:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:temporal variation to identify the effect of the program on physician practice patterns.  Because 
21:517:43005:28:27:72:523:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:physicians cannot be grouped based on their pre-expansion Medicaid revenue in the NAMCS 
21:518:43093:27:28:72:529:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:data, the sample for these estimates will contain a large number of high Medicaid participating

21:520:43282:28:27:72:528:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:This generates a bias away from finding an effect of the program on visit duration.  With these 
21:521:43378:27:28:72:321:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:caveats in mind, I estimate the following equation:

21:533:44385:27:28:107:481:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:  The inability to track physicians over time in the NAMCS rules out the DDD

22:540:44992:28:27:71:505:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:had similar trends, this DDD strategy will provide consistent estimates of the effect of the 
22:541:45085:27:28:71:536:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:implementation of SCHIP on visit length.  Figure 3 contains the average visit length for patients 
22:542:45183:28:28:71:512:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:visiting pediatricians by insurance status and year.  Except for a separation in 1996, the pre-
22:543:45278:28:27:71:542:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:expansion trends in visit length for these two groups of patients are similar, providing support for 
22:544:45379:27:28:71:375:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the underlying assumption of the DDD identification strategy.  
22:545:45442:28:27:98:529:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:      The validity of the estimates hinges on the parallel trend assumption.  While Figure 2 
22:546:45535:27:28:72:529:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and 3 provide some evidence of these trends, a more rigorous exploration of this assumption is 
22:547:45630:28:28:71:488:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:provided by the event time graphs shown in Figure 4 and 5.  These graphs provide the

22:551:46005:27:28:71:521:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:shorter than 10 minutes.  Year 0 in these graphs represents 1998, the first year of SCHIP. For 
22:552:46100:28:27:71:540:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:reasons described in Section VI, the estimates are generally imprecise and volatile. However, the 
22:553:46198:27:28:71:510:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:figures do provide some suggestive evidence: for both the log of the visit length and a visit 
22:554:46292:28:28:71:510:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:length being less than or equal to ten minutes, the trend prior to 1998 is relatively smooth.  
22:555:46387:28:27:71:525:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Following 1998, for both figures, there is a general decrease in visit length and increase in the 
22:556:46485:27:28:72:516:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:probability of a visit length of less than ten minutes.  This pattern is most apparent for visits

22:558:46676:27:28:72:529:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:estimates on the interaction term for the years before 1998 is equal to zero at a p-value of 0.10.

22:561:46835:8:16:72:517:101:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:15 This DDD strategy would not work if physicians provided similar visit lengths regardless of insurance type.

23:574:48021:28:27:71:541:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:coefficient for these pediatricians is -9.57, statistically significant at a p-value of 0.05.  Under the

23:578:48419:28:27:71:529:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:increase in SCHIP, the policy change decreased hours by approximately 1.6 hours; for those at

23:580:48602:28:28:72:499:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:pediatricians reported spending an average of 41.9 hours on patient care, suggesting that 
23:581:48692:28:61:72:548:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:physicians exposed to the average increase decreased their patient care hours by nearly 5 percent.

23:587:49313:11:12:71:539:120:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:care physicians in Medicaid expansion states returned a statistically significant (p-value <0.10) coefficient of -7.996 
23:588:49433:12:11:71:537:108:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:(4.268).  This corresponds to a decrease of 1.7 hours per week spent on direct patient care for physicians exposed to 
23:589:49551:11:12:71:527:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:the average expansion.  Overall, the estimates from the sample of primary care physicians in Medicaid expansion 
23:590:49663:12:11:71:542:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:states are similar in magnitude but less precisely estimated than the corresponding estimates in Table 3.  This finding 
23:591:49783:11:0:71:489:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:should not be surprising given the smaller sample size when only considering primary care physicians.

24:605:51054:27:28:72:514:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:estimates are uniformly larger and more precisely estimated than those for the sample of all 
24:606:51147:28:27:72:527:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:physicians.  For example, the estimated effect on hours spent on patient care for low Medicaid 
24:607:51242:27:28:72:535:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:participating pediatricians is 3.48 hours—a decrease in hours of 7.5 percent.  While the equality 
24:608:51340:28:28:72:516:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of the two estimates cannot be rejected with 95 percent confidence, this result is statistically

24:612:51741:27:28:72:517:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the difference in program structure, it should not be surprising that the estimated decrease in 
24:613:51837:28:0:72:468:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:hours for the Medicaid expansion states are larger in magnitude and more precise. 
25:614:51923:0:27:108:499:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:   While the results from the CTS clearly show reduced physician labor supply in

25:618:52289:28:28:71:511:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:hypothesized direction.  Specifically, SCHIP is associated with negative point estimates on

25:622:52593:27:28:72:533:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:slightly larger and are more precisely estimated than the estimates in column (1).  For example, 
25:623:52690:28:28:72:536:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the estimate for visit length suggests a 1.2 minute decline in visit length, with a p-value of 0.11.  
25:624:52792:28:27:72:537:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:In the pre-expansion time period, pediatricians spent an average of 13.12 minutes in office visits 
25:625:52891:27:28:72:514:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:with Medicaid patients—suggesting that SCHIP decreased visit lengths by approximately 9 
25:626:52979:28:27:72:524:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:percent.  The estimates in the third row show that the implementation of SCHIP increased the

25:628:53174:28:27:72:508:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:This estimate is statistically significant at the 0.10 level.17 It is important to note that these 
25:629:53273:27:28:72:528:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:estimates correspond to the amount of time spent with the physician and not the length of time 
25:630:53368:28:28:72:500:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the physician spends in the office.  Therefore, the estimate effect could simply indicate a 
25:631:53460:28:27:71:528:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:substitution of physician time with services from other employees such as a nurse practitioner.

25:635:53807:8:16:72:533:147:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:17 It is important to note that the imprecision of these results is likely driven by the inability to group physicians by 
25:636:53929:16:11:71:511:131:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:their pre-expansion participation in Medicaid or the generosity of their state program.  For example, if you re-

25:638:54156:12:11:71:527:108:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:for state program generosity you get estimated effects that are approximately half the size of those in Table 3 and

25:641:54505:11:0:71:218:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:insignificant at conventional levels.  
26:642:54548:0:27:72:518:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:pre-expansion data provides support for the identification strategy discussed above.  Using a 
26:643:54642:27:28:72:495:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:sample containing the years 1993-1998 and a placebo implementation date of 1995, the 
26:644:54727:28:27:72:533:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:estimated DD coefficient for having a ten minute or less is -0.0541 (0.055).  The DDD estimate 
26:645:54822:27:28:72:503:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:for the outcome of having a ten minute or less visit, which was the only estimate that was 
26:646:54913:28:28:72:521:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:statistically significant in Table 4, for the same sample and placebo date is -0.0018 (0.0668).  
26:647:55010:28:27:99:512:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:Taken together, evidence from the CTS and the NAMCS that the expansion of public 
26:648:55091:27:28:72:491:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:health insurance through the creation of SCHIP decreased the number of weekly hours 
26:649:55175:28:27:72:531:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:physicians spent with patients.  In the CTS, this appears as a reduced number of hours spent on 
26:650:55271:27:28:71:524:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:direct patient care.  This result is supported by the suggestive evidence from the NAMCS that 
26:651:55365:28:28:71:539:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:visit lengths for Medicaid patients seeing pediatricians declined following the implementation of 
26:652:55463:28:27:72:501:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:SCHIP.  The activities for a physician described by the NAMCS visit length variable are 
26:653:55551:27:28:71:453:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:comparable to those involved in the “direct patient care” measure in the CTS.   
26:654:55631:28:27:98:511:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:The decrease in visit length helps to reconcile the observed change in physician labor 
26:655:55718:27:28:71:510:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:supply with other work documenting increased access to care as a result of previous health 
26:656:55809:28:27:71:522:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:insurance expansions.  Most prominently, Currie and Gruber (1996) found that expansions in 
26:657:55900:27:28:71:541:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Medicaid increased the probability that eligible children would have an office based doctor visit.  
26:658:56000:28:28:72:516:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:This result could occur at the same time as a general decline in physician labor supply if the 
26:659:56095:28:27:72:528:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:primary means of reducing labor supply was through shorter (rather than simply fewer) visits.  
26:660:56190:27:28:99:102:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: 
26:661:56190:28:27:72:411:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:IX. The Effect of SCHIP on Physician Participation in Medicaid 
26:662:56252:27:28:108:528:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f2:?: In addition to decreasing hours worked, the model above predicts that the expansion of 
26:663:56339:28:28:72:521:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:SCHIP should increase physician participation in the public program.  There are a number of 
26:664:56431:28:0:72:541:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:ways to measure physician participation in Medicaid.  At its most basic, the model predicts that a 
27:665:56534:0:27:72:524:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:greater percentage of all physicians should treat Medicaid patients following the expansion of 
27:666:56629:27:28:72:522:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:SCHIP.  The first column in top panel of Table 5 reports estimates for equation (1) where the 
27:667:56723:28:27:72:534:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:dependent variable equals 1 if a physician reports receiving any income from Medicaid.  This is 
27:668:56819:27:28:72:546:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the most accurate means in the CTS of identifying if physicians see at least one Medicaid patient.  
27:669:56919:28:28:72:522:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:For the sample of all physicians, the proportion of pediatricians seeing any Medicaid patients 
27:670:57014:28:27:72:506:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:increased by 2.93 percentage points with the implementation of SCHIP (p-value < 0.05).   
27:671:57103:27:28:108:524:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: Another measure for Medicaid participation is changing patient acceptance policies to 
27:672:57189:28:27:72:520:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:accept new patients from the program.  The CTS asks physicians if their practice is currently 
27:673:57283:27:28:72:535:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:accepting patients from Medicaid.  The middle panel of results in Table 5 contains the estimates 
27:674:57380:28:28:72:541:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:for equation (1) where the dependent indicator variable equals 1 if the physician reports that their 
27:675:57481:28:27:72:486:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:practice accepts new Medicaid patients.  For all physicians, under the assumption that 
27:676:57568:27:28:72:512:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:pediatricians will react similarly to those in other specialties, the implementation of SCHIP 
27:677:57662:28:27:72:517:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:increased the probability of accepting new Medicaid patients by 3.6 percentage points.18  As 
27:678:57755:27:28:71:517:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:predicted, the estimates in column (2) and (3) suggest that this change is driven primarily by 
27:679:57850:28:27:71:541:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:physicians who were previously low-Medicaid participators.  The DDD estimate in column (3) is 
27:680:57944:27:28:71:480:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:statistically significant (p-value <0.05) and similar in magnitude to the DD estimate. 
27:681:58031:28:28:107:498:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f2:?: Following the implementation of SCHIP, the CTS did not ask separate questions 
27:682:58109:28:27:71:507:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:regarding a physician’s involvement with SCHIP and Medicaid.  That is, there are no data 
27:683:58198:27:22:71:522:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:describing physician participation in SCHIP separate from Medicaid.  However, this problem 
27:684:58289:22:7:72:218:190:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:                                                            
27:685:58349:7:16:72:499:183:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:18 Similar to the labor supply results, there may be a concern that a differing concentration of primary care 
27:686:58459:16:12:71:542:167:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:physicians among pediatricians may bias these Medicaid participation estimates.  In order to examine this question, I 
27:687:58577:12:12:71:536:155:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:re-estimated the results in Table 5 using a sample of physicians who are classified in the CTS as being primary care 
27:688:58694:12:11:71:530:143:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:physicians.  The unreported coefficient for low-Medicaid participating physicians was a statistically significant (p-
27:689:58811:11:11:71:534:132:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:value <0.05) 0.5335 (0.2771) suggesting that the expansion of SCHIP caused an increase in Medicaid participation 
27:690:58924:11:12:71:538:121:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:among low-Medicaid participating physicians of approximately 11 percent.  This is very similar in magnitude to the 
27:691:59039:12:11:71:515:109:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:corresponding estimate in Table 5.  Overall, the unreported results using only primary care physicians provide 
27:692:59150:11:12:71:538:98:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:evidence that the estimates above are not the result of differing pre-SCHIP trends between the treatment and control 
27:693:59267:12:12:71:406:86:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:group resulting from pediatricians being more likely to be primary care physicians. 
27:694:59351:12:0:71:73:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F: 
28:695:59356:0:27:72:530:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:does not affect physicians located in states that did not create a separate state SCHIP program.  
28:696:59454:27:28:72:512:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:The bottom panel of Table 5 reports estimates from the same equations as the top panel for 
28:697:59545:28:27:72:538:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:pediatricians in these Medicaid expansion states.  The estimates in the bottom panel are larger in 
28:698:59644:27:28:72:531:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:magnitude than their counterparts in the top panel.  For example, the increase in the probability 
28:699:59742:28:28:72:504:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of treating any new Medicaid patients is approximately 50 percent larger in these states.19 
28:700:59833:28:27:107:520:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:The final measure of Medicaid participation is the amount of revenue received by the 
28:701:59918:27:28:72:530:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:practice from the public program.  Recall from above that one concern with the CTS is that the 
28:702:60013:28:27:72:537:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:revenue data refer to practice rather individual physician revenue.  While there is a large amount 
28:703:60112:27:28:72:535:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of correlation between physician and practice revenue in many settings, this correlation is likely 
28:704:60211:28:28:72:540:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:weaker in setting such as large multi-specialty practices, hospitals, or clinics.  Therefore, Table 6 
28:705:60313:28:27:72:521:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:contains the estimates from equation (1) with a dependent variable equal to the percentage of 
28:706:60407:27:28:72:542:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:practice revenue from Medicaid for a sample of physicians who report being in either solo or two 
28:707:60504:28:27:71:517:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:physician practices.  In these settings, the practice revenue closely reflects the revenue of an 
28:708:60601:27:28:72:539:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:individual physician.  Column (1) of Table 6 contains the estimates for a sample of physicians in 
28:709:60699:28:27:71:532:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:all states.  The passage of SCHIP is associated with a 1.45 percentage point increase (p-value < 
28:710:60796:27:28:72:530:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:0.10) in revenue from Medicaid.  The effect for low-Medicaid participating pediatricians was a 
28:711:60891:28:28:72:301:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:2.6 percentage point increase (p-value < 0.05).  
28:712:60940:28:27:108:534:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:As discussed above, in addition to the concern over practice level revenue the CTS does 
28:713:61028:27:28:71:523:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:not ask questions about SCHIP revenue separate from Medicaid revenue.  Therefore, revenue 
28:714:61118:28:27:71:537:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:data for physicians in states with separate SCHIP programs should not account for revenue from 
28:715:61213:27:25:72:512:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:these programs.  Columns 2, 3 and 4 of Table 6 present separate analyses for three types of 
28:716:61305:25:8:72:218:132:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:                                                            
28:717:61365:8:16:72:536:124:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:19 A key difference between the larger effects for the participation results (compared to the hours worked results) in 
28:718:61484:16:11:71:519:108:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:Medicaid expansion states, is that the increase in magnitude is a combination of a change in physician behavior 
28:719:61596:11:12:71:531:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:resulting from differences in program structure and a data reporting issue related to the lack of a separate question 
28:720:61714:12:11:71:511:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:for SCHIP.  In the hours worked results above, these data reporting issues are not a concern and therefore the 
28:721:61825:11:0:71:398:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:difference in the estimates for those results is related solely to program structure. 
29:722:61915:0:27:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:SCHIP expansions: separate state programs, Medicaid expansions, and states which implemented 
29:723:62008:27:28:72:504:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:a combination of these programs. The estimated effect on the percentage of revenue from 
29:724:62096:28:27:72:536:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Medicaid increases monotonically as the role of Medicaid in the expansion increases.  For states 
29:725:62193:27:28:72:518:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:with only a state SCHIP program, the revenue increase is not statistically significant for low-
29:726:62288:28:28:72:528:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Medicaid participation pediatricians.  For physicians practicing in states with a combination of 
29:727:62385:28:27:72:532:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the two expansion types, there is a 1.97 percentage point increase that is statistically significant 
29:728:62486:27:28:72:511:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:at a p-value of 0.05.  I find the largest effect for low-Medicaid participating physicians in a 
29:729:62582:28:27:72:462:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Medicaid expansion states—a 9.34 percentage point increase (p-value < 0.05).20  
29:730:62662:27:28:108:524:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:One might also ask whether adjustments in physician participation in Medicaid reflect 
29:731:62748:28:28:72:527:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:changes in physician business practices across dimensions that are unrelated to SCHIP.  If this 
29:732:62844:28:27:72:530:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:were true, then we might expect to find changes in the percentage of revenue or the probability 
29:733:62940:27:28:72:522:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of treating at least one patient from other insurance programs. The CTS asks questions on the 
29:734:63034:28:27:72:532:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:percentage of revenue from managed care insurers or from pre-paid capitated insurers.  Table 7 
29:735:63129:27:28:71:525:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:contains estimates of the effect of SCHIP expansions on physician participation in these other 
29:736:63224:28:27:71:507:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:programs for all physicians and those in small practice settings.  None of the estimates are 
29:737:63317:27:28:71:533:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:statistically significant, suggesting that the main participation results are not simply reflecting a 
29:738:63419:28:28:71:259:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:general change in business practices.21

29:744:63749:12:11:71:528:154:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:program would not necessarily be reported to the CTS as “Medicaid revenue,” while the increase in revenue from 
29:745:63860:11:12:71:529:143:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:SCHIP in Medicaid expansion states would be included.  Therefore, revenue estimates from states with a separate 
29:746:63972:12:7:71:373:131:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:state program should be considered an underestimate of the revenue effect. 
29:747:64047:7:16:72:498:124:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:21 Given that some patients are shifting from the private market to Medicaid following SCHIP, it might be 
29:748:64153:16:11:71:536:108:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:reasonable to expect a decrease for some of these insurance programs.  Since the CTS does not distinguish between 
29:749:64267:11:12:71:528:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:Medicaid managed care and private manage care, it is not clear if these managed care patients are solely from the 
29:750:64381:12:11:71:539:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:private sector or if they are part of Medicaid managed care.  The estimated effects for the pre-paid capitated systems 
29:751:64500:11:0:71:200:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:are negative for each instance.

30:753:64552:27:28:108:508:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:Under a simple set of assumptions, a mixed-economy model of physician behavior 
30:754:64631:28:27:72:508:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:predicts that a public health insurance program should lead to a decrease in the quantity of 
30:755:64724:27:28:72:542:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:medical services provided by physicians and an increase in physician participation.  In this paper, 
30:756:64824:28:28:72:515:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:I provide empirical evidence supporting these predictions. Following the implementation of 
30:757:64915:28:27:72:524:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:SCHIP, pediatricians with little previous participation in the Medicaid program decreased the 
30:758:65009:27:28:72:501:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:number of weekly hours spent on patient care.  Evidence from the NAMCS suggests that 
30:759:65094:28:27:72:539:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:physicians’ labor supply decrease plays out through shorter visits with each patient.  Overall, the 
30:760:65194:27:28:72:529:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:introduction of new public health insurance programs may simply change the nature of patient-
30:761:65287:28:28:72:539:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:physician interactions—for example, physicians could rely on physician assistants and registered 
30:762:65384:28:27:72:532:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:nurses to provide more basic medical services.  Additional research is needed to investigate the 
30:763:65481:27:28:72:266:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:welfare effects of the program change.   
30:764:65522:28:27:108:515:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:Results from this paper can help economists and policymakers understand physician 
30:765:65604:27:28:72:509:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:responses to policy changes such as the public health insurance expansion contained in the 
30:766:65695:28:27:72:510:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:recently-passed PPACA in the United States.  While many policies are being implemented 
30:767:65782:27:28:72:538:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:simultaneously in the PPACA, results from my current study suggest that the effect of the public 
30:768:65879:28:28:72:532:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:insurance expansion-related changes should increase physician participation in the program but 
30:769:65974:28:27:72:519:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:lower physician labor supply.  This information should be integrated into any analysis of the 
30:770:66068:27:28:72:225:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:overall effect of the legislation. 
30:771:66103:28:27:108:533:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:It is important to note that this study focuses on a policy’s short run effects on Medicaid 
30:772:66195:27:28:72:531:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:participation and physician labor supply.  Further research is needed to understand the long run 
30:773:66292:28:28:72:538:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:general equilibrium effects, particularly the impact on the total number of physicians and overall 
30:774:66391:28:0:72:513:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:physician quality.  As government involvement in the healthcare sector changes and policy-
31:775:66485:0:27:72:499:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:makers discuss the possibility of a “public option” government insurance program in the 
31:776:66573:27:28:72:522:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:forthcoming insurance exchanges, these long run effects become increasingly important.  For 
31:777:66665:28:27:72:532:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:example, changes in the expected return to physicians may decrease the total number or quality 
31:778:66760:27:28:72:509:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of individuals applying to medical school.  While not addressing this question directly, my 
31:779:66852:28:28:72:437:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:finding that patient hours decreased following SCHIP is not encouraging.    
31:780:66928:28:27:108:535:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:In addition to building our understanding the effects a public health insurance expansion 
31:781:67018:27:28:72:532:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:on physician behavior, results of the current paper shed light on the target efficiency of SCHIP. 
31:782:67116:28:27:72:530:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:The existing literature contains a wide range of estimates of the degree of crowd-out, including 
31:783:67213:27:28:72:491:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:some studies that find that all newly enrolled public health insurance recipients did not 
31:784:67303:28:28:72:530:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:previously have health coverage.  The pattern of results with respect to labor supply and public 
31:785:67400:28:27:72:529:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:program participation that I identify suggests market effects are being driven by changes in the 
31:786:67497:27:28:72:514:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:marginal patient and not by changes in the physician labor supply curve. Since these results 
31:787:67590:28:27:72:504:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:could only occur in the presence of some degree of crowd out, this paper provides further
