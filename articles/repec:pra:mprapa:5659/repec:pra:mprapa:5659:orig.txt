2:37:997:14:13:92:480:220:127:Times:127:Times:The relation between work organisation and technological practices in auto industry is 
2:38:1084:13:13:92:486:207:127:Times:127:Times:analysed in this article. The concept  of “technological practice” in this sector is used to 
2:39:1177:13:14:92:472:194:127:Times:127:Times:describe the specific ways of embedding information and communication technology 
2:40:1258:14:13:92:507:180:127:Times:127:Times:applications into the organizational forms and cultural patterns. This concept was developed 
2:41:1351:13:13:92:514:167:127:Times:127:Times:with the Sowing project (TSER, DG XII) and that approach included either the shop floor co-
2:42:1442:13:14:92:508:154:127:Times:127:Times:operation up to the regionally based networks of companies and supporting institutions. The 
2:43:1534:14:13:92:489:140:127:Times:127:Times:authors studied different sectors in the automotive firms of different European countries 
2:44:1624:13:13:92:503:127:127:Times:127:Times:(Germany, Belgium and Portugal): shopfloor and production lines, design and management 
2:45:1711:13:13:92:517:114:127:Times:127:Times:and the local inter-relationships. It was underlined some evidencies of the different alternatives 
2:46:1810:13:14:92:471:101:127:Times:127:Times:in terms of technological practices for the same sector. Much of the litterature try to 
2:47:1898:14:13:92:488:87:127:Times:127:Times:disseminate an idea of a single (and optimum) organisational model for the same type of 
2:48:1986:13:0:92:492:74:127:Times:127:Times:product. And here, even with the same type of technology, and of product (medium-high 
3:49:2073:0:13:92:489:714:127:Times:127:Times:range), one can find different models, different cultures, different ways of organising the 
3:50:2165:13:13:92:481:701:127:Times:127:Times:industrial structure (firms, regional institutions, R&D centres) in the same sector (auto 
3:51:2255:13:25:92:138:688:127:Times:127:Times:industry).

4:90:4621:16:15:92:504:624:171:Times:171:Times:This paper refers to the relation between work organisation and technological 
4:91:4699:15:15:92:500:609:171:Times:171:Times:practices in automobile industry. The concept  of “technological practice” in 
4:92:4777:15:16:92:509:594:171:Times:171:Times:this sector is used to describe the specific ways of embedding information and 
4:93:4856:16:16:92:518:578:171:Times:171:Times:communication technology (ICT) applications into the organizational forms and 
4:94:4934:16:15:92:505:562:171:Times:171:Times:cultural patterns. This concept was developed with the Sowing project (TSER 
4:95:5010:15:16:92:515:547:171:Times:171:Times:Programme-Targeted Socio Economical Research, European Commission) that 
4:96:5082:16:15:92:467:531:171:Times:171:Times:analysed the process of such practices held in different intra- and inter-
4:97:5156:15:16:92:501:516:171:Times:171:Times:organizational fields. This research project involved eight European research 
4:98:5234:16:15:92:501:500:171:Times:171:Times:institutes from similar number of countries (WRC of University of Tampere, 
4:99:5309:15:16:92:520:485:171:Times:171:Times:Finland; ITAS-Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Germany; Nexus Europe, Ireland; 
4:100:5384:16:16:92:476:469:171:Times:171:Times:IRES, Italy, Fac. Sciences & Technology of  University Nova of Lisbon, 
4:101:5455:16:15:92:484:453:171:Times:171:Times:Portugal; HIVA of Leuven University, Belgium; Institute of Employment 
4:102:5525:15:16:92:501:438:171:Times:171:Times:Studies, United Kingdom,  and FORBA, Austria). The aim of the firm survey 
4:103:5598:16:15:92:516:422:171:Times:171:Times:was to focus on the opinions and perceptions of company managers in the eight 
4:104:5676:15:16:92:520:407:171:Times:171:Times:regions. It was decided that the number of observations would be small (100 per 
4:105:5755:16:15:92:514:391:171:Times:171:Times:region) in order to  have comprehensive data concerning all the aspects relevant 
4:106:5835:15:16:92:496:376:171:Times:171:Times:in the research. Since the sample was small, it was considered impossible to 
4:107:5912:16:16:92:509:360:171:Times:171:Times:conduct a representative sectorial analysis by limiting the number of industrial 
4:108:5992:16:15:92:496:344:171:Times:171:Times:sectors, as many sectors were heterogeneous. The small numbers of cases in 
4:109:6066:15:16:92:494:329:171:Times:171:Times:each sector do not allo w to cover their diversity, so the samples in different 
4:110:6145:16:15:92:512:313:171:Times:171:Times:regions may very well cover companies of a different nature. This happened to 
4:111:6223:15:16:92:508:298:171:Times:171:Times:be the case of the automob ile sector. In all cases it was mailed a questionnaire 
4:112:6305:16:27:92:233:282:171:Times:171:Times:and conducted interviews. 
4:113:6329:27:15:92:472:255:171:Times:171:Times:In this article, we will describe the technological practice relying on the 
4:114:6405:15:16:92:505:240:171:Times:171:Times:automobile industry in three of those European countries (Germany, Belgium 
4:115:6480:16:15:92:468:224:171:Times:171:Times:and Portugal). The research focus on the question is how the emerging 
4:116:6550:15:16:92:510:209:171:Times:171:Times:technological practices within companies were influenced by the ICT and how 
4:117:6626:16:16:92:486:193:171:Times:171:Times:these technologies have been supported by the institutions of regional and 
4:118:6701:16:15:92:511:177:171:Times:171:Times:national environments. Methodologically the concept of technological practise 
4:119:6779:15:16:92:519:162:171:Times:171:Times:was divided into three levels: the level of application, the level of organisational 
4:120:6864:16:15:92:489:146:171:Times:171:Times:change and the level of the firm's culture. Thus we could identify different 
4:121:6941:15:27:92:451:131:171:Times:171:Times:concepts of technological practises in different European countries. 
4:122:7009:27:16:92:506:104:171:Times:171:Times:The automob ile industry played an important role o f the empirical findings in 
4:123:7089:16:15:92:501:88:171:Times:171:Times:different countries. Here we have been analysed the findings from Germany, 
4:124:7164:15:0:92:485:73:171:Times:171:Times:Belgium and Portugal, where the industrial structures are know to be very 
5:125:7239:0:27:92:144:713:171:Times:171:Times:different. 
5:126:7249:27:16:92:500:686:171:Times:171:Times:The production logic of VCG-Volvo Cars Ghent (Belgium) and AutoEuropa 
5:127:7319:16:16:92:497:670:171:Times:171:Times:(Portugal) still shows some characteristics of Fordism, such as its traditional 
5:128:7399:16:15:92:498:654:171:Times:171:Times:belt-driven assembly line and production jobs co ntaining mainly short-cycle 
5:129:7476:15:15:92:480:639:171:Times:171:Times:tasks. On other hand, the team concept is implemented and supported by 
5:130:7547:15:16:92:495:624:171:Times:171:Times:intensive rotation-schemes. The VW-Volkswagen group factory in Portugal 
5:131:7619:16:16:92:520:608:171:Times:171:Times:revealed an interesting dimension, and that is the specificity of the local network 
5:132:7703:16:15:92:516:592:171:Times:171:Times:of institutions and firms that developed new forms of co-operation with evident 
5:133:7783:15:16:92:518:577:171:Times:171:Times:regional impact. At Daimler Benz (Germany) the analysis was done specifically 
5:134:7861:16:15:92:475:561:171:Times:171:Times:to the service sector, although the changes are of the same type as in the 
5:135:7936:15:27:92:204:546:171:Times:171:Times:automobile division. 
5:136:7956:27:16:92:512:519:171:Times:171:Times:In spite of the expectation of the project, a turning point in the evolution of  the 
5:137:8041:16:15:92:500:503:171:Times:171:Times:companies organizational culture can nonetheless be made out. The Daimler-
5:138:8115:15:16:92:499:488:171:Times:171:Times:Benz group had been active on the global level much earlier than the merger 
5:139:8191:16:16:92:510:472:171:Times:171:Times:with Chrysler, but executive functions were – culturally and organizationally – 
5:140:8270:16:15:92:520:456:171:Times:171:Times:still strongly imbedded in regional and national structures. This, however, seems 
5:141:8352:15:16:92:449:441:171:Times:171:Times:to have come to an end with the merger with Chrysler. Information 
5:142:8418:16:15:92:493:425:171:Times:171:Times:technologies, however, can’t be held responsible (in the sense of giving the 
5:143:8495:15:16:92:466:410:171:Times:171:Times:impulse) for these various transformations, but are rather to be seen as 
5:144:8568:16:27:92:482:394:171:Times:171:Times:technologies which support this process, and make it technically feasible. 
5:145:8642:27:15:92:505:367:171:Times:171:Times:So, in this paper, we will be underline some  evidencies of the importance and 
5:146:8721:15:16:92:497:352:171:Times:171:Times:different alternatives in terms of technological practices for the same sector. 
5:147:8801:16:15:92:456:336:171:Times:171:Times:Generally the litterature describes the idea of a single and optimized 
5:148:8872:15:16:92:476:321:171:Times:171:Times:organisational model for the same type of product [cf. 2, 12, 16], where 
5:149:8944:16:16:92:507:305:171:Times:171:Times:contingency can be found [9, 10]. But even with the same type of technology, 
5:150:9021:16:15:92:465:289:171:Times:171:Times:one can identify different models, different cultures, different ways of 
5:151:9094:15:16:92:512:274:171:Times:171:Times:organising the industrial structure (firms, regional institutions, R&D centres) in 
5:152:9177:16:15:92:512:258:171:Times:171:Times:the same sector (auto industry). Technological practise cannot be regarded as a 
5:153:9257:15:27:92:436:243:171:Times:171:Times:single pattern, which takes part in the global production process.

5:156:9346:30:15:92:511:159:171:Times:171:Times:In the Sowing project conclusion, we could find for all the sectors that modern 
5:157:9426:15:16:92:521:144:171:Times:171:Times:ICT are providing options for horizontal co-ordination and communication. And 
5:158:9504:16:15:92:483:128:171:Times:171:Times:it becomes the technological basis for the development of intra- and inter-
5:159:9579:15:16:92:494:113:171:Times:171:Times:organisational network forms. However, were found barriers that hinder the 
5:160:9654:16:16:92:468:97:171:Times:171:Times:diffusion of network structures within and between companies. No t all 
5:161:9725:16:0:92:504:81:171:Times:171:Times:companies studied in the Sowing survey apply modern network technologies, 
6:162:9800:0:16:92:511:713:171:Times:171:Times:although the case studies in the automobile  sector demonstrate the use of those 
6:163:9881:16:16:92:493:697:171:Times:171:Times:technologies. And, some  companies didn’t realise the enabling character of 
6:164:9957:16:15:92:467:681:171:Times:171:Times:modern ICT opening up opportunities to designing organisation forms 
6:165:10025:15:27:92:267:666:171:Times:171:Times:according to the network model. 
6:166:10056:27:15:92:494:639:171:Times:171:Times:In this European research project was included quantitative research, with a 
6:167:10133:15:16:92:519:624:171:Times:171:Times:company survey conducted in each country. A questionnaire was designed to be 
6:168:10210:16:16:92:506:608:171:Times:171:Times:administered in the region selected by each project partner. The questionnaire 
6:169:10289:16:15:92:471:592:171:Times:171:Times:addressed the extent and nature of ICT use, aims and barriers related to 
6:170:10362:15:16:92:474:577:171:Times:171:Times:introducing ICTs, companies’ organisational restructuring practices and 
6:171:10434:16:15:92:521:561:171:Times:171:Times:personnel policy as well as managers’ attitudes to modern ICTs. The firm survey 
6:172:10513:15:27:92:322:546:171:Times:228:Times:was conducted at the establishment level.   
6:173:10556:27:16:92:500:519:171:Times:171:Times:Besides the applications of modern ICT, technological practices also include 
6:174:10633:16:15:92:515:503:171:Times:171:Times:organisation forms, companies' strategic goals and specific cultural patterns. As 
6:175:10715:15:16:92:470:488:171:Times:171:Times:the elements of technological practices are closely linked and mutually 
6:176:10787:16:16:92:511:472:171:Times:171:Times:influence each other, we can speak of a process of co-evolution [17]. Also, the 
6:177:10867:16:15:92:499:456:171:Times:171:Times:technological practices can be analysed on different organisational levels. In 
6:178:10946:15:16:92:521:441:171:Times:171:Times:general there exists a variety of technological practices in companies, so one can 
6:179:11028:16:15:92:518:425:171:Times:171:Times:speak of a fractional organisation. Each practice creates a specific potential way 
6:180:11111:15:16:92:489:410:171:Times:171:Times:of use of modern ICTs. The Sowing project research, however, has mainly 
6:181:11183:16:27:92:490:394:171:Times:171:Times:focused on the analysis of technological practices on the organisation level 
6:182:11259:27:15:92:515:367:171:Times:171:Times:The empirical analysis demonstrated that the organisational restructuring seems 
6:183:11339:15:16:92:505:352:171:Times:171:Times:to be a common prac tice within companies. About 7 5% of all companies that 
6:184:11415:16:15:92:515:336:171:Times:171:Times:took part in our study have undergone organisational changes during the period 
6:185:11493:15:16:92:520:321:171:Times:171:Times:1994-1999. In more than half of all cases in which restructuring has taken place, 
6:186:11575:16:16:92:497:305:171:Times:171:Times:modern ICTs were seen as playing an impo rtant role, either as the driving or 
6:187:11653:16:15:92:503:289:171:Times:171:Times:facilitating factor. Over 80% of the companies in the Stuttgart area, Portugal, 
6:188:11733:15:16:92:460:274:171:Times:171:Times:and the Tampere region (three of the studied regions) had introduced 
6:189:11802:16:15:92:493:258:171:Times:171:Times:organisational changes. In particular, companies in Portugal, a nd especially 
6:190:11880:15:16:92:495:243:171:Times:171:Times:companies in the Tampere region, had restructured their organisations more 
6:191:11955:16:27:92:197:227:171:Times:171:Times:extensively (idem). 
6:192:11974:27:15:92:516:200:171:Times:171:Times:Data from this Sowing project also mention that companies in the transport and 
6:193:12052:15:16:92:480:185:171:Times:171:Times:finance sectors, in the business services, in light manufacturing and other 
6:194:12128:16:15:92:480:169:171:Times:171:Times:manufacturing are more advanced in introducing organisational changes, 
6:195:12199:15:16:92:503:154:171:Times:171:Times:whereas companies in the sales and hotel sector are less active in this respect. 
6:196:12280:16:15:92:489:138:171:Times:171:Times:Particularly companies in the manufacturing sectors mention mo dern ICTs 
6:197:12353:15:16:92:464:123:171:Times:171:Times:(EDI, NC machine-tools, robo tics, CAD/CAM, CAP) as an important 
6:198:12418:16:27:92:397:107:171:Times:171:Times:stimulating or enabling f actor for organisational changes. 
6:199:12477:27:0:92:514:80:171:Times:171:Times:The analysis of this firm survey suggests the distintion between four patterns of 
7:200:12560:0:16:92:514:713:171:Times:171:Times:techno-organisational systems. 20% of all companies have not taken steps to re-
7:201:12639:16:16:92:500:697:171:Times:171:Times:structure their organisation form and use ICT only as info rmation processing 
7:202:12717:16:15:92:509:681:171:Times:171:Times:tool, if at all. We can characterise these companies as conservative concerning 
7:203:12797:15:16:92:477:666:171:Times:171:Times:their re-structuring strategy. One out of three companies only focuses its 
7:204:12872:16:15:92:517:650:171:Times:171:Times:modernisation strategy on the use of ICT in the modern form as communication 
7:205:12949:15:16:92:463:635:171:Times:171:Times:device (the technically oriented modernisers), while about 20% of all 
7:206:13019:16:15:92:518:619:171:Times:171:Times:companies focus their renewal strategies on organisational re-structuring, hardly 
7:207:13101:15:27:92:478:604:171:Times:171:Times:using ICT in a modern way (the organisation ally oriented mod ernisers). 
7:208:13173:27:16:92:512:577:171:Times:171:Times:About 25% of  all companies seem to orient their restructuring strategies on the 
7:209:13254:16:15:92:502:561:171:Times:171:Times:network organisation, together with the massive introduction of modern ICT. 
7:210:13330:15:16:92:518:546:171:Times:171:Times:Nevertheless, these firms have developed new organisational practices. Here we 
7:211:13409:16:15:92:516:530:171:Times:171:Times:can speak of a high-tech network organisatio n. Those were most of automobile 
7:212:13487:15:16:92:494:515:171:Times:171:Times:sector cases. But only 10% o f all companies have fully applied the network 
7:213:13563:16:16:92:512:499:171:Times:171:Times:model, having vertically and horizontally restructured their organisation model 
7:214:13643:16:15:92:467:483:171:Times:171:Times:together with the establishment of technical connections internally and 
7:215:13715:15:16:92:486:468:171:Times:171:Times:externally. The majority of the companies have only partly introduce d the 
7:216:13790:16:15:92:493:452:171:Times:171:Times:network model, they have established technological networks with external 
7:217:13864:15:16:92:508:437:171:Times:171:Times:partners and they have only partly restructured their business processes. 2/3 of 
7:218:13945:16:15:92:517:421:171:Times:171:Times:them have hierarchically de-integrated while the rest has introduces measures to 
7:219:14026:15:27:92:326:406:171:Times:171:Times:functionally integrate production processes. 
7:220:14070:27:16:92:504:379:171:Times:171:Times:The restructuring clusters also revealed significant differences concerning the 
7:221:14150:16:15:92:505:363:171:Times:171:Times:way how mode rn ICT is used. In this Sowing project survey finding it is clear 
7:222:14229:15:16:92:511:348:171:Times:171:Times:that, with a few exceptions, differences occur between the two Fordist types of 
7:223:14309:16:16:92:504:332:171:Times:171:Times:organisation on the one hand (the one that represents the companies that have 
7:224:14387:16:15:92:480:316:171:Times:171:Times:not taken steps to restructure their organisation form and use ICT only as 
7:225:14462:15:16:92:511:301:171:Times:171:Times:information processing tool – or the low-tech Fordist mod el, and the other that 
7:226:14542:16:15:92:496:285:171:Times:171:Times:represents the group of companies as technically oriented modernisers – the 
7:227:14617:15:16:92:501:270:171:Times:171:Times:“high-tech Fordism”) and the more flexible network forms on the other. This 
7:228:14692:16:15:92:493:254:171:Times:171:Times:holds true for the two tool functions (time and quality), for the organisation 
7:229:14771:15:16:92:518:239:171:Times:171:Times:function and for the information provider function. Not surprisingly control and 
7:230:14852:16:16:92:503:223:171:Times:171:Times:communication function are also important for the ICT based Fordism,  while 
7:231:14928:16:27:92:493:207:171:Times:171:Times:the surveillance function is most impo rtant for low-tech Fordist companies.

7:233:15004:26:30:92:424:154:171:Helvetica:171:Helvetica:Volkswagen (AutoEuropa) case – Palmela (Portugal) 
7:234:15053:30:16:92:487:124:171:Times:171:Times:This company was created in 1991 f rom a joint venture between Ford and 
7:235:15125:16:15:92:511:108:171:Times:171:Times:Volkwagen, and since it started its production (in early 1995) then had a larger 
7:236:15206:15:16:92:512:93:171:Times:171:Times:impact in the productive structure in Portugal, once it incorporates almost 50% 
7:237:15286:16:0:92:474:77:171:Times:171:Times:of national added value. It’s production volume is around 130 thousand  
8:238:15359:0:27:92:487:713:171:Times:171:Times:vehicles/year, which give an average of 32 vehicles produced per worker.  
8:239:15432:27:16:92:520:686:171:Times:171:Times:The case presented here is the AutoEuropa factory that assembles multi-propose 
8:240:15511:16:16:92:478:670:171:Times:171:Times:vehicles from Ford, VW and Se at (and is expected to start a new one for 
8:241:15584:16:15:92:518:654:171:Times:171:Times:Skoda). Although it was a Ford-VW joint venture, since 1999 , VW assumed the 
8:242:15661:15:15:92:496:639:171:Times:171:Times:control all over the company. Its implantation as a greenfield site originated 
8:243:15740:15:16:92:492:624:171:Times:171:Times:substantial changes in the way as firms relate themselves in a network [12], 
8:244:15816:16:16:92:518:608:171:Times:171:Times:although it didn’t produced a modern industrial district. In other words, it didn’t 
8:245:15900:16:15:92:518:592:171:Times:171:Times:create a true manufacturing “system” that stimulated externalities and synergies, 
8:246:15982:15:16:92:503:577:171:Times:171:Times:influencing all the local entrepreneurial fabric [5]. Nevertheless, it was a case 
8:247:16064:16:15:92:514:561:171:Times:171:Times:that assumed its functions on the qualification and training pro cess, articulating 
8:248:16148:15:16:92:516:546:171:Times:171:Times:also with the regional vocational training institutions. At the same time, it was a 
8:249:16232:16:15:92:512:530:171:Times:171:Times:case of significant investment on ICT for a single large factory, specially in the 
8:250:16315:15:27:92:349:515:171:Times:171:Times:field of manufacturing automation and robot ics. 
8:251:16363:27:16:92:484:488:171:Times:171:Times:When this is combined with short lead-times and minimum inventories of 
8:252:16434:16:16:92:492:472:171:Times:171:Times:incoming components, it  produces a system that is extremely dependent on 
8:253:16508:16:15:92:512:456:171:Times:171:Times:reliability in deliveries, especially in the last stage from the first-tier supplier to 
8:254:16596:15:16:92:465:441:171:Times:171:Times:the point-of-assembly. A high level of importance regarding logistical 
8:255:16667:16:15:92:510:425:171:Times:171:Times:relationships is associated with frequent deliveries and sequential Just-in-Time 
8:256:16748:15:27:92:182:410:171:Times:171:Times:production [11]. 
8:257:16764:27:16:92:487:383:171:Times:171:Times:As several authors mentions, one way t o overcome problems with product 
8:258:16836:16:15:92:495:367:171:Times:171:Times:quality or delivery is to organise the supply-linkages in such a way that new 
8:259:16914:15:16:92:480:352:171:Times:171:Times:products and production plans are developed in co-operation. In order to 
8:260:16987:16:15:92:459:336:171:Times:171:Times:benefit, the buyer needs to build a  collaborative relationship with the 
8:261:17060:15:16:92:462:321:171:Times:171:Times:subcontractor within a lean production strategy. This includes sharing 
8:262:17131:16:16:92:517:305:171:Times:171:Times:information and integrating the production process so that the new products can 
8:263:17211:16:15:92:474:289:171:Times:171:Times:be put into p roduction without delay. In fact, AutoEuropa developed an 
8:264:17283:15:16:92:518:274:171:Times:171:Times:information system with suppliers that enables this kind of strategy, once can be 
8:265:17365:16:15:92:503:258:171:Times:171:Times:considered as high-tech network organisation, with wide usage of ICT. These 
8:266:17441:15:16:92:467:243:171:Times:171:Times:applications are not only loca ted for administration, process control or 
8:267:17515:16:15:92:510:227:171:Times:171:Times:engineering activities, but are also disseminated at the shopfloor, characterised 
8:268:17597:15:16:92:517:212:171:Times:171:Times:by NC machine-tools, robotic cells, AGV, or automa tic wharehouses. This kind 
8:269:17675:16:16:92:511:196:171:Times:171:Times:of flexible manufacturing equipment is connected with quality control systems 
8:270:17753:16:26:92:497:180:171:Times:171:Times:and computer-aided planning that can be used by shopfloor working teams.  
8:271:17825:26:16:92:508:154:171:Times:171:Times:The establishment of strategic alliances is one commonly used  form of formal 
8:272:17903:16:15:92:519:138:171:Times:171:Times:inter-firm arrangement around a specific purpose or project [1, 5, 11]. The main 
8:273:17984:15:16:92:466:123:171:Times:171:Times:area for strategic alliances in the automotive industry is in Research & 
8:274:18057:16:16:92:517:107:171:Times:171:Times:Development where costs generally are extremely high and problematic for one 
8:275:18134:16:15:92:505:91:171:Times:171:Times:company to handle. This was one of the reasons for VW and Ford begin their 
8:276:18209:15:0:92:376:76:171:Times:171:Times:co-operation in the new multi-purpose class vehicles. 
9:277:18263:0:16:92:497:713:171:Times:171:Times:One further method of integration is to establish relationships with suppliers 
9:278:18342:16:16:92:461:697:171:Times:171:Times:with responsibility to develop entire modules. A module-supplier has 
9:279:18411:16:15:92:510:681:171:Times:171:Times:responsibility for product developm ent and co-ordination of  the assembly of a 
9:280:18491:15:16:92:472:666:171:Times:171:Times:number of components into a finished product, re ady to fit into the car. 
9:281:18565:16:15:92:480:650:171:Times:171:Times:Examples of this are complete seats with the correct colour and clothing;

9:283:18721:16:27:92:187:619:171:Times:171:Times:cockpit-modules. 
9:284:18737:27:15:92:516:592:171:Times:171:Times:The most striking outcome of the new supplier strategies based on modules and 
9:285:18815:15:16:92:518:577:171:Times:171:Times:sequential deliveries was the establishment of a supplier-park in close proximity 
9:286:18897:16:15:92:522:561:171:Times:171:Times:to the assembly plant in Palmela (near Setúbal). On this site the first tier supplier 
9:287:18983:15:16:92:486:546:171:Times:171:Times:units were located. These units are also international joint ventures among 
9:288:19059:16:15:92:504:530:171:Times:171:Times:national second tier suppliers and foreign firms. We could acknowledge clear 
9:289:19136:15:16:92:513:515:171:Times:171:Times:similarities between this type of organisation, and other type, as for example in 
9:290:19218:16:27:92:208:499:171:Times:171:Times:Volvo in Sweden [1]. 
9:291:19238:27:16:92:497:472:171:Times:171:Times:This shift in supplier practices opened up for the large international supplier 
9:292:19318:16:15:92:512:456:171:Times:171:Times:groups to develop links with national industries and esta blish themselves in the 
9:293:19400:15:16:92:495:441:171:Times:171:Times:supplier-park. The traditional suppliers did not have the capacity to become 
9:294:19477:16:15:92:508:425:171:Times:171:Times:responsible for entire modules, most of  them with technological complexities. 
9:295:19556:15:16:92:511:410:171:Times:171:Times:In this process, the Ford company (that was a member of the AutoEuropa joint 
9:296:19633:16:15:92:503:394:171:Times:171:Times:venture) was responsible for the certification of those supplier units. And this 
9:297:19714:15:16:92:490:379:171:Times:171:Times:certification process was not only agreed with the ISO 9000 p rinciples, but 
9:298:19791:16:15:92:490:363:171:Times:171:Times:included several other items related with work organisation principles. The 
9:299:19867:15:16:92:518:348:171:Times:171:Times:influence in the regional and national ind ustrial fabric related to this project was 
9:300:19953:16:16:92:508:332:171:Times:171:Times:very strong, once new organisational themes were discussed and introduced in 
9:301:20030:16:27:92:514:316:171:Times:171:Times:all those firms. The work group concept was a novelty for most of those firms.  
9:302:20109:27:15:92:479:289:171:Times:171:Times:Furthermore this Ford certification process  (Q-1 and Q10 1) worked as a 
9:303:20182:15:16:92:497:274:171:Times:171:Times:catalyst for new a supplier hierarchy with a small number of module/system 
9:304:20257:16:15:92:520:258:171:Times:171:Times:integrators at the top (first tier) that can react in 2 hours to the demand, followed 
9:305:20343:15:16:92:518:243:171:Times:171:Times:by many of the traditional suppliers established in national ma rket in the second 
9:306:20426:16:15:92:484:227:171:Times:171:Times:tier (nearby suppliers that respond within 1 day or 1,5 days). The first tier 
9:307:20504:15:16:92:496:212:171:Times:171:Times:represents firms that, for example, assemble the driving clusters, the seating 
9:308:20583:16:16:92:498:196:171:Times:171:Times:groups, or the complete wheel system, and are located very close to the VW 
9:309:20658:16:15:92:495:180:171:Times:171:Times:factory. The second one is more specialized on specific assembled products 
9:310:20733:15:15:92:509:165:171:Times:171:Times:(cabling systems, optics, sensors, driving wheels, transmissions). The third tier 
9:311:20815:15:16:92:475:150:171:Times:171:Times:(external suppliers) are normally the national and regional firms that are 
9:312:20890:16:16:92:496:134:171:Times:171:Times:specialised suppliers of international groups and  firms (tyres, glasses, motor 
9:313:20970:16:15:92:507:118:171:Times:171:Times:components, metal moulds for casting, plastic components, suspentions, etc.). 
9:314:21048:15:16:92:507:103:171:Times:171:Times:Most of them are traditional suppliers in the automotive chain, and have more 
9:315:21126:16:0:92:334:87:171:Times:171:Times:than 2 days to react to AutoEuropa demands. 
10:316:21170:0:16:92:461:713:171:Times:171:Times:The development of local supplying firms can be an indication of the 
10:317:21239:16:16:92:505:697:171:Times:171:Times:increasingly networked organisation where large international suppliers act as 
10:318:21318:16:15:92:509:681:171:Times:171:Times:integrators of resources rather than manufacturers of single products. What we 
10:319:21397:15:16:92:488:666:171:Times:171:Times:should loo k for is the location and distribution of resources in the network 
10:320:21475:16:15:92:466:650:171:Times:171:Times:belonging to each supplier. In the AutoEuropa case, we can include as 
10:321:21545:15:16:92:506:635:171:Times:171:Times:assembling integrators the Delphi, Continental tires, Visteon, Bosch, Sommer 
10:322:21622:16:15:92:509:619:171:Times:171:Times:Allibert, Vanpro, Gillet, Siemens, among other companies that are developing 
10:323:21699:15:16:92:507:604:171:Times:171:Times:joint-ventures with Portuguese firms. Using this point of departure we can say 
10:324:21778:16:16:92:515:588:171:Times:171:Times:that economies are created for the entire network, thus diminishing the need for 
10:325:21859:16:15:92:513:572:171:Times:171:Times:scale-economies at local plant level. This means that in spite AutoEuropa has 4 
10:326:21939:15:16:92:500:557:171:Times:171:Times:thousand direct workers at Palmela plant, the employment volum e of people 
10:327:22014:16:15:92:521:541:171:Times:171:Times:related with this Ford-VW product are around 9 tho usand in Portugal. It is rather 
10:328:22097:15:16:92:501:526:171:Times:171:Times:a question of where to locate resources such as manufacturing, developm ent, 
10:329:22174:16:27:92:330:510:171:Times:171:Times:management, sales, procurement and others. 
10:330:22216:27:15:92:505:483:171:Times:171:Times:The work organisation is based on group work concepts were the operators in 
10:331:22292:15:16:92:506:468:171:Times:171:Times:involved in job rotation schemes but not in job enrichement: the workers only 
10:332:22370:16:15:92:518:452:171:Times:171:Times:participate on quality control decisions. They don’t elect the team leaders, don’t 
10:333:22453:15:16:92:514:437:171:Times:171:Times:participate in the decision about division of tasks, or working times. The nature 
10:334:22535:16:27:92:472:421:171:Times:171:Times:of the working teams are inspired on the Toyota model of organisation. 
10:335:22605:27:15:92:501:394:171:Times:171:Times:The emphasis lays on the control issues, where the job autonomy is resticted. 
10:336:22683:15:16:92:514:379:171:Times:171:Times:The selection of members of working groups is done by the  sector responsibles 
10:337:22762:16:15:92:467:363:171:Times:171:Times:(supervisors and superintendents), although workers are encouraged to 
10:338:22832:15:16:92:485:348:171:Times:171:Times:contribute their ideas and suggestions to improve their jobs, following the 
10:339:22908:16:16:92:496:332:171:Times:171:Times:Japanese kaizen principles [3]. These continuous improvement activities are 
10:340:22984:16:15:92:490:316:171:Times:171:Times:task-centred, rather than power centred. That means that are oriented to the 
10:341:23061:15:27:92:444:301:171:Times:171:Times:operational level (task) more then to the decisional level (power).  
10:342:23129:27:16:92:516:274:171:Times:171:Times:The studies done here demonstrated that these kaizen activities represent a form 
10:343:23210:16:15:92:475:258:171:Times:171:Times:of involvement rather than an opportunity for participation, leading to a 
10:344:23284:15:16:92:520:243:171:Times:171:Times:simplification of procedures that can be transformed into norms and  regulations. 
10:345:23366:16:15:92:516:227:171:Times:171:Times:It seems that there is no clear shift from the taylorist form of work organisation, 
10:346:23450:15:27:92:507:212:171:Times:171:Times:although it includes steps forward into the process of involvement of workers.

11:355:23904:16:15:92:503:681:171:Times:171:Times:holdings were established. Daimler-Benz Aerospace was sub-divided into six

11:358:24131:15:16:92:492:635:171:Times:171:Times:Propulsion Systems). The business segment Services, represented by debis,

11:363:24484:15:27:92:257:557:171:Times:171:Times:as micro-electronics (TEMIC). 
11:364:24513:27:15:92:471:530:171:Times:171:Times:The corporation’s history is characterized by continuous and consistent 
11:365:24585:15:16:92:502:515:171:Times:171:Times:expansion. Every merger resulted in organizational changes within the newly-
11:366:24661:16:16:92:483:499:171:Times:171:Times:refounded company, which can be retraced for only the past decade. This 
11:367:24733:16:15:92:515:483:171:Times:171:Times:history, however, shows in a quite impressive manner that its specific corporate 
11:368:24814:15:16:92:503:468:171:Times:171:Times:logic and corporate culture had been laid down from the very be ginnings. By 
11:369:24891:16:15:92:484:452:171:Times:171:Times:means of its technical innovations, the company has, by making use of its 
11:370:24965:15:16:92:512:437:171:Times:171:Times:leader role, first opened and then formed the automotive market, and has been 
11:371:25043:16:15:92:471:421:171:Times:171:Times:able to maintain its market-leader position to the present. The intensive 
11:372:25117:15:16:92:497:406:171:Times:171:Times:scientific developm ent of automotive technology became in this manner the 
11:373:25192:16:16:92:513:390:171:Times:171:Times:motor and ba sis of its success on the markets. Continuous expansion, influence 
11:374:25272:16:15:92:480:374:171:Times:171:Times:in other branches of the economy,  as well as mergers with other business 
11:375:25346:15:16:92:499:359:171:Times:171:Times:enterprises gave impetus for permanent transformation of the entire Daimler-
11:376:25422:16:27:92:178:343:171:Times:171:Times:Chrysler group. 
11:377:25437:27:15:92:516:316:171:Times:171:Times:If one lets the concern’s history pass in review, the changes in the years 1997 to 
11:378:25520:15:16:92:519:301:171:Times:171:Times:1999 appear as a logical continuation of a market strategy which has committed 
11:379:25599:16:15:92:492:285:171:Times:171:Times:itself to growth as well as to market leadership. The concern has developed 
11:380:25675:15:27:92:381:270:171:Times:171:Times:itself steadily from a local to a global economic actor. 
11:381:25731:27:16:92:498:243:171:Times:171:Times:A turning point in the evolution of the company’s organizational culture can 
11:382:25808:16:15:92:494:227:171:Times:171:Times:nonetheless be made out. Daimler-Benz had be en active on the global level 
11:383:25883:15:16:92:491:212:171:Times:171:Times:much earlier than the merger with Chrysler, but exe cutive functions were – 
11:384:25958:16:16:92:508:196:171:Times:171:Times:culturally and organizationally – still strogly imbdded in regional and national 
11:385:26039:16:15:92:506:180:171:Times:171:Times:structures. This, however, seems to have come to an end with the merger with 
11:386:26116:15:15:92:510:165:171:Times:171:Times:Chrysler. There are signs for intensive orientation on a US-American model of 
11:387:26194:15:16:92:516:150:171:Times:171:Times:management (gradual cutback in conditions negotiated in collective bargaining, 
11:388:26273:16:16:92:521:134:171:Times:171:Times:reliable committments in favor of the jobs in the Stuttgart area only until the end 
11:389:26357:16:15:92:473:118:171:Times:171:Times:of the year 2000, even more comprehensive rationalization measures in 
11:390:26427:15:27:92:174:103:171:Times:171:Times:planning, etc.). 
11:391:26443:27:0:92:502:76:171:Times:171:Times:This group is active in quite different branches, in which ICT-application has 
12:392:26524:0:16:92:514:713:171:Times:171:Times:developed into the technical basis for work-processes (manufacturing, services, 
12:393:26604:16:16:92:486:697:171:Times:171:Times:administration and management). The fields of application for ICT have a 
12:394:26677:16:15:92:515:681:171:Times:171:Times:broad, multifunctional nature which in the course of time has decimated jobs in 
12:395:26757:15:16:92:504:666:171:Times:171:Times:the training occupations through rationalization, but has always reformed and 
12:396:26835:16:15:92:520:650:171:Times:171:Times:accelerated work. In retrospect, these changes make judgement of the relation of 
12:397:26916:15:16:92:499:635:171:Times:171:Times:cause and effect by the introduction of ICT quite difficult. In the case of this 
12:398:26997:16:15:92:515:619:171:Times:171:Times:company, one can nonetheless postulate a decision-based transformation which 
12:399:27074:15:16:92:506:604:171:Times:171:Times:– according to the ma ximization strategy of corporate logic – is constantly on 
12:400:27154:16:16:92:491:588:171:Times:171:Times:the search for means and methods of  increasing efficiency, respectively, of 
12:401:27231:16:26:92:333:572:171:Times:171:Times:quality assurance for products on the market. 
12:402:27276:26:16:92:513:546:171:Times:171:Times:In particular, the Daimler-Chrysler group’s role as a global player makes ICT a 
12:403:27356:16:15:92:506:530:171:Times:171:Times:decisive application-oriented instrument which enables the concern to give up 
12:404:27434:15:16:92:506:515:171:Times:171:Times:regional production sites, or to build up new ones. Standardization of the ICT-
12:405:27513:16:16:92:484:499:171:Times:171:Times:system is, further, intended to make it possible to interlace complex work-
12:406:27588:16:15:92:507:483:171:Times:171:Times:processes. These processes can then be accelerated and decentrally organized, 
12:407:27666:15:16:92:513:468:171:Times:171:Times:that is to say, fundamental conditions of time and space for work-processes are 
12:408:27746:16:15:92:453:452:171:Times:171:Times:being radically changed. Which concrete  effects this would have on 
12:409:27814:15:27:92:468:437:171:Times:171:Times:occupational profiles and on working co nditions can’t yet be foreseen. 
12:410:27885:27:16:92:503:410:171:Times:171:Times:Organizational changes were initiated as a result of the merger with Chrysler. 
12:411:27964:16:15:92:506:394:171:Times:171:Times:This is remarkable, because only a few years earlier, the internal structure had 
12:412:28045:15:16:92:511:379:171:Times:171:Times:already been reorganized into more decentralised forms of organization. In the 
12:413:28124:16:15:92:493:363:171:Times:171:Times:first phase of restructuring, levels of authority had been reduced, individual 
12:414:28203:15:16:92:510:348:171:Times:171:Times:divisions, commercial segments etc. granted more autonomy and empoweered 
12:415:28276:16:16:92:519:332:171:Times:171:Times:to make decisions, among other measures. After the merger in the past year, this 
12:416:28357:16:15:92:508:316:171:Times:171:Times:reform was rescinded in favor of centralized corporate leadership. This means 
12:417:28435:15:16:92:456:301:171:Times:171:Times:that levels of management were established which have assumed the 
12:418:28501:16:15:92:490:285:171:Times:171:Times:responsibility for an area in all concern segments worldwide. In this way, a 
12:419:28578:15:16:92:504:270:171:Times:171:Times:standardization of the styles of management as well as of the objectives takes 
12:420:28657:16:15:92:515:254:171:Times:171:Times:place. The specific, nationally or regionally diverse organizational principles of 
12:421:28740:15:27:92:372:239:171:Times:171:Times:the various segments lose importance in the process. 
12:422:28792:27:16:92:494:212:171:Times:171:Times:Working conditions for the individual e mployee changed in just the reverse 
12:423:28868:16:16:92:477:196:171:Times:171:Times:direction as described above, i. e., standardized or formal conditions are 
12:424:28943:16:15:92:492:180:171:Times:171:Times:transformed into individualized employment contracts. Time- and decision-
12:425:29016:15:15:92:512:165:171:Times:171:Times:making structures, tasks and goals, are increasingly being agreed upon and  laid 
12:426:29097:15:16:92:504:150:171:Times:171:Times:down in an individua l labor contract and are evaluated by various methods in 
12:427:29175:16:16:92:504:134:171:Times:171:Times:the course of the work. In this manner, career plans and performance patterns 
12:428:29253:16:15:92:465:118:171:Times:171:Times:develop, which differ from those of  the standard negotiated collective 
12:429:29325:15:16:92:491:103:171:Times:171:Times:agreements. The individual employee is put into the position of working to 
12:430:29400:16:15:92:479:87:171:Times:171:Times:one’s own account. Further, good work is rewarded by means of various 
12:431:29470:15:0:92:152:72:171:Times:171:Times:incentives. 
13:432:29483:0:16:92:508:713:171:Times:171:Times:On the whole, the individual’s decision-making competence has been reduced 
13:433:29558:16:16:92:475:697:171:Times:171:Times:by central management following the merger. By means of individually-
13:434:29627:16:15:92:513:681:171:Times:171:Times:negotiated performance requirements, however, the multipurpose  job prof ile is 
13:435:29707:15:16:92:510:666:171:Times:171:Times:gaining ground. This is brought a bout by means of various mechanisms: In the 
13:436:29785:16:15:92:514:650:171:Times:171:Times:first place, by periodic evaluation of performance, management tries to employ 
13:437:29864:15:16:92:495:635:171:Times:171:Times:labor as efficiently and as selectively as possible. Seco nd: the prevalence of 
13:438:29944:16:15:92:488:619:171:Times:171:Times:team- and project-work makes abilities such as social competence, foreign 
13:439:30018:15:16:92:510:604:171:Times:171:Times:languages and the like, necessary. And third, due to the general acceleration of 
13:440:30099:16:16:92:475:588:171:Times:171:Times:work-processes, so-called lifelong learning is becoming more  and more 
13:441:30170:16:15:92:484:572:171:Times:171:Times:important, and is being rated as a prerequisite for a successful career. The 
13:442:30247:15:16:92:515:557:171:Times:171:Times:individual is – much often than ever – subject to the mechanisms for evaluation 
13:443:30327:16:15:92:478:541:171:Times:171:Times:of his work. According to individual de mands on oneself , or on life, this 
13:444:30403:15:27:92:358:526:171:Times:171:Times:situation can be perceived as positive or negative. 
13:445:30454:27:16:92:518:499:171:Times:171:Times:ICT play a central role in these transformations, although it is not to be assumed 
13:446:30537:16:15:92:518:483:171:Times:171:Times:that they were the cause for these changes. Putting these decision-based reforms 
13:447:30618:15:16:92:512:468:171:Times:171:Times:into practice, however, would be inconceivable  without the technical basis ICT 
13:448:30698:16:15:92:520:452:171:Times:171:Times:provide. Especially in consequence of the spatial interlacing of the concern, ICT 
13:449:30780:15:27:92:262:437:171:Times:171:Times:have become indispensable [7]. 
13:450:30810:27:16:92:494:410:171:Times:171:Times:Formerly, working conditions in Germany had been organized according to 
13:451:30882:16:15:92:508:394:171:Times:171:Times:collective bargaining agreements. The employees profited by way of  dividend 
13:452:30958:15:16:92:495:379:171:Times:171:Times:payout procedures from the corporation’s material successes, and, as a rule, 
13:453:31035:16:15:92:512:363:171:Times:171:Times:identified themselves strongly with their workplace. The concern’s workers are 
13:454:31114:15:16:92:503:348:171:Times:171:Times:primarily men. Women are employed a bove all in administration, so that full-
13:455:31191:16:16:92:518:332:171:Times:171:Times:time employment is the normal time-structure (but part-time models can also be 
13:456:31270:16:27:92:158:316:171:Times:171:Times:negotiated). 
13:457:31282:27:15:92:500:289:171:Times:171:Times:Following the merger, a great deal of insecurity arose among the employees, 
13:458:31358:15:16:92:512:274:171:Times:171:Times:because the jobs at the main production site were guaranteed only until the end 
13:459:31438:16:15:92:497:258:171:Times:171:Times:of the year 2000. The f uture of the business segments in the Stuttgart area is 
13:460:31518:15:16:92:512:243:171:Times:171:Times:uncertain. Because the Daimler-Chrysler group is very strongly oriented on the 
13:461:31597:16:15:92:510:227:171:Times:171:Times:market, or rather, on the p rofit-margin, there is, on the whole, little confidence 
13:462:31681:15:16:92:518:212:171:Times:171:Times:in the executive floor’s committment to keep the jobs in the region if interesting 
13:463:31764:16:16:92:506:196:171:Times:171:Times:alternative offers are made. This insecurity has already led to conflicts among 
13:464:31844:16:26:92:175:180:171:Times:171:Times:the employees. 
13:465:31858:26:16:92:510:154:171:Times:171:Times:The orientation in the direction of a globally operating concern therefore leads 
13:466:31939:16:15:92:509:138:171:Times:171:Times:to a certain decoupling of the region, especially when corporate objectives are 
13:467:32019:15:16:92:479:123:171:Times:171:Times:formulated elsewhere (USA). The goal worldwide standardization of the 
13:468:32089:16:27:92:476:107:171:Times:171:Times:concern can turn into a threat to the further existence of individual sites.

14:471:32167:27:30:92:282:686:171:Helvetica:171:Helvetica:VCG/Volvo – Ghent (Belgium) 
14:472:32194:30:15:92:506:656:171:Times:171:Times:Belgium is a country of car manufacturers. Every year, more than one million 
14:473:32271:15:16:92:505:641:171:Times:171:Times:cars are constructed here by Ford (33.5%), O pel (31.6%), V olkswagen (19%) 
14:474:32347:16:16:92:519:625:171:Times:171:Times:and Volvo (16%). The Belgians assemble most cars in the world per head of the 
14:475:32425:16:15:92:488:609:171:Times:171:Times:population: in 1998 , 105 c ars were assembled for every 1 000 inhabitants, 
14:476:32500:15:16:92:516:594:171:Times:171:Times:which is more than the Japanese (87 cars) or the German (61 c ars) average. The 
14:477:32580:16:15:92:507:578:171:Times:171:Times:plant studied was established in 1965 as the first Volvo plant outside  Sweden. 
14:478:32659:15:16:92:493:563:171:Times:171:Times:VCG-Volvo Cars Ghe nt is the largest manufacturing unit of the Volvo Car 
14:479:32732:16:15:92:494:547:171:Times:171:Times:Corporation with 4 thousand direct workers, and mainly produces cars. The 
14:480:32806:15:16:92:511:532:171:Times:171:Times:activities related to sales, purchase, marketing, etc. belong to the responsibility 
14:481:32890:16:16:92:519:516:171:Times:171:Times:of the headquarters in Göteborg. This Ghent plant assembled in 1998 more than 
14:482:32968:16:26:92:194:500:171:Times:171:Times:150 thousand cars. 
14:483:32986:26:16:92:481:474:171:Times:171:Times:Price, productivity and quality have a lways been important competitivity 
14:484:33060:16:15:92:496:458:171:Times:171:Times:features. More recently, delivery periods have become an important field of 
14:485:33136:15:16:92:500:443:171:Times:171:Times:competition, plus the flexibility to allow for late changes in customer orders. 
14:486:33216:16:16:92:477:427:171:Times:171:Times:Flexibility and innovation also grew in importance in view of increasing 
14:487:33289:16:27:92:489:411:171:Times:171:Times:fluctuations in demand response the ever shortening of product life cycles. 
14:488:33364:27:15:92:512:384:171:Times:171:Times:The creation of a car is the result of three activities: welding, painting and final 
14:489:33449:15:16:92:505:369:171:Times:171:Times:assembly. These are also the three major business units of VCG, belonging to 
14:490:33526:16:15:92:494:353:171:Times:171:Times:the department ‘manufacturing’. The responsibilities of this department are 
14:491:33602:15:16:92:517:338:171:Times:171:Times:much broader than production sensu strictu and in fact, they are still increasing. 
14:492:33685:16:15:92:507:322:171:Times:171:Times:Over the years, almost all activities related to quality control and maintenance 
14:493:33766:15:16:92:519:307:171:Times:171:Times:have been integrated in the manufacturing department, which is also responsible 
14:494:33846:16:15:92:486:291:171:Times:171:Times:for its own logistics and material handling. The underlying reasons for the 
14:495:33922:15:16:92:517:276:171:Times:171:Times:ungoing incorporation of supporting activities in the manufacturing department, 
14:496:34002:16:16:92:517:260:171:Times:171:Times:is achieving a more efficient course of the production process, together with the 
14:497:34084:16:26:92:412:244:171:Times:171:Times:empowerment of the people involved (based on teamwork). 
14:498:34139:26:16:92:507:218:171:Times:171:Times:In general, the amount of supporting (staff) services and indirect employees is 
14:499:34219:16:16:92:512:202:171:Times:171:Times:rather small, given the size of the company. VCG  also has very little hierarchy 
14:500:34299:16:15:92:491:186:171:Times:171:Times:for a company of almost 4 000 employees. In fact, there are only 4 layers : 
14:501:34373:15:16:92:492:171:171:Times:171:Times:board of directors, core management, ‘area responsibles’ (e.g., white collar 
14:502:34449:16:15:92:465:155:171:Times:171:Times:employees responsible for first line supervision in a specific area) and 
14:503:34521:15:16:92:502:140:171:Times:171:Times:production teams (blue-collar core workers coached by a team leader, who is 
14:504:34597:16:15:92:472:124:171:Times:171:Times:also a blue collar worker). In the course of past 20 years, the amount of 
14:505:34671:15:16:92:482:109:171:Times:171:Times:hierarchical levels has been reduced drastically, together with the gradual 
14:506:34747:16:0:92:516:93:171:Times:171:Times:development of teamwork and the dismantling of huge supporting departments. 
15:507:34824:0:16:92:508:713:171:Times:171:Times:The cornerstone of VCG’s organisational logic, as already insinuated a couple 
15:508:34902:16:16:92:486:697:171:Times:171:Times:of times, is its well-elaborated teamwork. VCG really was – and still is - a 
15:509:34977:16:15:92:516:681:171:Times:171:Times:pioneer in the field of teamwork. The company already started working with its 
15:510:35056:15:16:92:508:666:171:Times:171:Times:VEC-teams (VEC stands for Volvo Europe Cars) somewhere in the beginning 
15:511:35128:16:26:92:161:650:171:Times:171:Times:of the 80ies. 
15:512:35141:26:16:92:518:624:171:Times:171:Times:A VEC-team consists of 10 to 15 members and a team leader, co-ordinating the 
15:513:35218:16:16:92:520:608:171:Times:171:Times:internal work organisation of the team. Within the teams, a flexible allocation of 
15:514:35301:16:15:92:511:592:171:Times:171:Times:workers is reached through job rotation. A comparative analysis of all Belgian 
15:515:35380:15:16:92:513:577:171:Times:171:Times:automobile companies showed that job rotation at VCG is most systematic and 
15:516:35456:16:15:92:496:561:171:Times:171:Times:extensive : all production workers are involved in rotatio n, rotation happens 
15:517:35534:15:16:92:489:546:171:Times:171:Times:over ca. 4 (sometimes up to 10) work places, rotation can happens every 2 
15:518:35608:16:15:92:494:530:171:Times:171:Times:hours, etc. In the other plants, rotation is much more limited and incidental. 
15:519:35687:15:16:92:505:515:171:Times:171:Times:Rotation between work places allows the job content to be enhanced; in other 
15:520:35764:16:16:92:504:499:171:Times:171:Times:words, it results into job enlargement. For employees, it has the advantage of 
15:521:35843:16:15:92:485:483:171:Times:171:Times:giving more variety, thereby reducing the routine & blunt character of the 
15:522:35918:15:16:92:470:468:171:Times:171:Times:machine-paced work. For the organisati on, the resulting polyvalence is 
15:523:35990:16:15:92:480:452:171:Times:171:Times:handsome tool for coping with unforeseen absentees or for redistributing 
15:524:36063:15:27:92:348:437:171:Times:171:Times:operations, e.g. after rebalancing of the line [4]. 
15:525:36114:27:16:92:471:410:171:Times:171:Times:However, VCG’s teamwork goes far beyond  simple job rotation. More 
15:526:36181:16:15:92:468:394:171:Times:171:Times:important is the gradual and still continuing evolution of incorporating 
15:527:36254:15:16:92:518:379:171:Times:171:Times:additional responsibilities within the production team. The underlying filosophy 
15:528:36335:16:15:92:489:363:171:Times:171:Times:is to make better use of the available capacities, in order to achieve a more 
15:529:36413:15:16:92:502:348:171:Times:171:Times:autonomous and efficient functioning of the team. Over the years, thinks like 
15:530:36491:16:16:92:478:332:171:Times:171:Times:first line maintenance, quality assurance, material supply, etc. have been 
15:531:36566:16:15:92:484:316:171:Times:171:Times:integrated in the VEC-teams, combined with a restructuring of the formal 
15:532:36639:15:16:92:508:301:171:Times:171:Times:organisation in order to achieve closer support from the strongly reduced staff 
15:533:36719:16:15:92:497:285:171:Times:171:Times:departments to the production teams. Usually, additional responsibilities for 
15:534:36797:15:16:92:506:270:171:Times:171:Times:teams are assigned to a specific function within the team or to the teamleader, 
15:535:36877:16:15:92:474:254:171:Times:171:Times:while the job content of the other members remains unaltered. At VCG, 
15:536:36947:15:16:92:521:239:171:Times:171:Times:however, additional responsibilities for the team must be interpreted as allocated 
15:537:37030:16:16:92:498:223:171:Times:171:Times:to all team members, since everybody rotates over a number of indirect jobs 
15:538:37106:16:15:92:497:207:171:Times:171:Times:within the team. Rotation means more than just ‘doing more  of the same’ or 
15:539:37182:15:16:92:508:192:171:Times:171:Times:simply job enlargement. Involvement in off-line activities supporting the team 
15:540:37261:16:26:92:343:176:171:Times:171:Times:functioning also implies a true job enrichment. 
15:541:37308:26:16:92:503:150:171:Times:171:Times:In line with this, VCG recently started another phase in the evolution towards 
15:542:37387:16:16:92:508:134:171:Times:171:Times:semi-autonomous teans, i.e. the phase of  self-manag ement. In this phase, each 
15:543:37467:16:15:92:509:118:171:Times:171:Times:of the team members have been given the ownership of a specialised theme or 
15:544:37543:15:16:92:462:103:171:Times:171:Times:topic, in correspondence with his own field of interest, capacities and 
15:545:37615:16:15:92:512:87:171:Times:171:Times:competencies. The themes can vary according to spec ific team needs, but good 
15:546:37693:15:0:92:493:72:171:Times:171:Times:examples are prevention of damages, safety and environment, follow-up of 
16:547:37768:0:16:92:513:713:171:Times:171:Times:product quality, prevention of breakdowns and short stops, etc. Every team has 
16:548:37846:16:16:92:502:697:171:Times:171:Times:been given 2u a day to engage in these so-called VEC-activities. Also here, a 
16:549:37924:16:15:92:511:681:171:Times:171:Times:rotation scheme is applied. Every day, someone else gets the opportunity to be 
16:550:38003:15:16:92:510:666:171:Times:171:Times:releaved from the conveyor belt and to do some  work on the topic he’s chosen 
16:551:38081:16:15:92:500:650:171:Times:171:Times:for. This allows to make better use of the available human capital, by simple 
16:552:38159:15:16:92:511:635:171:Times:171:Times:addressing and stirring up sometimes hidden qua lifications. In general, the self-
16:553:38241:16:15:92:500:619:171:Times:171:Times:management programme should increase the self-supporting character of the 
16:554:38315:15:27:92:518:604:171:Times:171:Times:team as well as the general quality level of the team and organisation tout court. 
16:555:38397:27:16:92:501:577:171:Times:171:Times:Every two weeks, the conveyor belt is shut down for a VEC-team meeting of 
16:556:38471:16:15:92:497:561:171:Times:171:Times:about 30 minutes (during the working hours). The purpose of the meeting is 
16:557:38546:15:16:92:510:546:171:Times:171:Times:discussing about problems, exchanging information, etc. Since the latest phase 
16:558:38625:16:15:92:490:530:171:Times:171:Times:of teamwork, the ‘theme-owners’ also use the meeting to inform the others 
16:559:38699:15:16:92:498:515:171:Times:171:Times:about activities and plans concerning their specific theme. Sometimes, cross-
16:560:38776:16:16:92:516:499:171:Times:171:Times:team meetings are organised between the owners of simular themes. Obviously, 
16:561:38853:16:15:92:471:483:171:Times:171:Times:the team-meetings cost the company a whole lot of money, but VCG is 
16:562:38921:15:27:92:226:468:171:Times:171:Times:convinced they pays off! 
16:563:38945:27:16:92:453:441:171:Times:171:Times:In general, teamwork was characterised by its gradual a nd stepwise 
16:564:39013:16:15:92:491:425:171:Times:171:Times:implementation. Evolving f rom very narrow Tayloristic jobs to richer jobs, 
16:565:39089:15:16:92:502:410:171:Times:171:Times:characterised by self-management in semi-autonomous teams, implies a long 
16:566:39163:16:15:92:487:394:171:Times:171:Times:learning p rocess that cannot be pushed top-down. Team members have to 
16:567:39234:15:16:92:502:379:171:Times:171:Times:receive off-the-job training to enable them to jump to a subsequent stage and 
16:568:39312:16:15:92:509:363:171:Times:171:Times:take on additional respo nsibilities. However, the time provided to reach a next 
16:569:39393:15:16:92:518:348:171:Times:171:Times:step is only loosely defined, allowing for differences between teams. In fact, the 
16:570:39476:16:16:92:494:332:171:Times:171:Times:team evaluates each step on a weekly basis. When a team feels confident in 
16:571:39551:16:15:92:508:316:171:Times:171:Times:mastering more additional responsibilities, a screening committee is invited to 
16:572:39631:15:16:92:492:301:171:Times:171:Times:repeat the evaluation. If approved, the team is awarded a green circle on its 
16:573:39709:16:27:92:399:285:171:Times:171:Times:VEC team board, and may move on to a subsequent step. 
16:574:39762:27:15:92:510:258:171:Times:171:Times:In general, it’s rather difficult to categorize the organisational logic of VCG or 
16:575:39845:15:16:92:512:243:171:Times:171:Times:to put the plant in a pre-defined cell. In fact, complete studies and articles have 
16:576:39929:16:15:92:519:227:171:Times:171:Times:been devoted  to this single topic and, in fact, this argumentation is largely based 
16:577:40014:15:16:92:507:212:171:Times:171:Times:on a study published by Gerpisa [8]. On the one hand, the prod uction logic of 
16:578:40092:16:16:92:496:196:171:Times:171:Times:VCG still shows some characteristics of Fordism, such as its traditional belt-
16:579:40170:16:15:92:507:180:171:Times:171:Times:driven assembly line and production jobs containing mainly short-cycle tasks. 
16:580:40248:15:15:92:501:165:171:Times:171:Times:One the other hand, one has to bear in mind the very well implemented team 
16:581:40323:15:16:92:490:150:171:Times:171:Times:concept supported by intensive rotation-schemes. This rotation includes an 
16:582:40398:16:16:92:504:134:171:Times:171:Times:unsually broad  range of heterogeneous, also off-line, jobs. This integration of 
16:583:40479:16:15:92:478:118:171:Times:171:Times:different jobs within production functio ns was made possible through an 
16:584:40552:15:16:92:510:103:171:Times:171:Times:impressive shift from staff departments towards lower levels of the production 
16:585:40631:16:15:92:478:87:171:Times:171:Times:hierarchy. Finally, the team’s ability to determine the speed of their own 
16:586:40706:15:0:92:238:72:171:Times:171:Times:trajectory must be stressed. 
17:587:40736:0:16:92:519:713:171:Times:171:Times:All these characteristics of the VEC team model cannot be labelled as Fordist or 
17:588:40817:16:16:92:483:697:171:Times:171:Times:machine bureaucratic at all. Support and preparation on the one ha nd and 
17:589:40891:16:15:92:517:681:171:Times:171:Times:execution on the other ha nd, are brought closely together. By reducing this kind 
17:590:40973:15:16:92:486:666:171:Times:171:Times:of division of labour, supporting tasks can be performed in the immediate 
17:591:41047:16:15:92:508:650:171:Times:171:Times:proximity of the line. The elimination of barriers between departments as well 
17:592:41126:15:16:92:493:635:171:Times:171:Times:as between production workers in order to allow a flexible allocation of the 
17:593:41203:16:15:92:510:619:171:Times:171:Times:workforce are features of a lean production approach. The attempt by VCG to 
17:594:41279:15:16:92:493:604:171:Times:171:Times:mobilise all production workers in off-line activities supporting the general 
17:595:41357:16:16:92:505:588:171:Times:171:Times:functioning and autonomy o f the team, even goes beyond the le an production 
17:596:41434:16:15:92:488:572:171:Times:171:Times:practices. At the same time, is still far away from the innova tions breaking 
17:597:41512:15:16:92:517:557:171:Times:171:Times:completely with the assembly line and choosing for teams assembling complete 
17:598:41589:16:15:92:499:541:171:Times:171:Times:cars rather then small parts of it (cf. experiments of Volvo-Udevalla or Saab-
17:599:41667:15:16:92:496:526:171:Times:171:Times:Kalmar). Because VCG is going further then the (Japanese) lean production 
17:600:41741:16:15:92:496:510:171:Times:171:Times:processes, but not so far as the (Swedish) experiments characterised by long 
17:601:41818:15:27:92:449:495:171:Times:171:Times:work cycles, Huys and Van Hoo tegem [8] talk about ‘a third way’. 
17:602:41883:27:16:92:490:468:171:Times:171:Times:We can say VCG combines some features typical for mass production in a 
17:603:41954:16:15:92:499:452:171:Times:171:Times:machine bureaucratic environment (e.g. conveyor belt with machine-paced, 
17:604:42027:15:16:92:493:437:171:Times:171:Times:short-cyclical work) with modern organisation and management principles, 
17:605:42100:16:15:92:513:421:171:Times:171:Times:more fitting the J-model or, to a lesser extend, even the operational a dhocracy 
17:606:42180:15:16:92:508:406:171:Times:171:Times:(e.g. job enrichment in autonomous teams, self-management). Putting VCG in 
17:607:42255:16:16:92:513:390:171:Times:171:Times:one of these cells would be a static solution denying the dynamics of reality. In 
17:608:42337:16:15:92:510:374:171:Times:171:Times:fact, VCG is already working for ca. 20 years on reducing vertical integration 
17:609:42416:15:16:92:480:359:171:Times:171:Times:(bringing execution and decision-making closer together) and increasing 
17:610:42488:16:15:92:502:343:171:Times:171:Times:horizontal integration (by means of semi-autonomous teams). In general, we 
17:611:42563:15:16:92:478:328:171:Times:171:Times:could say VCG is ‘under way’, trying to move a way from the traditional 
17:612:42635:16:15:92:504:312:171:Times:171:Times:Tayloristic approach towards more progressive and human solutions. In some 
17:613:42710:15:16:92:483:297:171:Times:171:Times:fields, more progress is made then in others, and the different parts of the 
17:614:42787:16:27:92:386:281:171:Times:159:Times:organisation can be in different stages of development. 
17:615:42842:27:27:92:95:254:171:Times:171:Times: 
17:616:42842:27:30:92:308:227:171:Helvetica:171:Helvetica:Three cases under three models? 
17:617:42873:30:15:92:495:197:171:Times:171:Times:All the cases mentioned here can be included in some of the most advanced 
17:618:42947:15:16:92:503:182:171:Times:171:Times:models of the organisation of automobile industry in Europe. All of them are 
17:619:43024:16:16:92:520:166:171:Times:171:Times:developing intra- and inter-organisational network forms. But they are reflecting 
17:620:43106:16:15:92:513:150:171:Times:171:Times:also the differencies that are more and more evident in the automobile industry 
17:621:43186:15:27:92:151:135:171:Times:171:Times:in Europe. 
17:622:43196:27:15:92:461:108:171:Times:171:Times:As Boyer and Freyssenet mentioned, two new industrial models were 
17:623:43262:15:16:92:481:93:171:Times:171:Times:simultaneously being developed in the Japanese automob ile industry: the 
17:624:43335:16:0:92:512:77:171:Times:171:Times:Toyotan model privileging “permanent reduction of costs at constant volume”, 
18:625:43414:0:16:92:485:713:171:Times:171:Times:and the Hondian  model implementing a totally different profit strategy of 
18:626:43489:16:16:92:495:697:171:Times:171:Times:“innovation and flexibility” [2]. These two models were erroneously placed 
18:627:43564:16:15:92:489:681:171:Times:171:Times:under the same heading of lean prod uction despite the fact that they differ 
18:628:43641:15:27:92:268:666:171:Times:171:Times:significantly on essential points.  
18:629:43676:27:15:92:482:639:171:Times:171:Times:The remarkable performances of the firms which embodied these models 
18:630:43745:15:16:92:483:624:171:Times:171:Times:(Toyotan and Hondian) did not chase however the Sloanian model away, 
18:631:43814:16:16:92:505:608:171:Times:171:Times:Volkswagen adopted it as of 1974, and was able to exploit it profitably in the 
18:632:43893:16:15:92:516:592:171:Times:171:Times:context of a renewed market. These three firms Toyota, H onda, and Volswagen 
18:633:43970:15:16:92:513:577:171:Times:171:Times:were in fact the only ones to have a “break-even point” that was constantly and 
18:634:44050:16:15:92:467:561:171:Times:171:Times:significantly above their value added, whereas all other carmakers had 
18:635:44121:15:27:92:310:546:171:Times:171:Times:experienced periods of non-profitability. 
18:636:44162:27:16:92:505:519:171:Times:171:Times:For these mentioned authors, Volkswagen followed a profit strategy based on 
18:637:44238:16:15:92:491:503:171:Times:171:Times:volume and diversity thanks to internationalization, the buying out of other 
18:638:44315:15:16:92:481:488:171:Times:171:Times:carmakers and the commonalization of car models platforms (the case of 
18:639:44386:16:16:92:505:472:171:Times:171:Times:AutoEuropa is very clear on this issue). The modularisation strategy is not yet 
18:640:44466:16:15:92:471:456:171:Times:171:Times:implemented in all types of products, and can be an evidence when the 
18:641:44536:15:27:92:218:441:171:Times:171:Times:platforms are identical. 
18:642:44560:27:16:92:516:414:171:Times:171:Times:In fact, some authors, as Michel Freyssenet recently mentioned [6] saw the “new 
18:643:44640:16:15:92:509:398:171:Times:171:Times:productive model” as nothing more than a variant of the old Fordist model. But, 
18:644:44720:15:16:92:508:383:171:Times:171:Times:for others they considered that there had always been a plurality of models, and 
18:645:44801:16:15:92:513:367:171:Times:171:Times:even others contested the very idea that there is such a thing as a model. Finally, 
18:646:44885:15:16:92:501:352:171:Times:171:Times:we can find those who agreed with the idea of “lean production”, but who felt 
18:647:44963:16:27:92:421:336:171:Times:171:Times:that its variants were based on specific national environments.  
18:648:45027:27:15:92:511:309:171:Times:171:Times:The success or failure of firms' internationalisation drives, continues Freyssenet, 
18:649:45111:15:16:92:494:294:171:Times:171:Times:depends on the compatibility between their model and the market and labour 
18:650:45186:16:15:92:519:278:171:Times:171:Times:conditions in the various spaces they were moving into. It seems to be the case of 
18:651:45269:15:27:92:339:263:171:Times:171:Times:these firms in Germany, Belgium and Portugal. 
18:652:45314:27:16:92:520:236:171:Times:171:Times:All of the cases mentioned in this article are located in different national contexts, 
18:653:45401:16:15:92:506:220:171:Times:171:Times:but all of them are using intensivelly ICT from the shopfloor level to the design 
18:654:45483:15:16:92:493:205:171:Times:171:Times:areas, and all of them are specialised in medium-high range car models, with 
18:655:45560:16:15:92:494:189:171:Times:171:Times:increased technological practices based on quality control, intensive flows of 
18:656:45639:15:27:92:445:174:171:Times:171:Times:information and communication, and leading networks of suppliers. 
18:657:45704:27:16:92:504:147:171:Times:171:Times:So, for the German case of Daimler-Benz we can conclude that it inscribes in 
18:658:45781:16:15:92:501:131:171:Times:171:Times:the new “sloanian farmework”. This model (named after Alfred Sloan, under 
18:659:45855:15:16:92:514:116:171:Times:171:Times:whose presidency this model was theorized and constructed at General Motors) 
18:660:45932:16:16:92:508:100:171:Times:171:Times:is the model that implemented the "volume and diversity" strategy. It relies on 
18:661:46012:16:0:92:476:84:171:Times:171:Times:an "enterprise government compromise" essentially established between 
19:662:46084:0:16:92:517:713:171:Times:171:Times:managers and one or several p owerful and professionalized unions. It thus takes 
19:663:46165:16:16:92:506:697:171:Times:171:Times:on the form of a social compromise wherein accepting work organization and 
19:664:46240:16:15:92:493:681:171:Times:171:Times:promoting social peace is compensated by progra mmed growth in worker's 
19:665:46312:15:16:92:505:666:171:Times:171:Times:buying power, prom otions in the workplace, and the expansion of both social 
19:666:46389:16:26:92:245:650:171:Times:171:Times:protection and union rights.  
19:667:46418:26:16:92:492:624:171:Times:171:Times:The Sloanian product policy is multi-brand, offering parallel ranges whose 
19:668:46493:16:16:92:483:608:171:Times:171:Times:models of same market segment share the same platform while offering a 
19:669:46564:16:15:92:517:592:171:Times:171:Times:number of versions and options. Productive  organization is characterized by the 
19:670:46645:15:16:92:444:577:171:Times:171:Times:centralization of strategic choices and the decentralization of their 
19:671:46715:16:15:92:509:561:171:Times:171:Times:implementation within divisions; relying on subsidiaries or sub-contractors for 
19:672:46795:15:16:92:481:546:171:Times:171:Times:numerous components so as to displace a part of diversity to them a nd to 
19:673:46869:16:15:92:510:530:171:Times:171:Times:benefit lower prices due to their economies of scale obtained thanks the orders 
19:674:46949:15:16:92:497:515:171:Times:171:Times:from other clients; machine polyvalence (multi-specialized) and mechanical 
19:675:47024:16:16:92:484:499:171:Times:171:Times:assembly lines with buffers to saturate the production tool despite vehicle 
19:676:47100:16:15:92:511:483:171:Times:171:Times:variety. The employment relationships under this technological practice model 
19:677:47178:15:16:92:510:468:171:Times:171:Times:consist of applying the "enterprise government compromise" under the union's 
19:678:47255:16:15:92:466:452:171:Times:171:Times:control, and in the name of polyvalent workers paid in function of job 
19:679:47326:15:27:92:364:437:171:Times:171:Times:evaluation of work stations they successively have. 
19:680:47377:27:16:92:521:410:171:Times:171:Times:Since the 1960s, no  firm having adopted the "quality" strategy in Europe (as, for 
19:681:47460:16:15:92:496:394:171:Times:171:Times:example, BMW, Mercedes, Saab or Vo lvo) experienced a break-even point 
19:682:47531:15:16:92:508:379:171:Times:171:Times:constantly above added value. Though their profit strategy was pertinent, their 
19:683:47611:16:15:92:503:363:171:Times:171:Times:"enterprise government com promise" was not sufficiently robust. Although it 
19:684:47688:15:16:92:496:348:171:Times:171:Times:was a socially favorable environment, these firms could control the supplier 
19:685:47765:16:16:92:508:332:171:Times:171:Times:costs. They attempted to apply "socio-technical" approach to the labour crisis. 
19:686:47845:16:27:92:483:316:171:Times:171:Times:One of the most well-knowned case, was the Volvo, spec ially in Sweden. 
19:687:47916:27:15:92:509:289:171:Times:171:Times:These experiences considerably enlarged the cycle times, introducing modular 
19:688:47993:15:16:92:475:274:171:Times:171:Times:work, and systematically improved the work station ergonomic s and the 
19:689:48064:16:15:92:498:258:171:Times:171:Times:working conditions. In addition, the image of quality could be reinforced by 
19:690:48141:15:16:92:485:243:171:Times:171:Times:publicity concerning new production methods. The y were presented more 
19:691:48212:16:15:92:518:227:171:Times:171:Times:dignified than the “mass production” methods for the demanding customer who 
19:692:48288:15:16:92:512:212:171:Times:171:Times:wanted a car to become the object of special attention. Vo lvo went the furthest 
19:693:48369:16:16:92:505:196:171:Times:171:Times:along the path of "work reform" by radically splitting from the assembly line, 
19:694:48448:16:15:92:475:180:171:Times:171:Times:replacing it with assembling in fixed parallel stations, notably in its new 
19:695:48524:15:15:92:510:165:171:Times:171:Times:Uddevalla plant. But both at Volvo and other firms, employment relationships 
19:696:48601:15:16:92:490:150:171:Times:171:Times:and product policy were not coherently conceived of in relation to the new 
19:697:48676:16:16:92:521:134:171:Times:171:Times:productive organization so as to generate as much benefit as possible in terms of  
19:698:48759:16:15:92:484:118:171:Times:171:Times:personalization of response to demand (be it in the realm of delays, costs, 
19:699:48835:15:27:92:365:103:171:Times:171:Times:product improvement and adaptation, and service). 
19:700:48884:27:0:92:494:76:171:Times:171:Times:The Daimler-Chrysler merger, increasingly seen as the former acquiring the 
20:701:48961:0:16:92:511:713:171:Times:171:Times:latter, and its relation with Mitsubishi compromised the productive structure to 
20:702:49042:16:16:92:505:697:171:Times:171:Times:become a worldwide firm to be present within all segments of the automobile 
20:703:49118:16:15:92:494:681:171:Times:171:Times:market: top-of-the-line in each segment, the first market (mass oriented and 
20:704:49195:15:16:92:508:666:171:Times:171:Times:hierarchized), the second market (innovative varied and variable models). The 
20:705:49273:16:15:92:502:650:171:Times:171:Times:objective was to respond to all kinds of demands, also explains the succesive 
20:706:49351:15:16:92:483:635:171:Times:171:Times:takeovers of Jaguar, Aston Martin and Volvo by Ford, and its propo sal to 
20:707:49425:16:15:92:492:619:171:Times:171:Times:purchase Land Rover.  Volkswagen itself implemented a strict "volume and 
20:708:49498:15:16:92:490:604:171:Times:171:Times:diversity" strategy which commonalized the platforms of its four brands of 
20:709:49573:16:16:92:511:588:171:Times:171:Times:classic sedans, and now want to make them all: MPV of VW, Ford and SEAT, 
20:710:49646:16:15:92:499:572:171:Times:171:Times:luxurious cars with Bentley, Lamborghini and Buga tti, recreational vehicles, 
20:711:49724:15:27:92:230:557:171:Times:171:Times:heavy trucks with Scania. 
20:712:49749:27:15:92:491:530:171:Times:171:Times:If the coexistence of two markets should persist, differentiating themselves 
20:713:49826:15:16:92:502:515:171:Times:171:Times:according to the world's regions or even by country, it  is possible that certain 
20:714:49908:16:16:92:509:499:171:Times:171:Times:firms will attempt and succeed in rendering volume, diversity, innovation, and 
20:715:49987:16:15:92:492:483:171:Times:171:Times:flexibility compatible. One can acknowledge other ex periences, as General 
20:716:50062:15:27:92:493:468:171:Times:171:Times:Motors rendered volume and diversity compatible in the 1920s and 1930 s.  
20:717:50135:27:16:92:507:441:171:Times:171:Times:To achieve this aim, General Motors was required to invent a new automobile 
20:718:50211:16:15:92:492:425:171:Times:171:Times:architecture, with commonalized platforms and car models differing on the 
20:719:50285:15:16:92:518:410:171:Times:171:Times:“surface”, and the construction of new socio-productive principles: polyvalency 
20:720:50365:16:15:92:497:394:171:Times:171:Times:and supplying. This means a completely new technological practice, that we 
20:721:50440:15:16:92:505:379:171:Times:171:Times:could characterise as organisationally oriented moderniser, where ICT are not 
20:722:50518:16:27:92:249:363:171:Times:171:Times:determinant for their change. 
20:723:50547:27:15:92:493:336:171:Times:171:Times:So if modular vehicles are more than just a way of outsourcing a maximum 
20:724:50620:15:16:92:496:321:171:Times:171:Times:quantity of work, this means that a new network organisation can take place 
20:725:50696:16:16:92:512:305:171:Times:171:Times:more intensivelly in this automobile sector. The possibility to be able to design 
20:726:50778:16:15:92:494:289:171:Times:171:Times:innovative models thanks to different combinations of shared elements, is a 
20:727:50854:15:16:92:502:274:171:Times:171:Times:completely different issue. As we can see from these cases, only the Daimler-
20:728:50931:16:15:92:494:258:171:Times:171:Times:Chrysler can perform this activity, once, neither AutoEuropa, nor VCG, a re 
20:729:51007:15:16:92:507:243:171:Times:171:Times:firms with decision on the design of new models. They depend, about that, o n 
20:730:51085:16:27:92:350:227:171:Times:171:Times:the owners (VW and Volvo) located elsewhere.  
20:731:51130:27:15:92:485:200:171:Times:171:Times:The reflexive produ ction, with appropriate employment relationships, is a 
20:732:51205:15:16:92:489:185:171:Times:171:Times:characteristic of the “high-tech network organisations” that developed new 
20:733:51280:16:15:92:478:169:171:Times:171:Times:forms of work organisation together with networking relations with their 
20:734:51353:15:16:92:519:154:171:Times:171:Times:suppliers, using intensivelly ICT. But this technological practice can be found in 
20:735:51436:16:15:92:479:138:171:Times:171:Times:all the three case, although we can find them very different. When one is 
20:736:51510:15:16:92:475:123:171:Times:171:Times:presented as a multidimensional group that influenced the re-structuring 
20:737:51583:16:16:92:493:107:171:Times:171:Times:strategy, with a new worldwide focus (Daimler-Chrysler), others depend on 
20:738:51657:16:15:92:514:91:171:Times:171:Times:their mother-firms. And these, one follows the organisational advantages of the 
20:739:51737:15:0:92:507:76:171:Times:171:Times:Swedish socio-technical approach to re-structuring, assuming most of the lean 
21:740:51817:0:16:92:515:713:171:Times:171:Times:production processes, and the other, dependent from the VW global strategy, is 
21:741:51896:16:16:92:502:697:171:Times:171:Times:implementing the Japanese strategies of organisational change, to d evelop an 
21:742:51974:16:15:92:507:681:171:Times:171:Times:increased workers involvement in the control process. But these firms has few 
21:743:52052:15:16:92:518:666:171:Times:171:Times:autonomy, although the central offices of Mercedes are located in Stuttgard, but 
21:744:52133:16:26:92:380:650:171:Times:171:Times:management objectives are designed in United States. 
21:745:52185:26:16:92:510:624:171:Times:171:Times:So, in fact, the technological practice cannot be understood as a single pattern, 
21:746:52267:16:16:92:508:608:171:Times:171:Times:even when we can find strong similarities, achieved from the same sector, and 
21:747:52345:16:15:92:497:592:171:Times:171:Times:with the same kind of product. O n the contrary, there are strong differencies 
21:748:52424:15:16:92:520:577:171:Times:171:Times:based on the local ways of organising the industrial structure, that are developed 
21:749:52507:16:27:92:490:561:171:Times:171:Times:under different cultures, and specially, under different corporate strategies.

21:754:52595:26:16:92:480:451:171:Times:171:Times:The research focus of the Sowing project was on the analysis on how the 
21:755:52667:16:15:92:514:435:171:Times:171:Times:emerging technological practices within companies were influenced by the ICT 
21:756:52744:15:16:92:512:420:171:Times:171:Times:and how these technologies have been supported by the institutions of regional 
21:757:52823:16:16:92:519:404:171:Times:171:Times:and national environments. In this article we tryed to underline evidencies of the 
21:758:52904:16:15:92:514:388:171:Times:171:Times:importance and different alternatives in terms of technological practices for the 
21:759:52986:15:16:92:464:373:171:Times:171:Times:automobile sector. And we could find that even with the same type of 
21:760:53055:16:15:92:516:357:171:Times:171:Times:technology, one  can identify different models, different cultures, different ways 
21:761:53138:15:16:92:513:342:171:Times:171:Times:of organising the industrial structure (firms, regional institutions, R&D centres) 
21:762:53221:16:15:92:490:326:171:Times:171:Times:in the same industry. Technological practise cannot be regarded as a single 
21:763:53297:15:16:92:471:311:171:Times:171:Times:pattern, which takes part in the global production process. The cases of 
21:764:53370:16:16:92:466:295:171:Times:171:Times:Daimler-Chrysler in Germany, Volvo in Belgium and VW in Portuga l 
21:765:53436:16:27:92:179:279:171:Times:171:Times:demonstrates it. 
21:766:53452:27:15:92:510:252:171:Times:171:Times:These companies seemed to orient their restructuring strategies on the network 
21:767:53531:15:15:92:515:237:171:Times:171:Times:organisation, together with the massive introduction of modern ICT. They have 
21:768:53609:15:16:92:516:222:171:Times:171:Times:fully applied the network model, having vertically and horizontally restructured 
21:769:53690:16:16:92:458:206:171:Times:171:Times:their organisation model together with the establishment of technical 
21:770:53760:16:13:92:294:190:171:Times:171:Times:connections internally and externally. 
21:771:53798:13:15:92:95:177:127:Times:127:Times: 
21:772:53798:15:16:92:473:162:127:Times:171:Times:In fact, all the cases mentioned here can be included in some of the most 
21:773:53872:16:16:92:520:146:171:Times:171:Times:advanced models of the organisation of automobi le industry in Europe. But they 
21:774:53952:16:15:92:476:130:171:Times:171:Times:are reflecting also the differencies that are more and more evident in the 
21:775:54027:15:16:92:517:115:171:Times:171:Times:automobile industry in Europe. Volkswagen followed a profit strategy based on 
21:776:54105:16:15:92:519:99:171:Times:171:Times:volume and diversity thanks to internationalization, and the commonalization of 
21:777:54185:15:0:92:476:84:171:Times:171:Times:car models platforms (AutoEuropa as an example). The German case of 
22:778:54255:0:16:92:513:713:171:Times:171:Times:Daimler-Benz inscribes in the new “sloanian farmework” that implemented the 
22:779:54331:16:16:92:504:697:171:Times:171:Times:"volume and diversity" strategy. It is a strategy for an "enterprise government 
22:780:54410:16:15:92:511:681:171:Times:171:Times:comprom ise" that takes on the form of a social compromise wherein accepting 
22:781:54487:15:16:92:513:666:171:Times:171:Times:work organization and promo ting social peace is compensated by programmed 
22:782:54562:16:15:92:503:650:171:Times:171:Times:growth of social structure in a globalised framework. Volvo went the furthest 
22:783:54640:15:16:92:455:635:171:Times:171:Times:along the path of "work reform". But both at Volvo and other firms, 
22:784:54708:16:15:92:515:619:171:Times:171:Times:employment rela tionships and product policy were not coherently conceived of 
22:785:54786:15:16:92:517:604:171:Times:171:Times:in relation to the new productive organization. The example of factories outside 
22:786:54867:16:14:92:267:588:171:Times:171:Times:Sweden can be an example of it. 
22:787:54898:14:15:92:95:574:127:Times:127:Times: 
22:788:54898:15:15:92:505:559:171:Times:171:Times:So, the structure of division of labour in each of the studied firms remains the 
22:789:54979:15:16:92:502:544:171:Times:171:Times:most important indicator to acknowledge the possibilities for participation of 
22:790:55058:16:16:92:494:528:171:Times:171:Times:workers and design of workplaces. And the empirical results seems to show 
22:791:55132:16:15:92:505:512:171:Times:171:Times:these limits for participation that are performed by the dif ferent technological 
22:792:55214:15:16:92:515:497:171:Times:171:Times:practices based on different cultures, different ways of organising the industrial 
22:793:55296:16:0:92:353:481:171:Times:171:Times:structure (at a local, regional and national levels).
