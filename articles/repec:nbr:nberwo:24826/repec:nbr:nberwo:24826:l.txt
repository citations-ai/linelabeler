2:31:1675:28:14:71:545:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:Housing  discrimination  is  illegal.  However,  paired-tester  audit  experiments  have  revealed 
2:32:1774:14:14:71:545:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:evidence of  discrimination  in  the  interactions  between  potential  buyers  and  real  estate  agents, 
2:33:1880:14:14:71:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:raising  concern about  whether  certain  groups  are  systematically  excluded  from  the  beneficial 
2:34:1982:14:14:72:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:effects  of  healthy  neighborhoods. Using  data  from  HUD’s  most  recent  Housing  Discrimination 
2:35:2082:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:Study  and  micro-level  data  on  key  attributes of  neighborhoods  in  28  US  cities,  we  find  strong 
2:36:2189:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:evidence of discrimination in the characteristics of neighborhoods towards which individuals are 
2:37:2285:14:14:72:546:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:steered. Conditional upon the characteristics of the house suggested by the audit tester, minorities 
2:38:2385:14:14:72:546:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:are significantly more likely to be steered towards neighborhoods with less economic opportunity 
2:39:2481:14:14:72:546:476:12:Times:12:Times:F:and  greater  exposures  to  crime  and  local  pollutants.  We  find  that  holding locational  preferences 
2:40:2589:14:14:72:546:462:12:Times:12:Times:F:or   income   constant,   discriminatory   steering   alone   can   contribute   substantially to   the 
2:41:2692:14:14:72:545:448:12:Times:12:g_d0_f1:F:disproportionate  number  of  minority  households  found  in  high  poverty  neighborhoods  in  the 
2:42:2792:14:14:72:546:434:12:Times:12:Times:F:United  States.  The  steering  effect  is  also  large  enough  to  fully  explain  the  differential  in 
2:43:2899:14:14:72:546:420:12:Times:12:Times:F:proximity to  Superfund  sites  among  African  American  mothers.  These  results  have  important 
2:44:2998:14:14:72:545:406:12:Times:12:Times:F:implications   for studies   of   “neighborhood   effects”   and   confirm   an   important   mechanism 
2:45:3101:14:14:72:546:392:12:Times:12:Times:F:underlying  observed  correlations between  race  and  pollution  in  the  environmental  justice 
2:46:3198:14:14:72:545:378:12:Times:12:Times:F:literature.  Our  results  also  suggest  that  the basic  utility  maximization  assumptions  underlying 
2:47:3303:14:14:72:546:364:12:Times:12:Times:F:hedonic and residential sorting models may often be violated, resulting in an important distortion 
2:48:3401:14:42:72:254:350:12:Times:12:Times:F:in the provision of local public goods.

3:64:3723:33:21:99:510:669:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:The choice of residential location is a critical economic decision for households in the
3:65:3811:21:22:99:510:648:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:United States.  It a↵ects the neighborhood with which one interacts on a daily basis.
3:66:3896:22:22:99:510:626:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:This can have important implications both in the short-run and long-run, and impacts
3:67:3980:22:22:99:510:604:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:can even accumulate across generations. Over the past decade, a growing body of evidence
3:68:4068:22:21:99:521:582:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:has found neighborhood poverty (Kling et al.,2007), employment (Bayer et al.,2008  ),
3:69:4153:21:22:99:511:561:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:school quality (Chetty et al.,2011), violent crime (Kling et al.,2005), and health outcomes
3:70:4244:22:22:99:511:539:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:from pollution exposures (Currie et al.,2015) to be important, elevating concern about
3:71:4330:22:22:99:511:517:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:whether certain groups are systematically excluded from beneficial neighborhood e↵ects
3:72:4416:22:22:99:510:495:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:or disadvantaged by segregation or discriminatory steering. A large body of observational
3:73:4505:22:21:99:510:473:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:research has also documented that patterns of residential sorting are strongly correlated
3:74:4594:21:22:99:510:452:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:with economic disparities and pollution exposures between racial groups in the United
3:75:4679:22:22:99:511:430:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:States (Alexander and Currie, 2017,Currie, 2011,Mohai et al.,2009). It has, however,
3:76:4763:22:22:99:511:408:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:been extremely challenging to disentangle the e↵ect of discrimination (steering) from
3:77:4848:22:22:99:405:386:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:preference-based sorting in evaluating these persistent disparities.
3:78:4916:22:21:115:511:364:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:This paper studies the e↵ect of racial discrimination on residential location choices
3:79:5001:21:22:99:510:343:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:in the United States housing market. Specifically, we present experimental evidence on
3:80:5087:22:22:99:510:321:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:discriminatory behavior of real estate agents and housing providers from a nation-wide
3:81:5173:22:22:99:510:299:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:paired-actor study that was conducted by the Urban Institute in conjunction with the
3:82:5257:22:21:99:510:277:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Department of Housing and Urban Development (Turner et al.,2013). The 2012 Housing
3:83:5339:21:22:99:510:256:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Discrimination Study utilized a matched-pair block randomized design that simulates the
3:84:5426:22:22:99:510:234:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:housing search process for a matched pair of “testers” who are assigned attributes that
3:85:5513:22:22:99:510:212:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:make them equally qualified to purchase a particular house or rent a particular unit.
3:86:5598:22:22:99:510:190:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Paired testers are matched to an advertised listing and randomly assigned to a real estate
3:87:5688:22:21:99:511:168:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:agent; di↵erent aspects of their search experience are then documented. According to
3:88:5772:21:22:99:510:147:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:evidence from a series of four studies executed between 1977 and 2012, incidence of the
3:89:5859:22:22:99:510:125:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:most blatant forms of housing discrimination has declined dramatically in the period
3:90:5943:22:0:99:510:103:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:following the Fair Housing Act (FHA) of 1968, but it is less clear that more subtle forms
4:91:6033:0:22:99:259:702:119:g_d0_f3:53:g_d0_f5:B:of discrimination have also fallen.1
4:92:6069:22:22:115:510:680:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:With respect to locational choice, prior studies have described the process of steering
4:93:6156:22:21:99:510:658:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:buyers into same-race neighborhoods and exacerbating historical racial segregation in
4:94:6241:21:22:99:510:637:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the housing market (Galster and Godfrey,2005  , Yinger,1995). Our paper builds upon
4:95:6324:22:22:99:510:615:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:these segregation studies by testing for evidence of systematic di↵erences in key local
4:96:6411:22:22:99:511:593:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:attributes that have been shown to a↵ect both economic and non-economic outcomes.
4:97:6492:22:21:99:510:571:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:The HUD study provides detailed information on the price, characteristics, condition,
4:98:6577:21:22:99:510:550:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:and the exact locations of homes that are shown and recommended to white versus
4:99:6656:22:22:99:510:528:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:minority buyers. While discriminatory behavior on the part of real estate agents and
4:100:6740:22:22:99:510:506:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:housing providers is just one of several channels through which racial discrimination can
4:101:6829:22:22:99:522:484:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:constrain housing options of minorities (Aaronson et al.,2017,Zhao et al.,2005  , Ondrich
4:102:6918:22:21:99:511:462:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:et al.,2003  , 1998  , Yinger,1995), this channel is crucial for disentangling the e↵ect of
4:103:7009:21:22:99:510:441:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:illegal discrimination (steering) from preference-based sorting in determining di↵erences
4:104:7098:22:22:99:510:419:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:in access to local amenities/advantages across racial groups. We formalize this argument
4:105:7186:22:22:99:511:397:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:by examining the e↵ect of discrimination on location choice using a theoretical model of
4:106:7274:22:22:99:510:375:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:housing search, which motivates the identification of discriminatory behavior in reduced-
4:107:7363:22:21:99:510:353:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:form tests as well as the welfare implications of a housing search with discrimination
4:108:7449:21:22:99:153:332:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:constraints.
4:109:7461:22:22:115:511:310:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:Our results indicate that systematic di↵erences in the homes shown to minority ver-
4:110:7544:22:22:99:510:288:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:sus white testers impart a number of critical disadvantages. Minority testers are (relative
4:111:7635:22:21:99:510:266:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:to their white counterparts) systematically recommended homes in neighborhoods with
4:112:7718:21:22:99:510:245:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:higher poverty rates, fewer college educated families, and fewer skilled workers. Important
4:113:7809:22:22:99:510:223:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:for the analysis of environmental injustice, they are also steered towards neighborhoods
4:114:7897:22:22:99:510:201:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:with higher concentrations of Superfund sites and releases from the Toxic Release In-
4:115:7982:22:22:99:510:179:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:ventory (TRI). These disparities are consistent across specifications, are stronger in the
4:116:8072:22:21:99:510:157:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:case of African American testers, and become more pronounced when tester pairs signal
4:117:8157:21:23:99:510:136:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:preferences for the neighborhood characteristic in question. In addition, African Amer-
4:118:8244:23:14:100:511:113:40:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:F:1Housing discrimination is illegal according to the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which was amended in
4:119:8342:14:11:99:510:99:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:1988. Blatant forms of discrimination include denial of appointments with a housing provider or refusal
4:120:8445:11:11:99:510:88:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:to show an advertised house. Less blatant forms include disparities in the number of houses shown or in
4:121:8548:11:0:99:301:77:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:the condition of the houses that are recommended.
5:122:8598:0:22:99:510:702:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:ican testers are more likely to be recommended houses in neighborhoods with higher
5:123:8680:22:22:99:510:680:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:assault rates and lower percentages of skilled workers. While only statistically signifi-

5:125:8857:21:22:99:510:637:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:recommended houses in neighborhoods with lower quality schools. We also find that mi-
5:126:8942:22:22:99:510:615:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:nority testers are less likely to be recommended houses in white neighborhoods, however,
5:127:9030:22:22:99:510:593:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:evidence suggests that segregation-based steering (i.e., directed by neighborhood race)
5:128:9117:22:21:99:510:571:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:cannot explain the disparities in pollution exposures resulting from discrimination. We
5:129:9204:21:22:99:511:550:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:find that di↵erences are magnified for mothers and are large enough to fully account for
5:130:9292:22:22:99:510:528:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:higher rates of sorting among African American mothers into homes near Superfund sites,
5:131:9379:22:22:99:521:506:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:as has been found in previous research on in utero pollution exposures (Currie, 2011  ).
5:132:9467:22:22:99:510:484:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Finally, we discuss the implications of discrimination of the sort revealed in this study for
5:133:9560:22:21:99:510:462:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:measures of marginal willingness to pay for an important set of local public goods (e.g., to

5:137:9841:22:22:115:510:375:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 summarizes a number of relevant literatures,
5:138:9927:22:21:99:510:353:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:including those that describe experimental approaches for broadly measuring discrimina-

5:140:10101:22:22:99:510:310:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:e↵ects on long-run outcomes; and hedonics, residential sorting models, and related non-
5:141:10188:22:22:99:510:288:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:market valuation techniques. Section 3 describes the 2012 Housing Discrimination Study
5:142:10274:22:21:99:510:266:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:(HDS), which is the source of our paired tester audit study data. In Section 4, we develop
5:143:10364:21:22:99:510:245:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:a model of housing search to characterize the welfare e↵ects of discrimination. Section
5:144:10451:22:22:99:510:223:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:5 describes our data with a particular focus on spatial attribute information that we
5:145:10536:22:22:99:510:201:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:connect to the houses in HDS 2012. Section 6 reports results that characterize the ex-
5:146:10622:22:22:99:510:179:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:tent of discrimination in the space of neighborhood attributes, and discusses some of the
5:147:10711:22:0:99:475:157:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:potential mechanisms that might be driving discrimination. Section 7 concludes.

6:150:10866:29:21:99:510:635:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:A large and growing literature utilizes field experiment techniques for detecting discrim-

6:152:11041:22:22:99:510:592:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:between audit and correspondence studies. Audit studies typically utilize a matched-pair
6:153:11129:22:22:99:511:570:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:randomized design, where a pair of actors or “testers”, di↵ering only in the character-
6:154:11216:22:22:99:510:548:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:istic of interest (e.g., race), is sent into the field to carry out an economic activity. In
6:155:11308:22:21:99:510:526:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:a correspondence study, fictitious applicants correspond only by mail or Internet.  In
6:156:11394:21:22:99:510:505:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:partnership with university researchers and institutions, the United States Department
6:157:11480:22:22:99:510:483:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:of Housing and Urban Development has conducted four major, multi-city audit studies
6:158:11563:22:22:99:510:461:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:that are designed to measure the incidence of discrimination against African American,
6:159:11649:22:21:99:510:439:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Hispanic, and Asian and Native American minority testers (relative to a white control) in
6:160:11738:21:22:99:510:418:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the context of a rental housing or real estate search. The first such study was conducted
6:161:11827:22:22:99:510:396:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:in 1977, with successive iterations occurring in 1989, 2000, and 2012. Audit studies have
6:162:11916:22:22:99:521:374:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:similarly been used to study bargaining at car dealerships (Ayres and Siegelman,1995  ),
6:163:12004:22:22:99:511:352:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:gender discrimination in hiring at restaurants (Neumark et al.,1996), and the combined
6:164:12090:22:21:99:383:330:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:e↵ects of race and criminal record on hiring (Pager, 2003  ).
6:165:12151:21:22:115:510:309:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:Audit studies are designed to fully simulate engagements between individuals in a
6:166:12232:22:22:99:510:287:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:market, often involving a series of in-person interactions and involving a full represen-
6:167:12321:22:22:99:510:265:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:tation of racial identity.  As a result, they provide a more complete characterization
6:168:12407:22:21:99:510:243:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:of discriminatory behavior as it operates in many markets.  However, this also makes
6:169:12491:21:22:99:510:222:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:them much more expensive to implement at powered scales (and therefore less common).
6:170:12575:22:22:99:511:200:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Siegelman and Heckman(1993) andHeckman(1998) describe other limitations of audit
6:171:12655:22:22:99:510:178:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:studies – for instance, it is unlikely that testers will be identical in all respects except for
6:172:12751:22:22:99:510:156:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the attribute of interest. Moreover, testers are aware of their role and may act in such a
6:173:12841:22:21:99:510:134:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:way as to try to sway the results towards or against finding evidence of discrimination.
6:174:12929:21:0:99:510:113:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:The investigator retains more control in a correspondence study, as testers do not actually
7:175:13021:0:42:99:407:702:119:g_d0_f3:53:g_d0_f5:B:exist and their attributes can therefore be more easily controlled.2

7:177:13130:29:22:99:510:631:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Within the economics literature, HDS audits have been utilized to study the persistence of
7:178:13220:22:22:99:510:609:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:discrimination and underlying behavioral mechanisms such as animus-based versus statis-
7:179:13307:22:21:99:510:587:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:tical discrimination (Guryan and Charles,2013  , Dymski,2006).3An additional hypothe-
7:180:13392:21:22:99:510:566:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:sis posits that real estate agents may have an incentive to discriminate against people of
7:181:13482:22:22:99:510:544:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:color in order to avoid losing a prejudiced white customer base. Under this hypothesis,
7:182:13569:22:22:99:511:522:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Yinger(1995) suggests that real estate agents will discriminate more in neighborhoods
7:183:13654:22:22:99:510:500:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:that are at risk of being ”flipped”and or disproportionately against minority families with
7:184:13745:22:21:99:470:478:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:children if their white customers are particularly sensitive to school integration.
7:185:13828:21:22:115:510:457:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:The consistency of the HUD design (especially 1989, 2000, 2012) has allowed for
7:186:13907:22:22:99:510:435:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:comparisons of discriminatory behavior over time, with results generally indicating a
7:187:13992:22:22:99:521:413:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:decline in exlusionary practices over the past five decades (Turner et al.,2013,2002  ).
7:188:14080:22:21:99:510:391:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Using data from a paired-tester audit study in Boston in 1981 that considered white and
7:189:14167:21:22:99:511:370:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:black renters,Yinger(1986) finds that black renters are informed about 30% fewer rental
7:190:14254:22:22:99:510:348:119:g_d0_f3:53:g_d0_f5:B:units than their white counterpart, who is also invited to inspect 57% more apartments.4
7:191:14342:22:22:99:511:326:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Page(1995) builds upon this study by employing a Poisson model to describe the number
7:192:14427:22:22:99:510:304:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:of houses shown. Using HDS 1989, she finds that black and Hispanic testers are shown
7:193:14511:22:21:99:510:282:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:80% to 90%, respectively, of the number of units shown to white testers. Results are
7:194:14595:21:22:99:510:261:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:similar for rental and sales properties and are best explained, for black testers, by the
7:195:14684:22:28:99:510:239:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:white customer or statistical discrimination mechanisms. A series of subsequent papers
7:196:14770:28:14:100:511:211:40:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:F:2One problem that might arise in both audit and correspondence studies is the potential for those being
7:197:14873:14:11:99:510:197:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:audited to check the online profile of the tester or fictitious applicant, particularly in markets where there
7:198:14983:11:11:99:510:186:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:is a high return to gathering such information (e.g., high skilled labor). To address this problem in a
7:199:15086:11:11:99:511:175:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:correspondence study,Acquisti and Fong(2015) create an online presence for their fictitious applicants
7:200:15188:11:11:99:510:164:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:in an analysis of discrimination in the labor market. In parallel analyses of labor and rental markets,
7:201:15291:11:7:99:484:153:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:Bartoˇs et al.(2013) create websites for applicants and keep track of how often they are accessed.
7:202:15389:7:14:100:511:146:40:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:F:3The common theme in these papers is measuring discrimination at the initial point of contact when
7:203:15487:14:11:99:510:132:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:the real estate agent recommends rental units or homes for purchase, and when customers are invited to
7:204:15589:11:11:99:510:121:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:inspect a property. Studies di↵er in the measures of discrimination they use and in the minority groups
7:205:15692:11:8:99:154:110:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:they consider.
7:206:15706:8:14:100:511:102:40:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:F:4Yinger argues for the inclusion of tester-pair fixed e↵ects to control for unobservables that are common
7:207:15811:14:11:99:510:88:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:to a particular audit experiment (i.e., o-ce conditions on the day that the two testers visited a particular
7:208:15919:11:0:99:403:77:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:real estate agent), and these have henceforth been common in the literature.
8:209:15996:0:22:99:510:702:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:find similar evidence of predjudice among real estate agents, statistical discrimination,
8:210:16085:22:22:99:510:680:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:and catering to a white customer base (Ondrich et al.,1998,2003,Zhao et al.,2005). The
8:211:16171:22:21:99:511:658:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:latter two papers introduce the fixed-e↵ects logit model, controlling for trial fixed e↵ects
8:212:16263:21:22:99:510:637:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:while looking for evidence of discrete instances of discrimination, and controls for testers’
8:213:16356:22:22:99:511:615:119:g_d0_f9:119:g_d0_f3:B:actualcharacteristics, recognizing that some elements of these might show through during
8:214:16444:22:22:99:145:593:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the audit.
8:215:16454:22:21:115:511:571:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:Yinger(1997) builds on the analysis ofCourant(1978) to develop a model of housing
8:216:16535:21:22:99:511:550:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:search, where discrimination a↵ects the surplus homebuyers receive through five separate
8:217:16623:22:22:99:510:528:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:mechanisms: (1) the number of houses shown, (2) the amount of assistance and encour-
8:218:16707:22:22:99:510:506:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:agement received, (3) assistance in the loan application process, (4) loan approval, and
8:219:16795:22:22:99:510:484:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:(5) physical moving costs. Calibrating the model, he finds that these mechanisms collec-
8:220:16883:22:21:99:510:462:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:tively result in a $4,000 lower expected surplus for black homebuyers from the housing
8:221:16969:21:22:99:511:441:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:search process.5Since the HDS research design focuses on discrimination that occurs at
8:222:17055:22:22:99:510:419:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the point of initial contact with the real estate agent – i.e., the point at which recommen-
8:223:17147:22:22:99:510:397:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:dations are given and the choice set is narrowed – the results of HDS analyses describe
8:224:17234:22:21:99:510:375:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:one particular form of housing market discrimination that could be compounded by other
8:225:17320:21:22:99:511:354:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:forms of discrimination in the process of searching for, financing6, and purchasing a home.
8:226:17411:22:22:99:510:332:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Prior literature has included arguments in favor of and against the reliable extension of
8:227:17500:22:22:99:510:310:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:inferences from partial audit studies to estimate the full extent of compounded impacts,
8:228:17588:22:22:99:510:288:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:though it is clear that the direct results of the HDS must be interpreted as a lower bound.
8:229:17679:22:21:115:510:266:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:According to the comparative work done across HDS studies, the single persistent

8:237:18349:11:11:99:510:121:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:also occurs in the mortgage lending industry. O-cial government guidance for mortgage lenders in the

8:240:18653:11:11:99:511:88:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:buyers were steered towards those neighborhoods, red-lining would make home-ownership more di-cult,

12:337:26566:22:21:99:511:587:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:from the locational choices of households.  For instance,Currie(2011) provides some
12:338:26649:21:22:99:510:566:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:evidence that the mothers who are most likely to live within the vicinity of a Superfund
12:339:26737:22:22:99:510:544:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:site after cleanup are more likely to be white and college educated.  Similarly, white
12:340:26823:22:22:99:510:522:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:mothers are less likely to reside within the vicinity of a plant that emits toxic pollutants
12:341:26915:22:22:99:511:500:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:after emissions are disclosed. While these estimates suggest di↵erential patterns of sorting
12:342:27007:22:21:99:510:478:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:in response to changes in the level or information about pollution exposures, it is not clear
12:343:27100:21:22:99:510:457:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:whether all households in these samples had access to the same choices. The hedonics and
12:344:27188:22:22:99:510:435:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:sorting literatures have typically ignored housing market discrimination because it cannot
12:345:27278:22:22:99:510:413:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:be identified from observational data in housing markets. However, if discrimination is at
12:346:27368:22:21:99:510:391:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:play, then we cannot expect all housing units to be freely chosen. This distortion would
12:347:27456:21:22:99:511:370:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:bias estimates of the value of di↵erent amenities. In the simplest terms, we may understate
12:348:27547:22:22:99:510:348:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:a minority group’s willingness to pay for pollution reductions if those households live in
12:349:27637:22:22:99:443:326:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:a polluted neighborhood not by free choice but because of discrimination.
12:350:27710:22:22:115:510:304:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:The most commonly used methods for valuing local public goods and amenities rely on
12:351:27793:22:21:99:511:282:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the observed decisions that individuals make in housing markets.Rosen(1974) provides
12:352:27877:21:22:99:510:261:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the theory for recovering preferences from residential location decisions.  Simply put,
12:353:27964:22:22:99:510:239:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the hedonic gradient reveals the slope of the individual’s utility function in the space
12:354:28052:22:22:99:510:217:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:of amenities and house prices. That slope represents marginal willingness to pay under
12:355:28138:22:22:99:510:195:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the assumption that individuals are free to choose where to live (i.e., decisions were
12:356:28224:22:21:99:510:173:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:not constrained by discrimination).  This same assumption is required for a class of
12:357:28308:21:22:99:511:152:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:models of e-cient public goods provision beginning withTiebout(1956).  While the
12:358:28388:22:22:99:510:130:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:hedonic literature uses the equilibrium outcome of those sorting decisions, a structural
12:359:28476:22:22:99:510:108:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:literature builds models that instead derive preference estimates from the sorting decisions
12:360:28568:22:0:99:510:86:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:themselves. Sorting models have also been used to predict the outcomes of urban policies,
13:361:28659:0:22:99:511:702:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:especially when those policies are large and likely to result in equilibrium feedback e↵ects.

18:561:38314:21:22:99:510:289:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:and attributes of advertised listings (assigned to buyers) and a set of recommended list-
18:562:38403:22:22:99:510:267:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:ings that results from the search.  Figure2 illustrates the search process for trials in
18:563:38491:22:22:99:510:245:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Chicago and in Los Angeles, each involving a white and a paired Asian tester. In both
18:564:38576:22:34:99:510:223:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:of these cases, the housing search process yielded two independent sets of listings that

18:572:39232:14:11:99:510:110:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:(am/pm), type of recommended building, total number of homes recommended to tester, and avail-
18:573:39326:11:8:99:280:99:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:ability of advertised home as stated by agent.
18:574:39372:8:14:96:511:91:40:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:F:19Buyers are instructed to express zero geographic preference aside from that which might be inferred
18:575:39473:14:0:99:271:77:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:from their interest in the advertised listing.
19:576:39521:0:22:99:510:702:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:were recommended to the testers. In each map, the black dot indicates the advertised
19:577:39605:22:22:99:510:680:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:listing that was requested by each tester. Red dots indicate houses recommended to the
19:578:39691:22:21:99:510:658:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:white tester, and blue dots indicate houses recommended to the Asian tester. Green dots
19:579:39778:21:22:99:510:637:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:indicate houses that were recommended to both testers. There are a few things to notice
19:580:39865:22:22:99:510:615:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:from these maps. The first is that recommended properties for both testers tend to be
19:581:39950:22:22:99:510:593:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:in relatively close geographic proximity to one another, suggesting that the common ad-
19:582:40037:22:21:99:510:571:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:vertised house carries some weight in the recommendation process. The second thing to
19:583:40122:21:22:99:510:550:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:notice is that, while all of the recommendations are relatively close by, they do exhibit
19:584:40211:22:22:99:510:528:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:some spatial clustering by race.  Third, we note that there is some overlap in recom-
19:585:40296:22:22:99:510:506:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:mended houses. In Los Angeles, 5 out of 23 total recommendations are shared between
19:586:40379:22:22:99:510:484:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the two testers. However, this is not always the case – the white and Asian tester only
19:587:40466:22:21:99:494:462:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:share one common recommendation out of 15 total recommended houses in Chicago.
19:588:40544:21:22:115:510:441:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:The full sample of properties from the buyer study contains 6,962 advertised listings
19:589:40629:22:22:99:510:419:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:and 21,496 recommendations. Basic characteristics and price information are taken from
19:590:40715:22:22:99:510:397:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the HUD study data files. The HUD data files also contain extensive data on the true and

19:593:40984:21:22:99:510:332:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:agents during the study. Table1 reports descriptive statistics on the general characteris-
19:594:41074:22:22:99:510:310:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:tics of testers recruited into in the sample. The average age of testers in the study is 41
19:595:41165:22:22:99:510:288:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:and about two thirds of them are female. Home-owners and renters are well-represented
19:596:41250:22:21:99:510:266:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:amongst those working as testers, though the majority are renters at the time of their
19:597:41336:21:22:99:510:245:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:participation in the study. The median tester in the sample has a bachelor’s degree and
19:598:41423:22:42:99:480:223:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:more than half of the sample earns less than $30,000 per year in personal income.

21:666:46939:22:0:115:510:79:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:The HUD design intentionally constructs assignment profiles that err on the side
22:667:47021:0:22:99:510:702:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:of providing minority testers with slightly higher qualifications. For example, minority
22:668:47109:22:22:99:510:680:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:testers in all groups have been employed for 1-2 years longer and have lived for 1-2 years
22:669:47199:22:21:99:510:658:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:longer at their current address than their white counterparts.  All actor and assigned
22:670:47285:21:22:99:510:637:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:characteristics are included as controls in the tests for discrimination.  Balance tests
22:671:47373:22:22:99:510:615:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:reveal that advertisements for single-family homes are assigned at slightly higher rates
22:672:47461:22:22:99:510:593:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:and multi-family advertisements at slightly lower rates to Asian testers.  There is no
22:673:47547:22:21:99:511:571:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:evidence of di↵erences in the pollution levels, block group characteristics, or listing prices
22:674:47641:21:50:99:274:550:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:of homes assigned within tester pairs.

22:676:47689:32:22:99:510:468:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:This section reports the results of a series of tests of hypotheses that arise from the model
22:677:47782:22:22:99:510:446:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:presented above. Specifically, we test for e↵ects of the tester’s race on choice set size and
22:678:47875:22:22:99:510:424:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:composition while also exploring the role of the information provided by the tester in the
22:679:47965:22:42:99:235:402:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:form of the advertised house.

22:681:48051:29:22:99:510:331:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:The model of housing search presented above shows that the expected utility of a buyer’s
22:682:48139:22:21:99:511:309:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:choice set will be unambiguously lower when fewer homes are o↵ered as available choices.
22:683:48227:21:22:99:510:288:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:A first-order question regarding the e↵ect of housing discrimination concerns the e↵ect of
22:684:48317:22:22:99:510:266:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:real estate agent behavior on the number of recommendations provided to the minority
22:685:48401:22:22:99:274:244:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:tester relative to a white counterpart.
22:686:48440:22:22:115:511:222:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:Table5 reports estimates from two highly related variants of this test.  A row in
22:687:48521:22:21:99:510:200:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the table presents estimates of di↵erences between a minority tester and a white tester,
22:688:48609:21:22:99:510:179:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:where minority is defined as self-identified as African American, Hispanic, or Asian. The
22:689:48698:22:22:99:511:157:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:first two columns test for di↵erences in the total number of recommendations provided
22:690:48783:22:22:99:510:135:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:to minority testers relative to the white tester in the same trial, whereas the third and
22:691:48872:22:21:99:511:113:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:fourth columns test for di↵erences in the availability (communicated by the agent) of the
22:692:48961:21:0:99:511:92:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:advertised home. Columns 2 and 4 add controls for di↵erences that may be due to a
23:693:49044:0:22:99:511:702:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:buyer’s implied preference for price (↵i) and neighborhood characteristics (-i) using the
23:694:49133:22:22:99:510:680:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:listing price and racial composition of the neighborhood where the advertised listing is
23:695:49221:22:21:99:510:658:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:located. While point estimates indicate that African American and, to a lesser extent,
23:696:49307:21:22:99:511:637:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Asian buyers receive fewer recommendations than their white counterparts, this di↵erence
23:697:49395:22:22:99:511:615:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:is not statistically significant. Neither are any of the di↵erences in the likelihood of the
23:698:49487:22:22:99:510:593:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:advertised home being available statistically significant. This is important, as refusing to
23:699:49579:22:21:99:510:571:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:suggest a property or making a claim that a particular property is unavailable is a more
23:700:49667:21:22:99:510:550:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:blatant form of discrimination that had been prevalent in previous HDS studies. While
23:701:49752:22:22:99:511:528:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:di↵erences may still persist, they are not statistically significant in this sample.  This
23:702:49842:22:22:99:511:506:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:test does not, however, imply anything about di↵erences in thequalityof the houses or
23:703:49927:22:42:99:306:484:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:neighborhoods that are being recommended.
23:704:49968:42:29:99:511:442:171:g_d0_f2:171:g_d0_f2:C:6.2  Are Minority Buyers Steered into Minority Neighborhoods?
23:705:50029:29:22:99:510:413:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:We begin our discussion of steering by examining the channel that has been the focus of
23:706:50116:22:21:99:511:391:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:previous research (Yinger,1995  , Galster and Godfrey,2005). In particular, we consider
23:707:50203:21:22:99:511:370:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the extent to which the racial composition of neighborhoods di↵ers for homes recom-
23:708:50286:22:22:99:510:348:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:mended to minority testers relative to a white counterpart. Table6 reports estimates
23:709:50370:22:22:99:510:326:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:of di↵erences in the share of white households in the census block group that contains
23:710:50456:22:22:99:510:304:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:a home recommended to a minority versus a white tester.  Columns I - V introduce
23:711:50536:22:21:99:510:282:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:additional controls for attributes of the advertised house, which capture the implied pref-
23:712:50627:21:22:99:511:261:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:erences of the testers for housing price (↵i) and neighborhood characteristics (-i), such
23:713:50716:22:22:99:510:239:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:as neighborhood racial composition and the share of households below the poverty line.
23:714:50802:22:22:99:510:217:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:In each case, African Americans are recommended homes in neighborhoods with a lower
23:715:50885:22:21:99:510:195:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:share of white households compared with those recommended to their white counterparts.
23:716:50971:21:22:99:510:174:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:This di↵erence does not change when we control for the neighborhood racial composition,
23:717:51058:22:28:99:493:152:119:g_d0_f3:53:g_d0_f5:B:poverty rate, or price of the advertised listing that a tester presents to their agent.25
23:718:51147:28:14:96:510:124:40:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:F:25In Appendix Tables16-21, we report results of tests that examine steering into neighborhoods by the
23:719:51248:14:11:99:510:110:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:share of households from each of the three minority groups in the HDS study. These results demonstrate
23:720:51350:11:11:99:510:99:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:that African American testers are more likely to be steered towards neighborhoods with a higher share
23:721:51451:11:11:99:510:88:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:of African American households, but evidence of steering into same-race neighborhoods is not as evident
23:722:51554:11:0:99:181:77:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:for the other groups.
24:723:51577:0:22:115:510:702:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:These estimates confirm the results documented in prior studies on steering and seg-
24:724:51661:22:22:99:510:680:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:regation, providing strong evidence that a tester’s race directly influences the racial com-
24:725:51753:22:21:99:510:658:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:position of the neighborhoods that define his choice set. This occurs in the absence of
24:726:51840:21:22:99:510:637:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:any explicit information about preferences for demographic or other neighborhood char-
24:727:51926:22:22:99:510:615:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:acteristics (-i) and is directly attributable to a buyer’s race (Zi).  The e↵ect persists
24:728:52015:22:22:99:510:593:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:irrespective of information about neighborhood preferences (-i) implied by an advertised
24:729:52103:22:21:99:235:571:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:listing presented to an agent.
24:730:52133:21:22:115:510:550:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:Digging deeper, the estimates presented in Table7 indicate that the results found
24:731:52214:22:22:99:511:528:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f9:B:in Table6 are primarily driven by steering of African American buyers away fromhigh
24:732:52297:22:22:99:511:506:119:g_d0_f9:119:g_d0_f3:B:incomewhite neighborhoods. The steering e↵ect is strong in high income white neigh-
24:733:52380:22:22:99:510:484:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:borhoods and is present for the minority group as a whole. It persists when we control
24:734:52466:22:21:99:510:462:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:for the listed price, the neighborhood racial composition, and the poverty rate of the
24:735:52552:21:22:99:511:441:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:advertised listing. These di↵erences become much smaller for African American testers
24:736:52637:22:22:99:510:419:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:in medium-income white neighborhoods and disappear for the group of minority testers
24:737:52721:22:22:99:510:397:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:as a whole. The e↵ect actually reverses for low-income white neighborhoods, such that
24:738:52806:22:22:99:511:375:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Hispanic and Asian testers aremorelikely than their white counterpart (with the same
24:739:52890:22:42:99:444:353:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:income) to receive recommendations in a low-income white neighborhood.

24:741:53019:29:21:99:510:282:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:This section presents the core set of tests of our study, which extend the examination
24:742:53105:21:22:99:510:261:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:of discriminatory steering to analyze a set of key neighborhood characteristics that have
24:743:53194:22:22:99:511:239:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:been shown to have e↵ects on critical short- and long-run outcomes.  Evidence from
24:744:53276:22:22:99:510:217:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:revealed preference studies in housing markets also indicates that buyers have strong
24:745:53361:22:21:99:510:195:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:preferences for these characteristics.  We therefore assume that the average buyer in
24:746:53446:21:22:99:510:174:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the sample of HUD markets will have preferences for these neighborhood attributes and
24:747:53531:22:22:99:510:152:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:that discriminatory constraints along these dimensions will have a non-trivial impact on
24:748:53619:22:22:99:510:130:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:expected utility. We test for the e↵ect of discriminatory behavior on recommendations
24:749:53704:22:22:99:481:108:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:of homes with each of the following neighborhood characteristics described above.
24:750:53785:22:0:115:507:86:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:The two panels of Table8 present core results from tests of di↵erences between the
25:751:53869:0:22:99:510:702:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:homes recommended to minority versus white testers along key neighborhood dimensions.
25:752:53954:22:22:99:510:680:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:All estimates include controls for characteristics of advertised homes, and for tests that
25:753:54044:22:21:99:510:658:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:use census block and pollution variables we report sharpened q-values using a Hochberg
25:754:54130:21:22:99:510:637:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:adjustment to control for the family-wise false discovery rate (Benjamini and Hochberg,
25:755:54217:22:22:99:511:615:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:1995  ).26We find substantial disparities in the attributes of neighborhoods recommended
25:756:54305:22:22:99:511:593:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:to minority testers relative to their white counterparts. The first panel of Table8 shows
25:757:54394:22:21:99:510:571:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:that minority testers (as a whole) are recommended homes in census block groups with
25:758:54478:21:22:99:511:550:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:higher poverty rates (1.25%) and fewer high skilled neighbors (-2.28%).27Considering the
25:759:54566:22:22:99:510:528:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:average values of these neighborhood attributes over all houses in the set of advertised
25:760:54654:22:22:99:510:506:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:listings (8.9% and 46.7%), these impacts are substantial (particularly so for poverty).
25:761:54741:22:22:99:511:484:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:We do not find statistically significant di↵erences in the percentage of college educated
25:762:54830:22:21:99:488:462:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:residents in neighborhoods recommended to minorities when considered as a whole.
25:763:54910:21:22:115:511:441:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:Below the estimates of di↵erences between white testers and minorities, we report
25:764:54991:22:22:99:511:419:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:di↵erences by racial group.  Overall, these estimates indicate that African American
25:765:55075:22:22:99:510:397:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:testers are shown homes that are in census block groups characterized by higher poverty
25:766:55162:22:22:99:510:375:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:rates (+1.24%), lower shares of skilled workers (-2.72%), and lower shares of college
25:767:55247:22:21:99:510:353:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:educated neighbors (-3.04%), although the result for poverty is not statistically significant
25:768:55340:21:22:99:510:332:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:at traditional levels. The disparities between white and Hispanic testers are even larger
25:769:55429:22:22:99:510:310:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:in terms of the poverty rate and high-skill neighbors but smaller and insignificant for

25:771:55600:22:21:99:483:266:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:not significant along any of the dimensions of neighborhood capital that we study.

26:783:56576:22:22:99:510:680:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:consider tester households separately by the presence of children, the e↵ect school quality
26:784:56667:22:21:99:510:658:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:for African American households with kids is indeed negative and significant atp<0.1.
26:785:56752:21:22:99:510:637:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:This echos results from previous research which had described real estate agents as being
26:786:56841:22:22:99:510:615:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:motivated to discriminate out of a fear of backlash from white customers responding to
26:787:56927:22:22:99:291:593:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the integration of a neighborhood school.
26:788:56968:22:21:115:510:571:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:The second panel of Table8 focuses on neighborhood disamenities – assaults and
26:789:57046:21:22:99:510:550:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:three environmental nuisances – proximity to Superfund sites, air toxics (as measured
26:790:57131:22:22:99:510:528:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:by the EPA’s RSEI), and PM2.5, an important criteria pollutant with substantial long
26:791:57215:22:22:99:510:506:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:run health e↵ects. Considering all minority groups as a whole, we see statistically signif-
26:792:57306:22:22:99:511:484:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:icant di↵erences in the proximity to Superfund sites and air toxics relative to the houses
26:793:57396:22:21:99:511:462:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:recommended to white testers. The di↵erence in assaults is positive, although not statis-
26:794:57485:21:22:99:511:441:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:tically significant. However, considering only African Americans, we find the di↵erence
26:795:57572:22:22:99:511:419:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:in assaults to be positive and statistically significant. The magnitude of that di↵erence
26:796:57661:22:22:99:510:397:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:(+23.80) is large compared to the average number of assaults across all advertised houses
26:797:57750:22:22:99:510:375:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:(93).  The same is true for Superfund proximity (a di↵erence of +0.12 relative to an
26:798:57834:22:21:99:510:353:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:average of 0.33) and air toxicity (a di↵erence of +915.45 relative to an average of 6,071).
26:799:57925:21:22:99:510:332:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Asians show similar statistically significant di↵erences for Superfund proximity and air
26:800:58013:22:22:99:510:310:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:toxics. Point estimates for Hispanics are positive, but estimates are smaller in magnitude
26:801:58103:22:22:99:236:288:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:and statistically insignificant.
26:802:58135:22:21:115:510:266:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:In contrast to air toxics, results with respect to particulate matter show very little
26:803:58221:21:22:99:511:245:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:di↵erence across testers. The average value of particulate matter in the sample of adver-
26:804:58310:22:22:99:511:223:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:tised houses is 9.283. Asian testers do exhibit a statistically significant di↵erence with
26:805:58400:22:22:99:511:201:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:their white counterparts of -0.1283, but this di↵erence is very small in magnitude. None
26:806:58488:22:22:99:510:179:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:of the other race groups exhibit statistically significant di↵erences within tester pairs.
26:807:58578:22:21:99:511:157:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:We suspect that this is due to an important di↵erence between particulate matter and
26:808:58662:21:22:99:510:136:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:air toxics.  In particular, spatial variation in particulate matter concentrations occurs
26:809:58751:22:22:99:510:114:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:over large geographies, whereas air toxics can vary from neighborhood to neighborood.
26:810:58836:22:0:99:510:92:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Because real estate agents do tend to recommend houses within relatively small bu↵ers
27:811:58923:0:22:99:510:702:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:around the advertised house to both testers within a pair, the scope for steering with
27:812:59009:22:22:99:468:680:119:g_d0_f3:53:g_d0_f5:B:respect to particulate matter is far lower than that with respect to air toxics.28
27:813:59091:22:21:115:506:658:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:Table9 reports di↵erences for the subsample of testers (37%) who are assigned an
27:814:59171:21:22:99:511:637:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:identity of mother (female with children). We find that the di↵erences are magnified for
27:815:59259:22:22:99:510:615:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:this group. In particular, we find that minority mothers are steered into neighborhoods
27:816:59346:22:22:99:511:593:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:with a +4.81% higher poverty rate than white mothers and that this di↵erence is partic-
27:817:59433:22:21:99:510:571:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:ularly stark for African American (+5.23%) and Hispanic (+5.60%) mothers. Recall that
27:818:59518:21:22:99:510:550:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the average poverty rate in the neighborhoods surrounding the set of advertised houses
27:819:59604:22:22:99:511:528:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:is only 8.9%. Di↵erences in the skill level and share of college educated households in
27:820:59691:22:22:99:510:506:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:neighborhoods recommended to African American and Hispanic/LatinX mothers are also
27:821:59773:22:22:99:511:484:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:much larger than the di↵erences for the average tester. Homes recommended to African
27:822:59857:22:21:99:510:462:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:American mothers have a 35% higher incidence in nearby assaults (+33), a 52% higher
27:823:59940:21:22:99:510:441:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:number of nearby Superfund sites (+0.17), and a 37% higher (+2,269.92) level of expo-
27:824:60025:22:22:99:510:419:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:sure to air toxics than white mothers. The exception is for elementary school quality – we
27:825:60115:22:22:99:510:397:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:find some evidence that homes recommended to Hispanic/LatinX mothers have higher
27:826:60195:22:42:99:214:375:119:g_d0_f3:53:g_d0_f5:B:school quality (+0.84).29

27:828:60274:27:29:133:294:306:171:g_d0_f2:171:g_d0_f2:C:Discriminatory Steering?
27:829:60298:29:22:99:510:277:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:The HDS study was not designed to provide the experimental variation of the sort that
27:830:60383:22:21:99:510:255:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:would be needed to identify behavioral mechanisms underlying discriminatory steering in
27:831:60470:21:22:99:511:234:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the housing market. However, the di↵erences that we identify in discriminatory steering
27:832:60557:22:23:99:510:212:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:do provide valuable information about the behavior of real estate agents. For instance, it
27:833:60647:23:14:96:507:189:40:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:F:28Appendix Table24 demonstrates that these di↵erences do not change when we control for the pref-
27:834:60744:14:11:99:510:175:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:erences of di↵erent types of buyers in the study (using preferences implied by the characteristics of
27:835:60845:11:11:99:510:164:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:advertised listings) or for the price of the advertised home. Three columns appear under each neighbor-
27:836:60948:11:11:99:510:153:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:hood characteristic. Moving from the first to the second column adds in controls for the corresponding
27:837:61050:11:10:99:510:142:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:characteristic of the advertised house, the racial composition of the advertised house, and the price of
27:838:61154:10:8:99:501:132:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:the advertised house. In each case, the coe-cient on tester race does not change in a significant way.
27:839:61256:8:14:96:510:124:40:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:F:29Appendix Table23 breaks down e↵ects by race and gender. We find similar results with respect to
27:840:61353:14:11:99:510:110:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:school quality in that e↵ects are large, negative and significant for female African American testers as
27:841:61457:11:11:99:510:99:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:a whole. We also see that the impact of African American race on the poverty rate of recommended
27:842:61553:11:11:99:511:88:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:neighborhood is stark for males. Other gender e↵ects are not, however, uniform across all neighborhood
27:843:61655:11:0:99:181:77:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:attributes and races.
28:844:61678:0:22:99:510:702:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:is possible that steering of African Americans away from white neighborhoods is driven by
28:845:61767:22:22:99:510:680:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:a racial animus and a desire to segregate that population as other studies have posited.
28:846:61855:22:21:99:510:658:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:However, a strict interpretation of racial animus is inconsistent with the findings pre-
28:847:61943:21:22:99:511:637:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:sented in Table7, which demonstrate that steering does not occur solely into same-race
28:848:62029:22:22:99:510:615:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:neighborhoods and but rather depends on the interaction between race and neighborhood
28:849:62114:22:22:99:143:593:119:g_d0_f3:53:g_d0_f5:B:income.30
28:850:62123:22:21:115:511:571:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:Another explanation that might explain neighborhood e↵ects as well as this income
28:851:62204:21:22:99:510:550:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:component could be that real estate agents discriminate by discounting African Amer-
28:852:62288:22:22:99:510:528:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:ican testers’ financial credentials, steering them towards lower income neighborhoods
28:853:62373:22:22:99:511:506:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:where houses are also lower priced. However, as seen in Table10, we do not find any
28:854:62456:22:22:99:510:484:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:evidence that minority testers receive recommendations for lower priced homes relative
28:855:62542:22:21:99:510:462:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:to their white paired testers. Looking at point estimates alone, it appears that homes
28:856:62628:21:22:99:510:441:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:recommended to Hispanic/LatinX buyers may be moderately less expensive than those
28:857:62709:22:22:99:510:419:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:recommended to their white counterparts, but that African American and Asian buyers
28:858:62792:22:22:99:442:397:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:receive recommendations that may somewhat more expensive on average.
28:859:62860:22:22:115:510:375:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:We perform an additional test to rule out this potential mechanism in Appendix
28:860:62938:22:21:99:511:353:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:Table24. Three columns correspond to each neighborhood characteristic in this table
28:861:63021:21:22:99:510:332:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:– for each characteristic, the third column incorporates an additional control into the
28:862:63108:22:22:99:510:310:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:main regression specification that measures the average neighborhood characteristic for
28:863:63195:22:22:99:510:288:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:all houses in the sample that fall in the same $20,000 price bin as the recommended
28:864:63278:22:21:99:511:266:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:house.31We are therefore testing whether, within a set of houses of similar price, are
28:865:63364:21:22:99:511:245:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:minority testers recommended houses with systematically di↵erent attributes. The main
28:866:63449:22:22:99:372:223:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:results in our table are invariant to this additional control.
28:867:63511:22:22:115:510:201:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, the steering behavior that we observe could also be driven by a form of statis-
28:868:63599:22:22:99:510:179:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:tical discrimination where real estate agents believe that the preferences of an individual
28:869:63690:22:21:99:510:157:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:buyer are the same as those of other members of their racial group. Alternatively, agents
28:870:63779:21:23:99:510:136:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:could simply believe that buyers have a preference for neighborhoods with households
28:871:63863:23:14:96:511:113:40:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:F:30In other results, we do not find evidence of clear di↵erences in steering behavior among real estate
28:872:63965:14:8:99:510:99:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:agents of the same group as the buyer (versus di↵erent group). Results available in an online appendix.
28:873:64068:8:14:96:511:91:40:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:F:31Note that limitations on our ability to match scraped school quality and assault data to the HUD data
28:874:64171:14:0:99:496:77:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:reduce our sample size by enough that we cannot perform this test for those two outcome variables.

29:880:64703:22:22:99:510:593:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:interaction between tester race and the share of white households in the neighborhood of

29:882:64879:21:22:99:510:550:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:with the four columns pertaining to the respective share of white, black, Hispanic/LatinX,
29:883:64969:22:22:99:510:528:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:and Asian households in the neighborhood of the recommended home. The results show
29:884:65051:22:22:99:511:506:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:that the steering e↵ect is stronger for African American buyers who present listings in
29:885:65138:22:22:99:511:484:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:neighborhoods with a higher percentage of white households. The e↵ect is of the same
29:886:65222:22:21:99:510:462:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:sign but not as large and is not significant for Hispanic/LatinX buyers. Not only do we
29:887:65309:21:22:99:510:441:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:find that real estate agents do not take into account own-race preferences of African Amer-
29:888:65400:22:22:99:510:419:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:ican buyers when making recommendations – they actively work in opposition to those
29:889:65483:22:42:99:510:397:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:preferences. This implies a mechanism that goes beyond simple statistical discrimination.

29:891:65622:29:22:99:510:326:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:The results described above provide evidence that minorities receive housing recommen-
29:892:65708:22:22:99:510:304:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:dations in neighborhoods that could disadvantage them in numerous dimensions. The
29:893:65789:22:21:99:511:282:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:magnitude of the e↵ect of housing discrimination also depends on the information, pref-
29:894:65876:21:22:99:511:261:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:erences, and behavior of buyers. Therefore, obtaining precise estimates of welfare e↵ects
29:895:65965:22:22:99:510:239:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:would require an experiment that examines discriminatory behavior within the context of
29:896:66052:22:22:99:510:217:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:real preferences of individuals making decisions in a housing market. This would clearly
29:897:66140:22:21:99:305:195:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:be an undesirable experiment to implement.
29:898:66182:21:22:115:510:174:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:We expect that some buyers may be less informed about pollution exposures, school

29:900:66350:22:22:99:511:130:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the evidence on locational choice and persistent inequality,Currie(2011) discusses the
29:901:66436:22:22:99:511:108:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:potential e↵ects of educational disparities in determining locational choices near Super-

30:903:66616:0:22:99:510:702:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:suggest that if buyers who lack information are more likely to be steered by their real
30:904:66703:22:22:99:510:680:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:estate agent, then minority buyers are likely to be di↵erentially steered and subsequently
30:905:66793:22:21:99:168:658:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:disadvantaged.

30:913:67393:22:22:99:510:484:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:of cities with large minority populations, 24% of homes recommended to the sample of
30:914:67477:22:21:99:510:462:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:mothers fall within 2 km of a Superfund site. The test indicates that African American
30:915:67563:21:22:99:510:441:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:mothers are 10 percentage points more likely to receive a recommendation within 2km

30:917:67737:22:22:99:511:397:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:than their white counterpart. These estimates suggest that the di↵erences in maternal
30:918:67822:22:22:99:510:375:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:exposures from residential location could be entirely explained by discriminatory steering

30:922:68122:22:22:99:510:288:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:program provided vouchers for residents living in neighborhoods with a poverty rate of
30:923:68208:22:21:99:510:266:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:greater than 40% to obtain subsidies in neighborhoods with poverty rates of less than

31:941:69782:21:22:99:510:550:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:this comparison. In particular, we isolate the e↵ect of housing discrimination occurring
31:942:69870:22:22:99:511:528:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:in a single stage of the housing search process; the steering e↵ect that we identify is
31:943:69957:22:22:99:511:506:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:therefore likely a lower bound on the e↵ect of total discrimination, though these estimates
31:944:70048:22:22:99:511:484:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f9:B:suggest that the impacts of discriminatory steering are bothstatisticallyandeconomically

31:948:70320:22:22:99:511:397:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:outcomes associated with multiple neighborhood e↵ects. Another type of buyer may be
31:949:70403:22:21:99:510:375:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:well-informed, but may not have strong preferences for the neighborhood and pollution

31:951:70574:22:22:99:510:332:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:will determine the e↵ects in our model of expected utility. However, it is important to
31:952:70661:22:22:99:510:310:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:note that a minority buyer that does not have strong preferences for the neighborhood
31:953:70746:22:22:99:511:288:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:characteristics that we study will nonetheless experience di↵erent outcomes than a white
31:954:70834:22:21:99:510:266:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:buyer with the exact same preferences. Assuming that these buyers are more likely to
31:955:70918:21:22:99:510:245:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:be steered into neighborhoods with higher levels of poverty and pollution exposures,
31:956:71002:22:22:99:391:223:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:discriminatory steering will put them at a direct disadvantage.

32:969:72148:22:21:99:510:658:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:neighborhood poverty, college education, high skill and school quality are all strongly
32:970:72235:21:22:99:510:637:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:correlated with race (although the same is less evident for assaults, Superfund proximity,

32:975:72678:22:22:99:510:528:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:about the impact of agent behavior on the welfare of whites and minorities from housing

32:985:73493:22:22:99:510:310:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:are the omitted racial group, have a strong positive and statistically significant relation-
32:986:73585:22:22:99:510:288:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:ship between each recommended house attribute and their preference for that attribute
32:987:73670:22:21:99:510:266:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:expressed through their advertised house.  For African Americans, this relationship is
32:988:73756:21:22:99:510:245:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:significantly weakened for every neighborhood attribute with the exception of Superfund
32:989:73843:22:22:99:510:223:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:proximity. Hispanic testers have a significantly weaker relationship in the case of high
32:990:73931:22:22:99:510:201:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:skill, school quality and air toxics, and Asian testers have a weaker relationship in the case
32:991:74025:22:22:99:510:179:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:of assaults and all of the pollution variables. In the case of poverty, high skill and college
32:992:74119:22:15:96:511:157:40:g_d0_f6:82:g_d0_f7:F:36The seemingly obvious solution to this problem would be to estimate preferences for buyers of di↵erent
32:993:74223:15:10:99:510:142:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:race groups from observed housing transactions data – indeed, this is done commonly in the hedonics and
32:994:74326:10:11:99:510:132:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:residential sorting literatures. We highlight here, however, that such estimates will themselves likely be
32:995:74432:11:11:99:511:121:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:contaminated by constraints imposed by real estate agents of the sort discribed above. Put di↵erently,
32:996:74534:11:11:99:510:110:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:discrimination is likely already “baked in” to utility parameters derived from revealed preference data.
32:997:74638:11:11:99:510:99:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:This is a broader problem for work in non-market valuation and allocation of funds to the provision of
32:998:74740:11:11:99:510:88:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:public goods; in the current context, it makes it di-cult to draw strong conclusions about welfare e↵ects
32:999:74845:11:0:99:154:77:82:g_d0_f7:82:g_d0_f7:F:from steering.
33:1000:74861:0:22:99:510:702:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:education, Asian testers exhibit a stronger relationship than their white counterpart, and
33:1001:74951:22:22:99:510:680:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the same is true in the case of assaults for Hispanic testers. However, particularly for
33:1002:75039:22:21:99:510:658:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:African Americans, individual preferences are ignored by real estate agents relative to
33:1003:75126:21:22:99:510:637:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the case of whites. This leads to a relative reduction in expected utility from the search
33:1004:75216:22:50:99:136:615:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:process.
33:1005:75224:50:32:99:217:565:246:g_d0_f2:246:g_d0_f2:C:7  Conclusions
33:1006:75238:32:22:99:510:533:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:In this paper, we find strong evidence that contact with real estate agents di↵erentially
33:1007:75327:22:22:99:510:511:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:constrains the choice sets of minority buyers relative to a white counterpart. Building on
33:1008:75417:22:21:99:511:489:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:prior literature, we show that while discrimination no longer has a significant e↵ect on
33:1009:75505:21:22:99:510:468:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the number of recommendations a minority buyer receives, it does have strong impacts on
33:1010:75592:22:22:99:510:446:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the quality of the neighborhoods that constitute the recommended set. The implications
33:1011:75678:22:22:99:510:424:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:of these constraints are quite clear – the constraints imposed by real estate agents in the
33:1012:75769:22:22:99:510:402:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:search process provide all minority groups with houses to choose from that are worse in
33:1013:75856:22:21:99:311:380:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:at least one (but typically many) dimensions.
33:1014:75901:21:22:115:510:359:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:This is a result with implications for several literatures in economics.  First, it is
33:1015:75987:22:22:99:511:337:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:important for studies of “neighborhood e↵ects”, which analyze the ways in which neigh-
33:1016:76073:22:22:99:511:315:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:borhood attributes a↵ect short and long-run (even multi-generational) outcomes in the
33:1017:76158:22:22:99:510:293:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:dimensions of poverty, employment, schooling, criminal activity and public safety, and
33:1018:76244:22:21:99:510:271:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:environmental health. Prior research has demonstrated clearly that residential location
33:1019:76331:21:22:99:511:250:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:choices can a↵ect short- and long-run outcomes; the steering behavior that we identify
33:1020:76417:22:22:99:511:228:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:a↵ects the neighborhood attributes in the household’s choice set, and ultimately their
33:1021:76503:22:22:99:314:206:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:house purchase decision, in an important way.
33:1022:76548:22:21:115:510:184:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:Second, our results demonstrate that minority homebuyers and renters may not be
33:1023:76627:21:22:98:511:163:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:“free to choose”in the housing market, and that their observed behavior may not actually
33:1024:76715:22:22:99:510:141:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:reveal their preferences. If households’ choice sets are distorted by the recommendations
33:1025:76804:22:22:99:510:119:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:provided by real estate agents, this can have important implications for how we interpret
33:1026:76893:22:0:99:510:97:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the results of non-market valuation analyses and for how perceived preferences are used
34:1027:76982:0:22:99:510:702:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:to allocate public goods. Our results suggest that what might look on face value to be
34:1028:77068:22:22:99:510:680:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:weak preferences for environmental quality on the part of minorities may actually be a
34:1029:77154:22:21:99:510:658:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:reflection of the fact that they were presented with options that were disproportionately
34:1030:77243:21:22:99:510:637:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:lower in environmental quality than were those given to similar white buyers. The results
34:1031:77332:22:22:99:510:615:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:of non-market valuation studies based on supposedly unconstrained choices over housing
34:1032:77418:22:22:99:510:593:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:units are the backbone of cost-benefit analyses and evaluation of environmental policies
34:1033:77506:22:21:99:510:571:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:in the US. They also play a critical role in determining how governments allocate scarce
34:1034:77594:21:22:99:380:550:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:funds to the provision of public services across communities.
34:1035:77655:22:22:115:510:528:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, our results provide evidence that even holding income disparities or di↵erences
34:1036:77743:22:22:99:510:506:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:in preferences constant, housing discrimination could play an important role in determin-
34:1037:77832:22:22:99:510:484:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:ing observed spatial correlations between race, income, and local disamenities. This has
34:1038:77920:22:21:99:510:462:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:particularly important implications considering pollution, and policies relating to envi-
34:1039:78009:21:22:99:510:441:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:ronmental justice. Under an executive order signed by Bill Clinton in 1994, the federal
34:1040:78096:22:22:99:510:419:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:government is obligated to consider the distributional impacts of its policies with respect
34:1041:78187:22:22:99:510:397:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:to pollution and disadvantaged groups. Understanding the origins of existing inequities
34:1042:78274:22:22:99:510:375:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:has been the topic of a large and growing literature (Banzhaf et al.,2018). Discrimination
34:1043:78364:22:21:99:510:353:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:has largely been overlooked by that literature, and our paper suggests that this may be
34:1044:78451:21:22:99:510:332:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:an important oversight. This particular mechanism has important implications for the
34:1045:78535:22:22:99:254:310:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:development of fair housing laws.
34:1046:78568:22:22:115:511:288:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:While we are able to identify the di↵erential impacts of real estate agents on the
34:1047:78650:22:21:99:510:266:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:housing search processes of whites and minorities, we note that the HUD audit data
34:1048:78732:21:22:99:510:245:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:do not allow for direct tests of the behavioral mechanisms underlying these e↵ects. We
34:1049:78818:22:22:99:511:223:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:find that the di↵erential constraints imposed by agents occur irrespective of preferences
34:1050:78907:22:22:99:510:201:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:demonstrated by testers in the form of their “choice” of advertised house, though we
34:1051:78991:22:22:99:510:179:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:cannot disentangle mechanisms based on statistical discrimination from others based on,
34:1052:79078:22:21:99:510:157:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:for example, racial animus or disregarding financial credentials. We propose an expanded
34:1053:79166:21:22:99:510:136:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:research agenda in the economics of housing discrimination, including complementary
34:1054:79249:22:22:99:510:114:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:experimental designs that are capable of more directly testing the behavioral mechanisms
34:1055:79337:22:0:99:511:92:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:underlying discriminatory steering as inKnowles et al.(2001),List(2004), andCharles
35:1056:79422:0:22:99:191:702:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:and Guryan(2008).
35:1057:79439:22:22:115:510:680:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:A:Perhaps an even more important avenue for experimental research involves the design
35:1058:79522:22:21:99:510:658:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:of a research methodology that combines experimental identification of discriminatory
35:1059:79607:21:22:99:510:637:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:behavior with individual preferences that are representative of decisions being made in
35:1060:79694:22:22:99:510:615:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:the housing market. These could be used to obtain precise estimates of welfare e↵ects. An
35:1061:79783:22:22:99:510:593:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:important remaining question is the extent to which the constraints from discriminatory
35:1062:79870:22:21:99:510:571:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:steering may be overcome by tenacity – buyers with a su-ciently high marginal utility
35:1063:79955:21:22:99:510:550:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:for certain housing characteristics may choose to absorb additional search costs in order
35:1064:80044:22:22:99:510:528:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:to expand their choice set.  Unfortunately, studying this aspect is not possible in the
35:1065:80131:22:22:99:510:506:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:audit study context. Neither is a study of the mortgage lending process, where we might
35:1066:80218:22:0:99:443:484:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f3:B:expect the sorts of discriminatory e↵ects we identify here to be amplified.
