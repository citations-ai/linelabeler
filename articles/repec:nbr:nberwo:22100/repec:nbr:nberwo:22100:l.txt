2:36:2081:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:This  study  offers  a  single,  consistent  model  that  tracks  the  velocity  of  broad  money  (M2)  since 
2:37:2192:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:1929, including  the  Great  Depression,  the  global  financial  crisis,  and  the  Great  Recession.  The 
2:38:2299:14:14:72:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:model emphasizes the roles of changes in uncertainty and risk premia, financial innovation, and 
2:39:2394:14:14:72:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:major  banking  regulations. Our  findings  suggest  an  enhanced  role  of  a  broad,  liquid  money 
2:40:2495:14:14:72:548:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:aggregate  as  a  policy  guide  during crises  and  their  unwinding.  Following  crises,  policymakers  
2:41:2600:14:14:72:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:face the challenge of not only unwinding their balance sheet so as to prevent excess reserves from 
2:42:2698:14:14:72:546:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:fueling a surge in M2, but also countering a fall in the demand for money as risk premia return to 
2:43:2796:14:42:72:410:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:normal amid velocity shifts stemming from relevant financial reforms.

3:61:3211:0:27:72:152:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:1. Introduction 
3:62:3226:27:27:72:543:681:144:Times:144:Times:B: The  Great  Depression  and  the  Great  Recession  are  acknowledged  as  the defining 
3:63:3314:27:28:72:540:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:American  financial  crises  of  the  past  century.1  At  least  since  Bagehot,  it  has  been  well-
3:64:3417:28:28:72:547:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:understood   that   financial   crises   require   aggressive   central   bank   intervention.   Crises   are   
3:65:3529:28:27:72:539:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:accompanied  by  two  mutually  self-reinforcing  factors  that  reduce  economic  activity,  flights-to-
3:66:3634:27:28:72:543:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:liquidity  and  increases  in  risk  premia.  Both are evidenced  by  increased  demand  for  safe  assets,  
3:67:3743:28:28:72:549:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:including   government   bonds,   central   bank   liabilities,   and   government-insured   financial   
3:68:3848:28:27:72:543:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:institution liabilities. A central bank typically responds by expanding its balance sheet via asset 
3:69:3948:27:28:72:545:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:purchases  and/or  lending.  When  the  crisis  passes,  the  central  bank’s  task  is  to  remove  excess  
3:70:4057:28:27:72:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:liquidity by shrinking its balance sheet at an appropriate pace, a task made difficult by portfolio 
3:71:4157:27:28:72:544:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:shifts away from low-yielding highly liquid assets and reversion of risk premia to more normal 
3:72:4252:28:28:72:516:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:levels. A clear dynamic model that tracks past crises can be a useful guide for such policies. 
3:73:4346:28:27:108:543:377:144:Times:144:Times:A:This paper contributes a dynamic empirical model of the demand for broad, liquid money 
3:74:4433:27:28:72:540:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:that  well-fits  the  two  preeminent  American  financial  crises  of  the  past  century,  and  also  well-
3:75:4542:28:27:72:543:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:tracks the behavior  of  broad  money  during the  years  between  crises,  including  the  early-2000s 
3:76:4646:27:28:72:548:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:period   of   “missing   money.”   The   analysis,   by   treating   carefully   innovations   in   financial   
3:77:4758:28:28:72:540:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:intermediation  and  time-variation  in  financial-asset  risk  premia,  makes  visible  a  dynamic,  non-
3:78:4864:28:27:72:546:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:linear  interaction in  which  lower  transaction  costs  (particularly  for  bond  and  equity  mutual  
3:79:4969:27:28:72:491:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:funds) encourage more rapid portfolio rebalancing in response to shifting risk premia.2 
3:80:5056:28:27:108:543:184:144:Times:144:Times:A:Technically, our analysis extends,  to early historical periods,  the models of broad money 
3:81:5147:27:25:72:543:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:demand  developed  by  Anderson  and  Duca  (2013)  that,  by  permitting  velocity  to  respond to

3:83:5295:7:12:72:426:125:42:Times:99:Times:F:1 In a related paper, Bordo and Haubrich (2012) discuss other American financial crises. 
3:84:5383:12:16:72:542:113:42:Times:99:Times:F:2 Two assets are “extremely close” as media of exchange if the transaction cost of exchanging one for the other is de 
3:85:5501:16:11:72:542:97:99:Times:99:Times:F:minimis. By explicitly measuring the economically meaningful “distance” between assets with out-of-pocket costs, 
3:86:5614:11:12:71:543:86:99:Times:99:Times:F:we  reject  the  assertion  that  this  distance  is  well-measured  by  differences  in  assets’  market  yields  (e.g.,  Barnett,  
3:87:5747:12:0:71:99:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:1980). 
4:88:5755:0:28:72:542:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher  uncertainty  during  crisis  periods  and later  revert  to  normal  levels,  reconcile the low 
4:89:5859:28:27:72:545:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:inflation,  weak  nominal  income  growth,  and  moderately  robust  broad  money  growth of  the  
4:90:5958:27:28:72:544:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:recent  economic  recovery.3    To include  the  Great  Depression,  we  extend  estimates  of  mutual  
4:91:6062:28:28:72:543:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:fund costs back to the 1920s and develop pre-WWII measures of own rates of return for M2. By 
4:92:6155:28:27:72:545:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:also  controlling  for  shifts  in  risk  premia  and  relevant  financial  innovations,  our  framework  
4:93:6261:27:28:72:544:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:provides a statistically sound and internally consistent way of modeling money demand in both 
4:94:6355:28:28:72:545:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  short-  and  long-runs.    The  quality  of  our  results  is  illustrated  in Figure 1  by  our  model’s

4:99:6581:12:12:72:542:120:99:Times:99:Times:F:   3 By inducing shifts in the neutral Wicksellian real rate, financial innovations and frictions pose serious challenges 
4:100:6703:12:11:72:543:108:99:Times:99:Times:F:for gauging monetary policy with the Taylor-Rule.  Indeed, Barsky, Justiniano, and Melosi (2014) estimate that the 
4:101:6818:11:11:72:542:97:99:Times:99:Times:F:neutral real rate has varied in a 7 ½ percent range since 1990.  Tracking real interest rates also entails the difficulty 
4:102:6940:11:12:71:511:86:99:Times:99:Times:F:of measuring inflation expectations since the 1930s (Jalil and Rua, 2015), which our framework circumvents. 
4:103:7047:12:0:71:521:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:   4 Figure 3 and our models use various controls to address money demand shifts associated with World War II.

5:125:7554:0:28:108:542:709:144:Times:144:Times:A:History  shows  that  money  demand  retreats  in  response  to  falling  risk  premia  and 
5:126:7646:28:27:71:544:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:increasing opportunity costs vis-à-vis bond yields. Resulting increases in velocity amplify broad

5:135:8444:27:28:108:542:433:144:Times:144:Times:A:To establish these and other results, this study is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews 
5:136:8536:28:28:72:542:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:the impact of earlier crises on risk premia and money demand, emphasizing the Great Depression 
5:137:8631:28:27:72:545:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:and  the  Great  Recession.  Section  3  reviews  previous  studies  of  money  demand.  Section  4  
5:138:8732:27:28:72:542:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:discusses  the  specification  of  our  empirical  model,  and  Section  5,   the variables  we  use to 
5:139:8836:28:27:72:544:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:measure  mutual  fund  loads  and  market  risk  premia.  Section  6 presents  our  estimated  dynamic  
5:140:8940:27:28:72:545:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:error  correction  model  and  some  simulations  of  velocity  and  nominal  GDP.  Section  7  draws  
5:141:9043:28:28:72:166:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:some conclusions.

5:143:9062:27:28:72:375:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:2. Disruptions of Financial Markets Circa Financial Crises 
5:144:9120:28:27:108:543:184:144:Times:144:Times:A:Risk premia and the velocity of broad money change rapidly and by large amounts circa 
5:145:9205:27:28:72:545:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:crises. Impacts  of  the  Great  Depression  and  the  Great  Recession  are  evident  in  risk  premia,  
5:146:9311:28:31:72:544:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:measured  as  the  spread  between  yields  on  Baa  corporate  bonds  and  10-year  Treasury  bonds  
5:147:9413:31:8:108:255:98:144:Times:144:Times:A:                                                 
5:148:9461:8:16:72:543:90:42:Times:99:Times:F:5 The FOMC voted to maintain its asset holdings at the then-current level by rolling over maturing Treasuries into 
5:149:9576:16:0:72:511:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:new issues and reinvesting principal payments on agency debt and mortgage securities into similar securities. 
6:150:9687:0:28:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Figure 2) and in velocity (Figure 3). As the Great Depression abated, for example, risk premia 
6:151:9783:28:27:71:544:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:fell and  velocity  returned  to  more  typical  levels.  More  recently,  from  year-end  2006  to  2014,  
6:152:9891:27:28:71:544:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:broad  money  growth,  nominal  GDP  growth,  and  inflation  (GDP  chain  price  index)  increased,  
6:153:9993:28:28:71:539:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:respectively, at 6.5, 2.9, and 1.6 percent annual rates. The pace of broad money growth, albeit 6 -
6:154:10092:28:27:71:543:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:1/2 percent, has accompanied relatively low nominal GDP growth and inflation.  6 Many factors 
6:155:10186:27:28:71:542:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:contributed to this outcome, including increased banking regulation, flight-to-quality effects, the 
6:156:10286:28:28:72:546:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:expansion  of  bank  reserves,  and  a  plunge  in  the  money  multiplier  reflecting,  as  emphasized  by  
6:157:10395:28:27:72:544:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:Brunner  and  Meltzer  (1966),  both  the  lending  activity  of  banks  and  the  demand  by  households  
6:158:10502:27:28:72:543:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:and firms to hold deposits at banks.  Combining these factors, we attribute the decrease in broad 
6:159:10600:28:27:72:545:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:money  velocity  to  heightened  risk  premia  and  a  decreasing  opportunity  cost  of  broad  money  
6:160:10704:27:28:72:168:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:relative to bonds.7   
6:161:10726:28:28:108:543:405:144:Times:144:Times:A:While  the  historical  paths  of  inflation/deflation  and  unemployment  (Figures  4 and 5) 
6:162:10820:28:27:71:547:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggest  that  Federal  Reserve  performed  better  in  preventing  deflation  and  quelling  high  
6:163:10920:27:28:71:544:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:unemployment  during  the  Great  Recession  than  in  the  Great  Depression,  high  unemployment  
6:164:11020:28:27:71:545:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:from  2008  to  2012  suggests  a  shortfall  in  meeting  the  full  employment  objective  part  of  the  
6:165:11128:27:28:71:546:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:Federal  Reserve’s  dual  mandate.    Indeed,  despite  the  Federal  Reserve’s  efforts,  the  Great  
6:166:11231:28:28:71:543:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:Recession has seen  a shortfall in nominal demand (Figure 6) even though M2 increased solidly 
6:167:11325:28:27:71:544:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:during  the  Great  Recession  (except  for  2010)  while  contracting  dramatically  during  the  Great  
6:168:11431:27:28:71:544:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:Depression  (Figure  7).  At  first  pass,  robust  M2  growth  during  the  recent  crisis  suggests  that  
6:169:11540:28:27:71:544:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:monetary  policy  provided  adequate  liquidity.  Such  an  inference,  however,  requires  comparing  
6:170:11643:27:28:71:545:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:money demand with  money  supply:  in  crises,  the  demand  for  liquidity—such  as  for  the  safe  
6:171:11744:28:20:71:186:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:assets in M2—surges.

6:173:11814:7:12:72:541:102:42:Times:99:Times:F:6 Some (e.g., Svensson, 2009) argue that the recovery will remain slow so long as broad money growth is not strong. 
6:174:11930:12:16:72:544:90:42:Times:99:Times:F:7  Friedman  and  Schwartz  (1963)  also  emphasize  the  Fed’s  failure  to  protect  the  stability  of  the  financial  system,  
6:175:12062:16:0:71:298:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:something which the Bernanke-led Fed largely avoided.

10:284:14153:0:28:108:544:709:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our  analytical  framework  illustrates  both  differences  and  similarities  between  the  Great  
10:285:14253:28:27:72:547:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:Depression  and  the  Great  Recession,  as  highlighted  in  Figures  2  and  3.  Financial  crises  
10:286:14355:27:28:72:539:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:understandably increase risk premia, affecting money demand. Measured by the spread between  
10:287:14447:28:28:72:539:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:the yields on Baa-rated corporate bonds and 10-year Treasuries (Figure 2), risk premia peaked in 
10:288:14543:28:27:72:543:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:1932 and 2009 for the Great Depression and Great Recession, respectively. Perhaps surprisingly, 
10:289:14639:27:28:72:543:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:measured risk premia retreated more rapidly during the Depression: 1929’s premia was rejoined 
10:290:14733:28:28:71:542:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:by  1935,  while  year-end  2013  risk  premia  remain  above  pre-crisis  lows,  albeit  near  2002-2003 
10:291:14839:28:27:72:546:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:levels.  Our  empirical  results  suggest  an  important  explanatory  role  of  this  premia  for  the  
10:292:14944:27:28:72:544:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:behavior  of  velocity  before  and  after  the  crises  (Figure  3).  In  the  Depression,  velocity  rapidly  
10:293:15056:28:27:72:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:regained its earlier level following stabilization of the banking system; in the Great Recession, it 
10:294:15157:27:28:72:544:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:has  not.  Both  crises  were  followed  by  extensive  bank  regulatory  reform—judging  the  relative  
10:295:15262:28:28:72:544:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:impacts of the reforms on velocity is difficult. In Figure 3, for example, we show for the Great 
10:296:15359:28:27:72:543:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:Recession both the actual path of M2 velocity and a counterfactual path based on an estimate of 
10:297:15455:27:28:72:543:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:the Dodd-Frank Act’s pressure to shift credit provision back into the formal banking sector from 
10:298:15552:28:27:72:544:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  shadow  banking  system  (Duca,  2014).  Because  the  latter  derives  much  of  its  funding  from  
10:299:15659:27:28:72:543:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:M2  components,  these  provisions  tended  to  lower  M2  velocity,  consistent  with  the  view 
10:300:15756:28:28:72:543:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:emphasized by Bordo and Jonung (1987, 1990, 2004) that major changes in financial institutions 
10:301:15851:28:27:72:544:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:critically  affect  money  demand.    As  a  result,  there  are  difficulties  with  disentangling  financial  
10:302:15963:27:28:72:546:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:reform  from  risk  premia  effects  in  the  current  environment. Estimation  of  these  effects  is  
10:303:16067:28:27:72:195:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:discussed further below.  
10:304:16092:27:28:108:543:157:144:Times:144:Times:A:In  both  periods,  an  initial  fall  in  M2  velocity  exceeded  amounts  implied by historical 
10:305:16190:28:28:72:542:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:changes  in  income  and  interest  rates.  Later,  in  the  mid-1930s,  velocity rose and  stabilized  as 
10:306:16297:28:0:72:543:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:uncertainty  ebbed,  as  Friedman  and  Schwartz  (1963)  note.   Velocity fell  late  in  World War II 
11:307:16403:0:28:72:544:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:likely due, in part, to fear of a post-war collapse similar to that after World War I and to forced 
11:308:16503:28:27:72:542:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:saving   from goods-rationing   (Rockoff,    1981).   More   recently,   the higher   uncertainty that 
11:309:16606:27:28:72:544:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:accompanied the  onset  of  the  Great  Recession  induced  a  rise  in money  demand  and  drop  in  
11:310:16708:28:28:72:119:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:velocity.

11:314:16864:28:27:72:545:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:demand.    Traditionally, studies  regarding  the  demand  for  broad  money  in  the  United  States  
11:315:16967:27:28:72:545:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:asserted  or  assumed  that  the  effects  of  increasing  financial  sophistication  and  innovation  are  
11:316:17075:28:27:72:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:well-captured either within either the definition of a broad money aggregate (as reconstructed for 
11:317:17174:27:28:72:543:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:earlier periods using contemporary definitions) or the path of nominal (or real) income. Although 
11:318:17272:28:28:72:543:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:the importance of financial innovation was acknowledged, its effects often were addressed only 
11:319:17366:28:27:72:543:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:via exogenous dummy variables. “Breakdowns” in empirical money demand relationships, most 
11:320:17456:27:28:72:339:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:often, were traced to the inadequacy of such variables.  
11:321:17513:28:27:71:544:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:  The literature on the role of financial innovation is vast. Well before the recent financial 
11:322:17608:27:28:72:545:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:crisis,  Ford  and  Mullineux  (1996)  ably summarized  the  issues  both  for  money  demand  and  
11:323:17708:28:28:72:201:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:financial market stability:  
11:324:17737:28:13:72:525:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:“The  recent  decades,  and  more  particularly  the  last  two,  have  seen  the  most  substantial 
11:325:17837:13:14:72:527:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:evolution,  maybe  we  should  say  revolution,  in  the  financial  and  monetary  sectors  of  the  
11:326:17939:14:14:72:525:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:developed nations of the world. In the financial sector in the broad sense, many new types of 
11:327:18033:14:14:72:528:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:financial  claims  (both  assets  and  liabilities)  have  emerged.  Some  of  these  claims  have  
11:328:18133:14:14:72:526:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:appeared  in  what  we  might  strictly  call  the  banking  sector.  [Others]  have  arisen  because  of  
11:329:18240:14:13:72:529:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:attempts  to  insure  against  the  uncertainty  in  financial  markets,  which  has  become  an  
11:330:18338:13:14:72:526:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:increasingly important feature of the global economic scene. The volatility that has occurred 
11:331:18432:14:14:72:527:143:144:Times:144:Times:B:in  those  markets  probably  owes  a  significant  part  of  its  existence  to  the  integration,  and  
11:332:18538:14:14:71:519:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:liberalization, of markets that have been dominant phenomena in many western economics.”

12:340:19075:14:14:72:525:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:States, deregulation, financial innovation, and other factors have led to recurrent instability in

12:342:19256:13:14:72:524:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:...the rapid pace of financial innovation in the United States has been an important reason for 
12:343:19352:14:14:72:527:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  instability  of  the  relationships  between  monetary  aggregates  and  other  macroeconomic  
12:344:19452:14:14:72:527:557:144:Times:144:Times:B:variables.  In  response  to  regulatory  changes  and  technological  progress,  U.S.  banks  have  
12:345:19553:14:14:72:528:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:created  new  kinds  of  accounts  and  added  features  to  existing  accounts.  More  broadly,  
12:346:19651:14:13:72:526:529:144:Times:144:Times:B:payments  technologies  and  practices  have  changed  substantially  over  the  past  few  decades,  
12:347:19753:13:14:72:528:516:144:Times:144:Times:B:and  innovations  (such  as  Internet  banking)  continue.  As  a  result,  patterns  of  usage  of  
12:348:19854:14:14:72:494:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:different types of transactions accounts have at times shifted rapidly and unpredictably.

12:353:20103:14:28:72:544:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:Historically, the  economic  function  of  financial  innovation  has  been  to  increase  the  liquidity  of  
12:354:20214:28:27:72:543:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:otherwise less-liquid assets, i.e., to reduce the transaction costs of converting assets that are not 
12:355:20316:27:28:72:543:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:medium-of-exchange  into  medium-of-exchange  (e.g.,  Hasbrouck,  2009).  Some  such  innovation  
12:356:20414:28:28:72:544:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:has  occurred  with  the  regulated,  chartered  banks.  But  innovation  also  has  occurred  elsewhere,  
12:357:20521:28:27:72:543:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:most notably in the mutual fund industry, where the costs of transferring assets into mutual fund 
12:358:20619:27:28:72:545:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:accounts have plunged, prompting greater stock ownership rates among middle-income families.   
12:359:20714:28:27:72:544:267:144:Times:144:Times:B: We  focus  this  study  on  the  broad  monetary  aggregate,  M2.    Previous  long-run  money  
12:360:20810:27:28:72:543:240:144:Times:144:Times:B:demand studies,  focused  on  the  transactions  motive  for  money  demand,  generally  have  used 
12:361:20909:28:28:72:543:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:M1.9 Friedman and Schwartz (1970), however, argue that data availability supports only a broad 
12:362:21004:28:17:72:545:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:money  aggregate  for  long-run  studies.  They  note  that  prior  to  the mid-1930s  there  was  little

12:364:21159:12:12:72:544:155:99:Times:99:Times:F:   8  Bernanke  (2006)  notes  that  the  Federal  Reserve  Board’s  P*  model  (Hallman,  Porter  and  Small,  1991)  was  
12:365:21283:12:12:72:542:143:99:Times:99:Times:F:developed to predict long-run inflation using long-run potential output and velocity. This model’s performance can 
12:366:21398:12:11:72:543:131:99:Times:99:Times:F:be improved by accounting for financial innovation, specifically, the decreasing transaction cost and increasing use 
12:367:21515:11:12:72:543:120:99:Times:99:Times:F:of bond mutual funds; see Brecsi and Duca (1994). Judson, Schlusche, and Wong (2014)  update the 1988 Federal 
12:368:21625:12:11:72:543:108:99:Times:99:Times:F:Reserve Board M2 demand model (Moore, Porter and Small, 1990)  and  conclude that the model works well, with 
12:369:21734:11:7:72:515:97:99:Times:99:Times:F:minor adjustments, from 1959-2011, when the period during which it performs poorly (1990-1993) is omitted. 
12:370:21840:7:16:72:542:90:42:Times:99:Times:F:9 Although there are a number of previous studies of long-run U.S. money demand, most such studies have used M1, 
12:371:21953:16:0:71:515:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:not a broad monetary aggregate, e.g., Wang (2011), Lucas (1988), Stock and Watson (1993), and Ball (2001).

13:374:22264:27:28:72:544:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:important during  the  1930s  when  regulatory  changes introduced statutory  reserve  requirements

13:379:22766:27:28:72:543:516:144:Times:144:Times:B:the former tending to increase velocity and the latter to reduce it. Bordo and Jonung (1987, 1990, 
13:380:22865:28:28:71:544:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:2004)  examine the  period  1880 to 2000,  and  Bordo,  Jonung,  and  Siklos  (1997)  examine  the

13:384:23245:28:27:72:544:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:empirical  analyses.  Financial  crises  are  the  major focus  of  our  analysis.  Wars,  however,  are  
13:385:23351:27:28:72:545:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:nuisance  parameters  that  cannot  be  ignored. During  our  sample  period,  only  World  War  II  
13:386:23452:28:27:72:543:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:appears  to  have  affected  money  demand  by  distorting  consumption,  saving,  and  asset  holding. 
13:387:23556:27:28:72:543:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:Velocity rose rapidly early in the war, thereafter declining steadily but slowly during 1944-46.11

13:391:23906:12:12:72:543:189:99:Times:99:Times:F:   10 Friedman and Schwartz (1982) note that the deposit figures for 1867 through 1946 are theirs, and for currency 
13:392:24022:12:11:71:544:177:99:Times:99:Times:F:through  1942.  Thereafter  they  use  Federal  Reserve  figures.  Subsequent  changes  in  the  definition  of  M2  make  
13:393:24145:11:11:71:542:166:99:Times:99:Times:F:untenable using exactly the same figures. Our figures for 1946 to 1958 are from Rasche (1992); earlier data are from 
13:394:24262:11:12:71:542:155:99:Times:99:Times:F:Friedman  and  Schwartz.  See  Anderson  (2003).    We  avoid  Friedman  and  Schwartz’s  difficulties  regarding  income  
13:395:24385:12:12:71:542:143:99:Times:99:Times:F:and prices by using annual data and currently published Department of Commerce figures beginning in 1929. Also, 
13:396:24497:12:11:71:524:131:99:Times:99:Times:F:we use standard time-series methods, not the “reference phase” statistical framework of Friedman and Schwartz. 
13:397:24607:11:12:71:467:120:99:Times:99:Times:F:   11 In contrast, velocity fell during most of WW I.  See Friedman and Schwartz (1982), chapter 5. 
13:398:24706:12:11:72:543:108:99:Times:99:Times:F:   12  Friedman  and  Schwartz  (1982,  pp.  101-2)  argue  that  wartime  real  output  is  overstated  because  “price  control  
13:399:24837:11:11:71:542:97:99:Times:99:Times:F:meant that price increases took indirect and concealed forms not recorded in the indexes” and that “the large rise in 
13:400:24955:11:12:71:543:86:99:Times:99:Times:F:price  indexes  when  price  control  was  repealed  in  1946  consisted  largely  of  an  unveiling  of  the  earlier  concealed  
13:401:25086:12:0:71:544:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:increase.”  They  argue  that  “true”  average  prices  during  the  war  were  unobservable  because  some  transactions  
14:402:25212:0:28:72:544:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:spending  or  a  dummy  for  the  onset  and  lifting  of  price  controls  is  unlikely  to  fully  reflect  the  
14:403:25327:28:27:72:545:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:interaction  of  these  effects  and  the  expectations  impacts  arising  from  them.    Also,  including  
14:404:25435:27:28:72:544:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:direct  measures  of  defense  spending  raises  simultaneity issues.    Accordingly,  we  add  separate  
14:405:25541:28:28:72:543:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:yearly  dummies  for  1941-46  to  control  for  the  time-varying  impact  of  WWII  and  to  prevent  it

14:409:25726:28:27:108:547:515:144:Times:144:Times:A:The  canonical  model  of  the  demand  for  broad,  liquid  money,  as  developed  during  the    
14:410:25825:27:28:72:543:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:1980s, represented velocity as a function of its opportunity cost, often measured as the difference 
14:411:25925:28:27:72:539:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:between money’s own rate of return and a short-term default risk-free market yield (e.g., 3- or 6-
14:412:26023:27:28:72:543:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:month Treasury bill yield). Among other things, these models hinged on conclusions that (i) the 
14:413:26119:28:28:72:543:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:income elasticity of broad money demand was unity,  and (ii) the structure of risk premia (across 
14:414:26217:28:27:72:544:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:ris  ky  assets)  was  (largely)  temporally  stable  (that  is,  not  highly time-dependent),  and  (iii)  the  
14:415:26330:27:92:72:543:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects   of   financial   innovations   were   encapsulated   within   the   broad   money   aggregate.15 
14:416:26436:92:12:108:579:258:144:Times:144:Times:A:                                                                                                                                                             
14:417:26592:12:11:72:545:246:99:Times:99:Times:F:occurred  above  controlled  prices  and  others  were  black  market  transactions.  As  noted  above,  Friedman  and  
14:418:26712:11:11:72:544:235:99:Times:99:Times:F:Schwartz  (1982,  chapter  4)  develop  a  method  of  adjustment  that  replaces  observed  prices  during  1943-46,  and  
14:419:26836:11:12:72:543:224:99:Times:99:Times:F:hence,  changes  measured  real  output.  They  note  that,  because  of  the  “different  economic  circumstances”  during  
14:420:26961:12:12:72:543:212:99:Times:99:Times:F:World Wars I and II, they often present separate results calculated with and without the war years. They also make 
14:421:27076:12:11:72:331:200:99:Times:99:Times:F:data adjustments for the price control period 1971 Q3 -1973 Q3. 
14:422:27139:11:12:72:543:189:99:Times:99:Times:F:   13  A  reasonable  person  might  disagree,  arguing  that  the  measured  prices  are  accurate  but,  due  to  rationing,  the  
14:423:27272:12:11:72:542:177:99:Times:99:Times:F:measured prices were not market-clearing and the 1946 increase reflected only an adjustment to those prices. As an 
14:424:27387:11:11:72:542:166:99:Times:99:Times:F:adjustment to published data, they argue that measured nominal income likely was less distorted by illegal activity 
14:425:27503:11:12:72:544:155:99:Times:99:Times:F:than  measured  prices,  and  use  the  method  of  interpolation-by-related-series  (interpolating  the  price  index  by  net  
14:426:27632:12:12:72:543:143:99:Times:99:Times:F:national  product)  to  construct  replacement  values  for  the  price  index  during  1943-46. Although  elegant,  we  do  not  
14:427:27762:12:11:72:545:131:99:Times:99:Times:F:pursue  the  Friedman  and  Schwartz  adjustment.  Friedman  and  Schwartz  (1982),  pp.  104-105,  make  a  similar  
14:428:27880:11:12:72:513:120:99:Times:99:Times:F:adjustment for the 1971-74 price controls. For the reasons stated above, we do not make such an adjustment.   
14:429:27989:12:11:72:543:108:99:Times:99:Times:F:   14 The effect of the dummy variables, of course, is to set the residuals for these periods to zero, thereby removing 
14:430:28109:11:11:71:299:97:99:Times:99:Times:F:their influence in estimating the equation’s coefficients.  
14:431:28169:11:12:71:543:86:99:Times:99:Times:F:  15  This  practice,  at  times,  resulted  in  large  numbers  of  “monetary  aggregates,”  M1,  M2,  M3,  M4  M5,  M6,  etc.  
14:432:28298:12:0:72:511:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:Some financial innovation is not subsumed in the aggregate. We include these explicitly in the model, below. 
15:433:28409:0:28:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:Combined, these conditions suggested that both the opportunity cost of M2 and its velocity were 
15:434:28504:28:29:72:463:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:mean-reverting.16 The long-run equilibrium for such a model might be written as

15:438:28881:29:33:71:543:559:144:Times:144:Times:B:a  short-term,  default  risk-free  money  market  instrument).   In  long-run  equilibrium,  2*2tVV=

15:446:29381:28:28:72:540:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:portfolio substitution, as it affects M2 holdings, is between liquid broad money (M2) and short-
15:447:29477:28:27:72:545:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:term  government  debt.  Such  a  specification  likely  was  defensible  until  the  late  1980s;  see  
15:448:29582:27:28:72:543:313:144:Times:144:Times:B:Friedman and Schwartz (1982), Lucas (1988), Meltzer (1998), Moore, Porter and Small (1990),

15:450:29777:28:27:72:543:257:144:Times:144:Times:B:recently Judson, et al.  (2014). The accompanying short-run dynamic model, aside from dummy 
15:451:29869:27:28:72:544:230:144:Times:144:Times:B:variables  for  special  events,  then  necessarily  asserts  that changes  in  V2  reflected  changes  in  
15:452:29977:28:27:72:204:202:144:Times:144:Times:B:money’s opportunity cost.  
15:453:30004:27:28:72:543:175:144:Times:144:Times:B:  E mpirical difficulties with this framework became apparent in the early 1990s, when an 
15:454:30093:28:38:72:543:147:144:Times:144:Times:B:episode  of  unexpectedly  high  velocity  became  known  as  the  period  of  “missing”  M2.17  Almost

15:456:30245:12:11:72:544:97:99:Times:99:Times:F:  16  This  argument  is  not  wholly  original.  See  Moore,  Porter  and  Small  (1990)  and  Hallman,  Porter  and  Small  
15:457:30371:11:12:72:103:86:99:Times:99:Times:F:(1991). 
15:458:30378:12:0:71:336:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:  17 See for example Carlson, Hoffman, Keen, and Rasche (2000). 
16:459:30444:0:28:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:immediately,   suspicion  fell  on  two  omitted  variables:  (i)  financial innovation, and (ii)  sharp 
16:460:30548:28:27:72:544:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:swings  in  risk  premia.  Although  broad  M2  had  successfully  incorporated within  itself  many  
16:461:30650:27:28:72:542:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:innovations that affected depository institution liabilities, financial innovation now was reducing 
16:462:30750:28:28:72:543:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:the cost  of  asset  exchanges  between  M2 and  liquid  money  market instruments,  including  raw 
16:463:30850:28:27:71:543:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:bonds  and  equities, and  bond  and  equity  mutual  funds.18    Initially, this effect revealed itself 
16:464:30955:27:28:72:543:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:empirically  as  time  variation  in  the  elasticity  of  substitution  between M2  and  alternative  assets  
16:465:31066:28:28:71:544:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Duca,  2000),  and  was most  pronounced  for  small-denomination time  deposits  (Carlson,  et  al.,  
16:466:31170:28:27:72:542:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:2000).19 Experiments to “repair” the problem included narrowing the definition of M2 to exclude 
16:467:31266:27:28:72:542:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:small-denomination time  deposits,  so-called  “M2  minus”  (e.g., Carlson,  et  al.,  2000)  and 
16:468:31364:28:27:71:544:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:broadening  the  definition  to  include  additional  liquid  assets,  such  as  bond funds,  so-called  M2  
16:469:31473:27:28:71:222:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:plus” (Besci and Duca, 1994).  
16:470:31504:28:28:107:543:405:144:Times:144:Times:A:Clever ad  hoc  efforts to  repair  M2  demand  models  by  redefining  M2  were  ultimately 
16:471:31596:28:27:71:549:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:unsuccessful.   A  more  satisfactory  approach  is  to  explicitly  model  the  changing  margin  of  
16:472:31699:27:28:71:547:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:substitution between M2 and alternatives.  The  increased  holding  by  households  of  mutual  
16:473:31794:28:27:72:542:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:funds  is  the  most  important—and most  neglected—financial  innovation  of  recent  decades. 
16:474:31890:27:28:72:543:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:Mutual funds are the main vehicle for most households to feasibly own a diversified portfolio of 
16:475:31987:28:28:72:546:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:stock and bonds. Moreover, mutual fund transaction costs are proportional, not fixed—precisely  
16:476:32083:28:27:72:544:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  type  of  cost  that Brunner  and  Meltzer  (1967)  had  noted  was  most  likely  to  affect  portfolio  
16:477:32194:27:28:72:544:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:behavior and, hence, money velocity. Duca (2000) was among the first to include such costs in 
16:478:32288:28:27:71:543:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:an  empirical  model,  arguing  that  omitting  the  switching  costs  between  M2  and  its  alternatives  
16:479:32396:27:25:71:344:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:induced an omitted variable bias in M2 demand models,

16:481:32498:12:12:72:542:120:99:Times:99:Times:F:  18We are not the first to mention financial innovation as a culprit. As noted above, Friedman and Schwartz (1982) 
16:482:32614:12:11:71:542:108:99:Times:99:Times:F:mention it throughout their analysis, often combined with the hope that omitting measures of innovation from their 
16:483:32729:11:11:71:531:97:99:Times:99:Times:F:equations does little harm. Bordo and Jonung (1987, 2004) stress financial sophistication, which is closely related.

16:485:32978:12:0:71:430:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:simply omit 1990-1993 from their regressions because the regressions do not fit the data.

17:490:33357:28:27:72:543:587:144:Times:144:Times:B:demand:  elementary  portfolio  theory  also  counsels  that  risk  premia  matter.  In  the  decades  prior  
17:491:33467:27:28:72:542:560:144:Times:144:Times:B:to the 1990s, risk premia moved within a small range; thereafter, relative to earlier decades, the 
17:492:33566:28:27:72:542:532:144:Times:144:Times:B:swings became increasingly  sharp.20 By reducing the predictability of asset prices, these swings 
17:493:33664:27:28:72:543:505:144:Times:144:Times:B:have  notably  altered  investors’  perceptions  of  the  liquidity  of  nonmonetary  assets,  including 
17:494:33769:28:28:72:544:477:144:Times:144:Times:B:stocks and bonds. The importance of time-variation in the risk premia’s  variance has long been 
17:495:33865:28:27:71:543:449:144:Times:144:Times:B:noted  by  monetary  theorists,  perhaps  most  prominently  Tobin  (1958),  who  emphasized  the 
17:496:33963:27:28:71:545:422:144:Times:144:Times:B:speculative  demand  for  money,   and Friedman  and  Schwartz  (1963, chapters  11  and  12),   who 
17:497:34064:28:27:71:543:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:noted the link between higher corporate bond risk premia and the fall in money velocity during 
17:498:34159:27:28:71:544:367:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  Great  Depression.    Empirical  attempts  to  model  such  effects  by including  variables  such  as  
17:499:34268:28:28:71:545:339:144:Times:144:Times:B:changes  in  stock  returns  met  with  mixed  success  (e.g., Hamburger,  1966, 1977; Carlson  and  
17:500:34369:28:27:71:543:311:144:Times:144:Times:B:Schwartz, 1999), most likely because the empirical relationship between money demand and risk 
17:501:34463:27:28:71:402:284:144:Times:144:Times:B:premia was neither sufficiently stable nor strong (e.g., Duca, 2000).  
17:502:34533:28:27:107:543:256:144:Times:144:Times:A:What  has  not  been  recognized,  prior  to  this  study,  is  that  the  omitted  variable  problem  
17:503:34636:27:28:71:542:229:144:Times:144:Times:B:hinges  on  the  interaction  between  financial  innovation  and  time-varying  risk  premia.  Financial 
17:504:34742:28:28:71:542:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:innovations  that  reduce asset trading costs  lower both the  cost  of  diversification  and that  of 
17:505:34844:28:27:71:543:173:144:Times:144:Times:B:hedging  risk. As predicted in Tobin’s  (1958) general equilibrium model, combined, these have 
17:506:34939:27:37:71:545:146:144:Times:144:Times:B:sharply altered underlying  portfolio  behavior  with  respect  to  how  risk  premia  affect  money

17:508:35089:12:11:72:542:97:99:Times:99:Times:F:  20 Most analysts seek to measure risk premia in equity markets. Unfortunately, the lack of an effective risk-free rate 
17:509:35210:11:12:71:542:86:99:Times:99:Times:F:makes  difficult  measurement  before  1925  (see  Goetzmann  and  Ibbotson,  2008).  In  more  recent  data,  survivorship 
17:510:35334:12:0:71:398:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:bias complicates precise measurement (see Brown, Goetzmann, and Ross, 1995). 
18:511:35413:0:28:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:demand: lower transaction costs reduce the costs incurred by investors as they response to shifts 
18:512:35511:28:27:72:543:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:in perceived risk. Moreover, smaller transaction  costs  narrow the “no-action zone” in inventory 
18:513:35609:27:28:72:545:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:models.21 Further, lower transaction costs raise the optimal size of each portfolio rebalancing,  for 
18:514:35711:28:28:71:542:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:a  given  size  change in  relative  returns  or  risk.  Among  such  events  are  “flight-to-quality” 
18:515:35814:28:27:71:123:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:dynamics. 
18:516:35823:27:28:107:543:571:144:Times:144:Times:A:Liu (2004) constructs a model in which fixed and proportional asset transfer costs affect 
18:517:35913:28:28:71:546:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  optimal  consumption  and  portfolio  behavior  of  households  with  constant  relative  risk  
18:518:36014:28:27:71:544:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:aversion,  and  concludes  that  portfolio  shares  reflect  differentials  in  pecuniary  yields  between  
18:519:36122:27:28:71:545:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:safe  and  risky  assets  (e.g.,  the  Treasury  yield  premium  or  a  corporate-Treasury  bond  yield  
18:520:36227:28:27:71:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:differential) scaled by proportional asset transfer costs in levels. More specifically, he finds that 
18:521:36329:27:28:71:547:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:portfolio   shares   approximately   reflect negative   linear   tradeoffs   between   expected   return   
18:522:36436:28:28:71:543:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:differentials and proportional asset transfer costs.  In log specifications, this implies that the logs 
18:523:36540:28:27:71:543:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:of a risk premium and an asset transfer cost series enter as separate factors determining long-run

18:529:36935:27:28:108:543:225:144:Times:144:Times:A:In  our  empirical  work,  we  cannot  reject the hypothesis  that  the  variables V2, load,

18:533:37321:12:12:71:543:120:99:Times:99:Times:F:sufficiently  large  to  warrant  incurring  the  transaction  costs.  The  width  of  this  zone  is  inversely  proportional  to  the  
18:534:37458:12:11:71:543:108:99:Times:99:Times:F:size of the transaction cost. As proportional transfer costs (such as mutual fund loads) decline, the zone of portfolio 
18:535:37578:11:11:71:543:97:99:Times:99:Times:F:inaction  narrows  (e.g.,  Davis  and  Norman,  1990;  Liu  and  Loewenstein,  2002;  Zakamouline,  2002).  The  models  
18:536:37699:11:12:71:542:86:99:Times:99:Times:F:imply that a decline in transaction costs (e.g, mutual fund loads) increases the likelihood that households will realign 
18:537:37820:12:0:71:499:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:portfolios in response to a given change in the relative risk or rates of return on money versus other assets. 
19:538:37933:0:28:72:544:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:stationary.  Further,  we  cannot  reject  the  statistical  and  economic  significance  of  both  variables;  
19:539:38045:28:27:72:539:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:hence, omitting either variable induces a composite error and inconsistent parameter estimates.    
19:540:38144:27:28:108:543:654:144:Times:144:Times:A:Empirically, the issue is manifest in the correlation between the size of the Baa-Treasury 
19:541:38235:28:28:72:544:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:yield spread and  the  levels  of corporate equity  and  bond  prices.  During  flights  to  quality,  the  
19:542:38343:28:27:72:539:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:spread  widens  as stock  and  bond  prices  decrease  and  Treasury  prices  rise.  As  a  result,  current-
19:543:38452:27:28:72:544:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:period  yields  on  corporate  assets  fall  and  yields  on  Treasuries  rise.  In  future  periods,  yields  on  
19:544:38567:28:28:72:544:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:corporate assets will increase relative to the current period and yields on Treasuries will fall. In 
19:545:38668:28:27:72:544:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:such  models, increases  in opportunity  costs  are asserted  to  reduce  the  quantity  demanded  and  
19:546:38772:27:28:72:543:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase velocity—but this need not happen after flights to quality because default and liquidity 
19:547:38870:28:27:72:542:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:risk premia are changing. Although not perfect, including Baa10TR is a step towards preventing 
19:548:38964:27:28:72:450:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:flight-to-quality effects from contaminating the effect of the opportunity cost.

20:566:40008:28:28:72:544:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:tends  to  increase  bond  and  stock  fund  ownership  rates  among  households  and  to ease  portfolio

20:569:40318:28:28:72:542:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:exhibit  habit  formation  in  consumption can  lead  to  low  stock  ownership  rates.  Duca  (2005, 
20:570:40420:28:383:72:543:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:2006), using data from the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances, found a significant

21:613:41762:28:27:72:542:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:stock ownership, for both direct and indirect (via mutual funds) stock ownership (Figure 8).  He 
21:614:41859:27:28:72:544:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:further  found  that  higher average equity  participation  arose  largely  from  greater  mutual  fund  
21:615:41964:28:28:72:545:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:ownership among  middle-income  families;  in  turn,  these  families  M2-type  assets  had  grown  
21:616:42064:28:27:72:300:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:more slowly relative to high-income families.   
21:617:42112:27:28:108:542:571:144:Times:144:Times:A:In this study, we update and extend data on mutual fund costs used in Anderson and Duca 
21:618:42200:28:28:72:544:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:(2014)  and  Duca  (2000).    In  those  studies  of  post-war  quarterly  M2  demand, transaction  costs  
21:619:42307:28:27:72:545:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:measured  by  bond  fund  loads  outperformed those  based  on  stock  fund  loads.    This  study,  
21:620:42408:27:28:72:545:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:however,  measures  transaction  costs  using  stock  fund, rather  than  bond  fund, loads,  for  two  
21:621:42512:28:27:72:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:reasons. First, our  purpose  here  is  to  examine  a  longer  span  of  time:  in  contrast  to  stock  funds,  
21:622:42626:27:28:72:545:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:data  on  bond  funds  do  not  cover  the  1920s  and  1930s  and  provide  limited  evidence  on  the  
21:623:42731:28:27:72:543:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:1940s.23  Second, as discussed below, we use a proxy for risk premia—the spread between yields 
21:624:42826:27:28:71:544:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:on  Baa-rate  corporate  and  10-year  Treasury  bonds—which  reflects  the  riskiness  of  both  stocks  
21:625:42932:28:28:71:175:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:and private bonds.     
21:626:42955:28:27:107:545:322:144:Times:144:Times:A:As  in  Duca  (2005),  we  measure stock  fund  loads  as  the  fee  incurred  when  a  fund  is  
21:627:43053:27:28:71:547:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:purchased (front-end load) or incurred when a fund is  sold after less than one year of ownership 
21:628:43151:28:27:71:543:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:(back-end  fee),  both  expressed  as  a  proportion  of  assets  (Figure 9).24    While  this  series  cannot 
21:629:43262:27:28:72:542:240:144:Times:144:Times:B:capture all aspects of asset transfers, for two reasons it likely well-proxies time series movements 
21:630:43363:28:28:72:546:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:in  asset  transfer  costs.  First,  empirical  evidence  suggests  that  technological  change (that  is,  
21:631:43471:28:27:72:546:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:falling  information  technology  costs),  rather  than  economies  of  scale, has  been  the  primary  
21:632:43575:27:25:72:538:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:driver of falling mutual fund costs. Specifically, the difference between the limited (1968-1998)  
21:633:43673:25:12:108:255:132:144:Times:144:Times:A:                                                 
21:634:43721:12:12:72:543:120:99:Times:99:Times:F:   23 Only one bond fund existed before 1950 and it started in 1940, whereas a few stock mutual funds existed in the 
21:635:43838:12:11:71:293:108:99:Times:99:Times:F:1930s, with two prominent ones starting in the 1920s.   
21:636:43893:11:11:71:543:97:99:Times:99:Times:F:   24 We also tested loads using a longer 5 year horizon and/or adjusted for expense ratios (see Duca, 2005).  These 
21:637:44010:11:12:71:542:86:99:Times:99:Times:F:other variants were significant but did not perform as well as the series used here which corresponds more closely 
21:638:44125:12:0:71:207:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:with tracking asset transfer costs. 
22:639:44163:0:25:519:522:410:144:Times:144:Times:A: 
22:640:44163:25:27:72:544:385:144:Times:144:Times:B:available  data  on  banking  sector  productivity  (the  closest  time-series  proxy  for  financial  sector  
22:641:44274:27:28:71:543:358:144:Times:144:Times:B:productivity) and  data  on  mutual  funds  costs  are  stationary,  and  weak  exogeneity  tests  suggest  
22:642:44382:28:28:71:545:330:144:Times:144:Times:B:that bank productivity Granger-causes stock mutual fund loads in a long-run sense  (Duca, 2005).  
22:643:44480:28:27:71:542:302:144:Times:144:Times:B:Second, empirical evidence suggests that mutual fund costs notably influence the composition of 
22:644:44576:27:28:71:544:275:144:Times:144:Times:B:household  portfolios.    Specifically,    stock  mutual  fund  costs  are  cointegrated  with—and  are  
22:645:44681:28:27:71:547:247:144:Times:144:Times:B:highly  and  negatively  correlated  with—stock  ownership  rates,  with  weak  exogeneity  tests  
22:646:44780:27:28:71:544:220:144:Times:144:Times:B:indicating  causality  running  from  long-run  trends  in  mutual  fund  loads  to  equity  participation  
22:647:44888:28:28:71:169:192:144:Times:144:Times:B:rates (Duca, 2013).  
22:648:44908:28:27:107:542:164:144:Times:144:Times:A:At the aggregate time series level, several empirical patterns imply that mutual fund loads 
22:649:45000:27:28:72:543:137:144:Times:144:Times:B:are  a  driver  of  M2  velocity.    Duca  (2005)  found  that  stock  mutual  fund  loads  mainly  reflect 
22:650:45107:28:27:72:544:109:144:Times:144:Times:B:evolving financial  technology.  In  vector  error-correction  models,  loads  were  weakly  exogenous  
22:651:45211:27:0:71:544:82:144:Times:144:Times:B:with  respect  to  the  use  of  mutual  funds  to  own  stock but  not  vice  versa,  while  loads  were  not

23:669:45628:0:28:72:544:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:weakly exogenous to financial sector productivity, but the converse was true.  Granger and Lin 
23:670:45723:28:27:72:543:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:(1995) would view such results as evidence that mutual fund use is caused, in a long-run sense, 
23:671:45819:27:28:71:544:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:by  loads,  which  are  caused  by  financial  technology.  Similarly,  below  we  conclude  that  stock  
23:672:45923:28:28:71:542:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:mutual fund loads are weakly exogenous to M2 velocity, while velocity is not weakly exogenous 
23:673:46017:28:27:71:543:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:to stock fund loads.  These findings imply that trends in loads lead those in velocity, consistent 
23:674:46116:27:28:71:502:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:with the view that asset transfer costs Granger cause money demand in a long-run sense.  
23:675:46204:28:28:71:230:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:Risk Premia and Stock Returns 
23:676:46233:28:27:107:544:515:144:Times:144:Times:A:Households’ perceived risk premia is an important variable in our analysis. We measure 
23:677:46320:27:28:71:543:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  risk  premia  as  the  spread  between  yields  on  Baa  corporate  bonds and the 10-year  Treasury  
23:678:46426:28:27:71:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:constant-maturity  yield.  This  measure  includes  compensation  to investors  for  the  higher  default  
23:679:46533:27:28:71:545:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:and  liquidity  risk  on  the  Baa  bond  (the  lowest  investment  grade  corporate  bond).  Evidence  
23:680:46637:28:28:71:543:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggests that, via arbitrage, it also measures risk in stock prices: The portfolio share of stocks for 
23:681:46740:28:27:72:544:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  household  sector  shows  much  more  variation  than  that  of  bonds  (Federal  Reserve  Financial  
23:682:46847:27:28:72:543:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:Accounts),  implying  that  both  include  a  common risk  premia.  Further,  an  equity  risk  premium 
23:683:46950:28:27:72:543:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:measured as the gap between the earnings-price ratio for nonfinancial corporate stocks and a real 
23:684:47048:27:28:72:542:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:ex post bond yield is more stable when measured using the Baa corporate  yield, rather than the 
23:685:47143:28:28:71:415:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:10-year Treasury yield (chart available upon request from the authors). 
23:686:47214:28:27:107:545:239:144:Times:144:Times:A:We  construct  our  measure using the Moody’s Baa  yield  from  the  1920s  to  2014.  For  
23:687:47306:27:28:71:543:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:Treasury yields, from April 1954-2014 we use the constant maturity 10-year Treasury yield. For 
23:688:47401:28:27:71:545:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:1941-54,  we  use  Federal  Reserve  data  on  the  average  yield  on  long-term  U.S.  Government  
23:689:47502:27:28:71:543:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:securities, and for 1926-41 we use a separate U.S. government bond yield series. The series are 
23:690:47598:28:0:71:543:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:spliced by matching the levels during overlapping periods with small additive adjustments. The 
24:691:47696:0:28:72:544:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:series  are  compared  in  Figure 2  (above)  for  the  periods  of  the  Great  Depression  and  the  Great  
24:692:47806:28:326:71:406:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:Recession, while entire the time series is plotted in Figure 10 below.

24:694:47877:25:27:107:544:330:144:Times:144:Times:A:ADF  tests  suggest  that  shocks  to  our  risk  premia  measure  are  persistent,  that  is,  the  
24:695:47978:27:28:71:543:303:144:Times:144:Times:B:hypothesis of I(1) “permanent” shocks cannot be rejected. Persistence in the risk premia measure 
24:696:48075:28:28:71:542:275:144:Times:144:Times:B:is even more pronounced when scaled by stock fund loads (Figure 10), which according to Liu’s 
24:697:48169:28:27:71:363:247:144:Times:144:Times:B:(2004) model, should be correlated with portfolio behavior.  
24:698:48229:27:28:107:544:220:144:Times:144:Times:A:In  addition  to  the  measured  risk  premia,  our  empirical  baseline  model  includes  stock  
24:699:48327:28:27:71:543:192:144:Times:144:Times:B:loads  in  the  cointegrating  vector  and  the  short-run  dynamic  equations;  in  the  latter,  it  seeks  to  
24:700:48441:27:28:71:545:165:144:Times:144:Times:B:capture  the  time-varying  sensitivity  of  M2’s  velocity  to  stock  returns  and  risk  premia.  Our  
24:701:48547:28:28:71:544:137:144:Times:144:Times:B:baseline model also includes a variable measuring the opportunity cost of M2 relative to stocks, 
24:702:48644:28:27:71:543:109:144:Times:144:Times:B:OCST, equal to the difference between ex post returns on all U.S. stocks (dividends and capital 
24:703:48740:27:0:71:544:82:144:Times:144:Times:B:gains,  as  in  Shiller,  2014)  minus  M2’s  measured  own  rate  of  return.  Empirically,  we  cannot

26:799:52623:12:12:71:543:120:99:Times:99:Times:F:   26 In this manner, we seek an M2 measure as consistent as possible, over our entire sample, with the definition of 
26:800:52741:12:11:71:358:108:99:Times:99:Times:F:M2 as currently published by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. 
26:801:52809:11:11:71:543:97:99:Times:99:Times:F:   27 We also tested loads using a longer 5 year horizon and/or adjusted for expense ratios (see Duca, 2005).  These 
26:802:52926:11:12:71:542:86:99:Times:99:Times:F:other variants were significant but did not perform as well as the series used here which corresponds more closely 
26:803:53041:12:0:71:207:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:with tracking asset transfer costs. 
27:804:53079:0:31:72:540:707:144:Times:144:Times:B:We include several dummy variables,tD, to capture unusual shocks to money demand, primarily

27:806:53224:27:28:72:544:649:144:Times:144:Times:B:The 1933 Bank  Holiday:  Beginning  with  the  first  bank  crisis  of  October  1930,  increased  risk  
27:807:53329:28:28:72:539:621:144:Times:144:Times:B:premia induced velocity declines early in the Great Depression; during 1932, velocity was three-
27:808:53425:28:27:72:543:593:144:Times:144:Times:B:quarters  of  its  1929  level.29  Velocity  increased  in  1933,  the  year  of Roosevelt’s  Bank  Holiday, 
27:809:53534:27:28:72:543:566:144:Times:144:Times:B:even as the level of M2 averaged lower during the year. One reason perhaps was that commercial 
27:810:53629:28:27:72:543:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:bank depositors experienced losses of 2.15 percent (Friedman and Schwartz, 1963, p. 438) in this 
27:811:53726:27:28:72:546:511:144:Times:144:Times:B:pre-deposit  insurance  era,  directly  reducing  M2  and  inducing households  to  shift  toward  
27:812:53825:28:28:71:544:483:144:Times:144:Times:B:currency.30  Another,  perhaps,  was the  belief  before  the  Bank  Holiday  that  the  relatively  young  
27:813:53933:28:27:71:543:455:144:Times:144:Times:B:Federal Reserve would intervene to prevent the suspension of deposits. That belief, if crushed by 
27:814:54031:27:28:72:545:428:144:Times:144:Times:B:repeated  bank  runs  and  the  suspension  of  failed  banks,  might  have  lowered  the  demand  for  
27:815:54135:28:27:72:542:400:144:Times:144:Times:B:money  until  the  start  of  FDIC  insurance  in  1934.  To  examine this  effect,  the  model  includes  a 
27:816:54244:27:28:72:358:373:144:Times:144:Times:B:BankHoliday dummy equal to 1 in 1933, and 0 otherwise.   
27:817:54300:28:28:72:547:345:144:Times:144:Times:B:Deflation  also  is  a  special  event  that  might  shift  confidence.   Conventional  measures  of  M2’s  
27:818:54408:28:27:72:544:317:144:Times:144:Times:B:opportunity  cost  embody  the  impact  of  inflation  on  money  demand  via  the  expected  inflation  
27:819:54513:27:28:72:544:290:144:Times:144:Times:B:embedded  in  nominal  interest  rates.  The  zero  lower  bound  on  nominal  interest  rates  prevents  
27:820:54619:28:27:72:542:262:144:Times:144:Times:B:these  measures  from  doing  the  same  during  periods  of  deflation.  To  examine this  effect,  the 
27:821:54724:27:22:72:543:235:144:Times:144:Times:B:model  includes  a  dummy  (DeflationPCE)  equal  to  1  in  years  when  year-over-year  inflation  as

27:823:54877:12:12:72:543:201:99:Times:99:Times:F:   28 Below, we discuss the extent to which these same events might be captured in other explanatory variables, such 
27:824:54994:12:12:71:138:189:99:Times:99:Times:F:as interest rates. 
27:825:55012:12:11:71:543:177:99:Times:99:Times:F:   29 Although nominal M2 in 1932 was 75 percent of its 1929 level, “real” M2 (adjusted by the GDP price deflator) 
27:826:55127:11:11:71:542:166:99:Times:99:Times:F:was 98.5 percent of its 1929 level. Friedman and Schwartz (1963), ch. 7, note that the 1930 banking crisis was as 
27:827:55241:11:12:71:541:155:99:Times:99:Times:F:severe  as  most  during  the  nineteenth  century  and,  absent  the  presence  of  the  Federal  Reserve,  likely  would  have 
27:828:55369:12:12:71:542:143:99:Times:99:Times:F:resulted in a restriction of the convertibility of deposits into currency. It is unreasonable to argue that the crisis did 
27:829:55492:12:11:71:243:131:99:Times:99:Times:F:not increase risk premia for bank deposits. 
27:830:55535:11:12:71:543:120:99:Times:99:Times:F:   30  Friedman  and  Schwartz  (1963),  ch.  8,  note  that  most  licensed  banks  resumed  business  after  the  bank  holiday  
27:831:55666:12:11:71:542:108:99:Times:99:Times:F:without significant restriction, but unlicensed banks (more than 5,000 at the time of the holiday) were slow to reopen 
27:832:55785:11:11:71:543:97:99:Times:99:Times:F:and  almost  half  never  reopened.  The  mythology  enshrined  in  many  money  and  banking  texts  is  that  depositors  
27:833:55909:11:12:71:543:86:99:Times:99:Times:F:suffered  large  losses  during  the  early  1930s;  in  fact,  the  losses  were  small.  Repeated  bank  runs  perhaps  were  the  
27:834:56042:12:0:71:281:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:larger cause of increases in the public’s risk premia. 
28:835:56099:0:28:72:545:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:measured  by  the  personal  consumption  expenditure  price  index  was  negative  (1930-33,  1937,  
28:836:56201:28:27:72:192:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:1938, 1949, and 2009).

28:838:56324:28:28:71:542:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:(“peg”) short- and long-term Treasury rates at low levels. An inflation spike following the end of 
28:839:56423:28:27:71:543:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:WWII  price  controls  and  a  second  spike  in  the  first  year  (1950)  of  the  Korean  War  risked 
28:840:56528:27:28:71:545:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:undermining  the  Federal  Reserve’s  inflation  credibility.  Plausibly,  by  reestablishing  monetary  
28:841:56633:28:28:71:543:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:independence,  the  Accord enhanced   M2  as  a  store  of  value.  To examine this  effect,  the  model

28:846:57082:28:28:71:543:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:interest rates, the accounts could attract funds from non-M2 assets (see Small and Porter, 1989, 
28:847:57179:28:27:72:545:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:and  Duca,  2000;  Lucas  and  Nicolini,  2014).   To  examine  this  effect,  we  include  a  dummy  
28:848:57281:27:28:72:466:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:variable (DMMDA = 1 in 1983) for the introduction of MMDA deposits in 1983.  
28:849:57358:28:27:72:543:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:Dodd-Frank Act: The  Dodd-Frank Act (DFA) of 2010 is another regulatory change that likely 
28:850:57449:27:28:72:543:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:affects money demand and lowers velocity. Aspects of DFA, including requiring banks to retain 
28:851:57543:28:28:72:546:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:some  loss  exposure  in  securitized  loans  and  requiring  “systemically  important”  banks  and  
28:852:57644:28:27:72:543:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:nonbanks to pass “stress tests,” tend to reduce the attractiveness of the shadow banking system as 
28:853:57743:27:28:72:546:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:financial  intermediaries  relative  to  chartered  commercial  banks  (Duca,  forthcoming).    As  a  
28:854:57846:28:27:72:543:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:result, the traditional regulated banking system is likely to increase in size relative to the shadow 
28:855:57947:27:28:72:543:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:banking  system.  Because  M2-type  instruments  are  a  major  source  of  funding  for  banks  but  not  
28:856:58054:28:28:72:544:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:for  shadow  banks,  this  effect  of  DFA  portends  a  lower  velocity  of  M2.  To  examine  this  effect,  
28:857:58165:28:0:72:544:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:we  include  a  dummy  (DFA) equal  to  0  before  2010,  .25  in  2010  (DFA  was  passed  in  summer  
29:858:58272:0:28:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:2010) and 1 thereafter.  Since this level shift occurs at the end of the sample, we anticipate that it 
29:859:58375:28:27:72:543:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:will be difficult to identify, partly as M2 was affected by the 2011 change in the assessment of 
29:860:58472:27:28:72:546:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:FDIC  insurance  premiums  that  induced  banks  to  shift  deposits  booked  overseas  to  onshore  
29:861:58573:28:28:72:545:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Kreicher,  et  al.,  2013;  Judson,  et  al.,  2014). Further,  because  regulatory  reform  was  widely  
29:862:58680:28:27:72:543:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:anticipated after the global financial crisis, the effect of DFA may be difficult to capture with any 
29:863:58782:27:28:72:162:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:auxiliary variable. 
29:864:58801:28:28:72:135:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:Stationarity  
29:865:58814:28:27:108:542:515:144:Times:144:Times:A:We examine the covariance stationarity of our variables via ADF test statistics in Table 1. 
29:866:58906:27:28:72:543:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:The tests fail to reject the hypothesis that the levels display unit root behavior but the differences 
29:867:59009:28:27:72:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:do not (i.e., are I(0) stationary) for the log of nominal M2 (m), the log of the GDP price deflator 
29:868:59109:27:28:72:544:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:(p),  the  log  of  nominal  GDP  (y),  the  log  of  M2  velocity  (v),  M2’s  opportunity  cost  measured  
29:869:59218:28:28:72:539:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:relative to yields on short-term Treasury securities, stock mutual fund loads, the log of the Baa-
29:870:59316:28:27:72:543:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:Treasury spread, and real M2 (m-p). Below, we conclude that a single cointegrating vector exists 
29:871:59413:27:28:72:543:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:for eq. (9a). We also accept that two stochastic intervention variables that enter into the dynamic 
29:872:59513:28:27:72:543:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:model, eq. (9b), are covariance stationary: OCST, the opportunity cost of M2 measured relative 
29:873:59608:27:28:72:500:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:to stock returns, and YC, the slope of the Treasury yield curve (10-year - 3-month rates). 
29:874:59698:28:28:72:157:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:Model Estimates 
29:875:59713:28:27:108:545:239:144:Times:144:Times:A:Eight  variants  of  equations  (9a,  b)  are  presented  in  Table  1.  The  models  differ  with  
29:876:59813:27:28:71:543:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:respect to sample periods, explanatory variables, and short-run controls (dummy variables).  All 
29:877:59910:28:27:71:543:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:models include six individual-year dummies to control for WW II effects during 1941-46.31 All 
29:878:60004:27:28:72:544:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:models  are  estimated  with  a  lag  length  of  4,  leaving  a  “full-sample”  period  of  1932-2014.  The  
29:879:60114:28:31:72:543:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:lag length was chosen judgmentally  according  to  three  criteria:  a unique cointegrating vector, a 
29:880:60216:31:12:108:255:98:144:Times:144:Times:A:                                                 
29:881:60264:12:12:72:547:86:99:Times:99:Times:F:   31  The  six  variables  are  simple  binary  dummy  variables.  For  example, Di =  1,  if  year  is  1941;  =  0  otherwise.    
29:882:60394:12:0:72:266:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:Variables for 1942-1946 are specified similarly. 
30:883:60445:0:28:72:545:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:rapid  speed  of  adjustment,  and clean  residuals.    No  time  trend  was  included  in  the  models’  
30:884:60551:28:27:72:437:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:cointegrating vectors, but time trends are permitted in the dynamic model.   
30:885:60628:27:28:72:543:654:144:Times:144:Times:B: The models shown in columns 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 assert a long-run equilibrium that includes 
30:886:60717:28:28:72:543:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:M2’s opportunity cost, the corporate-Treasury yield spread,  and stock fund loads.  The model in 
30:887:60814:28:27:72:543:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:column 4 specifies a long-run equilibrium that omits stock fund loads; the models in columns 5 
30:888:60909:27:28:72:544:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:and  8  omit  stock  fund  loads  and  the  corporate-Treasury  yield  spread.  The  short-run  dynamic  
30:889:61014:28:28:72:543:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:models in columns 1, 2, 4, 5, and 8 include a full set of short-run variables, the model in column 
30:890:61113:28:27:72:540:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:3 omits the bank regulatory dummy variables, and the models in columns 6 and 7 omit the Dodd-
30:891:61206:27:28:72:543:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:Frank dummy variable. Models also differ by sample period: the models in columns 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 
30:892:61302:28:27:72:546:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:and 8 are estimated using the full sample, the models in columns 2 and 6 use a shorter sample.     
30:893:61401:27:28:72:542:433:144:Times:144:Times:B: The  purpose  of  Model  2  is  to  assess the robustness  of  Model  1’s  coefficients  to  events 
30:894:61501:28:28:72:543:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:beginning  2006  that  foreshadowed  the  recent  financial  crisis.  Model  3  seeks  to  assess the 
30:895:61603:28:27:72:542:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:robustness  of  the  long-run  coefficients  to  the  exclusion  of  most  of  the  non-WW  II  short-run 
30:896:61709:27:28:72:543:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:variables  in  model  1  except  for  the  opportunity  cost  terms  with  respect  to  Treasury  bonds  (YC) 
30:897:61819:28:27:72:546:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:and stocks (OCST) and the DFA variable that controls for a regime change at the end of sample.  
30:898:61915:27:28:72:542:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:Model  4  seeks  to  assess  the  robustness  of  Model  1  to  omission  of  the  stock  fund  load  series; 
30:899:62025:28:28:72:543:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:model 5 omits both stock fund loads and the corporate bond spread.  Model 6, estimated through 
30:900:62120:28:27:72:543:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:1998, seeks to assess to what extent Model 2’s estimates might be affected by the large rise and 
30:901:62217:27:28:72:543:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:sudden  fall  of  U.S.  stock  prices  around  the  year  2000-date  change  and  by  the  recent  financial  
30:902:62327:28:27:72:547:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:crisis.  Models  7  and  8  are  variants  of  models  1  and  3  that  replace  nominal  GDP  with  nominal  
30:903:62437:27:28:72:542:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:gross  domestic  income  (GDI).    Because  GDI  has  recently  grown  faster  than  GDP,  later 
30:904:62534:28:28:72:543:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:benchmark  revisions  to  GDP  could  alter  coefficient  estimates.    Benchmark  revisions  usually 
30:905:62636:28:0:72:504:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:narrow discrepancies between the income (GDI) and product sides of the NIPA accounts. 
31:906:62724:0:28:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:B: A  unique  and  statistically  significant  cointegrating  vector  was  identified  in  Models  1-3 
31:907:62824:28:27:72:543:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:and 5-8. The estimated coefficient on each of the long-run terms was highly significant with the 
31:908:62921:27:28:72:542:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:expected sign. Higher stock fund loads and higher corporate risk spreads reduce velocity because 
31:909:63018:28:28:72:543:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher asset transfer costs lower the liquidity of non-M2 assets and raise the demand for M2.  In 
31:910:63116:28:27:72:544:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:contrast,  higher  opportunity  costs  of  M2  with  respect  to  Treasury  bill  rates  (OC)  reduce  the  
31:911:63224:27:28:72:539:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:incentive  to  hold  M2  balances,  increasing  velocity.   The  VECM  coefficients  on  the  error-
31:912:63324:28:28:72:543:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:correction term in regressions of the other three long-run variables indicate that they are weakly 
31:913:63423:28:27:72:545:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:exogenous  to  velocity,  implying  that  long-run  trends  in  risk  premia,  mutual  fund  costs,  and  
31:914:63529:27:28:72:543:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:conventional M2 opportunity costs move temporally ahead of those in velocity (Granger and Lin, 
31:915:63624:28:27:72:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:1995).  We note that OC is not statistically significant in the models that omit stock fund loads 
31:916:63722:27:28:72:542:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:(4,  5,  8)  or  bond  risk  premia  (models  5  and  8),  plausibly  reflecting  omitted  variable  bias  from 
31:917:63834:28:28:72:543:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:excluding the statistically significant impacts of asset transfer costs and risk premia on velocity..   
31:918:63938:28:27:72:543:377:144:Times:144:Times:B: Within the set of models that include all three long-run determinants of velocity (1, 2, 3, 
31:919:64030:27:28:72:539:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:6, and 7),  the  coefficients  on  conventional  opportunity  costs, stock  fund  loads  and  corporate-
31:920:64134:28:27:72:543:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:Treasury yields spreads are very similar. We conclude that our baseline specification is robust to 
31:921:64233:27:28:72:543:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:both whether  it  is  estimated  over  a  pre-crisis  or  post-crisis sample and to whether  it  includes 
31:922:64338:28:28:72:526:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:short-run variables that control for unusual financial/regulatory/regime shocks (BankHoliday,  
31:923:64433:28:27:72:386:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:DumAccord, DMMDA, and DFA) or a deflation (DeflationPCE). 
31:924:64491:27:28:72:543:212:144:Times:144:Times:B: Among the models that include a full set of short-run controls and are estimated over the 
31:925:64581:28:27:72:542:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:full  sample  (1,  4,  5),  model  1 outperforms  models  4  and  5—which  omit  stock  fund  loads—in 
31:926:64684:27:28:72:545:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:several  dimensions.    First,  in  model  1,  the  coefficient  on  OC  is highly  significant  at  the  99  
31:927:64794:28:28:71:543:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:percent confidence level and its estimated value is similar in size to those in models 2 and 3. The 
31:928:64894:28:0:72:540:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimated OC coefficients in models 4 and 5 are not statistically significant.  Second, the error-
32:929:64995:0:28:72:544:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:correction coefficient for model 1 is about three times as large as that for models 4 and 5.  The 
32:930:65093:28:27:72:543:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:coefficient estimate for model 1 implies that the current year change in velocity tends to remove 
32:931:65191:27:28:72:543:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:32 percent  of  the  gap  between  actual  and  equilibrium  velocity  from  the  prior  year.    Hence, the 
32:932:65300:28:28:72:545:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:discrepancy  between  actual  velocity,  V2,  and  its  estimated  equilibrium  level,  V2*, is  largely  
32:933:65406:28:27:72:545:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:eliminated  in  a  plausible  four-year  time  span  rather  than  the  implausibly  long  ten  year  spans  
32:934:65515:27:28:71:543:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggested  by  models  4  and  5.    Third,  the  fit  of  model  1  is  higher  than  that  of  models  4  and  5,  
32:935:65632:28:27:71:544:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:judged  by  the  corrected  R2.    This  reflects  information  from  stock  fund  loads  (and compared  to  
32:936:65741:27:28:72:543:516:144:Times:144:Times:B:model 5, also from corporate bond spreads) coming through the error-correction term and lagged 
32:937:65836:28:28:72:543:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:first differences.  As illustrated earlier in Figure 1, the implied equilibrium level of velocity from 
32:938:65939:28:27:72:542:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:model 1 tracks actual velocity well, particularly if the path is adjusted for the medium-run effects 
32:939:66040:27:28:72:545:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:of  WWII  and  the  post-DFA  financial  regulatory  regime.      Similar  qualitative  results  were  
32:940:66143:28:28:72:546:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:obtained when  velocity  is  defined  using  GDI  instead  of  GDP  in  models  7  and  8,  which  
32:941:66242:28:27:72:291:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:correspond to Models 1 and 5, respectively.   
32:942:66287:27:28:72:542:350:144:Times:144:Times:B: The short-run variables, other than the WWII controls and lagged first difference terms of 
32:943:66378:28:27:72:543:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:long-run vector variables, serve several roles.  Two control for the short-run influences of money 
32:944:66477:27:28:72:544:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:opportunity  costs  vis-à-vis  stocks  (OCST)  and  long-run  Treasury  bonds  (YC),  as  suggested  by  
32:945:66582:28:28:71:543:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:Friedman and Schwartz.  Because their inclusion helps complete the specification’s coverage of 
32:946:66677:28:27:71:544:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:major  substitution  effects,  they  are  included  in  all  models.    The  variable  tracking  opportunity  
32:947:66787:27:28:71:543:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:costs with respect to stocks (OCST) is highly significant in every regression, with higher values 
32:948:66885:28:27:71:543:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:raising  velocity  via  lowering  money  demand.    The  opportunity  cost  term  tracking  the  Treasury  
32:949:66992:27:28:71:542:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:yield curve slope, YC, has the expected positive sign, but at best is only marginally significant in 
32:950:67093:28:28:71:544:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:three of  eight  models. In  contrast,  DeflationPCE  which  tracks  deflationary  episodes  is  highly  
32:951:67198:28:0:71:546:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:significant with  a  negative  estimated  effect  of  minus  4  to  5  percent.    Together  with  the  
33:952:67305:0:28:72:542:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:significant  impact  of  the  conventional  opportunity  cost  term,  this  finding  is  consistent  with  the 
33:953:67416:28:27:72:543:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:view that price changes influence money demand in ways that are normally tracked by traditional 
33:954:67512:27:28:72:375:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:opportunity cost measures but not during periods of deflation.  
33:955:67575:28:28:72:544:626:144:Times:144:Times:B: To  control  for  a  likely  regime  shift  at  the  end  of  the  sample, each  full  sample  model  
33:956:67677:28:27:72:543:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:includes the DFA to track how the Dodd-Frank Act has helped to shrink the relative size of the 
33:957:67772:27:28:72:544:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:shadow  banking  sector  (Duca, forthcoming)  and  indirectly  boost  the  size  of  the  banking  sector  
33:958:67879:28:28:71:542:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:that  relies  on  M2  deposits  for  much  of  its  funding.    In  other  models that  omit  DFA,  other 
33:959:67985:28:27:71:545:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimated  coefficients  are  similar,  but  serial  correlation  arises  in  the  residuals.    This  likely  
33:960:68096:27:28:71:545:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:reflects  that  the  Dodd-Frank  Act  effectively  has  imparted  a  persistent  upward  shift  in  money  
33:961:68203:28:27:71:548:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:demand   (and   a   downward   shift   in   velocity)   by   altering   the   architecture   of   financial   
33:962:68313:27:28:71:153:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:intermediation.   
33:963:68331:28:28:71:545:405:144:Times:144:Times:B: The  inclusion  of  the  other  short-run  variables  also  helps  address  serial  correlation  in  
33:964:68432:28:27:71:542:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:residuals without affecting long-run coefficients, but that arising from shorter-lived shocks.  For 
33:965:68532:27:28:71:543:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:example, while the long-run coefficients in models 1 and 3 are similar, the residuals are not clean 
33:966:68632:28:27:71:543:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:for model 3, which omits several short-run variables in model 1.  Among these variables are the 
33:967:68728:27:28:71:543:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:dummy for the Bank Holiday of 1933 (BankHoliday), which has the expected positive sign and 
33:968:68819:28:28:71:545:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:is  statistically significant with a large sized estimated effect (4 to 9 percent) in most regressions.  
33:969:68924:28:27:71:545:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:Another variable, DMMDA,  which  tracks  the  short-run  effect  of  introducing  MMDAs  in  late  
33:970:69023:27:28:71:542:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:1982  and  early  1983 has  the  expected  negative  sign,  but  is  insignificant  in  the  models  that 
33:971:69129:28:27:71:543:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:include it with an   estimated effect of 2 to 5 percent (0.05 in a log specification).  The variable for 
33:972:69234:27:28:71:544:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  short-run  effect  of  the  Treasury-Fed  Accord  (DumAccord)  also  has  the  expected  negative  
33:973:69338:28:28:71:543:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:effect on velocity, plausibly reflecting how it may have bolstered money demand by increasing 
33:974:69432:28:0:71:544:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:Fed  independence.    Nevertheless,  its  effect  is  at  best  only marginally significant  in  two  of  the  
34:975:69546:0:28:72:549:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:three models  that  include  the  corporate  bond  spread  and  stock  mutual  fund  load  series.    
34:976:69648:28:27:72:545:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:Comparing  models  1  and  3  indicates  that  inclusion  of  these  four  short-run  variables  jointly  
34:977:69754:27:28:72:545:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:increases  the  corrected  R-square  by  a  sizable  6 percent,  while  eliminating  short-run  serial  
34:978:69858:28:34:72:234:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:correlation at a lag length of two.

34:980:69941:27:28:108:544:565:144:Times:144:Times:A:An important aspect of our analysis is to address this question: When economic activity 
34:981:70029:28:28:72:542:537:144:Times:144:Times:B:returns to more “normal” levels and risk premia revert to more normal levels, what growth of the 
34:982:70126:28:27:72:543:509:144:Times:144:Times:B:broad money supply will be consistent with low, stable inflation? We emphasized above that the 
34:983:70221:27:28:72:543:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:historical record with regard to answering this question is slight—the 2008 financial crisis has as 
34:984:70321:28:27:72:545:454:144:Times:144:Times:B:its precedent  the  Great  Depression  of  the  1930s—and  the  historical record  muddied  by  the  
34:985:70422:27:28:72:544:427:144:Times:144:Times:B:interaction  between  broad  money’s  changing  opportunity  cost  and  the  wide  fluctuations  of  risk  
34:986:70529:28:28:72:291:399:144:Times:144:Times:B:premia during periods of financial stress.    
34:987:70573:28:27:108:546:371:144:Times:144:Times:A:The  macroeconomic  significance  of  our  in-sample  results  with  regard  to  providing  
34:988:70665:27:28:72:543:344:144:Times:144:Times:B:answers for this question might be assessed via simulations of velocity, thereby drawing out its 
34:989:70762:28:27:72:543:316:144:Times:144:Times:B:implications for nominal GDP under different scenarios for M2 growth and under a common set 
34:990:70854:27:28:72:545:289:144:Times:144:Times:B:of  assumed  future  values  for  key  variables  that  affect  velocity. Herein,  for BaaTR,  we  used  
34:991:70959:28:28:71:545:261:144:Times:144:Times:B:average  Blue  Chip  Financial  forecasts  (from  August  2014)  of  the  Baa  Corporate  rate  and  
34:992:71060:28:27:71:546:233:144:Times:144:Times:B:Congressional Budget Office  forecasts  of  10-year  Treasury  yields  for  2014  and 2015.  We  
34:993:71157:27:28:71:542:206:144:Times:144:Times:B:construct  a  BaaTR  path  through  2019  by  assuming  that  BaaTR  will fall  0.1  percentage  points 
34:994:71260:28:27:71:544:178:144:Times:144:Times:B:during  that  period,  converging  to  its  1970-2006  average  spread  of  2.0  percent.    For  the  yield  
34:995:71370:27:28:71:542:151:144:Times:144:Times:B:curve spread, we used CBO forecasts of the 3-month and 10-year Treasury yields.  We assumed 
34:996:71462:28:0:71:441:123:144:Times:144:Times:B:that OC would rise 0.1 percentage points per year to level out at 0.4 points.   
35:997:71544:0:28:108:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:A:We use coefficient estimates from model 1 to construct a forecast of equilibrium velocity 
35:998:71634:28:27:72:546:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:from 2015-19  before  adjusting  for  DFA  effects.    To  adjust  for  the  future  impact  of  DFA  
35:999:71736:27:28:72:543:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:implementation on the log level of velocity, we treated the year estimated coefficient on the DFA 
35:1000:71834:28:28:72:542:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:dummy (equal to .25 in 2010, 1 in 2011-2014, and 0 thereafter) as a current year impact factor, to 
35:1001:71933:28:27:72:544:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:which  we  added  the  prior  year’s  estimated  level  effect  multiplied  by  one  minus  the  estimated  
35:1002:72041:27:28:72:545:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:error  correction  speed.    By  construction,  we  effectively  assume  a  roughly  30  percent  annual  
35:1003:72147:28:28:72:550:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:adjustment   speed,   which   translates   into   a   4   year   transition   to   a   DFA   regulated   world.      
35:1004:72264:28:27:72:542:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:Essentially, DFA permanently lowers log velocity by a sizable 0.22.  The resulting path in Figure 
35:1005:72362:27:28:72:543:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:12 shows a mild upturn in V2* during 2016 and 2017, before leveling off.  Since V2 adjusts with 
35:1006:72458:28:27:72:509:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:a lag, this suggests a delayed uptick in V2 before accounting for other short-run dynamics. 
35:1007:72550:27:28:108:544:433:144:Times:144:Times:A:As  a  partial  equilibrium  simulation,  we  multiply  this  equilibrium path  for  velocity  by  
35:1008:72649:28:28:71:543:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:different paths for M2 under the assumptions of continued near 6.5 percent M2 growth through 
35:1009:72742:28:27:71:543:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:2019, as well as for 5 and 4 percent growth paths.  This produces levels of simulated equilibrium 
35:1010:72840:27:28:71:542:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:nominal  GDP,  from  which  we  compute  simulated  growth  rate  paths  for  equilibrium nominal 
35:1011:72938:28:27:71:544:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:GDP.    As  shown  in  Figure  13,  a  6.5  percent  M2  growth  scenario  induces  about  a  6  percent  
35:1012:73044:27:28:71:545:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:average  path  for  nominal  GDP  over  2015-19,  implying  a  mild  acceleration  of  inflation.    5  
35:1013:73148:28:28:71:543:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:percent  M2  growth  allows  for  enough  near-term  nominal  GDP  growth  to  enable  a  recovery  to  
35:1014:73252:28:27:71:543:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:full  employment,  with  about  2-½  percent  inflation thereafter.    Four  percent  M2  growth  implies  
35:1015:73359:27:28:71:543:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:low-to-moderate nominal GDP growth, which is consistent with keeping long-run inflation at or 
35:1016:73453:28:27:71:177:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:just below 2 percent.  
35:1017:73475:27:28:107:493:157:144:Times:144:Times:A:In addition to the static simulation of equilibrium V2, model 1 was dynamically 
35:1018:73555:28:28:71:493:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:simulated to account for both the delayed error-correction adjustment of V2 towards its 
35:1019:73643:28:0:71:507:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:equilibrium and the short-run dynamic effects of changes in its long-run determinants.  As 
36:1020:73737:0:28:72:523:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:illustrated in Figure 14, the simulation suggests that M2 velocity will decrease in 2015, 2016, 
36:1021:73833:28:27:72:516:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:and 2017 by 1.75, 0.56, and 0.27 percent, respectively, before increasing in 2018, 2019, and 
36:1022:73926:27:28:72:540:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:2020 by 0.66, 1.1, and 1.03 percent, respectively.  The model's near-term prediction is confirmed 
36:1023:74024:28:28:72:529:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:by preliminary data: velocity during the first three quarters of 2015 was 2.1 percent lower than 
36:1024:74121:28:27:72:502:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:its four-quarter average in 2014. A near-term decrease in velocity might be welcomed by 
36:1025:74209:27:28:71:509:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:policymakers as they seek to shrink the Federal Reserve's balance sheet (and moderate M2 
36:1026:74298:28:28:71:525:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:growth) during the return to a "normal" policy stance.  The assumed or projected paths for the 
36:1027:74393:28:27:71:518:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:drivers of V2 are plotted in Appendix C, along with the residuals of the short-run changes in

38:1089:75455:0:25:72:144:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:7. Conclusion 
38:1090:75468:25:28:108:544:683:144:Times:144:Times:A:This  study  presents a  model  of  U.S.  broad  money  demand  since  the  onset  of  the  Great  
38:1091:75567:28:27:72:543:655:144:Times:144:Times:B:Depression. The model is able to track more than 80 years of money demand, through both the 
38:1092:75659:27:28:71:542:628:144:Times:144:Times:B:Great Depression and the Great Recession by  incorporating  interactions  among three variables: 
38:1093:75756:28:27:72:543:600:144:Times:144:Times:B:(i) the traditional opportunity cost of M2, (ii) long-run declines in the transaction costs of using 
38:1094:75857:27:28:72:543:573:144:Times:144:Times:B:M2  substitutes,  and  (iii)  a  measure  of  financial  market  participants’  perceived  risk.  All  three 
38:1095:75965:28:28:72:544:545:144:Times:144:Times:B:variables  are  economically  and  statistically  significant  in  our  long-run  model.  Because  all  three  
38:1096:76076:28:27:71:543:517:144:Times:144:Times:B:are  covariance  non-stationary  and  mutually  correlated,  omitting  any  from  the  empirical model 
38:1097:76178:27:28:72:543:490:144:Times:144:Times:B:would  cause  an implicit  nonstationary  disturbance  and  inconsistent  parameter  estimates.  We 
38:1098:76278:28:28:72:542:462:144:Times:144:Times:B:conjecture  that  past  “velocity  shifts”  and  cases  of  “missing  M2”  are  statistical  consequences  of 
38:1099:76388:28:27:72:543:434:144:Times:144:Times:B:such miss-specification that arises from not fully accounting for these important determinants of 
38:1100:76486:27:28:72:151:407:144:Times:144:Times:B:money demand. 
38:1101:76499:28:27:72:545:379:144:Times:144:Times:B:     Because  our estimated  dynamic  model  tracks  velocity  well  over  the  long  time  period  
38:1102:76599:27:28:72:543:352:144:Times:144:Times:B:spanning the two major U.S. financial crises of the past century, it can help extract information 
38:1103:76697:28:28:72:543:324:144:Times:144:Times:B:important to  the  conduct  of  monetary  policy  from  movements  in  the  path  of a  broad  monetary  
38:1104:76802:28:27:71:544:296:144:Times:144:Times:B:aggregate. Models  that  accurately  track  M2  velocity  are  particularly  valuable  during  periods  
38:1105:76906:27:28:71:544:269:144:Times:144:Times:B:when  risk  premia  change  quickly.  Following  crisis  periods,  economic  activity  is  returning  to  
38:1106:77012:28:27:71:543:241:144:Times:144:Times:B:normal but, at the same time, velocity is increasing as risk premia recede from crisis peaks. This 
38:1107:77111:27:28:72:542:214:144:Times:144:Times:B:is particularly relevant in comparing the Great Depression and the Great Recession.  The starts of 
38:1108:77210:28:28:72:542:186:144:Times:144:Times:B:these crisis periods were marked by sharp increases in risk premia and decreases in velocity. One 
38:1109:77307:28:27:71:544:158:144:Times:144:Times:B:key  difference  is  velocity  recovered  rapidly  in  the  mid-1930s as risk  premia  retreated,  whereas  
38:1110:77415:27:28:71:543:131:144:Times:144:Times:B:the recovery  in  velocity  after  the  Great  Recession  was  offset  by  the  impact  of  the  Dodd-Frank 
38:1111:77523:28:27:71:544:103:144:Times:144:Times:B:Act,  which  induced  shifts  into  money  from  other  assets  by  altering  the  structure  of  the  U.S.  
38:1112:77632:27:0:71:544:76:144:Times:144:Times:B:banking  and  financial  system,  consistent  with  Bordo  and  Jonung  (1987,  1990,  2004)  and  Duca  
39:1113:77740:0:28:72:540:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:(forthcoming).    As  illustrated  in  Figure  2,  our  model suggests  that,  absent  the  impact  of  Dodd-
39:1114:77849:28:27:72:542:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:Frank and related regulatory changes, velocity likely would have recovered much as it did during 
39:1115:77946:27:28:72:542:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:the Great Depression.  More specifically, average growth in M2 at a 6.5 percent annual rate since 
39:1116:78044:28:28:72:543:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:onset  of  the  global  financial  crisis  in  2007-08  did  not  translate  into  moderately  strong  nominal  
39:1117:78156:28:27:72:544:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:GDP  growth  in  the  United  States  because  financial  reform  and  risk  premia  effects  worked  to  
39:1118:78262:27:28:72:543:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase money demand and lower velocity.  The estimated speeds of adjustment in our preferred 
39:1119:78357:28:28:72:543:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:model  strongly  suggest  that  further  velocity  declines  from  the  Dodd-Frank  act  are not likely  to 
39:1120:78464:28:27:72:543:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:continue.  Indeed, simulations based on our model estimates indicate that velocity is likely to rise 
39:1121:78565:27:28:72:543:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:toward a somewhat higher equilibrium level in coming years, with dynamic simulations showing 
39:1122:78658:28:27:72:382:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:a smaller and later uptick in velocity than in static simulations.

50:1351:95375:0:37:223:391:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:Appendix A: Mutual Fund Data 
50:1352:95403:37:27:108:544:671:144:Times:144:Times:A:Because  data  before  the  mid-1980s  are  sketchy  and  incomplete,  mutual  fund  cots  were  
50:1353:95500:27:28:72:544:644:144:Times:144:Times:B:based  on  a  sample  of  large  mutual  funds.    Funds  were  selected  if  their  assets  were  at  least  $1  
50:1354:95614:28:28:72:540:616:144:Times:144:Times:B:billion at year-end 1991 if the fund existed before the mid-1980s; were at least $2 billion at year-
50:1355:95714:28:27:72:542:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:end  1994  if  the  fund's  inception  date  occurred  after  1983;  were  at  least  $5  billion  at  year-end 
50:1356:95826:27:28:72:543:561:144:Times:144:Times:B:2003; or were at least $250 million at year-end 1975.  The first criterion reflects whether a fund 
50:1357:95925:28:27:72:545:533:144:Times:144:Times:B:was  sizable  during  early  missing  M2  period  of  the  early  1990s.    The  second  criterion  reflects  
50:1358:96035:27:28:72:544:506:144:Times:144:Times:B:whether  a  growing  but  new  fund  was  large  near  the  end  of  the  missing  M2  period.  The  third  
50:1359:96143:28:28:72:545:478:144:Times:144:Times:B:criterion  reflects  whether  a  fund  remained  large  following  the  stock  market  bust  of  the  early  
50:1360:96252:28:27:72:544:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:2000s.    Given  the  stock  and  bond  appreciation  of  the  early  1990s,  the  hurdles  for  newer  funds  
50:1361:96363:27:28:72:543:423:144:Times:144:Times:B:were higher for the 1994 and 2003 cutoff dates to keep data gathering costs from exploding.  The 
50:1362:96460:28:27:72:547:395:144:Times:144:Times:B:fourth  criterion  avoids  excluding  funds  that  were  relatively  large  in  1975  from  distorting  
50:1363:96564:27:28:72:542:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:averages when fewer funds existed. Also excluded were funds that were closed-end, only open to 
50:1364:96659:28:28:72:545:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:employees  of  a  specific  firm,  or  institutional.    Also  omitted  are  funds  with  high  minimum  
50:1365:96764:28:27:72:543:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:balances (100,000 or more) because such high hurdles make such funds poor substitutes for M2, 
50:1366:96858:27:28:72:544:285:144:Times:144:Times:B:which  is  predominantly  held  by  middle  income  households.    46  non-municipal  bond  and  133  
50:1367:96960:28:27:72:544:257:144:Times:144:Times:B:equity  mutual  funds  are  in  the  sample  (a  list  is  available  from  the  author)  using  data  from  the  
50:1368:97074:27:28:72:543:230:144:Times:144:Times:B:funds  and  various  issues  of  Morningstar,  IBC/Donoghue,  and  CDA/Wiesenberger  (a,  b).  The 
50:1369:97173:28:28:72:544:202:144:Times:144:Times:B:aggregate  load  series  are  based  on  using  the  size  of  net  assets  under  management  of  a  fund  
50:1370:97281:28:27:72:543:174:144:Times:144:Times:B:relative  to  the  sum  of  all  assets  managed  by  funds  in  the  sample.    Year-end  asset  data  are 
50:1371:97389:27:28:72:181:147:144:Times:144:Times:B:available since 1946.   
50:1372:97412:28:27:108:545:119:144:Times:144:Times:A:For  each  year  over  1926-45  we  proxied  asset  weights  on  each  fund  by  its  1946  asset  
50:1373:97511:27:0:72:544:92:144:Times:144:Times:B:weight divided by the sum of all 1946 asset weights for funds that in operation after the year of 
51:1374:97612:0:28:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:their inception.  For the years before and during a fund’s inception its 1946 weight is replaced by 
51:1375:97712:28:27:72:543:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:zero.  These proxied asset weights are combined with front-end loads levied by the funds (there 
51:1376:97808:27:28:71:543:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:were no funds charging deferred or back-end loads until the 1980s).  Since most funds operating 
51:1377:97904:28:28:71:544:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:before  1946  charged  loads  between  6.5  and  8.5  percent,  with  the  largest  fund  (Massachussetts  
51:1378:98011:28:27:71:543:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:Investors Trust) levying 7.5 percent, the annual weighted average load series SLD1 fluctuated in 
51:1379:98108:27:28:71:543:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:a narrow range between 7.5 and 7.8 percent over 1926-45, much as it did over 1946-1959.  This 
51:1380:98202:28:28:72:544:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggests  that  the  use  of  proxied  annual  asset  weights  before  1946  had  a  minimal  effect  on  the  
51:1381:98313:28:27:72:539:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:resulting annual aggregate series. Annual expense ratios before 1946 were not available and pre-
51:1382:98409:27:28:72:543:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:1945 expense ratios were assumed to equal their 1946 levels.  As with the load series, the annual 
51:1383:98507:28:27:72:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:average  expense  ratios  for  1926-45  were  similar  to  those  seen  over  1946-59.      Moreover,  the 
51:1384:98613:27:28:72:544:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:analysis  focuses  on  using  the  load  series  without  expense  ratio  adjustments—as  it  performed  
51:1385:98718:28:28:72:546:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:better  than  an  expense-adjusted  series,  consistent  with  the  non-adjusted  series  entering  the  
51:1386:98823:28:27:72:481:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:money demand (velocity) specifications mainly as a proxy for asset transfer costs.

52:1389:98986:27:27:71:544:681:144:Times:144:Times:B: Conventional  measures  of  the  opportunity  cost  of  M2  equal  an  average  “own  rate”  of  
52:1390:99083:27:28:71:542:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:return on M2 minus a risk-free short-term interest rate.  For the latter we spliced 1927-33 data on 
52:1391:99183:28:28:71:546:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  average  short-term  (three  to  six  months)  Treasury  interest  rate  (NBER  MacroHistory  
52:1392:99282:28:27:71:542:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:DataBase) with the three month Treasury interest rate converted from a discount basis (360 days 
52:1393:99378:27:28:71:542:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:per year) to a 365 day basis.  Consistent measures of the own rate of return on M2 are available 
52:1394:99475:28:28:71:542:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:from 1958 to present (source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis), necessitating the construction 
52:1395:99572:28:27:71:544:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:of  earlier  readings.    Pre-1958  readings  equal  the  non-currency  share  of  M2  multiplied  by  the  
52:1396:99680:27:28:72:543:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:average interest rate paid on deposits at financial intermediaries (banks, S&Ls, credit unions and 
52:1397:99779:28:27:72:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:mutual  savings  banks),  which  in  turn  equals  the  deposit-weighted  average  interest  rate  paid  on

52:1403:100261:27:28:71:542:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:the interest.  Note that the distinction between demand and time deposits was more ambiguous in 
52:1404:100357:28:28:71:543:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  1930s  than  in  more  recent  decades  because  it  was  not  until  the  mid-1930s  that  the  Federal  
52:1405:100468:28:27:71:544:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:Reserve  started  imposing  different  reserve  requirement  ratios  on  the  two  deposit  types.    Hence  
52:1406:100577:27:28:71:544:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  distinction  between  M1  and  nonM1  M2  deposits  was  less  clear-cut  and  this  measurement  
52:1407:100680:28:27:71:543:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:issue was among the reasons Friedman and Schwartz preferred M2 over M1.   Using data from 
52:1408:100770:27:28:71:545:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:active  (i.e.,  not  suspended)  national  bank  mid-year reports  to  the  OCC,  the  average  annual  
52:1409:100874:28:0:71:544:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:interest  rate  on  demand  deposits  equaled  the  total  interest  paid  over  the  prior  12  months  on  
53:1410:100986:0:28:72:545:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:demand  deposits  divided  by  average  of  mid-year  demand  deposit  balances  for  years  t  and  t-1.  
53:1411:101093:28:27:72:511:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:This average rate fell from a peak of 1.21 percent in 1929 to 0.01 in 1938 and 0 thereafter.  
53:1412:101186:27:28:72:544:654:144:Times:144:Times:B: The average annual interest rate on time deposits equaled the total interest paid over the 
53:1413:101277:28:28:72:544:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:prior  12  months  on  time  deposits  divided  by  the  mid-year  total  of  time  deposits  using  national  
53:1414:101388:28:27:72:543:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:bank  mid-year  reports  to  the  OCC  until  1939,  and  from  1940-58  the  average  time  deposit  rate  
53:1415:101496:27:28:72:543:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:equaled the December reported annual total of interest paid divided by the average deposit level 
53:1416:101593:28:28:72:545:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:for  that  year—approximated  by  the  average  of  the  year  t  and  t-1  December  deposit  balances.  
53:1417:101699:28:27:72:544:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:Thrift institutions (mutual savings banks, savings and loans, and credit unions) typically offered 
53:1418:101798:27:28:72:546:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:either  a  common  share  or  several  time  deposit  accounts,  which  typically  offered  somewhat  
53:1419:101900:28:27:72:542:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher interest rates on what are typically classified as time or savings deposits.  The interest rate 
53:1420:102003:27:28:72:544:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:on share deposits at mutual savings banks (MSBs), for example, typically exceeded the average 
53:1421:102097:28:28:72:545:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:time  deposit  rate  paid  at  commercial  banks  using  interest  rate  data  at  MSBs  available  before  
53:1422:102205:28:27:72:543:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:1930 and after 1945.  For this reason, our measure of time deposit rates and the average own rate 
53:1423:102303:27:28:72:544:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:on M2 (available using published data from the OCC up to 1964), while consistently measured 
53:1424:102395:28:27:72:543:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:over   time   for   national   (commercial)   banks,   likely   understates   what   a   more   ideal   and 
53:1425:102503:27:28:72:545:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:comprehensive  series  spanning  commercial  banks  and  thrift  institutions,  such  as  that  from  the  
53:1426:102610:28:28:72:193:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:Federal Reserve System. 
53:1427:102633:28:27:72:540:239:144:Times:144:Times:B: Consistent with this view, overlapping data for the period 1959-61 indicate that our pre-
53:1428:102722:27:28:72:543:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:1958 measure understated M2 own rates by between 0.27 and 0.29 percentage points.  To splice 
53:1429:102815:28:27:72:543:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:the two series, we add the 28 basis point average gap between them for 1959-61 to the pre-1958 
53:1430:102910:27:28:72:544:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:raw average M2 yields.  The resulting series is plotted in Figure 3.  As a check on the splicing, 
53:1431:103008:28:28:72:545:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:we  recalculated  the  average  own  rate  on  M2  using  the  balance-weighted  average  yield  on  
53:1432:103109:28:0:72:528:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:currency, commercial (national bank) and  thrifts using annually data on weights and 1929-32  
54:1433:103205:0:28:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:and 1945-61 published data on MSB average share interest rates.  The two series are plotted in 
54:1434:103300:28:27:71:543:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:Appendix  Table  A1.    The  resulting  difference  between  this  series  and  official  Federal  Reserve  
54:1435:103408:27:28:71:543:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates for the 1959-61 overlap years were between 0.01 and 0.03 percentage points, implying 
54:1436:103503:28:28:71:542:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:that  the  splice  is  reasonable.    In  addition,  the  difference  between  the  spliced  and  MSB-based 
54:1437:103611:28:27:72:543:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:series  was  about  0  between  1927  and  1930  and  1956-61,  with  the  MSB  series  understating  the  
54:1438:103718:27:28:72:544:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:spliced series by between 0.01 and 0.15 percentage points.  Because MSB interest rate data are 
54:1439:103813:28:28:72:545:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:unavailable  for  1933-45  and  do  not  fully  reflect  interest  rates  offered  at  other  types  of  thrift  
54:1440:103926:28:355:71:421:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:institutions, we use the spliced series in Figure 1 as the own rate on M2.
