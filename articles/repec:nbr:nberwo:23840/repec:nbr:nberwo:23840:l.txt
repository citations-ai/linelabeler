2:30:1609:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:This  study  uses  Monte  Carlo  simulations  to  examine  the  ability  of  the  two-stage  least-squares 
2:31:1716:14:14:72:545:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:(2SLS) estimator  and  two-stage  residual  inclusion  (2SRI)  estimators  with  varying  forms  of 
2:32:1815:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:residuals  to  estimate the  local  average  and  population  average  treatment  effect  parameters  in 
2:33:1919:14:14:71:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:models  with  binary  outcome, endogenous  binary  treatment,  and  single  binary  instrument.  The 
2:34:2019:14:14:72:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:rarity of the outcome and the treatment are varied across simulation scenarios. Results show that 
2:35:2116:14:14:72:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:2SLS  generated  consistent  estimates  of  the LATE  and  biased  estimates  of  the  ATE  across  all 
2:36:2219:14:14:72:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:scenarios. 2SRI approaches, in general, produce biased estimates of both LATE and ATE under 
2:37:2310:14:14:72:546:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:all  scenarios.    2SRI  using  generalized  residuals  minimizes the  bias  in  ATE  estimates.  Use  of 
2:38:2415:14:14:72:545:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:2SLS and 2SRI is illustrated in an empirical application estimating the effects of long-term care 
2:39:2512:14:14:72:545:462:12:Times:12:Times:C:insurance on a variety of binary healthcare utilization outcomes among the near-elderly using the

3:63:3080:0:30:72:170:705:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:C:1. INTRODUCTION
3:64:3095:30:18:72:524:675:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Instrumental variables (IV) methods are used to obtain causal estimates of the effects of 
3:65:3183:18:18:72:516:657:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:endogenous variables on outcomes using observational data. These methods mediate 
3:66:3263:18:18:72:505:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:potential bias from unmeasured confounders affecting observed treatment through 
3:67:3343:18:18:72:499:621:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:C:identifying and specifying an instrumental variable, which may represent a “natural 
3:68:3427:18:18:72:494:603:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:experiment” affecting treatment through satisfying two principal assumptions: the 
3:69:3504:18:18:72:508:585:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:instrument is sufficiently correlated with the endogenous variable (strength), and the 
3:70:3590:18:18:72:503:567:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:instrument is uncorrelated with the error term in the outcome equation (validity). IV 
3:71:3675:18:18:72:503:549:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:methods are usually implemented using a two-stage approach where the first-stage 
3:72:3756:18:18:72:477:531:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimates an expectation of the endogenous variable conditional on measured 
3:73:3830:18:18:72:506:513:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:confounders and one or more instrumental variables.  The second stage model then 
3:74:3911:18:18:72:519:495:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:predicts outcomes as a function of the estimated treatment values from the first-stage, 
3:75:3998:18:30:72:398:477:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:measured confounders, and potentially other control variables. 
3:76:4060:30:18:72:523:447:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:In what has been popularly dubbed as the two-stage least-squares (2SLS) approach, the 
3:77:4144:18:18:72:526:429:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:first and second stage models are parametrized using ordinary least squares regression, 
3:78:4231:18:18:72:541:411:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:where the model fit is chosen through minimizing the sum of squared residuals from linear 
3:79:4320:18:18:72:509:393:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:models.  The 2SLS approach is a special case of the more general two-stage predictor 
3:80:4405:18:18:72:528:375:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:substitution (2SPS) method, which follows the procedure described above but may apply 
3:81:4491:18:18:72:531:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:alternative methods for estimating first- and second-stage models.  Alternatively, one can 
3:82:4580:18:18:72:493:339:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:obtain the residuals from the first stage regression and then run the second stage 
3:83:4663:18:18:72:537:321:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:regression with the original endogenous variable, observed confounders and the residuals 
3:84:4751:18:18:72:537:303:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:from the first stage as an added covariate. This approach, known as the two-stage residual 
3:85:4841:18:18:72:533:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:inclusion (2SRI) approach, is analogous to the 2SLS approach when both first- and second-
3:86:4926:18:30:72:200:267:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:stage models are linear.  
3:87:4951:30:18:72:506:237:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:These estimation methods were originally derived in a linear setting with continuous 
3:88:5036:18:18:72:535:219:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:endogenous treatments and continuous outcome measures but are often applied to what 
3:89:5119:18:18:72:508:201:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:may be considered an inherently non-linear setting, such as with binary treatment or 
3:90:5202:18:18:72:502:183:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:outcome measures. However, when treatment (exposure) or outcome is binary and 
3:91:5277:18:18:72:538:165:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:therefore has a conditional expectation that follows a probability scale, a non-linear model 
3:92:5366:18:18:72:501:147:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:featuring a convenient cumulative density function (CDF) is often used to model the 
3:93:5447:18:18:72:521:129:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:conditional mean of the treatment indicator in the first-stage or outcome in the second-
3:94:5533:18:0:72:458:111:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:stage. Popular approaches include using probit or logit regression models.  
4:95:5608:0:18:72:541:705:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:However, complications arise when the outcome in the second stage is binary, and analysts 
4:96:5695:18:18:72:537:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:consider using CDF-based non-linear models.  It is well established that the 2SPS approach 
4:97:5784:18:18:72:506:669:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:produces biased estimates of the population average treatment effect (ATE) in these 
4:98:5866:18:18:72:538:651:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:scenarios (Blundell and Powell 2001; Terza et al. 2008).  Under full parametric assumptions 
4:99:5955:18:18:72:482:633:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of joint-normality, bi-variate probit models can be used to model the two stages 
4:100:6033:18:30:72:291:615:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:simultaneously (Bhattacharya et al. 2006).  
4:101:6076:30:18:72:520:585:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Alternatively, it has been suggested that nonlinear 2SRI is the appropriate approach for 
4:102:6165:18:18:72:535:567:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimation when first- or second-stage models have a dependent variable that is binary or 
4:103:6254:18:18:72:525:549:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:otherwise suited for non-linear regression; especially when full parametric assumptions, 
4:104:6343:18:18:72:501:531:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:where statistical joint distribution of error terms of the exposure and outcomes are 
4:105:6428:18:18:72:522:513:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:specified, are not wanted (Blundell and Powell 2003, 2004; Terza et al. 2008).  Nonlinear 
4:106:6518:18:18:72:500:495:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:2SRI methods identify the ATE through relying on the concepts that support control 
4:107:6598:18:18:72:542:477:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:function methods (Blundell and Powell 2003, 2004), which were developed in the context of 
4:108:6687:18:18:72:533:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:continuous endogenous variables.  However, the applicability of nonlinear 2SRI to models 
4:109:6772:18:30:72:375:441:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with binary endogenous treatments remains contentious.   
4:110:6825:30:18:72:542:411:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:An important source of further complexity and potential confusion in comparisons of these 
4:111:6915:18:18:72:515:393:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimates is that the specific treatment effect parameter identified by the 2SLS or 2SRI 
4:112:7002:18:18:72:514:375:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:approaches may differ and depends on whether treatment effects are heterogeneous 
4:113:7082:18:18:72:534:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:across the population and vary across levels of observed or unobserved confounders (aka 
4:114:7170:18:18:72:498:339:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:essential heterogeneity). In such a situation, it is well–established that traditional IV 
4:115:7260:18:18:72:535:321:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:approaches such as 2SLS identify an average treatment effect across only the subgroup of 
4:116:7349:18:18:72:531:303:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:C:“marginal” individuals whose treatment choices were affected by changes in the specified 
4:117:7438:18:18:72:533:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:instrumental variable(s) (Heckman 1997; Heckman et al. 2006, Basu et al. 2007). When the 
4:118:7526:18:18:72:537:267:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:instrumental variable is binary (which is the focus of this paper), this effect is known as the 
4:119:7622:18:18:72:498:249:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:local average treatment effect (LATE) (Imbens and Angrist 1994). Both 2SLS and the 
4:120:7704:18:18:72:526:231:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:analogous strictly linear application of 2SRI will generate consistent estimates of LATE as 
4:121:7796:18:30:72:446:213:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:long as the linear mean model specifications in both stages are correct.1  
4:122:7868:30:18:72:506:183:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Terza et al. (2007, 2008) claimed that nonlinear 2SRI, but not 2SLS or 2SPS, produced 
4:123:7952:18:18:72:514:165:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:consistent estimates of ATE in models with inherently nonlinear dependent variables.  
4:124:8038:18:27:72:532:147:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:However, it is not clear which treatment effect parameter is being estimated under a 2SRI

4:126:8184:8:15:72:504:112:6:Times:10:Times:F:1 The LATE effect is non-parametrically identified in a 2SLS setting within any cell defined by levels of all 
4:127:8293:15:12:72:522:97:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:observed covariates X (Imbens and Angrist 1994). However, in a regression setting with many X’s, where a full 
4:128:8403:12:11:72:533:85:10:Times:10:Times:F:saturated model is typically not used, the consistency of estimating LATE would rely on the appropriateness of the 
4:129:8517:11:0:72:182:74:10:Times:10:Times:F:linear model specification.  
5:130:8546:0:18:72:506:705:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:approach for a binary treatment. Particularly in applications with binary IVs, the 2SRI 
5:131:8633:18:18:72:539:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:approach relies on functional form assumptions for identification (as explained below) that 
5:132:8724:18:18:72:533:669:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are difficult to test in most applied setting and many analysts, especially economists, have 
5:133:8816:18:18:72:532:651:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:favored the 2SLS approach regardless of whether treatment and outcome are continuous 
5:134:8900:18:18:72:541:633:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:or binary. As such, many questions remain about the best approaches to IV estimation with 
5:135:8986:18:18:72:521:615:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:such data. On the one hand, linear probability models may not provide a good fit to the 
5:136:9068:18:18:72:531:597:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:data, especially when treatment or outcome variables are “rare” or otherwise imbalanced 
5:137:9155:18:18:72:522:579:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in nature, which in turn may lead to imprecise estimates. On the other hand, probit and 
5:138:9240:18:18:72:493:561:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:logit models may provide a better fit to observed data overall but generate biased 
5:139:9319:18:30:72:477:543:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimates depending on the support of the residual distribution (across all X’s). 
5:140:9399:30:18:72:542:513:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:For example, Chapman and Brooks showed that small changes to the simulation settings of 
5:141:9487:18:18:72:541:495:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Terza et al. (2007) resulted in different results and conclusions about the properties of 2SLS 
5:142:9579:18:18:72:540:477:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and 2SRI.  They showed that 2SLS produced consistent estimates of LATE across alternative 
5:143:9669:18:18:72:523:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:scenarios while 2SRI estimates were not consistent for either ATE or LATE. However, the 
5:144:9757:18:18:72:501:441:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:evidence produced by Chapman and Brooks is limited in that their scenarios all had 
5:145:9839:18:18:72:534:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:treatment and outcome rates near 50%, a setting that may have inadvertently favored the 
5:146:9926:18:30:72:145:405:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:2SLS method. 
5:147:9938:30:18:72:527:375:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Moreover, there is a debate in the health econometrics literature about the right form of 
5:148:10028:18:18:72:521:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the residual to be used in 2SRI approaches. Garrido et al. (2012) compared results from 
5:149:10116:18:18:72:532:339:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:2SRI models with different versions of residuals when applied to health expenditure data. 
5:150:10205:18:18:72:524:321:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:They found that results varied widely depending on the type of residuals they use in the 
5:151:10293:18:18:72:511:303:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:second stage. They raised the concern that raw residuals may not be the right control 
5:152:10379:18:18:72:523:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:function variable. However, there is no theoretical rationale as to why different forms of 
5:153:10468:18:30:72:490:267:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the residual matter, nor did they do any simulations to show which one is better.  
5:154:10547:30:18:72:492:237:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:In this paper, we try to provide theoretical and empirical evidence to inform these 
5:155:10629:18:18:72:518:219:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:debates.2 We study a simple scenario with a binary outcome, a binary treatment that is 
5:156:10710:18:18:72:514:201:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:made endogenous by a continuous unobserved confounder, binary instrument, and a 
5:157:10790:18:18:72:517:183:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:binary measured confounder.  After a theoretical discussion on the expected effects of 
5:158:10876:18:23:72:508:165:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:alternative estimators, we study the properties of 2SLS and alternative 2SRI methods

5:160:11018:10:17:72:515:132:6:Times:12:g_d0_f10:C:2 There are other forms of estimators that deal with a binary outcome and a binary endogenous 
5:161:11111:17:13:72:529:115:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f10:C:treatment model, such as a GMM approaches (McCarthy and Tchernis 2011) and semi-parametric 
5:162:11202:13:14:72:533:102:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f10:C:estimators (Abadie 2003; Abrevaya et al. 2009, Chiburis 2010; Shaikh and Vytlacil 2011). However, 
5:163:11300:14:13:72:525:88:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f10:C:these estimators are not as popular as the 2SLS and the 2SRI approaches and so we do not cover 
5:164:11394:13:0:72:161:75:12:g_d0_f10:10:Times:C:them in this paper. 
6:165:11414:0:18:72:517:705:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:across a range of scenarios where the rarity of the treatment and/or the outcomes are 
6:166:11499:18:30:72:368:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:varied using extensive Monte-Carlo simulation exercises.  
6:167:11555:30:18:72:529:657:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Results show that the 2SLS method with binary IV produced consistent estimates of LATE 
6:168:11638:18:18:72:528:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:across the entire range of rarity for either treatment or the outcome.  The rarity of either 
6:169:11731:18:18:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:did not affect the coverage probabilities of these estimators. In contrast, the 2SRI approach 
6:170:11824:18:18:72:517:603:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with any residuals studied was a biased estimator for LATE. In principle, nonlinear 2SRI 
6:171:11911:18:18:72:525:585:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimators are designed to estimate the ATE parameter. However, 2SRI estimates of ATE 
6:172:11997:18:18:72:518:567:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:were also generally biased, with the level of bias varying by residual form and outcome 
6:173:12084:18:18:72:509:549:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rarity. Amongst 2SRI models, those using generalized residuals were most often least 
6:174:12164:18:18:72:511:531:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:biased in estimating ATE, though 2SRI with Anscombe residuals generated less biased 
6:175:12247:18:18:72:516:513:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimates in scenarios with very rare outcomes (<5%). Implications of these results are 
6:176:12333:18:30:72:128:495:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:discussed. 
6:177:12343:30:18:72:507:465:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Finally, we examined the implications of model choice using an empirical setting that 
6:178:12428:18:18:72:523:447:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:resembles the simulated scenario with endogenous binary treatment, binary outcomes, 
6:179:12510:18:18:72:531:429:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and binary observable confounders.  The alternative instrumental variable methods were 
6:180:12595:18:18:72:504:411:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:applied to evaluate the effect of long-term care insurance on a variety of health care 
6:181:12681:18:18:72:521:393:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:utilization outcomes using tax treatment as an instrument for long-term care insurance 
6:182:12767:18:18:72:513:375:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:holding, as has been validated in the literature (Goda 2011; Konetzka, et al. 2014, Coe,

6:187:13014:30:30:72:316:249:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Consider the binary structural response model  
6:188:13060:30:30:72:525:219:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B: yi = 1{yi* >0} ,           ( 1 ) 
6:189:13079:30:30:72:393:189:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:where the latent variable yi* follows a linear model of the form 
6:190:13141:30:30:72:525:159:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B: yi* = xiβ + ui,          ( 2 ) 
6:191:13158:30:18:72:541:129:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:where xi is a row vector of covariates and ui is a stochastic disturbance term for individual i. 
6:192:13250:18:18:72:538:111:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Throughout this section, bold-face is used to represent a vector. If ui is independent of xi, a 
6:193:13340:18:0:72:272:93:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:single index regression model such as: 
7:194:13379:0:30:72:525:705:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B: E(yi |xi) = G(xiβ)     G(a) = Pr{ui > -a)      ( 3 ) 
7:195:13420:30:18:72:541:675:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:can be used to obtain consistent estimates of β. However, it may often be the case that ui is 
7:196:13513:18:18:72:533:657:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:not independent of xi because some component of xi , say di, is determined jointly with yi* 
7:197:13601:18:30:72:122:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:such that 
7:198:13610:30:30:108:525:609:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f4:A:xi  = (di, wi), yi = 1{diβ1 +wiβ2 + ui>0}, and di ui,     ( 4 )

7:201:13800:30:31:72:227:531:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B: di  = E(di|wi, zi) + vi

7:203:13841:29:18:72:501:471:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:where zi = vector of instrumental variables, λ is the true function through which di is 
7:204:13927:18:18:72:493:453:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:determined by wi and zi, vi is a stochastic disturbance term, and E(vi | wi, zi) = 0 by 
7:205:14010:18:18:72:524:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:construction. It is assumed throughout that expectation of d is a non-trivial function of z 
7:206:14099:18:30:72:120:417:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:given w.  
7:207:14108:30:18:72:498:387:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:For evaluation research, interest generally lies in estimating β parameters or, more 
7:208:14188:18:18:72:532:369:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:specifically, the components of β that represent the causal effect of an exogenous shift in 
7:209:14276:18:18:72:516:351:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:treatment, di, on the response probabilities. The interpretation of those parameters of 
7:210:14361:18:18:72:517:333:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:interest then must be considered.  The broadest and perhaps most intuitive treatment 
7:211:14446:18:18:72:539:315:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:effect parameter is the average treatment effect (ATE), which represents the mean change in 
7:212:14530:18:18:72:521:297:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:an outcome that would be realized if everyone in a target population changed from not 
7:213:14612:18:31:72:432:279:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:receiving treatment to receiving treatment. The ATE can be written as  
7:214:14679:31:34:72:543:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B: ATE(w)  = ∫{E(yi|퐰퐢,ui,di=1)−E(yi|퐰퐢,ui,di=0)}∙dF(u|w)푢∈푈|풘   
7:215:14736:34:30:180:525:214:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:=  G(β1 +wiβw)  -  G(wiβw)      ( 6 ) 
7:216:14765:30:18:72:539:184:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:where ATE (w) represents the conditional average treatment effect for a sample, which may 
7:217:14852:18:30:72:286:166:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:be distinct in the mix of characteristics w. 
7:218:14895:30:18:72:515:136:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:If it is the case that treatment effects are heterogenous across the population and this 
7:219:14982:18:18:72:532:118:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:heterogeneity is related to treatment choice (i.e., essential heterogeneity), then treatment 
7:220:15074:18:18:72:514:100:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:effectiveness will vary over levels of ui when components of w are unmeasured by the 
7:221:15156:18:0:72:533:82:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:researcher (i.e., there are unmeasured confounders).  As a result, identification of ATE will 
8:222:15249:0:18:72:530:705:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:require strong assumptions.  First, the ATE can be estimated through identification of the 
8:223:15340:18:18:72:533:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:function represented by G(.), which is to akin to identifying the full parametric distribution 
8:224:15434:18:18:72:522:669:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of ui.  In the absence of full parametric assumptions, the ATE can be identified in special 
8:225:15523:18:18:72:514:651:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:cases using instrumental variables methods, where the specified IV(s) fully identify the 
8:226:15609:18:18:72:524:633:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:conditional distribution of ui | vi, which can then be integrated over the distribution of vi 
8:227:15699:18:18:72:524:615:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:identified in the IV-based first-stage model.  More simply put, the specified IV(s) must be 
8:228:15790:18:18:72:518:597:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:considered as potentially influencing treatment choice for all types of individuals in the 
8:229:15877:18:18:72:508:579:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sample, defined by their levels of observed and unobserved characteristics.  These IV 
8:230:15963:18:18:72:541:561:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:assumptions may be particularly difficult to satisfy when a single binary instrument is used, 
8:231:16055:18:30:72:519:543:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:as only two points of support in the distribution of vi are identified non-parametrically.  
8:232:16143:30:18:72:530:513:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:More generally, as Imbens and Angrist (1994) have shown, the IV effect estimated using a 
8:233:16231:18:30:72:530:495:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:single binary IV, zi, is referred to as the local average treatment effect (LATE) and is given as: 
8:234:16326:30:30:72:525:465:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B: LATE(w) = (E(yi |wi, zi =1) - E(yi |wi, zi =0)) / (E(di |wi, zi =1) - E(di |wi, zi =0)) ( 7 ) 
8:235:16406:30:18:72:504:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The LATE reflects the average causal effect of di on the probability of yi among those 
8:236:16490:18:18:72:529:417:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(marginal) individuals whose treatment statuses would likely change with a change in the 
8:237:16578:18:18:72:534:399:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:level of the instrumental variable (Angrist & Imbens 1994, 1996; Heckman 1997). The LATE 
8:238:16664:18:18:72:524:381:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:parameter is only “locally” interpretable in the context of the instrument specified.  Even 
8:239:16754:18:18:72:532:363:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with  very strong instruments that lead all patients in the sample to be marginal, LATE will 
8:240:16846:18:18:72:514:345:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:not often converge to the ATE because, unlike randomization, the instrument may put 
8:241:16929:18:18:72:533:327:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:more weight on some marginal patient than others.  Therefore, since it is often difficult to 
8:242:17021:18:18:72:510:309:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:identify the marginal patients directly (i.e., to know for whom the instrument affected 
8:243:17109:18:18:72:514:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:choice), it may also be difficult to understand to whom the estimate applies (Heckman 
8:244:17191:18:18:72:514:273:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:1997; Newhouse and McClellan, 1998).  In some cases where a binary IV is related to a 
8:245:17276:18:18:72:494:255:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:specific policy, LATE may be interpretable as the effect of changing di among those 
8:246:17356:18:18:72:540:237:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:individuals who would be induced to change their treatment status by the policy (Heckman 
8:247:17442:18:18:72:526:219:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:et al. 2006). Naturally, if the true treatment effect is constant then the true LATE and ATE 
8:248:17531:18:30:72:147:201:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are the same.  
8:249:17545:30:18:72:514:171:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The following discussion focuses on three popular approaches for estimation of mean 
8:250:17627:18:18:72:498:153:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:effects on response probabilities from an instrument-driven exogenous shift in the 
8:251:17707:18:18:72:500:135:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:treatment di: the fully parametric bivariate probit (BVP) model, the semi-parametric 
8:252:17792:18:18:72:536:117:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:residual inclusion (2SRI) approach, and the linear two-stage least squares (2SLS) approach. 
8:253:17880:18:18:72:522:99:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Each of these methods employs different assumptions and attempt to identify different 
8:254:17965:18:0:72:504:81:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:parameters. In fact, Chiburis et al. (2012) have argued that many of the documented 
9:255:18050:0:18:72:538:705:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:differences in the treatment effect estimates from 2SLS and bi-variate probit models in the 
9:256:18141:18:18:72:537:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:literature may be driven by the fact that they are estimating different parameters, to begin 
9:257:18232:18:30:72:316:669:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with. We now look at these estimators in detail. 
9:258:18279:30:30:72:75:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B: 
9:259:18279:30:30:72:371:609:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:C:2.1 Approach 1 (Fully parametric): e.g. Bivariate-Probit 
9:260:18333:30:18:72:525:579:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:If the joint distribution of the structural error term ui and the reduced form error term vi 
9:261:18424:18:18:72:534:561:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:were parametrically specified (e.g., Gaussian), and λ(wi, zi) is parametrically specified, then 
9:262:18517:18:30:72:416:543:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:under some normalization of the Var(ui) (Blundell and Smith 1986), 
9:263:18582:30:30:72:340:513:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B: E(yi | di, wi, vi)  = Pr( ui > -diβ1 - wiβ2 |vi) 
9:264:18623:30:30:72:525:483:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:    = (diβ1 +wiβ2 +ρvi),      ( 8 ) 
9:265:18646:30:18:72:541:453:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:where ρ is the vector of population regression coefficients of ui on vi. The parameters β, λ(.) 
9:266:18738:18:18:72:516:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and ρ can be estimated using maximum likelihood estimation. When both yi and di are 
9:267:18817:18:18:72:524:417:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:binary, this approach can be implemented using a bivariate probit regression (Heckman 
9:268:18902:18:18:72:518:399:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:1978).  However, bivariate probit models can be sensitive to heteroscedasticity and are 
9:269:18988:18:18:72:534:381:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:usually more robust when treatment probabilities approach 0 or 1 (Chiburis et al. 2012). If 
9:270:19078:18:18:72:527:363:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the underlying distributions are correctly specified, this method structurally recovers the 
9:271:19168:18:18:72:490:345:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:average treatment effect (ATE) parameter since ui | vi, identified through the IV, is 
9:272:19250:18:30:72:383:327:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:structurally linked to ui through the parametric assumption.  
9:273:19310:30:18:72:498:297:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The sample analog for the population treatment effect parameter identified by this 
9:274:19392:18:30:72:182:279:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:approach is given by: 
9:275:19413:30:30:108:525:249:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f4:A:E퐖{Ev̂{(1∙β̂1+퐰퐢훃̂ퟐ +ρ̂∙v̂i) - (0∙β̂1+퐰퐢훃̂ퟐ +ρ̂∙v̂i) }},   ( 9 ) 
9:276:19470:30:30:72:498:219:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:where ∙̂ indicates that these quantities have been estimated from the data at hand. 
9:277:19551:30:30:72:75:189:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:C: 
9:278:19551:30:30:72:305:159:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:C:2.2 Approach 2 (Semi-parametric): e.g 2SRI 
9:279:19590:30:18:72:543:129:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The semi-parametric approach uses estimates of the reduced form error term, vi, to control 
9:280:19679:18:18:72:517:111:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for endogeneity of di in the outcomes structural model (Blundell and Powell 2004). The 
9:281:19765:18:0:72:485:93:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:identification of β1 and the distribution functions of the error term, ui, is through 
10:282:19849:0:18:72:542:705:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:distributional exclusion restrictions, the first of which requires that the dependence of ui on 
10:283:19941:18:30:72:506:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:each of di, wi and zi are completely characterized by the reduced form error vector vi: 
10:284:20024:30:30:72:472:657:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B: ui | di, wi, zi ~ ui | di, wi, vi          
10:285:20053:30:30:180:531:627:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:~ ui | vi        ( 10 ) 
10:286:20066:30:30:72:197:597:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Under this assumption,  
10:287:20089:30:30:72:303:567:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:E(yi |di, wi, vi)  = Pr[ui ≤ - diβ1 - wiβ2 | di, wi, vi] 
10:288:20137:30:30:72:531:537:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:   = F(diβ1 + wiβ2 | vi).       ( 11 ) 
10:289:20161:30:30:72:314:507:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:where F(.) is the conditional c.d.f. of -ui given vi. 
10:290:20213:30:18:72:541:477:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The marginal distribution function G(.) with respect to -ui could be identified using a control 
10:291:20306:18:30:72:351:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:function approach such as (Blundell and Powell 2004): 
10:292:20358:30:30:72:531:429:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B: G(diβ1 + wiβ2) = ∫F(d푖β1 + 퐰풊훃ퟐ ,v1)H푉 ,      ( 12 ) 
10:293:20397:30:18:72:519:399:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:where Hv is the distribution function of v. Consequently, ATE can be identified using (6). 
10:294:20484:18:18:72:534:381:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Note that, unlike the fully parametric approach, one can be agnostic about the parametric 
10:295:20573:18:18:72:521:363:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:distribution of ui and vi as long as the distributional exclusion criterion is met. However, 
10:296:20663:18:18:72:492:345:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:Blundell and Powell’s (2003) identification relies on a continuous vi. Moreover, the 
10:297:20747:18:18:72:497:327:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:identification of ATE relies on the fact that the error term in the outcomes model is 
10:298:20833:18:18:72:538:309:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:additively separable. These conditions allow for a counterfactual to be determined without 
10:299:20922:18:18:72:530:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the need for any additional functional form assumptions given that the β are consistently 
10:300:21010:18:18:72:509:273:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimated. However, in non-linear models, such as those in (2), these counterfactuals 
10:301:21094:18:30:72:474:255:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:inherently depend on the functional form assumption of the control function.  
10:302:21171:30:18:72:535:225:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:For example, in practice, this approach is implemented through “residual inclusion”, which 
10:303:21260:18:18:72:519:207:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:follows estimating the error term in the first–stage regression and then including these 
10:304:21349:18:18:72:519:189:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimated residuals as a covariate in the second-stage outcomes regression. A recycled 
10:305:21436:18:30:72:496:171:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:predictions approach can then be used to recover the marginal effect of di on E(yi). 
10:306:21519:30:18:72:533:141:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:However, when implementing this approach for a binary treatment variable, the residuals 
10:307:21606:18:18:72:538:123:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:from the first stage would always be positive for treatment recipients and negative for non-
10:308:21698:18:18:72:506:105:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:recipients.  Hence, in a non-linear outcomes model, the conditional treatment effect, 
10:309:21782:18:0:72:518:87:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:conditional on any level of the estimated vi (say, v̂푖), must be obtained via extrapolation. 
11:310:21874:0:18:72:508:705:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Figure 1 illustrates this idea for a group of individuals with the same wi, which is kept 
11:311:21964:18:18:72:526:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:implicit, but different values of zi. Suppose the residuals among treatment recipients are 
11:312:22055:18:18:72:486:669:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.7 and those among non-recipients are -0.1, -0.2, -0.3, -0.4, -0.7. 
11:313:22144:18:18:72:515:651:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Conditional on a positive level of the residual vi+, E(y|d=1, v̂푖+) = E((y1|  v̂푖+) is obtained 
11:314:22238:18:18:72:482:633:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:from the data where y1 is the potential outcome under treatment. However, the 
11:315:22315:18:18:72:535:615:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:counterfactual outcome, i.e. th,e corresponding potential outcome y0 under no treatment, 
11:316:22402:18:18:72:530:597:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is not observed in the data as there are no non-recipients that have a positive level of the 
11:317:22493:18:18:72:536:579:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:residual by construction. The counterfactual outcome has to be obtained via extrapolation 
11:318:22582:18:18:72:525:561:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of the functional specification of F(), which in turn determines the estimate for β1. Figure 
11:319:22672:18:18:72:542:543:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:1(a) illustrates this extrapolation. The overall treatment effect is then obtained by averaging 
11:320:22766:18:30:72:433:525:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the conditional treatment effects obtained over the distribution of  v̂푖.  
11:321:22838:30:18:72:527:495:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Symmetry in the distribution of  v̂푖, to the extent that it can be attained, can facilitate this 
11:322:22933:18:18:72:509:477:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:extrapolation. Most forms of residuals used in non-linear settings attempt to mimic a 
11:323:23018:18:18:72:490:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:normal distribution. Alternate forms of residuals, such as standardized, deviance, 
11:324:23101:18:18:72:513:441:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Anscombe, and generalized (Gourieroux et.al., 1987), may also be used in the residual 
11:325:23187:18:18:72:514:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:inclusion approach and have been explored Garrido et al. 2012). When estimated by a 
11:326:23270:18:18:72:512:405:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:nonlinear approach, such as probit or logit, raw-scale residuals for a binary treatment 
11:327:23358:18:18:72:539:387:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:variable will always lie between 0 and 1 in absolute values. Therefore, each type of residual 
11:328:23451:18:18:72:532:369:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:transformation is likely to spread the support of the residual distribution on the real line.  
11:329:23544:18:18:72:522:351:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:For example, if predicted Pr(d|z)  = 0.4 and 0.7 for two observations with d = 1, then the 
11:330:23635:18:18:72:526:333:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:raw-scale residuals will be 0.6 and 0.3 respectively, but the standardized residuals (= (d – 
11:331:23725:18:18:72:517:315:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f4:B:p̂(z))/√( p̂(z)(1−p̂(z))   ) will be 1.22 and 0.65 respectively.  Consequently, standardized 
11:332:23814:18:18:72:518:297:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:residuals may provide a better fit to the outcomes data and increase the robustness of 
11:333:23897:18:18:72:533:279:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:extrapolations. For example, when the treatment is rare, the raw-scale residuals on either 
11:334:23986:18:18:72:521:261:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the negative or the positive side are likely to be far away from zero. Transformation can 
11:335:24075:18:18:72:495:243:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:help these residuals to spread out, so as to increase accuracy when estimating the

11:337:24246:18:18:72:539:207:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:predict what form of residuals from a binary treatment model would best approximate the 
11:338:24334:18:30:72:343:189:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:non-separable error term in the outcomes equation. 
11:339:24384:30:18:72:540:159:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:It is worth reiterating that a central problem, beyond the issue of non-overlap in support of 
11:340:24477:18:18:72:536:141:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f4:B:v̂푖 as discussed above, when the instrumental variable is also binary is that only two points

11:342:24659:18:30:72:311:105:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:only on those two points in the support for  v̂푖.

12:344:24709:0:30:72:306:705:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:C:2.3 Approach 3 (Non-parametric): e.g. 2SLS 
12:345:24750:30:18:72:541:675:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Distinct from BVP and 2SRI approaches discussed above, which are designed to identify the 
12:346:24840:18:18:72:504:657:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ATE, a 2SLS approach is designed to estimate the LATE parameter.  A 2SLS approach 
12:347:24920:18:18:72:538:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:attempts to estimate the LATE from the data non-parametrically by estimating the slope of 
12:348:25010:18:18:72:511:621:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:outcomes and exposure, conditional on the instrument.  In the case of a single binary 
12:349:25096:18:18:72:533:603:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:instrument, this slope is based upon the two points of support identified by the two levels 
12:350:25186:18:18:72:495:585:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of the instrument. That is, it plugs in the sample analogs of the numerator and the 
12:351:25266:18:18:72:524:567:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:denominator in the LATE parameter defined above. However, this process assumes that 
12:352:25349:18:18:72:538:549:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the mean outcomes and the exposure models are linear in terms of wi.3 When one or both 
12:353:25434:18:18:72:537:531:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of these linear specifications are violated, 2SLS may be a biased estimator for the outcome 
12:354:25523:18:18:72:501:513:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:probabilities (Horace and Oaxaca 2006).  While this could, in turn, induce bias in the 
12:355:25606:18:18:72:535:495:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimation of LATE, some have suggested that risk of such bias is minimal in many applied 
12:356:25696:18:30:72:428:477:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:settings and concerns are exaggerated. (Angrist, Fernandez-Val 2001) 
12:357:25764:30:18:72:531:447:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The 2SLS approach of linear IV models can be viewed as a special case of control function 
12:358:25852:18:18:72:539:429:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:methods (Telser 1964), where both first and second stage regressions are linear.  However, 
12:359:25942:18:18:72:537:411:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:since 2SLS approaches rely only on mean–independence requirements, and not on the full 
12:360:26026:18:18:72:532:393:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:B:conditional independence of the distribution as in (8), demands the “correct” specification 
12:361:26118:18:18:72:536:375:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of the first-stage to provide consistent estimates of the second-stage parameters (Blundell 
12:362:26209:18:18:72:533:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and Powell, 2004). However, this requirement seems to apply mostly for the estimation of 
12:363:26296:18:18:72:523:339:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ATE; as the LATE value is not necessarily equivalent or determined by the true structural 
12:364:26382:18:18:72:528:321:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:parameters under essential heterogeneity. It is unclear how violation of this requirement 
12:365:26472:18:18:72:523:303:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:affects the estimation of LATE. We expect that for a binary treatment in the first stage, a 
12:366:26561:18:18:72:520:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:linear approximation of the conditional mean is likely to be most appropriate when the 
12:367:26646:18:18:72:537:267:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:mean treatment is close to 50%. Chapman and Brooks (2016) demonstrates that this is the 
12:368:26734:18:30:72:233:249:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:case through their simulations. 
12:369:26765:30:18:72:537:219:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:These discussions establish the rationale for the simulations in this paper. It is conjectured 
12:370:26857:18:18:72:518:201:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that 2SRI approach applied to binary endogenous variables can produce biased results 
12:371:26941:18:18:72:503:183:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:when extrapolations are not appropriate. Alternative versions of the residuals could 
12:372:27023:18:18:72:526:165:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:improve the performance of 2SRI approaches through mutating the scale of the residual 
12:373:27105:18:18:72:498:147:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:distribution used, which could influence the estimation of the underlying structural 
12:374:27187:18:20:72:513:129:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:functions through the 2SRI approach as was observed in Garrido et al. (2012). Second,

12:376:27330:9:15:72:503:100:6:Times:10:Times:F:3 There can certainly be a more elaborate model building exercise that can overcome this problem, but such 
12:377:27436:15:11:72:530:85:10:Times:10:Times:F:exercises are seldom found in the economics and health economics literature. In any case, such exercises typically 
12:378:27551:11:0:72:388:74:10:Times:10:Times:F:lead one away from a simple linear model into the realm of non-linear models. 
13:379:27629:0:18:72:530:705:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:when the endogenous binary variable becomes rare, the linear model specification in the 
13:380:27716:18:18:72:533:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:first-stage could break down, resulting in a biased estimation of second-stage parameters 
13:381:27802:18:18:72:529:669:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in the 2SLS approach. These biases could then compound biases from misfit of the linear 
13:382:27887:18:30:72:307:651:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:B:model to rare outcomes in the second-stage.

13:385:27945:30:18:72:541:561:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We consider the simplest case where we have a binary outcome (yi), a binary treatment (di),

13:387:28127:18:18:72:533:525:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that the residuals from the first stage regression have at least thirty unique values in their 
13:388:28221:18:18:72:515:507:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:support. The central questions we try to answer with these simulations are: Can linear 
13:389:28307:18:18:72:541:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:approximation (2SLS) provide consistent estimates of the LATE for a binary outcome/binary 
13:390:28395:18:18:72:495:471:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:endogenous variable model? What form of residuals are most suited to a correctly 
13:391:28474:18:18:72:532:453:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:specified nonlinear 2SRI (Probit-Probit) approach? How do the results change if outcomes

15:457:32241:30:18:108:519:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Descriptive statistics for our DGPs are provided in Table 1. As expected, the true 
15:458:32323:18:18:72:536:273:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:mean average treatment effect (ATE) parameter values varied across scenarios varying the 
15:459:32411:18:18:72:533:255:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:intercept in the outcome models, β 0, but not across scenarios varying the intercept in the 
15:460:32502:18:18:72:511:237:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:treatment models. LATE, however, varies with the intercepts in both the outcome and 
15:461:32586:18:18:72:540:219:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:treatment choice models. As outcomes become rare, following an underlying probit model, 
15:462:32672:18:30:72:223:201:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:both ATE and LATE decrease. 
15:463:32699:30:18:108:539:171:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Simulation results are presented in Tables 2 and 3. Table 2 reports percent bias, the 
15:464:32777:18:18:72:527:153:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:coefficient of variation, and coverage probabilities on the LATE. We find that 2SLS always 
15:465:32865:18:18:72:519:135:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:provides consistent estimates of LATE, irrespective of the treatment rarity or outcomes 
15:466:32952:18:18:72:528:117:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rarity. This indicates that 2SLS can consistently estimate the LATE effect even if the linear 
15:467:33044:18:0:72:526:99:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:probability model misfits the data and produces out of range predictions. Results do not 
16:468:33133:0:18:72:525:705:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:show any major drop in coverage probabilities for LATE across simulation design points. 
16:469:33221:18:30:72:520:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Estimates from nonlinear 2SRI and bi-variate probit were generally biased for the LATE. 
16:470:33306:30:18:108:532:657:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Table 3 reports percent bias, the coefficient of variation and coverage probabilities 
16:471:33386:18:18:72:542:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on the ATE. As expected, given the DGPs, bi-variate probit always produced the least biased 
16:472:33475:18:18:72:535:621:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimates of the ATE.  Also as expected, 2SLS produced biased estimates of ATE, especially 
16:473:33563:18:18:72:498:603:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:as the ATE and LATE became increasingly distinct in value with rarer treatment and 
16:474:33646:18:18:72:512:585:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:outcome. Results showed that all of the 2SRI estimators produced substantially larger 
16:475:33729:18:18:72:511:567:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:biases (and poor coverage probabilities) than bi-variate probit in estimating ATE.  This 
16:476:33813:18:18:72:522:549:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:highlights the difficulty of estimating the ATE through extrapolation using the first-stage 
16:477:33905:18:18:72:497:531:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:residuals. Among the residual inclusion approaches, 2SRI with generalized residual 
16:478:33987:18:18:72:472:513:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:appeared to have the least bias in estimating ATE in most cases. However, the 
16:479:34065:18:30:72:320:495:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:corresponding coverage probabilities were low.  
16:480:34111:30:18:108:532:465:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:One interesting observation was that, for rare outcomes (such as those below 5%), 
16:481:34190:18:18:72:518:447:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:2SRI with Anscombe residuals produced the least bias in estimating ATE, with coverage 
16:482:34276:18:18:72:542:429:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:probabilities close to 95% in each case. The coverage probabilities did not deteriorate when 
16:483:34367:18:18:72:526:411:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:treatment also became rare. This may indicate that the Anscombe transformation of the 
16:484:34451:18:18:72:526:393:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:first-stage residuals are helping to approximate better the distribution of ui|vi where the 
16:485:34540:18:30:72:511:375:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:outcomes are rare and, therefore, abetting the extrapolation for the counterfactuals.  
16:486:34624:30:18:108:534:345:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Results for patterns of bias with 2SLS and 2SRI held similar for the simulations with 
16:487:34710:18:30:72:345:327:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a sample size of 5000 (Appendix Tables A2 and A3).

16:490:34783:30:18:72:535:237:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B: To illustrate the potential impact of the estimation method on empirical results, we 
16:491:34868:18:18:72:512:219:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:use the case of long-term care insurance (LTCI) and its impact on long-term care (LTC) 
16:492:34954:18:18:72:531:201:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:utilization.  This issue has been studied by Konetzka, He, Guo and Nyman (2014) and Coe, 
16:493:35043:18:18:72:490:183:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Goda and Van Houtven (2015).  This application is fitting to illustrate the concepts 
16:494:35128:18:18:72:526:165:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:examined in the simulation models, as it is characterized by: 1) a relatively low E(Y) -- few 
16:495:35221:18:18:72:499:147:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:elderly hold long-term care insurance; 2) an empirically strong and widely accepted 
16:496:35305:18:18:72:527:129:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:instrumental variable – state tax policies that reduce the cost of insurance influence LTCI 
16:497:35395:18:30:72:378:111:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:holding; and 3) multiple outcomes, at varying means Pr(Y).   
16:498:35455:30:0:72:119:81:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:C:4.1 Data 
17:499:35465:0:18:90:530:705:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Three main data sources were used, following Coe, Goda and Van Houtven (2015):  (1) 
17:500:35547:18:18:72:408:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) (including RAND versions) 
17:501:35611:18:18:72:524:669:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/); (2) the HRS restricted geographic identifiers (HRS/G), in 
17:502:35704:18:18:72:533:651:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:order to match the individual to the state of residence, and (3) state-level tax subsidy data 
17:503:35798:18:30:72:507:633:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for the purchase and holding of state-approved LTCI policies (GS Goda, 2011).   
17:504:35875:30:18:90:524:603:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Data from ten waves of the HRS (1996-2010), a publicly available, bi-annual survey of 
17:505:35961:18:18:72:524:585:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the near elderly in the U.S. were used.4  Respondents were ages 50 and older when they 
17:506:36047:18:18:72:517:567:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:initially entered the sample, and many respondents are observed long enough to have 
17:507:36129:18:18:72:531:549:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:used some type of long-term care.  To increase the relevance of the instrumental variable 
17:508:36218:18:18:72:538:531:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:used for analysis – the state tax subsidy – the sample was limited to individuals who report 
17:509:36308:18:18:72:518:513:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:filing taxes and individuals in the top half of the income distribution in our sample. The 
17:510:36399:18:18:72:529:495:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f13:B:sample size consisted of 46,639 individual-wave observations. The Cross-Wave Geographic 
17:511:36486:18:18:72:505:477:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f4:B:Information (State) file matches respondents to their state of residence, which is then 
17:512:36572:18:18:72:531:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:matched to hand-collected data from individual state income tax return forms from 1996-
17:513:36657:18:30:72:479:441:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:2010 that describe tax subsidy programs for private long-term care insurance.

17:515:36773:30:18:108:527:381:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Five binary outcome measures were created; the measures had varying means to 
17:516:36848:18:18:72:535:363:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:illustrate the bias due to the estimation methods.  Each outcome measure is created from 
17:517:36936:18:18:72:542:345:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:HRS data one wave (approximately two years) ahead of the data used to create explanatory 
17:518:37021:18:30:72:500:327:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:measures described below. Descriptive statistics for the data are shown in Table 3.  
17:519:37102:30:18:90:517:297:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Informal Helper:  Defining informal care in the HRS requires an algorithm based on 
17:520:37182:18:18:72:537:279:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:several variables.  The process first identifies whether the person received care for specific 
17:521:37274:18:18:72:507:261:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:IADLS and ADLS and then uses information from relationship codes measured in the 
17:522:37352:18:18:72:530:243:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:helper file to determine whether the care was from a child, a friend or another relative to 
17:523:37443:18:18:72:535:225:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ensure that the care recipient was not paid.  We create 3 variables based on who provided 
17:524:37531:18:18:72:519:207:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the informal care: 60 percent of the sample receives informal care from any person; 43 
17:525:37618:18:30:72:536:189:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:percent receive informal care from a child; 16.5 percent receive care from other relatives.   
17:526:37711:30:18:90:518:159:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Home Health care:  The formal home health care variables are:  "Since the previous

17:528:37882:18:26:72:534:123:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:2000, the HRS clarified that medically-trained persons include professional nurses, visiting 
17:529:37974:26:8:72:218:97:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:C:                                                           
17:530:38032:8:15:72:541:89:6:Times:10:Times:F:4 Earlier waves of the survey are omitted because of the lower quality information on the LTCI question (Finkelstein 
17:531:38148:15:0:72:385:74:10:Times:10:Times:F:and McGarry, 2006) and state information is not yet available for later waves. 
18:532:38228:0:18:72:542:705:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:nurse's aides, physical or occupational therapists, chemotherapists, and respiratory oxygen 
18:533:38320:18:18:72:526:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:therapists, which may represent an expansion of the definition of home health care.  6.8 
18:534:38408:18:30:72:259:669:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:percent received home health care.  
18:535:38442:30:18:90:529:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Nursing home care: The HRS asks: “Since (Previous Wave Interview Month-Year/In the

18:537:38613:18:18:72:531:603:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:or other long-term health care facility?”  For individuals who died between waves, nursing 
18:538:38704:18:18:72:540:585:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:home use was measured from data in the HRS exit interviews. 2.3 percent received nursing 
18:539:38791:18:30:72:132:567:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:home care.

18:541:38879:18:18:72:541:519:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:B:yes or no to the following question: “Not including government programs, do you now have 
18:542:38968:18:18:72:516:501:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:any long term care insurance which specifically covers nursing home care for a year or 
18:543:39055:18:18:72:513:483:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:more or any part of personal or medical care in your home?”. LTCI status is defined as 
18:544:39139:18:18:72:515:465:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:having LTCI in year t, based on the recorded response to this question; 15.7 percent of

18:546:39268:30:18:90:542:417:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A: State Tax Subsidy (an instrument for LTCI):  Following the literature, a binary variable 
18:547:39356:18:18:72:538:399:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:indicating whether a state has a tax subsidy available in a particular year was created to be 
18:548:39449:18:18:72:533:381:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:used as an instrument for LCTI.  The state tax subsidy indicated any subsidy, regardless of 
18:549:39539:18:18:72:506:363:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the form of the subsidy (i.e., credit or a deduction), the fraction of premiums eligible, 
18:550:39628:18:18:72:541:345:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:monetary caps on the value of the subsidy, income limits, or whether the state subsidy was 
18:551:39719:18:18:72:540:327:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:available in addition to the federal subsidy (GS Goda, 2011; Konetzka et al. 2014; Coe, Goda 
18:552:39812:18:18:72:518:309:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and Van Houtven 2015).  The availability of a state tax subsidy varied considerably over 
18:553:39898:18:18:72:540:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:time and across states; while only three states had tax incentives for LTCI in 1996, a total of 
18:554:39993:18:18:72:536:273:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:24 states plus the District of Columbia had adopted a subsidy by 2008.  Prior literature has 
18:555:40083:18:18:72:534:255:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:provided evidence that the state tax subsidy is empirically important in whether someone 
18:556:40171:18:18:72:528:237:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:holds a LTCI policy and meets essential criteria for use as an instrumental variable in this 
18:557:40262:18:18:72:512:219:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:context.  In the first stage regression, the estimated coefficient on the binary state tax 
18:558:40352:18:18:72:498:201:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:subsidy variable suggested that individuals in states with subsidies are about three 
18:559:40435:18:30:72:410:183:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:percentage points more likely to own LTCI (F-stat: 65.93, p<0.001). 
18:560:40501:30:18:72:529:153:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B: Individual-level control variables.  Control variables in the models  included binary 
18:561:40585:18:18:72:541:135:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:variables indicating respondent’s marital status, sex, number of children, retirement status, 
18:562:40679:18:18:72:529:117:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:education, income, race, ethnicity, health status (fair or poor self-reported health and the

19:565:40949:18:18:72:519:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:effects account for time trends in the data while the state fixed-effects account for non-
19:566:41039:18:18:72:542:669:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:time-varying differences across states.  The inclusion of state fixed-effects suggests that the 
19:567:41134:18:18:72:539:651:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:empirical models identify the effect of LTCI coverage on the outcome for individuals whose 
19:568:41221:18:30:72:467:633:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:LTCI coverage was sensitive to within-state differences in the state tax policy. 
19:569:41301:30:18:72:493:603:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Analyses included the use of all estimators represented in the simulations models 
19:570:41377:18:18:72:531:585:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:described in the previous section.  Each estimator was used to estimate the effect of long-
19:571:41466:18:18:72:532:567:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:term care insurance on each of the five outcomes described above, using the binary state 
19:572:41554:18:18:72:525:549:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tax subsidy variable as an instrumental variable. For each estimator, estimates from 500 
19:573:41642:18:18:72:539:531:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:clustered bootstrap samples were used to compute standard errors for the marginal effect

19:577:41753:30:18:108:529:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The simulation results indicated that 2SLS should produce consistent estimates of 
19:578:41831:18:18:72:507:405:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:LATEs, regardless of treatment or outcome rarity. Conversely, results suggested 2SRI 
19:579:41914:18:18:72:526:387:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:models were likely to produce bias in estimating average treatment effects on outcomes

19:581:42089:18:18:72:510:351:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:very rare outcome, such as nursing home care and home health care in our empirical

19:583:42253:18:30:72:213:315:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:unbiased estimates of ATE. 
19:584:42277:30:18:108:527:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Table 4 provides summary statistics for outcomes and other variables used in the 
19:585:42358:18:18:72:538:267:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:empirical models.  The marginal effects and their bootstrapped standard errors are shown 
19:586:42445:18:30:72:130:249:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in Table 5.  
19:587:42456:30:18:108:535:219:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The 2SLS-based consistent LATE estimates for LTCI were -0.302 (Informal care from 
19:588:42536:18:18:72:527:201:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:any source), -0.329 (Informal care from child), 0.161 (Informal care from relatives), -0.252 
19:589:42629:18:18:72:532:183:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(home health care), and 0.087 (Any nursing home care). The interpretation of LATE always 
19:590:42718:18:18:72:537:165:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:refers to the marginal individuals. For example, in the model predicting informal care from 
19:591:42807:18:18:72:531:147:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:any source, the LATE estimate suggests that LTCI decreases the use of informal care from 
19:592:42895:18:18:72:531:129:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:any source by 30 percentage points among people who are moved to acquire LTCI due to 
19:593:42979:18:18:72:534:111:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the subsidy.  Sometimes, LATE can provide treatment effects estimates that are difficult to 
19:594:43070:18:18:72:532:93:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:interpret, and may even be considered nonsensical, even when the IV is policy-driven. For 
19:595:43159:18:0:72:537:75:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:example, assuming that access to LTCI would increase receipt of formal care, which will act 
20:596:43253:0:18:72:528:705:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:as a substitute for all forms of informal care, the effect of LTCI on Informal care from any 
20:597:43346:18:18:72:538:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:source would perhaps not be expected to be smaller than the effect on Informal care from 
20:598:43435:18:18:72:534:669:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:child, yet that is what LATE suggests. Similarly, it is difficult to envision how the effect from 
20:599:43532:18:18:72:530:651:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:having LTCI, for those who have insurance due to state subsidies, increases informal care 
20:600:43622:18:18:72:534:633:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:from a relative; though this LATE estimate does not reach statistical significance. One may 
20:601:43711:18:18:72:537:615:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:invoke complicated stories about complementarity between formal care and informal care 
20:602:43798:18:18:72:536:597:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:from relatives and particularities about the generosity of LTCI for those who have it due to 
20:603:43890:18:18:72:533:579:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:state subsidies, to explain these result. Then again, the real world is full such complexities 
20:604:43984:18:18:72:494:561:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and taking the time to disentangle such nuanced relationships may be considered 
20:605:44064:18:18:72:510:543:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:worthwhile.  Note that the LATEs for different outcomes belong to the same marginal 
20:606:44148:18:30:72:357:525:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:group of patients who are influenced by this specific IV. 
20:607:44205:30:18:108:540:495:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Treatment effect estimates produced from the 2SRI models are often quite different 
20:608:44288:18:18:72:526:477:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:from the 2SLS-based LATE estimates. This was expected. The 2SRI-Gres estimates of ATE 
20:609:44373:18:18:72:540:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for LTCI are -0.268 (Informal care from any source), -0.179 (Informal care from child), -0.111 
20:610:44468:18:18:72:513:441:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(Informal care from relatives), -0.077 (home health care) and 0.023 (Any nursing home 
20:611:44553:18:18:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:care). Taken at face value, these estimates did not have the contextual inconsistencies, as it 
20:612:44645:18:18:72:537:405:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:relates to our a priori theory about the relationships under study, which were seen in LATE 
20:613:44734:18:18:72:525:387:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimates. The 2SRI estimates were also quite similar to those produced by the Bi-Probit 
20:614:44821:18:18:72:514:369:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:model, especially when outcomes mean was close to 0.50. It is quite plausible that the 
20:615:44905:18:18:72:526:351:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:underlying distribution of outcomes is well approximated by a normal distribution when 
20:616:44992:18:18:72:519:333:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the binary outcome mean is close to 0.50, and hence, for these outcomes, the bi-probit 
20:617:45077:18:18:72:530:315:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:model is likely to produce consistent estimates of ATE.5  For rarer outcomes, the bi-probit 
20:618:45166:18:18:72:539:297:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimates and the 2SRI-gres estimates differ and it is not clear if any of those estimates are 
20:619:45259:18:30:72:213:279:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:unbiased estimates of ATE. 
20:620:45285:30:18:108:534:249:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:For any nursing home care, which is the rarest outcome, 2SRI-ares (with Anscombe 
20:621:45365:18:18:72:510:231:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:residuals) estimates of ATE are close to being unbiased, according to our simulations. 
20:622:45452:18:18:72:533:213:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Although this point estimate of 0.038 differs from that of Bi-probit (= 0.023), neither reach 
20:623:45545:18:18:72:539:195:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:statistical significance. Hence, it is reasonable to conclude that the overall average effect of 
20:624:45641:18:30:72:487:177:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:LTCI in the entire population does not significantly affect any nursing home care.

20:628:45894:15:11:72:531:85:10:Times:10:Times:F:the BVP perform better for rare outcomes, here we are suggesting that when the outcomes mean is around 50% its 
20:629:46005:11:0:72:327:74:10:Times:10:Times:F:underlying data-generating process is more likely to be normal.

21:631:46084:30:18:108:508:675:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The economics literature is teeming with applications where linear probability 
21:632:46163:18:18:72:536:657:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:models are used for binary outcomes. In case of instrumental variables methods, both the 
21:633:46249:18:18:72:541:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:binary treatment (in 1st stage) and the binary outcome (in 2nd stage) are often modeled with 
21:634:46339:18:18:72:514:621:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:linear probability models with two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimators. In contrast, a 
21:635:46427:18:18:72:539:603:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:control function approach may be used with non-linear models (e.g., probit or logit applied 
21:636:46514:18:18:72:538:585:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to first and/or second stage models) where the estimated residuals from the first stage are 
21:637:46604:18:18:72:502:567:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:used as an additional covariate in the second stage. However, the residual inclusion 
21:638:46688:18:18:72:510:549:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:approach does not identify a treatment effect non-parametrically. Instead, it relies on 
21:639:46776:18:18:72:527:531:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:extrapolation for the counterfactual outcomes conditional of the level of a residual using 
21:640:46866:18:18:72:527:513:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the functional form used. The proper characterization of these residuals is thought to be 
21:641:46956:18:18:72:521:495:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:important to carry out such extrapolations.   This research considered the case where a 
21:642:47043:18:18:72:521:477:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:local average treatment effect (LATE) parameter is non-parametrically identified using a 
21:643:47130:18:18:72:541:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:binary instrument in the presence of all binary covariates. Extensive simulations that varied 
21:644:47223:18:18:72:513:441:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the rarity of both the outcome and treatment were performed to answer questions of 
21:645:47304:18:18:72:504:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:whether 2SLS or 2SRI methods with different forms of residuals has the least bias in 
21:646:47388:18:30:72:300:405:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimating the LATE or the ATE parameters.  
21:647:47431:30:18:108:532:375:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Results show that the 2SLS method with binary IV, applied to a binary endogenous 
21:648:47511:18:18:72:533:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:treatment and a binary outcome, produces consistent estimates of LATE across the entire 
21:649:47599:18:18:72:538:339:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:range of rarity for either treatment or the outcome.  The rarity of either does not affect the 
21:650:47694:18:18:72:495:321:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:coverage probabilities of these estimators. In contrast, the 2SRI approach with any 
21:651:47777:18:18:72:490:303:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:residuals studied was a biased estimator for LATE. However, in principle, the 2SRI 
21:652:47859:18:18:72:542:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimators are designed to estimate the ATE parameter. Still, results showed that 2SRI does 
21:653:47949:18:18:72:510:267:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:not appear dependable for producing unbiased estimates of ATE.  Rather, there were 
21:654:48029:18:18:72:542:249:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:varying levels of bias associated with 2SRI estimates of ATE. Among the residual forms, 2SRI 
21:655:48122:18:18:72:533:231:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with generalized residuals appeared to produce the least biased estimates of the ATE. For 
21:656:48208:18:18:72:494:213:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:very rare outcomes (<5%) 2SRI with Anscombe residual generated the least bias in 
21:657:48288:18:18:72:531:195:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimating ATE.  We conjecture that the symmetric transformation of these residuals may 
21:658:48374:18:18:72:518:177:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:be leading to better extrapolation properties of the 2SRI estimators. However, whether 
21:659:48461:18:18:72:519:159:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:these findings represent a general operating characteristic of 2SRI or are unique to our 
21:660:48550:18:30:72:243:141:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:simulation settings is not known. 
21:661:48583:30:18:108:529:111:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Results from this study conform to the simulation results of Chapman and Brooks 
21:662:48660:18:18:72:495:93:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(2016), who carry out similar simulations to find that 2SLS produced the consistent 
21:663:48743:18:0:72:502:75:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimates for the LATE while 2SRI does not reliably estimate either the ATE or LATE.  
22:664:48831:0:18:72:542:705:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:However, their study did not vary rarity of treatment or outcome from approximately 0.5 or 
22:665:48921:18:18:72:521:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:examine alternative forms of 2SRI residuals. The results of this study provide additional 
22:666:49008:18:18:72:540:669:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:evidence showing how 2SLS are consistent estimators of LATE over a wider range of means 
22:667:49095:18:30:72:299:651:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for binary outcomes and binary treatments. 
22:668:49137:30:18:108:535:621:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We hope that this work will help the applied researcher to cautiously approach and 
22:669:49216:18:18:72:536:603:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:interpret the results generated from IV estimation in models with binary treatment, binary 
22:670:49304:18:18:72:538:585:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:outcome, and binary instrumental variable. Careful interpretation of treatment effects that 
22:671:49395:18:18:72:480:567:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are identified and being estimated, as well as the potential for bias arising from 
22:672:49477:18:18:72:509:549:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:methodologic decisions, are key factors to consider in conducting these analyses and 
22:673:49561:18:18:72:482:531:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:responsibly reporting the results from them.  While estimating the LATE may be 
22:674:49638:18:18:72:534:513:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:straightforward given a valid instrument, the interpretation of LATEs is often nuanced and 
22:675:49726:18:18:72:518:495:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:may heighten the potential for unintentionally misleading or erroneous inferences and 
22:676:49812:18:18:72:542:477:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:conclusions. On the other hand, interpreting population mean treatment effect parameters 
22:677:49900:18:18:72:486:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:such as the ATE is straight-forward but estimating them is often problematic and 
22:678:49979:18:18:72:499:441:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:potentially infeasible, as doing so demands either richer data or a slew of statistical 
22:679:50067:18:18:72:530:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:assumptions that may not be met. Moreover, under settings of essential heterogeneity in 
22:680:50155:18:18:72:533:405:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:treatment effectiveness, the potential usefulness of a population-wide average effect may 
22:681:50243:18:18:72:534:387:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:B:be limited and more nuanced parameters are required for practical impact.  It’s important 
22:682:50333:18:18:72:498:369:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that researchers understand precisely the assumptions underlying identification of 
22:683:50415:18:18:72:524:351:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:alternative treatment effect concepts and the related theory to support an approach for 
22:684:50501:18:18:72:534:333:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimating them. We are hopeful that our results and discussions can help untangle these
