3:34:2337:28:20:102:524:680:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:Can governments still use trade to reward and punish partner countries?  While WTO rules and
3:35:2429:20:21:86:524:660:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:the pressures of globalization restrict states’ capacity to manipulate trade policies, politicization of
3:36:2533:21:20:86:524:639:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:trade is likely to occur where governments intervene in markets. We examine state ownership of firms
3:37:2633:20:20:86:524:619:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:as one tool of government control. Taking China and India as examples, we use new data on imports
3:38:2730:20:21:86:524:599:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:disaggregated by firm ownership type, as well as measures of political relations based on bilateral
3:39:2829:21:20:86:524:578:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:events and UN voting data to estimate the effect of political relations on import flows since the early
3:40:2932:20:20:86:524:558:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:1990s. Our results support the hypothesis that imports controlled by state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
3:41:3031:20:21:86:524:538:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:are more responsive to political relations than imports controlled by private enterprises. This finding
3:42:3134:21:20:86:524:517:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:suggests that politicized trade will increase as countries with partially state-controlled economies
3:43:3234:20:0:86:245:497:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:gain strength in the global economy.
4:44:3270:0:29:74:553:708:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Powerful states have a long tradition of economic statecraft.  Trade relations form a means of in-
4:45:3368:29:29:56:553:679:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:fluence (Hirschman, [1945] 1980; Lake, 2009; Flores-Mac ́ıas and Kreps, 2013), and alliances support
4:46:3468:29:29:56:553:650:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:favorable economic agreements (Mansfield and Bronson, 1997; Long and Leeds, 2006). During the Cold
4:47:3566:29:29:56:553:621:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:War, trade patterns closely reflected political relations (e.g. Pollins, 1989; Gowa, 1994; Mansfield and
4:48:3670:29:29:56:553:592:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Bronson, 1997; Keshk, Reuveny and Pollins, 2004; Kastner, 2007; Berger et al., 2013).  Governments
4:49:3768:29:29:56:553:563:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:today, however, have less leeway for using trade as carrot and stick in foreign policy. Global trade rules
4:50:3874:29:28:56:553:534:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:restrict the ability of governments to discriminate among trading partners, and transnational production
4:51:3978:28:29:56:553:506:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:further complicates efforts to link trade to foreign policy (Gowa and Mansfield, 2004; Brooks, 2007;
4:52:4078:29:29:56:553:477:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Davis and Meunier, 2011; Carnegie, 2014).  What are the channels by which governments induce trade
4:53:4176:29:29:56:553:448:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:patterns to follow foreign policy interests in today’s global economy? This paper revisits the question of
4:54:4282:29:29:56:553:419:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:whether trade follows the flag and highlights state ownership of firms as a key means for politicization
4:55:4386:29:29:56:553:390:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:of trade.  Where previous studies examine aggregate trade at cross-national level, we bring new data on
4:56:4489:29:29:56:232:361:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:trade flows based on firm ownership.
4:57:4525:29:29:74:553:332:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Anecdotal evidence suggests that governments continue to manipulate trade in response to political
4:58:4623:29:29:56:553:303:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:disputes.  In 2014, for example, the United States and the EU announced a range of economic penalties
4:59:4724:29:29:56:553:274:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:to punish Russian intervention in Ukraine, and Russia retaliated with its own boycotts of agricultural
4:60:4826:29:28:56:553:245:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:products from Europe.  Politically-motivated trade disruptions, however, are not limited to formal sanc-
4:61:4930:28:29:56:553:217:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:tions.  In 2012, Telam, Argentina’s official news outlet, reported that ministry officials had asked some
4:62:5035:29:29:56:553:188:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:20 companies to cease importing materials from the UK in response to diplomatic tensions over the
4:63:5132:29:29:56:553:159:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Falkland (Malvinas) Islands.1In Vietnam, the government encouraged manufacturing firms to diversify
4:64:5231:29:31:56:466:130:12:g_d0_f11:8:g_d0_f11:their imports away from China partly in response to tensions in the South China Sea.2

5:67:5480:0:29:74:553:708:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:We argue that government influence over firms makes trade flows more responsive to foreign rela-
5:68:5576:29:29:56:553:679:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:tions.  State-owned firms align their behavior with state interests because of dependence at the level of
5:69:5681:29:29:56:553:650:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:personnel and finances.  Where private firms trade on the basis of business interests, state-owned firms
5:70:5785:29:29:56:553:621:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:also pursue government interests.  As a result, we expect the impact of political relations on trade to be
5:71:5891:29:29:56:553:592:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:a function of state control.  To test this argument, we compare the responsiveness to political tensions
5:72:5995:29:29:56:553:563:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:of bilateral import flows through state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and private firms.  By examining how
5:73:6096:29:28:56:553:534:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:imports between the same pair of countries are impacted by political tensions conditional on ownership
5:74:6198:28:29:56:553:506:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:type of the importing firms, our research design allows a direct test of state control as the mechanism
5:75:6301:29:29:56:553:477:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:by which governments influence trade patterns.   This is the first study to analyze the impact of state
5:76:6404:29:29:56:246:448:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:ownership on bilateral patterns of trade.
5:77:6445:29:29:74:553:419:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Our paper challenges the view that market expectations and business lobbying alone shape com-
5:78:6538:29:29:56:553:390:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:mercial relations.  Liberal theories emphasize the constraints that arise from the economic interests of
5:79:6642:29:29:56:553:361:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:social actors within the state.  A large body of research has argued that interdependence encourages co-
5:80:6746:29:29:56:553:332:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:operative relations between states under commercial liberalism because governments respond to private
5:81:6847:29:29:56:553:303:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:economic interests (Polachek, 1980; Russett and Oneal, 2001; Li and Sacko, 2002; Gartzke, 2007; Lee
5:82:6946:29:29:56:553:274:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:and Mitchell, 2012). Instead, we demonstrate the ongoing role of the state in trade discrimination. Eco-
5:83:7050:29:28:56:553:245:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:nomic patriotism has been shown to motivate selective liberalization as well as protection (Levy, 2006;
5:84:7153:28:29:56:553:217:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Clift and Woll, 2012; Rickard and Kono, 2014). Berger et al. (2013) find that the positive impact of CIA
5:85:7257:29:29:56:553:188:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:interventions on US imports by a country is conditional on the government’s share of the economy. These
5:86:7360:29:29:56:553:159:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:studies have begun to highlight the role of the state in politicizing trade, but do not specify the channel
5:87:7467:29:29:56:553:130:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:through which governments generate this effect. Our paper finds that states manipulate imports as a tool
5:88:7571:29:29:56:553:101:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:of foreign policy through their influence over state-owned firms. State ownership of firms explains how
5:89:7674:29:0:56:553:72:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:some states escape the constraints of trade rules and global markets to remain users of economic state-
6:90:7778:0:29:56:553:708:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:craft.  This represents a starkly different logic about economic interdependence in which governments
6:91:7879:29:29:56:286:679:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:shape rather than respond to economic interests.
6:92:7927:29:29:74:553:650:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:The distinction between SOEs and non-SOEs is increasingly significant to the study of trade politics.

6:94:8127:29:29:56:553:592:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:countries—China, Brazil, Indonesia, Russia, South Africa, and Venezuela among them—have reversed
6:95:8223:29:29:56:553:563:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:course  and  taken  steps  to  preserve  or  expand  the  presence  of  state-owned  enterprises  in  key  sectors
6:96:8337:29:28:56:553:534:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:(World  Bank,  2014).   SOEs  now  occupy  the  ranks  of  the  largest  firms.   The  world’s  thirteen  largest

7:120:10595:28:29:56:553:506:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Critical for our study is the fact that both retain high levels of state ownership in some sectors alongside
7:121:10703:29:29:56:553:477:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:other sectors with little state involvement.  Chinese and Indian firms comprised the largest numbers of

8:154:13739:29:28:56:553:170:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:opportunities harms the target state, while preferential access offers benefits.  Using economic policy
8:155:13842:28:29:56:553:142:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:to achieve foreign policy goals, however, can produce negative externalities for the domestic market as

8:157:14047:29:0:56:553:84:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:in trade enhances the credibility of economic sanctions and underlies theories that portray economic

9:173:15545:24:29:73:552:278:8:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:9WTO rules reflect this tendency, admonishing that state-trading enterprises must make purchases

10:181:16227:29:29:56:553:642:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:state ownership influences firm behavior: firm mission, personnel, and financing. First and most funda-
10:182:16330:29:29:56:553:613:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:mentally, the purpose of state-owned enterprises is to advance the goals of the state.  While SOEs can
10:183:16432:29:29:56:553:584:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:and increasingly do operate with commercial considerations, they serve primarily as conduits through
10:184:16532:29:29:56:553:555:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:which the government may intervene in the economy to serve particular social, industrial, or political
10:185:16634:29:29:56:553:526:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:objectives in the national (or narrow government) interest.  SOEs were historically established to fulfill
10:186:16740:29:28:56:553:497:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:socioeconomic policy objectives, such as infrastructure building, energy and food provision, and health
10:187:16843:28:29:56:553:469:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:care, and they remain tasked today with providing public services. SOEs also may serve as tools to pro-
10:188:16946:29:29:56:553:440:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:mote industrial policies when governments support SOEs in sectors the government deems “strategic”
10:189:17044:29:29:56:553:411:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f12:for infant industry development. Given that fulfilling political imperatives is one of the primaryraisons
10:190:17149:29:29:56:553:382:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f11:d’ˆetreof these firms, we should expect them to pose less resistance to political demands than private
10:191:17251:29:29:56:84:353:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:firms.
10:192:17257:29:29:74:553:324:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Second, close ties between the state and state-owned enterprises are clearly visible in corporate gov-
10:193:17359:29:29:56:553:295:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:ernance structures. Unlike in private firms, where managers generally report to an independent board of
10:194:17462:29:29:56:553:266:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:directors, in the case of SOEs, directors are regularly determined by political appointment (Vagliasindi,
10:195:17567:29:28:56:553:237:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:2008). Blurring the lines between business and politics further, top SOE managers are often themselves
10:196:17669:28:29:56:553:209:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:political insiders; their performance as corporate leaders impacts not only their position with the firm
10:197:17773:29:29:56:553:180:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:but also their position in the political hierarchy. Business managers in state-owned enterprises thus often
10:198:17880:29:29:56:553:151:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:view their responsibilities as two-fold—to advance the interests of the firm and the state—and may suffer
10:199:17985:29:29:56:217:122:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:consequences for failing to do so.
10:200:18019:29:29:74:553:93:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Third, financial support also provides leverage over SOEs.  These firms do not, and in many cases
10:201:18116:29:0:56:553:64:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:could not, operate without the financial sponsorship of the state.  In some cases, the subsidies are stag-
11:202:18223:0:29:56:553:708:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:gering.  For example, subsidy payments to just three SOEs in Malaysia averaged four percent of GDP
11:203:18321:29:29:56:553:679:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:between 2003 and 2006 (World Bank, 2014, p.11). Much scholarly and policy research has documented
11:204:18418:29:29:56:553:650:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:the inefficiencies of state-backed firms, especially relative to private firms (e.g. Boardman and Vining,
11:205:18523:29:29:56:553:621:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:1989; World Bank, 1995) but also the range of advantages they enjoy over private firms, including favor-
11:206:18627:29:29:56:553:592:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:able taxation, subsidies, and preferential access to financing (DeWenter and Malatesta, 2001; Capobianco
11:207:18731:29:29:56:553:563:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:and Christiansen, 2011).  Government bailouts of financially under-performing SOEs are commonplace
11:208:18829:29:28:56:553:534:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:in  many  countries.   Even  where  state-owned  firms  achieve  competitiveness,  they  owe  much  of  their

11:212:19214:29:29:56:553:419:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:avenues for managers to bargain for compensation when state policy adversely impacts firm profits or

11:216:19622:29:29:56:553:303:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:operations and ability to negotiate for compensation, SOEs are less sensitive than non-SOEs to distribu-
11:217:19726:29:29:56:553:274:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:tional costs arising from the manipulation of economic policies.  They have less need to object to state
11:218:19830:29:28:56:553:245:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:influence that injects non-commercial criteria for business.  Instead, dependence on the state requires

11:221:20071:29:29:56:553:159:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:can act as the agent of the state to shift import sourcing or cancel export contracts in response to bilateral
11:222:20181:29:29:56:553:130:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:tensions.  Indirect support is also important—often governments may intervene through the actions of
11:223:20281:29:29:56:553:101:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:customs agents to delay or block import and export shipments.  Such actions would normally provoke
11:224:20379:29:0:56:553:72:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:opposition from the respective domestic trading firms who suffer costs waiting for shipments.  To the
12:225:20481:0:54:56:500:708:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:extent that SOEs tolerate such inconveniences, they support the politicization of trade policy.

13:258:23635:29:29:56:553:390:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:taken steps to allow some SOEs more independence in corporate decision-making, but ministries con-

14:274:25170:29:29:56:553:592:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:owned SOEs.14For these firms, refusing to comply with political demands could mean a reduction in

14:277:25382:28:29:56:553:506:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:actors.  Completely free markets are unlikely to show much correlation between political relations and
14:278:25484:29:29:56:553:477:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:import decisions.  In free-market economies,  states must adopt explicit policies to constrain markets,
14:279:25587:29:29:56:553:448:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:such as imposing legal restrictions on trade to force compliance by private actors. In contrast, where the
14:280:25693:29:29:56:553:419:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:state maintains more control over firms, politicizing imports can be a quick and informal process.  For
14:281:25796:29:29:56:553:390:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:the reasons outlined above, firms owned by the state are the most likely to be responsive to government
14:282:25899:29:29:56:553:361:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:preferences.   Looking  within  China  and  India,  we  expect  to  observe  a  stronger  correlation  between

16:317:29104:29:29:56:553:650:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:imports for the sector (from UN Comtrade) for a particular bilateral trade relationship; finally, we sum
16:318:29208:29:29:56:553:621:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:the resulting values across sectors to get an estimate of the annual value of imports flowing through
16:319:29309:29:29:56:553:592:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:SOEs for the dyad. We repeat the procedure for each partner country. Private-enterprise import flows are
16:320:29413:29:29:56:215:563:12:g_d0_f11:8:g_d0_f11:calculated by the same method.18
16:321:29445:29:28:74:553:534:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Our procedure for the India data assumes that SOE shares in total assets are equivalent to SOE shares
16:322:29546:28:29:56:553:506:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:in trade, which is unlikely to be true in reality.  The potential for over- or under-estimating trade will
16:323:29652:29:29:56:553:477:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:not affect our estimation results, however, as long as there are not systematic differences across trade
16:324:29756:29:29:56:553:448:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:partners.  Moreover, we do not face this concern for the China analysis where we were able to obtain
16:325:29856:29:29:56:388:419:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:official data on bilateral trade flows disaggregated by firm ownership.
16:326:29927:29:29:74:553:390:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Figure 1 demonstrates the contribution of SOEs and private enterprises to Chinese and Indian imports
16:327:30027:29:29:56:553:361:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:over the sample period. The share of China’s imports comprised by SOEs has fallen over the last decade
16:328:30129:29:29:56:553:332:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:with privatization, while the private sector share of trade has risen correspondingly. The decline in SOE
16:329:30234:29:29:56:553:303:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:shares has leveled off recently, and they remain substantial at about 30 percent of imports.  The pattern
16:330:30339:29:30:56:553:274:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:for India has been more stable over time, and about 40 percent of imports are estimated to have been
16:331:30439:30:29:69:553:244:8:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:18To  understand  how  we  construct our  proxies,  consider  imports  to  India  from  Poland.   In  2000,
16:332:30546:29:23:56:553:215:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:India imported US$ 16.5 million worth of electrical machinery and apparatus from Poland (ISIC Rev.3,
16:333:30646:23:24:56:553:192:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:division 31). In this sector and year, SOEs held 12.1 percent and private enterprises held 77.4 percent of
16:334:30752:24:24:56:553:168:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:total assets.  Multiplying the trade values by the asset shares, we estimate that US$2.0 million worth of
16:335:30857:24:24:56:553:144:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:imports from Poland entered India through SOEs and US$12.7 million through private enterprises.  We
16:336:30956:24:24:56:553:120:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:repeat this procedure for all ISIC divisions covered and sum across sectors to obtain values for SOE and
16:337:31060:24:0:56:181:96:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:private enterprise imports.

17:348:31380:14:43:56:462:341:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:total imports (1991-2012; data for China begin in 1993; data for India are estimates).
17:349:31466:43:29:74:553:298:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:One  challenge  to  making  inferences  about  state  ownership  is  the  strategic  nature  of  government
17:350:31573:29:29:56:553:269:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:decisions that determine state ownership; SOE intensity is not randomly allocated across sectors. Energy
17:351:31677:29:29:56:553:240:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:and resource sectors experience the highest levels of state ownership because of their importance to both
17:352:31782:29:29:56:553:211:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:economic growth and security.  The decisions about ownership reflect state priorities toward the sector
17:353:31885:29:29:56:553:182:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:in general.  This mitigates the endogeneity problem for our research question because we leverage the
17:354:31986:29:29:56:553:153:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:variation in political relations with specific trading partners, which is largely independent of ownership
17:355:32092:29:28:56:200:124:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:decisions for different sectors.
17:356:32124:28:0:69:506:96:8:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:19SOE and private-sector shares do not sum to 100 given presence of other enterprise types.

18:358:32241:37:29:56:553:671:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:While bilateral trade is objectively quantifiable, political relations between countries are difficult to mea-
18:359:32351:29:29:56:553:642:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:sure. We build on indicators common in the literature—negative political events and voting alignment in
18:360:32454:29:29:56:424:613:12:g_d0_f11:8:g_d0_f11:the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA)—for both China and India.20
18:361:32524:29:29:74:553:584:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Our first two measures quantify the tensions between China, India, and their trading partners using
18:362:32623:29:29:56:553:555:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:bilateral events data. We use the Global Data on Events, Location and Tone (GDELT) data from Leetaru
18:363:32723:29:29:56:553:526:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:and Schrodt (2013). The dataset, considered the most comprehensive of its kind, uses a machine coding
18:364:32824:29:28:56:553:497:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:system to classify daily reports of events from eleven global news outlets into categories of the actors
18:365:32928:28:29:56:553:469:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:involved in the event.21Each event is weighted by the corresponding “Goldstein score,” a value between
18:366:33030:29:29:56:553:440:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:-10 and 10 that measures the expected severity, based on its type (Goldstein, 1992). For example, a use
18:367:33133:29:29:56:553:411:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:of military force would be weighted more heavily than an expulsion of another country’s diplomats, but
18:368:33235:29:29:56:553:382:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:expelling diplomats would be weighted more heavily than a verbal condemnation of another country’s
18:369:33333:29:29:56:553:353:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:actions.  We sum the severity-weighted number of negative events to create a single annual observation
18:370:33435:29:29:56:261:324:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:and take the log to smooth the distribution.
18:371:33479:29:30:74:553:295:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:In contrast to previous research using negative event counts (e.g. Davis and Meunier, 2011; Li and
18:372:33577:30:29:69:522:265:8:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:20In the robustness check section below, we also introduce a unique “China-specific” measure.
18:373:33670:29:29:69:553:236:8:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:21The data is produced from Textual Analysis by Augmented Replacement Instructions (TABARI)
18:374:33761:29:23:56:553:207:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:system for machine coding based on pattern recognition.  It has been found to be as accurate as human
18:375:33862:23:24:56:553:184:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:coders.  See, for example, Best, Carpino and Crescenzi (2013).  The data base has been criticized for
18:376:33963:24:24:56:553:160:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:listing events without naming actors and for its reliance on English-language media sources (Weller and
18:377:34066:24:24:56:553:136:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:McCubbins, 2014).  To address the former, we exclude events with missing actors.  The latter concern
18:378:34166:24:24:56:553:112:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:is mitigated by the use of country-fixed effects in our empirical analysis.  We also show results with a
18:379:34270:24:0:56:407:88:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:China-specific measure of political relations in the extensions subsection.
19:380:34347:0:29:56:553:708:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Liang, N.d), we do not simply use the total number of events.  We restrict our negative event counts to
19:381:34450:29:29:56:553:679:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:actions performed by a partner country upon China and India, respectively.  This approach allows us to
19:382:34552:29:29:56:553:650:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:mitigate endogeneity concerns as these events are arguably more exogenous than actions where China
19:383:34650:29:29:56:553:621:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:(or India) itself is the sender.   Specifially,  our first indicator captures events involving a government
19:384:34757:29:29:56:553:592:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:(non-military) actor of a country that trades with China (or India),  while the second captures events
19:385:34859:29:29:56:553:563:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:involving a military actor to determine whether militarized disputes provoke a stronger reaction than
19:386:34960:29:28:56:553:534:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:diplomatic events.   This comes with the advantage that,  by only using negative events that involve a
19:387:35062:28:29:56:553:506:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:government (or military) actor, we discard pure business events, such as business meetings or mergers
19:388:35163:29:29:56:553:477:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:and acquisitions,  which are not exogenous to our import measure.   Moreover,  a second advantage is
19:389:35263:29:29:56:553:448:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:that, with this approach, we also discard negative events with a country’s opposition or non-state actors
19:390:35368:29:29:56:553:419:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:such as NGOs as main actor as such events should lead to substantially smaller (or no) reactions from
19:391:35469:29:29:56:412:390:12:g_d0_f11:8:g_d0_f11:governments. The correlation between our two measures is 71.5 percent.22
19:392:35541:29:29:74:553:361:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Figure 2 plots the weighted number of negative events that occurred after 1990 between China (first
19:393:35640:29:29:56:553:332:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:and third panel) and India (second and fourth panel) with three major partners—the United States (left),
19:394:35744:29:29:56:553:303:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Japan (center) and Russia (right). The events measure here is shown in its unlogged form in units of 1,000
19:395:35850:29:29:56:553:274:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:events, and the range of the plots has been adjusted to match the observed variance by country. Prominent
19:396:35955:29:28:56:553:245:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:events that have caused bilateral tensions are visible in the data.  For example, the US bombing of the
19:397:36058:28:29:56:553:217:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Chinese embassy in Belgrade and the Hainan Island incident,  during which the Chinese government
19:398:36154:29:31:56:553:188:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:detained the crew of a US Navy Intelligence plane, are reflected in the spikes in negative events in 1999
19:399:36259:31:28:69:552:157:8:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:22The correlation of these measures with the total event count that includes all actors is 90.8 and 81.7
19:400:36363:28:24:56:553:129:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:percent, respectively. The correlation of this total event count based on GDELT with a total event count
19:401:36467:24:24:56:553:105:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:based on the widely-used King and Lowe (2003) data is 75.1 percent. We do not use the King and Lowe
19:402:36566:24:0:56:534:81:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:(2003) dataset because it ends in 2004 whereas GDELT extends to 2012 and is continously updated.
20:403:36664:0:29:56:553:708:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:and 2001 respectively.  Similarly, the Japanese government’s 2010 detention of a Chinese fishing vessel
20:404:36767:29:29:56:553:679:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:and its captain near the disputed Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands mentioned in the introduction is reflected in
20:405:36869:29:29:56:553:650:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:the data. Turning to India, the spikes in both government and military tensions with the U.S. in 1998, for
20:406:36975:29:29:56:475:621:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:example, correspond to the events surrounding India’s nuclear weapon tests in Pokhran.
20:407:37061:29:29:74:553:592:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Our third relations variable measures the distance in foreign policy orientation between China or
20:408:37158:29:29:56:553:563:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:India and each partner country.   Bailey,  Strezhnev and Voeten (forthcoming) use UNGA voting data
20:409:37256:29:28:56:553:534:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:to construct an annual measure of each country’s ideal point along a single dimension that captures its
20:410:37359:28:29:56:553:506:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:positionvis-`a-visa “US-led liberal order.” The resulting scores are differenced to obtain dyadic measures
20:411:37465:29:29:56:553:477:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:of the distance between a pair of states in terms of their foreign policy preferences.  The measure uses
20:412:37569:29:29:56:553:448:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:resolutions that were identical over time to “bridge observations,” allowing researchers to separate out
20:413:37673:29:29:56:553:419:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:shifts in state preferences from changes in the UN agenda and make more meaningful comparisons of
20:414:37770:29:29:56:553:390:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:state preferences over time.  Measuring the gap in preferences between pairs of states by the difference
20:415:37874:29:29:56:553:361:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:in their ideal points rather than by the difference in their voting records helps to eliminate noise and
20:416:37978:29:29:56:409:332:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:facilitate better comparisons of states’ relative foreign policy orientations.
20:417:38056:29:29:74:553:303:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Figure 2 also plots the ideal point distances between China (fifth panel) and India (sixth panel) and
20:418:38157:29:29:56:553:274:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:the U.S., Japan, and Russia.  Mirroring divisions between the United States and its allies on one hand,
20:419:38260:29:28:56:553:245:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:and the rising powers on the other (see Voeten, 2000), China’s and India’s distance to the three partner
20:420:38364:28:29:56:553:217:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:countries looks similar at first sight.  Still, there are some striking differences.  For example, while the
20:421:38472:29:29:56:553:188:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:distances between China and the U.S. and China and Japan remained relatively stable from the mid-
20:422:38569:29:29:56:553:159:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:1990s through 2010, India bridged some of its distance with these countries between the mid-1990s and
20:423:38670:29:29:56:553:130:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:early 2000s.  The plots also reflect the increasing proximity of both China and India with Russia.  By
20:424:38772:29:29:56:413:101:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:2010, both countries were closer to Russia than to either the U.S. or Japan.
20:425:38848:29:0:74:553:72:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Table 1 compares the measures of political relations by ranking the states with the most negative
21:426:38947:0:29:56:553:708:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:relationships. China’s relations are worst with the United States according to all three measures. Taiwan
21:427:39052:29:29:56:553:679:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:occupies the second spot for China in terms of both negative government events and military events but
21:428:39154:29:29:56:553:650:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:fails to appear in UNGA voting because it is not recognized as a sovereign country by the United Nations.
21:429:39259:29:29:56:553:621:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Japan, South Korea, and Russia feature prominently on both events lists for China, while Pakistan, the
21:430:39361:29:29:56:553:592:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:U.S., Sri Lanka and China are among the countries that experienced the most negative events with India.
21:431:39464:29:29:56:553:563:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Not surprisingly, the countries that experience the fewest events with either China or India are small,
21:432:39567:29:28:56:553:534:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:geographically distant countries that would be unlikely to have strong engagement with either country
21:433:39668:28:29:56:553:506:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:diplomatically or militarily.  Thirty-nine countries were engaged in no government or military events
21:434:39769:29:29:56:553:477:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:with China over the sample period, and ninety-seven did not experience any events with India.  Moving
21:435:39870:29:29:56:553:448:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:to UNGA voting, the patterns for China and India are quite similar; the same ten coutries comprise the
21:436:39972:29:29:56:553:419:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:list for both countries with slight differences in order.  After the U.S.,  the countries with which both
21:437:40077:29:29:56:553:390:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:China and India are most distant are Israel (average score of 3.1 for China and 3.0 for India) and the UK
21:438:40182:29:29:56:553:361:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:(2.6 for China and 2.5 for India). On the flip side, China is most closely aligned with Pakistan (.20) and
21:439:40288:29:0:56:474:332:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Nigeria (.22), while India is closest to East Timor (.19), Uganda (.19), and Ghana (.19).

24:483:42559:0:42:56:222:708:17:g_d0_f10:17:g_d0_f10:3  Empirical Analysis
24:484:42580:42:28:56:553:666:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:To test our hypothesis, we build on the gravity model of trade, the “workhorse” of the empirical trade
24:485:42682:28:29:56:553:638:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:literature (e.g. Tinbergen, 1962; Anderson and van Wincoop, 2003). Trade flows are expected to increase
24:486:42785:29:29:56:553:609:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:with both the exporter’s supply and the importer’s demand of goods, proxied by exporter and importer
24:487:42885:29:29:56:553:580:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:GDP respectively, and to decrease with trade costs. Geographic distance is used as a proxy for trade costs,
24:488:42992:29:29:56:553:551:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:and additional variables, such as common language, measure friction. We model import flows controlled
24:489:43093:29:29:56:553:522:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and those controlled by private enterprises using seemingly unrelated
24:490:43196:29:29:56:553:493:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:estimations.23This approach facilitates our comparison of the relationship between political relations
24:491:43298:29:29:56:327:464:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:and imports across the two categories of firm ownership.
24:492:43354:29:40:74:360:435:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Specifically, we estimate the following system of equations:
24:493:43414:40:41:106:553:395:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f11:importsSOE, ijt=β0+β1relationsijt−1+β2GDPijt−1+β3Xijt−1+νj+τt+εijt(1)

24:500:44061:29:29:56:553:181:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:are clustered on partner country. To test our hypothesis, we include each measure ofrelationsseparately.
24:501:44165:29:29:56:175:152:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:All measures are logged.
24:502:44189:29:31:74:553:123:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Note  that  our  specification  is  identical  to  an  estimation  of  OLS  equation-by-equation  since  both
24:503:44298:31:0:69:404:92:8:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:23We use the STATA command “suest” to combine estimation results.
25:504:44365:0:29:56:553:708:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:equations use the same set of regressors.   Seemingly unrelated estimations enable us to test whether
25:505:44466:29:29:56:553:679:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:the coefficients on our political relations variables differ between SOE and private-enterprise trade.  We
25:506:44572:29:29:56:553:650:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:expect that political relations play a larger role in trade controlled by SOEs than in trade controlled by
25:507:44678:29:29:56:553:621:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:private enterprises. Since larger values correspond with more negative relations, our formal expectation
25:508:44782:29:29:56:109:592:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:isβ1< ̃β1.
25:509:44792:29:29:74:553:563:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:We includeGDPfrom the standard gravity model with data from World Development Indicators
25:510:44880:29:28:56:553:534:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:(WDI).  Because  we  employ  partner-country  fixed  effects,  we  exclude  geographic  distance  and  other
25:511:44988:28:29:56:552:506:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:time-invariant determinants of bilateral trade flows. Within our set of control variablesX, we first include
25:512:45096:29:29:56:553:477:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:market potential, which we proxy as the (logged) product of exporter and importer population size, with
25:513:45199:29:29:56:553:448:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:data from WDI. We also add a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 if both countries are members of
25:514:45299:29:29:56:553:419:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:the WTO for the majority of a given year (data from the WTO website).  Because trade relations have
25:515:45398:29:29:56:553:390:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:been found to depend on regime type (see, for example, Mansfield, Milner and Rosendorff, 2000; Aidt
25:516:45497:29:29:56:553:361:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:and Gassebner, 2010; Manger and Pickup, 2016), we include the polity2 variable from the Polity IV
25:517:45594:29:29:56:553:332:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Project (Marshall, Gurr and Jaggers, 2013). Polity is a 21-point index, where the largest value refers to a
25:518:45701:29:29:56:216:303:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:fully institutionalized democracy.
25:519:45735:29:29:74:553:274:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Finally, to mitigate endogeneity concerns, we lag all covariates by one year.  Our analysis begins in
25:520:45836:29:28:56:553:245:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:1993 for China, the first year for which Customs Info provides data by ownership type and 1991 for
25:521:45934:28:29:56:553:217:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:India, when the country entered its period of economic liberalization.  All estimations extend through
25:522:46036:29:29:56:553:188:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:2012, which is the limit of our data on trade flows by firm ownership. Table 4 in Online Appendix A lists
25:523:46141:29:0:56:476:159:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:all variables, their definitions, and their sources. Descriptive statistics appear in Table 5.
26:524:46237:0:37:56:260:708:14:g_d0_f10:14:g_d0_f10:3.1  Results for Chinese Imports
26:525:46269:37:29:56:553:671:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Table 2 presents our results for imports to China.  Each column shows the results for one of our three
26:526:46371:29:29:56:553:642:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:measures of political relations. The upper half of the table displays the results for SOE trade; the lower
26:527:46477:29:29:56:364:613:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:half shows the corresponding results for private-enterprise trade.
26:528:46543:29:29:74:553:584:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Beginning with column 1, the coefficient for negative government events between China and its trade
26:529:46642:29:29:56:553:555:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:partner has a significant effect to lower SOE imports. There is no significant effect on private-enterprise
26:530:46749:29:29:56:553:526:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:trade, and a Wald test (final row of Table 2) shows that the observed difference in the political relations
26:531:46856:29:28:56:553:497:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:coefficients  for  SOE  and  private  trade  is  statistically  significant  at  the  one-percent  level.   Moreover,
26:532:46973:28:29:56:553:469:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:the substantive effects are large; a one-percent increase in our government events index decreases SOE
26:533:47075:29:29:56:553:440:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:imports by 0.12 percent.   To give an example,  Japan’s retention of a Chinese fishing vessel near the
26:534:47177:29:29:56:553:411:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands in 2010 registered an increase in negative events of 218 percent;  our model
26:535:47276:29:29:56:542:382:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:would predict a corresponding 26.2 percent drop in SOE imports from Japan between 2010 and 2011.
26:536:47372:29:29:74:553:353:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:In column 2, we see that negative military events produce similar adverse impact on SOE imports.

28:584:50050:29:29:56:553:531:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:significant impact to reduce imports for both SOE and private-enterprise trade, which is significant at the

28:586:50263:29:29:56:553:473:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:our hypothesis, the coefficients on negative events are more pronounced for SOE imports. A one-percent
28:587:50365:29:29:56:553:444:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:increase in negative government events produces a 0.41 percent decrease in imports for SOEs,  while

30:644:53917:29:29:56:553:382:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:generally robust to the removal of any particular year. With respect to UN ideal point distance, the China
30:645:54023:29:29:56:553:353:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:results are only sensitive to the removal of 1995 (the Wald test does not show a significant difference
30:646:54126:29:29:56:553:324:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:between SOE versus private enterprises at conventional levels of significanc, p-value: 0.126); similarly,
30:647:54231:29:29:56:553:295:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:the impact of ideal point distance on Indian imports falls below conventional levels of significance if
30:648:54334:29:29:56:553:266:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:we remove 1994, 1999 or 2000 (p-values: 0.125, 0.142 and 0.106). Full regression results are available
30:649:54436:29:28:56:120:237:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:upon request.
30:650:54449:28:29:74:553:209:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Third, we explore whether political relations have differential effects on imports for oil states and
30:651:54550:29:29:56:553:180:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:non-oil states. We define oil states as those countries that show gross revenues from net oil exports that
30:652:54656:29:29:56:553:151:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:exceed ten percent of GDP in 2000 (Colgan, 2010). Including a separate coefficient for political relations
30:653:54762:29:29:56:553:122:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:with oil states allows the model to estimate distinct effects of political relations on imports conditional on
30:654:54872:29:29:56:553:93:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:whether the partner is an oil state. For China we find some evidence that SOE imports from non-oil states
30:655:54977:29:0:56:553:64:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:are more responsive to bad political relations than imports from oil states (see Table 6 for details). This
31:656:55086:0:29:56:553:708:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:conforms to the expectation that oil-dependent economies have little choice but to continue importing
31:657:55187:29:29:56:553:679:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:from  an  oil-exporting  country  regardless  of  any  bilateral  conflicts  that  may  arise  with  the  state  (e.g.
31:658:55305:29:29:56:553:650:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Polachek, 1980).  For India the picture is mixed and we do not observe a clear pattern for whether oil
31:659:55407:29:29:56:553:621:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:interests shape whether India is more responsive to bad political relations (Table 7).  In both cases, our
31:660:55513:29:29:56:317:592:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:findings are not systematically driven by oil resources.
31:661:55569:29:29:74:553:563:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Fourth, for our China analysis, we employ an additional measure that captures the overall level of
31:662:55667:29:28:56:553:534:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:relations between China and twelve states from a Chinese perspective.25Developed by Chinese scholar
31:663:55766:28:29:56:553:506:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Yan Xuetong and colleagues,  this conflict-cooperation index is based on reports of bilateral political
31:664:55869:29:29:56:553:477:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:events  from  Chinese  newspapers  (Yan,  2010).   Events—both  positive  and  negative—are  tallied  on  a
31:665:55976:29:29:56:553:448:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:monthly basis and weighted by the severity of the event and the overall level of relations in the previous
31:666:56082:29:29:56:553:419:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:month.26The final relations score is bounded between -9 and 9, and we would expect a positive effect
31:667:56182:29:29:56:553:390:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:given that larger values for this measure correspond with better political relations.27As can be seen
31:668:56283:29:29:56:553:361:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:from  the  results  in  Table  8  in  the  Online  Appendix,  we  find  a  statistically  significant  positive  effect
31:669:56402:29:31:56:553:332:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:of political relations on imports through SOEs but not through private enterprises.   The insignificant
31:670:56505:31:28:69:553:301:8:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:25The twelve countries included in the data are Australia, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan,
31:671:56605:28:24:56:283:273:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Korea, Pakistan, Russia, US, UK, and Vietnam.
31:672:56650:24:29:69:552:249:8:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:26The rationale behind this weighting scheme is that the effect of events should be conditional on the
31:673:56752:29:23:56:553:220:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:existing level of relations.  For example, a verbal criticism probably affects the overall level of relations
31:674:56861:23:24:56:553:197:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:less between two countries already at war than between two countries with cooperative relations.  The
31:675:56962:24:24:56:553:173:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:change from the previous month is added to the previous month’s overall relations score to form the new
31:676:57065:24:25:56:164:149:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:overall relations score.
31:677:57089:25:28:69:553:124:8:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:27According to the average score on Yan’s scale, Pakistan was the country with the best relations in
31:678:57189:28:24:56:553:96:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:the 1990-2011 period (average score of 6.7), followed by Russia (6.3) and Germany (4.4).  In line with
31:679:57291:24:0:56:516:72:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:our three measures in the main analysis, China’s relations are worst with the United States (0.4).
32:680:57391:0:29:56:553:708:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:coefficient for private imports is large,  however,  and the corresponding Wald test does not suggest a
32:681:57494:29:29:56:553:679:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:significant difference between state-owned and private enterprises.  However, this should be interpreted
32:682:57598:29:29:56:553:650:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:with caution given that the Yan measure covers only twelve countries and small number of observations.
32:683:57700:29:29:74:553:621:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Fifth, we estimate models without partner-country fixed effects to analyze both the within and be-
32:684:57798:29:29:56:553:592:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:tween variation across pooled observations. In these specifications, we add several of the standard vari-
32:685:57903:29:29:56:553:563:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:ables usually included in gravity trade models on pooled sample of countries: (logged) bilateral distance,
32:686:58009:29:28:56:553:534:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:contiguity, common language, and landlocked (data from (Mayer and Zignago, 2011)).  We address the
32:687:58107:28:29:56:553:506:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:argument that structural patterns of trade follow alliance blocs (Gowa, 1994), with an indicator for trad-
32:688:58213:29:29:56:553:477:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:ing partners that share an alliance with the United States;  given that India does not have any formal
32:689:58315:29:29:56:553:448:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:alliances of its own, and China has few, US allies proxy for where one could expect a negative security
32:690:58418:29:29:56:244:419:12:g_d0_f11:8:g_d0_f11:externality to suppress bilateral trade.28
32:691:58460:29:29:74:553:390:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Table 9 and Table 10 in the Online Appendix show the results of the regressions excluding partner-
32:692:58558:29:29:56:553:361:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:country fixed effects.  Overall, the results are similar to those obtained using the stricter fixed-effects
32:693:58665:29:29:56:553:332:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:specifications. In most models, we find the effect of bad political relations on Chinese or Indian imports
32:694:58771:29:29:56:553:303:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:to be significantly more negative in the state-controlled sector of the economy compared to the private
32:695:58874:29:29:56:87:274:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:sector.
32:696:58881:29:28:74:553:245:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Finally, we examine the effects of political relations on Chinese and Indian exports rather than im-
32:697:58981:28:29:56:553:217:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:ports.  In the mercantilist framework of most governments, limiting or seeking other sources of imports
32:698:59084:29:29:56:553:188:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:will be preferred to restricting exports. Nevertheless, we recognize that there may be some circumstances
32:699:59189:29:31:56:553:159:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:under which states would focus on exports as a tool of statecraft. For example, Russia’s manipulation of
32:700:59293:31:28:69:553:128:8:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:28Alliance data are from the Alliance Treaty Obligations and Provisions (ATOP) project (Leeds et al.,
32:701:59394:28:24:56:553:100:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:2002).   The  data  end  in  2003;  we  carry  forward  the  2003  value  to  the  end  of  our  dataset  under  the
32:702:59510:24:0:56:420:76:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:assumption that a country’s alliance portfolio does not vary much over time.
33:703:59588:0:29:56:553:708:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:gas exports in 2006 and 2009 amidst long-standing disputes with Ukraine, China’s restrictions on rare
33:704:59689:29:29:56:553:679:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:earth exports, and the West’s blockade of certain technology exports for the Russian energy sector dur-
33:705:59792:29:29:56:553:650:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:ing the Ukraine crisis represent high-profile cases where dominant market position over strategic goods
33:706:59895:29:29:56:338:621:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:allowed the use of export restrictions as a tool of statecraft.
33:707:59958:29:29:74:553:592:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Table 11 presents our results for estimating Chinese exports with each of our four measures of po-
33:708:60056:29:29:56:553:563:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:litical relations.  We do not observe a significant effect of government events on either SOE or private-
33:709:60161:29:28:56:553:534:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:enterprise exports (column 1).  Military events (column 2) and policy distance measured by UN voting
33:710:60261:28:29:56:553:506:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:(column 3) produce a negative and significant effect on both SOE and private exports.  However, the
33:711:60360:29:29:56:553:477:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:impact of military events and policy distance is larger for private enterprises,  which differs from our
33:712:60464:29:29:56:553:448:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:expectations. From a mercantilist perspective, the Chinese government may be more inclined to impose
33:713:60564:29:29:56:553:419:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:pressure on SOE importers than on its SOE export champions which are at the forefront of export-led de-
33:714:60667:29:29:56:553:390:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:velopment. Kastner (2007) argues that political tensions do harm trade if domestic actors that gain from
33:715:60771:29:29:56:553:361:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:trade are strong politically.  Given the described linkages between SOEs and the Chinese government,
33:716:60871:29:29:56:202:332:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:this obviously holds for SOEs.
33:717:60901:29:29:74:553:303:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Turning to India in Table 12, we find support for the hypothesis that negative political events harm ex-
33:718:61005:29:29:56:553:274:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:ports; the coefficients on both measures of events are negative for both SOEs and private enterprises and
33:719:61110:29:28:56:553:245:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:statistically significant at the one-percent level (columns 4 and 5). The Wald test indicates a significantly
33:720:61219:28:29:56:553:217:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:larger trade response to military tensions in the state-owned sector.  This effect does not extend to ideal
33:721:61326:29:29:56:553:188:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:point distance, however (column 6). The coefficient on ideal point distance is negative, as expected, but
33:722:61431:29:29:56:553:159:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:never achieves significance for either SOEs or private enterprises.  Overall, the coefficients on political
33:723:61538:29:29:56:553:130:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:relations for exports are much smaller than for imports. In sum, political relations affect India’s trading
33:724:61645:29:0:56:543:101:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:patterns; the effect is more pronounced for SOEs than for private enterprises and stronger for imports.
34:725:61750:0:42:56:164:708:17:g_d0_f10:17:g_d0_f10:4  Conclusion
34:726:61763:42:28:56:553:666:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Does globalization render economic statecraft obsolete?  Our research suggests that the answer is no.
34:727:61864:28:29:56:553:638:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Governments still aspire to use economic tools to influence international politics.  Deregulation of mar-
34:728:61969:29:29:56:553:609:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:kets, transnational production, and international trade rules have simply narrowed their capacity for ac-
34:729:62074:29:29:56:553:580:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:tion. We trace the politicization of trade directly to the role of government in the economy. The literature
34:730:62182:29:29:56:553:551:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:on interdependence, which aggregates the incentives of private actors and state intervention, has been
34:731:62284:29:29:56:553:522:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:unable to explain how the linkage between trade and foreign policy arises.  We identify state control as
34:732:62388:29:29:56:553:493:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:the mechanism to explain why import decisions correlate with political relations and bring original data
34:733:62492:29:29:56:165:464:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:to test the relationship.
34:734:62517:29:29:74:553:435:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Where governments maintain control over the economy, trade continues to follow the flag. We argue
34:735:62614:29:28:56:553:406:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:that this is most likely to occur when the government holds an ownership stake in firms sufficient to
34:736:62715:28:29:56:553:378:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:influence their operations.  We show that negative political events with a trade partner reduce imports
34:737:62818:29:29:56:553:349:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:by China and India respectively, and that the magnitude of the change is greater in the state-controlled
34:738:62922:29:29:56:553:320:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:sector of the economy compared to the private sector.  More general indicators of political “closeness”
34:739:63025:29:29:56:553:291:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:between states, as measured by their UNGA voting alignment, follow a similar pattern. By showing that
34:740:63126:29:29:56:553:262:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:the relationship between foreign policy and imports is conditional on state ownership of firms, our study
34:741:63231:29:29:56:481:233:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:offers a new perspective on the debate about economic interdependence and cooperation.
34:742:63317:29:29:74:553:204:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:The paper also addresses the political economy of state ownership.   It is not surprising that state
34:743:63417:29:29:56:553:175:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:control over economic actors would shift their behavior. Yet the literature has paid insufficient attention
34:744:63524:29:28:56:553:146:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:to how state interests shape trade patterns as a function of state control. Even as market-based economic
34:745:63629:28:29:56:553:118:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:policies are the norm, many states continue to exercise (or even expand) control over selected sectors.
34:746:63732:29:29:56:553:89:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:With China’s emergence as the world’s second largest economy, state influence over economic actors
34:747:63830:29:0:56:553:60:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:becomes an even more important avenue of inquiry.  Our findings also extend to India, suggesting that
35:748:63933:0:29:56:553:708:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:the phenomenon is neither “China-specific” nor driven by regime type.  Understanding the role of state
35:749:64035:29:29:56:553:679:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:ownership  is  increasingly  important  as  the  governments  of  a  number  of  other  emerging  countries—
35:750:64143:29:29:56:553:650:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Brazil, Indonesia, Russia, South Africa, and Venezuela among them—have reversed course and taken
35:751:64239:29:29:56:546:621:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:steps to preserve or expand the presence of state-owned enterprises in key sectors (World Bank, 2014).
35:752:64341:29:29:74:553:592:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:Future research should address the effectiveness of these strategies. From both theoretical and policy
35:753:64443:29:29:56:553:563:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:perspectives, it is important to know whether states modify their behavior to avoid negative effects on
35:754:64546:29:28:56:553:534:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:trade flows. New studies highlight evidence that China’s commercial relations enhance its foreign policy
35:755:64650:28:29:56:553:506:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:influence (Flores-Mac ́ıas and Kreps, 2013; Kastner, forthcoming). At the same time, scholars have been
35:756:64753:29:29:56:553:477:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:unable to draw strong inferences about the causal effect between political relations and trade given the
35:757:64857:29:29:56:553:448:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:challenge to identify exogenous sources of variation in political relations.  We circumvent this problem
35:758:64961:29:29:56:553:419:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:by comparing import flows across sectors within the same country. Outside of our proposed mechanism,
35:759:65061:29:29:56:553:390:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:improved relations would have a similar effect across sectors.  In addition, since China and India have
35:760:65164:29:29:56:553:361:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:only emerged in the past decade as economic powers with markets large enough to sway other countries,
35:761:65265:29:29:56:553:332:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:there is less concern about entrenched patterns of endogenous sanctioning and cooperation.  Over time,
35:762:65367:29:29:56:553:303:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:partners  who  trade  heavily  in  the  sectors  with  large  shares  of  state  ownership  may  experience  trade
35:763:65481:29:0:56:413:274:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:punishment sufficiently often that they will begin to modify their behavior.
