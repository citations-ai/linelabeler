2:38:2360:28:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:Older adults have the highest rates of many health conditions for which medical marijuana may 
2:39:2454:14:14:72:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:be effective in moderating symptoms and are at elevated risk of reducing labor supply due to poor 
2:40:2551:14:14:72:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:health. Surprisingly little is known about how this group responds to medical marijuana laws. We 
2:41:2647:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:provide the first estimates of the effects of state medical marijuana laws on the health and labor 
2:42:2745:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:supply of adults age 51 and older, focusing on those with medical conditions that may respond to 
2:43:2841:14:14:72:546:504:12:Times:12:Times:medical marijuana. We use longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study to study these 
2:44:2936:14:14:72:545:490:12:Times:12:Times:questions  using  differences-in-differences regression  models.  Three  principle  findings  emerge 
2:45:3036:14:14:72:545:476:12:Times:12:Times:from our analysis. First, we document that medical marijuana law passage leads to reductions in 
2:46:3131:14:14:72:546:462:12:Times:12:Times:chronic pain and improvements in self-assessed health among older adults. Second, we show that 
2:47:3225:14:14:72:545:448:12:Times:12:Times:passage  of  a  state  medical  marijuana  law  leads  to  increases in  older  adult  labor  supply,  with 
2:48:3332:14:14:72:546:434:12:Times:12:Times:effects concentrated on the intensive margin. Third, effects are largest among older adults with a 
2:49:3430:14:14:72:545:420:12:Times:12:Times:health  condition  that  would  qualify  for  legal  medical  marijuana  use  under current  state  laws. 
2:50:3535:14:42:72:470:406:12:Times:12:Times:Findings highlight the role of health policy in supporting work among older adults.

3:64:3885:0:36:72:208:708:17:g_d0_f4:17:g_d0_f4:1    Introduction
3:65:3902:36:24:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Legalization  of  marijuana,  for  medicinal  or  recreational  use,  is  highly  controversial  in  the
3:66:4006:24:24:72:540:648:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:United States (Anderson & Rees, 2014).  On the one hand, critics argue that any legalization
3:67:4098:24:24:72:540:624:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:of  marijuana  will  increase  marijuana  addiction,  misuse  of  related  substances,  crime  and
3:68:4196:24:24:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:violence, traffic accidents, and healthcare costs.  Advocates, on the other hand, highlight the
3:69:4291:24:24:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:potential health benefits of medical marijuana, in particular in terms of managing symptom
3:70:4381:24:24:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:burden.  Public support for legalization of medical marijuana has surged with well over three
3:71:4474:24:24:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:quarters of U.S. residents supporting some form of legalization of this product for medical
3:72:4565:24:23:72:539:504:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:purposes1and, as of 2017, 29 U.S states and the District of Columbia (DC) have passed laws
3:73:4655:23:24:72:540:481:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:legalizing medical use of marijuana (‘MMLs’).  Given this tension, policymakers must have
3:74:4744:24:24:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:a solid evidence base on both the potential costs and benefits of expanded access as they
3:75:4833:24:24:72:371:433:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:determine how best to regulate marijuana for medical use.
3:76:4890:24:24:89:539:409:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:The available clinical trial evidence suggests that medical marijuana is effective in treat-
3:77:4982:24:24:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:ing symptoms associated with several health conditions including chronic pain, nausea and
3:78:5071:24:24:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:vomiting, and sleep disorders (Hill, 2015; Goldenberg, Reid, IsHak, & Danovitch, 2017; Mc-
3:79:5161:24:24:72:540:337:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Cormick et al., 2017).  Older adults adults experience higher prevalence of many of the health
3:80:5255:24:24:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:conditions with symptoms that can be effectively treated with medical marijuana (Morgan,
3:81:5343:24:24:72:540:289:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:2003; Unruh et al., 2008; Nahin, 2015) and are more likely to use prescription medications
3:82:5433:24:24:72:540:265:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:to treat symptom burden (National Center for Health Statistics, 2017).  In 2015, 29 percent
3:83:5524:24:23:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:of the overall adult population reported lower back pain, 35 percent of adults age 45 years
3:84:5615:23:24:72:540:218:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:and  older  reported  this  condition  (Barbour,  2017).   In  addition,  while  22.7  percent  of  all
3:85:5718:24:24:72:540:194:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:adults suffer from arthritis, the prevalence of this condition is 29.3 percent among adults 45
3:86:5812:24:24:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:to 64 years and 49.6 percent among adults 65 years and older (Barbour, 2017).  Despite high
3:87:5903:24:18:72:540:146:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:rates of conditions that might respond to medical marijuana,  older adults are understud-

4:92:6239:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:extrapolated to the older adult population.  A recent National Academies of Science report
4:93:6329:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:emphasized the need for observational and experimental research to inform clinical decision-
4:94:6421:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:making related to medical marijuana use among understudied populations including older
4:95:6507:24:24:72:239:612:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:adults (McCormick et al., 2017).
4:96:6539:24:24:89:539:588:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Given typical age patterns of disease, the health benefits of MML passage may be concen-
4:97:6627:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:trated among older adults if medical marijuana access leads to improved symptom control.
4:98:6715:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:If access to marijuana for medical purposes through passage of an MML reduces symptoms
4:99:6801:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:associated  with  work-impeding  health  conditions  such  as  arthritis  and  chronic  pain,  this
4:100:6900:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:access could lead to enhanced participation in the labor market within the fastest growing
4:101:6990:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:segment of the population.  Extending the work lives of older Americans can facilitate greater
4:102:7084:23:24:72:446:445:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:retirement savings and potentially delay Social Security benefit claiming.
4:103:7158:24:24:89:539:421:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:To date,  studies of MML health and labor effects have focused on youth and working
4:104:7241:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:age/pre-retirement  age  populations  and,  in  particular,  have  not  considered  outcomes  for
4:105:7338:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:those over age 65. However, understanding the effects for older adults is important given that
4:106:7432:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:poor health is frequently cited as a reason for older adult labor force exit (Dwyer & Mitchell,
4:107:7527:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:1999; McGarry, 2004; Case & Deaton, 2005; Datta Gupta & Larsen, 2010; Garthwaite, 2012;
4:108:7614:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Kaila-Kangas et al., 2014).  Rapid growth in the size of the aging population, predicted to
4:109:7705:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:reach 20.9 percent of the population by 2050, suggests a particular need to understand the
4:110:7795:24:24:72:466:253:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:effects of MMLs for this demographic (Ortman, Velkoff, Hogan, et al., 2014).
4:111:7871:24:24:89:539:229:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:In  this  paper,  we  help  address  this  critical  gap  in  the  literature  by  testing  the  effect
4:112:7974:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:of medical marijuana laws on several health outcomes (chronic pain,  work-limiting health
4:113:8063:23:24:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:conditions, self-assessed health, and depression), and measures of labor supply along both

5:126:9282:24:24:71:539:492:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:that passage of an MML leads to reductions in chronic pain and improved self-assessed health
5:127:9374:24:23:71:539:468:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:among older adults.  For example, post-MML the probability of assessing one’s health as very
5:128:9466:23:24:71:539:445:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:good or excellent increases by 3 percent.  (ii) Passage of an MML leads to an increase in the
5:129:9559:24:24:71:539:421:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:probability of full-time employment by 3 percent and weekly hours worked (conditional on
5:130:9647:24:24:71:539:397:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:working) by 3 percent.  Because we do not find evidence that passage of an MML changes the
5:131:9737:24:24:71:539:373:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:probability of any work, we interpret our findings to imply that passage of an MML allows
5:132:9826:24:24:71:539:349:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:currently  working  older  adults  to  increase  their  participation  in  the  labor  market  rather
5:133:9927:24:24:71:539:325:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:than  motivating  a  return  to  paid  employment  for  those  older  adults  who  have  previously
5:134:10026:24:24:71:539:301:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:left  the  labor  market  due  to  health  conditions.   We  hypothesize  that  the  observed  health
5:135:10127:24:24:71:539:277:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:improvements may drive the labor supply effects.  (iii) Overall, we find that MML effects,
5:136:10217:24:24:71:539:253:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:both for health and labor supply, are concentrated among older adults likely to use marijuana
5:137:10310:24:24:71:539:229:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:for medical purposes based on their health histories, suggesting that any adverse health and
5:138:10402:24:23:71:539:205:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:labor supply reductions attributable to medical marijuana use in this population are more
5:139:10491:23:24:71:316:182:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:than offset by improved symptom management.
5:140:10534:24:24:89:539:158:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Our  results  have  immediate  implications  for  both  state  and  federal  policymakers  con-

6:160:12142:24:24:72:540:245:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:in terms of the conditions that qualify patients for medical marijuana.  Common qualifying

9:232:18305:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:20 to 29 and 30 to 39, but not other demographic groups.  Abouk and Adams (2018) show
9:233:18390:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:that, post-MML, cardiovascular deaths increase by 2.3 percent among men and 1.2 percent
9:234:18477:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:among women.  Effect sizes are even larger among older adults (defined as adults 65 years
9:235:18566:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:and older).  Finally, Ullman (2016) shows that passage of an MML reduces work absences
9:236:18652:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:by 8.4 percent to 8.7 percent among workers 15 to 65 years of age in the Current Population
9:237:18743:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Survey (CPS), although MML effects are somewhat sensitive to alternative specifications for
9:238:18834:24:24:72:185:301:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:workers ages 50 to 65.
9:239:18856:24:24:89:539:277:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Evidence  suggests  that  patients  are  using  marijuana  medically  to  treat  symptoms  as-

9:241:19037:24:24:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:available survey data does not, to the best of our knowledge, allow researchers to separately
9:242:19130:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:examine medical and recreational marijuana use, insight can be gleaned from medication use
9:243:19220:23:24:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:patterns.  Two recent studies take this indirect approach.  Bradford and Bradford (2016) an-
9:244:19312:24:24:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:alyze prescription drug use patterns among Medicare patients, documenting declines in filled
9:245:19404:24:24:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:prescriptions for therapeutic substitutes for a number of conditions including pain, anxiety,
9:246:19497:24:0:72:540:110:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:depression,  nausea,  psychosis,  seizures,  and  sleep  disorders  among  patients  in  states  with
10:247:19599:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:legal access to medical marijuana.  The magnitude of the prescription declines is non-trivial;
10:248:19693:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:5.7 percent for pain medications, 5.0 percent for anxiety medications, 5.4 percent for nausea
10:249:19786:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:medications, and 4.5 percent for psychosis medications.  In a follow up study, Bradford and
10:250:19877:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Bradford (2017) document similar drops in use for therapeutic substitutes following passage
10:251:19968:24:24:72:326:612:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:of MML passage within the Medicaid population.
10:252:20014:24:24:89:539:588:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Three studies suggest that passage of an MML leads to a reduction in opioid use, opioids
10:253:20102:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:are used to treat chronic pain and thus are plausibly therapeutic substitutes for marijuana.
10:254:20194:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Bachhuber, Saloner, Cunningham, and Barry (2014) use mortality data to show that passage
10:255:20282:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:of an MML reduces the opioid overdose rate by 24.8 percent.  Similarly, Powell, Pacula, and
10:256:20373:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Jacobson  (2015)  document  that  legal  access  to  medical  marijuana  reduces  admissions  to
10:257:20469:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:SUD treatment for opioid use and overdose deaths attributable to opioids.  Finally, Ozluk
10:258:20558:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:(2017) finds lower prescription opioid spending following MML passage.  Collectively, these
10:259:20649:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:findings suggest that (i) some individuals, in particular older individuals, are using marijauna
10:260:20745:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:medically  post-MML  and  (ii)  passage  of  an  MML  leads  to  substitution  towards  medical
10:261:20840:24:24:72:399:373:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:marijuana and away from more conventional treatment options.
10:262:20900:24:24:89:539:349:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:To the best of our knowledge, only one study explores the effect of MML implementation
10:263:20986:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:on labor market outcomes.  Sabia and Nguyen (2016) leverage data from the CPS among
10:264:21069:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:adults ages 18 to 64.  The authors document that passage of an MML decreases wages by
10:265:21154:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:2.8  percent  among  males  ages  20  to  29  years,  but  passage  is  largely  unrelated  to  wages
10:266:21255:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:among other groups and unrelated to measures of considered labor supply (any work and
10:267:21340:24:24:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:conditional hours worked).  The authors do not find evidence that passage of an MML affects
10:268:21431:24:23:72:350:205:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:these measures among individuals ages 50 to 64 years.
10:269:21484:23:24:89:539:182:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Our study makes several contributions that extend the medical marijuana literature.  We
10:270:21571:24:24:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:focus on older adults, 51 years and above, the population that is most likely to suffer from the
10:271:21667:24:24:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:health conditions for which marijuana may be effective in treating symptoms.  Because we
10:272:21755:24:0:72:540:110:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:have detailed health history information, we are able to isolate samples of older adults who
11:273:21848:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:suffer from the health conditions with symptoms treatable with marijuana.  We can carefully
11:274:21939:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:consider a range of clinically relevant mechanisms including chronic pain and mental health
11:275:22030:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:problems.  Finally, we are able to include person fixed effects as an alternative control for
11:276:22123:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:omitted  variable  bias.   Our  study  of  older  adults  fills  a  knowledge  gap  for  policymakers,
11:277:22225:24:54:72:249:612:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:healthcare providers, and patients.

11:280:22288:32:23:72:540:484:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Medical  marijuana  offers  a  new  treatment  option  for  patients  suffering  from  a  number  of
11:281:22388:23:24:72:540:461:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:health conditions.  While marijuana cannot cure underlying conditions, medicinal use may
11:282:22476:24:24:72:540:437:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:reduce  symptoms.   As  noted  in  the  previous  section,  there  is  evidence  that  patients  may
11:283:22576:24:24:72:540:413:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:substitute  medical  marijuana  for  other  conventional  treatments  (Bachhuber  et  al.,  2014;
11:284:22673:24:24:72:540:389:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Powell  et  al.,  2015;  Bradford  &  Bradford,  2016,  2017;  Ozluk,  2017).   These  substitution
11:285:22772:24:24:72:540:365:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:patterns are particularly relevant for older adults, as this population is much more likely to
11:286:22866:24:24:72:540:341:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:use prescription medications to treat symptoms associated with chronic health conditions
11:287:22954:24:24:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:than younger populations (National Center for Health Statistics, 2017).  However, the extent
11:288:23046:24:24:72:540:293:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:to which such medication substitution affects patient health outcomes isex anteambiguous.
11:289:23135:24:24:72:540:269:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A complicating factor in predicting the health effects of MML passage is that medication –
11:290:23225:24:24:72:540:245:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:be it marijuana or any other medication – effectiveness varies across patients (Porter, 2010).
11:291:23319:24:23:89:539:221:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Patient health and symptom burden should improve if medical marijuana is more effective
11:292:23406:23:24:72:540:198:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:than a patient’s previous treatment program (which may include no treatment) and/or has
11:293:23493:24:24:72:540:174:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:a less aggressive side effect profile, and worsen if marijuana is a less effective treatment.  If
11:294:23590:24:24:72:540:150:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:MML passage primarily leads to increases in recreational use (Wen et al.,  2015),  then we
11:295:23680:24:24:72:522:126:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:expect no improvement, and perhaps a decline, in health for the new recreational users.
11:296:23767:24:0:89:539:102:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Even  if  marijuana  is  more  effective  than  a  patient’s  previous  treatment,  switching  to
12:297:23865:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:medical marijuana may also have adverse patient health effects if this substitution induces
12:298:23956:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:patients to terminate treatments addressing a broader set of symptoms.  For instance, the
12:299:24045:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:treatment  of  chronic  pain  is  often  characterized  by  utilization  of  both  prescription  medi-
12:300:24147:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:cations designed specifically to minimize pain symptoms and anti-depressants (Sansone &
12:301:24234:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Sansone,  2008).  Healthcare providers prescribe these medications in combination because
12:302:24323:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:some anti-depressants directly act on a different set of pain receptors than typical pain re-
12:303:24416:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:lievers,  and  because  depression  and  pain  can  co-occur.   Patients  who  opt  to  use  medical
12:304:24516:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:marijuana  (which  is  generally  obtained  outside  the  conventional  healthcare  system)  may
12:305:24612:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:lose access to valuable secondary treatments.  Moreover, regular interactions with healthcare
12:306:24705:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:providers, who may be better able to assess changes in health than patients themselves, may
12:307:24796:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:also decline as patients withdraw from conventional healthcare.  Finally, if patients co-use
12:308:24888:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:marijuana with other medications (Ozluk, 2017), drug interactions could harm health (U.S.

13:340:27367:24:24:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Study (HRS) 1992 to 2012 interview waves.  We truncate the sample in 2012-2013 to avoid
13:341:27454:24:24:72:540:181:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:confounding from passage of state recreational marijuana laws that were passed post-2012.
13:342:27543:24:24:72:540:157:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:The HRS is a nationally representative panel survey of Americans over 50 and their spouses
13:343:27633:24:24:72:540:133:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:administered biennially since 1992.  The survey is designed to track health and labor market
13:344:27725:24:0:72:540:109:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:outcomes among older adults, and is therefore well-suited to our study objectives.  Through
14:345:27818:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:the 2012 wave,  the HRS includes 247,233 interviews with 38,008 older persons.  After ex-
14:346:27907:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:cluding respondents based on residence outside the U.S., missing state, or proxy response,
14:347:27997:24:24:72:416:660:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:our analysis sample includes 183,032 respondent/year observations.
14:348:28063:24:24:89:539:636:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A limitation of the HRS, similar to all major surveys containing large samples of older
14:349:28150:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:adults and measures of health and labor supply of which we are aware, is that it does not
14:350:28239:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:collect information on marijuana use, either for medical or recreational purposes.  Therefore,
14:351:28333:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:our results have a an intent-to-treat (ITT) interpretation and reflect the numerous secondary
14:352:28426:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:pathways through which MMLs can affect health and labor supply in addition to medical
14:353:28511:24:46:72:450:516:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:use.  We discuss the plausibility of our effect sizes later in the manuscript.

14:357:28815:24:23:72:540:390:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:coded one if a state has an MML in place and zero otherwise.  Table 1 Column 1 reports

14:362:29107:24:24:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:marijuana  as  a  treatment  option,  are  measured  in  the  HRS,  and  have  a  plausible  link  to
14:363:29208:24:24:72:540:217:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:labor supply.  Specifically, (i) any chronic pain, (ii) depressive symptoms (measured by an

14:365:29392:24:24:72:540:169:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:[CES-D]  used in  the HRS), (iii)  health limiting  the ability  to work,  and (iv) self-assessed

14:367:29568:24:0:89:539:121:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:These HRS survey items mirror questions that healthcare providers would use to diagnose
15:368:29657:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:and treat conditions such as pain and depression; conditions that are are subjective by nature
15:369:29751:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:(National Institutes of Health, 2011).  For example, the National Institutes of Health advises
15:370:29845:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:that ‘Pain is a very personal and subjective experience. There is no test that can measure and
15:371:29939:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:locate pain with precision’ (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2011). Self-assessed health has
15:372:30034:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:been shown to predict, even after conditioning on observable characteristics, more objective
15:373:30126:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:measures of health status such as mortality and healthcare utilization (Benjamins, Hummer,

15:375:30316:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:mental  and  physical  health  (Apouey  &  Clark,  2015).   The  CES-D  measures  of  depressive
15:376:30412:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:symptomatology have been validated in numerous settings (Radloff, 1977; Turvey, Wallace,
15:377:30500:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:& Herzog, 1999).  These measures are frequently used in the economics and policy analysis

15:380:30735:24:24:89:539:421:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:We  examine  three  measures  of  labor  supply:  (i)  any  work  in  the  past  year  (0/1),  (ii)

15:383:31010:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:work.   We  take  the  logarithm  of  usual  hours  worked,  thus  coefficient  estimates  have  the
15:384:31110:24:46:72:367:325:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:interpretation of an approximation of the percent change.

15:387:31284:24:24:71:539:223:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:account for several time-varying state characteristics that may be correlated with both the

15:389:31463:24:18:71:539:175:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:this end, we include an indicator for whether a state has decriminalized marijuana (Pacula,

15:392:31765:12:12:72:540:129:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:not appreciably different if we instead exclude observations with missing personal characteristics from the

16:418:33513:23:24:72:540:184:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:the standard errors around the state (Bertrand, Duflo, & Mullainathan, 2004).  All results
16:419:33603:24:24:72:540:160:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:are unweighted.  In a complimentary set of regressions,  we replace state fixed effects with
16:420:33695:24:24:72:540:136:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:person fixed effects. Thus, we leverage within-person variation in exposure to MMLs and can,
16:421:33787:24:0:72:537:112:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:arguably, better mitigate bias from omitted, but time-invariant, respondent-level variables.
17:422:33881:0:24:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Although the HRS does not include information on medical marijuana use, the survey
17:423:33963:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:collects  information  about  many  of  the  underlying  symptoms  and  health  conditions  that
17:424:34059:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:would qualify for medical marijuana within states that have passed an MML. We construct an
17:425:34149:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:indicator of whether a respondent appears to qualify for medical marijuana (the ‘qualifying
17:426:34240:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:sample’)  if  they  report  (i)  current  cancer  treatment,  (ii)  current  glaucoma,  (iii)  current

17:429:34531:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:fails to identify those respondents with rare diagnoses such as multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS,
17:430:34624:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:and epilepsy, which are not measured in the HRS. We estimate all specifications of Equation
17:431:34715:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:1 in the full sample and the qualifying sample.  We expect that the relationships between
17:432:34804:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:MMLs  and  our  outcome  variables  will  be  stronger  in  the  qualifying  sample  than  the  full

17:434:34992:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:clinical use.  To the best of our knowledge, the HRS is the only large scale survey of older
17:435:35084:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:adults that includes sufficient information to identify the population most likely to benefit

18:448:36091:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:full time, while the mean hours worked per week conditional on any work is 36.7 (34.8).  13
18:449:36182:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:percent of the full sample and 15 percent of the qualifying sample reside in a state with an
18:450:36274:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:MML. The individual characteristics are comparable to an older sample and the state-level
18:451:36363:24:46:72:306:588:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:characteristics reflect the national as a whole.

18:453:36456:32:24:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:We first explore the effect of MML passage on older adult health.  Results are reported in
18:454:36546:24:24:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Table 3.  Overall, we find that the health effects of MML passage are concentrated in pain
18:455:36636:24:24:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:and self-assessed health, we find no statistically significant evidence that MMLs are linked
18:456:36728:24:24:72:540:438:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:with either the probability of reporting that health limits the ability to work or depressive
18:457:36821:24:24:72:540:414:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:symptomology.  We find that the health effects are more substantial in the qualifying sample
18:458:36913:24:23:72:540:390:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:than in the full sample.  We interpret the more substantial (in terms of magnitude) effects in
18:459:37007:23:24:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:the qualifying sample to imply that marijuana obtained following an MML is used medically
18:460:37096:24:24:72:540:343:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:by a non-trivial share of respondents in this sample.  More specifically, passage of an MML
18:461:37187:24:24:72:540:319:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:leads to a 0.2 percentage point (0.6 percent) reduction in chronic pain and a 1.4 percentage
18:462:37279:24:24:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:point (3.4 percent) increase in the probability of reporting very good or excellent self-assessed
18:463:37376:24:24:72:540:271:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:health; although the MML estimate in the pain regression is imprecise.  Within the qualifying
18:464:37469:24:24:72:540:247:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:sample we find that passage of an MML leads to a statistically significant 2.2 percentage
18:465:37558:24:24:72:540:223:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:point  (5.1  percent)  reduction  in  reporting  pain  and  a  2.5  percentage  point  (7.8  percent)
18:466:37659:24:24:72:426:199:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:increase in the probability of reporting very good or excellent health.
18:467:37730:24:24:89:539:175:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Based on age alone, the Azofeifa (2016) results suggest that 3.6 percent of our full sample
18:468:37821:24:24:72:540:151:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:and 3.3 percent of the qualifying sample had marijuana use in the past month.  Our point
18:469:37909:24:23:72:540:127:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:estimates  are  consistent  with  a  portion  of  these  users  receiving  therapeutic  benefit.   For
18:470:38011:23:0:72:540:104:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:example,  the  pain  results  translate  to  one-sixth  of  all-cause  marijuana  users  in  the  age
19:471:38114:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:group experiencing a reduction in pain based on the full sample and one-third based on the

19:474:38281:31:24:72:540:606:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Table 4 reports results on the effect of MML passage on older adult labor supply.  We find no
19:475:38374:24:24:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:statistically significant evidence that MML passage leads to changes on the extensive margin
19:476:38466:24:24:72:540:558:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:of labor supply:  the coefficient estimates, in both the full sample and the qualifying sample,
19:477:38561:24:24:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:in the any employment regressions are small in magnitude and imprecise.  We interpret this
19:478:38651:24:24:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:finding  to  suggest  that  MML  passage  does  not  draw  older  workers  into  the  labor  market
19:479:38750:24:24:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:(or,  perhaps more accurately,  allow older workers to re-enter the labor market).  We next
19:480:38841:24:24:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:consider the effect of MML passage on the intensive margin of labor supply:  full time work
19:481:38932:24:24:72:540:438:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:propensity and conditional hours worked per week.  We observe that passage of an MML
19:482:39016:24:24:72:540:414:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:leads to increases in labor supply along both of these measures.  More specifically, passage of
19:483:39111:24:23:72:540:390:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:a MML leads to a 0.8 percentage point (3.1 percent) increase in the probability of fulltime
19:484:39202:23:24:72:469:367:12:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:work and a 3.3 percent increase in hours worked per week in the full sample.6
19:485:39279:24:24:89:539:343:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:The magnitude of the MML effects are more substantial within the qualifying sample:
19:486:39362:24:24:72:540:319:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:passage of an MML leads to a 1.1 percentage point (5.8 percent) increase in the probability of
19:487:39456:24:24:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:working fulltime and a 6 percent increase in weekly hours worked (conditional on any work).
19:488:39547:24:24:72:540:271:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:The combination of our health and labor supply effects suggest that, on average, improved
19:489:39636:24:24:72:540:247:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:capacity  to  work  dominates  any  work-impeding  effects  of  marijuana  use  (recreational  or
19:490:39733:24:24:72:540:223:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:medical).  In particular, we hypothesize that reductions in symptoms associated with chronic
19:491:39825:24:18:72:540:199:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:health  conditions  (e.g.,  pain)  and  overall  well-being,  as  measured  by  self-assessed  health,
19:492:39927:18:16:85:539:181:7:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f8:6In line with the null findings for any employment, including those respondents who do not report any
19:493:40028:16:12:72:540:165:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:work leads to a small positive, but imprecise, coefficient estimate.  We interpret these null findings generated
19:494:40140:12:12:72:540:153:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:in  the  unconditional  sample  as  further  evidence  that  labor  supply  effects  are  driven  by  changes  on  the
19:495:40258:12:12:72:540:141:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:intensive margin.  Moreover, because we do not observe MML effects on the extensive margin, we believe
19:496:40360:12:12:72:540:129:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:that our conditional hours worked findings are not likely driven by conditional-on-positive bias (Angrist &

20:511:41404:31:24:72:540:311:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:The principle assumption underlying DD models is that outcomes in the treatment (ever-
20:512:41490:24:24:72:540:287:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:MML) states and comparison states would have trended similarly had the treatment group
20:513:41576:24:24:72:540:263:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:not been treated (i.e., the ‘parallel trends’ assumption).  This assumption, while necessary
20:514:41668:24:24:72:540:239:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:for DD models to recover causal effects, is inherently untestable as the treatment group was
20:515:41760:24:24:72:540:215:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:in fact treated and therefore the counterfactual is not observed.  To verify that states had

21:528:42511:23:24:72:540:525:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:may absorb differences in trends for MML versus non-MML states which could lead us to
21:529:42596:24:24:72:540:501:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:falsely conclude that these two groups of states moved in parallel pre-MML (Wolfers, 2006).
21:530:42687:24:24:72:540:477:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:We view a model without state trends as a more conservative test of parallel trends than a
21:531:42777:24:24:72:540:453:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:model with trends.  However, results are not appreciably different than those reported when
21:532:42868:24:24:72:210:429:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:we do include state trends.
21:533:42895:24:24:89:539:405:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Results of the parallel trends tests are reported in Appendix Tables A1 (health) and A2

21:535:43076:24:24:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:different from zero, we argue that the parallel trends test results do not invalidate the ability
21:536:43173:24:24:72:540:333:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:of our data to recover causal estimates.  First,  in the majority of regressions (12/16),  the
21:537:43267:24:24:72:539:309:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:coefficient  estimate  ofβ1is  not  statistically  different  from  zero.   Second,  in  two  of  the
21:538:43368:24:23:72:540:285:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:four  regressions  in  which  the  coefficient  estimate  ofβ1is  statistically  different  from  zero

21:541:43656:24:24:72:540:214:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:example, post-MML, the probability of reporting pain within the qualifying sample declines,
21:542:43747:24:24:72:540:190:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:but  the  coefficient  estimate  forβ1in  Equation  2  is  positive,  suggesting  that  chronic  pain
21:543:43848:24:24:72:540:166:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:was  increasing  in  treatment  states  relative  to  comparison  states  in  the  pre-MML  period.
21:544:43947:24:24:72:540:142:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Combining these two estimates suggests that we may understate the effect of MML passage
21:545:44034:24:46:72:540:118:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:on chronic pain and conditional hours worked in Equation 1, at least within the qualifying

22:548:44221:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:precisely estimated and positive in sign which may suggest that MML-passing states may
22:549:44307:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:have  been  experiencing  worsening  mental  health  conditions  prior  to  the  law  passage,  but
22:550:44406:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:we recovered no evidence that MML passage influenced this outcome in Equation 1.  Thus,

22:556:44824:24:24:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:our context, MMLs may be passed due to changes in health conditions within the state.  In
22:557:44913:24:24:72:540:438:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:this scenario, outcomes may induce changes in policies (MMLs) rather than policies inducing
22:558:45004:24:24:72:540:414:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:changes in outcomes. Such a phenomena would lead to policy endogeneity or reverse causality
22:559:45095:24:23:72:540:390:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:at the state-level.  A standard approach to examine the presence of policy endogeneity is to
22:560:45187:23:24:72:364:367:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:estimate an event study (Autor, 2003; Lovenheim, 2009).
22:561:45242:24:24:89:539:343:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:First,  we  center  the  data  around  the  law  effective  date  for  each  state  that  passed  an
22:562:45342:24:24:72:540:319:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:MML  during  our  study  period.   Next,  we  construct  leads  and  lags  around  the  effective
22:563:45439:24:24:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:date.   Specifically,  we  include  a  series  of  two-year  leads  and  lags  in  the  regression  from  -
22:564:45546:24:24:72:540:271:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:10 and -9 years to + 7 and +8 years pre- and post-MML. We impose endpoint restrictions
22:565:45632:24:24:72:540:247:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:following Kline (2011):  we assume that MML effects are not observable more than 10 years
22:566:45721:24:24:72:540:223:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:pre-passage and dissipate after 8 years.  We code states that do not pass an MML by 2013
22:567:45809:24:24:72:540:199:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:as  zero  for  all  lead  and  lag  variables  (Lovenheim,  2009).   We  exclude  state-specific  wave
22:568:45911:24:24:72:540:175:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:trends following Wolfers (2006) who argues that including time trends in models that allow
22:569:46001:24:24:72:540:151:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:for  dynamics  (as  event  studies  do)  complicates  the  interpretation  of  coefficient  estimates.
22:570:46103:24:23:72:540:127:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Statistically significant estimates of the leads suggest that policy endogeneity is present in
22:571:46197:23:0:72:540:104:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:our data.  However,  our ability to ‘control’ for such potential endogeneity can allow us to
23:572:46291:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:recover causal estimates of policy lags, which are the objects of primary interest in our study.
23:573:46387:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Moreover, examination of the coefficient estimates on the lags allows study of the dynamics
23:574:46478:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:in MML effects while Equation 1 forces a constant treatment effect in the post-MML period.
23:575:46568:24:24:89:539:636:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Results generated in event studies are reported in Figures 1 and 3 for the full sample and
23:576:46658:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:2 and 4 for the qualifying sample.  95 percent confidence intervals that account for within-
23:577:46750:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:state clustering (Bertrand et al., 2004) are reported with vertical lines.  Overall, our event
23:578:46844:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:studies  do  suggest  some  policy  endogeneity:  health  limits  work  was  increasing  in  the  full
23:579:46946:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:sample prior to MML adoption and hours worked were declining in the qualifying sample
23:580:47031:24:46:72:172:516:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:relative to baseline.

23:582:47109:32:24:72:540:438:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Passage  of  an  MML  may  alter  the  number  of  HRS  respondents  reporting  qualifying  con-
23:583:47205:24:24:72:540:414:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:ditions,  causing  us  to  our  analysis  sample  on  an  endogenous  variable.   This  can  lead  to
23:584:47306:24:23:72:540:390:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:conditional-on-positive bias in regression coefficients, a common concern in policy analysis
23:585:47398:23:24:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:(Angrist  &  Pischke,  2009).   However,  the  conditions  that  we  use  to  construct  the  eligible
23:586:47500:24:24:72:540:343:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:sample are not likely ‘cured’ by the use of medical marijuana, instead use of this medication
23:587:47593:24:24:72:540:319:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:may allow better symptom management.  Second, because patients must regularly consume
23:588:47678:24:24:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:marijuana to manage symptom burden they are not likely to ‘forget’ that they have a con-
23:589:47766:24:24:72:540:271:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:dition as they are regularly reminded of the condition through medication use.  Nonetheless,
23:590:47858:24:24:72:540:247:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:we explore this possibility by regressing the probability of being in the qualifying sample on
23:591:47952:24:24:72:540:223:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:the MML variable and other controls in Equation 1.  Results are reported in Appendix Table
23:592:48042:24:24:72:540:199:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A3.  We find no statistically significant evidence that MMLs affect the probability of being
23:593:48134:24:24:72:540:175:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:in the qualifying sample.  The coefficient estimate, while imprecise, carries a negative sign
23:594:48227:24:24:72:397:151:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:and is small relative to the baseline proportion (-0.01 vs.  0.55).
23:595:48294:24:23:89:539:127:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A related concern is program induced migration (Moffitt,  1992).  Older adults moving
23:596:48379:23:0:72:540:104:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:to  MML  states  as  a  result  of  law  passage  could  lead  to  bias  in  our  coefficient  estimates.
24:597:48486:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:We  regress  the  probability  that  an  HRS  respondent  migrated  across  state  lines  between
24:598:48583:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:interviews on the MML indicator and other controls in Equation 1.  Results are reported in
24:599:48673:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Table A3 and suggest that passage of an MML reduces the likelihood that a respondent moves
24:600:48763:24:24:72:539:636:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:by 0.7 percentage points (30.4 percent relative to the baseline proportion of 0.0237) in the full
24:601:48860:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:sample; we do not observe statistically significant evidence of such migration patterns in the
24:602:48954:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:qualifying sample.  Thus, some of our findings, at least within the full sample, may be driven
24:603:49048:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:by residents remaining in a state with an MML, when they might otherwise chose to move.
24:604:49135:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:However, the absolute value of the migration coefficient estimate is considerably smaller than
24:605:49229:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:the absolute value of the health and labor supply coefficient estimates, indicating that our
24:606:49321:24:46:72:388:492:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:results cannot be fully explained by MML-induced migration.

24:608:49445:32:24:72:540:414:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:We  next  re-estimate  Equation  1  using  only  those  respondents  who  do  not  qualify  for  the
24:609:49545:24:23:72:540:390:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:access to medical marijuana through the health conditions outlined earlier in the manuscript.
24:610:49638:23:24:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Appendix Tables A4 and A5 show no changes in health or labor supply for this group in
24:611:49723:24:24:72:540:343:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:response to MMLs, providing support for the hypothesis that results are largely driven by
24:612:49812:24:47:72:348:319:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:older adults utilizing marijuana medically post-MML.

24:614:49905:31:24:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Health policy scholars have noted that different types of MMLs may have differential impacts
24:615:49997:24:24:72:540:217:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:on both medical and recreational marijuana use (Anderson & Rees, 2014;  Pacula, Powell,
24:616:50084:24:24:72:540:193:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Heaton,  &  Sevigny,  2015;  Wen  et  al.,  2015).   To  explore  such  heterogeneous  effects,  we
24:617:50183:24:24:72:540:169:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:re-estimate Equation 1 for the following law provisions:  (i) cultivation permitted (home or
24:618:50275:24:18:72:540:145:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:group),  (ii)  operating  dispensaries,  (iii)  non-specific  pain  included  as  a  qualifying  health
24:619:50378:18:16:85:539:127:7:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f8:7We note that the relative effect size is large, but we suspect that this large relative effect is driven by
24:620:50486:16:39:72:368:111:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:the fact that few older adults in our sample move across state lines.
24:621:50555:39:0:300:312:72:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:22
25:622:50557:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:condition, and (iv) patient registration required (effective dates are reported in Columns 2-5
25:623:50651:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:of Table 1).  These first three provisions may improve medical and recreational access with
25:624:50742:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:potential price and quality spillovers to the illegal market, while registration aims to deter

25:626:50872:24:24:89:539:612:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Cultivation, operating dispensaries, and chronic pain as a qualifying conditions appear
25:627:50959:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:to drive our health findings (Appendix Table A6).  MMLs that require patients to register
25:628:51048:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:with  the  state  to  legally  access  medical  marijuana  are  unrelated  to  our  health  outcomes.
25:629:51149:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Cultivation and chronic pain as a qualifying health condition predict changes in labor supply

25:637:51741:24:24:71:539:313:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:alternative samples and regression specifications.  First, we exclude adults older than 75, who
25:638:51836:24:24:71:539:289:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:are unlikely to change their labor supply.  Second, we exclude California to ensure that our
25:639:51928:24:24:71:539:265:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:results are not driven by a single large, early-adopting state.  In our main analyses we control
25:640:52024:24:24:71:539:241:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:for between-state heterogeneity through the use of time-varying state characteristics (e.g.,
25:641:52116:24:24:71:539:217:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:wages),  state fixed effects,  and state-specific linear wave trends.  While this is a standard
25:642:52211:24:24:71:539:193:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:specification within the MML literature (Anderson et al., 2013; Sabia & Nguyen, 2016) the
25:643:52300:24:23:71:539:169:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:state  trends  may  throw  away  useful  variation  in  MML  effects  and  some  of  the  included
25:644:52398:23:24:71:539:146:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:time-varying state-level controls may in fact be outcomes of MMLs (Sabia & Nguyen, 2016)
25:645:52486:24:0:71:539:122:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:which could lead to over-controlling bias (Angrist & Pischke, 2009).  We estimate regressions
26:646:52581:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:models  that  (i)  exclude  state-specific  linear  waves  trends  and  (ii)  time-varying  state-level
26:647:52684:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:variables. Overall, our results are broadly robust to these alternative samples and approaches
26:648:52778:24:46:72:532:660:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:to addressing between-state heterogeneity though some checks lose statistical significance.

26:650:52911:32:24:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:There  are  established  sex  differences  in  terms  of  health  (e.g.,  women  are  more  likely  to

26:653:53197:24:24:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:particularly in an older sample such as we analyze in the HRS, see for example Banerjee
26:654:53284:24:23:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:and Blau (2016).  To explore such heterogeneity, we have estimated separate regressions for
26:655:53375:23:24:72:539:463:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:men and women.8Results are reported in Appendix Tables A10 (health) and A11 (labor
26:656:53457:24:24:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:supply).  We find interesting heterogeneity in health effects across gender.  Post-MML, both
26:657:53549:24:24:72:540:415:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:reported  pain  and  depressive  symptoms  decline  among  men,  but  not  women,  in  passing
26:658:53643:24:24:72:540:391:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:states.   However,  women,  but  not  men,  experience  improvements  in  self-assessed  health
26:659:53738:24:24:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:post-MML. In terms of labor supply, the sex-stratified regressions suggest that although the
26:660:53830:24:24:72:540:343:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:labor supply effects are stronger for men than for women (i.e., larger relative effect sizes and
26:661:53926:24:46:72:456:319:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:greater precision), both groups appear to increase labor supply post-MML.

26:663:54034:31:24:72:540:242:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:We conduct several robustness checks that we report in the text for brevity,  but that are
26:664:54124:24:24:72:540:218:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:available  on  request.   Our  identification  strategy  assumes  that  the  changes  in  health  and
26:665:54225:24:24:72:540:194:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:labor supply outcomes observed after states pass MMLs are driven by the laws themselves,
26:666:54313:24:24:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:and not an unobserved third factor that follows the same rollout pattern across states as the
26:667:54406:24:24:72:540:146:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:laws we study.  We test this hypothesis by conducting aMonte  Carlosimulation in which
26:668:54492:24:17:72:540:122:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:we randomly assign with replacement actual state legislative histories to our 50 states and
26:669:54583:17:33:85:457:105:7:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f8:8We chose to rely on the pooled sample in our main analyses to preserve sample size.

27:672:54771:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:estimates are small and statistically indistinguishable from zero in all regressions.  We have
27:673:54865:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:lagged the MMLs one year to allow for a time delay and outcomes; for example it make take
27:674:54954:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:some  time  for  older  adults  to  learn  about  medical  marijuana,  receive  a  recommendation,
27:675:55052:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:initiate marijuana use, and then experience improvements in symptom burden and increase
27:676:55139:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:participation in the labor market.  Results generated in models that include such a lag are
27:677:55230:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:comparable to our main results.  We have used alternative coding schemes for MMLs (i.e.,
27:678:55318:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Pacula et al. (2015) and Wen et al. (2015)).  Results are broadly comparable to those that
27:679:55408:24:24:72:219:516:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:we report in the manuscript.
27:680:55436:24:24:89:539:492:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Finally, we examined the effect of MML passage on a measure of arguably non-medical
27:681:55519:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:marijuana use among older adults:  admissions to substance use disorder treatment (SUD)
27:682:55606:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:with  marijuana  listed  as  the  primary  substance  of  abuse  in  the  Treatment  Episode  Data
27:683:55704:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Set  (TEDS).  We  constructed  the  rate  among  adults  55  years  and  older;  age  information
27:684:55801:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:provided in the TEDS precluded closer alignment with our HRS analysis sample in terms of
27:685:55889:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:age (i.e., 51 years and older).  More specifically, we estimated a version of Equation 1 using
27:686:55983:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:the  count  of  state-level  admissions  to  SUD  treatment  over  the  period  1992  to  2012.   We
27:687:56083:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:found no evidence that this measure of marijuana use was altered by an MML passage.  We
27:688:56170:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:found similar results using any indicator of marijuana use as the dependent variable.  While
27:689:56262:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:clearly not definitive, this null finding is suggestive, in combination with information from
27:690:56355:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:marijuana patients reported earlier in the manuscript, that older adults who use marijuana
27:691:56445:24:54:72:353:229:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:post-MML are using the product for medical purposes.
27:692:56497:54:36:72:189:175:17:g_d0_f4:17:g_d0_f4:7    Discussion
27:693:56512:36:24:72:540:139:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:In this study we provide new information to the current policy debate surrounding legaliza-
27:694:56603:24:0:72:540:115:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:tion of marijuana for medical purposes through state regulations.  Specifically,  we explore
28:695:56697:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:the effects of state medical marijuana laws (MMLs) on older adult health and labor supply
28:696:56786:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:outcomes.   Thus,  we  examine  an  understudied  yet  important  sub-group.   First,  we  docu-
28:697:56882:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:ment  that  reported  chronic  pain  declines  and  overall  assessments  of  one’s  health  improve
28:698:56982:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:post-MML  among  older  adults.   More  specifically,  post-MML  the  probability  of  reporting
28:699:57078:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:pain declines by 0.6 percent (statistically insignificant)and the probability of reporting one’s
28:700:57174:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:health as very good or excellent increases by 3.4 percent.  These findings suggest that access
28:701:57268:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:to medical marijuana through MMLs allows, at least some, older adults to better manage
28:702:57354:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:symptoms associated with chronic health  conditions.  Second,  we find that MML passage
28:703:57441:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:allows older adults who are currently working to increase their labor supply, but we do not
28:704:57532:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:find evidence that MMLs allows older adults to re-enter the labor market.  In particular, we
28:705:57624:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:find that passage of an MML increases the probability of working full time and the number
28:706:57713:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:of hours worked per week (among working adults) both increase by 3 percent.  Finally, health
28:707:57805:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:and labor supply effects are even larger among older adults who are likely to use marijuana
28:708:57896:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:for medical purposes based on their health histories; for example pain declines by a statisti-
28:709:57990:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:cally significant 2.2 percentage points among the 55 percent of our sample with one or more
28:710:58081:24:24:72:398:349:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:health conditions that would qualify for medical marijuana use.
28:711:58144:24:24:89:539:325:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A  key  concern  with  marijuana  regulation  is  that  expanded  access  will  promote  recre-
28:712:58239:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:ational,  and  not  medical,  use  of  the  product.   While  our  study  cannot  fully  address  this
28:713:58341:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:important question, our estimates can bring some evidence to bear for the older adult pop-
28:714:58431:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:ulation.  The fact that we identify improvements in health outcomes that plausibly capture
28:715:58521:24:24:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:symptom  burden  (i.e.,  reported  pain  and  overall  health  assessments)  and  increases  in  la-
28:716:58621:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:bor supply concentrated among those with medical marijuana qualifying conditions suggests
28:717:58710:23:24:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:that,  even  if  some  older  adults  do  use  marijuana  obtained  following  passage  of  an  MML
28:718:58809:24:24:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:recreationally, on average passage of an MML and the ensuing changes in health and labor
28:719:58897:24:24:72:355:134:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:supply confers important benefits to some older adults.
28:720:58952:24:0:89:539:110:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:We can compare our findings with a previous study that examines the labor market ef-
29:721:59038:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:fects of MML passage.  Sabia and Nguyen (2016) finds no change in employment propensity
29:722:59125:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:following passage of an MML, which is comparable to our null findings for any employment.
29:723:59214:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:However, while we document that older adults increase labor supply along the intensive mar-
29:724:59305:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:gin (defined as full time work and conditional hours worked) post-MML, Sabia and Nguyen
29:725:59392:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:(2016) find no statistically significant evidence that conditional hours worked increase.  We
29:726:59485:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:hypothesize that our focus on an older sample of workers than Sabia and Nguyen (2016) may
29:727:59574:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:explain this divergence in findings:  we examine workers who are 50 years and older while
29:728:59663:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Sabia and Nguyen (2016) examine workers through age 64.  Analysis of the Annual Social
29:729:59749:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey 1992-2012 indicates that 48
29:730:59833:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:percent of adults 50 years and older and 24 percent of adults ages 65 to 75 years report being
29:731:59927:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:in the labor force.  Thus, a non-trivial share of older workers are in the labor force and may
29:732:60021:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:increase their labor supply following passage of an MML. Moreover, as noted earlier in the
29:733:60111:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:manuscript, older workers are the types of workers who are most likely to experience many of
29:734:60203:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:the the health conditions whose symptoms may be effectively treated by medical marijuana,
29:735:60292:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:suggesting that these workers are precisely the workers one would expect to observe positive
29:736:60384:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:labor supply effects.  Finally, our confidence intervals overlap with Sabia and Nguyen’s confi-
29:737:60479:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:dence intervals; hence we cannot rule out that the two studies produce comparable estimates.
29:738:60571:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Collectively, these two studies shed important light on the full effects of MML passage on
29:739:60661:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:the labor market; Sabia and Nguyen document effects within working populations while we
29:740:60748:24:24:72:240:253:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:examine older adults specifically.
29:741:60782:24:24:89:539:229:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Our findings also contribute to a larger literature highlighting the role of health policies
29:742:60874:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:and access to medical treatments for older workers’ labor supply.  Pain medications may be
29:743:60964:23:24:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:particularly important for older workers. In addition to our results around medical marijuana
29:744:61057:24:24:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:access, Garthwaite (2012) found a 3.9 percentage point (10 percent) decline in labor supply
29:745:61148:24:24:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:among  adults  with  joint  conditions  following  the  sudden  withdrawal  of  Vioxx,  a  popular
29:746:61246:24:0:72:406:110:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:anti-inflammatory medication previously used to treat joint pain.
30:747:61313:0:24:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Our study has limitations.  (i) Our sample is potentially vulnerable to survivor bias, that
30:748:61404:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:is  we  only  observe  the  sample  of  older  adults  who  are  cognitively  and  physically  able  to
30:749:61507:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:complete their own interviews.  (ii) Our identification strategy only uses variation in MMLs
30:750:61599:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:for those states that implemented such laws during our study period.  (iii) As is the case in
30:751:61692:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:all other economics studies examining MML effects of which we are aware, we lack data on
30:752:61780:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:medical marijuana use in the HRS and our results have an ITT interpretation.  However,
30:753:61866:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:our  effects  are  comparable,  or  smaller  than,  other  ITT  effects  reported  in  the  literature.
30:754:61969:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:For instance, Bradford and Bradford (2016) show a that, post-MML, Medicare prescriptions
30:755:62057:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:decline  5.7  percent  for  pain  medications,  5.0  percent  for  anxiety  medications,  5.4  percent
30:756:62159:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:for  nausea  medications,  and  4.5  percent  for  psychosis  medications,  and  Bachhuber  et  al.
30:757:62258:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:(2014) show a 24.8 percent decline in opioid-related overdoses post-MML. Moreover, while
30:758:62346:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:the average treatment effect (ATT) is clearly important clinically, ITT is relevant for policy
30:759:62440:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:purposes due to the complex pathways that MMLs can lead to changes in health and labor
30:760:62526:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:supply.  Moreover, as noted earlier in the manuscript, MMLs are the lever available to policy
30:761:62619:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:makers.  (iv) We lack data on all health conditions for which medical marijuana may be an
30:762:62708:24:24:72:457:349:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:effective treatment for alleviating painful symptoms (e.g., anxiety, nausea).
30:763:62785:24:24:89:539:325:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:The policy debate surrounding legalization of marijuana, for medical or recreational pur-
30:764:62874:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:poses, is fierce.  In particular, with the Trump Administration’s proposal to renew Federal
30:765:62965:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:enforcement of marijuana possession laws in states with MMLs by allowing the Rohrabacher-
