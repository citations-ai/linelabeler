2:27:724:12:13:126:524:466:117:g_d0_f8:117:g_d0_f8:The   role   of   whistle-blowing as   a   mechanism   for deterring   corruption has   been 
2:28:816:13:12:90:525:453:117:g_d0_f8:117:g_d0_f8:conspicuously neglected in the economic literature. This is quite surprising given the increase in 
2:29:914:12:13:90:524:441:117:g_d0_f8:117:g_d0_f8:legislation   aimed   at   preventing   corruption   that  includes   whistle-blowing clauses   and   the 
2:30:1020:13:13:90:524:428:117:g_d0_f8:117:g_d0_f8:extensive  literature  on  whistle-blowing  outside  economics.  In fact, we  know  of no formal 
2:31:1117:13:12:90:522:415:117:g_d0_f8:117:g_d0_f8:economic model that deals squarely with the analysis of the role and potential impact of whistle-
2:32:1214:12:13:90:524:403:117:g_d0_f8:117:g_d0_f8:blowing  on  the  persistence  of  corruption  in  organizations. Therefore, in  an  attempt  to  at  least 
2:33:1320:13:13:90:524:390:117:g_d0_f8:117:g_d0_f8:partially  fill  this  gap, we  present a  theoretical  model  for  approaching  the  issue,  focusing 
2:34:1422:13:12:90:524:377:117:g_d0_f8:117:g_d0_f8:specifically  on  the  role  of  economic  incentives to  encourage  whistle-blowing  behaviour.  We 
2:35:1523:12:13:90:525:365:117:g_d0_f8:117:g_d0_f8:model  corruption  as  a  social  norm  of  behaviour  using  elements  of  evolutionary  game  theory 
2:36:1626:13:13:90:524:352:117:g_d0_f8:117:g_d0_f8:(EGT). We use  the  concept  of replicator  dynamics to explore  the  local  asymptotical  stability  of 
2:37:1731:13:12:90:524:339:117:g_d0_f8:117:g_d0_f8:several types  of  behaviour  within organizations:  (i)  honest, corrupt, and  honest whistle-blowing 
2:38:1833:12:13:90:398:327:117:g_d0_f8:117:g_d0_f8:and (ii) honest, corrupt whistle-blowing, and honest whistle-blowing.

3:47:2117:19:19:90:163:653:117:g_d0_f6:117:g_d0_f7:1. Introduction 
3:48:2132:19:19:108:524:634:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:Recently,  the  economics  of  corruption  has  given  rise  to  a  vast  body  of theoretical  and 
3:49:2232:19:19:90:525:615:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:empirical literature.1  However, the  role  of whistle-blowing  as  a  deterrence  mechanism  against 
3:50:2333:19:19:90:525:596:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:corruption has  been conspicuously neglected  in the literature.  This  is  quite  surprising  regarding 
3:51:2438:19:19:90:525:577:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:the  increase  in legislation aimed  at  preventing  corruption  that  includes  whistle-blowing  clauses2 
3:52:2543:19:19:90:524:558:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:and  the  extensive  literature  on  whistle-blowing  outside  economics.3 We  know  of  no  formal 
3:53:2642:19:19:90:522:539:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:economic model that deals squarely with the analysis of the role and potential impact of whistle-
3:54:2739:19:19:90:525:520:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:blowing  on  the persistence  of  corruption in  organizations.  Therefore,  in  an  attempt  to  at  least 
3:55:2847:19:19:90:525:501:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:partially  fill  this  gap,  we  present  a  theoretical  model  for  approaching  the  issue,  focusing 
3:56:2952:19:19:90:519:482:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:specifically on the role of economic incentives aimed at encouraging whistle-blowing behaviour. 
3:57:3047:19:19:108:524:463:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:A quick look at a  real life case study  will help clarify  the nature of  whistle-blowing and our 
3:58:3146:19:19:90:524:444:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:modelling  strategy.  In  Canada  in  the  mid-1990s,  the  Liberal  Party  implemented  a  federal 
3:59:3246:19:19:90:525:425:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:“sponsorship  programme”  in  Quebec  Province  in  an  attempt  to  increase  awareness  of  the 
3:60:3344:19:18:90:524:406:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:government’s  contributions  to  Quebec  and  discourage  its  separatism,  as  promoted  by  the 
3:61:3442:18:19:90:525:388:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:provincial  government  (Parti  Québécois).  This  programme  lasted  from  1996  until  2004,  when 
3:62:3543:19:19:90:525:369:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:corruption was exposed and its operations came under investigation by the Gomery Commission4. 
3:63:3637:19:19:90:524:350:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:The  allegations  of  corruption  in  the  programme  management  referred  mainly  to  payments  of 
3:64:3738:19:19:90:525:331:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:commissions  for  no  apparent  services  and  improper  advances  made  to  agencies  related  to  the 
3:65:3842:19:19:90:525:312:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:Liberal  Party.  These  accusations  focused  on  firms  favoured  by  the  sponsorship  programme  that 
3:66:3947:19:19:90:524:293:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:maintained Liberal organizers or fundraisers on their payrolls or donated back part of the money 
3:67:4044:19:19:90:525:274:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:to  the  Liberal  Party.  For  years,  this  was  an  ongoing  affair  until  Allan  Cutler,  a  civil  servant 
3:68:4156:19:19:90:524:255:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:working  for  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Government  Services,  lodged  a  complaint  that 
3:69:4259:19:19:90:525:236:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:prompted  a  departmental  audit  of  the  advertising  and  public  opinion  division.  Cutler  was  the 
3:70:4365:19:19:90:524:217:117:g_d0_f8:117:g_d0_f7:whistle-blower who detected and reported the anomalies in the Canadian sponsorship programme 
3:71:4458:19:44:90:425:198:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:and his actions triggered the so called “Sponsorgate” or “AdScam” scandal.

4:79:5178:0:19:108:525:691:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:Some  interesting  questions  arise  from  this  specific  case.  How  did  the  corrupt  activities 
4:80:5279:19:19:90:525:672:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:committed in the context of the sponsorship programme go on for such a long time without being 
4:81:5374:19:19:90:524:653:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:detected  or  reported?  It  is  highly  unlikely  that  this  programme  could  have  functioned  for  years 
4:82:5484:19:19:90:525:634:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:without  any  other  public  official  involved  in  it  not  knowing  about  the  illicit  and  even  illegal 
4:83:5595:19:19:90:525:615:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:activities  committed  within  the  administration  of  the  programme.  Why  did  they  not  denounce 
4:84:5698:19:19:90:524:596:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:these  activities?  Were  all  public  officials  working  in  the  programme  corrupt?  Finally,  if  public 
4:85:5808:19:19:90:525:577:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:officials  from  inside  the  organization  were  unable  or  unwilling  to  report  the  corrupt  activities, 
4:86:5919:19:19:90:426:558:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:how did these activities escape detection by external enforcement agencies? 
4:87:5994:19:19:108:524:539:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:Although  these  questions  are  based  on  the  specific  case  of  the  Canadian  sponsorship 
4:88:6090:19:19:90:525:520:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:programme  scandal,  they  apply  to  many  other  situations  in  developed  as  well  as  developing 
4:89:6193:19:19:90:524:501:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:countries  where  persistent  corrupt  activities  in  public  as  well  as  private  organizations  are 
4:90:6298:19:19:90:524:482:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:discovered  and  sanctioned  only  after  a  whistle-blower  reports  them  to  the  authorities  and  the 
4:91:6405:19:19:90:216:463:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:anomalies are made public.5 
4:92:6432:19:19:108:525:444:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:One element to consider here is that spontaneous  whistle-blowing behaviour  can be difficult 
4:93:6526:19:19:90:524:425:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:to  initiate  in  practice  because  it implies  costly  activities  and  typically garners no  economic 
4:94:6631:19:18:90:525:406:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:rewards   (Heyes   and   Kapur,  2008).   The  costs  of   whistle-blowing  include   monitoring  and 
4:95:6733:18:19:90:525:388:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:transaction  costs  associated  with  actually  reporting  a  corrupt  individual.  Clearly,  these  costs 
4:96:6840:19:19:90:525:369:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:depend  on  the  number  of  agents  within  the  organization  that  somehow  favour  the  corrupt 
4:97:6940:19:19:90:525:350:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:activities  being  committed.  Indeed,  the  monitoring  and  transaction  costs  of  reporting  illicit 
4:98:7045:19:19:90:524:331:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:activities  can  increase  as  more  people  within  the  organization  support  this  type  of  behaviour. 
4:99:7153:19:19:90:525:312:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:Thus,  one  way  to  approach  this  problem  is  to  model  corruption  as  a social  norm  of  behaviour, 
4:100:7261:19:19:90:524:293:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:assuming  that  the  illicit  activities  are  somehow  accepted  by most agents  as  valid  and  common 
4:101:7366:19:19:90:524:274:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:practices, so that going against them means going against the majority (see, for instance, Stephan, 
4:102:7466:19:49:90:198:255:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:2008; and Davis, 1999).

4:104:7536:7:15:90:524:199:36:g_d0_f7:79:g_d0_f7:5  Recent  events  in  Chile  provide  an  example  in  the  context  of  a  developing  country.  At  the  end  of 2007, widespread 
4:105:7669:15:10:90:524:184:79:g_d0_f7:79:g_d0_f7:corruption  was  discovered  in Chile  Deportes,  the  government’s  sports  organization.  Nearly  90%  of Chile  Deportes 
4:106:7792:10:10:90:524:174:79:g_d0_f7:79:g_d0_f7:projects had some type of anomaly (e.g., initiatives that were never started, false and nonexistent identities). It was later 
4:107:7918:10:10:90:524:164:79:g_d0_f7:79:g_d0_f7:discovered  that  much  of  the  money  that  went  to the  Valparaíso  Region Chile  Deportes branch  was  used  to  finance 
4:108:8043:10:11:90:523:154:79:g_d0_f7:79:g_d0_f7:political campaigns of members of the Coalition of Parties for Democracy, the governing political alliance: more often 
4:109:8162:11:10:90:524:143:79:g_d0_f7:79:g_d0_f7:known as the Concertación, this alliance has been in power since 1990. Jorge Schaulsohn, founder and former president 
4:110:8280:10:11:90:524:133:79:g_d0_f7:79:g_d0_f7:of  the  Party  for  Democracy,  was  one  of  the  first  whistle-blowers to report  this  type  of  corrupt activity in  the 
4:111:8407:11:10:90:524:122:79:g_d0_f7:79:g_d0_f7:Concertación. In a press interview, Schaulsohn argued that, during the time he presided over his party, all four parties 
4:112:8528:10:10:90:525:112:79:g_d0_f7:79:g_d0_f7:in the Concertación coalition received money from the government. Additionally, Schaulsohn reported that government 
4:113:8644:10:11:90:525:102:79:g_d0_f7:79:g_d0_f7:money had  also been used to directly  finance the  campaigns of Concertación  candidates. He  accused  the government 
4:114:8763:11:0:90:475:91:79:g_d0_f7:79:g_d0_f7:and the Concertación of an “ideology of corruption”. He was later expelled from the Party for Democracy. 
5:115:8913:0:19:108:525:691:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:By  analytically  approaching  corruption  as  a  social  norm,  we  can  infer  the  following 
5:116:9009:19:19:90:525:672:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:regularities.  First,  as  seen  in  practice  and  as  the  economic  literature  on  social  norms  recognizes, 
5:117:9123:19:19:90:524:653:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:once a social norm has been established, it is very difficult to break.6 Since most employees may 
5:118:9221:19:19:90:525:634:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:be following a social norm of behaviour by not reporting corrupt activities, it can be very hard for 
5:119:9322:19:19:90:524:615:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:any  external  enforcing  agency  to  detect  and  sanction  these  practices. Consequently,  corrupt 
5:120:9424:19:19:90:525:596:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:activities  can  go  on  for  many  years  without  being  detected.  Second,  given  this  inability  of 
5:121:9530:19:19:90:522:577:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f8:external  enforcing  agencies  to  detect  corrupt  behaviour  within  organizations,  an  inside whistle-
5:122:9636:19:19:90:524:558:117:g_d0_f8:117:g_d0_f7:blower is typically required to report these activities, thereby revealing the corrupt actions to the 
5:123:9738:19:19:90:525:539:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:public.  Third,  since  most  of  the  employees  may  be  complying  with  the  established  norm  of 
5:124:9841:19:19:90:525:520:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:behaviour,  denouncing  the  illicit  activities  can  be  costly  and  typically  implies  punishments  for 
5:125:9950:19:19:90:524:501:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:whistle-blowers (e.g., ostracism; retaliation, including being fired from the organization; or even 
5:126:10050:19:19:90:525:482:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:physical  violence).  In  the  case  of  the  sponsorship  scandal,  Allan  Cutler,  the  whistle-blower  who 
5:127:10160:19:19:90:524:463:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:lodged  the  complaint  that  triggered  the  departmental  audit,  was  transferred  to  the  technical  and 
5:128:10270:19:19:90:525:444:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:special services division of Public Works by the time the audit was underway and was later fired 
5:129:10367:19:19:90:222:425:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:by the Canadian government. 
5:130:10394:19:18:108:525:406:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:If we assume that the whistle-blowing individuals are honest (do not accept bribes), it is clear 
5:131:10490:18:19:90:525:388:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:that  no  payoff  maximiser  agent  will  be  a whistle-blower,  since  this  activity  will  only  lower  her 
5:132:10601:19:19:90:524:369:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f8:payoff  regardless  of  the  whistle-blowing  behaviour  of  the  others. This  implies  that,  in  order  to 
5:133:10710:19:19:90:524:350:117:g_d0_f8:117:g_d0_f7:study this phenomenon, a non-optimising framework is typically required.  This could explain,  at 
5:134:10808:19:19:90:524:331:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:least  partially, the  little  attention  that whistle-blowing behaviour  has  received  in  the  theoretical 
5:135:10917:19:19:90:246:312:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:economic literature on corruption.7 
5:136:10952:19:19:108:525:293:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:Some exceptions  are  the recent theoretical works by  Søreide  (2008)  and  Heyes  and  Kapur 
5:137:11046:19:19:90:525:274:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:(2008). Søreide  (2008)  presents  an  economic  framework for explaining  the  potential  reaction  of 
5:138:11149:19:19:90:524:255:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:multinationals to the loss of a contract because a competitor has offered a bribe. In particular, the 
5:139:11251:19:19:90:525:236:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:author  examines  the  impact  of  industry  structure  and  institutional quality  on  the  company’s 
5:140:11354:19:19:90:525:217:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:incentive  to  react  against  corruption.  The  paper  assumes  a  homogenous  output  in  a  standard 
5:141:11458:19:19:90:524:198:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:Cournot competition framework, considering in different contexts the potential costs and benefits 
5:142:11555:19:19:90:524:179:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:of a firm’ whistleblowing behaviour. That study concludes, first, that firms will not react against a 
5:143:11656:19:16:90:524:160:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:case  of  business  corruption  if it may  disturb  their  opportunities  to  obtain  cartel  profits,  and, 
5:144:11765:16:7:90:237:144:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:                                                
5:145:11812:7:11:90:417:137:36:g_d0_f7:79:g_d0_f7:6 See, for instance, Chapter 7 of Bowles (2004) and the many references presented therein. 
5:146:11902:11:14:90:524:126:36:g_d0_f7:79:g_d0_f8:7 In a similar line, Heyes and Kapur (2008: 4) argue: “The biggest hurdle in modeling whistle-blowing—and perhaps a 
5:147:12018:14:10:90:524:112:79:g_d0_f8:79:g_d0_f8:reason  why  the  phenomenon  has  not  proven  amenable  to  economic  analysis—follows  directly  from...the  adopted 
5:148:12138:10:11:90:524:102:79:g_d0_f8:79:g_d0_f8:definition. If the benefits from the activity accrue, by definition, to others and not the whistle-blower, such behavior is 
5:149:12262:11:0:90:435:91:79:g_d0_f8:79:g_d0_f7:not easily incorporated under conventional assumptions about rational, self-interested agents.” 
6:150:12403:0:19:90:524:691:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:second,  the  more  efficient  the  offender  of  the  crime,  the  lower  the  motivation  for the potential 
6:151:12513:19:19:90:524:672:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:whistle-blower  to  react.  Finally, the  reaction  of  a whistle-blower to corruption  can trigger other 
6:152:12619:19:19:90:486:653:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:obstacles if there are connections between local politicians and firms in the given market. 
6:153:12710:19:19:108:525:634:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:The  behavioural  model  of Heyes  and  Kapur  (2008)  adopts,  in  particular,  the  methods  of 
6:154:12808:19:19:90:524:615:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:behavioural law and economics. These authors put forward a general whistle-blower “motivation 
6:155:12902:19:19:90:525:596:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:function,”   which   relates   whistle-blower   propensity   to   the   characteristics   of   the   observed 
6:156:13012:19:19:90:524:577:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:malfeasance  and  the  enforcement  environment. Heyes  and  Kapur  (2008)  rely  on  evidence  from 
6:157:13113:19:19:90:525:558:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:sociology and psychology to explain why employees blow the whistle on law-breaking employers 
6:158:13205:19:19:90:524:539:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:even  though  it is not within  their  narrowly  defined  self-interest.  The  authors  identify  three 
6:159:13309:19:19:90:525:520:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:alternative  “schools  of  thought”,  adapt  the  general  motivation  function  to  correspond  to  each 
6:160:13415:19:19:90:525:501:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:school,  and  then  characterize  the  optimal  policy  in  each  case.  Their  main  conclusions  are,  first, 
6:161:13527:19:19:90:525:482:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:that  optimal  policy varies substantially  between  cases  and,  second,  the  value  of  the  information 
6:162:13634:19:19:90:524:463:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:that  whistle-blowers  bring  to  the  enforcement  agency,  and  what  the  agency  will  wish  to  do  with 
6:163:13744:19:19:90:524:444:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:that  information,  depend  upon  the  motives  ascribed  to the whistle-blowers.  Finally,  in  adjusting 
6:164:13851:19:19:90:524:425:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:the  enforcement  instruments,  attention  has  to  be  paid  to  the  change  induced  in  the  flow  of 
6:165:13957:19:18:90:524:406:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:disclosures, in addition to the direct effect on compliance incentives. In this case, the quantitative 
6:166:14060:18:19:90:407:388:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:and qualitative response will also depend upon whistle-blower motives. 
6:167:14130:19:19:108:524:369:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:Our work is related to that of Heyes and Kapur (2008), as we also study the whistle-blowing 
6:168:14221:19:19:90:525:350:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:behaviour of individuals within an organization but not firms’ reactions, as does  Søreide  (2008). 
6:169:14321:19:19:90:387:331:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:Nonetheless, we differ from these other articles in several respects. 
6:170:14390:19:19:108:524:312:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:First,  unlike  these  works,  we  explicitly  model  the  role  and  impact  of  whistle-blowing 
6:171:14488:19:19:90:524:293:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:behaviour on the stability  of  corruption.  Thus,  our  work  is  also  related  to  those  of  Lui  (1986), 
6:172:14598:19:19:90:525:274:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:Cadot  (1987),  Sah  (1988),  Andvig  and  Moene  (1990),  Murphy  et  al.  (1991;  1993),  Acemoglu 
6:173:14699:19:19:90:524:255:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:(1995), and Tirole (1996), who also emphasize the self-reinforcing nature of corruption, implying 
6:174:14797:19:19:90:525:236:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:that  the  more  people  adhere  to  corrupt  activities,  the  more  persistent,  or  stable,  corruption 
6:175:14904:19:19:90:524:217:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:becomes. Nevertheless, including whistle-blowing behaviour in the analysis allows us to consider 
6:176:15001:19:19:90:524:198:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:additional control instruments for the organization to prevent corruption, going beyond the usual 
6:177:15099:19:19:90:524:179:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:variables mentioned in the economic literature (namely, the wage rate, the monitoring system or 
6:178:15195:19:19:90:525:160:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:probability that  an  external  enforcing  agency  will  detect  a  corrupt  individual,  and  penalties  for 
6:179:15305:19:19:90:524:141:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:corrupt  activities). We  attempt  to  answer these  specific  questions in  this  context:  How can the 
6:180:15410:19:19:90:524:122:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:number  of  whistle-blowers be  increased in  an  organization  with  an  initially  small  population  of 
6:181:15517:19:0:90:524:103:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:individuals  who  are  willing  to  monitor  and  report  corrupt  behaviour? What  additional control 
7:182:15666:0:19:90:524:691:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:instruments should be considered in order to motivate and promote whistle-blowing behaviour in 
7:183:15761:19:19:90:525:672:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:an organization? Furthermore, when corruption already exists as a social norm of behaviour in an 
7:184:15858:19:19:90:461:653:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:organization, how can whistle-blowing policies help end the stability of corruption? 
7:185:15942:19:19:108:524:634:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:In  particular, our  work  adds  to  the  analysis three variables  related  to  the  whistle-blowing 
7:186:16044:19:19:90:524:615:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:environment within  organizations:  the  role  of  the  transaction  costs  associated  with  reporting  a 
7:187:16151:19:19:90:524:596:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:corrupt individual, the costs of monitoring, and the economic incentives for  whistle-blowers that 
7:188:16250:19:19:90:524:577:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:effectively  detect  and  sanction  a  corrupt  agent. These  economic  variables  can  all  be  very 
7:189:16352:19:19:90:525:558:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:important  as  additional control  mechanisms  to promote  whistle-blowing  behaviour  and  fight 
7:190:16450:19:19:90:524:539:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:corruption, but their potential effect on the stability of corruption is not so clear. Thus, we wonder 
7:191:16553:19:19:90:524:520:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:(and address herein): What would happen to the stability of corruption if the mechanisms used to 
7:192:16650:19:19:90:522:501:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f8:promote  whistle-blowing also incite corrupt players to “blow the  whistle”?  Will corrupt whistle-
7:193:16748:19:19:90:524:482:117:g_d0_f8:117:g_d0_f7:blowers contribute to break the stability of corruption or they will only add to the stability of this 
7:194:16851:19:19:90:522:463:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:social  norm  of  behaviour?  How  should  economic  instruments aimed at  promoting  whistle-
7:195:16945:19:19:90:524:444:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:blowing behaviour be designed so that they will effectively help break the stability of corruption 
7:196:17044:19:19:90:525:425:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:rather  than contribute  to  its  stability  within  the  organization?  To  the best  of  our knowledge,  no 
7:197:17154:19:18:90:524:406:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:specific  work  deals  with  the  impact that economic  incentives  for  whistle-blowers have  on the 
7:198:17256:18:19:90:524:388:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:stability of corruption. Consequently, this article deals with how the stability of corruption would 
7:199:17357:19:19:90:524:369:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:be  affected  by  having,  or  not  having, these  instruments.  Furthermore,  we  analyse  the  effects  of 
7:200:17466:19:19:90:525:350:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:economic  incentives on the  stability  of  corruption  considering  not  only honest  whistle-blowers 
7:201:17568:19:19:90:346:331:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:within an organization, but also corrupt whistle-blowers.8 
7:202:17626:19:19:126:524:312:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:Second, unlike the earlier literature, our approach to  modelling social norms is based on 
7:203:17717:19:19:90:525:293:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f8:evolutionary game theory (EGT)9,  which does not assume optimising behaviour per se, but does 
7:204:17811:19:19:90:525:274:117:g_d0_f8:117:g_d0_f8:retain  the  idea  that  individuals  adjust  their  behaviour  in  response  to  persistent  differentials  in 
7:205:17923:19:19:90:525:255:117:g_d0_f8:117:g_d0_f7:material  incentives.  Hence,  although  economic  agents  do  pursue  individual  material  payoffs, 
7:206:18024:19:19:90:525:236:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:which, in these models, represent evolutionary success, they are not always in a position to obtain

7:208:18227:19:19:90:524:198:117:g_d0_f8:117:g_d0_f7:behaviour  restrict  the  course  of  action  of  individuals  in  such  a  way  as  to  prevent  them  from 
7:209:18336:19:19:90:525:179:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:adjusting  their  behaviour  towards  the  optimal  strategy  immediately  (it  takes  time  to  change  a 
7:210:18443:19:26:90:340:160:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:social norm followed by the majority of the population).

7:213:18677:14:10:90:93:112:79:g_d0_f7:36:g_d0_f7:policy would be: “to explore the role played by whistle-blower regards or bounties”. 9

8:216:18996:0:19:126:524:691:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:However,  if  this  situation  persists  in  time,  some  individuals  will  start  adopting  the  more 
8:217:19100:19:19:90:525:672:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:efficient strategy and will, therefore, receive a higher payoff than the rest of the population. In the 
8:218:19204:19:19:90:525:653:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:long run, the rest of the population will start imitating this more profitable course of action. Thus, 
8:219:19307:19:19:90:525:634:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:the incumbent social norm will be replaced by a new, more successful strategy that, in time, will 
8:220:19405:19:19:90:524:615:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:be adopted as the new norm of behaviour in the population. This alternative EGT-based approach 
8:221:19500:19:19:90:524:596:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:allows us to analyse the impact of different initial population shares ascribing to whistle-blowing

8:224:19741:19:19:126:525:539:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:Finally,  unlike  preceding  works,  we  model  corruption  by  assuming  three  basic  types  of 
8:225:19839:19:19:90:524:520:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:behaviour within an organization: (i) honest behaviour, which implies that an individual does not 
8:226:19936:19:19:90:524:501:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:receive  any  bribe  from  illicit  activity;  (ii) corrupt  behaviour,  in  which case an  individual  does 
8:227:20045:19:19:90:525:482:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:receive a bribe from a corrupt relationship; and (iii) whistle-blowing (honest-enforcer) behaviour, 
8:228:20145:19:19:90:524:463:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:with  an  agent who not  only  behaves  honestly (i.e.,  does  not  receive  bribes),  but  also  monitors 
8:229:20252:19:19:90:525:444:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:other  people  within  the  organization  and  reports  them  if  they  are  behaving  corruptly.  Assuming 
8:230:20360:19:19:90:524:425:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:that  an  organization  includes  three  different  population  shares  pursuing  these  three  alternative 
8:231:20468:19:18:90:525:406:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:behaviour  types,  we  use  the  concept  of  replicator  dynamics  to  analyse  which  population  share 
8:232:20574:18:19:90:524:388:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:will  become stable within  the  organization  in  the  long  run.  In  other  words,  we  formally  explore 
8:233:20683:19:19:90:525:369:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:the asymptotical stability of the non-corruption equilibrium (all individuals behave honestly) and 
8:234:20781:19:19:90:525:350:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:the corruption equilibrium (all individuals behave corruptly). We also extend this basic model to 
8:235:20878:19:19:90:524:331:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:include cases in which  corrupt individuals also ascribe to whistle-blowing behaviour.  In order to 
8:236:20978:19:19:90:525:312:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:model  this  type  of  behaviour,  we  modify  the  previous  strategic  setting  by  assuming  that  the 
8:237:21084:19:19:90:524:293:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f8:organization encompasses a proportion of honest individuals, another of corrupt whistle-blowing 
8:238:21179:19:19:90:369:274:117:g_d0_f8:117:g_d0_f7:individuals, and another of honest whistle-blowing individuals.

8:241:21449:19:19:90:372:217:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f6:some concluding remarks and related topics for future research.

8:243:21512:13:19:90:154:185:117:g_d0_f6:117:g_d0_f6:2. The Model 
8:244:21524:19:19:126:525:166:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:While  the  model  we  present  in  this  work  is  quite  general  and  can  be  applied  to  several 
8:245:21627:19:19:90:525:147:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:contexts, in order to ease the exposition henceforth we consider the case of a public organization. 
8:246:21727:19:19:90:524:128:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:We assume that there exists an infinitely elastic demand for corrupt services and that individuals 
8:247:21826:19:0:90:525:109:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:or  firms  interested  in  buying  these  services  can  buy  them  at  a  price  of0>!,  the  value  of  the 
9:248:21982:0:19:90:525:691:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:bribe  paid  to  a  public  servant.  Clearly,  for  these  bribes  to  be  paid  by  rational  individuals,  the 
9:249:22096:19:19:90:524:672:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:expected benefits obtained from  corrupt services  must be higher than the expected  costs. In  this 
9:250:22197:19:19:90:524:653:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:contex t, we  can  think  of  corrupt  services  as  the  action,  vote,  or  influence  of  a  person  in  an 
9:251:22308:19:19:90:524:634:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:official  or  public  capacity  in  order  to,  for  instance,  bypass  laws  and  regulations,  obtain 
9:252:22412:19:19:90:524:615:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:government  contracts,  acquire  state-owned  property,  etc.  In  any  case,  the  cost  of  the  bribery 
9:253:22519:19:19:90:525:596:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:should be lower than the costs associated with obtaining the services lawfully; otherwise rational 
9:254:22618:19:19:90:283:577:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:individuals would not buy corrupt services. 
9:255:22661:19:18:126:524:558:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:On the  supply  side,  we  assume  that  there  exist  a  number  of  bureaucrats  that  may  offer 
9:256:22761:18:21:90:524:540:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:corrupt services. Suppose that,  whereas honest bureaucrats earn the  wagew, corrupt bureaucrats 
9:257:22858:21:22:90:524:519:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:earn  the  same  wage w  plus  the  amount  of the  bribery, 0>!.  Now,  let  us  assume  that  the 
9:258:22958:22:19:90:525:497:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:government,  through  an  external  enforcing  agency,  for  example,  can  detect  a  corrupt  public 
9:259:23061:19:20:90:524:478:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:official within a specific governmental organization with probability!. Whenever the bureaucrat 
9:260:23157:20:21:90:525:458:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:is  detected  by  the  government,  she  will  be  fired  and  have  to  go  to  work  in  the  private  sector, 
9:261:23270:21:23:90:525:437:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:where  she  can  get  a  wage00w!.  In  addition,  the  corrupt  bureaucrat  will  also  have  to  pay  a 
9:262:23376:23:21:90:158:414:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:penalty0f!. 
9:263:23387:21:19:126:524:393:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:Clearly, in many real life situations, as those discussed in the introduction, it can be very 
9:264:23481:19:19:90:525:374:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:hard  for  the  government  to  detect  corrupt  government  officials.  In  terms  of  our  model,  we  can 
9:265:23590:19:19:90:525:355:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:argue  that  there  are  typically  a  great  number  of  bureaucrats;  even  more  firms  being  regulated, 
9:266:23699:19:19:90:524:336:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:applying  for  government  contracts,  bidding  on  state-owned  property,  etc.;  and  limited  resources 
9:267:23806:19:19:90:525:317:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:for  monitoring  and  auditing  both  public  officials  and  firms.  But  even  if  the  government  had  a 
9:268:23915:19:19:90:524:298:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:great deal of resources with which to investigate, the important informational advantage of public 
9:269:24014:19:19:90:525:279:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:officials  can  make  it  too  expensive  to  completely  eliminate  corruption  from  the  system.  Indeed, 
9:270:24123:19:20:90:525:260:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:designing an effective control and monitoring system can be both difficult and costly, which may 
9:271:24220:20:20:90:524:240:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:imply  a  very  low !.  Here,  given  these  contexts,  the  role  of  whistle-blowing  can  be  very 
9:272:24321:20:18:90:138:220:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:important. 
9:273:24331:18:19:126:524:202:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:Assume, for instance, that there are some whistle-blowing bureaucrats that monitor others 
9:274:24421:19:19:90:524:183:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:and denounce them to the government if found in an illicit activity, for instance providing corrupt 
9:275:24521:19:20:90:524:164:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:services  to  private  firms.  If  a  whistle-blowing  bureaucrat  can  detect  a  corrupt  public  official 
9:276:24630:20:20:90:524:144:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:within   her   own   organization   with   probability!,   this   probability   being   greater   than   the 
9:277:24739:20:0:90:524:124:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:probability  of  detection  by  an  external  enforcing  agency,  that  is!">,  then  the  expected  gains 
10:278:24892:0:19:90:524:691:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:from  corrupt  activities  decrease  in  comparison  with  the  baseline  scenario  of  no  whistle-blowing 
10:279:25000:19:19:90:231:672:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:bureaucrats in the organization. 
10:280:25032:19:19:126:524:653:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:Nevertheless,  it  is  difficult  for whistle-blowing  behaviour  to  arise  spontaneously.  As  we 
10:281:25132:19:19:90:525:634:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:already  discussed  in  the  introduction,  this  is  because  the  whistle-blowing  strategy  is  a  costly 
10:282:25241:19:20:90:525:615:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:activity.  The  costs  associated  with  whistle-blowing  behaviour  include  monitoring  costs,m0!, 
10:283:25342:20:20:90:525:595:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:and  the  transaction  costs  associated  with  actually  reporting  a  public  official  to  the  government, 
10:284:25453:20:19:109:525:575:143:g_d0_f31:117:g_d0_f7:0!>. If we assume that the whistle-blowing bureaucrats are honest, in the sense that they do not 
10:285:25550:19:19:90:524:556:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:accept bribes from private firms for instance, it is clear that no payoff maximiser  agent will be a 
10:286:25651:19:19:90:524:537:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:whistle-blower,  since  this  activity  will  only  lower  her  payoff  regardless  of  the  whistle-blowing 
10:287:25760:19:20:90:524:518:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:behaviour  of  the  rest.  In  fact,  in  this  case,  the  whistle-blowing  strategy  is  strictly  dominated  by 
10:288:25875:20:21:90:524:498:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:the honest strategy(wwm)!">##, so no honest bureaucrat will have incentives to become a 
10:289:25963:21:19:90:524:477:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:whistle-blower.  This,  in  turn,  implies  that  no  bureaucrat  will  be  deterred  from  corruption  by  the 
10:290:26075:19:20:90:343:458:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:threat of whistle-blowing behaviour from her colleagues.

10:296:26484:19:21:90:524:344:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:government  there  is  a  proportion  of honest  bureaucrats,  another  of corrupt  bureaucrats,  and

15:548:36529:19:19:90:524:620:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f8:that  the  stability  of  the non-corruption equilibrium  crucially  depends  upon  the population  share

16:580:39216:0:19:90:524:691:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:previous  works,  such  as  those  of  Acemoglu  (1995)  and  Tirole  (1996),  in  this  model,  history  is

16:582:39434:19:19:90:525:653:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:group’s  current  behaviour.  Specifically,  from  condition  (8)  we  can  infer  that a  low  initial 
16:583:39538:19:19:90:525:634:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:population  of  whistle-blowers  may  imply  that  the  non-corruption  equilibrium,  in  which  no

16:587:39960:19:19:90:525:558:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:and  very  significant  in  others?  What  factors  determine  these  diverse  norms  of  behaviour  in 
16:588:40064:19:19:90:524:539:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:different organizations and societies? Clearly, to answer these questions, we have to consider the 
16:589:40163:19:19:90:525:520:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:historical  background  in  the  analysis.  What  is  clear,  though,  is  that  the  current  state  of  affairs 
16:590:40277:19:19:90:524:501:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:must  be  necessarily  analysed  considering  related  events  that  occurred  in  the  past  and  that

17:640:42267:19:19:126:525:204:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:From  condition  (i)  in  proposition 2,  it  is  clear  that  the  local  asymptotical  stability  of the

17:642:42479:19:19:90:524:166:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:costs  associated  with  whistle-blowing  are  larger  than  or  equal  to  the  benefits,  the  corruption 
17:643:42587:19:19:90:525:147:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:equilibrium  can  be  very  stable.  Indeed,  if  the  costs  of  monitoring  a  population  of  only  corrupt 
17:644:42698:19:22:90:524:128:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:agents and the transaction costs associated  with actually reporting a corrupt government official,

18:646:42953:0:23:90:525:691:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:behaviour,!", then the condition for corruption stability will

18:648:43103:24:20:90:524:644:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:incentives  for  whistle-blowers,0!=,  this  inequality  will  be  the  only  necessary  and  sufficient 
18:649:43208:20:19:90:266:624:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:condition for local asymptotic stability. 
18:650:43249:19:19:126:525:605:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:From  this  condition,  it  becomes  clear that,  if  the  probability  of  being  detected  by  the 
18:651:43350:19:19:90:525:586:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:government is  rather small, the  corruption equilibrium  will be fairly stable and hard to break. In

18:654:43659:22:23:90:524:524:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:practice, it will be very difficult to stop. In the same way, if the amount of the bribery,!, and the 
18:655:43761:23:23:90:524:501:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:salary  the  government  official  can  get  from  the  private  sector  if  dismissed, 0w,  are  high  in 
18:656:43868:23:20:90:524:478:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:comparison  with  the  salary  paid  by  the  government, w,  and  the  penalty  for  being  caught  in  a 
18:657:43975:20:22:90:403:458:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:corrupt activity,f, the corruption equilibrium will also be very stable. 
18:658:44047:22:19:126:525:436:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:By  contrast,  increased  salaries  for  government  officials  may  break  the  stability  of 
18:659:44142:19:19:90:525:417:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:corruption.  This  argument  dates  back  to  Becker  and  Stigler  (1974),  who  pointed  out  that 
18:660:44243:19:19:90:524:398:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:efficiency  wages  can be used to  control corruption since they increase the cost of dismissal and, 
18:661:44344:19:19:90:524:379:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:therefore,  make  bureaucrats  more  reluctant  to  accept  bribes16.  Nevertheless,  paying  efficiency 
18:662:44449:19:19:90:525:360:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:wages can be very expensive for governments and does not ensure that corruption will be reduced 
18:663:44545:19:19:90:524:341:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:in  all  situations  (see,  for instance,  Mookherjee  and  Png,  1995).  In  addition,  if  the  probability  of 
18:664:44659:19:19:90:525:322:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:being  detected  by  the  government  is  rather  small,  the potential  effect  of  efficiency  wages  on  the 
18:665:44771:19:19:90:511:303:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:stability of corruption is reduced, since the expected cost of dismissal also becomes very small. 
18:666:44868:19:19:126:525:284:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:Likewise,  an  increase  in  the  penalty  for  corrupt  public  officials  can  also  break  the 
18:667:44966:19:19:90:525:265:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:stability of corruption. An interesting point to notice here is that if legal punishments for corrupt 
18:668:45068:19:19:90:524:246:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:officials  are  high  enough,  then  efficiency  wages  are  not needed  to  reduce  corrupt  behaviour  and 
18:669:45177:19:20:90:525:227:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:break its stability as a norm of behaviour. Indeed, assuming that the penalty for corrupt behaviour 
18:670:45277:20:23:90:524:207:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:is  equal  to  the  bribe, f!=,  and  that  the  government  only  pays  reservation  wages, 0ww=, 
18:671:45376:23:27:90:525:184:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:corruption will never be stable as long as the probability of being detected by the government is 
18:672:45474:27:0:90:252:157:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:greater than or equal to 50%, that is 
18:673:45512:0:17:273:279:164:144:g_d0_f305:144:g_d0_f305:1
18:674:45513:17:0:273:279:147:144:g_d0_f305:144:g_d0_f305:2
18:675:45514:0:54:252:524:157:147:g_d0_f306:117:g_d0_f7:!". Here again, if the ability of the government to detect 
18:676:45573:54:8:90:237:103:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:                                                
18:677:45620:8:0:90:463:95:36:g_d0_f7:79:g_d0_f7:16 For favourable empirical evidence of this point see, for instance, van Rijckeghem and Weder (2001). 
19:678:45769:0:19:90:524:691:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:corrupt  officials  is  reduced,  the  impact  of  penalties  and  legal  punishments  in  general  in  the 
19:679:45877:19:19:90:316:672:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:stability of corruption will be quite limited as well. 
19:680:45931:19:19:126:525:653:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:Again,  as  the  design  of  a  successful  control  and  monitoring  mechanism  can  be  both 
19:681:46026:19:20:90:524:634:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:difficult  and  costly,  and  in  practice  may  imply  a  very  low !,  this  result  helps  explain  why 
19:682:46133:20:19:90:525:614:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:corruption, once it has become a common practice in a government, is very hard to stop and can 
19:683:46228:19:19:90:202:595:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:even last for many years. 
19:684:46253:19:22:126:525:576:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:However,  key  to  this  result  was  the  assumption  of  an  unfavourable  environment  for 
19:685:46347:22:23:90:525:554:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:whistle-blowing  behaviour,  namely()()m10!"#$$%.  What  happens  if  this  is  not  the  case? 
19:686:46443:23:19:90:524:531:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:Condition (ii) in proposition 2 shows that the corruption equilibrium will be local asymptotically 
19:687:46542:19:22:90:525:512:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:stable  whenever  the  expected  net  benefits  from  behaving  corruptly  in  a population  that  consists 
19:688:46650:22:24:90:525:490:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:only  of  corrupt  players,  i.e. ()()()()01wwf!"!#++#,  are  greater  than  the  expected  net 
19:689:46746:24:21:90:524:466:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:benefits from behaving honestly and performing whistle-blowing activities, i.e. the government’s

19:691:46867:24:19:126:525:421:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:This  condition  for  the  stability  of  corruption  brings  several  new   elements  to  the 
19:692:46962:19:20:90:524:402:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:discussion.  First,  there  are  additional control  instruments  for  the  government  to  consider  apart 
19:693:47070:20:22:90:525:382:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:from the wage rate (w),monitoring system (!), and penalty (f) discussed above. These include 
19:694:47163:22:20:90:524:360:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:the transaction costs associated with reporting a corrupt public official to the government, 0!>, 
19:695:47261:20:20:90:524:340:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:monitoring costs, m0!, and incentives for whistle-blowers that effectively detect and sanction a 
19:696:47358:20:20:90:189:320:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:corrupt agent, 0!". 
19:697:47377:20:19:126:524:300:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:These  alternative control  instruments  for  the  government  imply  new  challenges  in  terms 
19:698:47474:19:19:90:525:281:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:of  policy. Here,  for  instance,  it  could  be  argued  that  all  the  countries  that  have  formally 
19:699:47580:19:19:90:522:262:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:established legal  protection  for  whistle-blowers  have  reduced  the  transaction  costs  for  whistle-
19:700:47686:19:19:90:524:243:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f8:blowers to report corruption, which implies a lower !. Similarly, more government transparency 
19:701:47781:19:19:90:524:224:117:g_d0_f8:117:g_d0_f7:and  freedom  of  information  legislation  points  to  reduced  monitoring  costs,  which  imply  a  lower 
19:702:47889:19:20:91:525:205:143:g_d0_f329:117:g_d0_f7:m. Nevertheless, what is typically not seen as in policies against the establishment of corruption 
19:703:47988:20:19:90:524:185:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:as a norm of behaviour in government are incentives for whistle-blowing behaviour. As shown in 
19:704:48083:19:19:90:524:166:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:our  model,  this  is  clearly  beyond  legal  protection  for  whistle-blowers,  which  only  reduces  the 
19:705:48191:19:19:90:524:147:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:transaction costs for whistle-blowers to report corruption, indicating that whistle-blowing is not a 
19:706:48292:19:19:90:524:128:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:bad  thing  but,  on  the  contrary,  something to  reward.  Hence,  the  first  thing  to  consider  is  the 
19:707:48402:19:0:90:524:109:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:common  reaction  to  whistle-blowing.  Whereas  some  people  see  whistle-blowers  as  selfless 
20:708:48547:0:19:90:525:691:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:martyrs  for  public  interest  and  organizational  accountability,  others  view  them  as  “snitches”, 
20:709:48653:19:19:90:525:672:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:solely  pursuing  personal  glory  and  fame.  Incentives  to  whistle-blowing  behaviour  should  start 
20:710:48758:19:19:90:525:653:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:with  the  government’s  public  recognition  that  reporting  corruption  is  positive  and  should  be 
20:711:48863:19:19:90:524:634:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:encouraged at all levels. This message should be delivered not only to the people working within 
20:712:48960:19:19:90:525:615:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:government institutions but also to the public in general. In addition to this, economic incentives 
20:713:49060:19:19:90:525:596:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:should  also  play  a  part  in  encouraging  whistle-blowing  behaviour.17  However,  this  is  a  complex 
20:714:49168:19:19:90:525:577:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:economic policy issue that, as we will see in the next section, can be difficult to design and apply, 
20:715:49270:19:19:90:514:558:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:and if poorly implemented can contribute to the stability of corruption instead of its eradication. 
20:716:49369:19:19:126:524:539:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:Second, from condition (ii) in proposition 2, we can also infer that if a whistle-blower can 
20:717:49462:19:19:90:524:520:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:detect  a  corrupt  public  official  with  a  probability  greater  than  that  of  detection  by  an  external 
20:718:49575:19:20:90:524:501:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:agency from the government, that is!">, then the effect of whistle-blowing on the stability of 
20:719:49670:20:19:90:524:481:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:corruption  could  be  quite  significant,  especially  when  considering  that  the  more  traditional 
20:720:49774:19:19:90:525:462:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:control  instruments  available  to  governments  for  fighting  corruption  are  extremely  dependent  of 
20:721:49881:19:19:90:524:443:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:the ability of the government to detect corrupt officials. Clearly, a member inside the organization 
20:722:49982:19:19:90:524:424:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:is more likely to spot corruption, and spot it at an earlier stage, than an external enforcing agency 
20:723:50084:19:19:90:188:405:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:from the government. 
20:724:50104:19:19:126:525:386:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:Third,  whistle-blowing  can  certainly  be  cheaper  than  designing  a  successful  control  and 
20:725:50203:19:19:90:524:367:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:monitoring  mechanism  or  paying  efficiency  wages.  In  fact,  if,  for  instance,  the  fines  charged  to 
20:726:50314:19:19:90:524:348:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:corrupt  public  officials  are  paid  as  incentives  to  the  whistle-blowers  that  detect  them,  that  is 
20:727:50425:19:22:114:524:329:144:g_d0_f332:117:g_d0_f7:f!=,  then  a  monitoring  system  based  on  whistle-blowing  can  be  both  very  effective  and  low 
20:728:50529:22:19:90:200:307:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:cost for the government. 
20:729:50553:19:19:126:524:288:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:Finally,  as  typically  recognised  in  the  literature,  sometimes  a “big  push”  is  required  in 
20:730:50654:19:19:90:525:269:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:order  to  reduce  the  level  of  corruption  in  societies  where  it  is  epidemic  (for  details  and  further 
20:731:50769:19:19:90:524:250:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:references  see,  for  instance,  Aidt,  2003).  In  the  context  of  our  model,  this  “big  push”  needed  to 
20:732:50883:19:19:90:524:231:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:break  the  stability  of  corruption  can  come  from  encouraging  whistle-blowing  behaviour  in 
20:733:50983:19:19:90:525:212:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:government  institutions.  Indeed,  from  condition  (ii)  in  proposition  2,  it  follows  that,  given 
20:734:51089:19:21:90:525:193:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:sufficiently  large  expected  benefits  from  effectively  reporting  a  corrupt  agent,  that  is,  the  net

25:994:58091:0:19:126:524:691:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:From  proposition  3,  it  is  clear  that  there  are  cases in  which  the governmental  control 
25:995:58190:19:19:90:524:672:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:instruments  aimed  at  motivating  whistle-blowing  behaviour  can  be  counter-productive,  making 
25:996:58291:19:19:90:525:653:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:corruption  more  stable  within  an  organization.  In  particular,  a  high  level  of  economic  incentives 
25:997:58402:19:19:90:524:634:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:for  whistle-blowers  can  increasingly  induce  corrupt  agents  to  become  what  we  have  called 
25:998:58503:19:19:90:524:615:117:g_d0_f8:117:g_d0_f7:corrupt whistle-blowers;  this,  in  turn,  can  make  honest  behaviour  and  honest whistle-blowing 
25:999:58603:19:19:90:264:596:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:behaviour less economically attractive. 
25:1000:58642:19:19:126:524:577:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f8:According  to  proposition  3, in  order  to  know  in  what  contexts economic  incentives  for

25:1002:58841:19:19:90:524:539:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:organization,  it  is vital to  understand the  nature  of  monitoring  costs.  In particular,  in  contexts in 
25:1003:58953:19:19:90:524:520:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:which marginal monitoring costs are a diminishing function of the corrupt bureaucrat population, 
25:1004:59050:19:19:90:524:501:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:economic incentives for whistle-blowers can make corrupt behaviour less economically attractive 
25:1005:59146:19:19:90:525:482:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:and,  therefore,  the  corruption  equilibrium  becomes  less  stable  in  the  organization.  By  contrast, 
25:1006:59255:19:19:90:524:463:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:whenever marginal  monitoring  costs  are  an  increasing  function  of  the  corrupt  bureaucrat 
25:1007:59353:19:19:90:524:444:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:population, economic incentives for  whistle-blowers can make  corrupt behaviour more attractive 
25:1008:59450:19:19:90:525:425:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:in  economic  terms  and,  therefore, the  corruption  equilibrium  in  the  organization  becomes  more 
25:1009:59554:19:18:90:524:406:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:stable.   Consequently,   a   policy   recommendation   in   order   to   adequately   design   economic 
25:1010:59659:18:19:90:524:388:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:incentives  for  whistle-blowers  would  be  to  investigate monitoring  costs  in  different  settings  in 
25:1011:59767:19:19:90:345:369:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:detail. Clearly, this is a matter to be resolved empirically.

25:1013:59828:19:19:90:203:331:117:g_d0_f6:117:g_d0_f6:5. Concluding Remarks 
25:1014:59849:19:19:108:525:312:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:This paper developed a simple evolutionary game theoretic framework to investigate the role 
25:1015:59941:19:19:90:524:293:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:and potential impact of whistle-blowing on the persistence of corruption in organizations. We can 
25:1016:60039:19:19:90:354:274:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:draw several conclusions based on the results found herein. 
25:1017:60098:19:19:108:525:255:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:First, it  is  difficult for  whistle-blowing  behaviour  to  arise  spontaneously  in  practice because 
25:1018:60203:19:19:90:522:236:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:this strategy is a costly activity and typically involves no economic rewards. The costs of whistle-
25:1019:60303:19:19:90:524:217:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:blowing include  the  monitoring  and  transaction  costs associated  with  actually  reporting  a  public 
25:1020:60410:19:19:90:524:198:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:official to the government. If  we assume that the  whistle-blowing bureaucrats are honest (do not 
25:1021:60509:19:19:90:524:179:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:accept  bribes),  it  is  clear  that  no  payoff  maximiser  agent  will  be  a  whistle-blower,  since  this 
25:1022:60620:19:19:90:525:160:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f8:activity will only lower her payoff regardless of the whistle-blowing behaviour of the others. This 
25:1023:60720:19:19:90:524:141:117:g_d0_f8:117:g_d0_f8:implies  that,  in  order  to  study  this  phenomenon,  a  non-optimising  framework  is  required. Thus, 
25:1024:60827:19:19:90:525:122:117:g_d0_f8:117:g_d0_f8:we modelled  corruption  as  a  social  norm  of  behaviour  using  an  evolutionary  game  theoretic 
25:1025:60929:19:0:90:143:103:117:g_d0_f8:117:g_d0_f8:framework. 
26:1026:60986:0:19:108:525:691:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:Second,   we model  corruption by  assuming  three   basic  types  of  behaviour   within  an 
26:1027:61080:19:19:90:524:672:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:organization:  (i)  honest  behaviour;  (ii)  corrupt  behaviour;  and  (iii)  honest whistle-blowing 
26:1028:61181:19:19:90:524:653:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:behaviour.  From  this  analysis,  we  conclude  that  the non-corruption  equilibrium will  be  local 
26:1029:61284:19:19:90:525:634:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:asymptotically stable whenever the expected net benefits from behaving corruptly in a population 
26:1030:61381:19:19:90:524:615:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:that consists only of honest and whistle-blowing agents are lower than the benefits from behaving 
26:1031:61479:19:19:90:524:596:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:honestly,  i.e.,  the  government’s  salary.  It  should  be  noted  that,  in  this  case,  the  corrupt  player 
26:1032:61593:19:19:90:525:577:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:confronts  two  expected  costs:  the  expected  costs  of  being  detected  by  an  external  enforcing 
26:1033:61698:19:19:90:525:558:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:governmental agency and the expected costs of being detected and reported to the government by 
26:1034:61793:19:19:90:524:539:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:a  whistle-blower  from  within  the  organization. From  this  latter  type  of  cost,  typically  absent  in 
26:1035:61904:19:19:90:522:520:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:the  traditional  economic  literature  on  corruption, makes it clear  that  the  stability  of  the non-
26:1036:62010:19:19:90:524:501:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f8:corruption equilibrium  crucially  depends  upon  the initial  population  share  ascribing  to  the 
26:1037:62111:19:19:90:425:482:117:g_d0_f8:117:g_d0_f7:whistle-blowing strategy, which allows us to infer some additional remarks. 
26:1038:62186:19:19:108:525:463:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:Government  organisations  with  a  large  initial  population  of  honest  bureaucrats  that  not  only 
26:1039:62291:19:19:90:524:444:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:do  not  accept  bribes  but  that are also willing  to  monitor  and  report  corrupt  behaviour  ensure 
26:1040:62397:19:19:90:524:425:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:higher  expected  costs  for  corrupt  agents  than  a  baseline  case  in  which  whistle-blowing  is  not  a 
26:1041:62508:19:18:90:525:406:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:common  practice.  In  this  context,  even  if  the  probability  of  being  detected  by  an  external 
26:1042:62613:18:19:90:524:388:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:enforcing governmental agency and, therefore, the associated expected costs are rather small, the 
26:1043:62711:19:19:90:524:369:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:non-corruption  equilibrium  can  still  be local  asymptotically  stable  due  to  the expected  costs 
26:1044:62814:19:19:90:298:350:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:inflicted on corrupt agents by whistle-blowers. 
26:1045:62861:19:19:108:525:331:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:Our  results  also indicate  the  relevance  of  history  and  initial  conditions  when explaining  the 
26:1046:62966:19:19:90:524:312:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:stability of the corruption or non-corruption equilibria. We conclude that a low initial population 
26:1047:63066:19:19:90:524:293:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:of whistle-blowers may imply that the non-corruption equilibrium, in which no corrupt agents are 
26:1048:63163:19:19:90:524:274:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:present in the population, may never be stable in the future in a specific organization. Clearly, in 
26:1049:63264:19:19:90:524:255:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:order to determine the causes of a low initial population of whistle-blowers, we have to consider 
26:1050:63362:19:19:90:525:236:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:the  historical  background  in  the  analysis.  In  other  words,  the  current  state  of  affairs  must  be 
26:1051:63472:19:19:90:525:217:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:necessarily analysed considering related events that occurred in the past and somehow determine 
26:1052:63568:19:19:90:525:198:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:the  present  situation.  Here,  initial  conditions  are  crucial  and  even  small  differences  may  imply 
26:1053:63678:19:19:90:211:179:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:widely differing outcomes. 
26:1054:63704:19:19:108:522:160:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:As the empirical evidence on whistle-blowing typically points out, in the real world, whistle-
26:1055:63798:19:19:90:524:141:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:blowing  behaviour within  organizations is  the  exception  rather  than  the  rule.  This  is  consistent 
26:1056:63906:19:19:90:524:122:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:with low populations of whistle-blowers, which may help explain why it is so difficult for public 
26:1057:64004:19:0:90:525:103:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:organizations to avoid corrupt agents in the population and how corrupt activities can go on for a 
27:1058:64150:0:19:90:525:691:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:long  time  without  being  detected  or  reported  by  public  officials  from  inside  the  organization. 
27:1059:64258:19:19:90:525:672:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:Consequently,  we  also  study  different control  instruments that governments  could  implement to 
27:1060:64358:19:19:90:395:653:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:motivate and promote whistle-blowing behaviour in an organization. 
27:1061:64424:19:19:108:525:634:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f8:In  particular,  we  infer  from  our  model  that  the  local  asymptotical  stability  of  the corruption 
27:1062:64532:19:19:90:524:615:117:g_d0_f8:117:g_d0_f7:equilibrium  is  contingent  on  the  environment  for  whistle-blowing  behaviour.  If  the  costs 
27:1063:64632:19:19:90:524:596:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:associated with whistle-blowing are greater than or equal to the associated benefits, the corruption 
27:1064:64733:19:19:90:524:577:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:equilibrium  can  become  very  stable.  Indeed,  if  the  costs  of  monitoring  a  population  of  only 
27:1065:64839:19:19:90:525:558:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:corrupt  agents  and  the  transaction  costs  associated  with  actually  reporting  a  corrupt  government 
27:1066:64948:19:19:90:525:539:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:official  are  high  in  comparison  with  the  expected  benefits  of  whistle-blowing  behaviour,  then 
27:1067:65054:19:19:90:524:520:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:corruption  can  be  very  hard  to  break.  This  can  be  especially  so  in  the  total  absence  of  any 
27:1068:65163:19:19:90:524:501:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:incentives  to  whistle-blowers  and  whenever  the  probability  of  being  detected  by  an  external 
27:1069:65267:19:19:90:236:482:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:enforcing agency is rather small. 
27:1070:65300:19:19:108:525:463:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:By  contrast,  if  the  environment  for  whistle-blowing  behaviour  is  rather  favourable,  then  the 
27:1071:65405:19:19:90:525:444:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:corruption  equilibrium  will  only  be  local  asymptotically  stable  whenever  the  expected  net 
27:1072:65506:19:19:90:524:425:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:benefits of behaving  corruptly  in  a  population  that  consists  only  of  corrupt  players  are  greater 
27:1073:65615:19:18:90:525:406:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:than  the  expected  net  benefits of behaving  honestly  and  performing  whistle-blowing  activities. 
27:1074:65719:18:19:90:525:388:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:This  condition  for  the  stability  of  corruption  brings  several  new  elements  to  the  discussion. 
27:1075:65826:19:19:90:525:369:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:Additional  control  instruments  for  the  government  to  consider  apart  from  the  wage  rate,  the 
27:1076:65931:19:19:90:524:350:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:monitoring  system, and  the  penalty include  the  transaction  costs  associated  with  reporting  a

27:1078:66141:19:19:90:524:312:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:that  effectively  detect  and  sanction  corrupt  agents.  Clearly,  these  alternative  control  instruments 
27:1079:66252:19:19:90:525:293:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:for the government imply new challenges in terms of policy, some of which were addressed in the 
27:1080:66348:19:19:90:119:274:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:paper. 
27:1081:66354:19:19:108:525:255:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:If the probability that a whistle-blower will detect a corrupt public official is greater than the 
27:1082:66453:19:19:90:522:236:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:probability  of  detection  by  an  external  agency  from  the  government,  then  the  effect  of  whistle-
27:1083:66562:19:19:90:524:217:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:blowing  on  the  stability  of  corruption  can  be  quite  significant.  This  is  especially true when 
27:1084:66668:19:19:90:524:198:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:considering  that  the  more  traditional control  instruments  available  to  governments  for  fighting 
27:1085:66774:19:19:90:525:179:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:corruption  are  extremely  dependent  on  the  ability  of  the  government  to  detect  corrupt  officials. 
27:1086:66884:19:19:90:524:160:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:Clearly,  an inside member of the organization is more likely to spot corruption, and spot it at an 
27:1087:66984:19:19:90:399:141:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:earlier stage, than an external enforcing agency from the government. 
27:1088:67053:19:19:126:524:122:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:All  these  economic  variables  can be  very  important for  the  government  to  consider as 
27:1089:67148:19:0:90:524:103:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:additional control mechanisms to promote  whistle-blowing behaviour.  Nonetheless, the potential 
28:1090:67292:0:19:90:525:691:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:effect of these instruments on the stability of corruption is not so clear. In particular,  we studied 
28:1091:67394:19:19:90:524:672:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:the  stability  of  corruption when the  economic  mechanisms  used  to  promote  whistle-blowing 
28:1092:67492:19:19:90:524:653:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:behaviour  in  an  organization  also encourage corrupt  players  to  “blow  the  whistle”.  In  order  to 
28:1093:67599:19:19:90:524:634:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:model  this  effect,  we  deviated  from  the  basic set-up and  assumed  the  following  types  of 
28:1094:67699:19:19:90:525:615:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:behaviour  within  an  organization:  (i)  honest  behaviour;  (ii)  corrupt whistle-blowing  behaviour; 
28:1095:67802:19:19:90:525:596:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:and (iii) honest whistle-blowing behaviour. This analysis showed that there are cases in which the 
28:1096:67900:19:19:90:522:577:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:government’s control instruments aimed at motivating whistle-blowing behaviour can be counter-
28:1097:67994:19:19:90:524:558:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:productive,  making  corruption  more  stable  within  an  organization.  Specifically,  a  high  level  of 
28:1098:68102:19:19:90:524:539:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:economic  incentives  for  whistle-blowers  can  increasingly  induce  corrupt  agents  to  become  what 
28:1099:68207:19:19:90:525:520:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:we  have  called corrupt whistle-blowers,  which,  in  turn,  can  make  honest  behaviour  and  honest 
28:1100:68309:19:19:90:338:501:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:whistle-blowing behaviour less economically attractive. 
28:1101:68364:19:19:126:525:482:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:Finally,  we  also  show  that,  in  order  to  know  in  what  contexts  economic  incentives  for 
28:1102:68464:19:19:90:524:463:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:whistle-blowers  can  contribute  more  effectively  to  make  corruption  less  stable  within  an 
28:1103:68564:19:19:90:524:444:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:organization, it is crucial to understand the nature of monitoring costs. Thus, in contexts in which 
28:1104:68665:19:19:90:525:425:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:marginal  monitoring  costs  are  a  diminishing  function  of  the  corrupt  bureaucrat  population, 
28:1105:68767:19:18:90:525:406:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:economic incentives for whistle-blowers can make corrupt behaviour less economically attractive 
28:1106:68863:18:19:90:525:388:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:and,  therefore,  the  corruption  equilibrium  becomes  less  stable  in  the  organization.  By  contrast, 
28:1107:68972:19:19:90:525:369:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:whenever  marginal  monitoring  costs  are  an  increasing  function  of  the  corrupt  bureaucrat 
28:1108:69071:19:19:90:524:350:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:population, economic incentives for  whistle-blowers can make corrupt behaviour more attractive 
28:1109:69167:19:19:90:524:331:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:in   economic   terms   and,   therefore, make the   corruption   equilibrium more   stable in   the 
28:1110:69267:19:19:90:525:312:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:organization.  Consequently,  a  policy  recommendation  in  order  to  adequately  design  economic 
28:1111:69368:19:19:90:524:293:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:incentives  for  whistle-blowers  would  be  to  investigate  in  detail  monitoring  costs  in  different 
28:1112:69475:19:19:90:352:274:117:g_d0_f7:117:g_d0_f7:settings. This is clearly a matter to be resolved empirically.
