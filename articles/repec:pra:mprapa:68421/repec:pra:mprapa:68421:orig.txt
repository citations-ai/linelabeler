2:21:1018:26:20:85:539:510:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:In this study we examine the network topology of UK regional property prices using a dynamic
2:22:1110:20:21:85:539:490:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:measure  of  connectedness  developed  by  Diebold  and  Yilmaz  (2014)  over  the  period  1973Q4-
2:23:1209:21:20:85:539:469:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:2014Q4.  Our findings suggest that the transmission of inter-regional property returns shocks is
2:24:1305:20:20:85:539:449:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:an important source of regional property return fluctuations in the UK. The UK regions of South
2:25:1400:20:21:85:539:429:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:West, Outer South East, East Midlands and Northern Ireland seem to be the dominant trans-
2:26:1489:21:20:85:539:408:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:mitters of property returns shocks throughout our sample period.  Moreover, the results indicate
2:27:1585:20:20:85:539:388:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:that regional housing markets in the UK are highly interconnected and extreme-economic-event
2:28:1677:20:21:85:539:368:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:dependent.  In addition, the dynamic framework of our analysis provides further insights regard-
2:29:1773:21:20:85:539:347:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:ing the ripple effect, while, emphasis is also placed on the fact that London may also act as a net
2:30:1872:20:20:85:539:327:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:recipient of shocks from other regions.  Findings are important for policy makers purporting to
2:31:1967:20:21:85:539:307:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:alleviate regional imbalances and achieve balanced growth, as well as, investors who formulate
2:32:2061:21:19:85:488:286:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:portfolio diversification strategies.  Our results exhibit robustness to a series of tests.

3:40:2605:0:28:85:170:712:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:1. Introduction
3:41:2620:28:20:85:539:684:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:The importance of housing market developments for the aggregate economy has been clearly
3:42:2708:20:21:85:539:664:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:emphasized in recent decades, as it has become rather apparent that the financialisation of said
3:43:2804:21:20:85:539:643:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:market has rendered housing prices a key component of the investigation of the well-being of
3:44:2896:20:20:85:539:623:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:an  economy.   In  this  respect,  there  has  been  a  substantial  academic  endeavour  to  investigate
3:45:3001:20:21:85:539:603:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the links between housing prices and other macroeconomic and financial variables, as well as,
3:46:3094:21:20:85:539:582:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:to effectively identify the transmission mechanisms through which these links may actually be
3:47:3187:20:20:85:539:562:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:realised  (see,  inter  alia,  Mishkin,  2007;  Reinhart  and  Rogoff,  2008;  Iacoviello  and  Neri,  2010;
3:48:3295:20:21:85:539:542:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Allen  and  Carletti,  2011;  Attanasio  et  al.,  2011;  Bouchouicha  and  Ftiti,  2012;  Ferrero,  2015;
3:49:3401:21:20:85:538:521:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f13:Miles, 2015).  At the same time, researchers have also concentrated on the so calledripple effect
3:50:3498:20:20:85:539:501:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:which basically refers to the transmission of shocks across regional housing markets (see, among
3:51:3594:20:21:85:539:481:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:others, Vansteenkiste and Hiebert, 2011; Gupta and Miller, 2012; Apergis and Payne, 2012; Cook
3:52:3688:21:20:85:539:460:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:and Watson, 2015; Gupta et al., 2015; Liao et al., 2015).  What is more, substantial variations in
3:53:3786:20:20:85:539:440:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:housing prices have attracted the attention of many researchers and thus, the housing markets of
3:54:3882:20:21:85:539:420:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:countries such as the UK or the US - which have been through periods of large peaks and troughs
3:55:3977:21:20:85:539:399:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:in recent years   have become the focal point of many studies investigating either transmission
3:56:4072:20:20:85:538:379:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:mechanisms or the ripple effectper se.  The aim of this study is to investigate the behaviour of
3:57:4168:20:21:85:539:359:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:regional prices and to contribute to the discussion about the ripple effect within the UK housing
3:58:4265:21:20:85:121:338:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:market.
3:59:4272:20:20:101:538:318:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Generalisations  at  the  national  level,  although  indicative  of  some  trend  pertaining  to  the
3:60:4374:20:21:85:539:298:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:specific issue under investigation, typically fail to shed light to the particular dynamics which
3:61:4471:21:20:85:538:277:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:fashion developments within differentspatial  unitsof the same country.  Different regions ex-
3:62:4565:20:20:85:539:257:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:hibit different characteristics (e.g.  in terms of current production profile, human capital skills,
3:63:4665:20:21:85:539:237:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:infrastructure) and might therefore react differently to common national policies or international
3:64:4763:21:20:85:539:216:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:shocks.  It would therefore be very suitable to investigate the degree of regional interdependence;
3:65:4862:20:20:85:539:196:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:that is, the extent to which developments in one region might have an impact on developments
3:66:4954:20:21:85:282:176:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:in other regions within the same country.
3:67:4995:21:20:101:538:155:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:With respect to the UK housing market dynamics, most papers analyse short-run and long-
3:68:5082:20:20:85:539:135:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:run relationships and dynamics between regional housing prices without giving emphasis to the
3:69:5175:20:21:85:539:115:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:transmission of inter-regional property returns shocks as an important source of regional property
3:70:5273:21:20:85:539:94:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:return fluctuations.  This study extends the existing literature on the dynamic relationships of
3:71:5369:20:0:85:539:74:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:housing  prices  by  employing  the  connectedness  approach  introduced  by  Diebold  and  Yilmaz
4:72:5468:0:20:85:539:712:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:(2014).  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to employ this methodology for the
4:73:5565:20:21:85:539:692:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:examination of the dynamics of the UK property prices.  We contribute to the recent literature
4:74:5659:21:20:85:539:671:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:pertaining  to  dynamic  relationships  by  investigating  the  importance  of  the  connectedness  of
4:75:5761:20:20:85:539:651:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:shocks.   More  specifically,  our  paper  allows  for  the  investigation  of  the  interdependencies  of
4:76:5867:20:21:85:539:631:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:UK regional property prices.  In order to attain a better understanding of the implications of
4:77:5961:21:20:85:539:610:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:UK housing prices movements over the last 40 years for policy makers in the housing market,
4:78:6052:20:20:85:539:590:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:it is necessary to identify the magnitude of spillover effects.  In this respect,  we focus on the
4:79:6150:20:21:85:539:570:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:identification of those key UK regions which provide leadership in the price discovery process.  In
4:80:6249:21:20:85:539:549:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the presence of spillover effects among regions, it would be rather useful to establish a mechanism
4:81:6348:20:20:85:417:529:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:in order to show thedominanttransmitter of property return shocks.
4:82:6414:20:21:101:538:509:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:To this end, we consider quarterly data of UK housing prices for the period 1973Q4-2014Q4.
4:83:6504:21:20:85:539:488:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:In accordance with recent and relevant academic papers (see, for example, Schindler, 2014), we
4:84:6598:20:20:85:539:468:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:consider data provided by the Nationwide Building Society (NBS) (see, www.nationwide.co.uk).
4:85:6690:20:21:85:539:448:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:NBS represent one of the largest mortgage providers in the UK and they provide the largest
4:86:6780:21:20:85:539:427:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:housing prices database using a widely accepted method of a house price index.  NBS’s indices
4:87:6873:20:20:85:539:407:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:are mix-adjusted so that they may track a representative housing price over time more effectively
4:88:6970:20:21:85:539:387:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:compared to just a simple average price.  NBS offers detailed information about UK properties
4:89:7063:21:20:85:400:366:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:including location, types of properties, as well as, types of buyers.
4:90:7132:20:20:101:538:346:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Our results indicate that regional UK housing markets are highly interconnected and extreme-
4:91:7224:20:21:85:539:326:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:economic-event dependent.  Moreover, the UK regions of South West, Outer South East, East
4:92:7313:21:20:85:539:305:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Midlands and Northern Ireland appear to be dominant transmitters of property returns shocks
4:93:7404:20:20:85:539:285:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:during our sample period.  Our findings have obvious policy implications.  For example, in the
4:94:7498:20:20:85:538:265:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:light of theGreat Recessionand its world-wide effects, an international financial shock initially
4:95:7595:20:21:85:539:245:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:felt in London (i.e.  one of the world’s leading financial centres) will eventually be diffused to
4:96:7693:21:20:85:539:224:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:other  regions  within  the  UK.  Authorities,  aware  of  the  linkages  among  the  different  regions
4:97:7797:20:20:85:539:204:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:might decide to prioritise their interventions in order to secure a more efficient absorption of the
4:98:7897:20:21:85:114:184:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:shock.
4:99:7903:21:20:101:538:163:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:As  far  as  the  ripple  effect  is  concerned,  in  accordance  with  relevant  literature  we  provide
4:100:8008:20:20:85:539:143:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:evidence  to  support  the  argument  that  London  is  a  net  transmitter  of  shocks  to  various  UK
4:101:8112:20:21:85:539:123:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:regions and this is clearly evident when it comes to links with neighbouring regions; however,
4:102:8206:21:20:85:539:102:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the regions which receive shocks from London vary depending on the period under investigation.
4:103:8300:20:0:85:539:82:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:What is more, we show that London itself may also receive shocks from other UK regions. Finally,
5:104:8397:0:20:85:539:712:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:we confirm evidence found in relevant literature that the UK housing market is not fragmented
5:105:8490:20:21:85:409:692:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:and that interregional dependencies affect all UK regions over time.
5:106:8558:21:20:101:538:671:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.  Section 2 presents the relevant literature.
5:107:8655:20:20:85:539:651:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Section 3 discusses the application of the connectedness approach and describes the data used.
5:108:8749:20:21:85:539:631:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Section  4  presents  the  empirical  findings  and  purports  to  explore  their  relevant  implications.
5:109:8855:21:37:85:428:610:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Finally, Section 5 summarises the main results and concludes the study.

5:111:8953:29:23:85:337:544:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f13:2.1.  Basic characteristics of the UK Housing market
5:112:9005:23:20:101:538:521:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Although a thorough investigation of the literature falls beyond the scope of this study, it
5:113:9097:20:20:85:539:501:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:is worth dwelling upon specific arguments, that have been developed and put forward over the

5:115:9284:21:20:85:539:460:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:market.  According to Tse  et al.  (2014),  the dynamics  of the UK housing  market are  rather
5:116:9379:20:20:85:539:440:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:complex and thus deserve in-depth examination.  We therefore begin our review of the relevant
5:117:9472:20:21:85:539:420:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:literature with Mishkin (2007) who provides a detailed analysis regarding the linkages between
5:118:9566:21:20:85:539:399:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:monetary policy and the housing market which appear to be very important for any economy.
5:119:9655:20:20:85:538:379:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:In his work, ensuing linkages can be attributed to eitherdirecteffects (i.e.  interest rate effects,
5:120:9755:20:21:85:539:359:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f13:expectations  about  future  housing  prices  fluctuations,  as  well  as,  housing  supply)  orindirect
5:121:9859:21:20:85:539:338:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:effects (i.e.  wealth and credit effects).  As far as the UK economy is concerned, there is clear
5:122:9956:20:20:85:539:318:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:evidence of both.  In particular, during the period 1997-2007 housing prices in the UK increased
5:123:10052:20:21:85:539:298:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:by 200% on average and actually,  at a pace greater than the pace of inflation of that period
5:124:10145:21:20:85:539:277:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:(see,  among  others,  Bone  and  O’Reilly,  2010;  ONS,  2013).   Cobham  (2012)  investigating  the
5:125:10246:20:20:85:539:257:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:response  of  the  Monetary  Policy  Committee  (MPC)  of  the  Bank  of  England  (BoE)  to  those
5:126:10345:20:21:85:539:237:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:unprecedented high levels, directs our attention to a list of potential factors which according to
5:127:10443:21:20:85:539:216:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the MPC contributed to attaining those levels in the first place.  These factors include (i) price
5:128:10541:20:20:85:539:196:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:stability due to successful inflation-targeting monetary policy conduct, (ii) lower interest rates
5:129:10639:20:21:85:539:176:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:emanating from high competition in the banking sector, (iii) a shift of investment towards the
5:130:10733:21:20:85:351:155:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:housing market, as well as, (iv) low supply of dwellings.
5:131:10790:20:20:101:538:135:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:The lack of supply of housing in the UK has also been reported by authors such as Bean
5:132:10876:20:21:85:539:115:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:(2010), Barker (2004), Ball (2011), Reinold (2011), Whitehead and Williams (2011), Poon and
5:133:10967:21:20:85:539:94:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Garratt  (2012),  as  well  as,  Hilber  and  Vermeulen  (2014),  among  many  others.   In  addition,
5:134:11069:20:0:85:539:74:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Hay (2009), Bone and O’Reilly (2010), as well as, Whitehead and Williams (2011), emphasize
6:135:11160:0:20:85:538:712:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f7:accommodativemonetary policy practices, low interest rates and easy access to credit as factors
6:136:11255:20:21:85:539:692:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:conducive to higher housing prices within the UK. The fact that interest rate setting by BoE has
6:137:11351:21:20:85:539:671:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:a key role to play when it comes to the UK housing market, has also been recently underscored
6:138:11444:20:20:85:539:651:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:by Tse et al. (2014).  Gregoriou et al. (2013) identify a link between monetary policy conduct
6:139:11538:20:21:85:539:631:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:and housing affordability.  What is more, the argument that successfully controlling expectations
6:140:11635:21:20:85:539:610:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:about future levels of inflation is rather a key element in this framework of analysis appears to
6:141:11732:20:20:85:538:590:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f13:be in line with Brooks and Tsolacos (1999) who present evidence of negative effects ofunexpected
6:142:11828:20:21:85:539:570:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:inflation on the UK housing market.  On a different note, it is still a matter open to question
6:143:11923:21:20:85:539:549:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:whether the high prices of that period constituted a bubble in the market, and despite the fact
6:144:12018:20:20:85:539:529:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:that  authors  such  as  Blanchard  et  al.  (2010)  explain  that  deciding  whether  or  not  there  is  a
6:145:12126:20:21:85:539:509:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:bubble in any asset market is rather not straightforward; authors such as Morley and Thomas
6:146:12217:21:20:85:539:488:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:(2011)  put  forward  the  argument  that  we  should  not  rule  out  the  possibility  that  before  the
6:147:12323:20:20:85:538:468:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:years of theGreat  Recessionthe UK housing market potentially attracted speculators as well.
6:148:12415:20:21:85:539:448:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Very recently, the contribution of monetary policy to the development of a bubble in the UK
6:149:12506:21:20:85:338:427:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:housing market has been emphasized by Tsai (2015).
6:150:12556:20:20:101:538:407:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Be all this as it may, the upward trend in housing prices in the UK was interrupted by the
6:151:12646:20:21:85:538:387:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f7:Great  Recession.   In  August  2007,  the  global  financial  meltdown  has  had  a  profound  impact
6:152:12748:21:20:85:539:366:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:on  the  global  economy  and  sparked  discussions  regarding  the  efficiency  of  asset  markets  and
6:153:12852:20:20:85:539:346:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:whether asset prices bubbles exist and if they have the potential to nurture financial crises (see,
6:154:12951:20:21:85:538:326:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f7:inter alia, Obstfeld and Rogoff, 2009; Bernanke, 2010; Reinhart and Rogoff, 2013).  Support for
6:155:13046:21:20:85:539:305:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the argument that housing markets are rather inefficient and that price hikes cannot always be
6:156:13140:20:20:85:539:285:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:construed on the basis of fundamentals, can be found in the work of authors such as Case and
6:157:13232:20:20:85:539:265:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Shiller (1989, 2003), and Shiller (2007).  With reference to the UK housing market, Barkham and
6:158:13327:20:21:85:539:245:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Geltner (1996) find that the UK housing market is inefficient as it takes time for housing prices to
6:159:13427:21:20:85:539:224:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:fully incorporate new information and this lag has negative implications for new developments’
6:160:13521:20:20:85:539:204:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:planning.  In addition,  Schindler (2014) reports that the UK housing market is characterised
6:161:13614:20:21:85:539:184:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:by asymmetric information, while, Tsai and Chen (2009) and Tsai (2013) emphasize downward
6:162:13703:21:20:85:539:163:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f13:rigidity.  More specifically, Tsai (2013) argues that the housing prices in the UK exhibit acrash-
6:163:13801:20:20:85:538:143:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f7:proofphenomenon (i.e.  they exhibit a more stable reaction to bad news).  In this regard, UK
6:164:13893:20:21:85:443:123:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:housing prices tend to over-react in upturns and under-react in downturns.
6:165:13967:21:20:101:538:102:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:On  a  somewhat  parallel  note,  Reinold  (2011)  takes  the  view  that  the  lower  UK  housing
6:166:14065:20:0:85:539:82:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:prices recorded for the years that followed the Great Recession, could be directly attributed to
7:167:14162:0:20:85:539:712:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:tighter lending conditions which resulted in fewer housing market transactions and less wealth

7:169:14351:21:20:85:539:671:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:slowly  recovering  with  current  levels  of  prices  though  that  are  still  falling  short  of  their  pre-
7:170:14463:20:20:85:538:651:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f7:Great  Recessionperiod levels.  What is more, recent studies also concentrate on the effects of
7:171:14558:20:33:85:437:631:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:quantitative easing (see, Joyce et al., 2011) and migration (see, S ́a, 2015).

7:173:14687:23:20:101:538:575:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:The  investigation  of  the  interdependence  among  regional  housing  prices  has  gained  much
7:174:14784:20:21:85:539:555:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:prominence in recent years and many authors have provided evidence for a variety of countries
7:175:14877:21:20:85:539:534:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:(see, among others, Larraz-Iribas and Alfaro-Navarro, 2008; Zohrabyan et al., 2008; Clark and

7:178:15152:21:20:85:539:473:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:2015).  Understandably, this is a very important field of study with repercussions which extend
7:179:15247:20:20:85:539:453:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:towards both investors and policy makers.  From a purely financial point of view, investigating
7:180:15342:20:21:85:539:433:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:regional interdependencies and convergence among the various regions within a country might
7:181:15433:21:20:85:538:412:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:provide very useful insight in relation to efficientlydiversifying  investmentswithin a portfolio
7:182:15530:20:20:85:539:392:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:(e.g.  when we investigate the possibility of holding mortgage-backed securities   pertaining to
7:183:15626:20:20:85:539:372:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:different regions within the country  to be financially prudent).  Furthermore, the investigation
7:184:15723:20:21:85:539:352:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:of regional disparities might prove a great analytical tool and help policy makers achieve a more
7:185:15820:21:20:85:283:331:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:balanced development across the country.
7:186:15860:20:20:101:538:311:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:As  far  as  the  UK  housing  market  is  concerned,  there  have  been  quite  a  few  studies  over
7:187:15962:20:21:85:539:291:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the years investigating the transmission of shocks across regional housing markets; that is, the
7:188:16058:21:20:85:538:270:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:so-called  ripple  effect.1According  to  Cook  and  Watson  (2015),  the  ripple  effect  in  the  UK
7:189:16160:20:20:85:539:250:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:basically refers to the hypothesis that changes in housing prices initially occur in London and
7:190:16255:20:21:85:539:230:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:South-Eastern parts of the UK and are then subsequently transmitted to other regions within
7:191:16346:21:20:85:539:209:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the  country.   In  their  thorough  investigation  of  this  phenomenon,  Cook  and  Watson  (2015)
7:192:16446:20:20:85:539:189:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:report that the most dominant viewpoint in the literature relating to the ripple effect is that
7:193:16541:20:21:85:539:169:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:contrasting London to other regions implies a short-term divergence of regional housing prices
7:194:16635:21:20:85:270:148:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:followed by a longer-term convergence.
7:195:16673:20:30:101:538:128:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Recent empirical evidence is rather inconclusive about the actual manifestation of the ripple
7:196:16766:30:20:85:538:98:6:g_d0_f17:9:g_d0_f15:1A thorough investigation of the literature pertaining to the ripple effect in the UK housing market can be found
7:197:16879:20:0:89:203:78:9:g_d0_f15:9:g_d0_f15:in Cook and Watson (2015).
8:198:16906:0:20:85:538:712:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f13:effect.  Drake (1995, p.357) reports “clear regional differences in the patterns of UK house price
8:199:17004:20:21:85:538:692:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f7:movements”  with  prices  in  Northern  parts  of  the  UK  exhibiting  higher  divergence  compared
8:200:17104:21:20:85:539:671:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:to  their  South-Eastern  counterparts.   Results  regarding  the  persistence  of  the  North  to  price
8:201:17209:20:20:85:539:651:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:changes in London can also be found in the work of Holmes and Grimes (2008, p.  1543) who
8:202:17298:20:21:85:538:631:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f13:note that the ripple effect is present; however, “the adjustment speed is considerably slower than
8:203:17396:21:20:85:538:610:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f7:for  all  other  regions”.  Authors such as Meen (1996, 1999) and Cook (2003, 2005) show that
8:204:17489:20:20:85:539:590:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:increases in housing prices in the South-East have a lagged effect on Northern and Western parts
8:205:17585:20:21:85:538:570:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f13:of the UK, lending weight to the argument that regional housing prices are ratherstationary
8:206:17676:21:20:85:539:549:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:(i.e.  there is a stable ratio of regional over national housing prices over time mainly reflecting
8:207:17775:20:20:85:539:529:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:a  firm  long-run  relationship  between  the  two).   What  is  more,  Bouchouicha  and  Ftiti  (2012)
8:208:17878:20:21:85:539:509:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:show that there is a common trend that drives the real estate market in the UK, while Schindler
8:209:17973:21:20:85:539:488:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:(2014) provides evidence of persistent housing prices and that there may be opportunities for
8:210:18066:20:20:85:539:468:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:investors to hedge risk in the market of derivatives.  In addition, Tsai (2014a) distinguishes the
8:211:18164:20:21:85:539:448:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:information transmission mechanisms between regional and national housing markets in the UK
8:212:18255:21:20:85:539:427:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:and puts forward the argument that only two regions (i.e.  East and South West) show signs of
8:213:18348:20:20:85:437:407:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:comovement with the national housing market over the period 1995-2012.
8:214:18418:20:21:101:538:387:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:On a final note, given London’s importance for the UK housing market,geographicalproxim-
8:215:18506:21:20:85:539:366:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:ity to London appears to be a decisive factor in relation to the ripple effect.  Holly et al. (2011)
8:216:18606:20:20:85:539:346:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:report that it takes more time for a shock in the housing market of London to propagate another
8:217:18701:20:21:85:539:326:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:UK region when this region is relatively distant from London.  Along a similar vein, Cook and

9:247:20723:22:21:85:539:280:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Our analysis is based on the connectedness approach introduced by Diebold and Yilmaz (2014)
9:248:20814:21:20:85:539:259:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:which builds on the seminal work on VAR models by Sims (1980) and the notion of variance
9:249:20902:20:20:85:539:239:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:decompositions.   It  allows  an  assessment  of  the  contributions  of  shocks  to  variables  to  their

9:251:21113:21:20:85:539:198:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:estimation,  the evolution of the various connectedness measures can be traced over time and

10:268:21865:20:20:101:538:590:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:The connectedness approach of Diebold and Yilmaz (2014) is based on the generalized VAR

10:270:22045:21:20:85:539:549:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:decompositions are invariant to the ordering of the variables.  Of course, this has advantages and
10:271:22143:20:20:85:539:529:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:drawbacks.  Given our goal to assess the magnitude of UK regional property price connectedness

11:359:25147:29:20:85:539:203:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:In this section, we present the results from our empirical analysis.  We start with the estimates
11:360:25244:20:21:85:539:183:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:of the static connectedness measure (i.e.  an average estimate for the full sample period), and
11:361:25339:21:20:85:539:162:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:then consider the dynamic nature of connectedness using rolling window estimation.  It should
11:362:25432:20:20:85:539:142:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:be noted that, for the sake of brevity, discussion will be mainly centred around the results we
11:363:25527:20:21:85:539:122:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:obtain  in  relation  to  net  directional  and  net  pairwise  connectedness  especially  for  the  period
11:364:25634:21:20:85:539:101:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:right  before  (i.e.   increasing  housing  prices)  and  after  (i.e.   deteriorating  housing  prices)  the
11:365:25743:20:0:85:538:81:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:years of theGreat  Recession.  By doing so, we concentrate our analysis on what is perhaps a
12:366:25837:0:20:85:539:712:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:key consideration of recent literature; that is, to shed additional light to recent dynamic inter-
12:367:25935:20:21:85:539:692:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:regional features of the UK housing market and provide further evidence associated with the
12:368:26026:21:32:85:348:671:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:ripple effect and the UK housing market segmentation.

12:370:26107:23:21:85:539:616:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Table 2 presents the estimation results for the connectedness indices defined in Equations (4)-(7),
12:371:26206:21:20:85:539:595:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:based on 4-quarter-ahead forecast error variance decompositions.  Before discussing the results,
12:372:26302:20:20:85:538:575:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:let  us  first  describe  the  structure  and  elements  of  Table  2.   Theijthentry  is  the  estimated

12:374:26498:21:20:85:538:534:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:to property regionj(see Equation (2)).  The diagonal elements (i=j) measure intra-regional
12:375:26588:20:20:85:538:514:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:connectedness  of  shocks  (over  time),  while  the  off–diagonal  elements  (i6=j)  capture  inter-
12:376:26689:20:21:85:342:494:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:regional (i.e., cross–variable) connectedness of shocks.
12:377:26745:21:20:101:538:473:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:In addition,  the row sums excluding the main diagonal elements (labelled ‘Connectedness

12:379:26925:20:21:85:539:433:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:region in the respective row, whereas the column sums (labelled ‘Connectedness to others’, see
12:380:27019:21:20:85:539:412:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Equation (6)) report the total connectednessfrom(transmitted by) the particular region in the
12:381:27112:20:20:85:539:392:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:respective column.  The difference between each region’s (off-diagonal) column sum and the same
12:382:27207:20:20:85:539:372:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:region’s row sum gives the net connectedness of the respective region to all other regions (see
12:383:27302:20:21:85:539:352:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Equation (7)).  Finally,  the total connectedness index defined in Equation (4),  which is given
12:384:27398:21:20:85:539:331:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:in the lower right corner of Table 2, is approximately equal to the grand off-diagonal column
12:385:27491:20:20:85:539:311:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:sum (or row sum) relative to the grand column sum including diagonals (or row sum including
12:386:27582:20:33:85:292:291:11:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f8:diagonals), expressed in percentage points.3

12:388:27647:32:20:101:538:226:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Table  2,  which  summarises  the  average  connectedness  for  the  full  sample  period  reveals
12:389:27745:20:21:85:539:206:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:several  interesting  findings.   First,  intra-regional  connectedness  explains  the  highest  share  of
12:390:27851:21:20:85:539:185:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:forecast error variance,  as the diagonal elements receive higher values compared with the off-
12:391:27946:20:20:85:539:165:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:diagonal  elements.   For  instance,  innovations  to  housing  market  returns  in  Northern  Ireland
12:392:28048:20:30:85:539:145:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:explain 37.9% of the 4-quarter-ahead forecast error variance of housing market returns in the
12:393:28141:30:20:85:538:115:6:g_d0_f17:9:g_d0_f15:3The approximate nature of the result is due to the fact that the contributions of the variables do not sum to 1
12:394:28253:20:0:89:471:95:9:g_d0_f15:9:g_d0_f15:under the generalized decomposition framework and have to be normalized (see Equation (3)).
13:395:28346:0:20:85:539:712:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Northern  Ireland,  and  only  6.4%  and  6.2%  of  the  4-quarter-ahead  forecast  error  variance  of
13:396:28449:20:21:85:379:692:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:housing market returns in Scotland and London, respectively.
13:397:28509:21:20:101:538:671:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Second,  the  most  important  transmitters  of  inter-regional  shocks  are  the  housing  market
13:398:28607:20:20:85:539:651:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:returns in South West,  Outer South East and East Anglia regions,  while the housing market
13:399:28698:20:21:85:539:631:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:returns in North, Yorkshire, Scotland and East Midlands are the most important receivers of
13:400:28789:21:20:85:539:610:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:inter-regional housing market return shocks.  These results are supported by the estimated net
13:401:28883:20:20:85:539:590:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:directional spillovers reported in the last row of Table 2.  Put differently, these results indicate
13:402:28983:20:21:85:539:570:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:that real house market returns shocks in the South West, Outer South East and East Anglia
13:403:29072:21:20:85:460:549:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:regions have historically been the dominant sources of inter-regional spillovers.
13:404:29153:20:20:101:538:529:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Third, and most importantly, according to the total inter-regional connectedness reported at
13:405:29245:20:21:85:539:509:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the lower right corner of Table 2, which effectively distils the various directional connectedness
13:406:29343:21:20:85:539:488:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:measures into one single index, on average, 83.9% of the forecast error variance in regional hous-
13:407:29441:20:20:85:539:468:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:ing market returns comes from spillovers across regions, while the remainder can be explained
13:408:29534:20:21:85:198:448:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:by own-regional shocks.
13:409:29557:21:20:101:538:427:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:In retrospect, findings are indicative of a high degree of inter-regional interdependence and
13:410:29650:20:20:85:539:407:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:this is ultimately reflected on the high average values of both total and directional spillovers
13:411:29746:20:31:85:347:387:11:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f8:across regions reported for the period of investigation.4

13:413:29828:22:21:85:539:334:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:While the average results for the full sample period in Table 2 are indicative they might mask
13:414:29922:21:20:85:539:313:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:interesting changes in the pattern of inter-regional connectedness, given the long time span of
13:415:30017:20:20:85:539:293:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:four decades considered.  Hence, we estimate the model in Equation (1) using 60-quarter rolling
13:416:30112:20:21:85:538:273:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:windows and calculate the variance decompositions and connectedness measures.5As a result,
13:417:30202:21:20:85:539:252:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:we obtain time-varying estimates of connectedness measures, allowing us to assess the evolution
13:418:30297:20:20:85:539:232:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:of total and directional connectedness over time both within and between the various regions in

13:423:30613:25:20:85:538:107:6:g_d0_f17:9:g_d0_f15:4We have explored the robustness of our results using alternative forecasting horizons (i.e.  8 and 12 quarters)
13:424:30725:20:9:89:266:87:9:g_d0_f15:9:g_d0_f15:and the results remain qualitatively similar.
13:425:30770:9:0:85:518:78:6:g_d0_f17:9:g_d0_f15:5Our results reported below remain robust to alternative choices of window length (i.e.  70 and 80 months).
14:426:30879:0:20:85:539:712:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:which turns out very responsive to extreme economic events and UK recessions. For instance, the
14:427:30974:20:21:85:539:692:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:total connectedness of UK regional housing market returns reaches a peak during the withdrawn
14:428:31067:21:20:85:539:671:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:of UK from the ERM, the Subprime mortage crisis and due to Eurozone debt worries that pushed
14:429:31159:20:20:85:539:651:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:up the cost of borrowing for banks, which in turn passed on their higher cost to new mortgage
14:430:31252:20:21:85:539:631:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:borrowers.   This  suggests  that  interdependencies  across  regions  in  the  UK  tend  to  increase
14:431:31354:21:20:85:280:610:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:significantly during economic downturns.
14:432:31394:20:20:101:538:590:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:In  order  to  attain  a  better  understanding  of  regional  interdependence  in  the  UK  housing
14:433:31494:20:21:85:539:570:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:market it would be instructive to proceed with our analysis and concentrate on “directional con-
14:434:31590:21:20:85:539:549:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:nectedness” as this is decomposed into “directional connectedness FROM others” (see, equation
14:435:31683:20:20:85:539:529:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:(5)) and Table 2 for its average value) and directional connectedness TO others (see, equation

14:440:31991:30:20:101:538:399:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:According to these two figures, directional connectedness from or to each region range be-
14:441:32081:20:20:85:539:379:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:tween 2% and 18% and are of bidirectional nature.  Nevertheless,  they behave rather hetero-
14:442:32173:20:21:85:539:359:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:geneously over time and follow a similar pattern as the one found for the total connectedness
14:443:32266:21:20:85:539:338:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:measure.  That is, directional connectedness from or to each region generally peak during the
14:444:32359:20:20:85:458:318:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:extreme economic events, such as housing bubble bursting and UK recessions.
14:445:32434:20:21:101:538:298:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:To the effect that we are able to deduce the extent to which each one of the regions under
14:446:32524:21:20:85:539:277:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:investigation is either a net transmitter or a net receiver of shocks in housing market returns, we

14:449:32815:21:20:85:539:216:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:connectedness  across  the  various  UK  regions)  that  all  regions  under  investigation  appear  to
14:450:32918:20:20:85:539:196:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:frequently switch between assuming a net transmitting and a net receiving role.  For instance,
14:451:33012:20:21:85:539:176:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the  importance  of  housing  market  return  shocks,  and  especially  those  originating  in  the  UK
14:452:33115:21:20:85:539:155:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:regions  of  South  West,  Outer  South  East,  East  Midlands  and  Northern  Ireland  seem  to  be
14:453:33215:20:20:85:539:135:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the dominant transmitters of property returns shocks during our sample period, with Northern
14:454:33307:20:21:85:539:115:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Ireland being at the epicenter of the transmission process in the period of the global financial
14:455:33403:21:20:85:539:94:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:crisis and the housing market collapse, suggesting that housing markets in the UK regions are
14:456:33496:20:0:85:539:74:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:highly interconnected and extreme economic event dependent.  Conversely, the UK regions of
15:457:33588:0:20:85:539:712:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:North,  Yorkshire and Humbershide,  London,  Wales and Scotland are mainly at the receiving
15:458:33679:20:28:85:395:692:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:ends of net inter-regional transmission during the sample period.
15:459:33744:28:27:266:356:664:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:[Insert Fig.  6 here]
15:460:33765:27:20:101:538:637:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:We now turn our attention to net pairwise directional connectedness obtained from the 60-
15:461:33854:20:21:85:539:617:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:quarter  rolling  window  estimation  presented  in  Fig.   7,  which  bring  further  insights  into  the
15:462:33960:21:20:85:539:596:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:transmission process of property returns shocks across UK regions.  For instance, the dominance
15:463:34055:20:20:85:539:576:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:of  the  net  transmitting  role  of  house  returns  shocks  in  the  South  West  region  is  evident  as
15:464:34162:20:21:85:539:556:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:shocks in that region are being transmitted to all other UK regions, apart from that in Northern
15:465:34258:21:20:85:539:535:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Ireland.  A similar picture is observed for shocks originating in the regions of Outer South East,
15:466:34356:20:20:85:539:515:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:East  Midlands  and  Northern  Ireland.   These  results  suggest  that  the  information  content  of
15:467:34458:20:21:85:539:495:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:house returns in the UK regions of South West, Outer South East, East Midlands and Northern
15:468:34549:21:20:85:539:474:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Ireland  can  help  improve  forecast  accuracy  of  houss  returns  in  the  other  UK  regions.   More-
15:469:34654:20:20:85:539:454:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:over,  while  the  static  analysis  discussed  above  clearly  classifies  the  aforementioned  variables
15:470:34760:20:21:85:539:434:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:into net transmitters and net receivers, the dynamic analysis denotes episodes wherein the net
15:471:34854:21:20:85:539:413:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:role of transmitters and receivers of house returns shocks can be interrupted or even reversed.
15:472:34949:20:20:85:539:393:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Hence,  even if certain commonalities prevail in the property market in each UK region,  such
15:473:35042:20:28:85:309:373:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:commonalities are time– and event–dependent.

15:475:35107:27:20:101:538:318:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:A more in-depth look at the results might be quite insightful in relation to the key consid-
15:476:35199:20:21:85:539:298:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:erations  of  our  study.   In  particular,  concentrating  on  the  results  presented  in  Figures  6  and
15:477:35307:21:20:85:539:277:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:7 we can reach useful conclusions in connection with the dominant character of each region in
15:478:35400:20:20:85:539:257:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the transmission of housing returns shocks.  As earlier mentioned, our analysis is limited to the
15:479:35497:20:21:85:539:237:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:period before, during and after the Great Recession, mainly in order to appreciate developments
15:480:35592:21:20:85:539:216:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:in the UK housing market under the prism of both increasing and decreasing housing prices.  In
15:481:35686:20:20:85:539:196:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:addition, we pay particular attention to the connectedness of London to other regions in the UK
15:482:35781:20:21:85:539:176:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:because London is a key element of the discussion around the ripple effect.  By emphasizing net
15:483:35876:21:20:85:539:155:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:directional and net pairwise spillovers across UK regions,  we aim to provide further evidence
15:484:35970:20:20:85:539:135:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:regarding the ripple effect, on one hand, and regional segmentation of the UK housing market
15:485:36062:20:21:85:147:115:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:on the other.
15:486:36075:21:20:101:538:94:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:To begin with, it is evident from Figure 6 that London throughout the period of study acts
15:487:36165:20:0:85:539:74:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:not  exclusively  as  a  net  transmitter  of  shocks,  as  someone  might  initially  have  thought,  but
16:488:36273:0:20:85:539:712:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:also as a net receiver.  In the early and mid-1990s London appears to be a net transmitter of
16:489:36366:20:21:85:539:692:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:shocks to other regions.  The London housing market appears to transmit shocks again during
16:490:36457:21:20:85:539:671:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the peak of the UK housing market boom around 2005 and again very recently over the past few
16:491:36549:20:20:85:539:651:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:years.  It is worth noting though, that during the years of the Great Recession and also during
16:492:36644:20:21:85:539:631:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the recent European debt crisis which began in 2009,  London appears to receive shocks from
16:493:36735:21:20:85:539:610:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:other regions in the UK as well.  Authors such as Holly et al. (2011) emphasize that London is a
16:494:36831:20:20:85:539:590:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:global financial centre and one of the largest cities in Europe and therefore, London’s residential
16:495:36930:20:21:85:539:570:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:prices might actually reflect developments both at the international and at the local UK level.
16:496:37025:21:20:85:539:549:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Understandably,  local  UK  factors  might  also  include  developments  in  the  housing  market  of
16:497:37126:20:20:85:539:529:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:other UK regions, while, this might be more evident during turbulent economic periods.  Thus,
16:498:37219:20:21:85:404:509:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:it could make sense for London to also assume a net recipient role.
16:499:37286:21:20:101:538:488:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:As far  as the  ripple  effect is  concerned,  first we need to  emphasize that  results presented
16:500:37384:20:20:85:539:468:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:in Figures 6 and 7 merely reflect the net outcome of directional spillovers and in this regard
16:501:37478:20:21:85:539:448:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:they  do  not  imply  that  when  London  acts  as  a  net  recipient  of  shocks  there  is  no  influence
16:502:37585:21:20:85:539:427:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:stemming from shocks in London to other regions as well.  Results indicate though, that housing
16:503:37680:20:20:85:539:407:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:price developments within the UK (irrespective of how long it takes for these to be realised)
16:504:37773:20:21:85:539:387:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:cannot be solely attributed to innovations in London.  According to Tsai (2014b), London is a
16:505:37866:21:20:85:539:366:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:segmented housing market and innovations within this market can be attributed to factors that
16:506:37959:20:20:85:539:346:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:do not really propagate other UK regions.  By contrast, we find that London is not segmented
16:507:38051:20:21:85:539:326:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:and it may very well be a net transmitter of shocks; however, considering a dynamic framework
16:508:38144:21:20:85:539:305:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:of  analysis  we  provide  evidence  that  the  ripple  effect  is  a  rather  more  complex  notion  as  its
16:509:38253:20:20:85:539:285:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:implications  appear  to  be  time  dependent.   In  other  words,  depending  on  the  time  period  of
16:510:38357:20:20:85:539:265:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:analysis and the corresponding economic or political events, most regions seem to be conducive
16:511:38451:20:21:85:539:245:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:to developments in the UK housing market.  A stellar example of this argument can be seen
16:512:38540:21:20:85:539:224:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:in  Figure  6  and  more  specifically,  when  we  look  at  the  strong  net  transmitting  character  of
16:513:38646:20:20:85:400:204:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Northern Ireland from the outset of the Great Recession onwards.
16:514:38710:20:21:101:538:184:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:To conclude our discussion about the net transmitting/receiving character of London in con-
16:515:38801:21:20:85:539:163:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:nection with the ripple effect, we concentrate on Figure 7; that is, on net pairwise connectedness.
16:516:38900:20:20:85:539:143:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Prominent among the results presented in this Figure is the fact that for almost throughout the
16:517:38995:20:21:85:539:123:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:period of investigation London has been a net recipient of shocks from the South West.  What is
16:518:39090:21:20:85:539:102:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:more, in the years just before the beginning of the Great Recession, London appears to transmit
16:519:39185:20:0:85:539:82:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:shocks mainly to West Midlands,  Outer South East,  as well as,  Outer Metropolitan.  During
17:520:39279:0:20:85:539:712:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the Great Recession, London is a net transmitter of shocks to mainly to the Outer South East.
17:521:39372:20:21:85:539:692:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Finally  in  the  years  that  followed  the  Great  Recession,  London  acts  as  a  net  transmitter  of
17:522:39478:21:20:85:478:671:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:shocks mainly in relation to North, North West, East Anglia, as well as, Scotland.
17:523:39560:20:20:101:538:651:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Despite the fact that comovements between housing prices in London and housing prices in
17:524:39648:20:21:85:539:631:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the South East have also been emphasized by authors such as Cook and Watson (2015) who
17:525:39734:21:20:85:539:610:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:further argue that proximity to London constitutes a crucial factor when it comes to analysing
17:526:39828:20:20:85:539:590:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the ripple effect and Henretty (2015) who stresses that the impact of the London housing market
17:527:39923:20:21:85:539:570:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:on  its  neighbouring  regions  can  be  confirmed  by  investigating  housing  prices  in  the  cities  of
17:528:40030:21:20:85:539:549:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Guildford and Reading; our findings again verify that the transmission of housing market shocks
17:529:40125:20:20:85:539:529:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:in the UK seems to be a dynamic and event dependent process.  It is also worth noting, that
17:530:40216:20:21:85:539:509:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Tsai (2014b) reports that in terms of price discovery the South East region is very important
17:531:40309:21:20:85:539:488:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:and provides evidence that changes in housing prices in the South East affect UK housing prices
17:532:40404:20:20:85:164:468:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:with some delay.
17:533:40420:20:21:101:538:448:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:With reference to results pertaining to other regions within the UK which act as net trans-
17:534:40511:21:20:85:539:427:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:mitters of shocks at different periods, identifying factors that drive housing prices within these
17:535:40609:20:20:85:539:407:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:regions might help explain the dynamics that link housing prices across the UK. The investiga-
17:536:40703:20:21:85:539:387:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:tion of factors such as the size and the diversity of the job market, the supply of newly built
17:537:40798:21:20:85:539:366:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:dwellings,  migration levels,  as well as,  existing and planned infrastructure and transport net-
17:538:40896:20:20:85:539:346:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:works, among others, could potentially provide the basis for a more thorough analysis of ripple
17:539:40991:20:21:85:539:326:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:effects  across  the  UK  regions.   Piggott  (200)  and  Holly  et  al.  (2011)  report  that  there  exists
17:540:41100:21:20:85:539:305:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:a considerable amount of commuters between London and the South West - a fact that might
17:541:41188:20:20:85:539:285:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:potentially act as a starting point in explaining the significant role of the South West as a net
17:542:41285:20:20:85:539:265:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:transmitting region.  On a parallel note, S ́a (2015) emphasizes the mobility of native population
17:543:41383:20:21:85:539:245:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:across the UK   as a response to migration   and its negative effect on UK housing prices.  In
17:544:41477:21:20:85:539:224:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the same line of reasoning, the continued plummeting of housing prices in Northern Ireland in
17:545:41570:20:20:85:539:204:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:recent years, could potentially affect other regions (including London), thus justifying Northern
17:546:41667:20:21:85:539:184:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Ireland’s current strong net transmitting role.  What is more, the link between economic activity
17:547:41764:21:20:85:539:163:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:in Northern Ireland and that in the Republic of Ireland   a link which is rather strong   should
17:548:41860:20:20:85:181:143:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:also be investigated.
17:549:41881:20:21:101:538:123:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Finally, in line with Gupta and Miller (2012) we find that geographic regions within the UK
17:550:41972:21:20:85:539:102:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:all contribute to developments in their respective housing markets.  In particular,  we provide
17:551:42067:20:0:85:539:82:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:evidence that the UK housing market is not segmented and that different periods of time in the
18:552:42163:0:20:85:539:712:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:light of different economic and political events, lend either a net transmitting or a net receiving
18:553:42262:20:32:85:331:692:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:role to each one of the regions under investigations.

18:555:42340:22:20:101:538:638:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:In an attempt to check the robustness of the results obtained based on the generalised version
18:556:42434:20:21:85:539:618:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:of the connectedness measure by Diebold and Yilmaz (2014), we repeat the VAR-based analysis
18:557:42525:21:20:85:539:597:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:based on Cholesky decomposition, in which the forecast error variance decomposition is sensitive
18:558:42621:20:20:85:539:577:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:to the ordering of the variables in the VAR. In particular, we analyse 200 random permutations
18:559:42715:20:21:85:539:557:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:(different  orderings  of  the  13  UK  regional  property  returns  in  the  VAR)  and  construct  the
18:560:42818:21:20:85:539:536:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:corresponding  connectedness  indices  for  each  ordering.   Figure  8  presents  the  minimum  and
18:561:42918:20:20:85:539:516:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:maximum values that the total connectedness index receives based on Cholesky factorization.
18:562:43009:20:21:85:539:496:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:According  to  this  figure,  the  results  are  in  line  with  those  of  our  main  approach  reported  in
18:563:43118:21:20:85:539:475:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Figure 3.  In particular, the connectedness index varies between 72% and 89%.  In addition, total
18:564:43215:20:20:85:539:455:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:connectedness is large in the beginning of the 1990s and thereafter follows a declining trend till
18:565:43313:20:21:85:539:435:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the end of the 1990s.  Then it follows and increasing trend till the end of our sample period.
18:566:43407:21:20:85:539:414:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:The similarity of the pattern obtained using these two alternative approaches is reassuring and
18:567:43502:20:31:85:275:394:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:underlines the robustness of our results.

18:569:43564:37:28:85:161:326:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:5. Conclusion
18:570:43577:28:21:85:539:298:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:This study examines the magnitude, importance and evolution of intra- and inter-regional in-
18:571:43669:21:20:85:539:277:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:terconnectedness of property returns in the UK, using quarterly data over the period 1973Q4
18:572:43760:20:20:85:539:257:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:to 2014Q4.  We employ the VAR-based connectedness approach by Diebold and Yilmaz (2014),
18:573:43848:20:21:85:539:237:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:which is well suited for the investigation of interdependencies but has rarely been used in this
18:574:43944:21:20:85:228:216:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:strand of the literature so far.
18:575:43976:20:20:101:538:196:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:We find that the transmission of inter-regional property return shocks is an important source
18:576:44069:20:21:85:539:176:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:of  regional  property  return  fluctuations  in  the  United  Kingdom.   On  average  over  the  whole
18:577:44172:21:20:85:539:155:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:sample period, 83.9% of forecast error variance of property returns across the 13 regions in the
18:578:44268:20:20:85:539:135:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:United Kingdom is due to inter-sectoral spillovers.  Moreover, inter-sectoral connectedness shows
18:579:44365:20:21:85:539:115:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:a large variation over time.  The importance of spillovers, and especially those originating in the
18:580:44464:21:20:85:539:94:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:UK regions of South West, Outer South East, East Midlands and Northern Ireland seem to be
18:581:44553:20:0:85:539:74:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the dominant transmitters of property returns shocks during our sample period, with Northern
19:582:44647:0:20:85:539:712:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Ireland being at the epicenter of the transmission process in the period of the global financial
19:583:44743:20:21:85:539:692:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:crisis and the housing market collapse, suggesting that housing markets in the UK regions are
19:584:44836:21:20:85:382:671:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:highly interconnected and extreme economic event dependent.
19:585:44895:20:20:101:538:651:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:With reference to the ripple effect,  in line with existing literature we find that London is
19:586:44988:20:21:85:539:631:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:closely linked to various UK regions and acts as a net transmitter of shocks; however, the regions
19:587:45086:21:20:85:539:610:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:which receive shocks from London vary depending on the period of focus.  In other words, within
19:588:45181:20:20:85:539:590:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the dynamic framework of our study, we provide evidence that London is not always important
19:589:45272:20:21:85:539:570:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:for the same regions over time, as well as, that London itself may also receive shocks from other
19:590:45369:21:20:85:539:549:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:UK regions.  This finding is very important as it implies that further research is necessary in
19:591:45464:20:20:85:539:529:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:order to identify the specific features within each UK region and better understand the ensuing
19:592:45559:20:21:85:539:509:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:inter-regional dependencies over time.  Finally, we confirm that the UK housing market is not
19:593:45652:21:20:85:539:488:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:fragmented and that interregional dependencies affect all UK regions throughout the period of
19:594:45745:20:20:85:148:468:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:investigation.
19:595:45759:20:21:101:538:448:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Overall, our findings have an important policy implication.  As the recent subprime mortgage
19:596:45851:21:20:85:539:427:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:financial and economic crisis has shown, shocks rapidly spread over the various regions of the UK
19:597:45948:20:20:85:539:407:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:economy and have a magnified impact.  The large magnitude of spillover effects obtained in the
19:598:46042:20:21:85:539:387:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:present study underlines the importance of establishing appropriate regulations and stabilization
19:599:46139:21:20:85:301:366:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:policies in the housing sector of the economy.
19:600:46185:20:20:101:538:346:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Identifying the determinants of housing prices within the various UK regions would be an
19:601:46273:20:21:85:539:326:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:interesting  area  for  future  research  as  it  would  further  increase  our  understanding  regarding
19:602:46378:21:20:85:539:305:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:regional inter-dependence within the UK. Another promising avenue for future research would
19:603:46469:20:20:85:539:285:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:be  to  extend  the  analysis  at  an  international  level,  so  as  to  examine  whether  international
19:604:46574:20:20:85:539:265:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:housing markets which underwent similar peaks and troughs to the UK housing market are also
19:605:46665:20:39:85:157:245:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:interconnected.
