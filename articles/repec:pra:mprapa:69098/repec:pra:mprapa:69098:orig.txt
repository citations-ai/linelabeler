2:15:453:57:23:284:328:500:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:Abstract
2:16:461:23:17:114:513:477:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:In this paper, we experimentally investigate the impact of costly indirect and direct messages
2:17:555:17:16:99:512:460:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:on coordination levels in a stag-hunt game.  We also compare the coordination rates with costly
2:18:650:16:17:99:512:444:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:pre-play communication to the rates with costless pre-play communication.  Three main insights
2:19:744:17:17:99:512:427:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:emerge from our experiments. First, we find a significant decrease in message usage with message
2:20:840:17:17:99:512:410:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:cost in both treatments and a higher decrease in the indirect-message treatment.  Second, we
2:21:932:17:16:99:512:393:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:find  that  although  there  is  no  significant  effect  of  costless  or  costly  indirect  messages  on  the
2:22:1043:16:17:99:512:377:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:frequency  of  risky  actions,  both  costless  and  costly  direct  messages  significantly  increase  the
2:23:1150:17:17:99:512:360:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:frequency of risky actions.  Third, while we find a significant increase in the coordination rate
2:24:1247:17:17:99:512:343:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:on the payoff-dominant equilibrium from costless indirect message treatment to costly indirect
2:25:1341:17:16:99:512:326:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:message treatment, this rate significantly decreases from costless direct message to costly direct
2:26:1439:16:17:99:512:310:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:message treatment.  Our findings show that depending on the structure of messages, message
2:27:1529:17:17:99:487:293:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:cost may increase or decrease the coordination rates on the payoff-dominant equilibrium.

3:36:2231:0:30:72:185:722:14:g_d0_f14:14:g_d0_f14:1  Introduction
3:37:2246:30:19:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:People may use signals to convey some information about themselves to their opponents in strategic
3:38:2344:19:19:72:540:673:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:interactions under incomplete information.  Depending on the message type or to make the message
3:39:2440:19:19:72:540:654:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:more  credible,  people  may  be  willing  to  bear  some  cost,  e.g.,  investing  in  education  for  the  job
3:40:2552:19:19:72:540:635:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:search, reciprocal altruism or voting by social image concerns.  This paper analyzes the impact of
3:41:2650:19:19:72:540:616:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:optional and costly messages on the coordination levels in a stag-hunt game when the message is
3:42:2745:19:19:72:540:597:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:indirect or direct.  The effect of using these messages on socially desirable efficient coordination
3:43:2845:19:19:72:540:578:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:is also compared to the cases in which there are no messages (or pre-play communication) or the
3:44:2940:19:19:72:178:559:11:g_d0_f11:8:g_d0_f15:messages are costless.1
3:45:2963:19:19:88:539:540:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:For the indirect message or signal case,  we give a chance to one of the players  to signal her
3:46:3058:19:19:71:539:521:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:risk attitude to the other player.  Such an indirect message is important for the game when the
3:47:3153:19:19:71:539:502:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:payoffs from the game are monetary and strategic risk exists in the game.  In a stag-hunt game,
3:48:3248:19:19:71:539:483:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:players choose between strategically safe and risky actions (respectively, Action A and Action B
3:49:3344:19:19:71:539:464:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:in Table 1).  Depending on a player’s own action choice as well as her opponent’s action choice,
3:50:3440:19:19:71:539:445:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:they  may  end  up  in  the  payoff-dominant  equilibrium  ((Action  B,  Action  B))  indicating  socially
3:51:3546:19:19:71:539:426:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:desirable efficient coordination, in the risk-dominant equilibrium ((Action A, Action A)), or out of
3:52:3646:19:19:71:539:407:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:equilibrium ((Action A, Action B), (Action B, Action A)).   For the direct signal case, we give a
3:53:3743:19:38:71:494:388:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:chance to one of the players to signal his intented action choice before playing the game.

3:59:4013:19:15:72:540:251:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:Porath  and  Dekel  (1992)  show  that  as  long  as  only  one  of  the  players  has  the  option  to  send  a
3:60:4125:15:19:84:539:236:6:g_d0_f17:9:g_d0_f13:1We  study  costly  pre-play  communication  to  make  both  senders  and  receivers  think  about  the  effects  of  the
3:61:4246:19:16:72:540:217:9:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f13:messages  more.   Our  aim  is  to  concentrate  on  the  impact  of  credible  messages,  not  cheap-talk,  on  the  efficient
3:62:4373:16:15:72:540:201:9:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f13:coordination.  See B ̈uy ̈ukboyacı and K ̈u ̧c ̈uk ̧senel (2016) for more on the impact of costless messages or cheap talk on
3:63:4498:15:8:72:159:186:9:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f13:efficient coordination.
3:64:4521:8:20:84:539:178:6:g_d0_f17:9:g_d0_f13:2The games that are similar to money burning games require players to apply forward induction reasoning while
3:65:4630:20:15:72:540:158:9:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f13:playing the game.  The common feature of most experiments using such games is that there is a two-stage game.  In
3:66:4743:15:15:72:540:143:9:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f13:the first stage, a player can typically choose an outside option, burn money, or pay an entrance fee.  In the second
3:67:4859:15:0:72:540:128:9:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f13:stage,  there is typically a game with a coordination problem such as the battle of the sexes or pure coordination
4:68:4974:0:19:72:540:722:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:costly message, playing the efficient action without sending a message is the unique outcome that
4:69:5071:19:19:72:540:703:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:survives  iterated  admissibility.3In  our  paper,  we  give  the  opportunity  to  communicate  to  the
4:70:5175:19:19:72:540:684:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:sender.  The sender chooses to send a message about how risk averse he is when the message is
4:71:5268:19:19:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:indirect and which action he would choose in the game when the message is direct.  As Ben-Porath
4:72:5364:19:19:72:540:646:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:and Dekel (1992) suggest, the prediction of our game is the sender does not send a costly message
4:73:5461:19:19:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:independent of whether the message is direct or indirect and players are still able to coordinate on
4:74:5561:19:19:72:229:608:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:the payoff-dominant equilibrium.
4:75:5593:19:19:88:539:589:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:There  are  only  few  experimental  papers  testing  costly  signaling  in  coordination  games.   The
4:76:5696:19:19:72:540:570:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:first one is Fehr (2011) in which he looks at the effect of costly communication when two groups
4:77:5792:19:19:72:540:551:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:with diverging precedents have to interact.  To have precedent, subjects play the weakest-link game
4:78:5891:19:19:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:repeatedly in the first part and the experimenter merges two groups with diverging precedents into
4:79:5989:19:19:72:540:513:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:a larger group in the second part.  This leads to coordination failures as expected.  Subjects can
4:80:6087:19:19:72:540:494:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:decrease these failures by choosing communication with a small fee.  Nevertheless, subjects from
4:81:6183:19:19:72:540:475:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:groups with an efficient precedent in the initial phases do not care about coordination failures and
4:82:6283:19:19:72:205:456:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:choose not to communicate.
4:83:6309:19:19:88:539:437:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:The second one is Blume, Kriss and Weber (2014) in which they look at the effect of endogenous
4:84:6403:19:19:72:540:418:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:and costly two-way pre-play communication on the outcome of a 2x2 stag-hunt game.  They show
4:85:6495:19:19:72:540:399:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:that even small costs dramatically reduce message usage, but efficient coordination of actions occurs
4:86:6596:19:19:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:with high frequency (i.e.  as much as the one that is observed under costless communication).  In
4:87:6693:19:19:72:540:361:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:both  costless  and  costly  communication  treatments  they  asked  subjects  to  send  the  message  of
4:88:6798:19:19:72:540:342:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:which action they would take in the game.  In addition to direct messages similar to theirs, we also
4:89:6898:19:19:72:540:323:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:ask senders to send indirect messages about their risk preferences through which they would signal
4:90:6996:19:19:72:540:304:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:how likely they are to choose Action A or Action B. With this one-way communication (only one
4:91:7089:19:19:72:540:285:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:of the players can send a message) or message, the receiver can indirectly infer the possible action
4:92:7189:19:19:72:169:266:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:choice of the sender.
4:93:7210:19:19:88:539:247:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:To test the effect of such signaling on coordination in stag-hunt games, we design an experiment
4:94:7306:19:16:72:540:228:9:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f13:game.  There is still an ongoing debate about validity and robustness of forward induction as an equilibrium selection
4:95:7424:16:15:72:540:212:9:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f13:criterion.  Although some experiments (Cooper et al., 1989, 1992; van Huyck et al., 1993; Cachon and Camerer 1996;
4:96:7538:15:15:72:540:197:9:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f13:Shahriar  2014)  find  support  for  forward  induction  argument,  some  (Cooper  et  al.,  1993;  Brandts  and  Holt,  1995;
4:97:7664:15:16:72:540:182:9:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f13:Huck and Muller, 2005;  Brandts et al., 2007;  Balkenborg and Nagel, 2008) did not.  The main focus of this study
4:98:7777:16:15:72:540:166:9:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f13:is to understand how costly communication affects the coordination rates depending on the message type.  It is not
4:99:7891:15:9:72:399:151:9:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f13:whether subjects understand and apply forward induction reasoning particularly.
4:100:7970:9:0:84:479:142:6:g_d0_f17:9:g_d0_f13:3They show that this does not hold when both players have the option to send a message though.
5:101:8065:0:19:72:540:722:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:with three stages.  In the first stage, we use a common technique (Holt and Laury, 2002) to elicit
5:102:8163:19:19:72:540:703:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:subjects’ risk aversion.  This technique involves two lotteries:  one risky and one safe.  The riskiness
5:103:8267:19:19:72:540:684:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:of the lotteries is determined by the difference between the high and low payoffs.  There are ten
5:104:8364:19:19:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:different situations and individuals are asked at which situation they want to switch from a ‘safe’
5:105:8463:19:19:72:540:646:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:lottery  to  a  ‘risky’  lottery  (hereafter,  the  situation  at  which  a  subject  switches  from  the  ‘safe’
5:106:8576:19:19:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:lottery to the ‘risky’ lottery is named as her ‘risk threshold’).  At a given situation the probability
5:107:8679:19:19:72:540:608:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:of obtaining the high payoff is identical in both lotteries.  These probabilities range from 1/10 to 1
5:108:8781:19:19:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:in increments of 1/10 between situations.  The expected payoff of the risky lottery becomes higher
5:109:8879:19:19:72:540:570:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:than  the  expected  payoff  of  the  safe  lottery  after  Situation  5.   Depending  on  agents’  being  risk
5:110:8990:19:19:72:540:551:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:loving, risk averse, or risk neutral, they can switch from the safe lottery to the risky lottery before,
5:111:9094:19:19:72:245:532:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:after, or at Situation 5, respectively.
5:112:9133:19:19:88:539:513:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:In the second stage (communication stage), there are four treatments: costless-indirect message,
5:113:9229:19:19:72:540:494:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:costless-direct message, costly-indirect message, and costly-direct message.  At the beginning of this
5:114:9331:19:19:72:540:475:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:stage, the subject group is divided into two:  one group is composed of senders and the other group
5:115:9430:19:19:72:540:456:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:is composed of receivers.  Senders and receivers are matched to play the game in Table 2.  However,
5:116:9529:19:19:72:540:437:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:before  playing  the  game,  in  the  first  (third)  treatment,  senders  are  asked  whether  they  want  to
5:117:9639:19:19:72:540:418:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:send any information to their matches about their choices in the first stage, at no cost (at a cost).
5:118:9740:19:19:72:540:399:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:If  they  want,  senders  were  able  to  send  which  of  the  three  groups  they  belong  to  according  to
5:119:9850:19:19:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:their choices in the first stage.  If a sender switched from Option A to Option B in situations 1,
5:120:9948:19:19:72:540:361:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:2, 3, and 4 in the first stage, she belongs to “Group 1”; if she switched from Option A to Option
5:121:10045:19:19:72:540:342:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:B in situations 5, 6 and 7 in the first stage, she belongs to “Group 2”, and if she switched from
5:122:10142:19:19:72:540:323:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:Option A to Option B in situations 8, 9 and 10 in the first stage, she belongs to “Group 3”.  In the
5:123:10242:19:19:72:540:304:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:second (fourth) treatment, senders are asked to send which action they would choose in the game,
5:124:10338:19:19:72:540:285:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:at no cost (at a cost).  If they want, senders were able to send which action they would choose in
5:125:10436:19:19:72:540:266:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:the game.  Nevertheless, the sender does not need to send true message in any of the treatments.
5:126:10532:19:19:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:When the communication is costly, only the sender bears the cost.  The cost of communication is
5:127:10627:19:31:72:364:228:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:subtracted from the payoffs that belong to sender in Table 2.

6:132:10784:0:19:88:539:722:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:In the third stage, senders and receivers play the game in Table 2 with their matches.  After
6:133:10877:19:19:72:540:703:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:both players tell their action choices, subjects see a feedback screen in which they see their action
6:134:10978:19:19:72:421:684:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:choices, payoffs, sender’s announcement and sender’s true type or action.
6:135:11051:19:19:88:539:665:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:Three  main  insights  emerge  from  the  experiments.   First,  subjects’  message  usage  decreases
6:136:11152:19:19:72:540:646:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:significantly both under direct or indirect message treatments with a cost but a higher decrease
6:137:11248:19:19:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:is  observed  when  the  message  is  indirect.   Second,  we  find  that  although  there  is  no  significant
6:138:11359:19:19:72:540:608:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:effect of costless or costly indirect messages on the frequency of risky actions,  both costless and
6:139:11459:19:19:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:costly direct messages increases the frequency of risky actions significantly.  Third, while we find
6:140:11559:19:19:72:540:570:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:a  significant  increase  in  the  coordination  rate  on  the  payoff-dominant  equilibrium  from  costless
6:141:11667:19:19:72:540:551:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:indirect message treatment to costly indirect message treatment, this rate significantly decreases
6:142:11765:19:19:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:from costless direct-message treatment to costly direct-message treatment.  Our findings show that
6:143:11863:19:19:72:540:513:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:depending on the structure of messages, costly message or communication may increase or decrease
6:144:11959:19:19:72:540:494:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:the  coordination  rates  on  the  payoff-dominant  equilibrium  and  hence  socially  desirable  efficient
6:145:12066:19:19:72:135:475:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:coordination.
6:146:12079:19:19:88:540:456:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:The rest of the paper is organized as follows:Section 2describes the experimental design and
6:147:12171:19:19:72:540:437:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:procedures.   InSection 3,  we  present  the  results  of  our  experiment.   We  close  the  paper  with  a
6:148:12279:19:19:71:540:418:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:discussion and some concluding remarks inSection 4.  All supplementary material, including the
6:149:12373:19:41:72:372:399:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:instructions for the experiment, are presented in theAppendix.
6:150:12435:41:30:72:244:358:14:g_d0_f14:14:g_d0_f14:2  Experimental Design
6:151:12457:30:19:72:540:328:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:The  experiment  was  conducted  at  the  METU-FEAS  Behavioral  and  Experimental  Laboratory
6:152:12551:19:19:72:540:309:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:(BEL) at the Middle East Technical University (METU). Subjects were recruited by e-mail using
6:153:12644:19:19:72:540:290:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:the  BEL  database,  which  consists  of  undergraduate  students  at  METU.  Overall,  240  subjects
6:154:12745:19:19:72:540:271:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:participated in the experiment.  The data coming from 144 subjects is taken from B ̈uy ̈ukboyacı
6:155:12841:19:19:72:540:252:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:and  K ̈u ̧c ̈uk ̧senel  (2016).   There  were  twenty  sessions  and  each  lasted  45  minutes.   Each  subject
6:156:12954:19:19:72:540:233:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:participated in only one session.  All sessions were computerized using z-tree (Fischbacher, 2007).
6:157:13053:19:19:72:540:214:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:Throughout the experiment, payoffs were described in terms of “tokens”.  100 tokens corresponded
6:158:13149:19:19:72:539:195:11:g_d0_f11:8:g_d0_f15:to one Turkish lira.  A subject earned 15.24 TL on average, including a 5 TL participation fee.4
6:159:13245:19:16:72:523:176:11:g_d0_f11:8:g_d0_f15:The experiment for the baseline consisted of two stages and the treatments were three stages.5
6:160:13339:16:12:84:393:160:6:g_d0_f17:9:g_d0_f13:4As of January 2016, the minimum wage rate is 8.13 TL per hour in Turkey.
6:161:13412:12:19:84:539:148:6:g_d0_f17:9:g_d0_f13:5The  instructions  in  a  session  were  read  in  two  groups:  First,  the  instructions  for  the  first  stage  is  read  then
6:162:13543:19:0:72:540:129:9:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f13:instructions for the second and the third stage were read together.  Full instructions for the stages of costly indirect-
7:163:13665:0:19:88:539:722:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:In the first stage, we elicite the risk attitude of each subject by Holt and Laury’s (2002) method.
7:164:13764:19:19:72:540:703:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:According  to  this  method,  subjects  must  choose  one  of  two  lotteries  available  for  ten  different
7:165:13873:19:19:72:539:684:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:situations (Figure 1 in Appendix A).6In Situation 1, the less-risky lottery (Option A) has a higher
7:166:13972:19:19:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:expected payoff than the more-risky one (Option B). Hence, only very strong risk lovers pick Option
7:167:14071:19:19:72:540:646:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:B  in  this  situation.   Moving  further  down  the  table  in  Figure  1,  the  expected  payoff  difference
7:168:14181:19:19:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:between  the  lotteries  in  Option  A  and  in  Option  B  decreases  and  eventually  turns  negative  in
7:169:14288:19:19:72:540:608:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:Situation 5.  In Situation 10, all subjects must choose between a sure payoff of 400 tokens (Option
7:170:14387:19:19:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:A) and a sure payoff of 770 tokens (Option B). Since all rational individuals prefer the latter one
7:171:14486:19:19:72:540:570:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:in the last situation, by then all subjects should have switched from Option A to Option B. In this
7:172:14585:19:19:72:540:551:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:experiment,  a consistent subject should switch from Option A to Option B just once.  However,
7:173:14679:19:19:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:earlier experiments using Holt and Laury’s (2002) method showed that some subjects may go back
7:174:14773:19:19:72:540:513:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:and forth between Option A and Option B. To prevent such behavior in our experiment, we asked
7:175:14866:19:19:72:388:494:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:subjects when they wanted to switch from Option A to Option B.
7:176:14928:19:19:88:539:475:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:The payoffs for the lottery choices in the experiment were selected so that the point at which
7:177:15022:19:19:72:540:456:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:they switched from Option A to Option B, would provide an interval estimate of a subject’s constant
7:178:15121:19:19:72:540:437:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:relative risk aversion (CRRA). With these payoffs, it is optimal for a risk-neutral subject to switch
7:179:15222:19:19:72:540:418:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:from Option A to Option B in Situation 5.  Similarly, it is optimal for a risk-averse (risk-loving)
7:180:15321:19:19:72:540:399:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:subject to switch from Option A to Option B after (before) Situation 5.  The payment for this stage
7:181:15420:19:19:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:was determined according to a randomly chosen row among these ten situations and the subject’s
7:182:15514:19:19:72:540:361:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:lottery choice in that particular row.  Subjects learned their earnings from this stage at the end of
7:183:15615:19:19:72:147:342:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:the experiment.
7:184:15630:19:19:88:539:323:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:The second stage differs according to the treatment. There are five treatments in our experiment:
7:185:15727:19:19:72:540:304:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:baseline, costless indirect message, costless direct message, costly indirect message, and costly direct
7:186:15831:19:19:72:540:285:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:message.7In the baseline (No Communication) treatment, subjects play the game in Table 2 for
7:187:15923:19:19:72:540:266:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:twelve periods with re-matching after every period.  Each period, participants are anonymously and
7:188:16021:19:19:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:randomly re-matched, play the one-shot game, and see the results of that period.  In every period
7:189:16118:19:19:72:540:228:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:after the first, players see their own choice, opponent’s choice and resulting outcome, but do not
7:190:16216:19:19:72:333:209:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:know the identity or history of their current opponent.
7:191:16271:19:9:72:309:190:9:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f13:message signalling treatment can be found in Appendix A.
7:192:16327:9:19:84:539:181:6:g_d0_f17:9:g_d0_f13:6The first stage to elicit risk attitute of each subject in all treatments is identical to B ̈uy ̈ukboyacı and K ̈u ̧c ̈uk ̧senel
7:193:16456:19:8:72:100:162:9:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f13:(2016).
7:194:16463:8:20:84:539:154:6:g_d0_f17:9:g_d0_f13:7The  baseline  treatment,  costless  indirect  message,  and  costless  direct  message  treatments  are  identical  to
7:195:16583:20:0:72:222:134:9:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f13:B ̈uy ̈ukboyacı and K ̈u ̧c ̈uk ̧senel (2016).
8:196:16630:0:19:88:539:722:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:In costless indirect message (Costless Type-Message) treatment the subject group was divided
8:197:16722:19:19:72:540:703:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:into two:  senders and receivers.  In each period, before playing the game in Table 2, senders had
8:198:16820:19:19:72:540:684:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:the option of not sending a message or sending a message about their choices in the first stage.  If
8:199:16920:19:19:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:they wanted to send a message, they were able to send which of the three groups they belong to
8:200:17014:19:19:72:540:646:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:according to their choices in the first stage.  If a sender switched from Option A to Option B in
8:201:17111:19:19:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:situations 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the first stage, she was actually in “Group 1”, risk-loving group; if she
8:202:17213:19:19:72:540:608:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:switched from Option A to Option B in situations 5, 6 and 7 in the first stage, she was actually in
8:203:17312:19:19:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:“Group 2”, medium risk-averse group, and if she switched from Option A to Option B in situations
8:204:17408:19:19:72:540:570:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:8, 9 and 10 in the first stage, she was actually in “Group 3”, high risk-averse group.  The senders
8:205:17507:19:19:72:540:551:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:and receivers were told that senders did not need to send true message about which group they
8:206:17600:19:19:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:actually belonged.  Either the message sent or not, subjects played the game in Table 2 in the third
8:207:17700:19:19:72:540:513:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:stage.  Subjects repeated the described game 12 periods with new matches by keeping their roles
8:208:17795:19:19:72:492:494:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:during the whole session.  A subject remained as a sender or receiver in a whole session.
8:209:17884:19:19:88:539:475:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:In costless direct message (Costless Action-Message) treatment the subject group was divided
8:210:17976:19:19:72:540:456:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:into two:  one group was composed of senders and the other group was composed receivers.  In each
8:211:18073:19:19:72:540:437:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:period,  before playing the game in Table 2,  senders had the option of not sending a message or

8:216:18568:19:19:72:540:342:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:subjects played the game in Table 2 in the third stage.  Subjects repeated the described game 12

9:242:20628:19:19:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:particular, we expect high coordination rates both in Costly-Type and Costly-Action treatments.

9:247:21132:19:19:72:405:310:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:effect on coordination rates according to forward induction argument.

10:271:23446:19:19:72:540:456:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:Blume, Kriss and Weber (2014), we found that message usage decreases significantly (the first two
10:272:23543:19:19:72:540:437:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:rows of Table 6) when the messages are costly.  However, unlike them we observe that this decrease
10:273:23641:19:19:72:540:418:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:in the message usage did not affect the risky action frequency as predicted for both costly Type or

10:275:23837:19:31:72:410:380:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:and it is observed that this reasoning depends on the message content.

11:289:24741:19:19:72:540:703:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:of thinking.  Subjects should first figure out that sending a message and choosing Action A is a

12:340:27760:36:19:88:539:269:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:Table 6  shows how  the frequency  of messages  and given  the  message,  the  frequency of risky
12:341:27857:19:19:72:540:250:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:actions by senders change in the Type- and Action-Message treatments when the message is costly
12:342:27952:19:19:72:540:231:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:or costless.  Subjects chose to send messages in Action-Message treatment significantly more fre-
12:343:28049:19:19:72:539:212:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:quently than Type-Message treatment when the messages are costless (92% and 80%,respectively)
12:344:28142:19:19:72:540:193:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:and  costly  (55%  and  10%,respectively).11The  message  cost  lead  to  a  significant  drop  in  sent
12:345:28246:19:15:71:539:174:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:messages in either treatment but a much higher drop in Type-Message treatment.  This may be due
12:346:28341:15:19:80:539:159:6:g_d0_f17:9:g_d0_f13:10We do not run a regression with action data due to high collinearity between treatment variable and dependent
12:347:28452:19:8:72:186:140:9:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f13:variable, risky action choice.

13:349:28527:0:19:72:539:722:11:g_d0_f11:8:g_d0_f15:to the fact that subjects believe the effect of their messages more, in Action-Message Treatment.12
13:350:28626:19:19:72:540:703:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:Given subjects send no message, while the percentages of senders and receivers choosing the risky
13:351:28723:19:19:72:540:684:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:action are similar under Type-Message treatment and the percentages of senders choosing the risky
13:352:28820:19:19:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:action are similar under Action-Message treatment when the messages are costless or costly, the
13:353:28915:19:19:72:540:646:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:percentage of receivers choosing the risky action under Action-Message treatment is significantly
13:354:29012:19:19:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:higher when the messages (42%) are costly than they are costless (15%).  Meaning that, receivers
13:355:29108:19:19:72:540:608:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:expect to receive a message to choose the risky action in costless Action-Message treatment, they
13:356:29205:19:19:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:do not expect that in costly Action-Message treatment.  According to Ben-Porath and Dekel (1992),
13:357:29302:19:19:72:540:570:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:if one of the players has the option to send a costly message, playing the efficient action without
13:358:29401:19:19:72:540:551:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:sending a message is the equilibrium.  This result should hold independent of the message content.
13:359:29499:19:19:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:Nevertheless, neither in Type-Message treatment nor in Action-Message treatment, when the mes-
13:360:29593:19:19:72:540:513:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:sages are costly and senders do not send messages, neither senders nor receivers choose the risky
13:361:29690:19:19:72:237:494:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:action more than 42% of the time.
13:362:29723:19:19:88:539:475:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:In Type-Message treatment, subjects in the sender role send most messages by saying that they
13:363:29816:19:19:72:540:456:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:belong to Group 1, risk-loving group, (7%) if they choose to send a message.  Given they sent such
13:364:29914:19:19:72:540:437:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:a message, 84% of senders and 58% of receivers chose the Action B (Risky Action).  The difference
13:365:30011:19:19:72:540:418:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:between the percentages for senders and receivers may stem from the fact that receivers cannot put
13:366:30109:19:19:72:540:399:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:themselves into senders’ shoes.  In other words, they may not be able to understand the strategic
13:367:30206:19:19:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:motivation of senders through such a message.  Compared to costless type message treatment, the
13:368:30301:19:19:72:540:361:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:percentage of senders choosing the risky action may be higher when the message is costly since the
13:369:30399:19:19:72:540:342:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:senders pay a cost for the message they may think more throughly while sending the message and
13:370:30493:19:19:72:217:323:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:choosing an action afterwards.
13:371:30523:19:19:88:539:304:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:Although sending a costly Action A message is a strictly dominated strategy13, the percentage of
13:372:30619:19:19:72:539:285:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:subjects sending Action A messages is 14%.14Given using a dominated strategy, Action A message,
13:373:30714:19:19:71:539:266:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:18% of the senders chose Action B (Risky Action) by increasing their chance for a coordination
13:374:30808:19:16:71:540:247:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:failure and guaranteeing 0 token.15The frequency of sending Action A message is similar when the
13:375:30904:16:19:80:539:231:6:g_d0_f17:9:g_d0_f13:12One  may  expect  a  higher  usage  of  costly  messages  when  the  message  is  indirect  to  increase  credibility  of  the
13:376:31032:19:8:72:107:212:9:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f13:message.
13:377:31040:8:19:80:539:204:6:g_d0_f17:9:g_d0_f13:13This  is  because  a  subject  can  earn  570  tokens  (5.7  TL)  by  choosing  the  safe  action  without  sending  a  costly
13:378:31168:19:9:72:107:185:9:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f13:message.
13:379:31176:9:19:80:539:176:6:g_d0_f17:9:g_d0_f13:14Rational subjects would not choose a strictly dominated strategy.  Subjects usually avoid dominated strategies
13:380:31288:19:8:72:331:157:9:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f13:with frequencies greater than 90% of the time (Crawford, 1997).
13:381:31351:8:20:80:539:149:6:g_d0_f17:9:g_d0_f13:15According to questionnaire data, some subjects thought that cheating their partner is the aim of the game, hence
13:382:31465:20:0:72:316:129:9:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f13:they chose actions that contradict with their announcement.
14:383:31526:0:19:72:540:722:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:message is costless or costly. The percentage of subjects who chose to send Action B (Risky Action)
14:384:31625:19:19:72:540:703:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:message in Action-Message treatment is quite high (80%) when the message is costless.  Further,
14:385:31720:19:19:72:540:684:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:among those senders, i.e., sending Action B message chose the risky action 80% of the time and
14:386:31814:19:19:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:receivers receiving this message chose the risky action 88% of the time.  The percentage of subjects
14:387:31914:19:19:72:540:646:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:who chose to send Action B (Risky Action) message in Costly Action-Message treatment drops to
14:388:32007:19:19:72:496:627:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:41%.  Among these senders (receivers) 84% (83%) of them chose Action B (risky action).
14:389:32093:19:19:88:539:608:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:An agent should expect the likelihood of risky action should decrease as his opponent is more
14:390:32186:19:19:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:risk averse.  Further, he should think that his message creates a similar effect on his opponent.  As
14:391:32287:19:19:72:540:570:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:a result, we expect the frequency of risky action choice to decrease as the sender sends a message
14:392:32385:19:19:72:540:551:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:saying he belongs to a higher risk group.  Similarly for the receiver,  we expect the frequency of
14:393:32483:19:19:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:risky action choice to decrease as the receiver receives a message saying his opponent belongs to a
14:394:32582:19:19:72:540:513:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:higher risk group.  As seen in Table 6, although this prediction does not hold when the messages
14:395:32678:19:50:72:321:494:11:g_d0_f11:8:g_d0_f15:are costless, it holds when the messages are costly.16
14:396:32732:50:30:72:173:444:14:g_d0_f14:14:g_d0_f14:4  Conclusion
14:397:32745:30:19:72:540:414:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:We  report  experimental  results  of  a  stag-hunt  game  related  to  coordination  rates  with  one-way
14:398:32851:19:19:72:540:395:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:costly or costless pre-play communication. According to our findings, subjects do not follow forward
14:399:32951:19:19:72:540:376:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:induction reasoning, i.e., eventhough the message cost decreases the sent message rates the subjects
14:400:33051:19:19:72:540:357:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:do not choose the risky action in the subgame.  Nevertheless, we find that depending on the message
14:401:33150:19:18:72:540:338:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:type (whether it is direct or indirect), message cost can help subjects to coordinate more often on
14:402:33249:18:19:72:540:320:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:the  payoff-dominant  equilibrium.   In  particular,  when  the  message  is  indirect  (direct),  subjects
14:403:33356:19:19:72:540:301:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:coordinate on the payoff-dominant equilibrium more (less) often under costly message than costless

16:447:36623:64:30:72:261:480:14:g_d0_f14:14:g_d0_f14:5  Appendix: Instructions
16:448:36648:30:19:72:361:450:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:Welcome and thank you for participating in our experiment.
16:449:36706:19:19:88:539:431:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:We will read the instructions together.  Please do not touch the keyboard for now and listen to
16:450:36801:19:19:72:202:412:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:these instructions carefully.
16:451:36830:19:19:88:539:393:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:This is an experiment about economic decision making.  All participants will earn some money
16:452:36922:19:19:72:540:374:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:during the experiment. The money you earn might be different from the other participants earnings.
16:453:37020:19:19:72:540:355:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:This amount is dependent on your decisions as well as the decisions of other participants.  Please
16:454:37118:19:19:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:do not talk with each other during the experiment.  We will have to terminate the experiment if
16:455:37213:19:19:72:540:317:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:you violate this rule.  We will now describe the experimental procedures.  It is very important that
16:456:37313:19:19:72:435:298:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:you understand all the parts.  Please raise your hand if you have a question.
16:457:37390:19:18:88:539:279:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:There will be two parts in our experiment.  You will learn about these parts right before they
16:458:37484:18:19:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:start.  Your aim in both parts is to earn as much money as possible.  At the end of the experiment,
16:459:37583:19:19:72:540:242:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:you will learn about your total earnings from each part.  Your earnings will be in tokens.  100 tokens
16:460:37685:19:19:72:540:223:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:= 1 TL. Your total earnings will be rounded to the nearest 25 kurus.  In addition to your earnings
16:461:37783:19:19:72:361:204:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:in the experiment, you will be paid a 5 TL participation fee.
16:462:37844:19:19:88:133:185:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:PART 1
16:463:37850:19:19:88:539:166:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:You will see a table something like this in stage 1.  In this part, you will face 10 different rows.
16:464:37950:19:19:88:539:147:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:fhFU6.7594in2.9014in0ptInstructions Part 1risk.gifEach row provides two options, Option A and
16:465:38043:19:0:72:540:128:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:Option B. You will slide the bar in the middle to show which option you chose for that situation.
17:466:38142:0:19:72:540:722:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:These options are basically lotteries that indicate your chances of winning a certain payoff.  For
17:467:38240:19:19:72:540:703:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:each row, you will be asked to choose one among option A and option B. If you choose Option B
17:468:38333:19:19:72:413:684:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:for one row, you will have to choose this option for the remaining rows.
17:469:38405:19:19:88:539:665:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:For instance, consider row 1.  In Row 1 Option A offers 400 tokens with probability 1/10 and
17:470:38497:19:19:72:540:646:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:320 tokens with probability 9/10.  In Row 1 Option B offers 770 tokens with probability 1/10 and
17:471:38593:19:19:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:20 tokens with probability 9/10.  Your earnings from this part will be determined as follows:  First
17:472:38693:19:19:72:540:608:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:the system will pick a number between 1 and 10.  This number will tell us the row that will be used
17:473:38792:19:19:72:283:589:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:in determining your earnings from this part.
17:474:38836:19:19:88:539:570:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:Suppose  that  this  number  turns  out  to  be  7  and  that  you  have  chosen  option  A  for  row  7.
17:475:38941:19:19:72:540:551:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:The system will choose another number between 1 and 10.  If this number is 7 or smaller (with
17:476:39034:19:19:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:probability 7/10 ), you will earn 400 tokens.  If this number is 8 or larger (with probability 3/10 ),
17:477:39136:19:31:72:191:513:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:you will earn 320 tokens.
17:478:39161:31:19:88:133:482:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:PART 2
17:479:39167:19:19:88:539:463:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:You will be grouped into three according to your choices in the first stage: Group 1: You belong
17:480:39263:19:19:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:to this group if you have switched from Option A to Option B in situations 1,  2,  3,  or 4 in the
17:481:39361:19:19:72:540:425:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:first stage, Group 2:  You belong to this group if you have switched from Option A to Option B in
17:482:39458:19:19:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:situations 5, 6, or 7 in the first stage, Group 3:  You belong to this group if you have switched from
17:483:39560:19:19:72:379:387:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:Option A to Option B in situations 8, 9, or 10 in the first stage.
17:484:39626:19:19:88:539:368:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:In this stage, there will be 12 periods that are similar to each other.  In each period some of
17:485:39721:19:19:72:540:349:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:you will be a sender; some of you will be a receiver.  Each of you will keep your roles as sender or
17:486:39821:19:19:72:540:330:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:receiver during the experiment.  On the top of the screen you can see whether you will be sender
17:487:39917:19:19:72:540:311:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:or receiver during the whole stage.  In each period senders will be matched to receivers randomly.
17:488:40015:19:19:72:431:292:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:You will not be informed about whom you were matched with at any time.
17:489:40085:19:19:88:539:273:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:Senders can send one of the following messages before playing the game:  “I belong to Group
17:490:40176:19:19:72:540:254:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:1”; “I belong to Group 2”; “I belong to Group 3” or “I do not want to send a message.” Senders
17:491:40270:19:19:72:540:235:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:are allowed to send any message they want regardless of in which group they are.  If senders choose
17:492:40369:19:19:72:540:216:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:to send a message, they play the first game matrix, if they choose not to send a message, they play
17:493:40468:19:28:72:465:197:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:the second game matrix, where row player is sender and column player is receiver:

18:501:40771:19:19:72:540:703:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:described game when a sender did not send a message:  If both you and the other person chose
18:502:40863:19:19:72:540:684:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:Action  A,  both  of  you  will  earn  570  tokens.   If  you  chose  Action  A  but  the  other  person  chose
18:503:40974:19:19:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:Action B; then you will earn 570 tokens and the other person will earn 70 tokens.  If you chose
18:504:41069:19:19:72:540:646:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:Action B but the other person chose Action A; then you will earn 70 tokens and the other person
18:505:41164:19:19:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:will earn 570 tokens.  If both you and the other person chose Action B, both of you will earn 770
18:506:41261:19:19:72:105:608:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:tokens.
18:507:41268:19:19:88:539:589:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:Your  and  other  person’s  period  earnings  will  be  determined  by  the  actions  you  chose  in  the
18:508:41373:19:19:72:540:570:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:described game when a sender sent a message:  If both the sender and the receiver chose Action A,
18:509:41470:19:19:72:540:551:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:the sender will earn 500 tokens and the receiver will earn 570 tokens.  If the sender chose Action A
18:510:41570:19:19:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:but the receiver chose Action B; then the sender will earn 500 tokens and the receiver will earn 70
18:511:41669:19:19:72:540:513:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:tokens.  If the sender chose Action B but the receiver chose Action A; then you will earn 0 tokens
18:512:41767:19:19:72:540:494:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:and the receiver will earn 570 tokens.  If both the sender and the receiver chose Action B, the sender
18:513:41869:19:19:72:349:475:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:will earn 700 tokens and the receiver will earn 770 tokens.
18:514:41928:19:19:88:539:456:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:You will see the following information on the screen after you made your action choices.  Your
18:515:42022:19:19:72:540:437:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:and the other person’s action choices, the announcement made by senders and which group actually
18:516:42118:19:19:72:290:418:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:s/he belongs to, your earnings at that period.
18:517:42164:19:19:88:539:399:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:Then you will start new period as explained and will be matched someone else in the new period.
18:518:42259:19:19:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:At the end of the experiment, one of 12 periods will be drawn and your earnings at that period
18:519:42353:19:19:72:540:361:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:will be counted as your earnings from the second stage.  Since each period has an equal chance in
18:520:42450:19:0:72:380:342:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:drawing, you should make your decision in each period carefully.
