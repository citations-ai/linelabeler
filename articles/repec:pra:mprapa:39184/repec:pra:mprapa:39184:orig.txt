2:23:508:12:11:70:524:623:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:The  paper  undertakes  a  detailed  examination  of  the special  economic  zone  programme  in  Poland  in 
2:24:617:11:12:70:524:612:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:the  field  of  regional  and  industrial  policy.  The  programme  was  implemented  in  1995-1997  and 
2:25:722:12:11:70:523:600:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:nowadays  in  Poland  operate  14  special  economic  zones  established  in  the  purpose  of  acceleration 
2:26:831:11:12:70:524:589:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:economic  development  in  chosen  regions.  The  main  method  for  attracting  capital  and  technology  is 
2:27:941:12:11:70:524:577:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:the preferential tax policy (long term income tax exemptions) for specific domains of economic activity. 
2:28:1046:11:12:70:524:566:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:The   research   allowed   to   evaluate   results   of   zones   activity   especially   related   to   the   regional 
2:29:1166:12:11:70:524:554:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:development  and  industrial  restructurisation  process.  There  are  clear  evidence  of  both  positive 
2:30:1273:11:12:70:524:543:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:(development  of  modern  industry  branches)  and  negative  effects  (economic  activity  substitution)  of 
2:31:1383:12:11:70:524:531:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:special  economic  zone  programme  in  Poland.  Attention  then  turns  to  the  Polish  integration  with  the 
2:32:1496:11:12:70:524:520:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:European  Union  in  the  field  of  competitiveness  policy,  where  several  problems  related  to  special 
2:33:1606:12:13:70:209:508:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:economic zones had occurred.

2:35:1635:14:13:70:143:481:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Introduction 
2:36:1648:13:14:70:73:468:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7: 
2:37:1648:14:14:70:524:454:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The  idea  of  privileged  area  called  Free  Trade  Zone,  Export  Processing  Zone  or 
2:38:1738:14:14:70:524:440:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Special  Economic  Zone1  was  very  popular  in  the  world  from  the  1970’s  to  1990’s. 
2:39:1831:14:14:70:524:426:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:According  to  the  International  Labour  Organisation 850  zones  were  in  operation 
2:40:1919:14:13:70:524:412:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:around  the  world  and  total  employment  exceeded  of  27  million  workers  in  1997 
2:41:2008:13:14:70:524:399:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:(ILO 1997). In comparison to data of World Bank from 1990, when 86 zones existed 
2:42:2089:14:14:70:524:385:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:and  employment  was  less  than  0,5  mln  workers  (World  Bank  1992),  it  means  rapid 
2:43:2181:14:14:70:524:371:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:spread  of  the  instrument  in  the  world,  especially  in  developing  countries.  Not 
2:44:2271:14:14:70:524:357:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:surprisingly,  the  idea  found  supporters  in  Central and  Eastern  European  Countries 
2:45:2362:14:13:70:524:343:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:(UNTC,  1991),  although  some  evidence  of  negative  aspects  of  zones  functioning 
2:46:2450:13:14:70:524:330:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:were known (Barry, Craig  1992; World Bank 1992) and the European Union gradually 
2:47:2532:14:14:70:524:316:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:increased  impact  on  Member  States  to  close  such  to avoid  distortion  in  economic 
2:48:2623:14:14:70:524:302:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:competition (Munko,1998). At the same time the transformation of the Polish political 
2:49:2709:14:14:70:524:288:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:system  in  1989,  started  the  process  of  adjustment  of  social  and  economical 
2:50:2795:14:13:70:524:274:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:structures   to   the   principles   of   the   market   economy.   The   effectiveness   of 
2:51:2888:13:14:70:524:261:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:transformation  process  was  characterised  by  a  significant  spatial  differentiation 
2:52:2978:14:14:70:524:247:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:(Domanski,  1998).  Some  regions  adjusted  to  the  new economic  conditions  without 
2:53:3066:14:14:70:524:233:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:noticeable  difficulties,  but  in  others  the  concentration  of  negative  effects  occurred. 
2:54:3163:14:14:70:524:219:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The scale of the problem made it impossible for the local authorities to find a solution, 
2:55:3253:14:13:70:524:205:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:therefore  some  assistance  from  the  state  turned  out  to  be  necessary,  expressed 
2:56:3343:13:14:70:524:192:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:among others things through the Special Economic Zones Act passed by Parliament 
2:57:3423:14:24:70:186:178:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:on October 20, 1994.

2:59:3487:7:17:70:524:147:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:1 The terminology  is extraordinarily  diverse. There are  curently at least 20 different terms to describe 
2:60:3595:17:11:70:524:130:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:privileged areas. The archetype of export processing zones is the Shannon Free Zone established in 
2:61:3694:11:12:70:524:119:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:1959  in  Ireland.  The  original  concept  of  export  processing  zone  was  a  territorial  enclave  in  which 
2:62:3808:12:11:70:524:107:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:foreign investors benefiting from special incentives and privileges, produce industrial goods for export 
2:63:3913:11:12:70:524:96:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:(UNCTC  1991).  Gradually,  the  above  mentioned  restriction  was  lessened:  domestic  investors  might 
2:64:4020:12:11:70:524:84:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:run  a  business  in  zones,  export  of  goods  is  not  obligatory  and  other  types  of  economic  activites  are 
2:65:4138:11:0:70:284:73:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:allowed (Bazydlo, Smetkowski 2000B).

3:68:4224:14:14:70:524:732:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:According  to  the  Polish  Special  Economic  Zone  Act  a  zone  is  a  separate  and  not 
3:69:4317:14:14:70:524:718:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:inhabited  part  of  Polish  territory,  where  firms,  after  obtaining  a  licence  (permission), 
3:70:4417:14:13:70:524:704:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:can settle their business, and after fulfilling the criteria mentioned in the Act, receive 
3:71:4508:13:14:70:524:691:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:full  or  part  income  tax  exemptions.  The  purpose  of the  establishment  of  a  special 
3:72:4602:14:14:70:524:677:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:economic  zone  is  to  accelerate  economic  development  in  a  part  of  the  country 
3:73:4691:14:14:70:524:663:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:(mainly owing to external strategic investors) particularly by the realisation one of the 
3:74:4781:14:14:70:123:649:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:following: 
3:75:4792:14:13:70:360:635:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f7:-    development of a certain field of economic activity, 
3:76:4850:13:14:70:509:622:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f7:-    development of new technological solutions and their use in national economy, 
3:77:4933:14:14:70:213:608:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f7:-    development of export, 
3:78:4961:14:14:70:382:594:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f7:-    increasing competitiveness of production and services, 
3:79:5021:14:14:70:459:580:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f7:-    making use of already existing industrial and economic infrastructure, 
3:80:5097:14:13:70:188:566:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f7:-    creating new jobs, 
3:81:5121:13:14:70:460:553:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f7:-    making use of natural resources with respect to natural environment.  
3:82:5196:14:14:70:524:539:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The  formulation  of  special  economic  zones’  objectives  suggested  that  the  zones 
3:83:5285:14:14:70:524:525:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:should be, on the one hand, an instrument of industrial policy and, on the other hand, 
3:84:5372:14:14:70:523:511:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:a  significant  instrument  of  regional  policy.  The  main  objectives  of  the  zones  are  to 
3:85:5470:14:13:70:524:497:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:restructure  the  old  industrial  regions,  to  activate  lagging  regions,  to  do  productive 
3:86:5567:13:14:70:524:484:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:research  and  scientific  potential  and  to  make  use  of  already  existing  industrial 
3:87:5659:14:20:70:167:470:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:infrastructure.

3:90:5693:14:13:70:524:422:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The main incentive to run business activity in zones is tax relief. Originally income of 
3:91:5782:13:14:70:524:409:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:enterprises which operate in zones was exempt of income tax within a half period of 
3:92:5866:14:14:70:524:395:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the zone’s activity and than in part not over 50% (zones were initially established for 
3:93:5954:14:14:70:524:381:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the period of 20 years with the exception of technoparks where the entire period is 12 
3:94:6041:14:14:70:524:367:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:years).  After  latest  amendments  of  the  Act,  tax  exemptions  cannot  exceed  50%  of 
3:95:6133:14:13:70:524:353:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:invested capital or 65% in case of SME2. All kinds of tax relief are made dependent 
3:96:6217:13:14:70:524:340:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:upon the defined amount of the capital invested or upon the number of jobs created 
3:97:6300:14:14:70:524:326:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:(both  values  are  mentioned  in  the  decree  establishing  the  zone3).  In  case  of 
3:98:6389:14:14:70:524:312:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:companies  which  are  not  allowed  to  benefit  from  income  tax  exemptions  the 
3:99:6474:14:14:70:524:298:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:preferences  consist  of  the  possibility  to  account  capital  investments  to  the  cost  of 
3:100:6571:14:13:70:524:284:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:earning income and the possibility to increase the fixed assets depreciation. Besides,

3:110:7164:17:8:70:257:127:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:passed by Parliament on June 30, 2000.   
3:111:7205:8:17:70:527:119:8:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f7:3 In majority of Polish special  economic  zones to receive full tax exemptions  it  is  necessary to invest 
3:112:7313:17:7:70:301:102:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:over 2 mln EURO or to create at least 100 new jobs

4:143:8485:20:14:70:523:239:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:In the assumptions to the Polish special economic zone programme it was stated that 
4:144:8569:14:14:70:524:225:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:all zones, in the area of over 6 000 hectares (which is about 2% of Polish industrial 
4:145:8655:14:13:70:524:211:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:area),  will  create  a  total  of  175  000  jobs  –  that  correspond  with  about  5%  of  all 
4:146:8753:13:14:70:524:198:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:industrial workers in Poland. The plan should be realised in a long-term (10-15 years) 
4:147:8840:14:14:70:523:184:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:perspective. Table 1 presents the realisation of assumptions in December 2001, after 
4:148:8925:14:20:70:441:170:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:5 years of establishment the first zone and 4 years of majority of rest. 
4:149:8998:20:14:70:524:150:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Till December 2001, all existing zones are operating. About 685 licences have been

6:280:13295:20:13:70:524:428:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:According to the survey the best results were achieved by Mielecka SEZ8. The zone 
6:281:13377:13:14:70:524:415:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:contributed  to  a  significant  reduction  of  unemployment  level  in  the  region  and 
6:282:13467:14:14:70:527:401:12:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f11:simultaneously   to   the   activation   of   the   local   economy.   The   Katowicka   SEZ9 
6:283:13560:14:15:70:524:387:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:contributed to great inflow of capital and, therefore, to creation many new jobs in the 
6:284:13648:15:7:70:217:372:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:                                            
6:285:13691:7:16:70:524:365:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:8 The survey proved that the zone has a positive influence on the local labour market and contributes 
6:286:13793:16:12:70:524:349:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:to  decrease  in  unemployment  level  in  Mielec  below  the  national  average  i.e.  11,6%.  Moreover, 
6:287:13899:12:11:70:524:337:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:economic activity within the zone contributed to the activation of all the region, mainly due to dynamic 
6:288:14004:11:12:70:524:326:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:development of the service sector: construction projects, security, staff training, finance intermediation, 
6:289:14112:12:11:70:524:314:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:hotels  and  restaurants  and  others.  Beside  this,  the  zone  co-operates  with  the  local  Enterprise  Park 
6:290:14226:11:12:70:524:303:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:(after  two  years,  companies  from  the  park  can  move to  the  zone).  There  are  also  strong  linkages 
6:291:14337:12:11:70:527:291:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:between firms from the zone and other regional firms. All this makes the zone a positive example of a 
6:292:14439:11:7:70:144:280:10:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:favoured area.  
6:293:14453:7:16:70:524:273:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:9 On the basis of the survey, it is difficult to evaluate the role of the zone in economic development and 
6:294:14560:16:12:70:526:257:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:structural  changes  of  the  region.  The  positive  aspect  is  the  creation  of  many  new  jobs,  especially  in 
6:295:14678:12:11:70:524:245:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:comparison to the coal mines liquidation. Nevertheless, it seems that the jobs created in the zone will 
6:296:14782:11:12:70:524:234:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:not  attract  the  ex-mineworkers,  steelworkers  and  the  graduates  of  the  professional  education.  For 
6:297:14892:12:11:70:523:222:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:example  from  1400  of  General  Motors  employee  only  20%  worked  before  in  heavy  industry  and  in 
6:298:15000:11:12:70:524:211:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:addition large part of them was administrative staff and engineers. The unemployed made only 3% of 
6:299:15099:12:11:70:527:199:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:the  total  employee  number  in  the  General  Motors  factory.  So  the  zone  to  significant  extent,  attracted 
6:300:15216:11:12:70:526:188:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:human resources which could find a job outside the zone and, therefore, support process of structural 
6:301:15318:12:11:70:524:176:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:changes.  There  was  a  similar  situation  in  the  field  of  zone's  function  in  space.  Particular  subzones 
6:302:15434:11:12:70:524:165:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:were  situated  on  the  outskirts  of  Upper  Silesian  Industrial  District.  For  investors  the  most  attractive 
6:303:15552:12:11:70:524:153:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:areas of the zone were those softly touched by negative industrial effects: the subzones in Gliwice and 
6:304:15656:11:12:70:524:142:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:Tychy.  On  the  contrary,  in  the  other  two  subzones, which  have  typical  problems  related  to  mining 
6:305:15767:12:11:70:524:130:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:monoculture, investments were smaller. Although the general technological level of firms was high, the 
6:306:15869:11:12:70:523:119:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:activity  concerning  attracting  modern,  competitive technology  stays  up  to  now  only  in  plans.  The 
6:307:15978:12:11:70:524:107:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:problem  is  also  the  lack  of  wide  co-operation  between  regional  research  and  science  institutes  and 
6:308:16091:11:12:70:524:96:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:firms   in   the   zone.   Creation   of   such   linkages   would provide   positive   effects   and   increase 
6:309:16204:12:11:70:524:84:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:competitiveness of regional firms and, therefore, might transform the zone into an effective instrument 
6:310:16308:11:0:70:264:73:10:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:supporting regional and local development. 
7:311:16351:0:14:70:524:760:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:region,  but  probably  the  results  of  zone  activities  within  the  context  of    the  region 
7:312:16451:14:14:70:524:746:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:restructuring, would be much lower than in the Mielecka SEZ case. Moreover, some 
7:313:16532:14:14:70:523:732:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:negative consequences of zone establishment have occurred (for example attraction 
7:314:16614:14:14:70:524:718:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of high-educated staff, which is also necessary to restructure existing heavy industry 
7:315:16701:14:13:70:524:704:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:and occupation of the most attractive areas of the region situated on the periphery of 
7:316:16788:13:14:70:524:691:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Upper Silesian conurbation). In case of Suwalska SEZ10, which attracts mainly small 
7:317:16872:14:14:70:524:677:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:and   medium   size   Polish   firms,   the   survey   revealed   a   series   of   negative 
7:318:16965:14:14:70:524:663:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:consequences,  like  relocation  of  firms  and  the  enclave  effect,  which  was  not 
7:319:17053:14:14:70:524:649:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:compensated enough by the creation of new jobs and activation of the unemployed. 
7:320:17134:14:13:70:523:635:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Whereas,  because  of  short  period  of  Lodzka  SEZ  activity,  it  is  too  early  to  present

7:371:18328:7:17:70:524:253:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:10 Results of the research showed negative aspects of zone's activity. Those were firm relocations and 
7:372:18430:17:12:70:526:236:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:liquidations, reduction or branch changes in the previous site of production concern about 45% of the 
7:373:18532:12:11:70:524:224:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:companies.  Moreover,  enterprises  there  showed  not  many  linkages  between  the  firms from  the  zone 
7:374:18640:11:11:70:524:213:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:and other regional firms. The small extent of the firms from the zone use services offered by regional 
7:375:18742:11:12:70:527:202:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:firms. The region was not attractive for both inputs and outputs. The consequences were that the zone 
7:376:18844:12:11:70:524:190:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:became  in  large  extent  a  closed  enclave  and  not  an active  growth  pole  of  regional  development.  It 
7:377:18957:11:12:70:524:179:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:means that basic incentives to begin economic activity within the zone was the tax exemptions which 
7:378:19057:12:12:70:524:167:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:compensate the difficulties in economic activity caused by weak sides of the region and higher costs of 
7:379:19161:12:11:70:524:155:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:transport caused by peripheral location of the region. The positive aspect of the zone is the creation of 
7:380:19267:11:11:70:523:144:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:new  jobs.  However,  after  consideration  of  the  negative  effects  (e.g.  substitution  of  economic  activity) 
7:381:19384:11:12:70:524:133:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:only 60% of new jobs were created owing to the special economic zone. Nevertheless the zone plays 
7:382:19482:12:11:70:524:121:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:an important role in job activation of the unemployed, who count for about 50% of people employed in 
7:383:19583:11:12:70:524:110:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:the  zone.  Besides,  the  zone  influenced  changes  of  regional  economic  structure  by  creation  of  new 
7:384:19694:12:12:70:524:98:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:jobs   in   modern   factories.   It   also   creates   an   alternative   to   agricultural   activity   and   it   caused

8:395:20153:14:14:70:524:683:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:will  be  illustrated  by  two  indicators:  share  in  total  employment  in  manufacturing  in 
8:396:20250:14:14:70:524:669:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:particular  region  and  influence  on  changes  in  regional  unemployment  level.  The 
8:397:20339:14:14:70:524:655:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:general  assumptions  is  that:  if  the  zones  had  not  been  established  the  investors 
8:398:20432:14:13:70:524:641:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:would not build industrial plants in Poland or in a particular region. Of course such an 
8:399:20521:13:14:70:523:628:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:assumption is a great simplification, because we have clear evidence of the negative 
8:400:20606:14:14:70:524:614:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:effects of the functioning of the special economic zones like: relocation of the plants, 
8:401:20695:14:14:70:524:600:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:distortion  in  competitiveness  led  to  worse  conditions  to  firms  outside  the  zones  and 
8:402:20792:14:14:70:524:586:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:others  (Bazydlo,  Smetkowski  2000B),  but  the  effects  are  very  difficult  to  estimate. 
8:403:20887:14:13:70:524:572:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Therefore  we  have  to  accept  the  assumption  remembering  the  above  mentioned

8:407:21081:14:14:70:524:517:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:almost  imperceptible.  The  exceptions  are  Podkarpackie  and  Slaskie  voivodships 
8:408:21167:14:13:70:524:503:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:where zones led to a decrease of the level of unemployment by 1 per cent point.  On 
8:409:21251:13:14:70:524:490:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the other hand the influence of the zone on local labour market might be significant. 
8:410:21337:14:14:70:524:476:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:For example in Mielecka SEZ the level of employment increased only from 11,6% in 
8:411:21418:14:14:70:489:462:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:1998 to 16,1% in 2001 in comparison to national growth by 8,3 per cent point.

8:413:21497:14:13:70:524:434:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Zones also have a significant impact on employment in manufacturing in enterprises 
8:414:21580:13:14:70:524:421:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:sector. The share of zones in total employment in manufacturing starts from 0,4% in 
8:415:21664:14:14:70:528:407:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Malopolskie  to  7,7%  in  Podkarpackie  voivodship,  although  in  the  whole  country 
8:416:21752:14:14:70:524:393:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:merely  2,2%.  Moreover  the  zones  attracted  a  huge  amount  of  total  investment  in 
8:417:21843:14:14:70:524:379:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:industry  in  Poland  -    almost  7,1%.  The  share  in  capital  investment  exceeds  10%  in 
8:418:21939:14:13:70:488:365:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:four voivodships: Podkarpackie, Slaskie, Dolnoslaskie, Warminsko-mazurskie.

8:421:22099:14:14:70:524:324:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:regional  policy.  There  are  evidence  of  the  zones  that  have  siginificant  impact  on 
8:422:22193:14:14:70:523:310:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:processes  of  regional  and  local  development  like:  Mielcka  SEZ,  Katowicka  SEZ,

8:424:22366:13:14:70:524:283:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:regional development, because of the low level of investors activity. In general zones

8:428:22736:14:13:70:524:227:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:purposes  which  has  led  to  strong  competition  between  special  economic  zones  in

8:435:23069:14:14:70:524:125:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:issued by the zone authorities and only large investments (over 10 mln PLN) had to

8:437:23240:14:14:70:524:97:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:branches  appeared  in  each  zone,  which  made  difficult  zone  transformation  into 
8:438:23328:14:0:70:524:83:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:industrial clusters. Although there is a lack of industrial policy, the structure of zone’s 
9:439:23421:0:14:70:524:760:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:investments  seemed  to  be  favourable  with  significant  share  of  modern  industry

9:458:24989:14:13:70:523:491:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:like:  production  of  furniture  and  consumer  goods,  rubber  and  plastics,  food  and 
9:459:25080:13:14:70:524:478:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:drinks. Expenditure on creation of 1 place of employment in such branches is low (for

9:463:25428:14:13:70:523:422:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:as  a threat  in the future,  because  it facilitate  the  decision  of  closure  or  relocation  of

9:465:25590:20:14:70:524:389:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:It should be underlined that investors did not choose industrial branches recognised 
9:466:25675:14:14:70:523:375:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:as  “stable”  or  “regressive”  in  Poland.  Production  of  machinery  and  equipment,

9:470:25961:20:14:70:524:314:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:In conclusion it seems that the special economic zones will lead to strengthening of

10:536:27298:20:13:70:523:402:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:In the context of Polish integration with the European Union, one problem relevant to 
10:537:27384:13:14:70:524:389:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:special  economic  zones  seems  extremely  important  -   the  cohesion  of  Polish  legal 
10:538:27476:14:14:70:524:375:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:regulations  related  to  special  economic  zones  and  the  EU  standards  (Smetkowski

10:540:27654:14:14:70:524:347:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:article 87 (ex Article 92) of the EC Treaty. According to the Article, State aid can not 
10:541:27743:14:13:70:524:333:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:adversely affect trade between Member States. Compatible with the common market 
10:542:27823:13:14:70:524:320:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:are:  aid  having  a  social  character  (granted  to  individual  consumers),  aid  to  make 
10:543:27917:14:14:70:524:306:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:good  the  damage  caused  by  natural  disaster  or  exceptional  occurrences  and  aid 
10:544:28006:14:14:70:524:292:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:granted to the economy of East Germany. Another four types of aid may be consider 
10:545:28088:14:20:70:299:278:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:to be compatible with the common market: 
10:546:28129:20:13:70:523:258:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:a)  aid to promote the economic development of areas where the standard of living is 
10:547:28214:13:20:88:409:245:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment, 
10:548:28272:20:14:70:524:225:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:b)  aid to promote the execution of an important project of common European interest 
10:549:28357:14:20:88:467:211:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:or to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State, 
10:550:28426:20:14:70:524:191:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:c)  aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities or certain economic 
10:551:28515:14:19:88:128:177:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:areas,  
10:552:28523:19:20:70:353:158:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:d)  aid to promote culture and heritage conservation. 
10:553:28577:20:14:70:524:138:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Polish  SEZs  might  be  considered  as  aid  formulated  in  point  a)  and  c).  In  the  first 
10:554:28675:14:14:70:524:124:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:case, special economic zone could be established in regions, where GDP per capital 
10:555:28758:14:14:70:523:110:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:is  lower  than  75%  of  the  average  GDP  in  the  European  Union. Taking  into  account 
10:556:28851:14:13:70:524:96:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:general low level of development in Poland (about 40% of European Union average), 
10:557:28933:13:0:70:524:83:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:all Polish zones might be accepted by European Commission. In the second case, a 
11:558:29016:0:14:70:524:760:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:zone  could  be  established  in  the  region  where  income  per  inhabitant  is  lower  then 
11:559:29111:14:14:70:523:746:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:85% of national average or level of unemployment is higher than the 110% national 
11:560:29193:14:14:70:523:732:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:average. Nevertheless, in the framework of above derogation, there are strict rules of 
11:561:29280:14:14:70:524:718:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:State  aid.  Therefore  the  European  Union  Commission has  many  objections  to  the 
11:562:29368:14:13:70:524:704:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Polish special economic zones programme and demands the liquidation of the zones. 
11:563:29450:13:20:70:337:691:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The basic argument against the Polish zones are: 
11:564:29499:20:14:70:524:671:10:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f7:• Lack  of  strictly  defined  support  limits  for  firms  operating  within  the  zones.  In 
11:565:29593:14:14:88:524:657:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Member  States,  aid  depends  on  the  map  of  regional  support.  Dependent  on  the 
11:566:29681:14:14:88:524:643:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:level  of  economic  development,  strictly  defined  levels  of  support  are  allowed. 
11:567:29770:14:13:88:524:629:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Nevertheless,  in  any  case  level  of  State  aid  could not  exceed  75%  of  the 
11:568:29855:13:14:88:524:616:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:investment value. In Polish SEZs it is impossible to predict final level of State aid, 
11:569:29942:14:14:88:524:602:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:because  the  level  depends  on  firms  profitability  i.e.  the  amount  of  income  tax 
11:570:30033:14:20:88:159:588:12:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f11:exemptions;  
11:571:30045:20:14:70:523:568:10:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f7:• Possibilities  of  operational  aid,  which  does  not  reflect  amount  of  investment  in 
11:572:30138:14:20:88:161:554:12:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f11:fixed assets.  
11:573:30152:20:14:70:524:534:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f7:•    Lack  of  regulations  related  to  support for  firms from  sensitive  sectors.  There  are 
11:574:30250:14:14:88:524:520:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:special  regulations  concerning  support  for  sensitive  sectors  i.e.  metallurgy,  coal 
11:575:30342:14:14:88:524:506:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:mining, shipyard, synthetic fibre industry and motor vehicle in EU law. In case of 
11:576:30425:14:13:88:523:492:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Polish  SEZs  particularly  important  is  State  aid  for  motor  vehicle  industry.  In  the 
11:577:30520:13:14:88:524:479:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:European  Union  such  aid  had  to  be  accepted  by  Commission  and  investors, 
11:578:30603:14:14:88:524:465:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:among others, are obliged to prove that there were some other alternative sites of 
11:579:30686:14:14:88:524:451:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:location  of  the  factory  which  was  the  reason  why  the  support  in  that  place  was 
11:580:30779:14:14:88:524:437:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:necessary.  Additionally  large  part  of  automotive  concern  production  in  Polish 
11:581:30866:14:19:88:367:423:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:SEZs is directed for export, mainly the EU markets.  
11:582:30919:19:14:70:524:404:10:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f7:• Possibilities of combining different types of State aid. In case of Polish SEZs there 
11:583:31006:14:21:88:327:390:12:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f11:are no regulations related to such practices.  
11:584:31052:21:14:70:524:369:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f7:•    Possibilities  of  export-oriented  aid.  In  the  EU,  export  support  to  other  Member 
11:585:31148:14:13:88:524:355:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:States  is    definitely  forbidden.  Such  an  aid  was  possible  only  in  Mielcka  SEZ. 
11:586:31240:13:14:88:524:342:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Nowadays,  it  is  not  possible  to  receive  such  support,  but  there  are  still  four 
11:587:31332:14:20:88:501:328:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:companies, which are temporarily the beneficiaries of the export-oriented aid. 
11:588:31411:20:14:70:524:308:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The Polish Government, considering the above mentioned arguments, decided not to 
11:589:31492:14:14:70:524:294:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:establish  new  special  economic  zones  and  not  to  expand  existing  zones.  The  new 
11:590:31583:14:13:70:524:280:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Act  of  public  aid  passed  by  Parliament  on  30  June, 2000  established  new  rules  of 
11:591:31677:13:14:70:524:267:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:state support for entrepreneurships. The difference are the limit in the level of support 
11:592:31767:14:14:70:524:253:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:which  may  not  exceed  50%  in  majority  of  Polish  NUTS  3  with  the  possibility  of 
11:593:31859:14:14:70:524:239:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:increasing by 15% in the case of small and medium enterprises and differentiation of 
11:594:31944:14:14:70:524:225:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the aid depending on the branch of activity. Moreover according to the project of the 
11:595:32030:14:13:70:524:211:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Act   regarding   investment   incentive   scheme   all   investors   which   realise   new

11:597:32217:14:14:70:524:184:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:no  matter  of  the  industry  plant  localisation12.  In  the  light  of  the  new  act  the  only 
11:598:32317:14:14:70:524:170:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:advantage of special economic zones are an easier and automatic way of obtaining 
11:599:32398:14:13:70:524:156:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:tax   exemptions   and   possibility   of   taking   advantage of   the   existing   zone’s

11:601:32507:20:14:70:524:123:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Nevertheless  the  investors  that  received  a  license to  operate  in  zones  before  2000 
11:602:32601:14:24:70:524:109:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:are still an obstacle in Polish negotiation with the EU. The latest proposition of Polish

12:608:33024:20:14:70:128:712:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Summary 
12:609:33032:14:13:70:73:698:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7: 
12:610:33032:13:14:70:524:685:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The Polish special economic zone programme was not, as it seemed, an expression 
12:611:33112:14:14:70:524:671:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of  long-term  regional  and  industrial  policy,  but  rather  a  temporary  instrument  to 
12:612:33205:14:14:70:524:657:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:support    selected    regions    with    particular    problems    caused    by    economic 
12:613:33298:14:14:70:524:643:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:transformation.  The  survey  proved  that  the  programme  brings  different  results 
12:614:33385:14:13:70:524:629:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:depending on the zone examined, in general better in regions with existing economic 
12:615:33469:13:14:70:524:616:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:development  potential  than  in  more  backward  regions.  Moreover  only  in  a  few 
12:616:33556:14:14:70:524:602:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:voivodships   the   zones   have   a   significant   share   in   labour  market   and   capital 
12:617:33653:14:14:70:524:588:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:investment.  In  the  others  their  influence  are  limited  to  the  local  economic  systems. 
12:618:33750:14:14:70:523:574:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:On the other hand, although lack of industrial policy concerned the instrument, zones 
12:619:33836:14:13:70:524:560:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:supported a positive propensity in restructurisation of Polish industry by development 
12:620:33923:13:14:70:523:547:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of modern capital intensive industry branches. And finally it should be underlined that 
12:621:34011:14:14:70:524:533:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:during  the  preparation  of  the  programme,  the  cohesion  with  the  European  Union 
12:622:34100:14:14:70:524:519:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:standards in the field of competitive policy was not considered. Currently, despite of 
12:623:34187:14:14:70:524:505:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:amendments  in  the  special  economic  zones  Act,  in  order  to  achieve  cohesion  with 
12:624:34279:14:13:70:524:491:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the  European  Union  law,  special  economic  zones  are still  an  obstacle  in  Polish 
12:625:34369:13:14:70:524:478:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:negotiation with the EU in the field of competitiveness policy, because of previous tax 
12:626:34457:14:20:70:207:464:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:exemptions for investors.
