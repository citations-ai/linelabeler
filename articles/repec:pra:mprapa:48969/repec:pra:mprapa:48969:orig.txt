2:33:768:14:13:85:526:377:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f6:Abstract:  This  paper  takes  into  account  the  dynamic  feedback  between  government 
2:34:858:13:14:85:527:364:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:expenditures  and  output  in  a  model  that  separates  the  effects  of  expected  and  unexpected 
2:35:960:14:14:85:526:350:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:government expenditures on output. We allow for standard determinants based on Solow’s 
2:36:1047:14:14:85:526:336:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:growth model, as well as financial globalization and trade openness measures for a sample 
2:37:1137:14:14:85:526:322:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:of  56  industrial  and  emerging  market  economies  over  the  1970-2004  period.  We  find  that 
2:38:1237:14:13:85:526:308:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:unanticipated  government  expenditures  have  negative  and  significant  effects  on  output 
2:39:1332:13:14:85:527:295:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:growth,  with  higher  effects  in  developed  economies.  Along  with  savings  responses,  we 
2:40:1428:14:14:85:527:281:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:interpret  these  results  based  on  how  fiscal  policy reacts  to  business  cycles.  Anticipated 
2:41:1529:14:14:85:527:267:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:government  expenditures  have  negative  -  but  smaller  effects  -  on  output  growth.  These 
2:42:1627:14:14:85:527:253:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:results are very robust to a recursive treatment of expectations, which reinforces the role of

3:56:2139:27:28:108:540:681:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:This  paper  estimates  a  rational  expectations  model in  the  tradition  of  Barro  (1977)  to 
3:57:2238:28:27:71:540:653:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:separate the effects of expected and unexpected government expenditures on output. We conduct 
3:58:2332:27:28:71:540:626:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:a new econometric treatment of output growth over the years 1970-2004, which provides a fairly 
3:59:2427:28:27:71:540:598:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:long  time  span  of  analysis.  Our  approach  is  initially  based  on  the  literature  on  growth  empirics 
3:60:2539:27:28:71:540:571:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:that  use  dynamic  panels  (e.g.,  Islam,  1995).  We  then  propose  a  two-step  approach  consistent 
3:61:2644:28:28:71:540:543:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:with  the  feedback  mechanism  in  Bun  and  Kiviet  (2006)  where  in  the  first  step  we  identify  the 
3:62:2753:28:27:71:539:515:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:expected and unexpected components of government expenditures and then test if they have the 
3:63:2846:27:28:71:218:488:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:same effect on output growth. 
3:64:2876:28:27:107:539:460:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A  reconsideration  of  how  government  size  has  an  impact  on  economic  growth  is  well 
3:65:2971:27:28:71:542:433:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:deserved for several reasons. First, it is at the forefront of economic policy debate, including the 
3:66:3072:28:28:72:539:405:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:way the U.S., for example, chose to fight the 2008-2009 economic crisis with expansionary fiscal 
3:67:3169:28:27:72:539:377:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:policies  (mostly  through  higher  government  deficits),  coupled  with  loose  monetary  policy 
3:68:3268:27:28:72:540:350:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:(driving  the  federal  funds  target  rate  to  zero).  Economists  diverge  on  the  effectiveness  of  these 
3:69:3380:28:27:72:539:322:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:measures  and  the  debate  is  ongoing.  Fiscal  policy  is  one  area  of  attention,  which  under  the 
3:70:3487:27:28:72:506:295:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Keynesian view argues for a sufficiently large multiplier effect of government purchases.  
3:71:3578:28:28:107:540:267:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:While U.S. government calculations suggested a fiscal policy multiplier greater than one, 
3:72:3668:28:27:71:539:239:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Robert Barro strongly criticizes the use of a number around 1.5, stating that there are reasons to 
3:73:3767:27:28:71:540:212:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:believe  that  the  war-based  0.8  multiplier  substantially  overstates  the  multiplier  that  applies  to 
3:74:3877:28:38:71:539:184:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:peacetime  government  purchases.1  Robert  Barro  also  reports  the  estimation  of  a  spending

3:76:4024:21:17:71:540:125:6:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:1  Robert  Barro,  Government  Spending  is  no  Free  Lunch, The  Wall  Street  Journal,  Jan  22,  2009.  He  makes  the 
3:77:4147:17:11:71:539:108:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:expectations channel clear: “There are reasons to believe that the war-based multiplier of 0.8 substantially overstates 
3:78:4267:11:11:71:540:97:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the  multiplier  that  applies  to  peacetime  government  purchases.  For  one  thing,  people  would  expect  the added 
3:79:4389:11:12:71:540:86:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:wartime  outlays  to  be  partly  temporary  (so  that  consumer  demand  would  not  fall  a  lot).  Second,  the  use  of  the 
3:80:4518:12:0:71:540:74:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:military  draft  in  wartime  has  a  direct,  coercive  effect  on  total  employment.  Finally,  the  U.S.  economy  was  already 
4:81:4652:0:28:72:540:709:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:multiplier of around 0.4 within the same year and about 0.6 over two years.2 Barro and Redlick 
4:82:4747:28:28:71:539:681:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:(2011)  provide  detailed  evidence  for  the  U.S.  economy  in  the  long-run.  Ramey  (2011)  surveys 
4:83:4852:28:27:71:540:653:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:the evidence on the government multiplier. She discusses the multiplier in the neoclassical model 
4:84:4950:27:28:71:539:626:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:as positive or negative (depending on the extent of distortionary taxes), as well as the Keynesian 
4:85:5049:28:27:71:540:598:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:case through the marginal propensity to  consume. Since theoretical work gives a wide range of 
4:86:5144:27:28:71:539:571:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:values  for  the  multiplier,  she  advocates  a  “turn  to  the  data  to  see  if  we  can  narrow  the  range.” 
4:87:5259:28:28:71:182:543:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Ramey (2011, p. 676). 
4:88:5281:28:27:107:539:515:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Research on other major economies illustrates mixed findings as well. Forni et al. (2009), 
4:89:5372:27:28:71:540:488:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:for example, employ a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model and find for the Euro area 
4:90:5466:28:27:71:540:460:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:that government purchases of goods and services and compensations for public employees have 
4:91:5558:27:28:71:539:433:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:small and short-lived expansionary effects on private consumption, while innovations in transfers 
4:92:5656:28:28:71:540:405:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:to  households  show  a  slightly  more  sizeable  and  lasting  effect.  Afonso  and  Jalles  (2011)  report 
4:93:5766:28:27:71:539:377:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:panel results for 108 countries from 1970-2008 using a growth model in which the results show a 
4:94:5862:27:28:71:540:350:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:negative  effect  of  government  size  on  growth.  For  the  European  Union,  in  particular,  member 
4:95:5967:28:27:71:540:322:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:states  faced  a  fiscal  framework  with  sound  fiscal  policies  within  the  Stability  and  Growth  Pact 
4:96:6077:27:28:71:539:295:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:(SGP)  guidelines  put  forward  in  1997.  They  use  three  indices  constructed  by  the  European 
4:97:6179:28:28:71:539:267:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Commission  (overall  rule,  expenditure,  and  budget  balance  indexes)  based  on  surveys  and  find 
4:98:6284:28:27:71:539:239:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:that  these  fiscal  numerical  rules  improve  GDP  growth  for  these  EU  countries,  while  the 
4:99:6384:27:28:71:275:212:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:government size proxy loses significance. 
4:100:6426:28:27:107:540:184:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f8:Second,  it  is  clear  that the  size  of  government  matters  for  growth,  although  the  precise 
4:101:6528:27:23:71:540:157:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f6:effect is difficult to determine. The positive effect of government activities on output depends in

4:103:6784:12:11:71:539:122:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:growing rapidly after 1933 (aside from the 1938 recession), and it is probably unfair to ascribe all of the rapid GDP 
4:104:6902:11:12:71:539:111:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:growth  from  1941  to  1945  to  the  added  military  outlays.  In  any  event,  when  I  attempted  to  estimate  directly  the 
4:105:7033:12:20:71:522:99:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:multiplier associated with peacetime government purchases, I got a number insignificantly different from zero.”

5:108:7336:28:28:72:540:681:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:(1990), who extends endogenous-growth models to include tax-financed government services on 
5:109:7428:28:27:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:production  and  assumes  exogenous  government  actions.  In  his  model  variations  in  the  share  of 
5:110:7534:27:28:72:540:626:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f6:productive government  expenditures  in  GDP  affect  the  growth  and  saving  rates.  Kneller  et  al. 
5:111:7639:28:27:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:(1999)  find  strong  empirical  support  for  Barro  (1990)’s  endogenous  growth  model,  in  which 
5:112:7741:27:28:72:540:571:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:taxation  and  public  expenditure  can  affect  the  steady-state  growth  rate.  Growth  regressions  in 
5:113:7848:28:28:72:539:543:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Mueller  and  Stratmann  (2003)  from  1960  to  1990  show  that  there  is  a  positive  association 
5:114:7951:28:27:72:539:515:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:between  government  size  and  growth  in  low-income  countries,  where  the  government  sectors 
5:115:8051:27:28:72:540:488:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:tend  to  be  small,  and  a  negative  relationship  across  high-income  countries,  where  government 
5:116:8156:28:27:72:540:460:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:sector has grown larger. Tagkalakis (2008) examines the effects of fiscal policy on consumption 
5:117:8252:27:28:72:540:433:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:in  recessions  and  expansions  in  a  yearly  panel  of  nineteen  OECD  countries  from  1970  to  2002 
5:118:8359:28:28:72:539:405:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:and finds that the effect of fiscal policy is more pronounced in countries characterized by a less 
5:119:8458:28:27:72:514:377:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:developed consumer credit market. His explanation is through binding liquidity constraints. 
5:120:8550:27:28:107:540:350:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Barro  (1991)  and   López-Villavicencio  and  Mignon  (2011)  find  that  the  share  of 
5:121:8640:28:27:71:540:322:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:government  consumption  in  GDP  is  inversely  related to  GDP  growth,  while  Levine  and  Renelt 
5:122:8742:27:28:71:540:295:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:(1992)  report  government  consumption  expenditures  to  GDP  having  a  negative  effect  on  GDP 
5:123:8843:28:28:71:539:267:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:growth,  but  the  results  are  not  robust.  A  host  of  papers  has  assessed  the  role  of  government 
5:124:8952:28:27:71:539:239:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:expenditures  on  growth.  Different  specifications  include  removing  education  and  defense  from 
5:125:9055:27:28:71:539:212:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:government expenditures in Barro (1990) but most previous works in the cross-section tradition 
5:126:9150:28:64:71:529:184:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:have demonstrated the fragile nature of the link between government expenditures on growth.3 
5:127:9242:64:7:72:218:120:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:                                                 
5:128:9290:7:16:71:540:113:6:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:3 In time series, Blanchard and Perotti (2002) examine the effects of changes in government spending and taxes on 
5:129:9404:16:11:72:539:97:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:output. Employing a three-variable VAR (with taxes,  spending, and quarterly real per capita GDP) for the postwar 
5:130:9518:11:12:71:539:86:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:U.S., they find in all specifications that output responds positively to a spending shock, although the persistence of 
5:131:9637:12:0:72:474:74:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the impulse responses changes depending on whether a deterministic or stochastic trend is assumed. 
6:132:9738:0:28:108:539:709:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Ram (1986) surveys the earlier evidence on the size of government and economic growth. 
6:133:9825:28:28:71:539:681:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Bergh  and  Henrekson  (2011)  survey  the  more  recent  literature  and  report  a  significant  negative 
6:134:9933:28:27:71:540:653:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:correlation  in  most  recent  studies:  an  increase  in government  size  by  10%  is  associated  with  a 
6:135:10042:27:28:71:540:626:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:0.5%  to  1%  lower  annual  growth  rate.  One  of  the  problems  that  plagued  earlier  works  is  the 
6:136:10149:28:27:71:540:598:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:possibility of reverse causation, in which the extent of economic growth could determine the size 
6:137:10247:27:28:71:539:571:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:of government. As Bergh and Henrekson (2011, p. 12) put it: “In general, in times of economic 
6:138:10341:28:28:71:539:543:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:downturn social expenditure provides stabilizers that automatically undermine the government’s 
6:139:10436:28:27:71:540:515:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:balanced  budget.  On  the  other  hand,  in  boom  years  when  growth  rates  are  higher  fewer  people 
6:140:10543:27:28:71:540:488:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:will  be  unemployed,  and  public  expenditure  shares  will  be  lower.  For  this  reason,  a  negative 
6:141:10650:28:27:71:540:460:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:correlation between public expenditure and economic growth is to be expected in the short run. 
6:142:10745:27:28:71:526:433:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Finding a negative correlation is therefore no proof that high expenditure causes low growth.” 
6:143:10840:28:28:107:539:405:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f8:Third, previous research on economic growth has outlined how productivity is enhanced 
6:144:10926:28:27:71:539:377:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f6:by  the  extent  of  trade  openness  and/or  integration to  global  capital  markets.  Edwards  (1998) 
6:145:11031:27:28:71:539:350:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:examines  nine  measures  of  trade  policy  in  93  countries  on  total  factor  productivity  growth  and 
6:146:11140:28:27:71:540:322:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:found  that  more  open  countries  experienced  faster  productivity  growth.  Edison  et  al.  (2002) 
6:147:11244:27:28:71:539:295:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:report estimations of international financial integration effects on economic growth per capita for 
6:148:11344:28:28:71:540:267:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:57  countries.  Although  they  usually  find  positive  growth  effects  on  the  capital  flows  measure, 
6:149:11452:28:27:71:540:239:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:they show mixed results for government balances. For Mishkin (2009) opening to foreign capital 
6:150:11547:27:28:71:540:212:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:directly increases access to capital, lowering its cost. See also the dynamic panels by Chang et al. 
6:151:11648:28:27:71:540:184:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:(2008)  and  Baltagi  et  al.  (2009).  Aizenman  (2008)  links  financial  with  trade  openness  and 
6:152:11751:27:28:71:539:157:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:documents  highly  significant  positive  association  between  changes  in  financial  and  trade 
6:153:11850:28:0:71:540:129:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:openness  in  developing  countries  and  Swaleheen  (2011)  relates  the  extent  of  the  size  of 
7:154:11953:0:28:72:539:709:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:government with economic growth and shows a negative effect of corruption on the growth rate 
7:155:12046:28:28:72:201:681:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:of real per capita income.4 
7:156:12073:28:27:107:539:653:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f8:Fourth, most   of   the   existing   empirical   estimates   have   assumed   that   government 
7:157:12169:27:28:71:540:626:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f6:expenditures are entirely exogenous to economic growth. We relax this assumption in this paper, 
7:158:12265:28:27:71:539:598:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:exploring  the  class  of  estimators  developed  by  Blundell  and  Bond  (1998).  Endogeneity  has 
7:159:12366:27:28:71:540:571:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:plagued  past  research  on  economic  growth  and  Barro (1990,  p.  S121)  mentions  in  a  theoretical 
7:160:12472:28:28:71:540:543:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:paper that “aside from problems of measuring public services and the rates of growth and saving, 
7:161:12569:28:27:71:542:515:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:the  empirical  implementation  of  the  model  is  complicated  by  the  endogeneity  of  government.” 
7:162:12673:27:28:71:539:488:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Perotti   (1999)   assumes   exogenous   government   expenditures   in   his   treatment   of   private 
7:163:12778:28:27:71:426:460:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:consumption responding to fiscal shocks and to the state of the economy. 
7:164:12851:27:28:107:540:433:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:In  this  paper  we  reexamine  the  role  of  anticipated and  unanticipated  government 
7:165:12941:28:28:71:539:405:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:purchases  in  economic  growth.  With  the  Solow  (1956)  model  as  benchmark,  the  rate  of 
7:166:13038:28:27:71:540:377:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:population  growth  and  the  ratio  of  investment  to  output  are  the  key  determinants  of  economic 
7:167:13145:27:28:71:540:350:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:growth.   Capital   flows   from   abroad   and   government   expenditures   can,   however,   provide 
7:168:13249:28:27:71:539:322:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:additional  channels  to  economic  growth,  as  long  as these  affect  the  stock  of  capital  and  the 
7:169:13356:27:28:71:540:295:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:savings  rate,  respectively.  Recent  research  along  these  lines  by  Mollick  and  Cabral  (2011)  and 
7:170:13464:28:28:71:539:267:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Cabral and Mollick (2012) sheds light on this channel for a sample of developed and emerging 
7:171:13557:28:27:71:540:239:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:market economies from 1986 to 2004 to capture the globalization years after GATT negotiations 
7:172:13651:27:28:71:138:212:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:in late 1980s. 
7:173:13666:28:27:107:540:184:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:We find that unanticipated government expenditures have negative and significant effects 
7:174:13755:27:25:71:540:157:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:on  output  growth.  Anticipated  government  expenditures  have  negative  -  but  almost  negligible 
7:175:13858:25:7:71:218:132:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:                                                 
7:176:13906:7:17:71:540:125:6:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:4  The  link  between  government  size  and  openness  has been  extensively  studied  as  well.  Rodrik  (1998)  finds  a 
7:177:14030:17:11:71:539:108:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:positive  relationship  between  trade  openness  and  the  size  of  government,  and  Alesina  and  Wacziarg  (1998) 
7:178:14149:11:11:71:540:97:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:document a negative covariation of country size with trade openness and with the ratio of government expenditures 
7:179:14263:11:12:71:540:86:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:to output. Ram (2009) uses 41-year panel data covering the period 1960-2000 for 154 countries to  find support for 
7:180:14378:12:0:71:522:74:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the direct relationship in Rodrik (1998), while Benarroch and Pandey (2008) find the opposite to Rodrik (1998). 
8:181:14492:0:28:72:540:709:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:effects - on output growth. We also find that, in developed economies, the unanticipated output 
8:182:14588:28:28:72:540:681:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:effects of government expenditures are much higher than in emerging markets. These results are 
8:183:14683:28:27:72:324:653:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:very robust to a recursive treatment of expectations. 
8:184:14737:27:28:108:540:626:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:In  contrast to Tagkalakis (2008), who used as proxy for credit constraints the maximum 
8:185:14825:28:27:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:ratio  of  the  loan  to  the  value  of  the  house  in  housing  mortgages  for  first  time  buyers  in  OECD 
8:186:14938:27:28:72:540:571:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:economies,  we  verify  the  role  of  credit  constrains distinguishing  between  developed  and 
8:187:15036:28:28:72:539:543:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:emerging  market  economies  as  did  Lane  and  Milesi-Ferreti  (2007):  economies  can  be  more  or 
8:188:15139:28:27:72:539:515:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:less  open  depending  on  the  extent  of  financial  (and  trade)  flows.  This  may  complement  the 
8:189:15243:27:28:72:540:488:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:government-output channel in fiscal policy. It is natural to expect that developed and developing 
8:190:15341:28:27:72:543:460:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:countries  may  have  different  causal  mechanisms  when  exploring  economic  growth  when both 
8:191:15438:27:28:71:539:433:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:external  flows  and  the  government  sector  are  present.  Gourinchas  and  Jeanne  (2006)  use  a 
8:192:15540:28:28:71:539:405:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:calibrated neoclassical growth model and found that developing countries do not benefit greatly 
8:193:15636:28:27:71:539:377:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:from  international  financial  integration  and  Adam  and  Bevan  (2005)  report  threshold  effects  of 
8:194:15743:27:28:71:379:350:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:fiscal deficits on growth for a panel of 45 developing countries. 
8:195:15809:28:27:108:540:322:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:This paper has four more sections. Section 2 introduces the data employed in this work; 
8:196:15897:27:28:71:539:295:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:section 3 contains the empirical methodologies and the dynamic panel data models used; section 
8:197:15992:28:28:71:351:267:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:4 discusses the results; and section 5 concludes the paper.

8:199:16052:27:38:107:176:212:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:2. The Data 
8:200:16063:38:27:107:539:174:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:The data set for this paper comes from a yearly panel including 56 countries for over 35 
8:201:16152:27:28:71:540:147:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:years,  from  1970  to  2004.  Cabral  and  Mollick  (2012)  contain  more  detailed  discussion  of  this 
8:202:16259:28:27:71:539:119:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:dataset.  The  main  source  of  data  is  the  World  Bank Development  Indicators  database  and  the 
8:203:16363:27:0:71:540:92:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:data set on foreign assets compiled by Lane and Milesi-Ferreti (2007). The variables in the data 
9:204:16462:0:28:72:539:708:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:set are the Gross Domestic Product --- for country - at  year -, total population ---,  government 
9:205:16561:28:28:71:539:680:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:expenditures ---, investment \b--, and three measures of globalization. The first is trade openness 
9:206:16661:28:28:71:539:652:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f6:	\n--,  calculated  as  the  sum  of  imports  and  exports,  divided  by ---.  The  second  and  third 
9:207:16765:28:28:72:540:624:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:measures follow Lane and Milesi-Ferreti (2007). The second is international financial integration 
9:208:16863:28:28:71:540:596:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f6:\b-\b--,  calculated  as  the  stock  of  external  assets  plus  the  stock  of  external  liabilities,  divided  by

10:230:18960:28:27:71:539:624:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:derived  from  this  table.  Developed  economies  have  a  nearly  six  time  larger  GDP  per  capita,

10:238:19569:27:28:107:540:403:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Under the small open economy assumption, Abel et al. (2011) show that desired savings 
10:239:19655:28:27:71:539:375:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:(Sd) and investment (Id) depend positively and negatively, respectively, on the world real interest 
10:240:19755:27:28:72:539:348:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:rate  (rw).  If  G  goes  up,  savings  (S  =  Y  –  C  –  G)  decrease  and  the  saving  function  decreases, 
10:241:19867:28:27:72:539:320:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:shifting to the left. For a given rw, current account (CA) incurs a deficit, which can be offset by 
10:242:19967:27:28:72:539:293:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:either   higher   trade   surplus   (TB)   or   higher   capital account   (KA)   surplus.   The   financial 
10:243:20076:28:28:72:539:265:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:globalization  measures  used  in  this  paper  take  this  offsetting  factor  of  CA  into  account  when 
10:244:20184:28:27:72:539:237:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:government undertakes  higher or lower deficits in response to the business cycle. While Perotti 
10:245:20281:27:28:72:540:210:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:(1999)  assumes  exogenous  government  expenditures  for  simplification,  we  believe  it  is  more 
10:246:20383:28:27:72:539:182:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:interesting  to  allow  government  expenditures  to  be endogenous  (in  the  feedback  mechanism 
10:247:20482:27:28:72:539:155:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:specified  below)  and  respond  to  all  new  information  available.  Our  results  hold  of  course  with

11:249:20634:0:28:108:540:709:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:The  basic  empirical  models  below  build  on  Mankiw  et  al.  (1992)’s  treatment  of  Solow 
11:250:20731:28:28:72:540:681:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:(1956).  In  this  paper  we  modify  this  framework  for anticipated  and  unanticipated  government 
11:251:20834:28:27:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:expenditures  in  the  tradition  of  the  rational  expectations  model  by  Barro  (1977),  who  showed 
11:252:20940:27:28:72:539:626:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:that  only  unanticipated  money  has  real  effects  on  unemployment.  In  doing  so,  we  briefly 
11:253:21041:28:27:72:539:598:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:compare  our  strategy  to  two  empirical  works,  who  have  identified  unexpected  government 
11:254:21139:27:28:72:540:571:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:shocks  differently.  For  instance,  as  for  the  identification  of anticipated  fiscal  shocks  within  a 
11:255:21249:28:28:72:539:543:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:VAR  framework,  Blanchard  and  Perotti  (2002)  draw  two  conclusions:  “First,  identifying  and 
11:256:21350:28:27:72:540:515:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:tracing the effects of anticipated fiscal shocks can be done within a VAR framework but requires 
11:257:21447:27:28:72:540:488:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:stronger  identification  restrictions.  These  restrictions  may  be  too  strong.  Second,  under  these 
11:258:21554:28:27:72:540:460:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:identification  restrictions,  we  find  that  allowing for  anticipated  fiscal  policy  does  not  alter 
11:259:21661:27:28:72:539:433:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:substantially the  results  we have obtained so far, ... , our impulse  responses suggest only weak 
11:260:21761:28:28:72:542:405:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:effects of anticipated tax changes on output, a result consistent, for example, with the findings by 
11:261:21862:28:27:72:539:377:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Poterba (1988) for the Reagan tax cuts.”  Blanchard and Perotti (2002, p. 1355). In the context of 
11:262:21961:27:28:72:540:350:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:cross-section  regressions  over  1960-2000,  Woo  (2011)  puts  forward  a  fiscal  policy  volatility 
11:263:22065:28:27:72:539:322:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:channel,  in  which  excessive  discretionary  changes  in  fiscal  policy  take  place  for  reasons  other 
11:264:22174:27:28:72:539:295:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:than  smoothing  out  fluctuations  or  responding  to  macroeconomic  conditions.  He  first  estimates 
11:265:22279:28:28:72:539:267:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:time series regressions for final government expenditures (for each country) as a function of real 
11:266:22378:28:27:72:539:239:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:GDP and controls. The country-specific measure of discretionary spending policy volatility is the 
11:267:22476:27:28:72:354:212:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:log of standard deviation of the residuals of this equation.  
11:268:22538:28:27:108:539:184:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:We   propose   below   a   way   to   separate   expected   from   unexpected   components   of

11:271:22846:28:0:72:543:101:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:the  literature  on  growth  empirics  that  use  dynamic panel  data  methods  (see,  e.g.,  Islam,  1995). 
12:272:22958:0:28:72:539:709:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:We  then  propose  a  two-step  procedure  where  in  the  first  step  we  estimate  a  government 
12:273:23058:28:28:72:539:681:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:expenditures equation that follows the feedback mechanism in Bun and Kiviet (2006). This first 
12:274:23153:28:27:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:step  serves  to  separate  government  expenditures  into  its  expected  and  unexpected  components. 
12:275:23257:27:28:72:540:626:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:In the second step we reestimate the output growth equation by allowing the marginal effects of 
12:276:23353:28:27:72:542:598:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:government expenditures on output to be different if the expenditures are expected or if they are

12:294:24686:28:0:71:540:95:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:government  expenditures  and  output  may  reflect  a  common  driving  force  that  arises  from  a 
13:295:24791:0:28:72:540:709:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:dynamic  adjustment  process.  Hence,  to  take  into  account  that  government  expenditures  during

14:328:27969:28:27:108:542:570:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:The dynamic output characterization of (1) does not require specifying any models for --- 
14:329:28058:27:28:71:539:543:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:to  obtain  estimates  of  the  parameters (α, β, θ).  However,  formalizing  the  feedback  mechanism 
14:330:28161:28:28:72:542:515:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:from output to government purchases serves two objectives. First, it can be used to show why --- 
14:331:28257:28:28:71:539:487:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:needs  to  be  treated  as  weakly  exogenous  or  endogenous  in  the  estimation  of  equation  (1). 
14:332:28360:28:28:71:539:459:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Second,  characterizing  the  evolution  of ---  is  useful  to  separate  expenditures  into  expected  and 
14:333:28469:28:27:71:540:431:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:unexpected  government  expenditures.  Our  simplest  specification  of  the  feedback  mechanism 
14:334:28567:27:28:71:540:404:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:follows   one   of   the   characterizations   in   Bun   and   Kiviet   (2006)   and   models   government

14:337:28743:29:28:107:540:319:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Equation (2) indicates that the government decides expenditure levels at the beginning of 
14:338:28833:28:28:71:540:291:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:the  period  based  on  the  realization  of  last  period's  variables.  When 1 = 0, ---  in  (1)  is  strictly 
14:339:28946:28:28:72:539:263:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:exogenous.  When 1 ≠ 0, ---  it  should  be  modeled  as  endogenous  or  weakly  exogenous  and 
14:340:29043:28:29:72:351:235:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:depends via --,--- on all past disturbances; not just on ---. 
14:341:29104:29:27:72:539:206:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6: As (2) suggests, government expenditures today can be affected by previous realizations 
14:342:29192:27:28:72:540:179:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:of output. Moreover, equation (1) indicates that output can be affected by previous realizations of 
14:343:29292:28:28:72:539:151:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:the  right-hand  side  variables.  This  feedback  mechanism  between  output  and  government 
14:344:29387:28:14:72:542:123:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:expenditures means that agents can behave dynamically. Weak exogeneity or endogeneity of ---

14:346:29527:8:15:71:539:101:6:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:6 Bun and Kiviet (2006) formalize the feedback mechanism to analyze the finite sample behavior of particular least 
14:347:29642:15:12:72:540:86:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:squares  and  method  of  moments  estimators.  A  similar  characterization  is  used  in  Blundell  et  al.  (2000)  in  some 
14:348:29770:12:0:72:176:74:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Monte Carlo simulations. 
15:349:29798:0:28:72:539:709:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:only  implies  that  government  expenditure  decisions today  must  be  uncorrelated  with  future 
15:350:29898:28:28:72:539:681:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:realizations  of  unexpected  output  shocks.  This  does  not  restrict  the  government  or  other  agents 
15:351:30007:28:27:72:539:653:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:from  adopting  a  forward-looking  perspective.  Moreover,  weak  exogeneity  and  endogeneity  are 
15:352:30108:27:28:72:540:626:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:consistent with rational  expectations models in which agents' beliefs would be equal to the true 
15:353:30206:28:27:72:539:598:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:data-generating process. Under rational expectations, government sets expenditures according to 
15:354:30302:27:28:72:540:571:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:equation  (2),  while  output  evolves  according  to  (1).  However,  agents  may  have  their  own 
15:355:30403:28:28:72:542:543:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:subjective beliefs about the evolution of --- and ---, and not necessarily following (1)  and (2).7 
15:356:30502:28:28:71:540:515:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Even  if  all  agents  have  rational  expectations,  private  information  drives  variance  on  when  (and 
15:357:30611:28:27:71:540:487:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:how much) governments spend. Notice that equation (2) can be used to assess the cyclicality of 
15:358:30706:27:28:71:539:460:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:fiscal policy, for example, as in Woo (2011), who uses time series data to estimate the responses 
15:359:30804:28:27:71:272:432:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:of government expenditures to real GDP.

15:362:30886:28:28:107:540:349:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Equation  (2)  can  be  written  to  emphasize  the  existence  of  the  two  additive  separable

15:365:31068:29:27:107:540:263:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:The first term on the right-hand side is the expected or anticipated component, while the 
15:366:31158:27:28:71:539:236:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:second  term  is  the  unanticipated  component  of  government  expenditures.  We  can  then  rewrite 
15:367:31261:28:28:71:401:208:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:(1) to identify the effect of each of these two components on output:

15:373:31758:16:0:72:312:74:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:professional forecasters’ expectations do not depart much.   
16:374:31822:0:28:72:539:708:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:estimation  of  (3),  while  the  shock, (---− -[---]),  is  obtained  as  the  regression  residuals.  Note 
16:375:31931:28:28:72:540:680:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:that  because  the  output  equation  controls  for  time-invariant  country-specific  characteristics --, 
16:376:32038:28:28:72:540:652:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:we do not need estimates of the time-invariant components of the error term 3- in (3). This two-
16:377:32134:28:28:71:540:624:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:step procedure means that -[---] and (---− -[---]) are derived from a first-stage estimation of 
16:378:32230:28:28:72:540:596:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:the  government  expenditures  equation.  Including  only  the  fitted  values  on  (3)  would  yield 
16:379:32332:28:28:72:537:568:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:incorrect standard errors because of the additional variation that arises when estimating -[---].8  
16:380:32432:28:27:107:540:540:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:It  is  interesting  to  note  that  Equation  (1)  follows  the  existing  literature  on  growth 
16:381:32531:27:28:71:539:513:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:empirics that use dynamic panels (e.g., Islam, 1995). This literature is concerned with explaining 
16:382:32630:28:27:71:540:485:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:economic  growth  and  it  is  largely  motivated  by  the theoretical  models  in  Solow  (1956)  and 
16:383:32733:27:28:71:540:458:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Mankiw  et  al.  (1992).  These  models  involve  not  only  long-run  growth  but  also  short-run 
16:384:32833:28:28:71:540:430:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:convergence towards steady-states. While Equation (1) is the typical economic growth equation 
16:385:32927:28:27:71:539:402:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:with  a  long-run  interpretation,  Equation  (4)  also  models  short-term  dynamics.  This  is  the  case 
16:386:33035:27:28:71:540:375:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:because   unanticipated   government   expenditures   are, of   course,   short-run.   Moreover,   the 
16:387:33138:28:28:71:540:347:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:intermediate  step  of  estimating  Equation  (2)  prior to  estimation  of  Equation  (4)  can  be 
16:388:33238:28:28:71:539:319:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:interpreted  as  a  filtering  of ---.9  While  the  most  common  use  of  filters  is  to  calculate  trends  or

16:398:34002:7:15:71:539:101:6:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:9 Some panel studies (e.g., Furceri and Mourougane, 2012) use the Kalman filter to obtain structural unemployment 
16:399:34116:15:12:72:540:86:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:or  univariate  filters  (such  as  the  Hodrick-Prescott  filter)  to  smooth  variables.  In  this  paper  we  follow  Islam  (1995) 
16:400:34251:12:0:72:199:74:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:and we do not use those filters.

17:406:34781:27:28:72:539:569:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:approach is to condition the formation of expectations on the same information set agents have.

17:411:35025:29:29:107:540:425:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:This  last  equation  indicates  that  the  information  set  at  the  end  of  period - − 1, <-,---, 
17:412:35127:29:28:72:539:396:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:includes  all  previous  realizations  of  the  variables  (including  previous  shocks),  but  does  not 
17:413:35233:28:28:72:540:368:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:include contemporaneous shocks. In addition, notice that the coefficients (0-, 1-, 2-) are allowed 
17:414:35332:28:28:72:540:340:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:to  change  over  time  because  they  are  updated  every period  as  additional  new  information 
17:415:35432:28:28:72:540:312:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:becomes  available.  To  reflect  this  process  we  construct -[---]  and (---− -[---])  using  time-

17:420:35747:27:28:107:540:174:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:In  order  to  estimate  equations  (1),  (2)  (only  once and  recursively),  and  (4),  we  use  the 
17:421:35850:28:27:71:539:146:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:generalized-method-of-moments (GMM) estimators for dynamic panel data models proposed in 
17:422:35939:27:28:71:539:119:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Holtz-Eakin  et  at.  (1988),  Arellano  and  Bond  (1991),  Arellano  and  Bover  (1995),  and  Blundell 
17:423:36045:28:0:71:539:91:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:and  Bond  (1998).  These  estimators  are  consistent  with  rational  expectations  models,  include 
18:424:36151:0:28:72:539:709:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:dynamics, and address the potential endogeneity of the regressors. To show the importance of the 
18:425:36248:28:28:72:540:681:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:assumptions  behind  these  estimators,  consider  the  estimation  of  (2).  Taking  first  differences 
18:426:36353:28:28:72:368:653:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:eliminates the time-invariant country-specific characteristics:

18:428:36464:28:28:72:539:597:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6: We need instruments to deal with the potential endogeneity of the explanatory variables. 
18:429:36553:28:29:72:540:569:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:By construction ∆4-- is correlated with ∆--,---, ∆--,---, and ∆--,---. Under the assumptions that 
18:430:36651:29:29:71:539:540:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f6:4--  is  not  serially  correlated  and  that --,---  and --,---  are  predetermined,  the  difference  GMM 
18:431:36759:29:29:71:382:511:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:dynamic panel estimator uses the following moment conditions: 
18:432:36821:29:30:71:520:482:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6: -5--,--+∆4--7 = 0  for % ≥ 2; - = 3, ... , 	,           (8) 
18:433:36877:30:31:72:520:452:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6: -5--,--+∆4--7 = 0  for % ≥ 2; - = 3, ... , 	,      (9) 
18:434:36928:31:29:72:526:421:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6: -5--,--+∆4--7 = 0  for % ≥ 2; - = 3, ... , 	.     (10) 
18:435:36978:29:27:72:539:392:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6: Blundell  and  Bond  (1998)  point  out  a  statistical shortcoming  with  this  GMM  difference 
18:436:37075:27:28:72:539:365:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:estimator.  If  the  variables  are  persistent  over  time,  lagged  levels  of  these  variables  are  weak 
18:437:37185:28:27:72:540:337:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:instruments for the regression equation in differences. To avoid the imprecision associated with 
18:438:37282:27:28:72:539:310:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:this estimator, we will use the system GMM estimator as proposed in Arellano and Bover (1995) 
18:439:37376:28:27:72:539:282:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:and  Blundell  and  Bond  (1998).  This  system  estimator  combines  the  regression  in  differences 
18:440:37479:27:29:72:539:255:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:with the regression in levels. The instruments of the regression in levels are the lagged values of 
18:441:37579:29:29:71:539:226:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f6:∆--,---, ∆--,---, and ∆--,---. The validity of these instruments relies on the following additional 
18:442:37679:29:29:71:540:197:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:assumption:  The  first  differences  of --,---, --,---,  and --,---  are  uncorrelated  with  the  time-
18:443:37784:29:27:72:539:168:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:invariant  country-specific  effect  (3-),  but  their  levels  may  be  correlated  with 3-.  The  additional 
18:444:37895:27:29:72:303:141:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:moment conditions for the levels equations are: 
18:445:37943:29:31:72:526:112:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6: -5Δ--,---(3-+ 4--)7 = 0   for - = 3, ... , 	,         (11) 
18:446:37998:31:0:71:526:81:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6: -5Δ--,---(3-+ 4--)7 = 0   for - = 3, ... , 	,         (12) 
19:447:38056:0:29:72:542:707:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6: -5Δ--,---(3-+ 4--)7 = 0   for - = 3, ... , 	.         (13)  
19:448:38111:29:28:108:540:678:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Therefore,   the   system   GMM   uses   moment   conditions   (8)   through   (13)   to   obtain 
19:449:38209:28:27:72:543:650:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:consistent and efficient estimates of (0, 1, 2).10 To address the validity of the instrument list we 
19:450:38310:27:28:71:540:623:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:report  the  Hansen  test  for  over-identifying  restrictions,  which  tests  the  overall  validity  of  the 
19:451:38421:28:28:71:539:595:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:instruments by analyzing the sample analog of the moment conditions. Because we have a large 
19:452:38514:28:27:71:539:567:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:number of time periods we are concerned that the Hansen test may be weakened due to the large 
19:453:38608:27:28:71:542:540:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:instrument  collection  (see,  e.g.,  Roodman,  2009a). To  avoid  weakening  the  Hansen  test  we 
19:454:38708:28:28:71:539:512:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:“collapse”  the  instrument  list  as  suggested  in  Roodman  (2009b,  p.  107).  To  test  the  hypothesis 
19:455:38817:28:28:71:539:484:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:that  the  error  term 4--  is  not  serially  correlated  we  test  whether Δ4--  is  second-order  serially 
19:456:38927:28:27:72:539:456:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:correlated.  This  test  is  critical  not  only  for  the validity  of  one  of  the  assumptions  behind  the 
19:457:39039:27:29:72:542:429:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:estimator,  but  also  for (---− -[---])  in  (4)  to  truly  represent  a  shock.  Serially  uncorrelated 4--

19:459:39242:27:28:71:539:373:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:that  previous  unexpected  changes  and  previous  realizations  of  the  variables  cannot  be  used  to

19:465:39501:28:27:72:539:206:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:the first two columns report sets of estimates that assume strict exogeneity  of  all the right-hand

20:475:40310:28:28:71:540:651:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:exogenous).  The  difference  estimator  in  column  (3) uses  moment  conditions  analogous  to 
20:476:40407:28:28:71:540:623:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:equations  (7),  (8),  and  (9),  while  the  system  estimator  in  column  (4)  additionally  uses  moment 
20:477:40516:28:27:71:539:595:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:conditions  analogous  to  equations  (11),  (12),  and  (13).  The  validity  of  these  specifications  is 
20:478:40625:27:28:71:539:568:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:addressed  with  two  tests.  We  include  the  second  lag  of  the  dependent  variable  to  help  comply 
20:479:40733:28:28:71:540:540:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:with the assumption of no serial correlation of the estimators; in subsequent tables the second lag 
20:480:40833:28:28:71:540:512:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:is  also  included  in  the  estimations  for  the ---  and ---  equations  for  the  same  reason.  Across  all 
20:481:40946:28:28:71:540:484:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:GMM specifications we observe that the high p-values in the second-order serial correlation test

20:483:41155:27:28:71:539:429:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Moreover,  the  Hansen  test  of  over-identifying  restrictions  to  test  the  overall  validity  of  the 
20:484:41263:28:27:71:539:401:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:instruments shows that, across all specifications, the null hypothesis that the instruments are not 
20:485:41363:27:28:71:283:374:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:correlated with the residuals is not rejected. 
20:486:41410:28:28:107:539:346:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Notice  that  while  the  estimates  on  the  first  lagged  dependent  variable  are  consistently 
20:487:41510:28:27:72:539:318:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:above one, the long-run effect (which is typically the focus on convergence literature) is obtained 
20:488:41610:27:28:72:540:291:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:by summing the coefficients on all the lags of the dependent variable.  In  our case the sum is in 
20:489:41709:28:27:72:539:263:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:most cases less than one. This is a concern because if the sum is greater than one then there is a 
20:490:41808:27:28:72:543:236:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:unit  root  and  the  difference  GMM  estimator  will  not  be  able  to  identify  the  coefficients  on  the 
20:491:41920:28:28:72:540:208:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:lagged  dependent  variables  because  lagged  values  of ---	would  be  uncorrelated  with  its  first 
20:492:42023:28:28:72:540:180:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:differences.  This  is  another  reason  why  the  system GMM  is  our  preferred  estimator,  where  the 
20:493:42129:28:27:72:485:152:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:identification in this case would come from the levels equations (Equations 11 to 13).

21:495:42234:0:28:72:540:709:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6: Consistent with the Monte Carlo simulation results in Blundell et al. (2000), the estimate 
21:496:42325:28:28:72:539:681:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:on --- in the difference specification appears to be biased downwards. Blundell et al. (2000) find 
21:497:42424:28:28:71:539:653:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:that the bias is large when the regressor is persistent, which we will see is the case for --- once 
21:498:42524:28:28:72:540:625:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:we  estimate  equation  (2).  Columns  (6)  through  (8)  consider  our  measures  of  globalization

21:500:42732:28:27:72:540:569:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:potentially  endogenous.11  The  estimates  appear  robust  across  all  specifications;  the  exogenous 
21:501:42837:27:28:72:539:542:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:component  of  government  expenditures  has  a  negative  effect  on  output.  The  point  estimate  in 
21:502:42942:28:28:72:540:514:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:column  (5)  indicates  that  a  1%  increase  in  government  expenditures  to  GDP  decreases  real 
21:503:43044:28:27:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:income  per  capita  by  0.081%.  The  sign  of  this  coefficient  is  consistent  with  the  cross-section 
21:504:43153:27:28:72:539:459:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:studies by Barro (1991) and with Levine and Renelt (1992), but the latter finds that the negative 
21:505:43251:28:28:72:540:431:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:sign is not robust. The negative sign associated  with --- is also in line with the dynamic panels 
21:506:43350:28:28:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:by  Mollick  and  Cabral  (2011)  and  Cabral  and  Mollick  (2012).  The  estimates  in  Table  2  show 
21:507:43455:28:27:72:539:375:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:that  higher  investment-to-output  ratio  leads  to  higher  output  and  that  the  rate  of  population 
21:508:43562:27:28:72:540:348:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:growth  affects  output  negatively.  According  to  column  (5),  a  one  percent  increase  in  the 
21:509:43664:28:27:72:540:320:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:investment-to-output ratio leads to an increase in real output per capita by  0.016%, while  a one 
21:510:43763:27:28:72:540:293:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:percent  increase  in  the  rate  of  population  growth  decreases  real  output  per  capita  by  0.018%. 
21:511:43871:28:28:72:539:265:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Finally,  from  our  measures  of  globalization,  in  columns  (6)  and  (8)  international  financial

21:518:44367:12:12:72:540:111:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Instruments  for  the  first-differenced  equations  are ∆&--,  and  the  first  and  further  lags  of --,---, ---,  and %--.  The

21:520:44626:13:12:71:539:86:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:predetermined  invalidates --,---  and ∆---  as  instruments.  Hence,  the  instruments  formed  with ---  have  one 
21:521:44742:12:0:71:370:74:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:additional lag when compared to the ones based on the predetermined ---.

22:524:45022:28:28:71:539:653:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:expenditures  discussed  in  Equation  (2).  As  in  the  output  equation,  Table  3  also  reports  the 
22:525:45128:28:27:71:542:625:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Pooled  OLS  and  the  Within  estimates.  All  the  GMM  specifications  pass  both  tests:  the  Hansen 
22:526:45234:27:28:71:543:598:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:test  for  the  overall  validity  of  the  instrument  list  and  the  serial  correlation  test.  The  latter  also 
22:527:45352:28:28:71:540:570:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:validates  the  use  of (---− -[---])  as  the  unexpected  component  of  government  expenditures, 
22:528:45453:28:28:71:540:542:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:which cannot be predicted from previous realizations of variables and shocks. In this estimation 
22:529:45550:28:27:71:540:514:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:of  Equation  (2)  the  population  growth  is  treated  as  strictly  exogenous,  while  the  lagged  output 
22:530:45660:27:28:71:540:487:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:and lagged measures of openness are treated as predetermined. This is reasonable because all are 
22:531:45757:28:28:71:539:459:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:lagged  one  period  and  it  is  consistent  with  the  government  deciding ---  after  observing 
22:532:45857:28:28:72:539:431:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:government   expenditures   and   the   realizations   of   the   other   right-hand   side   variables.   A 
22:533:45966:28:29:72:539:403:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:predetermined  (or  weakly  exogenous) --,---  does  not  mean  that  governments  are  not  forward 
22:534:46067:29:28:72:540:374:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:looking.  They  may  have  their  own  beliefs  about ---  and  the  future  evolution  of  output,  which 
22:535:46174:28:27:72:326:346:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:under rational expectations is given by Equation (1).

22:538:46341:28:28:72:539:263:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:for ---  with  lagged  output  and  lagged  investment-to-output  ratio,  while  the  fourth  column 
22:539:46442:28:29:72:540:235:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:additionally  includes  lagged  population  growth &-,---.  Columns  five  through  seven  present  the 
22:540:46546:29:27:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:results  using  our  different  measures  of  openness.  Columns  five  and  six  appear  with  a  positive 
22:541:46654:27:28:72:539:179:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:and  statistically  significant  output  effect  on  government  expenditures.  A  statistically  significant 
22:542:46764:28:28:72:540:151:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:effect validates modeling --- as predetermined or endogenous in the estimation of Equation (1). 
22:543:46860:28:28:72:539:123:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:There is some evidence that population growth impacts negatively government expenditures; the 
22:544:46954:28:0:72:540:95:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:estimate  in  column  6  indicates  that  a  one  percent  increase  in  the  rate  of  population  growth 
23:545:47064:0:28:72:540:709:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:reduces  the  ratio  of  government  expenditures  to  GDP  by  0.004%.  Our  first  two  measures  of 
23:546:47167:28:28:72:540:681:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:globalization,  assets  related  globalization  and  equity  related  globalization  included  in  columns 
23:547:47274:28:27:72:539:653:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:(5)  and  (6),  respectively,  show  a  negative  effect  of  globalization  on  government  expenditures. 
23:548:47381:27:28:72:540:626:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:However,  trade  openness  reported  in  column  (7)  shows  a  positive  and  statistically  significant 
23:549:47487:28:27:72:105:598:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:effect. 
23:550:47495:27:29:72:540:571:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6: The  functional  form  in  the  estimates  in  Table  3  follows  directly  from  (2),  which  is 
23:551:47593:29:28:72:540:542:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:consistent with the feedback mechanism in Bun and Kiviet (2006) and treats &-,---	as exogenous 
23:552:47688:28:28:72:539:514:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:and the rest as predetermined. These specifications imply that government expenditures are set at 
23:553:47786:28:27:72:539:486:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:the  beginning  of  the  period  as  in  Tagkalakis  (2008)  and  respond  to  last  period's  realizations  of 
23:554:47898:27:28:72:539:459:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:the right-hand side variables. An alternative assumption is to model government expenditures as 
23:555:47994:28:27:72:539:431:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:jointly  determined  with  the  contemporaneous   right-hand  side  variables.  Different  sets  of 
23:556:48094:27:28:72:539:404:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:estimates  under  this  alternative  assumption  are  presented  in  Table  4.  The  previous  results  on 
23:557:48201:28:28:72:539:376:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Table  3  hold  but  now  all  globalization  measures  have  negative  effects:  a  higher  level  of 
23:558:48304:28:27:72:404:348:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:globalization contributes to lower government size, all else constant.

23:562:48456:27:28:107:540:238:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:After estimating (2) we use these results to construct estimates of the expected evolution

23:564:48641:28:28:71:540:182:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Table 5 provides the  results of the estimation of  (4) using two different specifications to obtain 
23:565:48742:28:27:71:539:154:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f6:-[---] and (---− -[---]). Columns 1 through 4 use the feedback mechanism reported in column 
23:566:48834:27:28:71:539:127:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:7,  Table  3,  while  columns  5  through  8  use  the  specification  in  column  7,  Table  4.  All  of  the 
23:567:48945:28:0:71:539:99:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:columns  in  Table  5  pass  both  specification  tests,  the  instrument  lists  are  validated  using  the 
24:568:49057:0:28:72:540:709:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Hansen  test,  while  the  serial  correlation  test  in  the  difference  equation  shows  strong  evidence 
24:569:49166:28:28:72:539:681:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:that the errors are not second-order serially correlated. The results show that when separating the 
24:570:49266:28:28:72:539:653:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:effect  of ---  on  output  in  two  (expected ---	and  unexpected ---)  the  latter  has  a  much  larger 
24:571:49373:28:28:72:539:625:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:negative  effect  on  output.  The  effect  of  expected ---  has  about  half  the  magnitude  and  it  is 
24:572:49481:28:28:71:540:597:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:negative  in  the  first  four  columns  and  positive  or not  statistically  significant  in  the  last  four 
24:573:49593:28:28:71:542:569:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:columns.  Column  1  indicates  that  a  one  percent  unexpected  increase  in --- decreases  output  by 
24:574:49699:28:28:71:539:541:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:0.072%,  while  a  one  percent  expected  increase  in ---  decreases  output  by  0.034%.  When 
24:575:49797:28:27:71:540:513:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:additionally  controlling  for  openness,  the  magnitude  of  the  coefficients  is  about  the  same.  The 
24:576:49906:27:28:71:540:486:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:last  row  in  Table  5  reports  the  p-values  for  the  test  of  the  null  hypothesis  that  the  effects  of 
24:577:50021:28:28:71:539:458:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:expected   and   unexpected ---   on   output   are   the   same.   The   p-values   of   zero   across   all 
24:578:50131:28:28:71:542:430:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:specifications provide strong evidence against the null. The rest of the estimates in this table are 
24:579:50232:28:27:71:540:402:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:largely consistent with the ones in Table 2, the ratio of investment to output has a positive effect 
24:580:50333:27:28:71:542:375:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:and  the  population  growth  has  a  negative  effect.  Moreover,  equity  related  globalization  has  a 
24:581:50440:28:27:71:542:347:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:significant positive effect and trade openness has a negative effect.

24:585:50722:28:28:71:540:236:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:becomes  available,  we  estimate  the  coefficients (0-, 1-, 2-)  to  obtain  estimates  of -[---]  and 
24:586:50827:28:28:71:539:208:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f6:(---− -[---])  recursively  as  specified  in  equations  (5)  and  (6).  When  implementing  this  more 
24:587:50932:28:28:72:539:180:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:realistic  estimation  strategy  we  assume  that  the  econometrician  has  the  same  information  set  as 
24:588:51041:28:28:72:540:152:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:the agents when they  form their expectations.  In  particular,  we  first estimate equation (2) using 
24:589:51144:28:28:72:539:124:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:data available only from 1970 to 1975. Once we estimate the coefficients (0FG, 1FG, 2FG) we use 
24:590:51240:28:0:72:540:96:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:them to separate next period --,FH into -[--,FH] and (--,FH− -[--,FH]). When an additional period 
25:591:51341:0:28:72:539:708:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:of data becomes available we estimate (0FH, 1FH, 2FH) using the observations from 1970 to 1976 
25:592:51436:28:29:72:542:680:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:and then obtain -[--,FF] and (--,FF− -[--,FF]). We repeat this iterative process until the data are 
25:593:51536:29:28:71:540:651:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:exhausted, so we have sequences I-[---]J and I---− -[---]J that go from 1976 through 2004 for

25:597:51772:28:28:71:540:539:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:recursively using the process just described. The results are very similar to the ones in Table 5.

25:604:52381:28:27:71:540:343:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:unexpected  increase  in ---  decreases  output  by  0.111%.  Comparing  the  magnitude  of  the 
25:605:52478:27:28:72:539:316:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:coefficients  in  Tables  5  and  6  we  can  observe  that the  recursive  treatment  of  expectations 
25:606:52582:28:28:72:539:288:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:increases slightly the magnitude of the unexpected components in columns (1) to (4), while the 
25:607:52677:28:27:72:539:260:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:expected   component   has   now   a   negative   and   statistically   significant   effect   across   all 
25:608:52785:27:28:72:539:233:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:specifications.  The  rest  of  the  coefficients  have  the  expected  signs  and  are  consistent  with 
25:609:52891:28:27:72:335:205:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:previous results, including the globalization measures. 
25:610:52947:27:28:72:539:178:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6: An  additional  set  of  estimates  is  reported  in  Table  7,  where  the  goal  is  to  test  for 
25:611:53048:28:0:72:539:150:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:differences  in  the  effects  of  unexpected ---  on  output  between  developed  (22  economies)  and 
26:612:53155:0:28:72:542:708:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:emerging  markets  (34  economies).12  The  key  result  obtained  previously  holds:  unexpected --- 
26:613:53256:28:28:71:539:680:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:has  a  negative  and  larger  effect  on  output  than  expected ---.  Moreover,  the  negative  effect  of 
26:614:53365:28:28:71:539:652:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:unexpected ---  appears  to  be  much  larger  for  developed  economics;  however,  this  result  is  not 
26:615:53472:28:28:71:539:624:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:robust to different specifications of the government equation. The indicator variable \bK8L is equal 
26:616:53573:28:28:71:539:596:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:to  one  if  the  country  is  developed  and  equal  to  zero  otherwise.  Hence,  the  coefficient  on  the 
26:617:53683:28:28:71:539:568:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:interaction  term (---− -[---]) × \bK8L  captures  the  differential  effect  of  the  unexpected ---  on 
26:618:53788:28:28:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:output. The estimates in column 5, for example, indicate that an unexpected one percent increase 
26:619:53885:28:27:72:543:512:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:in ---  leads  to  a  decrease  in  output  in  emerging  economies  by  0.055%,  but  to  a  much  larger 
26:620:53992:27:28:72:502:485:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:decrease in developed economies, 0.213% (adding the coefficients of -0.055 and -0.158). 
26:621:54080:28:28:272:343:457:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:[Table 7 here] 
26:622:54095:28:27:72:539:429:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6: Tagkalakis (2008) found that spending shocks have more pronounced effects in bad times 
26:623:54182:27:28:72:540:402:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:in  the  case  of  the  low  loan-to-value  group,  which  is  evidence  for  the  important  role  that  fiscal 
26:624:54295:28:27:72:539:374:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:policy  plays  in  periods  of  economic  distress  in  less  financially  developed  economies.  In  our 
26:625:54401:27:28:72:540:347:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:estimates   of   Table   7   unexpected   government   purchases   have   larger   negative   effects   for 
26:626:54509:28:28:72:540:319:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:developed economies in columns (5) to (8). We further regress --- on GDP growth and controls 
26:627:54602:28:28:72:540:291:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:in an alternative specification to (2).13 Table 8 contains this alternative and reports GDP growth-
26:628:54701:28:28:72:542:263:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:coefficients  varying  from  -0.910  (with  the  trade  openness  measure)  to  -0.952  (with  the \b-\b 
26:629:54805:28:28:71:539:235:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:measure) for industrial economies. This suggests a relatively strong countercyclical response: as 
26:630:54903:28:28:71:540:207:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:real GDP falls, fiscal policy appears to be very expansionary (either by increases in - or by tax

26:636:55377:10:7:71:119:108:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:economies. 
26:637:55388:7:15:71:539:101:6:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:13 This can be accomplished by differencing (1) and re-estimating the equation with output growth as the dependent 
26:638:55503:15:12:72:540:86:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:variable  on  lagged  GDP  and  current  government  expenditures  and  controls.  In  the  same  way,  we  can  regress 
26:639:55624:12:0:72:372:74:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:government expenditures on GDP growth and controls for a variant of (2). 
27:640:55700:0:28:72:540:709:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:financial globalization measures). In emerging markets, the two financial globalization measures 
27:641:55797:28:28:72:539:681:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:have  a  negative  but  small  effect  on -/-.  Higher  openness  implies  lower  government  size,  all

27:644:56015:27:28:72:539:598:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:that  fiscal  policy  does  not  respond  as  much  to  GDP growth  in  emerging  markets,  perhaps 
27:645:56115:28:27:72:540:570:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:because of a longer lag between fiscal policy decisions and implementation by federal, state, and 
27:646:56213:27:28:72:539:543:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:local  governments  in  developing  economies.  Recent  evidence  along  these  lines,  yet  with  an 
27:647:56315:28:28:72:539:515:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:alternative  theoretical  framework  than  the  one  in  this  paper,  is  provided  by  Byrne  et  al.  (2011)

27:651:56732:27:28:72:478:405:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:emerging markets do not appear to be able to run deficits when there are downturns.

27:655:56853:28:27:107:539:294:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:We  model  the  dynamic  feedback  between  government  expenditures  and  output  in  a 
27:656:56942:27:28:71:539:267:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:rational  expectations  model  along  the  lines  of  Barro  (1977).  Allowing  agents  to  behave 
27:657:57041:28:28:71:540:239:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:dynamically,  we  find  that  unexpected  government  expenditures  affect  output  negatively  and 
27:658:57141:28:28:71:540:211:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:expected government expenditures have negative, yet smaller, effects. The --* measure of FDI 
27:659:57234:28:27:72:539:183:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:and  equity  flows  has  a  positive  impact  on  output.  When  allowing  agents  to  update  their  beliefs 
27:660:57344:27:28:72:539:156:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:about the data-generating process, we find that the positive output effects of globalization remain 
27:661:57444:28:28:72:540:128:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:with the FDI and equity measure of financial globalization. The survey by Bergh and Henrekson 
27:662:57538:28:0:72:540:100:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:(2011)  on  the  size  of  government  and  economic  growth  suggests  a  significant  negative 
28:663:57638:0:28:72:540:709:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:correlation  in  most  recent  studies:  an  increase  in government  size  by  10%  is  associated  with  a 
28:664:57747:28:28:72:543:681:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:0.5% to 1% lower annual economic growth rate. The results in this paper are much closer to the 
28:665:57842:28:27:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:upper range of these figures. Overall, the negative effects found herein for 56 major economies 
28:666:57938:27:28:72:540:626:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:of  the  world  from  1970  to  2004  are  consistent  with Barro  (2010),  who  reports  government 
28:667:58039:28:27:72:539:598:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:spending multipliers substantially less than one for the U.S. experience. Ramey (2011) suggests a 
28:668:58137:27:28:72:539:571:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:range of plausible estimates for the government multiplier in the case of a temporary increase in 
28:669:58235:28:28:72:539:543:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:G  that  is  deficit  financed  (not  accompanied  by  an  increase  in  taxes)  to  be  probably  from  0.8  to 
28:670:58348:28:27:72:540:515:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:1.5. Our estimates for a panel of countries from 1970-2004 are more in line with a lower than 1 
28:671:58444:27:28:72:214:488:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:magnitude for the multiplier. 
28:672:58474:28:27:108:540:460:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:We   also   provide   evidence   that   the   negative   effect   of   unexpected   government 
28:673:58569:27:28:72:540:433:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:expenditures  on  output  is  much  larger  in  developed economies.  While  Tagkalakis  (2008) 
28:674:58665:28:28:72:543:405:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:recently proposed a liquidity constraint channel, his analysis was confined to OECD economies. 
28:675:58760:28:27:72:539:377:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Giavazzi  et  al.  (2000)  compare  OECD  countries  with a  larger  dataset  of  developing  economies 
28:676:58864:27:28:72:540:350:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:and  find  that  national  savings  are  more  responsive to  government  consumption  in  the  former 
28:677:58967:28:27:72:543:322:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:(coefficient of -0.735) than in the latter (-0.493). Byrne et al. (2011) have also recently suggested 
28:678:59069:27:28:72:539:295:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:by  system  GMM  the  ability  of  industrial  countries  to  go  into  debt  when  there  is  an  economic 
28:679:59177:28:28:72:539:267:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:downturn;  on  the  other  hand,  emerging  markets  do  not  appear  to  be  able  to  run  deficits  when 
28:680:59285:28:27:72:539:239:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:there are downturns in the economy. Svec and Kondo (2012) find across U.S. states that a more 
28:681:59379:27:28:72:540:212:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:counter-cyclical  primary  deficit  increases  state’s long-run  average  growth  rate  per  capita. 
28:682:59480:28:27:72:540:184:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Together  with  the  sensitivity  of  savings,  our  most likely  explanation  is  that  government 
28:683:59580:27:28:72:539:157:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:expenditures respond differently across the two groups of countries to the business cycles: as real 
28:684:59680:28:28:72:539:129:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:GDP  falls,  fiscal  policy  is  found  to  be  expansionary  in  industrial  economies.  The  same  figures 
28:685:59789:28:0:72:539:101:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:for  emerging  markets  are  much  smaller,  perhaps  because  of  longer  lags  associated  with  fiscal 
29:686:59898:0:28:72:539:709:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:policy  actions.  We  take  our  results  as  evidence  that  fiscal  policy  does  not  respond  as  much  to 
29:687:60009:28:28:72:241:681:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:GDP growth in emerging markets.
