3:75:4791:0:31:89:202:709:206:g_d0_f3:206:g_d0_f3:C:1  Introduction
3:76:4806:31:16:106:523:678:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Record foreclosure rates and reduced aggregate demand during the Great Recession
3:77:4886:16:16:89:522:662:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:sparked a vigorous policy debate about how to decrease defaults and increase consumption
3:78:4974:16:17:89:522:646:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:of struggling borrowers. Former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has explained that
3:79:5060:17:16:89:522:629:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:the government’s “biggest debate was whether to try to reduce overall mortgage loans or
3:80:5147:16:17:89:522:613:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:just monthly payments” (Geithner 2014). A wide range of economists have argued that
3:81:5230:17:16:89:522:596:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:failing to address debt levels by permanently forgiving mortgage principal was a missed
3:82:5317:16:17:89:522:580:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:opportunity and one of the biggest policy mistakes of the Great Recession.1Others have
3:83:5403:17:16:89:522:563:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:argued instead that if borrowers are liquidity constrained, focusing on short-term payment
3:84:5493:16:16:89:411:547:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:reductions is more cost e-ective (Eberly and Krishnamurthy 2014).
3:85:5558:16:17:106:523:531:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:The normative policy debate hinges on fundamental economic questions about the rel-
3:86:5641:17:16:89:523:514:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:ative e-ect of short- vs long-term debt obligations. For default, the underlying question
3:87:5730:16:17:89:522:498:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:is whether it is primarily driven by a lack of cash to make payments in the short-term or
3:88:5819:17:16:89:522:481:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:whether it is a response to the total burden of long-term debt obligations, sometimes known
3:89:5910:16:17:89:522:465:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:as “strategic default.”  For consumption, the underlying question is whether underwater
3:90:5997:17:16:89:522:448:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:borrowers have a high marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of either changes in total
3:91:6086:16:17:89:522:432:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:housing wealth or changes in immediate cash-flow.2A broad literature evaluates the e-ects
3:92:6175:17:16:89:522:415:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:of changes in debt obligations that simultaneously reduce both short-term and long-term
3:93:6262:16:16:89:522:399:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:payments and consistently shows that debt obligations matter.3Reducing payments leads
3:94:6347:16:17:89:522:383:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:to decreased defaults and increased consumption. However, to fully understand the e-ect of
3:95:6437:17:16:89:522:366:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:debt on borrower decisions and to inform the debate about liquidity- versus wealth-focused
3:96:6527:16:17:89:523:350:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:interventions, it is essential to separately estimate the e-ect of short-term and long-term
3:97:6618:17:16:89:166:333:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:debt reductions.
3:98:6634:16:17:106:523:317:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:We fill this void by exploiting two natural experiments to separately identify the impact
3:99:6723:17:16:89:522:300:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:of reducing long-term obligations without changing short-term payments (“wealth”), and
3:100:6809:16:16:89:521:284:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:reducing short-term payments without changing long-term obligations (“liquidity”).We
3:101:6893:16:17:89:522:268:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:find that mortgage principal reduction that increases housing wealth without a-ecting liq-
3:102:6983:17:16:89:522:251:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:uidity has no significant impact on default or consumption for underwater borrowers. In
3:103:7070:16:17:89:522:235:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:contrast, we show that maturity extension, which immediately reduces payments but leaves
3:104:7158:17:16:89:521:218:119:g_d0_f4:64:g_d0_f5:B:long-term obligations approximately unchanged, does significantly reduce default rates.4
3:105:7246:16:17:89:522:202:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:Taken together, these results suggest that liquidity is the key driver of borrower default and
3:106:7340:17:16:89:522:185:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:consumption decisions. Furthermore, we show that this lesson can be used to inform the
3:107:7426:16:16:89:523:169:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:e-cient design of distressed debt restructurings, with the potential for substantial gains to

3:109:7618:15:11:89:522:138:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:Koniak (2009) argued that a plan to reduce payments and leave principal unchanged “wastes taxpayer
3:110:7716:11:7:89:511:127:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:money and won’t fix the problem.” See also Feldstein (2009), Romer (2011), and Mian and Sufi (2014b).

3:114:8096:7:15:101:522:87:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:4Although our research designs are underpowered for estimating the causal e-ect of payment reductions
3:115:8197:15:0:89:480:72:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:on consumption, we provide suggestive evidence that payment reductions also increase spending.

4:117:8326:17:16:106:522:692:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Our first natural experiment allows us to isolate the e-ect of wealth by comparing under-
4:118:8415:16:17:89:522:676:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:water borrowers who receive two types of modifications in the federal government’s Home

4:120:8589:16:17:89:522:643:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:ment reductions for the first five years.  However, one group also receives an average of
4:121:8678:17:16:89:522:626:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:$67,000 in mortgage principal forgiveness, which translates into long-term payment relief.
4:122:8768:16:17:89:522:610:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:Because borrowers remain slightly underwater even after substantial principal forgiveness,

4:124:8949:16:16:89:522:577:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:ment of borrowers to each of these modification types, we isolate the e-ects of long-term
4:125:9038:16:17:89:305:561:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:debt levels holding fixed short-term liquidity.
4:126:9085:17:16:106:522:544:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Our second natural experiment exploits an eligibility cuto-rule for HAMP that gen-
4:127:9167:16:17:89:522:528:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:erates the opposite treatment: an increase in liquidity with approximately no change in
4:128:9254:17:16:89:523:511:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:wealth. Borrowers above the cuto-receive small payment reductions from HAMP while
4:129:9335:16:17:89:522:495:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:borrowers below the cuto-are ineligible for the government program but receive larger
4:130:9420:17:16:89:522:478:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:payment reductions through alternative private sector modifications. Government program
4:131:9507:16:16:89:522:462:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:rules prohibit the private sector from o-ering these alternative modifications to eligible bor-
4:132:9602:16:17:89:522:446:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:rowers above the cuto-under the (erroneous) assumption that the government-subsidized
4:133:9687:17:16:89:523:429:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:modifications would always be more e-ective.  The private sector finances these deeper
4:134:9773:16:17:89:522:413:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:payment reductions by first extending mortgage maturities prior to additional modification
4:135:9863:17:16:89:522:396:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:steps, such that larger immediate payment reductions are o-set by continued payments in
4:136:9950:16:17:89:522:380:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:the long term. This restructuring leaves the net present value of total mortgage payments
4:137:10039:17:16:89:522:363:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:owed approximately unchanged. By comparing borrowers on either side of this cuto-we
4:138:10122:16:16:89:476:347:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:isolate the e-ect of immediate liquidity provision holding fixed long-term wealth.
4:139:10204:16:17:106:523:331:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:To study these natural experiments we build two new datasets with information on
4:140:10284:17:16:89:522:314:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:borrower outcomes and program participation. Our first dataset matches administrative
4:141:10369:16:17:89:522:298:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:data on HAMP participants to monthly consumer credit bureau records. We exploit detailed
4:142:10457:17:16:89:522:281:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:account-level information to construct a novel measure of consumer spending based on
4:143:10541:16:17:89:522:265:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:monthly credit card expenditures.  We also followDiMaggio et al. (2017)by using new
4:144:10624:17:16:89:522:248:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:auto loan originations as a proxy for durable consumption. Our second dataset uses de-
4:145:10710:16:17:89:522:232:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:identified mortgage and credit card data from the JPMorgan Chase Institute (JPMCI).It
4:146:10795:17:16:89:522:215:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:includes monthly information on all borrowers whose mortgages are serviced by Chase and
4:147:10882:16:16:89:522:199:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:who receive either a government-subsidized modification through HAMP or an alternative
4:148:10968:16:17:89:522:183:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:private modification. Our samples from both datasets are similar on observable borrower
4:149:11055:17:16:89:160:166:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:characteristics.
4:150:11071:16:17:106:523:150:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Our empirical analysis proceeds in three steps. First, we estimate the causal impact of
4:151:11158:17:16:89:522:133:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:principal reduction on default by exploiting a cuto-rule in borrower assignment to the two
4:152:11248:16:17:89:522:117:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:HAMP modification types. Mortgage servicers evaluated underwater applicants for both
4:153:11332:17:16:89:522:100:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:modification types by calculating the expected gain to investors under either option using
4:154:11422:16:0:89:522:84:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:a standard government-supplied formula. There is a sharp 41 percentage point jump in the
5:155:11511:0:17:89:522:709:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:probability that a borrower receives principal reduction when the calculation shows that
5:156:11599:17:16:89:522:692:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:principal reduction is marginally more beneficial to investors. We exploit this jump with a
5:157:11690:16:17:89:488:676:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:regression discontinuity estimator comparing borrowers on either side of this cuto-.
5:158:11774:17:16:106:522:659:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:We find that principal reduction has no e-ect on default. Despite a $30,000 increase in
5:159:11861:16:17:89:523:643:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:principal forgiveness in the treatment group at the cuto-(translating to an 11 percentage

5:161:12042:16:17:89:522:610:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:late that even at the upper bound of our confidence interval, the government spent $556,000
5:162:12133:17:16:89:522:593:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:per avoided foreclosure. This cost is over an order of magnitude greater than estimates of
5:163:12223:16:16:89:522:577:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:the social cost of foreclosures (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development 2010).
5:164:12311:16:17:106:523:561:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:In the second step of our empirical analysis we examine the causal impact of principal
5:165:12397:17:16:89:522:544:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:reduction on consumption. Our preferred empirical strategy for analyzing consumption is
5:166:12484:16:17:89:523:528:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:a panel di-erence-in-di-erences estimator which is more precise than our regression discon-
5:167:12575:17:16:89:522:511:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:tinuity strategy.5We compare HAMP borrowers who receive principal reductions to other
5:168:12660:16:17:89:522:495:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:HAMP borrowers who receive only payment reductions. We find that an average of $67,000
5:169:12746:17:16:89:522:478:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:in principal reduction has no significant impact on underwater borrowers’ credit card or auto
5:170:12839:16:16:89:522:462:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:expenditure. Translating our results into an annual MPC for total consumption, our point
5:171:12927:16:17:89:522:446:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:estimate is that borrowers increased consumption by three-tenths of one cent per dollar of
5:172:13017:17:16:89:419:429:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:principal reduction, with an upper bound of eight-tenths of one cent.
5:173:13086:16:17:106:523:413:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:In the third step of our empirical analysis we estimate the causal impact of immediate
5:174:13172:17:16:89:522:396:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:payment reductions on default.  This analysis exploits HAMP’s eligibility cuto-using a
5:175:13258:16:17:89:522:380:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:regression discontinuity design.  There is an 18 percentage point jump in the amount of
5:176:13345:17:16:89:522:363:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:payment reduction received by borrowers with private modifications just below the cut-
5:177:13431:16:16:89:522:347:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:o-. Although there is a large change in immediate liquidity at the cuto-, because these
5:178:13518:16:17:89:522:331:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:deeper payment reductions are largely financed by extending mortgage maturities there is
5:179:13606:17:16:89:472:314:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:no significant change in the net present value of total long-term payments owed.
5:180:13686:16:17:106:522:298:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:In contrast to our results on the ine-ectiveness of principal reduction, we find that
5:181:13771:17:16:89:522:281:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:immediate payment reduction significantly reduces default rates. Default rates fall sharply
5:182:13862:16:17:89:522:265:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:by six percentage points at the cuto-from a control mean of 32 percentage points, implying
5:183:13952:17:16:89:522:248:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:that a one percent payment reduction reduces default rates by about one percent. While
5:184:14038:16:17:89:522:232:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:our data and available research designs are unsuited for credibly estimating the causal e-ect
5:185:14131:17:16:89:522:215:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:of immediate payment reduction on consumption, we provide suggestive evidence from the
5:186:14217:16:16:89:522:199:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:timeseries pattern of spending around modification that spending also rises when monthly
5:187:14305:16:17:89:156:183:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:payments fall.
5:188:14319:17:16:106:523:166:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Combining the three steps of our empirical analysis, the central contribution of this paper
5:189:14410:16:17:89:522:150:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:is to disentangle the e-ects of liquidity and wealth on mortgagor outcomes. Disentangling
5:190:14499:17:16:89:522:133:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:these e-ects allows us to draw two types of lessons. First, from a positive perspective, we
5:191:14590:16:16:89:522:117:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:shed light on the mechanisms underlying the previously-documented relationships between
5:192:14677:16:15:101:522:101:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:5We also report estimates from the regression discontinuity design and show that this strategy is statis-
5:193:14782:15:0:89:398:86:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:tically and economically uninformative for analyzing consumption outcomes.
6:194:14857:0:17:89:522:709:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:housing wealth, housing debt, default, and consumption. Second, from a normative perspec-
6:195:14946:17:16:89:523:692:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:tive, we use these results to inform the debate about the e-cient structure of re-negotiations
6:196:15040:16:17:89:184:676:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:during a debt crisis.
6:197:15061:17:16:106:523:659:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:For default, we show that the strong cross-sectional relationship between leverage and
6:198:15147:16:17:89:522:643:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:default is not causal for underwater borrowers. Instead of borrowers defaulting for strategic
6:199:15240:17:16:89:521:626:119:g_d0_f4:64:g_d0_f5:B:reasons, we find that borrower default decisions are based primarily on immediate liquidity.6
6:200:15333:16:17:89:522:610:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:The cross-sectional evidence may have been misleading because borrowers with less equity
6:201:15421:17:16:89:522:593:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:purchased homes near the height of the credit boom and were less creditworthy on other
6:202:15507:16:16:89:522:577:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:dimensions (Palmer 2015), or because the large price reductions that left many borrowers
6:203:15595:16:17:89:522:561:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:underwater were also correlated with other omitted economic shocks that themselves could
6:204:15683:17:16:89:375:544:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:be responsible for higher default rates (Adelino et al. 2016).
6:205:15745:16:17:106:522:528:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:From a specific policy perspective, our default results suggest a significant ine-ciency
6:206:15833:17:16:89:523:511:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:at the HAMP eligibility cuto-.  The government spent substantial resources subsidizing
6:207:15919:16:17:89:522:495:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:HAMP modifications above the cuto-with small payment reductions and high default rates,
6:208:16006:17:16:89:522:478:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:whereas borrowers below the cuto-received private modifications requiring no government
6:209:16093:16:16:89:522:462:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:assistance, which had large payment reductions and low default rates.  In fact, there is
6:210:16181:16:17:89:522:446:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f6:B:likely a Pareto improvement for borrowers, lenders, and taxpayers from shifting the cuto-
6:211:16270:17:16:89:522:429:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:such that fewer borrowers receive HAMP and more borrowers receive private modifications.
6:212:16358:16:17:89:522:413:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:We find that 40 percent of HAMP borrowers are in the region where a private alternative,
6:213:16446:17:16:89:522:396:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:such as the one we study, would have provided deeper payment reductions and led to
6:214:16528:16:17:89:522:380:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:reduced default rates. Government rules prohibiting servicers from o-ering these private
6:215:16616:17:16:89:522:363:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:bilateral alternatives based on the assumption that proprietary modifications could not be
6:216:16706:16:16:89:522:347:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:as e-ective as those subsidized by the government may have crowded out more e-ective
6:217:16790:16:17:89:522:331:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:modifications for these borrowers. Our finding that payment reductions can be structured
6:218:16878:17:16:89:522:314:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:so as to reduce default rates while leaving all parties better o-contrasts sharply with our
6:219:16969:16:17:89:522:298:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:finding for principal reduction, which was ine-ective for borrowers even while being costly
6:220:17060:17:16:89:235:281:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:to both lenders and taxpayers.
6:221:17090:16:17:106:523:265:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:From a broader policy perspective, this lesson can be used to characterize the default-
6:222:17177:17:16:89:522:248:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:minimizing modification structure for all borrowers.  Since immediate liquidity provision
6:223:17266:16:17:89:522:232:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:reduces default rates but long-term wealth does not, the e-cient modification structure
6:224:17353:17:16:89:522:215:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:maximizes short-term liquidity provision, in the spirit of Eberly and Krishnamurthy (2014).
6:225:17444:16:16:89:522:199:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:We trace out the default-minimizing modification frontier and find the potential for sub-
6:226:17533:16:17:89:333:183:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:stantial gains to borrowers, lenders, and taxpayers.
6:227:17585:17:16:106:522:166:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:We consider two ways to quantify the potential gains of more e-cient modifications
6:228:17667:16:17:89:522:150:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:relative to the type of restructurings previously pursued. First, we calculate that the median
6:229:17761:17:16:89:522:133:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:amount of payment reduction in HAMP could have been provided at a $63,000 lower cost
6:230:17845:16:17:89:522:117:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:per modification to lenders and taxpayers (a savings of 26 percent of the unpaid balance),
6:231:17935:17:14:101:522:100:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:6Our results are consistent with the default rate mechanically increasing once borrowers move from
6:232:18033:14:11:89:523:86:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:positive to negative equity, since this has a large negative liquidity e-ect. Above water borrowers can avoid
6:233:18142:11:0:89:456:75:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:default by selling their home or borrowing against their home (Gupta and Hansman 2018).

7:235:18321:17:16:89:522:692:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:modifications. Alternatively, if modifications maximized the amount of payment reduction
7:236:18409:16:17:89:522:676:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:while holding costs fixed, it would have been possible to cut default rates by one-third,
7:237:18498:17:16:89:428:659:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:avoiding 240,000 defaults at no additional cost to lenders or taxpayers.
7:238:18570:16:17:106:523:643:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:For consumption, we show that the tight link between housing wealth and consumption
7:239:18653:17:16:89:522:626:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:breaks down when borrowers are underwater. Our estimated MPC out of housing wealth
7:240:18735:16:17:89:522:610:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:for underwater borrowers is an order of magnitude smaller than the MPC for average home-
7:241:18823:17:16:89:523:593:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:owners examined in prior studies.7Furthermore, prior research has found high-leverage
7:242:18908:16:16:89:522:577:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:borrowers appear to be even more responsive. Mian et al. (2013) find that households living
7:243:18999:16:17:89:522:561:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:in zip codes with average loan-to-value (LTV) ratios above 90 have MPCs that are twice that
7:244:19090:17:16:89:522:544:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:of the median household, translating into an MPC of 18 cents. This result has been used
7:245:19177:16:17:89:522:528:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:by policy advocates arguing in favor of principal reduction for underwater borrowers (Gold-
7:246:19268:17:16:89:522:511:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:farb 2012). However, our evidence suggests that borrowers who are far underwater have
7:247:19353:16:17:89:522:495:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:much lower MPCs out of housing wealth, rendering principal reductions for these borrowers
7:248:19442:17:16:89:139:478:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:ine-ective.
7:249:19453:16:16:106:523:462:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:We argue that the inability of underwater borrowers to monetize the wealth gains from
7:250:19538:16:17:89:522:446:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:principal reduction can explain why they are far less sensitive to housing wealth changes than
7:251:19632:17:16:89:522:429:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:borrowers in other economic conditions. Typically, housing wealth gains expand borrowers’
7:252:19721:16:17:89:522:413:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:credit access (Mian and Sufi 2014a). But if homeowners face a collateral constraint, principal
7:253:19815:17:16:89:522:396:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:reduction that still leaves borrowers underwater or nearly underwater will not immediately
7:254:19905:16:17:89:523:380:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:relax this constraint, which may explain why principal reduction is ine-ective. We develop
7:255:19995:17:16:89:522:363:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:a partial-equilibrium life cycle model to formally analyze whether a delay in being able to
7:256:20086:16:16:89:523:347:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:access housing wealth can explain why consumption is una-ected by principal reduction.
7:257:20172:16:17:89:522:331:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:The model shows that collateral constraints drive a wedge between the MPC out of cash and
7:258:20261:17:16:89:522:314:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:the MPC out of housing wealth for underwater borrowers. Thus, policies to increase housing
7:259:20351:16:17:89:522:298:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:wealth are unable to stimulate demand when borrowers are so far underwater that home
7:260:20435:17:16:89:522:281:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:equity gains fail to relax binding collateral constraints, which was precisely the situation
7:261:20527:16:17:89:270:265:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:when such policies were implemented.

7:272:21444:15:11:89:522:97:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:rowers. In contrast to our findings, they find that reducing future payments by 8 percent of the total debt
7:273:21551:11:11:89:522:86:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:owed leads to a reduction in short-term default of 1.6 percentage points. When scaled to to an equivalent
7:274:21656:11:0:89:522:75:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:treatment size, this is larger than our point estimate but within our confidence interval. One possible expla-

8:276:21854:17:16:89:522:692:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:term and long-term payment reductions. We complement their findings by separating the

8:278:22024:17:16:89:522:659:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:term payment reductions are largely responsible for the program’s e-ects. This allows us
8:279:22112:16:17:89:522:643:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:to identify the underlying mechanisms driving borrower responses to debt reductions and

8:284:22489:16:17:89:522:561:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:debt levels and consumption when debt is modeled as a long-term contract (Kaplan et al.

8:286:22663:16:17:89:522:528:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:deleveraging of short-term debt leads to depressed consumption during a credit crunch

8:288:22838:16:17:89:522:495:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:nothing forces borrowers to immediately delever when they are far underwater, removing a

8:297:23478:30:16:106:523:325:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:We use two datasets.  Our first dataset matches administrative HAMP participation
8:298:23559:16:17:89:522:309:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:data to consumer credit bureau records. This dataset covers a broad sample population
8:299:23644:17:16:89:522:292:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:and allows us to carefully analyze the mechanisms assigning borrowers to each modification
8:300:23734:16:17:89:522:276:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:type in HAMP, which we exploit to estimate the impact of principal reduction. Our second
8:301:23822:17:16:89:522:259:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:dataset comes from a bank that is also a servicer that o-ers both government-subsidized
8:302:23909:16:17:89:522:243:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:HAMP modifications as well as private modifications. This allows us to analyze variation
8:303:23997:17:16:89:522:226:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:in immediate payment reduction between public and private modifications and to examine

9:341:26956:17:16:89:522:248:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:acteristics. Online Appendix Table 1 reports summary statistics for our sample before and
9:342:27045:16:17:89:522:232:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:after the credit bureau match. This table shows that borrower characteristics are similar
9:343:27134:17:16:89:523:215:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:in the matched sample. The final column shows that the di-erence in means for any char-
9:344:27221:16:16:89:522:199:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:acteristic is less than one-fifth of a standard deviation.  For our regression discontinuity

9:347:27504:11:11:89:522:157:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:distinguish between new purchases, interest charges, and fees in this dataset. In the bank dataset described
9:348:27612:11:7:89:425:146:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:in Section 2.2 we can isolate purchases and confirm that our results are unchanged.
9:349:27695:7:14:98:522:139:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:11Our match rate is less than 100 percent due to rounding and changing reporting requirements. The
9:350:27793:14:11:89:522:125:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:main data limitation is that pre-modification principal balance and monthly payment fields are rounded in
9:351:27898:11:11:89:522:114:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:the Treasury HAMP file, which introduces a discrepancy between the same loans in both files. Another
9:352:27998:11:11:89:522:103:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:limitation is that the Treasury file required new reporting processes for participating servicers, and the
9:353:28104:11:11:89:522:92:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:reporting requirements changed several times as the program developed. As a result, Treasury explains that
9:354:28210:11:0:89:465:81:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:there are occasional inaccuracies in the underlying data (U.S. Department of Treasury 2014).

10:357:28475:16:17:89:522:676:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:this is the case in online Appendix Figure 1. In Section 4.2 we show that our consumption

10:359:28654:16:17:89:522:643:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:of borrowers in the bank dataset, which does not rely on matching and is described in the

10:364:28960:17:16:89:522:544:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:The dataset covers 2009 to 2016. We focus on two subsamples of borrowers. The sample we
10:365:29047:16:17:89:522:528:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:use as a robustness check to study the e-ect of principal reduction on consumption includes
10:366:29138:17:16:89:522:511:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:all HAMP borrowers with both a mortgage and a credit card with Chase. We observe credit
10:367:29225:16:16:89:445:495:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:card spending for 22,924 borrowers one year before and after modification.
10:368:29299:16:17:106:523:479:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:The sample we use to study the e-ect of payment reduction includes all borrowers who
10:369:29383:17:16:89:522:462:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:receive either a government-subsidized HAMP or private modification. This includes 60,000
10:370:29472:16:17:89:522:446:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:mortgages owned or securitized by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the GSEs) and 86,000
10:371:29554:17:16:89:522:429:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:mortgages which are owned or have been securitized by Chase.  We limit the sample to
10:372:29638:16:17:89:522:413:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:modifications performed in the fourth quarter of 2011 or later, when the particular versions
10:373:29730:17:16:89:523:396:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:of the private programs we study were su-ciently established.12We analyze the impacts
10:374:29815:16:28:89:434:380:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:on GSE-backed and non-GSE-backed mortgages separately in Section 5.

10:376:29924:30:16:106:521:322:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:In this section we analyze the e-ect of principal reduction on borrower default.We
10:377:30006:16:17:89:522:306:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:compare borrowers who received two di-erent types of government-subsidized modifications,
10:378:30095:17:16:89:522:289:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:with both types receiving identical short-term payment reductions but one type receiving
10:379:30183:16:17:89:522:273:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:additional principal reduction. Using a regression discontinuity empirical strategy we find
10:380:30274:17:16:89:522:256:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:that substantial principal reductions have no e-ect. We can rule out prior cross-sectional
10:381:30364:16:23:89:320:240:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:estimates that were used to justify the program.

10:383:30480:17:26:119:277:200:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:C:able Modification Program
10:384:30505:26:16:106:523:174:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:The government instituted the HAMP program in 2009 as a response to the foreclosure
10:385:30588:16:17:89:522:158:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:crisis. It provided government subsidies to help facilitate mortgage modifications for borrow-
10:386:30682:17:16:89:522:141:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:ers struggling to make their payments. In total, 1.7 million borrowers received modifications
10:387:30775:16:17:89:192:125:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:through the program.
10:388:30795:17:16:106:523:108:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:The government designed HAMP’s eligibility criteria to target the borrowers it perceived
10:389:30883:16:14:98:523:92:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:12Both Chase and the GSEs had a variety of other private modification programs with di-erent designs
10:390:30983:14:0:89:178:78:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:that preceded HAMP.
11:391:31003:0:17:89:522:709:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:as most likely to benefit from modifications. Borrowers must have current payments greater
11:392:31093:17:16:89:522:692:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:than 31 percent of their income, be delinquent or in imminent default at the time of their
11:393:31183:16:17:89:522:676:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:application, attest that they are facing a financial hardship that makes it di-cult to continue
11:394:31278:17:16:89:522:659:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:making mortgage payments, and report that they do not have enough liquid assets to
11:395:31360:16:17:89:522:643:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:maintain their current debt payments and living expenses. In almost all cases, borrowers
11:396:31448:17:16:89:437:626:119:g_d0_f4:64:g_d0_f5:B:must be owner-occupants and have loan balances of less than $730,000.13
11:397:31519:16:17:106:522:610:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:The primary goal of HAMP modifications is to provide borrowers with more a-ordable
11:398:31601:17:16:89:522:593:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:mortgages. All borrowers who receive modifications have their payment reduced to reach
11:399:31687:16:16:89:522:577:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:a 31 percent Payment-to-Income (PTI) ratio for at least five years.  This rule results in
11:400:31776:16:17:89:522:561:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:substantial modifications for many borrowers. The mean payment reduction is $680 per
11:401:31860:17:16:89:391:544:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:month, or 38 percent of the borrower’s prior monthly payment.
11:402:31921:16:17:106:523:528:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Our research design relies on contrasting borrowers assigned to two distinct modification
11:403:32010:17:16:89:522:511:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:types. Both modification types result in the same payment reduction for the first five years,
11:404:32103:16:17:89:400:495:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:but each type achieves this payment reduction in a di-erent way.
11:405:32167:17:16:106:523:478:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:The first modification type provides what we call a “payment reduction” modification.
11:406:32252:16:16:89:522:462:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:Figure 1a shows the average annual payments for borrowers in this modification type relative
11:407:32344:16:17:89:522:446:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:to their payments under the status quo. This modification implements up to three steps
11:408:32430:17:16:89:522:429:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:to achieve the 31 percent PTI target. First, the interest rate is reduced down to a floor
11:409:32519:16:17:89:522:413:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:of two percent for a period of five years, after which it gradually increases to the market
11:410:32610:17:16:89:522:396:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:rate. Second, if the target is not reached after the interest rate reduction, the mortgage
11:411:32700:16:17:89:522:380:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:maturity is extended up to 40 years. Third, if the target still is not reached, a portion of
11:412:32792:17:16:89:522:363:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:the unpaid balance is converted into a non interest-bearing balloon payment due at the end
11:413:32882:16:16:89:194:347:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:of the mortgage term.
11:414:32903:16:17:106:523:331:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:The second modification type is what we call a “payment and principal reduction”
11:415:32983:17:16:89:522:314:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:modification (also known as the HAMP Principal Reduction Alternative). The first step in
11:416:33071:16:17:89:522:298:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:this modification is to forgive a borrower’s unpaid principal balance until the new monthly
11:417:33162:17:16:89:522:281:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:payment achieves the 31 percent PTI target or their LTV ratio hits 115 percent, whichever
11:418:33251:16:17:89:522:265:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:comes first. If the borrower’s monthly payment is still above the target, then the interest
11:419:33342:17:16:89:522:248:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:rate reduction, maturity extension, and principal forbearance steps described above are
11:420:33429:16:17:89:411:232:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:followed as needed. 241,000 borrowers received these modifications.
11:421:33496:17:16:106:523:215:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:The government introduced these principal reduction modifications in 2010 in response to
11:422:33584:16:16:89:522:199:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:growing concern that debt levels, rather than just debt payments, were responsible for high
11:423:33675:16:17:89:522:183:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:default rates and depressed consumption. The government devoted substantial resources
11:424:33760:17:16:89:522:166:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:towards supporting principal reduction modifications.  On average, the government paid
11:425:33846:16:17:89:522:150:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:an additional $21,000 per modification to support modifications with principal reduction
11:426:33934:17:16:89:238:133:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:(Scharlemann and Shore 2016).
11:427:33963:16:15:98:522:117:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:13These criteria rule out borrowers who might be particularly likely to strategically default. However,
11:428:34066:15:11:89:522:102:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:such borrowers are responsible for a small share of defaults. Eighty-seven percent of defaults in 2009 were
11:429:34173:11:11:89:522:91:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:for owner-occupied mortgages (Agarwal et al. (2017a) Table 1) and combining the SCF and the PSID we
11:430:34272:11:0:89:414:80:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:calculate that 95 percent of defaults were for loans below this balance threshold.
12:431:34355:0:17:106:523:709:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:By comparing borrowers who receive these two types of modifications, we can estimate
12:432:34439:17:16:89:522:692:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:the e-ect of long-term debt obligations holding short-term payments constant. The two
12:433:34524:16:17:89:522:676:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:types of modifications have identical e-ects on payments in the short term, but dramati-
12:434:34612:17:16:89:522:659:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:cally di-erent e-ects on long-term payments and homeowner equity. Figure 1a shows that
12:435:34698:16:17:89:522:643:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:payment reductions are identical for the first five years, after which payments rise more
12:436:34787:17:16:89:522:626:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:sharply for borrowers with payment reduction modifications. Figure 1b summarizes the fi-
12:437:34875:16:17:89:522:610:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:nancial impacts of these modifications for borrowers in our sample. Borrowers with principal
12:438:34967:17:16:89:475:593:119:g_d0_f4:64:g_d0_f5:B:reduction modifications receive an average of $67,000 more principal reduction.14
12:439:35048:16:16:106:523:577:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:The monetary value of the principal reduction depends on borrower behavior.  To a
12:440:35129:16:17:89:522:561:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:borrower who prepays her mortgage the next day, principal reduction is worth $67,000,
12:441:35214:17:16:89:522:544:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:but it is worth nothing to a borrower who immediately defaults and never repays.  We
12:442:35298:16:17:89:522:528:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:calculate the value to borrowers using two methods. First, we calculate that the incremental
12:443:35390:17:16:89:522:511:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:reduction in the Net Present Value (NPV) of payments owed under the mortgage contract

12:451:36038:16:17:89:360:380:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:dominates and we calculate a change in NPV of $28,000.

12:461:36765:16:17:89:522:199:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:“strategic” in nature, committed by borrowers who only had negative equity rather than by
12:462:36854:17:16:89:523:182:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:borrowers with a-ordability problems (Zingales 2010, Winkler 2010, Experian and Wyman

12:464:37041:15:11:89:522:151:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:tion. This is because some servicers wanted to provide principal forgiveness outside of the Treasury incentive
12:465:37151:11:11:89:522:140:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:program, which only paid incentives for forgiveness above 105 percent LTV and required the forgiveness to
12:466:37256:11:7:89:174:129:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:vest over three years.
12:467:37278:7:15:98:522:122:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:15This is also consistent with a “market-based” conception of wealth where valuation does not di-er across
12:468:37384:15:11:89:522:107:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:individuals. However, for an individual conception of wealth, the gains are still substantial even for a more
12:469:37493:11:11:89:522:96:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:impatient borrower. For example, if instead we assume the borrower’s discount rate is twice the mortgage
12:470:37597:11:0:89:499:85:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:interest rate, principal forgiveness reduces the NPV of payments owed under the contract by $18,000.

13:472:37791:17:16:89:522:692:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:borrowers to di-erent levels ofnegativeequity holding fixed immediate monthly payments.

13:474:37967:17:16:89:522:659:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:even after principal reduction. This is because bringing borrowers above water may enable
13:475:38056:16:17:89:522:643:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:borrowers to avoid default by selling the home or borrowing against the home (Gupta and

13:480:38409:16:17:89:522:561:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:servicer and lender type. This assignment generates quasi-experimental variation in which

15:552:43705:17:16:89:522:659:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:reduction at the cuto-, highlighting that the “treatment” we are analyzing is a reduction in
15:553:43797:16:17:89:522:643:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:mortgage principal that leaves short-term payments unchanged. The relationship of the four
15:554:43887:17:16:89:522:626:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:aforementioned variables with respect to the running variable is shown in online Appendix

15:556:43985:17:16:106:523:593:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:We find that principal reduction has no impact on default. Figure 2b shows the reduced
15:557:44071:16:16:89:522:577:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:form of the fuzzy regression discontinuity specification, plotting the default rate against the
15:558:44166:16:17:89:522:561:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:running variable. We define our main measure of default as being 90 days delinquent at
15:559:44252:17:16:89:522:544:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:any point between modification date and March 2015, when our dataset ends, which is an
15:560:44338:16:17:89:522:528:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:average of three years. This is the measure of default used to disqualify a borrower from the
15:561:44431:17:16:89:522:511:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:HAMP program and is the common measure used in the prior literature discussed in section
15:562:44519:16:17:89:523:495:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:3.4. There is no jump in default rates at the cuto-. Our point estimate is that $30,000 of
15:563:44609:17:16:89:522:478:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:principal reduction changes default probabilities by less than one percentage point, and we
15:564:44700:16:16:89:522:462:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:can rule out a reduction of more than five percentage points. Online Appendix Figure 7
15:565:44786:16:17:89:522:446:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:shows that our estimates are close to zero for a wide range of bandwidth choices, and these
15:566:44877:17:16:89:382:429:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:results are discussed in more detail in online Appendix B.1.2.
15:567:44939:16:17:106:522:413:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Our evidence suggests that principal reduction is also ine-ective at reducing foreclosures.
15:568:45030:17:16:89:522:396:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:Online Appendix Figure 8 shows that there is no jump in the foreclosure initiation rate at
15:569:45120:16:17:89:523:380:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:the cuto-.16It is not surprising that the same pattern would be seen in foreclosures as in
15:570:45210:17:16:89:522:363:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:defaults. Borrowers who have defaulted and are unable to self-cure are generally unable to
15:571:45300:16:16:89:387:347:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:sell their home to avoid foreclosure while they are underwater.
15:572:45363:16:17:106:523:331:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Our results imply a large government cost per avoided foreclosure. The upper bound of
15:573:45448:17:16:89:522:314:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:our 95 percent confidence interval suggests foreclosure initiations were reduced at most by
15:574:45539:16:17:89:522:298:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:3.6 percentage points. Herkenho-and Ohanian (2015) document that approximately half
15:575:45622:17:16:89:522:281:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:of borrowers with a foreclosure initiation end up with a completed foreclosure, while the
15:576:45711:16:17:89:522:265:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:other half self-cure. This suggests that principal reduction reduced foreclosure completions
15:577:45803:17:16:89:522:248:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:by at most 1.8 percentage points during the window we study.17The government spent
15:578:45885:16:17:89:522:232:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:about $10,000 per modification to support the additional principal reduction of the size we
15:579:45976:17:16:89:522:215:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:analyze in our treatment group. This translates into a government cost of at least $556,000
15:580:46067:16:16:89:522:199:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:per avoided foreclosure, more than an order of magnitude larger than common estimates of
15:581:46155:16:17:89:501:183:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:the social costs of foreclosure (Department of Housing and Urban Development 2010).
15:582:46238:17:16:106:523:166:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:It is possible that foreclosures would have been mechanically avoided by bringing bor-
15:583:46324:16:15:98:522:150:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:16Due to the lengthy delay between foreclosure initiations and foreclosure completions, foreclosure com-
15:584:46428:15:7:89:289:135:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:pletions are rarely observed in our sample period.
15:585:46478:7:14:98:522:128:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:17Although we find little impact on foreclosures within our three-year analysis window, it is possible that
15:586:46585:14:11:89:522:114:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:once these borrowers regain positive equity several years in the future, foreclosures for the principal reduction
15:587:46698:11:11:89:522:103:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:group will be lower than for those who did not receive it. Unfortunately this is not something we can analyze
15:588:46807:11:11:89:522:92:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:with the data in this paper. Furthermore, to the extent that the policy goal was short-term housing market
15:589:46913:11:0:89:356:81:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:stabilization, the benefit of future foreclosure reduction is unclear.
16:590:46985:0:17:89:522:709:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:rowers all the way into positive equity, but this also would have been an expensive strategy
16:591:47077:17:16:89:522:692:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:after prices had fallen substantially. The average underwater borrower evaluated for prin-
16:592:47167:16:17:89:522:676:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:cipal reduction had about $100,000 in negative equity. Even if foreclosure initiations were
16:593:47258:17:16:89:522:659:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:completely eliminated by forgiving 100 percent of this negative equity (since defaulting bor-
16:594:47351:16:17:89:522:643:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:rowers could sell their home and avoid a foreclosure), this would require $2.5 million in
16:595:47440:17:16:89:522:626:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:writedowns to avoid a subsequent foreclosure initiation and $5 million to avoid a foreclosure

16:598:47588:26:17:106:523:561:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Our results are inconsistent with prior evidence based on cross-sectional relationships.
16:599:47676:17:16:89:522:544:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:For example, Haughwout et al. (2016) use data on modifications performed prior to HAMP
16:600:47762:16:17:89:522:528:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:and find using cross-sectional variation that borrowers who received principal reductions
16:601:47851:17:16:89:522:511:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:equivalent to ours saw an 18 percentage point reduction in default. Furthermore, there is a
16:602:47942:16:16:89:522:495:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:strong cross-sectional relationship between the amount of negative equity and default rates
16:603:48033:16:17:89:288:479:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:across all borrowers (Gerardi et al. 2015).
16:604:48076:17:16:106:523:462:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Indeed, the U.S. Treasury Department developed a model based on this historical data
16:605:48160:16:17:89:522:446:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:that predicts a substantial reduction in default from principal reduction, which is inconsis-
16:606:48253:17:16:89:522:429:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:tent with our findings. The Treasury generated this estimate as part of its model to predict
16:607:48345:16:17:89:522:413:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:the benefits of modifications to lenders (Holden et al. 2012). We implement the Treasury
16:608:48433:17:16:89:522:396:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:redefault model (U.S. Department of the Treasury 2015) in the public HAMP data and
16:609:48515:16:16:89:522:380:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:calculate the predicted impact of principal reduction at the cuto-. The Treasury model
16:610:48601:16:17:89:522:364:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:expects a sharp reduction in default of 6.6 percentage points at the NPV cuto-, which we
16:611:48689:17:16:89:522:347:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:can rule out using the lower bound of our 95 percent confidence interval. This implies that
16:612:48780:16:17:89:522:331:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:many lenders were actually worse o-from having o-ered principal reduction, since the ex-
16:613:48868:17:16:89:522:314:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:pected reduction in defaults necessary to o-set the reduced cash flow from borrowers did
16:614:48956:16:17:89:164:298:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:not materialize.
16:615:48972:17:16:106:523:281:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Why is our causal estimate so much smaller than what is predicted by the cross-sectional
16:616:49060:16:16:89:522:265:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:relationship between borrower equity and default and models calibrated to this relationship?
16:617:49152:16:17:89:522:249:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:One possibility is that the cross-sectional evidence was misleading because borrowers with
16:618:49242:17:16:89:522:232:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:less equity were also borrowers who purchased homes near the height of the credit boom and
16:619:49332:16:17:89:522:216:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:who therefore might have been less credit-worthy on other dimensions. Palmer (2015) shows
16:620:49421:17:16:89:522:199:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:that changes in borrower and loan characteristics can explain 40 percent of the di-erence in
16:621:49513:16:17:89:522:183:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:default rates between the 2003-2004 and the 2006-2007 cohorts. Another possibility is that
16:622:49603:17:16:89:522:166:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:the large price reductions that left many borrowers underwater were also correlated with
16:623:49691:16:17:89:522:150:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:other omitted economic shocks that themselves could be responsible for higher default rates
16:624:49782:17:16:89:190:133:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:(Adelino et al. 2016).
16:625:49804:16:16:106:523:117:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:In contrast to these cross-sectional estimates, Scharlemann and Shore (2016) analyze
16:626:49888:16:0:89:522:101:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:principal reduction in HAMP using a regression kink design, and also find that principal
17:627:49978:0:17:89:522:709:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:reduction is a costly way to reduce defaults.18Our empirical results reinforce the conclusions
17:628:50072:17:16:89:522:692:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:of Scharlemann and Shore (2016) using an alternative estimation strategy that requires
17:629:50158:16:17:89:522:676:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:weaker parametric assumptions. In Scharlemann and Shore (2016)’s preferred specification,
17:630:50247:17:16:89:522:659:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:they use a regression kink design and assume that the relationship between the running
17:631:50333:16:17:89:522:643:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:variable and the outcome variable is globally linear. In contrast, our regression discontinuity
17:632:50428:17:16:89:522:626:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:identification strategy assumes that unobservable borrower traits are smooth in the local

17:635:50587:30:16:106:522:552:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:In this section we explore the e-ect of principal reductions on consumption. We find
17:636:50671:16:17:89:522:536:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:that the marginal propensity to consume out of housing wealth for underwater borrowers
17:637:50757:17:16:89:522:519:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:is an order of magnitude smaller than the marginal propensity to consume for average
17:638:50841:16:23:89:275:503:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:homeowners examined in prior studies.
17:639:50878:23:26:89:498:480:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:C:4.1  Identification: Panel Di-erence-in-Di-erence Empirical Strategy
17:640:50946:26:17:106:522:454:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Our use of consumption data motivates a change in research design to a panel di-erence-
17:641:51033:17:16:89:522:437:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:in-di-erences strategy for two reasons. First, our regression discontinuity strategy is under-
17:642:51127:16:17:89:529:421:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:powered for studying changes in consumption. Economically meaningful consumption changes
17:643:51215:17:16:89:522:404:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:can not be ruled out in the regression discontinuity sample given lack of precision. As we
17:644:51305:16:16:89:522:388:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:discuss in more detail in Section 4.3, even a small change in consumption on the order of
17:645:51394:16:17:89:522:372:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:five percent of the amount of principal forgiven would be meaningful relative to average
17:646:51482:17:16:89:522:355:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:marginal propensities to consume out of housing wealth changes studied in other contexts,
17:647:51571:16:17:89:522:339:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:whereas the predicted impacts on default from the prior literature were much larger. The
17:648:51659:17:16:89:522:322:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:second reason is that the panel nature of the spending measures from our credit bureau
17:649:51745:16:17:89:522:306:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:and banking data allow us to exploit an alternative strategy that o-ers more precision.
17:650:51832:17:16:89:523:289:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:Lagged spending measures allow us to adjust for underlying di-erences between borrowers
17:651:51919:16:17:89:522:273:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:receiving di-erent modification types within a wider bandwidth than with the regression
17:652:52006:17:16:89:522:256:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:discontinuity. These factors favor a panel di-erence-in-di-erences design, though we also
17:653:52095:16:16:89:365:240:119:g_d0_f4:64:g_d0_f5:B:report results from the regression discontinuity strategy.19
17:654:52155:16:17:106:523:224:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Our panel di-erence-in-di-erences design uses as a control group the set of underwater
17:655:52241:17:16:89:522:207:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:borrowers who were eligible for principal reductions, but who instead received only payment
17:656:52332:16:17:89:522:191:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:reduction modifications. This design relies on the fact that borrowers who receive payment
17:657:52422:17:16:89:522:174:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:reduction modifications experience the same short-term payment reductions as borrowers
17:658:52508:16:14:98:522:158:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:18In their preferred specification, where they use the global relationship between default and principal
17:659:52612:14:11:89:522:144:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:reduction, they find that principal reduction of the size we estimate (reducing the LTV by 11 points) reduces
17:660:52721:11:11:89:522:133:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:default by 1.9 percentage points, a result that is within our confidence interval. When using data close to
17:661:52828:11:7:89:522:122:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:the kink, they find that principal reduction has no statistically or economically significant e-ect on default.
17:662:52939:7:15:98:522:115:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:19We also have lagged measures of default from the credit bureau data. However, a di-erence-in-di-erences
17:663:53044:15:11:89:523:100:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:design is not valid for default because pre-treatment di-erences in the levels of default are mechanically
17:664:53150:11:11:89:522:89:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:removed at modification date, at which point all loans become current.  This means that the change in
17:665:53251:11:0:89:479:78:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:default for the control group is not a valid counterfactual for the change in the treatment group.
18:666:53351:0:17:89:522:709:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:who receive principal reduction, but receive substantially less generous long-term payment
18:667:53441:17:16:89:522:692:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:relief. Summary statistics for both groups are shown in online Appendix Table 2.20The
18:668:53526:16:17:89:522:676:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:size of short-term payment reductions are nearly identical across groups, but borrowers
18:669:53613:17:16:89:522:659:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:who receive payment and principal reduction modifications receive on average $67,000 more
18:670:53702:16:17:89:522:643:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:principal reduction, reducing the NPV of the payments owed under their mortgage contract
18:671:53790:17:16:89:522:626:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:by an additional $34,000. In accordance with the HAMP rules described in the previous
18:672:53875:16:17:89:522:610:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:section, borrowers who received principal forgiveness remained underwater (usually at 115
18:673:53964:17:16:89:523:593:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:percent LTV). Thus, the treatment is the e-ect of long-term debt forgiveness holding short-
18:674:54055:16:16:89:300:577:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:term payments and access to liquidity fixed.
18:675:54099:16:17:106:523:561:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Our identification comes from cross-servicer and cross-lender variation in the propensity
18:676:54188:17:16:89:522:544:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:to provide principal reductions given observed borrower characteristics. Borrowers are not
18:677:54278:16:17:89:522:528:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:assigned to principal reduction modifications according to the NPV calculation alone because
18:678:54370:17:16:89:523:511:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:di-erent lenders have di-erent views about principal reduction and servicers are not always
18:679:54461:16:17:89:522:495:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:confident they have the contractual right to forgive principal or the capacity to manage
18:680:54549:17:16:89:523:478:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:the process.21Conditional on lender and servicer, all borrowers are treated alike. Servicers
18:681:54641:16:16:89:522:462:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:must submit a written policy to the Treasury department detailing when they will o-er
18:682:54726:16:17:89:522:446:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:principal reduction modifications and attesting that they will treat all observably similar
18:683:54817:17:16:89:522:429:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:borrowers alike (U.S. Department of Treasury 2014). Intuitively, comparing borrowers across
18:684:54908:16:17:89:522:413:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:modification types relies on servicer-lenders that were more likely to o-er principal reduction
18:685:55003:17:16:89:522:396:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:not having borrowers whose consumption was trending di-erentially relative to borrowers
18:686:55090:16:17:89:403:380:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:whose servicer-lenders were less likely to o-er principal reduction.
18:687:55158:17:16:106:522:363:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:The key identifying assumption for the panel di-erence-in-di-erences design is that con-
18:688:55246:16:16:89:522:347:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:sumption trends would be the same in both groups in the absence of treatment.  This
18:689:55329:16:17:89:522:331:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:assumption is plausible when the two groups exhibit parallel trends before treatment. We
18:690:55417:17:16:89:522:314:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:show this visually in Figure 3a, which plots mean credit card expenditure around modifica-
18:691:55507:16:17:89:522:298:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:tion date.22The same figure shows that principal reduction appears to have little e-ect–a
18:692:55596:17:16:89:299:281:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:result we explore in a regression framework.
18:693:55640:16:30:106:338:265:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Formally, our main specification is the following:

18:695:55761:18:15:98:522:217:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:20Our main sample for this analysis includes underwater borrowers in the matched HAMP credit bureau
18:696:55860:15:11:89:522:202:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:dataset who are observed one year before and after modification and report positive credit card expenditure
18:697:55967:11:7:89:259:191:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:in at least one month during this window.
18:698:56008:7:15:98:522:184:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:21The contractual frictions are particularly acute with securitized loans. For example, Kruger (2018) shows
18:699:56115:15:11:89:522:169:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:that 22 percent of servicing agreements governing securitized pools explicitly forbid servicers from reducing
18:700:56224:11:11:89:522:158:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:principal balances as part of modifications.  As a result, principal reduction in HAMP was less common
18:701:56326:11:10:89:522:147:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:among borrowers in securitized pools (Scharlemann and Shore 2016).  Conversely, principal reduction is
18:702:56428:10:11:89:522:137:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:more common for loans held on banks’ own balance sheets, where servicer-lender frictions are mitigated
18:703:56530:11:8:89:177:126:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:(Agarwal et al. 2011).

19:726:58141:27:16:106:522:413:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:We find that neither credit card nor auto expenditures are a-ected by principal reduction
19:727:58230:16:16:89:522:397:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:in the year after modification. Our main results are reported in Panels A and B of Table
19:728:58318:16:17:89:522:381:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:2.  In both panels, column (1) reports the most sparse specification, while columns (2)-
19:729:58406:17:16:89:522:364:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:(6) add in additional fixed e-ects and controls.  Across all specifications, the treatment
19:730:58496:16:17:89:522:348:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:e-ect of principal reduction on both monthly credit card and auto expenditure is small and
19:731:58586:17:16:89:522:331:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:statistically insignificant. Our preferred estimate using equation 3 is in column (6), which
19:732:58678:16:17:89:523:315:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:includes MSA by calendar month fixed e-ects and interacts control variables with a post-
19:733:58766:17:16:89:522:298:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:modification dummy. In this specification, our point estimate is that principal reduction
19:734:58855:16:17:89:522:282:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:of $67,000 increases borrower monthly credit card expenditure by less than $2 and auto
19:735:58941:17:16:89:215:265:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:spending by less than $10.
19:736:58967:16:16:106:523:249:119:g_d0_f28:119:g_d0_f4:A:Robustness– We address two potential weaknesses of the credit bureau data by con-
19:737:59048:16:17:89:522:233:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:firming that the result also holds in the JPMCI bank dataset. The first potential weakness
19:738:59138:17:16:89:522:216:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:is that credit card expenditure is inferred from other variables reported by servicers, as
19:739:59228:16:17:89:522:200:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:discussed in Section 2.1. The second is any measurement error introduced by our matching
19:740:59316:17:16:89:523:183:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:procedure. The JPMCI dataset covers only one servicer, but does not su-er from either
19:741:59401:16:15:89:522:167:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:of these two potential limitations.  It includes credit card data but not auto loan data.
19:742:59490:15:15:98:522:152:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:23This includes the predicted gain to lenders from providing principal reduction, the predicted gain inter-

19:747:60012:11:11:89:522:93:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:our regression discontinuity and di-erence-in-di-erences strategies is that the regression discontinuity strat-

19:749:60231:10:0:89:493:72:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:while the di-erence-in-di-erences strategy uses all the variation conditional on the running variable.
20:750:60335:0:17:89:522:709:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:Online Appendix Figure 10 shows that the same pattern of credit card expenditure around
20:751:60422:17:16:89:522:692:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:modification date holds in the JPMCI data. Our estimated treatment e-ects are displayed
20:752:60509:16:17:89:522:676:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:in online Appendix Table 3. Here again we find the treatment e-ect of debt forgiveness on
20:753:60598:17:16:89:384:659:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:credit card expenditure is small and statistically insignificant.
20:754:60663:16:17:106:523:643:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:We also explore the e-ect of principal reduction on consumption using our regression
20:755:60747:17:16:89:522:626:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:discontinuity strategy.  Our outcome variables are the change in mean credit card and
20:756:60832:16:17:89:522:610:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:auto spending from the 12 months before modification to the 12 months after modification.

20:764:61437:17:16:89:522:478:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:changes. However, the paths of credit card and auto spending around modification suggest
20:765:61525:16:16:89:522:462:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:that borrowers do seem to respond to short-term payment reductions. Both credit card and
20:766:61613:16:17:89:522:446:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:auto spending are declining before modification and recover after modification. The decline
20:767:61704:17:16:89:522:429:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:pre-modification is likely a result of financial stress experienced by the borrowers. The slope
20:768:61799:16:17:89:522:413:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:of expenditure changes sharply around modification, suggesting that lower payments help
20:769:61886:17:16:89:199:396:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:expenditure to recover.

20:771:61994:17:16:89:522:363:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:sistent with findings in Agarwal et al. (2017a). That paper exploits regional variation in the
20:772:62088:16:16:89:522:347:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:implementation of HAMP to estimate the e-ects of HAMP modifications which combine
20:773:62169:16:17:89:522:331:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:both short-term and long-term payment reductions. They find that the combined modi-
20:774:62252:17:16:89:522:314:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:fications are associated with increased auto spending. If the e-ect of long-term payment
20:775:62340:16:17:89:522:298:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:reductions in HAMP is zero, as suggested by our estimates, it makes sense to infer that
20:776:62427:17:16:89:522:281:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:short-term payment reductions are responsible for the consumption impact they estimate.
20:777:62514:16:17:89:522:265:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:In online Appendix B.2.2 we attempt to directly estimate the impact of short-term payment

20:783:62884:27:16:106:523:149:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:To help interpret the economic significance of our results, we convert our estimate for
20:784:62971:16:16:89:522:133:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:the impact on credit card and auto consumption into a marginal propensity to consume
20:785:63055:16:17:89:522:117:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:(MPC) out of housing wealth.  First, we scale up credit card spending to a measure of
20:786:63140:17:15:98:522:100:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:24Translating these estimates to a marginal propensity to consume, as in Section 4.3, our confidence interval
20:787:63249:15:0:89:272:85:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:ranges all the way from -15 cents to 41 cents.
21:788:63297:0:17:89:522:709:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:non-auto retail spending to be comparable to Mian et al. (2013). We do this by adjusting
21:789:63385:17:16:89:522:692:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:for credit card spending on cards where spending is not reported in the credit bureau data
21:790:63475:16:17:89:522:676:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:and then multiplying by the ratio of non-auto consumer retail spending to consumer credit
21:791:63564:17:16:89:522:659:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:card spending in 2012.25Second, we combine with our auto spending measure, annualize,
21:792:63649:16:17:89:522:643:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:and divide by the mean incremental amount of principal reduction in the treatment group.
21:793:63737:17:16:106:523:626:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Using this method, our point estimate is that households increased annual consumption
21:794:63822:16:17:89:522:610:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:by 0.3 cents per dollar of principal reduction, with the upper bound of the 95 percent
21:795:63908:17:16:89:522:593:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:confidence interval corresponding to 0.8 cents. A similar procedure using results from the
21:796:63998:16:16:89:522:577:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:JPMCI bank dataset yields an upper bound of 1.2 cents. If we normalize by the reduction
21:797:64085:16:17:89:522:561:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:in the NPV of mortgage payments owed under the new mortgage contract rather than the
21:798:64169:17:16:89:522:544:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:dollar value of principal reduction, we get a point estimate of 0.5 cents and an upper bound
21:799:64261:16:17:89:146:528:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:of 1.6 cents.

21:801:64353:16:17:89:522:495:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:magnitude smaller than the MPC for average homeowners examined in prior studies. A set
21:802:64439:17:16:89:522:478:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:of comparison points for our estimates of the impact of principal reduction on consumption
21:803:64529:16:16:89:522:462:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:comes from the literature examining the impact of price-driven housing wealth changes.
21:804:64615:16:17:89:522:446:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:We present several such estimates in Figure 3b.  Campbell and Cocco (2007) and Mian
21:805:64698:17:16:89:522:429:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:et al. (2013) find annual MPCs for homeowners around nine cents per dollar of housing
21:806:64783:16:17:89:522:413:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:wealth gain. Aladangady (2017) finds an MPC of five cents and Carroll et al. (2011) find
21:807:64871:17:16:89:522:396:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:MPCs between two and ten cents. There is also a wide literature estimating the elasticity
21:808:64960:16:17:89:522:380:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:of consumption to housing wealth, with findings typically between 0.1 and 0.3 (Guren et al.
21:809:65051:17:16:89:522:363:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:2018b, Case et al. 2013, Attanasio et al. 2009, Berger et al. 2018). These elasticities translate
21:810:65148:16:16:89:335:347:119:g_d0_f4:64:g_d0_f5:B:into MPCs between three and 11 cents per dollar.26
21:811:65198:16:17:106:523:331:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:While our estimates are already below those measuring the MPC of average households
21:812:65281:17:16:89:522:314:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:in the prior literature, there is evidence that highly leveraged borrowers are usually even
21:813:65372:16:17:89:522:298:119:g_d0_f17:119:g_d0_f4:B:moreresponsive. Mian et al. (2013) find that that households living in zip codes with average
21:814:65465:17:16:89:522:281:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:LTV ratios above 90 have MPCs that are twice that of the median household, translating
21:815:65551:16:17:89:522:265:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:into an MPC of 18 cents.27This result has been used by policy advocates arguing in favor
21:816:65639:17:16:89:522:248:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:of principal reduction for underwater borrowers.28However, our evidence suggests that
21:817:65724:16:14:98:522:232:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:25Specifically, our adjustment factor is the product of two ratios: (1) the ratio of the number of credit
21:818:65829:14:11:89:522:218:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:cards in TransUnion to the number of credit cards with spending reported in TransUnion, and (2) the ratio
21:819:65934:11:11:89:522:207:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:of non-auto consumer retail spending in 2012 to total consumer credit card spending in 2012.  The first
21:820:66037:11:11:89:522:196:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:term uses our data, retail spend is from Census, and consumer credit card spending is from Federal Reserve
21:821:66143:11:11:89:522:185:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:Payment Study (Federal Reserve 2014). This gives an adjustment factor of(1.2) (2.5) = 3.1. An alternative
21:822:66248:11:11:89:522:174:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:adjustment multiplying by the ratio of average household monthly non-auto retail spend to the average credit
21:823:66356:11:7:89:399:163:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:card spending we observe in our sample gives the same MPC point estimate.
21:824:66429:7:15:98:522:156:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:26For authors who do not report an MPC, we translate elasticities into MPCs by multiplying them by the
21:825:66531:15:11:89:522:141:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:ratio of personal consumption expenditures from the BEA to housing assets from the Flow of Funds from
21:826:66632:11:7:89:297:130:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:2007 reported in Berger et al. (2018), which is 0.34.
21:827:66685:7:15:98:522:123:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:27Similarly, Disney et al. (2010) analyze panel survey data in the U.K. and find that borrowers who begin
21:828:66790:15:11:89:522:108:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:the period underwater and end the period above water, and are thus near the 100 LTV threshold, have high
21:829:66894:11:7:89:189:97:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:MPCs of about 13 cents.
21:830:66917:7:0:98:242:90:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:?:28See discussion in Goldfarb (2012).
22:831:66955:0:17:89:522:709:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:the response of borrowers who are far underwater, with LTVs far above 90, have much
22:832:67038:17:16:89:522:692:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:lower MPCs out of housing wealth, rendering principal reductions for underwater borrowers
22:833:67127:16:17:89:522:676:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:ine-ective. In Section 7 we argue that the inability of underwater borrowers to monetize
22:834:67215:17:16:89:522:659:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:housing wealth can explain the discrepancy between our estimates and those in the prior
22:835:67302:16:25:89:391:643:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:literature, and we explore the policy implications of this result.

22:844:67929:17:16:89:522:456:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:Although servicers were required to o-er all eligible borrowers HAMP modifications, as

22:846:68072:17:16:106:523:423:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:To mitigate losses on loans ineligible for HAMP, mortgage owners developed their own
22:847:68156:16:17:89:522:407:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:private modification programs. During the Great Recession, mortgages could be partitioned
22:848:68245:17:16:89:522:390:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:into two approximately equally-sized groups. Loans which met certain underwriting crite-
22:849:68333:16:16:89:522:374:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:ria, including a maximum loan size and a minimum borrower FICO score, were usually
22:850:68415:16:17:89:522:358:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:owned or securitized by Fannie Mac and Freddie Mac (the GSEs). Loans which did not
22:851:68497:17:16:89:522:341:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:meet these criteria were usually underwritten and often securitized by other market actors,
22:852:68588:16:17:89:522:325:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:such as banks. We analyze borrowers receiving both types of private modifications using
22:853:68675:17:16:89:522:308:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:the JPMCI bank dataset described in Section 2.2. This includes both GSE and non-GSE
22:854:68758:16:17:89:522:292:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:borrowers whose mortgages are serviced by Chase and hence were eligible either for a pri-

22:856:68933:16:16:89:504:259:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:we describe below, the GSE modification and the Chase modification are quite similar.

22:860:69268:17:16:89:522:193:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:from the National Housing Act of 1937, which established a PTI limit in the federal govern-

23:869:70062:17:16:89:522:692:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:“a-ordable” share of income according to the government’s metric. For borrowers with PTI
23:870:70150:16:17:89:522:676:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:near the 31 percent target, private modifications result in immediate payment reductions
23:871:70238:17:16:89:223:659:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:that are larger than HAMP.
23:872:70264:16:17:106:523:643:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:The second important feature of these private modification programs is that they use
23:873:70348:17:16:89:522:626:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:maturity extension as a low-cost tool for achieving deeper immediate payment reductions
23:874:70435:16:17:89:522:610:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:without reducing long-term obligations.  A range of contract terms can be modified in
23:875:70520:17:16:89:522:593:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:order to achieve a given amount of immediate payment reduction. As described in Section
23:876:70607:16:16:89:522:577:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:3.1, HAMP reduces payments by first providing interest rate reductions, then maturity
23:877:70692:16:17:89:522:561:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:extensions, and finally principal forbearance as necessary to achieve the 31 percent PTI ratio
23:878:70786:17:16:89:522:544:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:target. In contrast, the private modifications we study target larger payment reductions
23:879:70874:16:17:89:522:528:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:by first extending maturity and amortization terms (which we call maturity extension for
23:880:70962:17:16:89:523:511:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:simplicity).  In this way, deeper immediate payment reductions are o-set by continued
23:881:71047:16:17:89:218:495:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:payments in the long-term.
23:882:71073:17:16:106:523:478:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Both of these distinctive features are visible in Figure 4 for Chase private modifications,
23:883:71164:16:16:89:522:462:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:which is our preferred estimation sample. (The modification design and point estimates for
23:884:71254:16:17:89:522:446:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:GSE private modifications are very similar, but the regression discontinuity design has a
23:885:71343:17:16:89:522:429:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:technical issue which we discuss later in this section.) This figure summarizes payments
23:886:71431:16:17:89:522:413:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:under each program using the same plot structure as Figure 1. Figure 4a shows the annual
23:887:71519:17:16:89:522:396:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:path of payments relative to the status quo for government and private modifications o-ered
23:888:71610:16:17:89:522:380:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:to borrowers with PTI close to 31 percent.  Government (HAMP) modifications for this
23:889:71694:17:16:89:522:363:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:sample have a modest reduction in payments until year 27, with small increases thereafter.
23:890:71784:16:16:89:522:347:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:Private modifications lead to deeper payment reductions for the first 22 years and then to
23:891:71874:16:17:89:300:331:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:higher payments for the remaining 18 years.
23:892:71917:17:16:106:522:314:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Figure 4b shows that compared to government modifications, private modifications o-er
23:893:72002:16:17:89:522:298:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:a relative reduction in immediate mortgage payments but leave the NPV of total payments
23:894:72089:17:16:89:522:281:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:owed approximately unchanged. This analysis uses the same methodology as in Section 3.1.
23:895:72177:16:17:89:522:265:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:The main force driving the deeper payment reductions is maturity extension, and when the
23:896:72265:17:16:89:522:248:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:discount rate equals the interest rate (consistent with the empirical evidence of borrower
23:897:72355:16:17:89:522:232:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:behavior in Busse et al. 2013), this results in no change in the NPV of total payments owed.
23:898:72447:17:16:89:522:215:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:Because the private modification has deeper payment reductions for 22 years, it may be
23:899:72533:16:16:89:522:199:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:NPV-positive from the perspective of a more impatient borrower. Even for such borrowers,
23:900:72621:16:17:89:522:183:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:we attribute the causal impact of the private modification to its liquidity component because
23:901:72714:17:16:89:466:166:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:in Section 3 we find that future mortgage payments do not a-ect default rates.
23:902:72792:16:20:106:522:150:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:The mix of other modification characteristics also changed at the cuto-, though these
23:903:72877:20:11:89:522:130:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:not have a single payment reduction target, but Farrell et al. (2017) show that the GSE program e-ectively
23:904:72983:11:11:89:522:119:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:targeted a payment reduction of about 25 percent. While the HAMP program ended in December 2016, both
23:905:73084:11:11:89:522:108:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:the Chase and GSE modification programs described in this section are ongoing and their rules are subject to
23:906:73192:11:11:89:522:97:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:change. Our description of the programs reflects guidelines in place during our analysis period. See Cowley
23:907:73299:11:0:89:506:86:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:(2017) for more detail about the evolution of private modifications across di-erent market participants.
24:908:73405:0:17:89:522:709:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:changes roughly o-set. As shown in the figure, borrowers receiving private modifications
24:909:73493:17:16:89:522:692:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:had less principal reduction.  This is because private modifications are ineligible for the
24:910:73584:16:17:89:522:676:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:subsidized principal reduction in HAMP.30On the other hand, private modifications had
24:911:73669:17:16:89:522:659:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:more principal forbearance and slightly deeper interest rate reductions, o-setting the e-ect
24:912:73761:16:23:89:367:643:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:of reduced principal forgiveness from an NPV perspective.

24:916:73999:17:16:89:522:560:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:payment reduction targets used in HAMP and the private modification program.  Since
24:917:74082:16:17:89:522:544:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:HAMP was designed to reduce monthly payments to 31 percent of a borrower’s income,
24:918:74164:17:16:89:522:527:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:borrowers whose PTI ratio was already below 31 percent were ineligible for HAMP. These
24:919:74250:16:16:89:357:511:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:borrowers were only evaluated for private modifications.
24:920:74306:16:17:106:522:495:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:The di-erence in modification program rules generates substantial variation in the
24:921:74388:17:16:89:522:478:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:amount of immediate payment reduction received by borrowers on either side of HAMP’s 31
24:922:74475:16:17:89:522:462:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:percent PTI eligibility cuto-. Below the cuto-, all borrowers receive private modifications
24:923:74566:17:16:89:522:445:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:with large payment reductions. Above the cuto-about half of borrowers receive HAMP
24:924:74648:16:17:89:522:429:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:modifications with small payment reductions (since these borrowers are already close to
24:925:74735:17:16:89:522:412:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:HAMP’s 31 percent PTI target) and about half receive private modifications with large
24:926:74820:16:16:89:522:396:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:payment reductions (since Chase had a minimum 30 percent payment reduction target).
24:927:74903:16:17:89:523:380:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:Although borrowers above the cuto-who receive HAMP modifications with a 31 percent
24:928:74985:17:16:89:522:363:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:PTI ratio target would have received larger payment reductions in the private program,
24:929:75071:16:17:89:522:347:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:HAMP rules prohibited servicers from o-ering private sector alternatives to any HAMP-
24:930:75156:17:16:89:522:330:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:eligible borrower, under the assumption that private modifications would not be as e-ective
24:931:75247:16:17:89:522:314:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:as those subsidized by the government. Thus the only borrowers above the cuto-receiving
24:932:75334:17:16:89:522:297:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:private modifications are those failing to meet one of the other eligibility criteria described
24:933:75429:16:17:89:522:281:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:in Section 3.1. The eligibility cuto-therefore serves as an instrument for borrowers moved
24:934:75519:17:16:89:522:264:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:from HAMP modifications with small payment reductions to private modifications with
24:935:75602:16:16:89:212:248:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:large payment reductions.
24:936:75627:16:17:106:523:232:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:We make three sample restrictions for ease of exposition, though our central result is
24:937:75713:17:16:89:522:215:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:unchanged when we lift all three restrictions. First, to focus on a subsample eligible for
24:938:75803:16:17:89:522:199:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:the full maturity extension treatment, we subset to mortgages whose current terms are less
24:939:75893:17:16:89:522:182:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:than or equal to 30 years. This maintains 87 percent of the sample. Second, to simplify the
24:940:75984:16:17:89:522:166:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:calculation of expected payments before and after modification in Section 6.2.1, we restrict
24:941:76076:17:16:89:522:149:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:to fixed rate mortgages. This maintains 48 percent of observations.31Finally, we drop 254
24:942:76165:16:14:98:522:133:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:30As we discuss above, because we found no independent impact of principal reductions on default in
24:943:76264:14:11:89:522:119:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:Section 3.3, we attribute the causal impact of this treatment on default to the immediate payment reduction
24:944:76371:11:11:89:522:108:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:portion of the treatment.  In Section 5.3 we provide a bound on our estimate of the e-ect of payment
24:945:76471:11:7:89:505:97:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:reduction under the alternative assumption that the principal increase actually had an o-setting e-ect.
24:946:76574:7:15:98:522:90:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:31Although these sample restrictions drop a substantial share of observations within our sample, they keep
24:947:76680:15:0:89:522:75:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:the type of mortgages that were most prevalent during this time period. As a result, these restrictions make
25:948:76790:0:17:89:522:709:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:observations between 31 percent and 31.1 percent PTI who receive an amount of payment
25:949:76875:17:16:89:522:692:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:reduction about halfway between that received by borrowers clearly above and clearly below

25:979:78928:17:16:106:523:199:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:We find that immediate payment reduction significantly reduces default rates. Figure 5b

25:981:79106:16:17:89:522:167:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:evidence that payment reduction reduces default in two ways. First, the default rate falls
25:982:79196:17:20:89:522:150:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:sharply by 6.0 percentage points relative to a control mean of 31.6 percent at the eligibility
25:983:79290:20:11:89:522:130:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:the analysis sample more similar on observables to a representative sample of delinquent borrowers (see Table

25:986:79508:15:7:89:506:97:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:in the NPV of payments owed, the amount of principal forgiveness, and the change in the interest rate.
25:987:79610:7:14:98:522:90:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:33Borrower density thins out above PTI ratios of 80, and borrowers with PTI ratios below 25 are evaluated

26:990:79846:17:16:89:522:692:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:of the payment reductions in the top panel; default rates are approximately constant on the
26:991:79937:16:17:89:522:676:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:left-hand side of the cuto-, consistent with a constant amount of payment reduction, and
26:992:80025:17:16:89:522:659:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:are falling on the right-hand side of the cuto-, consistent with a rising amount of payment
26:993:80116:16:17:89:522:643:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:reduction. This pattern is even more striking in online Appendix Figure 15, which plots the
26:994:80207:17:16:89:522:626:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:first stage and reduced form for borrowers with PTI ratios all the way out to 80 percent.

26:999:80590:17:16:89:522:544:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:sample restrictions described above we find an extra one percent payment reduction reduces
26:1000:80680:16:17:89:522:528:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:default rates by 0.26 percentage point. This reduction is 0.95 percent of the default rate
26:1001:80770:17:16:89:522:511:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:above the cuto-, which is similar to our estimate of 1.1 percent in the baseline sample.

26:1003:80948:17:16:89:522:478:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:bandwidths. Our point estimate is similar (rising to 1.3 percent) if we use the upper bound
26:1004:81039:16:16:89:523:462:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:of our confidence interval from Section 3.3 to adjust for any potential e-ect of the relative
26:1005:81132:16:17:89:522:446:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:increase in mortgage principal at the cuto-.  Online Appendix B.2.1 provides additional
26:1006:81219:17:16:89:210:429:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:detail on this calculation.
26:1007:81246:16:17:106:522:413:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:We also analyze the e-ects of immediate payment reduction for GSE-backed loans and
26:1008:81328:17:16:89:522:396:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:find a similar reduction in delinquency. For borrowers ineligible for HAMP, the GSEs o-ered
26:1009:81419:16:17:89:522:380:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:a private modification that was very similar to the Chase private modification in that it
26:1010:81508:17:16:89:522:363:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:featured a payment reduction target and for most borrowers used maturity extensions prior
26:1011:81597:16:16:89:522:347:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:to any interest rate reduction. Borrowers on the left-hand side receive payment reductions
26:1012:81687:16:17:89:522:331:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:that are 22.4 percentage points more generous than borrowers on the right-hand side and
26:1013:81774:17:16:89:522:314:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:have default rates that are 6.1 percentage points lower.34We estimate that a one percent
26:1014:81862:16:17:89:522:298:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:reduction in payments reduces default by 0.27 percentage point.  This reduction is 1.0
26:1015:81948:17:16:89:523:281:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:percent of the default rate above the cuto-, which is similar to our estimate of a reduction
26:1016:82040:16:17:89:522:265:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:of 1.1 percent for non-GSE loans. It is reassuring that we recover essentially the same point
26:1017:82133:17:16:89:395:248:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:estimate when using a completely di-erent sample of borrowers.
26:1018:82195:16:17:106:523:232:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:However, the research design for the GSE-backed loans does not pass one of the standard
26:1019:82282:17:16:89:522:215:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:RD identification checks and hence it is not our preferred specification. There are more
26:1020:82370:16:16:89:522:199:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:borrowers on theright-handside of the cuto-than on the left-hand side, as shown in online
26:1021:82459:16:17:89:522:183:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:Appendix Figure 20. This issue does not arise because of borrower manipulation of PTI,
26:1022:82545:17:16:89:522:166:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:which would induce more mass on theleft-handside where additional payment reduction

26:1024:82730:15:10:89:522:135:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:modifications. Online Appendix Figures 17, 18, 19 and 20 replicate our 31 percent PTI cuto-analysis for
26:1025:82833:10:11:89:522:125:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:the GSE-backed loans sample. Recall that in online Appendix Figure 14 we showed that there was no change
26:1026:82937:11:11:89:522:114:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:in NPV of payments owed at the cuto-for the non-GSE-backed sample because more interest rate reduction
26:1027:83039:11:11:89:522:103:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:was o-set by less principal reduction. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac did not allow principal forgiveness (even
26:1028:83146:11:11:89:522:92:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:for HAMP recipients) and so in the GSE-backed sample the reduction in the NPV of payments owed is
26:1029:83243:11:0:89:213:81:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:smaller on the right-hand side.
27:1030:83276:0:17:89:522:709:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:is available. Rather, it arises because eligibility for GSE private modifications required a
27:1031:83368:17:16:89:522:692:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:FICO lower than 620 for borrowers less than 60 days delinquent at the time of modification,
27:1032:83459:16:17:89:522:676:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:while HAMP had no such screen. As a result, there is an imbalance where the left-hand side
27:1033:83549:17:16:89:522:659:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:has no less than 60 days delinquent borrowers with FICO above 620 and the right-hand side
27:1034:83638:16:17:89:522:643:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:has borrowers of all FICO scores and pre-modification delinquency statuses. We are unable
27:1035:83727:17:16:89:522:626:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:to correct this problem because we do not observe FICO in the JPMCI data. Nevertheless,
27:1036:83814:16:17:89:522:610:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:we believe the bias from these extra low-delinquency higher FICO borrowers is small and
27:1037:83901:17:16:89:522:593:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:therefore find this research design to still be informative.35Thus, we find that payment

27:1039:84073:16:28:89:438:561:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:has a substantial e-ect on default for a wide range of types of borrowers.

27:1041:84171:30:17:106:523:503:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:In this section we discuss the positive and normative implications of our results on de-
27:1042:84259:17:16:89:522:486:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:fault.  Our finding that default is responsive to immediate payment reductions but not
27:1043:84345:16:16:89:522:470:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:long-term principal reduction provides support for liquidity-driven theories of default. Be-

27:1045:84524:17:16:89:522:437:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:extensions as implemented at the HAMP cuto-can provide deeper payment reductions and
27:1046:84608:16:17:89:522:421:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:reduced default rates in a way that leaves borrowers, lenders, and taxpayers better o-. This
27:1047:84700:17:16:89:522:404:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:result can be used to draw lessons for the e-cient structure of mortgage modifications in a
27:1048:84791:16:20:89:148:388:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:future crisis.

27:1050:84844:26:17:106:523:342:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Our empirical results show that immediate liquidity substantially a-ects borrower de-
27:1051:84929:17:16:89:522:325:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:fault decisions but that reductions in mortgage principal do not. This suggests that, at least
27:1052:85023:16:17:89:522:309:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:for our sample, immediate liquidity is the main driver of borrower default. This contrasts
27:1053:85113:17:16:89:444:292:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:with strategic default explanations based on the degree of negative equity.
27:1054:85188:16:17:106:522:276:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Indeed, quantitatively our results suggest thatimmediateliquidity provision is a key
27:1055:85272:17:16:89:523:259:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:driver of the default reductions found in two types of prior work analyzing the e-ect of
27:1056:85360:16:16:89:523:243:119:g_d0_f17:119:g_d0_f4:B:sustainedpayment reductions. First, Agarwal et al. (2011) and Haughwout et al. (2016)

27:1058:85532:17:16:89:522:210:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:HAMP program.  They find that a one percent immediate payment reduction that also
27:1059:85613:16:17:89:522:194:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:reduces long-term debt obligations is associated with a 1.1 percent to 1.3 percent reduction
27:1060:85705:17:16:89:522:177:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:in default rates.36Second, other authors have analyzed the e-ect of sustained payment
27:1061:85790:16:14:98:522:161:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:35Two pieces of evidence suggest the bias is small. First, we plot predicted delinquency as a function of
27:1062:85895:14:11:89:522:147:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:average observable borrower characteristics in online Appendix Figure 19. There is little change in predicted
27:1063:86004:11:11:89:522:136:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:delinquency at the cuto-. Second, the extra borrowers on the right-hand side are more creditworthy. This
27:1064:86108:11:11:89:522:125:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:change in sample composition will lower average default rates on the right-hand side, leading us to understate
27:1065:86218:11:7:89:245:114:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:the e-ectiveness of payment reduction.
27:1066:86256:7:15:98:522:107:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:36In addition, Agarwal et al. (2017a) show that HAMP modifications with both short and long-term
27:1067:86352:15:11:89:522:92:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:payment reduction led to significant reductions in default rates, though they do not estimate an elasticity
27:1068:86459:11:0:89:310:81:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:with respect to a given quantity of payment reduction.

28:1070:86603:17:16:89:522:692:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:and baseline default rates makes it di-cult to directly compare magnitudes between dis-

28:1072:86780:17:16:89:522:659:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:reduction is associated with a 0.8 percent to 2.0 percent reduction in default rates.37The

28:1080:87409:16:17:89:522:528:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:borrow to make payments or sell the house to avoid foreclosure. However it is not generally
28:1081:87500:17:16:89:522:511:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:a su-cient condition for default because there is option value to staying in a mortgage and
28:1082:87591:16:17:89:275:495:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:because default is costly for borrowers.
28:1083:87631:17:16:106:523:478:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:For example, Campbell and Cocco (2015) develop a calibrated model and find that in
28:1084:87713:16:16:89:522:462:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:a baseline case with cost-less default the relationship between leverage and default is flat
28:1085:87805:16:17:89:522:446:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:until about 135 LTV. Our empirical evidence suggests that default is insensitive to LTVs
28:1086:87893:17:16:89:522:429:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:even at slightly higher LTV ratios, which is consistent with adding a utility cost of default
28:1087:87986:16:17:89:522:413:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:to this type of model (we show this formally in online Appendix D.3).38The result that
28:1088:88072:17:16:89:522:396:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:borrowers without liquidity shocks do not exercise their default option until substantially
28:1089:88163:16:17:89:522:380:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:underwater is consistent with empirical evidence in Bhutta et al. (2017), who show that the
28:1090:88254:17:16:89:522:363:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:median homeowner without a liquidity shock does not default until their LTV is greater
28:1091:88340:16:16:89:522:347:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:than 174, while the result that default jumps once borrowers are moved from positive to
28:1092:88427:16:17:89:522:331:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:negative equity is consistent with the result in Gupta and Hansman (2018), who find that
28:1093:88515:17:16:89:522:314:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:debt increases lead to increased defaults for option ARM borrowers who start with positive

28:1097:88812:11:11:89:522:256:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:with adjustable rate mortgages.  As Fuster and Willen (2017) discuss, to the extent that borrowers are
28:1098:88914:11:11:89:522:245:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:aware of their mortgage terms and follow the movement of underlying index rates, then these estimates
28:1099:89015:11:11:89:522:234:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:may already be capturing only the liquidity e-ects of lower payments since borrowers would already have
28:1100:89118:11:11:89:522:223:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:been anticipating and responding to the long-term payment reductions. Similarly, Scharlemann and Shore

29:1111:90041:16:16:89:522:623:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:uidity is provided, our results imply that maturity-extension-financed payment reduction
29:1112:90129:16:17:89:522:607:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:may generate a Pareto improvement, leaving borrowers, lenders, and taxpayers all better

29:1116:90490:16:17:89:522:541:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:ment”) sees deeper immediate payment reductions that are o-set by continued payments in
29:1117:90577:17:16:89:522:524:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:the long-term. Intuitively, maturity extension is equivalent to the lender “lending” the bor-
29:1118:90670:16:17:89:522:508:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:rower their monthly payment reductions at the mortgage interest rate, with repayments on
29:1119:90758:17:16:89:522:491:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:this “new” loan beginning at the end of the original mortgage term and continuing through
29:1120:90847:16:16:89:231:475:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:the end of the new loan term.
29:1121:90876:16:17:106:523:459:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:For borrowers, a maturity extension which moves funds from the future to the present
29:1122:90960:17:16:89:522:442:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:might be particularly valuable in periods of acute economic distress.  In our setting, all
29:1123:91050:16:17:89:522:426:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:borrowers are better o-in the treatment group under relatively mild assumptions about
29:1124:91135:17:16:89:522:409:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:monotonicity and revealed preference. Borrowers can be divided into four potential groups:
29:1125:91225:16:17:89:522:393:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:those who default under both contracts, those who switch from defaulting to paying on
29:1126:91310:17:16:89:522:376:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:schedule, those who switch from paying on schedule to defaulting, and those who pay on
29:1127:91396:16:16:89:522:360:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:schedule under either contract. The first group defaults under both contracts and is therefore
29:1128:91490:16:17:89:522:344:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:no worse o-receiving treatment. The second group is better o-because they indicate by
29:1129:91575:17:16:89:522:327:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:revealed preference that the modified loan is more attractive than defaulting. If we assume
29:1130:91666:16:17:89:522:311:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:that default is monotonically decreasing with the extent of payment reduction–the canonical
29:1131:91757:17:16:89:522:294:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:assumption from Imbens and Angrist (1994) needed to identify a local average treatment
29:1132:91843:16:17:89:523:278:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:e-ect–then there is no one in the third group. Finally, the fourth group is better o-because
29:1133:91935:17:16:89:522:261:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:their choice set is expanded; they always have the choice to ignore the maturity extension
29:1134:92025:16:17:89:306:245:119:g_d0_f4:64:g_d0_f5:B:and repay the loan on the original schedule.39
29:1135:92071:17:16:106:523:228:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:For lenders, a maturity extension will increase the NPV of total payments owed when the
29:1136:92158:16:16:89:522:212:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:mortgage’s interest rate is higher than the lender’s current discount rate. In this time period
29:1137:92253:16:17:89:522:196:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:the interest rates on new mortgages were a few percentage points below the average interest
29:1138:92344:17:16:89:522:179:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:rate on existing mortgages. Hence, when using current interest rates as a measure of the
29:1139:92432:16:17:89:522:163:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:opportunity cost of capital, extending maturities on existing mortgages would increase the
29:1140:92522:17:16:89:522:146:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:NPV of payments owed to the lender. Although most of the incremental payment reduction
29:1141:92608:16:17:89:522:130:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:at the cuto-we study was achieved from maturity extension, part came from interest rate
29:1142:92695:17:15:89:522:113:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:reduction, which reduces the NPV of payments owed.  This works against the maturity
29:1143:92778:15:15:98:522:98:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:39Borrowers who recently defaulted on their mortgage are likely to want liquidity and so a low-interest
29:1144:92881:15:11:89:522:83:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:loan is likely to be attractive. Relatedly, Argyle et al. (2017) have shown that there is strong consumer
29:1145:92986:11:0:89:314:72:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:demand for extended maturity in the auto loan market.

30:1147:93057:17:16:106:523:692:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:In our setting, we find that the NPV of the payments owed under the contract is similar
30:1148:93144:16:17:89:522:676:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:in the treatment and control group. To be specific, online Appendix Figure 14 shows that
30:1149:93232:17:16:89:522:659:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:treatment lowers NPV by $2,860 relative to the control group when lenders use a 4.11 percent
30:1150:93324:16:17:89:522:643:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:discount rate, which is the average of the 30-year mortgage rate during our sample period.
30:1151:93414:17:16:89:522:626:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:This is a modest loss and with a standard error of $2,025 we are unable to statistically
30:1152:93502:16:17:89:522:610:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:reject that there is no change in the NPV to lenders (consistent with the criteria for a
30:1153:93590:17:16:89:522:593:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:Pareto improvement). This estimate–which assumes that all borrowers repay on schedule–
30:1154:93676:16:16:89:522:577:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:has three shortcomings:  some borrowers default (and treatment reduces default), some
30:1155:93761:16:17:89:522:561:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:borrowers prepay their mortgage, and lenders may discount cash flows after year 30 at a
30:1156:93848:17:16:89:275:544:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:higher rate than short-term cash flows.
30:1157:93887:16:17:106:522:528:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:To address these limitations, we build anexpected paymentsNPV model and find that
30:1158:93968:17:16:89:522:511:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:under plausible assumptions lenders are better o-assigning a borrower to treatment. We
30:1159:94054:16:17:89:522:495:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:proceed in three steps. First, we incorporate default by using our causal estimate of the
30:1160:94143:17:16:89:522:478:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:e-ect of treatment on default.40We combine this with prior evidence on the losses incurred
30:1161:94233:16:16:89:523:462:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:by lenders when borrowers default.41Because treatment significantly reduces default rates,
30:1162:94323:16:17:89:522:446:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:this moves the lender to a gain of $8,301. Second, the fact that the payments arrive further
30:1163:94415:17:16:89:522:429:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:in the future means that we need to use a higher discount rate, which decreases the NPV.
30:1164:94503:16:17:89:522:413:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:We estimate a term premium of 32 basis points between 30- and 40-year mortgages by
30:1165:94585:17:16:89:522:396:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:extrapolating from observed mortgage rates (see online Appendix Figure 21), which shrinks
30:1166:94674:16:17:89:522:380:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:the gain to the lender to $5,279. Finally, we incorporate realistic prepayment behavior for
30:1167:94765:17:16:89:522:363:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:a final estimate of $5,350. We provide more detail on this calculation as well as several
30:1168:94854:16:16:89:282:347:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:robustness checks in online Appendix C.
30:1169:94893:16:17:106:522:331:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:The finding that lenders are better o-from maturity extensions depends on two crucial
30:1170:94978:17:16:89:522:314:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:assumptions.  First, we assume that prevailing mortgage interest rates accurately reflect
30:1171:95067:16:17:89:522:298:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:a lender’s opportunity cost of capital.  But if some lenders are liquidity-constrained (as
30:1172:95157:17:16:89:522:281:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:might be implied by the fall in mortgage originations during this time period), then market
30:1173:95248:16:17:89:522:265:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:rates for those borrowers who can get a mortgage might not reflect a lender’s true cost of
30:1174:95338:17:16:89:522:248:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:capital.42We calculate that a lender is better o-from treatment as long as her discount rate
30:1175:95430:16:16:89:522:232:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:is below 6.02 percent. Second, we assume that implied mortgage spreads accurately capture
30:1176:95519:16:15:98:523:216:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:40Using our causal estimate of the e-ect of treatment implicitly assumes that maturity extension does not
30:1177:95624:15:11:89:522:201:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:raise defaults outside of the time horizon we observe in the data. This assumption could fail because maturity
30:1178:95734:11:11:89:522:190:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:extension slows the repayment of principal and higher LTVs might raise long-term default rates. However,
30:1179:95838:11:11:89:522:179:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:this higher LTV e-ect should be weighed against the e-ect of maturity extension on mortgage payments,
30:1180:95939:11:11:89:522:168:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:which are still lower on average 22 years after modification. After 22 years, all borrowers will have regained

30:1182:96158:7:15:98:522:150:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:41Defaults impose losses on lenders both because the house is underwater and because foreclosed homes
30:1183:96259:15:11:89:522:135:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:sell at a discount relative to their market value. We assume that a foreclosure or short sale causes a lender
30:1184:96368:11:10:89:522:124:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:loss equal to 56 percent of the unpaid balance of the loan, equal to the losses experienced by Fannie Mae
30:1185:96473:10:11:89:522:114:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:on foreclosures and short sales in 2011 (Fannie Mae 2018). In the online Appendix C, we show that our
30:1186:96574:11:11:89:523:103:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:conclusion that lenders are not measurably worse o-in terms of expected payments is robust to alternative
30:1187:96679:11:8:89:335:92:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:assumptions about the lender’s recovery rate on foreclosures.
30:1188:96740:8:0:98:488:84:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:?:42Online Appendix Figure 22a shows the time series of mortgage originations during this period.

31:1190:96923:17:16:89:522:692:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:of uncertainty over this spread, we show that our results are robust to using a variety of
31:1191:97013:16:17:89:522:676:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:term premium assumptions in online Appendix C. However, the term premium we use in
31:1192:97095:17:16:89:522:659:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:our baseline case (32 basis points) is already significantly higher than the actual 30- to

31:1194:97270:17:16:89:522:626:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:points, respectively). Furthermore, the flat swap yield curve during this time period implies
31:1195:97363:16:17:89:522:610:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:that a lender concerned about increased portfolio duration risk from extending mortgage
31:1196:97450:17:16:89:358:593:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:maturities could hedge this risk at low incremental cost.
31:1197:97507:16:16:106:523:577:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Finally, taxpayers are also better o-from more maturity extensions. The government
31:1198:97589:16:17:89:522:561:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:spent substantial resources subsidizing HAMP modifications above the eligibility cuto-with

31:1201:97854:17:16:89:522:511:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:had large payment reductions and low default rates.  This suggests that using maturity
31:1202:97940:16:17:89:522:495:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:extensions as the first step in modifying mortgages could have saved substantial taxpayer
31:1203:98029:17:16:89:134:478:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:subsidies.
31:1204:98039:16:16:106:523:462:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Indeed, our results raise concerns that HAMP’s structure led to the crowding out of al-
31:1205:98126:16:17:89:522:446:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:ternative private modifications that would have led to lower defaults while saving taxpayer
31:1206:98217:17:16:89:522:429:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:money. The 31 percent PTI target in HAMP means that borrowers with pre-modification

31:1211:98661:16:16:89:523:347:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:without requiring any government subsidy.43About 40 percent of all borrowers with HAMP
31:1212:98747:16:17:89:522:331:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:modifications (625,000 borrowers) were in this region, and the government spent approx-
31:1213:98834:17:16:89:522:314:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:imately $7 billion subsidizing potentially less e-ective modifications for these borrowers.
31:1214:98925:16:17:89:522:298:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:Furthermore, the government explicitly prohibited servicers from o-ering alternative pri-

31:1216:99100:16:17:89:523:265:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:the private modifications would not be as e-ective as those subsidized by the government.
31:1217:99189:17:16:89:522:248:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:Our data on private modifications and the HAMP-first requirement indicate that HAMP
31:1218:99272:16:17:89:523:232:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:crowded out private modifications that could have been more e-ective for a large fraction
31:1219:99361:17:15:89:293:215:119:g_d0_f4:64:g_d0_f5:B:of borrowers in the government program.44
31:1220:99402:15:15:98:522:200:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:43The results are likely to extend to non-GSE and non-Chase borrowers.  Averaging over all private
31:1221:99500:15:11:89:523:185:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:modifications, the average payment reduction was around 20% (O-ce of the Comptroller of the Currency
31:1222:99600:11:11:89:522:174:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:2012), which suggests that the private sector was willing to facilitate substantial payment reductions in
31:1223:99705:11:11:89:522:163:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:the absence of HAMP subsidies. On the other hand, Agarwal et al. (2017a) show that there is important

31:1225:99885:7:15:98:522:145:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:44While our emphasis is on crowd-out on the intensive margin of the quality of modifications, Agarwal
31:1226:99986:15:11:89:522:130:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:et al. (2017a) provide evidence on the extensive margin in terms of the quantity of modifications. They
31:1227:100089:11:11:89:522:119:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:show that each HAMP modification is associated with about 0.84 more “net” modifications, suggesting
31:1228:100188:11:11:89:522:108:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:that the program did not substantially reduce the total number of private modifications that would have
31:1229:100291:11:11:89:523:97:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:been o-ered in the absence of the program.  They argue that by inducing more borrowers to apply for
31:1230:100390:11:11:89:522:86:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:modifications, HAMP increased the private modification rate of HAMP-ineligible borrowers, o-setting the

32:1236:100955:16:17:89:522:643:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:Our findings suggest that among these options, those that maximize immediate payment

32:1238:101128:16:17:89:522:610:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:to achieve large immediate payment reductions at little cost to lenders and taxpayers. We

32:1242:101378:27:16:106:523:528:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Our empirical research designs capture the two extremes in the debate about mortgage
32:1243:101462:16:16:89:522:512:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:modification design. Recall from the introduction that Treasury Secretary Timothy Geith-
32:1244:101550:16:17:89:522:496:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:ner has explained that the government’s “biggest debate was whether to try to reduce overall
32:1245:101642:17:16:89:522:479:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:mortgage loans or just monthly payments.” Our first research design captures the pole of
32:1246:101730:16:17:89:523:463:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:o-ering borrowers housing wealth by forgiving mortgage principal without any immediate
32:1247:101816:17:16:89:522:446:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:change in liquidity. The second captures the pole of o-ering borrowers liquidity with ap-
32:1248:101905:16:17:89:522:430:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:proximately no change in wealth. In fact, most of the 10 million government-subsidized and
32:1249:101995:17:16:89:522:413:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:private sector modifications completed during the Great Recession a-ected both liquidity
32:1250:102083:16:17:89:522:397:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:and wealth. In this section, we explain how our results help to answer the question of how
32:1251:102173:17:16:89:523:380:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:to e-ciently design mortgage modifications for all borrowers, and we quantify the potential
32:1252:102264:16:16:89:522:364:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:gains of implementing our proposed design relative to the mortgage modifications that were
32:1253:102354:16:17:89:171:348:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:actually pursued.
32:1254:102371:17:16:106:523:331:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Our empirical findings that default is responsive to liquidity but not wealth suggest a
32:1255:102458:16:17:89:522:315:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:simple principle for reducing mortgage defaults: the “best” modification steps are those that
32:1256:102551:17:16:89:522:298:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:achieve immediate payment reduction at the lowest possible cost. The costs of payment
32:1257:102636:16:17:89:522:282:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:reductions must be born by either lenders or taxpayers.  Minimizing costs per dollar of
32:1258:102723:17:16:89:522:265:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:immediate liquidity provision will maximize the amount of payment reduction (and hence
32:1259:102809:16:16:89:522:249:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:default reduction) that the market will find privately optimal to provide on its own and
32:1260:102897:16:17:89:522:233:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:identify the most e-cient use of government subsidies. Hence, we call modifications that
32:1261:102985:17:16:89:468:216:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:follow this minimum-cost structure “e-cient default-minimizing modifications.”

32:1264:103238:16:17:89:522:167:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:private modification programs we are aware of: maturity extension, temporary five-year

32:1266:103416:16:16:89:522:134:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:cipal forgiveness. These policies all reduce mortgage payments for at least five years, but
32:1267:103507:16:20:89:523:118:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:have very di-erent costs.  We calculate these costs for an illustrative mortgage with the

32:1269:103698:11:11:89:522:87:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:and had lower short-term default rates, if they had remained in private modifications designed to emphasize
32:1270:103805:11:0:89:310:76:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:payment reduction rather than an income-ratio target.

33:1275:104191:16:17:89:522:643:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:extension is NPV-positiveby nearly $20,000 for the lender because the interest rate on the
33:1276:104281:17:16:89:522:626:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:loan is higher than the lender’s discount rate (recall that interest rates on new mortgages
33:1277:104372:16:17:89:522:610:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:fell substantially during the crisis, so the spread between the old rate on the mortgage being

33:1284:104984:16:17:89:522:495:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:modification steps we find that the costs to the lender are lower when we incorporate these

33:1287:105234:16:17:89:522:446:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:of payment reduction targets.  As we note above, by e-cient we mean that we use the
33:1288:105317:17:16:89:522:429:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:lowest-cost policies first. We assume there are limits to how much some mortgage terms can
33:1289:105407:16:17:89:522:413:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:plausibly change. For example, maturity extension cannot possibly reduce payments below
33:1290:105494:17:16:89:522:396:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:the interest payments on the unpaid balance. We restrict the set of possible modifications
33:1291:105584:16:17:89:522:380:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:using the quantitative limits implemented by the HAMP, Chase, and GSE modification
33:1292:105666:17:16:89:522:363:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:programs: we allow for maturity extension up to 40 years, we allow temporary interest rates
33:1293:105757:16:16:89:522:347:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:to be reduced to 2 percent and we allow permanent interest rates to be reduced to the
33:1294:105842:16:17:89:522:331:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:prevailing 30-year mortgage rate. Adopting these limits makes our characterization of the
33:1295:105931:17:16:89:485:314:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:potential gains from more e-ciently-designed mortgage modifications conservative.
33:1296:106012:16:17:106:522:298:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:The e-cient default-minimizing modification uses maturity extension, followed by tem-
33:1297:106097:17:16:89:522:281:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:porary interest rate reduction, followed by principal forbearance, and never principal for-
33:1298:106188:16:16:89:522:265:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:giveness. In Figure 6b, we depict the cost of such a modification. Maturity extension can
33:1299:106277:16:15:98:522:249:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:45This loan has a 6.7 percent fixed interest rate, a 23-year remaining term, an unpaid balance of $248,000
33:1300:106383:15:7:89:251:234:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:and a loan-to-value ratio of 131 percent.
33:1301:106424:7:15:98:522:227:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:46We use the same assumptions to calculate expected payments NPV calculation as in Section 6.2.1. We
33:1302:106524:15:11:89:522:212:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:need one new assumption, which is a function that maps payment reduction to default rates for lower levels
33:1303:106630:11:11:89:522:201:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:of payment reduction. We extrapolate from our evidence on default rates and online Appendix Figure 23
33:1304:106731:11:7:89:167:190:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:shows the function.
33:1305:106750:7:15:98:522:183:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:47One limitation of this ranking is that it assumes that payment reduction over a five-year horizon is the
33:1306:106856:15:11:89:522:168:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:main driver of a policy’s e-ect on a loan’s lifetime default rate. Implicitly, we are assuming that payments
33:1307:106964:11:11:89:522:157:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:in the next five years are the relevant variable for the re-default probability of a borrower who is currently
33:1308:107074:11:11:89:522:146:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:in financial distress. This assumption could be wrong in either direction. On one hand, perhaps reducing
33:1309:107178:11:11:89:522:135:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:payments for one year or three years can deliver much of the same reduction in defaults with even less
33:1310:107280:11:10:89:522:124:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:cost. On the other hand, default could rise substantially when payments rise in year six, though empirical
33:1311:107386:10:11:89:522:114:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:evidence in Scharlemann and Shore 2017 shows that this e-ect is quantitatively small. A payment increase
33:1312:107490:11:11:89:522:103:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:of about 10 percent in year six raises the default rate in the following year from 3.8 percent to 4.6 percent.
33:1313:107600:11:11:89:522:92:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:Unfortunately, our empirical evidence does not speak to this question and we think that understanding the
33:1314:107705:11:0:89:415:81:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:optimal duration of payment reductions is an important area for future research.

34:1316:107877:17:16:89:522:692:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:ments can be reduced by an additional 41 percent by reducing the temporary interest rate
34:1317:107965:16:17:89:522:676:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:to 2 percent, and forbearance can reduce payments even further.48The figure also shows
34:1318:108051:17:16:89:522:659:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:the cost of principal forgiveness. Together these two lines show the envelope of the least
34:1319:108141:16:17:89:522:643:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:and most costly ways to achieve various amounts of payment reduction and hence various
34:1320:108227:17:16:89:230:626:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:amounts of default reduction.
34:1321:108256:16:17:106:523:610:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:The modification policies actually used during the crisis occupy an intermediate position
34:1322:108345:17:16:89:523:593:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:within the envelope of the most e-cient and least e-cient policies. Recall that HAMP tar-
34:1323:108434:16:16:89:522:577:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:gets a PTI ratio of 31 percent. This means that borrowers receive widely-varying amounts
34:1324:108522:16:17:89:522:561:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:of payment reduction on the basis of their initial PTI ratio. As discussed in Section 3.1,
34:1325:108612:17:16:89:522:544:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:HAMP first reduces the permanent interest rate, then the temporary interest rate, then
34:1326:108698:16:17:89:522:528:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:extends the mortgage term, and finally does principal forbearance. Figure 6b shows that by
34:1327:108788:17:16:89:522:511:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:first reducing the permanent rate, HAMP has a marginal cost for small payment reductions
34:1328:108876:16:17:89:523:495:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:that is very close to the cost of principal forgiveness and much larger than the e-cient
34:1329:108964:17:16:89:522:478:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:default-minimizing modification, which uses maturity extension first. HAMP Principal Re-
34:1330:109052:16:16:89:522:462:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:duction Alternative (PRA), which o-ered principal reduction as the first step in a mortgage
34:1331:109143:16:17:89:522:446:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:modification (see Section 3.1 for details) has an even higher cost from payment reductions.
34:1332:109234:17:16:89:522:429:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:The figure shows that HAMP PRA follows the upper envelope of the least e-cient policy
34:1333:109319:16:17:89:522:413:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:until a payment reduction of 17 percent is reached. After that, the path of the HAMP PRA
34:1334:109407:17:16:89:317:396:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:line parallels the standard HAMP modification.
34:1335:109453:16:17:106:523:380:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:In sharp contrast to government-designed HAMP modifications, practitioner-designed
34:1336:109535:17:16:89:522:363:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:modifications are much closer to the e-cient frontier. Recall from Section 5.1 that the GSEs
34:1337:109627:16:16:89:522:347:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:and Chase o-ered most borrowers maturity extension, followed by permanent rate reduction,
34:1338:109716:16:17:89:522:331:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:temporary rate reduction (Chase only), and then principal forbearance.49Because the GSEs
34:1339:109804:17:16:89:522:314:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:and Chase had a specific payment reduction target, we depict them in Figure 6b using dots
34:1340:109893:16:17:89:338:298:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:rather than the lines that we used to depict HAMP.

34:1342:110015:16:17:89:522:265:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:that modifications in a future crisis can be redesigned to make borrowers, lenders, and tax-

34:1344:110196:16:17:89:522:232:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:modification structure in comparison to HAMP, where the median borrower received a 38
34:1345:110281:17:16:89:522:215:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:percent payment reduction. We consider two ways to quantify the potential gains of more
34:1346:110368:16:16:89:196:199:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:e-cient modifications.
34:1347:110390:16:17:106:522:183:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:First, using our “e-cient default-minimizing modification” structure we find that the
34:1348:110475:17:16:89:522:166:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:same median payment reduction could have been provided at $63,000 lower cost per mod-
34:1349:110560:16:15:98:523:150:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:48Our estimates imply than a lender would break-even by o-ering a payment reduction of 65 percent
34:1350:110657:15:10:89:522:135:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:through a maturity extension to 40 years, a temporary interest rate reduction down to 2 percent, and principal
34:1351:110767:10:11:89:522:125:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:forbearance of 18 percent of the loan balance. Online Appendix Figure 25a shows that when we incorporate
34:1352:110871:11:11:89:522:114:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:the social cost of foreclosure of $51,000 from U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (2010),
34:1353:110974:11:11:89:522:103:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:the break-even point for lenders and taxpayers is a payment reduction of 70 percent. Online Appendix Figure
34:1354:111081:11:8:89:504:92:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:25b shows that the same broad patterns hold for payments owed NPV as for expected payments NPV.
34:1355:111176:8:0:98:408:84:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:?:49Chase also o-ered principal forgiveness to some borrowers with high LTVs.
35:1356:111253:0:17:89:522:709:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:ification to lenders and taxpayers. This is equal to 26 percent of the unpaid balance of a
35:1357:111343:17:16:89:522:692:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:typical loan.50Aggregating over all 1.7 million HAMP modifications, this implies a poten-
35:1358:111432:16:17:89:522:676:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:tial unnecessary cost of $108 billion. Taxpayers spent around $27 billion subsidizing HAMP
35:1359:111522:17:16:89:522:659:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:modifications (Government Accountability O-ce 2016). Therefore, our results imply that
35:1360:111608:16:17:89:522:643:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:HAMP could have been designed with no taxpayer subsidies and a much lower cost to
35:1361:111689:17:16:89:417:626:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:investors, while maintaining the same amount of payment reduction.
35:1362:111755:16:17:106:523:610:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Alternatively, if we allocate all the gains from redesigning modifications to reducing
35:1363:111841:17:16:89:522:593:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:borrower payments, the same amount of lender and taxpayer cost can be used to achieve
35:1364:111926:16:16:89:522:577:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:substantially more default reduction. Again considering the median HAMP borrower, we
35:1365:112010:16:17:89:522:561:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:find that an additional 33 percentage points of payment reduction could have been provided
35:1366:112100:17:16:89:522:544:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:at the same cost, cutting default rates by one-third. Aggregating over all HAMP modifi-
35:1367:112187:16:17:89:522:528:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:cations, this implies that 240,000 defaults could have been avoided at no additional cost to
35:1368:112279:17:16:89:188:511:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:lenders or taxpayers.
35:1369:112300:16:17:106:523:495:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Our proposed approach has benefits beyond improving outcomes for borrowers in a gov-
35:1370:112384:17:16:89:522:478:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:ernment program.  For example, the potential default reduction would be even larger if
35:1371:112470:16:16:89:522:462:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:we considered redesigningallthe 10 million public and private modifications completed in
35:1372:112558:16:17:89:522:446:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:the Great Recession. Furthermore, when incorporating the $51,000 social cost of foreclo-
35:1373:112646:17:16:89:522:429:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:sures estimated in U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (2010), the default
35:1374:112733:16:17:89:522:413:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:reduction just from re-designing HAMP would have generated $6 billion in social value.
35:1375:112819:17:16:89:522:396:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:Taken together, these results suggest that the gains in a future modification program could
35:1376:112910:16:17:89:522:380:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:be divided such that borrowers, lenders and taxpayers all benefit relative to what was im-

35:1383:113469:16:17:89:522:265:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:to allow underwater borrowers to refinance without needing to become delinquent to get
35:1384:113555:17:16:89:522:248:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:HAMP. Compared to HAMP, a modification with little change in the NPV of payments
35:1385:113635:16:17:89:522:232:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:owed may not be attractive to borrowers who are current on their mortgages, and, even if

35:1389:113918:17:16:89:522:150:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:debate about optimal ex-ante mortgage design. A number of recent papers have analyzed
35:1390:114003:16:16:89:522:134:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:alternative mortgage contracts with built-in features designed to assist households overcome
35:1391:114095:16:17:89:522:118:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:periods of financial distress. Eberly and Krishnamurthy (2014) propose a fixed rate mortgage
35:1392:114187:17:15:98:522:101:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:50Although our estimate of the potential value from well-designed modifications is large, it is similar to
35:1393:114293:15:11:89:522:86:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:prior work by Maturana (2017) showing that private modifications raised the NPV of a loan by 16 percent
35:1394:114396:11:0:89:179:75:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:of the unpaid balance.

36:1396:114507:17:16:89:522:692:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:et al. (2018a) develop an equilibrium model of the housing market to evaluate this contract.
36:1397:114599:16:17:89:522:676:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:They find that the option to convert to an ARM is more e-ective than alternative contracts
36:1398:114689:17:16:89:522:659:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:because it front-loads the payment reduction to the borrower, and does so at similar cost
36:1399:114778:16:17:89:522:643:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:to the lender. Our results provide empirical evidence that contracts front-loading payment
36:1400:114868:17:16:89:522:626:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:reductions to households in financial distress will be more e-ective at preventing defaults
36:1401:114959:16:17:89:522:610:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:than an alternative contract with equal cost to the lender that spreads payment reductions
36:1402:115049:17:16:89:238:593:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:throughout the mortgage term.
36:1403:115078:16:16:106:523:577:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Similarly, we also provide empirical support for proposals specifically contemplating the
36:1404:115167:16:17:89:522:561:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:option to extend mortgage maturities. Campbell et al. (2018) compare an ARM with a re-
36:1405:115253:17:16:89:522:544:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:finance option to an ARM with the option to temporarily allow for interest-only payments
36:1406:115341:16:17:89:522:528:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:with a corresponding increase in its maturity. They find that this maturity extension option
36:1407:115433:17:16:89:522:511:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:outperforms a refinance option because it provides similar liquidity-provision benefits to bor-
36:1408:115528:16:17:89:522:495:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:rowers at much lower cost to lenders. Our results show that immediate payment reduction
36:1409:115615:17:16:89:523:478:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:can indeed be e-ective at reducing defaults even if structured with o-setting payments in
36:1410:115704:16:28:89:304:462:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:the future so as to minimize costs to lenders.

36:1412:115778:30:16:106:523:404:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:In this section we explore the positive and normative implications of our consumption
36:1413:115863:16:17:89:522:388:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:results.  From a positive perspective, we describe a simple model that clarifies that ac-
36:1414:115952:17:16:89:522:371:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:cess to liquidity can explain why the tight link between housing wealth and consumption
36:1415:116039:16:16:89:522:355:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:breaks down for underwater borrowers. We find that collateral constraints drive a wedge
36:1416:116126:16:17:89:522:339:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:between an underwater borrower’s MPC out of cash and their MPC out of housing wealth.
36:1417:116211:17:16:89:522:322:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:From a normative perspective, this implies that payment reduction policies are at least 10
36:1418:116301:16:17:89:523:306:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:times more e-ective than principal reduction at stimulating the consumption of underwater
36:1419:116390:17:23:89:139:289:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:borrowers.

36:1421:116471:26:16:106:523:240:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:In Section 4.3 we showed that our estimated MPC out of housing wealth for underwater
36:1422:116555:16:17:89:522:224:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:borrowers is an order of magnitude smaller than the MPC for average borrowers analyzed in
36:1423:116644:17:16:89:522:207:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:prior studies. Furthermore, prior research had shown that highly leveraged (but still above
36:1424:116735:16:17:89:522:191:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:water) borrowers had even higher MPCs, driving arguments in favor of principal reduction
36:1425:116823:17:16:89:351:174:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:as a way to stimulate consumption during a downturn.
36:1426:116875:16:17:106:523:158:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:We argue that the inability of underwater borrowers to monetize the wealth gains from
36:1427:116960:17:16:89:522:141:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:principal reduction can explain why they are far less sensitive to housing wealth changes
36:1428:117049:16:16:89:522:125:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:than borrowers in other economic conditions. In the changes examined in prior research,
36:1429:117136:16:17:89:522:109:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:housing wealth gains expanded borrowers’ credit access. Mian and Sufi (2014a) show that
36:1430:117223:17:16:89:522:92:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:equity withdrawal through increased borrowing can account for the entire e-ect of housing
36:1431:117312:16:0:89:522:76:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:wealth on spending between 2002 and 2006. But if homeowners face a collateral constraint
37:1432:117402:0:17:89:522:709:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:rather than a “natural” borrowing limit allowing them to monetize the present value of
37:1433:117488:17:16:89:522:692:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:their minimum expected lifetime net worth, principal reductions that still leave borrowers
37:1434:117578:16:17:89:522:676:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:underwater will not immediately relax this constraint.51Indeed, Defusco (2017) shows
37:1435:117662:17:16:89:522:659:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:that a significant fraction of the additional borrowing arising from house price gains is due
37:1436:117755:16:17:89:522:643:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:to relaxing collateral constraints.  If borrowers cannot immediately monetize the wealth
37:1437:117843:17:16:89:522:626:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:gained by debt forgiveness, it may not be surprising that they do not respond by increasing
37:1438:117934:16:17:89:160:610:119:g_d0_f4:64:g_d0_f5:B:consumption.52
37:1439:117948:17:16:106:523:593:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:On the other hand, even if borrowing constraints are not relaxed immediately, it is
37:1440:118031:16:16:89:523:577:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:possible that forward-looking agents building up a bu-er of assets could respond if they
37:1441:118119:16:17:89:522:561:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:believed principal forgiveness would relax their constraints in the near future. We calculate
37:1442:118212:17:16:89:522:544:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:that since borrowers remained underwater and collateral constraints had tightened, it would
37:1443:118303:16:17:89:522:528:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:take eight years before the average principal reduction recipient in HAMP would expect to
37:1444:118392:17:16:89:522:511:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:be able to increase borrowing as a result of these principal reductions. A dynamic model of
37:1445:118483:16:17:89:522:495:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:household optimization is useful for understanding whether such a lengthy delay can indeed
37:1446:118573:17:16:89:522:478:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:explain why borrowers did not increase consumption.  We describe such a model in the
37:1447:118657:16:22:89:210:462:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:remainder of this section.

37:1449:118709:26:17:106:523:414:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:In order to more formally explore whether access to liquidity can explain why the tight
37:1450:118796:17:16:89:522:397:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:link between housing wealth and consumption breaks down for underwater borrowers, we
37:1451:118880:16:17:89:522:381:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:build a partial equilibrium life cycle model of consumption and default. We leave the details
37:1452:118973:17:16:89:432:364:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:of the model to the online appendix and discuss the main findings here.
37:1453:119044:16:16:106:523:348:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:The model contains one simple addition relative to the standard life-cycle consumption
37:1454:119130:16:17:89:522:332:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:problem in Carroll et al. (2018): households own a home and can only borrow against their
37:1455:119219:17:16:89:522:315:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:home equity subject to a collateral constraint. When households are far underwater, they
37:1456:119307:16:17:89:522:299:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:are far from the point where the collateral constraint will cease to bind. This means that
37:1457:119397:17:16:89:522:282:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:while debt reductions or house price increases raise housing wealth, households are unable
37:1458:119487:16:17:89:522:266:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:to monetize this wealth in the near term.  Conversely, when house prices fall and LTVs
37:1459:119573:17:16:89:522:249:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:are pushed beyond the initial collateral constraint, consistent with real-world mortgage
37:1460:119661:16:16:89:522:233:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:contracts we do not assume households are forced to immediately repay excess mortgage
37:1461:119746:16:17:89:522:217:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:debt. This contrasts with the treatment of debt as a one-period bond present in some of
37:1462:119833:17:16:89:522:200:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:the prior theoretical literature where forced deleveraging creates a strong link between debt
37:1463:119926:16:17:89:522:184:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:levels and consumption (e.g., Eggertsson and Krugman 2012, Guerrieri and Lorenzoni 2017).
37:1464:120015:17:15:106:523:167:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:The full setup is described in online Appendix Section D.1 and the parameterization is
37:1465:120101:15:15:98:522:152:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:51Beraja et al. (2017) document a related channel: underwater borrowers are usually not able to refinance
37:1466:120206:15:7:89:491:137:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:their mortgages. See Carroll (1992) and Aiyagari (1994) for discussions of natural borrowing limits.
37:1467:120306:7:15:98:522:130:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:52The possibility that liquidity can explain the lack of response is also consistent with prior research looking
37:1468:120418:15:11:89:522:115:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:at large price declines. Mian et al. (2013) and Kaplan et al. (2016) both document a non-linearity in the
37:1469:120523:11:11:89:522:104:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:consumption response to house price declines, with a large MPC for small declines but a decreasing MPC for
37:1470:120629:11:11:89:522:93:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:large declines. Mian et al. (2013) suggest that the non-linearity they document could be caused by smaller
37:1471:120735:11:10:89:522:82:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:responses once borrowers become underwater. Similarly, our evidence suggests that for borrowers who start
37:1472:120840:10:0:89:422:72:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:substantially underwater, gains in housing wealth do not a-ect their consumption.
38:1473:120923:0:17:89:522:709:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:described in section D.2. In section D.4.1 we show that this simple model can quantitively
38:1474:121013:17:16:89:522:692:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:match estimates in the prior literature for the consumption response to housing price changes
38:1475:121106:16:17:89:522:676:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:of both average and highly leveraged (but above water) households. We now consider its
38:1476:121192:17:22:89:249:659:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:lessons for underwater borrowers.

38:1478:121284:26:17:106:523:611:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:A reduction in mortgage debt levels a-ects today’s consumption through two channels.
38:1479:121368:17:16:89:522:594:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:The first is a future cash-on-hand e-ect.  Reducing mortgage debt reduces a borrower’s
38:1480:121454:16:17:89:522:578:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:housing payments over time and increases a homeowner’s expected home equity gain when
38:1481:121539:17:16:89:522:561:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:they sell the house. These translate into consumption according to the homeowner’s MPC
38:1482:121625:16:17:89:522:545:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:out of cash-on-hand gains at future dates. The second channel is a collateral e-ect. Reducing
38:1483:121718:17:16:89:522:528:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:debt levels frees up home equity that raises the household’s borrowing limit over time.
38:1484:121805:16:16:89:522:512:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:This change translates into consumption today according to the homeowner’s MPC out of
38:1485:121890:16:17:89:522:496:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:increased collateral in future dates. We show this decomposition formally in online Appendix

38:1487:121996:16:17:106:523:463:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:This clarifies that the key forces determining the consumption response to debt for-
38:1488:122080:17:16:89:522:446:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:giveness are the timeline under which debt reductions translate into higher cash-on-hand
38:1489:122168:16:17:89:522:430:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:(through lower payments or through home sale) and increased borrowing capacity, and the
38:1490:122255:17:16:89:522:413:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:borrower’s MPC out of these future cash-on-hand and future collateral gains. Berger et al.

38:1492:122435:17:16:89:522:380:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:depends on current home values and the marginal propensity to consume out of wealth. Our
38:1493:122523:16:16:89:522:364:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:analysis adds that the MPC out of wealth gains will depend crucially on a borrower’s initial
38:1494:122615:16:17:89:522:348:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:home equity position. Underwater borrowers receiving a dollar of housing wealth are only
38:1495:122703:17:16:89:522:331:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:able to monetize this gain by borrowing or selling their home once they are above water,
38:1496:122791:16:17:89:522:315:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:which may be far in the future. In this case, the consumption response today will depend
38:1497:122879:17:16:89:471:298:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:on a household’s MPC out of expected cash or collateral gains far in the future.
38:1498:122959:16:17:106:523:282:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:In our model, households are unresponsive to cash or collateral gains far in the future.
38:1499:123047:17:16:89:522:265:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:To explain why they are unresponsive, it is helpful to divide households into three categories
38:1500:123141:16:16:89:522:249:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:based on their cash-on-hand relative to permanent income. First, households with low cash-
38:1501:123231:16:17:89:522:233:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:on-hand consume all their assets each period. These households are only responsive to cash
38:1502:123321:17:16:89:522:216:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:or collateral they can access today. Second, households with moderate levels of cash-on-hand
38:1503:123413:16:17:89:522:200:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:are building up a bu-er of assets. For these households, near-term cash or collateral reduces
38:1504:123506:17:16:89:522:183:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:the precautionary value of saving in the current period and increases consumption. However,
38:1505:123597:16:17:89:522:167:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:cash or collateral grants several years in the future have no precautionary value and do not
38:1506:123689:17:16:89:523:150:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:a-ect spending. Third, high cash-on-hand households consume only the annuity value of
38:1507:123774:16:16:89:522:134:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:cash grants regardless of their timing. We show this visually by plotting the consumption
38:1508:123863:16:17:89:475:118:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:response to future cash and future collateral gains in online Appendix Figure 26.
38:1509:123944:17:16:106:523:101:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:The lack of response to future cash and collateral gains can explain why HAMP-type
38:1510:124026:16:0:89:522:85:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:principal reduction failed to increase consumption. We explore this in the model by consid-
39:1511:124119:0:17:89:522:709:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:ering the consumption response to principal forgiveness for a household matching the typical
39:1512:124211:17:16:89:522:692:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:HAMP borrower. By design, principal reduction in HAMP had no incremental e-ect on
39:1513:124292:16:17:89:522:676:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:payments relative to alternative modifications until year six, and we find that it would be
39:1514:124383:17:16:89:522:659:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:eight years before principal forgiveness translated into increased borrowing capacity.53Since
39:1515:124476:16:17:89:522:643:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:no groups of borrowers have strong consumption responses to cash and collateral gains so far
39:1516:124568:17:16:89:522:626:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:in the future, we find that this can explain why HAMP did not lead to increased spending
39:1517:124656:16:17:89:174:610:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:in the short term.
39:1518:124674:17:16:106:523:593:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:This can be seen visually in Figure 7a, which shows the consumption function out of
39:1519:124757:16:16:89:522:577:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:increasing amounts of principal reduction for borrowers starting at an LTV of 150 (the
39:1520:124843:16:17:89:522:561:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:median LTV for HAMP principal reduction recipients).  It shows that the consumption
39:1521:124926:17:16:89:522:544:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:function out of home equity gains is S-shaped, convex in a small region below the collateral
39:1522:125018:16:17:89:522:528:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:constraint, and concave above it. Borrowers are insensitive to principal reductions until such
39:1523:125112:17:16:89:522:511:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:reductions bring them close to their constraint. Principal reduction for deeply underwater
39:1524:125202:16:17:89:522:495:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:borrowers does not relax current constraints and has little precautionary value, hence con-
39:1525:125293:17:16:89:522:478:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:sumption is una-ected. In online Appendix Section D.4.4 we show quantitatively that the
39:1526:125380:16:16:89:522:462:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:MPC out of HAMP-like principal reduction is close to zero under a variety of alternative
39:1527:125468:16:17:89:177:446:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:parameterizations.
39:1528:125486:17:16:106:523:429:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Our result contrasts with debt overhang models in which forced deleveraging leads to
39:1529:125570:16:17:89:522:413:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:depressed consumption.  For example, in Eggertsson and Krugman (2012) and Guerrieri
39:1530:125653:17:16:89:522:396:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:and Lorenzoni (2017), debt is modeled as a one-period bond. In this setting, when a credit
39:1531:125743:16:17:89:522:380:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:crunch reduces the borrowing limit, borrowers who find themselves beyond the borrowing
39:1532:125829:17:16:89:522:363:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:constraint are forced to immediately cut consumption in order to delever. Applying this
39:1533:125916:16:16:89:522:347:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:assumption to the mortgage setting implies that when housing prices fall such that the LTV
39:1534:126006:16:17:89:522:331:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:ratio becomes greater than 100, borrowers need to immediately repay their outstanding debt
39:1535:126096:17:16:89:522:314:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:until they are above water. Under this hypothetical scenario, borrowers receiving principal
39:1536:126187:16:17:89:522:298:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:reduction would see immediate decreases in the amount of forced repayment.  Principal
39:1537:126272:17:16:89:405:281:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:reduction would increase consumption by reducing debt overhang.
39:1538:126335:16:17:106:523:265:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:But in practice, as in our model, mortgages in particular are long-term loans. Nothing
39:1539:126421:17:16:89:522:248:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:forces borrowers to immediately delever when they are far underwater. Modeling housing

39:1541:126597:17:16:89:523:215:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:present in some of the prior literature, and reduces the expected e-ectiveness of mortgage
39:1542:126687:16:16:89:522:199:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:debt reduction policies.  Other recent papers to consider the e-ect of debt and housing

39:1545:126918:16:15:98:522:150:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:53This eight years estimate is based on the HAMP mortgage contract, which left borrowers underwater
39:1546:127017:15:11:89:522:135:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:with a median LTV ratio after modification of 114, an assumption that homeowners can only borrow up to
39:1547:127119:11:11:89:522:124:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:80% of the value of their home in this time period, and an assumption of 1% real annual house price growth

40:1551:127417:27:16:106:523:682:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:The inability to monetize housing wealth drives a wedge between an underwater bor-
40:1552:127499:16:17:89:522:666:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:rower’s marginal propensity to consume out of cash and their marginal propensity to con-
40:1553:127587:17:16:89:522:649:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:sume out of housing wealth.  This can be observed visually in Figure 7b.  In this figure
40:1554:127675:16:17:89:522:633:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:we take low-cash-on-hand borrowers at various LTV levels and plot the MPC out of $1 of
40:1555:127761:17:16:89:522:616:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:cash or $1 of housing wealth gained by principal reduction. As in the empirical results in
40:1556:127851:16:16:89:522:600:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:Mian et al. (2013), borrowers near their collateral constraint have a high MPC out of hous-
40:1557:127942:16:17:89:522:584:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:ing wealth gains. However, borrowers far underwater are unresponsive to housing wealth
40:1558:128028:17:16:89:522:567:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:changes even though they are highly responsive to cash transfers. This highlights one way
40:1559:128117:16:17:89:522:551:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:that housing wealth is special. Because it can only be monetized when borrowers have pos-
40:1560:128206:17:16:89:522:534:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:itive home equity above a collateral constraint, borrowers respond less to housing wealth
40:1561:128295:16:23:89:219:518:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:gains than they do to cash.

40:1563:128381:26:17:106:523:469:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Our wedge result implies that high leverage is a bad “tag” for targeting policies that
40:1564:128467:17:16:89:522:452:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:increase housing wealth, even though it is a good “tag” for targeting policies trying to
40:1565:128555:16:17:89:522:436:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:provide cash to borrowers with high MPCs. Our empirical and theoretical results show that
40:1566:128644:17:16:89:522:419:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:principal reduction will fail to stimulate consumption for underwater borrowers. However,
40:1567:128733:16:17:89:522:403:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:our model suggests that low-wealth, underwater borrowers would have an MPC out of cash
40:1568:128819:17:16:89:522:386:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:around 30 cents. This high MPC is qualitatively consistent with the sensitivity of spending
40:1569:128910:16:16:89:522:370:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:to payment reduction from our event study graphs in Figure 3a. It is also quantitatively
40:1570:128998:16:17:89:522:354:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:consistent with DiMaggio et al. (2017) who find that underwater borrowers have MPCs out
40:1571:129085:17:16:89:391:337:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:of cash more than twice as high as non-underwater households.
40:1572:129146:16:17:106:523:321:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:We find that payment reduction is substantially more cost e-ective than principal re-
40:1573:129231:17:16:89:522:304:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:duction at stabilizing consumption. The government spent an average of $0.30 to subsidize
40:1574:129320:16:17:89:522:288:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:each dollar of principal forgiveness in HAMP, for a total government cost of $4.6 billion.
40:1575:129410:17:16:89:522:271:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:Our model suggests that if the same amount of money had been spent on direct transfers to
40:1576:129499:16:16:89:522:255:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:borrowers, the partial equilibrium spending increase would have been $1.4 billion–ten times
40:1577:129590:16:17:89:522:239:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:more than even the upper bound of our estimates for the consumption response to prin-
40:1578:129675:17:16:89:522:222:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:cipal forgiveness would suggest. Policies seeking to raise aggregate demand by increasing
40:1579:129764:16:17:89:522:206:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:the housing wealth of leveraged borrowers will be ine-ective precisely when policymakers
40:1580:129852:17:16:89:522:189:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:might otherwise want to use them, i.e., in times when many borrowers are underwater and
40:1581:129939:16:17:89:265:173:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:collateral constraints have tightened.
40:1582:129977:17:16:106:522:156:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:This finding reinforces the conclusions in Section 6.2.2 about e-cient modification de-
40:1583:130064:16:16:89:522:140:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:sign. That section focused on the default-reduction gains from maximizing immediate pay-
40:1584:130152:16:17:89:522:124:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:ment reduction for a given amount of lender and taxpayer cost. Our results here imply that
40:1585:130242:17:16:89:422:107:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:the same structure would also maximize immediate demand stimulus.
40:1586:130307:16:17:106:522:91:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Although principal reduction as implemented during the crisis is an ine-ective way to
40:1587:130392:17:0:89:523:74:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:provide immediate stimulus, it is possible for principal reduction policies to a-ect consump-
41:1588:130487:0:17:89:522:709:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:tion.  We consider two cases.  First, although we show that principal reduction has no
41:1589:130573:17:16:89:522:692:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:immediate e-ect on consumption, in the long-term principal reduction translates into lower
41:1590:130663:16:17:89:522:676:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:payments and increased borrowing capacity and hence should eventually a-ect consumption.
41:1591:130751:17:16:89:522:659:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:Although we cannot analyze this e-ect empirically within our sample window, our model
41:1592:130836:16:17:89:522:643:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:shows that consumption would likely begin responding about five years after modification
41:1593:130924:17:16:89:522:626:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:for the average borrower. To the extent that principal reductions were pursued for short-run

41:1597:131272:16:17:89:522:561:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:would have been an ine-cient way to raise consumption. Figure 7 shows that all of the
41:1598:131357:17:16:89:522:544:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:consumption increase is coming from the region near the collateral constraint. This means

41:1603:131807:16:16:89:522:462:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:at increasing demand for those who are underwater unless pursued aggressively enough to

41:1606:131939:30:17:106:522:388:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:In this paper, we explore how borrower liquidity and wealth a-ect default and consump-
41:1607:132025:17:16:89:522:371:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:tion decisions through the lens of mortgage modifications in the Great Recession. Using
41:1608:132112:16:16:89:522:355:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:quasi-experimental research designs, we show principal reduction that leaves current mort-
41:1609:132202:16:17:89:522:339:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:gage payments unchanged–wealth without liquidity–has no detectable e-ect on default or
41:1610:132288:17:16:89:522:322:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:consumption. In sharp contrast, we find that immediate payment reduction with no change
41:1611:132375:16:17:89:522:306:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:in the net present value of payments owed–liquidity without wealth–significantly reduces
41:1612:132463:17:16:89:125:289:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:default.
41:1613:132471:16:17:106:523:273:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:A:Taken together, these results suggest that liquidity is the key driver of borrower con-
41:1614:132558:17:16:89:522:256:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:sumption and default decisions. Changes in housing debt are irrelevant for the consumption
41:1615:132648:16:17:89:522:240:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:decisions of underwater borrowers because they are unable to access this wealth. From a
41:1616:132735:17:16:89:522:223:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:policy perspective, we show that distressed debt modifications can be redesigned with sub-
41:1617:132825:16:16:89:522:207:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:stantial potential gains. Applied to the main government program for distressed borrowers
41:1618:132914:16:17:89:522:191:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:during the Great Recession, our results imply that 240,000 defaults could have been avoided
41:1619:133005:17:77:89:312:174:119:g_d0_f4:119:g_d0_f4:B:at no additional cost to investors or taxpayers.
41:1620:133053:77:15:98:522:97:36:g_d0_f7:80:g_d0_f8:F:54One implication of this result is that a principal reduction policy very early in the crisis before credit
41:1621:133161:15:10:89:522:82:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:supply had tightened and before price declines had pushed borrowers into negative equity might have had a
41:1622:133266:10:0:89:213:72:80:g_d0_f8:80:g_d0_f8:F:positive e-ect on consumption.
