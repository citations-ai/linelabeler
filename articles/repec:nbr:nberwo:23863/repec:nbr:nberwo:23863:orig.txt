2:31:1655:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:We revisit La Porta’s (1996) finding that returns on stocks with the most optimistic analyst long 
2:32:1753:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:term earnings  growth  forecasts  are  substantially  lower  than  those  for  stocks  with  the  most 
2:33:1855:14:14:71:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:pessimistic forecasts.  We document that this finding still holds, and present several further facts 
2:34:1955:14:14:71:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:about  the  joint  dynamics of  fundamentals,  expectations,  and  returns  for  these  portfolios.    We 
2:35:2060:14:14:71:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:explain these facts using a new model of belief formation based on a portable formalization of the 
2:36:2158:14:14:72:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:representativeness heuristic. In this model, analysts forecast future fundamentals from the history 
2:37:2257:14:14:72:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:of earnings growth, but they over-react to news by exaggerating the probability of states that have 
2:38:2356:14:14:71:545:490:12:Times:12:Times:become objectively more likely. Intuitively, fast earnings growth predicts future Googles but not 
2:39:2453:14:14:71:546:476:12:Times:12:Times:as  many  as  analysts  believe.  We  test  predictions that  distinguish  this  mechanism  from  both 
2:40:2555:14:14:71:546:462:12:Times:12:Times:Bayesian  learning  and  adaptive  expectations,  and  find  supportive evidence.  A  calibration  of  the 
2:41:2661:14:42:71:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:model offers a satisfactory account of the key patterns in fundamentals, expectations, and returns.

3:69:3234:0:27:72:150:708:12:Times:12:Times:I. Introduction 
3:70:3249:27:28:108:548:681:12:Times:12:Times: La Porta (1996) shows that expectations of stock market analysts about long-term earnings 
3:71:3338:28:27:72:549:653:12:Times:12:Times:growth  of  the  companies  they  cover  have  strong  predictive  power  for  these companies’ future 
3:72:3441:27:28:72:548:626:12:Times:12:Times:stock  returns.    Companies  whose  earnings  growth analysts  are  most  optimistic  about  earn poor 
3:73:3544:28:27:72:509:598:12:Times:12:Times:returns relative to companies whose earnings growth analysts are most pessimistic about.   
3:74:3633:27:28:108:548:571:12:Times:12:Times:Figure  1 offers  an update of  this  phenomenon. Stocks  are  sorted  by  analyst  long-term 
3:75:3725:28:28:72:548:543:12:Times:12:Times:earnings per share growth forecasts (LTG).  The LLTG portfolio is the 10% of stocks with most 
3:76:3819:28:27:72:548:515:12:Times:12:Times:pessimistic forecasts, the HLTG portfolio is the 10% of stocks with most optimistic forecasts. The 
3:77:3918:27:28:72:483:488:12:Times:12:Times:figure reports geometric averages of one-year returns on equally weighted portfolios.

3:98:4003:11:12:72:547:216:10:Times:10:Times:Figure 1. Annual Returns for Portfolios Formed on LTG. In December of each year between 1981 and 2015, we form 
3:99:4113:12:11:72:548:204:10:Times:10:Times:decile  portfolios  based  on  ranked  analysts'  expected  growth  in  earnings  per  share  and  report  the  geometric  average 
3:100:4244:11:13:72:508:193:10:Times:10:Times:one-year return over the subsequent calendar year for equally-weighted portfolios with monthly rebalancing. 
3:101:4351:13:13:72:75:180:11:Times:11:Times: 
3:102:4351:13:28:108:549:167:12:Times:12:Times:Consistent with La Porta (1996), the LLTG portfolio earns an average return of 15% in the 
3:103:4441:28:29:72:548:139:12:Times:12:Times:year  after  formation,  while  the HLTG  portfolio  earns  only  3%.2 Adjusting  for  systematic  risk 
3:104:4544:29:9:216:218:110:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:                                                           
3:105:4602:9:16:72:547:101:6:g_d0_f2:10:Times:2 The  spread  in  Figure  1  is  in  line  with,  although  smaller  than,  previous  findings. LaPorta  (1996)  finds  an  average 
3:106:4734:16:11:72:548:85:10:Times:10:Times:yearly spread of 20% but employed a shorter sample (1982 to 1991). Dechow and Sloan (1997) use a similar sample 
3:107:4846:11:0:72:517:74:10:Times:12:g_d0_f2:to La Porta (1996) and find a 15% spread.  Appendix A shows that the spread also holds in sample subperiods. 
4:108:4954:0:28:72:548:709:12:Times:12:Times:deepens  the  puzzle:  the  HLTG  portfolio  has  higher  market  beta  than  the  LLTG  portfolio,  and 
4:109:5059:28:28:72:548:681:12:Times:12:Times:performs  much  worse  in  market  downturns.3 Over  the  past  35  years,  betting  against  extreme 
4:110:5160:28:27:72:548:653:12:Times:12:Times:analyst  optimism  has  been  on  average  a  good idea.  La  Porta  (1996)  interprets this  finding  as 
4:111:5266:27:28:72:548:626:12:Times:12:Times:evidence that analysts, as well as investors who follow them or think like them, are too optimistic 
4:112:5363:28:27:72:548:598:12:Times:12:Times:about stocks  with  rapidly  growing  earnings,  and too  pessimistic about stocks  with deteriorating 
4:113:5463:27:28:72:118:571:12:Times:12:Times:earnings. 
4:114:5472:28:28:108:549:543:12:Times:12:Times:In this   paper we analyze the   dynamics   of   expectation   formation   and   offer   a 
4:115:5562:28:27:72:549:515:12:Times:12:Times:psychologically   founded   theory that jointly accounts   for   the behavior of fundamentals, 
4:116:5655:27:28:72:548:488:12:Times:12:Times:expectations, and returns.  We propose a new learning model in which beliefs are forward looking 
4:117:5749:28:27:72:548:460:12:Times:12:Times:just   as   with   rational   expectations,   but   distorted by   representativeness,   which   biases   the 
4:118:5859:27:28:72:549:433:12:Times:12:Times:interpretation of the news. Specifically, analysts update excessively in the direction of states of the 
4:119:5963:28:28:72:545:405:12:Times:12:Times:world  whose  objective  likelihood  rises  the  most  in  light  of the  news.   The  model delivers over-
4:120:6069:28:27:72:548:377:12:Times:12:Times:reaction to news and extrapolation.   It also makes sharp predictions that distinguish it from both 
4:121:6167:27:28:72:548:350:12:Times:12:Times:Bayesian learning and mechanical adaptive expectations.   We test, and confirm, several of these 
4:122:6263:28:27:72:154:322:12:Times:12:Times:new predictions. 
4:123:6279:27:28:108:548:295:12:Times:12:Times:After describing  the data  in  Section  II,  in Section  III we document  three  facts.   First, 
4:124:6375:28:28:72:549:267:12:Times:12:Times:HLTG  stocks  exhibit  fast  past  earnings  growth, which slows  down going  forward.  Second, 
4:125:6470:28:27:72:548:239:12:Times:12:Times:forecasts   of   future   earnings   growth   of   HLTG   stocks   are excessively optimistic,   and are 
4:126:6574:27:28:72:548:212:12:Times:12:Times:systematically  revised  downward later. Third, HLTG  stocks exhibit  good  past  returns  but  their 
4:127:6673:28:28:72:548:184:12:Times:12:Times:average returns going forward are low.  The opposite dynamics obtain for LLTG stocks, but in a 
4:128:6767:28:58:72:445:156:12:Times:12:Times:much less extreme form, an asymmetry we do not account for in our model.   
4:129:6840:58:9:216:218:98:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:                                                           
4:130:6898:9:15:72:548:89:6:g_d0_f2:10:Times:3 We find 훽퐻퐿푇퐺=1.51, and 훽퐿퐿푇퐺=0.78 (Appendix A). The HLTG-LLTG spread holds within size buckets and it 
4:131:7000:15:0:72:235:74:10:Times:10:g_d0_f2:is strongest for intermediate B/M levels. 
5:132:7042:0:28:108:548:709:12:Times:12:g_d0_f5:Our  model  of  learning in Section  IV is  based on Gennaioli  and  Shleifer’s  (GS,  2010) 
5:133:7133:28:28:72:549:681:12:Times:12:Times:formalization of Kahneman and Tversky’s (1972) representativeness heuristic. As in GS  (2010) 
5:134:7225:28:28:72:549:653:12:Times:12:Times:and Bordalo, Coffman, Gennaioli and Shleifer (BCGS, 2016), a trait 푡 is representative of a group 
5:135:7321:28:28:72:548:625:12:g_d0_f6:12:Times:퐺 when it occurs more frequently in that group than in a reference group −퐺.  The representative 
5:136:7416:28:28:72:548:597:12:Times:12:Times:trait 푡 is quickly  recalled and  its  frequency  in group 퐺 is  exaggerated.  To illustrate,  consider  a 
5:137:7521:28:28:72:548:569:12:Times:12:Times:doctor assessing the  health status of a patient  after  a  positive test. The  representative  patient  is 
5:138:7628:28:28:72:548:541:12:g_d0_f6:12:Times:푡 = “sick”, because sick people are more frequent among patients who tested positive than in the 
5:139:7721:28:27:72:549:513:12:Times:12:Times:overall  population.  The sick patient type  quickly  comes  to  mind and  the  doctor  inflates  its 
5:140:7823:27:28:72:375:486:12:Times:12:Times:probability, which in reality may be low if the disease is rare.   
5:141:7889:28:28:108:548:458:12:Times:12:g_d0_f5:In the present setting, analysts learn about firms’ unobserved fundamentals on the basis of 
5:142:7979:28:27:72:548:430:12:Times:12:Times:a  noisy  signal  (e.g.,  current  earnings). The rational  benchmark  is  the Kalman  Filter. Relative  to 
5:143:8086:27:28:72:548:403:12:Times:12:Times:this  benchmark,  representativeness causes analysts  to  inflate  the  probability  of  firm  types  whose 
5:144:8194:28:27:72:549:375:12:Times:12:Times:likelihood  has  increased  the  most  in  light  of  recent  earning news. After  exceptionally  high 
5:145:8296:27:28:72:548:348:12:Times:12:g_d0_f5:earnings growth, the representative firm is a “Google”, and analysts inflate its probability.  There 
5:146:8397:28:28:72:548:320:12:Times:12:Times:is  a  kernel  of  truth:  Googles  are truly more  likely  among  firms  exhibiting exceptional  growth. 
5:147:8502:28:27:72:548:292:12:Times:12:Times:Beliefs,  however, go  too  far:  Googles  are  quite  rare  in  absolute  terms. Following  our  work  on 
5:148:8609:27:28:72:548:265:12:Times:12:Times:credit  cycles  (BGS  2017),  we say  that this distorted inference follows  a “Diagnostic  Kalman 
5:149:8705:28:27:72:483:237:12:g_d0_f5:12:Times:Filter” to emphasize that it overweighs information diagnostic of certain firm types.   
5:150:8791:27:28:108:548:210:12:Times:12:Times:Section  V maps  the  model  to  the  data.  It  starts  by considering a key implication  of the 
5:151:8887:28:28:72:548:182:12:Times:12:Times:kernel of truth hypothesis: expectations exaggerate the incidence of Googles in the HLTG  group 
5:152:8983:28:27:72:548:154:12:Times:12:Times:because these firms are relatively more likely there. The data confirms that the HLTG group has a 
5:153:9079:27:28:72:548:127:12:Times:12:Times:fatter right tail of strong future performers than all other firms. These exceptional performers are 
5:154:9179:28:0:72:548:99:12:Times:12:Times:thus  representative  of  the  HLTG  group,  even  though  they  are  unlikely  in  absolute  terms. As  the 
6:155:9289:0:28:72:548:709:12:Times:12:Times:model  predicts, we also show  that  analysts  vastly  exaggerate  the  share  of  firms  with  exceptional 
6:156:9396:28:28:72:548:681:12:Times:12:Times:earnings growth in the HLTG group. We then show that the model qualitatively accounts for the 
6:157:9489:28:27:72:548:653:12:Times:12:Times:joint dynamics of fundamentals, expectations, and returns documented in Section III.  Intuitively, 
6:158:9586:27:28:72:548:626:12:Times:12:Times:because  strong  eps  growth  is  diagnostic  of future  strong  growth,  analysts  become  excessively 
6:159:9690:28:27:72:548:598:12:Times:12:Times:optimistic  about  HLTG  firms,  driving up prices  and  generating  negative  forecast  errors. Returns 
6:160:9795:27:28:72:391:571:12:Times:12:Times:are low post formation as analysts correct their inflated forecasts.  
6:161:9861:28:28:108:548:543:12:Times:12:Times:Section  VI performs  three additional  exercises.  Section  VI.A shows  that the  inflated 
6:162:9950:28:27:72:548:515:12:Times:12:Times:expectations about HLTG stocks are due to over-reaction to good news. In particular, we find that 
6:163:10048:27:28:72:548:488:12:Times:12:Times:upward   revisions   in   LTG   forecasts are associated   with   excessive   optimism (Coibion   and 
6:164:10148:28:27:72:548:460:12:Times:12:Times:Gorodnichenko 2015). Section VI.B calibrates model parameters using data on the autocorrelation 
6:165:10242:27:28:72:549:433:12:Times:12:Times:of earnings and the over-reaction estimates of Section VI.A. Our simple model does a good job at 
6:166:10339:28:28:72:548:405:12:Times:12:Times:quantitatively accounting for the link between forecast errors and abnormal returns documented in 
6:167:10437:28:27:72:548:377:12:Times:12:Times:Section  III. Section  VI.C shows  that the  dynamics  of  expectations are  hard  to explain using 
6:168:10534:27:28:72:548:350:12:Times:12:Times:mechanical  extrapolation: expectations mean  revert even without news,  suggesting that  analysts 
6:169:10633:28:27:72:491:322:12:Times:12:Times:are forward looking in incorporating fundamental mean reversion into their forecasts.   
6:170:10717:27:28:108:545:295:12:Times:12:Times:Our paper is related to several strands of research in finance.  Empirical research on cross-
6:171:10810:28:28:72:549:267:12:Times:12:Times:sectional  stock  return  predictability  is framed  in  terms  of  concepts  such  as  extrapolation  (e.g., 
6:172:10919:28:27:72:549:239:12:Times:12:Times:DeBondt  and  Thaler  1985,  1987, Cutler,  Poterba  and  Summers  1991,  Lakonishok,  Shleifer,  and 
6:173:11021:27:28:72:551:212:12:Times:12:Times:Vishny 1994, Dechow and Sloan 1997), but most studies in this area do not use expectations data.  
6:174:11119:28:28:72:548:184:12:Times:12:Times:Some older  studies  in  finance  that  do  use  expectations  data  include  Dominguez  (1986)  and 
6:175:11220:28:27:72:548:156:12:Times:12:Times:Frankel and Froot (1987, 1988).  A large literature on analyst expectations shows that they are on 
6:176:11318:27:28:72:548:129:12:Times:12:Times:average  too  optimistic (Easterwood  and  Nutt  1999,  Michaely  and  Womack  1999,  Dechow, 
6:177:11412:28:0:72:548:101:12:Times:12:Times:Hutton, and Sloan 2000).  More recently, the use of survey expectations data not just by analysts 
7:178:11511:0:28:72:548:709:12:Times:12:Times:but  also  by  investors has  been  making  a  comeback  (e.g.,  Ben  David,  Graham  and  Harvey  2013, 
7:179:11616:28:28:72:393:681:12:Times:12:Times:Greenwood and Shleifer 2014, Gennaioli, Ma, and Shleifer 2015). 
7:180:11678:28:27:108:548:653:12:Times:12:Times:Bouchaud,  Landier,  Krueger  and  Thesmar  (2016)  use  analyst  expectations  data  to study 
7:181:11773:27:28:72:548:626:12:Times:12:Times:the profitability anomaly, and offer a model in which expectations under-react to news, in contrast 
7:182:11871:28:27:72:545:598:12:Times:12:Times:with our focus on over-reaction. As we show in Section VI.A, in our data there is also some short-
7:183:11968:27:28:72:548:571:12:Times:12:Times:term under-reaction,  but  at  the  long  horizons  of  LTG forecasts  over-reaction prevails. Daniel, 
7:184:12068:28:28:72:549:543:12:Times:12:Times:Klos,  and  Rottke  (2017) show that  stocks  featuring  high  dispersion  in  analyst  expectations  and 
7:185:12174:28:27:72:530:515:12:Times:12:Times:high illiquidity earn high returns, but do not offer a theory of expectations and their dispersion. 
7:186:12271:27:28:108:549:488:12:Times:12:Times:Our  paper  is  also  related  to research on over-reaction and volatility, which  begins  with 
7:187:12365:28:27:72:548:460:12:Times:12:Times:Shiller  (1981),  DeBondt  and  Thaler  (1985,  1987),  Cutler,  Poterba,  and  Summers (1990), and 
7:188:12465:27:28:72:548:433:12:Times:12:Times:DeLong  et  al.  (1990a).  This work assumes mechanical,  backward  looking  rules  for belief 
7:189:12560:28:28:72:548:405:12:Times:12:Times:updating, based either on adaptive  expectations (e.g., DeLong  et  al  1990b,  Barsky  and  DeLong 
7:190:12658:28:27:72:548:377:12:Times:12:Times:1993,  Barberis  and  Shleifer  2003, Barberis  et  al.  2015,  Glaeser  and  Nathanson  2015),  adaptive 
7:191:12764:27:28:72:548:350:12:Times:12:Times:learning (Marcet and Sargent 1989, Adam, Marcet, and Nicolini 2016, Adam, Marcet, and Beutel 
7:192:12856:28:27:72:548:322:12:Times:12:Times:2017),  or  rules  of  thumb  (Hong  and  Stein,  1999).4  Pastor  and Veronesi  (2003,  2005) present 
7:193:12954:27:28:72:549:295:12:Times:12:Times:rational  learning  models  in  which  uncertainty  about  the  fundamentals  of some firms  boosts  the 
7:194:13058:28:28:72:549:267:12:Times:12:Times:volatility  of their returns and  their  market  to  book  ratios.   Under  some  conditions,  learning 
7:195:13161:28:27:72:548:239:12:Times:12:Times:dynamics also  explain  predictability  in  aggregate  stock  returns  (Pastor  and  Veronesi  2006).  This 
7:196:13268:27:28:72:548:212:12:Times:12:Times:approach  does  not analyze expectations  data  or  cross  sectional  differences  in  returns.   Barberis, 
7:197:13376:28:28:72:548:184:12:Times:12:Times:Shleifer,  and Vishny (BSV, 1998), Daniel, Hirshleifer, and  Subramanyam (DHS, 1998) and 
7:198:13461:28:27:72:548:156:12:Times:12:Times:Odean   (1998) offer   models grounded in psychology. The   BSV   model   is   motivated   by 
7:199:13554:27:18:72:549:129:12:Times:12:Times:representativeness, and  we  return  to  it  in  Section  VI.C. DHS (1998) and  Odean  (1998) build  a 
7:200:13657:18:9:216:218:111:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:                                                           
7:201:13715:9:17:72:548:102:8:Times:10:Times:4 In Adam,  Marcet,  and  Beutel  (2017), agents  learn  about  the  mapping  between  fundamentals  and  price  outcomes, 
7:202:13837:17:11:72:548:85:10:Times:10:Times:but hold rational expectations of fundamentals. While this approach is complementary to ours, it does not address the 
7:203:13955:11:0:72:352:74:10:Times:12:Times:evidence on expectations of fundamentals that is central to our paper. 
8:204:14026:0:28:72:548:709:12:Times:12:Times:model of investor overconfidence, the tendency of decision-makers to exaggerate the precision of 
8:205:14123:28:28:72:548:681:12:Times:12:Times:private information, which causes divergence in beliefs and excess trading.  In contrast, our model 
8:206:14220:28:27:72:333:653:12:Times:12:Times:is concerned with overreaction to public information.  
8:207:14274:27:28:108:548:626:12:Times:12:Times:One  advantage  of  our  approach  worth  stressing  is  that our model  is  not  designed  for  a 
8:208:14373:28:27:72:548:598:12:Times:12:Times:specific finance setting but is more portable (Rabin 2013). Our formalization of representativeness 
8:209:14471:27:28:72:548:571:12:Times:12:Times:was developed to account for biases in general probability assessments such as base rate neglect, 
8:210:14568:28:28:72:549:543:12:Times:12:Times:conjunction  and disjunction  fallacies in  a  laboratory  context (Gennaioli  and  Shleifer  2010).   We 
8:211:14673:28:27:72:549:515:12:Times:12:Times:have  previously  applied  it  to  modeling  social  stereotypes  (Bordalo,  Coffman,  Gennaioli  and 
8:212:14775:27:28:72:548:488:12:Times:12:Times:Shleifer 2016, 2017) and credit cycles (Bordalo, Gennaioli and Shleifer 2017), where the patterns 
8:213:14871:28:27:72:548:460:12:Times:12:Times:of  over-reaction  to  news,  systematic  forecast  errors,  expectations  revisions,  and  predictable 
8:214:14975:27:28:72:284:433:12:Times:12:Times:returns are similar to those discussed here.

8:217:15051:28:27:72:129:349:12:Times:12:Times:II.A.  Data 
8:218:15062:27:27:108:548:322:12:Times:12:g_d0_f5: We gather data on analysts’ expectations from IBES, stock prices and returns from CRSP, 
8:219:15150:27:28:72:548:295:12:Times:12:Times:and accounting information from CRSP/COMPUSTAT. Below we describe the measures used in 
8:220:15237:28:28:72:460:267:12:Times:12:Times:the paper and, in parentheses, provide their mnemonics in the primary datasets.   
8:221:15318:28:27:108:548:239:12:Times:12:g_d0_f5: From the IBES Unadjusted US Summary Statistics file we obtain mean analysts’ forecasts 
8:222:15405:27:28:72:548:212:12:Times:12:Times:for earnings  per  share and their expected  long-run  growth  rate (meanest, henceforth “LTG”) for 
8:223:15502:28:28:72:548:184:12:Times:12:Times:the period December 1981, when LTG becomes available, through December 2016. IBES defines 
8:224:15591:28:27:72:549:156:12:Times:12:g_d0_f5:LTG as the “expected annual increase in operating earnings over the company’s next full business 
8:225:15688:27:28:72:548:129:12:Times:12:Times:cycle”, a period ranging from three to five years.  From the IBES Detail History Tape file we get 
8:226:15785:28:0:72:549:101:12:Times:12:Times:analyst-level  data  on  earnings  forecasts. We  use  CRSP  daily  data  on  stock  splits  (cfacshr)  to 
9:227:15893:0:28:72:548:709:12:Times:12:Times:adjust  IBES  earnings  per  share  figures. On  December  of  each  year  between  1981  and  2015, we 
9:228:15997:28:28:72:460:681:12:Times:12:Times:form LTG decile portfolios based on stocks that report earnings in US dollars.5   
9:229:16076:28:27:108:548:653:12:Times:12:Times:  The  CRSP  sample  includes  all domestic common  stocks  listed  on  a  major  US  stock 
9:230:16165:27:28:72:548:626:12:Times:12:Times:exchange  (i.e.  NYSE,  AMEX,  and  NASDAQ)  except  for  closed-end  funds  and  REITs.  Our 
9:231:16259:28:27:72:548:598:12:Times:12:Times:sample starts in 1978 and ends in 2016. We present results for both buy-and-hold annual returns 
9:232:16355:27:28:72:548:571:12:Times:12:Times:and daily  cumulative-abnormal  returns  for  various  earnings’  announcement  windows.   We 
9:233:16448:28:28:72:548:543:12:Times:12:Times:compute annual stock  returns  by  compounding  monthly  returns. We focus  on  equally-weighted 
9:234:16544:28:27:72:549:515:12:Times:12:Times:returns  for LTG portfolios. If  a  stock  is  delisted,  CRSP tries to  establish its  price  after  delisting. 
9:235:16656:27:28:72:548:488:12:Times:12:Times:Whenever a post-delisting price  exists, we use it in the computations for returns. When CRSP is 
9:236:16753:28:27:72:548:460:12:Times:12:Times:unable  to  determine  the  value  of  a  stock  after  delisting,  we  assume  that  the  investor  was  able  to 
9:237:16868:27:28:72:548:433:12:Times:12:Times:trade at the last quoted price. After a stock disappears from the sample, we replace its return until 
9:238:16968:28:28:72:548:405:12:Times:12:Times:the end of the calendar  year with the return of the equally-weighted market portfolio. Given that 
9:239:17067:28:27:72:548:377:12:Times:12:Times:IBES  surveys  analysts  around  the  middle  of  the  month  (on  Thursday  of  the  third  week  of  the 
9:240:17174:27:28:72:549:350:12:Times:12:Times:month), LTG is  in  the  information  set  when  we  form  portfolios.  Daily  cumulative  abnormal 
9:241:17273:28:27:72:549:322:12:g_d0_f5:12:Times:returns are defined relative to CRSP’s equally-weighted  index.   We  also  gather  data  on  market 
9:242:17374:27:28:72:549:295:12:Times:12:Times:capitalization  in  December  of  year t as  well  as  the  pre-formation  3-year  return  ending  on 
9:243:17475:28:28:72:548:267:12:Times:12:Times:December  of  year t.    Finally,  we  rank  stocks  into  deciles  based  on  market  capitalization  using 
9:244:17584:28:27:72:218:239:12:Times:12:Times:breakpoints for NYSE stocks. 
9:245:17612:27:28:108:548:212:12:Times:12:Times:  We get from the CRSP/COMPUSTAT merged file on assets (at), sales (sale), net income 
9:246:17696:28:28:72:548:184:12:Times:12:Times:(ni), book equity, common shares used to calculate earnings per share (cshpri), adjustment factor 
9:247:17793:28:27:72:548:156:12:Times:12:Times:for stock splits (adjex_f), and Wall Street Journal dates for quarterly earnings' releases (rdq).  Our 
9:248:17895:27:20:72:548:129:12:Times:12:Times:CRSP/COMPUSTAT data covers the period 1978-2016. We use annual and quarterly accounting 
9:249:17983:20:9:216:218:109:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:                                                           
9:250:18041:9:15:72:547:100:6:Times:10:Times:5 We form portfolios in December of each year, because that is when IBES data on analyst expectations is released. 
9:251:18155:15:11:72:547:85:10:Times:10:Times:Unlike  in  Fama  and  French  (1993)  we  know  exactly  when  the  information  required  for  an  investable  strategy is 
9:252:18279:11:0:72:101:74:10:Times:10:Times:public. 
10:253:18287:0:28:72:548:709:12:Times:12:Times:data. We define book equity as stockholders’ equity (depending on data availability seq, ceq+pfd, 
10:254:18384:28:28:72:548:681:12:Times:12:Times:or at-lt)  plus deferred  taxes  (depending  on  data  availability txditc or txdb+itcb)  minus  preferred 
10:255:18489:28:27:72:548:653:12:Times:12:Times:equity  (depending  on  data  availability pstkr, pstkl,  or pstk).  We define  operating  margin  as  the 
10:256:18596:27:28:72:548:626:12:Times:12:Times:difference between sales and cost of goods sold (cogs) and return on equity as net income divided

10:258:18790:27:28:72:549:571:12:Times:12:Times:years.  When  merging  IBES  with CRSP/COMPUSTAT,  we  follow  the  literature  and  assume  that

10:262:19005:27:27:108:548:460:12:Times:12:Times:Table 1 reports the means of some of the variables for LTG decile portfolios.  The number 
10:263:19094:27:28:72:549:433:12:Times:12:Times:of  stocks with CRSP  data  on  stock  returns  and IBES data  on LTG varies  by  year,  ranging  from 
10:264:19196:28:28:72:549:405:12:Times:12:Times:1,310 in  1981  to  3,849 in  1997.  On  average,  each LTG portfolio contains 241 stocks.  The 
10:265:19287:28:27:72:548:377:12:Times:12:Times:forecasted growth rate in earnings per share ranges from 4% for the lowest LTG decile (LLTG) to 
10:266:19381:27:28:72:548:350:12:Times:12:Times:38% for the highest decile (HLTG), an enormous difference.  LLTG stocks are larger than HLTG 
10:267:19473:28:27:72:548:322:12:Times:12:Times:stocks  in  terms  of  both  total  assets  (7,942  MM  vs.  1,081  MM)  and  market  capitalization (3,913 
10:268:19579:27:28:72:548:295:12:Times:12:Times:MM vs. 1,749 MM).  However, differences in size are not extreme: the average size decile is 5.1 
10:269:19674:28:28:72:221:267:12:Times:12:Times:for LLTG and 3.6 for HLTG.   
10:270:19702:28:27:108:549:239:12:Times:12:Times:LLTG  stocks  have  lower  operating  margins to  asset  ratios than  HLTG  stocks  but  higher 
10:271:19798:27:28:72:548:212:12:Times:12:Times:return on equity (5% vs -6%).   In fact, 31% of HLTG firms have negative eps while the same is 
10:272:19890:28:28:72:548:184:12:Times:12:Times:true for only 12% of LLTG stocks.  The high incidence of negative eps companies in the HLTG 
10:273:19982:28:27:72:548:156:12:Times:12:Times:portfolio underscores the importance of the definition of LTG in terms of annual earnings growth 
10:274:20078:27:21:72:536:129:12:Times:12:Times:over a full business cycle. Current negative earnings do not hinder these firms’ future prospects.

11:280:20237:13:12:72:548:684:11:Times:11:Times:We form decile portfolios based on analysts' expected growth in earnings per share (LTG) in December of 
11:281:20341:12:13:72:548:672:11:Times:11:Times:each year between 1981 and 2015. The table reports time-series means of the variables described below for 
11:282:20447:13:13:72:548:659:11:Times:11:Times:equally-weighted LTG portfolios. Unless otherwise noted, accounting variables pertain to the most recently 
11:283:20552:13:12:72:548:646:11:Times:11:Times:available fiscal year, where we follow the standard assumption that data for fiscal periods ending after June 
11:284:20662:12:13:72:548:634:11:Times:11:Times:become available during the next calendar year. Assets is book value of total assets (in millions).  Market 
11:285:20766:13:13:72:548:621:11:Times:11:Times:capitalization is the value of common stock on the last trading day of year t (in millions).  Size decile refers 
11:286:20877:13:12:72:548:608:11:Times:11:Times:to deciles of market capitalization with breakpoints computed using only NYSE stocks.  Operating margin 
11:287:20980:12:13:72:548:596:11:Times:11:Times:to assets is the difference between sales and cost of goods sold divided by assets.   Return on equity is net 
11:288:21088:13:13:72:548:583:11:Times:11:Times:income divided  by book  equity. Percent eps  positive is  the  fraction  of  firms  with  positive  earnings.

11:305:21739:35:36:72:221:354:12:Times:12:Times:III. A New Look at the Data. 
11:306:21766:36:27:108:548:318:12:Times:12:Times:Figure 1 suggests that analysts and the stock market may be too bullish on firms they are 
11:307:21853:27:28:72:548:291:12:Times:12:Times:optimistic about, and too bearish on firms they are pessimistic about. To assess this possibility, we 
11:308:21955:28:28:72:481:263:12:Times:12:Times:document some basic facts connecting firms’ performance, expectations and returns. 
11:309:22036:28:28:108:548:235:12:Times:12:Times:Figure 2 reports average earnings per share of HLTG and LLTG portfolios in years 푡−3 
11:310:22119:28:28:72:548:207:12:Times:12:Times:to 푡+3 where 푡=0 corresponds  to portfolio  formation.   We  normalize  year 푡−3 earnings per 
11:311:22210:28:27:72:548:179:12:Times:12:Times:share of  both  portfolios  to $1. Earnings  per  share  for  HLTG  stocks  exhibit  explosive  growth 
11:312:22312:27:28:72:548:152:12:Times:12:Times:during the pre-formation period, rising from $1 in year -3 to $1.56 in year 0.  Earnings of LLTG 
11:313:22408:28:28:72:548:124:12:Times:12:Times:firms  decline to  $0.87 during the  corresponding period. But  the  past  does  not  repeat  itself  after 
11:314:22513:28:0:72:548:96:12:Times:12:Times:portfolio  formation,  because  of mean  reversion in earnings growth.  Earnings  growth  of  HLTG 
12:315:22613:0:28:72:548:709:12:Times:12:Times:firms slows down, while earnings of LLTG firms recover during the post-formation period. HLTG 
12:316:22706:28:28:72:548:681:12:Times:12:Times:firms  remain  more  profitable  on  average  than  LLTG  firms 3 years  after  portfolio  formation,  but 
12:317:22812:28:21:72:540:653:12:Times:12:Times:the difference in actual growth rates is nowhere near the difference in LTG exhibited in Table 1.

12:344:23443:27:28:72:548:279:12:Times:12:Times:window.  Prior  to portfolio formation,  expectations  of long-term  growth  for  HLTG  firms rise 
12:345:23540:28:28:72:548:251:12:Times:12:Times:dramatically  in  response  to  strong  earnings  growth  (compare  with  Figure 2),  while  expectations 
12:346:23646:28:27:72:548:223:12:Times:12:Times:for  LLTG  drop.    After  formation,  expectations  for  HLTG  firms are revised  sharply  downwards, 
12:347:23748:27:28:72:548:196:12:Times:12:Times:particularly  during  the  first  year, whereas  LTG  of  LLTG  firms  is  revised  moderately  up. Three 
12:348:23852:28:27:72:548:168:12:Times:12:Times:years  after  portfolio  formation,  earnings  of  HLTG  firms  are  still  expected  to  grow  faster  than 
12:349:23961:27:28:72:549:141:12:Times:12:Times:those  of  LLTG  firms,  but  the  spread  in  expected  growth  rates  of  earnings  has  narrowed 
12:350:24061:28:28:72:549:113:12:Times:12:Times:considerably.  One potential concern about Figure 2 and in other Figures in this Section is the role 
12:351:24160:28:0:72:548:85:12:Times:12:Times:of attrition in the sample.  Reassuringly, the level of attrition is similar across HLTG  and  LLTG 
13:352:24262:0:28:72:548:709:12:Times:12:Times:portfolios (roughly 30% three years post formation), and the key features of the Figures continue 
13:353:24359:28:36:72:491:681:12:Times:12:Times:to hold when we restrict the sample to firms that survive for five years post formation.

13:379:24995:27:28:72:548:310:12:Times:12:Times:and  LLTG  portfolios displayed  in  Figure 2.   Analysts  seem  to  be learning about firms’ earnings 
13:380:25096:28:28:72:548:282:12:Times:12:Times:growth  from  their  past  performance. Fast  pre-formation  growth leads analysts  to  place  a  firm  in 
13:381:25202:28:35:72:547:254:12:Times:12:Times:the HLTG category.  Post-formation growth slowdown triggers a downward revision of forecasts.  
13:382:25296:35:28:108:548:219:12:Times:12:Times:Mean  reversion  in  forecasts  may  be  caused  by mean  reversion  in  fundamentals,  which is 
13:383:25392:28:27:72:549:191:12:Times:12:Times:evident in Figure 2, or by the correction of analysts’ expectations errors at formation. To see the 
13:384:25487:27:28:72:548:164:12:Times:12:Times:role of expectations errors, Figure 4 reports the difference between realized earnings  growth and

14:404:26373:28:27:108:548:313:12:Times:12:Times:The overestimation of earnings growth for HLTG firms is economically large. By  year 3, 
14:405:26460:27:28:72:549:286:12:Times:12:Times:actual earnings are a small fraction of what analysts forecast: earnings per share  grow  from 0.16 
14:406:26560:28:28:72:535:258:12:Times:12:Times:upon formation to 0.21 in 푡+3, compared to the prediction of 0.70 based on LTG at formation. 
14:407:26651:28:28:108:548:230:12:Times:12:Times: There are two concerns with this evidence, both of which deal with the interpretation and 
14:408:26740:28:27:72:548:202:12:Times:12:Times:reliability of our expectations data.  The first is whether Figure 4 reflects genuine errors in analyst 
14:409:26844:27:28:72:548:175:12:Times:12:Times:beliefs or alternatively their  distorted  incentives.  For  instance,  analysts  may  blindly  follow  the 
14:410:26950:28:27:72:548:147:12:Times:12:Times:market,  reporting  high  LTG  for  firms that investors  are  excited  about. This possibility  does  not 
14:411:27057:27:28:72:548:120:12:Times:12:Times:undermine  our  analysis.  To  the  extent that analysts’ forecasts reflect investor beliefs, they  are 
14:412:27159:28:0:72:548:92:12:Times:12:Times:informative about the expectations shaping market prices.  The second, and more radical, concern 
15:413:27257:0:28:72:548:709:12:g_d0_f5:12:Times:is whether investors share analysts’ beliefs or alternatively  the  latter are  noise.    To  address  this 
15:414:27364:28:28:72:548:681:12:Times:12:Times:concern  we look  at  the  dynamics  of  stock returns  pre  and  post  formation.  Figure 5 shows  stock 
15:415:27468:28:27:72:548:653:12:Times:12:Times:returns  around  earnings  announcements. For  every  stock  in  the HLTG  and  LLTG portfolios,  we 
15:416:27568:27:28:72:548:626:12:Times:12:Times:compute  the  12-day  cumulative  return  during  the four  quarterly earnings  announcement  days, in 
15:417:27668:28:22:72:431:598:12:Times:12:Times:years 푡−3 to 푡+4, following the methodology of La Porta et al. (1997).

15:422:27938:13:13:72:548:303:11:Times:11:Times:per  share.  Next,  for  each  stock,  we  compute  the  3-day  market-adjusted  return  centered  on  earnings 
15:423:28050:13:12:72:548:290:11:Times:11:Times:announcements  in  years 푡−3,...,푡+3.  Next,  we  compute  the  annual  return  that  accrues  over  earnings 
15:424:28160:12:13:72:548:278:11:Times:11:Times:announcements  by  compounding  all  3-day  stock  returns  in  each  year.  We  report  the  equally-weighted 
15:425:28271:13:13:72:548:265:11:Times:11:Times:average  annual  return  during  earnings  announcements  for  the  highest  (HLTG)  and  lowest  (LLTG)  LTG

15:428:28472:15:28:108:549:218:12:Times:12:Times:HLTG stocks positively surprise investors with their earnings announcements in the years 
15:429:28561:28:27:72:548:190:12:Times:12:Times:prior to portfolio formation, when there is upward revision of LTG.6 Returns are low afterwards, 
15:430:28657:27:28:72:545:163:12:Times:12:Times:especially  in  year  1,  consistent  with  the  sharp  decline  in  LTG  in  this  period. Analysts’ over-
15:431:28764:28:15:72:548:135:12:Times:12:Times:optimism thus seems to be shared by investors, so that HLTG stocks consistently disappoint in the 
15:432:28862:15:8:216:218:120:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:                                                           
15:433:28920:8:15:72:548:112:6:Times:10:Times:6 The  persistence  of  positive  surprises  and  high  returns  exhibited  by  the  HLTG  portfolio  in  Figure  5 should  not  be 
15:434:29050:15:12:72:547:97:10:Times:10:Times:confused  with  time-series  momentum.  Instead,  it  arises  from  selection:    on  average,  firms  require  a  sequence  of 
15:435:29178:12:11:72:548:85:10:Times:10:Times:positive  shocks  to  be  classified  as  HLTG. The  basic  HLTG-LLTG  spread  is  orthogonal  to  short-term  return 
15:436:29296:11:0:72:367:74:10:Times:10:Times:momentum in the 6 months prior to portfolio formation, see Appendix A. 
16:437:29368:0:28:72:549:709:12:Times:12:Times:post  formation  period.  The  converse  holds  for  LLTG  stocks, but  in  a  milder  form. In  sum, 
16:438:29468:28:36:72:529:681:12:g_d0_f5:12:Times:analysts’ expectations are not noise: they correlate both with actual earnings and stock returns. 
16:439:29565:36:27:108:548:645:12:Times:12:Times: Overall, three aspects  of the analyst  expectations evidence play  a  key role in  our  theory. 
16:440:29661:27:28:72:548:618:12:Times:12:Times:First, analysts react to news. Optimism about HLTG firms follows the observation of fast earnings 
16:441:29759:28:27:72:548:590:12:g_d0_f5:12:Times:growth, and is reversed after earnings’ growth slows down.  It  seems  that analysts  are  trying  to 
16:442:29861:27:28:72:548:563:12:Times:12:Times:learn  the  earnings  generating  capacity  of  firms on  the  basis of  past performance.   Second, one 
16:443:29964:28:28:72:548:535:12:Times:12:Times:should be skeptical of analyst rationality, as shown by the evidence on systematic forecast errors 
16:444:30062:28:27:72:548:507:12:Times:12:Times:in the HLTG group (which comprises more than 200 firms). Third, the dynamics of returns match 
16:445:30156:27:36:72:433:480:12:Times:12:Times:the dynamics of expectations and their errors, both pre and post formation. 
16:446:30231:36:27:108:548:444:12:Times:12:Times:In the next section, we develop a model based on psychological first principles that sheds 
16:447:30322:27:28:72:548:417:12:Times:12:Times:light  on  this  evidence.  This  model  takes  the  perspective  that  the  consensus  analyst  forecasts  are 
16:448:30434:28:28:72:548:389:12:Times:12:Times:the  relevant  expectations  that  shape  prices  and  whose  dynamics  drive  returns.  A key  goal of  our 
16:449:30542:28:27:72:551:361:12:Times:12:g_d0_f5:approach   is to simultaneously  explain  analysts’  forecast  errors  and  return  predictability.  
16:450:30643:27:28:72:548:334:12:Times:12:Times:Predictable  returns  as  such could arise  with  full  rationality: if  investors  have  different required 
16:451:30752:28:27:72:551:306:12:g_d0_f5:12:Times:returns for different firms and if analysts jointly learn a firm’s required return and its earnings.7  
16:452:30855:27:28:72:549:279:12:Times:12:Times:However,  the  evidence  on  predictable errors in  expectations  of both earnings  and  returns  is 
16:453:30955:28:36:72:417:251:12:Times:12:Times:inconsistent with this possibility.  We return to this point in Section VI.

17:459:31215:0:28:108:548:708:12:Times:12:g_d0_f5:There  is  a  measure  1  of  firms, 푖∈[0,1]. At  time 푡, the  natural  logarithm  of a  firm’s 
17:460:31311:28:37:72:267:680:12:Times:12:Times:earnings per share (eps) 푥푖,푡 is given by:

17:462:31374:37:29:72:549:606:12:Times:12:Times:where 푏∈[0,1] captures  mean-reversion  in  eps,  and 휀푖,푡 denotes  a  transitory  i.i.d.  normally 
17:463:31472:29:29:72:549:577:12:Times:12:g_d0_f5:distributed  shock  to  eps, 휀푖,푡~풩(0,휎휀2).  The  term 푓푖,푡, which we call the firm’s “fundamental”, 
17:464:31573:29:36:72:439:548:12:Times:12:Times:captures the firm’s persistent earnings capacity.  It obeys the law of motion: 
17:465:31649:36:37:262:548:512:12:Times:12:Times:  푓푖,푡=푎∙푓푖,푡−1+휂푖,푡.                                                              (2) 
17:466:31673:37:30:72:549:475:12:Times:12:Times:where 푎∈[0,1] is persistence and 휂푖,푡~풩(0,휎휂2) is an i.i.d. normally distributed shock that may 
17:467:31764:30:28:72:548:445:12:Times:12:Times:for  instance result from  a  corporate  reorganization or  a  change  in market  competition. We  can 
17:468:31865:28:29:72:548:417:12:Times:12:Times:think of firms with exceptionally high 푓푖,푡 as “Googles” that will produce very high earnings in the 
17:469:31964:29:28:72:548:388:12:Times:12:Times:future, and firms  with  low 푓푖,푡 as “lemons” that  will  produce low earnings  in  the  future.  We 
17:470:32061:28:29:72:438:360:12:Times:12:Times:assume stationarity of earnings by imposing the additional condition 푏≤푎. 
17:471:32134:29:29:108:549:331:12:Times:12:Times:  The analyst observes eps 푥푖,푡 but not the fundamental 푓푖,푡. The Kalman filter characterizes 
17:472:32224:29:30:72:548:302:12:Times:12:Times:the forecasted distribution of 푓푖,푡 at any time 푡 conditional on the firm’s past and current earnings

17:474:32414:32:31:72:548:240:12:g_d0_f6:12:Times:푥푖,푡, the firm’s current forecasted fundamental is normally distributed with variance 휎푓2 and mean:8

17:480:32672:9:17:72:548:119:6:Times:10:Times:8 Equation (3) arises in the long run, when the  variance of fundamentals has converged to its steady state 휎푓2. Given 
17:481:32790:17:13:72:547:102:10:Times:10:Times:the  presence of  fundamental  shocks 휂푖,푡,  a  firm’s  fundamental  is  never learned  with  certainty.    In  the  long  run, 
17:482:32916:13:14:72:333:89:10:Times:10:Times:variance stays constant at 휎푓2, which is defined as the solution to: 
17:483:32982:14:0:222:397:75:10:g_d0_f6:10:Times:푎2휎푓4+휎푓2[휎휂2+(1−푎2)휎휀2]−휎휂2휎휀2=0 
18:484:33017:0:30:108:548:707:12:Times:12:Times:The new forecast of fundamentals starts from the history-based value 푎푓̂푖,푡−1 but adjusts it 
18:485:33106:30:29:72:548:677:12:Times:12:Times:in the direction of the current surprise  푥푖,푡−푏푥푖,푡−1−푎푓̂푖,푡−1.  The extent of adjustment increases 
18:486:33205:29:30:72:548:648:12:Times:12:Times:in 퐾.  Absent transitory  shocks (휎휀2=0), earnings are perfectly informative about  fundamentals 
18:487:33301:30:29:72:548:618:12:Times:12:Times:and the adjustment is full (i.e., 푓̂푖,푡=푥푖,푡−푏푥푖,푡−1).  As the importance of transitory shocks rises, 
18:488:33402:29:27:72:548:589:12:Times:12:Times:earnings become a noisier signal and estimated fundamentals change less with earnings, so 퐾<1. 
18:489:33494:27:29:108:548:562:12:Times:12:Times:The  signal  to  noise  ratio solves the  key inference problem here: to separate  the  extent  to 
18:490:33592:29:28:72:548:533:12:Times:12:Times:which current earnings 푥푖,푡 are due to persistent or transitory shocks (i.e., 휂푖,푡 versus 휀푖,푡).  Among 
18:491:33690:28:28:72:548:505:12:Times:12:Times:episodes of  exceptionally  high  growth,  the  analyst  must  try  to  tell  apart  those  due  to  luck  and 
18:492:33800:28:27:72:327:477:12:Times:12:Times:those due to the fact that the firm is the next Google. 
18:493:33854:27:28:108:548:450:12:Times:12:Times:Equation (3) yields not only the true conditional distribution of fundamentals, but also the 
18:494:33947:28:28:72:548:422:12:Times:12:Times:assessment of  fundamentals  performed by  a  Bayesian agent seeking  to forecast  future  earnings. 
18:495:34048:28:27:72:480:394:12:Times:12:Times:We next describe how the representativeness heuristic distorts this learning process.  
18:496:34131:27:36:72:75:367:12:Times:12:Times: 
18:497:34131:36:27:72:374:331:12:Times:12:Times:IV.B. Representativeness and the Diagnostic Kalman filter 
18:498:34187:27:28:107:548:304:12:Times:12:Times:Kahneman  and Tversky  (KT 1972) argue that the automatic use of the representativeness 
18:499:34274:28:28:72:548:276:12:Times:12:Times:heuristic causes individuals to estimate a type as likely in a group when it is merely representative 
18:500:34374:28:27:72:548:248:12:Times:12:g_d0_f5:of that group. KT define representativeness as follows: “an attribute is representative of a class if 
18:501:34476:27:28:72:548:221:12:Times:12:Times:it  is  very  diagnostic;  that  is,  the  relative  frequency  of  this  attribute  is  much  higher  in  that  class 
18:502:34595:28:27:72:548:193:12:Times:12:Times:than  in a relevant reference class (TK 1983).”  Starting with KT (1972),  experimental  evidence 
18:503:34693:27:28:72:362:166:12:Times:12:Times:has found ample support for the role of representativeness.   
18:504:34754:28:28:107:549:138:12:Times:12:Times:Gennaioli  and  Shleifer  (2010) propose a model of  this  phenomenon in  which a  decision 
18:505:34845:28:28:72:548:110:12:Times:12:Times:maker assesses the distribution ℎ(푇=휏|퐺) of a variable 푇 in a group 퐺.  The representativeness 
18:506:34937:28:0:72:217:82:12:Times:12:Times:of the specific type 휏 for 퐺 is:

19:511:34997:44:28:108:549:656:12:Times:12:Times:As  in  KT,  a type is  more  representative  if  it  is relatively more  frequent  in 퐺 than  in the 
19:512:35095:28:28:72:548:628:12:Times:12:Times:comparison  group –퐺. The probability  of  representative  types  is  overestimated  relative  to  the 
19:513:35197:28:27:72:548:600:12:Times:12:Times:truth. BCGS (2016) offer a convenient formalization of this process by assuming that probability 
19:514:35293:27:41:72:313:573:12:Times:12:Times:judgments are formed using the distorted density:

19:522:35471:29:28:72:551:458:12:Times:12:Times:The extent of probability distortions increases in 휃, with 휃=0 capturing the rational benchmark.    
19:523:35565:28:27:108:548:430:12:Times:12:Times:In Kahneman and Tversky’s quote, as well as in Equation (4), the representativeness of a 
19:524:35653:27:28:72:548:403:12:Times:12:Times:type depends  on  its true relative  frequency  in  the  group 퐺. The distorted  probability in  (5) thus 
19:525:35757:28:28:72:549:375:12:Times:12:Times:depends  on  the  true probability,  which  renders  the  model  empirically  testable.    GS  (2010) 
19:526:35859:28:28:72:548:347:12:Times:12:Times:interpret this feature on the basis of limited and selective memory. True information ℎ(푇=휏|퐺) 
19:527:35952:28:28:72:548:319:12:Times:12:Times:and ℎ(푇=휏|−퐺) about  a  group  is  stored  in  a  decision  maker’s  long  term  memory. 
19:528:36040:28:28:72:548:291:12:Times:12:Times:Representative types, being distinctive of the group under consideration, are more readily recalled 
19:529:36140:28:27:72:549:263:12:Times:12:Times:than other types. As a result, representative types play an outsized role in judgments; other types 
19:530:36240:27:28:72:189:236:12:Times:12:Times:are relatively neglected. 
19:531:36265:28:28:107:548:208:12:Times:12:Times:This setup can  be  applied  to prediction and  inference problems  (as  in  BCGS  2016  and 
19:532:36357:28:27:72:548:180:12:Times:12:Times:BGS 2016).  Consider the example from the introduction of a doctor assessing the health status of 
19:533:36455:27:29:72:548:153:12:Times:12:Times:a patient, 푇={ℎ푒푎푙푡ℎ푦,푠푖푐푘} in light of a positive medical test, 퐺=푝표푠푖푡푖푣푒. The positive test 
19:534:36549:29:27:72:549:124:12:Times:12:Times:is   assessed   in   the   context   of untested   patients   (−퐺=푢푛푡푒푠푡푒푑). Applying   the   previous 
19:535:36651:27:0:72:481:97:12:Times:12:Times:definition, being sick is representative of patients who tested positive if and only if:

20:542:36836:44:28:72:549:656:12:Times:12:Times:namely   when Pr(퐺=푝표푠푖푡푖푣푒|푇=푠푖푐푘)>Pr(퐺=푝표푠푖푡푖푣푒|푇=ℎ푒푎푙푡ℎ푦). The   condition 
20:543:36913:28:28:72:548:628:12:Times:12:Times:holds  if the  test  is  even  minimally informative  of health  status. A positive test brings “sick” to 
20:544:37017:28:27:72:549:600:12:Times:12:Times:mind because  the true probability of  this  type has  increased  the  most  after  the positive  test  is 
20:545:37123:27:28:72:548:573:12:Times:12:Times:revealed. Thus, the doctor may deem the sick state likely, even if the disease is rare (Casscells et 
20:546:37223:28:28:72:436:545:12:Times:12:Times:al. 1978), committing a form of base rate neglect described in TK’s (1974). 
20:547:37297:28:29:108:548:517:12:Times:12:Times:We apply this logic to the problem of forecasting a firm’s earnings. The analyst must infer 
20:548:37388:29:28:72:549:488:12:Times:12:Times:the firm’s type 푓푖,푡 after observing the  current  earnings  surprise 푥푖,푡−푏푥푖,푡−1−푎푓̂푖,푡−1. This  is 
20:549:37486:28:29:72:549:460:12:Times:12:Times:akin  to seeing  the medical  test.  As  we  saw  previously,  the true conditional  distribution  of  firm 
20:550:37593:29:30:72:549:431:12:Times:12:Times:fundamentals 푓푖,푡 is normal,  with  variance 휎푓2 and the mean given  by Equation  (3).    This  is  our 
20:551:37693:30:28:72:549:401:12:Times:12:Times:target distribution ℎ(푇=휏|퐺).  As  in  the  medical  example,  the information content of the 
20:552:37784:28:30:72:548:373:12:Times:12:Times:earnings 푥푖,푡 for fundamentals 푓푖,푡 is assessed relative to the background information set in which 
20:553:37881:30:30:72:548:343:12:Times:12:Times:no  news  is received,  namely if the  earnings  surprise  is  zero 푥푖,푡−푏푥푖,푡−1=푎푓̂푖,푡−1.   The 
20:554:37976:30:30:72:538:313:12:Times:12:Times:comparison distribution ℎ(푇=휏|−퐺) is thus also, normal with mean 푎푓̂푖,푡−1 and variance 휎푓2.   
20:555:38063:30:39:108:487:283:12:Times:12:Times:With normality, the representativeness of fundamental 푓 for firm 푖 at date 푡 is:

20:560:38202:48:30:108:548:196:12:Times:12:Times:If news are good, in the sense that they rationally imply better fundamentals, 푓̂푖,푡>푎푓̂푖,푡−1, 
20:561:38294:30:29:72:548:166:12:Times:12:Times:representativeness   is   higher   for   higher types 푓. After bad   news, implying 푓̂푖,푡<푎푓̂푖,푡−1, 
20:562:38391:29:27:72:548:137:12:Times:12:Times:representativeness is higher for lower types 푓.  In the first case, high types are overweighed while 
20:563:38490:27:28:72:457:110:12:Times:12:Times:low types are underweighted in judgments. In the latter case, the reverse is true. 
20:564:38572:28:0:108:491:82:12:Times:12:Times:Appendix A shows that these distortions generate diagnostic beliefs as follows: 
21:565:38651:0:29:72:549:708:12:Times:12:g_d0_f11:Proposition 1 (Diagnostic Kalman filter) In the long run, upon seeing 푥푖,푡−푏푥푖,푡−1, the analyst’s 
21:566:38747:29:32:72:528:679:12:Times:12:Times:posterior about the firm’s fundamentals are normally distributed with variance 휎푓2 and mean:  
21:567:38837:32:37:189:548:647:12:g_d0_f6:12:Times:푓̂푖,푡휃=푎푓̂푖,푡−1+퐾(1+휃)(푥푖,푡−푏푥푖,푡−1−푎푓̂푖,푡−1).                                   (6) 
21:568:38886:37:27:108:548:610:12:Times:12:Times:When analysts overweight representative types, their beliefs resemble the optimal Kalman 
21:569:38974:27:28:72:549:583:12:Times:12:Times:filter, but with a key   difference:   they   exaggerate the   signal   to   noise   ratio, inflating   the 
21:570:39081:28:27:72:551:555:12:Times:12:Times:fundamentals of  firms  receiving  good  news  and  deflating  those of  firms  receiving  bad  news.  
21:571:39181:27:28:72:549:528:12:Times:12:Times:Exaggeration of the signal to noise ratio is reminiscent of overconfidence, but here over-reaction 
21:572:39280:28:28:72:548:500:12:Times:12:Times:occurs  with  respect to  public as  well  as  private news.9  The  psychology  is in  fact very  different 
21:573:39386:28:27:72:548:472:12:Times:12:Times:from  overconfidence:  in  our  model,  as in  the  medical  test  example,  overreaction is  caused  by 
21:574:39491:27:28:72:549:445:12:Times:12:Times:neglect of base rates. After good news, the most representative firms are Googles. This firm type 
21:575:39588:28:27:72:548:417:12:Times:12:Times:readily comes to mind and the analyst exaggerates its probability, despite the fact that Googles are 
21:576:39685:27:28:72:548:390:12:Times:12:Times:rare. After  bad  news,  the  most  representative  firms  are  lemons.  The  analyst  exaggerates  the 
21:577:39787:28:28:72:548:362:12:Times:12:Times:probability  of  this  type,  despite  the fact  that  lemons  are also quite  rare.  Exaggeration  in  the 
21:578:39894:28:28:72:464:334:12:Times:12:Times:reaction to news increases in 휃.  At 휃=0 the model reduces to rational learning. 
21:579:39972:28:27:108:548:306:12:Times:12:Times:The key  property  of diagnostic  expectations is “the kernel of truth”: distortions in beliefs 
21:580:40067:27:28:72:548:279:12:Times:12:Times:exaggerate  true  patterns  in  the  data. The  kernel  of  truth distinguishes our  approach from 
21:581:40165:28:28:72:548:251:12:Times:12:Times:alternative theories of extrapolation such as adaptive expectations or BSV (1998).  As we map the 
21:582:40261:28:27:72:548:223:12:Times:12:Times:model to the facts of Sections I and II, we first show that the kernel of truth is consistent with the 
21:583:40362:27:28:72:548:196:12:Times:12:Times:data: Googles are overweighed in the HLTG portfolio because they occur much more often there 
21:584:40452:28:27:72:155:168:12:Times:12:Times:than elsewhere.

21:588:40552:9:0:72:530:77:6:Times:10:Times:9 In fact, overconfidence predicts under-reaction to public news such as earnings releases (see Daniel et al. 1998).  
22:589:40668:0:28:108:548:709:12:Times:12:Times:To  link  our  model  to  the data we shift  attention  from  the  level  of  earnings  to  the  growth 
22:590:40771:28:28:72:548:681:12:Times:12:Times:rate  of  earnings,  which  is  what  analysts  predict  when  they  report  LTG.  Denote  by ℎ the horizon

22:598:41167:36:30:72:548:519:12:Times:12:Times:Expectations of long-term growth are shaped by mean reversion in eps and fundamentals. LTG is 
22:599:41259:30:29:72:548:489:12:Times:12:Times:high when firms have experienced positive news, so 푓̂푖,푡휃 is high, and/or when current earnings 푥푡 
22:600:41356:29:27:72:548:460:12:Times:12:Times:are low, which also raises future growth.  Both conditions line up with the evidence, which shows

22:602:41532:28:27:108:549:405:12:Times:12:Times:We begin by testing for the kernel of truth.  To this end, we first report in Figure 6 the true

23:613:42513:12:10:72:296:641:10:Times:10:Times:means of each distribution (1.11 vs. 1.08, respectively). 
23:614:42569:10:30:72:74:631:8:Times:8:Times: 
23:615:42569:30:28:108:549:601:12:Times:12:Times:Two  findings stand  out.  First,  HLTG  firms have  a  higher  average  future eps  growth than 
23:616:42664:28:28:72:548:573:12:Times:12:Times:all  other  firms,  as  we  saw  in  a  somewhat  different  format  in  Figure  2. Second,  and  critically, 
23:617:42773:28:27:72:548:545:12:Times:12:Times:HLTG firms display a fatter right tail of exceptional performers.  Googles are thus representative 
23:618:42869:27:28:72:549:518:12:Times:12:Times:for  HLTG  in  the  sense  of  definition  (4).   In  fact,  based  on  the  densities  in  Figure  6,  the  most 
23:619:42983:28:27:72:548:490:12:Times:12:Times:representative future growth realizations for HLTG firms are in the range of 40% to 60% annual 
23:620:43077:27:36:72:126:463:12:Times:12:Times:growth.10   
23:621:43088:36:28:108:548:427:12:Times:12:Times:In light of these data, our model predicts that analysts should over-estimate the number of 
23:622:43179:28:27:72:548:399:12:Times:12:Times:right-tail performers in the HLTG group. Figure 7 compares the distribution of future performance 
23:623:43277:27:28:72:548:372:12:Times:12:Times:of  HLTG  firms  (blue  line)  with  the  predicted  performance  for  the  same  firms  (red  line).11 
23:624:43380:28:28:72:548:344:12:Times:12:Times:Consistent with  diagnostic  expectations,  analysts  vastly  exaggerate  the  share  of  exceptional 
23:625:43482:28:27:72:548:316:12:Times:12:Times:performers, which are most representative of the HLTG group according to the true distribution of 
23:626:43580:27:28:72:549:289:12:Times:12:Times:future eps growth.12  As a robustness check, we reproduce in Appendix C Figures 6 and 7 using as 
23:627:43675:28:27:72:552:261:12:Times:12:Times:a measure of fundamentals revenues minus cost of goods sold (which may be less noisy that eps).  
23:628:43772:27:30:72:446:234:12:Times:12:Times:With this metric as well, the evidence supports the kernel of truth hypothesis. 
23:629:43851:30:8:216:218:204:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:                                                           
23:630:43909:8:15:72:547:196:6:Times:10:Times:10 Although HLTG firms tend to have also a slightly higher share of low performers, it is true that, as in our model, 
23:631:44026:15:9:72:446:181:10:Times:10:Times:higher growth rates are more representative for HLTG firms. See Figure C.1 in Appendix C.  
23:632:44114:9:16:72:548:172:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f5:11 In making this comparison, bear in mind that analysts report point estimates of a firm’s future earnings growth and 
23:633:44232:16:13:72:547:156:10:Times:10:Times:not its full distribution (in our model, they report only the mean 푓푖,푡휃 and not the variance 휎푓2). Thus, under rationality 
23:634:44355:13:8:72:447:143:10:Times:10:g_d0_f2:the LTG distribution would have the same mean but lower variance than realized eps growth. 
23:635:44445:8:15:72:548:135:6:Times:10:Times:12 The kernel of truth can also shed light on the asymmetry between HLTG and LLTG firms.  In Appendix C we show 
23:636:44555:15:12:72:547:120:10:Times:10:Times:that future performance of LLTG firms tends to be concentrated in the middle, with a most representative growth rate 
23:637:44672:12:11:72:548:108:10:Times:10:Times:of  0%.    It  is  thus  constant,  rather  than  bad,  performance  that  is  representative  of  LLTG  firms.  This  fact  can  help 
23:638:44807:11:12:72:548:97:10:Times:10:Times:explain why expectations about these firms and their market values are not overly depressed. One could capture this 
23:639:44923:12:11:72:548:85:10:Times:10:Times:difference between HLTG firms (representative high growth) and LLTG firms (representative 0% growth) by relaxing 
23:640:45036:11:0:72:487:74:10:Times:8:g_d0_f2:the assumption of normality, or alternatively by allowing lower volatility for firms in the LLTG group.

24:647:45591:13:12:72:548:454:11:Times:11:Times:long term earnings at time t.  The graph shows results for stocks in the highest decile of expected growth in 
24:648:45701:12:8:72:543:442:11:Times:10:Times:long term earnings at time t. The vertical lines indicate the means of each distribution (1.11 vs. 1.39, respectively).

24:650:45818:25:29:108:548:409:12:Times:12:Times:We next show that the model accounts for the previously documented facts. To explore the 
24:651:45904:29:34:72:548:380:12:Times:12:Times:dynamics of LTG in our model, we focus on the long run distribution of fundamentals 푓푖,푡 (which

24:664:46702:15:12:72:548:97:10:Times:10:Times:systematic  earnings  surprises:  the  average  earnings  news  in  the  population  of firms  is  zero.    As  a  consequence,  the 
24:665:46835:12:11:72:545:85:10:Times:10:Times:average diagnostic expectation coincides with the average rational expectation. However, diagnostic beliefs are fatter-
24:666:46954:11:0:72:430:74:10:Times:10:g_d0_f2:tailed than rational ones, because they exaggerate the frequency of Googles and Lemons. 
25:667:47043:0:28:108:548:709:12:Times:12:Times:We first review the patterns of fundamentals and expectations documented in Figures 2, 3 
25:668:47132:28:28:72:506:681:12:Times:12:Times:and 4.  In Section V.B, we review the patterns of returns documented in Figures 1 and 5.   
25:669:47222:28:27:107:548:653:12:Times:12:Times:We start  from Figure  2, which  says  that HLTG firms experience a  period  of  pronounced

25:681:47559:36:30:108:548:452:12:Times:12:Times:In our model, positive earnings surprises have two conflicting effects on long term growth 
25:682:47649:30:29:72:549:422:12:Times:12:Times:prospects and  thus  on  LTG.    On  the  one  hand,  they  raise estimated fundamentals 푓̂푖,푡휃,  which 
25:683:47751:29:27:72:551:393:12:Times:12:Times:enhance  future  growth.    On  the  other  hand,  they lower  future  growth  via mean  reversion.  
25:684:47851:27:28:72:548:366:12:Times:12:Times:Condition (7)  ensures  that  the  former  effect  dominates,  so  that  firms  with  rosy  future  prospects 
25:685:47960:28:27:72:548:338:12:Times:12:Times:(HLTG) are selected from those that have experienced good recent performance, while firms with 
25:686:48053:27:36:72:523:311:12:Times:12:Times:bad prospects (LLTG) are selected from those that have experienced bad recent performance. 
25:687:48143:36:28:108:548:275:12:Times:12:Times:The  parametric  restriction  of  Condition (7)  is  more  likely  to  hold  the  less  severe  is  mean 
25:688:48247:28:28:72:548:247:12:Times:12:Times:reversion (i.e., when 푏 is close to 1) and the larger is the signal to noise ratio 퐾.   It is also more 
25:689:48348:28:28:72:548:219:12:Times:12:Times:likely to hold the larger  is 휃 and for relatively large 푎 (with 푎<퐾(1+휃)). Note that  condition 
25:690:48441:28:28:72:548:191:12:Times:12:Times:(7) depends on the parameters of the true earnings process because analysts do not mechanically 
25:691:48537:28:0:72:217:163:12:Times:12:Times:extrapolate past performance. 
26:692:48567:0:28:108:548:709:12:Times:12:Times:Combined with mean reversion of earnings, Proposition 2 accounts for Figure 2, in which 
26:693:48651:28:28:72:548:681:12:Times:12:Times:HLTG  firms  experience  positive  growth  pre-formation,  which  subsequently  cools  off,  while 
26:694:48750:28:35:72:289:653:12:Times:12:Times:LLTG firms go through the opposite pattern. 
26:695:48793:35:28:108:548:618:12:Times:12:Times:We next show that the model can account for the fact documented in Figure 4, namely that 
26:696:48881:28:36:72:465:590:12:Times:12:Times:expectations for the long term growth of HLTG firms are excessively optimistic.  
26:697:48961:36:28:72:548:554:12:Times:12:Times:Proposition 3. If analysts are rational, 휃=0, they make no systematic error in predicting the log

26:704:49343:18:28:108:548:338:12:Times:12:Times:Under   rational   expectations, no   systematic   forecast   error can   be detected   by   an 
26:705:49437:28:28:72:548:310:12:Times:12:Times:econometrician  looking  at  the  data  (expectations are computed  using  the  true steady  state 
26:706:49536:28:28:72:548:282:12:Times:12:Times:probability  measure).   Indeed,  when 휃=0, the  average forecast  within  the many  firms  of  the 
26:707:49635:28:28:72:549:254:12:g_d0_f6:12:Times:HLTG푡 and LLTG푡 portfolios is well calibrated to the respective means.  Diagnostic expectations, 
26:708:49727:28:28:72:548:226:12:Times:12:Times:in  contrast, cause systematic  errors.    Firms  in  the HLTG푡 group are  systematically  over-valued: 
26:709:49828:28:27:72:548:198:12:Times:12:Times:analysts  over-react  to  their  pre-formation positive  surprises,  and  form  excessively  optimistic 
26:710:49932:27:28:72:548:171:12:Times:12:Times:forecasts of  fundamentals.    As  a  consequence,  the realized earnings growth  is on  average below 
26:711:50034:28:28:72:549:143:12:Times:12:Times:the forecast. Firms in the LLTG푡 group are systematically under-valued.  As a consequence, their 
26:712:50130:28:28:72:548:115:12:Times:12:Times:realized earnings growth is on average above the forecast.  As noted in Section III, the prediction 
26:713:50229:28:0:72:418:87:12:Times:12:Times:of systematic pessimism about LLTG firms is not borne out in the data. 
27:714:50299:0:28:108:548:709:12:Times:12:Times:Finally,  our  model  also  yields the  boom-bust LTG  pattern  in  the  HLTG  group  (and a 
27:715:50391:28:28:72:545:681:12:Times:12:Times:reverse pattern in the LLTG group) documented in Figure 3.  By Proposition 2, the improving pre-
27:716:50486:28:27:72:548:653:12:Times:12:Times:formation forecasts of HLTG firms are due to positive earnings surprises, while the deteriorating 
27:717:50584:27:28:72:549:626:12:Times:12:Times:pre formation forecasts of LLTG firms are due to negative ones. But the model also predicts post 
27:718:50681:28:29:72:548:598:12:Times:12:Times:formation  reversals  in  LTG  for  both  groups  of  firms.   To  see  this, we compare 퐿푇퐺푖,푡 forecasts

27:729:51351:27:28:72:548:277:12:Times:12:Times:correction  of  initial  forecast  errors. Post-formation,  the excess  optimism  of  HLTG  firms  on

27:731:51549:28:28:72:548:221:12:Times:12:Times:be implied by mean reversion alone.  The cooling off of excess optimism arises because there are 
27:732:51645:28:27:72:548:193:12:Times:12:Times:no  news  on  average  in  the  HLTG  portfolio,  which on  average  causes  no overreaction. Likewise, 
27:733:51748:27:28:72:524:166:12:Times:12:Times:the excess pessimism of LLTG firms dissipates, strengthening the reversal in that portfolio.14

28:740:52264:35:28:107:549:673:12:Times:12:Times:Consider  now the  return  patterns  documented  in  Figures  1  and  5.   To  explore the 
28:741:52354:28:28:72:548:645:12:Times:12:Times:implications of diagnostic expectations for portfolio returns, we take the required return 푅>1 as 
28:742:52451:28:44:72:393:617:12:Times:12:Times:given. The pricing condition for a firm 푖 at date 푡 is then given by:

28:747:52544:43:28:72:549:530:12:Times:12:Times:so that the stock price of firm 푖 is the discounted stream of expected future dividends as of 푡.  We 
28:748:52643:28:28:72:549:502:12:Times:12:Times:assume that 푅 is high enough that the discounted sum converges. By Equation (8), the equilibrium 
28:749:52738:28:30:72:493:474:12:Times:12:Times:price at 푡 is 푃푖,푡=피푡휃(푃푖,푡+1+퐷푖,푡+1)/푅.  Using this formula and Proposition 2, we find:

28:752:52913:29:36:72:289:391:12:Times:12:Times:the condition of Proposition 2, we have that:

28:754:52972:37:28:72:549:318:12:Times:12:Times:Because firms in the HLTG portfolio receive positive news before formation (Proposition 2), they 
28:755:53067:28:28:72:545:290:12:Times:12:Times:earn returns  higher  than  the  required  return 푅. Our  model  thus  yields  positive  abnormal  pre-
28:756:53169:28:27:72:548:262:12:Times:12:Times:formation returns for HLTG stocks, as well as the low pre-formation returns of  LLTG stocks, as 
28:757:53265:27:28:72:549:235:12:Times:12:Times:in  Figure  5.   This effect  does  not  rely  on  representativeness,  as  it  arises  also  for 휃=0. The  key 
28:758:53376:28:36:72:529:207:12:Times:12:Times:implication of representativeness is predictability of post-formation returns (Figures 1 and 5).   
28:759:53473:36:28:108:548:171:12:Times:12:Times:To see  this, note  that the average  realized  return going  forward (according  to  the  true

29:769:53763:28:28:72:549:680:12:Times:12:Times:the future expected price and dividend of firm 푖, namely when the denominator is larger than the 
29:770:53860:28:28:72:548:652:12:Times:12:Times:numerator  in  Equation  (9).    Conversely,  the  average  realized return at 푡+1 is higher than  the

29:772:54054:28:21:108:492:596:12:Times:12:Times:Diagnostic expectations thus yield the return predictability patterns of Figure 5.

29:781:54527:28:28:72:548:330:12:Times:12:Times:return 푅 for  particular  firms. However,  the  rational  model  cannot  account for systematic  return 
29:782:54630:28:27:72:549:302:12:Times:12:Times:predictability  in a large portfolio  of firms  sharing  a  certain  forecast.  Conditional on  current 
29:783:54733:27:36:72:544:275:12:Times:12:Times:information, rational forecasts are on average (across firms) correct and returns are unpredictable. 
29:784:54833:36:28:107:548:239:12:Times:12:Times:Under  the  diagnostic  Kalman filter  (휃>0),  in  contrast, the  HLTG  portfolio  exhibits 
29:785:54924:28:28:72:549:211:12:Times:12:Times:abnormally high returns up to portfolio formation and abnormally low returns after formation. The 
29:786:55022:28:27:72:548:183:12:Times:12:Times:converse holds for the  LLTG portfolio, just as we saw in Table 1 and  Figure 1.  This is because 
29:787:55120:27:28:72:548:156:12:Times:12:Times:post-formation expectations systematically revert to fundamentals, and in particular investors are 
29:788:55219:28:0:72:467:128:12:Times:12:Times:systematically disappointed in HLTG firms and their returns are abnormally low.  
30:789:55301:0:28:107:549:709:12:Times:12:Times:To  summarize,  the return  predictability documented  in  Figure 1 can  be  accounted  by 
30:790:55391:28:28:72:545:681:12:Times:12:Times:representativeness  but  not  by  rational  learning.  Rational  learning  can  account  for  the  pre-
30:791:55494:28:27:72:548:653:12:Times:12:Times:formation   return   patterns (Proposition   5), but it   does   not   yield post   formation   reversals

30:796:55788:28:27:72:548:491:12:Times:12:Times:expectations,  and returns  documented  in  Section  III. Three issues  remain  open.  The  first  is 
30:797:55888:27:28:72:548:464:12:Times:12:Times:whether  analyst  expectations (and hence returns) indeed  over-react to  news. The  challenge  of 
30:798:55984:28:27:72:548:436:12:Times:12:Times:testing  this  hypothesis  is  that  news  are  hard  to  measure,  as  they include  but  are  not restricted  to 
30:799:56099:27:28:72:548:409:12:Times:12:Times:observed  earnings.    The  second  issue is  whether  our  model  can  account  quantitatively, and  not 
30:800:56205:28:28:72:548:381:12:Times:12:Times:only qualitatively, for  the  dynamics  of  analyst  expectations and  returns  of  Section  III.  A  third 
30:801:56312:28:27:72:549:353:12:Times:12:Times:issue  is whether the  diagnostic  Kalman  filter improves  upon existing theories  of non-rational 
30:802:56412:27:36:72:506:326:12:Times:12:Times:expectations such as BSV’s (1998) model of investor sentiment or adaptive expectations.  
30:803:56496:36:27:107:548:290:12:Times:12:Times:This  section  addresses  these  issues  by  highlighting  additional  implications  of  our  model. 
30:804:56597:27:28:72:548:263:12:Times:12:Times:We assess the role of over-reaction in Section VI.A, the quantitative performance of the model in 
30:805:56694:28:28:72:548:235:12:Times:12:Times:Section  VI.B,  and  alternative  models  of  expectations  formation  in  Section  VI.C.    In  this  last 
30:806:56802:28:27:72:549:207:12:Times:12:Times:section,  we  also  revisit  the  possibility  that  analysts  may  be learning rationally from  prices about 
30:807:56910:27:28:72:549:180:12:g_d0_f5:12:Times:investors’ time varying required returns.  As we noted in Section III, this theory does not account 
30:808:57009:28:35:72:408:152:12:Times:12:Times:for expectations errors, but it could account for return predictability.

30:810:57082:36:0:72:280:81:12:Times:12:Times:VI.A Overreaction to News and Returns 
31:811:57121:0:28:107:548:709:12:Times:12:Times:To  assess  over-reaction  to  news,  we  first  need  to  have  a  measure  of  news.   Coibion  and 
31:812:57223:28:28:72:548:681:12:Times:12:Times:Gorodnichenko (2015) propose measuring the news received by the forecaster at time 푡 using their 
31:813:57316:28:28:72:548:653:12:Times:12:Times:forecast  revision  at 푡.   Such revision  can  in  fact  be interpreted  as  a  summary  for  all  information 
31:814:57426:28:28:72:548:625:12:Times:12:Times:received  by  the  forecaster  in  the  recent  past. Forecasters’ over  or  under  reaction  to  information 
31:815:57535:28:36:72:522:597:12:Times:12:Times:can then be assessed by correlating their forecast revision with the subsequent forecast error.  
31:816:57630:36:27:107:548:561:12:Times:12:Times:In  particular, Coibion  and  Gorodnichenko show  that  in  sticky  information or  rational 
31:817:57723:27:28:72:548:534:12:Times:12:Times:inattention  models  (Sims  2003,  Mankiw  and  Reis  2002),  consensus  forecast  revisions  should 
31:818:57824:28:27:72:548:506:12:Times:12:Times:positively  correlate  with  subsequent  consensus forecast  errors. Intuitively, when  expectations 
31:819:57925:27:28:72:548:479:12:Times:12:Times:under-react, a  positive forecast  revision indicates insufficient  upward  adjustment.  As  a  result,  it 
31:820:58030:28:27:72:548:451:12:Times:12:Times:should predict positive errors (i.e. realizations above the forecast). Bouchaud et al. (2016) use this 
31:821:58133:27:28:72:548:424:12:Times:12:Times:method  to  diagnose  under-reaction to news about firms’ profitability. The  same  approach  turns 
31:822:58232:28:26:72:266:396:12:Times:12:Times:out to be useful for our analysis as well.

32:856:60170:28:28:72:548:279:12:Times:12:Times:pointing to over-reaction to news. This holds regardless of the forecast horizon ℎ, so the pattern is 
32:857:60272:28:28:72:548:251:12:Times:12:Times:robust to alternative interpretations of LTG. The estimated 훾 tends to become more negative and

32:861:60627:9:15:72:547:149:6:Times:10:Times:16 Estimating  (10)  on  the  consensus  LTG  may  misleadingly  indicate under-reaction  if  individual  analysts  observe 
32:862:60750:15:12:72:548:134:10:Times:10:Times:noisy  signals,  so  that  there  is  dispersion  in their  forecasts. Coibion  and  Gorodnichenko  show  that  when  different 
32:863:60877:12:13:72:547:122:10:Times:10:Times:analysts observe noisy signals, the  coefficient in Equation (10) is positive  even if each analyst rationally revises  his 
32:864:61000:13:12:72:547:109:10:Times:10:Times:forecast.    In  this  respect,  finding  negative 훾 in a  consensus  regression  is  even  stronger  evidence  of  over-reaction  to 
32:865:61133:12:8:72:131:97:10:Times:10:Times:information.    
32:866:61148:8:15:72:547:89:6:Times:10:Times:17 This  feature  helps  reconcile  our  evidence  with  the  sluggishness  documented  by  Bouchaud  et  al.  (2016).  They 
32:867:61272:15:0:72:548:74:10:Times:10:Times:consider  forecasts  for  the  level  of  eps  over  short  horizons  such  as  1  or  2  years.  In  Appendix D  (see  Table  D.2)  we 
33:868:61409:0:28:107:549:708:12:Times:12:Times:Interestingly,  the  estimated 훾 also  gets  higher in  magnitude  and  more statistically 
33:869:61499:28:28:72:548:680:12:Times:12:Times:significant as we lengthen the revision period 푘=1,2,3 (i.e. moving from top to bottom in Table 
33:870:61594:28:29:72:545:652:12:Times:12:Times:2).  We  view  this  evidence  as  being  consistent  with  the  kernel  of  truth. From Equation  (6), over-
33:871:61702:29:39:72:534:623:12:Times:12:Times:reaction to information of the diagnostic filter 푓̂푖,푡휃 compared to the rational filter 푓̂푖,푡 is given by:

33:873:61844:37:28:72:548:547:12:Times:12:Times:where 퐾 is the true signal to noise ratio of information accruing during the revision period.   It is 
33:874:61945:28:28:72:548:519:12:Times:12:Times:plausible  that  persistent  signals  over  2  or  3  years  are  objectively  more  informative  about  future 
33:875:62057:28:28:72:548:491:12:Times:12:Times:earnings,  i.e.  have  a  higher 퐾,  than  occasional  signals accruing  over  one  year.  By the kernel  of 
33:876:62165:28:35:72:478:463:12:Times:12:Times:truth, then, such signals should induce more over-reaction, consistent with the data.  
33:877:62251:35:28:108:548:428:12:Times:12:Times: To the extent that over-reaction drives excess optimism about HLTG, and thus lower post 
33:878:62339:28:27:72:548:400:12:Times:12:Times:formation returns, stronger over-reaction should be associated with larger return spreads between 
33:879:62437:27:28:72:548:373:12:Times:12:Times:HLTG  and  LLTG  portfolios. In  Appendix D.3 we  show  that industries  in  which  overreaction  is 
33:880:62536:28:28:72:548:345:12:Times:12:Times:larger (i.e. 훾 is larger) also feature larger return spreads.  While these results should be taken with 
33:881:62639:28:28:72:548:317:12:Times:12:Times:caution due  to  the  small  number  of  industries,  they  are  suggestive  of  a  direct  link  between 
33:882:62744:28:157:72:247:289:12:Times:12:Times:overreaction and predicable returns.

33:884:62968:12:12:72:547:120:10:Times:10:Times:show  that  at  these  horizons  there is  some  evidence  of  under-reaction  also  in  our  data  (with  the  usual  caveat  of  the 
33:885:63102:12:11:72:547:108:10:Times:10:Times:under-reaction  bias  entailed  in  estimating  consensus  regressions).  The  seemingly  contradictory  findings  of  over  and 
33:886:63231:11:12:72:548:97:10:Times:10:Times:under-reaction  can  be  reconciled  by  combining  diagnostic expectation  with  some  short  run  rigidity  in  analyst 
33:887:63353:12:11:72:548:85:10:Times:10:Times:forecasts, stemming for instance from sporadic revision times. In this case, a piece of news would initially trigger few 
33:888:63474:11:0:72:526:74:10:Times:10:Times:adjustments, generating short term aggregate under-reaction, but will lead to overreaction as all analysts update.   
34:889:63592:0:28:108:548:709:12:Times:12:Times:Overall,  this  subsection  offers  evidence  in  support  of  the hypothesis that  expectation 
34:890:63687:28:28:72:548:681:12:Times:12:Times:formation about LTG features over-reaction to news, consistent with diagnostic expectations, but

34:914:65368:8:15:72:548:123:6:Times:10:Times:19 The  parameters  of  the  model  could  in  principle  be  estimated  by  fitting  a  Kalman  filter  to  the  data  of  individual

36:950:67304:28:28:72:548:681:12:Times:12:Times:earnings from the large accounting literature. This literature typically fits AR(1) processes for log 
36:951:67406:28:27:72:549:653:12:Times:12:Times:earnings to the data, and finds that estimates of the auto-regressive coefficient range from 0.77 to 
36:952:67507:27:28:72:548:626:12:Times:12:Times:0.84 with a mode at 0.8 (Sloan 1996).  If we fit an AR(1) to the data simulated with the calibrated

36:955:67808:28:27:72:548:534:12:Times:12:Times:1.22 is fairly close to the estimate for the same parameter obtained by BGS (2017) in the context 
36:956:67906:27:28:72:548:507:12:Times:12:Times:of  credit  spreads  (휃=0.91).    A 휃 of  the  order  of  one  intuitively  implies  that the  magnitude  of 
36:957:68014:28:28:72:549:479:12:Times:12:Times:forecast  errors is comparable to  the magnitude  of news  (i.e., in  the  current  context,  it  implies  a 
36:958:68122:28:36:72:255:451:12:Times:12:Times:doubling of the signal to noise ratio).  
36:959:68161:36:28:108:549:415:12:Times:12:Times:Finally,  we  calibrate  the  required  rate  of  return  on  stocks  to 푅=9.7%,  which  is  the 
36:960:68258:28:27:72:548:387:12:Times:12:Times:historical  value-weighted  average  market  return. Using  these  six  calibrated  parameters,  we 
36:961:68357:27:0:72:454:360:12:Times:12:Times:reproduce and report in Figure 8 the simulated versions of Figures 1 through 6.

37:964:68548:11:12:72:548:397:10:Times:10:Times:firms over 100 time periods, generating time series of fundamentals, earnings, and growth expectations.  At each time 
37:965:68666:12:12:72:548:385:10:Times:10:Times:period 푡, we sort firms on LTG forecasts.  Panel 1 shows the average return spread 1 year post-formation across LTG 
37:966:68782:12:11:72:547:373:10:Times:10:Times:deciles.  We  first  compute,  for  each  period 푡,  the  arithmetic  average  return  for  each  portfolio.  We  then  compute  the 
37:967:68915:11:12:72:548:362:10:Times:10:Times:geometric average of portfolio returns over time.  Panels 2, 3, and 5 show the average EPS, LTG, and returns of the 
37:968:69031:12:11:72:547:350:10:Times:10:Times:HLTG  and  LLTG  portfolios  from  year 푡−3 to  year 푡+3.  Panel  4  shows  the  forecast  error  on  HLTG  and  LLTG 
37:969:69147:11:12:72:547:339:10:Times:10:Times:portfolios in the 5 years porst-formation.  Panel 6 shows the distribution of realized earnings growth after 5 years for 
37:970:69268:12:21:72:409:327:10:Times:10:Times:HLTG and for non-HLTG firms, together with the forecast for growth after 5 years.

37:972:69349:36:27:108:548:270:12:Times:12:Times:The model reproduces the main qualitative features of the data.   In Panel 1, it reproduces 
37:973:69441:27:28:72:548:243:12:Times:12:Times:the return spread between HLTG and LLTG stocks.  In Panel 2, it reproduces the pattern of Figure 
37:974:69537:28:28:72:548:215:12:Times:12:Times:2 that pre-formation HLTG firms have fast growth, which then declines post formation.  In Panel 
37:975:69632:28:27:72:548:187:12:Times:12:Times:3  the  model  reproduces  the  boom  bust dynamics of LTG, with analysts’ expectations  becoming 
37:976:69730:27:28:72:548:160:12:Times:12:Times:more optimistic pre-formation, and then reverting post-formation.  Panel 4 reproduces the finding 
37:977:69828:28:34:72:548:132:12:Times:12:Times:of Figure 4 of large forecast errors (excess optimism) for HLTG stocks.20  Panel 5 reproduces the

37:979:69982:9:15:72:545:89:6:Times:10:g_d0_f6:20 The simulation produces forecasts at all horizons, so Panel 4 shows the forecast error in each year from 푡+1 to 푡+
37:980:70097:15:0:72:545:74:10:g_d0_f6:10:Times:5. In contrast, Figure 4 plots the difference between the realized growth in those years and the LTG forecast in year 푡. 
38:981:70218:0:28:72:548:709:12:Times:12:Times:boom-bust pattern in returns around portfolio formation.  Returns for HLTG stocks are very high 
38:982:70314:28:28:72:548:681:12:Times:12:Times:pre-formation,  but  then  collapse  below  the  required  return 푅 in  the  immediate  post  formation 
38:983:70417:28:28:72:549:653:12:Times:12:Times:period,  and  eventually  reverting back  to their  unconditional,  long  term  value.    The  opposite 
38:984:70519:28:27:72:549:625:12:Times:12:Times:happens  to  the  return  of  LLTG  stocks.    Finally,  and  crucially, the  model  exhibits  the  kernel  of 
38:985:70630:27:36:72:533:598:12:Times:12:Times:truth, in that HLTG firms do perform better going forward than non-HLTG firms  (panel 6).21    
38:986:70724:36:28:108:548:562:12:Times:12:Times:The  model  fails to capture some  qualitative  features  of  the data.  It  does not  capture  the 
38:987:70821:28:27:72:548:534:12:Times:12:Times:persistent high earnings growth of HLTG stocks before formation, nor the negative forecast error 
38:988:70918:27:36:72:505:507:12:Times:12:Times:for LLTG.  We return to these issues when we summarize the results of the calibration.     
38:989:71006:36:27:108:548:471:12:Times:12:Times:We now assess how the model performs quantitatively.  Consider first the cross sectional 
38:990:71095:27:28:72:549:444:12:Times:12:Times:predictability  of  returns.  The  calibrated  model  entails  an  average  LLTG-HLTG  yearly return 
38:991:71196:28:28:72:548:416:12:Times:12:Times:spread of 15% in  year 푡+1 (see Panel 1).   At the portfolio level, in the calibration  LLTG earns 
38:992:71294:28:28:72:548:388:12:Times:12:Times:average yearly returns of 20% while HLTG earns 5%.  The empirical counterparts to these values 
38:993:71389:28:27:72:548:360:12:Times:12:Times:are 15% and 3%, with a gap of 12%.  Thus, a calibration based on earnings and expectations data 
38:994:71485:27:36:72:322:333:12:Times:12:Times:provides a good match to the evidence on returns.22 
38:995:71535:36:28:108:548:297:12:Times:12:Times:We can also assess model performance regarding the dynamics of expectations, relative to 
38:996:71624:28:27:72:548:269:12:Times:12:Times:the  underlying  earnings  process.  In  doing  so, we  note  upfront that the annualized levels of 
38:997:71722:27:28:72:548:242:12:Times:12:Times:earnings  growth (and  expectations  thereof)  over  a  four  year  horizon  obtained  in  the  model  are 
38:998:71829:28:27:72:548:214:12:Times:12:Times:roughly  one-fourth  the  size  of  their  empirical  counterparts.    Despite  this  level  effect,  which  we 
38:999:71941:27:28:72:548:187:12:Times:12:Times:revisit  below, the  dynamics of  the  simulation provide  a  reasonable match to the  data on 
38:1000:72035:28:26:72:548:159:12:Times:12:Times:expectations. For  example,  the  average  LTG  for  HLTG  firms at  formation is 3.25  times  their 
38:1001:72134:26:9:216:218:133:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:                                                           
38:1002:72192:9:15:72:548:124:6:Times:10:Times:21 As  a  check,  we  show  in  the  Appendix  that  imposing  rational  expectations  (휃=0)  yields  zero  average  forecast 
38:1003:72317:15:8:72:360:109:10:Times:10:Times:errors and average returns equal to the required return for all portfolios. 
38:1004:72391:8:15:72:548:101:6:Times:10:Times:22 In  the  Appendix,  we  check  the  robustness  of  this  quantitative  performance  as  a  function  of 휃 (keeping  the  other 
38:1005:72520:15:12:72:548:86:10:Times:10:Times:parameters fixed).  Figure D.2 shows that the match with the HLTG-LLTG return spread (Figure 1) is best at 휃=1.2, 
38:1006:72633:12:0:72:273:74:10:Times:10:Times:and decays strongly as 휃 deviates from this value. 
39:1007:72684:0:28:72:548:709:12:Times:12:Times:actual  EPS  annual  growth  rate over the  subsequent 4 years  (39%  vs  12%,  see Figure  7).   In  our 
39:1008:72789:28:36:72:408:681:12:Times:12:Times:model, LTG exaggerates growth by a factor of 2.14 (7.5% vs 3.5%).   
39:1009:72856:36:28:108:548:645:12:Times:12:Times:The  model also  captures both  the  size  and  the  speed of the  boom-bust  pattern  in 
39:1010:72946:28:27:72:548:617:12:Times:12:Times:expectations: from  year 푡−3 to  year 푡+3, simulated LTG  forecasts  for  HLTG  firms rise  by 
39:1011:73039:27:28:72:548:590:12:Times:12:Times:100% relative  to baseline and  then  fall  again.  In the  data,  the corresponding  figure  is 68%. 
39:1012:73136:28:36:72:540:562:12:Times:12:Times:Importantly, in both the model and the data, the bulk of action happens in years 푡−1 to 푡+1.23  
39:1013:73229:36:28:108:548:526:12:Times:12:Times:Our  overall  assessment  is that the  model  is able, both  qualitatively  and  quantitatively, to 
39:1014:73329:28:27:72:548:498:12:Times:12:Times:account  for several key  features of  the  data,  including the predictable  return  spread  between 
39:1015:73428:27:28:72:548:471:12:Times:12:Times:HLTG and LLTG portfolios and the dynamics of expectations relative to earnings process.  At the 
39:1016:73523:28:28:72:551:443:12:Times:12:Times:same time, the model is very stylized, abstracting away from both firm and investor heterogeneity.  
39:1017:73623:28:27:72:549:415:12:Times:12:Times:These  assumptions  can  be  relaxed without  compromising the tractability  of  the  Diagnostic 
39:1018:73719:27:28:72:548:388:12:Times:12:Times:Kalman filter. An appropriate treatment of firm heterogeneity and variation in beliefs would likely 
39:1019:73818:28:35:72:379:360:12:Times:12:Times:help in accounting for the features our model does not capture.  
39:1020:73881:35:28:108:548:325:12:Times:12:Times:For  example,  the  model  fails  to  reproduce  the  pre-formation  EPS  dynamics of  Figure  2, 
39:1021:73978:28:28:72:549:297:12:Times:12:Times:and the  pre-formation return  dynamics  of  Figure  5. In  fact, HLTG  firms  experience  strong 
39:1022:74076:28:28:72:548:269:12:Times:12:Times:persistent  growth (and  positive  returns) in  years 푡−3 through 푡.  However, allowing  for  firm 
39:1023:74171:28:27:72:549:241:12:Times:12:Times:heterogeneity would  improve  the  fit, because HLTG  firms  are  disproportionately younger  and 
39:1024:74267:27:28:72:548:214:12:Times:12:Times:thus  smaller  than  average.24  The  same  mechanism  would  generate  much  higher  growth  (and 
39:1025:74364:28:31:72:549:186:12:Times:12:Times:expectations  thereof)  for  HLTG  firms,  yielding  a  better  match also  with  the  growth  levels  in the 
39:1026:74474:31:8:216:218:155:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:                                                           
39:1027:74532:8:15:72:548:147:6:Times:10:Times:23 As  noted  in Section  III,  the  model  predicts  a  positive  forecast  error  for  LLTG  portfolio,  which  is  not true in  the 
39:1028:74666:15:9:72:95:132:10:Times:10:Times:data.  
39:1029:74671:9:15:72:548:123:6:Times:10:Times:24 In  our  calibration,  high  LTG  is  associated  with  low  EPS,  because  mean  reversion  is  strong  (푏 is  low).    In  steady 
39:1030:74804:15:11:72:548:108:10:Times:10:Times:state, this requires negative growth, and poor returns, in the pre-formation years 푡−3 to 푡−1, as in Figure 8. But in 
39:1031:74921:11:12:72:547:97:10:Times:10:Times:reality, HLTG are disproportionately young firms that are starting out small.  For such firms, persistent growth would 
39:1032:75040:12:11:72:548:85:10:Times:10:Times:in  fact lead to high growth forecasts. Thus, accounting for  heterogeneity in  firm age  would improve  the  match  with 
39:1033:75162:11:0:72:427:74:10:Times:10:Times:the data, and also capture asymmetries in performance between HLTG and LLTG firms. 
40:1034:75246:0:28:72:548:709:12:Times:12:Times:data.   In  turn,  accounting  for  heterogeneity  in investors’ beliefs  would  capture  the dispersion in 
40:1035:75352:28:28:72:548:681:12:Times:12:Times:LTG  forecasts,  which  we  abstract  from here.   In  Figure  1,  the  return  spread  is  strongest  for  the 
40:1036:75463:28:27:72:548:653:12:Times:12:Times:highest  deciles  of  the  LTG  distribution,  but  is shallower  in  the  lower deciles,  particularly  after 
40:1037:75574:27:28:72:548:626:12:Times:12:Times:1998 (see  Figure  B.1  in Appendix B).   This is  consistent with  the  possibility  that,  since  1998, 
40:1038:75676:28:27:72:548:598:12:Times:12:Times:arbitrage improved for LLTG firms but not for HLTG firms, which are smaller and more costly to 
40:1039:75769:27:36:72:126:571:12:Times:12:Times:arbitrage.   
40:1040:75781:36:36:72:75:535:12:Times:12:Times: 
40:1041:75781:36:35:72:317:499:12:Times:12:Times:VI.C Alternative Mechanisms for Overreaction 
40:1042:75824:35:28:107:548:464:12:Times:12:Times:We conclude by comparing diagnostic expectations with alternative models of expectation 
40:1043:75912:28:27:72:549:436:12:Times:12:Times:formation.    We  begin  with  models  of overreaction  to  news,  such  as  the  BSV  model  of  investor 
40:1044:76019:27:28:72:548:409:12:Times:12:Times:sentiment and mechanical extrapolation.  BSV is an early attempt to formalize the psychology of 
40:1045:76115:28:28:72:548:381:12:Times:12:g_d0_f5:representativeness. It assumes that the true process driving a firm’s earnings is a random walk, but 
40:1046:76215:28:27:72:548:353:12:Times:12:Times:analysts perform Bayesian updating across two incorrect models, one where earnings are believed 
40:1047:76311:27:28:72:548:326:12:Times:12:Times:to  trend  and  one  where  they  mean  revert.    Over-reaction  occurs  because  periods  of  fast  earnings 
40:1048:76422:28:27:72:548:298:12:Times:12:g_d0_f5:growth induce the analyst to attach a high probability that the firm is of the “trending type”, even 
40:1049:76523:27:28:72:247:271:12:Times:12:Times:though no firm is actually trending.  
40:1050:76559:28:28:107:548:243:12:Times:12:Times:Our  model  captures  the  key  intuition  of  BSV:  after  good  performance  analysts  place 
40:1051:76654:28:27:72:548:215:12:Times:12:Times:disproportionate  weight  on strong  fundamentals,  and  the  reverse  after  bad  performance.  It  has, 
40:1052:76759:27:28:72:548:188:12:Times:12:Times:however,  two  main  advantages  relative  to  its  antecedent.   First, in  the  BSV  model  extrapolation 
40:1053:76867:28:28:72:548:160:12:Times:12:Times:follows from belief in models.  In contrast, our model yields the kernel of truth: the HLTG group 
40:1054:76961:28:27:72:548:132:12:Times:12:Times:features  a  relatively  higher  share  of  Googles,  and  analysts  exaggerate  this share  in  their 
40:1055:77063:27:28:72:549:105:12:Times:12:Times:assessment.  This means, in contrast to the above, that belief distortions can be predicted from the 
40:1056:77164:28:0:72:549:77:12:Times:12:Times:data.   Figures  6  and  7  are indeed  consistent  with  this  prediction.    The  second  advantage  of  our 
41:1057:77276:0:28:72:548:709:12:Times:12:Times:model is portability: it is not designed for a specific finance setting, and so it can be easily applied 
41:1058:77381:28:28:72:359:681:12:Times:12:Times:to probability judgments, learning contexts or stereotyping. 
41:1059:77441:28:27:108:549:653:12:Times:12:Times:The  other  conventional  approach  to  over-reaction,  mechanical  extrapolation,  implies  that 
41:1060:77539:27:37:72:521:626:12:Times:12:Times:LTG is formed as a distributed lag of past earnings growth rates, following the adaptive rule: 
41:1061:77633:37:38:248:548:589:12:g_d0_f6:12:Times:푥푡+1푎푑=푥푡푎푑+휇(푥푡−푥푡푎푑),                                                     (11) 
41:1062:77660:38:28:72:549:551:12:Times:12:Times:where 푥푡푎푑 is the expectation held at 푡 about the level or growth of eps at a certain period, 푥푡 is the 
41:1063:77761:28:28:72:549:523:12:Times:12:Times:current  realized  level  of  growth  of  earnings,  and 휇∈[0,1] is  a  fixed  coefficient.    If 휇 is  low, 
41:1064:77868:28:28:72:548:495:12:Times:12:Times:expectations  under-react  to  news.  But  if 휇 is  large  relative  to  the  persistence  of  the  earnings 
41:1065:77976:28:28:72:297:467:12:Times:12:Times:process, expectations can over-react to news.   
41:1066:78023:28:27:108:549:439:12:Times:12:Times:The  difference  between  our  model  and  mechanical  extrapolation  is  that  diagnostic 
41:1067:78114:27:30:72:548:412:12:Times:12:Times:expectations  are  forward  looking. Under  the  mechanical  rule  of  Equation  (11),  analysts  revise 
41:1068:78219:30:28:72:548:382:12:Times:12:Times:growth  expectations  downward  if  and  only  if  bad  news  arrive,  namely  if (푥푡−푥푡푎푑)<0. In 
41:1069:78315:28:28:72:548:354:12:Times:12:Times:contrast, under diagnostic expectations decision makers are influenced by the features of the data 
41:1070:78414:28:28:72:548:326:12:Times:12:Times:generating  process  such  as  the  true  share  of  Googles  and  the  mean  reversion  of  earnings.  For 
41:1071:78522:28:27:72:548:298:12:Times:12:Times:instance,  when  considering  firms  that  have  grown fast  in  the  past,  such  as  HLTG  ones,  growth 
41:1072:78628:27:28:72:363:271:12:Times:12:Times:forecasts will cool off over time even if no news is received. 
41:1073:78689:28:29:108:521:243:12:Times:12:Times:In fact, the revision of believed fundamentals from one period to the next is given by: 
41:1074:78776:29:31:195:424:214:12:g_d0_f6:12:Times:푓̂푖,푡+1휃−푓̂푖,푡휃=퐾(1+휃)(푥푖,푡+1−푏푥푖,푡−푎푓̂푖,푡휃) 
41:1075:78820:31:22:160:460:183:12:g_d0_f6:12:Times:−(1−푎)푓̂푖,푡−퐾휃(1−푎퐾(1+휃))(푥푖,푡−푏푥푖,푡−1−푎푓̂푖,푡−1) 
41:1076:78868:22:18:72:73:161:5:Times:5:Times: 
41:1077:78868:18:29:72:548:143:12:Times:12:Times:The  revision  depends  in  part  on  the  surprise relative  to  diagnostic  expectations,  namely  on 
41:1078:78971:29:31:72:545:114:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:푥푖,푡+1−푏푥푖,푡−푎푓̂푖,푡휃.    But  even  in  the  absence  of  surprising  earnings, namely  when 푥푖,푡−
41:1079:79069:31:0:72:548:83:12:g_d0_f6:12:Times:푏푥푖,푡−1=푎푓̂푖,푡−1, beliefs about fundamentals are updated. This is partially due to mean reversion 
42:1080:79169:0:30:72:548:707:12:Times:12:Times:of fundamentals (i.e. the second term −(1−푎)푓̂푖,푡), but also due to the waning of over-reaction to 
42:1081:79266:30:29:72:548:677:12:Times:12:Times:previous shocks (i.e. the third term 푥푖,푡−푏푥푖,푡−1−푎푓̂푖,푡−1).  For HLTG stocks, both forces point 
42:1082:79361:29:27:72:548:648:12:Times:12:Times:toward  a downward  revision  of  believed  fundamentals, regardless  of  the  current  news  received, 
42:1083:79464:27:28:72:549:621:12:Times:12:Times:while  for  LLTG  stocks the  opposite holds.    This leads to systematic mean  reversion of  LTG 
42:1084:79560:28:28:72:548:593:12:Times:12:Times:estimates for  these  portfolios.   In  contrast,  no  systematic  mean  reversion  should  be  expected 
42:1085:79664:28:27:72:214:565:12:Times:12:Times:under adaptive expectations.  
42:1086:79693:27:28:107:549:538:12:Times:12:Times:To test  this prediction,  we  consider  the  change  in  LTG  around  earnings  announcement 
42:1087:79787:28:27:72:549:510:12:Times:12:Times:dates.    We  rank  earnings of  all  firms surprises  into  deciles  and follow  LTG revisions for  each 
42:1088:79892:27:205:72:317:483:12:Times:12:Times:decile.  The results are reported in Figure 9 below.

42:1091:80052:13:13:72:546:241:11:Times:11:Times:and fiscal year 푡, we compute the difference between the first-available LTG forecast made during the 45-
42:1092:80157:13:13:72:548:228:11:g_d0_f5:11:Times:90 day window following the earnings’ announcement for 푡−1 and the first-available LTG forecast made 
42:1093:80257:13:13:72:548:215:11:Times:11:Times:during  the  45-90 day window following the earnings’ announcement for 푡.    We  rank  observations  into 
42:1094:80363:13:12:72:548:202:11:Times:11:Times:deciles based on the ratio of the forecasting error for earnings per share in year 푡 to the stock price when 
42:1095:80471:12:13:72:548:190:11:Times:11:Times:that forecast was made. We  measure  forecasting errors  using the first-available  forecasts  for earnings  per 
42:1096:80584:13:13:72:548:177:11:Times:11:Times:share during the  45-90 day window following the earnings’ announcement for 푡−1.  The  Figure  reports 
42:1097:80686:13:15:72:394:164:11:Times:10:Times:the sample average for all observations, for portfolios HLTG and LLTG.

42:1099:80756:26:28:108:548:123:12:Times:12:Times:The  data  show  strong  evidence  of  systematic  mean   reversion.    Regardless  of  the 
42:1100:80847:28:0:72:548:95:12:Times:12:Times:experienced  earnings  surprise,  expectations  about  HLTG  firms  deteriorate  while  those  about 
43:1101:80950:0:28:72:548:709:12:Times:12:Times:LLTG ones improve. Thus, the reversal of Figure 3 is not simply due to the fact that HLTG firms 
43:1102:81046:28:28:72:549:681:12:Times:12:Times:on average receive bad surprises and LLTG firms on average receive good surprises.  Rather, even 
43:1103:81143:28:27:72:548:653:12:Times:12:Times:HLTG  firms  that  experience  positive  earnings  surprises  are  downgraded,  and even LLTG  firms 
43:1104:81243:27:28:72:549:626:12:Times:12:Times:that  experience  negative  earnings  surprises  are  upgraded. These  findings are  puzzling  from  the 
43:1105:81347:28:27:72:548:598:12:Times:12:Times:perspective  of adaptive  expectations, but are consistent  with  the  forward-looking  nature  of 
43:1106:81443:27:28:72:548:571:12:Times:12:Times:diagnostic  expectations.25  In  Appendix E,  we  show  that  the  same pattern  emerges  in  our 
43:1107:81540:28:36:72:166:543:12:Times:12:Times:calibrated model.26 
43:1108:81559:36:27:108:548:507:12:Times:12:Times:We  conclude  this  section  with  a  discussion  of  an  alternative  mechanism  of  expectation 
43:1109:81657:27:28:72:549:480:12:Times:12:Times:formation  compatible  with  rational  expectations,  namely  the  possibility  that  analyst  expectations 
43:1110:81765:28:27:72:549:452:12:Times:12:g_d0_f5:are  formed,  at  least  in  part, by  rational  learning  from  prices.    Suppose that investors’ required 
43:1111:81874:27:28:72:548:425:12:Times:12:Times:return is unobservable and follows a mean-reverting process. In this model, price increases signal 
43:1112:81973:28:28:72:548:397:12:g_d0_f5:12:Times:an improvement in fundamentals but also a decrease in investors’ required return (i.e. prices go up 
43:1113:82073:28:27:72:548:369:12:Times:12:Times:partially because the market is bullish about a firm).  As a consequence, this mechanism predicts 
43:1114:82171:27:28:72:548:342:12:Times:12:Times:that, for analysts who infer about fundamentals from stock prices, expectations of earnings growth 
43:1115:82270:28:35:72:363:314:12:Times:12:Times:and expectations of returns should be negatively correlated.  
43:1116:82330:35:28:108:548:279:12:g_d0_f5:12:Times:To  test  this  prediction,  we  construct  a  measure  of  analysts’ expectations  of  returns by 
43:1117:82427:28:28:72:549:251:12:Times:12:Times:gathering IBES data  on  the  projected  price  level  forecasted  by  analysts  within  a  12-month 
43:1118:82528:28:34:72:548:223:12:Times:12:Times:horizon.   Historical data on target prices is available since March 1999.  We define target returns 
43:1119:82628:34:9:216:218:189:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:                                                           
43:1120:82686:9:16:72:547:180:6:g_d0_f2:10:Times:25 In the  Appendix,  we  show that  adaptive  expectations predict no over-reaction to news after the  persistence of the 
43:1121:82808:16:11:72:547:164:10:Times:10:Times:earnings  process  is accounted  for.  After  controlling  for  current  levels 푥푡,  the  adaptive  forecast  revision (푥푡+1푎−푥푡푎) 
43:1122:82937:11:12:72:545:153:10:Times:10:Times:should  positively  predict  forecast  errors  as  in  the  under-reaction  models.    In  contrast,  diagnostic  expectations  over-
43:1123:83070:12:9:72:366:141:10:Times:10:Times:react to news regardless of the persistence of the data generating process. 
43:1124:83145:9:16:72:548:132:7:g_d0_f2:10:Times:26 Fuster,   Laibson   and   Mendel   (2010)   suggest   an   alternative   mechanism   of   expectations   formation,   natural 
43:1125:83273:16:11:72:548:116:10:Times:10:Times:expectations,  according  to  which  investors  simplify  hump-shaped  stochastic  processes  by  neglecting  the  impact  of 
43:1126:83399:11:12:72:548:105:10:Times:10:Times:shocks  in  the  distant  past,  e.g.  by  fitting  an  AR(1).    In  this  model,  investors  who  witness  good  performance  expect 
43:1127:83534:12:11:72:548:93:10:Times:10:Times:growth  to  continue  and  exhibit  extrapolation.    However,  earnings  processes  are  reasonably  represented  by  AR(1) 
43:1128:83659:11:0:72:358:82:10:Times:10:Times:processes, which limits the impact of such a simplification mechanism.

44:1133:84041:27:28:72:549:590:12:Times:12:Times:above.    Our  model  does  not  provide  a  meaningful  counterpart  to  this  finding,  as  (diagnostic) 
44:1134:84148:28:36:72:320:562:12:Times:12:Times:expectations of returns are constant and equal to 푅.

44:1136:84200:36:35:72:162:490:12:Times:12:Times:VII. Conclusion.  
44:1137:84217:35:28:108:549:455:12:Times:12:Times: This paper revisits what since Shiller (1981) has been perhaps the most basic challenge to 
44:1138:84307:28:27:72:548:427:12:Times:12:Times:rational  asset pricing, namely  over-reaction  to  news  and  the  resulting  excess  volatility and  mean 
44:1139:84412:27:28:72:548:400:12:Times:12:Times:reversion.  We investigate this phenomenon in the context of individual stocks, for which we have 
44:1140:84508:28:28:72:548:372:12:Times:12:Times:extensive evidence on security prices, fundamentals, but also -- crucially -- expectations of future 
44:1141:84606:28:27:72:548:344:12:Times:12:Times:fundamentals.      LaPorta  (1996)  has  shown  empirically  that  securities  whose  long-term  earnings 
44:1142:84712:27:28:72:548:317:12:Times:12:Times:growth  analysts are most  optimistic  about  earn  low  returns  going  forward.    Here  we propose a 
44:1143:84814:28:27:72:548:289:12:Times:12:Times:theory  of  belief  formation  that  delivers  this  finding,  but  also  provides  a  characterization  of  joint 
44:1144:84929:27:36:72:478:262:12:Times:12:Times:evolution of fundamentals, expectations, and returns that can be taken to the data.     
44:1145:85016:36:28:108:548:226:12:Times:12:Times:A central feature of our theory is that investors are forward looking, in the sense that they 
44:1146:85110:28:27:72:548:198:12:Times:12:Times:react  to  news.    However,  their  reaction  is  distorted  by  representativeness, the  fundamental 
44:1147:85213:27:28:72:548:171:12:Times:12:Times:psychological principle that people put too much probability weight on states of the world that the 
44:1148:85313:28:28:72:548:143:12:Times:12:Times:news they  receive  is  most favorable  to.  In  psychology,  this  is  known  as  the  kernel  of  truth 
44:1149:85419:28:27:72:549:115:12:Times:12:Times:hypothesis: people react to information in the right direction, but too strongly.  We call such belief 
44:1150:85522:27:0:72:548:88:12:Times:12:Times:formation diagnostic expectations, and show that  a theory of security prices based on this model 
45:1151:85622:0:28:72:548:709:12:Times:12:Times:of beliefs can  explain  not  just  previously  documented  return  anomalies,  but  also  the  joint 
45:1152:85722:28:36:72:335:681:12:Times:12:Times:evolution of fundamentals, expectations, and returns.   
45:1153:85777:36:27:108:549:645:12:Times:12:Times:The  theory  is  portable  in  the  sense  that  the  same  model  of  belief  distortions  has  been 
45:1154:85879:27:28:72:548:618:12:Times:12:Times:shown  to  work  in  several other  contexts.    At  the  same  time,  the  model  can  be  analyzed  using  a 
45:1155:85989:28:27:72:548:590:12:Times:12:Times:variation  of  Kalman  Filter  techniques  used  in  models  of  rational  learning.   Most  important,  the 
45:1156:86098:27:28:72:548:563:12:Times:12:Times:theory  yields  a  number  of  strong  empirical  predictions,  which  have  not  been  considered  before, 
45:1157:86206:28:28:72:548:535:12:Times:12:Times:but  which  we  have  brought  to  the  data.      Although  some  puzzles  remain,  the  evidence  is 
45:1158:86309:28:35:72:246:507:12:Times:12:Times:supportive of the proposed theory.   
45:1159:86345:35:28:108:548:472:12:Times:12:Times:Of course, this is just a start.  Our approach to expectation formation can be taken to other 
45:1160:86438:28:27:72:548:444:12:Times:12:Times:contexts,  most  notably  aggregate stock  prices  but  also  macroeconomic  time  series.    We  have 
45:1161:86541:27:28:72:549:417:12:Times:12:Times:focused  on  distortions  of  beliefs  about  the  means  of  future  fundamentals,  but  the  kernel  of  truth 
45:1162:86654:28:28:72:549:389:12:Times:12:Times:idea could be applied to thinking about other moments as well, such as variance or skewness. We 
45:1163:86748:28:27:72:548:361:12:Times:12:Times:hope to pursue these ideas in future work, but stress what we see as the central point: the theory of 
45:1164:86849:27:28:72:548:334:12:Times:12:Times:asset pricing can incorporate fundamental psychological insights while retaining the rigor and the 
45:1165:86948:28:27:72:549:306:12:Times:12:Times:predictive  discipline  of rational  expectations  models. And it can  explain the data not  just  on  the 
45:1166:87053:27:28:72:548:279:12:Times:12:Times:joint evolution of fundamentals and security prices, but also on expectations, in a unified dynamic 
45:1167:87153:28:28:72:548:251:12:Times:12:Times:framework.    Relaxing  the  rational  expectations  assumption  does  not  entail  a  loss  of  rigor;  to  the 
45:1168:87266:28:27:72:548:223:12:Times:12:Times:contrary  it  allows for  a  disciplined  account  of  additional  features  of  the  data.  A calibration 
45:1169:87372:27:28:72:548:196:12:Times:12:Times:exercise  suggests,  moreover, that  the  model  can  replicate  several  quantitative,  and  not  just 
45:1170:87475:28:0:72:373:168:12:Times:12:Times:qualitative, features of the data.

58:1541:103904:37:28:72:548:577:12:Times:12:Times:Intuitively,  a positive  covariance  means  that  positive  surprises  at 푡 tend  to  be  associated with

58:1546:104258:28:40:72:425:416:12:Times:12:Times:the surprise at 푡−1 (last term), so these drop out.  Write the first term as

65:1718:112499:21:28:108:548:274:12:Times:12:Times:We  next  try  to  tie  over-reaction  to  news  to  the  return  spread  between  HLTG  and  LLTG 
65:1719:112598:28:28:72:548:246:12:Times:12:Times:portfolios.  We estimate Equation (10) by pooling firms at the industry level, using the Fama and 
65:1720:112696:28:28:72:549:218:12:Times:12:Times:French  classification.    To  capture  industry  and  firm  specific  factors,  we  allow  for  industry×year 
65:1721:112807:28:28:72:548:190:12:Times:12:Times:fixed effects. This yields an industry level estimate 훾푠, where 푠 indexes the industry, which we can 
65:1722:112907:28:27:72:548:162:12:Times:12:Times:correlate with the industry level LLTG-HLTG spread. These results should be taken with caution, 
65:1723:113003:27:0:72:256:135:12:Times:12:Times:due to the small number of industries. 
66:1724:113043:0:28:108:548:709:12:Times:12:Times:In Figure D.1, we compare the post formation return spread across different terciles of the 
66:1725:113135:28:28:72:549:681:12:Times:12:Times:distribution  of  industry 훾푠.    Consistent  with  our  prediction,  the  extra  return  obtained  by  betting 
66:1726:113247:28:28:72:549:653:12:Times:12:Times:against  HLTG  firms  is  highest  in  sectors  that  feature  most  over-reaction,  namely  those  in  the 
66:1727:113355:28:28:72:548:625:12:Times:12:Times:bottom tercile of 훾푠. The return differential is sizable, though given the small sample size it is not 
66:1728:113458:28:28:72:548:597:12:Times:12:Times:statistically  significant.  Thus,  the  pattern  of  LLTG-HLTG  return  spreads  across  industries  is 
66:1729:113563:28:27:72:548:569:12:Times:12:Times:consistent  with  a  link  from  overreaction  to  news  to  overvaluation  of  HLTG  stocks  and  thus  to 
66:1730:113671:27:227:72:300:542:12:Times:12:Times:abnormally low returns of the HLTG portfolio.

66:1733:113819:13:13:72:548:270:10:Times:10:Times:we  estimate  the  regression:   (퐸푃푆푡+4/퐸푃푆푡)1/4−(1+퐿푇퐺푡)=훼푖+휇푖,푡+훾푖(퐿푇퐺푡−퐿푇퐺푡−3)+휀푖,푡 where μt are 
66:1734:113919:13:15:72:547:257:10:Times:10:Times:year  fixed  effects,  EPS  is  earnings  per  share,  and  LTG  is  the  forecast  long-term  growth  in  earnings.    We  rank 
66:1735:114048:15:15:72:548:242:10:Times:10:Times:industries  according  to 훾푖푆 and  form  the  following  three  groups:  (1)  14  industries  with  the  lowest 훾푖푆,  (2)  24 
66:1736:114173:15:13:72:548:227:10:Times:10:Times:industries with intermediate values of 훾푖푆, and (3) 14 industries with the highest 훾푖푆.  Finally, for each year and each 
66:1737:114294:13:12:72:548:214:10:Times:10:Times:group, we compute the difference in return for the  LLTG (i.e. bottom 30% of LTG) and HLTG (i.e. highest 30% of 
66:1738:114406:12:15:72:547:202:10:Times:10:Times:LTG) portfolios. The graph shows the arithmetic  mean of the  LLTG-HLTG spread for grouping industries based on 
66:1739:114518:15:16:72:176:187:12:g_d0_f6:10:Times:훾푖푆 from the regression.

67:1745:114560:22:28:108:549:665:12:Times:12:Times:In this section, we extend our analysis of the calibration with two numerical exercises. The 
67:1746:114652:28:28:72:549:637:12:Times:12:Times:first tests the robustness of our estimate 휃=1.2.  To do so, we evaluate the matching between the 
67:1747:114748:28:28:72:548:609:12:Times:12:Times:predicted  return  spread and the  empirical  return  spread for 휃∈[0,2.4] (keeping  the  other 
67:1748:114843:28:28:72:548:581:12:Times:12:Times:parameters constant).  Figure D.1 below shows that the match is indeed optimized for 휃=1.2 and 
67:1749:114937:28:226:72:292:553:12:Times:12:Times:that it drops fast as 휃 departs from this value.

67:1755:115274:21:28:108:548:227:12:Times:12:Times:The  second  exercise  is  to  confirm  numerically  the  pattern  of  Figure  9,  namely  that high 
67:1756:115375:28:27:72:548:199:12:Times:12:Times:LTG  forecasts  are  on  average  revised  downwards,  even  conditional  on  positive  news, that  is, 
67:1757:115479:27:28:72:548:172:12:Times:12:Times:earnings that exceeded (distorted) expectations.  Figure D.2 below plots the equivalent of  Figure 
67:1758:115575:28:0:72:186:144:12:Times:12:Times:10 for our calibration.

68:1764:115887:22:27:108:548:432:12:Times:12:Times:In  the  model,  news  and  forecast  revisions  are  positively  correlated.    Crucially,  however, 
68:1765:115989:27:28:72:548:405:12:Times:12:Times:they  may  go  in  opposite  directions.    For  a  range  of  positive  surprises – namely,  realized  growth 
68:1766:116099:28:28:72:551:377:12:Times:12:Times:above  the  diagnostic  forecasts – forecasts  about  HLTG  firms  are  still  revised  downwards.  
68:1767:116198:28:28:72:548:349:12:Times:12:Times:Naturally,  for  sufficiently  large  positive  surprises  (larger  than 1.5휎휖,  in  our  calibration)  forecast 
68:1768:116311:28:35:72:332:321:12:Times:12:Times:revisions are positive.  The converse holds for LLTG.
