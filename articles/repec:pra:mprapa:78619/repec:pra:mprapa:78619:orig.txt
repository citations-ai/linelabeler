2:15:459:20:15:110:499:499:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Export performance in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is a source
2:16:534:15:14:110:499:484:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of regional development.  It also enables enterprises to enhance their com-
2:17:609:14:15:110:499:470:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:petitiveness and to support in long term their sustainability.  In light of its
2:18:688:15:14:110:499:455:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:importance,  the  export  performance  has  long  been  a  central  topic  in  the
2:19:770:14:15:110:499:441:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:literature in international marketing.  However, this concept reveals several
2:20:847:15:14:110:499:426:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:limitations  about  its  definition  or  its  measurement,  in  particular  the  tech-
2:21:933:14:14:110:499:412:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:nical  efficiency  aspect.   This  paper  contributes  to  provide  a  new  approach
2:22:1017:14:15:110:499:398:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:on the evaluation of the export technique.  In our context, an enterprise is
2:23:1093:15:14:110:499:383:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:regarded as technically efficient in the export if it processes its various re-
2:24:1172:14:15:110:499:369:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:sources and capacities in optimal manner into better export results.  In this
2:25:1249:15:14:110:499:354:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:investigation, we use a non parametric approach that is the data envelopment
2:26:1325:14:15:110:499:340:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:analysis (DEA) model.  Indeed, this method allows to separate the efficient
2:27:1400:15:14:110:499:325:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:to  the  inefficient  techniques  in  the  export  domain  by  aggregating  multiple
2:28:1484:14:21:110:261:311:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:inputs with multiple outputs.

3:32:1693:0:24:110:201:654:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:1. Introduction
3:33:1708:24:14:128:499:630:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Accordingly the increasing globalization and intensifying competition of
3:34:1780:14:15:110:499:616:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:markets,  export performance continuously becomes the crucial factor both
3:35:1853:15:14:110:499:601:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:for national and enterprises growth.  Furthermore, considering the strategic
3:36:1929:14:14:110:499:587:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:role played by SMEs in economies and their important unused potential in
3:37:2001:14:15:110:499:573:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:export , it appears essential to evaluate their performance on international
3:38:2077:15:14:110:499:558:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:markets. Despite the fact that the export performance has long been a central
3:39:2154:14:15:110:499:544:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:topic in the literature in international marketing (Sousa et al., 2008; Sousa,
3:40:2232:15:14:110:499:529:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:2004; Katsikeas et al., 2000), this concept reveals several limitations about its
3:41:2313:14:15:110:499:515:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:definition or its measurement, particularly in case of its efficiency dimension.
3:42:2393:15:14:110:499:500:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:In  literature,  export  performance  defined,  in  the  most  common  form,  as
3:43:2473:14:15:110:499:486:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the  output  of  firms  activities  in  export  market  (objective),  as  managerial
3:44:2557:15:14:110:499:471:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:satisfaction with export performance (subjective).  These measurements can
3:45:2631:14:14:110:499:457:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:be  also  called  output  or  workload,  report  how  many  units  of  export  were
3:46:2714:14:15:110:499:443:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:realized  or  how  much  of  an  activity  was  undertaken.   They  are  extremely
3:47:2796:15:14:110:499:428:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:limited in what they can say about the quality or efficiency of the export. The
3:48:2875:14:15:110:499:414:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:only message of workload measures is enterprise is busy in export! and cannot
3:49:2952:15:14:110:499:399:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:be enterprise is efficient in export.  In this work, we evaluate efficiency export
3:50:3034:14:15:110:499:385:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:that refers getting the most output (export) without using more resources
3:51:3107:15:14:110:290:370:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:and capacities (doing things right).
3:52:3143:14:15:128:499:356:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:In fact, to increase export at national and regional levels, theories of in-
3:53:3219:15:14:110:499:341:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:ternational trade suggest two initiatives:  1) push non-exporters to enter the
3:54:3297:14:14:110:499:327:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:export markets (self-selection effect) and 2) encourage exporting firms to ex-
3:55:3375:14:15:110:499:313:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:port more (learning-by-exporting) (Greenaway and Kneller, 2007; Wagner,
3:56:3446:15:14:110:499:298:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:2007).   A  signicant  number  of  theoretical  and  empirical  works  are  studied
3:57:3529:14:15:110:499:284:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:self-selection effect and then present innovation supporting and productiv-
3:58:3604:15:14:110:499:269:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:ity increasing as the key factors of the export market entry (Movahedi and
3:59:3678:14:15:110:499:255:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Gaussens, 2012, 2016).  However, the question of how export more does not
3:60:3751:15:14:110:499:240:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:be enough analyzed by leaning-by-exporting works.  However,  promote ex-
3:61:3823:14:15:110:499:226:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:porting enterprises to use all their capacity to export is a preoccupation of
3:62:3900:15:14:110:499:211:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:public authorities to balance the results of foreign trade.  If we recognize that
3:63:3981:14:14:110:499:197:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the expansion of exports depends for most of enterprise itself, it is reassuring
3:64:4061:14:15:110:499:183:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:that  they  have  mostly  many  means  to  improve  their  performance  in  for-
3:65:4141:15:14:110:499:168:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:eign markets.  Many enterprises are content to cream off the markets where
3:66:4215:14:15:110:499:154:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:they  have  entered,  instead  of  developing  them  further.   These  enterprises
3:67:4297:15:14:110:499:139:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:can significantly develop in foreign markets, by implementing a more ratio-
3:68:4372:14:0:110:499:125:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:nal and efficient their innovation, financial, human capital, and technological
4:69:4452:0:15:110:160:654:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:resources.
4:70:4462:15:14:128:499:639:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The purpose of this paper is to offers new conceptual, operational, and
4:71:4533:14:15:110:499:625:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:mythological  framework  to  export  performance  evaluation  and  to  build  a
4:72:4612:15:14:110:499:610:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:working tool for all actors involved in the conduct of international affairs of
4:73:4691:14:14:110:499:596:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:enterprises.  The diagnostic assess the strengths and weaknesses (efficiency)
4:74:4768:14:15:110:499:582:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of the exporting enterprise in export and suggest lines of corresponding de-
4:75:4844:15:14:110:499:567:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:velopment that will advance the positions already held in export markets.  In
4:76:4921:14:15:110:499:553:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:other words, is the company makes optimal use of its export potential in the
4:77:4997:15:14:110:499:538:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:realization of export?  and the use of what resources and capacities are to
4:78:5072:14:15:110:499:524:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:be optimized?  To this end, we use the (Data Envelopment Analysis) DEA
4:79:5142:15:14:110:229:509:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:method using financial.
4:80:5165:14:15:128:499:495:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The DEA method allows a quantitative evaluation of the performance of

4:88:5766:15:14:110:499:379:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the empirical analysis, we use the financial data of population of the SMEs
