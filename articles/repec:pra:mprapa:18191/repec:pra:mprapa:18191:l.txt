2:16:396:16:14:56:541:567:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:corresponding 18th  century AD, the present paper explores economic ideas of one of the greatest 
2:17:492:14:13:56:541:553:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Muslim personalities of the period, Muhammad b. Abd al-Wahhab (1115-1206/1703-1792), who is 
2:18:583:13:14:56:541:540:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:commonly known as revivalist and renovator of religious beliefs and practices. The paper discovers 
2:19:681:14:16:56:541:526:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:that he had deep insights in financial matters who managed the public finance of the first Saudi 
2:20:777:16:14:56:541:510:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:State.1 At the outset, to provide a background knowledge of the personality of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, 
2:21:873:14:14:56:541:496:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:the paper sheds light on time and environment in which he lived, his life and work, and his impact. 
2:22:972:14:14:56:541:482:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:The paper is an initiative that aims to fillip research into unexplored areas. There is need to carry 
2:23:1073:14:34:56:487:468:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:out thorough research into economic ideas of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab and his contemporaries.

2:25:1159:41:41:56:176:393:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:C:Time and Environment
2:26:1179:41:14:56:541:352:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab was born in the centre of the Najd at al-Uyaynah, an oasis which 
2:27:1271:14:14:56:541:338:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:at that time was enjoying some prosperity. It was the time when the Islamic World had reached its 
2:28:1368:14:14:56:541:324:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:extreme decline, degradation and utter fall. The atmosphere was very gloomy and darkness had 
2:29:1460:14:14:56:541:310:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:covered all its regions. Moral degradation and corruption was rampant everywhere. Especially the 
2:30:1556:14:13:56:541:296:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:condition of the Arabian Peninsula was highly terrible. Ibn Bishr (1391 AH, pp. 19-20) presents the 
2:31:1655:13:14:56:541:283:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:sad picture of Arabian Peninsula. There was no law and order, economy was spoiled, opium and 
2:32:1747:14:14:56:541:269:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:wine were common and religiosity deplorable. Pagan innovations and superstitions cropped up and 
2:33:1842:14:14:56:541:255:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:vastly mushroomed. The people went back to their old practices of idolatry. They started paying 
2:34:1937:14:14:56:541:241:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:homage to shrines and graves, so much so that they even directed their devotional prayers and 
2:35:2030:14:16:56:541:227:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:supplications   towards   the   graves   to   the   exclusion   of   Allah.   They   gave   precedence   to   the 
2:36:2143:16:13:56:538:211:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:philosophical views and taqlid (blind following) over the Sunnah.2 According to Natana DeLong-
2:37:2237:13:14:56:541:198:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Bas (1994 , p. 8), ‘one of the major signs of the deterioration of Islam was the adoption of rituals 
2:38:2337:14:14:56:541:184:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:and beliefs from other religions, like praying to saints and believing that saints could grant blessings 
2:39:2441:14:14:56:541:170:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:or perform miracles. In some cases, people had adopted superstitious practices, like spitting in a 
2:40:2539:14:14:56:541:156:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:particular way or wearing charms to ward off evil spirits’. Thus, pure and austere monotheism 
2:41:2632:14:13:56:541:142:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:(tawhid) had become corrupted with the growing superstition and mysticism. The mosques stood 
2:42:2724:13:14:56:541:129:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:empty,   unfrequented   and   even   deserted.   The   ignorant   multitude   decorated   amulet,   charms   and 
2:43:2836:14:44:56:415:115:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:rosaries listened to and blindly followed foul saints and ecstatic dervishes. 
2:44:2914:44:0:56:541:71:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:In the early 18th century the Najd was infested with corrupt beliefs and religious practices repugnant 
3:45:3016:0:14:56:541:774:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:to the fundamentals of the True Religion. For example: In Jubailah, people visited the grave of Zayd 
3:46:3116:14:14:56:541:760:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:b. al- Khattab and sought relief for their needs. In Manfuhah, people sought mediation through a 
3:47:3212:14:14:56:541:746:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:male palm-tree believing that a spinster, who pays a visit to it, soon gets married. In Dar`iyah there 
3:48:3314:14:14:56:541:732:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:was a cave which people frequented. Ibn Bishr (1391 AH, pp. 22-23). The same story was prevalent 
3:49:3410:14:42:56:482:718:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:in other parts of Arabia. These conditions were demanding for a reformer and renovator. 
3:50:3498:42:41:56:174:676:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f7:C:          Life and Works
3:51:3512:41:14:56:541:635:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f8:B:Early life and education. Shaykh Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Wahhab b. Sulayman al-Tamimi belonged 
3:52:3602:14:13:56:541:621:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:to a family which had produced several scholars of Hanbali school of jurisprudence. His grand 
3:53:3695:13:14:56:541:608:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:father,   Sulayman   b.   Muhmmad   had   been  mufti  of   the   Najd.   His   father   Abd   al-Wahhab   (d. 
3:54:3805:14:14:56:541:594:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:1153/1740) was qadi at Uyaynah. Ibn Abd al-Wahhab’s education began under his learned father’s 
3:55:3899:14:14:56:541:580:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:guidance. He studied the Hanbali jurisprudence, tafsir and hadith from him. He performed hajj in 
3:56:3995:14:14:56:541:566:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:1128/1715 and stayed there about four years to return in 1132/1719. At that time Shaykh Abdullah 
3:57:4091:14:13:56:541:552:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:bin Ibrahim b. Saif al-Najdi was chief of the scholars of Madinah. Shaykh Muhammad acquired a 
3:58:4184:13:14:56:541:539:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:good deal of knowledge from him. Al-Najdi introduced him to another great scholar of Madinah 
3:59:4276:14:41:56:402:525:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Muhammad Hayat al-Sindi (d. 1165/1751) (Ibn Bishr, 1391 AH, p. 21). 
3:60:4344:41:14:56:541:484:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Their strong stand on  tawhid  (unicity of Allah) and their deep concern over false beliefs and evil 
3:61:4444:14:14:56:541:470:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:deeds brought about a strong bond between the Shaykh and his teachers. During this time he came 
3:62:4539:14:14:56:541:456:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:to know and benefited from the knowledge of other scholars such as Ali Afendi Daghistani, Isma`il 
3:63:4636:14:14:56:541:442:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:al-`Ajluni and others. Then he moved on to Najd and Basrah. He wanted to travel to Syria for the 
3:64:4732:14:13:56:541:428:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:purpose of acquiring further knowledge but due to lack of resources, he had to give up the idea (Ibn 
3:65:4832:13:14:56:541:415:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Bishr, 1391 AH, vol.1, p. 21). He stayed for a long time in Basrah, where he pursued his studies 
3:66:4928:14:14:56:541:401:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:under a number of renowned scholars, among whom Shaykh Muhammad al-Majmu`i was most 
3:67:5011:14:41:56:247:387:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:prominent (Ibn Bishr, 1391 AH, p. 21). 
3:68:5050:41:14:56:538:346:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f9:C:Reformative endeavors.  During his stay in Basrah, he authored his most famous work  Kitab al-
3:69:5144:14:14:56:541:332:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f8:B:Tawhid (Essays on the Unicity of Allah or The Book of Monotheism). The supporters of falsehood 
3:70:5238:14:14:56:537:318:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:defamed,   tortured   and   turned   him   out   of   Basrah.  They   also   persecuted   his   teacher   Shaykh   al-
3:71:5356:14:13:56:541:304:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Majmu`i. After leaving Basrah he came to the town al-Zubayr, then to al-Ahsa, and then finally to 
3:72:5453:13:14:56:541:291:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Huraymila. In all these places he faced much suffering at the hands of the wicked persons who did 
3:73:5550:14:14:56:541:277:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:not like his enjoining the good and forbidding the evil. So he decided to move to Uyaynah, which 
3:74:5646:14:14:56:541:263:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:was then governed by Uthman Ibn Muhammad b. Muammar. Uthman welcomed the Shaykh with 
3:75:5730:14:14:56:541:249:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:hospitality and promised him all support and help in calling people to the true and pure Islam (ibid. 
3:76:5831:14:41:56:90:235:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:p. 22). 
3:77:5839:41:14:56:541:194:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:The Shaykh urged the people to return to the worship of Allah only and a strict adherence to the 
3:78:5935:14:13:56:541:180:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Sunnah of the Prophet. The Shaykh managed to cut down trees that were being worshipped in the 
3:79:6028:13:14:56:541:167:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:area. He succeeded with the help of Uthman, in bringing down the dome over the grave of Zayd b. 
3:80:6123:14:14:56:541:153:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:al-Khattab.   He   also   carried   out   the   prescribed   punishment   for   adultery   on   a   woman   who   had 
3:81:6240:14:41:56:212:139:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:confessed to it (ibid. pp. 22, 23).
3:82:6275:41:14:56:541:98:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f8:B:Use of Economic weapon against the Shaykh. Sulayman b. Muhammad of the Shi'ite tribe Banu 
3:83:6363:14:14:56:541:84:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Khalid,   the   chief   of   al-Ahsa   and   Qatif,   became   afraid   of   the   Shaykh’s   growing   influence   and 
3:84:6482:14:0:56:541:70:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:number of supporters.  He used the economic weapon to put an end to the Shaykh’s reformation 
4:85:6574:0:42:56:111:774:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:endeavors. 
4:86:6585:42:13:56:541:732:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Uthman   b.   Muhammad   b.   Muammar,   the   ruler   of   Uyaynah   in   whose   region   the   Shaykh   was 
4:87:6695:13:42:56:494:719:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:carrying on his reforms, had many economic connections with the ruler of al-Ahsa such as:
4:88:6784:42:13:219:538:677:10:Symbol:12:g_d0_f8:A:•    He used to draw an annual stipend from the treasury of al-Ahsa
4:89:6847:13:20:74:326:664:10:Symbol:12:g_d0_f8:A:•    He enjoyed trading priority in the port of al-Ahsa
4:90:6898:20:20:74:449:644:10:Symbol:12:g_d0_f8:A:•    He enjoyed exception from taxes on his agriculture estates in al-Ahsa, and 
4:91:6974:20:41:74:418:624:10:Symbol:12:g_d0_f8:A:•    His traders of Uyaynah used to receive many concessions in al-Ahsa
4:92:7041:41:14:56:541:583:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Using his influence Sulayman, the chief of al-Ahsa and Qatif, pressurized the  amir  of Uyaynah, 
4:93:7137:14:14:56:541:569:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Uthman   b.   Mu`ammar   to   kill   the   Shaykh   or   handover   him.   Otherwise   he   would   stop   all 
4:94:7247:14:14:56:541:555:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:concessions,   and   attack   him.   However,   Uthman   who   could   not   refuse   his   demand   advised   the 
4:95:7361:14:41:56:436:541:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Shaykh to leave Uyaynah clandestinely. Thus, he left for Dar`iyah (ibid. p. 23).
4:96:7441:41:14:56:541:500:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f8:B:In Dar`iyah. The Shaykh left the town on foot escorted by a horseman through the desert in the 
4:97:7535:14:13:56:538:486:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:scorching sun, with only the thought of Allah, until he reached Dar`iyah as the guest of Abd al-
4:98:7631:13:14:56:541:473:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Rahman b. Suwaylim, who introduced him to most of the prominent people of Dar`iyah. They 
4:99:7719:14:14:56:541:459:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:visited him in secret and he explained to them the real meaning and the significance of tawhid. Two 
4:100:7818:14:14:56:541:445:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:brothers of Amir Muhammad b. Saud (d. 1178/1765), the chief of Dar`iyah, Mashari and Thunayyan 
4:101:7912:14:14:56:541:431:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:became supporters of the Shaykh. They convinced their brother Muhammad to see the Shaykh and 
4:102:8004:14:13:56:541:417:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:listen to his call. It is reported that the wife of Muhammad b. Sa`ud, who was a pious and wise lady, 
4:103:8105:13:42:56:479:404:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:played important role in persuasion of her husband to welcome the Shaykh (Ibid. p. 24).
4:104:8192:42:13:56:541:362:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f9:B:Prince Muhammad accepted the suggestion and met the Shaykh. He invited the  amir  to  tawhid

4:106:8382:14:14:56:541:335:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:attention of the Prince to the polytheistic practices and notions prevalent among the people of the 
4:107:8481:14:14:56:541:321:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Najd. He wished that the Prince should assume leadership of the Muslims. The prince acceded to 
4:108:8575:14:41:56:459:307:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:the wish of the Shaykh and offered him all help and assistance to carry out his task. 
4:109:8661:41:41:56:394:266:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:However, amir Muhammad b. Saud put two conditions to the Shaykh:
4:110:8725:41:14:232:538:225:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:1. When his movements would spread, he should not leave him.
4:111:8784:14:41:74:432:211:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:2. He collected taxes on fruits from his territory that he should not oppose.
4:112:8860:41:14:56:541:170:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:The Shaykh said: “As for the first condition is concerned, I vow, my blood will be with yours; my 
4:113:8957:14:14:56:541:156:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:destruction will be with your destruction. As for the second condition is concerned, I hope the 
4:114:9052:14:14:56:541:142:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f9:B:Almighty Allah will bestow upon you conquest and compensate you with spoils of war, and zakah 
4:115:9145:14:13:56:541:128:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:which will be much better than what you are exacting from them” (Ibid. p. 25. Amir Muhammad 
4:116:9236:13:42:56:281:115:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:convincingly accepted the Shaykh’s assurance.
4:117:9281:42:13:56:541:73:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:The   allegiance   that   took   place   in   the   year   1157/1744   between   the   two   Muhammads   –   Shaykh 
4:118:9396:13:0:56:541:60:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Muhammad b. Abd al-Wahhab and amir Muhammad b. Saud proved turning point in the history of 
5:119:9486:0:14:56:541:774:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Arabian peninsula. They integrated and strengthened each other. According to Lothrop Stoddard 
5:120:9579:14:14:56:541:760:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:(1925, p. 28), ‘Saud always considered himself responsible to public opinion and never encroached 
5:121:9676:14:16:56:541:746:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:upon the legitimate freedom of his subjects. His government though stern, was able and just. The 
5:122:9772:16:14:56:541:730:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Wahhabi3  judges were competent and honest. Robbery became almost unknown, so well was the 
5:123:9862:14:41:56:183:716:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:public peace maintained’. 
5:124:9888:41:14:56:541:675:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:The Shaykh’s movement passed through four stages – first in Basrah, second in al-Ahsa and third in 
5:125:9986:14:14:56:541:661:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Huraymila, and fourth in al-Dar`iyah (Ibid. p. 21). Before he passed away in 1206/1792, he saw the 
5:126:10084:14:41:56:407:647:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:success of his movement and its extension in major part of the peninsula.
5:127:10157:41:14:56:541:606:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:In the opinion of al-Faruqi (1994, p. xvii), in the movement of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, ‘what was 
5:128:10249:14:13:56:541:592:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:indeed extraordinary was the coincidence of the `alim and the prince’. ‘The movement was hatched 
5:129:10345:13:14:56:541:579:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:and grew to full maturity before Napoleon landed in Egypt, Dar`iyah became the greatest capital of 
5:130:10443:14:41:56:400:565:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Islamic modernism without undergoing any modernist influence’ (ibid).
5:131:10512:41:14:56:541:524:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:At  the  time  when   the  Shaykh   migrated   to   Dar`iyah,   the  number   of   houses   there  did   not  cross 
5:132:10627:14:14:56:541:510:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:seventy.   Their   economy   was   simple   and   subsistence   level.   Trading   was   very   scarce   and   for 
5:133:10741:14:14:56:541:496:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:necessities of life only (al-Uqayli, p. 69). After his arrival, the number of inhabitants increased and 
5:134:10844:14:14:56:541:482:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:so   the   economic   activities.   Extensive   farming,   reclamation   of   land,   and   plantation   were   seen 
5:135:10960:14:13:56:541:468:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:everywhere. Commercial activities also expanded. With the establishment of peace and security 
5:136:11053:13:42:56:352:455:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:domestic trade received a boost. Literacy enhanced (ibid, 70).

5:138:11206:13:14:56:538:400:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:The oneness of God (Tawhid) was the basic point of call for return to original Islam (Salafiyah) (al-

5:140:11405:14:14:56:541:372:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:their   religious   consciousness,   had   been   infiltrated   with   Sufi   views   and   practices   compromising 
5:141:11521:14:14:56:541:358:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f8:B:tawhid.  A  reversal  of   the  tide  of   history,   ....  would   not  be  possible  without  reform  of   popular 
5:142:11637:14:13:56:541:344:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Muslim religiosity’ (al-Faruqi, 1994, p. xvi). Shaykh Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab focused on  tawhid  and 
5:143:11733:13:14:56:541:331:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:fought   innovations   and   deviations   in   religion,   which   prevailed   in   Arabia.   He   considered   his 
5:144:11848:14:14:56:541:317:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:movement an effort to purify Islam by returning Muslims to the original principles of Islam, the 
5:145:11944:14:14:56:541:303:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Qur`an   and  the  Sunnah,   and  rejecting   all un-Islamic  beliefs  and   practices.  Natana  DeLong-Bas 
5:146:12051:14:14:56:541:289:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:(1994 , p. 8) observes: ‘the major distinctive doctrine of Islam is belief in absolute monotheism 
5:147:12148:14:13:56:541:275:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:(tawhid). ... It was for this reason that the revival and reform movements of the eighteenth century 
5:148:12248:13:14:56:541:262:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:adamantly insisted that a "return" to monotheism was the necessary first step in reforming Islam. 
5:149:12345:14:14:56:541:248:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:This meant getting rid of foreign and superstitious beliefs and practices. Wahhabism shared this

5:151:12553:14:41:56:107:220:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:(tawhid)’. 
5:152:12564:41:14:56:541:179:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Ibn Abd al-Wahhab was right in diagnosis of the basic evil of his society and the cure. It was 
5:153:12658:14:14:56:538:165:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:through the faith in  tawhid  that the Prophet Muhammad, be peace upon him, used to rectify pre-
5:154:12754:14:13:56:541:151:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Islamic ignorance (jahiliyah), and now his follower Muhammad b. Abd al-Wahhab also used the 
5:155:12845:13:14:56:541:138:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:same to correct the corrupt society of his time. His fight against the other evils has already been 
5:156:12944:14:41:56:120:124:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:noted above. 
5:157:12957:41:14:56:541:83:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f8:B:Opposition: Ibn Abd al-Wahhab did not face opposition from commoners and ignorant people only. 
5:158:13051:14:0:56:541:69:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Certain so-called scholars also tried to malign his reform through their works. 'Abd al-Wahhab ibn 
6:159:13149:0:14:56:538:774:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Ahamad Barakat al-Shafe'i al-Azhari al-Tantawi from Egypt, Zayni Dahlan from Makkah, 'Ali al-

6:161:13340:14:14:56:541:746:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:These   oppositions   were   based   on   ignorance,   rivalry,   and   suspicions.   A   major   factor   was 
6:162:13450:14:14:56:541:732:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:misunderstanding created by defaming forces motivated by political objectives. Even his brother 
6:163:13545:14:13:56:541:718:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Sulaiman and his father, 'Abd al-Wahhab, had initially repudiated him for his ideas.  Eventually a 
6:164:13643:13:14:56:541:705:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:good   majority   of   his   people   accepted   his   views.   His   father   and   brother   Sulaiman   too   were 
6:165:13759:14:41:56:246:691:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:convinced after prolonged discussions. 
6:166:13798:41:14:56:541:650:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f8:B:Works. Kitab al-Tawhid  is the most important work of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab. It is, no doubt, ‘the 
6:167:13891:14:14:56:541:636:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:ideational   spearhead’  of   his   mighty  movement   (al-Faruqi,   1994,   p.   xv).  This   movement  spread 
6:168:14002:14:41:56:345:622:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:within a century like wildfire throughout the Muslim World.
6:169:14061:41:14:56:541:581:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:There is no doubt that  tawhid  is the most basic and key concept in Islam. According to Siddiqi 
6:170:14157:14:14:56:541:567:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:(1980, p. 17), ‘It sums up the Islamic way of life and presents, in a nutshell, the essence of the 
6:171:14255:14:14:56:541:553:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Islamic civilization.’ He rightly considers ‘a lapse from tawhid’ the main cause behind the Muslims’ 
6:172:14355:14:13:56:541:539:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:decline – ‘their loss of political power, of their economic backwardness, intellectual stagnation, and 
6:173:14457:13:42:56:185:526:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:social degeneration’ (ibid).
6:174:14485:42:13:56:541:484:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Since Kitab al-Tawhid ‘was meant to be an instrument for reform, the author was more concerned to

7:207:16671:14:14:56:541:552:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f9:B:were combined with an elaborate programme of mass education and a recreation against  taqlid 
7:208:16763:14:41:56:345:538:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:(blind following) broadened along more conservative lines’.
7:209:16822:41:14:56:541:497:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:In spite of the ignoble and false propaganda mounted by his adversaries against the reformatory 
7:210:16917:14:14:56:541:483:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f9:B:movement of Shaykh Muhammad b. Abd al-Wahhab and the derogatory use of the word `Wahhabi’ 
7:211:17006:14:16:56:541:469:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:for the movement and its followers, his impact on the modern development of Muslim mind has 
7:212:17097:16:14:56:541:453:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:been profound. This has been admitted by a number of 20th  century intellectuals. Henri Laoust 
7:213:17191:14:13:56:541:439:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:(1971, p. 679) observes “Although Muhammad b. Abd al-Wahhab’s doctrine was condemned or 
7:214:17278:13:14:56:541:426:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:rejected   by   an   important   section   of   Muslim   opinion,   it   was   nevertheless   to   make   a   powerful 
7:215:17396:14:14:56:541:412:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:contribution not only to a more profound Islamization of Arabia, but also to a general renewal of the 
7:216:17497:14:14:56:541:398:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Islamic conscience immediately before the modern period of intrusion from the West”. Taha Husayn 
7:217:17593:14:14:56:541:384:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:(d.   1973)   says   that   the   movement   of   Ibn  Abd   al-Wahhab   has   influenced   not  only  the  Arabian 
7:218:17708:14:13:56:541:370:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Peninsula, but also its relation with European nations (Sa`id, 1963, p. 201). To him, his movement 
7:219:17806:13:14:56:541:357:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:was new and old at the same time. It was new as compared to his time but it was the same old call 
7:220:17903:14:14:56:541:343:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:which   was   given   by   the   Prophet   Muhammad   (p.b.u.h).   It   had   great   impact   on   literary   and 
7:221:18017:14:41:56:269:329:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:intellectual life of Arabs (ibid. pp. 202-203).
7:222:18064:41:14:56:541:288:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Stressing   upon   the   influence   of   Ibn  Abd   al-Wahhab   on   modern   generation,   our   contemporary 
7:223:18175:14:14:56:541:274:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:scholar   DeLong-Bas   (2004)   remarks:   “Many   of   the   themes   he   discussed   in   his   writings   are 
7:224:18288:14:14:56:541:260:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:hallmarks of the 18th century Islamic thought. These include his emphasis on a return to the Qur'an 
7:225:18387:14:13:56:541:246:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:and hadith, the eradication of erroneous popular religious practices, like tomb and saint veneration, 
7:226:18488:13:14:56:541:233:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:rejection of  taqlid  (blind following) in favor of  ijtihad  (independent reasoning), authentication of 
7:227:18592:14:14:56:541:219:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f8:B:hadith  (prophetic   traditions)   on   the   basis   of   their   content,   rather   than   their  asnad  (chains   of 
7:228:18712:14:14:56:541:205:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:transmission), focus on the intent behind actions, rather than ritual perfection”. She further says: "It 
7:229:18816:14:14:56:541:191:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:would  be more appropriate to  look  at  early 20th  century reformist  movements, particularly  the 
7:230:18916:14:13:56:541:177:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Salafiyya movement in Egypt led by Muhammad Abduh and Rashid Rida, for Sheikh Muhammad's 
7:231:19004:13:14:56:541:164:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:intellectual influence. Sheikh Muhammad's legal thought is also apparent in many contemporary 
7:232:19097:14:41:56:345:150:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:legal reforms, ironically those pertaining to women gender."
7:233:19157:41:14:56:541:109:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Several  of  the sons  and  students  of  Ibn  Abd  al-Wahhab   carried   on  his  mission.  His  four  sons, 
7:234:19266:14:14:56:541:95:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Husayn, Ali, Abd-Allah and Ibrahim were great scholars and authors who continued his mission 
7:235:19358:14:14:56:541:81:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:after him (al-Nadwi, 1984, p. 182). His movement resulted into development of human resources 
7:236:19451:14:0:56:541:67:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:for the young Saudi state. For example: Some for the students who benefited from his knowledge 
8:237:19545:0:42:56:340:774:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:and rose to the position of Qadis and Muftis are as follows:
8:238:19605:42:13:56:541:732:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Shaykh Abd al Aziz b. Abdullah al-Nasim, a Judge in the territory of al-Washm, Shaykh Sa`id b. 
8:239:19699:13:14:56:541:719:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Hijji, a Judge of Hawtah of Bani Tamim, Shaykh Abd al-Rahman b. Nami, who became Judge of 
8:240:19788:14:14:56:541:705:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Uyaynah, and Shaykh Ahmad b. Rashid al-Urayni the Qadi of Sudair. The most notable student was 
8:241:19882:14:14:56:541:691:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Shaykh Muhammad bin Ibrahim bin Abd al-Latif b. Abd al-Rahman b. Hassan who was the grand 
8:242:19971:14:41:56:168:677:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Mufti of Saudi Arabia. 
8:243:19994:41:14:56:541:636:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Some of the authors think that eighteenth century reformative movements led by Shah Wali-Allah 
8:244:20088:14:14:56:541:622:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:al-Dihlawi   in   India   and   Shehu   Uthman   Dan   Fodio   in   the  West  Africa   were   influenced   by   the 
8:245:20204:14:13:56:541:608:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Movement of Shaykh  Muhammad b. Abd al-Wahhab. But this is not correct. When  al-Dihlawi 
8:246:20292:13:14:56:541:595:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:visited Hijaz in the year 1143 AH, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab was engaged in Basrah. His movement was 
8:247:20384:14:16:56:541:581:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:not stabilized even in the areas of al-Najd. Uthman Dan Fodio’s any visit of Arabia is not reported 
8:248:20483:16:14:56:541:565:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:in the sources dealing with his life and work.4  However, he was trained by some teachers who had 
8:249:20579:14:14:56:541:551:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:been in the Holy places of Islam. But they were too seniors to be aware of and affected by the 
8:250:20673:14:14:56:541:537:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:movement of Shaykh Muhammad b. Abd al-Wahhab. In fact, all these reformers were influenced by 
8:251:20766:14:13:56:541:523:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:the same original sources, the Qur’an and the Sunnah and the intellectual and religious network of 
8:252:20864:13:42:56:214:510:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Madinah, the city of the Prophet.
8:253:20897:42:42:56:94:468:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:          
8:254:20897:42:42:56:175:426:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f7:C:          Economic Ideas
8:255:20911:42:13:56:541:384:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Muhammad b. Abd al-Wahhab was fully aware of the importance of economic factor in man’s life. 
8:256:21004:13:14:56:541:371:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:It was lack of economic support that he had to drop his plan of pursuing education in Syria (Ibn 
8:257:21100:14:14:56:541:357:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Bishr, 1391 AH, p. 21). He also realized that it was economic dependence of Ibn Mu`ammar upon 
8:258:21193:14:14:56:541:343:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:al-Khalidi that the former was forced to expel Ibn Abd al-Wahhab from Huraymila (ibid. p. 23). 
8:259:21287:14:14:56:541:329:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Again, it was necessity of economic means to perform ones religious and social obligations that he 
8:260:21385:14:13:56:541:315:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:paid attention to revival and reclamation of lands and development of agriculture and trade after 
8:261:21482:13:14:56:541:302:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:reaching Dar`iyah (Uqayli, p.70). Paying homage to the Shaykh's efforts to promote the economy of 
8:262:21579:14:14:56:541:288:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:his people, Fazlur-Rahman (1970, p. 638) says: ‘The Wahhabis, however, have done good work by 
8:263:21672:14:14:56:541:274:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:bringing into relief the principles of Islamic egalitarianism and co-operation, and actually founded 
8:264:21772:14:41:56:185:260:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:cooperative farm villages’.
8:265:21799:41:14:56:541:219:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:It is reported that some of his followers used to work in night to attend his lectures in the day. Most 
8:266:21902:14:14:56:541:205:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:probably this might have been on his advice and he would not like idleness. As the job opportunities 
8:267:22002:14:13:56:541:191:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:were not enough in Dar`iyah, he used to help his poor followers financially, those who could not get 
8:268:22102:13:14:56:541:178:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:a job or unable to work, through borrowing from others. He repaid such loans from the booty 
8:269:22193:14:14:56:541:164:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:obtained from the conquest of Riyadh (Ibn Bishr, 1: 22, 25). This shows that he favours the idea of 
8:270:22292:14:41:56:336:150:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:unemployment allowance provided that it is not voluntary.
8:271:22349:41:14:56:541:109:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Ibn Abd al-Wahhab was a man of action and conviction. He called people to return to the Qur’an 
8:272:22443:14:14:56:541:95:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:and the Sunnah. These two sources contain a number of economic principles and teachings. They 
8:273:22536:14:14:56:541:81:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:were sufficient to solve the simple problems facing the economy of the Najd region, the center of 
8:274:22633:14:0:56:541:67:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:his reformative endeavors. Thus, he did not need to deal with economic ideas in his works. By his 
9:275:22730:0:14:56:541:774:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:action he practically showed how to solve economic problems of his society. When Ibn Saud asked 
9:276:22825:14:14:56:541:760:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:him at the  time  of  bay`ah,  not to  object  and  oppose  the taxes  he would  collect  from the  fruit 
9:277:22930:14:14:56:541:746:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:products of his territory, the Shaykh’s answer was: “I hope the Almighty Allah will bestow upon 
9:278:23025:14:16:56:541:732:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:you conquest and compensate you through war booty, and  zakah  which will be much better than 
9:279:23118:16:14:56:540:716:12:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:what you exact from them (al-Uqayli, 1984, pp. 67-68). Clearly, this shows that like Ibn Taymiyah5 
9:280:23216:14:13:56:541:702:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:he believed that if non-Shar`iah taxes are cancelled, the Shar`iah taxes will be enough to take care 
9:281:23316:13:14:56:541:689:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:of the genuine public expenditure of the state. By his administration of public revenue he practically 
9:282:23418:14:14:56:541:675:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:proved and showed how Shari’ah-sanctioned sources could take care of the need of the government 
9:283:23513:14:41:56:114:661:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:and people. 
9:284:23525:41:14:56:541:620:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:The historian Ibn Bishr (1391 AH, 1: 27) states: ‘the fifth parts (booty), zakah and whatever minor 
9:285:23624:14:14:56:541:606:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:or major items were brought to al-Dar`iyah, they were handed over to the Shaykh who disposed 
9:286:23716:14:14:56:541:592:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:them as he saw them fit. No one, even amir Abd al-Aziz (d. 1215/1801), took anything without his 
9:287:23812:14:13:56:541:578:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:permission. But after Riyadh was conquered, the Shaykh handed over all these matters to Abd al- 
9:288:23907:13:14:56:541:565:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Aziz’. Through a report of Ibn Ghannam, al-Uthaymin (1979. p. 71) infers that the administration of 
9:289:24006:14:14:56:541:551:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:public finance was entrusted to the Shaykh up to the end of his life. Thus, he might be rightly called 
9:290:24108:14:14:56:541:537:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:the   first   finance   administrator   of   the   first   Saudi  state.   It   is   not   known   what   the   budget   of   the 
9:291:24237:14:14:56:541:523:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:government at that time was. Data of some later years are reported by al-Riki (2005, p. 272) as: 
9:292:24333:14:13:56:541:509:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:during early period of Saudi rule, the authorities collected each year from the subject cash and kind 
9:293:24434:13:14:56:541:496:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:in the name of zakah. People of Najd paid 400,000 Riyals. People living in the direction of Syria, 
9:294:24532:14:14:56:541:482:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Yemen Tihamah, and Oman paid annually about 500,000 Riyals. Their income from al-Ahsa was 
9:295:24621:14:14:56:541:468:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:400,000 Riyals, from Qatif 200,000 Riyals, from Bahrain 400,000 Riyal from the Bedouins of Hijaz 
9:296:24717:14:14:56:538:454:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:and   surrounding   areas   annually   200,000   Riyal   and   the   annual   income   generated   from   Ras   al-
9:297:24832:14:13:56:541:440:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Khimah in the year was 120,000 Riyal from booty excluding gifts. Since a number of wars were 
9:298:24924:13:14:56:541:427:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:fought and won, spoil of war was also an important source of public income. Gifts presented to 
9:299:25018:14:41:56:322:413:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:government officials were deposited in the bayt al-mal.
9:300:25073:41:14:56:541:372:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Zakah collected from the cities of Oman, which were under the Saudi rule, is estimated to 150,000 
9:301:25170:14:14:56:541:358:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Riyal excluding the salaries and government awqaf dedicated to the military. Saud family had some 
9:302:25267:14:14:56:541:344:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:other sources of income which were not regular, such as gifts from kings, spoils of war and their 
9:303:25364:14:15:56:541:330:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:own properties in Najd. From al-Ahsa such incomes reached to an annual amount of 300,000 Riyals 
9:304:25459:15:15:56:541:315:12:g_d0_f8:13:g_d0_f8:B:(ibid.). It seems that the Shaykh did not permit any tax except zakah which he collected from 
9:305:25551:15:14:56:541:300:13:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:both hidden and open assets. The historian al-Riki (2005, p. 308) writes: "He (Ibn Abd al-Wahhab) 
9:306:25648:14:13:56:541:286:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:made it obligatory for people to pay zakah from their non-apparent assets that can easily be hidden 
9:307:25747:13:18:56:541:273:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:away by the owner such as money and merchandise to imam, that is, the ruler of Muslims, and he 
9:308:25841:18:14:56:541:255:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:will distribute it among its beneficiaries".6 Perhaps Ibn Abd al-Wahhab did not mention this in his 
9:309:25940:14:13:56:541:241:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:books. It is possible that al-Riki has come to know this from from the practice of Muhammad b. 
9:310:26034:13:14:56:541:228:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Abd al-Wahhab and the history of the period or some other reports. It may be noted that what the 
9:311:26130:14:14:56:541:214:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Shaykh did was the original practice of early rightly guided caliphs. When wealth and prosperity 
9:312:26226:14:17:56:541:200:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:increased it was third Caliph Uthman b. Affan who allowed the zakah payers to disburse the zakah 
9:313:26322:17:14:56:541:183:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:of non-apparent assets themselves.7 Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's action in this regard is one more example 
9:314:26419:14:41:56:336:169:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:of his endeavor to return to the original practices of Islam.
9:315:26480:41:14:56:541:128:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Out of various economic institutions of Islam, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab especially paid attention to waqf, 
9:316:26579:14:14:56:541:114:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:as it was misused by some persons, so he thought to present the correct Islamic position regarding 
9:317:26677:14:14:56:541:100:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:the waqf. He notes three stands on waqf creation: A waqf created for poor and down trodden with 
9:318:26772:14:14:56:541:86:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:good intention to win the pleasure of Allah in which his inheritors are not included. This kind of 
9:319:26870:14:0:56:541:72:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f8:B:waqf is valid to majority of jurists but Qadi Shurayh and scholars from Kufah reject it which is the 
10:320:26970:0:14:56:541:774:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:second stand. A third stand is to create waqf at the cost of inheritors, apparently for the pleasure of 
10:321:27073:14:14:56:541:760:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Allah   but   intentionally   to   dispose   the   property   arbitrarily,   depriving   some   of   inheritors   and 
10:322:27190:14:14:56:541:746:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:rewarding more to some others. Although some muftis consider it valid, in his opinion it is a corrupt 
10:323:27291:14:14:56:541:732:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:practice, and an interferences in the inheritance system provided in the Qur’an. He supports his 
10:324:27387:14:13:56:541:718:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:stand with the primary sources of Islam – the Qur’an and Sunnah – that shows his vast knowledge 
10:325:27482:13:42:56:381:705:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:of these sources and power to infer rules (Sa`id, 1963, pp. 96-104). 
10:326:27551:42:13:56:541:663:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Dallal (1993, p. 348) is correct when he says that ‘Ibn Abd al-Wahhab even distinguishes between 
10:327:27647:13:14:56:541:650:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:what may be termed as injustice because of social and economic inequities and creedal injustice 
10:328:27742:14:14:56:541:636:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:(zlum al-amwal  and  zulm al-shirk)’. But he is not correct when he says that ‘Wahhabi thought is 
10:329:27839:14:14:56:541:622:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:focused on the second kind, whereas the first is tolerable as long as it is accompanied by tawhid’ 
10:330:27937:14:41:56:89:608:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:(ibid.).
10:331:27945:41:14:56:541:567:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:As an administrator of public finance the Shaykh had to manage the public expenditure as well. In 
10:332:28042:14:14:56:541:553:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:addition to expenditure on maintenance of armed forces, and stipend on deserving people, he must 
10:333:28138:14:13:56:541:539:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:have included the development of the economy as a whole, because this was inevitable in that 
10:334:28230:13:14:56:541:526:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:particular situation. However, sources are silent about the details of his scheme of expenditure. 
10:335:28327:14:14:56:541:512:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Most   probably   he   had   adopted   the   policy   of   spending   on   various   heads   according   to   their 
10:336:28442:14:41:56:266:498:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:importance in those existing circumstances.
10:337:28485:41:14:56:541:457:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Concept like public interest has great implications in economic decision making. The Shaykh has 
10:338:28580:14:14:56:538:443:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:dealt it extensively. While analyzing his methodology for interpreting Islamic law, Natana DeLong-
10:339:28678:14:14:56:541:429:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Bas (2004) highlighted his attention to concepts like maslahah (public interest) in order to interpret 
10:340:28780:14:13:56:541:415:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:law for the benefit of society. She remarks: “He gives great attention to the issues of social justice 
10:341:28882:13:14:56:541:402:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:and social welfare" (ibid). She has devoted two chapters of her thesis to the most controversial 
10:342:28978:14:14:56:541:388:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:issues of his writings for Westerners - his treatment of women and gender and an analysis of his 
10:343:29074:14:41:56:140:374:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:treatise on jihad. 
10:344:29093:41:14:56:541:333:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:The Shaykh also paid attention to the empowerment of woman. To quote DeLong-Bas (2004) again: 
10:345:29186:14:14:56:541:319:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:"One of the most remarkable aspects of his writings is his consistent respect for and protection of 
10:346:29285:14:14:56:541:305:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:women. The most important themes of Shaykh Muhammad's writings with respect to women were 
10:347:29374:14:13:56:541:291:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:those upholding their rights, providing justice for them, and insisting upon a balance of rights and 
10:348:29474:13:14:56:541:278:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:responsibilities   between   men   and   women"   (ibid).   This   is   an   important   proof   from   a   lady   on 
10:349:29591:14:41:56:439:264:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Shaykh’s recognition of women’s role and right in the society and the economy.
10:350:29669:41:14:56:541:223:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:From the foregoing it is clear that to him, the economic teaching and principles found in the Qur’an 
10:351:29769:14:14:56:541:209:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:and Sunnah and the Islamic heritage were enough to deal with the economic problems faced by his 
10:352:29864:14:14:56:541:195:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:simple society. Economics being a behavioral science, the Shaykh paid attention to application of 
10:353:29961:14:14:56:541:181:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:economics rather than theorization of it. His reformative efforts blocked the foreign economic and 
10:354:30059:14:13:56:541:167:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:cultural   influence   on  Arabia.   Stating   the   effect   of   the   Shaykh’s   movement   on   Christian   world 
10:355:30176:13:14:56:541:154:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:Zwemer (1901, p. 326), the zealous missionary and preacher of Christianity, remarks: “The most 
10:356:30270:14:14:56:541:140:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:unfavourable result has been in Arabia itself, by practically building a wall of fanaticism around the 
10:357:30372:14:14:56:541:126:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:old Wahabi state and postponing the opening of doors to commerce and Christianity in that part of

11:361:30686:13:42:56:393:758:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:need to carry out more comprehensive research in his economic ideas.

11:370:31156:14:27:71:273:481:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:of the region. See Zwemer (1901, p. 312).

11:372:31291:14:14:71:541:440:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:Islam founded by Muhammad bin Abd al-Wahhab (1 703-1 792). This term is given to them by 
11:373:31379:14:14:71:541:426:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:their opponents and is now used by both European scholars and most Arabs. Members of the

11:375:31571:14:13:71:541:398:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:‘Unitarians’. The movement calls for renewal of Muslim spirit, the return to the original sources 
11:376:31668:13:14:71:541:385:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:of Islam,  namely the Qur’an  and  the  authentic teachings  of Prophet  Muhammad  (peace  and 
11:377:31762:14:20:71:507:371:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:blessings of Allah be upon him), and the refutation of all pagan innovations in the religion.
11:378:31855:20:14:56:541:351:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B:4. Ibn Taymiyah (n.d. p. 281), in his work Iqtida’ al-Sirat al-Mustaqim, remarks: “Had the authority 
11:379:31955:14:14:71:541:337:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:collected what was just and put it to its proper use, they would never have needed to impose 
11:380:32047:14:19:71:189:323:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:illegal taxes and duties”.

11:383:32261:14:19:71:423:276:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:Sudan to inaugurate reform’. The story seems to be based on speculation.
11:384:32333:19:13:56:541:257:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f8:F:6.  On this al-Uthaymin raised an objection that the author did not mention where Ibn Abd al-Wahhab had 
11:385:32435:13:12:71:541:244:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f8:F:said that the zakah of merchandise should be paid to the ruler (al-Riki, 2005, p.308n). It may be noted that 
11:386:32543:12:13:71:541:232:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f8:F:almost all schools of fiqh hold that it is on the discretion of the ruler to assume collection responsibility of 
11:387:32655:13:13:71:541:219:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f8:F:zakah  of  such assets and  distribute  it, or leave  it to  the owners  to  disburse it themselves among  its 
11:388:32765:13:12:71:541:206:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f8:F:beneficiaries. However, they differed on the question whether it is obligatory for imam to do so and to 
11:389:32868:12:13:71:541:194:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f8:F:enforce people to pay him and punish those who deny it. For details one may refer to al-Qaradawi, Yusuf, 
11:390:32972:13:18:71:149:181:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f8:F:1986, 2: 765-781.
11:391:32989:18:13:56:541:163:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f8:F:7. Al-Kasani (1327, 2: 7) says: "The Prophet, peace be upon him, Abu Bakr and Umar used to collect it 
11:392:33090:13:13:71:541:150:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f8:F:(zakah of non-apparent assets) till the period of Utman. When wealth increased in his time, he thought it 
11:393:33195:13:12:71:541:137:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f8:F:appropriate to entrust it to the owners which was done in the wake of the consensus of the Companions
