2:15:427:27:28:273:339:550:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:ABSTRACT
2:16:435:28:14:90:462:522:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:We model stock price manipulation when the manipulator is in the role of an 
2:17:510:14:14:90:523:508:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:intermediary (broker). We find that in the absence of superior information, the broker can 
2:18:600:14:13:90:495:494:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:manipulate equilibrium outcomes without losing credibility with respect to accurate 
2:19:683:13:14:90:509:481:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:forecasting. This result extends to the case when the broker prefers more investment to 
2:20:770:14:14:90:518:467:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:come into the market. However, when competition among brokers is introduced then the 
2:21:854:14:14:90:452:453:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:investors get their favorite outcome in the absence of superior information. 
2:22:931:14:14:90:522:439:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:This result has important implications for encouraging broker competitions in developing 
2:23:1019:14:13:90:482:425:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:markets. Many developing markets are still not demutualized; hence broker level 
2:24:1098:13:42:90:277:412:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:competition is limited in such markets.

3:30:1445:0:51:144:467:693:14:g_d0_f6:14:g_d0_f6:C:Stock Price Manipulation: The Role of Intermediaries
3:31:1497:51:21:90:517:642:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:In emerging stock markets, the issue of stock price manipulation by intermediaries often 
3:32:1585:21:21:90:514:621:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:arises. Numerous accounts of emerging stock markets today share this concern. Khwaja 
3:33:1669:21:20:90:525:600:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and Mian (2005) use a unique trade level dataset to show that when market intermediaries 
3:34:1757:20:21:90:519:580:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(brokers) in a Pakistani stock exchange trade on their own behalf, they earn at least 50 to 
3:35:1848:21:21:90:511:559:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:90 percentage points higher annual returns and these abnormal returns are earned at the 
3:36:1935:21:21:90:498:538:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:expense of outside investors. Zhou and Mei (2003) note that the China’s worst stock 
3:37:2018:21:20:90:505:517:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:market crime was the result of a scheme implemented in collusion with brokers. They 
3:38:2101:20:21:90:520:497:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:argue that manipulation by brokers is common in many emerging stock markets. Khanna 
3:39:2184:21:21:90:512:476:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and Sunder (1999), in a case study of the Indian stock market, states that “brokers were 
3:40:2272:21:20:90:516:455:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:often accused of collaborating with the company owners to rig share prices in pump and 
3:41:2358:20:21:90:515:435:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:dump schemes”. Furthermore, according to a survey conducted by the Times of India in 
3:42:2442:21:21:90:516:414:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:October 2005, a majority of market participants in India believe that brokers manipulate 
3:43:2530:21:20:90:520:393:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:prices. In fact, in 2005, the Securities and Exchange Board of India barred 11 brokers for 
3:44:2620:20:21:90:245:373:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:engaging in price manipulation. 
3:45:2652:21:21:126:496:352:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:A number of studies have examined the issue of stock price manipulation by 
3:46:2726:21:21:90:515:331:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:speculators who are not in the role of intermediaries. Allen and Gale (1992) show that it 
3:47:2815:21:20:90:520:310:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:is possible for an uninformed trader to manipulate prices if the investors attach a positive 
3:48:2907:20:21:90:514:290:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:probability to the manipulator being an informed player. Jarrow (1992) and Hart (1977) 
3:49:2993:21:21:90:494:269:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:have analyzed manipulation in a dynamic asset pricing context and show that under 
3:50:3074:21:20:90:506:248:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:certain conditions speculators can make profits. However, a theoretical framework for 
3:51:3159:20:21:90:500:228:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:understanding manipulation when the manipulator is in the role of an intermediary is 
3:52:3243:21:21:90:523:207:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:lacking, even though anecdotes abound. Consequently, a number of key questions remain 
3:53:3328:21:20:90:523:186:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:unanswered. Firstly, anecdotal manipulation schemes involving brokers such as the pump 
3:54:3414:20:21:90:511:166:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and dump2 schemes require a continuous supply of irrational investors who, like sheep, 
3:55:3500:21:21:90:492:145:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:follow each other only to be slaughtered. Assuming a relentless supply of irrational 
3:56:3584:21:21:90:521:124:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:investors who keep on placing themselves at the mercy of manipulating brokers specially 
3:57:3671:21:25:90:517:103:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:when the stakes are very high seems unreasonable. Secondly, reputation is a key asset in 
3:58:3759:25:0:90:213:78:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:2 See Khwaja and Mian (2005)
4:59:3788:0:20:90:501:708:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:a market where brokers compete for business. How can manipulating brokers, if they 
4:60:3870:20:21:90:496:688:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:indeed manipulate, maintain their credibility (reputation) and clientele in the face of 
4:61:3957:21:21:90:516:667:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:competition from other brokers? Thirdly, mature markets do not seem to suffer from the 
4:62:4043:21:20:90:517:646:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:manipulation schemes typically associated with emerging markets.3 What allows mature 
4:63:4127:20:21:90:399:626:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:markets to function seemingly free of this type of manipulation?
4:64:4191:21:21:126:507:605:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:In this paper, we present a market microstructure model, which uses a 3-player 
4:65:4269:21:21:90:505:584:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:coordination game framework developed in Jung (2007). Jung (2007) models an arms 
4:66:4349:21:20:90:487:563:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:race scenario in which media has power to influence outcomes. However, the idea 
4:67:4428:20:21:90:513:543:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:underlying Jung’s model is general; if there is a coordination game between two parties 
4:68:4515:21:21:90:497:522:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:with asymmetric information then a third part with powers to reduce asymmetry can 
4:69:4596:21:20:90:524:501:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:manipulate equilibrium outcomes. Here, we apply this idea to financial markets and study 
4:70:4684:20:21:90:498:481:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:a coordination game between institutional and individual investors with broker as an 
4:71:4768:21:21:90:525:460:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:intermediary with powers to reduce asymmetry through its signaling. The key is to realize 
4:72:4857:21:20:90:505:439:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:that if brokers care about their credibility and investors know that, then in an apparent 
4:73:4946:20:21:90:443:419:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:defiance of intuition, brokers get to manipulate without losing credibility.
4:74:5022:21:21:126:479:398:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:This paper should be thought of as an initial attempt at understanding the 
4:75:5096:21:21:90:517:377:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:systematic price manipulation by brokers through microstructure approach. Specifically, 
4:76:5183:21:20:90:514:356:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:it provides several simple models in which an intermediary can successfully manipulate 
4:77:5269:20:21:90:517:336:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:demand in equilibrium without losing credibility. The models presented here are general 
4:78:5356:21:21:90:498:315:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and are not limited to emerging markets; hence they provide conditions under which 
4:79:5438:21:20:90:486:294:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:manipulation is checked. Those conditions are more likely to be met in developed 
4:80:5518:20:21:90:131:274:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:markets.
4:81:5526:21:21:126:518:253:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:In the basic model, there are three players, an individual investor, an institutional 
4:82:5611:21:20:90:516:232:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:investor, and a stock broker. There is a positive probability that the institutional investor 
4:83:5704:20:21:90:506:212:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:has superior information. If it does, then it trades accordingly. However, if it does not, 
4:84:5794:21:21:90:506:191:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:then it prefers to coordinate its demand level choices with the individual investor. The 
4:85:5882:21:21:90:517:170:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:individual investor never has superior information so he always prefers to coordinate his 
4:86:5971:21:20:90:508:149:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:demand level choices with the institutional investor. That is, in the absence of superior 
4:87:6060:20:28:90:521:129:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:information, each investor prefers to do as the other investor does.  This notion of feeling 
4:88:6152:28:16:90:521:101:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:3 Aggarwal and Wu (2006) present evidence of stock market manipulations in the United States. Their data 
4:89:6256:16:0:90:285:85:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:suggests that manipulators are plausibly brokers.
5:90:6306:0:20:90:517:708:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:safe while doing as other do when information is insufficient is commonly known as the 
5:91:6392:20:21:90:512:688:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:‘herd instinct’ among traders. Such a tendency is known in microeconomic literature as 
5:92:6478:21:21:90:491:667:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the bandwagon effect. The bandwagon effect arises when people’s preference for a 
5:93:6558:21:20:90:456:646:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:commodity increases as the demand by others for the commodity increases. 
5:94:6630:20:21:90:497:626:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Leibenstein(1950) is one of the earlier studies of the bandwagon effect and the main 
5:95:6714:21:21:90:515:605:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:impetus for the induction of this effect in microeconomics. The bandwagon effect is not 
5:96:6801:21:21:90:523:584:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:only just intuitively and theoretically appealing, but there also exists significant empirical 
5:97:6895:21:20:90:502:563:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:evidence for it.  As on example, Biddle (1991) empirically estimates this effect in the 
5:98:6982:20:21:90:506:543:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:demand and distinguishes it from other effects. Arguably, the bandwagon effect in the 
5:99:7067:21:21:90:392:522:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:stock market is stronger when there is insufficient information.
5:100:7131:21:20:126:521:501:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:In our model, the individual investor does not observe the type of the institutional 
5:101:7215:20:21:90:516:481:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:investor, however, the broker does. The broker, whose primary preference is to preserve 
5:102:7302:21:21:90:510:460:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:his credibility (which will be lost if either investor determines that the broker has lied), 
5:103:7394:21:20:90:500:439:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:sends a signal in the form of a publicly available research report. The research report 
5:104:7481:20:21:90:503:419:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:forecasts a bullish, bearish, or a neutral market. The report is read by each investor as 
5:105:7570:21:21:90:497:398:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:providing a signal about the other investor. A bullish signal is read by the individual 
5:106:7657:21:21:90:506:377:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:investor as implying that the institutional investor will invest with optimism, a bearish 
5:107:7746:21:20:90:486:356:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:signal as implying no investment by the institutional investor, and a neutral signal 
5:108:7830:20:21:90:524:336:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:indicating that the institutional investor will invest with caution. The institutional investor 
5:109:7925:21:21:90:487:315:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:also reads the report in the same fashion as providing a signal about the individual 
5:110:8009:21:20:90:134:294:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:investor. 
5:111:8018:20:21:126:524:274:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The conditional preference of the broker is to manipulate demand. After the signal 
5:112:8100:21:21:90:523:253:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:has been received and has become public knowledge, both types of investors choose their 
5:113:8187:21:20:90:524:232:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:demand levels simultaneously. The main result is that if the institutional investor does not 
5:114:8279:20:21:90:514:212:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:have superior information, then the broker can manipulate demand in equilibrium while 
5:115:8364:21:21:90:205:191:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:maintaining credibility. 
5:116:8389:21:21:126:523:170:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The model is then enriched to allow for competition between brokers and to allow

5:118:8549:20:21:90:516:129:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:mitigated. Compared to mature markets, those conditions are much less likely to hold in 
5:119:8636:21:21:90:499:108:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:emerging markets. Hence, as predicted by the model, broker manipulation anecdotes 
5:120:8717:21:0:90:404:87:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:abound in emerging markets and not much so in mature markets. 
6:121:8780:0:21:90:176:688:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:The Basic Model
6:122:8795:21:21:90:495:667:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:The basic model uses a 3-player coordination framework developed in Jung (2007). 
6:123:8875:21:20:90:481:646:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Jung(2007) models an arms race scenario in which media has power to influence 
6:124:8952:20:21:90:464:626:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:outcomes. However, the idea underlying Jung’s model is general; if there is a 
6:125:9029:21:21:90:504:605:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:coordination game between two parties with asymmetric information then a third part 
6:126:9112:21:21:90:518:584:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:with powers to reduce asymmetry can manipulate equilibrium outcomes. Here, we apply 
6:127:9195:21:20:90:505:563:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:this idea to financial markets and study a coordination game between institutional and 
6:128:9281:20:21:90:504:543:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:individual investors with broker as an intermediary with powers to reduce asymmetry 
6:129:9364:21:21:90:191:522:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:through its signaling.
6:130:9386:21:20:126:515:501:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:There are three players; the individual investor (S), the institutional investor (L), 
6:131:9471:20:21:90:505:481:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and the stock broker (B). Each investor can choose from any of the following demand 
6:132:9554:21:21:90:502:460:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:levels: investing with optimism (I), investing with caution (C), and not investing (N). 
6:133:9641:21:20:90:515:439:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:I>C>N=0.4  S and L have their own types. L can be optimistic, neutral, or pessimistic. S 
6:134:9729:20:21:90:520:419:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:is always neutral. The optimistic type has superior information that the market will go up 
6:135:9819:21:21:90:506:398:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:so it prefers to choose I. The pessimistic type has superior information that the market 
6:136:9907:21:21:90:488:377:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:will go down so it prefers to choose N, and the neutral type does not have superior 
6:137:9990:21:20:90:507:356:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:information either way and is prone to the bandwagon effect. Specifically, his primary 
6:138:10076:20:21:90:515:336:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:preference is to match his demand level choice with the other player and the conditional 
6:139:10164:21:41:90:314:315:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:preference is to invest cautiously or choose C. 
6:140:10212:41:21:90:516:274:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:The following inequalities describe the preference of optimistic and pessimistic types of

6:144:10422:44:21:90:522:145:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:These inequalities show that the optimistic type of L prefers to choose the demand level I 
6:145:10512:21:20:90:508:124:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:irrespective of what S does and the pessimistic type of L prefers to choose the demand 
6:146:10598:20:26:90:504:104:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:level N irrespective of what S does. The fact the L is optimistic or pessimistic implies 
6:147:10686:26:0:90:414:78:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:4 As all three demand level choices are non-negative, short selling is not allowed.

7:149:10854:20:21:90:523:688:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:information and is not prone to the ‘herd instinct’. That is, L does not care what S does as 
7:150:10946:21:41:90:306:667:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:long as it has superior information to rely on.

8:185:12695:20:21:126:509:579:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:This game proceeds as follows. At stage zero, Nature chooses L’s type. Only L 
8:186:12772:21:21:90:505:558:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and B detect L’s type. At stage one, B publishes a research report, which forecasts the 
8:187:12859:21:20:90:510:537:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:direction of the market; bullish, bearish, or neutral.  Each investor takes this report as a 
8:188:12951:20:21:90:511:517:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:signal about the other investor’s intention. Bullish means that the other investor will be 
8:189:13041:21:21:90:510:496:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:choosing the demand level I, bearish means that the other investor will be choosing the 
8:190:13128:21:21:90:512:475:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:demand level N, and neutral implies the demand level choice of C by the other investor.
8:191:13215:21:20:90:520:454:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:At stage 2, both S and L simultaneously choose I, C, or N. After all the actions are taken, 
8:192:13306:20:21:90:188:434:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:payoffs are realized.
8:193:13327:21:21:126:465:413:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Regarding broker preferences, the broker has a primary preference for 
8:194:13396:21:20:90:489:392:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:maintaining his credibility in the eyes of investors and a conditional preference for

8:207:14005:21:21:90:503:165:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:not lose credibility if both investors choose I (that would push prices up resulting in a

8:211:14360:21:0:90:140:82:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:choose C.

10:293:15503:0:20:90:500:708:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f8:C:Theorem 1Pure-strategy Perfect Bayesian equilibria exist and, in the absence of 
10:294:15582:20:21:90:506:688:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:superior information, the broker can manipulate equilibrium outcomes without losing 
10:295:15665:21:41:90:318:667:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:credibility with respect to accurate forecasting.
10:296:15714:41:21:90:521:626:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f7:B:Proof. Here every pure strategy of each player is examined. L observes both the nature’s 
10:297:15802:21:21:90:517:605:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:move (its own type) as well as B’s signal. Each type of L has 27 strategies; however, for 
10:298:15891:21:21:90:514:584:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the optimistic type 26 strategies are dominated by the strategy I since an optimistic type 
10:299:15981:21:20:90:523:563:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:always prefers to play I (inequality 1). Similarly, for the pessimistic type 26 strategies are 
10:300:16075:20:21:90:465:543:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:dominated by the strategy N since a pessimistic type always prefers to play N 
10:301:16152:21:21:90:521:522:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(inequality2). That leaves us with 27 undominated strategies for the neutral type of L and 
10:302:16242:21:20:90:327:501:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:1 undominated strategy each for other types of L.
10:303:16291:20:21:126:518:481:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:B observes nature’s move. B has 27 pure strategies. 24 of them are eliminated by 
10:304:16371:21:21:90:515:460:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:iterated dominance since B cares about correctly forecasting the actions of L (inequality 
10:305:16460:21:20:90:513:439:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:7) and optimistic type of L always plays I and the pessimistic type of L always plays N. 
10:306:16548:20:21:90:280:419:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:We are left with 3 pure strategies for B.
10:307:16589:21:21:126:505:398:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Next, if B signals C, and both S and L play either I or N then B would have an 
10:308:16667:21:21:90:490:377:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:incentive to deviate (inequality 7) implying that a strategy combination in which B 
10:309:16750:21:20:90:493:356:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:signals C, and both S and L play either I or N in response cannot be an equilibrium. 
10:310:16835:20:59:90:488:336:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:By inspection, we arrive at the following pure-strategy Perfect Bayesian equilibria:

11:346:17704:51:21:90:509:606:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Note that in all equilibria, when B signals I, both S and L play I and when B signals N, 
11:347:17792:21:21:90:507:585:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:both S and L play N. In equilibrium (I), B correctly signals the type of L, and S acts in 
11:348:17881:21:20:90:520:564:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:accordance with the signal. That is, if B signals I, S plays I, if B signals N, S plays N and 
11:349:17974:20:21:90:516:544:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:if B signals C, S plays C. In the remaining equilibria, B incorrectly signals the type only 
11:350:18065:21:21:90:501:523:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:when L is neutral. In that case, if B signals I then in the outcome both S and L play I. 
11:351:18153:21:20:90:518:502:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:However, if B signals N then in the outcome both S and L play N. Hence, in the absence 
11:352:18239:20:21:90:500:482:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of superior information (when L is of neutral type) B can manipulate the equilibrium 
11:353:18323:21:21:90:435:461:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:outcomes without losing credibility with respect to accurate forecasting.
11:354:18396:21:41:90:98:440:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:▄
11:355:18397:41:21:90:511:399:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:It is easy to see how a manipulation scheme can work. Suppose L’s type is neutral, that 
11:356:18484:21:21:90:522:378:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:is, the institutional investor does not have superior information. Suppose that B wants the 
11:357:18575:21:20:90:516:357:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:stock price to rise (B may have taken a long position on its own account), it will signal I 
11:358:18666:20:21:90:507:337:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(bullish report) and in the outcome both S and L will play I. In contrast, if B wants the 
11:359:18755:21:21:90:499:316:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:stock price to fall (due to a short position), it will signal N (bearish report) and in the

11:361:18929:20:21:90:496:275:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:study that uses a unique trade level dataset to show that when market intermediaries 
11:362:19013:21:21:90:519:254:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(brokers) in a Pakistani stock exchange trade on their own behalf, they earn at least 50 to 
11:363:19104:21:20:90:511:233:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:90 percentage points higher annual returns and these abnormal returns are earned at the 
11:364:19191:20:21:90:228:213:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:expense of outside investors.
11:365:19220:21:21:126:521:192:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Brokers make money when people invest in the market. Arguably, brokers have a 
11:366:19297:21:21:90:522:171:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:bias. They want more investment to come into the market. Next, we introduce this bias in 
11:367:19385:21:20:90:505:150:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the model. Specifically, conditional on successfully meeting its preference, the broker 
11:368:19472:20:21:90:497:130:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:prefers an outcome in which more investment comes into the market. Consequently, 
11:369:19552:21:0:90:436:109:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:another restriction is added to B’s preference in addition to inequality 7:

12:371:19646:43:41:90:502:667:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:How does this bias change equilibrium? Corollary 1 to theorem 1 provides an answer.

12:397:20693:28:20:90:516:192:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:The basic model shows that the broker can manipulate equilibrium outcomes. What will 
12:398:20777:20:21:90:500:172:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:happen if competition among brokers is introduced into the model? Will competition 
12:399:20859:21:21:90:522:151:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:mitigate broker manipulation? In this section, we show that it does. Mature and emerging 
12:400:20947:21:20:90:516:130:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:stock markets differ significantly along the dimension of brokerage competition. Hence, 
12:401:21034:20:21:90:521:110:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:one reason for smaller anecdotal evidence of broker manipulation in mature markets may 
12:402:21120:21:0:90:517:89:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:be the higher level of competition among brokers. As one example, in the Karachi Stock 
13:403:21208:0:20:90:491:708:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Exchange (KSE), the premier exchange in Pakistan, two largest brokers practically 
13:404:21289:20:21:90:511:688:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:dominate the market and have been the largest suppliers of a special mode of financing 
13:405:21375:21:21:90:520:667:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:called badla financing. Anecdotes of manipulation in KSE have these two brokers acting 
13:406:21461:21:20:90:472:646:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:in unison, practically nullifying any competition. See Khwaja and Mian (2005).
13:407:21539:20:21:126:515:626:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:We allow broker competition in the model in the form of a second broker. In the 
13:408:21618:21:21:90:493:605:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:modified model, there are 4 players; two brokers, an individual investor (S), and an 
13:409:21702:21:21:90:498:584:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:institutional investor (L). At stage zero, nature chooses L’s type. Only L and the two 
13:410:21788:21:20:90:509:563:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:brokers, B1 and B2, detect L’s type. At stage one, B1 publishes a research reports which 
13:411:21876:20:21:90:513:543:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:forecasts the direction of the market and is either bullish (I), bearish (N), or neutral (C). 
13:412:21969:21:21:90:506:522:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:As before, this report is read by each investor as the signal about the intended demand 
13:413:22056:21:20:90:487:501:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:level choice of the other investor. At stage two, B2 also publishes a report which is 
13:414:22141:20:21:90:515:481:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:similarly read by each investor.  At stage 3, both S and L simultaneously choose I, C, or 
13:415:22230:21:21:90:350:460:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:N. After all the actions are taken, payoffs are realized.
13:416:22287:21:20:126:510:439:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Regarding brokers’ preferences, just like in the basic model and the broker bias 
13:417:22367:20:21:90:477:419:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:model, the primary preference of the brokers is to preserve their credibility. The 
13:418:22449:21:21:90:492:398:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:conditional preference of the brokers depends both on broker bias as well as broker 
13:419:22532:21:21:90:467:377:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:competition. The individual investor, if it pays attention to brokers’ signals, is 
13:420:22614:21:20:90:495:356:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:additionally assumed to be conservative meaning that if the signals conflict than the 
13:421:22699:20:21:90:506:336:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:lesser signal will be followed by the individual investor. As an example, if B1 signals I 
13:422:22788:21:21:90:514:315:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and B2 signals C then the individual investor, if it decides to pay attention to the signals, 
13:423:22881:21:41:90:510:294:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:will act on C.  The following inequalities describe relevant cases of broker competition:
13:424:22970:41:41:90:185:253:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Severe Competition
13:425:22988:41:21:90:517:212:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:In this type of competition, each broker prefers an outcome in which its prediction holds 
13:426:23077:21:21:90:518:191:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:true whereas the prediction of the other broker is wrong; even if it means that, as a result 
13:427:23169:21:21:90:493:170:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of conflicting signals from the brokers, the investors will not invest. Conditional on 
13:428:23255:21:41:90:490:149:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:maintaining credibility, the following inequality describes the relevant cases for B2:

14:432:23595:21:21:90:512:667:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:payoffs of B2 are read similarly. This inequality shows that if the broker moving second 
14:433:23683:21:20:90:519:646:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:can choose between two types of outcomes, type 1 being outcomes in which B2 is correct 
14:434:23769:20:21:90:495:626:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and B1 is incorrect, and type 2 being outcomes in which both are correct, then it will 
14:435:23855:21:21:90:521:605:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:choose type 1 even if it means that the investors will not invest in the market. This shows 
14:436:23946:21:21:90:497:584:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:that competition is so severe that the broker is willing to sacrifice all of the potential

16:479:26896:20:42:90:143:688:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:is realized.

16:484:27186:21:20:90:515:561:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(S is conservative).  That is, if B1 signals I but B2 signals C then S plays C (third entry in

16:498:28148:20:21:90:517:263:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:N also, resulting in both investors abstaining from the market.  In moderate competition, 
16:499:28237:21:21:90:514:242:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:B1 and B2 prefer that at least some investment (at least C) from L remains in the market. 
16:500:28326:21:20:90:493:221:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:That guarantees that if B1 signals C then B2 will also signal C.  That leaves only one

17:507:28817:0:20:90:517:708:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:It is straightforward to see that the proposed strategies for S and L are the best responses

17:509:28997:21:21:90:239:667:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:constitutes a Nash equilibrium.
17:510:29028:21:20:90:508:646:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:To see that this equilibrium is unique: Since brokers’ primary preference is credibility,

17:512:29205:21:21:90:520:605:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:pessimistic. That means, any strategy in which S ignores broker signals cannot be played 
17:513:29293:21:21:90:510:584:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:in pure-strategy equilibrium simply because it cannot be the best response when nature 
17:514:29379:21:20:90:517:563:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:picks L’s type to be either optimistic or pessimistic. This observation combined with the

17:528:30147:42:20:90:518:232:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f7:B:ProofIf L’s type is neutral, it follows directly from severe competition inequalities that 
17:529:30237:20:21:90:507:212:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:B1 will signal N and B2 will also signal N since if either broker signals anything else, it

17:531:30388:42:20:90:457:149:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:The results indicate that competition has a mitigating effect on intermediary 
17:532:30465:20:21:90:512:129:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:manipulation. If competition is moderate then the most favored outcome of investors in 
17:533:30551:21:21:90:513:108:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the absence of superior information, which is to invest with caution, is realized. That is, 
17:534:30642:21:0:90:477:87:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the brokers cannot manipulate the outcome to their advantage in that case. If the 
18:535:30725:0:20:90:487:708:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:competition is severe, then the investors abstain from the market in the absence of 
18:536:30808:20:21:90:504:688:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:superior information. If bias dominates competition then the brokers get their favorite 
18:537:30895:21:21:90:514:667:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:outcome in the absence of superior information. It is easy to extend theorems 1 and 2 to 
18:538:30983:21:20:90:491:646:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the case when broker(s) imperfectly observe L’s type. Similarly, instead of brokers 
18:539:31066:20:21:90:522:626:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:moving in a sequence, brokers may be allowed to move simultaneously without changing 
18:540:31150:21:21:90:142:605:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the results.
18:541:31162:21:21:126:476:584:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Do emerging markets differ significantly from mature markets along the 
18:542:31232:21:20:90:479:563:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:dimension of competition? Indeed, they do. Many emerging markets are still not 
18:543:31310:20:21:90:520:543:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:demutualized. As one example, the Karachi Stock Exchange, the premier stock exchange 
18:544:31394:21:21:90:484:522:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:in Pakistan is still a mutually owned company. This mutual ownership by brokers 
18:545:31473:21:20:90:513:501:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:severely limits competition apart from raising governance concerns. No wonder, broker 
18:546:31558:20:21:90:518:481:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:manipulation stories abound in emerging markets and not much so in developed markets.
18:547:31643:21:21:126:522:460:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The above are simple microstructure models of stock price manipulation in which 
18:548:31722:21:20:90:520:439:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:manipulators are in the role of intermediaries. Main findings are that an intermediary can 
18:549:31812:20:21:90:482:419:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:manipulate outcomes in equilibrium without losing credibility. However, enough 
18:550:31890:21:21:90:514:398:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:competition has a mitigating effect on manipulation and the investors’ favorite outcome 
18:551:31977:21:21:90:507:377:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:is realized. Nevertheless, if broker competition exceeds a certain threshold then, in the 
18:552:32066:21:20:90:484:356:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:absence of superior information, it results in investors abstaining from the market 
18:553:32149:20:21:90:508:336:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:entirely. The results indicate that encouraging broker competition may be a solution to 
18:554:32236:21:21:90:506:315:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the intermediary manipulation problem in emerging markets since competition checks 
18:555:32318:21:20:90:495:294:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:broker bias. In this respect, demutualization of stock exchanges is a step in the right 
18:556:32405:20:21:90:136:274:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:direction.
18:557:32415:21:21:126:489:253:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The results are important for three reasons. Firstly, it is an initial attempt at 
18:558:32496:21:20:90:509:232:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:making sense of broker manipulation through rational economic models. Manipulation 
18:559:32578:20:21:90:500:212:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:anecdotes abound, however, a model that predicts manipulation by brokers where all 
18:560:32660:21:21:90:522:191:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:players are rational is lacking. Secondly, the role of competition in mitigating this type of 
18:561:32753:21:21:90:517:170:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:manipulation has been highlighted. Competition among brokers reduces manipulation in 
18:562:32837:21:20:90:518:149:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:these models. Thirdly, brokers make money when people invest in the market. This built 
18:563:32923:20:21:90:519:129:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:in bias neutralizes competition by providing a powerful incentive for collusion, a finding 
18:564:33013:21:0:90:287:108:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:with important governance implications. 
19:565:33055:0:20:90:147:708:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:Conclusion
19:566:33065:20:21:90:524:688:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Stock price manipulation by brokers is an issue that frequently raises its head, specially in 
19:567:33158:21:21:90:498:667:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:less developed or emerging markets. However, the lack of an appropriate theoretical 
19:568:33241:21:20:90:523:646:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:framework had left a number of questions unanswered thus far. In particular, Can brokers 
19:569:33329:20:21:90:523:626:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:manipulate if all market participants are rational? Or, how can brokers not lose credibility 
19:570:33421:21:21:90:518:605:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:if they indeed are engaged in manipulation? Presumably, loss of reputation or credibility 
19:571:33510:21:21:90:511:584:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:would hamper their ability to continue manipulating. Also, what are the reasons behind 
19:572:33596:21:20:90:428:563:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:fewer manipulation anecdotes emerging from the developed markets? 
19:573:33661:20:21:126:487:543:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:In this paper, we presented a simple market microstructure framework that 
19:574:33734:21:21:90:485:522:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:provides an answer to these questions. Interestingly, we find that it is the brokers’ 
19:575:33819:21:20:90:496:501:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:concern for credibility that allows them to manipulate while maintaining credibility. 
19:576:33904:20:21:90:508:481:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Indeed, brokers can manipulate even when the investors are rational. We also find that

19:578:34068:21:20:90:518:439:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:implications for corporate governance. Many of the emerging world markets are still not
