2:32:1825:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:There  is  robust  evidence  that  higher  minimum  wages  increase  family  incomes  at  the  bottom  of 
2:33:1931:14:14:72:545:574:12:Times:12:Times:the distribution.  The  long  run  (3  or  more  years)  minimum  wage  elasticity  of  the  non-elderly 
2:34:2035:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:poverty  rate with  respect  to  the  minimum  wage  ranges  between  -0.220  and  -0.459  across 
2:35:2132:14:14:72:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:alternative  specifications. The  long  run  minimum  wage  elasticities  for  the  10th  and  15th 
2:36:2231:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:unconditional   quantiles   of   family   income range   between   0.152   and   0.430   depending   on 
2:37:2334:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:specification.  A  reduction  in  public  assistance  partly offsets  these  income  gains,  which  are  on

3:48:2704:0:33:72:185:709:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:1  Introduction
3:49:2719:33:22:71:540:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:At least since Gramlich (1976), economists have recognized that the ability of minimum wage policy
3:50:2817:22:22:71:539:654:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to aid lower-income families depends on the joint distribution of wage gains, potential job losses, and
3:51:2920:22:22:71:539:632:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:other sources of family income. The poverty-reducing effects of the minimum wage is expected to be
3:52:3018:22:22:72:540:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:small if job losses from a minimum wage increase are sizable, or if most minimum wage workers are
3:53:3115:22:22:72:542:588:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:higher up in the family income distribution—say because they are teens from higher income families,
3:54:3214:22:22:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:or because their spouses are paid well. Therefore, the extent to which minimum wages raise family
3:55:3311:22:22:72:535:544:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:incomes at the bottom of the distribution is not cleara priori, and has to be studied empirically.
3:56:3409:22:22:88:539:522:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:However, while there is a large and active literature on the employment effects of minimum
3:57:3499:22:21:71:540:500:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:wages—see Belman and Wolfson (2014) for a recent review—there are relatively fewer studies that
3:58:3594:21:22:72:540:479:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:empirically estimate the impact of the policy on family incomes. Compounding the problem, the
3:59:3687:22:22:72:540:457:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:existing papers often suffer from a number of key shortcomings including insufficient attention to
3:60:3785:22:22:72:540:435:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the validity of the research design, and use of small samples sometimes with limited minimum wage
3:61:3882:22:22:71:465:413:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:variation—all of which tend to produce somewhat erratic and imprecise estimates.
3:62:3962:22:22:88:540:391:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In this paper, I use individual-level data from the March Current Population Survey (CPS)
3:63:4051:22:22:72:540:369:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:between 1984 and 2013 to provide a more complete assessment of how U.S. minimum wage policies
3:64:4144:22:22:72:540:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:shift the distribution of family incomes for the non-elderly population than has been to date.1This
3:65:4243:22:22:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:paper makes three important advances over the existing literature. First, I fully characterize how
3:66:4341:22:22:72:540:303:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:minimum wage increases shift the cumulative distribution of family incomes, and subsequently use
3:67:4437:22:22:72:540:281:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:this to estimate unconditional quantile partial effects (UQPE) of the policy. This provides a fuller
3:68:4537:22:22:72:540:259:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:picture of the distributional effects of the policy than available to date. Second, I show how the
3:69:4635:22:22:72:540:237:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:income effects by quantile varies when we consider broader income definitions to include tax credits
3:70:4735:22:21:72:540:215:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and non-cash transfers. I am able to quantify the extent to which offsets through reduced public
3:71:4831:21:22:72:540:194:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:assistance affects the distributional impact of minimum wages. Third, I provide estimates that are
3:72:4929:22:22:72:540:172:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:more credibly causal than in the literature by utilizing a wide range of specifications with alternative
3:73:5033:22:22:72:540:150:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sets of controls for time-varying heterogeneity, and by assessing the assumption of parallel trends
3:74:5132:22:22:72:540:128:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:using an array of falsification tests across the income distribution. Specifically, I use distributed lag
3:75:5237:22:20:72:540:106:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:specifications that both includes leads and up to three years of lags in the minimum wage, allowing
3:76:5336:20:14:87:541:86:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:1In this paper, when I refer to the 1984-2013 period, I am referring to the survey years for the March CPS. Note,
3:77:5449:14:0:72:498:72:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:however, that respondents in March 2013 CPS survey are asked about their income during the year 2012.
4:78:5551:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for a delayed impact of the policy; and I allow for time varying heterogeneity by region, business
4:79:5649:22:22:72:222:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cycles and state-specific trends.
4:80:5682:22:22:88:539:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Overall, I find robust evidence that higher minimum wages lead to increases in incomes at the
4:81:5775:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:bottom of the family income distribution. For the poverty rate, long-run minimum wage elasticities
4:82:5873:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:between -0.220 and -0.459 obtain from eight specifications ranging from the classic two-way fixed
4:83:5970:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:effects model to a model with a rich set of controls for trends, regional shocks and business cycle
4:84:6069:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:heterogeneity. All of these estimates are statistically distinguishable from zero at conventional
4:85:6166:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:levels.2There is a reduction in the shares below income cutoffs between 50 and 125 percent of the
4:86:6263:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:federal poverty threshold (FPT), with the largest proportionate reductions occurring around 75
4:87:6357:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:percent of the poverty threshold (elasticities ranging between -0.186 and -0.566). When I look across
4:88:6458:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:demographic groups using the preferred (most saturated) specification, the poverty rate elasticities
4:89:6558:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are similar when restricted to younger (under 30) and lower credentialed individuals without a
4:90:6652:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:high school degree. However, the elasticity is relatively larger for black and Latino individuals
4:91:6749:21:22:70:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(-0.872), while relatively smaller for single mothers (-0.327). The poverty reducing effects are not
4:92:6849:22:22:72:519:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:substantially different after 1996, in the period following welfare reform and EITC expansion.
4:93:6943:22:22:88:539:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:By estimating how a minimum wage increase affects the shares of population with incomes
4:94:7030:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:below various multiples of the federal poverty threshold we identify the effect of the policy on the
4:95:7130:22:22:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of equivalized family incomes. Subsequently, we can
4:96:7224:22:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:invert the impact of the policy on the CDF to estimate the impact on an income quantile, i.e., the
4:97:7322:22:22:72:542:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:UQPE. I use the recentered influence function (RIF) regression approach of Firpo et al. (2009),
4:98:7417:22:22:71:539:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:which performs this inversion using a local linear approximation to the counterfactual CDF. This
4:99:7513:22:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:local inversion entails rescaling the marginal effect of minimum wages on the share above an income
4:100:7612:22:30:72:350:226:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:cutoff by the probability density of income at that cutoff.3
4:101:7672:30:15:87:539:196:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:2Most results in this paper are for the non-elderly population; so when I refer to “the poverty rate,” I am referring
4:102:7789:15:11:72:540:181:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:to the poverty rate among those under 65 years of age. Also, as a matter of terminology, in this paper virtually all
4:103:7905:11:11:72:540:170:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:elasticities are elasticities with respect to the minimum wage. For brevity, I will sometimes refer to “the elasticity of
4:104:8026:11:11:72:540:159:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:the poverty rate with respect to the minimum wage” as either “the minimum wage elasticity for the poverty rate” or
4:105:8140:11:11:72:540:148:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:simply “the poverty rate elasticity.” The same is true for elasticities of other outcomes with respect to the minimum
4:106:8257:11:7:71:420:137:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:wage, such as family income quantiles, the proportion under one-half poverty line, etc.
4:107:8344:7:15:87:539:130:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:3It is useful to contrast the UQPE with estimates from the more familiar (conditional) quantile regression. The
4:108:8455:15:11:72:540:115:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:quantile regression provides us with an estimate of the the impact of minimum wages on, say, the 10th conditional
4:109:8568:11:11:72:540:104:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:quantile of family incomes.  This tells us how the policy affects those with unusually low income within their
4:110:8678:11:11:72:541:93:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:demographic group, e.g., a college graduate with an income that is lowrelativeto others in her educational category.
4:111:8794:11:10:72:541:82:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:However, here we are interested in the effect of the policy on those with low incomes in anabsolute(or unconditional)
4:112:8911:10:0:72:456:72:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:sense, while controlling for covariates such as education. This is exactly what UQPE measures.
5:113:9006:0:22:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:I find clear, positive effects of minimum wages on family incomes below the 20th quantile. The
5:114:9100:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:largest impact occurs at the 10th and 15th quantiles, where estimates from most specifications
5:115:9194:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are statistically significant, and the long run minimum wage elasticities for these family income
5:116:9291:22:22:72:541:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:quantiles range between 0.152 and 0.430 depending on control sets. In the preferred (most saturated)
5:117:9391:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:specification, the family income elasticities with respect to the minimum wage are around 0.359 and
5:118:9490:22:22:72:542:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:0.332 for the 10th and 15th quantiles, respectively, and diminish close to zero by the 30th quantile.
5:119:9591:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Since the conventional income definition used for official poverty calculations does not include tax
5:120:9691:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), or non-cash transfers such as Supplemental
5:121:9786:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), I also estimate the impact using an expanded income
5:122:9876:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:definition. After accounting for tax credits and non-cash transfers, the minimum wage effect on
5:123:9971:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the level of family incomes (i.e., the semi-elasticities) are about 66% as large for the bottom 30
5:124:10069:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:percent of the distribution. Overall, the evidence clearly points to at least moderate income gains
5:125:10168:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for low income families resulting from minimum wage increases. At the same time, there is evidence
5:126:10266:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for some substitution of government transfers with earnings as evidenced by the somewhat smaller
5:127:10362:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:income increase accounting for tax credit and non-cash transfers such as SNAP and EITC. The
5:128:10453:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimates are similar from the more recent period (e.g., post 1996) when the policy environment is
5:129:10551:22:22:72:386:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:more homogeneous following welfare reform and EITC expansion.
5:130:10612:22:22:88:541:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:While this paper substantially improves upon existing research on the topic of minimum wages,
5:131:10705:22:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:family income distribution and poverty, the existing research is consistent with the proposition
5:132:10801:22:22:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that minimum wages likely reduce poverty. In online Appendix A, I quantitatively assess estimates
5:133:10898:22:22:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from the 13 key papers in the literature by collecting or constructing nearly every minimum wage
5:134:10994:22:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:elasticity for the poverty rate from those studies for a variety of demographic groups. 72 out of the
5:135:11095:22:22:71:540:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:78 elasticities have a negative sign, and a simple average of the 78 elasticities produces a poverty
5:136:11195:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rate elasticity of -0.18, while the average of the median elasticities from each study is -0.17. For
5:137:11295:22:22:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:8 of the 13 studies that actually report an estimate for overall poverty (as opposed to narrower
5:138:11391:22:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:subgroups), the average of poverty rate elasticities is -0.13. These averages are broadly consistent
5:139:11491:21:22:71:539:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with the range of findings in this paper in pointing toward a poverty reduction effect of minimum
5:140:11588:22:22:71:406:117:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:wages, though they tend to be smaller in magnitude than what I find.
5:141:11656:22:22:88:541:95:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:At the same time, the existing evidence is clouded by serious shortcomings in these studies:
5:142:11748:22:0:72:540:73:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:insufficient controls for state-level heterogeneity; short time periods, sometimes with little minimum
6:143:11851:0:22:71:539:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:wage variation; over-statement of precision due to improper methods of statistical inference; and the
6:144:11952:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:use of idiosyncratic sets of outcomes and target groups. In contrast, I use 30 years of data from a
6:145:12051:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:period with a large amount of cross-state minimum wage variation. I also pay close attention to the
6:146:12150:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:non-random nature of minimum wage policies (Allegretto et al. 2017). Since there is disagreement
6:147:12246:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the literature on the appropriateness of particular specifications, I show results using eight
6:148:12343:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:different specifications with alternative controls for state-level heterogeneity that subsumes much
6:149:12442:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the approaches used in the literature. Starting with the classic two-way fixed effects model, I
6:150:12540:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:progressively add regional controls, state specific trends, and state-specific business cycle effects—all
6:151:12645:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of which have been shown to be important in the extant minimum wage literature (e.g., Allegretto
6:152:12741:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:et al. 2017, Zipperer 2016). The resulting set of estimates produces a credible range regardless
6:153:12837:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of one’s priors on, say, the desirability of using regional controls. At the same time, I assess the
6:154:12937:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:internal validity of various specifications using a host of falsification tests including estimating effects
6:155:13045:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:higher up in the income distribution, as well as analyzing leading effects (pre-existing trends) across
6:156:13148:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:specifications. I show that the inclusion of controls for such state-level heterogeneity tends both to
6:157:13250:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:improve performance on falsification tests and to increase the magnitude of the estimated elasticity
6:158:13350:22:22:72:320:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the poverty rate with respect to minimum wages.
6:159:13400:22:22:88:539:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This paper adds to a growing literature that estimates distributional effects of policies using
6:160:13495:22:22:71:539:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a quasi-experimental design. For example, Havnes and Mogstad (2015) also use RIF regressions
6:161:13587:22:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in a difference-in-difference setting to study the distributional impact of universal child care and
6:162:13687:22:22:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:find that a small average effect masks the more sizable increases in adult earnings at the bottom
6:163:13784:22:22:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:quantiles. The distributional analysis in this paper is also similar to Hoynes and Patel (2016), who
6:164:13884:22:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:show how EITC expansion shifted the lower end of the family income distribution. Finally, Autor
6:165:13979:22:22:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:et al. (2016) estimate the effect of minimum wages on the hourly wage distribution, refining the
6:166:14075:22:22:72:215:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:earlier analysis by Lee (1999).
6:167:14106:22:22:88:539:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In section 2, I describe the data and research
6:168:14200:22:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:design, including the RIF estimation of unconditional quantile partial effects. Section 3 presents my
6:169:14301:21:22:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:empirical findings on the effect of minimum wages on the proportions below various low-income
6:170:14394:22:0:72:542:117:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cutoffs as well as on income quantiles. Section 4 concludes with a discussion of the policy implications.
7:171:14500:0:34:72:274:709:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:2  Data and research design
7:172:14527:34:29:72:279:675:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:2.1  Data and sample construction
7:173:14560:29:22:72:541:646:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:I use individual level data from the UNICON extract of the March Current Population Survey (CPS)
7:174:14656:22:22:72:539:624:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:between 1984 and 2013. I augment the CPS data with information on state EITC supplements,4
7:175:14746:22:22:72:540:602:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:state per-capita GDP, and state unemployment rates from the University of Kentucky Center for
7:176:14839:22:21:72:540:580:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Poverty Research, and state and federal minimum wages from the U.S. Department of Labor. I take
7:177:14934:21:22:72:540:559:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the average of the effective minimum wage (maximum of the state or federal minimums) during
7:178:15025:22:22:72:540:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the year for which respondents report incomes. For example, I match the the effective monthly
7:179:15118:22:22:72:540:515:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:minimum wage averaged over January through December of 2011 in a given state to respondents
7:180:15209:22:22:72:263:493:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from that state in the 2012 March CPS.
7:181:15247:22:22:88:541:471:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:There is extensive variation in minimum wages over the 30 year period studied in this paper.
7:182:15339:22:22:72:540:449:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure B.1 plots the nominal federal minimum wage, as well as the 50th, 75th and 90th percentiles
7:183:15436:22:22:72:540:427:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the effective nominal minimum wages (weighted by population). As the figure shows, the effective
7:184:15535:22:22:72:540:405:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:minimum wage varied substantially over this period across different states. It is also the case that
7:185:15635:22:22:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:there has been much more variation in minimum wages since 2000. Therefore, the inclusion of more
7:186:15731:22:22:72:542:361:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:recent data is particularly helpful as it allows us to estimate the effects of the policy more precisely.
7:187:15836:22:22:88:539:339:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The primary goal of this paper is to characterize how minimum wage changes affect the entire
7:188:15928:22:22:72:540:317:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:distribution of family incomes; for this reason, most of the analysis is performed for the non-elderly
7:189:16030:22:21:72:539:295:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:population as a whole.5The exclusion of the elderly is motivated by the fact that they have much
7:190:16126:21:22:72:540:274:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:lower rates of poverty than the rest of the population, in large part due to Social Security. For
7:191:16223:22:22:72:540:252:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:example, CPS data from March 2013 shows that 9.1 percent (2.7 percent) of the elderly had incomes
7:192:16320:22:22:72:540:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:under the poverty line (one-half the poverty line), whereas the corresponding proportions for the
7:193:16417:22:22:72:540:208:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:non-elderly population were 15.9 and 7.2 percent, respectively. For this reason, we are unlikely to
7:194:16516:22:22:72:540:186:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:learn very much about the impact of minimum wages on the bottom quantiles of the family income
7:195:16610:22:22:72:540:164:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:distribution from studying the elderly. Finally, a focus on the non-elderly is also common in the
7:196:16707:22:34:72:540:142:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:literature (e.g., Burkhauser and Sabia 2007, Sabia and Nielsen 2015). However, I also show that the
7:197:16806:34:15:87:539:108:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:4Many states specify a percentage of the federal EITC as a supplement to be paid to state taxpayers. I use this
7:198:16917:15:7:72:333:93:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:state EITC supplement rate in my analysis as a control variable.
7:199:16981:7:14:87:539:86:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:5Official poverty measures do not include unrelated individuals under 15 years of age; for this reason I exclude
7:200:17093:14:0:72:193:72:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:them from the sample as well.
8:201:17123:0:22:72:409:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:overall estimates are quite similar if we include the elderly population.
8:202:17196:22:22:88:539:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:As I discuss in Online Appendix A, a number of researchers have studied the impact of minimum
8:203:17289:22:22:71:539:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:wages on children and single mothers (e.g., Morgan and Kickham 2001, DeFina 2008, Gundersen
8:204:17380:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and Ziliak 2004).  Several studies have also considered younger adults, or adults with limited
8:205:17474:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:education; these include Neumark (2016), Addison and Blackburn (1999), and Sabia and Nielsen
8:206:17566:22:22:70:539:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(2015). Besides estimating the effect of minimum wages on the incomes of the non-elderly population
8:207:17665:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:overall, I also show key results by demographic groups similar to those that have been studied in
8:208:17762:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the literature. These include (1) all individuals without a high school degree (3) individuals younger
8:209:17864:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:than 30 without a high school degree, (4) individuals with high school or less schooling, (5) black
8:210:17963:22:22:72:541:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:or Latino individuals, (6) children under 18 years of age, (7) all adults and (8) single (unmarried)
8:211:18063:22:38:72:180:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:mothers with children.
8:212:18085:38:28:72:281:451:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:2.2  Outcomes and research design
8:213:18118:28:22:71:540:423:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This paper focuses on equivalized6real family income, defined as multiples of the federal poverty
8:214:18215:22:22:72:541:401:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:threshold:yit=YitFPT(Ni,Childreni,t). This is also sometimes referred to as the income-to-needs (ITN)
8:215:18316:22:22:72:540:379:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ratio. As is standard,yitis the ratio between family income,Yit, and the federal poverty threshold
8:216:18414:22:22:72:540:357:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f3:FPT(Ni,Childreni,t)—which depends on family size (Ni) and the number of children, and varies
8:217:18506:22:22:72:540:335:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:by year (t). I start with the conventional definition of family income as is used for official poverty
8:218:18608:22:22:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:measurement: pre-tax cash income which includes earnings and cash transfers, but does not include
8:219:18705:22:22:72:539:291:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:non-cash benefits or tax credits.7I use the term family to refer to primary families, sub-families, as
8:220:18807:22:22:71:540:269:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:well as single (non-family) householders. Family income and poverty thresholds are computed for
8:221:18902:22:22:72:208:247:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:each family type separately.8
8:222:18931:22:22:88:541:225:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The official poverty measure excludes non-cash transfers such as SNAP and housing assistance,
8:223:19024:22:22:72:540:203:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as well as tax credits such as EITC. As Fox et al. (2014) shows, exclusion of these categories of
8:224:19121:22:22:72:540:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:income tends to understate the economic gains made by families in the lower end of the income
8:225:19214:22:18:72:540:159:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:distribution during the 1990s and 2000s. Moreover, there is evidence that minimum wages may

8:227:19376:11:15:87:541:130:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:7Eligible income includes earnings (excluding capital loss or gains), unemployment compensation, workers’
8:228:19481:15:11:72:540:115:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:compensation, Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, cash-based public assistance such as Temporary
8:229:19588:11:11:71:541:104:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), veterans’ payments, survivor benefits, pension or retirement income, interest,
8:230:19703:11:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:dividends, rents, royalties, income from estates, trusts, educational assistance, alimony, child support, assistance from

9:237:20351:22:37:72:513:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tax credits are calculated by the Census Bureau based on the respondents’ reported income.

9:256:21703:22:22:72:540:215:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to elasticities by dividing by the sample mean of the population share below the cutoff,F(c). For
9:257:21800:22:21:72:539:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:example,βLRc=1F(c)×(αc0+αc1+αc2+αc3)is the long run elasticity. The explicit inclusion
9:258:21886:21:22:72:540:172:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the lagged treatment variable may be of particular relevance when the specification includes a
9:259:21983:22:22:72:542:150:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:state-specific linear trend. With state trends, but without lagged treatment included as a regressor,
9:260:22084:22:22:72:540:128:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a delayed impact can lead to a mis-estimation of the state trends, attenuating the measured effect
9:261:22182:22:22:72:540:106:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the treatment (e.g., Wolfers 2006, Meer and West 2015). Explicit inclusion of up to 3 years of
9:262:22279:22:0:72:297:84:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:lags in minimum wages mitigates this problem.
10:263:22325:0:22:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The inclusion of a leading minimum wage term allows us to net out any level differences in the
10:264:22419:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:outcome between treated and control states just prior to treatment. As a consequence, the medium
10:265:22515:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and long run elasticities do not reflect such differences, unlike in a static model. Additionally, the
10:266:22617:22:22:70:539:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:“leading value”(βc,−1)provides us with a falsification test to discern the reliability of a research
10:267:22717:22:22:71:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:design. A statistically significant or sizable leading value,βc,−1, indicates that the specification
10:268:22817:22:22:72:542:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:may not be able to account for a violation of the parallel trends assumption prior to treatment,
10:269:22913:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and hence may provide misleading estimates.9To clarify, theβτ,−1term in not included inβMRcor
10:270:23006:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f3:βLRc.At the same time, aβτ,−16= 0indicates that the treated and control units had some deviation
10:271:23102:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in trends in the past, which raises questions about whether there may be additional deviations in
10:272:23199:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:trends in the future. For this reason, I subject all the specifications to the leading value falsification
10:273:23305:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:test, and use this information as a criteria for model selection. In some cases, I also show the
10:274:23401:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cumulative response with 3 years of leads and 3 years of lags in minimum wages to better evaluate
10:275:23498:22:21:72:432:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the assumption of parallel trends right before the minimum wage increases.
10:276:23572:21:22:88:541:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:All regressions control for individual-level covariatesXit(quartic in age, and dummies for gender,
10:277:23670:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:race and ethnicity, education, family size, number of own children, and marital status), as well as
10:278:23769:22:22:72:542:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:state-level covariatesWs(i)t(unemployment rate, state EITC supplement, and per capita GDP).
10:279:23860:22:22:71:540:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We can calculate the minimum wage elasticity for the proportion underc,γc, by dividingαcby
10:280:23950:22:22:72:539:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the sample proportion underc. Therefore,γ1corresponds to the elasticity of the poverty rate
10:281:24041:22:22:71:539:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with respect to the minimum wage. The state-level unemployment rate and per-capita GDP are
10:282:24131:22:22:71:539:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:time-varying controls to account for aggregate economic shocks in the state that are unlikely to
10:283:24227:22:22:71:539:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:be affected by the policy, given the small share of minimum wage workers in the workforce. All
10:284:24321:22:22:72:542:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:regressions and summary statistics in this paper are weighted by the March CPS sample weights.
10:285:24415:22:22:72:462:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Finally, the standard errors are clustered by state, which is the unit of treatment.
10:286:24499:22:22:88:539:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A problem with the two-way fixed effects model is that there are many potential time varying
10:287:24591:22:22:72:542:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:confounders when it comes to the distribution of family incomes. As shown in Allegretto et al.
10:288:24685:22:21:70:539:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(2013), high- versus low-minimum wage states over this period are highly spatially clustered, and
10:289:24782:21:22:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tend to differ in terms of growth in income inequality and job polarization, and the severity of
10:290:24878:22:31:72:540:117:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:business cycles. To account for such confounders, I also estimate specifications that allow for
10:291:24973:31:14:87:539:86:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:9For example, Dube et al. (2010) and Allegretto et al. (2017) show that the two-way fixed effects model often fails
10:292:25088:14:0:72:470:72:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:this falsification test when it comes to minimum wage impact on teen and restaurant employment.
11:293:25184:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:arbitrary regional shocks by the nine Census divisions, by incorporating division-specific year effects
11:294:25287:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f3:θcd(i)t. This is motivated by the finding in Allegretto et al. (2011) and Dube et al. (2010) of the
11:295:25386:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:importance of spatial heterogeneity in estimating minimum wage effects on employment, and these
11:296:25481:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:papers utilize division-specific time effects as well. Additionally, I will consider specifications with
11:297:25585:22:22:72:502:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:state-specific linear trends,σs(i)t, to account for long run trend differences between states.
11:298:25679:22:22:88:539:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Given the importance of the business cycle as a determinant of family incomes and movements
11:299:25770:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the poverty rate, I pay special attention to the issue in this paper. The inclusion of the state
11:300:25869:22:22:72:542:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:unemployment rate and year dummies are the usual means of accounting for cyclical factors.
11:301:25959:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:However, there are strong prior reasons to worry about business cycle heterogeneity across states
11:302:26056:22:22:71:539:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:when it comes to poverty and minimum wages. Allegretto et al. (2013) show that minimum wage
11:303:26147:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:increases are not uniformly distributed throughout the business cycle—they tend to occur more
11:304:26240:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:frequently during the second half of economic expansions. That paper also shows that states with
11:305:26336:22:21:72:542:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:higher minimum wages over the 1990-2012 period experienced sharper business cycle fluctuations.
11:306:26431:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Moreover, states with higher minimum wages may systematically differ with respect to other
11:307:26521:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:attributes (such as unemployment insurance generosity) which may affect how a given change in the
11:308:26618:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:state unemployment rate translates into changes in family incomes or the incidence of poverty. As
11:309:26715:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:another illustration, Zipperer (2016) shows that low wage employment was much more reliant on
11:310:26808:22:22:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the construction sectors in states bound by the federal minimum wage increase during 2007-2009; as
11:311:26906:22:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a result, these states suffered a much steeper relative decline in low wage employment during this
11:312:27004:22:22:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:period quite independent of minimum wage policy. For these reasons, I also consider specifications
11:313:27102:22:22:72:539:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that include state-specific Great-Recession-year indicators,ρcr(t)s(i), whereby a dummy for each
11:314:27198:22:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Great Recession year is interacted with a dummy for the state: that is, state fixed effects interacted
11:315:27300:22:22:71:540:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with separate dummies for each recessionary year: 2007, 2008, 2009.10This specification allows
11:316:27394:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:state level outcomes to respond arbitrarily to each recession, but as a consequence of the inclusion
11:317:27494:22:22:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the state-specific recession-year dummies, the identifying variation in such specifications is largely
11:318:27599:22:41:72:250:160:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:limited to non-recessionary periods.11
11:319:27637:41:11:83:364:119:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:10These correspond to CPS survey years 1991, 1992, 2002, 2008-2010.
11:320:27704:11:15:83:539:108:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:11An added concern raised by Neumark et al. (2014) is that recessionary periods can influence the estimation
11:321:27812:15:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:of state-specific trends. As Allegretto et al. (2017) argue, this too can be handled by the inclusion of state-specific
11:322:27931:11:10:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:recession-year dummies. In studying minimum wage effects on welfare caseloads, Page et al. (2005) also use state-specific
11:323:28052:10:0:72:440:72:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:business cycle controls, although they interact the unemployment rate with state dummies.
12:324:28143:0:40:88:307:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The most saturated specification is as follows:
12:325:28190:40:0:86:112:669:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f11:Icit=

12:329:28274:40:22:88:539:629:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Besides equations 1 and 2, I also show results from all of the six intermediate specifications with
12:330:28373:22:22:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:combinations of the three sets of controls (division-specific year effects, state-specific recession-year
12:331:28478:22:22:72:541:585:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:effects, and state-specific linear trends), and discuss the full range of estimates.12Additionally,
12:332:28577:22:21:71:539:563:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:I assess the relative contribution of each of the three sets of controls in explaining the difference
12:333:28678:21:22:72:276:542:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:between estimates from equations 1 and 2.
12:334:28719:22:22:88:539:520:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:I estimate a series of regressions for alternative income cutoffs. In the main tables, I report the
12:335:28818:22:22:72:540:498:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:impact of minimum wages on the shares below the following cutoffs: 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, and 1.75
12:336:28918:22:22:72:540:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:times the federal poverty threshold. In the figures, I show the effects for each threshold between 0.5
12:337:29020:22:22:72:540:454:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and 3.5 times the poverty threshold in increments of 0.1. Note that 3.5 times the threshold exceeds

12:339:29216:22:22:72:540:410:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the impact of the policy on the bottom half of the equivalized family income distribution. The
12:340:29310:22:22:72:540:388:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimates for cutoffs near the middle of the distribution are also useful as falsification tests, since we
12:341:29416:22:37:72:450:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:do not expect the minimum wage to substantially affect incomes in that range.

12:347:29912:22:22:72:540:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Moreover, if we have estimates for the impact of the policy on the CDF for all values of an outcome
12:348:30011:22:22:72:539:190:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f3:y, we can then invert the impact of the policy on the CDF to estimate the effect of the policy on a

12:350:30205:21:22:72:539:147:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f3:y, say equivalized family income. The functionFB(y)represents the counterfactual CDF, showing
12:351:30298:22:22:72:540:125:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the distribution that would occur were there to be a small increase in the minimum wage. Under

12:353:30488:28:0:83:447:75:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:12Using quadratic instead of linear trends in the saturated model produces similar results.

13:355:30676:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:covariates, for every value ofc. The resulting estimates would fully characterize the impact of the
13:356:30775:22:22:72:539:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:treatment on the CDF ofy, i.e.,FB(y)−FA(y), and hence form an estimate of the counterfactual

13:358:30885:22:22:88:539:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Say we are interested in the effect of the policy on theτthquantile of the outcomey. The
13:359:30973:22:22:72:542:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:unconditional quantile partial effect (UQPE) estimand is defined as:QB,τ−QA,τ=F−1B(τ)−F−1A(τ).
13:360:31067:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:It is a partial effect of minimum wages, since the distribution regressions used to estimate the
13:361:31163:22:22:72:539:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:counterfactual,FB(y), hold other covariates constant. It is an unconditional quantile effect because
13:362:31263:22:22:72:541:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:it measures the impact of the policy on quantiles of the unconditional (or marginal) distribution ofy,
13:363:31365:22:22:71:539:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:which in the minimum wage context is of greater policy relevance than the conditional quantile partial
13:364:31467:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:effect (CQPE) that is the estimand associated with the quantile regression (Koenker and Bassett
13:365:31562:22:22:71:539:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f9:1978). The latter represents the impact of the treatment on theτthquantile of the distribution ofy
13:366:31660:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:conditional on covariates. For example, the CQPE informs us of the impact of minimum wages on
13:367:31753:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:those with low family incomes within their educational group—be they college graduates or without
13:368:31850:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a high school degree. However, when thinking about distributional effects of minimum wages, we
13:369:31944:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are not as interested in the impact of minimum wages on college graduates with unusually low
13:370:32036:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:family incomes–i.e., who are poor relative to other college graduates. We are more interested in the
13:371:32136:22:22:72:539:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f4:impact on those with low incomes in an absolute (or unconditional) sense.13We do wish tocontrol
13:372:32231:22:22:72:539:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:forfactors like education, but do not wish toconditionthe distributional statistic on (e.g., define
13:373:32330:22:22:70:539:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:“low income” based on) those factors. The UQPE,QB,τ−QA,τ, controls for covariates, but does
13:374:32421:22:22:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:not define the quantiles based on them; hence, it captures the effect of the policy on the bottom
13:375:32518:22:22:72:254:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:quantiles of the marginal distribution.
13:376:32557:22:22:88:540:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:It is possible to estimate the UQPE for theτthquantile by (1) estimating the effect of the policy
13:377:32654:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on the proportions under a large set of cutoffs,c, and forming an estimate for the counterfactual
13:378:32751:22:22:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:distributionFB(τ), and then (2) globally inverting that distribution function and obtain an estimate
13:379:32851:22:21:72:539:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:forF−1B(τ)and hence an estimate forF−1B(τ)−F−1A(τ). This procedure is feasible, and outlined in
13:380:32946:21:31:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Chernozhukov et al. (2013). However, it is computationally demanding as it requires estimating a
13:381:33042:31:15:83:540:108:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:13To be clear, both the UQPE and CQPE measure the effect of the treatment on low income quantiles, and not
13:382:33148:15:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:specifically on people who would have earned low incomes (in either a conditional or an unconditional sense) absent
13:383:33263:11:10:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:the policy. The two concepts coincide only under the additional assumption of rank invariance, i.e., that the treatment
13:384:33382:10:0:72:237:72:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:does not alter the ranking of individuals.
14:385:33426:0:22:71:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:very large number of distribution regressions to globally invertFB(y)and estimate the quantile
14:386:33520:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:effects. As described in Firpo et al. (2009) and Fortin et al. (2011), we can instead invert the
14:387:33616:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:counterfactual distribution function using a local linear approximation. Figure 1 provides the
14:388:33710:22:22:72:539:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:intuition behind this approach. We begin by defining a cutoffcassociated with quantileτsuch
14:389:33801:22:22:72:539:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:thatFA(c) =τusing the actual distribution. Next, we estimate the effect of the policy on the
14:390:33893:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:proportion belowcusing a single distribution regression. The effect on the proportion is graphically
14:391:33993:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:represented as∆ =(FB(c)−FA(c))in Figure 1. Now, the quantityQB,τ−QA,τcan be locally
14:392:34076:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:approximated by the product of the vertical distance−∆ =−(FB(c)−FA(c))divided by the slope
14:393:34166:22:22:71:542:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the distribution function atFA(c) =τ, which is just the PDF ofyat theτthquantile:fA(F−1A(τ)).
14:394:34262:22:22:71:539:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The green dashed triangle shows the geometry of this local linear approximation, which can be
14:395:34355:22:22:71:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:written asUQPE≈−FB(c)−FA(c)fA(c). While the global inversion would require us to estimate a large
14:396:34452:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:number of regressions for different values ofcin order to obtain the estimate for a single quantile
14:397:34551:22:21:72:424:445:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f3:Qτ, only one regression is needed for each quantile when inverting locally.
14:398:34626:21:22:88:539:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The key simplification of taking a linear approximation to the counterfactual CDF works well
14:399:34718:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for a relatively continuous treatment with a substantial variation in treatment intensity, and less
14:400:34817:22:22:71:539:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:well for lumpy or discrete treatments. Given the fairly continuous variation in minimum wages, the
14:401:34915:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:approximation error is unlikely to be a major concern here. Later in this section, I discuss a few
14:402:35013:22:22:72:494:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:additional features of the data that further reduce the scope of the approximation error.
14:403:35102:22:22:88:539:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To operationalize the estimation, following Firpo et al. (2009), I use as the dependent variable

15:450:37249:22:22:71:539:289:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:distribution have been fairly stationary over the past three decades, although they do exhibit
15:451:37343:22:22:72:540:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cyclical tendencies. Appendix Figure B.3 also shows that the probability densities at the associated
15:452:37443:22:22:72:540:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:income-to-needs cutoffs (fA(c(τ))have also been fairly stable over time, with the possible exception
15:453:37543:22:22:72:540:223:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the 5th quantile. The relative stability of the income-to-needs quantiles and densities is relevant
15:454:37645:22:22:72:541:201:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for interpreting the UQPE estimates. The estimation of the UQPE for a particular quantile,τ,
15:455:37737:22:22:72:540:179:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is based on changes in the proportion below the income-to-needs cutoffc(τ)associated with that
15:456:37831:22:27:72:542:157:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:quantile, along with the probability density of the income-to-needs ratio at that cutoff,fA(c(τ)).
15:457:37929:27:15:83:540:130:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:14I find that the estimation error inf(Qτ)contributes trivially to the overall variance of theηLRτ. Using the delta
15:458:38044:15:11:72:540:115:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:method, accounting for the estimation of the density around the cutoff increases the standard error ofηLRτtypically by
15:459:38162:11:11:71:539:104:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:less than 0.1%. For this reason, the results in this paper do not explicitly adjust the standard errors for the estimation
15:460:38284:11:7:72:110:93:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:off(Qτ).
15:461:38292:7:14:83:539:86:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:15The kernel density estimation uses an Epanechnikov kernel and the STATA default bandwidth based on Silverman’s
15:462:38404:14:0:72:130:72:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:rule-of-thumb.
16:463:38420:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Bothc(τ)andfA(y)are calculated by averaging over the entire sample. The relative stability of the
16:464:38517:22:22:72:539:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:mapping betweencandτover this period suggests that the estimated impact on income around a
16:465:38607:22:22:72:432:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:given cutoffcis referring to roughly the same quantile over this full period.
16:466:38684:22:22:88:541:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f11:Finally, the use of the full-sample distribution to estimate the cutoffc(τ)and the densityfA(c)
16:467:38779:22:22:72:542:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:may be an issue if the treatment and control units had very different income distributions. However,
16:468:38879:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:all states receive treatment at some point during the sample, and the variation in minimum wages
16:469:38975:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is fairly continuous and widespread; therefore, the the sample-averaged cutoffs and densities are
16:470:39072:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:broadly representative of where the minimum wage variation is coming from. Overall, the nature
16:471:39166:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of both the treatment as well as the outcome facilitate the application of the RIF approach to a
16:472:39262:22:38:72:224:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:repeated cross-sectional setting.
16:473:39295:38:29:72:225:473:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:2.3  Descriptive statistics
16:474:39322:29:21:71:540:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Table 1 shows shares of the non-elderly population, as well as eight key demographic groups under
16:475:39419:21:22:72:542:423:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:alternative income cutoffs, which range between 0.5 and 1.75 times the federal poverty threshold.
16:476:39516:22:22:71:539:401:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To clarify, row 3 shows the poverty rates, while row 5 shows the share with income below 1.5 times
16:477:39614:22:22:72:178:379:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the poverty threshold.
16:478:39636:22:22:88:539:357:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:For non-elderly adults as a whole, the poverty rate averaged at 0.136 during the 1984-2013
16:479:39726:22:22:71:539:335:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:period. Including elderly in the sample decreases it slightly to 0.132. Individuals without a high
16:480:39824:22:22:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:school degree (0.214) as well as those with high school or lesser schooling (0.179) had greater rates of
16:481:39928:22:22:72:540:291:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:poverty. The poverty rate for single mothers (0.224), black/Latino individuals (0.263), and children
16:482:40028:22:22:70:539:269:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(0.195) were all higher than the average. Poverty rate among adults (0.112), on the other hand, is
16:483:40126:22:22:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:smaller than other groups. These patterns are as expected, and are qualitatively similar when we
16:484:40222:22:45:72:299:225:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:consider 50% or 150% of the poverty threshold.
16:485:40268:45:34:72:224:180:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:3  Empirical findings
16:486:40289:34:29:72:458:146:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:3.1  Main results for shares below multiples of poverty threshold
16:487:40354:29:22:71:539:117:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Table 2 provides the estimates for the impact of minimum wages on the shares below various multiples
16:488:40454:22:21:72:540:95:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the federal poverty threshold. For ease of interpretation, I report the estimates as elasticities
16:489:40554:21:0:72:539:74:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f3:βMRcandβLRcby dividing the sum of regression coefficients by the sample proportion under each
17:490:40649:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cutoff; this is true both for the point estimate and the standard errors. I show estimates using the
17:491:40749:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:specification which includes (a) division-specific year effects, (b) state-specific Great Recession-year
17:492:40853:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:dummies, and (c) state-specific linear trends. In Section 3.4, I show that the general findings of
17:493:40951:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:poverty reduction are robust to virtually all forms of controls for time-varying heterogeneity used in
17:494:41053:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:this literature, including the simple two-way fixed effects model. However, as I also show in Section
17:495:41154:22:22:71:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:3.4, the saturated model performs the best in terms of falsification tests, which is why I use it as my
17:496:41257:22:22:72:180:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:preferred specification.
17:497:41281:22:22:88:539:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Overall, there is strong evidence that minimum wage increases reduce the share of individuals
17:498:41374:22:22:71:539:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with low family incomes. The medium-run poverty elasticity is -0.399 (SE=0.126), while the long-run
17:499:41473:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimate is -0.446 (SE=0.137), both being statistically significant at the 1 percent level. More
17:500:41569:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:generally, there is a reduction in the shares of individuals with incomes below family income cutoffs
17:501:41670:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:between 50 and 125 percent of the official poverty threshold: the long-run elasticities range between
17:502:41771:22:21:70:540:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:-0.294 and -0.461, and these are all statistically significant at the 5 percent level (except for the 50
17:503:41875:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:percent cutoff, which is significant at the 10 percent level). Figure 2 provides visual evidence on
17:504:41974:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:how minimum wages affect the bottom half of the family income distribution. The figure reports
17:505:42068:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:elasticities for each multiple of the poverty threshold between 0.5 and 3.5 in increments of 0.1—a
17:506:42166:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:total of 31 regressions. The top panel shows that by the second year after the policy change, there
17:507:42265:22:22:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are large, statistically significant reductions in the share below cutoffs between 0.5 and 1.2 times
17:508:42365:22:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the poverty threshold with minimum wage elasticities exceeding -0.5 in magnitude. The elasticities
17:509:42463:22:22:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for cutoffs exceeding 1.2 are mostly close to zero, and never statistically significant. The bottom
17:510:42562:22:22:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:panel of the figure shows that that long run (3+ year) minimum wage elasticities are sizable and
17:511:42658:22:22:72:542:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:statistically significant for cutoffs between roughly 0.6 and 1.4 times the poverty threshold. However,
17:512:42761:22:22:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:there is some additional reduction in the shares below cutoffs between 1.4 and 2 times the poverty
17:513:42859:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:threshold. The elasticities subsequently decline in magnitude, and are close to zero for cutoffs of
17:514:42958:22:22:71:540:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:2.75 times the poverty threshold or greater. Overall, there is an indication that the medium run (2
17:515:43057:22:21:71:539:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:year) effects are more concentrated at lower incomes than longer run effects. The lagged effects
17:516:43153:21:22:71:539:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:higher up in the family income distribution could be consistent with a lagged spillover effect of
17:517:43250:22:22:72:272:117:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:minimum wages on the wage distribution.
17:518:43289:22:22:88:539:95:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:While the baseline specifications use 1 year of lead and 3 years of lags, to further assess the issue
17:519:43390:22:0:72:540:73:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of parallel trends, I also estimate a longer distributed lag model with 3 leads and 3 lags. Figure 3
18:520:43492:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:reports the cumulative response elasticities by successively adding the leads and lags, normalizing
18:521:43591:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the elasticity to be zero at event time equal to -1. The top panel shows the changes for the share
18:522:43689:22:22:72:542:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:below the federal poverty threshold: the share is stable in the 3 years prior to the policy change,
18:523:43788:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:but starts falling starting the year of the minimum wage increase, and reaches its maximum impact
18:524:43885:22:22:71:539:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:2 years after the change. In contrast, the share below 3 times the federal poverty threshold shows
18:525:43983:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:no systematic movement: the cumulative response is close to zero for the three years prior to the
18:526:44080:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:policy change, and straddles zero subsequently. Overall, this evidence on timing provides additional
18:527:44180:22:22:71:232:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:validation for the research design.
18:528:44215:22:22:88:539:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To assess possible heterogeneity in the effect of the policy, Table 3 shows minimum wage
18:529:44303:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:elasticities for the shares below alternative family income cutoffs for various demographic groups
18:530:44401:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:defined using education, age, gender, race, presence of kids, and marital status. For all groups, I
18:531:44500:22:22:72:542:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:find sizable reductions in the proportions under 50, 75, 100 and 125 percent of the poverty threshold.
18:532:44602:22:21:71:540:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The long run estimates of these 32 elasticities (8 groups with 4 cutoffs each) range between -0.225
18:533:44701:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and -0.872, and 28 are statistically significant at least at the 10 percent level. As compared to our
18:534:44802:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:previous estimates for non-elderly individuals (-0.446), the poverty rate elasticities are quite similar
18:535:44906:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for children (-0.499), those without a high school degree (-0.481), those with high school or lesser
18:536:45006:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:schooling (-0.474), all individuals including elderly (-0.436), all adults (-0.375), and individuals
18:537:45106:22:22:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:under thirty without a high school degree (-0.432). In contrast, they are are somewhat smaller
18:538:45200:22:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in magnitude for single mothers (-0.327), and substantially larger in magnitude for black and
18:539:45293:22:22:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Latino individuals (-0.872). The reductions in low-income shares extend somewhat further up the
18:540:45388:22:22:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:distribution for black and Latino individuals, children under 18, and those under 30 without a high
18:541:45487:22:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:school degree; for these groups, there are substantial and statistically significant reductions for up
18:542:45589:22:22:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to 175 percent of the poverty threshold. The key conclusion from these findings is that when we
18:543:45684:22:22:72:542:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:focus on disadvantaged groups such as black or Latino individuals, or those with lesser education,
18:544:45782:22:22:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the anti-poverty impact of minimum wages appears to be similar or somewhat greater; however, for
18:545:45878:22:21:72:449:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:another disadvantaged group (single mothers) the impact is somewhat smaller.
18:546:45954:21:22:88:539:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Next, I compare my findings with what the existing research suggests about heterogeneous
18:547:46042:22:22:72:542:117:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:impact by age, single mother status, education, and race, as summarized in Appendix Table A.1.
18:548:46136:22:22:72:542:95:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:First, if we take the poverty rate elasticities for groups under 20 years of age in the literature,
18:549:46235:22:0:72:542:73:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Morgan and Kickham (2001) and Addison and Blackburn (1999) also find a substantial effect of,
19:550:46330:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:respectively, -0.39 and -0.39 (averaged across specifcations for teens). While my estimate for all
19:551:46428:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:children are somewhat larger in magnitude (-0.499), both existing work and results in this paper
19:552:46524:22:22:72:490:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:point toward a substantial poverty reducing impact of minimum wages among children.
19:553:46607:22:22:88:541:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Second, for single mothers, I find elasticities for the proportion under the poverty line of -0.327,
19:554:46707:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and under one-half poverty line of -0.458, which as noted above are somewhat smaller than the
19:555:46800:22:22:72:542:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:population overall; they are also imprecise and not statistically significant at conventional levels.
19:556:46901:22:22:71:539:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The implied elasticities in Neumark (2016) for 21-44 year old single women with kids range between
19:557:46999:22:22:70:541:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:-0.14 and -0.30 depending on specification. These estimates are broadly similar to what I find,
19:558:47094:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:though I note the imprecision in both sets of estimates. Sabia (2008) finds a range of elasticities
19:559:47193:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:between -0.28 and -0.17 for single mothers, depending on the mother’s education level. Burkhauser
19:560:47290:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and Sabia (2007) find poverty rate elasticities for single mothers between -0.21 and -0.07 depending
19:561:47390:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on specification. DeFina (2008) finds poverty rate elasticities in woman headed households with kids
19:562:47490:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of -0.42 (-0.35 when restricting to mothers without a college education). Finally, Gundersen and
19:563:47586:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Ziliak (2004) finds very small effects for woman headed households (-0.02). If we take an average of
19:564:47686:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the poverty rate elasticities for single mothers (or woman heads of households) across these five
19:565:47783:22:22:72:465:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:studies, we get an average elasticity of -0.18, as compared to my estimate of -0.30.
19:566:47867:22:22:88:539:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The third comparison concerns heterogeneity in the effect by levels of education. I find poverty
19:567:47963:22:22:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:elasticities for those without a high school degree (-0.481), or with high school or lesser schooling
19:568:48064:22:22:70:539:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(-0.474) that are comparable to the overall estimate (-0.446). Neumark (2016) provides estimates
19:569:48160:22:22:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for those 21 years or age or older by education: the unrestricted estimates range between -0.11 and
19:570:48259:22:22:70:539:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:-0.15, while for those with high school or lesser education, they range between -0.01 and -0.19; none
19:571:48360:22:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of these are statistically significant. Sabia (2008) finds somewhat larger reductions in the poverty
19:572:48460:22:22:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rate for single mothers without a high school degree (-0.28) than those with (-0.17), although neither
19:573:48562:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimate is statistically significant. In contrast, restricting to those with less education tends to
19:574:48663:22:22:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:slightly diminish the effects in DeFina (2008), though they continue to be sizable (changing from
19:575:48760:22:21:70:539:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:-0.42 to -0.35). The estimates in Sabia and Nielsen (2015) are highly imprecise and the impact of
19:576:48857:21:22:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:conditioning on education levels is contradictory across specifications. Finally, while Addison and
19:577:48956:22:22:72:540:117:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Blackburn (1999) do not provide comparable estimates by levels of education, averages across their
19:578:49054:22:22:72:540:95:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:specifications do suggest a somewhat large elasticity (-0.45) for individuals who did not complete
19:579:49152:22:0:72:540:73:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:junior high school. While the estimates in the literature do not paint to a clear picture, on balance
20:580:49255:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:they do not suggest that the poverty reducing effect of minimum wages is smaller among those with
20:581:49352:22:22:72:340:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:less education. That is consistent with what I find here.
20:582:49409:22:22:88:539:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The fourth, and final, comparison concerns heterogeneity by race. Here, I find clear evidence of
20:583:49505:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:substantially stronger reduction in poverty, and near poverty, among black or Latino individuals as
20:584:49604:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:compared to the population as a whole. Gundersen and Ziliak (2004) also find a slightly larger effect
20:585:49705:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the black population—though the magnitude is still very small (-0.06). Finally, the estimates in
20:586:49804:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Sabia and Nielsen (2015) are, again, imprecise and qualitatively differ by specification. This paper
20:587:49904:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:provides sharper evidence than available in existing work that minimum wages tend to raise bottom
20:588:50001:22:38:72:352:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:incomes more strongly for African Americans and Latinos.
20:589:50057:38:29:72:299:495:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:3.2  Effect on family income quantiles
20:590:50095:29:22:71:540:466:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We can use the impact of minimum wages on the cumulative distribution of family income to
20:591:50184:22:21:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimate the impact on family income quantiles. Figure 4 shows the sample average CDF of family
20:592:50279:21:22:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:income, along with the counterfactual distribution. In the top scale of the figure, income is shown
20:593:50378:22:22:72:540:401:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as multiples of the federal poverty threshold,y. The bottom scale shows income in dollar amounts
20:594:50474:22:22:72:542:379:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:obtained by multiplyingyby the sample average of the real federal poverty threshold ($22,476).
20:595:50568:22:22:72:540:357:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Here the counterfactual distribution at incomecis calculated asF(c) +αLRc,whereF(c)is the CDF
20:596:50661:22:22:72:539:335:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:averaged over the entire sample, andαLRcis the 3+ year minimum wage semi-elasticity estimated
20:597:50754:22:22:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from equation (2). In other words, it is the counterfactual CDF with a log point increase in the
20:598:50850:22:22:72:539:291:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:minimum wage. The figure is based on 31 separate regressions estimated for cutoffscbetween
20:599:50940:22:22:72:540:269:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:0.5 and 3.5 in increments of 0.1 using the preferred specification. This is just a different way of
20:600:51039:22:22:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:reporting the estimates shown in Figure 2, which instead showed the impact as elasticities. In
20:601:51133:22:22:72:540:225:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:both figures, we can see that there is a statistically significant and quantitatively substantial shift
20:602:51236:22:22:72:540:203:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the CDF for incomes between 0.5 and 1.75 times the poverty threshold. Overall, an increase
20:603:51329:22:22:72:540:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the minimum wage seems to improve the family income distribution in the sense of first order
20:604:51424:22:21:72:540:159:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:stochastic dominance. By juxtaposing the actual and counterfactual CDF, we can also visually
20:605:51516:21:22:72:540:138:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:assess the impact by quantiles (the vertical axis). By considering the horizontal distance between the
20:606:51618:22:22:72:540:116:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:actual and counterfactual CDFs, we can infer that there is clear, statistically significant, increases
20:607:51720:22:22:72:540:94:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in incomes between the 10th and 20th percentiles. And that above the 40th percentile, the changes
20:608:51817:22:0:70:288:72:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(horizontal distance) are mostly close to zero.
21:609:51866:0:22:88:541:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This exercise illustrates the key idea behind estimating the unconditional quantile partial effects.
21:610:51966:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In principle, we can estimate the quantiles by globally inverting the CDF as we did visually when
21:611:52063:22:22:72:542:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:inspecting Figure 4. This is similar to the approach in Chernozhukov et al. (2013). While feasible,
21:612:52162:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:this requires estimating a large number of regressions, even when estimating the effect for a single
21:613:52262:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:quantile. Therefore, the global inversion can be computationally demanding, especially as we wish
21:614:52359:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to estimate it for many specifications with a large set of fixed effects and for different income
21:615:52456:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:definitions, and using individual level data. For this reason, I use the RIF approach proposed by
21:616:52553:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Firpo et al. (2009). We approximate the horizontal distance between the actual and counterfactual
21:617:52650:22:22:72:542:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:CDFs at quantileqby dividing the vertical distance between the two by the PDF atq=F−1(c).
21:618:52739:22:22:71:539:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This requires us to estimate only a single regression per quantile. The unconditional quantile
21:619:52833:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:partial effects (βτ)are estimated using equation 3, or analogous regressions for the less saturated
21:620:52932:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:specifications. To convert the UQPEs into elasticities (ητ), they are subsequently divided by the
21:621:53029:22:21:72:349:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:income-to-needs cutoffs corresponding to a given quantile.
21:622:53087:21:22:88:539:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 5 shows the long-run minimum wage elasticities for each family income quantile between
21:623:53180:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:5 and 50 using the preferred specification. We find substantial and statistically significant effects
21:624:53281:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for quantiles between the 7th and 20th, declining sharply by the 35th quantile. The elasticities
21:625:53377:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:around the median of the family income distribution straddle zero. The figure provides compelling
21:626:53474:22:22:71:541:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:visual evidence that minimum wage policies tend to raise income at the bottom of the distribution,
21:627:53572:22:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:consistent with evidence on the CDF in Figure 4. Column 2 of Table 4 reports the magnitudes
21:628:53663:22:22:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the medium and long-run elasticities for the baseline (cash) income definition. The long run
21:629:53758:22:22:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:elasticities are 0.273, 0.359, 0.332, 0.152, and 0.164 for the 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th and 25th quantiles
21:630:53861:22:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of equivalized family incomes, respectively. The 10th, 15th, and 25th quantiles are statistically
21:631:53958:22:22:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:significant at least at the 5 percent level, while the 20th quantile is significant at the 10 percent
21:632:54059:22:18:72:104:204:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:level.16
21:633:54067:18:23:88:96:186:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:17
21:634:54069:23:15:83:541:163:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:16As noted above, globally inverting the CDF is computationally intensive, and especially for conducting inference.
21:635:54184:15:11:72:540:148:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:However, the estimates are broadly similar. For example, the elasticities for 10th, 15th, 20th, 30th, 40th, and 50th
21:636:54300:11:11:72:541:137:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:quantiles when inverting globally are 0.44, 0.26, 0.18, 0.09, 0.05, 0.08, while the locally inverted estimates are 0.36,
21:637:54420:11:7:72:365:126:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:0.33, 0.15, 0.09, 0.05, 0.02, respectively. (Results not reported in tables.)
21:638:54497:7:15:83:539:119:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:17These are based on point-wise confidence intervals. Additionally, I implement the bootstrap-based approach of
21:639:54608:15:11:72:540:104:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:Lehrer et al. (2016)—which identifies the ranges of the outcome distribution that exhibit positive treatment effects
21:640:54724:11:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:accounting for possible multiple testing concerns. The more conservative inference of Lehrer et al. control for the
21:641:54839:11:10:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:family-wise error rate, which here is the probability that we mistakenly declare a positive UQPE for at least one
21:642:54952:10:0:72:540:72:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:quantile in the considered range. When I consider the quantiles 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30, I find that the 10th and 15th
22:643:55071:0:22:88:541:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:So far, our income defintion has corresponded to that used in the official poverty definition,
22:644:55165:22:22:71:539:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:which limits to cash-based incomes. Next, we expand the income definition, and estimate minimum
22:645:55260:22:22:71:539:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:wage elasticities for quantiles of family income inclusive of tax credits and non-cash transfers. These
22:646:55363:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:elasticities are reported in column 4 of Table 4, and are generally smaller than those using pre-tax
22:647:55463:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cash income (column 2). Specifically, averaged across the 10th and the 15th quantiles—where
22:648:55554:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:there is a sizable effect—the elasticities are 69% and 60% as large from using the expanded income
22:649:55652:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:definition for the medium and long run, respectively. Figure 6 shows the elasticities visually for
22:650:55750:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:each quantile between 5 and 50 using the preferred specification, where we continue to find sizable
22:651:55849:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and statistically significant effects between 7th and 20th quantiles. However, the elasticities using
22:652:55950:22:22:72:460:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:expanded income are about 60% as large as those in Figure 5 for those quantiles.
22:653:56030:22:22:88:539:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:While the elasticities are useful in understanding how responsive income is to minimum wages
22:654:56122:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for various quantiles, they are less useful for assessing how much of the cash income gain is being
22:655:56221:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:offset by a loss in tax credits or non-cash transfers. This is because the proportionate change in
22:656:56319:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cash versus expanded incomes is also driven by the fact that the expanded incomes are larger: so a
22:657:56417:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:$1 increase in income due to minimum wages is a smaller share of expanded income, just because
22:658:56511:22:22:72:542:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the $1 is divided by a larger denominator. For example, the 15th quantile in cash income is $24,123;
22:659:56611:22:22:71:542:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:when we expand the income definition to include non-cash transfers and tax credits, it is $27,423.
22:660:56709:22:22:71:539:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Therefore, even if the income gains using the two definition are identical, the elasticity using the
22:661:56809:22:22:72:351:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:expanded income definition would be around 12% smaller.
22:662:56864:22:22:88:539:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To better capture the extent of offset, Table 4 reports the minimum wage effect on the level
22:663:56956:22:22:72:542:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of real incomes (i.e., the semi-elasticities,γτ) for progressively more expansive income definitions.
22:664:57057:22:22:71:540:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:When we consider all 5 quantiles (5th, 10th, 15th, 20th, 25th and 30th), the increase in expanded
22:665:57154:22:22:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:income including tax credits and non-cash transfers is around 66% as large. About a third of the loss
22:666:57255:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is due to reduced non-cash transfers (column 3) while the remaining two thirds is due to reduction in
22:667:57356:22:22:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tax credits (column 5). However, there is an interesting difference in where in the income distribution
22:668:57459:22:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:these two losses occur. To see this more easily, I plot the semi-elasticities from the three income
22:669:57558:21:22:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:definitions in Figure 7. The loss due to reduced non-cash transfers is highly concentrated between
22:670:57656:22:24:72:540:117:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the 14th and 16th quantiles, around or just above the federal poverty threshold. This is consistent
22:671:57755:24:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:quantile effect are statistically significant at the 5 percent level. This contrasts with the point-wise CI which are
22:672:57872:11:10:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:significant for the 10th, 15th and 25th quantiles. Overall, the conclusion that there are positive effects at the 10th and
22:673:57994:10:0:71:359:72:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:15th quantiles do not appear to be driven by multiple-testing concerns.
23:674:58067:0:22:71:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with the nature of eligibility requirements of non-cash assistance programs: for instance, typically
23:675:58167:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:only individuals with income at or lower than 130% of the federal poverty threshold are eligible for
23:676:58267:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:SNAP. As a result, some individuals with incomes just below the eligibility threshold can lose the
23:677:58365:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:benefits due to higher earnings. Figure 7 provides compelling evidence on the importance of these
23:678:58462:22:22:72:542:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:offsets: at the 15th quantile, there is a 40% offset to the income gain due to loss in public assistance,
23:679:58567:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:mostly due to reduced non-cash transfers. In contrast, at 10th or 20th quantiles, the offset in income
23:680:58669:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:gains due to loss in public assistance was only around 15%. Moreover, while the loss in non-cash
23:681:58765:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:transfers is relatively more concentrated around the 15th quantile, the loss due to tax credits is
23:682:58863:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:more uniform across the income distribution. This likely reflects the fact that the EITC phase-out
23:683:58961:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:range is more spread out. The findings on offsets is also consistent with simulation results from
23:684:59058:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Maag and Carasso (2013) who tend to find that the effective marginal tax rate (after accounting for
23:685:59157:22:22:72:539:467:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:transfers) on earnings is often quite high between 100 and 150% of the federal poverty threshold.18
23:686:59256:22:21:88:539:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Finally, Table 4 also shows that the offsets in public assistance appear to be larger in the long
23:687:59353:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:run. This could potentially reflect a behavioral response in utilization: for example, higher incomes
23:688:59454:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:could reduce SNAP take-up rate and not the eligibility rate, and changes in take-up behavior can
23:689:59550:22:22:72:420:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:take longer to adjust than the mechanical effects of changes in eligibility.
23:690:59626:22:22:88:539:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:While use of the thirty years of data provides us with greater precision, one may wonder whether
23:691:59722:22:22:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the patterns are similar in more recent times. In particular, when it comes to tax credits and
23:692:59816:22:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:transfers, EITC expansion of 1992 and welfare reform in 1996 are important, and may interact
23:693:59908:22:22:71:539:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with the minimum wage policy. Moreover, there is evidence that target efficiency of minimum
23:694:59999:22:22:71:539:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:wages has improved over time (Lundstrom, 2016). For these reasons, in Table 5, I show the income
23:695:60095:22:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:elasticities by quantiles for cash income and expanded income including tax-credits and transfers
23:696:60192:22:22:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for subsamples beginning in 1990 as well as 1996. The estimates are quite similar to those from
23:697:60287:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the full sample. For the sample beginning in 1996, the long run elasticities for the 10th and 15th
23:698:60385:22:30:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:quantiles when considering cash incomes are 0.447 and 0.503, respectively, and both are statistically
23:699:60486:30:15:83:540:152:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:18That the income gains at the 15th quantile is 40% smaller when using an expanded income definition does not
23:700:60595:15:11:72:540:137:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:necessarily imply that an individual at the 15th quantile of the cash incomes experiences a 40% offset due to lost
23:701:60709:11:11:72:541:126:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:public assistance. Individuals at these quantiles need not be the same (a) before versus after the policy change (b)
23:702:60825:11:11:71:539:115:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:when considering different types of incomes. We would need to make a rank-invariance assumption to assure that our
23:703:60939:11:11:72:540:104:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:findings about quantiles can be interpreted as reflecting impacts on individuals. As an empirical matter, ranks in the
23:704:61057:11:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:conventional cash income and the expanded incomes are highly correlated. For those in the bottom half of the cash
23:705:61170:11:10:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:income distribution, the correlation coefficient between the two ranks is 0.99. However, this does not tell us whether
23:706:61288:10:0:72:335:72:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:the policy affects the rank of individuals in the two distributions.
24:707:61358:0:22:72:542:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:significant at the 5% level. For comparison, these elasticities for the full sample are 0.359 and 0.332,
24:708:61462:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:respectively (Table B.4). When using the expanded income definition, the elasticities for these two
24:709:61561:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:quantiles are 0.352 and 0.275 in the 1996-2013 sample, as compared to 0.256 and 0.160 in the full
24:710:61658:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sample. Estimates from the sample beginning in 1990 are similar. As expected, the estimates for
24:711:61753:22:38:72:471:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the smaller samples are generally less precise, but the magnitudes are quite similar.

24:713:61911:29:22:71:539:554:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To assess how controls for unobserved heterogeneity influence the findings, Figure 8 plots the long
24:714:62010:22:22:72:542:532:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:term minimum wage elasticities for shares below various multiples of the federal poverty threshold.
24:715:62109:22:22:70:540:510:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(The full set of medium and long run coefficients and standard errors are reported in Online Appendix
24:716:62210:22:22:71:539:488:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Table B.3.) I use eight different regression specifications that range from the classic two-way fixed
24:717:62311:22:22:72:541:466:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:effects model (panel A, column 1 in Figure 8) to the most saturated specification (panel B, column 4)
24:718:62412:22:21:71:539:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:which includes (a) division-specific year effects, (b) state-specific Great Recession-year dummies, and
24:719:62515:21:22:70:539:423:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(c) state-specific linear trends. The six other specifications exhaust all intermediate combinations of
24:720:62618:22:22:72:540:401:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:controls and provide us with evidence on how the inclusion of various types of time-varying controls
24:721:62718:22:22:72:172:379:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:affects the estimates.
24:722:62740:22:22:88:539:357:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Overall, there is robust evidence that minimum wage increases reduce the share of individuals
24:723:62833:22:22:71:540:335:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with low family incomes. For family income cutoffs between 0.50 and 1.25 (i.e., between 50 and 125
24:724:62931:22:22:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:percent of the official poverty threshold), and across the eight specifications, all 32 of the long run
24:725:63034:22:22:72:540:291:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimates (sum of the contemporaneous plus one, two and three year lags in minimum wage) are
24:726:63126:22:22:72:540:269:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:negative in sign, and 29 are statistically significant at least at the 10 percent level. This includes
24:727:63228:22:22:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:all of the poverty rate elasticities, which are statistically significant at the 5 percent level. While
24:728:63331:22:22:72:540:225:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:all of the estimates are sizable, the more saturated specifications tend to produce estimates with
24:729:63429:22:22:72:540:203:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:somewhat larger magnitudes. For example, the long run poverty elasticity estimate of -0.220 from
24:730:63525:22:22:72:540:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the two-way fixed effects estimate (panel A, column 1 of Figure 8) is the smallest in magnitude
24:731:63620:22:21:72:540:159:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:among all eight specifications. In contrast, the estimate with state-trends and division-period FE
24:732:63718:21:22:70:539:138:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(panel B, column 3) is the largest in magnitude (-0.459); the preferred specification used in the
24:733:63815:22:22:72:353:116:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:paper (panel B, column 4) produces an elasticity of -0.446.
24:734:63874:22:22:88:539:94:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 9 presents analogous evidence on equivalized family income elasticities for quantiles, and
24:735:63971:22:0:72:540:72:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:shows robust evidence across all 8 specifications that minimum wages lead to at least moderate
25:736:64067:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:increases in incomes for the bottom 20 percent of the equivalized family income distribution. (Online
25:737:64168:22:22:71:541:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Appendix Table B.4 reports the full set of estimates and standard errors.) Of the 32 estimates,
25:738:64263:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:all are positive in sign, and 24 are statistically significant at least at the 10 percent level. The 16
25:739:64366:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimates for the 10th and the 15th quantiles range between 0.152 and 0.430, and all are statistically
25:740:64468:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:significant at least at the 10 percent level. As before, the two-way fixed effects specification (panel
25:741:64571:22:22:71:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A, column 1) provides the smallest estimated magnitudes, and the inclusion of division-specific year
25:742:64671:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:effects and state-specific Great-Recession controls tend to increase the size of the estimates. These
25:743:64772:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:patterns are as expected, since the elasticities for the family income quantiles are simply rescaled
25:744:64872:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:semi-elasticities for the proportions below alternative income-to-needs cutoffs, and the rescaling
25:745:64970:22:22:72:280:511:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:factors are common across specifications.19
25:746:65013:22:22:88:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The range of estimates raises the issue of model selection. There is ana prioricase for using
25:747:65106:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:richer controls that better account for time-varying heterogeneity across states. Allowing for regional
25:748:65209:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:shocks and state-specific trends receives strong support in existing work. For example, Allegretto
25:749:65307:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:et al. (2017) show that the inclusion of these controls mitigates contamination from pre-existing
25:750:65404:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:trends when it comes to estimating the effect of minimum wages on teen employment. They also
25:751:65496:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:provide evidence that synthetic control methods tend to put substantially more weight on nearby
25:752:65591:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:states in constructing a control group, providing additional validity to the intuition that nearby
25:753:65689:22:22:72:542:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:states are better controls. One argument against using more saturated models is the loss of precision:
25:754:65791:22:22:72:539:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that they may lack the statistical power to detect an effect.20However, while the standard errors
25:755:65888:22:22:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for the most saturated specifications 8 are larger, the 95% confidence intervals for that specification
25:756:65991:22:22:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:does not contain the point estimates using specification 1 for 75 and 100 percent of the federal
25:757:66087:22:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:poverty threshold. In other words, there is strong indication that the differences in estimates across
25:758:66189:22:22:72:527:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the two specifications are not driven primarily by the imprecision of the more saturated model.
25:759:66284:22:22:88:539:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Beyond this, I consider two types of falsification exercises for model selection. First, I use
25:760:66378:22:30:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the leading values as a falsification test, analogous to tests used in Dube et al. (2010), Allegretto
25:761:66479:30:15:83:539:152:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:19Online Appendix Table B.5 additionally presents family income elasticities using the broader income definition
25:762:66591:15:11:72:540:137:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:including tax credits and non-cash transfers. Averaging across all specifications, the long run estimates for these
25:763:66706:11:11:72:540:126:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:quantiles using the expanded definition are about 60% as large as when using pre-tax cash income, which is similar to
25:764:66823:11:7:72:314:115:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:the 66% estimate I find in the preferred specification above.
25:765:66884:7:15:83:539:108:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:20A second rationale for excluding covariates is that some of them are “bad controls” in the sense of blocking a
25:766:66996:15:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:causal pathway between the treatment and the outcome. As I discussed above, the state-specific linear trends may
25:767:67108:11:10:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:constitute a problem if there are delayed effects of the policy, but I address this issue by including three annual lags in
25:768:67231:10:0:72:135:72:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:minimum wage.
26:769:67246:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:et al. (2011) and Allegretto et al. (2013). To be clear, the medium and long run estimates do not
26:770:67343:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:include the leading coefficient, so they net out any level differences in the outcome just prior to the
26:771:67446:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:minimum wage increase. However, since a non-zero leading coefficient provides an indication of the
26:772:67544:22:22:71:541:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:violation of parallel trends, such a test can help us assess the validity of particular specifications.
26:773:67647:22:22:71:539:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The results are shown in Table 6. They indicate that specifications 1, 2, 5, 6 all produce positive
26:774:67746:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:leads for the proportion below one-half the poverty line, and these are statistically significant at
26:775:67846:22:22:72:542:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the 5 percent level. Specification 1 also produces positive leads for 1.75 times poverty threshold.
26:776:67945:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In contrast, specifications 3, 4 and 7 tend to produce negative leads for 0.75 times the poverty
26:777:68041:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:threshold. Considering the full range of cutoffs, the most saturated specification 8 usually performs
26:778:68142:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the best when it comes to the leading values falsification test: it is the only specification where
26:779:68241:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:none of the leading coefficients are statistically significant; moreover, this is mostly driven by the
26:780:68343:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:small size of the coefficients and not from a greater imprecision. For example, the absolute value of
26:781:68444:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the mean of all leads in specification 8 is 0.081, while the other specifications range between 0.083
26:782:68545:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and 0.194. Overall, this suggests the most saturated specification may be able to guard against
26:783:68640:22:22:72:487:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:pre-existing trends throughout the income distribution better than less saturated ones.
26:784:68727:22:22:88:539:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In addition, we should not expect minimum wages to affect the proportion earning under 3, 3.5
26:785:68820:22:22:71:539:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:or 4 times the poverty threshold, which roughly corresponds to the 50th, 57th and 64th percentiles
26:786:68918:22:22:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the family income distribution in the national sample. Therefore, reliable specifications should
26:787:69017:22:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:produce estimates for these cutoffs that are small or close to zero. The bottom panel B of Table 6
26:788:69115:22:22:72:542:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:reports the long run elasticities for shares below these middle and upper income cutoffs. In general,
26:789:69216:22:22:72:542:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:none of the specifications produce statistically significant long run effects, which is reassuring.
26:790:69315:22:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:However, the most saturated specification produces the smallest magnitudes: the absolute value of
26:791:69412:22:22:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the mean for all cutoffs is 0.012 for specification 8, as compared to a range between 0.010 and 0.070
26:792:69513:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for the other specifications. Overall, the most saturated specification 8 performs very well on the
26:793:69612:22:22:72:464:182:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:falsification exercises, while the results from the intermediate specifications vary.21
26:794:69699:22:30:88:539:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Therefore, based both ona priorigrounds as including the richest set of controls for time-varying
26:795:69796:30:15:83:540:130:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:21Additional results (not reported in the tables) also suggests that the saturated specification 8 is more robust
26:796:69909:15:11:72:540:115:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:to exclusion of the state level controls. Excluding these controls produces a long run poverty elasticity (standard
26:797:70024:11:11:72:540:104:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:error) of -0.397 (0.157) for the saturated model, close to the original elasticity of -0.446 (0.137). In contrast, the
26:798:70142:11:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:two-way FE estimate is substantially smaller in magnitude when these controls are left out: -0.062(0.087) instead of
26:799:70258:11:10:70:539:82:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:-0.220 (0.084). To the extent unobservables are correlated with observable controls, these results suggests that more
26:800:70375:10:0:72:304:72:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:saturated specification is better able to account for them.
27:801:70436:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:heterogeneity, as well as its performance on the falsification tests, I use the saturated model to be
27:802:70537:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the preferred specification. At the same time, I recognize that reasonable observers may disagree on
27:803:70637:22:22:71:539:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:which specification is the most reliable, and may place somewhat different weights on the evidence
27:804:70735:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:associated with each specification. For this reason, in this paper I report the range of key estimates
27:805:70837:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:across all eight specifications, which allows readers to put more weight on various specifications
27:806:70935:22:22:72:197:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:based on their own priors.
27:807:70961:22:22:88:539:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:While the specifications in Table 2 include leads and lags in minimum wages, in much of the
27:808:71052:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:literature, estimates come from static models with just a contemporaneous minimum wage. To assess
27:809:71149:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the difference this might make, in Table 7 I report estimates from a static model for the poverty
27:810:71246:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rate. In every set of controls, the minimum wage elasticity from the static model is smaller in
27:811:71341:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:magnitude than either the medium or long run elasticities from the dynamic model. On average, the
27:812:71438:22:22:72:542:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:contemporaneous elasticity from the static model is less than half the size of the long run estimate.
27:813:71539:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:For example, the static two-way fixed effects specification (column 1) that is most commonly used
27:814:71636:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the literature produces an estimate of -0.074, not statistically distinguishable from zero. It also
27:815:71738:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:has a positive leading coefficient of 0.072, although not statistically significant. This subjects the
27:816:71840:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:static elasticity to a positive bias. Indeed, if we estimate a regression with a leading minimum wage
27:817:71941:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in addition to the contemporaneous minimum wage, the magnitude of the minimum wage elasticity
27:818:72034:22:22:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:doubles to -0.144 with a standard error of 0.064, rendering it statistically significant (results not
27:819:72135:22:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:shown in the table). The addition of lags raise the magnitude further, with the long run estimate
27:820:72232:22:22:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:being -0.220. To summarize, the static two-way FE estimate appears to be biased towards zero both
27:821:72329:22:22:72:483:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:due to pre-existing trends, and due to missing some of the lagged effects of the policy.
27:822:72417:22:22:88:541:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:What are the relative contributions of: (1) using a dynamic model, (2) including division-
27:823:72507:22:22:71:539:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:year effects, (3) including Great Recession-state effects, and (4) including state-specific trends in
27:824:72608:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:explaining the gap between the the static, two-way fixed effects estimate (-0.074) and the long
27:825:72703:22:22:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:run estimate from the most saturated model (-0.446)? Any decomposition of these four factors
27:826:72795:22:21:71:540:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:will depend on the order in which they are implemented. There are exactly4!  =  24different
27:827:72886:21:22:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:orderings for incrementally changing each of these four factors going from the static version of
27:828:72982:22:22:72:540:117:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:specification 1 to the dynamic version of specification 8, and each of these orderings provides a
27:829:73079:22:22:72:540:95:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:different decomposition. Averaging across these 24 orderings, the average incremental contribution
27:830:73177:22:0:72:540:73:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of these four factors (in the same order as above) are: (1) 44%, (2) 41%, (3) 18%, and (4) -3%. Use
28:831:73278:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the dynamic model (both netting out the lead, and considering long run effects) is the biggest
28:832:73375:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:source of difference, while controls for regional and business cycle heterogeneity are important as
28:833:73474:22:22:71:539:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:well. Use of state-specific trends appears to be the least important of these, at least when considering
28:834:73578:22:46:72:197:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the poverty rate elasticity.
28:835:73606:46:32:72:170:597:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:4  Discussion
28:836:73619:32:22:71:541:565:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:There is robust evidence that minimum wage increases over the past 30 years have boosted pre-tax-
28:837:73716:22:22:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and-transfer incomes at the bottom of the income distribution. Across specifications with alternative
28:838:73817:22:22:72:540:521:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:assumptions about the appropriate counterfactual, I find that minimum wages reduce the shares
28:839:73910:22:22:71:539:499:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with family incomes below 50, 75, 100 and 125 percent of the federal poverty threshold. The long run
28:840:74010:22:22:71:541:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:poverty rate elasticities range between -0.220 and -0.459, and all of these are statistically significant.
28:841:74116:22:22:72:540:455:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:I also find that a higher minimum wage improves the family income distribution in the sense of
28:842:74210:22:22:72:540:433:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:first order stochastic dominance. The clearest increases are for the 10th and 15th quantiles, with
28:843:74308:22:22:72:540:411:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:elasticities ranging between 0.152 and 0.430 across alternative models. While these results hold
28:844:74404:22:22:72:540:389:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:across a range of specifications, the preferred specification with a rich set of controls suggest an
28:845:74504:22:22:72:540:367:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:elasticity of around 0.359 for the 10th quantile of family incomes. Overall, around a third of the
28:846:74602:22:22:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:income increases resulting from minimum wage changes accrue to those in the bottom 15 percent
28:847:74695:22:21:72:540:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the family income distribution (roughly corresponding to those with incomes under the federal
28:848:74791:21:22:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:poverty level), while around 80 percent accrue to those in the bottom third of the family income
28:849:74887:22:22:72:540:280:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:distribution. At the same time, I also find evidence that there are sizable offsets in public assistance
28:850:74991:22:22:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in response to minimum wage gains. For those in the bottom fifth of the distribution, around 30%
28:851:75087:22:22:72:540:236:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the income gains are offset through reductions in non-cash-transfers as well as tax credits. These
28:852:75188:22:22:72:540:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:offsets seem to be the largest near the federal poverty threshold—consistent with losses in eligibility
28:853:75291:22:22:72:203:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in programs such as SNAP.
28:854:75316:22:22:88:539:170:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:What do these estimates imply about the likely impact on poverty from an increase in the
28:855:75404:22:22:72:540:148:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:federal minimum wage from the current $7.25/hour to, say, $12/hour? Taking into account the state
28:856:75501:22:22:72:540:126:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:minimum wages as of January 2017 suggests that this policy would raise the effective minimum
28:857:75593:22:22:71:539:104:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:wage—i.e., the maximum of federal or state standard—by 41 percent (or 0.34 log points). Using the
28:858:75690:22:0:71:539:82:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:long run minimum wage elasticity for the poverty rate of -0.446 from the preferred specification and
29:859:75792:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a 12.7 percent poverty rate among the non-elderly population in 2016 suggests a 1.9 percentage
29:860:75886:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:point reduction in the poverty rate from this minimum wage increase. Given the roughly 270 million
29:861:75984:22:22:72:542:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:non-elderly Americans in 2016, this translates into 6.16 million fewer individuals living in poverty.
29:862:76085:22:22:71:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We can also expect the same minimum wage increase to raise family incomes by 12.2 percent at the
29:863:76181:22:22:71:541:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:10th quantile of the equivalized family income distribution in the long run. For the 10th quantile,
29:864:76280:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:this translates into an annual income increase of $2,140; after accounting for the offset due to
29:865:76376:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:reduced tax credits and transfers, this amounts to an increase of $1,826.22Therefore, the increase
29:866:76474:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the federal minimum wage can play an important role in reducing poverty and raising family
29:867:76567:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:incomes at the bottom. To put this in context, Hoynes et al. (2006) estimate that EITC reduces
29:868:76661:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:non-elderly poverty rate by around 1.7 percentage points. She also finds that cash transfers (means
29:869:76760:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tested and non-means tested) cash transfers reduce it by as much as 3.8 percentage point, while
29:870:76855:22:22:72:541:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:non-cash transfers (other than Medicaid) reduce it by around 0.9 percentage point.23In other words,
29:871:76954:22:21:71:539:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a substantial increase in the minimum wage would likely have an impact on the non-elderly poverty
29:872:77051:21:22:72:362:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rate comparable to means tested public assistance programs.
29:873:77110:22:22:88:539:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The income estimates in this paper do not factor in changes in prices due to minimum wage
29:874:77199:22:22:71:539:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:increase. However, the expected increase in the overall price level from this policy is quite small
29:875:77298:22:22:71:541:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:when compared to the income gains for those at the bottom of the income distribution. For example,
29:876:77396:22:22:71:539:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in a simulation study using input-output tables, MaCurdy (2015) calculated that the bottom quintile
29:877:77495:22:22:71:539:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:faced a 0.5 percent increase in prices from the 21% increase in minimum wage in 1996—an elasticity
29:878:77593:22:22:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of around 0.02. The preferred long run elasticity for the 10th quantile after public offsets is around
29:879:77695:22:22:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:0.256, or more than an order of magnitude larger. Therefore, netting out the likely price increase
29:880:77793:22:22:71:539:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:would not substantially affect the estimates of the real income gains for the bottom quintile of the
29:881:77893:22:22:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:income distribution. However, it does mean that some (possibly much) of these income gains at the
29:882:77990:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:bottom are likely borne by middle and upper income consumers through small increases in prices.
29:883:78085:22:30:88:539:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The estimates in this paper tend to suggest bigger increases in bottom incomes in response to
29:884:78178:30:15:83:539:152:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:22If we take the range of estimates from all specifications, the proposed minimum wage changes can be expected
29:885:78288:15:11:72:540:137:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:to reduce the poverty rate among the non-elderly population by 0.950 and 1.98 percentage points, hence reducing
29:886:78399:11:11:72:540:126:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:the number of non-elderly individuals living in poverty by somewhere between 3.03 and 6.33 million. For the 10th
29:887:78511:11:11:72:540:115:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:quantile of family incomes, this translates to an annual income increase ranging between 5.2 and 14.5 percent, or
29:888:78624:11:11:72:540:104:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:between $905 and $2,937. After accounting for offsets due to lost public assistance, the income increases would range
29:889:78741:11:7:72:175:93:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:between $657 and $2,790.
29:890:78765:7:14:83:539:86:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:23The estimates for means tested and non-means tested are reported separately in Hoynes et al. (2006); therefore
29:891:78877:14:0:72:395:72:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:the sum of the effects (3.8 percentage point may) may overstate the net impact.
30:892:78958:0:22:72:541:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:minimum wage increases than some simulation based studies such as Sabia and Burkhauser (2010)
30:893:79051:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:or CBO (2014), or MaCurdy (2015). There are a number of problems in using the cross sectional
30:894:79144:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:relationship between reported wages and family incomes to simulate how the gains from a minimum
30:895:79239:22:22:71:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:wage increase will be distributed. Most obviously, we would need to make assumptions about how
30:896:79333:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:behavior changes: this includes employer hiring and firing behavior, as well as workers’ job search
30:897:79432:22:22:72:542:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:behavior and labor force participation, which could vary by family income and other characteristics.
30:898:79532:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In addition, simulations such as these face a number of challenges which tend to suggest a weaker
30:899:79629:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:link between low wages and low family income than is truly the case. A key concern is measurement
30:900:79726:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:error in both wages and other sources of incomes (which includes wage and salary incomes of other
30:901:79823:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:family members). It is a straightforward point that measurement error in reported wages leads to an
30:902:79922:22:22:72:541:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:attenuation in the measured relationship between workers’ wages and family incomes.24As a result,
30:903:80019:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:simulating wage changes for those earning around the minimum wage will typically suggest smaller
30:904:80115:22:21:72:542:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:effects on poverty and smaller income increases at the bottom quantiles than would occur in reality.
30:905:80215:21:22:71:539:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This is because (1) some of the individuals with high reported wages in low income families are
30:906:80310:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:actually low wage earners, and (2) some of the low wage earners reporting high levels of other sources
30:907:80412:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of income (including spousal wage and salary income) in reality are in poorer families. A related
30:908:80509:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:practical issue that arises from this is the treatment of sub-minimum wage workers. For example, in
30:909:80608:22:22:72:541:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:their simulations of raising the minimum wage from $5.70 to $7.25, Sabia and Burkhauser (2010)
30:910:80702:22:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:assume that all those with reported hourly earnings below $5.55 will receive no wage increases
30:911:80796:22:22:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:because they are in the “uncovered sector.” Moreover, they assume that no one above $7.25 will
30:912:80890:22:22:72:542:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:get a raise. These particular assumptions seem implausible due to both measurement error issues,
30:913:80986:22:22:72:542:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as well as the well known “lighthouse effect” phenomenon whereby even uncovered sector workers’
30:914:81081:22:17:71:539:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:wages are affected by minimum wages (Card and Krueger 1995; Boeri et al. 2011). Moreover, as
30:915:81173:17:15:83:540:209:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:24Consider the relationship between own wage income,W, and family incomeF=W+I, whereIrepresents other
30:916:81274:15:12:72:540:194:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:incomes (possibly others’ wages). The linear approximation to the true relationship is represented by the population
30:917:81390:12:14:72:540:182:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:regressionF=βW+u. Note thatβ=Cov(W+I,W)V(W)= 1 +σWIσ2W. So if wages are at all positively correlated with other
30:918:81501:14:11:72:283:168:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:sources of family incomes,I, as is likely, thenβ >1.
30:919:81553:11:11:81:540:157:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:Now consider the case whereWis measured with error, so that ̃W=W+e, and ̃F=W+I+eare the observed
30:920:81649:11:11:71:539:146:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:wage and family income. This is slightly different from the textbook classical measurement error case because the
30:921:81762:11:11:72:539:135:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:measurement error,e, affects both the independent and dependent variables. Substituting the reported values into the
30:922:81878:11:12:72:508:124:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:true regression equation produces ̃F−e=β( ̃W−e). Rearranging, we have ̃F=β ̃W+ (1−β)e=β ̃W+  ̃u.
30:923:81974:12:17:81:539:112:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f18:Note that ̃β=Cov( ̃F, ̃W)V( ̃W)is the estimate from a population regression of ̃Fon ̃W. Substituting ̃F=β ̃W+(1−β)e
30:924:82089:17:0:72:294:95:9:g_d0_f7:6:g_d0_f12:into the expression for ̃βwe have ̃β=β+ (1−β)σ
30:925:82135:0:11:295:297:102:5:g_d0_f22:5:g_d0_f21:2e
30:926:82137:11:9:282:539:91:6:g_d0_f12:9:g_d0_f7:σ2w+σ2e,which will be attenuated towards zero ifβ >1, which
30:927:82196:9:10:71:539:82:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:is true if wages are at all positively correlated with other sources of family incomes. The attenuation will also be
30:928:82312:10:0:72:331:72:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:proportionate to the share of wage variance that is due to error.
31:929:82379:0:22:71:539:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Autor et al. (2016) show, effects of the minimum wage extend up to the 20th percentile of the wage
31:930:82477:22:22:72:539:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:distribution, which would be unlikely absent some spillovers.25Therefore, results from simulation
31:931:82574:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:studies may not provide reliable guidance in assessing the impact of minimum wages on bottom
31:932:82666:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:incomes, making it critical for us to consider actual evidence from past minimum wage changes
31:933:82759:22:22:71:228:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:when analyzing policy proposals.
31:934:82791:22:22:88:539:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:While minimum wages tend to raise family incomes at the bottom, they also tend to substitute
31:935:82883:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:earnings for public assistance. Were we to assess public policies strictly based on their efficacy
31:936:82981:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in reducing post-tax and transfer poverty, the offsets through reduced tax credits and non-cash
31:937:83076:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:transfers further suggests a lower effectiveness of minimum wages in raising post-tax-and-transfer
31:938:83174:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:incomes. Policies like cash transfers, SNAP, and tax credits are better targeted to raise incomes for
31:939:83275:22:22:72:322:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:those at the very bottom of the income distribution.
31:940:83327:22:22:88:539:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:At the same time, there are positive aspects of a policy that reduces public assistance via
31:941:83418:22:21:71:541:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:increased earnings. First, a reduction in public benefits like SNAP can be efficiency enhancing,
31:942:83514:21:22:71:541:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:since in principle these programs are funded using taxation which can have deadweight losses.
31:943:83607:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Hendren (2014) finds that that lower pre-tax incomes at the bottom has an efficiency cost due to
31:944:83703:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:such transfers: a $1 of surplus accruing to the bottom quintile of the income distribution can be
31:945:83800:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:transformed into a $1.15 surplus for everyone. A corollary to that argument is that by reducing
31:946:83895:22:22:72:539:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:such transfers, minimum wages can have an efficiency-enhancing attribute.26Alternatively, if there
31:947:83993:22:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are deadweight losses from the minimum wage policy, the reduced public assistance will tend to
31:948:84087:22:22:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:mitigate such distortions. Additionally, there is increasing recognition that individuals may not see
31:949:84188:22:22:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:labor earnings and tax credits/transfers as perfect substitutes, and may prefer to receive a higher
31:950:84287:22:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:compensation for their work than what is often perceived as a government transfer. Relatedly, voters
31:951:84387:22:22:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:may prefer “pre-distributive” policies like minimum wages over “re-distributive” ones using tax and
31:952:84486:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:transfers even when they are concerned with inequality—in part because of low levels of trust in
31:953:84582:22:22:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:government (Kuziemko et al. (2015)). All of these factors add to the cost of pre-tax inequality
31:954:84677:22:19:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and raises the benefits of a policy like minimum wage that affects the pre-tax-and-transfer income
31:955:84775:19:15:83:540:141:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:25Autor, Manning and Smith also highlight how measurement error in wages and wage spillovers have similar
31:956:84880:15:11:72:540:126:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:implications about the effects of minimum on the observed wage distribution. This is an interesting point which affects
31:957:84999:11:11:72:540:115:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:the interpretation of the effects on higher wage quantiles. But for our purposes here, regardless of the interpretation of
31:958:85121:11:11:72:540:104:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:these effects as true spillovers or measurement error spillovers, ignoring them will tend to downward bias the predicted
31:959:85241:11:7:72:310:93:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:effects of minimum wages on poverty in simulation studies.
31:960:85299:7:14:83:541:86:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:26Moreover, the public savings afforded by a higher minimum wage could be used to expand program generosity,
31:961:85407:14:0:72:237:72:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:further enhancing income at the bottom.
32:962:85448:0:22:72:131:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:distribution.
32:963:85461:22:22:88:539:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Overall, motivations of voters and policy makers in raising minimum wage policies tend to
32:964:85550:22:22:71:539:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:go beyond reducing poverty. For example, using data from the 2016 YouGov Common Content
32:965:85637:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Pre-Election Survey of voters (N=1,000), I find that voters’ preferred level of federal minimum wage
32:966:85737:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:barely changes (from $10.45 to $10.18) if there were also to be sufficient tax credits to eliminate
32:967:85836:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:poverty among working families. (See Online Appendix Figure B.4.) This is consistent with the
32:968:85929:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:observation that the popular support for minimum wages is in part fueled by a desire to raise
32:969:86022:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:earnings of low and moderate income families more broadly, and by concerns of fairness that seek to
32:970:86121:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:limit the extent of wage inequality (Green and Harrison, 2010), or employers’ exercise of market
32:971:86217:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:power (Fehr and Fischbacher 2004; Kahneman et al. 1986). The findings from this paper suggest
32:972:86310:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that attaining these goals is also consistent with at least a moderate increase in family incomes, and
32:973:86412:22:0:72:503:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a reduced reliance on public assistance for those at the bottom of the income distribution.

54:1401:127678:29:33:71:467:680:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:wages, family incomes and poverty (not for publication)
54:1402:127733:33:22:72:540:647:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In this online appendix, I review the key papers on the topic of minimum wages and family income
54:1403:127829:22:22:72:540:625:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:distribution based on U.S. data, and discuss their findings and limitations. My primary goal here is
54:1404:127929:22:22:72:540:603:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to provide a quantitative summary of the existing evidence, focusing on the poverty rate elasticity as
54:1405:128031:22:22:72:540:581:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the most commonly estimated distributional statistic. I begin by describing the process of selecting
54:1406:128131:22:22:72:542:559:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:studies for this review. First, I only consider peer-reviewed publications since the early 1990s, i.e.,
54:1407:128234:22:22:72:540:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the beginning of the “new economics of the minimum wage” literature. Second, I only include
54:1408:128325:22:22:72:542:515:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:studies that report estimates for some statistic based on family incomes (such as poverty, quantiles,
54:1409:128426:22:22:72:539:493:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:etc), and not other outcomes such as utilization of public assistance.27I review one additional
54:1410:128521:22:22:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:paper (Neumark and Wascher 2002) that I do not include in my quantitative summary. As I explain
54:1411:128616:22:21:72:540:449:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:below, their estimates on gross flows in and out of poverty do not have a clear implication for net
54:1412:128715:21:22:72:540:428:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:changes in poverty. Third, studies are included only when they empirically estimate the effect of
54:1413:128812:22:22:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:minimum wages, as opposed to simulate such effects. This selection process yields 14 studies, 13 of
54:1414:128911:22:22:71:539:384:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:which are used in my quantitative summary. I note that a recent book by Belman and Wolfson
54:1415:129001:22:22:70:539:362:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(2014) provides a review of many of the same papers. Finally, I note that seven of these 14 papers
54:1416:129099:22:22:71:541:340:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:were also reviewed by Neumark and Wascher in their 2008 book,Minimum Wages; Dube (2011)
54:1417:129186:22:22:72:312:318:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:discusses some of the shortcomings of that review.
54:1418:129236:22:22:88:539:296:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:As a way to quantify the existing evidence, Table A.1 reports the key estimates from the 13
54:1419:129327:22:22:72:540:274:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:studies for which I could construct an elasticity of the poverty rate with respect to the minimum
54:1420:129424:22:22:71:539:252:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:wage. When the original estimates are not reported as poverty rate elasticities, I use information in
54:1421:129525:22:22:72:539:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the paper to convert them (and standard errors) to that format for comparability.28To minimize
54:1422:129619:22:22:72:541:208:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the impact of subjective judgment, I have used the following guidelines for selecting estimates. (1.)
54:1423:129720:22:23:72:540:186:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:I report estimates for all of the demographic groups studied in each paper; the sole exception is
54:1424:129817:23:15:83:540:163:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:27I do not include Page et al. (2005) in my quantitative summary as they do not consider the impact on family
54:1425:129926:15:11:72:540:148:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:incomes generally, but rather only on welfare caseload. However, I note that this study stands out methodologically in
54:1426:130044:11:11:72:540:137:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:using a wide array of specifications, some of which are similar to the ones used in this paper, such as state-specific
54:1427:130162:11:11:72:540:126:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:trends and state-specific business cycle controls. The authors tend to find a positive impact of minimum wages on
54:1428:130275:11:11:71:541:115:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:welfare caseload, which appears to go against the tenor of my findings, especially the reductions in non-cash transfers.
54:1429:130395:11:11:72:540:104:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:However, as they point out, their estimates seem to vary based on the sample period. Moreover, since cash income
54:1430:130507:11:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:used in this paper (and in official poverty estimates) include public assistance, it is possible for both poverty to fall
54:1431:130628:11:7:72:185:82:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:and welfare caseload to rise.
54:1432:130657:7:0:83:539:75:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:28For simplicity, I convert the standard errors to elasticities using the same conversion factor as the point estimate.
55:1433:130778:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for workers, since minimum wages can affect who is in that group and lead to sample selection
55:1434:130871:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:problems. (2.) When a study uses multiple econometric specifications, I include all of them in
55:1435:130965:22:22:71:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Table A.1, except: (a.) the handful of estimates that did not include state and time fixed effects (or
55:1436:131067:22:22:72:542:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:equivalent) as controls; (b.) estimates from sub-periods reported in Addison and Blackburn (1999).
55:1437:131165:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Overall, these guidelines lead me to report 78 elasticities in Table A.1, which represent either all or
55:1438:131268:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:nearly all of the estimates of minimum wage impact on the poverty rate available in each of the
55:1439:131363:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:papers. Finally, besides the poverty rate, the table also reports estimates for some of the other
55:1440:131460:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:distributional statistics that are reported in the papers, including elasticities for proportions earning
55:1441:131565:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:below cutoffs other than the official poverty line, family earnings quantiles, and the squared poverty
55:1442:131667:22:22:72:92:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:gap.
55:1443:131671:22:22:88:539:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In my discussion below, I mostly use a chronological order, except for the three papers by
55:1444:131761:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Neumark and Wascher which I discuss together at the end. After reviewing the individual papers, I
55:1445:131858:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:provide summaries of the poverty rate elasticities in the literature. I also discuss and compare the
55:1446:131958:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:individual estimates for specific demographic groups when I present results from my own subgroup
55:1447:132054:22:22:72:179:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:analysis in section 3.1.
55:1448:132078:22:22:88:539:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Card and Krueger (1995) consider the short run impact of the 1990 federal minimum wage
55:1449:132164:22:22:71:539:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:increase on the poverty rate for those 16 years or older, and regress the change in the state-level
55:1450:132263:22:22:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:poverty rate between 1989 and 1991 on the the proportion earning below the new federal wage in
55:1451:132357:22:22:71:539:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1989 (“fraction affected”). While they do not report minimum wage elasticitiesper se(reporting
55:1452:132451:22:22:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:instead the coefficient on “fraction affected”), I calculate the implicit elasticities for the poverty
55:1453:132553:22:22:72:539:270:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:rate and family earnings percentiles with respect to the minimum wage for ease of comparability.29
55:1454:132651:22:22:71:541:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Their bivariate specification has an implied minimum wage elasticity for the poverty rate of -0.39,
55:1455:132750:22:22:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:but controls for employment and regional trends reduce the overall elasticity in magnitude to the
55:1456:132847:22:22:72:542:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:range (-0.36, -0.08), and the estimates are not statistically significant at the conventional levels.
55:1457:132948:22:22:71:539:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:They also find that the 10th percentile of the (unadjusted) family earnings distribution responds
55:1458:133045:22:30:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:positively to the minimum wage increase, with an implied elasticity between 0.28 (bivariate) and
55:1459:133141:30:15:83:540:130:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:29The mean of “fraction affected” is 0.074, the minimum wage increased by 26.9% in 1990, and the average poverty
55:1460:133253:15:11:72:540:115:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:rate in their sample is reported to be 10.6% during 1989-1991. Starting with a coefficient of -0.15 from a regression of
55:1461:133373:11:11:70:539:104:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:“fraction affected” on the proportion under poverty, I multiply this coefficient by a conversion factor of0.0740.269to obtain
55:1462:133498:11:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:a minimum wage semi-elasticity for the proportion under poverty, and then I further divide by 0.135 to obtain the
55:1463:133611:11:10:72:539:82:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:minimum wage elasticity for the proportion under poverty:−0.15×0.0740.269×10.106=−0.39.I use the same conversion
55:1464:133723:10:0:72:489:72:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:factor to obtain the standard errors, and perform analogous conversions for family earnings percentiles.
56:1465:133829:0:22:72:539:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:0.20 (with controls); these are statistically significant at conventional levels.30A major limitation
56:1466:133930:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of this analysis is that the estimates are imprecise. This is mainly due to the very short panel
56:1467:134026:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:structure. For example, the 95 percent confidence interval associated with the poverty rate elasticity
56:1468:134128:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in their most saturated model is quite wide: (-0.65, 0.49). Other limitations include the use of the
56:1469:134228:22:22:70:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:“fraction affected” measure of the treatment: it is possible that there were different latent trends
56:1470:134328:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in poverty across low- and high-wage states. Subsequent work has mostly used as the treatment
56:1471:134421:22:22:72:499:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:measure the log of the effective minimum wage (originally suggested in Card et al. 1994).
56:1472:134510:22:22:88:539:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Addison and Blackburn (1999) consider teens, young adults, and junior high dropouts between
56:1473:134601:22:22:71:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1983-1996. Using state-year aggregated data and two-way fixed effects, they find sizable poverty
56:1474:134697:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rate elasticities for teens and junior high dropouts in the range of (-0.61, -0.17), with an average of
56:1475:134800:22:22:70:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:-0.43. They find more modest sized estimates for young adults (an average elasticity of -0.21). Their
56:1476:134901:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimates for teens and junior high dropouts are often statistically significant, but the estimates are
56:1477:135004:22:21:72:539:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:likely less precise than reported since they do not account for serial correlation.31Additionally, their
56:1478:135108:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:teen results are somewhat sensitive to the inclusion of state trends, as shown in Table A.1. Morgan

56:1480:135299:22:22:71:540:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1987 and 1996, and find a poverty rate elasticity of -0.39. Their estimate is statistically significant
56:1481:135402:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:using panel-corrected standard errors (which however may be inadequate). Stevans and Sessions
56:1482:135495:22:22:70:539:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(2001) consider the overall poverty rate in the 1984-1998 period; their most comparable estimate is
56:1483:135594:22:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from a two-way fixed effects model, and appears to yield an elasticity of -0.28.32Gundersen and
56:1484:135689:22:22:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Ziliak (2004) consider the impact of a variety of social policies on the poverty rate and the squared
56:1485:135790:22:22:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:poverty gap using both post and pre-tax income data between 1981 and 2000. For the population
56:1486:135883:22:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:overall, they find a small overall poverty rate elasticity of -0.03, with a range of -0.02 to -0.06 across
56:1487:135989:22:22:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:demographic groups. However, they specifically control for the wage distribution, including the
56:1488:136084:22:22:72:542:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ratio of 80th-to-20th percentile wages. This inclusion of the inequality measures is problematic,
56:1489:136181:22:19:72:542:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as it could block the key channel through which minimum wages would actually reduce poverty,
56:1490:136273:19:15:83:539:163:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:30Because they are using state-aggregated data from only two periods, these results are not subject to the criticism
56:1491:136389:15:11:72:540:148:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:of using standard errors that are likely understated due to intraclass or serial correlation (Bertrand et al. 2004), a
56:1492:136507:11:7:72:440:137:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:problem which does affect numerous other papers in the literature as described in the text.
56:1493:136598:7:11:83:436:130:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:31The standard errors of the long-run estimates are derived from the reported p-values.
56:1494:136685:11:15:83:540:119:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:32I say “appears” because although Stevans and Sessions say they are estimating a log-log model, their Table 2
56:1495:136795:15:11:72:540:104:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:reports a “log of poverty rate” sample mean of 14.6, a “log of minimum wage” sample mean of 3.42, and a coefficient
56:1496:136910:11:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:on the log minimum of -1.18. These three statistics suggest that the estimated specification was actually in levels, so
56:1497:137029:11:10:72:539:82:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:that the implied elasticity is likely given by−1.18×3.4214.6=−0.28. I note additionally that their standard errors also
56:1498:137148:10:0:72:219:72:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:do not account for serial correlation.
57:1499:137188:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:namely raising wages at the lower end of the wage distribution.33Additionally, while their estimates
57:1500:137288:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are statistically significant, their standard errors are likely overstated since they do not account
57:1501:137388:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for serial correlation. DeFina (2008) uses state-aggregated data from 1991-2002 and finds that
57:1502:137482:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:minimum wages reduce child poverty in woman-headed families, including those headed by someone
57:1503:137576:22:22:71:541:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:without a college degree. The estimated poverty rate elasticities are -0.42 and -0.35, respectively;
57:1504:137676:22:22:71:542:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:while they are statistically significant, the standard errors also do not account for serial correlation.
57:1505:137781:22:22:88:539:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Burkhauser and Sabia (2007) examine the effects on state-level poverty rates for 16-64 year
57:1506:137872:22:22:72:542:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:olds and single mothers during the 1988-2003 period using specifications with two-way fixed effects.
57:1507:137972:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Depending on controls, their estimates of the poverty rate elasticity range between -0.08 and -0.19 for
57:1508:138075:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the population overall, and between -0.07 and -0.16 for single mothers. While none of the estimates
57:1509:138174:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are statistically significant, the point estimates are all negative, and the confidence intervals are
57:1510:138275:22:22:72:539:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:consistent with sizable effects.34In a follow-up study, Sabia and Burkhauser (2010) consider the
57:1511:138371:22:21:71:539:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:2003-2007 period and income cutoffs of 100, 125, and 150 percent of the federal poverty line for the
57:1512:138471:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:population of 16-64 year olds, and find little effect. This study is limited by a rather short sample
57:1513:138572:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:period. Since it is an update of their previous paper, it is unfortunate that they do not also report
57:1514:138673:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimates using the full sample (1988-2007) instead of just considering a five year period. While
57:1515:138770:22:22:72:538:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:their point estimate is small (-0.05), the 95 percent confidence interval is fairly wide (-0.34, 0.24).
57:1516:138873:22:22:88:539:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Sabia (2008) uses individual level CPS data from 1992-2005, and a two-way fixed effects
57:1517:138960:22:22:72:542:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:specification augmented with state-specific quadratic trends to study the effect on single mothers.
57:1518:139059:22:22:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:He finds statistically insignificant but again mostly negative and often sizable estimates, with a
57:1519:139157:22:22:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:poverty rate elasticity of -0.22 from his main specification; for single mothers without a high school
57:1520:139259:22:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:degree, the estimate is larger in magnitude (-0.28) while still not statistically significant. Sabia
57:1521:139359:22:22:72:541:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and Nielsen (2015) use the SIPP between 1996-2007 and find an overall point estimate of -0.31
57:1522:139452:22:22:70:541:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(without state-specific linear trends) or -0.03 (with trends). However, these are imprecise estimates,
57:1523:139554:22:22:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as the 95 percent confidence intervals are (-0.93, 0.30) and (-0.27, 0.22), respectively—the former
57:1524:139653:22:19:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:set is consistent with nearly all other estimates in the literature. The long-run point estimate is
57:1525:139752:19:15:83:539:141:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:33Another potentially problematic aspect of their methodology is the inclusion of lagged outcomes as controls along
57:1526:139867:15:11:71:539:126:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:with state fixed effects; they do state in a footnote that their results are robust to various IV strategies to account for
57:1527:139990:11:11:72:540:115:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:the bias. Furthermore, in contrast to other studies discussed here, Gundersen and Ziliak (2004) limit their sample to
57:1528:140107:11:7:72:320:104:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:families with some positive income (not necessarily earnings).
57:1529:140169:7:15:83:541:97:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:34Moreover, their estimates’ precision is likely overstated due their use of conventional (as opposed to clustered)
57:1530:140284:15:10:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:standard errors. Some of their estimates use a parametric serial correlation correction which may also be inadequate
57:1531:140400:10:0:70:234:72:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:(see Bertrand Duflo Mullainathan 2004).
58:1532:140441:0:22:72:539:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:negative (-0.245) with an even larger 95% confidence interval (-1.21, 0.71).35Their estimates also
58:1533:140539:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:appear to be sensitive to the inclusion of state-specific trends, but again, the imprecision of the
58:1534:140638:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimates makes it difficult to draw any firm conclusion. Overall, two of the four papers coauthored
58:1535:140738:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:by Burkhauser and/or Sabia suggest small to modest negative effects, while the other two produce
58:1536:140834:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:fairly imprecise or fragile estimates. However, the overall evidence from their papers does not rule
58:1537:140934:22:22:72:280:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:out moderate sized poverty rate elasticities.
58:1538:140979:22:22:88:539:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Sabia (2014) responds to an earlier version of this paper, and reports estimates for 16-64 year
58:1539:141074:22:22:71:539:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:olds using state-year aggregated data from 1979-2012. He estimates a static two-way fixed effects
58:1540:141171:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:model, as well as a static model with state-specific trends, division-period effects, and state-specific
58:1541:141275:22:22:72:542:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:recession effects: these controls are similar to what I use in this paper (and in the previous version).
58:1542:141379:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:His estimates for the static two-way fixed effects model is 0.06, while from the more saturated model
58:1543:141480:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is -0.16; neither is statistically significant. His exclusion of children is one likely reason his estimates
58:1544:141588:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are smaller in magnitude than what I find. But more importantly, the fact that the elasticity from
58:1545:141686:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the static two-way fixed effects model is small is similar to what I show in Table 7; not accounting
58:1546:141786:22:22:72:499:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for leading effects produces a positive bias, especially for the two-way fixed effects model.
58:1547:141879:22:22:88:541:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:David Neumark has authored three papers (two with coauthors) that are of particular relevance.
58:1548:141973:22:22:71:539:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Neumark and Wascher (2002) consider movements in and out of poverty by forming two-year panels
58:1549:142067:22:22:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of families with matched March CPS data between 1986 and 1995. Because they do not directly
58:1550:142158:22:22:72:542:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimate the effect of the policy on poverty rates, Table 1 does not include estimates from this paper.
58:1551:142261:22:22:71:539:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Their results seem to suggest that initially poor individuals are less likely to remain poor after a
58:1552:142361:22:22:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:minimum wage increase, while the initially non-poor are slightly more likely to enter poverty. They
58:1553:142460:22:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:interpret the greater churning as a negative attribute of minimum wages in creating “winners and
58:1554:142556:22:22:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:losers.” However, there are several major problems with the paper. First, the welfare implications of
58:1555:142657:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:their findings on flows are far from clear. For example, the greater churning might be a positive
58:1556:142754:22:22:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:attribute if it spreads both the gain and the pain more widely, and reduces the duration of poverty
58:1557:142853:22:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:spells. Second, their estimated effects on net flows into poverty (the difference between inflows and
58:1558:142954:21:22:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:outflows) are quite imprecise, and the standard errors are likely understated as they do not account
58:1559:143054:22:31:72:540:117:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for within-state correlations. They speculate that their results suggest that there was likely no effect
58:1560:143158:31:14:83:539:86:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:35Standard error of the long-run estimate is calculated by assuming the 1- and 2-year lagged minimum wages are
58:1561:143268:14:0:72:277:72:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:independent, as they do not report it in the paper.
59:1562:143321:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on the overall poverty rate, but this would have been easy to check using a regression where the
59:1563:143417:22:22:72:351:687:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:dependent variable is simply an indicator for being poor.36
59:1564:143476:22:22:88:539:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Neumark et al. (2005) is the only existing paper which attempts at an analysis of the impact of
59:1565:143571:22:22:72:542:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:minimum wages on the entire distribution of family incomes. Like Neumark and Wascher (2002),
59:1566:143663:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:they also use two-year panels of families between 1986 and 1995. They estimate the effect of discrete
59:1567:143764:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:minimum wage treatments on the distribution of the income-to-needs ratio, and their estimates
59:1568:143857:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:suggest that an increase in the minimum wage actually increases the fraction of the population in
59:1569:143954:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:poverty: they report a poverty rate elasticity of +0.39. This is the only paper in the literature that
59:1570:144056:22:22:72:542:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:I am aware of which finds such a poverty-increasing impact of the policy for the overall population,
59:1571:144156:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:so it is important to compare its methodology to other papers on the topic as well my approach
59:1572:144250:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:here. The authors are interested in estimating the counterfactual distribution of income-to-needs
59:1573:144347:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ratio for the treated state-years that experience a minimum wage increase. They implement a type
59:1574:144443:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of propensity score reweighting to adjust for demographic factors. Beyond this, however, there are
59:1575:144541:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:numerous non-standard aspects of their research design. Their method does not properly account
59:1576:144635:22:22:72:542:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for state and year fixed effects. They “mimic” state and year fixed effects by shrinking all families’
59:1577:144737:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:incomes by the proportionate change in the median income in that state (pooled over years) and also
59:1578:144836:22:22:72:539:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:by analogously shrinking the median change in that year (pooled over states).37This constitutes
59:1579:144931:22:22:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:an assumption that state and year effects are scale shifts that proportionately shrink the entire
59:1580:145028:22:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:family income distribution. In other words, they impose the assumption that various counterfactual
59:1581:145126:22:22:72:542:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:quantiles in states are moving proportionately to the median, which is an unattractive assumption,
59:1582:145224:22:22:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and much more restrictive than the inclusion of state and year dummies in a regression of the
59:1583:145317:22:22:72:539:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:poverty rate on minimum wages.38Additionally, they use anad hocadjustment in the change in
59:1584:145407:22:22:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:densities to account for the fact that some observations have both contemporaneous and lagged
59:1585:145500:22:30:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:increases.39These non-standard techniques raise serious questions about the study, especially since
59:1586:145599:30:15:83:539:174:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:36In general, looking at the impact of the treatment on year-to-year inflows and outflows does not tell us what its
59:1587:145714:15:11:72:540:159:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:impact is on the stock. In the long run (i.e, reaching a new steady state) the effect of the treatment on the in- and
59:1588:145831:11:7:72:422:148:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:outflows will have to be equal by definition, even if the stock is increased or decreased.
59:1589:145921:7:15:83:539:141:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:37They also report results from a specification without any time or state fixed effects at all, and the poverty rate
59:1590:146037:15:11:72:541:126:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:elasticity from that specification was very similar. Since I screen on specifications to include (or attempt to include)
59:1591:146157:11:7:72:373:115:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:state and time fixed effects, those estimates are not reported in Table A.1.
59:1592:146233:7:15:83:540:108:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:38In this paper, my distributional analysis allows the shares under all income cutoffs to have arbitrary time-invariant
59:1593:146352:15:11:72:541:93:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:differences by state and years, as well as time-varying differences by census divisions, state-specific recession years,
59:1594:146472:11:7:72:172:82:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:and state-specific trends.
59:1595:146498:7:0:83:518:75:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:39Their statistical inference does not account for clustering of standard errors, which are likely understated.
60:1596:146611:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:it stands out in terms of producing a sizable positive poverty rate elasticity. To my knowledge, no
60:1597:146710:22:22:72:542:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:one, including any of the authors, has used this methodology in any previous or subsequent paper.
60:1598:146807:22:22:88:539:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In contrast, Neumark (2016) uses a more conventional approach to study the effect of minimum
60:1599:146899:22:22:71:539:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:wages over the 1997-2006 period; this is a follow up to an earlier paper original paper Neumark and
60:1600:146998:22:22:71:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Wascher (2011), which used a similar methodology to study minimum wage and EITC effects on
60:1601:147088:22:22:71:539:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:21-44 year olds.40He also reports these estimates for sub-groups including single women, single
60:1602:147183:22:22:71:539:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:women with no more than a high school degree, and single black/Hispanic women with high school
60:1603:147277:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:or lesser education. Like most of the literature, he includes state and year fixed effects. He also
60:1604:147376:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:includes demographic and state-level controls similar to this paper, and reports estimate with and
60:1605:147474:22:22:71:209:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:without state-specific trends.
60:1606:147504:22:22:88:539:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:For the original group studied in Neumark and Wascher (2011) considered—21-44 year old family
60:1607:147597:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:heads or individuals—his results suggest a poverty rate elasticity of -0.22 without state-trends, and
60:1608:147698:22:21:70:539:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:-0.35 with trends. For a group constituting the majority of non-elderly adults, the evidence from
60:1609:147795:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Neumark (2016) suggests that minimum wages have a moderate-sized impact in reducing poverty
60:1610:147886:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and extreme poverty. When he adds older individuals (but not children), i.e., those 21 or older, the
60:1611:147986:22:22:72:542:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimates are -0.15 and -0.11, respectively. For single mothers, the estimates are -0.30 and -0.14,
60:1612:148085:22:22:72:542:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:respectively, without and with state trends. Most of the estimates are not statistically significant;
60:1613:148186:22:22:72:542:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:however, it is important to recall that these estimates are from a relatively short 9 year period.
60:1614:148284:22:22:72:542:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Importantly, however, these results are sharply different from the findings in Neumark et al. (2005),
60:1615:148385:22:22:72:299:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and much more similar to rest of the literature.
60:1616:148433:22:22:88:539:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To take stock, the results in this literature are varied and sometimes appear to be inconsistent
60:1617:148529:22:22:71:540:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with each other. But is it possible to filter out some of the noise and actually obtain a signal?
60:1618:148626:22:22:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure A.1 plots a histogram of all 72 elasticities. First, I note that across these 13 studies, nearly
60:1619:148729:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:all (72) of the 78 estimates of the poverty rate elasticity are negative in sign. Table A.2 reports
60:1620:148828:22:22:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that the simple average of elasticities across all these 78 estimates is -0.18. If we take the median
60:1621:148929:22:30:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimate from each study, the simple average of these median estimates is -0.17. Indeed, only one
60:1622:149026:30:15:83:539:130:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:40Neumark (2016) follows up on an original paper Neumark and Wascher (2011), which mostly focused on the
60:1623:149130:15:11:72:540:115:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:interaction of EITC and minimum wages on on wage and employment effects. However, in Neumark and Wascher
60:1624:149234:11:11:70:539:104:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:(2011), they do provide some evidence of minimum wage effects on the share of 21-44 year olds with incomes below the
60:1625:149350:11:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:poverty line and one-half the poverty line. In an earlier draft of this paper, I had backed out the implied minimum
60:1626:149465:11:10:71:540:82:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:wage elasticities implied in Neumark and Wascher (2011). In response, Neumark (2016) went back and directly
60:1627:149572:10:0:72:233:72:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:estimated and reported these estimates.
61:1628:149613:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:study by Neumark et al. (2005) suggests that minimum wages actually increase the overall poverty
61:1629:149709:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rate. As I discussed above, this study uses an unconventional methodology that is both different
61:1630:149805:22:22:72:424:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from all other studies, and makes problematic distributional assumptions.
61:1631:149878:22:22:88:539:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Second, if we take the average of the poverty rate elasticities for the overall population across
61:1632:149975:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the eight studies that provide such an estimate, we obtain an average poverty rate elasticity of
61:1633:150071:22:22:70:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:-0.13.41There are, of course, other ways of aggregating estimates across studies. However, when I
61:1634:150168:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:consider the set of nearly all available estimates of the effect of minimum wages on poverty, the
61:1635:150265:22:22:71:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:weight of the evidence suggests that minimum wages tend to have a small to moderate sized impact
61:1636:150361:22:22:72:167:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in reducing poverty.
61:1637:150381:22:22:88:539:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:While there is a signal in the literature that minimum wages tend to reduce poverty, it is also
61:1638:150476:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:true that the existing evidence is clouded by serious limitations. These include (1) inadequate
61:1639:150571:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:assessment of time-varying state-level heterogeneity, especially in light of the evidence in Allegretto
61:1640:150674:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:et al. (2011, 2013) and Dube et al. (2010); (2) limited sample length and/or exclusion of more
61:1641:150768:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:recent years that have experienced substantially more variation in minimum wages; (3) insufficient
61:1642:150866:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:attention to serial and intra-group correlation in forming standard errors; (4) use of questionable
61:1643:150965:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimators; and (5) frequent omission of demographic and other covariates. In this paper, I use
61:1644:151060:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:more and better data along with more robust forms of controls to address these limitations in the
61:1645:151157:22:228:72:160:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:existing literature.
61:1646:151177:228:15:83:541:108:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:41These eight studies are: Card and Krueger (1995), Stevans and Sessions (2001), Gundersen and Ziliak (2004),
61:1647:151286:15:11:72:541:93:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:Neumark et al. (2005), Burkhauser and Sabia (2007), Sabia and Burkhauser (2010), and Sabia and Nielsen (2015),
61:1648:151396:11:10:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:and Sabia (2014). In the two studies authored by Burkhauser and Sabia, the overall poverty measure excludes those
61:1649:151509:10:0:72:346:72:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:under 16 or over 64; Card and Krueger also exclude those under 16.

67:1687:159570:21:22:72:542:428:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:have been fairly stationary over the past three decades, although they do exhibit cyclical tendencies.
