2:29:1402:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:While it is well known that managers prefer in-person meetings for negotiating deals and selling their
2:30:1504:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:products, face-to-face communication may be particularly important for the transfer of technology
2:31:1601:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:because technology is best explained and demonstrated in person. This paper studies the role of short-term
2:32:1707:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:cross-border labor movements for innovation by estimating the recent impact of U.S. business travel
2:33:1806:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:to foreign countries on their patenting rates. Business travel is shown to have a signi...cant e¤ect up
2:34:1909:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:and beyond technology transfer through the channels of international trade and foreign direct investment.
2:35:2014:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:On average, a 10% increase in business travel leads to an increase in patenting by about 0.2%, and
2:36:2112:14:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:inward business travel is about one fourth as potent for innovation as domestic R&D spending. We
2:37:2208:14:14:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:show that the technological knowledge of each business traveler matters by estimating a higher impact
2:38:2309:14:14:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:for travelers that originate in U.S. states with substantial innovation, such as California. This study
2:39:2412:14:14:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:provides initial evidence that international air travel may be an important channel through which cross-country
2:40:2523:14:42:72:240:434:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:income di¤erences can be reduced.

3:51:2784:38:27:72:525:635:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:Throughout history the internationalflowsofskillsembodiedinpeoplehadmajoreffects on
3:52:2867:27:27:71:524:608:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:innovation and growth across countries.  A case in point is the year 1789.  Despite the fact
3:53:2959:27:27:71:525:581:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:that England at the time had banned the international movement of skilled craftsmen to ensure
3:54:3052:27:28:71:525:554:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:that its technology would not spread elsewhere, a certain Samuel Slater disguised himself and
3:55:3145:28:27:71:525:526:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:succeeded to slip out on a ship to the United States. There, he built thefirst water-powered
3:56:3237:27:27:71:525:499:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:textile mill and became known as the father of the American Industrial Revolution.  Today,
3:57:3327:27:27:71:525:472:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:in contrast, blueprints can be transferred electronically within seconds over the Internet. Does
3:58:3423:27:27:71:525:445:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:this mean that skills embodied in people play no role anymore for innovation? In this paper
3:59:3514:27:27:71:525:418:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:we provide evidence on this question by studying the impact of international business travel on
3:60:3609:27:33:71:124:391:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:innovation.
3:61:3620:33:27:88:525:358:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:Business trips bring local entrepreneurs into personal contact with foreigners and their tech-
3:62:3714:27:27:71:526:331:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:nology. This may stimulate innovation locally because technology is incremental in nature, with
3:63:3809:27:27:71:525:304:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:knowledge of prior art helping to generate new technology. Technological knowledge tends to
3:64:3900:27:28:71:525:277:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:also be tacit–it is difficult to fully characterize.1The face-to-face communication with foreign
3:65:3996:28:27:72:525:249:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:business travelers could thus be crucial for transferring technology, ahead of methods such as
3:66:4090:27:27:72:525:222:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:telephone calls or video-conferencing. Consistent with that, surveys typicallyfind that business
3:67:4186:27:27:72:526:195:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:executives prefer face-to-face meetings over phone or web-based communication (Forbes 2009,
3:68:4277:27:27:72:525:168:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:Harvard Business Review 2009). Nevertheless, todate we know quite little on these issue. This
3:69:4370:27:26:72:214:141:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:paper’s goal is tofill this gap.
3:70:4402:26:15:84:525:115:36:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:F:1Polanyi (1958) discusses the tacitness of technological knowledge. See Koskinen and Vanharanta (2002) on

4:72:4610:0:27:88:525:675:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:We employ a new dataset to examine the impact of business travelers from the United States
4:73:4700:27:27:71:524:648:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:on patenting in 34 countries, both rich and poor, over more than a decade (the years 1993 to
4:74:4792:27:27:71:525:621:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:2003). One challenge we face is that business travelers might arrive in a country for systematic,
4:75:4889:27:27:71:525:594:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:non-random reasons, which would bias ourfindings. Our analysis addresses endogeneity con-
4:76:4978:27:27:71:526:567:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:cerns by contrasting the behavior of business travelers with that of friends and family travel.
4:77:5073:27:28:71:525:540:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:Central is the idea that while business travel might be affected by changes in economic return
4:78:5167:28:27:71:525:512:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:to traveling (e.g., changes in the business climate), family travel is not. In our analysis, wefind
4:79:5266:27:27:71:525:485:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:that business travel has a positive impact on that country’s rate of innovation. Quantitatively,
4:80:5362:27:27:71:525:458:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:a 10% increase in business travelers raises patenting on average by about 0.2%, and in a typical
4:81:5458:27:27:71:525:431:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:case business travel from the United States accounts for about 10% of the total difference in
4:82:5551:27:27:71:525:404:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:patenting across countries. Moreover, wefind evidence that the impact of business travel on
4:83:5642:27:33:71:497:377:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:patenting is increasing in the technological knowledge carried by each particular traveler.
4:84:5733:33:27:88:525:344:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:Trade in services today is very important for many countries, and still we know very little
4:85:5824:27:27:71:525:317:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:about service trade.2With our study of air travel we broaden existing perspectives that tend to
4:86:5919:27:27:71:525:290:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:focus on trade in goods to shed light on the role played by service trade. Moreover, in contrast
4:87:6015:27:27:71:525:263:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:to the small but growing literature on the role of business travel in facilitating international
4:88:6111:27:28:71:524:236:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:goods trade (Poole 2010, Cristea 2011), our analysis links business travel to innovation while
4:89:6205:28:27:71:525:208:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:accounting not only for changes in goods trade butalso in foreign direct investment (FDI). From
4:90:6300:27:27:71:525:181:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:a policy perspective, this paper highlights the potential gains from services liberalization, such
4:91:6398:27:26:71:389:154:121:g_d0_f4:65:g_d0_f4:B:as the Open Skies Agreement, in terms of innovation and growth.3
4:92:6462:26:14:84:526:128:36:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:F:2For example, services exports are close to 40% of goods exports in the United States. News release of the

5:97:6924:27:27:71:524:648:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:long-run convergence of incomes (Lucas 1993, Aghion and Howitt 1998, Howitt 2000, Jones
5:98:7011:27:27:71:525:621:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:2002). Specifically, some recent research assumes that knowledge is entirely embodied in people
5:99:7106:27:27:72:525:594:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:(Burstein and Monge-Naranjo 2009) so that international travel is crucial for knowledge diffusion.
5:100:7204:27:27:72:525:567:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:Empirically, it is an open question whether effective knowledge transfer is possible by simply
5:101:7298:27:28:72:525:540:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:providing (non-rival) blueprints or whether knowledge embodied in people is needed, and if the

5:107:7780:27:28:72:525:372:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:themselves can be a conduit of international knowledgeflows (Oettl and Agrawal 2008, Kim,

5:109:7960:27:27:72:525:317:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:the usually fairly small samples of previous work, this paper studies knowledge transfer through
5:110:8056:27:27:72:526:290:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:face-to-face meetings in more than 100,000 of business trips, as well as providing causal evidence
5:111:8154:27:32:72:351:263:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:by addressing the potential endogeneity of business travel.
5:112:8213:32:27:88:525:231:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:A number of authors have considered air travel as a conduit for technology transfer, with

5:114:8398:28:27:72:525:176:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:air passengers are not significantly related to productivity differences across European regions. In
5:115:8498:27:29:72:526:149:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:contrast, Andersen and Dalgaard (2011) employ information from the World Tourism Organiza-
5:116:8588:29:7:72:284:120:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:F:WTO (2006) which discusses key multilateral issues.
5:117:8639:7:15:84:525:113:36:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:F:4Network membership often lowers the costs of interaction (Rauch 2001), and to verify membership face-to-
5:118:8744:15:11:71:525:98:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:F:face meetings will often be useful. See also Singh (2005), Agrawal, Cockburn, and McHale (2006), and Agrawal,

6:120:8879:0:28:72:524:674:121:g_d0_f4:65:g_d0_f4:B:tion to show that the number of air travelers can explain cross-country productivity differences.5
6:121:8977:28:27:72:526:646:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:We improve on this literature by employing better data on air travel. Even if it were the case
6:122:9071:27:27:72:525:619:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:that tourists—which are the bulk of the air travelers in the typical existing study— are important
6:123:9169:27:27:71:525:592:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:for international knowledge diffusion, since data on tourism to date are not comparable across
6:124:9263:27:27:71:526:565:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:countries empirical work based on them is unlikely to yield robust results. In contrast, our air
6:125:9359:27:27:71:525:538:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:traveler measure is consistent because it comes from one survey. Moreover, we can separate
6:126:9449:27:27:71:525:511:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:business travelers from tourists and other travelers. This is useful because one would expect
6:127:9542:27:33:71:512:484:121:g_d0_f4:65:g_d0_f4:B:business travelers to matter more for technology diffusion than tourists and other travelers.6
6:128:9636:33:27:88:525:451:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:Our research also employs an unusually detailed measure of innovation. In particular, we
6:129:9724:27:27:71:525:424:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:know the identity and countries of residence of all patentees in the sample. Thus we can ask
6:130:9816:27:27:71:524:397:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:whether business travel from a country that is the home country of one of the patent owners
6:131:9907:27:28:71:525:370:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:is more potent in its effect on innovation than business travel in general (we do not know
6:132:9997:28:27:71:525:342:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:whether the business traveler was in fact the patentee). In contrast, most existing studies focus
6:133:10094:27:27:71:524:315:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:on productivity as the measure of innovation. That has certain advantages, chief perhaps that
6:134:10187:27:27:71:525:288:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:economic effects are easily quantified. At the same time, productivity measures tend to confound
6:135:10283:27:27:71:525:261:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:several factors that have different implications, something we avoid in this study by working with
6:136:10381:27:33:71:134:234:121:g_d0_f4:65:g_d0_f4:B:patent data.7
6:137:10394:33:27:88:525:201:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:The remainder of the paper is as follows. The next section motivates the analysis in terms of
6:138:10487:27:26:71:525:174:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:theory and also it discusses the key empirical issues. The following section 3 introduces the main

6:141:10688:11:15:84:525:126:36:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:F:7Productivity often captures not only technical efficiency but also demand shocks and market power, factor

7:149:11356:35:38:96:151:506:209:g_d0_f3:209:g_d0_f3:A:analysis
7:150:11364:38:27:72:526:468:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:Our goal is to assess the impact of international business travel on the rate of innovation across
7:151:11462:27:28:72:525:441:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:countries. To do so, this section provides a theoretical motivation and also discusses a number
7:152:11557:28:33:72:460:413:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:of key choices we make in terms of data, identification, and estimation technique.
7:153:11639:33:27:88:525:380:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:As a point of departure in terms of theory, it is useful to think of a model in which techno-
7:154:11732:27:27:72:525:353:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:logical knowledge diffuses abroad through business travel and other channels. Keller and Yeaple
7:155:11827:27:27:72:526:326:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:(2012) analyzefirms that decide whether to produce intermediate goods for theirfinal good
7:156:11916:27:27:72:526:299:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:either at home or abroad. Since home managers have the necessary know-how for production,
7:157:12005:27:27:72:525:272:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:the manufacturing of any intermediate at home entails only the trade cost as the intermediate
7:158:12098:27:27:72:526:245:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:is shipped for assembly abroad.  If, however, the intermediate is to be produced abroad the
7:159:12189:27:27:72:526:218:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:know-how has to be transferred between home and foreign country managers, which is subject
7:160:12279:27:33:72:398:191:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:to communication frictions because technological knowledge is tacit.
7:161:12347:33:27:88:525:158:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:This model posits a trade-offof technology transfer in embodied form through trade and
7:162:12433:27:28:71:525:131:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:through direct communication associated with FDI production. A role for business travel in
7:163:12523:28:0:71:525:103:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:enhancing technology transfer naturally arises when home country managers can travel to the
8:164:12615:0:27:72:526:675:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:host country. Face-to-face time enhances technology transfer at the same time that it might lead
8:165:12711:27:27:72:524:648:121:g_d0_f4:65:g_d0_f4:B:to learning on the part of unaffiliated host country agents (perhaps through labor turnover).8
8:166:12805:27:33:72:399:621:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:This learning is what may raise the host country’s rate of patenting.
8:167:12874:33:27:88:525:588:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:In terms of empirics the goal is to estimate the relationship between the rate of innovation and
8:168:12970:27:27:72:525:561:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:inward business travelers from abroad. We measure innovation using data on patenting at the
8:169:13061:27:28:72:525:534:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:level of 37 industries in 34 countries.9Our business travel information is on outward business
8:170:13155:28:27:72:526:506:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:travel from the United States and covers mostly U.S. citizens.  We do not know whether a
8:171:13243:27:27:72:525:479:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:particular traveler is involved with innovation in the country he or she isflying to, but we do
8:172:13338:27:27:72:525:452:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:know the U.S. state (and county) of where the traveler is originating from. This will allow us to
8:173:13435:27:27:72:525:425:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:contrast the impact of business travelers from states such as California, where knowledge levels
8:174:13531:27:27:72:526:398:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:and patenting rates are relatively high, with states such as Nebraska, where they are generally
8:175:13626:27:33:72:100:371:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:lower.
8:176:13632:33:27:88:525:338:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:Next we turn to identification. Letdenote the number of patents of countryand ̃its
8:177:13720:27:27:72:526:311:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:number of inward business travelers. In estimating the impact of business travelers on patenting
8:178:13816:27:27:72:526:284:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:several issues will have to be addressed. First, to account for the fact that the number of patents
8:179:13915:27:27:72:525:257:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:is affected by many factors, such as the size of country c, we include a set of variablesthat
8:180:14010:27:28:72:525:230:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:reduces concerns arising from omitted variables. Second, our approach eliminates the influence
8:181:14104:28:27:71:525:202:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:of unobserved factors at the country-, industry-, and year-level by including the corresponding
8:182:14199:27:23:71:130:175:121:g_d0_f5:121:g_d0_f4:B:fixed effects.
8:183:14213:23:15:84:525:152:36:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:F:8The incentive of knowledge owners will typically be to prevent leakage of the knowledge to others. This by
8:184:14320:15:11:71:525:137:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:F:itself may be a reason for reducing the number of face-to-face meetings, except in cases where the technology
8:185:14429:11:7:71:278:126:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:F:transfer is intended as in the case of joint ventures.
8:186:14483:7:15:84:526:119:36:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:F:9The industry dimension is important because industries vary greatly in terms of patenting activity. A list of
8:187:14593:15:0:71:255:104:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:F:the industries is given in Appendix Table A1.
9:188:14639:0:27:88:525:673:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:This leaves the possibility that ̃is endogenous due to time-varying factors (for example,
9:189:14730:27:28:71:524:646:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:changes in a country’s tax code boost patenting and also trigger more inward business travel).
9:190:14824:28:27:71:525:618:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:This would leave ̃correlated with the error of the regression and yield inconsistent estimates.
9:191:14921:27:27:71:525:591:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:In this paper two methods are employed to address such concerns. Thefirst method adds on
9:192:15009:27:27:71:525:564:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:the right-hand side of the equation a control function (CF) such that ̃may be endogenous
9:193:15099:27:27:71:525:537:121:g_d0_f4:65:g_d0_f8:B:without the CF but it is exogenous once the CF is included, and hence, the coefficient on ̃
9:194:15192:27:27:72:525:510:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:with CF is consistent. Control function approaches have been widely used in empirical work
9:195:15282:27:27:72:526:483:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:recently, for example in the estimation of production functions (see Olley and Pakes 1996 and
9:196:15375:27:27:72:526:456:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:related extensions). The second method we employ is instrumental variable (IV) estimation,
9:197:15465:27:27:72:525:429:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:specifically the approach developed in Mullahy (1997). Both the control function and the IV
9:198:15556:27:28:72:526:402:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:strategies employed here are well-established methods and covered in standard econometrics
9:199:15646:28:31:72:252:374:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:textbooks such as Wooldridge (2002).
9:200:15682:31:28:88:525:343:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:While the two estimation strategies differ in general, they are related in that for either
9:201:15772:28:27:72:525:315:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:to work certain exclusion restrictions must be satisfied.  For the IV strategy this means the
9:202:15865:27:27:72:526:288:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:instrument must be valid. In our case, we will mainly rely on friends & family travel as an
9:203:15956:27:27:72:525:261:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:instrument for business travel. The exclusion restriction is that friends & family travel does not
9:204:16054:27:27:72:525:234:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:affect patenting in a country.10Analogous to the requirement that the instrument is valid in the
9:205:16150:27:27:71:525:207:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:IV strategy, the CF approach requires that the CF itself is appropriate. In our case the control
9:206:16246:27:27:71:525:180:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:function will typically be the residual from a regression of business travel on friends & family
9:207:16342:27:27:71:525:153:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:travel. Then, the exclusion restriction is, similar to the IV case, that friends & family travel is
9:208:16441:27:24:71:525:126:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:not a determinant of patenting, conditional on all covariates. Because friends & family travel is
9:209:16538:24:15:80:525:102:36:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:F:10The full condition is that friends & family travel does not affect patentingandthat it is not correlated with
9:210:16649:15:0:71:338:87:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:F:any determinants of patenting; see Wooldridge (2002, Ch. 19.5.1).
10:211:16715:0:27:72:525:675:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:determined by factors that are quite different from business travel, and moreover, these factors
10:212:16811:27:27:72:526:648:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:typically do not change from year to year, we consider it to be very likely that our approach
10:213:16904:27:33:72:442:621:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:towards possible endogeneity is successful. We will return to this issue below.
10:214:16983:33:27:88:525:588:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:This section is concluded by discussing the regression techniques employed below. The fact
10:215:17073:27:27:72:525:561:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:that our dependent variablethe number of patents, is non-negative and has no upper bound
10:216:17163:27:28:72:525:534:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f7:B:suggests to use count data models which rely on the exponential function,(|)=exp(xβ)
10:217:17251:28:27:72:526:506:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:Within this class the assumption thatgivenhas a Poisson distribution has been most common
10:218:17342:27:27:72:525:479:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:given the efficiency properties of its maximum likelihood estimators.11At the same time, making
10:219:17437:27:27:71:525:452:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:the Poisson distributional assumption has been criticized because it implies restrictions on the

11:254:20334:11:14:80:525:109:36:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:F:14The use of fractions means that our data is not strictlyspeaking count data; despite this we prefer to employ

13:303:24078:8:11:72:525:156:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:F:across travelers, for example, one could introduce variables for different states, such as California versus Nebraska,

15:331:26677:27:27:72:524:619:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:while the number of observations for religious travel, retired, and homemaker travel is smaller.
15:332:26773:27:52:88:274:592:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:We now turn to the empirical analysis.

15:341:27394:27:27:71:525:269:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:likelihood estimation (QMLE) in form of both Poisson and Negative Binomial in our empirical
15:342:27485:27:27:71:524:242:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:analysis. We begin with simple Poisson QMLE and Negative Binomial regressions before moving
15:343:27576:27:33:71:417:215:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:to control function and IV approaches to deal with possible endogeneity.
15:344:27648:33:27:88:525:182:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:The results of estimating equation (2) are shown in Table 2. In columns 1 to 7, the dependent
15:345:27741:27:28:71:525:155:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:variable is the foreign country’s patent counts taken out at the U.S. patent office, while in

15:347:27932:25:15:80:525:102:36:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:F:18In this analysis we focus on positive numbers of business travelers; our analysis does not necessary apply to

16:352:28363:27:27:72:525:594:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:the (bias-corrected) bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals.19Column 1 shows that there is a
16:353:28454:27:27:72:525:567:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:strong correlation between patenting and travel from the United States, which is not reduced
16:354:28546:27:28:72:526:540:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:with the inclusion of controls for size and level of development (column 2). Next we include
16:355:28638:28:27:72:525:512:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:controls for domestic technology investments as well as international technology transfer. U.S.
16:356:28733:27:27:72:525:485:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:FDI and U.S. exports have a positive coefficient, although only FDI is significant. Importantly,
16:357:28829:27:27:72:525:458:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:the inclusion of these variables does not change the business travel coefficient by much.  In
16:358:28922:27:33:72:449:431:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:column 4, we include R&D expenditures, which has the expected positive sign.
16:359:28998:33:27:88:525:398:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:Recall that the left-hand side variable is a country’s industry-level patenting in the United
16:360:29091:27:27:72:525:371:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:States. In column 5 the domestic patenting of the country’s residents is added. This controls
16:361:29184:27:27:72:526:344:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:for technology and other shocks that lead to changes in a country’s overall patenting. We see
16:362:29277:27:27:72:525:317:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:that resident patenting is strongly correlated with the country’s patenting in the United States,
16:363:29374:27:27:72:526:290:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:a plausible result that holds throughout our analysis. In column 6, U.S. imports and inward
16:364:29465:27:27:72:525:263:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:FDI are added, which does not change the estimated effect of business travel on U.S. patenting.
16:365:29560:27:28:72:525:236:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:With the inclusion of all control variables, the business travel coefficient is estimated at around
16:366:29659:28:27:72:526:208:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:2%. Domestic R&D expenditures and resident patent applications are associated with higher
16:367:29748:27:27:72:526:181:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:patenting in the United States. In column 7 the estimates from the Negative Binomial model are
16:368:29842:27:26:72:517:154:121:g_d0_f4:65:g_d0_f4:B:employed. The coefficient of business travel is estimated slightly higher now, at around 3%.20
16:369:29936:26:14:80:525:128:36:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:F:19We cluster by country-year because some of the variables do not vary by industry; for example, GDP per
16:370:30040:14:11:71:525:114:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:F:capita for a given year is employed for all industries. In contrast, patents on the left and the business variable on

16:372:30189:8:0:80:526:95:36:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:F:20From the confidence intervals given in Table 2 we know that the business variable is significanct at a 5% level
17:373:30304:0:27:88:525:675:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:We now turn to a preliminary analysis of the economic magnitude implied by these estimates.
17:374:30395:27:27:71:525:648:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:The size of the business travel coefficient suggests that a 10% increase in business travelers from
17:375:30494:27:27:71:524:621:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:the U.S. is associated with an about 0.2% higher number of patent applications in the United
17:376:30586:27:27:71:525:594:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:States. If we focus on foreign patents with U.S. coinventors, the coefficient estimate for business
17:377:30685:27:27:71:525:567:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:traveler is about 0.03-0.04, see columns 8 and 9, compared to 0.02 for all U.S. patents in column
17:378:30782:27:28:71:525:540:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:6. Thefinding of a larger coefficient for U.S. business travelers when U.S. persons are coinventors
17:379:30881:28:33:71:525:512:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:is consistent with stronger international transferthrough business travel for these technologies.
17:380:30978:33:27:88:525:479:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:In the previous regressions the relationship between patenting and business travel may be
17:381:31067:27:27:71:525:452:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f7:B:affected by unobserved shocks which would lead to biased estimates because[]6=0
17:382:31157:27:27:71:525:425:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:In particular, we are concerned that[]0because this would lead to an upward bias
17:383:31248:27:27:72:525:398:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:in the business travel coefficient. We use both control function (CF) and instrumental variable

17:385:31412:33:27:88:525:338:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:Consider the CF approachfirst. The main idea is to construct a control function such that
17:386:31501:27:27:72:525:311:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:when it is included in the regression the correlation of business travel and the new regression error
17:387:31602:27:27:72:525:284:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:is zero.21The control function that we propose is theresidual of a regression of business travel
17:388:31698:27:49:71:509:257:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:on visiting friends & family travel. Consider the following ordinary least-squares regression:

18:396:32298:27:27:71:525:621:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:covariates.22This would be the case if the travel destination has received tax breaks or other
18:397:32392:27:27:72:525:594:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:positive shocks that make it a more attractive place to do business. Because these are the kinds
18:398:32488:27:27:72:525:567:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:of circumstances that are primary concerns to us, this residualˆwill serve as our control

18:400:32590:34:27:88:524:506:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:Another issue is that the CF needs to be based on something that is related to business
18:401:32677:27:27:72:525:479:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:travel.23For example, a new direct air connection from the United States to a specific foreign
18:402:32771:27:27:72:525:452:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:country will typically increase both business travel and family & friends travel. In Figure 1, we

18:404:32961:27:33:71:429:398:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:clearly a strong correlation, and this also exists for shorter periods of time.

18:411:33421:27:26:72:525:159:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:in this approach comes from changes in business travel conditional on changes in profitability,
18:412:33516:26:11:80:444:133:36:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:A:22The definition of this traveler category in the SIAT survey is: "Visit Friends/Relatives".
18:413:33608:11:15:80:525:122:36:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:F:23This requirement is analogous to a strongfirst stage correlation in the typical two-state least squares IV

19:417:33923:27:27:72:525:621:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:by looking at the parameter estimate ofˆon the control function (see Wooldridge 2002, Ch.
19:418:34013:27:27:72:525:594:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:19). In our case, if the control function enters equation (4) significantly, the test implies that
19:419:34111:27:27:72:525:567:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:business travel is endogenous, whereas if the control function does not enter significantly the
19:420:34206:27:34:72:302:540:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:exogeneity of business travel cannot be rejected.
19:421:34255:34:27:88:525:506:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:As noted above, the main identification assumption is that visiting friends & family travel
19:422:34346:27:27:72:525:479:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:does not transfer technology. Of course, friends & family travel to foreign countries conveys

19:424:34530:27:27:72:525:425:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:by thefixed effects. Beyond that there is little reason to believe that friends & family travel
19:425:34625:27:27:72:525:398:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:responds to short-term, time-varying shocks in the business climate and the like, as the primary
19:426:34721:27:33:72:405:371:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:motive of visiting friends and family is to maintain personal relations.

19:428:34884:27:27:72:525:311:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:Column 1 corresponds to visiting friends & family travel as the only control variable, while
19:429:34976:27:27:72:526:284:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:columns 2, 3, 4 and 5 successively include additional control variables. They are the number
19:430:35068:27:27:72:525:257:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:of persons traveling who are retired (column 2), the number of persons who travel for religious
19:431:35163:27:28:72:526:230:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:reasons (columns 3 and 5), and the number of travelers that are homemakers (4 and 5). These
19:432:35254:28:27:72:525:202:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:additional travelers, whether classified by purpose, as in the case of religion, or by occupation,
19:433:35352:27:27:72:525:175:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:as in the case of homemakers and retirees, share with visitors of family & friends that it is
19:434:35445:27:27:72:526:148:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:reasonable to assume that they are not importantly involved in the transfer of technological
19:435:35537:27:27:72:526:121:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:knowledge. As seen from Table 3, the number of each type of traveler is positively correlated
19:436:35630:27:0:72:525:94:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:with business travel. The most important predictor is visiting friends & family travel, probably
20:437:35728:0:27:72:525:675:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:because it is relatively common, see the summary statistics in Table 1. The coefficient on friends
20:438:35826:27:27:71:525:648:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:&familytravelishighlysignificant at around 0.8, and the regressions have an R-squared upwards
20:439:35919:27:33:71:431:621:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:of 0.92. These results suggest that the control function will not lack power.
20:440:35996:33:27:88:525:588:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:The second approach to deal with the potential endogeneity in the business travel variable
20:441:36086:27:27:71:525:561:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:is the Poisson GMM IV approach due to Mullahy (1997). The instrument that we use for the
20:442:36174:27:28:71:525:534:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:business travel variable is visiting friends & family travel. The IV approach requires that the
20:443:36269:28:27:71:525:506:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:friends & family travel instrument is both (1)powerful and (2) valid. Regarding the former,
20:444:36360:27:27:71:524:479:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:it is evident from Figure 1 as well as from Table 3 that the instrument is strongly correlated
20:445:36454:27:27:71:525:452:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:with business trave. The validity of a single instrument cannot be directly tested. At the same
20:446:36549:27:27:71:525:425:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:time, consistent with the validity of the exclusion assumption, friends & family travel is not
20:447:36643:27:27:71:525:398:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:significantly correlated with patenting when it is added to equation (2). However, this cannot
20:448:36737:27:33:71:193:371:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:be taken as a formal test.
20:449:36763:33:27:88:525:338:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:Table 4 shows the results of the control function and IV approaches. The control functions
20:450:36853:27:27:72:525:311:121:g_d0_f9:121:g_d0_f4:B:ˆconstructed from the residuals of thefirst andfifth column of Table 3 are included in the
20:451:36944:27:27:72:525:284:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:Poisson and Negative Binomial regressions.24Thefirst column repeats the results from Table 2,
20:452:37037:27:27:71:525:257:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:column 6 with a coefficient of 2.2% for the business traveler variable. If endogeneity generates
20:453:37133:27:28:71:525:230:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:an upward bias in this coefficient, upon inclusion of the control function one expects that the
20:454:37228:28:27:72:525:202:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:coefficient on business travel will decrease, and that the coefficient onˆitself is positive. We
20:455:37325:27:27:72:525:175:121:g_d0_f5:121:g_d0_f4:B:find that the coefficient on the business travel variable falls little, from 2.2% in column 1 to
20:456:37421:27:27:72:525:148:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:2.1%. The control function point estimates are positive, around 0.55%, but not significant. In
20:457:37515:27:26:72:525:121:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:column 4, we report results from the Poisson IV estimation. The coefficient on business travel
20:458:37609:26:0:80:351:95:36:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:A:24The other control functions based on Table 3 give similar results.
21:459:37679:0:33:72:375:674:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:is similar, at 2.4%, although somewhat less precisely estimated.
21:460:37743:33:27:88:525:641:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:We also present results from the QMLE estimator with CF and the negative binomial distri-
21:461:37832:27:27:72:525:614:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:butional assumption, see column 5. As in the caseof the IV Poisson estimation (column 4), this
21:462:37926:27:27:71:525:587:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:yields coefficients on Population and GDP per capita which are larger than with the Poisson
21:463:38017:27:27:72:525:560:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:CF approach, see columns 2 and 3. However, all estimation methods agree that the coefficient
21:464:38109:27:27:72:526:533:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:on business travel is, with a range of 2.1% to 2.5%, not far from the estimate on business travel
21:465:38206:27:33:72:343:506:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:under the assumption of exogeneity, at 2.1% (column 1).
21:466:38261:33:27:88:525:473:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:Taken together, these results imply that the evidence for endogeneity of business travel is
21:467:38352:27:27:72:525:446:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:limited. Yes, the control function is positive in columns 2, 3, and 5, but it is never significant at
21:468:38453:27:27:72:526:419:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:standard levels, and based on this test we cannot reject exogeneity of business travel. Further,
21:469:38549:27:28:72:525:392:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:a Hausman-type test for endogeneity based on column 1 (under the assumption of exogeneity)
21:470:38639:28:27:72:525:364:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:and column 5 (IV, under the assumption of endogeneity) doesfind some evidence for differences
21:471:38732:27:27:72:525:337:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:of estimated coefficients, and hence endogeneity—at the same time, the coefficient of primary
21:472:38825:27:27:71:525:310:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:interest—on business travel—is almost the same under either the exogeneity or the endogeneity
21:473:38918:27:27:71:524:283:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:assumption. In the end, given that our primary concern is consistency of the estimation we might
21:474:39014:27:27:71:525:256:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:prefer the CF/IV estimates which are consistent whether or not business travel is endogenous.
21:475:39107:27:33:71:504:229:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:However, based on our formal tests there is no reason to reject the exogeneity assumption.
21:476:39197:33:27:88:525:196:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:Turning to the results for the subset of foreign patent applications in the United States with
21:477:39291:27:27:71:524:169:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:U.S. coinventors on the right side of Table 4, we see that the control function correction has
21:478:39385:27:27:71:525:142:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:qualitatively the same effect on the business travel coefficient, which comes down from 3.8% to
21:479:39480:27:28:72:525:115:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:3.3% and the control function itself is positive but not significant (columns 6 and 7). In column
21:480:39577:28:0:72:525:87:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:8, the Poisson IV procedure estimates the impact of business travel on patenting to be higher,
22:481:39673:0:27:72:526:674:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:at 8.2%. The relatively large number of zeros in the dependent variable for U.S. joint patents
22:482:39767:27:27:72:525:647:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:appears to make it computationally difficult to exploit the moment conditions that this estimator
22:483:39864:27:27:72:525:620:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:relies on, and we are inclined to discount this higher coefficient estimate. Overall, the results
22:484:39961:27:27:72:525:593:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:of Table 4 show that inward business travel from the U.S. gives a significant boost to foreign
22:485:40055:27:33:72:508:566:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:countries’ patenting, and this effect is stronger in the case of patents with U.S. coinventors.
22:486:40150:33:27:88:525:533:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:What are the economic magnitudes that our estimates yield? Take Poland and Romania, two
22:487:40237:27:27:72:525:506:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:Eastern European countries of roughly similar size. It turns out that during the sample period
22:488:40331:27:27:72:526:479:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:covered by the survey there were on average almost 6 business travelers per industry and year
22:489:40424:27:27:72:525:452:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:going to Romania, and about 16 going to Poland. At the same time, the mean patenting rate in
22:490:40516:27:28:72:525:425:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:Romania was 1.12 while it was 1.31 in Poland. We can use our estimates from Table 4 to gauge
22:491:40608:28:27:72:525:397:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:the importance of international business travel from the U.S. in accounting for this difference
22:492:40703:27:27:72:525:370:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:of 0.19 in mean patenting. The coefficient on business travel is 0.021 (column 2, Table 4). This
22:493:40799:27:27:72:526:343:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:brings the predicted patenting premium for Poland over Romania attributable to the higher
22:494:40888:27:27:72:526:316:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f11:B:number of U.S. business travelers to about 0.02 (equal toexp[0021×ln(131)]−exp[0021×
22:495:40975:27:27:72:525:289:121:g_d0_f9:121:g_d0_f4:B:ln(112)]), or about 11% (0.02/0.19) of the total difference in patenting between Poland and
22:496:41067:27:27:72:525:262:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:Romania. The contribution of travel fromallcountries, as opposed to just from the U.S., in
22:497:41157:27:60:72:526:235:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:explaining variation in the patenting rates across countries is probably a small multiple of that.
22:498:41255:60:27:88:525:175:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:Another way to assess the economic importance of business travel for patenting is to compare
22:499:41347:27:28:72:525:148:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:it with the impact of domestic R&D expenditures. Using the marginal effects based on our Table
22:500:41441:28:27:72:525:120:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:4 regression estimates, wefind that business travel has about one quarter of the size of the impact
22:501:41540:27:0:71:526:93:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:of domestic R&D on patenting. Overall, these results indicate that international business travel
23:502:41638:0:33:72:504:675:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:explains a moderately large portion of differences in the rate of patenting across countries.
23:503:41731:33:27:88:525:642:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:These results come from a large sample of industries which exhibit a lot of variation in
23:504:41819:27:27:72:525:615:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:terms of patenting activity. In the context of international technology diffusion, the question
23:505:41914:27:27:72:526:588:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:is whether learning effects are predominantly associated with the sectors in which there is a
23:506:42007:27:27:72:526:561:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:lot of technology creation, as opposed to with all sectors. To see this we examine whether the
23:507:42101:27:28:72:526:534:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:estimated relationship between business travel and innovation holds equally for high versus low
23:508:42196:28:27:72:525:506:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:patenting industries.25The results are shown in Table 5, columns 1 to 6. Column 1 repeats
23:509:42285:27:27:71:525:479:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:for convenience the estimates from Table 2, column 6, while in columns 2 and 3 in addition to
23:510:42378:27:27:71:524:452:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:business travel an interaction of business travel with a high patenting dummy (based on either
23:511:42472:27:27:71:525:425:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:median or mean) is included. It is apparent that the coefficient on business travel is greater in
23:512:42569:27:27:71:525:398:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:high patenting industries than in the average industry (coefficient of 0.029 to 0.049, compared to
23:513:42667:27:27:71:525:371:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:0.022 in column 1). At the same time, for low-patenting industries the business travel estimate
23:514:42762:27:39:71:144:344:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:is close to zero.
23:515:42779:39:27:88:525:305:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:In columns 3 to 6 of Table 5 we show analogous results using the control function approach
23:516:42869:27:27:71:525:278:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:with the Poisson assumption, where column 4 repeats the earlier results assuming that the
23:517:42958:27:27:71:525:251:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:impact of business travelers on international knowledge diffusion is constant across industries
23:518:43053:27:28:71:524:224:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:(from Table 4, column 2). Given the interaction of business travelers with the high-patenting
23:519:43146:28:27:71:525:196:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:dummy, there are now two control functions, one from the regression on business travel on friends
23:520:43243:27:27:71:525:169:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:& family travel, as before, and one from the regression of the business travel-high patenting
23:521:43336:27:26:71:525:142:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:interaction on the friends & family travel-high patenting interaction. The interaction CF results
23:522:43433:26:14:80:525:116:36:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:F:25In order to form high versus low patenting industries, we take into account changes in the composition across
23:523:43544:14:11:71:524:102:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:F:countries when creating median and mean patent counts by industry. The high patenting dummy is equal to 1 if
23:524:43652:11:0:71:437:91:82:g_d0_f4:82:g_d0_f4:F:patent counts for a given countryin yearand industryis higher than median/mean.
24:525:43736:0:27:72:525:675:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:of columns 5 and 6 confirms the results without CF in columns 2 and 3 in that business travel
24:526:43829:27:27:72:525:648:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:affects patenting mainly in high-patenting industries. This result is along earlierfindings that
24:527:43925:27:27:72:525:621:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:foreign direct investment triggers technology spillovers for domesticfirms primarily in high-

24:529:44065:33:27:88:530:561:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:Finally, we show results from another specificationcheckinTable5onthefarright. So
24:530:44146:27:28:72:525:534:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:far our business traveler variable was adjusted for differences in the knowledge carried by each
24:531:44242:28:27:71:525:506:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:traveler by using information on whether their U.S. state of departure is a high- or low-patenting
24:532:44340:27:27:71:525:479:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:origin (see equation 1 above). Another approach would simply sum over all business travelers
24:533:44432:27:27:71:525:452:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:irrespective of from which U.S. state they come. Results for this unweighted business traveler
24:534:44526:27:27:71:524:425:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:variable are shown in columns 7 (without CF) and 8 (with CF) of Table 5. We see that the
24:535:44614:27:27:71:525:398:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:point estimates for business traveler are about one half of what they were before (see columns 1
24:536:44710:27:27:71:525:371:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:and 4 of Table 5), and moreover the unweighted business traveler coefficients are not significant
24:537:44807:27:27:71:525:344:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:at standard levels. We conclude that accounting for technological knowledge heterogeneity is
24:538:44899:27:33:71:367:317:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:very important in studying international technology diffusion.
24:539:44961:33:27:88:525:284:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:We have also conducted a number of other robustness checks, including lagging the patent
24:540:45049:27:27:71:525:257:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:variable so as to further reduce the possibility that patent applications in the U.S. simply mirror
24:541:45148:27:28:71:526:230:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:domestic patent applications, as well as laggingthe business traveler variable to allow for the
24:542:45243:28:27:71:525:202:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:possibility that it might take some time until business travel from the U.S. translates into
24:543:45335:27:27:71:525:175:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:domestic innovation.  Overall these analyses have shown that the impact from U.S. business
24:544:45425:27:33:71:399:148:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:travel on foreign countries’ rates of innovation we estimate is robust.
24:545:45496:33:0:88:281:115:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:We now turn to a concluding discussion.
25:546:45537:0:38:72:196:673:209:g_d0_f3:209:g_d0_f3:C:5Conclusions
25:547:45549:38:27:72:525:635:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:The basic premise of the paper is that face-to-face meetings might be particularly important
25:548:45641:27:27:72:526:608:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:for the transfer of technology because the latter is tacit, and therefore best explained and
25:549:45733:27:27:72:525:581:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:demonstrated in person. Along these lines this paper has examined the impact of inward business
25:550:45828:27:28:71:525:554:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:travelers in raising a country’s rate of innovation by looking at business travel from the United
25:551:45925:28:27:71:524:526:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:States to thirty-four other countries during the years 1993-2003.  The results indicate that
25:552:46017:27:27:71:525:499:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:international business travel has a significant effect. Quantitatively, the impact of business travel
25:553:46118:27:27:72:525:472:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:on innovation is sizable. It accounts in the typical case for about 10% of the total difference
25:554:46213:27:27:72:525:445:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:in patenting rates, and its contribution is about one quarter of the impact of domestic R&D
25:555:46304:27:27:72:526:418:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:spending. Moreover, there is strong evidence that the impact on innovation depends on the
25:556:46393:27:33:72:416:391:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:quality of the technological knowledge carried by each business traveler.
25:557:46466:33:27:88:525:358:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:While international migration has long been a hot topic in debates on labor market policies,
25:558:46558:27:27:72:525:331:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:some recent work has started to address anotherset of policy questions by linking long-term
25:559:46649:27:27:72:526:304:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:immigration to innovation in an economy (Peri 2007, Hunt and Gauthier-Loiselle 2010, Stuen,
25:560:46740:27:27:72:526:277:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:Mobarak, and Maskus 2012). In contrast, our research informs policymakers by examining how
25:561:46830:27:27:72:525:250:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:strongly short-term cross-border movements might affect innovation. In particular, given that
25:562:46923:27:27:72:526:223:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:entry requirements often reduce the number of business travelers that come to a country, our
25:563:47015:27:27:72:525:196:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:results provide some initial guidance on the cost of visa or other entry requirements in terms
25:564:47109:27:27:72:525:169:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:of innovation that can be compared to the benefits entry barriers might have.  Our analysis
25:565:47200:27:28:72:525:142:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:also provides a new perspective on other key policy questions, for example the liberalization of
25:566:47296:28:27:72:525:114:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:international trade in services. Specifically, thefinding that business air travel raises innovation
25:567:47396:27:0:72:525:87:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:suggests that the liberalization of international passenger air travel, by lowering fares, might
26:568:47494:0:33:72:399:675:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:yield substantial gains in terms of economic growth across countries.
26:569:47563:33:27:88:524:642:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:A:While our results suggest that short-term international labor movements could be an impor-
26:570:47653:27:27:72:525:615:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:tant way through which cross-country income differences can be reduced, more work needs to be
26:571:47746:27:27:71:525:588:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:done. A particularly promising direction of future work may be to include more geographic de-
26:572:47839:27:27:71:524:561:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:tail, perhaps isolating key states, such as California. It would also be interesting to see whether a

26:574:48031:28:27:71:525:506:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:as the inward business travel from the United States. Finally, there are important questions
26:575:48123:27:27:71:525:479:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:regarding the degree of complementarity or substitutability between cross-border travel, trade,
26:576:48218:27:0:71:320:452:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:B:and FDI that needs to be addressed by future work.
