3:70:3562:30:18:72:540:334:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:Few would disagree that bailouts are socially costly. Yet, they are commonly used to help
3:71:3651:18:17:72:540:316:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:banks and financial institutions during crises in most countries, dating as far back as the
3:72:3742:17:18:72:540:299:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:1800s.1In the recent 2008-09 financial crisis, for example, the U.S. government used a
3:73:3828:18:18:71:539:281:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:variety of instruments to bail out, on an unprecedented scale, many financial entities that
3:74:3919:18:18:71:225:263:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:were exposed to systemic risk.

3:85:4759:12:15:85:539:125:49:g_d0_f15:99:g_d0_f8:F:1In 1857, after the Livingston vs. Bank of New York case, for example, courts ordered that ‘the mere
3:86:4859:15:12:72:540:110:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:fact of suspension of specie payments when it is general is not of itself su-cient proof of fraud or injustice’,
3:87:4971:12:0:72:507:98:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:o-cially sanctioning suspensions of specie payments in case of aggregate crises and systemic events.
4:88:5072:0:18:89:539:707:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:An extensive literature, most recently represented by Farhi and Tirole (2012), provides an
4:89:5162:18:18:71:539:689:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:explanation for this phenomenon based on moral hazard–driven excessive leverage of banks,
4:90:5251:18:18:71:539:671:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:triggered by the time inconsistency of no-bailout policies. If the government faces certain
4:91:5342:18:18:71:539:653:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:losses due to bank failures in case of a shock – there may not be enough liquidity in the
4:92:5431:18:18:71:539:635:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:system because of a systemic nature of the shock, for example – then it may be tempted
4:93:5517:18:18:71:539:617:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:to bail out banks in distress ex post. Without commitment, banks internalize this ex-post
4:94:5606:18:18:71:539:599:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:reaction and hence have no incentive to avoid exposing themselves to such shocks ex ante,
4:95:5695:18:18:71:540:581:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:e↵ectively creating crises endogenously. This leads to equilibrium outcomes that are away
4:96:5784:18:18:71:539:563:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:from the social optimum (in which the government commits to no bailouts, hence disciplining
4:97:5875:18:18:71:307:545:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:bank actions and avoiding endogenous crises).
4:98:5920:18:18:89:540:527:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:Two important assumptions underlying these results are perfect observability of the state
4:99:6009:18:18:71:539:509:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:of the economy – the shocks are public information, and degenerate timing of events –
4:100:6094:18:17:71:539:491:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:all banks fail or survive at the same time. However, casual observation of crises episodes
4:101:6184:17:18:71:539:474:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:reveals that neither is satisfied in practice. The outbreak of most financial crises is rarely
4:102:6278:18:18:71:539:456:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:characterized by all financial institutions suddenly and simultaneously showing distress. As
4:103:6370:18:18:71:539:438:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:a result, policymakers are usually uncertain whether they are facing an isolated incident
4:104:6459:18:18:71:539:420:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:of distress, which can be solved internally in the financial system through mergers and
4:105:6546:18:18:71:539:402:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:acquisitions, or a more systemic event, in which output may be lost without government
4:106:6632:18:18:71:539:384:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:intervention. Hence, at least at the onset of a financial crisis, bailout decisions are taken
4:107:6725:18:18:71:539:366:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:under conditions of uncertainty, with government observing only imperfect signals of the
4:108:6813:18:18:71:432:348:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:severity of the problem: we call this situationgovernment uncertainty.
4:109:6883:18:18:89:539:330:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:In the most recent crisis, for example, when U.S. policymakers decided not to bail out

4:112:7148:18:18:71:539:276:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:system on the brink of a collapse. However, this decision was in part motivated by uncertainty
4:113:7242:18:18:71:539:258:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:about the nature of the underlying problem and by the hope that the financial system would
4:114:7332:18:17:71:539:240:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:restore normality without relying on costly public intervention.2The bailout of Continental

5:125:8170:18:18:72:540:671:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:taining commitment outcomes even when the government lacks commitment. Intuitively,
5:126:8253:18:18:72:540:653:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:at the onset of financial problems, governments are uncertain about their systemic nature,
5:127:8343:18:18:72:539:635:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f17:B:and hence about the actual need for a bailout. In order to observe more signals andlearn
5:128:8431:18:18:72:540:617:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:about the nature of the shock, the government may want todelay bailoutand let the first
5:129:8518:18:18:72:540:599:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:bank(s) in distress fail – with learning allowing it to avoid an unnecessary and potentially
5:130:8610:18:18:72:540:581:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:costly intervention. Crucially, intervention delay makes the relative performance of banks’
5:131:8701:18:18:72:540:563:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:portfolios critical for individual banks, since no bank wants to be amongst the first in line
5:132:8794:18:18:72:544:545:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:for government help. We call this e↵ectstrategic restraint,asbanksendogenouslyrestrict
5:133:8880:18:18:72:540:527:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:the riskiness of their portfolio relative to their peers in order to avoid being amongst the
5:134:8972:18:18:72:483:509:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:worst performers, inducing a sort of competition to reduce excessive risk-taking.
5:135:9053:18:17:89:539:491:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:In the model, bankers borrow short-term from households to finance projects that are
5:136:9137:17:18:72:540:474:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:illiquid. Projects may su↵er shocks over time, in which case they require extra funds to bring
5:137:9231:18:18:72:540:456:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:them to fruition. The shock hitting a project may be idiosyncratic, hitting only certain banks,
5:138:9326:18:18:72:540:438:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:or aggregate, hitting all banks. High levels of short-term debt allow banks to invest in large
5:139:9420:18:18:72:540:420:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:projects, but at the same time hinder their ability to refinance if a shock hits. We study the
5:140:9514:18:18:72:543:402:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:problem of a central authority, which we call thegovernment,whichmaximizestotalwelfare
5:141:9600:18:18:72:539:384:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:(bankers’ plus households’) using an interest rate policy that a↵ects the cost of borrowing to
5:142:9694:18:18:72:540:366:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:refinance in case of shocks. An intervention that reduces the cost of borrowing to bankers,
5:143:9785:18:18:72:545:348:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:which we call abailout,isfinancedthroughtaxesonhouseholdsinawaythatissocially
5:144:9862:18:18:72:540:330:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:costly (e.g. due to distortions). The benefits of bailouts, on the other hand, are naturally
5:145:9954:18:18:72:447:312:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:given by bringing banks’ projects to fruition, and thus increasing output.
5:146:10028:18:18:89:539:294:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:When the government observes a bank in distress – which we define as the bank running
5:147:10113:18:18:72:540:276:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:out of cash and options for refinancing on the market – it does not observe whether the shock
5:148:10206:18:18:72:540:258:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:is idiosyncratic or aggregate, information that is critical for taking appropriate action. If the
5:149:10303:18:18:72:540:240:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:shock is idiosyncratic, other banks have enough liquidity to take over the distressed bank,
5:150:10394:18:17:72:540:222:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:and no intervention is needed. If the shock is aggregate, intervention is the only way to avoid
5:151:10489:17:18:72:540:205:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:a project failure. Hence, the government’s decision to bail out the bank or not depends on
5:152:10579:18:18:72:280:187:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:its beliefs about the nature of the shock.
5:153:10621:18:18:89:539:169:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:We show that, if the government is initially relatively optimistic it is not facing an
5:154:10707:18:18:72:540:151:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:aggregate shock, then it chooses to learn more by delaying intervention, not bailing out the
5:155:10799:18:18:72:540:133:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:first distressed bank(s). By delaying the bailout, the government maintains the option of
5:156:10888:18:18:72:540:115:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:introducing the bailout at a later time – after observing subsequent signals (further bank
5:157:10978:18:0:72:540:97:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:distress) – under a more precise belief about the true state. For the banks, on the other
6:158:11068:0:18:72:540:707:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:hand, delay introduces an incentive to avoid being the worst performers. In the model, this
6:159:11159:18:18:72:540:689:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:happens through banks leveraging less and carrying more cash reserves than its peers for
6:160:11247:18:18:72:540:671:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:the eventuality of being hit by the refinancing shock, at the cost of downsizing its project.
6:161:11340:18:18:72:540:653:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:This is thestrategic restrainte↵ect, which gives Bertrand-style competition among banks
6:162:11427:18:18:72:540:635:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:for lower leverage. We show that in the unique equilibrium of the economy, banks compete
6:163:11515:18:18:72:540:617:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:away all excessive leverage, and the allocation coincides with the one which obtains under
6:164:11605:18:18:72:503:599:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:commitment, here driven by government uncertainty and strategic restraint instead.
6:165:11687:18:18:89:539:581:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:In our benchmark, we consider a stark case in which banks can guarantee not being the
6:166:11772:18:18:72:540:563:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:worst performer by choosing slightly lower leverage relative to other banks.  Our results,
6:167:11862:18:18:72:540:545:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:however, are robust to relaxing this assumption. In an extended environment, we consider
6:168:11950:18:18:72:540:527:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:shocks to cash holdings of individual banks, such that small deviations in leverage do not
6:169:12040:18:18:72:539:509:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f17:B:guarantee outperfoming other banks. In this case, we show that thegovernment uncertainty
6:170:12128:18:17:72:540:491:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:andstrategic restraintforces still operate, moving the equilibrium allocation towards the op-
6:171:12221:17:18:72:540:474:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:timal (commitment) outcome. In this case, however, the unique equilibrium achieves leverage
6:172:12312:18:18:72:540:456:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:that is intermediate between the commitment (optimal) and non-commitment (ine-cient)
6:173:12396:18:18:72:362:438:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:equilibrium, the benchmark model being a limiting case.
6:174:12451:18:18:89:539:420:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:Given thatgovernment uncertaintyandstrategic restraintforces robustly implement allo-
6:175:12536:18:18:72:540:402:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:cations that dominate the non-commitment equilibrium in terms of welfare (the benchmark
6:176:12623:18:18:72:540:384:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:achieving the optimum), natural policy questions arise regarding the e↵ect of regulation and
6:177:12715:18:18:72:539:366:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:economic environment on the e↵ectiveness of these e↵ects. How does financial innovation
6:178:12802:18:18:72:539:348:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:a↵ect uncertainty and the likelihood of endogenous crises? Is government uncertainty more
6:179:12891:18:18:72:540:330:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:e↵ective when there are many banks? Is it more e↵ective when banks are of similar size?
6:180:12978:18:18:72:280:312:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:We address these questions in the paper.
6:181:13018:18:18:89:538:294:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:We model financial innovation as a↵ecting the ability of banks to insure away part of their
6:182:13109:18:18:71:539:276:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:idiosyncratic risk, for example by trading securitized products or over-the-counter deriva-
6:183:13200:18:18:71:539:258:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:tives.  In the benchmark model, any level of insurance introduces di↵erences in the cash
6:184:13288:18:18:72:540:240:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:position of banks which depend on the type of shocks: when the shock is idiosyncratic, the
6:185:13378:18:17:72:539:222:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:a↵ected bank has more cash to refinance because it has claims on healthy projects of other
6:186:13468:17:18:72:540:205:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:banks. This di↵erence in cash translates into a clear di↵erence between idiosyncratic and
6:187:13557:18:18:72:540:187:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:aggregate shocks in when the bank is going to run out of cash and financing options, and
6:188:13645:18:18:72:540:169:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:hence when it is going to show distress. In the benchmark, cash and time of distress are
6:189:13733:18:18:72:540:151:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:deterministically connected, and hence the government can perfectly infer the shock from
6:190:13821:18:18:72:540:133:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:the time the bank becomes distressed. Hence, perhaps surprisingly, we show that in the
6:191:13907:18:18:72:539:115:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:benchmark model, foranylevel of insurance, imperfect information plays no role and the
6:192:13993:18:0:71:539:97:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:equilibrium of the economy coincides with one with no government uncertainty, leading to
7:193:14082:0:18:72:434:707:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:an ine-cient equilibrium allocation (the non-commitement allocation).
7:194:14151:18:18:89:540:689:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:This result hinges on the ability to perfectly infer the underlying state from the time the
7:195:14242:18:18:72:540:671:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:bank becomes distressed, which is relaxed in our extended environment discussed earlier.
7:196:14330:18:18:72:540:653:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:With shocks to cash holdings, the government knows only theaveragetime of distress under
7:197:14418:18:18:72:540:635:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks, and hence the inference from the actual time of distress to
7:198:14513:18:18:72:540:617:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:the underlying shock is imperfect. This preserves the government uncertainty and strategic
7:199:14603:18:18:72:539:599:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:restraint forces in economies with su-ciently imperfect insurance. In particular, we derive
7:200:14694:18:18:71:539:581:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:a cap on the fraction of idiosyncratic risk that can be insured away, which still allows for
7:201:14786:18:18:71:539:563:143:g_d0_f17:143:g_d0_f5:B:government uncertaintyto lead to welfare-superior allocations. We find the cap to be an
7:202:14873:18:18:71:539:545:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:increasing function of the variance of the shocks to cash holdings. These results point to
7:203:14963:18:18:71:539:527:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:an unexplored e↵ect of financial innovation, such as securitization, in that it hinders the
7:204:15054:18:18:71:540:509:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:e↵ectiveness of government uncertainty and strategic restraint in implementing commitment
7:205:15143:18:17:71:539:491:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:outcomes, by reducing the government’s value of delaying the bailout and learning. This
7:206:15230:17:18:71:376:474:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:suggests a new rationale for regulating financial innovation.
7:207:15291:18:18:89:538:456:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:We also explore the role of industry concentration, measured by the number of banks.
7:208:15375:18:18:71:539:438:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:A larger number of banks strengthens our two forces that induce governments to delay
7:209:15459:18:18:71:539:420:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:intervention. First, governments become more optimistic that there exists a healthy bank
7:210:15547:18:18:71:539:402:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:able to take over a bank in distress. Second, there is a larger option value of learning the
7:211:15639:18:18:71:539:384:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:true state, by allowing the first bank in distress to fail, and making better decisions later
7:212:15732:18:18:71:539:366:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:for a larger number of banks. The overall result is that decreasing industry concentration
7:213:15822:18:18:71:347:348:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:makes commitment outcomes more easily sustainable.
7:214:15872:18:18:89:540:330:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:Finally, we study the e↵ect of bank size heterogeneity. When a single bank is asymmet-
7:215:15958:18:18:71:539:312:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:rically large in the industry, it is less likely that it can be acquired by its peers and hence
7:216:16053:18:18:71:539:294:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:more likely that the government must bail it out in case of distress, even if it is the first bank
7:217:16151:18:18:71:540:276:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:experiencing problems. Hence, with su-cient asymmetry in bank size, large banks do not
7:218:16237:18:18:72:540:258:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:have any concern for their relative performance and choose excessive leverage. Given this
7:219:16326:18:18:72:540:240:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:behavior, smaller banks have a strategic incentive to increase their leverage relative their
7:220:16418:18:17:72:540:222:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:leverage in the symmetric case: they choose to expose themselves only slightly less than the
7:221:16510:17:18:72:540:205:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:large bank. In our setting, the ‘too big to fail’ problem shows up very di↵erently than in the
7:222:16604:18:18:72:540:187:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:rest of the literature because large banks become shields for smaller banks to take excessive
7:223:16697:18:18:72:540:169:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:risk, exerting a negative externality on the economy by inducing endogenous systemic crises

8:227:16985:0:18:72:540:707:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:papers, extensively reviewed in Stern and Feldman (2004), argue that the existence of ‘too
8:228:17075:18:18:72:540:689:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:big to fail’ banks is the source of the time inconsistency of policies, and at the root of crises.
8:229:17173:18:18:72:540:671:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:Another strand of the literature, most recently represented by Acharya and Yorulmazer
8:230:17258:18:18:72:540:653:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:(2007), Pasten (2011) and especially Farhi and Tirole (2012) argue that ’too big to fail’
8:231:17347:18:18:72:540:635:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:banks are not necessary and coordinated actions by smaller banks give rise to endogenous
8:232:17435:18:18:72:540:617:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:crises too. The results in this paper apply in both environments, always working towards
8:233:17523:18:18:72:496:599:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:putting more discipline on bank actions and achieving welfare-superior allocations.
8:234:17606:18:18:89:540:581:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:Our setting builds on Holmstr ̈om and Tirole (1998) and Farhi and Tirole (2012). Relative
8:235:17695:18:18:72:540:563:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:to their work, we introduce idiosyncratic shocks and the possibility of government uncertainty
8:236:17789:18:18:72:540:545:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:about the nature of the shock. We additionally allow for e-cient takeovers of distressed
8:237:17877:18:18:72:540:527:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:banks by healthy banks, making the true nature of the shock crucial for the government. In
8:238:17967:18:18:72:533:509:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:contrast to their work, the timing of bank distress at the onset of a crisis is critical for us.
8:239:18063:18:17:89:540:491:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:Our work also relates to Acharya and Yorulmazer (2007), who develop a model of ‘too-
8:240:18147:17:18:72:540:474:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:many to fail’ in an environment where bank takeovers are also possible and technologically
8:241:18237:18:18:72:540:456:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:superior to bailouts, as in our paper.  In our model, the ‘wait and see’ strategy of the
8:242:18325:18:18:72:540:438:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:government has the additional gain of providing information to the government about the
8:243:18412:18:18:72:540:420:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:nature of the shocks, which createsstrategic restraintand hinders the possibility of herding
8:244:18504:18:18:72:172:402:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:that they highlight.
8:245:18524:18:18:89:539:384:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:Recently, Green (2010) and Keister (2011) argue that bailouts may be optimal to avoid
8:246:18609:18:18:72:540:366:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:excessive hoarding of liquidity. In a similar vein, Cheng and Milbradt (2010) suggest bailouts
8:247:18703:18:18:72:540:348:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:can instill confidence on credit markets. In our setup, whatever the optimal level of liquidity
8:248:18798:18:18:72:540:330:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:is, it can be attained as long as government uncertainty and strategic restraint forces are at
8:249:18892:18:18:72:288:312:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:work, even in the absence of commitment.
8:250:18932:18:18:89:539:294:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:Bianchi (2012) concludes that moral hazard e↵ects of bailouts are significantly mitigated
8:251:19021:18:18:72:540:276:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:by making bailouts contingent on the occurrence of a systemic financial crisis. In contrast,
8:252:19113:18:18:72:540:258:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:in our framework shocks are unobservable and hence the government cannot make bailouts
8:253:19199:18:18:72:540:240:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:contingent upon them. This gives rise to a positive option of delay and learning, which is
8:254:19289:18:17:72:329:222:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:exactly what mitigates the moral hazard problem.
8:255:19337:17:18:89:539:205:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:Davila (2012) also argues, as in our extension to asymmetric bank sizes, that large banks
8:256:19426:18:18:72:540:187:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:allow small banks to take more risks, making the economy-wide leverage and probability of
8:257:19515:18:18:72:540:169:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:bailouts larger when large banks are present. While his results are based on banks’ uncer-
8:258:19605:18:18:72:540:151:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:tainty about bailout policies, ours depend on governments’ uncertainty about the nature of
8:259:19695:18:18:72:128:133:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:the shocks.
8:260:19706:18:18:89:544:115:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:Arecentstrandoftheliteraturehighlightsthee↵ectsofpolicyuncertaintyininducing
8:261:19782:18:0:72:540:97:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:crises and delaying recoveries. Cukierman and Izhakian (2011), for example, show that un-
9:262:19872:0:18:72:540:707:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:certainty about policymakers’s actions can induce sudden financial collapses when investors
9:263:19963:18:18:72:540:689:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:follow a max-min behavior. Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2012) argue that uncertainty about
9:264:20049:18:18:72:540:671:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:future policies delays recoveries since individuals prefer to ’wait and see.’ In our case, it
9:265:20142:18:18:72:540:653:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:is the government who is uncertain about the nature of refinancing shocks and may like to
9:266:20231:18:18:72:473:635:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:’wait and see’ before intervening, reducing the likelihood of endogenous crises.
9:267:20311:18:18:89:539:617:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:Finally, there is a previous literature that explores the ability of imperfect information
9:268:20401:18:18:72:540:599:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:to improve equilibrium outcomes under time inconsistency. Cremer (1995) shows in a static
9:269:20490:18:18:72:540:581:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:game that the inability of a principal to observe workers’ types can serve as a commitment
9:270:20580:18:18:72:540:563:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:device to punishing low output realizations, while Carrillo and Mariotti (2000) show that
9:271:20669:18:18:72:540:545:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:an agent with time-inconsistent preferences might optimally choose not to learn in order to
9:272:20760:18:18:72:540:527:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:restrict future selves. The e↵ect of imperfect information in our model has a similar flavor,
9:273:20853:18:18:72:540:509:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:but in our banking setting, the competition that arises from the banks’ concerns for their
9:274:20943:18:17:72:540:491:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:relative position is critical for our results, and is absent in their settings. Furthermore, our
9:275:21039:17:18:72:540:474:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:setting is dynamic, and the government not only delays because of imperfect information
9:276:21126:18:18:72:519:456:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:but also because there are gains from learning and resolving the imperfect information.
9:277:21213:18:18:89:539:438:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:In what follows, we first set up a simple analytical example in order to illustrate the main
9:278:21305:18:18:72:540:420:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:forces behind our arguments. Then, we provide a micro-founded model of these forces, first
9:279:21395:18:18:72:540:402:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:analyzing the model under full information as a benchmark and then introducing imperfect
9:280:21483:18:18:72:540:384:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:information to derive our main results. Next, we discuss policy implications. Finally, we
9:281:21572:18:45:72:322:366:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:conclude and discuss avenues for future research.
9:282:21621:45:30:72:238:321:296:g_d0_f11:296:g_d0_f11:C:2  Simple Example
9:283:21638:30:18:72:540:291:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:Consider an economy with two banking entrepreneurs (banks or firms more generally) that

9:290:22223:18:18:72:475:166:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:requires a unit of cash and it is not possible to increase the size of the project.

10:295:22624:0:18:89:539:707:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:We assume that, in case of an idiosyncratic shock, thehealthy bank(the one with a

10:298:22880:18:18:71:539:653:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:has enough resources to refinance the distressed project fully. In this situation, the healthy

10:301:23109:18:18:89:539:599:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:There is also a government in the economy that can contribute to refinance an additional

14:442:32328:18:18:71:539:323:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:are (i) low gains from public refinancing (lowx), (ii) high gains from private refinancing (high

14:444:32518:18:18:89:539:287:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:An important assumption here is that governments cannot help banks little by little,
14:445:32602:18:18:71:539:269:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:maintaining them alive until learning the nature of the shock. Hence, if the shock is aggregate
14:446:32697:18:18:71:515:251:143:g_d0_f5:64:g_d0_f12:B:and governments do not help banks immediately to refinance fully, the project is lost.5
14:447:32784:18:18:89:540:233:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:How do the banks react to the fact that the government is uncertain about the nature of
14:448:32871:18:18:71:539:215:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:shocks? If the delayed bailout condition (4) isnotsatisfied, then banks know they would be
14:449:32961:18:18:71:545:197:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:bailed out whenever their project is in distress, always obtainingYregardless ofc.Further-
14:450:33051:18:18:71:539:179:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:more, in case of being healthy under an idiosyncratic shock they receive a windfall of public
14:451:33144:18:17:71:539:161:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:transfers that depends on when the other bank shows distress. This implies that, conditional
14:452:33236:17:16:85:539:144:49:g_d0_f15:99:g_d0_f8:F:5This assumption is certainly realistic for financial intermediaries with very high leverage on overnight
14:453:33341:16:12:72:540:128:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:debt. In thinking about non-financial corporations, however, this assumption seems less plausible, which
14:454:33445:12:12:72:540:116:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:is consistent with more targeted and gradual bailouts in real activity, such as the reorganization of car

15:490:35354:18:15:85:539:135:49:g_d0_f15:99:g_d0_f8:F:6Note, however, that this result is independent of Assumption B when information is imperfect.  If

16:503:36148:18:17:72:540:384:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:happen is that the government remains relatively confident that the shock is idiosyncratic,

16:511:36790:28:18:89:539:221:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:The simple example of this section illustrates the main mechanism behind the e↵ective-

16:514:37055:18:18:72:540:167:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:founded model of these forces. In particular, we model the benefits and costs of private and
16:515:37147:18:18:72:540:149:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:public liquidity provision and we endogenize both the size of projects and the order in which

17:519:37365:18:18:72:540:659:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:with several important modifications. First, we introduce two types of shocks, aggregate and
17:520:37457:18:18:72:540:641:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:idiosyncratic, and allow for imperfect information about the nature of the shock. Second,

17:522:37636:18:18:72:540:605:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:endogenously show distress earlier. Third, we admit the possibility of healthy banks takeover

17:527:37936:18:18:72:540:487:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:households and a government. Banks borrow short-term to finance illiquid projects which

21:662:46812:18:18:72:539:455:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:refinance, and hence the level of refinancing. For example, if the government setsR=⇢0,
21:663:46899:18:18:72:539:437:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:the interest rate is exactly equal to the pledgeable amount⇢0and banks are able to refinance

21:677:48089:15:12:72:540:189:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:(i.e. cash holdings go to zero), and cannot continue the project unless intervention or takeover take place.
21:678:48197:12:12:72:539:177:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:For a more general set of policies (i.e.R>⇢0), intervention would have to take place earlier, and for some

21:682:48624:12:12:71:539:129:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:distress, it would generate a strictly positive option value of waiting until the last possible moment before

30:977:67470:18:17:72:539:284:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:argument is how any deviationc6=c0a↵ects the probability that the bank is the first one

30:979:67631:18:18:89:540:249:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:Note that a marginal deviation upwards fromc=c0(i.e. carrying slightlymoreliquidity

31:996:68696:31:18:89:540:555:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f17:A:The statement of the proposition follows from applying thestrategic restraint condition
31:997:68783:18:18:72:539:537:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:to all cases in which thedelayed bailout conditionholds. In all such cases, the value of being
31:998:68877:18:18:71:539:519:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:the second bank in distress is discontinuously higher that the value of being the first bank
31:999:68969:18:17:71:539:501:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:in distress. Following a Bertrand-style undercutting argument, banks want to deviate from

31:1001:69135:18:18:71:452:466:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:and no more incentives to deviate, since banks can self-finance completely.
31:1002:69210:18:18:89:540:448:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:The starkness of the above result relies on the discrete change in probabilities driven by

31:1004:69382:18:18:71:539:412:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:it requires that banks can perfectly control their time of distress by their cash choice. In
31:1005:69474:18:18:71:539:394:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:the next subsection, we generalize our result to an environment with ex-post shocks to cash
31:1006:69565:18:18:71:539:376:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:holdings, such that small deviations in ex-ante cash choices do not guarantee a bank being
31:1007:69655:18:18:71:539:358:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:second in showing distress, only changing the relative position in a probabilistic way. We
31:1008:69745:18:18:71:539:340:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:derive an analogous result, showing that the Bertrand type competition still plays a role in
31:1009:69837:18:39:71:464:322:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:bringing the equilibrium allocation closer to the optimum with commitment.

31:1011:69947:25:18:72:543:258:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:Here we consider a shock to the cash position of the bank att=1,aftertherefinancingshock
31:1012:70035:18:18:72:540:240:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:has been realized. A positive shock implies that the bank holds more cash than planned (for
31:1013:70126:18:18:72:540:222:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:example the certain return was higher than expected) while a negative shock implies the
31:1014:70213:18:18:72:540:204:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:bank holds less cash than planned (for example there was an unexpected expense to cover
31:1015:70300:18:36:72:453:186:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:during the previous period). Formally, the cash available for refinancing is

35:1212:76359:18:18:89:539:344:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:Intuitively, from expression (18), the benefits from deviating and holding more cash than

36:1228:77536:26:18:72:540:606:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:This section analyzes how the information available to governments and the incentives of
36:1229:77624:18:18:72:540:588:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:banks change with the level of financial innovation in the economy that allows banks to
36:1230:77711:18:18:72:540:570:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:insure away part of their idiosyncratic risk. We allow banks to diversify their risk by holding
36:1231:77806:18:18:72:540:552:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:claims on other banks’ projects and selling a part of their own project. There are a number
36:1232:77897:18:17:72:540:534:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:of financial arrangements that would achieve that goal. One is that banks sell a fraction of
36:1233:77989:17:18:72:540:517:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:claims on their project to a pool, and then hold the pool of the industry in proportions equal

36:1241:78697:18:18:72:539:373:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:We use a securitization example to fix ideas, but the logic of this section can be applied more
36:1242:78792:18:18:72:432:355:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:broadly to any financial arrangement or innovation that diversify risk.
36:1243:78863:18:18:89:540:337:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:Formally, the level of securitization is summarized by the fractionsof the project that a

36:1245:79045:18:18:71:543:301:143:g_d0_f18:143:g_d0_f5:B:s=1/2impliesthatthebankdiversifiesidiosyncraticriskscompletely,gettingtheaverage

36:1247:79215:18:17:71:194:265:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:1-sof its own project.
36:1248:79237:17:18:89:539:248:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:High level of securitization in the economy has the benefits of providing more diversifi-
36:1249:79326:18:18:71:539:230:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:cation to banks, which results in less need for accessing the market for additional funds. It
36:1250:79419:18:18:71:539:212:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:has, however, the cost of reducing the level of government uncertainty. In our setup, banks
36:1251:79510:18:18:71:539:194:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:are risk neutral and hence there are no benefits from diversification, but only costs in terms
36:1252:79604:18:18:71:386:176:143:g_d0_f5:64:g_d0_f12:B:of possibly inducing ine-cient, non-commitment, outcomes.16
36:1253:79663:18:18:89:540:158:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:First, we show that in our benchmark,anylevel of securitization completely removes

36:1257:80040:12:0:72:450:94:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:commitment outcomes – which are much less studied and understood in the literature.

37:1289:81593:26:18:89:540:232:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:The above proposition is very intuitive: any level of securitization introduces a di↵erence

39:1421:85817:25:18:72:540:200:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:In what follows we study the government incentives to bail out the first bank in distress
39:1422:85906:18:18:72:539:182:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:whenN>2. For any number of banks, not bailing out thefirstbank in distress is enough
39:1423:85990:18:18:72:540:164:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:to trigger strategic restraints and obtain commitment-like outcomes. Below, we show that
39:1424:86078:18:18:72:540:146:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:having more banks in the economy reduces the incentives to bailout the first bank in distress
39:1425:86171:18:18:72:540:128:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:due to two forces. First, more banks increase the option value of waiting and learning about
39:1426:86263:18:18:72:540:110:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:the true nature of the shock. Second, more banks may reduce the likelihood there is not a
39:1427:86352:18:0:72:537:92:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:healthy bank able to save the first bank in distress. We analyze these forces in turn below.
40:1428:86446:0:18:89:538:707:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f18:A:Denote byp(N,d)|sthe probability of havingdbanks in distress conditional on havingN
40:1429:86529:18:18:72:540:689:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:banks in total and observingsbank already showing distress. For example,p(2,2)|1⌘P02is
40:1430:86615:18:18:71:539:671:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:the updated probability of an aggregate shock after observing one bank in distress from the
40:1431:86706:18:18:71:242:653:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:previous discussion whenN=2.
40:1432:86734:18:18:89:539:635:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:We first consider a case in which the probability of an aggregate shock (allNbanks have
40:1433:86821:18:18:71:540:617:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:a liquidity shock) is independent ofN, and a counterfactual policy of bailing out for sure
40:1434:86911:18:18:71:539:599:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:the second bank in distress. This case highlights an option value element in the incentives
40:1435:87002:18:31:71:277:581:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:of the government to delay intervention.
40:1436:87042:31:18:71:539:550:143:g_d0_f11:143:g_d0_f17:F:Lemma 3Letbx=0,p(N,N)|1=pfor allN. If the government bails out for sure the second
40:1437:87124:18:30:71:468:532:143:g_d0_f17:143:g_d0_f17:C:bank in distress, then the condition for delayed bailout isp<1-xyfor allN.
40:1438:87198:30:18:89:539:502:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:This Lemma is an important benchmark to understand the e↵ects ofNin the condition
40:1439:87279:18:18:71:539:484:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:for delay. Under the assumptions in the Lemma the number of banksNdoes not a↵ect the
40:1440:87363:18:18:71:539:466:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:conditions for delaying intervention on the first bank. This result, however depends on two
40:1441:87454:18:18:71:539:448:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:restrictions. First, the second bank in distress is bailed out. Second, the probability of an
40:1442:87547:18:18:71:359:430:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:aggregate shock is independent on the number of banks.
40:1443:87601:18:18:89:539:412:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:In the next two lemmas we separately relax these two restrictions and isolate the two
40:1444:87686:18:18:71:539:394:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:forces for which more banks induce governments to delay intervention more likely.  The
40:1445:87772:18:18:71:544:376:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f16:B:first force is theoption value of waiting and seeing,whichworksthroughmakingthecuto↵

40:1447:87944:18:18:72:546:340:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:more mechanical, alower likelihood of an aggregate shock,whichworksthroughmaking
40:1448:88024:18:18:72:540:322:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:governments more optimistic that there is at least some healthy bank able to take over the
40:1449:88114:18:31:72:325:304:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:first bank in distress when there are many banks.
40:1450:88163:31:18:72:540:273:143:g_d0_f11:143:g_d0_f17:F:Lemma 4For allN, letbx=0,p(N,N)|1=p,p(N,N-1)|2,to=p0conditional on the first bank

40:1452:88335:17:31:72:530:238:143:g_d0_f17:143:g_d0_f17:C:(nto). The delayed bailout condition of the first bank is more easily satisfied for largerN.
40:1453:88427:31:18:72:540:207:143:g_d0_f11:143:g_d0_f17:F:Lemma 5Assumebx=0. Let1-↵be the probability of an aggregate shock, and if there is
40:1454:88509:18:18:71:540:189:143:g_d0_f17:143:g_d0_f17:F:no aggregate shock, let each bank have a liquidity shock with probability1--. Also, assume
40:1455:88599:18:18:71:539:171:143:g_d0_f17:143:g_d0_f17:F:governments always bailout second banks in distress. Then the probability to delay the bailout
40:1456:88693:18:31:71:339:153:143:g_d0_f17:143:g_d0_f17:C:of the first bank in distress weakly increases withN.
40:1457:88746:31:18:89:539:122:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:The proofs of these three lemmas are in the Appendix. Their combination leads to the
40:1458:88830:18:0:71:179:104:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:following Proposition
41:1459:88853:0:18:72:540:707:143:g_d0_f11:143:g_d0_f17:F:Proposition 7The larger the number of banks in the economy, the more likely governments
41:1460:88940:18:31:71:346:689:143:g_d0_f17:143:g_d0_f17:C:delay interventions when banks start showing distress.
41:1461:88994:31:18:89:540:658:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:In words, a larger number of banks introduce two forces that delay government interven-
41:1462:89081:18:18:71:539:640:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:tion and lead to strategic restraints. Lemma 3 shows a benchmark, under which the number
41:1463:89169:18:18:71:540:622:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:of banks does not a↵ect the probability of an aggregate shock and does not a↵ect the option
41:1464:89260:18:18:72:539:604:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:value of delaying, since we impose bailouts of a second bank shows distress. In this case, the
41:1465:89354:18:18:72:486:586:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:government’s incentives to delay bailouts is independent of the number of banks.
41:1466:89434:18:18:89:539:568:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:Lemma 4 relaxes the assumption that governments have to intervene if a second bank is
41:1467:89519:18:17:72:540:550:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:in distress. This introduces the option value of not bailing out the first bank and having the
41:1468:89613:17:18:72:540:533:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:chance to make the optimal decision of not bailing out if other banks show distress. This
41:1469:89702:18:18:72:540:515:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:Lemma shows that more banks makes more valuable the option value of learning and making
41:1470:89789:18:18:72:196:497:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:better decisions ex-post.
41:1471:89814:18:18:89:539:479:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:Lemma 5 relaxes the assumption that the probability of an aggregate shock is independent
41:1472:89902:18:18:72:539:461:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:ofN. E↵ectively, it is less likely that no bank is healthy when there are many banks, and
41:1473:89991:18:18:72:540:443:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:then less likely that the first bank in distress is not taken over and fails in case of not being
41:1474:90088:18:18:72:226:425:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:bailed out by the government.
41:1475:90117:18:18:89:539:407:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:These last two forces complement each other. When there are many banks in the industry
41:1476:90203:18:18:72:540:389:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:and a bank shows distress, it is less likely it fails if not bailed out and it is more valuable for
41:1477:90302:18:39:72:221:371:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:governments to wait and see.

41:1479:90356:25:18:72:540:307:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:This section studies the e↵ects of asymmetric bank sizes on governments’ incentives to delay
41:1480:90448:18:18:72:545:289:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:bailouts.  Our goal is to analyze the impact oftoo big to fail banks,thisisbankswhose
41:1481:90533:18:18:72:473:271:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:balance sheets are very large relative to the next biggest bank in the industry.
41:1482:90613:18:18:89:539:253:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:Formally, we modify the benchmark by assuming that Bank 1 has higher initial assets
41:1483:90696:18:18:72:540:235:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:than Bank 2, i.e.A1>A2.  Such ex-ante asymmetry will imply ex-post asymmetry in
41:1484:90775:18:18:72:540:217:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:investment size and consequently a healthy Bank 2 may not have enough funds to take over
41:1485:90863:18:18:72:544:199:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:adistressedBank1.Specifically,Bank2’savailablecash,whichpotentiallycanbeusedto

42:1497:91289:18:18:71:539:689:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:cash. Clearly, for large enough asymmetry, the latter is going to be strictly smaller than the
42:1498:91383:18:18:71:401:671:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:former and the project will be scaled down even under takeover.

42:1549:92804:45:30:72:201:222:296:g_d0_f11:296:g_d0_f11:C:6  Conclusions
42:1550:92818:30:18:72:540:192:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:At the onset of financial crises, banks usually tend to show distress sequentially.  Then,
42:1551:92908:18:18:72:540:174:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:initially, when deciding whether to intervene or not, governments are uncertain about the
42:1552:92997:18:17:72:540:156:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:nature of the problem at hand. We show that suchgovernment uncertaintyleads governments
42:1553:93084:17:18:72:540:139:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:to delay bailouts in order to learn further about the nature of the underlying situation
42:1554:93172:18:16:81:540:121:49:g_d0_f15:99:g_d0_f8:F:18Since the payo↵function for Bank 2 is discontinuous atc2= 0, its supremum is not attainable. Still, if
42:1555:93276:16:12:71:539:105:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:cash is discretely undivisible, then the cash holding of Bank 2 is given by one unit of cash, regardless of how
42:1556:93387:12:0:71:217:93:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:small the unit of measurement is.
43:1557:93422:0:18:72:540:707:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:from market outcomes. Crucially, such delays introduce incentives for banks to compete,
43:1558:93509:18:18:72:540:689:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f17:B:in Bertrand-style fashion, for their relative performance, giving rise to endogenousstrategic

43:1560:93675:18:18:89:539:653:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:We show that these novel forces have dramatic e↵ects on the equilibrium outcomes in
43:1561:93758:18:18:72:540:635:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:the economy. In seminal models of banking and liquidity choices, Holmstr ̈om and Tirole
43:1562:93845:18:18:72:540:617:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:(1998) and Farhi and Tirole (2012) show that no commitment can lead to endogenous crises
43:1563:93933:18:18:72:539:599:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:and ine-cient bailouts. Modellinggovernment uncertaintyradically changes these results,
43:1564:94020:18:18:72:540:581:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:moving the economy from ine-ciently high levels of leverage to e-cient levels, even in the
43:1565:94110:18:18:72:196:563:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:absence of commitment.
43:1566:94132:18:18:89:540:545:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:Based on these insights we provide a novel discussion of how financial innovations, bank-
43:1567:94221:18:18:72:540:527:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:ing concentration and asymmetric bank sizes can induce endogenous systemic events. In our
43:1568:94310:18:18:72:540:509:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:case this works through the e↵ects of these aspects of the banking industry on the inference
43:1569:94402:18:17:72:441:491:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:problem of the government and the ensuing strategic behavior of banks.
43:1570:94472:17:18:89:540:474:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:The literature has identified the time-inconsistency of governments’ policies as an impor-
43:1571:94562:18:18:72:540:456:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:tant justification for macro-prudential regulation and direct overseeing of banks’ activities.
43:1572:94656:18:18:72:540:438:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:However, historically regulators have been incapable to design macro-prudential regulation
43:1573:94746:18:18:72:540:420:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:that prevents crises without choking o↵growth. Our work suggests that it may be optimal
43:1574:94833:18:18:72:540:402:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:for governments to design political structures that delay bailouts decisions, or regulatory
43:1575:94924:18:18:72:540:384:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:standards that maintain an optimal level of uncertainty, imposing lower burdens on pre-
43:1576:95011:18:18:72:540:366:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:ventive regulation and giving more room to facilitate optimal self-regulation. Contrary to
43:1577:95101:18:18:72:540:348:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:the common view that information and speed of action are desirable characteristics of pol-
43:1578:95191:18:18:72:540:330:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:icymakers, it may be the case that banks’ perception about policymakers reacting fast to
43:1579:95279:18:18:72:540:312:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:systemic events give them incentives to coordinate on those, endogenously generating crises.
43:1580:95371:18:18:89:539:294:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:Our framework can be extended in several directions to address other interesting questions
43:1581:95461:18:18:72:540:276:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:regarding bank bailouts, information frictions and time consistency. One natural extension of
43:1582:95554:18:18:72:539:258:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f17:B:our analysis is to include the possibility of contagion, where a failure of one bank maytrigger
43:1583:95649:18:18:72:540:240:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:the need for refinancing of other banks. Our benchmark model can be easily extended to
43:1584:95735:18:17:72:540:222:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:include an exogenous probability of contagion, interpreted as an increase in the probability of
43:1585:95830:17:18:72:540:205:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:an aggregate shock, conditional on one project failing. This possibility lowers the probability
43:1586:95925:18:18:72:540:187:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:that there will be enough liquidity in the system if the first bank in distress is allowed to
43:1587:96018:18:18:72:540:169:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:fail, which reduces the incentives of the government to delay bailouts, making commitment
43:1588:96107:18:18:72:540:151:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:outcomes harder to obtain.19This is naturally a very crude way of thinking about contagion.
43:1589:96198:18:15:81:539:133:49:g_d0_f15:99:g_d0_f8:F:19Formally, we can modify the benchmark model’s stochastic structure by introducing a probability-that
43:1590:96300:15:12:72:540:118:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:the situation is contagious. This can be modeled as an increase in the probability of an aggregate shock from
43:1591:96409:12:12:72:540:106:99:g_d0_f23:99:g_d0_f8:F:P2toP2+-, conditional on one project failing. If the contagion shock is independent of the other refinancing
43:1592:96517:12:0:72:539:94:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:F:shocks, then the delayed bailout condition becomesbP02=P2+-P1+P2+->P02, meaning that the delayed bailout
44:1593:96623:0:18:72:533:707:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:Modeling its micro-foundations may be important in evaluating the welfare costs of delay.
44:1594:96712:18:18:89:539:689:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:Another avenue to explore is the solvency versus liquidity nature of banks’ distress.
44:1595:96797:18:18:72:540:671:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:This particular uncertainty always haunt governments when there are bank runs, since their
44:1596:96887:18:18:72:540:653:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:optimal response depends on the nature of the distress. In case of insolvency, the bank should
44:1597:96981:18:18:72:540:635:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:be wound down; in case of illiquidity, its assets should be replenished. Our model in this
44:1598:97071:18:18:72:540:617:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:paper is not equipped to address this issue. By assumption, the project size deterministically
44:1599:97165:18:18:72:540:599:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:determines the speed of cash outflows of the project, and every time the project needs
44:1600:97251:18:18:72:540:581:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:refinancing, it is still a positive net present value investment. Hence, all shocks are liquidity
44:1601:97348:18:18:72:540:563:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:shocks.  In ongoing work, we explore an alternative environment in which the inference
44:1602:97434:18:18:72:540:545:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:problem of the government is about finding out whether the underlying problem of the bank
44:1603:97523:18:18:72:515:527:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:is insolvency or illiquidity, and then deciding whether to save the project at all or not.
44:1604:97613:18:18:89:539:509:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:A:Finally, in this paper we focus solely on risk-free loans, where banks cannot default on
44:1605:97701:18:17:72:540:491:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:their debt.  Hence, all bailouts in the model are bailouts of equity holders and not debt
44:1606:97790:17:18:72:540:474:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:holders. In an extension that allows for default, interest rates would include a premium for
44:1607:97882:18:18:72:540:456:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:the expected probability of default, which clearly depends on whether a bailout to lenders is
44:1608:97975:18:18:72:540:438:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:expected in case of default. If banks and lenders expect bailouts in case of a systemic event,
44:1609:98069:18:18:72:539:420:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:the premium is low and there is e↵ectively a subsidy to risk taking, possibly inducing exces-
44:1610:98162:18:18:72:540:402:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:sive leverage and endogenous crises. This extension needs further analysis, but it clarifies
44:1611:98254:18:45:72:530:384:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:B:that restricting the model to bailing out only equity holders is not critical for our results.
