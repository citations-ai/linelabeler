2:28:1355:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:Competition for positive attention in financial markets frequently resembles a tournament, where superior
2:29:1460:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:relative performance and greater visibility are rewarded with convex payoffs. We present a rational
2:30:1559:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:expectations model in which firms compete for such positive attention and show that higher competition
2:31:1661:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:for this prize makes discretionary disclosure less likely. In the limit when the market is perfectly competitive,
2:32:1774:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:transparency is minimized. We show that this effect persists when considering general prize structures,
2:33:1877:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:prizes that change in size as a result of competition, endogenous prizes, prizes granted on the basis
2:34:1978:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:of percentile, product market competition, and alternative game theoretic formulations. The analysis
2:35:2078:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:implies that competition is unreliable as a driver of market transparency and should not be viewed
2:36:2176:14:42:72:365:476:12:Times:12:Times:as a panacea that assures self-regulation in financial markets.

3:52:2543:0:30:71:184:690:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:1  Introduction
3:53:2558:30:19:71:539:660:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Competition for positive attention in financial markets frequently resembles a tournament, where
3:54:2654:19:18:71:539:641:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:superior relative performance is rewarded with convex payoffs.1In many settings, rankings drive
3:55:2749:18:19:71:539:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:renumeration (i.e., order statistics matter). For example, mutual funds that advertise better past
3:56:2847:19:19:71:540:604:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:performance or achieve greater visibility experience convex investor flows (e.g., Brown, Harlow,
3:57:2943:19:19:71:540:585:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and Starks, 1996; Berk and Green, 2004; Del Guercio and Tkac,2008).2Firms with higher status
3:58:3035:19:18:71:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:attract superior human capital, especially when labor is scarce (e.g., Gatewood, Gowan, and Laut-
3:59:3132:18:19:71:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:enschlager, 1993).3CEO’s who receive higher public praise are rewarded with positively skewed
3:60:3225:19:19:71:540:529:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:payoffs (e.g., Gibbs, 1994; Malmendier and Tate, 2009). Suchconvexity is also likely to exist when
3:61:3323:19:18:71:539:510:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:other scarce resources are allocated: supplies and supplier credit, venture capital (e.g., Hsu, 2004),
3:62:3425:18:19:71:539:492:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and investor attention (e.g., Hendricks and Singhal, 1996). In short, there is a prize in the market
3:63:3525:19:19:71:389:473:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for the parties that reveal more favorable information thanothers.
3:64:3591:19:19:88:539:454:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:How then does competition for this prize affect each participants’s incentives to reveal private
3:65:3687:19:18:71:540:435:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:information to the public? The answer to this question turnsout to be non-obvious. Though it
3:66:3779:18:19:71:539:417:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:might seem intuitive that higher competition for such a prize should increase incentives to reveal
3:67:3877:19:19:71:540:398:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:private information, we find that this is often not the case. Thus, we cannot appeal to the Invisible
3:68:3978:19:19:71:539:379:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Hand to make markets more transparent: while competition may drive prices down in product
3:69:4067:19:18:71:539:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:markets, it may have the opposite effect on transparency. Based on this, our analysis provides an
3:70:4164:18:19:71:540:342:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:important implication for the regulation of financial markets: competition shouldnotbe viewed as
3:71:4260:19:19:71:517:323:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:a panacea to assure information disclosure and self-regulation by participants in the market.4
3:72:4354:19:18:88:539:304:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Summarizing our base model makes it easy to appreciate the intuition for this result. We build
3:73:4448:18:19:71:539:286:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on the model of Dye (1985), where incomplete disclosure results from investors’ uncertainty as to
3:74:4545:19:19:71:540:267:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:whether or not management possesses relevant information.In our variant, a finite number of firms
3:75:4642:19:19:71:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:compete in the market. All firms experience a random shock that changes their fundamental value.
3:76:4738:19:16:71:539:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Each firm may or may not observe the precise value of their shock. Firms that make an observation
3:77:4835:16:14:84:540:213:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:1As first pointed out by Rosen (1981), convex payoffs mean that small differences in performance at the high end
3:78:4947:14:8:71:409:199:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:of the spectrum become magnified in larger earnings differences or returns to effort.
3:79:5032:8:14:84:540:191:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:2Capon, Fitzsimons, and Prince (1996) and Sirri and Tufano (1998) show that past performance is the crucial
3:80:5139:14:11:71:539:177:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:input in investors’ choice of mutual fund. Brown, Harlow, and Starks (1996) are credited as being the first to point
3:81:5255:11:11:71:540:166:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:out the tournament-nature of mutual fund markets and the effects this has on managerial incentives. See Berk and
3:82:5367:11:11:71:539:155:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:Green (2004) for a theoretical model of convex performance incentives in mutual fund markets. See Gallaher, Kaniel,
3:83:5482:11:11:71:539:144:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:and Starks (2005), Gualtieri and Petrella (2005), Del Guercio and Tkac (2008), and Starks and Yates (2008) for the
3:84:5596:11:11:71:539:133:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:affects of visibility and reputation on mutual fund flows. SeeNanda, Wang, and Zheng (2004) and Gaspar, Massa
3:85:5705:11:7:71:521:122:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:and Matos (2006) for the effect that past returns and visibility have on flows to other offerings in fund families.
3:86:5820:7:11:84:377:115:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:3See also Chauvin and Guthrie (1994) and Turban and Greening (1996).
3:87:5888:11:15:84:539:104:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:4This does not mean that competition can never promote disclosure. Even in our simplified model we find some
3:88:5996:15:0:71:115:89:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:exceptions.
4:89:6008:0:19:71:540:690:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:then choose whether to announce it publicly, while firms withno new information have nothing to
4:90:6103:19:19:71:540:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reveal. The firm with the best announcement gets a fixed prize from the market, which represents
4:91:6199:19:19:71:348:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the rank-based convex renumeration previously described.
4:92:6255:19:18:88:539:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In the symmetric equilibrium of the game, each firm with new information applies a threshold
4:93:6347:18:19:71:540:615:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in deciding whether or not to reveal its news. If the observedshock value is above this threshold,
4:94:6445:19:19:71:539:596:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the firm announces it and competes for the prize. If the observed shock is lower, however, the firm
4:95:6544:19:18:71:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:conceals its information. The presence of uninformed firms lends plausible deniability to informed
4:96:6642:18:19:71:539:559:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:firms wishing to conceal a bad observation. Rational investors use Bayesian learning to adjust the
4:97:6740:19:19:71:315:540:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:market price of firms that do not release any news.
4:98:6791:19:19:88:539:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Because the probability of winning the prize drops when morefirms compete, the benefit of
4:99:6880:19:18:71:540:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:making announcements decreases with competition.  Therefore, increasing competition leads to
4:100:6972:18:19:71:540:484:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:decreased information revelation and lower market transparency.  Our base model with a fixed
4:101:7064:19:19:71:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:prize shows this effect most simply and directly, but we show that this effect remains reasonably
4:102:7161:19:19:71:540:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:robust to other model variations: general reward systems, prizes that change in size as a result of
4:103:7260:19:18:71:297:427:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:competition, and product market competition.5
4:104:7305:18:19:88:540:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We consider more general reward systems in which multiple prizes are awarded, so that runners-
4:105:7399:19:19:71:539:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:up also receive compensation.  Adding more prizes definitively increases the incentive to reveal
4:106:7495:19:18:71:540:371:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:information,ceteris paribus. However, holding any prize structure fixed, the equilibrium incentive
4:107:7593:18:19:71:540:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to reveal private information still decreases with competition because the probability of winning or
4:108:7693:19:19:71:406:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:being one of the runners-up drops when more firms are in the market.
4:109:7761:19:19:88:539:315:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We then consider what happens when the size of the prize changes because of competition. When
4:110:7854:19:18:71:540:296:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the size of the prize shrinks, our primary result is magnified. The incentive to reveal information
4:111:7953:18:19:71:540:278:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:drops because of two forces: competition for the prize is higher and the reward is lower. Such an
4:112:8050:19:19:71:540:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:effect is plausible under a number of economic scenarios. Forexample, as competition for human
4:113:8144:19:19:71:539:240:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:resources increases, labor’s bargaining power grows and lowers the value (via higher wages) that the
4:114:8244:19:18:71:539:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:top firm gets when winning the competition. Interestingly, though, our results remain surprisingly
4:115:8342:18:19:71:540:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:robust even when the prize grows with firm entry. For example,if the prize scales linearly with the
4:116:8441:19:19:71:540:184:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:number of participating firms, competition still has a negative influence on information revelation
4:117:8540:19:19:71:539:165:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:when the number of competing firms exceeds a modest threshold. In fact, competition reduces
4:118:8631:19:15:71:447:146:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:disclosure unless the prize grows at least exponentially inthe number of firms.
4:119:8710:15:15:84:539:131:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:5In Appendix B, we build on this and show that this consideration is robust when considering endogenous prizes,
4:120:8821:15:11:71:540:116:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:prizes awarded based on percentile, and a sequential disclosure game structure (instead of the simultaneous game
4:121:8933:11:11:71:539:105:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:modeled in the paper). There, we also consider the effect of volatility on the tendency for firms to disclose private
4:122:9050:11:0:71:120:94:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:information.
5:123:9063:0:19:88:540:690:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We then consider the effect of product market competition on the analysis. In our base model,
5:124:9156:19:19:71:540:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:all firms draw their shocks from a common distribution which does not change with the number of
5:125:9251:19:19:71:540:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:competing firms. That is, the entry of a new competitor reduces a firm’s chance to win the prize,
5:126:9348:19:18:71:540:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:but does not reduce its earnings. To include this effect, we alter our model by scaling the value of
5:127:9448:18:19:71:540:615:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:firms and shocks to firm value downward with competition. Thisagnostic framework allows us to
5:128:9541:19:19:71:540:596:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:analyze how competition affects information revelation without limiting ourselves to any particular
5:129:9640:19:18:71:539:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:model of pricing and supply. We find this modification mitigates the tendency for competition
5:130:9733:18:19:71:539:559:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to reduce information revelation when a very small number offirms compete. However, once the
5:131:9825:19:19:71:539:540:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:number of firms reaches a critical mass, further competitionreduces information transmission as in
5:132:9923:19:19:71:540:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the base model. We provide analytic proof and numerical examples to show that this critical mass
5:133:10019:19:18:71:540:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of firms is very small, and conjecture that most industries are large enough that further competition
5:134:10120:18:19:71:540:484:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:generally reduces firms’ incentives to reveal private information. Though according to the model, in
5:135:10220:19:19:71:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the limit when the market becomes perfectly competitive, profits converge to zero but transparency
5:136:10318:19:19:71:134:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is minimized.
5:137:10331:19:18:88:539:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The analysis yields novel and testable empirical predictions. Our model predicts that perfor-
5:138:10424:18:19:71:540:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:mance announcements, advertising, and discretionary disclosure should decline with competition,
5:139:10519:19:19:71:539:390:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f2:ceteris paribus. This implies, for example, that in the mutual fund industrywhere firms compete
5:140:10614:19:18:71:539:371:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for Morningstar ratings (Del Guercio and Tkac, 2008), advertising expenditure and discretionary
5:141:10709:18:19:71:539:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:disclosure should be negatively correlated with HerfindahlIndex. Such a prediction might be tested
5:142:10807:19:19:71:540:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:cross-sectionally or with a time series, while controllingfor other fund characteristics. Our model
5:143:10906:19:19:71:539:315:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:also predicts that when asymmetric information increases,discretionary disclosure should increase
5:144:11003:19:18:71:539:296:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in industries with low status-based prizes. However, in industries with high status rewards, dis-
5:145:11100:18:19:71:540:278:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:cretionary disclosure should decline when information asymmetry increases. This prediction might
5:146:11196:19:19:71:539:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:also be tested in the mutual fund industry with a time-seriesthat includes periods of high volatility.
5:147:11298:19:19:88:539:240:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This paper contributes to a large literature on informationrevelation and discretionary disclo-
5:148:11393:19:18:71:539:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sure in financial markets. The paper that is closest to ours isFishman and Hagerty (1989), which
5:149:11489:18:19:71:539:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:shows that firms compete for attention in financial markets because informed trading leads to price
5:150:11588:19:19:71:540:184:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:efficiency, which is valuable for firms making investment decisions. The prize in their paper is price
5:151:11690:19:19:71:539:165:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:efficiency. In fact, Fishman and Hagerty show that firms spend more on disclosure than is socially
5:152:11788:19:18:71:540:146:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:optimal when competing for the prize. Our paper adds to theirs in the following way: when more
5:153:11882:18:19:71:539:128:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and more firms compete for this type of attention, each firm’s ability to achieve price efficiency
5:154:11980:19:19:71:540:109:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:declines because traders have a fixed bandwidth when following firms. Decreasing marginal benefit
5:155:12077:19:0:71:540:90:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to disclosure relative to its cost, makes disclosure less attractive. Therefore, applying our model to
6:156:12180:0:19:71:540:690:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the formulation in Fishman and Hagerty (1989), we would predict that their effect would diminish
6:157:12276:19:19:71:183:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with more competition.
6:158:12298:19:19:88:540:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Early work on disclosure theory suggest that market forces are sufficient to induce full disclosure.
6:159:12398:19:18:71:539:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Grossman and Hart (1980), Grossman (1981), and Milgrom (1981) suggest that in the absence of
6:160:12490:18:19:71:539:615:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:disclosure costs or asymmetric information, firms adhere tothe Full Disclosure Principle. That is,
6:161:12588:19:19:71:539:596:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:when firms have private information about their prospects, adverse selection prompts high-valued
6:162:12684:19:18:71:539:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:firms to distinguish themselves from others by disclosing their information. In so doing, they reduce
6:163:12785:18:19:71:540:559:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the expected prospects of the remaining non-disclosing firms. The effect cascades, finally resulting
6:164:12885:19:19:71:539:540:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in full disclosure by all firms.  Diamond (1985) shows that such disclosure is welfare-improving
6:165:12981:19:19:71:409:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:because of explicit information cost savings and improved risk sharing.
6:166:13052:19:18:88:540:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Subsequent work challenges these results: full disclosuremay not occur because disclosure is
6:167:13144:18:19:71:539:484:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:costly (e.g. Verrecchia 1983; Fishman and Hagerty 1990), some market participants are unsophis-
6:168:13239:19:19:71:539:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ticated (e.g., Fishman and Hagerty 2003), or the market is unsure whether firms have asymmetric
6:169:13334:19:19:71:540:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:information (Dye, 1985 and Jung and Kwon, 1988). We build ourmodel on Dye (1985) and Jung
6:170:13423:19:18:71:539:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and Kwon (1988), but we could just as well have used Verreccia(1983) for our foundation. In either
6:171:13521:18:19:71:539:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:case the prospect of a prize increases the incentive to disclose, and growing competition reduces
6:172:13618:19:19:71:539:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that incentive. While we use Dye’s model as a matter of choice, our result generalizes to alternative
6:173:13719:19:18:71:235:371:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:models of discretionary disclosure.
6:174:13754:18:19:88:539:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our work also adds to the literature on product market competition and discretionary disclo-
6:175:13846:19:19:71:539:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sure. Again, this literature is split on whether product market competition increases or decreases
6:176:13944:19:19:71:539:315:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:disclosure. Stivers (2004) argues that product market competition increases disclosure, as firms
6:177:14040:19:18:71:540:296:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:might even make negative disclosures if doing so will hurt competitors more. In contrast, Wagen-
6:178:14136:18:19:71:539:278:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:hofer (1989), Darrough (1993), Clinch and Verrecchia (1997), and Board (2009) argue that firms
6:179:14230:19:19:71:539:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:may avoid disclosure to conceal private information from competitors. Similarly, Darrough and
6:180:14323:19:19:71:540:240:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Stoughton (1990), Feltham and Xie (1992), and Pae (2002) argue that firms may conceal such
6:181:14413:19:18:71:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:private information to prevent new entry into the market. Finally, Dye and Sridhar (1995) find
6:182:14507:18:19:71:540:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that product market competition may increase or decrease disclosure depending on whether the
6:183:14599:19:19:71:539:184:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:information the firms receive is private or industry-related. In many of these papers, disclosure
6:184:14696:19:19:71:540:165:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:itself affects the nature of competition, which in turn affects the tendency to disclose. While we do
6:185:14797:19:18:71:539:146:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:not address these considerations specifically, we do add to this literature by considering product
6:186:14895:18:19:71:539:128:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:market competition simultaneously with competition for attention, finding again that increased
6:187:14989:19:19:71:456:109:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:competition often reduces management’s tendency to revealprivate information.
6:188:15066:19:0:88:539:90:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces our base model, the action
7:189:15161:0:19:71:540:690:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:set presented to firms, and the corresponding payoffs.  Section 3 characterizes the equilibrium
7:190:15256:19:19:71:540:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and explores key comparative statics. We show the results are robust to more generalized prize
7:191:15350:19:19:71:540:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:structures, and to changing sizes of the prize with competition.  In Section 4, we add product
7:192:15444:19:18:71:539:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:market competition to the model. We show that competing for the same resources, customers, etc.
7:193:15539:18:19:71:539:615:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:can initially lead to an increase in information revelation, but once the number of firms reaches an
7:194:15639:19:19:71:539:596:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:economically reasonable level, additional competition leads to less disclosure. Section 5 offers some
7:195:15740:19:18:71:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:concluding remarks. Proofs of all propositions are deferred to Appendix A, as are some technical
7:196:15836:18:19:71:540:559:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:definitions and lemmas. In Appendix B, we show that our results remain robust when considering
7:197:15930:19:35:71:526:540:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a sequential game set-up, volatility, endogenous prizes, and prizes awarded based on percentile.

7:199:16039:29:19:71:539:476:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f8:We consider a single period model in which a group ofNrisk-neutral firms, indexed byj∈

7:201:16220:19:18:71:539:438:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:change in fundamental valuation,  ̃xj∼F. We assume  ̃xjhas a probability density functionf(x)>0
7:202:16315:18:19:71:539:420:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for allx∈R, and thatE[ ̃xj] = 0. Realizations are independent and identically distributed for each
7:203:16413:19:19:71:539:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:firm, and their distribution does not depend on the number of firms competing in the market,
7:204:16505:19:18:71:310:382:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:though we will relax this assumption in Section 4.
7:205:16555:18:19:88:540:364:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In each firm, a manager observes the true realization of  ̃xjwith probabilityp. With probability
7:206:16651:19:19:71:539:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(1−p), the manager observes nothing.  The parameterpmeasures the degree of asymmetric
7:207:16736:19:19:71:539:326:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:information in the market. Whenpis high, it is likely that firms have more information about
7:208:16828:19:18:71:539:307:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:their value than outsiders. Whenpis low, it is unlikely that firms have learned anything new. As

7:216:17394:15:11:71:539:130:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:disclosure alone.  Disclosure is meant to refer to any instance in which information might be revealed.  Likewise,

8:234:18645:19:19:71:540:348:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:informed firms to make disclosures over a short time horizon.8We defineσ≡{σ1, . . . , σN}as the

8:236:18840:18:19:71:540:311:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:categories: uninformed firms, informed firms that reveal information, and informed firms that pool

8:242:19338:19:19:71:145:198:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:its information,

8:244:19375:18:15:84:540:161:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:7As such, we follow the previous literature on discretionarydisclosure and do not consider the firms’ tendency to
8:245:19488:15:10:71:539:146:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:make false statements here. To address this, an alternativeset-up might include a cheap talk game (e.g., Crawford
8:246:19601:10:8:71:287:136:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:and Sobel, 1982), but we do not analyze this directly.
8:247:19655:8:14:84:539:128:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:8However, in Appendix B we explore a sequential game of disclosure and show that the frequency of disclosure of
8:248:19766:14:0:71:252:114:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:private information is minimized asN→∞.
9:249:19806:0:19:88:539:690:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:After all disclosures have been made, investors award a prizeφto the firm with the highest
9:250:19896:19:19:71:539:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:disclosed value.  This prize value represents the convex gain in value that accrue to the high-
9:251:19991:19:19:71:539:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:performing firm. We take this prize to be given exogenously, but consider what happens when this
9:252:20087:19:18:71:540:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:prize is endogenously determined in Appendix B. There we show that our primary result still holds.
9:253:20185:18:29:88:432:615:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Including this exogenous prize, firmj’s expected utility of revealingxis

9:255:20273:29:18:71:540:557:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:where we defineWj(x) as the probability that firmjhas the highest disclosure. This value depends
9:256:20369:18:19:71:526:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on the probabilitypof competing firms being informed, and on the strategiesσ−jthey employ.
9:257:20459:19:19:88:540:520:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Therefore, this model extends the Jung and Kwon (1988) refinement of the Dye (1985) model, in
9:258:20552:19:19:71:539:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:which uncertainty about a single firm’s information inducesan incomplete disclosure equilibrium.
9:259:20648:19:18:71:540:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Dye’s model corresponds to ours in the specific case where we have only one firm and no prize

9:263:20870:27:19:71:540:373:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f12:Lemma 1.In any subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium, each firm acts according to adisclosure

9:269:21002:19:19:71:539:303:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The threshold is implicitly defined by the condition that a firm observingxj=tjbe indifferent
9:270:21095:19:19:71:233:284:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:between disclosing and concealing,
9:271:21129:19:27:275:336:265:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:uDj(tj) =uCj.
9:272:21142:27:18:88:540:238:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:According to Lemma 1, each informed firm simply compares the expected utility it can obtain
9:273:21233:18:19:71:539:220:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by revealing information to what it obtains by pooling. If itconceals its signal, then the actual
9:274:21330:19:19:71:540:201:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:realization certainly cannot affect the valuation investors assign, souCjis constant with respect to
9:275:21430:19:18:71:540:182:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the observed valuexj. In contrast, the value obtained by revealing information is increasing in
9:276:21525:18:19:71:540:164:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:xj. If the two utilities are equal when the firm observes its threshold value  ̃xj=tj, then the firm
9:277:21625:19:19:71:458:145:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:should reveal any observation greater thantjand conceal any lesser observation.
9:278:21704:19:19:88:539:126:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Note that the thresholdtjis lower than the distribution mean, which we’ve assumed to be zero.
9:279:21797:19:18:71:539:107:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The average  ̃xjfor an uninformed firm is simply the distribution mean, and because firms disclose
9:280:21895:18:0:71:539:89:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:their best observations, rational investors expect the average concealed observation to be negative.
10:281:21996:0:19:71:540:690:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The weighted average assigned to herding firms must therefore be below the distribution mean.
10:282:22089:19:19:71:539:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Since disclosure yields strictly greater utility than the value disclosed, no firm will ever conceal
10:283:22189:19:19:71:539:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:an above-average observation. So if firmjis indifferent between revealing and concealing a value
10:284:22285:19:25:71:167:633:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:xj=tj, thentj<0.
10:285:22301:25:25:71:417:608:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f4:Lemma 2.Every firm uses the same disclosure threshold, defined ast∗.
10:286:22369:25:19:88:539:583:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In other words, there cannot be an equilibrium in which some firms are more “honest” than oth-
10:287:22463:19:19:71:539:564:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ers. This is not too surprising, since all firms draw the observations from identical and independent
10:288:22564:19:18:71:540:545:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:distributions. One can imagine an alternate model in which there was some endogenous benefit
10:289:22656:18:19:71:539:527:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of being perceived as trustworthy, and such a model might induce a heterogeneous equilibrium.
10:290:22749:19:19:71:539:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In our equilibrium, Lemma 2 ensures that any two firms will behave identically with any given
10:291:22842:19:19:71:128:489:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:observation.
10:292:22854:19:18:88:539:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This result justifies our description of the non-disclosingfirms as a “pool.”  Since they all
10:293:22947:18:19:71:540:452:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:have identical disclosure thresholds and distributionsF, investors value all non-disclosing firms
10:294:23044:19:19:71:539:433:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:identically.  In a hypothetical equilibrium where some firmsare more honest, investors would
10:295:23136:19:19:71:539:414:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:assign a higher valuation to an honest non-disclosing firm than to a firm that has a reputation for
10:296:23235:19:18:71:540:395:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:concealing poor valuations. But when no firm distinguishes itself by its honesty, investors assign
10:297:23333:18:26:71:354:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the same valueuCto every non-disclosing firm in the pool.
10:298:23390:26:25:71:351:351:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f4:Lemma 3.The common disclosure thresholdt∗is unique.
10:299:23441:25:19:88:539:326:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Not only does each individual firm have a unique optimal response to the other firms’ strategies,
10:300:23538:19:19:71:539:307:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:but there is only one viable choice for the entire group. So for given model parameter values, we can
10:301:23639:19:18:71:540:288:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:theoretically determine the unique disclosure threshold.This allows us to predict how disclosure
10:302:23735:18:19:71:540:270:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:behavior responds to exogenous parameter changes. Most importantly, we will demonstrate how
10:303:23826:19:19:71:458:251:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:equilibrium disclosure responds to an increase in the number of competing firms.
10:304:23906:19:25:88:376:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Taken together, Lemmas 1, 2, and 3 establish Proposition 1.

10:317:24181:27:26:71:437:133:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Further, the thresholdt∗lies below the unconditional mean of ̃xj, i.e.t∗<0.
10:318:24256:26:18:88:539:107:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The left side of (1) can be understood as the utility a firm thatobserves  ̃xj=t∗expects if
10:319:24347:18:0:71:540:89:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:it reveals its information. The firm immediately receives its own value  ̃xj=t∗, and can also win
11:320:24445:0:19:71:539:690:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the prizeφif its disclosure is the highest. But since competing firms never reveal values below
11:321:24540:19:19:71:539:671:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:t∗, any other disclosing firm will have a higher value almost surely. Firmjcan win, therefore,
11:322:24634:19:19:71:540:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:only if all other firms pool. Each competing firm pools if either it is uninformed or it is informed
11:323:24734:19:18:71:539:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with an observation below the threshold. These events occurwith probabilities (1−p) andpF(t∗),
11:324:24828:18:19:71:407:615:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:respectively. The left side therefore is theuDj(t∗) term from Lemma 1.
11:325:24898:19:19:88:540:596:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The right side is utility a firm obtains by concealing its observation, which equals the expected
11:326:24995:19:18:71:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:value change of a pooling firm. Such a firm could be uninformed and have a zero expected value for
11:327:25093:18:19:71:540:559:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:its observation, or could be hiding an observation lower than the threshold. The weighted average
11:328:25190:19:29:71:336:540:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of these possibilities yields the right side of Equation 1.

11:331:25369:19:19:71:539:466:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by using the Implicit Function Theorem to determine comparative statics ont∗. But the economic

11:333:25560:18:19:71:539:429:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:be made from it. A more useful characterization is the frequency with which firms opt to reveal
11:334:25655:19:19:71:540:410:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:private information. That is, what is the ex ante probability that a firm, if it observes its value
11:335:25754:19:28:71:352:391:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:change, will choose to share its observation with investors?
11:336:25814:28:29:71:519:363:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f4:Definition 4.We define the equilibrium ex ante probability of an informed firm disclosing by

11:338:25917:30:19:71:540:304:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We refer to this probability as the equilibriumdisclosure  frequency.  Since the equilibrium is
11:339:26012:19:27:71:280:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:symmetric, we omit firm-specific subscripts.
11:340:26056:27:19:88:539:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:When firms follow threshold disclosure strategies, as described in Lemma 1, there is a one-to-one

12:358:26743:18:19:71:540:611:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1) and no prizeφ. Their equilibrium condition is equivalent to Equation 2. The chance to win
12:359:26835:19:29:71:430:592:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:φ >0 offers firms a greater incentive to disclose, so in equilibrium, we have
12:360:26912:29:29:237:374:563:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:ω∗≥ˆω∀φ≥0,∀N <∞.
12:361:26928:29:18:71:540:534:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:That is, ˆωis a lower bound forω∗over allφandN. In fact, it is the largest possible lower bound.
12:362:27024:18:19:71:540:516:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Note thatˆtis similarly an upper bound fort∗, which by Proposition 1 must lie belowE[ ̃x] = 0. We
12:363:27121:19:19:71:160:497:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:therefore also have
12:364:27140:19:25:230:381:478:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:t∗≤ˆt <0∀φ≥0,∀N <∞.
12:365:27159:25:18:71:539:453:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Becauseω∗andt∗are informationally equivalent, we may conduct our investigation using either
12:366:27250:18:19:71:539:435:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:variable. We therefore rewrite Proposition 1 in terms of disclosure frequency, instead of a disclosure
12:367:27352:19:27:71:118:416:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:threshold.
12:368:27362:27:19:71:540:389:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f4:Proposition 2.There exists a unique and non-trivial subgame-perfect Nashequilibrium, in which

12:378:27625:27:19:88:539:280:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Like Proposition 1, this proposition defines the equilibrium frequencyω∗by an indifference
12:379:27715:19:27:71:517:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:between disclosure and non-disclosure for a firm that observes the threshold value,  ̃x=t(ω∗).
12:380:27809:27:27:71:323:234:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f4:Proposition 3.Equilibrium disclosure frequency is:
12:381:27859:27:27:81:329:207:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(i) decreasing in the number of competing firms,N.
12:382:27909:27:27:78:250:180:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(ii) increasing in the prize value,φ.
12:383:27946:27:27:71:261:153:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Further, asN→∞,ω∗converges toˆω.
12:384:27978:27:19:88:539:126:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Proposition 3(i) is the simplest possible statement of our main result.  Whenfirms disclose
12:385:28069:19:18:71:539:107:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:competitively to win positive attention, increased competition reduces disclosure. This defies the
12:386:28167:18:0:71:539:89:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:general economic intuition that tightening competition drives firms to give up their small advantages
13:387:28270:0:19:71:540:690:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the interest of providing a competitive product. Rather,increasing competition drives firms to
13:388:28367:19:19:71:540:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:hoard their informational advantage over investors. The result has immediate application in the
13:389:28462:19:19:71:529:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:financial sector, where disclosure is critical and where top-performing firms enjoy large rewards.
13:390:28560:19:18:88:539:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Mathematically, the cause of the competition effect is straightforward.  As more firms enter
13:391:28652:18:19:71:540:615:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the market, each firm’s chance of making the highest disclosure diminishes. With it, their chances
13:392:28750:19:19:71:539:596:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of receiving positive attention from their disclosure decreases. Since the disclosure decision is a
13:393:28849:19:18:71:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:trade-off between the desire to win the prize and the desire toconceal bad signals, additional firm
13:394:28948:18:19:71:540:559:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:entry tips the balance in favor of concealing. In the sections that follow, we will show this effect to
13:395:29051:19:19:71:324:540:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:be robust to more sophisticated model specifications.
13:396:29104:19:19:88:540:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Proposition 3(ii) states simply that firms will be more inclined to disclose when the prize they
13:397:29200:19:18:71:540:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:can win is large. Again, a larger prize tips the balance between the competing desires to pool and
13:398:29298:18:19:71:539:484:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to compete openly for positive investor attention. This concept is also robust to our alternative
13:399:29395:19:19:71:169:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:model specifications.
13:400:29416:19:19:88:539:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Finally, according to Proposition 3, once the market for attention becomes perfectly competi-
13:401:29509:19:18:71:540:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tive, equilibrium disclosure is minimized. Moreover, the frequency with which firms disclose their
13:402:29607:18:19:71:539:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:information approaches that when there is no prize in the market whatsoever. Therefore, perfect
13:403:29702:19:19:71:540:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:competition induces firms to retain the maximum degree of asymmetric information and market
13:404:29793:19:18:71:199:371:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:transparency is minimized.
13:405:29819:18:19:88:539:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The comparative statics inpturn out to be trickier. Jung and Kwon (1988) consider the special
13:406:29912:19:19:71:539:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:case whereN= 1 andφ= 0, and find disclosure to be strictly increasing inp. We are able to
13:407:30001:19:19:71:539:315:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:confirm this result by computing our comparative statics withφ= 0. But when there is a prize,
13:408:30094:19:18:71:266:296:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the situation becomes more complicated.
13:409:30133:18:19:88:540:278:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Hypothetically, ifpincreases and firms fail to adjust their disclosure strategies, there would be
13:410:30230:19:19:71:540:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:two sources of change in firm utility. First, the increase in asymmetric information would increase
13:411:30329:19:19:71:540:240:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the Bayesian probability of a firm having inside information. Rational investors would respond by
13:412:30426:19:18:71:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reducing their assessmentuCof pooling firms. Second, the increase inpmeans competing firms
13:413:30516:18:19:71:540:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are more likely to be informed. Since being informed is a prerequisite to disclosing, the increase in
13:414:30617:19:19:71:539:184:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:pmakes any given disclosing firm less likely to win the prize bydefault. Mathematically, a higher
13:415:30714:19:19:71:410:165:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:pdecreasesWj(x), which implies a lower expected utility of disclosure.
13:416:30784:19:18:88:540:146:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:These two effects of increasedpwork against each other. To determine whetherω∗will increase
13:417:30875:18:19:71:539:128:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:or decrease, we need to know which of these effect impact firm utility more. If the reduction in
13:418:30971:19:19:71:539:109:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:uC(ω∗) is larger than the reduction inuD(ω∗), then disclosure becomes more appealing. Firms
13:419:31062:19:0:71:540:90:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:will then respond to an increase inpby disclosing more frequently. Conversely, if the reduction in
14:420:31162:0:19:71:395:690:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:uD(ω∗) dominates, then firms respond with less frequent disclosure.
14:421:31229:19:19:88:540:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:If the prize valueφis small or zero, then the reduction inWj(x) is unimportant, so the reduction
14:422:31325:19:19:71:539:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:inuC(ω∗) dominates, and equilibrium disclosure increases. This echoes the Jung and Kwon (1988)
14:423:31419:19:18:71:539:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:result. The same result follows whenNis very large, in which case the probability of winning the
14:424:31515:18:19:71:539:615:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:prize is low from the outset. In contrast, whenφis large andNis modest, the reduction inWj(x)
14:425:31608:19:19:71:539:596:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is critical. The second effect dominates, so overall the incentive to disclose is reduced more than
14:426:31707:19:18:71:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the incentive to pool. Consequently, firms pool more often, reducing the equilibrium disclosure
14:427:31802:18:29:71:119:559:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:frequency.
14:428:31812:29:26:71:267:530:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:3.2  Generalized Prize Structure
14:429:31844:26:19:71:540:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We now show that competition’s effect of reducing disclosureis robust to alternative model spec-
14:430:31940:19:18:71:539:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ifications. Because the probability of winningφdeclines exponentially with firm entry, the effect
14:431:32037:18:19:71:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tends to trump other simultaneous considerations, especially whenNis large. Neither multiple
14:432:32129:19:19:71:539:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:prizes nor prizes that decrease with competition alter thisresult. Prizes that grow withNcan
14:433:32221:19:19:71:540:429:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:change things, but only for smallNor for prizes that (rather implausibly) grow exponentiallyad
14:434:32315:19:28:71:118:410:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:infinitum.
14:435:32325:28:25:71:194:382:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:3.2.1  Multiple Prizes
14:436:32347:25:19:71:540:357:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Allowing only a single firm to win the prizeφhas simplified our analysis, but it seems reasonable
14:437:32444:19:19:71:539:338:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for the second-highest discloser to receive some positive investor attention as well. Perhaps the top
14:438:32545:19:19:71:290:319:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ten firms all deserve some sort of status prize.
14:439:32593:19:18:88:539:300:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:There are situations where having a single prize makes sense.  In industries with natural
14:440:32682:18:19:71:539:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:monopoly, or where the government awards a single contract,firms like Microsoft and Raytheon
14:441:32774:19:19:71:539:263:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:might be entitled to such such a winner-take-all prize. In such fields the runners-up receive little if
14:442:32877:19:19:71:399:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:any reward from their second-place, and a single-prize model is best.
14:443:32946:19:18:88:539:225:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:But a more egalitarian prize structure is sensible if firms are limited by capacity or distribution
14:444:33045:18:19:71:539:207:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:constraints. A single grocery store cannot service the entire state, regardless of how acclaimed its
14:445:33145:19:19:71:540:188:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:fresh produce may be. In such cases, some prize should be reserved for the firms with slightly less
14:446:33244:19:18:71:540:169:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:impressive disclosures. In what follows, we consider that afinite number of prizesKare awarded
14:447:33338:18:19:71:539:151:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to the top firms. In Appendix B we show that the analysis remains robust to considering prizes
14:448:33432:19:25:71:178:132:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:awarded by percentile.
14:449:33454:25:18:71:539:107:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f4:Definition 6.A disclosure game with aprogressive prize structureis one in which the firms
14:450:33543:18:0:71:540:89:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:that make theKhighest disclosures each win a prize. The firm that makes thekthhighest disclosure
15:451:33641:0:30:71:398:690:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:winsφk. We require the prizes to be positive and strictly monotonic,
15:452:33709:30:30:247:364:660:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:φ1> φ2> . . . > φK>0.
15:453:33730:30:18:88:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Compared to a model with a single prize ofφ=φ1, the addition of prizes for runners-up
15:454:33815:18:19:71:539:612:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:naturally induces greater disclosure. But although the change to a progressive prize structure may
15:455:33913:19:28:71:452:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:increases disclosure for any particularN, our central result remains unchanged:
15:456:33992:28:19:71:540:565:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f4:Proposition 4.Under any particular progressive prize structure, equilibrium disclosure frequency
15:457:34088:19:27:71:430:546:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:strictly decreases as competition increases. That is,ω∗N+1< ω∗Nfor anyN.
15:458:34160:27:19:88:540:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This result justifies our simplification in working with a single prizeφ. Although additional
15:459:34253:19:19:71:539:500:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:prizes may change the quantitative predictions of equilibrium disclosure, the qualitative comparative
15:460:34354:19:18:71:540:481:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:statics remain unchanged. The chance of winning a lesser prize decreases with competition just as
15:461:34451:18:19:71:539:463:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the chance of winning a single prize does. Competition therefore reduces disclosure in this setup
15:462:34548:19:29:71:106:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:as well.
15:463:34556:29:26:71:304:415:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:3.2.2  Increasing/Decreasing Prize Values
15:464:34597:26:18:71:539:389:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A further objection to our model might be that we constrain the prize value to remain constant.
15:465:34692:18:19:71:540:371:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:One reasonable alternative is to allow the prize value to vary withN. Indeed, a reasonable case
15:466:34787:19:19:71:370:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:might be made for either increasing or decreasing prize values.
15:467:34850:19:19:88:539:333:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Prize value might decrease when additional firms enter because investor attention is diluted over
15:468:34947:19:18:71:539:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a larger population of firms. More commonly, though, the prize might shrink because of increasing
15:469:35044:18:19:71:540:296:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:competition for a scarce resource. For example, as competition for bank financing, supplier credit,
15:470:35143:19:19:71:540:277:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:or labor resources increases, the relative bargaining power of these residual claimants grows, thereby
15:471:35245:19:19:71:417:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:lowering the value that the top firm gets when winning the competition.
15:472:35316:19:18:88:539:239:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In response to this argument, we note simply that a prize thatdecreases inNonly augments
15:473:35404:18:19:71:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:our result.  If the addition of further competitors causes anexogenous reduction of prize value
15:474:35499:19:19:71:523:202:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(i.e., lowerφ), then equilibrium disclosure falls even faster then if theprize remained constant.
15:475:35596:19:19:88:539:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The argument that prizes should increase with competition is a more challenging one. Such
15:476:35685:19:18:71:540:164:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a case can be made when disclosures are easy to compare, and when choosing the very best firm
15:477:35778:18:19:71:539:146:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:has high value to potential clients and investors. One mightargue that investment funds fit this
15:478:35874:19:19:71:539:127:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:description. A single fund can accommodate large increasesin the amount of money it manages,
15:479:35966:19:19:71:540:108:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and there is very little reason to be content with the second best fund (net of fees, at least). If
15:480:36065:19:0:71:539:89:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:potential investors believe that the disclosed information is a strong predictor of future performance
16:481:36169:0:19:71:539:690:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(e.g., Berk and Green, 2004), then being the best in a large field of competitors may bring a larger
16:482:36269:19:19:71:268:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:prize than being the best in a small field.
16:483:36312:19:19:88:539:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We concede that a continuously increasing prize value can overcome the effect of competition, at
16:484:36408:19:18:71:539:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:least whenNis small. But the following proposition shows that unless the prize grows exponentially
16:485:36506:18:19:71:539:615:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by a factor of at least 1/(1−pˆω), disclosure will eventually decrease onceNreaches some critical

16:507:36889:26:18:71:498:376:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:so the condition in (4) is satisfied, and disclosure decreases with competition for largeN.
16:508:36980:18:19:88:539:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Intuitively, the chance of winning the prize declines exponentially inN, so unless the prize
16:509:37072:19:19:71:539:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:grows forever at the same exponential rate, the expected winnings will eventually decline inN.
16:510:37166:19:18:71:539:320:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:One must ask, however, where a prize that increases exponentially with firm entry would come
16:511:37258:18:19:71:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:from. The value of high status may well increase exponentially as the number of competing firms
16:512:37353:19:19:71:539:283:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:increases from, sayN= 1 toN′= 10. But it is difficult to believe the same exponential increase
16:513:37447:19:19:71:540:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:could continue fromN= 10 toN′= 50. We conjecture that exponentially increasing status prizes
16:514:37539:19:29:71:491:245:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are uncommon at best, and may never occur in industries with alarge number of firms.
16:515:37623:29:26:71:263:216:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:3.3  Implications for Regulation
16:516:37655:26:18:71:540:190:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In most markets, transparency and truthful disclosure increase welfare for several reasons. Disclo-
16:517:37754:18:19:71:539:172:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sure improves explicit information cost savings and allowsfor better risk sharing (Diamond, 1985).
16:518:37852:19:19:71:540:153:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Disclosure also improves the allocation and use of scarce resources because informed trading leads
16:519:37950:19:19:71:540:134:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to price efficiency (Fishman and Hagerty, 1989). Finally, transparency and disclosure make tradable
16:520:38049:19:18:71:539:115:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:assets more liquid because of decreased adverse selection in the market (Diamond and Verrecchia,
16:521:38145:18:0:71:100:97:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1991).
17:522:38153:0:19:88:539:690:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:From the results presented so far, it is easy to appreciate that competition for attention may
17:523:38247:19:19:71:539:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:make markets less transparent, which can lower welfare through these mechanisms. This is espe-
17:524:38341:19:19:71:540:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:cially true in settings where such competition resembles a tournament. For example, our analysis
17:525:38437:19:18:71:540:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:predicts that in the mutual fund market, as more firms competefor recognition (e.g., Morningstar
17:526:38533:18:19:71:540:615:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ratings), fewer funds will make discretionary disclosure and may even attempt to reduce the clarity
17:527:38632:19:19:71:540:596:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of their fund attributes (e.g., Carlin, 2009). This may makeit harder for retail investors to make
17:528:38730:19:18:71:539:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:optimal initial allocations or rebalance their investments, and may even lead to decreased market
17:529:38827:18:19:71:261:559:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:participation (Carlin and Manso, 2010).
17:530:38866:19:19:88:540:540:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:It is important to note that our results here are not special because we build on the models
17:531:38958:19:19:71:539:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of Dye (1985) and Jung and Kwon (1988). Indeed, other formulations could be used to generate
17:532:39050:19:18:71:539:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:similar findings. For example, consider the fixed cost of disclosing as in Verrecchia (1983). As the
17:533:39150:18:19:71:540:484:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:benefit to competing for the prize drops with competition, sowould the incentive to disclose. That
17:534:39248:19:19:71:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is, in a competitive market firms would be less willing to pay acost to reveal private information.
17:535:39347:19:19:71:539:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:As such, we view our results with sufficient generality as theydo not depend on the particular
17:536:39441:19:18:71:164:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:formulation we use.
17:537:39460:18:19:88:540:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our results, then, should give policy makers pause when relying on competitive forces to induce
17:538:39555:19:19:71:539:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:market transparency. Especially, in settings that resemble a tournament, competition may make
17:539:39648:19:18:71:540:371:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:transparency worse, which may cause a decline in welfare. Clearly, while we do not wish to portray
17:540:39746:18:19:71:540:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:this finding as a tautology—indeed, there exist some settings in which competition does induce
17:541:39840:19:19:71:539:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:firms to reveal private information—it does suggest that market forces alone are often insufficient
17:542:39939:19:19:71:539:315:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to maximize welfare in the market. This emphasizes the idea that regulation likely has a role in
17:543:40035:19:34:71:155:296:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:financial markets.
17:544:40053:34:30:71:431:262:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:4  Disclosure Under Product Market Competition
17:545:40099:30:18:71:540:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our base model is most appropriate for firms that compete for the prize only indirectly.  That
17:546:40193:18:19:71:540:214:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is, it models the competition forφbetween firms in different industries, such as Facebook and
17:547:40286:19:19:71:539:195:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Google. Although such firms don’t compete directly for customers or revenue, they both vie for
17:548:40380:19:18:71:539:176:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the same status-based prize: being seen as the premiere internet destination. The base model is
17:549:40475:18:19:71:539:158:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:less appropriate when comparing, say, Microsoft and Apple,which compete directly in the product
17:550:40570:19:19:71:345:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:market, as well as for attention through their disclosures.
17:551:40629:19:19:88:539:120:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In this section, we present an alternative model that bettercharacterizes the latter case. That
17:552:40724:19:0:71:539:101:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is, we suppose that firms compete for customers as well as for positive attention from investors.
18:553:40823:0:19:71:540:690:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The fundamental aspect of competition relevant here is thatfirm revenue decreases with the entry
18:554:40919:19:19:71:540:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of additional firms. Accordingly, signals that affect firm value have a smaller absolute impact, even
18:555:41020:19:19:71:540:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:if they alter firm value by the same fraction. For example, an internal audit that reveals an increase
18:556:41122:19:29:71:539:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in efficiency has a greater absolute effect if it happens in a firmwith high revenue and market value.
18:557:41224:29:26:71:319:604:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:4.1  Simple Product Market Competition
18:558:41262:26:18:71:539:578:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:To capture this effect simply, we model product market competition by using a distribution of value
18:559:41361:18:19:71:540:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:signals that becomes compressed with the entry of additional firms. WhenNfirms compete in the
18:560:41454:19:19:71:539:541:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:product market as well as for investor attention, we exchange the original distribution of signals
18:561:41552:19:18:71:539:522:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:x∼Ffor a compressed distributionxN∼FN. Specifically, whenever a firm would have drawn a
18:562:41639:18:19:71:517:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:signalxin the original model, they instead draw a scaled-down eventx/Nin the new model.
18:563:41726:19:30:88:290:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Formally, we write the new distribution as
18:564:41768:30:30:265:346:455:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:FN(x)≡F(N x).
18:565:41781:30:18:71:539:425:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:An increase inNhas the effect of “squishing” the distribution of news eventswhile leaving the
18:566:41874:18:19:71:539:407:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:support unchanged. Ifx= $10khad been a 90th-percentile result withN= 5,x= $1kwould be
18:567:41959:19:19:71:539:388:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the new 90th-percentile withN= 50. IncreasingNscales down expectations while preserving the
18:568:42050:19:19:71:539:369:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:concavity and any other peculiarities of the value distribution. We refer to this as “equal shares
18:569:42148:19:18:71:196:350:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:competition” for earnings.
18:570:42174:18:19:88:540:332:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We wish to stress that this is not intended as a realistic model of competition.  A plethora
18:571:42266:19:19:71:539:313:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of microeconomic papers have dealt with such issues before us, so we initially gloss over other
18:572:42361:19:18:71:540:294:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:aspects of pricing, capital, and entry costs. Our goal is simply to show how the value-scaling effect
18:573:42462:18:19:71:540:276:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of competition affects disclosure, using the simplest modelthat captures the relevant effect.  In
18:574:42559:19:19:71:540:257:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Section 4.2, though, we consider more general models of competition, and show that our general
18:575:42653:19:19:71:389:238:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:result holds for most plausible models of competition and revenue.
18:576:42719:19:18:88:540:219:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We have already addressed the comparative statics of the base model in Section 2. There we
18:577:42809:18:19:71:539:201:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:found that asNincreases, the incentive to disclose falls as the probability of winning the prize
18:578:42905:19:19:71:540:182:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:decreases.  This reduces the incentive to disclose.  With product market competition potential
18:579:42999:19:18:71:539:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:revenue declines as well. This reduces the incentive to pool. These two effects oppose one another.
18:580:43098:18:19:71:408:145:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Which effect dominates depends upon the number of competing firms.
18:581:43164:19:19:88:540:126:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:For what values ofN, then, does competition reduce disclosure? If we were to findthe necessary
18:582:43258:19:0:71:540:107:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:number of firms to be in the millions, for example, then our point here would only be academic
19:583:43354:0:19:71:539:690:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and not of practical import. To gain a sense of how many firms is“enough,” consider the following
19:584:43451:19:28:71:128:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:proposition.
19:585:43463:28:27:71:415:643:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f4:Proposition 1.IfN >1/(pˆω), thenω∗N+1< ω∗N. Further, asN→∞,
19:586:43522:27:28:81:324:616:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(i) Average per-firm earningsπNconverge to zero.
19:587:43570:28:28:78:366:588:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(ii) The equilibrium disclosure frequencyω∗Nconverges toˆω.
19:588:43629:28:17:88:539:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:To appreciate Proposition 1, suppose the distribution  ̃x∼Fis symmetric, so the fact that
19:589:43718:17:31:72:172:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ˆt < E[x] implies that
19:590:43740:31:30:222:540:512:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ˆω= 1−F(ˆt)>1−F(E[x]) = 0.5.(5)
19:591:43771:30:19:71:539:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Then the necessary condition becomesN  >2/p. If, for example, firm information arrives with
19:592:43862:19:18:71:539:463:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:probability 20%, thenN= 2/(20%) = 10 firms is enough competition that further entry willonly
19:593:43954:18:19:71:540:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reduce disclosure. The higherpis, the fewer firms that are required to assure that further com-
19:594:44049:19:19:71:539:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:petition decreases disclosure. We conjecture that in many industries (e.g., financial sectors), there
19:595:44150:19:19:71:539:407:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are already enough competitors present so that disclosure responds negatively to additional com-
19:596:44246:19:18:71:111:388:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:petition.
19:597:44255:18:19:88:540:370:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Proposition 1 also shows thatω∗Nactually converges to ˆωunder perfect competition, while
19:598:44343:19:19:71:540:351:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:industry profits converge to zero. In most Microeconomic models, as in ours, producer surplus falls
19:599:44442:19:18:71:539:332:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to zero under perfect competition. Product prices generally converge to their lowest possible values,
19:600:44543:18:19:71:539:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:which maximizes social welfare. However, perfect competition in disclosure induces firm to retain
19:601:44640:19:19:71:539:295:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:their maximum degree of asymmetric information. Thus, while perfect competition drives product
19:602:44734:19:19:71:539:276:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:prices to their most socially efficient, it drives firm prices to their least informationally efficient. To
19:603:44841:19:27:71:342:257:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:better appreciate this, we provide the following example.
19:604:44898:27:19:71:539:230:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f4:Example 1.Consider the disclosure game where ̃xis Gaussian withμ= 0,σ= 5andφ= 1,
19:605:44978:19:19:71:540:211:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f4:p=.3and product market competition characterized byFN(x) =F(N x). Figure 1 shows how the
19:606:45066:19:19:71:539:192:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:equilibrium disclosure changes with the number of competing firms. Disclosure initially increases,
19:607:45164:19:27:71:344:173:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:then decreases asymptotically to the lower limitˆω≈.556.
19:608:45220:27:19:88:540:146:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Although the above condition ofN  >1/(pˆω) is mild enough, the condition is indeed only
19:609:45307:19:19:71:539:127:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sufficient for competition to decrease disclosure, not necessary. Typically, an even smaller number
19:610:45406:19:19:71:540:108:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of firms will suffice. We therefore derive the constraint onNthat is both necessary and sufficient
19:611:45504:19:0:71:250:89:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for further entry to reduce disclosure.

20:621:45845:14:33:71:437:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:initially increases, then decreases asymptotically to thelower limit ˆω≈.556.
20:622:45922:33:19:88:539:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f7:Consider the position of a firmjthat draws the threshold value,xj=F−1(1−ω∗). WithN

20:625:46194:19:30:71:482:415:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:disclose, the entry reduces its expected prize winnings by afactor of (1−pω) because
20:626:46278:30:29:241:540:385:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:φW(ω;N) =φ(1−pω)N−1(6)
20:627:46300:29:19:71:539:356:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is exponentially decreasing inN. But the other terms,F−1N(1−ω) anduCN(ω), decline by a factor
20:628:46393:19:19:71:539:337:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ofN/(N+ 1), as demonstrated in Lemma A2 in the appendix. AsNrises, then, this linear effect
20:629:46484:19:19:71:539:318:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:diminishes in significance compared to the exponential effect on the expected prize value. Intuitively
20:630:46586:19:18:71:539:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:it seems that there is a critical number of firms at which additional competition makes herding
20:631:46681:18:28:71:288:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:more attractive than competing for the prize.

20:638:46887:32:30:71:537:173:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Because the ex-ante probability of a firm disclosing isP(Dj|N) =pω∗N, we may equivalently write

20:644:47106:19:0:71:539:94:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:pooling, then the exponential effect overwhelms the linear effect. So, the net effect of firm entry
21:645:47207:0:19:71:540:690:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is a reduction in the incentive to disclose, which results inω∗N+1< ω∗N. Note, however, that the
21:646:47303:19:19:71:539:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:threshold forNestablished by Proposition 6 is changing withN. That is, asNincreases,ω∗Nvaries,
21:647:47397:19:19:71:540:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and so the probability ratio in Equation 8 may also increase.Therefore, although this proposition
21:648:47494:19:18:71:539:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:details the necessary and sufficient condition forN, it does not provide a tighter unconditional

21:651:47658:26:19:71:540:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Now let us consider more general models of competition. Thatis, consider a model in which firm
21:652:47752:19:19:71:539:541:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:entry reduces the value of competing firms in a more sophisticated way than the simple1Nrule
21:653:47844:19:18:71:539:522:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:used in the previous section. Instead ofFN(x)≡F(N x), we define the distribution as a function

21:662:48045:19:19:71:540:441:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:dramatic effect on the revenue of competing firms. IfαNdecreases more slowly, then the effect is
21:663:48141:19:27:71:149:422:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:less pronounced.

21:671:48291:28:18:88:539:306:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The proof follows nearly the same structure as the proof of Proposition 6. Note, however, that
21:672:48385:18:19:71:540:288:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in this case, we need an additional restriction on the sequence{αN}in order to complete the proof.
21:673:48483:19:19:71:540:269:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Roughly stated, the requirement above is that competition not reduce firm value too “quickly” as
21:674:48579:19:19:71:177:250:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:additional firms enter.
21:675:48602:19:18:88:539:231:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Thus, the question becomes one of whether the per-firm revenue can decrease ad-infinitum at
21:676:48693:18:19:71:539:213:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:such a rate with the entry of additional firms. Although one can posit such a model, exponentially

22:698:49253:30:18:71:539:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The primary result in this paper is that increased competition for attention in financial markets
22:699:49350:18:19:71:539:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reduces disclosure in well-populated industries. We show this both in a parsimonious model, as
22:700:49444:19:19:71:539:529:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:well as in more sophisticated extensions. The fundamental idea, that firm entry makes attaining
22:701:49539:19:19:71:539:510:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:top status more difficult, is straightforward. But the exponential relationship between the number
22:702:49637:19:18:71:539:491:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of competing firms and the probability of winning the prize ismathematically powerful. The result
22:703:49734:18:19:71:386:473:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is a robustness that makes our central result widely generalizable.
22:704:49801:19:19:88:540:454:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:As our model shows, we cannot appeal to the Invisible Hand to make markets transparent.
22:705:49888:19:19:71:540:435:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:While competition in product markets often has a favorable effect on prices, driving firms to lower
22:706:49987:19:18:71:539:416:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and more socially efficient prices, it can have the opposite effect on disclosure. Specifically, when
22:707:50088:18:19:71:540:398:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a large part of the firm incentive to disclose is due to the prize value of high status, the entry of
22:708:50189:19:19:71:539:379:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:additional firms can reduce this incentive. In the asymptotic limit of perfect competition, prices
22:709:50287:19:18:71:444:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:converge to their most efficient values, but disclosure fallsto its least efficient.
22:710:50371:18:19:88:539:342:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our analysis in this paper can be applied to debates regarding disclosure that have evolved
22:711:50462:19:19:71:539:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:following the recent financial crisis. Indeed, terms like “sub-prime mortgage” and “collateralized
22:712:50560:19:19:71:540:304:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:debt obligation” became household language and massive devaluations made these “toxic assets”
22:713:50653:19:18:71:540:285:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:infamous in the eyes of the public. Investors and regulatorswere eager to know firms’ exposure to
22:714:50750:18:19:71:540:267:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:these assets, but many firms did not know their own positions.This maps well onto our model, since
22:715:50848:19:19:71:539:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:investors could not be certain which firms accurately knew the contents of their balance sheets.
22:716:50944:19:18:71:539:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Informed firms could choose either to conceal their asset positions, or to disclose the gruesome
22:717:51040:18:19:71:540:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:details. Financial markets might have been able to right themselves more quickly had the position
22:718:51137:19:19:71:540:192:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of insured and insuring firms been known to investors. A greatdeal of media and political attention
22:719:51236:19:19:71:422:173:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:has focused on the need to mitigate or avoid such problems in the future.
22:720:51309:19:18:88:539:154:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:While past models have focused on the “Lemons Problem” of corporate disclosure, little atten-
22:721:51402:18:19:71:539:136:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tion has been paid to the exogenous benefits of positive investor attention. Essentially, existing
22:722:51500:19:19:71:539:117:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:disclosure theory casts disclosures from Wells Fargo in thesame light as disclosures from a local
22:723:51597:19:0:71:539:98:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:grocer. But in financial sectors, where investor attention and high status make a large contribution
23:724:51699:0:19:71:539:690:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to firm value, the comparison is simply inappropriate. If firms do in fact take the benefits of status
23:725:51801:19:19:71:539:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:into account when considering discretionary disclosure, then we can make meaningful predictions
23:726:51896:19:19:71:539:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:about their actions. Understanding the incentives for disclosure allow meaningful predictions to be
23:727:51995:19:18:71:539:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:made about its comparative statics. When economic conditions can change rapidly, such an un-
23:728:52087:18:19:71:540:615:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:derstanding is critical for investors, managers, and regulators alike. In a crisis, our model predicts
23:729:52189:19:19:71:539:596:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that firms that compete for large prizes will be less inclinedto disclose, owing to the increased
23:730:52286:19:18:71:539:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:asymmetric information. Further, while the increase in uncertainty will certainly affect disclosure,
23:731:52386:18:19:71:539:559:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:it is the specifics of the distribution of new information that determine whether a second-order
23:732:52482:19:0:71:347:540:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:stochastic shift will lead to greater or lesser transparency.

40:1585:72386:29:17:88:539:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In this appendix, we present several extensions and alternative model formulations to further

40:1587:72577:18:17:71:539:626:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and prizes that are based on firm percentile. Following that,we explore a sequential disclosure

40:1591:72889:25:17:71:539:538:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our analysis in the body of the paper assumes that the prize isgiven exogenously. One might ask
40:1592:72984:17:18:71:540:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:whether the analysis is robust to considering that residualclaimants (e.g., lenders, suppliers, or
40:1593:73082:18:17:71:540:503:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:labor) set an industry prize optimally to maximize profits. While a full treatment of this is outside
40:1594:73183:17:18:71:539:486:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the scope of this paper, we present the following two-stage game to show that perfect competition
40:1595:73280:18:17:71:411:468:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:still leads to decreased disclosure when endogenous prizesare awarded.
40:1596:73350:17:17:88:539:451:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Let us consider that the residual claimant’s goal in awarding the prize is to efficiently allocate
40:1597:73448:17:18:71:539:434:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a scarce resource (e.g., loans, supplies, labor). Specifically, we consider that the residual claimant
40:1598:73550:18:17:71:540:416:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:can do business with at mostj < Nfirms and wishes to screen potential trading partners via the
40:1599:73644:17:18:71:540:399:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:disclosure process. For any firm that exceeds a thresholdx, the firm is said to be sufficiently solid
40:1600:73745:18:17:71:405:381:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to be a trading partner. Note that in equilibrium,x< tor vice versa.
40:1601:73813:17:18:88:539:364:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We denote the benefit to paying a costφin screening business partners asB(φ, N), which also
40:1602:73904:18:17:71:540:346:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:depends on the number of firms in the market. The game takes place in two stages. AtT= 1, the
40:1603:73997:17:27:71:291:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:residual claimant solves the following problem
40:1604:74043:27:9:258:278:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:max
40:1605:74046:9:0:255:282:293:8:g_d0_f9:8:g_d0_f3:φ∈[0,φ]

40:1607:74067:30:18:71:539:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:which is equivalent to maximizing their economic welfare subject to some bound on the magnitude
40:1608:74162:18:17:71:539:254:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the prize they can award (e.g., cost of funds, cost of supplies, reservation wage). AtT= 2, the
40:1609:74260:17:17:71:393:237:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rest of the disclosure game takes place as in Section 2 of the paper.
40:1610:74329:17:48:88:539:220:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The following proposition characterizes the solution to this problem under perfect competition.
40:1611:74424:48:31:71:264:172:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f4:Proposition B1.AsN→∞,ω∗→ˆω.
40:1612:74451:31:18:71:539:141:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f2:Proof.Consider that the residual claimant wishes to screen firms according to a particularx<0.
40:1613:74545:18:17:71:540:123:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:By construction, the probability that  ̃x >0 for a particular firm isω. Define theMjto be the
40:1614:74638:17:17:71:539:106:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:probability that at leastjfirms out of the totalNdraw a value of at least  ̃x= 0. AsN→ ∞,
40:1615:74727:17:0:71:539:89:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:Mj→1. This implies thatB(φ, N)→0 asN→∞. This, in turn, implies that when the residual
41:1616:74814:0:18:71:539:690:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:claimant solves (B1),φ∗→0 asN→ ∞. Hence, asN→ ∞,ω∗N→ˆω. Finally, the same logic
41:1617:74893:18:23:71:166:672:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f19:holds forx>0.-
41:1618:74907:23:18:88:540:649:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The intuition for Proposition B1 is as follows. As the numberof firms rises to a large number,
41:1619:75001:18:17:71:540:631:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the probability that the residual claimant can identifyjfirms that exceed any particular threshold
41:1620:75099:17:18:71:540:614:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:xapproaches one. In particular, the probability that the residual claimant can identifyjfirms
41:1621:75192:18:17:71:540:596:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:whose disclosure exceedsx= 0 approaches one. Therefore, the need for a prize decreaseswhen
41:1622:75282:17:17:71:540:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:there are more firms present in the market. That is, sinceB(φ, N) becomes small for largeN, the
41:1623:75377:17:18:71:539:562:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:solution to (B1)φ∗diminishes in size. According to our previous analysis in Proposition 3, this
41:1624:75472:18:17:71:363:544:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:implies that disclosure frequency is minimized (i.e.,ω∗→ˆω).
41:1625:75532:17:18:88:539:527:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:It is fair to point out that this result does depend on the absence of product market competition,
41:1626:75630:18:17:71:540:509:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:which we analyzed in Section 4. It also depends on the assumption that there is a representative
41:1627:75726:17:18:71:540:492:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:residual claimant (as opposed to a strategic interaction among claimants). Notwithstanding this,
41:1628:75822:18:17:71:539:474:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:though, it is clear that our primary result can remain robusteven when considering at least one
41:1629:75917:17:29:71:413:457:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reasonable setting in which the prize is set optimally and endogenously.
41:1630:75989:29:25:71:264:428:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B.2  Prizes based on percentiles
41:1631:76021:25:17:71:540:403:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Rather than awarding a fixed number of prizes, we can instead use a firm’s relative ranking. For
41:1632:76117:17:18:71:539:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:example, each firm in the top 20% of theNfirms could be awarded a prize. That is, theN/5
41:1633:76205:18:17:71:539:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:highest disclosures each receive an additionalφ.  We again find that disclosure decreases to its
41:1634:76301:17:17:71:377:351:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:minimum possible frequency in the limit of perfect competition.
41:1635:76364:17:18:88:540:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This variation introduces some complications that preventus from showing the claim from
41:1636:76451:18:17:71:540:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the main model, “equilibrium disclosureω∗Nis strictly decreasing inN.” Because the number of
41:1637:76543:17:18:71:539:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:prizes is discrete, it cannot increase in exact proportion withN. When 20% of the firms receive
41:1638:76638:18:17:71:539:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a prize, for example, a single prize is awarded whenN= 5,6,7,8,9, and we numerically find that
41:1639:76732:17:18:71:540:264:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:ω∗5> ω∗6> . . . > ω∗9. But forN= 10 we suddenly award a second prize, which can mean that
41:1640:76821:18:26:71:525:246:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:ω∗9< ω∗10. We must therefore content ourselves with the perfect competition limit result below.
41:1641:76916:26:17:71:540:220:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f4:Proposition B2.Suppose that for anyN, a fixed fractionλof the competing firms win the prize

41:1643:77099:18:28:71:153:185:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:competitive limit:

41:1645:77130:29:17:71:539:128:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f2:Proof.Lett∗Nbe the equilibrium disclosure threshold withNfirms. Suppose that a firmjobserves
41:1646:77222:17:0:71:539:111:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and discloses exactlyxj=t∗N. Then the probabilityqthat any other given opponent observes a

42:1649:77358:27:17:71:539:636:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Any such realization above the threshold will certainly be disclosed, so the number of firms who

42:1652:77638:18:27:71:179:584:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:higher thanˆt. That is,

44:1818:82039:29:24:71:250:148:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B.4  Volatility and Disclosure
44:1819:82069:24:18:71:539:124:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We now consider the effect of an exogenous distribution change on disclosure, specifically an increase
44:1820:82171:18:17:71:540:106:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in volatility. When volatility suddenly increases, insideinformation becomes more significant as
44:1821:82267:17:0:71:540:89:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:larger deviations from past beliefs become possible, and larger swings in firm prices may result.
45:1822:82366:0:18:71:540:690:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We incorporate an increase in volatility into our analysis by examining the effect of a noisier, or
45:1823:82465:18:17:71:540:672:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:second-order stochastically dominated distribution. Firms and investors realize that they do not
45:1824:82561:17:18:71:539:655:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:know the relevant facts as precisely as they had believed, sonew information acquisitions take on
45:1825:82658:18:17:71:539:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a greater significance, and larger surprises become more likely. We assume that investors are aware
45:1826:82757:17:18:71:432:620:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the regime change, although the signals firms receive willstill be private.
45:1827:82835:18:17:88:538:602:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f7:We consider a shift from the prior distribution  ̃x∼Fto a new distribution  ̃x∼G, whereF
45:1828:82923:17:17:71:540:585:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:stochastically dominatesGin second order. Intuitively, the shift fromFtoGmakes rare events
45:1829:83013:17:18:71:539:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:more likely. This increases the informational advantage offirms, since the events they observe are
45:1830:83111:18:17:71:442:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:likely to be more significant, due to the new distribution’s increased variance.
45:1831:83191:17:18:88:539:533:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:As we have noted before, Jung and Kwon (1988) refine the Dye (1985) model, which is similar to
45:1832:83285:18:17:71:540:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:our model, except that they enforceN= 1 andφ= 0, and they allow a non-zero mean of information
45:1833:83379:17:18:71:539:498:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:eventsE[x]6= 0. In their setting, they show that ifFstochastically dominatesGin second order,
45:1834:83472:18:17:71:539:480:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:thent∗G> t∗F. That is, a noisier distribution induces a higher threshold. We show, however, that
45:1835:83568:17:17:71:540:463:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:this increase int∗need not imply an increase inω∗. That is, because the distribution itself has
45:1836:83663:17:18:71:513:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:changed, the higher disclosure threshold may neverthelessyield a lower disclosure frequency.
45:1837:83755:18:17:88:539:428:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Since finding a closed-form solution for the disclosure frequency ranges from difficult to impos-
45:1838:83852:17:29:71:479:411:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sible, we offer proof of this assertion in the form of the following numerical examples.

45:1840:83983:24:25:71:202:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Compare two distributions:

45:1848:84051:25:17:88:539:280:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:DistributionF(x) has nearly all of its density located around zero. A realization around the
45:1849:84143:17:18:71:540:263:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:mean is almost a sure bet and firms with that or anything above are quick to disclose. Firms that
45:1850:84240:18:17:71:420:245:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:do not disclose are those that receive the rare realizationsin the left tail.
45:1851:84317:17:17:88:539:228:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In a time of increased uncertainty, the distribution could becomeG(x) instead.  This is an
45:1852:84407:17:18:71:539:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:increase in volatility in which the density at the mean shifts to the tails. Note that this distri-
45:1853:84506:18:17:71:538:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f7:bution has the same mean signalx, but much greater variance. We say that the distributionF

45:1855:84637:18:17:88:539:158:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We determine disclosure behavior numerically for the sample parameter values below. Since
45:1856:84726:17:18:71:540:141:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the situations we describe above could occur with or withouta prizeφ, we present the results in

46:1902:85686:25:17:88:540:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Here we consider a shift from a uniform distribution to one with mass in the middle and the
46:1903:85777:17:18:71:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tails. This represents a situation where the initial uniformly distributed information is trumped
46:1904:85874:18:17:71:539:230:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by a larger development that may or may not affect the firm. Thismight the case if, for example,
46:1905:85970:17:18:71:540:213:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:investors are uncertain of whether a particular asset is even present on a firm’s balance sheet, and

46:1909:86281:18:17:88:540:143:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Graphically, it can be seen thatF(x) second-order stochastically dominatesG(x).  Again,
46:1910:86368:17:18:71:540:126:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the disclosure threshold level is certainly lower under distributionG(x). But unlike the previous
