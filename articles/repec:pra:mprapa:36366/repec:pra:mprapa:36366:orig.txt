2:13:490:28:13:108:506:602:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Abstract: The  problem  of  mitigating  climate  change  has  continued  to  dominate 
2:14:576:13:14:108:507:589:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:public  debates  in  terms  of  its  origin,  sources,  potential  impacts  and  possibly 
2:15:666:14:14:108:507:575:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:adaptation  strategies.  In  this  paper,  the  contributions  of  energy  to  the  climate 
2:16:758:14:14:108:507:561:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:change  debate  are  explored.  The  analysis based  on  the  secondary  information 
2:17:843:14:14:108:507:547:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:shows  that  the  global  use  of  fossil  fuels has  increased  and  dominated  world 
2:18:929:14:13:108:506:533:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:energy consumption and supply. This case is quite similar to Indian case and the 
2:19:1010:13:14:108:507:520:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:emissions in Indian are also increasing.  To  account  for  the  change  in  CO2 
2:20:1087:14:14:108:507:506:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:emission,  we  have  followed  index  decomposition  analysis  using  data  from  the 
2:21:1173:14:14:108:507:492:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:PROWESS  database  of  the  Center  for  Monitoring  Indian  Economy.  Two  factors 
2:22:1257:14:14:108:507:478:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:are  considered  to  account  for  the  changes  in  emission  intensity  of  Indian 
2:23:1342:14:13:108:506:464:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:economy,  namely,  (1) output  shift  among  three  sectors of  the  India  economy 
2:24:1426:13:14:108:507:451:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(Agriculture, Service and Manufacturing) and (2) the structural change based on 
2:25:1506:14:14:108:507:437:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  aggregate  output  change with  respect  to  the  emissions change  for  the  post 
2:26:1592:14:14:108:506:423:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:globalised period. Based on the estimates we found that the structural change in 
2:27:1672:14:14:108:506:409:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Indian  economy  from  1991-2007  plays a major  role  in  reducing  emission  as 
2:28:1752:14:13:108:507:395:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:compared  to  the  output  shifts  across  the  sectors.  Based  on  the  findings  and 
2:29:1840:13:14:108:507:382:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:international  experiences,  few  policy  options  for  Indian  case such  as; energy 
2:30:1924:14:14:108:507:368:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:pricing  reforms,  promoting  investment  in  renewable  energy  technologies  and 
2:31:2007:14:28:108:382:354:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:creating public environmental awareness are suggested.

3:49:2978:28:34:72:176:608:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1. Introduction 
3:50:2992:34:21:72:543:574:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:There  has  been  a  rapid  rise  in  the  use  of  energy  resources  and  consequently  emission  of 
3:51:3095:21:21:72:543:553:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  due  to  structural  changes  in  the Indian  economy  in  the  past  fifty  years. 
3:52:3203:21:20:72:543:532:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The energy mix in India has shifted towards coal, due to higher endowment of coal relative to oil 
3:53:3301:20:21:72:543:512:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and gas, which has led to a rapidly rising trend of energy emissions intensities (IEA, 2007). The 
3:54:3399:21:21:72:542:491:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:energy intensity of India is over twice that of the matured economies, which are represented by 
3:55:3495:21:21:72:543:470:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f10:the  OECD  member  countries  (IEA,  2007).  However,  since  1999,  India‟s  energy  intensity  has 
3:56:3596:21:20:72:542:449:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:been decreasing and is expected to decrease (Planning Commission, Govt. of India, 20013). The 
3:57:3690:20:21:72:543:429:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:decline in energy intensity in the Indian economy could be attributed to several factors; some of 
3:58:3788:21:21:72:543:408:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:them being demographic shifts from rural to urban areas, structural changes towards less energy 
3:59:3884:21:20:72:542:387:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:intensive industries, impressive growth of services, improvement in efficiency of energy use, and 
3:60:3982:20:21:72:543:367:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:inter-fuel  substitution. Energy  is  and  will  continue  to  be  a  primary  engine  for  economic 
3:61:4083:21:21:72:540:346:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:development. The three last centuries have seen mankind‟s substantial dependence upon an ever-
3:62:4176:21:20:72:542:325:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:growing use of fossil fuels for industrialization and urbanization (Cao, 2003; Reddish and Rand, 
3:63:4272:20:35:72:109:305:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1996).  
3:64:4278:35:21:72:543:270:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Climate  change  is  the  long-term,  significant  change  in  the  patterns,  glaciations  and related 
3:65:4381:21:21:72:543:249:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:aspects  of  the  global  climate  system. Mitigating  the  impact  of  climate  change  has  dominated 
3:66:4484:21:20:72:542:228:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:most  public  discourse  not  only  by environmental  economists  but  also  by  other  environmental 
3:67:4585:20:21:72:543:208:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:experts   and   scientists.   The   effects   of   energy   consumption   combustion   are   evaluated   as 
3:68:4692:21:21:72:543:187:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:greenhouse   effects   resulting   from   emissions   of   environmental   pollutants   such   as carbon 
3:69:4796:21:20:72:543:166:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:monoxide, hydrocarbon compounds, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, methane and the particulates. 
3:70:4890:20:21:72:543:146:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Amongst several  pollutants  causing  climate  change,  a  great  deal  of  attention  has  been  given  to 
3:71:4997:21:21:72:543:125:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:CO2 emission  as the major  factor in the climate change. While the impact of other forms  of air 
3:72:5093:21:18:72:543:104:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:pollutants is primarily local or regional, CO2 emissions are, above all, global in scale. Sources of

4:75:5395:0:20:72:543:708:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:CO2 emission  often cited  in  the  literature  include  the  energy  related  component,  especially,  the 
4:76:5501:20:21:72:542:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:combustion of fossil fuels. Others include the non-fuel use of energy inputs, and emissions from 
4:77:5597:21:21:72:543:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:electricity   generation   using   non-biogenic municipal   solid   waste   and   geothermal   energy, 
4:78:5699:21:34:72:475:646:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:emissions from industrial processes, such as cement and limestone production, etc.  
4:79:5780:34:21:72:543:612:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:This  paper  is  concerned  with  the  contribution  of  energy  to  the  climate  change  debate mostly 
4:80:5884:21:21:72:543:591:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:focused on the post globalised era for the Indian economy. An attempt has made to compare the 
4:81:5978:21:20:72:543:570:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:recent scenario of developing and the developed world along with the aggregate scenario. In this 
4:82:6074:20:21:72:543:550:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:connection, some useful questions could be raised: To what extent is energy responsible for CO2 
4:83:6169:21:21:72:543:529:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:emission? What are the viable options for mitigating energy-related climate change for emerging 
4:84:6263:21:21:72:543:508:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:economy such as India at the post globalised era? The structure of this paper is the following. In 
4:85:6361:21:20:72:543:487:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the next section, we undertake a brief review of the origin of the climate change debacle. Next, 
4:86:6457:20:21:72:542:467:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:we examine the role of energy to climate change. Thereafter, we outline some policy options for 
4:87:6552:21:21:72:543:446:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mitigating climate change on the basis of a decomposition analysis of the CO2 emission. The last 
4:88:6647:21:34:72:356:425:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:section provides the summary and conclusion to the paper. 
4:89:6703:34:30:72:408:391:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2. Relationship between Energy Consumption and Emission  
4:90:6758:30:21:72:543:361:12:g_d0_f10:12:Times New Roman:The  phrase  “climate  change”  and  “global  warming”  and more  recently  “global  cooling”  is 
4:91:6854:21:21:72:543:340:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:increasingly  assuming  a  topical  dimension  in  global  climatic  and  environmental  discourse.  It  is 
4:92:6962:21:20:72:542:319:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:one of the most challenging problems with which our contemporary world has been faced. It has 
4:93:7055:20:21:72:542:299:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:become  a  subject  of  major international  co-operation  through  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on 
4:94:7156:21:21:72:542:278:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Climate  Change  (IPCC)  which  was set  up  in  1988  by  the  World  Meteorological  Organization 
4:95:7255:21:20:72:542:257:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme. According to Girardet and Mendonca 
4:96:7341:20:21:72:543:237:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(2009), the origin of climate change can be traced to the impact of human activities that started 
4:97:7438:21:21:72:543:216:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:about  300  years  ago. As  the  industrial revolution  unfolded,  the  increase  in  the  use  of  coal,  and 
4:98:7548:21:21:72:542:195:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:then  oil  and  gas,  not  only  massively increased  human  productive  power  and mobility  but  was 
4:99:7650:21:20:72:542:174:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:also  a  major  contributor  to  the  tenfold growth  in  human  population,  from  some  700  million  in 
4:100:7756:20:21:72:542:154:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1709  to  nearly  7  billion  today  (Girardet  and Mendonca,  2009).  Today, Japan,  Korea,  Brazil, 
4:101:7856:21:21:72:542:133:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Mexico, Venezuela, China, India and South Africa are on their path to becoming major industrial 
4:102:7950:21:0:72:542:112:12:g_d0_f10:12:Times New Roman:nations in their own right. China‟s industrial boom, for instance, is linked to a rapid increase in 
5:103:8133:0:20:72:543:708:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f10:domestic  energy  consumption  with  millions  of  cars  manufactured  yearly.  China‟s  coal 
5:104:8227:20:35:72:391:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:consumption, mainly in power station, is going up in similar rate.  
5:105:8293:35:21:72:542:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:According  to  the  1992  World  Bank  projections,  world population  will be more  than  double  by 
5:106:8394:21:20:72:542:632:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2150 (World  Bank,  1992).  High  population  growth  and  increased  urbanization  invariably  will 
5:107:8494:20:21:72:542:612:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:lead  to increased  demand  for  energy, implying  increased  expected  environmental  damage  as 
5:108:8591:21:21:72:542:591:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:well. The increased concentrations of key greenhouse gases (GHGs) are direct consequences of 
5:109:8682:21:20:72:542:570:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:human activities. Energy production and consumption have various environmental implications, 
5:110:8774:20:21:72:542:550:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:one of which is climate change. Among the many human activities that produce GHGs, the use 
5:111:8864:21:21:72:543:529:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of  energy  represents  by  far  the  largest  source  of  emissions (IEA  statistics  on  CO2 emission, 
5:112:8967:21:21:72:542:508:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2011).  Energy  accounts  for  over  83%  of  the  global  anthropogenic  GHGs,  with emissions 
5:113:9062:21:20:72:543:487:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:resulting  from  the  production, transformation,  handling  and consumption  of  all  kinds  of energy 
5:114:9165:20:21:72:542:467:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:commodities. Energy  use  emissions  are predominantly  responsible  for  CO2 emissions (92%). 
5:115:9257:21:21:72:542:446:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Smaller  shares  correspond  to  agriculture,  producing mainly  CH4 and  N2O  from  industrial 
5:116:9351:21:20:72:543:425:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:processes  not  related  to  energy,  producing  mainly  fluorinated gases  and  N2O.  GHG  emissions 
5:117:9452:20:21:72:542:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:from  the  energy  sector  are  dominated  by  the  direct  combustion  of fuels,  a  process  leading  to 
5:118:9558:21:21:72:543:384:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:large  emissions  of  CO2.  A  by-product  of  fuel  combustion, CO2 results  from the  oxidation  of 
5:119:9658:21:20:72:543:363:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:carbon  in  fuels  (IEA,  2011).  Responsible  for  about  92%  of  the  energy-related emissions,  CO2

5:121:9849:21:21:72:543:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(IEA,  2011). A  key  factor  responsible  for  the  higher  energy-related  emissions  and  climate 
5:122:9950:21:21:72:543:301:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:change  challenge  is  the  increased  global  reliance  on  primary  energy  supply  to  drive  economic 
5:123:10056:21:20:72:542:280:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:growth  and  development. The Global  total  primary  supply  (TPES)  doubled  between  1971  and 
5:124:10153:20:21:72:542:260:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2009,  primarily  relying on  fossil  fuels.  In  other  words,  fossil  fuels  still  account  for  most  of  the 
5:125:10268:21:21:72:543:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:world energy supply. The figure shows that in-spite of the growth of non-fossil energy (such as 
5:126:10364:21:29:72:543:218:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:nuclear  and  hydropower)  which  are  usually  considered  as  non-polluting,  fossil  fuels have

6:138:11682:0:20:72:543:708:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:continue  to  maintain  their  dominance  in  TPES  for  the  past  37  years  under  review.  In  2009,  it 
6:139:11791:20:35:72:291:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:accounted for 81% of the TPES in the world. 
6:140:11834:35:21:72:543:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  high  global  dependence  upon  fossil  fuels  clearly  is  responsible  for  the  observed  upward 
6:141:11938:21:20:72:543:632:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:trends in the global CO2 emissions, as illustrated in Figure-1. Since the industrial revolution, CO2 
6:142:12037:20:21:72:543:612:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:emissions  from  fuel  combustion  have  witnessed  a  dramatic  increase  from  its  near  zero  level  in 
6:143:12145:21:21:72:542:591:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the 1870s  (See  Quadrelli  and  Peterson,  2007,  IEA,  2010a)  to  about  29.4  million  tons  by  2008 
6:144:12250:21:20:72:543:570:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(Figure-3). The  figure  shows  that CO2 emissions  from  fossil  fuels  combustion  in  2008  are 
6:145:12347:20:21:72:543:550:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:increasing at a faster rate from 1870. Meanwhile, total global energy supply is projected to rise 
6:146:12445:21:21:72:542:529:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:by 52% between 2008 and 2030 (IEA, 2010a) and with fossil fuels remaining at 81% of TPES, 
6:147:12534:21:21:72:542:508:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:CO2 emissions are consequently expected to continue their growth unabated (unless some drastic 
6:148:12627:21:20:72:542:487:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:measures are taken) and will reach 40.4 Gt CO2 by 2030 (IEA, 2010a). The trend is expected to 
6:149:12719:20:21:72:542:467:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:be  intensified  due  to  the  projected high  increase  in  world  energy  consumption  demand  by  the 
6:150:12824:21:21:72:543:446:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:BRICS  countries  like  China  and  India.  It  is  projected  that  the  shares  of  China  in  world  energy 
6:151:12935:21:20:72:543:425:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:consumption  would  outstrip  that  of  the  United  States  by  the  year  2020.  It  is  obvious  that  the 
6:152:13045:20:21:72:542:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:socio-economic  and  technological  characteristics  of  development  paths  of  the  industrializing 
6:153:13147:21:21:72:543:384:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:countries  will  strongly  affects  energy-related  emissions  and  hence,  the  rate  and  magnitude  of 
6:154:13253:21:20:72:543:363:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:climate  change,  climate  change  impacts,  the  capability  for  adaptation  and  mitigation  of  climate 
6:155:13361:20:21:72:543:343:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:change  emissions.  However,  presently,  the  figure  shows  that  the  United  States  still  dominates 
6:156:13467:21:21:72:543:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:world energy consumption followed by China and India and doubtless the higher emitters of CO2 
6:157:13560:21:35:72:197:301:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:energy-related emissions. 
6:158:13585:35:20:72:542:266:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:It  may  be  important  to further  disaggregate  the  sources  of  energy-related  CO2 emissions. 
6:159:13683:20:21:72:540:246:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Available data on the contribution of fuel to global CO2 emissions as at 2009 is shown in Figure-
6:160:13779:21:21:72:542:225:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2.  It  can  be  seen  that  although  coal  represents  only  one-quarter  of  the  world  TPES  in  2009,  it 
6:161:13891:21:20:72:542:204:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:accounted  for  43%  of  the  global  CO2 emissions  due  to  its  heavy  carbon  content  per  unit  of 
6:162:13995:20:21:72:542:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:energy  released.  Compared  to  gas,  coal  is  on  the  average  nearly  as  twice  emission  intensive5. 
6:163:14103:21:21:72:543:163:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Without additional measures the supply of coal is projected to grow from 2775 million tons of oil 
6:164:14201:21:20:72:543:142:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:equivalent  (Mtoe)  in  2004  to  4441  Mtoe  in  2030  (Quadrelli  and  Peterson,  2007).  In  the  future, 
6:165:14310:20:25:72:543:122:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:coal is therefore expected to satisfy much of the growing energy demand of emerging developed

7:169:14773:0:20:72:543:708:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:countries  like  China  and  India,  where  energy  intensive  industrial  production  is  growing  rapidly 
7:170:14881:20:21:72:543:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and  large  coal  reserves  exist  with  limited  reserves  of  other  energy  sources  (Quadrelli  and

7:177:15315:21:21:72:543:354:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contribution  is  relatively  stable  over  time.  However,  the  rate  at  which  it  grows  in  India  and  in 
7:178:15428:21:20:72:543:333:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f10:particular China is troublesome. In fact, China overtook the United States in 2007 as the world‟s 
7:179:15526:20:21:72:542:313:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:largest  annual  emitter  of  energy-related  CO2,  although  as  shown  by  IEA  (2010a)  the  United 
7:180:15629:21:21:72:543:292:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:States will still remains the largest in many years to come in terms of cumulative and per capita 
7:181:15727:21:34:72:107:271:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:terms.  
7:182:15734:34:21:72:542:237:12:g_d0_f10:12:Times New Roman:In other words, it has been argued that China‟s emission rate of CO2 is important to significantly 
7:183:15832:21:21:72:543:216:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f10:affect  world  indicators.  Quadrelli  and  Peterson  (2007)  have  shown  that  the  rise  in  China‟s  per 
7:184:15941:21:20:72:543:195:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:capita emissions (+17%) causes global emissions to rise by 4%. It is important to note that fossil 
7:185:16040:20:21:72:542:175:12:g_d0_f10:12:Times New Roman:fuels represents more than 80% of China‟s energy mix; the country draws more than 60% of its 
7:186:16133:21:21:72:543:154:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:energy  supply  from  coal  alone  (IEA,  2010a).  Generation  of  electricity  and  heat  was  by  far  the 
7:187:16242:21:24:72:543:133:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:largest  producer of CO2 emissions  and was responsible for 39%  of the world  CO2 emissions  in 
7:188:16337:24:8:72:218:109:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:                                                            
7:189:16396:8:16:72:543:101:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:6 The ten top CO2 emitting countries in the world as at 2008 were China, United States, Russian Federation, India, 
7:190:16509:16:11:79:542:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:Japan, Germany, Canada, United Kingdom, Islamic Republic of Iran and Korea, in that order. These ten countries 
7:191:16620:11:0:79:447:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:account for 19.1 Gt CO2 out of the world‟s 29.3 Gt CO2 in 2008 (see Fig. A1 at Appendix). 
8:192:16791:0:20:72:542:708:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2008.  Globally,  evidence  (from  IEA, 2010a)  indicates  that  this  sector  is  noted  for  its  heavy 
8:193:16897:20:21:72:542:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reliance  on  coal,  the  most  carbon-intensive  of  fossil  fuels  and  thus  amplifying  its  share  in 
8:194:17004:21:21:72:542:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:worldwide emissions of CO2. In this connection, studying Indian case for the emission scenario 
8:195:17099:21:34:72:500:646:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:becomes important in order to estimate the changes those attributes in the globalised era.

8:200:17331:35:21:72:543:320:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:India's development path is based on its unique resource endowments, the overriding priority of 
8:201:17427:21:20:72:543:299:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:economic  and  social  development  and  poverty  eradication.  In  charting  out  a  developmental 
8:202:17527:20:21:72:543:279:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:pathway  which  is  ecologically  sustainable,  India  has  a  wider  spectrum  of  choices  precisely 
8:203:17630:21:21:72:542:258:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:because it is at an early stage of development. India is faced with the challenge of sustaining its 
8:204:17730:21:20:72:543:237:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rapid  economic  growth  while  dealing  with  the  global  threat  of  climate  change.  This  threat 
8:205:17833:20:21:72:542:217:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:emanates  from  accumulated  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  the  atmosphere,  anthropogenically 
8:206:17930:21:21:72:543:196:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:generated  through  long-term  and  intensive  industrial  growth  and  high  consumption  lifestyles  in 
8:207:18036:21:20:72:543:175:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:developed  countries.  Climate  change  may  alter  the  distribution  and  quality  of  India's  natural 
8:208:18142:20:21:72:543:155:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:resources  and  adversely  affect  the  livelihood  of  its  people.  With  an  economy  closely  tied  to  its 
8:209:18254:21:21:72:542:134:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:natural resource base and climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture, water and forestry, India 
8:210:18353:21:27:72:543:113:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:may face a major threat because of the projected changes in climate. India emits more than 5% of

9:213:18671:0:20:72:543:708:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:global  CO2 emissions,  and  emissions  continue  to  grow.  CO2 emissions  have  almost  tripled 
9:214:18767:20:21:72:543:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:between 1990 and  2009. The  WEO  2010 New Policies  Scenario  projects that  CO2 emissions  in 
9:215:18863:21:21:72:542:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:India will increase by almost 2.5 times between 2008 and 2035. Large shares of these emissions 
9:216:18958:21:20:72:542:646:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:are produced by the electricity and heat sector, which represented 54% of CO2 in 2009, up from 
9:217:19051:20:21:72:542:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:40% in 1990. CO2 emissions in the transport sector accounted for only 9% of total emissions in 
9:218:19146:21:35:72:398:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2009, but transport is one of the fastest growing sectors (figure-3a).

9:223:19437:21:20:72:543:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:oil (Figure-3b). The share of fossil fuels in the generation mix grew from 73% in 1990 to 85% in 
9:224:19534:20:21:72:543:297:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2002. The share of fossil fuels has declined steadily since then, falling to 81% in 2006, although 
9:225:19633:21:21:72:543:276:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:increasing back up to 84% in 2009. Although electricity produced from hydro has actually risen

9:229:20030:21:21:72:543:193:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Climate  Change,  India  plans  to  install  20  GW  of  solar  power  by  2020.  With  an  installed  wind 
9:230:20138:21:20:72:542:172:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:capacity of 12 GW in 2010, India has the world‟s fifth-largest installed capacity of wind power 
9:231:20233:20:21:72:542:152:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of  the BRICS  countries,  India  has  the  lowest  CO2 emissions  per  capita  (1.4   T-CO2  in    2009), 
9:232:20339:21:21:72:542:131:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:about  one-third  that  of  the  world  average.  However,  due  to  the  recent  large  increases  in 
9:233:20442:21:20:72:542:110:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:emissions,  the  Indian  ratio  is  more  than  two  times  that  of  its  ratio  in  1990  and will  continue  to 
9:234:20556:20:0:72:543:90:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f10:grow. India‟s per capita emissions in 2035 will, however, still be well below those in the OECD 
10:235:20736:0:20:72:542:708:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:member countries today. In terms of CO2/GDP, India has continuously improved the efficiency 
10:236:20827:20:35:72:539:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of its economy and reduced the CO2 emissions per unit of GDP by 16% between 1990 and 2009. 
10:237:20915:35:21:72:542:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:To understand the factors affecting the increase in CO2 emission in India, we have followed the 
10:238:21010:21:20:72:543:632:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:index decomposition analysis. Most  importantly we have focused on the post 1991 case  for the 
10:239:21105:20:21:72:542:612:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Indian  economy.  In  analyzing  the  increase  in  CO2 emission,  we  have  used  the  three  important 
10:240:21209:21:21:72:543:591:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sectors of the economy and their output changes from 1991. The three sectors of Indian economy 
10:241:21304:21:20:72:543:570:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:are the agriculture, manufacturing and the service sector. The decomposition of CO2 emission is 
10:242:21398:20:21:72:542:550:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:as  follows. The  detail  methodology  followed  in  the  study  is  narrated  to  explain  the  underlying 
10:243:21506:21:21:72:543:529:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:concept  with  reference  to  the  decomposition  of  a  change  in  the  aggregate  emission  intensity  of 
10:244:21615:21:21:72:543:508:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Indian  Economy.  We  are  following  the  two-factor  case  in  which  a  change  in  the  aggregate 
10:245:21717:21:20:72:543:487:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:intensity is decomposed to give the impacts of structural change and sectoral output change using 
10:246:21815:20:21:72:543:467:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:with intensity approach. Let us assume that total emission of the economy is the sum of emission 
10:247:21911:21:21:72:542:446:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:from „n‟ different sectors time „t‟. The emission intensity is defined as a ratio of the emission of 
10:248:22009:21:20:72:542:425:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  Indian  Economy  of  sector „i‟ at  time „t‟ to  the  total  output of  the  same  sector  (defined  as

10:257:22386:29:40:72:488:228:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Let us express the aggregate emission intensity as a summation of the sectoral data as:

10:261:22497:46:34:72:314:145:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Where, the summation is taken over the n sectors. 
10:262:22545:34:21:72:543:111:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We derive the general parametric Divisia method in a manner the same as that described in Liu 
10:263:22638:21:0:72:489:90:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and Ang (2007).  Differentiating equation above with respect to t yields the following:

13:351:25767:27:21:72:543:360:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We can see from the table-2 that the changes in emission intensity is driven by the change in the 
13:352:25863:21:21:72:542:339:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:structural change of the economy and changes in the sectoral output change in Indian economy. 
13:353:25955:21:20:72:542:318:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In  case  of  the  year  1992,  we  can  see  that  the positive change  of 25.97 percent  in  the  energy 
13:354:26060:20:21:72:543:298:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:intensity as compared to the 1991 is driven by -44.11% change in structural change in the output, 
13:355:26158:21:21:72:542:277:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and  27.21%  change  in  sectoral  energy  intensity.  The  change  in  the  energy  intensity  is  not 
13:356:26262:21:20:72:542:256:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:consistence from 1991 to 2007, so as the case with both sectoral emission intensity change and 
13:357:26356:20:35:72:429:236:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the structural effect. Figure-9 explains this phenomenon using a diagram.  
13:358:26429:35:21:72:542:201:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We  can  observe  the  variation  in the total emission intensity, sectoral emission intensity and the 
13:359:26530:21:21:72:542:180:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:change  in sectoral  output intensity  due  to  the  structural  effect  from  figure-5.  It  can  be  clearly 
13:360:26640:21:20:72:543:159:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:noticed  from  the  figure  that  the emission intensity  change  in  Indian economy in  mainly  due  to 
13:361:26743:20:21:72:542:139:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  change  in  the  structural output change  and yielded a  negative  relation.  Once  there is a 
13:362:26842:21:21:72:543:118:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:negative change in the sectoral share of output, the emission intensity of the different sectors of 
13:363:26940:21:20:72:542:97:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  economy are  rising  and  vice  versa.  However,  the  sectoral emission intensity  has  a  positive 
13:364:27044:20:0:72:542:77:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relationship  with  the total  emission intensity  of  the  Indian economy. It  can  be  noted  that  the 
14:365:27234:0:20:72:543:708:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:change  in  the  emission  due  to  the  structural  change  of  the  economy  is  largely  during  the 
14:366:27338:20:21:72:543:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:implementation  of  the  LPG  policy  mostly during 1992-1999,  however  thereafter,  a  negative 
14:367:27435:21:21:72:543:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relationship  between  emission  change  and  structural  change  is  found  out.  As  the  output  of  the 
14:368:27543:21:20:72:543:646:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:economy  from  the  three  sectors  (agriculture,  manufacturing  and  service)  are  growing  over  the 
14:369:27648:20:35:72:327:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:period it adds up the change in the emission facture.

14:372:27778:25:21:72:543:384:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Analysis based on the decomposition analysis has resulted that the structural change and output 
14:373:27874:21:20:72:543:363:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:change  are  negatively  related  while  we  consider  the emission  change  from  1991-2007  for  the 
14:374:27977:20:21:72:542:343:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Indian economy. Hence at the post globalised scenario Indian economy should concentrate more 
14:375:28069:21:21:72:543:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of stabilizing the structural  change in the economy and  use  of  more technological  sophisticated 
14:376:28170:21:20:72:543:301:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:machines  and  aim  of  shifting towards  clean  energy  sources.  From  the  review  and  international 
14:377:28274:20:21:72:543:281:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:experience  and  suggestions  we  can  divide  the  policy  intervention  in  seven  broad  areas  from 
14:378:28378:21:21:72:543:260:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:regulations  and  standards  to  institutional initiatives. It  is  important  to  note  that  irrespective  of 
14:379:28488:21:20:72:543:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:any  policy  choice,  mitigating  the  impact  of  energy  related  climate  change  will  require  the

15:438:31187:27:21:72:543:249:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Under  the  Energy  Conservation  Act  (2001),  energy  intensive  industrial  sectors,  i.e.  thermal 
15:439:31290:21:21:72:543:228:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:power stations, fertilizer, cement, iron and steel, aluminum, railways, textile and pulp and paper, 
15:440:31390:21:20:72:542:207:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:are  required  to  employ  a  certified  energy  manager,  conduct  energy  audits  periodically,  and 
15:441:31493:20:21:72:542:187:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:adhere  to  specific  energy-consumption  norms  that  may  be  prescribed.  Currently,  almost  every 
15:442:31596:21:21:72:543:166:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:industrial sector is characterized by a wide band of energy efficiencies in different units. Several 
15:443:31697:21:20:72:542:145:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of  them  are  at  global  frontier  levels,  but  some  others  have  relatively  poor  performance.  As  an 
15:444:31807:20:21:72:542:125:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:approach  to  enhancement  of  overall energy efficiency  in  each  sector,  the  efficiency  band-width 
15:445:31912:21:21:72:543:104:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of  the  sector  is  divided  into  bands.  To  promote  technology  upgradation  in  the  SME  (small  and 
15:446:32020:21:0:72:543:83:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:medium enterprise) sector, it would be essential to evolve sector-specific integrated programmes 
16:447:32202:0:20:72:543:708:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for  technology  development.  This  would  require  external  support  for  significantly  longer 
16:448:32301:20:21:72:542:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:durations  to  address  various  technological  barriers  and  promote  energy  efficiencies  at  the  unit 
16:449:32409:21:21:72:543:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:level.  Most  of  the  energy-efficient  equipment  requires  higher  upfront  investment. This  means 
16:450:32512:21:20:72:542:646:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that  there  is  no  one-size-fit-all  policy  prescription  to  climate  change  mitigation.  A  combination 
16:451:32622:20:35:72:465:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of policy options is needed. In line with this, the following options are preferred:  
16:452:32707:35:35:72:203:591:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(a) Energy Pricing Reform 
16:453:32732:35:20:108:543:556:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  World  Bank  estimates  for  1993  showed  that  developing  countries  and  transition 
16:454:32825:20:21:108:543:536:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:economies  spent  more  than  $230  billion  per  year  on  subsiding  energy  (Cao,  2003). 
16:455:32918:21:21:108:543:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Energy  products  like  coal  in China,  India,  Poland  and  Turkey  have  been  heavily 
16:456:33008:21:21:108:543:494:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:subsidized (World Bank, 2000), just as Nigeria spends billions on petroleum subsidy. The 
16:457:33097:21:20:108:543:473:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:implication of this has been inefficient use of energy as well as serving as a disincentive 
16:458:33189:20:21:108:542:453:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for  controlling  energy-related  emissions.  Efficient  energy  pricing  will  not  only  remove 
16:459:33287:21:21:108:543:432:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:these  price  distortions  but  would  sharply  reduce  the  growth  in  energy  consumption  and 
16:460:33385:21:34:108:475:411:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:could also cut world carbon emissions by 10% (see World Bank, 2000:41)8. 
16:461:33457:34:35:72:168:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(b) Emission Taxes 
16:462:33475:35:21:108:542:342:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:It  is  obvious  that  efficient  pricing  reforms  that  results  in  energy  prices  reflecting 
16:463:33573:21:20:108:543:321:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:production may still be far from reflecting social cost. Emission taxes could prove useful 
16:464:33664:20:21:108:542:301:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in adjusting market prices to reflect externalities. A high taxes on carbon-intensive fuels 
16:465:33756:21:21:108:542:280:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:like  coal  could  reduce  their  consumption  and  hence  carbon  emissions.  In  Mexico,  an 
16:466:33851:21:21:108:543:259:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:application  of  gasoline  tax,  among  other  measures,  has  helped  to  dramatically  reduced 
16:467:33948:21:34:108:428:238:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:GHG emissions coming from transportation (World Bank, 1992).  
16:468:34009:34:35:72:317:204:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(c) Promotion of Investment in Renewable Energy 
16:469:34055:35:21:108:543:169:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Ultimately,   the   mitigation   of   energy-related  climate   change   rest   upon   the   use   of 
16:470:34157:21:28:108:543:148:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:renewable  energy  including  hydro,  solar,  wind,  biomass  and  other  forms  of  renewable  ,

16:472:34314:7:16:72:542:113:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:8 It  is  important  to  note  that  the  removal  of  energy  subsidies  has  always  faced  the  problem  of  trade-off  between 
16:473:34444:16:12:79:542:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:worsening the level of poverty for the majority of the population and improving the environmental quality. Again, 
16:474:34558:12:11:79:542:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:it is usually reasoned that one-stop removal of such subsidies may worsen the environmental problems because the 
16:475:34671:11:0:79:533:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:affected poor may substitute poorer quality fuels for the cleaner but now (with removal of subsidies) dearer fuels 
17:476:34870:0:20:108:542:708:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:which  are  more  environmentally  friendly  than  conventional  fuels  (Cao,  2003).  In  many 
17:477:34966:20:21:108:543:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:developing countries, there is a huge untapped and inefficiently utilized renewable energy 
17:478:35057:21:21:108:543:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:resource   which   need   specific   national   policy   initiatives   and   international   support, 
17:479:35159:21:20:108:542:646:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:including   finance,   capacity   building   and   technology   transfer   to be   exploited. 
17:480:35253:20:21:108:543:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Environmental  taxes  on  fossil  fuels  may  be  required  to  stimulate  reactions  in  favor  of 
17:481:35353:21:21:108:543:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:renewable  energy.  Increased  funding  of  R&D  in  renewable  energy  should  also  be 
17:482:35442:21:34:108:155:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:pursued.  
17:483:35451:34:35:72:296:550:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(d) Improve Public Environmental Awareness 
17:484:35493:35:21:108:542:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Ignorance  of  the  serious impact  of  their  collective  actions  on  climate  change  by  the 
17:485:35589:21:21:108:543:494:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:general public is an important cause of environmental damage and a serious impediment 
17:486:35675:21:20:108:543:473:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to  finding  solutions.  Adequate  environmental  information  is  required  to  enlighten  the 
17:487:35771:20:21:108:543:453:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:public  on  the  seriousness  of  the  worsening  environment  they  are  living  in,  the  costs  to 
17:488:35873:21:21:108:543:432:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f10:their  health  and  quality  of  life.  Such  enlightenment  would  help  to  raise  peoples‟ 
17:489:35967:21:20:108:543:411:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:consciousness  and  enlist  public  support  for  environmental  protection  laws  or  policies. 
17:490:36064:20:35:108:536:391:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:This could help to facilitate and augment official enforcement of environmental policies. 
17:491:36153:35:35:72:244:356:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:5. Summary and Conclusion 
17:492:36177:35:20:72:543:321:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:One  of  the  major  problems  facing  humanity  in  terms  of  achieving  sustainable  development  is 
17:493:36280:20:21:72:542:301:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f10:climate   change.   Many   economic   activities   release   greenhouse   gasses within  the  earth‟s 
17:494:36382:21:21:72:543:280:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:atmosphere.  The  paper  explored  the  role  of energy  in  the  climate  change in  particular  case 
17:495:36484:21:21:72:542:259:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relating  to  the  emission.  Evidence  has  revealed  that  fossil  fuels  constitute  the  single  largest 
17:496:36593:21:20:72:543:238:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:human  influence  on  the  climate  change  debate,  accounting  for  over  80%  of the  anthropogenic 
17:497:36695:20:21:72:542:218:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:greenhouse emissions. Given the fact that primary energy still dominates the world energy mix, 
17:498:36790:21:21:72:542:197:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reducing  energy-related carbon  emissions  may  require  reducing  the  amount  of  fossil  fuel 
17:499:36887:21:34:72:280:176:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:consumption and hence economic growth.  
17:500:36925:34:21:72:543:142:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In case of Indian economy empirical estimates based on a decomposition analysis found that the 
17:501:37020:21:21:72:543:121:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:structural  changes in  the economy are  more important  to  reduce  emission.  However, the output 
17:502:37120:21:20:72:543:100:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:changes  are  surely  increasing  the  CO2 emission  largely  due  to  use  of fossil fuel.  Hence, 
17:503:37219:20:0:72:542:80:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:improving  energy  efficiency,  reforms  of  inefficient  energy  pricing,  imposition  of  carbon 
18:504:37403:0:20:72:542:708:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:emission taxes,  promoting  investment  in  renewable  energy  and  creating  public  environmental 
18:505:37502:20:35:72:470:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:awareness are some of the mitigation strategies suggested for the Indian economy.
