2:29:1590:28:28:273:338:616:12:Times:12:Times:?:ABSTRACT
2:30:1598:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:A:We  argue  that  standard  modeling  practices  often  overstate  the  potency  of  general-equilibrium 
2:31:1702:14:14:72:545:574:12:Times:12:Times:A:(GE) mechanisms. We formalize the notion that GE adjustment is weak, or that it takes time, by 
2:32:1796:14:14:72:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:A:modifying an  elementary  Walrasian  economy  in  two  alternative  manners.  In  one,  we  replace 
2:33:1895:14:14:71:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:A:Rational  Expectations Equilibrium  with  solution  concepts  that  mimic  Tâtonnement  or  Cobweb 
2:34:1993:14:14:71:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:A:dynamics, Level-k Thinking, Reflective Equilibrium, and certain kinds of cognitive discounting. 
2:35:2088:14:14:71:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:A:In  the  other,  we  maintain  rational expectations  but  remove  common  knowledge  of  aggregate 
2:36:2187:14:14:71:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:A:shocks  and  accommodate  higher-order uncertainty.  This  permits  us,  not  only  to  illustrate  the 
2:37:2290:14:14:71:545:490:12:Times:12:Times:A:broader  plausibility  of  the  notion  that  the  GE adjustment  may  be  weak  or  slow,  but  also  to 
2:38:2395:14:14:71:545:476:12:Times:12:Times:A:illustrate  the  sense  in  which  our  preferred  approach—the one  based  on  lack  of  common 
2:39:2491:14:14:72:546:462:12:Times:12:Times:A:knowledge—can  be  seen  as  a  disciplined  substitute  to  certain  kinds of  bounded  rationality.  We 
2:40:2596:14:14:72:546:448:12:Times:12:Times:A:finally discuss possible applications, including how our results may help reduce the gap between 
2:41:2692:14:14:72:546:434:12:Times:12:Times:A:the  macroeconomic  effects  of  interest  and  the  micro  or  local  effects  estimated in  a  growing

3:56:3034:0:26:56:158:724:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:C:1Introduction
3:57:3047:26:16:56:555:698:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:General	Equilibrium	(GE) mechanisms	are	key	to	the	interpretations	we, economists, develop	for	various	phenomena
3:58:3159:16:15:56:555:682:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:and	the	related	guidance	we	offer	to	policy	makers. In	some	contexts, such	mechanisms	reinforce	partial-equilibrium
3:59:3274:15:16:56:555:667:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:(PE) effects, acting	as	“macroeconomic	multipliers”	that	amplify	exogenous	shocks	or	increase	policy	effectiveness. In
3:60:3392:16:15:56:490:651:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:other	contexts, they	offset	PE effects, stabilizing	aggregate	outcomes	or	curtailing	policy	effectiveness.
3:61:3498:15:16:71:555:636:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:One	way	or	another, GE mechanisms	limit	the	usefulness	of	PE intuitions. For	instance, consider	the	popular	notion
3:62:3612:16:15:56:555:620:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:that	a	reduction	in	demand	can	trigger	a	recession. This	notion	may	appear	to	be	self-evident	from	a	PE perspective,
3:63:3728:15:15:56:430:605:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:yet	it	is	absent	in	the	neoclassical/RBC framework	because	of	countervailing	GE effects.
3:64:3816:15:16:71:555:590:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:GE mechanisms	also	limit	the	usefulness	of	a	growing	empirical	literature	that	seeks	to	quantify	the	causal	effects
3:65:3931:16:15:56:555:574:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:of	 aggregate	 shocks	 by	 exploiting	 the	 cross-sectional	 heterogeneity	 in	 the	 exposure	 to	 such	 shocks.   For	 instance,
3:66:4060:15:16:56:555:559:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:consider	 Mian	 and	 Sufi	 (2014), who	 offer	 compelling	 evidence	 that	 US regions	 that	 experienced	 steeper	 drops	 in
3:67:4184:16:15:56:555:543:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:consumer	credit	during	the	recent	recession	also	experienced	larger	employment	losses.  Although	it	is	tempting	to
3:68:4298:15:16:56:555:528:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:use	this	evidence	as	a	gauge	of	the	macroeconomic	impact	of	consumer	deleveraging, there	is	a	crucial	limitation:
3:69:4411:16:15:56:555:512:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:GE effects	such	as	the	adjustment	of	prices	and	income	at	the	national	level	are	absorbed	by	the	time	fixed	effect	in
3:70:4528:15:15:56:555:497:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:their	regressions. As	a	result, there	is	a	gap—of	unknown	magnitude	and	sign—between	the	“local”	or	“micro”	effects
3:71:4643:15:16:56:428:482:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:estimated	in	this	type	of	work	and	the	macroeconomic	effects	predicted	by	GE models.
3:72:4727:16:15:71:555:466:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:In	 this	 paper,  we	 re-evaluate	 the	 importance	 of	 GE mechanisms.   We	 argue	 that	 standard	 modeling	 practices
3:73:4846:15:16:56:555:451:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:overstate	their	potency	by	combining	a	strong	solution	concept	and	strong	informational	assumptions. We	formalize
3:74:4959:16:15:56:555:435:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:this	point	by	comparing	the	predictions	implied	by	this	combination	to	those	implied	by	certain	variants	of	it. All	but
3:75:5078:15:15:56:555:420:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:one	of	them	replace	Rational	Expectations	Equilibrium	(REE) with	solution	concepts	that	can	be	thought	of	as	different
3:76:5196:15:16:56:555:405:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:forms	of	“bounded	rationality.” Our	preferred	alternative	maintains	REE but	removes	common	knowledge	of	aggregate
3:77:5309:16:15:56:469:389:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:shocks	and	accommodates	higher-order	uncertainty	(i.e., uncertainty	about	the	beliefs	of	others).
3:78:5406:15:16:71:427:374:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:This	multifaceted	approach	serves	two	goals: one	applied	and	one	methodological.
3:79:5486:16:15:71:555:358:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:On	the	applied	front, we	offer	different	but	complementary	justifications	for	why	GE adjustment	may	be	“weaker”
3:80:5597:15:16:56:555:343:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:or	“slower”	than	previously	considered. In	settings	in	which	GE effects	amplify	PE effects, the	GE attenuation manifests
3:81:5717:16:15:56:555:327:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:as	under-reaction	and	inertia	at	the	aggregate	level. In	settings	in	which, instead, GE effects	offset	PE effects, it	manifests
3:82:5844:15:15:56:555:312:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:as	over-reaction	and	overshooting.  In	either	case, because	the	underlying	decision	rules	and	the	relevant	PE effects
3:83:5961:15:16:56:443:297:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f4:B:remain	unchanged, the	gap	between	the	relevantmicroandmacroelasticities	is	reduced.1
3:84:6045:16:15:71:555:281:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:On	 the	 methodological	 front,  we	 connect	 three	 strands	 of	 the	 literature:  the	 applied	 literature	 on	 incomplete
3:85:6169:15:16:56:555:266:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:information	and	higher-order	uncertainty;2an	older	tradition	that	used	Tâtonnement	or	Cobweb	dynamics	to	capture
3:86:6281:16:15:56:555:250:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:theoff-equilibriumadjustment	of	prices	in	Walrasian	economies; and	a	more	recent	literature	in	macroeconomics	that
3:87:6395:15:16:56:555:235:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:departs	from	the	REE concept.3We	are	thus	able	to	demonstrate	the	capacity	of	different	modeling	approaches	in
3:88:6505:16:15:56:555:219:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:terms	of	attenuating	or	slowing	GE adjustments; we	also	explain	the	sense	in	which	lack	of	common	knowledge	can
3:89:6616:15:15:56:283:204:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f4:B:be	seen	as	a	useful	substitute	to	bounded	rationality.4
3:90:6671:15:16:71:555:189:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f4:A:Framework.We	consider	an	elementary	Walrasian	economy, featuring	decentralized	and	sequential	trading. There
3:91:6779:16:15:56:555:173:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:is	a	large	number	of	“marketplaces,” which	define	the	boundaries	of	market	interactions:  every	agent	can	trade	in	a
3:92:6895:15:16:56:520:158:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:single	marketplace	in	each	period, but	may	randomly	move	from	one	marketplace	to	another	as	time	passes.
3:93:6999:16:12:67:554:142:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:1Throughout, the	term	“elasticity”	refers	to	the	response	of	anequilibriumoutcome	to	anexogenousshock. In	dynamic	settings, the	corresponding
3:94:7140:12:7:56:517:130:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:concept	is	an	impulse	response	function. Also, “micro”	refers	to	the	level	of	a	market	or	a	region, “macro”	to	the	level	of	the	economy.

4:102:8235:0:15:56:555:709:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:that	agents	care, but	are	uncertain, about	the	behavior	of	agents	they	do	not	currently	trade	with.5These	assumptions
4:103:8352:15:15:56:554:694:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:also	help	us	draw	a	clear	line	betweenpartialandgeneralequilibrium: the	former	refers	to	the	adjustment	of	a	single
4:104:8467:15:16:56:517:679:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:marketplace	in	isolation	of	the	rest	of	the	economy, the	latter	to	the	joint	adjustment	of	all	the	marketplaces.
4:105:8579:16:15:71:555:663:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Starting	 from	 a	 status	 quo, we	 let	 an	 exogenous	 shock	 change	 the	 economy’s	 fundamentals	 (preferences, tech-
4:106:8699:15:16:56:555:648:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:nologies, and	endowments)	and	ask	how	its	outcomes	(quantities	and	prices)	adjust	to	the	shock.  The	answer	to	this
4:107:8814:16:15:56:555:632:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:question	depends	on	two	sets	of	assumptions.  The	first	governs	how	the	shock	impacts	the	demand, the	supply, and
4:108:8927:15:16:56:555:617:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	market-clearing	outcomes	in	any	given	marketplace, taking	as	given	the	local	perceptions	of	the	behavior	and	the
4:109:9043:16:15:56:506:601:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:prices	inothermarketplaces. The	second	specifies	how	these	perceptions	themselves	adjust	to	the	shock.
4:110:9145:15:15:71:555:586:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:In	our	analysis, we	fix	the	first	set	of	assumptions	in	line	with	standard	modeling	practice, but	modify	the	second
4:111:9260:15:16:56:551:571:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:set. In	so	doing, we	are	able	to	vary	the	potency	of	the	GE effects	of	the	shock, while	holding	constant	its	PE effects.
4:112:9380:16:15:71:554:555:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f4:A:Frictionless	Benchmark.In	the	vast	majority	of	applied	work,6the	relevant	set	of	assumptions	is	(i)	rational	expec-
4:113:9495:15:16:56:555:540:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:tations	and	(ii)	common	knowledge	of	the	state	of	the	economy. This	combination	defines	our	frictionless	benchmark.
4:114:9610:16:15:71:555:524:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Our	benchmark	predicts	certainmicroandmacroelasticities, which	serve	as	reference	points	in	our	subsequent
4:115:9716:15:15:56:555:509:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:analysis.  The	macro	elasticity	measures	the	total	effect	of	an	aggregate	shock	on	an	aggregate	outcome.  The	micro
4:116:9831:15:16:56:555:494:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:elasticity	measures	the	total	effect	of	a	local	shock	on	the	outcome	of	a	single	marketplace	or, equivalently, the	PE
4:117:9948:16:15:56:555:478:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:effect	of	the	aggregate	shock. The	gap	between	the	two	elasticities	encapsulates	the	GE effect	of	the	aggregate	shock.
4:118:10066:15:16:71:555:463:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Our	benchmark	also	has	the	following	property: it	replicates	the	outcomes	of	an	Arrow-Debreu	variant	that	allows
4:119:10178:16:15:56:555:447:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	agents	to	trade	a	complete	set	of	date-	and	state-continent	securities	in	a	single	centralized	market	that	operates
4:120:10297:15:16:56:555:432:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:once, at	the	beginning	of	time. Although	not	strictly	needed	for	our	purposes, this	property	is	useful	for	three	reasons.
4:121:10418:16:15:56:555:416:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:First, it	clarifies	that	our	choice	to	let	trading	be	sequential	and	decentralized	does	not	introduce	a	frictionby	itself.
4:122:10540:15:15:56:555:401:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Second, it	relates	the	conjectures	that	the	agents	form	in	our	setting	to	the	prices	they	observe	in	the	Arrow-Debreu
4:123:10657:15:16:56:555:386:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:variant. Finally, it	sharpens	the	sense	in	which	the	GE adjustment	is	“perfect”	and	“instantaneous”	in	our	benchmark.
4:124:10774:16:15:71:555:370:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:All	the	considered	modifications	seek	to	relax	this	kind	of	perfection	in	the	GE adjustment	to	the	aggregate	shock.
4:125:10889:15:16:56:555:355:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:This	is	achieved	by	dropping	either	(i)	rational	expectations	or	(ii)	the	assumption	that	the	shock	is	common	knowledge.
4:126:11009:16:15:71:555:339:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f4:A:Tâtonnement.In	the	first	modification, we	model	the	agent’s	conjecture	about	the	likely	GE effects	of	the	shock	as
4:127:11123:15:16:56:555:324:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	product	of	an	algorithm	that	mimics	Tâtonnement	dynamics. We	choose	this	starting	point	because	Tâtonnement
4:128:11234:16:15:56:555:308:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:dynamics	was	traditionally	meant	to	capture	the	process	of	adjustment	from	one	equilibrium	point	to	another. Unlike
4:129:11349:15:15:56:555:293:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	textbook	version	of	this	concept, however, there	is	no	actual	dynamics: we	only	model	a	cognitive	process	through
4:130:11466:15:16:56:555:278:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:which	each	agent	forms	conjectures	about	market	outcomes	she	does	not	directly	observe.  This	process	mimics	a
4:131:11576:16:15:56:555:262:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Walrasian	auctioneer	who	bases	an	initial	conjecture	on	the	pre-shock	equilibrium	point,computes	the	implied	gap
4:132:11688:15:16:56:554:247:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:between	demand	and	supply,adjusts	the	relevant	conjecture	accordingly,and	iterates.  The	number	of	iterations	is
4:133:11800:16:15:56:260:231:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f4:B:interpreted	as	the	agent’s	“depth	of	reasoning.”7
4:134:11849:15:16:71:555:216:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:In	our	framework, this	cognitive	process	is	equivalent	to	iterating	on	a	contraction	mapping, whose	fixed	point	pins
4:135:11965:16:15:56:555:200:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:down	the	REE prices.  It	follows	that, in	the	limit	as	the	depth	of	the	process	becomes	infinite, the	post-shock	price
4:136:12083:15:15:56:555:185:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:conjectures	coincide	with	their	frictionless	counterparts. But	as	long	as	the	agents	are	“bounded	rational”	in	the	sense
4:137:12203:15:16:56:555:170:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:that	the	aforementioned	depth	is	finite, the	assumed	cognitive	process	generates	a	weaker	adjustment	in	the	relevant
4:138:12319:16:15:56:554:154:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:conjectures	than	rational	expectations	do. It	is	thereforeas	ifthe	GE spillovers	have	been	reduced. Indeed, in	the	limit
4:139:12439:15:16:56:555:139:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:that	corresponds	to	zero	cognitive	depth, the	macroeconomic	effect	of	the	shock	is	given	by	the	PE effect	alone: each
4:140:12556:16:15:56:402:123:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:marketplace	responds	to	the	aggregate	shockas	ifit	were	an	idiosyncratic	shock.
4:141:12635:15:13:67:555:108:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:5In	these	respects, our	modeling	strategy	borrows	from	the	literatures	on	decentralized	trading, the	search-theoretic	foundations	of	money, and
4:142:12778:13:9:56:555:95:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:OTC markets	(e.g., Kiyotaki	and	Wright,	1993;	Lagos	and	Wright,	2005;	Gale,	1986;	Golosov, Lorenzoni, and	Tsyvinski,	2014;	Duffie, Garleanu,
4:143:12918:9:7:56:316:86:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:and	Pedersen,	2005). Our	goals	and	our	contribution, however, are	distinct.
4:144:12993:7:10:67:555:79:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:6This	excludes	the	works	cited	in	the	sequel	and, more	generally, the	literatures	reviewed	in	Angeletos	and	Lian	(2016b)	and	Woodford	(2013).
4:145:13134:10:0:67:465:69:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:A:7This	terminology	evokes	game-theoretic	concepts	such	as	Level-k	Thinking. We	study	the	connection	in	the	sequel.
5:146:13377:0:15:56:555:709:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:relative	to	the	frictionless	benchmark.  Because	the	PE adjustment	that	takes	place	at	the	marketplace	level	remains
5:147:13493:15:15:56:555:694:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	same	as	in	that	benchmark, the	gap	between	the	micro	and	macro	elasticities	of	interest	is	reduced. The	caveat	is
5:148:13610:15:16:56:361:679:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:that, by	design, this	comes	at	the	cost	of	violating	rational	expectations.
5:149:13685:16:15:71:555:663:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f4:A:Lack	of	Common	Knowledge.In	the	second	modification, we	bypass	the	aforementioned	caveat	by	bringing	back
5:150:13790:15:16:56:555:648:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	rational	expectations	hypothesis. We	nevertheless	attenuate	the	GE adjustment	by	removing	common	knowledge
5:151:13900:16:15:56:555:632:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:of	 the	 underlying	 aggregate	 shock	 and	 of	 the	 reaction	 of	 the	 economy	 to	 it.  In	 particular, we	 preclude	 the	 agents
5:152:14031:15:16:56:555:617:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:from	observing	the	reaction	of	marketplaces	they	do	not	themselves	participate	in, and	we	let	them	observe	only	a
5:153:14144:16:15:56:555:601:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:noisy	 private	 signal	 of	 the	 underlying	 state	 of	 Nature.  This	 may	 capture	 dispersed	 private	 information	 as	 in	 Lucas
5:154:14275:15:15:56:555:586:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:(1972), Townsend	(1983), Morris	and	Shin	(2002), Morris	and	Shin	(2002)	and	a	large	tradition	in	macroeconomics
5:155:14386:15:16:56:555:571:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:and	finance.  But	it	can	also	be	a	representation	of	cognitive	constraints	as	in	Sims	(2003), Woodford	(2003,	2012),
5:156:14502:16:15:56:555:555:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Myatt	and	Wallace	(2012), Pavan	(2016)	and	Tirole	(2015), or	more	generally	of	“states	of	mind”	as	in	Harsanyi	(1967).
5:157:14620:15:16:71:555:540:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:While	 conceptually	 distinct, this	 setting	 is	 shown	 to	 have	 similar	 observable	 implications	 as	 the	 one	 described
5:158:14745:16:15:56:555:524:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:before. In	particular, for	any	depth	of	reasoning	in	the	Tâtonnement	setting, there	is	a	level	of	the	informational	friction
5:159:14869:15:15:56:555:509:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:in	the	new	setting	such	that	the	irrational	conjectures	in	the	former	are	recast	as	the	average	rational	expectations	in
5:160:14989:15:16:56:495:494:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	latter, and	the	two	economies	generate	the	same	observables	at	the	aggregate	level; and	vice	versa.
5:161:15092:16:15:71:555:478:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:We	conclude	that	lacking	common	knowledge	of	the	aggregate	shock	helps	rationalize	a	more	ad	hoc, and	old-
5:162:15198:15:16:56:555:463:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:fashioned, way	of	thinking	about	equilibrium	adjustments.  But	we	also	obtain	the	following	distinct	prediction:  the
5:163:15315:16:15:56:555:447:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:larger	the	GE effect	in	the	frictionless	benchmark, the	larger	the	fraction	of	this	effect	that	gets	“erased”	by	any	given
5:164:15437:15:16:56:555:432:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:level	of	informational	friction. In	this	regard, the	offered	remedy	to	the	disconnect	between	the	micro	and	the	macro
5:165:15554:16:15:56:555:416:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:elasticities	of	interest	appears	to	work	better	the	more	severe	the	disconnect	is	to	start	with. Last	but	not	least, we	show
5:166:15678:15:15:56:555:401:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:that	the	lack	of	common	knowledge	attenuates	GE effects	regardless	of	whether	they	reinforce	or	offset	PE effects—a
5:167:15793:15:16:56:454:386:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:prediction	that, as	discussed	in	the	sequel, not	shared	by	some	of	the	considered	alternatives.
5:168:15888:16:15:71:555:370:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:The	basic	insight	behind	these	findings	is	the	following.  Regardless	of	the	information	structure, rational	expec-
5:169:16003:15:16:56:555:355:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:tations	impose	a	fixed-point	relation	between	subjective	beliefs	and	actual	outcomes. But	once	agents	lack	common
5:170:16116:16:15:56:555:339:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:knowledge	of	the	innovations	in	the	underlying	fundamentals, this	fixed	point	is	pinned	down, not	only	by	what	the
5:171:16230:15:16:56:555:324:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:agents	 know	 about	 these	 innovations, but	 also	 by	 what	 they	 think	 that	 others	 know, and	 so	 on.  As	 one	 varies	 the
5:172:16359:16:15:56:454:308:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:degree	of	such	higher-order	knowledge, one	also	varies	the	potency	of	the	relevant	GE effect.
5:173:16452:15:15:71:555:293:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:The	key	lesson	can	be	recast	as	follows. The	rational	expectations	hypothesisalonedoes	not	nail	down	the	relevant
5:174:16565:15:16:56:555:278:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:GE effect; it	only	restricts	its	(absolute)	magnitude	within	an	interval. By	imposing	rational	expectationstogetherwith
5:175:16684:16:15:56:555:262:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:common	knowledge	of	the	shock, applied	modeling	practice	often	picks, perhaps	inadvertently, theupperbound	of
5:176:16793:15:16:56:555:247:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:this	interval. We	instead	show	how	one	can	span	theentireinterval. In	this	regard, we	complement	Bergemann	and
5:177:16903:16:15:56:555:231:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Morris	(2013), who	study	a	class	of	beauty-contest	games	under	arbitrary	information	structures; most	importantly, we
5:178:17020:15:16:56:504:216:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:explain	the	precise	sense	in	which	standard	practice	has	“overstated”	the	importance	of	GE mechanisms.
5:179:17122:16:15:71:554:200:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f4:A:Near-rationality, Level-k	Thinking, and	more.Not	all	forms	of	“bounded	rationality”	can	capture	the	sought-after
5:180:17234:15:15:56:555:185:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:notion	of	GE attenuation. For	example, adapting	the	near-rationality	concept	of	Akerlof	and	Yellen	(1985a), or	that	of
5:181:17352:15:16:56:555:170:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:theε-equilibrium	in	games, to	our	context	allows	the	GE effect	to	be	either	attenuated	or	amplified.  With	this	basic
5:182:17469:16:15:56:555:154:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:point	in	mind, we	investigate	whether	GE attenuation	is	predicted	by	four	other	non-REE solution	concepts. The	first
5:183:17585:15:16:56:555:139:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:mimics	Cobweb	dynamics.  The	 second	 mimics	 Level-k	Thinking	 (Nagel,	 1995, Stahl	 and	Wilson,	 1995, Farhi	and
5:184:17699:16:15:56:555:123:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Werning,	2017). The	third	considers	Reflective	Equilibrium	(Garcıa-Schmidt	and	Woodford,	2015). The	fourth	allows
5:185:17812:15:15:56:403:108:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:for	a	form	of	“cognitive	discounting”	similar	to	that	featured	in	Gabaix	(2016a,b).
5:186:17895:15:16:71:555:93:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:The	variants	based	on	Cobweb	dynamics	and	Level-k	Thinking	are	closely	related	to	one	another, in	a	manner	that
5:187:18006:16:15:56:555:77:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:resembles	the	aforementioned	tight	relation	between	the	Tâtonnement	and	incomplete-information	variants. Yet, they
5:188:18120:15:0:56:365:62:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:arenotalways	able	to	capture	the	sought-after	notion	of	GE attenuation.
6:189:18308:0:15:56:555:709:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:which	agents	compete	for	fixed	resources; these	environments	are	akin	to	games	of	strategic	substitutability.  In	such
6:190:18426:15:15:56:555:694:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:B:environments, Cobweb	dynamics	and	Level-k	Thinking	allow	the	relevant	price	or	quantity	conjectures	toovershoot
6:191:18537:15:16:56:555:679:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:relative	to	the	frictionless	benchmark:  every	agent	may	expect	the	others	to	reactmore	stronglyto	the	shock	than	in

6:193:18762:15:16:71:555:648:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:This	prediction	appears	problematic, not	only	because	it	is	counterintuitive, but	it	also	contradicts	the	“competition
6:194:18880:16:15:56:555:632:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:neglect”	phenomenon	documented	in	the	behavioral-economics	literature	(Camerer	and	Lovallo,	1999;	Kahneman,
6:195:18987:15:16:56:555:617:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:2011).   This	 problem	 is	 avoided	 by	 our	 incomplete-information	 variant,  as	 well	 as	 by	 “Reflective	 Equilibrium”,  a
6:196:19114:16:15:56:555:601:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:solution	concept	developed	in	Garcıa-Schmidt	and	Woodford	(2015). This	concept	is	grounded	on	Level-k	Thinking.
6:197:19225:15:15:56:555:586:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:But	it	also	features	a	certain	twist, which	eliminates	the	aforementioned	overshooting	and	guarantees	that	the	relevant
6:198:19344:15:16:56:463:571:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:conjectures	behave	similarly	to	those	in	our	Tâtonnement	and	incomplete-information	variants.
6:199:19437:16:15:71:555:555:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Finally, consider	 the	 kind	 of	 “cognitive	 discounting”	 found	 in	 Gabaix	 (2016a,b)	 or	 the	 related	 belief	 distortion
6:200:19563:15:16:56:555:540:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:assumed	in	Greenwood	and	Hanson	(2015).  These	approaches	can	accommodate	GE attenuation, but	are	flexible
6:201:19669:16:15:56:555:524:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:enough	to	accommodate	the	exact	opposite	as	well: it	depends	on	whether	the	agents	are	assumed	to	err	systematically
6:202:19785:15:15:56:555:509:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:in	the	direction	of	believing	that	the	other	agents	reactless,ormore, than	what	they	actually	do. For	better	or	worse,
6:203:19903:15:16:56:533:494:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:such	flexibility	is	not	allowed	by	the	alternative	approach	that	maintains	REE and	adds	higher-order	uncertainty.
6:204:20016:16:15:71:555:478:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f4:A:Dynamic	Extension.The	aforementioned	results	help	formalize	the	notion	that	GE adjustment	is	“weak”, but	allow
6:205:20126:15:16:56:555:463:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:it	to	be	as	“instantaneous”	as	in	the	Arrow-Debreu	paradigm. In	an	extension, we	capture	the	complementary	notion
6:206:20239:16:15:56:555:447:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:that GE adjustment	“takes	time”	by	allowing	the	relevant	conjectures	to	adjust	slowly	from	the	pre-shock	frictionless
6:207:20356:15:16:56:555:432:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:level	 to	 the	 post-shock	 one.   In	 the	 variants	 that	 drop	 rational	 expectations,  this	 requires	 the	 ad	 hoc	 assumption
6:208:20487:16:15:56:555:416:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:that	the	“depth	of	reasoning”	increases	with	the	time	lag	since	the	shock	has	hit	the	economy.  In	the	variant	with
6:209:20602:15:15:56:555:401:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:lack	of	common	knowledge, instead, it	obtains	naturally	from	the	property	that	beliefs	converge	to	their	frictionless
6:210:20719:15:16:56:286:386:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:counterparts	as	agents	observe	past	market	outcomes.
6:211:20771:16:15:71:555:370:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f4:A:Take-home	Lessons.The	 combination	 of	 our	 results	 demonstrates	 that	 GE attenuation	 is	 arobustprediction	 of
6:212:20886:15:16:56:555:355:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:either	certain	forms	of	bounded	rationality	or	lack	of	common	knowledge	of	the	state	of	the	economy. In	this	regard,
6:213:21002:16:15:56:399:339:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	two	methodological	approaches	appear	to	be	close	substitutes	to	each	other.
6:214:21081:15:16:71:555:324:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Nevertheless, some	of	the	considered	forms	of	bounded	rationality	leave	open	the	door	to	the	opposite	prediction.
6:215:21194:16:15:56:555:308:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Furthermore, they	all	face	certain	conceptual	and	practical	challenges.  The	most	obvious	one	is	the	vulnerability	to
6:216:21311:15:15:56:555:293:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Lucas’s	critique. Another	one	is	the	aforementioned	question	of	why	the	depth	of	reasoning	may, or	may	not, increase
6:217:21427:15:16:56:555:278:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:with	time. For	related	reasons, these	variants	have	difficulty	in	accommodating	the	notion	that	GE adjustment	“takes
6:218:21543:16:15:56:555:262:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:time”	in	stationary	environments	with	recurring	shocks: doing	so	would	have	required	that	the	agents	be swallow	or
6:219:21657:15:16:56:482:247:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:myopic	thinkers	vis-a-vis	recent	shocks	and, at	the	same	time, be	deep	thinkers	vis-a-vis	old	shocks.
6:220:21758:16:15:71:555:231:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:In	our	view, these	observations	tilt	the	balance	in	favor	of	the	methodological	approach	that	maintains	rational
6:221:21870:15:16:56:555:216:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:expectations, removes	common	knowledge	of	the	state	of	the	economy, and	relates	GE attenuation	to	higher-order
6:222:21980:16:15:56:555:200:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:uncertainty. That	said, since	both	informational	and	behavioral	frictions	seem	empirically	relevant, we	find	it	reassuring
6:223:22102:15:15:56:550:185:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:for	our	purposes	that	the	two	kinds	of	friction	can	complement	each	other	in	the	direction	of	attenuating	GE effects.
6:224:22219:15:16:71:555:170:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f4:A:Applications.Our	framework	is	too	abstract	to	permit	a	careful	consideration	of	any	particular	application.  We
6:225:22330:16:15:56:555:154:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:consider	this	to	be	a	strength, for	it	allows	us	to	deliver	the	key	insights	in	a	flexible	manner	and	to	connect	to	various
6:226:22453:15:16:56:555:139:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:strands	of	the	literature.  We	study	a	few	applications	in	companion	work, aiming	to	shed	new	light	on	the	sources

7:246:24731:15:16:56:555:458:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:alternatives. Last	but	not	least, we	offer	this	attenuation	as	a	potential	remedy	to	the	gap	between	the	macro	effects	of
7:247:24852:16:15:56:555:442:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:interest	and	the	kind	of	local	elasticities	estimated	in, inter	alia, Mian	and	Sufi	(2012,	2014), Nakamura	and	Steinsson

7:251:25263:15:16:56:555:381:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:studies	a	class	of	games	and	focuses	on	the	volatility	and	the	dispersion	of	actions	as	the	observables	of	interest. We
7:252:25382:16:15:56:555:365:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:instead	study	a	Walrasian	economy	and	focus	on	certain	elasticities	(or	IRFs), which	are	relevant	either	vis-a-vis	the
7:253:25500:15:15:56:555:350:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:aforementioned	empirical	literature	or	for	policy	counterfactuals.  We	also	develop	a	framework	that	is	better	suited
7:254:25617:15:16:56:354:335:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:for	defining, and	studying, the	notion	of	weak	or	slow	GE adjustment.
7:255:25686:16:15:71:555:319:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:By	modeling	the	economy	as	a	collection	of	segmented	markets	and	by	letting, in	our	preferred	variant, agents	form

7:257:25915:16:15:56:555:288:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:a	setting	in	which	there	are	general-equilibrium	spillovers	across	the	different	“islands.” This	means	that	the	economy
7:258:26034:15:16:56:555:273:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:is	akin	to	a	game, in	which	the	behavior	of	each	agent	critically	depends	on	her	conjectures	about	the	behavior	of
7:259:26148:16:15:56:555:257:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:others. These	conjectures—and	the	associated	higher-order	beliefs—play	a	central	role	in	our	analysis, as	they	do	in
7:260:26264:15:15:56:535:242:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	literature	that	has	followed	Morris	and	Shin	(1998,	2002,	2003), whereas	they	are	irrelevant	in	Lucas	(1972).
7:261:26377:15:16:71:555:227:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:By	allowing	current	markets	to	clear	under	possibly	arbitrary	conjectures	of	future	prices, our	partial-equilibrium
7:262:26492:16:15:56:555:211:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:analysis	resembles	the	“temporary	equilibrium”	of	Grandmont	(1977); some	subtle	differences	are	explained	in	due
7:263:26604:15:16:56:555:196:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:course. By	allowing	the	aforementioned	conjectures	to	depart	from	their	REE counterparts, we	then	connect	to	Gues-

7:265:26831:15:16:56:555:165:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:(2013). These	works	are	concerned	primarily	with	the	question	of	whether	the	set	of	REE outcomes	can	be	obtained	as
7:266:26946:16:15:56:555:149:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	limit	of	certain	eductive	or	learning	procedures. Our	paper	bypasses	this	question—by	working	with	a	framework
7:267:27060:15:15:56:482:134:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:in	which	the	REE is	the	solution	to	a	contraction	mapping—and	shifts	the	focus	to	a	different	theme.
7:268:27160:15:16:71:555:119:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:By	touching	on	the	relation	between	micro	and	macro	effects, our	paper	may	appear	to	relate	to	the	debate	on
7:269:27268:16:15:56:555:103:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:whether	 micro	 rigidity	 implies	 macro	 rigidity	 (Caplin	 and	 Spulber,	 1987;	 Caballero	 and	 Engel,	 1999;	 Golosov	 and
7:270:27394:15:16:56:555:88:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Lucas,	2007), or	the	debate	on	the	elasticity	of	labor	supply	(Chetty	et al.,	2011,	2013;	Keane	and	Rogerson,	2012).
7:271:27510:16:12:67:554:72:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:8Related	is	also	the	literature	on	rational	inattention	(Sims	2003;	Mackowiak	and	Wiederholt	2009;	Myatt	and	Wallace	2012;	Pavan	2016), but
7:272:27649:12:0:56:542:60:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:F:onlyinsofar	as	rational	inattention	ends	up	introducing	higher-order	uncertainty	(i.e., uncertainty	about	the	beliefs	and	the	behavior	of	others).
8:273:27918:0:15:56:555:709:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:of	PE effects	in	settings	with	rich	heterogeneity	and	non-linearity	in	these	effects. The	latter	is	about	the	calibration	of
8:274:28042:15:15:56:481:694:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	key	preference	parameter	that	determines	the	PE response	of	labor	supply	to	variation	in	wages.
8:275:28141:15:16:71:555:679:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:The	documented	mechanism	is	also	distinct—conceptuallyandempirically—from	adjustment	costs, habit, “stick-

8:277:28366:15:16:56:555:648:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:frictions	ought	to	manifest	in	the	response	of	individual	choices	to	idiosyncratic	shocks. By	contrast, our	mechanism
8:278:28483:16:15:56:474:632:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f4:B:modifies	the	macro-level	responses	while	holding	constant	the	underlying	micro-level	responses.9

8:280:28690:16:15:56:555:601:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:shocks: it	depends	on	whether	the	GE effects	amplify	or	offset	the	PE effects. Our	work	therefore	provides	a	theory	of
8:281:28808:15:15:56:555:586:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	attenuation	of	equilibrium	interactions, not	a	theory	of	inertia	or	status-quo	bias	per	se.  By	the	same	token, our
8:282:28927:15:16:56:555:571:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:works	builds	a	bridge	from	the	macroeconomic	literature	on	higher-order	uncertainty	to	the	behavioral	literature	on

8:284:29136:40:26:56:148:515:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:C:3  Framework
8:285:29148:26:16:56:555:489:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:In	 this	 section, we	 introduce	 our	 baseline	 framework.  We	 first	 spell	 out	 the	 micro-foundations	 of	 the	 framework,
8:286:29275:16:15:56:555:473:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:namely	the	market	structure	and	the	specification	of	preferences, technologies, and	endowments. We	next	derive	the
8:287:29389:15:16:56:555:458:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:associated	demand	and	supply	functions, which	are	the	building	blocks	of	our	analysis. For	reasons	of	tractability, we
8:288:29507:16:33:56:353:442:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:thereafter	work	with	the	log-linearized	demand	and	supply	functions.
8:289:29575:33:23:56:285:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:C:3.1  Marketplaces, Relocation, and	Trading
8:290:29617:23:15:56:555:386:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Economic	decisions	take	place	over	two	periods, which	we	call	“morning”	and	“afternoon”; these	can	be	thought	of
8:291:29729:15:16:56:555:371:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:as	proxies	for	“present”	and	“future”	in	setting	with	more	than	two	periods, such	as	the	one	we	consider	in	Section	8.
8:292:29847:16:15:56:554:355:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:There	is	a	double	continuum	of	firms	and	households, each	indexed	byi2[0;1]-[0;1];and	three	goods. One	good
8:293:29954:15:16:56:555:340:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:is	storable	and	can	be	used	for	consumption	and/or	production	in	both	periods. Possible	examples	include	land	and
8:294:30067:16:15:56:555:324:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:capital, or	leisure	as	in	Lagos	and	Wright	(2005). We	let	this	good	serve	as	the	numeraire. The	remaining	two	goods,
8:295:30183:15:15:56:554:309:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:which	we	call	the	“morning	good”	and	the	“afternoon	good”, are	produced	and	consumed	in	the	respective	periods.
8:296:30294:15:16:71:555:294:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:In	each	period, trade	takes	place	in	a	continuum	of	segmented	locations, which	we	call	“marketplaces”	and	index
8:297:30405:16:15:56:554:278:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:bym2[0;1]:Each	marketplace	operates	two	markets:  one	in	the	morning, where	the	morning	good	is	traded	with
8:298:30512:15:16:56:555:263:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	numeraire; and	another	in	the	afternoon, where	the	afternoon	good	is	traded	with	the	numeraire. In	each	period,
8:299:30627:16:15:56:555:247:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:an	agent	can	trade	only	in	the	marketplace	she	is	currently	in. As	time	passes, agents	can	move	from	one	marketplace
8:300:30743:15:15:56:555:232:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:to	another: after	the	morning	markets	have	closed	but	before	the	afternoon	ones	have	opened, each	agent	receives	an
8:301:30858:15:16:56:555:217:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:idiosyncratic	shock	that	determines	whether	she	stays	in	her	original	marketplace	or	whether	she	gets	relocated	to	a
8:302:30974:16:15:56:555:201:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f8:B:different	marketplace. The	probability	of	an	agent’s	staying	in	her	original	marketplace	in	the	“afternoon”	is-2[0;1)
8:303:31091:15:16:56:484:186:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:and	that	of	relocating	is1--:Conditional	on	reallocation, all	other	marketplaces	are	equally	likely.
8:304:31191:16:15:71:555:170:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:These	 assumptions	 are	 illustrated	 in	 Figure	 1.  The	 marketplaces	 are	 represented	 by	 the	 boxes	 in	 the	 figure.  In
8:305:31318:15:16:56:555:155:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	morning, an	equal	mass	of	agents	is	located	to	each	of	the	marketplaces.  After	the	morning	market	has	cleared,
8:306:31433:16:15:56:555:139:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:relocation	takes	places: while	a	fraction-2[0;1)of	the	agents	from	each	marketplace	stay	put, the	remaining	fraction
8:307:31549:15:15:56:555:124:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:is	randomly	relocated	to	all	other	marketplaces. In	the	afternoon, each	marketplace	is	therefore	populated	by	two	types
8:308:31668:15:16:56:554:109:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:of	agents: a	mass-of	the	agents	that	were	originally	located	in	that	market; and	a	representative	sample	of	the	agents
8:309:31786:16:15:56:555:93:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:that	where	originally	spread	in	the	rest	of	the	economy.  As	mentioned	in	the	Introduction, these	stark	assumptions
8:310:31901:15:13:67:554:78:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:9Avariant	of	this	point	appears	in	Angeletos	and	Lian	(2016a)	in	the	following	form: lack	of	common	knowledge	helps	rationalizes	a	“discounted”

9:316:32227:33:15:56:555:530:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:help	capture	two	realistic	features: that	agents	participate	in	a	limited	number	of	markets	at	any	given	point	of	time;
9:317:32346:15:16:56:555:515:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:and	that	agents	nevertheless	care	about	what’s	going	on	in	the	rest	of	the	economy	because	this	affects	their	future
9:318:32462:16:15:56:322:499:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:trading	opportunities	and	thereby	also	their	current	incentives.
9:319:32526:15:16:71:555:484:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:The	“fundamental,” meaning	an	exogenous	variable	that	affects	preferences, technologies	and	endowments, differs
9:320:32637:16:15:56:555:468:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:across	 agents.  The	 initial	 distribution	 of	 agents	 is	 such	 that	 every	 marketplace	 receives	 equal	 masses	 of	 firms	 and
9:321:32769:15:15:56:555:453:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:households, but	these	masses	arenotrepresentative	samples	of	the	entire	population.  This	is	illustrated	in	the	figure
9:322:32887:15:16:56:555:438:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:by	the	fact	that	different	boxes	contain	agents	of	different	color. Note	that, whether	they	relocate	or	not, agents	maintain
9:323:33011:16:15:56:555:422:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:their	original	“color”	(their	preferences, technologies, and	endowments). It	follows	that	the	average	fundamental	in	a
9:324:33129:15:16:56:512:407:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:marketplace	changes	over	time	because, and	only	because, of	the	reshuffling	in	the	composition	of	agents.
9:325:33234:16:15:71:555:391:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Without	serious	loss	of	generality, we	finally	assume	that	the	original	participants	of	any	given	marketplace	share
9:326:33349:15:15:56:555:376:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	same	preferences, technologies	and	endowments. (In	the	figure, each	box	starts	with	agents	that	have	exactly	the
9:327:33465:15:16:56:555:361:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:same	color, as	opposed	to	having	different	shades	of	the	same	color.) This	assumption	lets	us	equate	the	idiosyncratic
9:328:33583:16:15:56:555:345:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:fundamental	of	any	given	agent	with	the	average	fundamental	of	the	marketplace	in	which	that	agent	participates	during
9:329:33701:15:16:56:554:330:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	morning.  With	this	in	mind, we	henceforth	let-m2Rdenote	the	fundamental	of	the	agents	who	participate	in
9:330:33810:16:15:56:533:314:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:marketplacemduring	the	morning	(Think	of	cross-sectional	variation	in-mas	the	different	colors	in	the	figure.)
9:331:33920:15:16:71:554:299:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:A:Remark.Marketplaces	do	not	have	to	coincide	with	geographic	regions. Accordingly, the	assumption	that	agents
9:332:34028:16:15:56:555:283:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:move	from	one	marketplace	to	another	should	not	be	interpreted	as	physical	mobility.  Instead, as	in	other	works	on
9:333:34143:15:15:56:554:268:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:decentralized	trading,10this	assumption	is	only	meant	to	capture	the	fact	that	every	agent	typically	trades	with	different
9:334:34265:15:16:56:555:253:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:sets	of	other	agents	at	different	points	of	time. That	said, when	seeking	to	map	the	theory	to	the	data, it	seems	plausible
9:335:34388:16:15:56:555:237:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:to	assume	that	agents	who	are	closer	to	each	other	in	terms	of	geographic	distance	aremorelikely	to	participate	in	the
9:336:34506:15:16:56:555:222:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:same	markets	than	agents	that	are	further	away	from	each	other.  We	use	this	assumption	in	Appendix	A—and	only
9:337:34616:16:33:56:528:206:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:there—so	as	to	relate	our	theoretical	contribution	to	the	empirical	literature	we	mentioned	in	the	introduction.

9:340:34891:15:16:56:555:135:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:of	each	household. For	our	purposes, these	details	are	relevant	only	insofar	as	they	micro-found	the	demand	and	the

18:796:63520:23:15:56:555:485:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:B:Remark	1.In	general, the	distinction	between	PE and	GE can	be	blurry. This	is	due	to	the	intrinsic	ambiguity	of	what
18:797:63636:15:16:56:555:470:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:“partial	equilibrium”	means: this	notion	permits	the	analyst	to	hold	constantsomeof	the	endogenous	outcomes	of	a
18:798:63748:16:15:56:555:454:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:model, but	does	not	tell	the	analystwhichoutcomes	to	hold	constant	and	which	ones	to	let	adjust.  Our	framework
18:799:63859:15:16:56:555:439:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:seeks	to	offer	some	guidance	on	how	one	may	approach	this	delicate	choice	in	applications	by	tying	the	PE effect
18:800:63971:16:15:56:555:423:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:with	the	equilibrium	adjustment	that	takes	place	in	markets	that	the	agents	currently	participate	in	(equivalently, with
18:801:64091:15:15:56:555:408:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	response	of	prices	and	quantities	that	the	agents	can	observe)	and	the	GE effect	with	additional	adjustment	that
18:802:64207:15:16:56:555:393:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:operates	through	more	“remote”	market	interactions	(“remote”	could	refer	to	distance	in	terms	of	geography, time,
18:803:64320:16:15:56:555:377:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:or	knowledge).  Having	said	that, these	ideas	can	be	made	sufficiently	concrete	only	once	one	commits	to	a	specific
18:804:64435:15:16:56:252:362:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:application; see	Section	9 for	some	examples.
18:805:64480:16:15:71:554:346:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:A:Remark	2.If	one	takes	the	view	that	any	given	agent	can	engage	in	asinglemarket	interaction	at	any	given	instant
18:806:64592:15:15:56:555:331:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:of	time, then	all	GE effects	are	of	a	dynamic	nature	and	are	tied	to	expectations. This	perspective	explains	our	choice	to
18:807:64714:15:16:56:555:316:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:equate	the	GE effects	that	operate	across	marketplaces	to	a	certain	kind	of	expectations. But	as	we	have	just	illustrated,
18:808:64836:16:15:56:555:300:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:these	expectations	need	not	play	an	essential	role	under	the	frictionless	benchmark:  in	that	benchmark, it	isas	ifall
18:809:64954:15:16:56:469:285:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:interactions	happen	at	once, in	which	case	expectations	are	inactive	and	all	GE effects	are	static.
18:810:65053:16:15:71:555:269:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:A:Remark	3.Our	frictionless	benchmark	is	akin	to	assuming	that	all	agents	can	get	together	in	the	same	room	and
18:811:65162:15:16:56:555:254:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:canperfectlyandinstantaneouslycoordinate	both	their	current	and	their	future	reaction	to	the	underlying	aggregate
18:812:65275:16:15:56:555:238:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:shock. Here, this	point	was	formalized	by	showing	that	our	benchmark	attains	the	same	outcomes	as	an	Arrow-Debreu
18:813:65388:15:15:56:555:223:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:variant	that	leaves	no	room	for	either	dynamics	or	expectations.  Later	on, we	will	further	corroborate	the	same	idea
18:814:65505:15:16:56:555:208:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:by	showing	that	our	frictionless	benchmark	is	akin	to	a	static, complete-information, game	in	which	players	face	no
18:815:65620:16:15:56:484:192:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:uncertainty	about	one	another’s	actions. This	limitation	is	endemic	to	the	Arrow-Debreu	framework.
18:816:65718:15:16:71:554:177:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:A:Remark	 4.The	 modeling	 practice	 in	 applied	 work	 in	 macroeconomics,  finance,  structural	 IO,	 and	 elsewhere
18:817:65834:16:15:56:555:161:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:customarily	departs	from	the	Arrow-Debreu	framework	by	allowing	for	monopoly	power, financial	frictions, and	the
18:818:65946:15:16:56:555:146:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:like.  Yet, by	 imposing	 the	 REE concept	 along	 with	 common	 knowledge	 of	 aggregate	 (economy-	 or	 industry-wide)
18:819:66066:16:15:56:555:130:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:shocks, the	vast	majority	of	such	work	preserves	the	aforementioned	kind	of	frictionless	coordination	in	the	adjustment
18:820:66185:15:15:56:555:115:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:of	beliefs, quantities, and	prices	to	such	shocks. By	contrast, what	we	are	after	in	this	paper	is	precisely	the	introduction
18:821:66310:15:16:56:555:100:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:of	a	certain	friction	in	this	kind	of	adjustment, a	friction	that	can	be	interpreted	as	attenuating	the	relevant	GE effects.
18:822:66434:16:15:71:555:84:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:A:Remark	5.It	is	often	appealing	to	abstract	from	the	fact	that	most	real-world	trading	is	sequential	and, instead,
18:823:66547:15:0:56:555:69:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:represent	the	economy	with	a	static	model. In	such	models, one	can	still	tie	GE effects	to	expectations	by	letting	each
19:824:66785:0:15:56:555:709:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:of	other	shelves. Think	of	this	as	a	“big	family”	or	a	“team	problem”: every	member	of	the	family/team	makes	a	choice
19:825:66902:15:15:56:549:694:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f4:B:that	contributes	towards	a	common	goal, without	necessarily	having	knowledge	of	the	choices	of	other	members.16
19:826:67013:15:16:71:555:679:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:A:Remark	 6.When	 an	 analyst	 uses	 a	 model	 to	 form	 predictions	 about	 the	 response	 of	 economic	 outcomes	 to
19:827:67129:16:15:56:555:663:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:preference	and	technology	shocks	or	to	policy	changes, she	is	of	course	aware	that	these	predictions	are	sensitive	to
19:828:67246:15:16:56:555:648:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	assumptions	made.  This	sensitivity	is	not	terribly	bothering	if	the	predictions	are	“unbiased”	in	the	sense	that	a
19:829:67365:16:15:56:555:632:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:perturbation	of	the	underlying	assumptions	can	change	the	predictions	in	either	direction. As	an	example, consider	the
19:830:67483:15:16:56:555:617:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:predictions	made	by	assuming	a	Cobb-Douglas	utility	and	production	function; these	predictions	are	in	the	“middle”	of
19:831:67600:16:15:56:555:601:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	set	of	the	predictions	that	obtain	with	a	relaxed, CES,	specification	for	preferences	and	technologies. Unfortunately,
19:832:67722:15:15:56:555:586:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:this	is	not	the	case	with	the	assumption	of	common	knowledge:  we	will	show	that	the	predictions	that	are	made	on
19:833:67835:15:16:56:555:571:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	basis	of	this	assumption	are	“biased”	in	the	sense	that	they	necessarily	overstate	the	relevant	GE effect	relative	to
19:834:67956:16:40:56:318:555:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	alternative	of	allowing	for	imperfect	common	knowledge.

19:840:68504:15:15:56:555:427:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:dynamics; instead, we	are	merely	replacing	rational	expectations	with	anotherinstantaneouscognitive	process, which
19:841:68618:15:16:56:506:412:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:happens	to	be	defined	by	the	solution	to	a	certain	differential	equation	as	opposed	to	the	REE fixed	point.
19:842:68725:16:15:71:555:396:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Let	 us	 elaborate.  The	 assumed	 algorithm	 consists	 of	 multiple	 rounds	 of	 making	 an	 initial	 conjecture	 about-p-,

22:992:79025:15:16:56:555:648:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:dynamics.  In	Section	8, we	describe	a	multi-period	extension	in	which	additional	rounds	require	more	time.  It	is

22:1000:79820:15:16:56:555:489:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:ization, however, built	on	old-fashioned	ideas	about	“off	equilibrium”	adjustment, which	find	little	place	in	modern

22:1003:80094:16:15:71:555:442:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:We	now	show	how	the	desired	result	can	be	obtainedwithoutthe	aforementioned	caveats, by	bringing	back	the
22:1004:80199:15:15:56:555:427:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:REE concept, removing	 common	 knowledge	 of	 the	 aggregate	 shock, and	 accommodating	 higher-order	 uncertainty
22:1005:80313:15:16:56:555:412:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:(i.e., uncertainty	about	the	beliefs	and	the	actions	of	others). In	so	doing, we	not	only	provide	a	rationalization	of	the
22:1006:80435:16:23:56:523:396:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:GE attenuation	documented	in	the	previous	section, but	also	help	address	the	following	elementary	question:
22:1007:80542:23:16:81:530:373:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:C:Suppose	that	the	analyst	knows	the	structure	of	the	economy.24Suppose	further	that	the	analyst	knows

22:1010:80849:15:24:81:259:327:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:C:about	the	REE outcomes	of	the	economy?
22:1011:80887:24:15:56:555:303:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:This	 question	 clarifies	 what	 we	 are	 after	 in	 this	 section.  We	 are	 not	 interested	 in	 higher-order	 uncertainty	 per	 se.
22:1012:81021:15:16:56:555:288:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Rather, we	offer	a	reconsideration	of	what	the	REE concept	“truly”	predicts—where	“truly”	means	without	the	use	of
22:1013:81135:16:15:56:527:272:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f4:B:strong, albeit	conventional, assumptions	regarding	what	the	agents	know	about	the	behavior	of	other	agents.25
22:1014:81244:15:16:71:555:257:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:From	this	perspective, the	key	finding	of	this	section	is	that	(the	absolute	size	of)	the	GE effect	predicted	by	imposing

22:1018:81625:22:16:56:555:170:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:The	economy	considered	in	this	section	shares	the	same	primitives	(preferences	and	technologies)	as	the	frictionless

23:1036:83411:15:15:71:555:555:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Because	information	differs	across	marketplaces, the	agents	in	one	marketplace	do	not	know	what	the	agents	in

23:1039:83687:15:16:71:555:509:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Such	 higher-order	 uncertainty	 seems	 to	 be	 a	 natural	 feature	 of	 environments	 in	 which	 market	 interactions	 are
23:1040:83810:16:15:56:555:493:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:geographically	segmented.  But	it	can	also	be	the	symptom	of	cognitive	constraints:  in	 line	 with	Tirole	 (2015)	 and
23:1041:83929:15:16:56:555:478:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:others, the	private	signal	we	have	assumed	above	can	be	a	representation	of	“cognitive	states”, or	of	the	coarse, and
23:1042:84046:16:15:56:458:462:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:idiosyncratic, understanding	that	the	agents	may	have	about	what	is	going	on	in	the	economy.
23:1043:84138:15:15:71:555:447:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:This	interpretation	gives	a	behavioral	twist	to	the	present	setting. It	also	builds	a	bridge	to	the	bounded-rationality

23:1045:84378:16:15:56:555:416:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:discrepancy	between	“reality”	and	the	agents’	perceptions	of	it	(i.e., between	actual	outcomes	and	beliefs).  This	is
23:1046:84495:15:16:56:503:401:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:because	the	cognitive	friction	is	modeled	as	incomplete	information	rather	than	as	a	departure	from	REE.
23:1047:84599:16:15:71:555:385:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:The	same	point	applies	if	we	recast	the	aforementioned	signal	as	the	product	of	the	kinds	of	“rational	inattention”

28:1267:101111:15:16:71:555:625:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:A:Remark.   The	 representation	 of	 our	 Walrasian	 economy	 as	 a	 game	 rests	 on	 our	 assumptions	 that	 markets	 are

28:1269:101343:15:16:56:555:594:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:prices	 would	 serve	 as	 signals	 of	 the	 simultaneous	 actions	 of	 other	 players,  preventing	 the	 desired	 game-theoretic
28:1270:101471:16:15:56:555:578:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:B:representation: in	games, players	are	allowed	to	observe	signals	of	thepastactions	of	others, but	not	ofsimultaneous
28:1271:101587:15:16:56:555:563:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:actions.  That	said, the	essence	would	remain	the	same:  even	if	markets	are	centralized, prices	aggregate	dispersed

28:1275:101938:26:16:56:555:466:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:So	far, we	have	shown	that	(i)	dropping	the	assumption	that	the	aggregate	shock	is	common	knowledge	predicts	a

28:1277:102169:15:16:56:555:435:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:is	shared	by	aspecificrelaxation	of	the	REE concept, one	that	built	on	Tâtonnement. Clearly, this	prediction	need	not
28:1278:102286:16:15:56:268:419:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:be	shared	byeveryrelaxation	of	the	REE concept.
28:1279:102333:15:16:71:555:404:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:For	instance, consider	the	form	of	“near	rationality”	suggested	by	Akerlof	and	Yellen	(1985a)	or	the	closely	related
28:1280:102449:16:15:56:554:388:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:concept	of	“ε-equilibrium”	(also	known	as	“near-Nash	equilibrium”).  In	games, this	concept	requires	that	the	action
28:1281:102565:15:15:56:555:373:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:of	each	player	is	“nearly	rational”	in	the	sense	that	it	delivers	a	payoff	that	is	withinεof	the	payoff	delivered	by	the
28:1282:102685:15:16:56:555:358:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:best-response	action, whereε >0is	an	exogenous	scalar	that	can	be	thought	of	as	the	degree	of	bounded	rationality.
28:1283:102799:16:15:56:555:342:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Adapting	this	concept	to	our	Walrasian	setting	boils	down	to	letting	the	“nearly	rational”	demand	and	supply	functions
28:1284:102917:15:16:56:555:327:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:vary	around	the	“fully	rational”	ones	defined	in	Section	3.  As	a	result, the	aggregate	change,∆-q;triggered	by	any

28:1286:103149:15:16:56:554:296:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:does	not	share	the	aforementioned	prediction: the	gap	between	the	micro	and	macro	elasticities	can	belargerin	the

28:1288:103314:15:15:71:555:265:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:This	underscores	that	the	approach	we	favor	in	this	paper—namely, dropping	common	knowledge	of	aggregate

34:1566:125258:15:16:56:555:267:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:This	additional	friction	is	absent	from	Greenwood	and	Hanson	(2015)	and	is, instead, the	core	element	of	Gabaix

34:1578:126728:9:10:56:555:97:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:appropriately	picking	the	relevant	free	parameters	of	his	framework. For	example, settingmy=mr= 1in	Gabaix	(2016b)	recovers	the	standard

41:1869:151672:15:15:56:555:123:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:and	systematic, mistakes, the	balance	is	titled	in	favor	the	approach	that	maintains	the	REE concept	but	relaxes	the
41:1870:151788:15:16:56:259:108:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:common-knowledge	assumptions	of	the	theory.
41:1871:151831:16:15:71:555:92:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Second, this	approach	is	more	“disciplined”	in	the	sense	that	it	doesnotallow	the	possibility	to	obtain	the	opposite

41:1873:152060:16:0:56:390:61:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:(2009), and	Level-k	Thinking	in	contexts	where	the	GE effects	offset	PE effects.
42:1874:152262:0:15:56:555:709:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:prediction: the	GE effects	of	any	given	aggregate	shock	are	attenuated	relative	to	their	frictionless	counterparts	in	the
42:1875:152383:15:15:56:555:694:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:short	run, but	get	closer	and	closer	to	the	latter	as	the	time	passes. The	reason	is	that	the	level	of	common	knowledge
42:1876:152502:15:16:56:514:679:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:about	the	underlying	aggregate	shock	increases	endogenously	as	the	agents	observe	past	market	outcomes.
42:1877:152605:16:15:71:555:663:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:This	prediction	appears	to	be, not	only	a	priori	plausible, but	also	consistent	with	the	evidence	documented	in
42:1878:152716:15:16:56:534:648:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Coibion	and	Gorodnichenko	(2012). Yet, this	prediction	is	not	necessarily	shared	by	the	alternative	approaches.
42:1879:152827:16:15:71:555:632:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Consider	the	particular	setting	studied	in	the	last	section. A key	feature	of	that	setting	was	that	a	shock	occurs	only
42:1880:152946:15:16:56:555:617:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:once, in	the	beginning	of	the	calendar	time.  In	such	as	setting, one	can	reconcile	the	idea	that	GE adjustment	takes
42:1881:153063:16:15:56:555:601:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:time	with	some	of	the	considered	forms	of	bounded	rationality, such	as	Level-k	Thinking, by	making	the	additional
42:1882:153176:15:15:56:555:586:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:assumption	that	agents	become	“deeper	thinkers”	as	the	calendar	time	increases. However, this	begs	the	question	of
42:1883:153290:15:16:56:184:571:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:what	justifies	this	assumption.
42:1884:153321:16:15:71:555:555:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:What	is	more, this	assumption	is	not	useful	to	stationary	environments	with	recurring	shocks. In	such	settings, one
42:1885:153436:15:16:56:555:540:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:would	need	the	depth	of	thinking	to	increase, not	with	calendar	time, but	rather	with	the	time	lag	since	the	shock	has
42:1886:153554:16:15:56:555:524:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:occurred. But	how	could	it	be	that	agents	are	shallow	thinkers	vis-a-vis	recent	shocks	and, at	the	same	time, are	deep
42:1887:153672:15:15:56:301:509:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:thinkers	vis-a-vis	shocks	that	occurred	further	in	the	past?
42:1888:153732:15:16:71:555:494:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Fourth, note	that	the	approaches	that	drop	the	REE concept	require	the	selection	of	a	“default	point”	that	serves	as
42:1889:153848:16:15:56:555:478:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	anchor	of	the	conjectures	that	the	agents	form	about	the	actions	of	others	or, equivalently, about	all	the	endogenous
42:1890:153969:15:16:56:555:463:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f6:B:economic	outcomes. In	the	variants	studied	in	Section	7, this	default	point	was	assumed	to	coincide	with-poldor-qold;
42:1891:154086:16:15:56:210:447:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	pre-shock	frictionless	outcomes.
42:1892:154122:15:16:71:555:432:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:This	appears	to	mirror	the	specification	of	the	common	prior	in	Section	6: in	the	incomplete-information	variant,
42:1893:154235:16:15:56:554:416:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	equilibrium	beliefs	of-pand-qwere	anchored	to, respectively,-poldand-qoldonly	because	the	common	prior	of	the
42:1894:154348:15:15:56:555:401:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:underlying	aggregate	fundamental	was	centered	around--old. Does	this	mean	that	the	two	approaches	have	the	same
42:1895:154459:15:16:56:302:386:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:degree	of	freedom	in	choosing	the	relevant	belief	anchor?
42:1896:154516:16:15:71:555:370:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Not	 really.   Once	 our	 preferred	 approach	 is	 adapted	 to	 stationary	 dynamic	 settings,  there	 is	 no	 such	 freedom:
42:1897:154641:15:16:56:555:355:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	objective	probability	distribution	of	the	exogenous	fundamentals	together	with	Bayesian	learning	discipline	what
42:1898:154757:16:15:56:555:339:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	anchor	is.  By	contrast, with	the	non-REE alternatives, the	default	point	remains	a	free	parameter, which	can	be
42:1899:154873:15:16:56:259:324:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f4:B:disciplined	only	with	additional	assumptions.47
42:1900:154920:16:15:71:555:308:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Last	but	not	least, it	is	not	clear	whether	the	REE concept	is	more	demanding	on	the	cognitive	abilities	of	an	agent
42:1901:155036:15:15:56:555:293:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:than	any	of	the	considered	forms	of	bounded	rationality.  Indeed, what	is	easier?  To	solve	for	the	REE fixed	point; to
42:1902:155155:15:16:56:554:278:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:compute	thek-th	order	iteration	of	the	mappingTfork-1; to	solve	the	ODE associated	with	the	reflective	equilib-
42:1903:155266:16:15:56:555:262:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:rium; or	to	solve	themodifiedfixed	point	proposed	by	Gabaix	(2016b)? In	our	view, the	answer	to	this	question	is	not
42:1904:155382:15:16:56:555:247:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:obvious.  We	therefore	think	that	the	common	appeal	of	all	these	approaches	is	their	ability	to	generate	predictions
42:1905:155498:16:15:56:532:231:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:that	seem	conceptually	plausible	and	empirically	relevant, but	are	inconsistent	with	the	frictionless	benchmark.
42:1906:155610:15:16:71:555:216:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:In	our	eyes, these	considerations	tilt	the	balance	in	the	direction	of	the	methodological	approach	that	maintains	the

42:1908:155842:15:15:56:555:185:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:knowledge	of	the	underlying	fundamentals—which	is	the	approach	taken	in	Section	6 of	the	present	paper, in	the
42:1909:155952:15:16:56:555:170:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:complementary	contribution	of	Bergemann	and	Morris	(2013), and	in	much	of	the	literature	reviewed	in	Angeletos
42:1910:156062:16:15:56:555:154:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:and	Lian	(2016b). However, we	do	not	wish	to	disparage	any	of	the	considered	non-REE alternatives. To	the	contrary,
42:1911:156177:15:16:56:555:139:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:we	believe	that	all	these	approaches	complement	one	another	in	the	direction	of	offering	a	more	useful	representation
42:1912:156294:16:15:56:410:123:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:of	the	real	world	than	the	one	permitted	by	more	conventional	modeling	practices.
42:1913:156375:15:15:71:555:108:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:A:Remark.In	this	paper, we	defined	PE as	the	adjustment	that	takes	place	in	each	marketplace	holding	constant	the
42:1914:156486:15:16:56:555:93:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:outcomes	in	other	marketplaces. We	also	introduced	a	friction—whether	in	the	form	of	removing	common	knowledge
42:1915:156596:16:12:63:555:77:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:47Of	course, the	practitioners	of	these	approaches	are	fully	aware	of	this	issue	and	apply	careful	judgement	in	choosing	the	default	points	in	their
42:1916:156744:12:0:56:432:65:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:works. Our	point	here	is	only	to	highlight	that	our	preferred	approach	bypasses	the	need	for	such	judgements.
43:1917:156968:0:15:56:555:709:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:B:the	 behavior	 of	 agents	 in	 other	 marketplaces.   We	 did	 not,  however,  allow	 a	 similar	 friction	 to	 be	 presentwithin
43:1918:157097:15:15:56:555:694:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:each	marketplace.  Although	one	can	relax	this	assumption	(at	the	expense	of	having	to	deal	with	the	endogenous
43:1919:157208:15:16:56:555:679:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:aggregation	 of	 information	 through	 prices),  the	 following	 principle	 seems	 reasonable.   Agents	 have	 more	 precise
43:1920:157332:16:15:56:555:663:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:information	about	the	markets	they	themselves	currently	participate	in	than	about	“remote”	markets—where	“remote”
43:1921:157445:15:16:56:555:648:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:could	refer	to	distance	in	terms	of	geography, time, or	knowledge.  Our	preferred	approach	then	suggests	that	it	is
43:1922:157560:16:15:56:555:632:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:precisely	equilibrium	effects	operating	through	more	remote	connections	that	are	likely	to	be	attenuated	more.  This
43:1923:157676:15:16:56:555:617:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:point	suggests	an	extension	of	our	analysis	to	networks	and	a	bridge	to	the	works	of	Bergemann, Heumann, and	Morris
43:1924:157791:16:33:56:381:601:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:(2017)	and	Golub	and	Morris	(2017); we	leave	this	open	for	future	research.

43:1926:157883:23:15:56:555:545:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:We	now	discuss	a	few	possible	applications, some	of	which	we	explore	in	companion	work. These	applications	cannot
43:1927:157996:15:16:56:555:530:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:be	nested	in	the	abstract	framework	of	this	paper: they	feature	micro-foundations	that	are	appropriate	for	the	particular
43:1928:158117:16:15:56:555:514:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:contexts	of	interest, richer	market	structures, more	elaborate	forms	of	forward-looking	behavior, and	specific	kinds	of
43:1929:158236:15:15:56:555:499:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:PE and	GE effects. They	nevertheless	share	the	central	theme	of	this	paper, namely	the	attenuation	of	GE mechanisms.
43:1930:158352:15:16:71:555:484:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:To	illustrate, consider	Angeletos	and	Lian	(2016a).  In	that	paper, we	show	how	relaxing	the	common-knowledge

43:1932:158575:15:16:56:555:453:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	 “forward	 guidance	 puzzle.”  In	 the	 next	 few	 paragraphs, we	 briefly	 review	 the	 puzzle, the	 contribution	 of	 our
43:1933:158702:16:15:56:290:437:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:companion	paper, and	its	relation	to	the	present	paper.
43:1934:158757:15:16:71:555:422:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:The	aforementioned	puzzle	refers	to	the	following	issue. Suppose	the	economy	is	described	by	the	New-Keynesian
43:1935:158867:16:15:56:555:406:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:model. Suppose	further	that	the	economy	is	in	a	slump	and	that	the	zero-lower-bound	(ZLB) binds	up	to	a	future	date
43:1936:158982:15:15:56:554:391:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f4:B:t=T-1, for	someT-2. Because	of	this	constraint, the	monetary	authority	is	unable	to	stimulate	aggregate	demand
43:1937:159092:15:16:56:555:376:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:by	reducing	the	current	Federal	funds	rate. Yet, according	to	the	model, the	same	goal	can	be	achieved	by	a	credible
43:1938:159208:16:15:56:554:360:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:promise	 to	 keep	 the	 interest	 rate	 below	 its	 “natural	 level”	 after	 the	 ZLB has	 ceased	 to	 bind, that	 is, att-T.  For
43:1939:159338:15:16:56:555:345:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:plausible	parameterizations	of	the	model, the	effectiveness	of	such	a	policy	is	quantitatively	large. What	is	more, for
43:1940:159457:16:15:56:554:329:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:any	parameterization, the	effectiveness	increases	withT: the	further	into	the	future	forward	guidance	has	to	operate,

43:1944:159855:15:16:71:555:268:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:These	predictions	are	considered, by	many	economists, as	empirically	implausible, which	is	why	the	issue	is	known
43:1945:159968:16:15:56:555:252:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:as	a	“puzzle”. For	our	purposes, the	key	is	to	observe	that	these	predictions	are	driven	by	certain	GE effects. The	most
43:1946:160088:15:16:56:555:237:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:crucial	among	these	GE effects	is	the	feedback	loop	between	aggregate	spending	and	inflation. Reducing	the	nominal

43:1948:160309:15:16:56:555:206:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:increase	in	inflation	translates	to	a	lowrealinterest	rate	betweenT-1andT:This	stimulates	aggregate	spending	at
43:1949:160420:16:15:56:555:190:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f4:B:T-1, contributing	to	even	higher	inflation	atT-1, which	in	turn	feeds	to	even	higher	spending	atT-2;and	so
43:1950:160526:15:15:56:555:175:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:on. Clearly, the	cumulative	effect	att= 0increases	withT;which	explains	why	the	power	of	forward	guidance	also
43:1951:160636:15:16:56:554:160:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:increases	withT. Finally, by	permitting	a	greater	inflation	response, a	greater	degree	of	price	flexibility	increases	the
43:1952:160757:16:15:56:434:144:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:potency	of	this	GE mechanism, thus	also	increasing	the	effectiveness	of	monetary	policy.
43:1953:160845:15:16:71:555:129:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:In	the	standard	New-Keynesian	model, the	aforementioned	GE mechanism	is	captured	by	theinteractionof	the

43:1955:161065:15:15:56:555:98:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:GE mechanisms, buried	underneath	these	equations.  The	one	has	to	do	with	the	feedback	from	future	inflation	to
43:1956:161176:15:16:56:555:83:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:current	inflation:  for	givenrealmarginal	costs, the	individual	firm	is	more	willing	to	raise	itsnominalprice	today	if
43:1957:161294:16:0:56:555:67:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:she	expects	other	firms	to	do	the	same	in	the	future.  The	other	has	to	do	with	the	feedback	from	aggregate	spending
44:1958:161524:0:15:56:420:709:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:spend	more	herself, because	her	own	income	increases	with	aggregate	consumption.
44:1959:161604:15:15:71:555:694:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:The	main	result	in	Angeletos	and	Lian	(2016a)	is	that	removing	common	knowledge	of	the	policy	attenuatesallthe
44:1960:161714:15:16:56:555:679:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:aforementioned	GE effects	and, in	so	doing, limits	the	policy	maker’s	ability	to	stimulate	the	economy. This	result	can
44:1961:161833:16:15:56:485:663:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:be	seen	as	an	application	of	the	present	paper. Nevertheless, it	is	worth	highlighting	three	subtleties.
44:1962:161937:15:16:71:555:648:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:First, the	framework	used	in	that	paper	does	not	feature	the	kind	of	market	segmentation	assumed	in	the	present
44:1963:162048:16:15:56:555:632:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:paper: markets	are	centralized. The	desired	friction—lack	of	common	knowledge—is	then	preserved	by	allowing	for
44:1964:162159:15:16:56:555:617:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:enough	sources	of	uncertainty	so	that	the	observed	prices	do	not	perfectly	reveal	the	aggregate	shock. This	underscores
44:1965:162278:16:15:56:555:601:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:that, although	the	particular	market	structure	assumed	in	the	present	paper	permitted	a	particular	specification	of	the
44:1966:162397:15:15:56:452:586:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:“geography”	of	information, these	particulars	are	not	strictly	needed	for	our	insights	to	apply.
44:1967:162493:15:16:71:555:571:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Second, the	 GE effects	 featured	 in	 that	 paper	 have	 a	 much	 richer	 dynamic	 structure	 than	 those	 featured	 in	 the
44:1968:162618:16:15:56:555:555:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:present	 paper.  This	 is	 because	 the	 optimal	 consumption	 of	 an	 individual	 household	 in	 any	 given	 period	 depends
44:1969:162743:15:16:56:555:540:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:on	 the	 income	 and	 the	 interest	 rate	 she	 expects	 to	 face	 inallfuture	 periods—and	 similarly	 the	 optimal	 reset	 price
44:1970:162873:16:15:56:555:524:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:of	a	firm	depends	on	the	inflation	and	the	real	marginal	costs	she	expects	to	face	inallfuture	periods.  To	make	an
44:1971:162988:15:15:56:555:509:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:analogy, think	of	each	future	period	in	that	paper	as	a	different	kind	of	“afternoon	markets”	in	the	present	paper, with
44:1972:163108:15:16:56:555:494:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:price	of	each	such	market	entering	the	demand	and	supply	in	the	“morning	market”. Despite	this	complexity, a	sharp
44:1973:163222:16:15:56:498:478:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:characterization	is	possible	thanks	to	the	fact	that	all	the	relevant	GE effects	work	in	the	same	direction.
44:1974:163330:15:16:71:555:463:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Last	but	not	least, because	of	the	aforementioned	forward-looking	aspects, a	new, and	context-specific, prediction
44:1975:163444:16:15:56:555:447:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:emerges:  the	documented	attenuation	is	stronger	the	further	into	the	future	the	policy	operates	(i.e., the	largerTis).
44:1976:163563:15:16:56:555:432:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:This	is	because	longer	horizons	maps	to	beliefs	of	higher	order, which	are	themselves	more	anchored	to	the	common
44:1977:163676:16:15:56:265:416:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:prior	for	any	given	level	of	informational	friction.
44:1978:163728:15:15:71:555:401:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Additional	applications	include	Angeletos	and	Lian	(2017)	and	Angeletos	and	Lian	(2016c).  In	the	former	paper,
44:1979:163839:15:16:56:555:386:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:we	explore	how	lack	of	common	knowledge	affects	the	validity	of	Ricardian	Equivalence	and	the	macroeconomic
44:1980:163946:16:15:56:555:370:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:effects	 of	 shocks	 to	 taxes	 and	 government	 spending	 in	 both	 the	 RBC and	 the	 New-Keynesian	 framework.   In	 the
44:1981:164069:15:16:56:555:355:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:latter	 paper, we	 shift	 attention	 to	 the	 popular	 notion—if	 not	 the	 apparent	 fact—that	 a	 drop	 in	 consumer	 spending,
44:1982:164198:16:15:56:555:339:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:such	as	the	one	triggered	by	a	“discount-factor	shock”	or	by	deleveraging, can	trigger	a	recession.  As	noted	in	the
44:1983:164314:15:16:56:555:324:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Introduction, this	notion	is	grounded	on	solid	PE intuitions, yet	it	finds	no	place	in	the	RBC framework	because	of
44:1984:164429:16:15:56:555:308:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:countervailing	GE effects. In	our	companion	paper, we	add	an	information	friction	that, not	only	helps	attenuate	these
44:1985:164547:15:15:56:555:293:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:GE effects	along	the	lines	suggested	by	the	present	paper, but	also	introduces	a	feedback	mechanism	that	resembles
44:1986:164661:15:16:56:555:278:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	Keynesian	multiplier, despite	the	absence	of	nominal	rigidity.  As	a	result, the	modified	RBC model	is	able, not
44:1987:164777:16:15:56:555:262:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:only	to	accommodate	the	aforementioned	notion/fact, but	also	to	disentangle	the	degree	of	monetary	non-neutrality
44:1988:164890:15:16:56:465:247:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f4:B:from	the	question	of	whether	and	how	“demand	forces”	explain	the	observed	business	cycles.48
44:1989:164982:16:15:71:555:231:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:The	earlier	works	of	Angeletos	and	La’O	(2010), Venkateswaran	(2014), and	Schaal	and	Taschereau-Dumouchel
44:1990:165087:15:16:56:555:216:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:(2015)	can	also	be	understood	as	applications	of	the	broader	theme	of	our	paper. The	first	paper	effectively	attenuates
44:1991:165206:16:15:56:555:200:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	GE effects	of	TFP shocks	in	the	RBC model	and	argues	that	this	helps	reconcile	that	model	with	the	evidence	in	Gali
44:1992:165325:15:15:56:555:185:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:(1999).  The	second	paper	effectively	attenuates	the	GE effects	of	TFP shocks	in	the	DMP model	and	argues	that	this
44:1993:165440:15:16:56:555:170:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:helps	lessen	the	“Shimer	puzzle”	(Shimer,	2005). The	third	paper	effectively	attenuates	the	GE interaction	of	the	firms	in
44:1994:165562:16:15:56:555:154:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:a	variant	of	the	RBC model	with	non-convex	technologies. When	TFP shocks	are	common	knowledge, this	interaction
44:1995:165673:15:16:56:555:139:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:is	strong	enough	that	multiple	equilibria	are	possible; when	instead	there	is	sufficient	higher-order	uncertainty	about
44:1996:165792:16:15:56:500:123:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	underlying	TFP shocks, this	interaction	gets	weakened	enough	that	a	unique	equilibrium	is	selected.
44:1997:165895:15:15:71:555:108:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Finally, although	all	the	applications	discussed	above	are	confined	to	macroeconomics, the	insights	we	have	devel-
44:1998:166009:15:16:56:555:93:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:oped	are	applicable	in	other	fields	as	well. For	instance, if	one	re-interprets	our	model	as	one	applying	to	an	industry
44:1999:166129:16:12:63:555:77:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:48This	does	not	mean	that	we	favor	models	that	feature	monetary	neutrality. We	only	wish	to	contrast	with	the	New-Keynesian	framework, which
44:2000:166269:12:0:56:231:65:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:prohibits	the	aforementioned	kind	of	disentangling.
45:2001:166440:0:15:56:555:709:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:mand	and	supply	shocks, or	of	regulatory	reforms. This	may, inter	alia, help	shed	light	on	the	evidence	in	Greenwood
45:2002:166556:15:15:56:321:694:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:and	Hanson	(2015)	and	Doraszelski, Lewis, and	Pakes	(2017).
45:2003:166615:15:16:71:555:679:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Consider	first	Greenwood	and	Hanson	(2015). This	paper	documents	the	cycles	of	the	dry	bulk	shipping	industry
45:2004:166724:16:15:56:555:663:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:B:and	interprets	these	cycles	as	the	outcomes	of	a	model	in	which	firms	neglect	a	GE effect, namely, theendogenous
45:2005:166836:15:16:56:555:648:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:response	of	their	competitors’	investment	choices	and	of	the	future	price	to	the	exogenous,industry-wide, demand
45:2006:166948:16:15:56:555:632:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:shocks. This	assumption	borrows	from	the	“competition	neglect”	discussed, informally, in	Camerer	and	Lovallo	(1999)
45:2007:167063:15:16:56:555:617:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:and	Kahneman	(2011). In	the	light	of	our	results, this	effect	can	be	rationalized	by	allowing	the	firms	to	lack	common
45:2008:167181:16:15:56:555:601:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:knowledge	 of	 the	 underlying	 industry-wide	 shocks.  By	 the	 same	 token, the	 evidence	 in	 Greenwood	 and	 Hanson
45:2009:167300:15:15:56:441:586:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:(2015)	may	be	consistent	with	an	incomplete-information	extension	of	Kalouptsidi	(2014).
45:2010:167388:15:16:71:555:571:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Consider	 next	 Doraszelski,  Lewis,  and	 Pakes	 (2017).   This	 paper	 documents	 the	 empirical	 response	 of	 the	 UK
45:2011:167509:16:15:56:555:555:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:electricity	industry	to	a	market	reform	and	interprets	this	response	as	the	product	of	anoff-equilibriumadjustment,
45:2012:167624:15:16:56:555:540:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:namely, of	a	form	of	learning	about	how	to	play	thecomplete-informationNash	equilibrium. In	the	light	of	our	results,
45:2013:167741:16:15:56:555:524:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	 observed	 dynamics	 could	 also	 be	 reconciled	 with	 rational	 expectations	 once	 one	 allows	 for	 lack	 of	 common
45:2014:167865:15:15:56:465:509:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:knowledge. This	conjecture	appears	to	be	consistent	with	Bonatti, Cisternas, and	Toikka	(2017).
45:2015:167960:15:16:71:555:494:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:To	sum	up, we	hope	that	the	examples	discussed	in	this	subsection	indicate, not	only	the	broad	applicability	of	the
45:2016:168075:16:15:56:555:478:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:insights	and	of	the	perspective	developed	in	this	paper, but	also	the	added	value	of	exploring	specific	applications:
45:2017:168192:15:16:56:555:463:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:such	applications	can	deliver	concrete	empirical	predictions	and	useful	policy	lessons, which	are	not	possible	in	the
45:2018:168309:16:15:56:287:447:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:present	paper	due	to	the	assumed	level	of	abstraction.
45:2019:168363:15:16:71:555:432:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:We	close	this	section	by	making	an	additional	observation, which	may	help	further	guide	future	empirical	or	quan-
45:2020:168476:16:15:56:555:416:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:titative	work.  The	GE attenuation	mechanism	we	have	studied	in	this	paper	has	distinct	empirical	implications	from
45:2021:168591:15:15:56:555:401:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:adjustment	costs, habit, liquidity	constraints, sparsity, and	any	other	friction	that	affect	individual	behavior	(decision
45:2022:168713:15:16:56:555:386:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:rules). Such	frictions	ought	to	manifest	in	the	response	of	individual	outcomes	to	idiosyncratic	shocks. Our	mechanism,
45:2023:168832:16:15:56:555:370:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:by	contrast, keeps	these	micro-level	responses	constant	and	modifies	only	the	macro-level	responses	by	attenuating, or
45:2024:168950:15:16:56:555:355:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:slowing	down, the	relevant	GE effects. Our	mechanism	may	thus	help	explain, inter	alia, why	hump-shaped	impulse
45:2025:169061:16:40:56:447:339:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:responses	appear	to	be	more	pronounced	in	macroeconomic	time	series	that	in	micro	data.
45:2026:169148:40:26:56:156:299:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:C:10  Conclusion
45:2027:169162:26:16:56:555:273:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:General-equilibrium	 effects	 that	 operate	 at	 the	 economy-wide	 level	 are	 central	 to	 understanding	 the	 response	 of
45:2028:169287:16:15:56:555:257:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:macroeconomic	outcomes	to	aggregate	shocks, as	well	as	to	policy	interventions. Such	effects	limit	the	usefulness	of
45:2029:169403:15:15:56:555:242:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:partial-equilibrium	intuitions. They	also	introduce	a	gap	between	the	macroeconomic	effects	of	interest	and	the	kind
45:2030:169519:15:16:56:396:227:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:of	micro	or	local	elasticities	that	are	estimated	in	a	growing	empirical	literature.
45:2031:169603:16:15:71:555:211:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:In	this	paper, we	sought	to	operationalize	the	notion	that	general-equilibrium	effects	may	be	less	potent, or	may
45:2032:169716:15:16:56:555:196:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:take	more	time	to	build	force, than	what	is	often	presumed	in	applied	research.  To	this	goal, we	built	on	existing
45:2033:169831:16:15:56:385:180:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:insights, but	also	blended	them	in	a	new—and	hopefully	insightful—manner.
45:2034:169904:15:16:71:555:165:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:We	considered	an	elementary	Walrasian	economy, in	which	trading	was	sequential	and	decentralized.  We	fixed
45:2035:170011:16:15:56:555:149:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the	microeconomic	foundations	in	terms	of	the	specification	of	preferences, technologies, and	market	structures; in	so
45:2036:170129:15:15:56:555:134:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:doing, we	also	fixed	the	relevant	demand	and	supply	functions. We	next	characterized	the	response	of	this	economy
45:2037:170242:15:16:56:555:119:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:to	an	aggregate	shock	under	a	benchmark	specification	that, in	line	with	the	vast	majority	of	applied	work, imposed

45:2039:170467:15:16:56:555:88:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:in	two	distinct	ways.  In	the	one, we	dropped	the	rational	expectations	solution	concept	in	favor	of	certain	kinds	of

46:2045:171199:16:15:56:555:663:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:emphasized	that	this	variant	does	not	require	a	literal	interpretation	of	the	informational	friction; as	in	Sims	(2003)	and
