2:28:1434:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:This paper combines a model of parental school choice with randomized school lotteries in order to
2:29:1532:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:understand the effects of being assigned to a first-choice school on academic outcomes. We outline
2:30:1630:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:a simple framework in which those who place the highest weight on academics when choosing a school
2:31:1728:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:benefit the most academically when admitted. Although the average student does not improve academically
2:32:1831:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:when winning a school lottery, this average impact conceals a range of impacts for identifiable subgroups
2:33:1936:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:of students. Children of parents whose choices revealed a strong preference for academic quality experienced
2:34:2044:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:significant gains in test scores as a result of attending their chosen school, while children whose parents
2:35:2151:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:weighted academic characteristics less heavily experienced academic losses. This differential effect
2:36:2251:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:is largest for children of parents who forfeit the most in terms of utility gains from proximity and racial
2:37:2358:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:match to choose a school with stronger academics. Depending on one's own race and neighborhood,
2:38:2453:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:a preference for academic quality can either conflict with or be reinforced by other objectives, such
2:39:2554:14:28:72:293:434:12:Times:12:Times:as a desire for proximity and same-race peers.

3:63:3018:21:14:90:93:660:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: 
3:64:3018:14:20:126:527:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Public  school  choice  plans  are  intended  to  improve  academic  achievement,  by  
3:65:3105:20:21:90:526:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:allowing parents to choose a school other than  their  neighborhood  school  and  by  giving  
3:66:3199:21:21:89:527:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:local  schools  an  incentive  to  attract  and  retain  students.  Many  urban  public  school  
3:67:3296:21:20:90:524:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:districts are experimenting with some form of school choice. In fact, the federal No Child 
3:68:3387:20:21:90:521:564:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Left Behind Act (NCLB) requires that school districts give students at persistently under-
3:69:3477:21:21:90:528:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:performing  public  schools  the  option  to  choose  a  higher-achieving  public  school.  
3:70:3569:21:21:90:525:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Nevertheless, there is little empirical evidence that offering disadvantaged students more 
3:71:3660:21:20:90:433:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:choices will lead to any substantial increase in academic achievement.  
3:72:3732:20:21:126:528:481:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A  number  of  papers  have  used  random  assignment  to  estimate  the  effect  on  
3:73:3818:21:21:90:525:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:academic outcomes of attending a school other than the local public school. Most of these 
3:74:3908:21:20:90:526:439:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:papers  identify  the  average  treatment  effect  using  lottery  assignment  to  over-subscribed  
3:75:4008:20:21:90:527:419:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:public  schools  or  the  randomization  of  private  school  vouchers  (Witte  et  al.  (1995),  
3:76:4106:21:21:90:525:398:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Greene et al. (1997), Rouse (1998), Peterson et al. (1998), Mayer  et  al.  (2002),  Krueger  
3:77:4200:21:20:90:527:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and  Zhu  (2004),  Cullen  et  al.  (2006),  Hastings  et  al.  (2006b)).1  Taken  together,  these  
3:78:4301:20:21:90:407:357:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:papers fail to find robust impacts on average academic outcomes. 
3:79:4366:21:21:126:525:336:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: However, as noted in many of these papers, parents may have a variety of reasons 
3:80:4447:21:20:90:527:315:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:for  choosing  schools,  and  we  might  expect  this  to  lead  to  heterogeneous  impacts  of  
3:81:4544:20:21:90:529:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:attending  a  first  choice  school  on  academic  achievement  (Heckman  et  al.  (1997),  
3:82:4636:21:21:90:525:274:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Heckman (1997), Heckman,  et al. (2006)). The child of an academically oriented parent 
3:83:4723:21:21:90:527:253:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:who  chooses  to  send  her  child  across  town  to  attend  a  high-performing  school  may  
3:84:4818:21:20:90:527:232:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:experience  larger  gains  from  school  choice  than  the  child  of  a  parent  who  chooses  a  
3:85:4917:20:21:90:525:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:school primarily for convenience – particularly when the most convenient school is low 
3:86:5004:21:21:90:526:191:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:performing. Thus, the average effect of attending a first choice school may be zero even 
3:87:5093:21:50:90:490:170:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:if schools do have offsetting positive and negative impacts for subsets of children.

3:89:5227:7:16:90:526:113:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:1  An  earlier  non-experimental  literature  compared  academic  outcomes  of  those  students  who  chose  to  
3:90:5340:16:12:90:526:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:attend  private,  charter  or  magnet  schools  to  those  students  who  remained  in  their  neighborhood  school

4:93:5596:0:20:126:526:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In this paper we use the choice rankings of parents following the introduction of 
4:94:5678:20:21:90:526:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:district-wide  school  choice  in  the  Charlotte-Mecklenburg  School  District  (CMS)  along  
4:95:5773:21:21:90:525:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:with lottery assignment of students to first choice schools to shed light on the factors that 
4:96:5867:21:20:90:527:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:drive  parental  choice  and  their  relationship  to  subsequent  student  outcomes.  In  2002,  
4:97:5965:20:21:90:530:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:CMS   introduced   a   district-wide   choice   plan   to   end   three   decades   of   busing   for   
4:98:6069:21:21:90:525:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:integration. All parents in the district were asked to provide their top three school choices 
4:99:6163:21:20:90:525:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and a lottery was used to determine admission  to  oversubscribed  schools.  We  show  that  
4:100:6256:20:21:90:525:564:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:parents’ choices were very heterogeneous, and outline a simple model that illustrates how 
4:101:6346:21:21:90:527:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the  academic  gains  from  attending  a  first-choice  school  should  be  positive  for  parents  
4:102:6446:21:21:90:525:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:who place a high implicit weight on academics when choosing a school, and potentially 
4:103:6532:21:20:90:526:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:negative  for  parents  who  place  low  weights  on  academics  and  high  weights  on  other  
4:104:6628:20:21:90:528:481:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:factors  that  are  negatively  correlated  with  academics  (e.g.  geographic  proximity  or  
4:105:6723:21:21:90:526:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:fraction  minority).  We  then  use  the  rich  choice  data  and  lottery  assignment  to  test  this  
4:106:6827:21:20:90:526:439:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:model in the data, explicitly allowing for heterogeneity in treatment effects generated by 
4:107:6918:20:21:90:390:419:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the underlying preferences that drove parents’ school choices. 
4:108:6981:21:21:126:527:398:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In  order  to  estimate  the  implicit  weight  each  parent  placed  on  academics  when  
4:109:7072:21:20:90:530:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:choosing   a   school,   we   first   estimate   the   distribution   of   preferences   for   school   
4:110:7176:20:21:90:524:357:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:characteristics  using  a  mixed  logit  model  (McFadden  and  Train  (2000),Train  (2003)).2 
4:111:7270:21:21:89:526:336:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:This  random  utility  model  allows  parents  to  have  heterogeneous  preferences  for  school  
4:112:7368:21:20:89:526:315:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:characteristics  that  depend  on  observable  demographics  as  well  as  idiosyncratic  factors.  
4:113:7468:20:21:89:524:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The estimates from this model can be used to calculate a posterior estimate of the implicit 
4:114:7560:21:21:89:527:274:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:weight  that  each  parent  placed  on  academics  when  choosing  a  school.3  This  implicit  
4:115:7656:21:21:90:526:253:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:weight  is  effectively  a  non-linear  index  of  baseline  characteristics,  combining  all  of  the  
4:116:7760:21:20:90:526:232:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:information about the student, their proximity to each school, the characteristics of each 
4:117:7851:20:21:89:526:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:school and the schools their parents selected into a single summary statistic. It measures 
4:118:7942:21:21:89:526:191:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:how  unexpected  a  parent’s  choices  were  relative  to  what  a  typical  parent  would  have  
4:119:8040:21:20:89:527:170:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:chosen  given  their  demographics  and  geographic  location.  For  example,  if  a  parent  
4:120:8134:20:18:89:525:150:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:chooses  schools  with  high  test  scores  in  each  of  their  three  choices,  passing  over  closer

4:124:8423:7:16:90:524:101:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:3 Because of the availability in our data of multiple ranked choices for each parent, we are able to identify 
4:125:8533:16:11:90:524:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:idiosyncratic  heterogeneity  in  preferences  based  on  systematic  differences  in  the  sequential  choices  made  
4:126:8652:11:0:90:414:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:by parents of similar students facing similar school options (Berry et al. (2004)). 
5:127:8737:0:20:90:526:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:schools  that  most  other  parents  would  have  preferred,  we  would  infer  that  they  place  a  
5:128:8839:20:21:90:264:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:high implicit weight on academics.  
5:129:8875:21:21:126:528:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:We  then  turn  to  the  lottery  assignments  to  investigate  if  students  experience  
5:130:8965:21:20:90:526:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:academic gains from attending a first-choice school. Consistent with the prior literature, 
5:131:9056:20:21:90:527:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:we  find  no  average  gain  in  test  scores  from  attending  a  first  choice  school.  We  do,  
5:132:9156:21:21:90:522:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:however,  find  significant  positive  gains  among  white  students  and  students  of  higher-
5:133:9252:21:20:90:528:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:income  families,  and  negative  but  insignificant  impacts  for  African  Americans  and  
5:134:9345:20:21:90:526:564:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:children of lower-income families. We show that this pattern of subgroup differences in 
5:135:9433:21:21:90:526:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:gains  is  consistent  with  differences  in  underlying  preferences  and  the  trade-offs  parents  
5:136:9535:21:21:90:528:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:face.  We  do  this  in  two  ways.  First,  we  show  that  the  average  weight  placed  on  
5:137:9630:21:20:90:527:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:academics  is  positively  correlated  with  the  average  treatment  effect  across  subgroups  
5:138:9727:20:21:90:529:481:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:(although  the  differences  in  subgroup  impacts  are  too  imprecisely  estimated  to  be  
5:139:9821:21:21:90:527:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:statistically  distinguishable).  Second  we  allow  the  treatment  effect  of  attending  a  first  
5:140:9923:21:20:90:526:439:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:choice school to vary explicitly with the implicit weight that parents place on academics. 
5:141:10014:20:21:90:527:419:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:We  find  that  the  treatment  effect  varies  significantly  and  positively  with  this  weight.  
5:142:10115:21:21:89:526:398:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Students  with  estimated  weights  on  school  test  scores  at  the  95th  percentile  experienced  
5:143:10217:21:20:90:526:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:significant  rises  in  End  of  Grade  test  scores  of  approximately  0.1  standard  deviations.  
5:144:10318:20:21:90:525:357:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:These students are most likely to be white and have higher income levels, thus generating 
5:145:10408:21:21:89:526:336:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the  significant  subgroup  impacts  by  race  and  income.  In  contrast,  students  placing  little  
5:146:10511:21:20:90:527:315:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:value  on  academics  actually  experienced  declines  in  academic  achievement.  We  show  
5:147:10604:20:21:90:526:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:that  this  is  strongest  for  African  Americans,  who  must  trade-off  academic  gains  against  
5:148:10705:21:21:90:483:274:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:utility gains from attending a school with a high proportion of minority students.  
5:149:10789:21:21:125:526:253:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:This  paper  offers  a  model  and  an  approach  that  explains  and  gives  an  economic  
5:150:10881:21:20:89:528:232:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:interpretation  to  heterogeneous  treatment  effects  across  subgroups  of  students.  Prior  
5:151:10977:20:21:89:529:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:research  has  speculated  that  differing  preferences  may  contribute  to  the  observed  
5:152:11070:21:21:89:527:191:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:differences  in  impacts  across  subgroups,  but  has  not  had  a  setting  in  which  to  both  
5:153:11169:21:20:90:526:170:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:estimate  the  underlying  determinants  of  school  choice  and  the  resulting  outcomes  from  
5:154:11267:20:21:90:529:150:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:attending   a   first   choice   school.   Our   results   suggest   that   differing   impacts   across   
5:155:11374:21:21:90:525:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:subgroups  can  be  largely  explained  by  underlying  differences  in  parents’  willingness  to  
5:156:11474:21:20:89:528:108:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:trade  off  expected  gains  in  academic  achievement  for  gains  in  utility  along  other  
5:157:11569:20:0:89:525:88:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:dimensions, such as proximity or school racial composition. More generally, this implies 
6:158:11659:0:20:90:528:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:that  the  impact  of  school  choice  on  academic  outcomes  will  depend  on  both  the  
6:159:11751:20:21:90:527:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:willingness  of  parents  to  make  these  tradeoffs,  and  the  extent  to  which  the  available  
6:160:11851:21:21:90:333:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:school choices require such tradeoffs to be made.  
6:161:11902:21:20:126:526:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:This  paper  proceeds  in  five  main  sections.  The  first  section  lays  the  background  
6:162:11996:20:21:90:525:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:for the data and estimation by describing key details of the CMS school choice plan. The 
6:163:12085:21:21:90:529:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:second  section  outlines  the  relationship  between  expected  academic  outcomes  and  
6:164:12175:21:20:90:527:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:preferences  in  a  school  choice  plan,  where  parents  choose  schools  based  on  expected  
6:165:12272:20:21:90:527:564:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:academic  achievement  and  other  school  characteristics,  and  students  are  then  granted  
6:166:12368:21:21:90:528:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:admission  to  schools  by  lottery.  In  the  third  section,  we  generate  estimates  of  the  
6:167:12466:21:21:90:526:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:preferences  for  academic  achievement.  We  incorporate  these  preference  estimates  into  
6:168:12561:21:20:90:525:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:our final estimation of the effect of attending a first choice school on academic outcomes. 
6:169:12653:20:21:90:231:481:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The final section concludes.

6:172:12727:20:14:90:162:419:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:  
6:173:12729:14:21:126:522:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Before the introduction of a school choice plan in the fall of 2002, the Charlotte-
6:174:12812:21:21:90:525:384:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Mecklenburg public school district (CMS) operated under a racial desegregation order for 
6:175:12901:21:20:90:525:363:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:three decades. In September 2001, the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals declared the 
6:176:12989:20:21:90:528:343:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:school  district  “unitary”  and  ordered  the  district  to  dismantle  the  race-based  student  
6:177:13088:21:21:90:527:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:assignment  plan  by  the  beginning  of  the  next  school  year.  In  December  of  2001,  the  
6:178:13186:21:20:90:461:301:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:school board voted to approve a new district-wide public school choice plan. 
6:179:13263:20:21:126:526:281:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:    In  the  spring  of  2002,  parents  were  asked  to  submit  their  top  three  choices  of  
6:180:13361:21:21:90:527:260:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:school  programs  for  each  child.  Each  student  was  assigned  a  “home  school”  in  their  
6:181:13458:21:20:90:525:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:neighborhood, often the closest school to them, and was guaranteed a seat at this school. 
6:182:13548:20:21:90:525:219:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Magnet students were similarly guaranteed admission to continue in their current magnet 
6:183:13636:21:21:90:525:198:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:programs. Admission for all other students was limited by grade-specific capacity limits 
6:184:13725:21:20:90:530:177:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:set   by   the   district.   Students   could   choose   any   school   in   the   district.   However,   
6:185:13831:20:21:90:525:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:transportation was only guaranteed to schools in a student’s quadrant of the district (the 
6:186:13922:21:21:90:525:136:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:district was split into 4 quadrants called ‘choice zones’). The district allowed significant 
6:187:14015:21:21:90:525:115:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:increases in enrollment in many schools in the first year of the school choice program in 
6:188:14105:21:0:90:524:94:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:an expressed effort to give each child one of their top three choices. In the spring of 2002, 
7:189:14200:0:20:90:526:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the  district  received  choice  applications  for  approximately  105,000  of  110,000  students.  
7:190:14300:20:21:90:526:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Admission  to  over-subscribed  schools  was  determined  by  a  lottery  system  as  described  
7:191:14397:21:21:90:128:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:below.  
7:192:14405:21:20:126:525:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Once the district was declared “unitary” and the court order requiring race-based 
7:193:14487:20:21:90:528:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:busing  was  terminated,  they  could  no  longer  draw  boundaries  based  on  the  racial  
7:194:14580:21:21:89:525:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:composition  of  a  neighborhood.  As  a  result,  the former school assignment zones, which 
7:195:14673:21:20:89:526:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:often paired non-contiguous black and white neighborhoods, were dramatically redrawn. 
7:196:14759:20:21:89:527:564:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Under  the  choice  plan,  43  percent  of  parcels  were  assigned  to  a  different  elementary  
7:197:14858:21:21:89:525:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:grade ‘home school’ than they were assigned to the year before under the busing system. 
7:198:14946:21:21:89:528:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:At  the  middle  school  and  high  school  levels  this  number  was  52  and  35  percent  
7:199:15039:21:20:89:526:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:respectively.  Therefore,  the  2002-2003  home  school  for  many  students  is  often  not  the  
7:200:15138:20:21:90:528:481:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:school  they  would  have  been  assigned  at  the  time  they  chose  their  residence.  This  
7:201:15234:21:21:90:525:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:dramatic change in school assignment zones, the simultaneous introduction of a sweeping 
7:202:15322:21:20:90:527:439:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:school  choice  plan,  and  the  assignment  of  students  to  high-demand  schools  by  lottery  
7:203:15420:20:21:90:525:419:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:provides a unique opportunity to estimate parental preferences for schools and model the 
7:204:15509:21:21:90:452:398:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:heterogeneous impact of attending a chosen school on academic outcomes.

7:207:15601:20:21:125:526:336:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:  Approximately  one  third  of  the  schools  in  the  district  were  oversubscribed.  The  
7:208:15695:21:20:90:525:315:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:district implemented a lottery system for determining enrollments in those oversubscribed 
7:209:15785:20:21:90:529:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:schools.  Under  the  lottery  system,  students  choosing  non-home  schools  were  first  
7:210:15877:21:21:90:527:274:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:assigned  to  priority  groups  and  student  admission  was  then  determined  by  a  lottery  
7:211:15973:21:21:90:527:253:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:number.  The  priority  groups  for  district  schools  were  arranged  in  lexicographic  order  
7:212:16071:21:20:90:252:232:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:based on the following priorities:

8:237:17829:20:21:89:525:357:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:choice-maximizer,’ in which slots were first assigned to all those listing a given school as

8:239:18028:21:20:89:527:315:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:such  a  mechanism,  parents  with  poor  home  school  options  may  have  an  incentive  to  
8:240:18123:20:21:89:528:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:misstate  their  preferences  –  not  listing  their  most  preferred  school  if  it  had  a  low

8:243:18404:21:20:89:527:232:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:a  less  preferred  option  with  a  higher  probability  of  admission  in  order  to  avoid  being  
8:244:18506:20:21:89:525:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:assigned to their home school. Such strategic behavior would imply that student choices 
8:245:18594:21:21:89:526:191:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:would  not  reflect  true  preference  orderings  for  schools—to  the  extent  that  students  are  
8:246:18695:21:36:89:421:170:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f2:not listing their preferred match due to strategic hedging on quality.

9:253:19107:0:20:126:528:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:However,  there  were  a  number  of  reasons  why  such  strategic  behavior  was  
9:254:19191:20:21:90:526:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:probably  rare  in  the  first  year  of  the  choice  plan  that  we  are  studying.  First,  parents  did  
9:255:19300:21:21:90:525:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:not know the details of how the lottery system would be operated. The handful of district 
9:256:19390:21:20:90:525:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:officials who knew the lottery details were not allowed to communicate them to parents. 
9:257:19478:20:21:90:525:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Parents  were  never  given  their  actual  lottery  numbers.  The  district  also  told  parents  that  
9:258:19583:21:21:90:526:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:they  would  make  every  attempt  to  give  each  student  admission  to  one  of  their  chosen  
9:259:19682:21:20:90:525:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:schools, and instructed them to list what they wanted. In order to accommodate demand, 
9:260:19769:20:21:90:526:564:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the  district  substantially  expanded  capacity  at  popular  schools.  In  addition,  the  district  
9:261:19872:21:21:90:528:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:gave  a  ‘priority  boost’  to  low-income  students  choosing  to  attend  schools  with  low  
9:262:19968:21:21:89:526:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:concentrations  of  low  income  students.  Hence,  choices  for  top  schools  by  students  with  
9:263:20068:21:20:89:526:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:under-performing  home  schools  would  be  given  top  priority.  This  would  counteract  the  
9:264:20165:20:21:89:424:481:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:incentive for these students to hedge their choices as outlined above.  
9:265:20237:21:21:125:526:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:If  there  were  widespread  strategic  behavior  by parents, we would  expect  those

9:267:20427:20:21:89:524:419:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:which they might have a higher probability of admission. In another paper, Hastings et al. 
9:268:20518:21:21:89:526:398:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:(2006a),  we  test  whether  parents  with  exogenous  changes  in  the  quality  of  their  default

9:271:20813:21:21:89:528:336:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:uncertainty  about  the  mechanism  and  the  newness  of  the  system,  we  did  not  find

10:297:22834:20:21:90:392:481:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:therefore generate differential gains in academic achievement.

11:329:25432:20:21:90:525:416:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:parent of a student in a neighborhood served by a low-performing school or the parent of 
11:330:25521:21:21:90:525:395:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:a minority student who wants her child to attend a school with same-race peers may give

11:332:25699:20:21:90:527:354:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:enough  to  counter-balance  her  preferences  for  non-academic  factors.  Hence,  this  basic  
11:333:25796:21:21:90:526:333:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:framework  generates  the  prediction  that  the  expected  treatment  effect  is  positive  for  all  
11:334:25899:21:20:90:528:312:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:students  with  a  strong  preference  for  academic  achievement.  Among  students  with  
11:335:25990:20:21:90:525:292:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:weaker preferences for academic achievement, the expected treatment effect will depend 
11:336:26077:21:21:90:524:271:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:on the tradeoffs that parents face. The treatment effect could even be negative if expected 
11:337:26169:21:21:90:527:250:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:academic  achievement  is  sufficiently  negatively  correlated  with  other  valued  school

13:386:30115:24:21:89:525:500:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:model because school test scores are assumed to influence utility only through their effect 
13:387:30207:21:25:89:526:479:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:on  academic  achievement,  whereas  other  school  characteristics  inijZ  may  affect  utility

13:390:30506:25:21:89:527:407:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:academic  achievement  depends  on  observable  school  characteristics  and  idiosyncratic

13:392:30695:25:23:90:528:361:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:than  impose  additional  assumptions,  our  analysis  focuses  on  the  more  fundamental  
13:393:30787:23:24:90:525:338:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:implication that parents placing a high weight on school test scores (high-Aiβ) should be 
13:394:30877:24:21:89:526:314:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:more  likely  to  choose  schools  that  increase  their  child’s  academic  achievement.  While  
13:395:30975:21:20:89:526:293:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:parents  may  prefer  schools  with  high  test  scores  for  non-academic  reasons as well (e.g., 
13:396:31074:20:21:89:527:273:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:status  or  social  connections),  it  is  reasonable  to  assume  academics  are  their  primary  
13:397:31173:21:21:89:526:252:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:concern.  An  important  benefit  of  this  approach  is  that  we  do  not  have  to  completely  
13:398:31272:21:36:89:532:231:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:specify   how   school   and   student   characteristics   combine   to   produce   academic

13:400:31415:7:14:90:525:188:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:10  Note  that  estimation  involves  normalizing  the  variance  of  εij.  Since  Var(εij  )is  an  increasing  function  of

13:402:31543:8:0:98:284:166:41:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f2:iβ,  normalization  will  reduce  the  estimate  of  
13:403:31596:0:8:294:298:174:41:g_d0_f6:41:g_d0_f6:A

13:406:31612:8:14:348:525:166:41:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f2:iβ  types.    While  this  will  act  to  understate

13:408:31778:17:11:89:466:135:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:respect to Aiβ – which is the information we use to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects. 
13:409:31872:11:16:90:524:124:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:11  For example, if Aij = Xjβi + vij and Vij = Zijγi + ωij, with vij i.i.d. normal and ωij i.i.d. extreme value, and 
13:410:31989:16:11:89:525:108:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:no  common  variables  in  X  and  Z,  then  one  can  estimate  E(∆A|∆U>0)  directly  from  the  random  utility  
13:411:32104:11:12:89:524:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:model.  We estimated models of this form and found that they performed poorly in terms of predicting the

13:413:32326:11:0:89:408:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:necessary student-choice level idiosyncratic parameters were poorly identified. 
14:414:32408:0:20:90:527:708:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:achievement:  we  just  need  to  know  that  academic  achievement  was  important  to  the

15:491:35357:21:21:89:525:543:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:However,  the  posterior  weight  also  captures  baseline  information  on  how  the  choice  of

15:513:37149:7:16:90:524:124:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:14 We use the average test scores at the end of the first year of choice instead of those at the end of the year

16:527:38388:21:21:89:525:522:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:school choice data and experiment are helpful for identifying preferences in our demand 
16:528:38476:21:20:89:525:501:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:estimation. First, the large scale redistricting that occurred with the introduction of school 
16:529:38571:20:21:90:530:481:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:choice  helps  to  identify  preference  parameters  separately  from  residential  sorting.  
16:530:38665:21:21:90:530:460:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Without   redistricting   and   the   multiple-choice   responses,   residential   sorting   would   
16:531:38766:21:20:90:527:439:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:potentially  confound  the  preferences  for  proximity  with  preferences  for  other  desired  
16:532:38863:20:21:90:187:419:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:school attributes. 15

16:537:39265:21:20:89:527:315:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:nearly  the  entire  student  population—whereas  most  work  using  school  choice  data  has  
16:538:39361:20:21:89:497:295:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:been dependent on limited and potentially non-representative subgroups of students. 
16:539:39445:21:21:126:527:274:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Fourth,  the  multiple  responses  create  variation  in  the  choice  set  by  effectively  
16:540:39538:21:21:90:529:253:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:removing  the  prior  chosen  school  from  the  subsequent  choice  set.  This  choice-set  
16:541:39631:21:20:90:526:232:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:variation  allows  us  to  estimate  the  distribution  of  preferences  for  school  characteristics  
16:542:39734:20:21:90:526:212:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:from  observed  substitution  patterns  for  each  individual  –  a  stronger  source  of  variation  
16:543:39836:21:21:90:527:191:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:for  identification  than  cross-sectional  changes  in  the  choice  set  based  on  geographic  
16:544:39934:21:15:90:526:170:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:location  (Train  (2003),  Berry,  Levinsohn,  and  Pakes  (2004)).  Intuitively,  when  only  a

16:546:40080:8:16:90:524:147:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:15 In addition, multiple choices listed by those selecting their home school first further separates preferences 
16:547:40193:16:11:90:526:131:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:for  school  characteristics  from  residential  sorting  by  simulating  the  unavailability  of  the  neighborhood  
16:548:40311:11:12:90:525:120:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:school.  For  a  comparison  of  preference  estimates  for  the  redistricted  sub-sample  versus  the  full  sample,  
16:549:40431:12:11:90:527:108:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:please  see  Hastings,  Kane  and  Staiger  (2006a).  They  show  that  preferences  are  very  similar  for  the  
16:550:40546:11:7:90:336:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:redistricted subsample of students relative to the population.  
16:551:40610:7:16:90:521:90:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:16  Hastings  et  al.  (2006a)  show  that  average  distance  to  a  top-tier  school  is  the  same  across  all  socio-
16:552:40732:16:0:90:164:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:economic groups. 
17:553:40751:0:21:90:526:708:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:single  (1st)  choice  is  observed  for  every  individual,  it  is  difficult  to  be  sure  whether  an  
17:554:40859:21:26:90:525:687:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:unexpected choice was the result of an unusual error term (ijε) or unusual preferences by 
17:555:40949:26:24:90:526:661:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the  individual  (iβ)  for  some  aspect  of  the  choice.  However,  when  an  individual  makes  
17:556:41048:24:21:89:525:637:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:multiple choices that share a common attribute (e.g. high test scores) we can infer that the 
17:557:41141:21:20:89:525:616:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:individual has a strong preference for that attribute, because independence of the additive 
17:558:41233:20:21:89:526:596:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:error  terms  across  choices  would  make  observing  such  an  event  very  unlikely  in  the  
17:559:41330:21:21:89:244:575:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:absence of a strong preference.  
17:560:41363:21:21:125:529:554:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:The   final   estimation   sample   includes   36,816   students   entering   grades   4-8.   
17:561:41457:21:20:90:525:533:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Estimation is limited to these grades because of the lack of test scores (either baseline or 
17:562:41550:20:21:90:525:513:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:school test scores) in other grades. The means and standard deviations of these variables

17:566:41933:21:21:90:525:430:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:estimates were precisely estimated and statistically different from zero at less than the 1

17:569:42209:21:21:90:526:368:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:is  focused  around  the  parameters  most  relevant  for  our  final  estimation  of  the  effect  of  
17:570:42313:21:21:90:525:347:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:attending a first choice school on academic achievement. For a further discussion of the 
17:571:42402:21:20:90:527:326:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:results  and  their  implications  for  student  sorting  and  competition  on  quality  in  public

17:573:42555:21:21:126:526:285:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:The  first  four  rows  of  coefficients  in  Table  III  report  the  preferences  for  school  
17:574:42652:21:20:90:526:264:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:test  scores  by  race  and  lunch-recipient  status.  The  first  row  of  coefficients  reports  the  
17:575:42756:20:21:90:528:244:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:mean  preference  for  school  scores  for  the  average  student.  It  is  positive  for  all  four  
17:576:42858:21:21:90:525:223:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:demographic groups, implying that school test scores have a positive effect on choosing a 
17:577:42948:21:20:90:527:202:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:school  for  the  average  student.    For  a  student  with  average  baseline  test  scores  and  
17:578:43048:20:21:90:526:182:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:average  income,  the  mean  preference  for  school  scores  is  larger  for  non-white  students  
17:579:43148:21:21:90:525:161:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:(1.80) than for white students (1.17) among students not receiving lunch subsidies. These 
17:580:43238:21:21:90:526:140:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:coefficients  imply  that  a  0.1  increase  in  average  test  scores  at  a  school  (one  tenth  of  a  
17:581:43345:21:20:90:526:119:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:student-level  standard  deviation)  is  associated  with  a  10%-20%  increase  in  the  odds  of  
17:582:43445:20:0:90:526:99:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:choosing that school for an average student not receiving lunch subsidies. Preference for 
18:583:43537:0:20:90:526:708:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:school  scores  among  students  receiving  lunch  subsidies  are  lower  for  both  whites  and  
18:584:43635:20:21:90:436:688:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:nonwhites, but the difference between whites and nonwhites is similar.  
18:585:43707:21:21:126:528:667:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:We  also  allow  the  mean  preference  for  school  test  scores  to  vary  with  the  
18:586:43795:21:20:90:525:646:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:student’s baseline test score and their neighborhood income level.17 The third and fourth 
18:587:43885:20:21:90:525:626:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:rows of parameter estimates report the coefficient on the interaction of school scores with 
18:588:43977:21:21:90:526:605:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:income  and  the  student’s  baseline  score  respectively.18  The  coefficients  on  the  income  
18:589:44076:21:20:90:525:584:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:interaction imply that mean preferences for a school’s test score (conditional on its racial 
18:590:44169:20:21:90:528:564:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:composition)  are  increasing  with  income.  The  magnitudes  of  these  parameters  are  
18:591:44260:21:21:90:525:543:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:roughly  consistent  with  the  differences  in  the  mean  preferences  for  test  scores  between  
18:592:44361:21:21:90:525:522:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:lunch-recipients and non-lunch recipients within race. Similarly, the mean preference for 
18:593:44451:21:20:90:527:501:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:school  scores  is  increasing  in  the  student’s  baseline  test  score.  The  coefficient  on  the  
18:594:44554:20:21:90:526:481:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:interaction  between  the  student’s  baseline  test  score  and  the  school  mean  test  score  is  
18:595:44656:21:21:90:525:460:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:positive - implying that those with higher test scores relative to their baseline peer group 
18:596:44749:21:20:90:528:439:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:value  a  school’s  test  scores  more.  The  effect  of  a  student’s  baseline  score  on  the  
18:597:44847:20:21:90:526:419:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:preference  for  school  test  scores  is  similar  in  magnitude  to  the  effect  of  income.  A  one  
18:598:44952:21:21:90:525:398:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:standard deviation increase in the baseline test score is associated with a 0.3-0.6 increase 
18:599:45045:21:20:90:526:377:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:in the mean preference for school test scores, while a one standard deviation increase in 
18:600:45135:20:21:90:526:357:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:neighborhood  income  (about  $25,000)  is  associated  with  a  0.3-0.4  increase  in  the  mean  
18:601:45234:21:21:90:251:336:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:preference for school test scores. 
18:602:45269:21:20:126:527:315:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:The  coefficients  on  the  interactions  of  income  and  baseline  score  with  school  
18:603:45359:20:21:90:529:295:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:scores  demonstrate  that  preferences  for  school  test  scores  vary  considerably  with  
18:604:45452:21:21:90:525:274:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:observable characteristics. Parameter estimates for the standard deviation in idiosyncratic 
18:605:45544:21:21:90:525:253:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:preferences for academics are reported in Row 2. While differences in baseline test scores 
18:606:45635:21:20:90:524:232:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:and income each generate a standard deviation in preferences of roughly 0.3-0.6 based on 
18:607:45724:20:21:90:529:212:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the  calculations  from  the  previous  paragraph,  the  estimated  standard  deviation  in  
18:608:45817:21:21:90:525:191:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:idiosyncratic preferences for school test scores is also around 0.3 for non-whites and 0.65 
18:609:45909:21:15:90:526:170:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:for  whites.  Hence,  there  is  substantial  unobserved  heterogeneity  in  preferences  for  test

18:611:46058:8:16:90:525:147:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:17  For  students  who  are  eligible  for  lunch  subsidies,  we  did  not  include  the  interaction  with  neighborhood  
18:612:46182:16:11:90:525:131:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:income  because  all  of  these  students  are  presumably  very  low  income.  In  initial  specifications  using  a  
18:613:46301:11:12:90:524:120:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:conditional logit, income interactions with the preference for school scores were generally insignificant for 
18:614:46411:12:7:90:210:108:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:the lunch-recipient segments. 
18:615:46441:7:16:90:526:101:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:18  Recall  that  both  neighborhood  income  and  the  student’s  baseline  score  are  “de-meaned”,  so  that  the  
18:616:46559:16:11:90:525:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:coefficient  on  the  main  effect  of  school  score  measures  the  value  of  school  test  score  for  a  student  with  
18:617:46684:11:0:90:331:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:average income and baseline test score (both equal to zero). 
19:618:46747:0:20:90:528:708:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:scores.  The  substantial  variation  across  students  in  the  weight  placed  on  academics  
19:619:46843:20:21:89:525:688:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:suggests that we may expect to see strong school choice selection on academic outcomes 
19:620:46930:21:21:89:528:667:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:for  some  students  and  not  for  others.  The  fact  that  much  of  the  heterogeneity  in  
19:621:47026:21:20:89:529:646:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:preferences   is   unobservable   implies   that   the   traditional   approach   of   allowing   the   
19:622:47130:20:21:89:525:626:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:treatment effect to vary with observable characteristics, such as race or lunch status, may 
19:623:47222:21:21:89:507:605:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:not completely capture heterogeneous treatment effects by preferences for academics.  
19:624:47308:21:20:126:526:584:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:The  parameter  estimates  for  the  remaining  coefficients  indicate  that  parents  face

19:626:47487:21:21:89:525:543:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Rows 5 and 6 report the parameter estimates for the lognormal distribution of preferences 
19:627:47577:21:21:89:526:522:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:for  distance.  Rows  7  and  8  report  the  mean  preference  and  standard  deviation  for  the  
19:628:47677:21:20:89:532:501:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:neighborhood    (or    ‘home’)    school.19    Parents    dislike    distance    and    prefer    their    
19:629:47784:20:21:90:526:481:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:neighborhood  school.  These  coefficients  indicate  that  the  average  parent  must  trade-off  
19:630:47883:21:21:89:525:460:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:utility for proximity in order to gain utility from expected academic outcomes. For most 
19:631:47972:21:20:89:525:439:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:students,  attending  a  high-achieving  school  will  require  them  to  choose  a  school  that  is  
19:632:48075:20:21:89:524:419:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:farther than their home school and a school that is not their home school. Hence there is a 
19:633:48167:21:21:89:525:398:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:negative correlation between school characteristics that measure proximity and those that 
19:634:48257:21:20:89:526:377:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:capture  academic  achievement.  This  implies  that  parents  of  all  races  must,  on  average,  
19:635:48357:20:21:89:427:357:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:trade-off utility for academic gains against utility gains for proximity.

19:638:48616:20:21:89:527:295:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:coefficients  on  percent  black  imply  that  the  average  African  American  parent  prefers  
19:639:48713:21:21:89:526:274:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:schools  where  approximately  70%  of  the  student  body  population  is  black  (the  peak  of

19:643:49114:21:21:89:527:191:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:test  scores  and  racial  composition  implies  that  African  American  parents  must  value  
19:644:49210:21:20:89:525:170:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:academic achievement much more than their white counterparts in order to induce them 
19:645:49295:20:30:89:525:150:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:to choose a higher performing school that also has, on average, fewer African American

19:647:49430:7:16:90:519:113:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:19 Hastings et al. (2006a) discuss the interpretation of the neighborhood school. They test if this coefficient 
19:648:49542:16:12:90:501:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:represents a non-linearity in the preference for proximity or if it is potentially consistent with a default 
19:649:49651:12:11:90:523:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:effect. They provide evidence that the preference for the neighborhood school is a neighborhood preference 
19:650:49758:11:0:90:259:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:that is not generated by default behavior.  
20:651:49804:0:20:90:526:708:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:students.  Given  the  coefficients  for  the  quadratic  term  in  racial  preferences,  the  loss  in  
20:652:49909:20:21:90:526:688:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:utility  for  black  families  is  highest  when  percent  black  is  low  (less  than  40%),  which  is  
20:653:50015:21:21:90:413:667:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:precisely the range in which school average test scores are highest. 
20:654:50084:21:20:125:525:646:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Based on the estimates in Table III, we used (8) to calculate a posterior estimate 
20:655:50167:20:21:89:525:626:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:of the weight that each parent placed on academics when choosing schools for their child. 
20:656:50257:21:21:89:526:605:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Table  IV  reports  the  means  and  standard  deviations  for  these  posterior  weights  by  the  
20:657:50357:21:20:89:527:584:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:four  demographic  subgroups  used  in  TableIII.  There  is  considerable  variation  in  these  
20:658:50455:20:21:89:525:564:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:posterior  weights  in  our  sample,  with  a  standard  deviation  that  is  more  than  one  half  of  
20:659:50560:21:21:89:529:543:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the   sample   mean   (0.845   versus   1.348).   The   mean   posterior   weights   vary   across   
20:660:50661:21:21:89:525:522:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:demographic subgroups as expected: however, there is also considerable variation in the 
20:661:50749:21:20:89:525:501:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:posterior weights within each subgroup. This implies that parents’ reasons for choosing a 
20:662:50839:20:21:89:528:481:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:school  can  differ  substantially  across  race  and  lunch  subsidy  status;  two  prominent

20:671:51361:20:21:89:525:295:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:choosing schools that were over-subscribed and limit our sample to the marginal priority 
20:672:51450:21:21:89:524:274:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:groups within those schools for whom lottery number alone determined initial admission. 
20:673:51538:21:21:89:526:253:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:We  ignore  members  of  priority  groups  in  which  all  students  were  either  admitted  or  
20:674:51635:21:20:89:528:232:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:denied  admission—since  the  assignment  of  lottery  numbers  had  no  impact  on  their  
20:675:51727:20:21:89:526:212:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:admission  status.  This  allows  us  to  use  the  random  admission  of  students  into  a  school,  
20:676:51830:21:21:89:282:191:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:conditional on the school they chose.20  
20:677:51871:21:20:126:524:170:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:We began with the choice forms submitted by 105,706 students in the first year.21

20:682:52330:11:7:89:306:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:also be different for different grade levels in a school. 
20:683:52388:7:16:90:508:90:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:21 Reflecting the district’s intensive outreach efforts, choice forms were received for over 95% of all the 
20:684:52496:16:0:90:200:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:students enrolling that fall. 
21:685:52528:0:20:90:528:708:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:and  students  who  were  admitted  because  of  siblings,  we  were  left  with  a  sample  of  
21:686:52625:20:21:90:527:688:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:37,115.  Of  these,  22,872  listed  their  guaranteed  home  school  (n=19,669)  or  magnet

21:688:52808:21:20:89:527:646:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:7,583  students  were  in  groups  sufficiently  high  on  the  priority  list  that  they  were  not  
21:689:52911:20:21:90:527:626:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:subject  to  the  randomization.  There  were  3,065  students  in  marginal  priority  groups,  
21:690:53008:21:21:90:525:605:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:described above as those priority groups within the schools where slots were allocated on

21:692:53202:20:21:89:527:564:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:were  sufficiently  low  on  the  priority  list  that  all  members  of  the  priority  group  were  
21:693:53304:21:21:90:308:543:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:denied admission and placed on the waitlist.  
21:694:53350:21:21:126:525:522:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Table V compares descriptive statistics on the baseline characteristics of students 
21:695:53434:21:20:90:527:501:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:in  the  marginal  priority  group  to  other  students  in  the  district.  Overall,  students  in  the  
21:696:53540:20:21:90:522:481:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:marginal  priority  group  appear  to  be  fairly  representative  of  students  who  chose  a  non-
21:697:53640:21:21:90:525:460:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:guaranteed school. The only notable differences are that the marginal priority group was 
21:698:53729:21:20:90:527:439:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:more  likely  to  be  eligible  for  lunch  subsidies  than  the  waitlisted  group  (reflecting  the  
21:699:53832:20:21:90:524:419:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:priority given to eligible students), and applied to schools with higher test scores than did

21:701:54019:21:20:90:525:377:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:surprisingly, students choosing non-guaranteed schools differed from students who chose 
21:702:54107:20:21:90:525:357:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:a guaranteed school: they had home schools with lower test scores and higher proportions 
21:703:54196:21:21:90:527:336:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:of  minority  and  lunch-eligible  students,  and  were  more  likely  to  minority,  poor,  and  
21:704:54294:21:20:90:526:315:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:doing  poorly  in  school  themselves.  Thus,  the  marginal  priority  group  should  provide  a  
21:705:54393:20:21:90:527:295:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:reasonable  estimate  of  the  impact  of  attending  one’s  first  choice  school  for  a  typical  
21:706:54494:21:24:90:526:274:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:student  who  chose  a  non-guaranteed  school  (i.e.,  treatment  on  the  treated).  In  addition,  
21:707:54596:24:27:89:526:250:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the final row in Table V shows the mean weight placed on academics (ˆAiβ) for students

21:709:54786:24:20:90:526:199:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:students  in  the  randomized  group  is  very  similar  to  that  for  students  in  the  district  as  a

21:714:55084:8:16:90:506:101:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:22 The low mean weight for students in the admitted group is consistent with the fact that these students 
21:715:55190:16:11:90:488:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:were typically choosing lower-scoring and capacity unconstrained schools, as can be seen from the 
21:716:55288:11:0:90:508:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:differences in sample means for the Average Combined Scores of the chosen school (row 8 in Table V).

22:737:57206:20:21:89:527:287:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:were  in  marginal  priority  groups  but  missing  needed  baseline  characteristics  such  as

22:740:57498:21:20:89:526:224:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:regression  that  included  fixed  effects  for  the  school  program  and  grade  for  which  the  
22:741:57598:20:21:89:526:204:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:lottery  was  conducted.  All  of  the  differences  in  baseline  characteristics  were  small  and  
22:742:57700:21:21:89:525:183:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:not significantly different from zero, verifying that lottery assignment was independent of

23:748:58214:0:20:90:526:708:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:were 53 percentage points more likely to attend their first choice school than the lottery

23:751:58507:21:20:90:524:646:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:shows  that  there  was  no  differential  attrition  across  lottery  winners  and  lottery  losers.24 
23:752:58610:20:21:90:527:626:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:The  remaining  rows  show  that  students  who  won  the  lottery  attended  schools  with

23:755:58869:20:21:125:525:564:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Table VIII presents the results from the instrumental variables regression in (9) on 
23:756:58954:21:21:90:525:543:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:measures of academic outcomes. Among these outcome measures, the average treatment 
23:757:59037:21:21:90:525:522:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:effect is significant and negative for retention rates. Winning the lottery to attend a first 
23:758:59131:21:20:90:526:501:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:choice  school  led  to  a  reduction  in  retentions  –  a  2.3  percentage  point  decrease  of  an  
23:759:59234:20:21:90:527:481:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:average  base  of  2.2%.  However,  we  do  not  find  a  significant  impact  on  absences  or  
23:760:59331:21:21:90:525:460:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:suspensions. In addition, we find that students who are randomized into their first choice

23:773:60365:8:16:90:525:193:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:23 This is the first stage regression for the instrumental variables regression of the impact on test scores of

23:775:60603:11:12:90:525:166:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:those who were given the opportunity to attend their first choice did not do so and, second, some of those 
23:776:60710:12:11:90:526:154:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:who  were  originally  waitlisted  at  their  first  choice  were  subsequently  called  off  the  waitlist.  Overall,  
23:777:60830:11:7:90:489:143:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:approximately 75% of lottery winners and 25% of lottery losers attended their first choice school.   
23:778:60931:7:16:90:525:136:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:24  Average  attrition  rates  were  fairly  low  at  9.8%,  and  consistent  with  estimates  of  inter-county  mobility  
23:779:61054:16:12:90:524:120:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:rates from the Census. The estimated effect of winning the lottery on attrition is small in size (-0.018) and 
23:780:61164:12:11:90:524:108:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:not significantly different than zero, indicating that there was no significant differential attrition by the end 
23:781:61278:11:7:90:220:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:of the 2002-2003 school year.    
23:782:61311:7:16:90:525:90:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:25  Regression  estimates  show  the  same  effect  on  math  and  reading  scores  when  run  separately,  so  we  use  
23:783:61432:16:0:90:258:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:the combined score to improve precision. 
24:784:61475:0:20:90:526:708:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:characteristics of the school chosen. Prior studies have used these subgroups of students 
24:785:61565:20:21:90:525:688:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:who on a priori grounds may have different underlying reasons for choosing schools that 
24:786:61653:21:21:90:524:667:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:may be correlated with the expected treatment effect. Estimates for most of the subgroups 
24:787:61743:21:20:90:526:646:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:remain  insignificant.  However,  the  estimated  treatment  effect  is  positive  and  significant  
24:788:61844:20:21:90:524:626:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:for two of the subgroups (whites, and students with above median income) and there is an 
24:789:61933:21:21:90:529:605:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:apparent  pattern  of  positive  treatment  effects  for  higher  SES  students  and  students  
24:790:62029:21:23:90:265:584:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:applying to higher-scoring schools.  
24:791:62066:23:24:126:524:561:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:The  pattern  of  subgroup  impacts  is  strongly  related  to  the  average  weight  (ˆAiβ) 
24:792:62159:24:21:90:526:537:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:that  parents  place  on  school  test  scores.  Columns  3  and  4  of  Table  IX  report  the  mean

24:794:62356:30:27:89:525:486:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:a positive correlation between ˆAiβ and the estimated subgroup impacts across each of the 
24:795:62446:27:24:90:525:459:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:subgroups. Figure 2 plots the subgroup estimates from Table IX against the mean ˆAiβ for 
24:796:62535:24:20:89:529:435:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:each  subgroup.  The  strong  positive  correlation  between  the  two  (correlation=0.89)  
24:797:62627:20:24:89:525:415:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:suggests that differences in impacts across subgroups may be generated by differences in 
24:798:62716:24:24:89:529:391:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the  underlying  determinants  of  choice,  but  the  large  variation  in  ˆAiβ  within  each  
24:799:62812:24:21:89:526:367:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:subgroup  reported  in  Table  IX,  suggests  that  subgroup  impacts  may  be  insignificant  if  
24:800:62911:21:20:90:530:346:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:differences   in   the   weights   parents   place   on   academics   are   driving   heterogeneous   
24:801:63013:20:24:90:176:326:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:treatment effects. 
24:802:63032:24:24:126:526:302:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:This  evidence  highlights  three  advantages  of  using  estimates  of  ˆAiβ  to  identify

24:804:63222:21:20:89:525:257:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:race and income. First, using a single index, rather than estimating differences in impacts 
24:805:63314:20:21:89:525:237:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:for an arbitrary number of subgroups, increases the precision with which we can identify 
24:806:63403:21:24:89:527:216:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:heterogeneous  treatment  effects  by  exploiting  all  of  the  within  and  between  subgroup  
24:807:63500:24:24:89:528:192:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:variation  in  preferences.  Second,  the  ˆAiβ  incorporate  information  on  the  choice  set,  
24:808:63598:24:23:89:526:168:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:distinguishing between students who pick a good school because it is convenient versus 
24:809:63685:23:24:89:526:145:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:students  who  pick  it  for  its  academics.  Third,  theˆAiβ  give  us  an  economic  interpretation  
24:810:63789:24:21:89:526:121:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:for subgroup impacts, allowing us to evaluate the impact of school choice outside of the 
24:811:63878:21:0:89:525:100:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:estimation sample, and to potentially design school choice plans that address differences 
25:812:63970:0:20:90:529:708:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:in  the  underlying  drivers  of  parental  choice  (Hastings  et  al.  (2007),  Hastings  and

25:814:64086:21:24:126:526:667:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:We  therefore  allow  the  impact  of  attending  a  first  choice  school  on  standardized

26:842:66678:20:21:90:525:688:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:earnings suggest that a 0.1 standard deviation in increase in test scores is worth $10,000

26:859:68139:23:27:90:525:321:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:preferences (high-ˆAiβ) will have a positive gain in academic achievement from attending

27:892:71052:20:21:90:525:235:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:interesting secondary question is whether all students (even those students whose parents

27:894:71236:21:21:90:526:193:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:schools.  Do  students  of  parents  who  place  a  high  weight  on  academics  simply  choose  
27:895:71333:21:20:90:527:172:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:better  schools  in  the  sense  that  any  student  attending  such  a  school  would  receive  a  
27:896:71433:20:21:90:528:152:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:positive  treatment  effect?  If  so,  efforts  to  identify  these  schools  and  steer  students  
27:897:71533:21:21:90:529:131:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:towards   them   may   increase   the   impact   of   school   choice   on   academic   outcomes.   
27:898:71633:21:20:90:529:110:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Alternatively,  academic  gains  may  be  student-school  specific,  with  the  impact  of

28:906:72324:21:20:89:526:584:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:column of the table replicates the base estimates for comparison. The next two columns 
28:907:72411:20:21:89:524:564:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:add an interaction to allow the treatment effect to depend on the difference in average test

28:912:72899:21:21:89:525:454:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:home school), and the results are similar. Since average test scores may be a poor proxy

29:935:74731:21:21:90:527:605:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:scores  than  did  lottery  losers.  Winning  the  lottery  had  only  modest  impacts  on  other  
29:936:74830:21:20:90:462:584:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:outcomes, such as increasing homework time and reducing grade retentions.  
29:937:74905:20:21:126:525:564:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:However, parents seem to choose schools for many different reasons.  Indeed, one 
29:938:74986:21:21:90:525:543:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:quarter of parents were willing to switch chose schools with lower mean test scores than 
29:939:75075:21:21:90:525:522:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:their assigned schools. Overall, the results presented in this paper imply that the impact of 
29:940:75169:21:20:90:525:501:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:attending one’s first choice school on academic outcomes is significantly increasing with 
29:941:75259:20:21:90:525:481:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the value that students parents placed on test scores when choosing a school. Students of 
29:942:75349:21:21:90:525:460:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:parents who placed a high weight on school test scores experienced gains in tests scores 
29:943:75438:21:20:90:524:439:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:as a result of attending the first-choice school. In contrast, students of parents who placed 
29:944:75532:20:21:90:525:419:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:a low weight on school test scores experienced (insignificant) declines in test scores as a 
29:945:75624:21:21:90:303:398:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:result of attending their first-choice school.  
29:946:75672:21:20:126:522:377:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A number of recent papers have found no impact on average of attending a first-
29:947:75751:20:21:90:526:357:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:choice  school  on  academic  achievement.  Our  evidence  suggests  that  the  absence  of  any  
29:948:75849:21:21:90:527:336:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:academic  gains  on  average  does  not  imply  that  school  choice  is  ineffective.  On  the  
29:949:75946:21:20:90:525:315:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:contrary,  parents  appear  to  get  what  they  want.  When  parents  want  improved  academic  
29:950:76043:20:21:89:525:295:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:outcomes, they are able to get them. When parents value other school attributes, and are 
29:951:76132:21:21:89:526:274:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:willing  to  trade  off  academic  gains  for  utility  gains  on  other  dimensions,  school  choice  
29:952:76235:21:21:89:527:253:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:will  allow  them  to  make  that  choice—even  if  maximizing  parental  utility  does  not  
29:953:76329:21:20:89:526:232:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:maximize  academic  achievement.  In  general  the  marginal  impact  of  school  choice  on  
29:954:76423:20:21:90:529:212:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:academic  outcomes  will  depend  on  both  the  willingness  of  parents  to  make  these  
29:955:76515:21:21:90:525:191:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:tradeoffs,  and  the  extent  to  which  the  available  school  choices  require  such  tradeoffs  to
