2:27:583:14:21:89:508:517:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Abstract: In  the present  paper  we  propose  that  in  states  with  relatively  weak  central 
2:28:680:21:20:89:507:496:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:authorities, decision makers had to develop market oriented organisation solutions to 
2:29:766:20:21:89:507:476:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:successfully  face  a  grave  external  threat,  and  these  solutions  proved  to  be  efficient. 
2:30:865:21:21:89:508:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Using  an  interdisciplinary  approach  that  combines  institutional  theory,  history  and 
2:31:958:21:21:89:507:434:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:strategy, we analyse a case study, the use of corsairs (privateers) by England and the 
2:32:1045:21:20:89:508:413:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:United Provinces (Dutch Republic) in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. We have 
2:33:1128:20:21:89:508:393:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:found   that   the development   of   partnership   companies   went   hand   in   hand   for 
2:34:1221:21:21:89:507:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:commercial  and  military  purposes.  English  and  Dutch  privateers  proved  to  be 
2:35:1307:21:20:89:507:351:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:economically  efficient  and  superior  to  the  centrally  planned  war  operations  of  the

2:45:1638:21:20:89:508:144:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:              At  the  beginning  of  the  16th century,  Spain  started  developing  into  the 
2:46:1733:20:15:89:508:124:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:strongest  European  state,  and  establishing  the  world's  biggest  overseas  and  maritime

3:50:2021:0:20:89:508:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:empire, including many  parts of today's Central  and  Latin America (by subduing the 
3:51:2107:20:21:89:508:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Indian  Aztec,  Inca  and  Maya  empires  and  additionally  islands  such  as  Cuba  and 
3:52:2197:21:21:89:508:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Puerto  Rico and  parts  of  Chile) and  areas  such  as  Florida,  California, and today's 
3:53:2287:21:20:89:260:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Philippines and Benelux countries. 
3:54:2321:20:21:89:507:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:             By  the  beginning  of  the  next  century,  the  Spanish  empire  was  in  decline, 
3:55:2419:21:21:89:508:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:having  faced  four  bankruptcies  during  the  long  reign  of  Philip  II,  (died  in  1598)  the 
3:56:2519:21:20:89:507:634:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:loss  of  its  naval  supremacy,  loss  of  today’s  Netherlands  which  became  de  facto 
3:57:2610:20:21:89:508:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:independent during the  Dutch revolt 1568-1648  and de jure in 1648 with the treaties 
3:58:2696:21:21:89:508:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of Westphalia and Muenster, and having been humiliated in a series of naval defeats 
3:59:2780:21:21:89:507:572:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:at the hands of the then new, poor and “upstart” countries of England and the United 
3:60:2865:21:20:89:540:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Provinces (Dutch Republic). It was a historical case of two Davids beating a Goliath.            
3:61:2962:20:21:89:197:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:How did this happen? 
3:62:2982:21:21:89:507:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:               Many  explanations  for  the  decline  of  Spain  have  been  offered,  as  for 
3:63:3077:21:20:89:508:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:example  by North  (1981)  and Kennedy  (1988).  Kennedy  proposed  that  the  Spanish 
3:64:3162:20:21:89:508:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:empire  during  Philip's  reign  undertook  too  many  wars  at  the  same  time: fighting  the 
3:65:3258:21:21:89:508:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Turks  in  the  Mediterranean,  supporting  their  Habsburg  cousins, the  emperors  of  the 
3:66:3349:21:20:89:508:427:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:“Holy  Roman Empire of the  German nation” against  revolted  (mainly  protestant) 
3:67:3432:20:21:89:508:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:princes and regions, the revolted Dutch and furthermore campaigning against England 
3:68:3515:21:21:89:509:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in 1588 with the so-called “Armada”), leading thus to overextension and military and 
3:69:3599:21:21:89:192:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:financial exhaustion. 
3:70:3620:21:20:89:508:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:               North  points  out  the  wrong  and  short-sighted  economic  measures  that  were 
3:71:3718:20:21:89:508:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:adopted by Philip in order to face urgent short-term financial problems, which led to a 
3:72:3805:21:21:89:508:303:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:“wrong” institutional set up in Spain, which inhibited long-term  economic  growth. 
3:73:3889:21:20:89:508:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:One  such  example  is  the “mesta”,  the  union  of  Spanish  owners flocks  of  sheep  that 
3:74:3982:20:21:89:508:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:produced  wool.  Philip  taxed  them  in  a per  head  (of  animals)  tax,  which  was  easy  to 
3:75:4079:21:21:89:508:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:levy,  and  gave  them,  in  exchange,  permission  to  graze  their  flocks  freely, e.g. 
3:76:4169:21:20:89:508:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:prohibited  enclosure.  But non-enclosure meant  that  agriculture  suffered  in  general, 
3:77:4259:20:21:89:404:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:because it made investment in land improvisation non profitable. 
3:78:4323:21:21:89:508:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:              Following  an  institutional  approach,  we  develop  the  thesis,  that  in  countries 
3:79:4425:21:21:89:508:158:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:with  relatively  weak  central  government,  such  as  the  United  Provinces (Dutch 
3:80:4510:21:20:89:508:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Republic) and England in the 16th century (as opposed to Spain which had a relatively 
3:81:4594:20:21:89:508:117:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:strong  central  government),  market  solutions  were  introduced,  tried  and  adapted  to 
3:82:4687:21:0:89:508:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:face various problems, and these solutions proved in the long-run superior to centrally 
4:83:4774:0:20:89:507:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:imposed solutions. Market solutions brought about an efficient institutional set up that 
4:84:4863:20:21:89:212:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:was favorable to growth. 
4:85:4887:21:21:89:508:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:              In  previous  papers,  we  have  analysed  this  in  explaining  the  emergence  of 
4:86:4985:21:20:89:507:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:market institutions for long term trade, especially, the spices trade. Central to this, we 
4:87:5076:20:21:89:508:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:have  analysed  the  emergence  of  joint-stock  companies  and  stock  exchanges (Halkos 
4:88:5165:21:21:89:637:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and Kyriazis 2005; Kyriazis 2006; Kyriazis and Metaxas 2010, 2011).                                                                       
4:89:5298:21:20:89:508:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:             In  the  present  paper,  we  analyse  a  related  institutional  issue,  war  for  profit, 
4:90:5403:20:21:89:508:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:e.g. how England and the UP, countries with weaker central governments, developed 
4:91:5484:21:21:89:508:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:market   solutions, e.g. corsairs   (privateers)   and   their   associated   strategy   and 
4:92:5576:21:21:89:507:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:institutional set up, to wage war successfully against Spain and, after Spain took over 
4:93:5664:21:20:89:508:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Portugal  in  1580,  against  Portugal  too.  The  two  newer  naval  and  maritime nations 
4:94:5756:20:21:89:363:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:challenged successfully the two older maritime empires. 
4:95:5811:21:21:89:507:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:            Related  to  the  institutional  developments,  we  analyse  the  new  set  of  values 
4:96:5910:21:20:89:508:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that were linked to them, as efficient cooperation and coordination mechanisms. More 
4:97:5994:20:21:89:507:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:specifically,  these  particular  values  and  norms  that  emerged  in  the  maritime  sector 
4:98:6089:21:21:89:508:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:were trust and self-reliance (both among the cooperating merchants, their officers and 
4:99:6176:21:20:89:508:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:crews,  who  in  the  case  of  privateering  enterprises  had  a  share  in  profit  and  thus  a 
4:100:6275:20:21:89:508:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:common purpose), self-confidence (achieved through repeated successful enterprises), 
4:101:6360:21:21:89:508:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:but  also  a  first sense of  cohesion,  common  mind,  fairness  and  equality,  even  strong 
4:102:6454:21:21:89:508:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:religious beliefs (perhaps a protestant ethic according to Weber) , and  even, in many 
4:103:6541:21:20:89:314:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cases, friendship and a sense of responsibility. 
4:104:6588:20:21:89:507:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:           These   values   were   essential   for   attracting   and   retaining   crews   for   the 
4:105:6690:21:21:89:508:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:privateering  enterprises  because  they  were  mostly  dangerous  voyages,  too  risky  to 
4:106:6782:21:20:89:507:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:undertake. Thus,  these  new norms  and  values  especially  trust,  reduced  transaction 
4:107:6872:20:21:89:413:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:costs, and in this way helped also promote economic development. 
4:108:6936:21:21:89:508:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:             Such  a  set  of  norms  and  values  promotes also  a  community  of  interests. 
4:109:7030:21:20:89:508:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:People  in  maritime  states  throughout  history,  beginning  from  ancient  Athens (see 
4:110:7120:20:21:89:508:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Kyriazis  and  Economou 2013),  seem  to  have  understood  that  their  direct  or  indirect 
4:111:7213:21:21:89:507:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:participation  in  this  effort  brought  advantages  (although  of  course  in  different 
4:112:7304:21:21:89:475:158:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:degrees) to everyone involved, and thus they were willing to support this effort. 
4:113:7385:21:20:89:507:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:              The paper is organised as follows: In the next section, we present the case of 
4:114:7478:20:21:89:507:117:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:England and the UP having relatively weaker central governments. Then, we go on to 
4:115:7561:21:21:89:508:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:examine  the  institutional  and  organisational  framework  for  privateering.  This  is 
4:116:7651:21:0:89:508:75:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:followed by the analysis of war against Spain-Portugal in the late 16th - beginning of 
5:117:7737:0:20:89:508:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  17th centuries  and  its  economic  effects  on  the  belligerents,  followed  by  our 
5:118:7828:20:21:89:152:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:conclusions.

5:126:8248:21:21:89:508:579:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:were thus a new dynasty and had to take into account the interests of the survivors of 
5:127:8335:21:20:89:508:558:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:the old nobility, but also the commercial interests of cities, new “low” nobility of the 
5:128:8423:20:21:89:433:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:country etc.            
5:129:8436:21:21:89:508:517:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: They  had  to  do  so  even  more  due  to  threats  to  their  dynastic  claims  by  other 
5:130:8528:21:20:89:507:496:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contestants (like queen Mary of Scotland) and religious cleavages. Also, England had 
5:131:8613:20:21:89:508:476:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:a   long   tradition   of   insurrection that   limited   central   power,   most   notably   the 
5:132:8710:21:21:89:507:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:insurrection of the nobles against King John that forced him to grant the Magna Carta 
5:133:8796:21:21:89:508:434:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in 1215 which can be seen as the first constitution of a modern European state (if we 
5:134:8882:21:20:89:508:413:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:accept that some ancient states like Athens and Rome had some kind of constitution, 
5:135:8966:20:21:89:178:393:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:called “politeia”). 
5:136:8985:21:21:89:508:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: Also,  the  gradual  rise  of  parliament  since  at  least  1215,  was  another  pivotal 
5:137:9075:21:20:89:507:351:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:element  to  counterbalance  the  English  kings  absolutism  in  imposing  their  will  in 
5:138:9167:20:21:89:508:331:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:issues   such   as   arbitrary   taxation   (see   North   and   Weingast 1989)   raising   war 
5:139:9262:21:21:89:507:310:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:campaigns without the nation’s consent, or offering special privileges in a specific 
5:140:9347:21:20:89:508:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:groups of the nobility (see, Weir 2001;  O ́Brien 2012). A series of manifestos such as 
5:141:9433:20:21:89:508:269:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the Magna Carta and the simultaneous rise of the English parliament could be seen as 
5:142:9518:21:21:89:507:248:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:a  way  of  a  relative  monitoring  against  royal  absolutism,  or  as  the  gradual  rise  of  a 
5:143:9618:21:21:89:508:227:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:“checks and balances” system, if we interpret those events through the Buchanan and 
5:144:9700:21:20:89:461:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Tullock (1962) spectacles.           
5:145:9726:20:21:89:508:186:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: We  have  to  acknowledge  however, that  some scholars  like  Wallerstein  (1974) 
5:146:9809:21:21:89:508:165:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:argue   that the UP   were   a state  with  “strong”  central  governance, extensive 
5:147:9891:21:20:89:508:144:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:bureaucracy and large mercenary army, with England being the second and France the 
5:148:9973:20:21:89:461:124:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:third In such a classification. He nominates these three cases as a “core”.   
5:149:10046:21:21:89:508:103:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:  What  we  actually  want  to  show  is  that if Wallenstein’s argument is correct, it 
5:150:10132:21:0:89:507:82:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:may  lead  to  some  misunderstanding.  We  will  be  arguing  that  England  and  the  UP 
6:151:10224:0:20:89:508:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:started from a relatively weaker economic condition, and certainly without the means 
6:152:10308:20:21:89:508:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and  resources  of world  empires  such  as Spain  and  Portugal, (which  benefited  from 
6:153:10395:21:21:89:508:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:silver  and  gold  inflows  from  the  New  World,  the  monopoly  of  the  spices  trade  etc.) 
6:154:10491:21:20:89:317:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:combined with weaker central governments.     
6:155:10536:20:21:118:508:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Far from denying his methodology or not  which it may be based on the eye  of 
6:156:10613:21:21:89:508:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the beholder, one primary reason that this argumentation is might be scanty is the fact 
6:157:10700:21:20:89:508:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that Wallerstein dines Spain and Portugal as parts of what he calls core, although there 
6:158:10789:20:21:89:507:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:is an extended bibliography arguing that Spain and Portugal were far more centralized 
6:159:10873:21:21:89:304:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:states than the three cases mentioned above. 
6:160:10917:21:21:89:508:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: For  example,  in  contrast  to  the English policymakers  who  at  least  since  the 
6:161:11002:21:20:89:507:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Elisabethan  era  promoted  a  decentralized  way  of  promoting  overseas  commerce  by 
6:162:11091:20:21:89:508:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the private sector, (see among others Stone 1972; Davis 1973a, 41; De Vries and van 
6:163:11172:21:21:89:507:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:der  Woude 1997) Cameron  (1993 127)  argues  that  any  kind  of  the  Spanish  and 
6:164:11254:21:20:89:508:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Portuguese commercial activity was a part of a monopoly planning being undertaken 
6:165:11336:20:21:89:404:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:by the state.           
6:166:11350:21:21:89:508:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: Wallerstein’s argumentation  concerning  England  is  questioned  also  by Mooers 
6:167:11431:21:20:89:507:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(1991),  while Warwick (1990, 83)  argues  that  England  had  not  a  strong  central 
6:168:11518:20:21:89:508:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:government but  a strong navy, while Weingast (1995) by analyzing English political 
6:169:11601:21:21:89:508:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:institutions before and after the English civil war (1642-51) argues that England could 
6:170:11689:21:21:89:507:365:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:characterized even as a “commonwealth” mainly because i) there was a distinctive 
6:171:11770:21:20:89:507:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relationship  of  governance  between  regional  and  national  level  ii)  because  the  state 
6:172:11866:20:21:89:508:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:had a limited capability and will to impose its policies to the periphery. Weingast calls 
6:173:11954:21:21:89:508:303:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:this   regional   autonomy   in   local-regional   level   of   English   regions   as ‘limited 
6:174:12049:21:20:89:508:282:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:government”, which it appears to be regarded as one of today’s main prerequisites to 
6:175:12133:20:21:89:291:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:proclaim a state as of a federal type.  
6:176:12171:21:21:118:508:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Another indication of the relative weakness of the central state in England, is the 
6:177:12255:21:20:89:508:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:fact that according to contemporary  claims (Palliser 1983, 12) England was the least 
6:178:12339:20:21:89:507:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:heavily  imposed  and  least  indebted  country  in  Europe,  where  according  to  one 
6:179:12427:21:21:89:508:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:estimate total  revenue  of  the  public  sector  reached  less  than  5%  of  GDP (Goldsmith 
6:180:12519:21:21:89:508:158:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1987 19). For example, queen Elisabeth had two important sources of revenue within 
6:181:12597:21:20:89:507:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:her  power,  crown  lands  and  customs,  while  she  depended  on  Parliament  for  the 
6:182:12686:20:21:89:507:117:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:“tenth” and “fifteenth” assessed every three years on laity and clergy and “subsidies”, 
6:183:12774:21:0:89:343:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:granted under extraordinary conditions, mainly war. 
7:184:12826:0:20:118:508:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Even  more,  no  strong  central  authority  existed  in  the  United  Provinces  (Dutch 
7:185:12915:20:21:89:508:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Republic), which, up to 1568 were geographically part of the Spanish Netherlands and 
7:186:13000:21:21:89:507:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:had revolted against them from a mix of political, national, commercial and religious 
7:187:13086:21:20:89:507:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:causes.  Although  the  UP  were  formally  recognized  as  an  independent  nation  only  at 
7:188:13180:20:21:89:508:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the treaties of Westphalia and Muenster of 1648, the majority of the land was already 
7:189:13266:21:21:89:377:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:independent of Spanish rule by the end of the 16th century.  
7:190:13325:21:20:118:508:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The Dutch Republic was formed by seven United Provinces, in which again 58 
7:191:13399:20:21:89:507:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cities  predominated,  with  Amsterdam  being  the  most  important  one.  The  main 
7:192:13484:21:21:89:508:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:centralised  coordinating  body  was  the “States  General” with  representatives  of  the 
7:193:13574:21:21:89:508:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:seven provinces, where each province had one vote and where unanimity was required 
7:194:13657:21:20:89:508:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for  taking  a  decision  binding  on  each  of  them (Davids and t’ Hart 2012). There  was 
7:195:13747:20:21:89:508:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:also  the  office  of  the “stadholder”,  more  or  less  a  head  of  government of  each 
7:196:13837:21:21:89:508:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:province, who had again a representative and coordinating function, an office that was 
7:197:13923:21:20:89:446:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:left vacant for substantial periods of time, for example during 1650-1672. 
7:198:13997:20:21:118:508:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Another federal institution was the Council of State, a committee of 25 persons 
7:199:14077:21:21:89:508:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in which the provinces and the stadholder were represented and which were entrusted 
7:200:14160:21:20:89:507:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:with military, financial and other business, eg. an executive power. The fleet lay under 
7:201:14249:20:21:89:508:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the control of the States General and the “admiral-general”, but the daily direction of 
7:202:14337:21:21:89:367:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:naval affairs was referred to the five Admiralty Colleges. 
7:203:14395:21:21:118:508:365:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:The political system of the UP can be thus called “a democratic  head  on  an 
7:204:14472:21:20:89:508:344:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:oligarchic body”, the head being the States General (where each province had a veto 
7:205:14556:20:21:89:505:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:right  due  to  the  unanimity  rule)  that  were  elected  and  the  body  the  58  semi-
7:206:14646:21:21:89:508:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:independent   cities,   which   were   ruled   by   the   regents   (“Regenten”)   commercial 
7:207:14740:21:20:89:507:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:oligarchy.  It  was  a  decentralised  system  where  the  provinces  and  the  cities  and  in 
7:208:14836:20:21:89:369:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:them the commercial interests, had the stronger position.1 
7:209:14894:21:21:118:508:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Having shown the relatively weaker position of the central authority in England 
7:210:14974:21:20:89:508:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and the UP, we turn to the challenge faced by the two states and their market-oriented 
7:211:15061:20:21:89:508:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:solutions. Due to an “external shock”, the spanish  invasion, both  countries had  to 
7:212:15145:21:22:89:508:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:develop  market  solutions, both  for  trade  (the  private  joint-stock  companies  that 
7:213:15234:22:8:89:236:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:

7:218:15666:17:0:89:91:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman: 
8:219:15667:0:20:89:508:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:developed into the state granted monopolies of the East India Companies, such as the 
8:220:15751:20:21:89:508:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:East Indian Company [EIC] and the Dutch East Indian Company [VOC]) and war (the 
8:221:15825:21:21:89:508:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:joint-stock  companies  for  privateering). Because  these  solutions  were  proved  to  be 
8:222:15916:21:20:89:508:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:superior,  England  and  the  UP  developed  by  the beginning of  the  17th century  into 
8:223:16005:20:21:89:223:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:economically strong states. 
8:224:16032:21:21:89:508:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:              Our main thesis is thus, that a state may be strong due to its market oriented 
8:225:16125:21:20:89:507:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:economy  and  institutions,  even  if  (or,  as  a  stronger  argument,  because  of)  it  has  a 
8:226:16223:20:21:89:508:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relatively  weak  central  government.  Relatively  weaker  governments  leave  a  greater 
8:227:16314:21:21:89:508:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:space for market oriented solutions, and this fosters economic strength and growth. In 
8:228:16401:21:21:89:508:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:opposition  to  relatively  weak  central  governments,  in  states  with  strong  central 
8:229:16492:21:20:89:508:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:powers  like  Spain  and Portugal  and  the  great  contemporary  eastern  empires,  the 
8:230:16581:20:21:89:508:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Ottoman,  Mughal  India  and  the  Ming  China, the  central  power  decides,  coordinates 
8:231:16671:21:21:89:603:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and retains most of the profits or rents (in the form of taxes, custom duties etc.).                                         
8:232:16794:21:20:89:508:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:               In Spain for example, the state itself organised most expeditions to the New 
8:233:16885:20:21:89:507:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:World (like Colombus' expeditions to whom news and ships were provided by Queen 
8:234:16965:21:21:89:507:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Isabella and King Ferdinand) and exploited the new lands discovered. The same was 
8:235:17047:21:20:89:507:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:true for Portugal half a century earlier, where prince Henrique (Henry) the Navigator 
8:236:17133:20:21:89:508:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:organised  the  voyages  of  exploration  and  discoveries  on  behalf  of  the  state.  (Verge- 
8:237:17229:21:21:89:508:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Franceschi 1998). This is of course not to deny that commercial interests existed both 
8:238:17315:21:21:89:507:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in Spain and Portugal, but they were subordinated to the government. An indication of 
8:239:17401:21:20:89:507:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:this is that no joint-stock companies such as the EIC and VOC emerged in Spain and

8:241:17493:21:21:89:508:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:              Further, commercial interests played a minor (or almost non-existent) role in 
8:242:17585:21:20:89:508:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:shaping  policy.  If  they  had  a  saying,  Spanish  traders  would  probably  argue  that 
8:243:17677:20:21:89:507:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Spain's  involvement  in  the  Habsburg  family  German  war  was  a  pure  waste  of 
8:244:17763:21:21:89:507:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:resources and would probably further argue, that the costly wars against the Ottoman's 
8:245:17850:21:20:89:505:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and their North African tributary Barbary states should take a secondary position vis-
8:246:17936:20:21:89:325:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:a'-vis their New World and Asian trade interests. 
8:247:17985:21:21:89:507:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:            Further, public private partnerships, to use a modern term, such as those being 
8:248:18077:21:21:89:507:158:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:created  in  England  and  the  UP,  as  we  will  analyse  further  on,  did  not  happen  in

9:253:18237:20:14:89:92:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
9:254:18237:14:21:118:508:724:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:By the second half of the 16th century, the Spanish Habsburg Empire of Phillip 
9:255:18314:21:20:89:507:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:II  extended  from  its  American  New  World  colonies,  to  the  Philippines  in  Asia,  and 
9:256:18409:20:21:89:508:683:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:included  in  Europe  Spain  itself,  Portugal  (annexed in  1580), the  Low  Countries, 
9:257:18496:21:21:89:508:662:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:Sardinia, Sicily  and the  Kingdom of Naples, and Franche-Compté in today’s France. 
9:258:18580:21:21:89:507:641:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Phillip  II  was  an  ardent  Catholic  like  his  father  Charles  V,  and  saw  himself  as  the 
9:259:18679:21:20:89:508:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:protector  of  the  true  faith  against  heretic  Protestants,  German,  Dutch and  English 
9:260:18771:20:21:89:404:600:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:alike.            
9:261:18778:21:21:89:508:579:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: Religious, economic and political considerations thus made the Spanish empire 
9:262:18856:21:20:89:507:558:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to  fight  against  both  England  of  Elisabeth  I  and  the  Dutch  rebels  of  the  United 
9:263:18950:20:21:89:508:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Provinces   under   William   and   then   his   son   Maurice   of Nassau-Orange who 
9:264:19036:21:21:89:507:517:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:coordinated  the  Dutch  military  effort.  Phillip  sent  armies  against  the  rebels  in  the 
9:265:19133:21:20:89:508:496:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Netherlands  and  prepared  fleets  for  invading  England,  which  culminated with the 
9:266:19220:20:21:89:507:476:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:defeat  of  the  Spanish  Armada  in  1588.  The  Dutch  adopted  a  defensive  strategy  on 
9:267:19313:21:21:89:508:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:land, since their own land forces would not be a match in a pitched battle against the 
9:268:19400:21:21:89:508:434:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Spanish “tercio” regiments,  the  best  infantry  of  the  time.  Their  defence  consisted  of 
9:269:19495:21:20:89:507:413:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:fortresses,  coupled  with  extensive  flooding  of  land  areas  by  opening  dams.  England 
9:270:19589:20:21:89:508:393:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:did not have a land frontier with any Spanish territory and at the time, like the Dutch, 
9:271:19677:21:21:89:293:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:did not yet possess any overseas colonies. 
9:272:19719:21:20:118:508:351:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  Dutch,  being  encircled  on  land  by  Spanish  territories  had  only  one  open 
9:273:19807:20:21:89:508:331:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:way to the rest of the world, the sea. They used it to expand commercially by the end 
9:274:19891:21:21:89:507:310:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of  the  century  making  their  first  attempt  to  capture  the  spices  trade,  which  they  did 
9:275:19991:21:20:89:507:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:successfully complete during the next century. Parallel to this, they attacked the most 
9:276:20079:20:21:89:508:269:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:vulnerable points of the Spanish empire, their maritime commerce with their colonies. 
9:277:20165:21:21:89:507:248:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The English tried also during the same time to actively participate, as newcomers, in 
9:278:20251:21:21:89:507:227:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:international  maritime  trade,  at  first  peacefully,  but  they  encountered  the  hostility  of 
9:279:20351:21:20:89:508:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Spain  in  her  own  territories,  which  sometimes expelled British traders  by  the  use  of 
9:280:20445:20:25:89:508:186:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:force,  as  at  San  Juan  de  Ulua  in  1568.2 The  Spanish,  wanted  to  keep  a  monopoly  of 
9:281:20541:25:8:89:236:161:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:                                                 
9:282:20589:8:22:89:507:153:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:2 John Hawkins and Francis Drake were at the time merchants who tried to break into the Spanish trade 
9:283:20690:22:17:89:506:131:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:monopoly. In September 1568 Hawkins and his five ships was forced to run for shelter into the Spanish 
9:284:20792:17:17:89:508:114:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:harbour  of  San  Juan  de  Ulua.  A  few  days  later  the  Spanish  treasure  fleet  arrived  and  the  Spanish 
9:285:20906:17:17:89:507:97:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:assaulted the English ships, and after a six hour battle only two English ships, Hawkins and Drake’s 
9:286:21007:17:0:89:193:80:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:escaped (Konstam 2000). 
10:287:21030:0:20:89:507:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:trade  with  their  colonies,  which  was  one  of  the  causes  (the  main  economic  one)  for 
10:288:21127:20:21:89:209:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:hostilities with England. 
10:289:21152:21:21:118:508:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Both the English and the Dutch thus went to war against the Spanish trade and 
10:290:21230:21:20:89:507:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:colonies.  For  this,  they  resorted  to  privateering,  using  market  organisation  forms  to 
10:291:21327:20:21:89:508:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:finance  their  expeditions. Queen  Elizabeth  had  started  a  programme  of  building 
10:292:21414:21:21:89:508:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:dedicated  warships  (sailing  galleons)  of  which  she  had  34 in 1588 to  face Armada 
10:293:21502:21:20:89:507:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:campaign, 13 of which were over 500 tons. This represented 18% of the total English 
10:294:21586:20:21:89:508:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:fleet  of  197  ships.  Of  them,  18  were  build  after  1581  and  only  three before  1570 
10:295:21679:21:21:89:508:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(Tincey  1988).  To  these  must  be  added  14 ships  build  before  1564 (Rodger  1997). 
10:296:21768:21:21:89:508:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:This meant that when undeclared hostilities started in earnest by the beginning of the 
10:297:21855:21:20:89:507:551:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:1570’s, there were practically no dedicated warships to carry the war against the 
10:298:21937:20:21:89:133:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Spanish. 
10:299:21945:21:21:118:508:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:During the same period, the Dutch revolt had just started and there were none as 
10:300:22026:21:20:89:507:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:yet  dedicated  Dutch  warships.  On  the  other  hand,  the  distinction  between  dedicated 
10:301:22120:20:21:89:507:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:warships  and  armed  merchantmen  had  just  started  to  emerge.  Most  navies,  the 
10:302:22207:21:21:89:508:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Spanish-Portuguese  included  (which  also  comprised  some  dedicated  warships)  made 
10:303:22295:21:20:89:508:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:up  their  numbers  by using  merchantmen.  Almost  all  merchantmen  were  armed,  and 
10:304:22383:20:21:89:508:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:by  being  up-gunned (with  the  addition  of  more  guns)  and  up-crewed (with  the 
10:305:22467:21:21:89:507:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:addition  of  more  crew  members  to  serve  the  guns  and  in  the  Spanish  navy  with 
10:306:22558:21:21:89:508:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:soldiers to  serve  as  boarders)  the  merchantmen  became  relatively  efficient  men  of 
10:307:22649:21:20:89:117:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:war.3 
10:308:22654:20:21:118:508:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Thus, the English and the Dutch could solve relatively easy the first part of the 
10:309:22736:21:21:89:507:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:challenge, the availability of ships. The solution to the second part was less obvious: 
10:310:22824:21:20:89:508:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Who and how would organise and finance the war operations against the Spanish? In 
10:311:22905:20:21:89:508:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  UP,  were  the  revolt  had  just  started, these  were as  yet  not  even  a  rudimentary 
10:312:23000:21:21:89:507:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:central federal authority to do it. England, as stated above, had some royal ships, but 
10:313:23088:21:20:89:508:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:retained them  for  home  defence,  as  a  fleet  in  being.  Even  more  serious,  the  English 
10:314:23185:20:21:89:461:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:crown did not have adequate finances for overseas expeditions.    
10:315:23247:21:22:89:508:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:  Queen  Mary,  Elizabeth’s  sister  and  predecessor,  inherited  from  her  father 
10:316:23329:22:8:89:236:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:                                                 
10:317:23377:8:23:89:507:149:8:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:3 The  Dutch  were  so  successful  against  the  Spanish  with  this practice  that  they  discovered  quite  late 
10:318:23492:23:18:89:506:126:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:and to their detriment the necessity of dedicated warships. This happened after their defeat during the 
10:319:23596:18:17:89:507:108:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:first Anglo-Dutch  war  of  1652-1654  by  the  English  dedicated  warships,  which  forced  them  to  build 
10:320:23706:17:17:89:380:91:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:their own (see Tincey 1988; Rodger 2004 and Davids and t’ Hart 2012).

11:322:23773:0:20:89:507:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Henry VIII an empty treasury and a heavy foreign debt (owed to foreign bankers). She 
11:323:23858:20:21:89:507:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:managed  her  affairs  with  great  prudence,  a  pattern  followed  by  Elizabeth  after  she 
11:324:23953:21:21:89:508:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:became Queen in 1558. During 1565-1574 she spent on average just £16.000 per year 
11:325:24035:21:20:89:508:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:on  her  Navy  (6,5%  of  total  income).  But  she  had  spent £ 246.380  on  the  fruitless 
11:326:24128:20:21:89:508:676:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:Havre expedition (or about a year’s total revenue) and she also had a considerable 
11:327:24211:21:21:89:508:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:foreign debt (Rodger 1997). Elizabeth out of prudence (learning of the risks and costs 
11:328:24297:21:20:89:508:634:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:of overseas expeditions like Havre’s) and necessity  could  not  finance  herself costly 
11:329:24386:20:21:89:508:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:overseas expeditions against Spanish commerce and New World colonies, out of state 
11:330:24469:21:21:89:507:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:revenues. In  both  the  English  and  the  Dutch  case,  market  solutions  were  found:  the 
11:331:24563:21:21:89:508:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:use of privateers-corsairs for a war for a private at first and public as a second way of 
11:332:24651:21:20:89:433:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:making profit.           
11:333:24665:20:21:89:508:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: During  the  16th century  merchants  in  the  UP  and  England  stared  developing  a 
11:334:24751:21:21:89:508:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:new  form  of  organisation,  joint-stock  companies,  which  in  the  UP  were  called 
11:335:24839:21:20:89:508:489:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:“partenrederij” (partnerships) for maritime trade. Similar forms of organisations were 
11:336:24925:20:21:89:507:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:created  already  in  prototype  forms  in  ancient  and  medieval  maritime  societies,  like 
11:337:25020:21:21:89:507:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Athens,  Rhodes,  Rome,  Venice,  Pisa  and  Genova,  leading  us  to  assert  that  similar 
11:338:25113:21:20:89:507:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:problems  lead  to  similar  solutions  over  the  ages.  The  Italian  experience  may  have 
11:339:25207:20:21:89:508:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:influenced England and the UP, as did Venetian banking influence to the UP banking, 
11:340:25291:21:21:89:507:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  Bank  of  Amsterdam  being  modelled  for  example  on  the  Venetian  bank  de  la 
11:341:25380:21:21:89:508:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Piazza  di  Rialto. In  England,  the  oldest  joint-stock  company were  the  Guinea 
11:342:25464:21:20:89:507:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Adventures,  established  in  1553  for  trade  with  West Africa,  followed  in  1555  by  the 
11:343:25560:20:21:89:391:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Muscovy company for trade with the then Duchy of Moscow.  
11:344:25617:21:21:118:508:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Joint-stock  companies  were  the  best  solutions  to  solve  the  cooperation  and 
11:345:25702:21:20:89:508:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:coordination problem involved in long distance trade and  fishing,  as for example the 
11:346:25789:20:21:89:507:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:firms,  timber  and  cereal  trade  with  Muscovy,  the  hearing  trade  in  the  Atlantic  and 
11:347:25885:21:21:89:507:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:above  all,  the  spices  trade.  In  the  absence  of  a  government  imposed  solution, 
11:348:25975:21:20:89:508:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:merchants  had  to  discover,  probably  through  a  process  of  trial  and  error,  market 
11:349:26068:20:21:89:149:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:solutions.  
11:350:26078:21:21:118:508:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Joint-stock companies emerged as the best one to solve the problem of acquiring 
11:351:26157:21:21:89:507:158:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sufficient capital and making clear the leadership and distribution of profits (or losses) 
11:352:26248:21:20:89:508:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:issues. Overseas   trade   required   substantial   capital and joint-stock   companies 
11:353:26335:20:21:89:507:117:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:permitted  the  pooling  of  resources  and  at  the  same  time,  reduction  of  risk  to 
11:354:26426:21:21:89:508:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:individuals, who would loose only the capital of their shares in joint-stock companies. 
11:355:26514:21:0:89:507:75:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Overseas  trade  required  intensive  coordination  and  cooperation  by  participants,  and 
12:356:26609:0:20:89:507:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:joint-stock  companies  were  the  best  suited  coordination  and  cooperation  mechanism 
12:357:26700:20:21:89:152:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for this task. 
12:358:26714:21:21:118:508:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:There exists substantial and growing literature on coordination and cooperation 
12:359:26794:21:20:89:508:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mechanisms,  mainly  in  the  fields  of  organisation  and  game  theory.  (Malone  and 
12:360:26883:20:21:89:508:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Crowson 1994; Adler  2001;  Kale,  Dyer  and  Singh  2002;  Xu  and  Beamon  2006  and 
12:361:26968:21:21:89:208:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Fink and Kessler 2010). 
12:362:26990:21:20:89:508:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: As  far  as  we  know,  we  apply  for  the  first  time  an  analysis  of  joint  stock 
12:363:27079:20:21:89:508:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:companies   both   for   trade   and   privateering,   as   coordination   and   cooperation 
12:364:27172:21:21:89:508:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mechanisms.  Coordination  and  cooperation  mechanisms  create  a  particular  way  to 
12:365:27259:21:21:89:507:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:find  solutions  to  specific  problems  based  on  shared  information  and  a  set  of 
12:366:27348:21:20:89:508:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:behavioural  rules  in  the  form  of  organisations  by  acting  according  to  specified  and 
12:367:27444:20:21:89:508:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:normalised  rules. Joint-stock  companies  evolved  through  contracts  between  the 
12:368:27529:21:21:89:507:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:stockholders  of  the  company,  and  the  company  and  the  ships,  officers  and  crews 
12:369:27620:21:20:89:449:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(officers and even sailors were sometimes at the same time, stockholders). 
12:370:27694:20:21:89:508:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: The  most  important  consequence  of  cooperation  and  coordination  mechanisms 
12:371:27776:21:21:89:507:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:is that they diminish transaction costs and enhance efficiency. In situations of risk, as 
12:372:27866:21:20:89:507:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the long range trading enterprises, and even more, privateering, cues are evolved and 
12:373:27952:20:21:89:508:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:take  sometimes  even  the  form  of  a  specific  language,  that  helps  lower  transaction 
12:374:28046:21:21:89:508:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:costs in situations in which the risk that someone takes depends on the performance of 
12:375:28133:21:21:89:258:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:another actor (Coleman 1990, 91). 
12:376:28165:21:20:118:508:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Privateering  was  a  highly  risky  (but  also  highly  lucrative  type  of  enterprise. 
12:377:28255:20:21:89:508:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Ships  have  always  been,  as  analysed  by  Kyriazis  (2012)  for  the ancient Athenian 
12:378:28345:21:21:89:508:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:triremes and Rodger (1997) and Ο ́ Brien (2012) for the Elisabethan England English 
12:379:28426:21:20:89:508:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:galleons, the supreme type of coordination and cooperation mechanism, requiring the 
12:380:28510:20:21:89:507:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cooperation  of  many  types  of  specialist  groups,  officers  and  sailors  having  to 
12:381:28600:21:21:89:508:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:undertake different tasks like navigation (position finding), logistics, hygiene, sailing 
12:382:28689:21:20:89:508:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and gunnery in order to  maximize the probability of surviving in battle and attaining 
12:383:28776:20:21:89:505:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:victory.  With  each  successful  enterprise,  the  cooperation  and  coordination  was  fine-
12:384:28870:21:21:89:505:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:tuned,  and  the  values  created  and  associated  with  them,  like  trust,  cohesion,  self-
12:385:28965:21:21:89:500:158:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reliance, self-consciousness, obedience to commands and teamwork, were enhanced. 
12:386:29045:21:20:89:508:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: But  we  would  go  a  step  further,  suggesting  that  cooperation  and  coordination 
12:387:29133:20:21:89:508:117:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mechanisms  and  joint-stock  companies  for  long  distance  trade  and  privateering  were 
12:388:29226:21:21:89:508:96:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:“proto-democratic” institutions. First, because joint-stock companies had meetings of 
12:389:29312:21:0:89:508:75:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:stockholders  where  voting  (according  to  the   number  of  stock  owned  by  each 
13:390:29400:0:20:89:508:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:stockholder) was done, as was the case in ancient and direct democracies, eg, ancient 
13:391:29486:20:21:89:434:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Greek city-states as well as the post-medieval Swiss cities and cantons. 
13:392:29557:21:21:89:507:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: During  the  late  16th–beginning  of  the  17th century,  democratic  voting,  even  if 
13:393:29645:21:20:89:508:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:not  on  political  issues,  was  a  novelty  and  it  helped  introduce a  new  culture  in  the 
13:394:29743:20:21:89:507:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:decentralised  maritime  states.  On  board  privateering  ships,  another  democratic  idea 
13:395:29836:21:21:89:508:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:may  have  become  latent, though not yet  explicit  the  idea  of  common  purpose or 
13:396:29921:21:20:89:508:634:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:“common good”, in the sense that all members of the ship’s crew stood to profit from 
13:397:30005:20:21:89:368:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the successful achievement of the privateering enterprise. 
13:398:30063:21:21:89:508:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: This  common  purpose  or  good  was  both  personal  profit  and  patriotism, even 
13:399:30146:21:21:89:507:572:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:religious fervor against a catholic enemy. This “common good” was near to the ideal 
13:400:30230:21:20:89:507:551:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:of “homonoia”, the supreme democratic ideal as advanced already by ancient Greek 
13:401:30311:20:21:89:346:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:philosophers like Aristotle (“Politics” 1264 a 36-37). 
13:402:30363:21:21:89:508:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: We even suggest that the creation of this specific set of values and norms as the 
13:403:30445:21:20:89:507:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:outcome   of   the   particular   type   of   cooperation   and   coordination   mechanism 
13:404:30536:20:21:89:508:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:represented  by  joint-stock  companies  and  their  ships,  helped  into  the  creation  of  the 
13:405:30634:21:21:89:507:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:preconditions that made England and the UP the most democratic states (together with 
13:406:30719:21:20:89:508:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Switzerland)  in  the  17th century,  an  inquiry  we  pursue to  answer  concerning  also  the 
13:407:30813:20:21:89:508:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cases  of  both  the Achaean  Greek  proto-federation of  the  fourth  century  BC  and  the 
13:408:30906:21:21:89:508:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:United   Provinces,   through   an   interactive   comparative   analysis   (Kyriazis   and 
13:409:30998:21:21:89:220:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Economou, under review). 
13:410:31022:21:20:118:508:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:  The  joint-stock  organisation  form  was  adapted  from  the  trade  sector  to  the 
13:411:31110:20:21:89:507:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:military one, when the necessity arose to combat the Spanish and Portuguese. Instead 
13:412:31195:21:21:89:508:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of searching for a new solution, the adaptation of a proven one was preferred, because 
13:413:31282:21:20:89:507:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:these  led  to  a  reduction  of  transaction  costs.  A  totally  new  solution  would  require 
13:414:31379:20:21:89:507:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:higher transaction costs, for information gathering, drafting of new types of contracts 
13:415:31467:21:29:89:508:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:etc.4 Thus,  when  the  necessity  arose, both  English  and  Dutch  created  joint-stock 
13:416:31556:29:7:89:236:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:                                                 
13:417:31604:7:22:89:507:205:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:4 The  interpretation  we  offer  here  concerning  both  English  and Dutch privateering  activities is an 
13:418:31710:22:17:89:507:183:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:extension  of  Simon's  (1982,  1991) “bounded  rationality”,  which  states  that  the  human  mind  has 
13:419:31816:17:17:89:507:166:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:limitations,  for  example  in  its  capacity  to  absorb  and  use  new  information.  In  real  life,  instead  of 
13:420:31933:17:18:89:507:149:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:searching for an “absolute ideal” (as for example, utility maximisation according to microeconomic 
13:421:32032:18:17:89:508:131:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:theory)  we  try  to  reach a  solution  that  satisfies us,  even  if it  is  not  the  best  possible  one.  Simon  calls 
13:422:32155:17:17:89:508:114:10:g_d0_f9:10:Times New Roman:this behaviour “satisfycing”. This enables us to find acceptable solutions  with minimal expenditure of 
13:423:32258:17:17:89:507:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:time  and  effort,  thus  reducing  transaction  costs.  Satisfycing  behaviour  diffuses  known  solutions  and 
13:424:32371:17:0:89:507:80:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:problem-solving  rules  to  new  problems,  since  this  reduces  again  time  and  effort.  Thus,  a  tried 
14:425:32482:0:20:89:508:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:companies  for  privateering,  where  participants  (in  England  from queen  Elisabeth 
14:426:32570:20:21:89:507:738:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:herself, to merchants and down to even simple sailors and “citizens”) took specific 
14:427:32654:21:21:89:508:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:shares of stock in the company according to their capital invested which entitled them 
14:428:32740:21:20:89:461:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to a similar percentage of prospective profits.       
14:429:32787:20:21:89:508:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: A  strong  element  on  which  joint-stock  companies  were  bases,  apart  from  their 
14:430:32875:21:21:89:508:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:founding  charts,  was  trust. The  relevant  modern  literature emphasizes  trust  as  being 
14:431:32969:21:20:89:508:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:important  for  the  smooth  functioning  of  an  transaction  cost  reducing  mechanism. 
14:432:33059:20:21:89:507:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Trust  has  been  recognised  as  a  lubricant  enabling  organisations  and  societies  to 
14:433:33151:21:21:89:508:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:achieve  Pareto  superior  outcomes  (Arrow 1974;  Fukuyama 1995; Kramer 1999). 
14:434:33227:21:21:89:508:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Trust  among  members  who  formed  partnerships  for  trade,  was  a  basic  element  for 
14:435:33318:21:20:89:508:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:them to form partnerships (in the form mainly of joint-stock companies) for war. This 
14:436:33404:20:21:89:507:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:was  made  easier  since  in  many  cases  the  merchants  participating  in  privateering 
14:437:33495:21:21:89:461:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:enterprises were the same with those participating in peaceful trade.    
14:438:33565:21:20:89:508:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: But  even  before  the  establishment  of  the  companies,  an  amount  of  trust  must 
14:439:33653:20:21:89:507:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:have  existed  (through  personal  ties  of  knowledge  and  information  sharing)  between 
14:440:33745:21:21:89:508:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the original members of the joint-stock companies to be created. This trust is the most 
14:441:33833:21:20:89:507:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:important element that evolves, it is strengthened and permits the smooth functioning 
14:442:33919:20:21:89:508:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of organisations as efficient cooperation and coordination mechanisms. For example, 
14:443:34002:21:21:89:508:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  Englishmen  John  Hawkins,  Martin  Frobisher,  Francis Drake  and  many  others, 
14:444:34088:21:21:89:508:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:started  as  traders, then,  becoming successful  corsairs  and  then  some  were  knighted 
14:445:34179:21:20:89:461:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and served as captains in the war against Spain in 1588 and after.   
14:446:34245:20:21:89:508:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:   Trust  between  captains,  officers  and  men was  a  very  important  element  for 
14:447:34331:21:21:89:507:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:running  a  ship  efficiently,  both  in  trade  and  war.  Ships,  either  merchantmen  or 
14:448:34423:21:20:89:507:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:warships, are another example of cooperation and coordination mechanism. It requires 
14:449:34508:20:21:89:507:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:intensive  cooperation  and  coordination  among  the  captain,  the  officers,  the  sailors 
14:450:34602:21:21:89:508:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:doing  different  tasks,  like  setting  the  sails,  controlling  steering,  making  the  guns  etc. 
14:451:34704:21:20:89:508:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Building   experience  through  repeated  voyages  aboard  the  ships both  enhances 
14:452:34788:20:21:89:508:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:coordination and cooperation, builds trust and thus, increases efficiency. This again is 
14:453:34876:21:70:89:508:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:a  validation  of  the  well-known  dictum  that  it  took  a  few  years  to  build  a  ship,  but 
14:454:34976:70:12:89:508:109:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:                                                                                                                                            
14:455:35115:12:17:89:507:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:organisational  solution,  the  joint-stock  company,  is  transferred  to  a  new  problem,  that  of  organising 
14:456:35230:17:0:89:191:80:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:privateering expeditions. 
15:457:35257:0:20:89:461:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:decades to build and upkeep a naval tradition (Palliser 1983).5    
15:458:35318:20:21:89:508:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:  Privateers and corsairs6 were distinguished from outlaw pirates, since they were 
15:459:35398:21:21:89:508:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:empowered  by  their  governments  to wage  war  against  their  enemies,  but  not  against 
15:460:35490:21:20:89:508:696:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:neutral  states  and  their  own  ships. They received a “letter of marque” or “reprisal” 
15:461:35580:20:21:89:508:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:stating  this,  and  thus  acted  in  a  general  sense  on  behalf  of  their  government (see 
15:462:35675:21:21:89:508:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Rodger 1997). What distinguished them from the official government and state owned 
15:463:35757:21:20:89:507:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:ships was  the  organisation  and  financing  of  their  expeditions  and  their  latitude  in 
15:464:35851:20:21:89:461:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:pursuing their aims.            
15:465:35872:21:21:89:508:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: As  to  the  second,  individual  captains,  or  leaders  of  expeditions  in  cases  where

15:475:36438:20:21:118:508:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In the early days of the Dutch Revolt warfare was dominated by the actions of a 
15:476:36517:21:21:89:508:365:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:bunch of unruly privateers, called “beggars” in contempt by the Spanish, a name 
15:477:36596:21:20:89:508:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:which  they  proudly  took  over  as “Watergeuzen” (Sea  Beggars).  Indeed  the  Sea 
15:478:36680:20:21:89:507:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Beggars  liberated  the  first  Netherlands  territory  from  the  Spanish,  capturing  in  a

15:481:36958:20:21:89:507:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:by  major  cities  like  Amsterdam.  Thus,  the  UP  acquired  the  necessary  ports  for  their 
15:482:37055:21:34:89:495:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:trade expansion, which served also as privateering bases (Parker 1977; Israel 1995).

15:486:37391:12:22:89:507:165:6:Times New Roman:10:g_d0_f9:6 Privateers and corsairs are synonymous, the  first term coming from “private” denoting ownership of 
15:487:37492:22:17:89:507:143:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:the  ship  by  the  captain  or  the  company  (as  against  English  royal  ships  owned  by  the  state-queen). 
15:488:37606:17:18:89:507:126:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:Corsair  comes  from  the  French  “course”  meaning  booty.  As  we  show,  in  some  cases  piracy  and 
15:489:37712:18:17:89:508:108:10:Times New Roman:10:g_d0_f9:privateering  was  indistinguishable. Corsairs could cross over the “red line of legality” and become 
15:490:37813:17:17:89:121:91:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:pirates.

16:492:37823:0:20:118:508:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:During  the  first  two  decades  of  the revolt,  the  port-cities  authorities  were 
16:493:37910:20:21:89:507:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:somewhat  reluctant  to  grant  corsairs  licences,  because  some  privateers  attacked  and 
16:494:38004:21:21:89:508:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:plundered neutral ships, thus endangering the diplomatic efforts of the States General 
16:495:38091:21:20:89:507:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that  worked  for  the  recognition  of  Dutch  independence  by  other  states.  But  in  1598 
16:496:38187:20:21:89:507:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:King Philip of Spain issued an official embargo against the Dutch, forcing the States 
16:497:38273:21:21:89:508:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:General  to  react:  All  goods  and  possessions  of  Spain  were  legitimate  prizes  of 
16:498:38364:21:20:89:507:634:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:privateers.  In  order  to  limit  “outlaw  behaviour”  by  privateers  the  States  General 
16:499:38457:20:21:89:507:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:demanded  a  caution  of  money  of  6.000  guilders,  later  raised  to  20.000,  which  was 
16:500:38551:21:21:89:508:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:forfeited in case of misbehaviour of the captain, eg. if he attacked neutral ships (van

16:505:38917:21:20:89:507:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:States  General  raised  the  bail  and  made  conditions  for  obtaining  privateer  licences 
16:506:39012:20:21:89:508:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:more  difficult,  some  becoming  pirates,  but  more  often,  the  merchants  joint-stock

16:508:39192:21:20:89:508:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:from Dunkirk) like the famous ones, Nicholas Jarry and Pierre le Turcq.  Amsterdam 
16:509:39274:20:21:89:508:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:merchants  soon  followed  the  example  of  the  Zeeland  merchants,  financing  Dunkirk 
16:510:39364:21:21:89:508:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:privateers.  Well-to-do  merchants  from  Middleburg  (in  Zeeland)  engaged  in  the 
16:511:39450:21:21:89:508:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:privateering  business  right  up  to  the  end  of  the  18th century.  Another  Zeeland  port 
16:512:39545:21:20:89:508:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Flushing (Vlissingen) grew into one of the most feared privateering ports of the time

16:514:39655:21:21:118:508:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We  have  within  the  various  cities of  the  early  UP  an  early  manifestation  of 
16:515:39742:21:20:89:507:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:intercity  competition  that  led  in  the  course  of  time  to  some  maritime  specialisation: 
16:516:39840:20:21:89:507:262:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:Amsterdam developed into the most important trading and entrepôt city and thus was 
16:517:39923:21:21:89:508:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:less interested over time into privateering business. Some Zeeland ports, like Flushing 
16:518:40011:21:20:89:507:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and  Middleburg,  which  were  economically  hit  by  the  downfall  of  neighbouring 
16:519:40097:20:21:89:507:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Antwerp  (due  to  a  large  part  to  Dutch  sea  blockade)  specialised  into  the  alternative 
16:520:40195:21:21:89:508:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:maritime  business  form  of  privateering. But  even  Amsterdam  invested  heavily  into 
16:521:40284:21:21:89:508:158:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:privateering  in  an indirect  form through  the  prototype  joint-stock  companies,  the 
16:522:40372:21:20:89:508:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Dutch East  India Company (VOC) established  in  1602  and  the  West  Indian  one. 
16:523:40453:20:21:89:508:117:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Amsterdam  financial  interests  were  predominant  in  both (Kyriazis  and Metaxas 
16:524:40535:21:21:89:461:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2011).             
16:525:40541:21:0:89:508:75:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: The  VOC  played  an  important  role  by  undertaking  large-scale  privateering

17:527:40717:20:21:89:508:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  West  Indian  Company (WIC) was  even  more  successful  in  its  privateering 
17:528:40801:21:21:89:507:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:expeditions,  its  biggest  success  coming  in  1628,  when  a  company  fleet  commanded 
17:529:40892:21:20:89:508:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:by  Piet  Heyn  managed  to  capture  one  Spanish “plata” (silver) fleet  off  Matanzas  in 
17:530:40983:20:21:89:507:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Cuba.  It  was  the  only  time  in  history  that  an  entire  Spanish  treasure  fleet  was 
17:531:41077:21:21:89:433:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:captured.             
17:532:41087:21:20:89:508:634:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9: This  not  only  financed  the  WIC’s  successful  conquests  in  Brazil,  but  also 
17:533:41172:20:21:89:507:614:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:destroyed in one blow about a third of the ships employed in Seville’s (Spain’s main

17:535:41350:21:21:89:508:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:destroyed 547 ships worth about 5,5 Mio guilders (Cooper 1970 226-238). This sum 
17:536:41429:21:20:89:507:551:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:was greater than the WIC’s total, own capital. The WIC capital was 7 mio guilders, 
17:537:41512:20:21:89:508:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and  the  value  of  the  silver  captured  in  1628  was  more  than  10  mio  guilders

17:545:42158:21:21:89:508:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In particular, the Dutch thought that these Portuguese colonies were weak links in the 
17:546:42244:21:20:89:507:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Spanish–Portuguese  empire  and,  using  seapower,  they  extended  their  operations 
17:547:42330:20:21:89:508:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:ashore, attacking Portuguese strongholds. In 1624-25 they took and then lost Bahia, in 
17:548:42417:21:21:89:508:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1630 they began the conquest of Permambuco (NE. Brazil) which was completed by

17:553:42797:20:21:89:508:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: They concluded a Ten Year Trace with the Portuguese in June 1641. Hostilities 
17:554:42875:21:21:89:508:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:resumed nevertheless in 1644-5 with a rebellion against the Dutch in NE Brazil, while 
17:555:42961:21:21:89:508:158:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the Portuguese recaptured Luanda and Benguela in 1648, and by 1654 the Portuguese 
17:556:43042:21:20:89:507:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:expelled  definitely  the  Dutch  from  Brazil.  On  the  other  hand,  the  Dutch  completed 
17:557:43136:20:21:89:508:117:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:during 1654-1658 the conquest of Coastal Ceylon and Malabar from the  Portuguese.

18:559:43308:0:20:89:507:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Dutch dominant in Indian Ocean waters and Asia where the Portuguese retained only 
18:560:43390:20:21:89:507:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:a few bases like in the Indian peninsula and Macao in the Chinese coast (Boxer 1965). 
18:561:43473:21:21:118:508:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The Dutch–Portuguese conflict was costly for both sides and most of capital of 
18:562:43551:21:20:89:508:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the Dutch West  India Company was lost in the Brazilian war, which explains in part 
18:563:43635:20:21:89:507:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:why  the  WIC  was  less  durable  and  successful  than  the  VOC.  On  the  other  hand,  the 
18:564:43731:21:21:89:508:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:war  was  even  more costly  for  Portugal,  which  although  it  did  regain  Brazil, it lost 
18:565:43825:21:20:89:507:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:most  of  its  Asian  colonies,  and  even  more  important,  the  lucrative  spices  trade.

18:570:44072:20:21:89:507:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:enterprises linked trade,  war and privateering and in some cases like with the Dutch, 
18:571:44159:21:21:89:509:510:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:piracy, with the religious feeling of “holy” war of the Protestants against the Catholic

18:574:44417:21:21:89:508:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:called “syndicate   of   investors” were   chosen.   These   syndicates   were   open   for 
18:575:44508:21:20:89:508:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:participation to merchant-bankers, nobles, the captains and the sailors of the ships, but 
18:576:44598:20:21:89:507:407:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:even  members  of  government.  In  the  financing  of  Drake’s  expedition  of  1577

18:580:44925:20:21:89:508:324:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:the  Lords  of  the  Admiralty  (e.g. the “Ministry of the Navy” of the time) receiving 
18:581:45013:21:21:89:507:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:10% of the sales at auctions of the seized enemy  property. This can be interpreted in 
18:582:45100:21:20:89:508:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:modern terms as a kind of sales tax, linked to the fact that the Admiralty granted the 
18:583:45186:20:21:89:508:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:licences to the privateers (Andrews 1964; Rodger 1997; Konstam 2000; Kyriazis and 
18:584:45266:21:21:89:186:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Zouboulakis 2003). 
18:585:45284:21:20:118:508:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:As  suggested  in  Kyriazis and Metaxas (2011),  the  first  successful  expeditions 
18:586:45367:20:21:89:508:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:initiated  a  continuous  game,  along  which  the  enterprises  became  more  elaborate, 
18:587:45457:21:21:89:508:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:ambitious  and  bigger. Along  each  further  step  of  the  game,  the  decision  makers 
18:588:45547:21:21:89:507:158:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:gained  every  kind  of  new  knowledge,  financial,  organisational,  operational  and 
18:589:45635:21:20:89:139:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:technical. 
18:590:45645:20:21:118:508:117:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:After  the successful  repulse  of  the  Spanish  Armada  in  1588,  Elizabeth  and  the 
18:591:45733:21:21:89:507:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Lords  of  the  Admiralty  felt  that  since  the  danger  of  invasion  was  less  acute,  they 
18:592:45830:21:0:89:508:75:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:could also use royal warships in privateering expeditions (Konstan 2001). So, in some 
19:593:45914:0:20:89:508:758:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:of the expeditions of the 1590s, Elizabeth contributed both funds and “means in kind”, 
19:594:46000:20:21:89:508:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:e.g.  royal  warships.  For  the  1596  expedition  against  Puerto  Rico,  she  contributed 
19:595:46093:21:21:89:507:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:33.266  pounds  and  some  royal  ships  to  the  total  of  the  26  ships.  Commonly,  guns 
19:596:46187:21:20:89:507:696:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:from  royal  ships,  as  well as  cords,  ropes  etc.  were  used  to  furnish  the  “private” 
19:597:46281:20:21:89:507:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:privateering ships. We can interpret, in modern terms, this organisational development 
19:598:46368:21:21:89:508:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:as  one  of  the  first  historical  cases  of  Public-Private  Partnerships  (PPP),  which  was  a 
19:599:46468:21:20:89:480:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:case of acquiring and deepening new organisational and institutional knowledge. 
19:600:46547:20:21:118:508:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Technical knowledge went also hand in hand with organisational one. Since the 
19:601:46625:21:21:89:507:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:privateering  enterprises  were  driven  by  market  and  profitability  considerations,  we 
19:602:46718:21:21:89:508:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:should  expect  that  cost  and  efficiency aspects  were  given  particular  attention.  When 
19:603:46813:21:20:89:507:551:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:“businessmen” undertook the privateering operations under the profit motive, they 
19:604:46895:20:21:89:508:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:made  their  ex-ante  calculations  with  this  aim,  much  more  so  than  say  Spanish 
19:605:46984:21:21:89:508:510:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:“bureaucrats” who were administering and appropriating  state  funds.  This  actually 
19:606:47070:21:20:89:441:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:happened in England. We analyse two technical aspects to illustrate this. 
19:607:47143:20:21:118:507:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Till  the  middle  of  the  16th century,  most  guns  were  made  of  bronze,  which 
19:608:47228:21:21:89:507:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:offered  many advantages  compared  to  iron  guns.7 But  for  the  English,  and  for 
19:609:47313:21:20:89:507:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:privateering  in  particular,  iron  guns  offered  a  decisive  advantage,  that  of  cost.  Iron 
19:610:47412:20:21:89:507:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:abounded  in  the  country  and  iron  guns  cost  one  tenth  of  the  price  of  bronze  guns. 
19:611:47509:21:21:89:507:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:During the period under consideration, a period of increasing inflation in Europe and 
19:612:47595:21:21:89:508:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in  England,  the  price  of  cast  iron  guns  actually  fell  from  10-12  pounds  per  ton  in 
19:613:47693:21:20:89:508:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1565-1570 to 8-9 pounds in 1600 (Davies 1963). As expected, privateering ships (and 
19:614:47775:20:21:89:507:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:royal ships as well) were increasingly supplied by iron guns. This again led to a great 
19:615:47863:21:21:89:508:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:impetus  to  the  iron  industry  in  England.  Thus,  cost  considerations  linked  with  the 
19:616:47958:21:20:89:507:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:profitability  motive  of  the  privateering  expeditions  led  to  long  lasting  economic 
19:617:48050:20:21:89:289:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:effects (Kyriazis and Zouboulakis 2003). 
19:618:48089:21:21:118:508:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Privateering  ships  were,  also  due  to  cost  considerations,  relatively  small, 
19:619:48174:21:20:89:507:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:compared  to  their  prey,  the  Spanish  and  Portuguese  Atlantic  and  Asian  galleons. 
19:620:48265:20:21:89:508:200:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:Drake’s “Golden Hind” for example had  a  displacement  of  120  tons and  was  armed 
19:621:48351:21:18:89:508:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:with  18  iron  guns (Bradford  1965) compared  to  700  and  up  to  1.200  tons  of the 
19:622:48438:18:8:89:236:161:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:                                                 
19:623:48486:8:22:89:507:153:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:7 Iron  melts  at  a  much  higher  level  of  temperature  that  bronze,  making  it  thus  much  more  difficult  to 
19:624:48604:22:17:89:508:131:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:achieve  high  quality  without  shortcomings.  It  weighs  about  20%  more  than  bronze and  becomes 
19:625:48707:17:17:89:507:114:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:corrugated  by  gun-powder.  A  bronze  gun  that  received  an  overdose  of  powder  discharge  dilates  and 
19:626:48818:17:17:89:507:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:cracks, but an iron gun under the same circumstances just explodes without further warning. Thus, iron 
19:627:48921:17:0:89:337:80:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:guns were more dangerous to their crews (see Rodger, 1997). 
20:628:48982:0:20:89:508:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:enemies galleons and “naos”.8 In order to be able to defeat their enemies in battle, the 
20:629:49069:20:21:89:507:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:small  English  privateering  ships  had  to  develop  a  technical  advantage:  They  were 
20:630:49161:21:21:89:433:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:better sailing ships, but also, they achieved a much higher rate of fire.   
20:631:49235:21:20:89:507:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: This again  was  due  to  their  development  of  a  new  gun  carriage  (four  short 
20:632:49320:20:21:89:507:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:wheels against two big ones as in land guns in most Spanish ships) and tackle system, 
20:633:49406:21:21:89:507:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:which permitted a faster reloading of guns. According to some estimates, the English 
20:634:49491:21:20:89:508:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:could  fire  a  shot  every  two  minutes,  while  the  Spanish  needed  usually  double  that 
20:635:49586:20:21:89:508:614:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:time. The new gun carriage-tackle system was first introduced in the “Mary Rose” of 
20:636:49670:21:21:89:507:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1545 but it was generalised by the 1560s in all privateering ships and parallel to them, 
20:637:49757:21:21:89:472:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in the royal ships. It is clear, that the new innovation was efficiency enhancing. 
20:638:49839:21:20:118:508:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We  now  turn  to  a  brief  summary  of  privateers  operations  and  their  economic 
20:639:49926:20:21:89:507:531:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:effects. Most famous amongst them was Drake’s expedition of 1577 which would 
20:640:50003:21:21:89:508:510:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:result in the second, after Magellan’s, circumnavigation  of  the  world. Drake  started 
20:641:50090:21:20:89:508:489:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:the  expedition  with five ships and 164 men, but finished only with his own “Golden 
20:642:50174:20:21:89:508:469:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:Hind” (Bradford 1965 101). In the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of Peru he captured the 
20:643:50259:21:21:89:508:448:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:Spanish galleon “Nuestra Seňora de la Conception” loaded with 26 tons of silver from 
20:644:50344:21:20:89:508:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  silver  mines  of  Potosi.  At  the  Molucas islands  in  the  Pacific  he  added a  second 
20:645:50440:20:21:89:508:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:ship  carrying  spice before  returning  to  Plymouth  in  1580.  The  value  of  his  plunder 
20:646:50534:21:21:89:508:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:was  the  astronomical  sum  of  600.000  pounds,  double  the  annual English  crown 
20:647:50620:21:21:89:507:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:revenue.  His  investors  had  a  rate  of  return  of  4.700%,  which  makes  it  probably  the 
20:648:50717:21:20:89:251:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:best single investment in history. 
20:649:50751:20:21:118:508:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:During  the  last  two  decades  of  the  16th century,  the  cargoes  of  Spanish  ships 
20:650:50840:21:21:89:507:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:seized by privateers were valued at 100-200.000 pounds per  year, representing about 
20:651:50925:21:20:89:507:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:15%  of  total  English  imports.  During  the  period  1588,  they  seized  over  1.000  ships 
20:652:51021:20:21:89:507:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and organised a total of 150 expeditions against the Spanish towns and settlements in 
20:653:51107:21:21:89:508:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the New World, leading to the conquest and plunder of many of them, such as Puerto 
20:654:51189:21:20:89:508:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:de Caballos in Mexico (plundered 6 times) Porto Bello in Panama, even the strategic 
20:655:51273:20:39:89:508:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:bay  of Cadiz  in  Spain  in  1587  and  1596.  Their  success  was  such  that  the  prices  of 
20:656:51370:39:8:89:236:161:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:                                                 
20:657:51418:8:22:89:507:153:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:8 The “nao” was a Portuguese big merchant sailing ship (the word originating probably from the Greek 
20:658:51517:22:17:89:507:131:10:g_d0_f9:10:Times New Roman:“ναυς” meaning ship). Konstam (2001) gives a list of the Spanish-Portuguese  Armada  ships,  many of 
20:659:51618:17:17:89:507:114:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:which were armed merchantmen. Among them the naos “Santa Anna” and the “La Regazona” both 
20:660:51708:17:17:89:507:97:10:Times New Roman:10:g_d0_f9:displaced 1200 tons, while among the typical merchantmen supply ships, we find “El Gran Grifon” and 
20:661:51808:17:0:89:327:80:10:g_d0_f9:10:Times New Roman:“San Salvador” of 650 tons and “El Castilo Negro” of 750. 
21:662:51867:0:20:89:508:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:colonial  goods  of  the  Spanish  empire were  often  lower  in  the  London  than  in  the 
21:663:51959:20:21:89:319:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Seville market! (Andrews 1984; Rodger 1997)  
21:664:52000:21:21:118:509:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The importance of privateering for England is illustrated also by the fact that the 
21:665:52084:21:20:89:508:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:amount of coinage during Elizabeth’s reign is given as £ 5,4 mio, out of which £ 4,6 
21:666:52167:20:21:89:508:676:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f11:mio were silver coinage. According to Goldsmith (1983 180) “Most apparently came 
21:667:52244:21:21:89:508:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:from  Spanish  America,  partly  as  the  result  of  naval  privateering operations”.  Craig 
21:668:52337:21:20:89:508:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(1953 127) estimated the amount of silver captured from Spain at £ 1,25 mio, or 27% 
21:669:52418:20:21:89:337:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of total silver circulation within English economy.  
21:670:52469:21:21:118:508:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The treaty of Muenster of 1648 brought peace and formal recognition of the UP 
21:671:52547:21:21:89:508:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:by the Spanish crown. Spain managed to retain most of its colonies in America, with 
21:672:52631:21:20:89:508:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the loss of only some of them in the Caribbean. But Spain was in decline, and did not 
21:673:52716:20:21:89:508:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:regain  its  leading  position  as  the  greatest  European  power during  the  16th century. 
21:674:52808:21:21:89:507:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:During the period from 1557 to 1647 there were six consecutive bankruptcies, which 
21:675:52891:21:20:89:508:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:brought  down  with  them  great  financial  houses,  ruining  its  financial  credibility  and 
21:676:52987:20:21:89:508:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:destroyed in the long-run the development of a stable financial and banking system as 
21:677:53072:21:21:89:508:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:well  as stock  exchange  in  Spain (Cooper  1970;  North  and  Thomas  1973; Kennedy 
21:678:53156:21:20:89:265:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1988; North 1990; Rodger 1997).     
21:679:53191:20:21:118:507:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In  general,  both  historians  and  economists  agree  on  the  decline  of  Spain  as  a 
21:680:53282:21:21:89:508:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:result  of  the  war  with  England  and  the  UP.  Rodger  (1997,  chapters 18,  20  and  24) 
21:681:53376:21:21:89:507:365:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:describes the results for Spain’s commerce and gives a vivid description of the ruin of 
21:682:53464:21:20:89:508:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Spanish  shipyards.  Older  historians  already  had  described  this,  as  Trevor-Roper 
21:683:53553:20:21:89:508:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(1970,  chapter  IX, 263) writing: “The  war  had  now  proved  long,  meaningless  and 
21:684:53641:21:21:89:505:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:disastrous”, Cooper (1970, chapter VIII)  writing  on  a  change  in  the  balance  of  sea-
21:685:53732:21:20:89:508:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:power  and  the  rise  of  the  Dutch  and  English naval  supremacy,  and  Spooner  (1970,

21:687:53912:21:21:89:507:241:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:vol. IV of the New Cambridge Modern History is characteristic: “The decline of Spain 
21:688:53997:21:20:89:508:220:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman:and the Thirty Years War”. Kennedy  (1988, chapter  II, 41)  writes  on  the  conclusion 
21:689:54085:20:21:89:469:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of the war “...they revealed that the age of Holsburg ....in Europe was over”.  
21:690:54163:21:21:118:508:179:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f11:As  Rodger (1997, 296) remarks: Twenty  years  of  war  changed  England’s 
21:691:54236:21:21:89:508:158:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:perspective.  While  before  the  Queen  possessed  an imposing  but  almost  isolated  fleet 
21:692:54329:21:20:89:507:137:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:now naval strength had become a national matter. It was clear that England’s future 
21:693:54413:20:0:89:507:117:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:laid in the open seas... The English had learned that the sea was more than a defence 
22:694:54501:0:20:89:508:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:against  a  hostile  world:  it  had  become  the  means  to  discover  new worlds  for  gold, 
22:695:54596:20:21:89:172:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:fame and glory.9

22:697:54612:21:20:89:174:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:CONCLUSION 
22:698:54622:20:14:89:92:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
22:699:54622:14:21:118:508:662:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:     Due to the particular historical circumstances pertaining in the second half of 
22:700:54707:21:21:89:508:641:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  16th century,  two  relatively  poor  newcomer  states  in  the  international  arena, 
22:701:54798:21:20:89:508:620:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:England   and   the   UP,   both   having   relatively   weaker   central authorities   than 
22:702:54890:20:21:89:507:600:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contemporary  empires  (the  Spanish,  Ottoman,  Mughal  and  Ming)  had  to  find  new 
22:703:54978:21:21:89:269:579:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:means to face the Spanish challenge. 
22:704:55014:21:20:118:508:558:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:They   adopted   market   oriented   solutions,   to   wage   war   for   profit   using 
22:705:55103:20:21:89:508:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:partnership joint-stock companies  as  an  organisation  form  to  mount  privateering 
22:706:55190:21:21:89:508:517:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:expeditions.  It  was  a  decentralised  form  of  war-making,  since  privateers  followed 
22:707:55282:21:20:89:507:496:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:their  own  aims  and  tactics,  not  according  to  a  central  plan.  They  could  expect 
22:708:55374:20:21:89:508:476:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:maximization  of  profits  if  they  attacked  the  enemy’s  commerce,  both  ships  and 
22:709:55463:21:21:89:507:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:settlements.  In  due  time  this  strategy  of  commerce  raiding  proved  to  be  the  Achilles 
22:710:55561:21:21:89:508:434:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:heel  of  the  enemy.  As  we  have  sketched  above,  the  privateering-commerce  raiding 
22:711:55652:21:20:89:461:413:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:activity brought wealth and profits to England and the UP and ruined Spain.   
22:712:55727:20:21:89:508:393:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: Although   a   more   or   less   privateering   strategy   implemented   by   the Late 
22:713:55814:21:21:89:508:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Medieval era Italian city-states, such as Venice and Genoa, with the cases of England 
22:714:55900:21:20:89:508:351:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and the UP it was the first time in history that privateering was used in such scale and 
22:715:55989:20:21:89:508:331:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to such effect, (although of course privateering and piracy is almost as old as maritime 
22:716:56076:21:21:89:508:310:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:history  itself).  Thus, it  comes  as  no  surprise  that  this  commerce  raiding  strategy  has 
22:717:56174:21:20:89:507:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:been  adopted  during  the  following  years  as  a  strategy  of  the  weaker  naval  opponent 
22:718:56270:20:21:89:507:269:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:against the stronger one, with varying successes, as for example by the French against 
22:719:56357:21:21:89:508:248:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  Anglo  Dutch  during  the  War  of  Spanish  succession  1702-1713, the  Napoleonic 
22:720:56445:21:21:89:507:227:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Wars,  and  the  German  submarine  warfare  against  the  Allies  during  the  two  World 
22:721:56536:21:20:89:121:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Wars. 
22:722:56541:20:21:118:508:186:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: Economists  of  course  have  very  often  argued  about  the  superiority  of  market 
22:723:56628:21:21:89:508:165:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:regimes as against state planed ones in terms of economic efficiency and growth. The 
22:724:56712:21:20:89:507:144:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:main  point  of  our  analysis  here  is  that  market  solutions  can  prove  to  be  superior  in 
22:725:56812:20:32:89:508:124:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:war strategy, even though they came about, as in the cases of England and the UP, by 
22:726:56897:32:8:89:236:92:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:                                                 
22:727:56945:8:0:89:469:84:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:9 The last phrase has been attributed to Sir Walter Raleigh, a famous corsair, admiral and poet. 
23:728:57042:0:20:89:508:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:chance  or  by  trial  and  error.  It seems that  pursuing  personal  profit,  as  the  privateers 
23:729:57141:20:21:89:507:738:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:did, they operated under an “Invisible Hand of the market of war” (to paraphrase the 
23:730:57226:21:21:89:508:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:well  known  dictum  of  Adam  Smith)  which  in  the  end  maximized  operational 
23:731:57309:21:20:89:254:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:efficiency and economic benefits. 
23:732:57342:20:21:118:508:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:On the other hand, the more centralised Spanish empire had an elaborate policy 
23:733:57421:21:21:89:508:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:driven  by  non  or  mainly  non  economic  motives. Kennedy (1988, 51),  for  example 
23:734:57507:21:20:89:508:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:gives  as  the  main policy aims  of  the  Habsburgs  religion  “protector  of  Catholic 
23:735:57595:20:21:89:508:614:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:Christendom” and “reputation”. The relative strength of the central authority in Spain, 
23:736:57683:21:21:89:508:593:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:coupled to centrally laid policy aims led to “acts of economic folly” (ibid, 52) and 
23:737:57766:21:21:89:508:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:institutional  solutions  that  in  the  long  run  were  growth  inhibiting.  North  (1981)  and 
23:738:57864:21:20:89:507:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Kennedy (1988) give many examples of bad institutional choices taken by the Spanish 
23:739:57948:20:21:89:508:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:empire, as for example the taxation of the “mesta” guild (wool producer of Spain) that 
23:740:58034:21:21:89:506:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:inhibited the enclosure movement in Spain and thus long run efficiency in agriculture. 
23:741:58120:21:20:118:508:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Phillip II of Spain for example used his considerable wealth to wage war at the 
23:742:58200:20:21:89:507:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:same time against the Ottomans in the Mediterranean, the revolted Dutch, the English 
23:743:58285:21:21:89:508:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and the German Protestants. His resources were not sufficient for all these operations. 
23:744:58372:21:20:89:507:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Further, he neglected one of his empires crucial  regions, the New World possessions 
23:745:58457:20:21:89:507:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and  his  lines  of  communications.  Were  he  to  operate  under  more  market  oriented 
23:746:58548:21:21:89:508:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:considerations, his policy priorities would have been to strengthen the defences of his 
23:747:58636:21:21:89:507:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:New  World  territories  and  of  his  sea  communications,  instead  of  wasting  money 
23:748:58725:21:20:89:352:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:fighting the Protestant German princes and the Dutch. 
23:749:58778:20:21:118:508:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Moreover,  the  privateering  war  against  Spain  fostered new  norms  and  values, 
23:750:58863:21:21:89:505:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:which  were  market  oriented  and  not  imposed  by  a  central  authority,  like  self-
23:751:58952:21:20:89:508:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:confidence,  self-reliance, trust, a “sense  of  destiny” and  the  profit  motive.  This  was 
23:752:59045:20:21:89:508:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  basis  for  searching  and  finding  new  institutional  solutions  to  a  new  formidable 
23:753:59141:21:21:89:507:241:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:challenge, that of Spain’s threat to the independence and the economic interests of 
23:754:59225:21:20:89:507:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:England  and  the  UP.  The  answer  were  market  based  institutions  and  organisations, 
23:755:59317:20:21:89:508:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:like  partnerships  and  joint-stock  companies  both  for  trade  and  for  war,  and  later  a 
23:756:59414:21:21:89:507:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:whole  interdependent  complex  of  financial  institutions,  banks,  insurance  and  stock
