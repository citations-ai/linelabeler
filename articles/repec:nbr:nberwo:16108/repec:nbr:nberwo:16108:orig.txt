2:25:1131:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:Military spending, fatalities, and the destruction of capital, all of which are immediately felt and are
2:26:1235:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:often large, are the most overt costs of war. They are also relatively short-lived. The costs of war borne
2:27:1341:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:by combatants and their caretakers, which includes families, communities, and the modern welfare
2:28:1437:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:state, tend instead to be lifelong. In this paper I show that a significant component of the public costs
2:29:1542:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:associated with U.S. wars are long-lived.  One third to one half of the total present value of historical
2:30:1647:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:war costs have been absorbed by benefits distributed over the remaining life spans of veterans and
2:31:1745:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:their dependents. The half-life of these benefits has averaged more than 30 years following the end
2:32:1844:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:of hostilities. Estimates of the value of injuries and deaths, while uncertain, suggest that the private
2:33:1948:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:burden of war borne by survivors, namely the uncompensated costs of service-related injuries, are
2:34:2045:14:42:72:194:462:12:Times:12:Times:also large and long-lived.

3:42:2198:0:36:72:208:708:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:1  Introduction
3:43:2213:36:24:72:539:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Interest in the economics of armed conflict is on the rise. Blattman and Miguel (2010) review
3:44:2306:24:24:72:540:648:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:recent research efforts and issue a plea for improved data collection efforts. Glick and Taylor
3:45:2401:24:24:72:539:624:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(2010) examine the trade costs of warfare, estimating them to be similar in magnitude to
3:46:2489:24:24:72:539:600:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the human costs. A focal point of interest has been the cost of the 21st century U.S. wars
3:47:2579:24:24:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in Iraq and Afghanistan, examined extensively by Stiglitz and Bilmes (2008) and also by
3:48:2666:24:24:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Nordhaus (2002), Wallsten and Kosec (2005) and Davis, Murphy andTopel (2009). The
3:49:2747:24:24:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:three trillion dollar price tag estimated by Stiglitz and Bilmes, a focal point of much popular
3:50:2842:24:23:72:539:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:attention, includes present and future spending on military activities, support of veterans,
3:51:2934:23:24:72:540:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the uncompensated costs of death and disability, and macroeconomic and borrowing costs.
3:52:3021:24:24:72:266:457:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Edwards (2010) reviews these studies.
3:53:3058:24:24:89:539:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Nordhaus (2002) provides historical context by examining direct military spending in past
3:54:3147:24:24:72:539:409:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:U.S. conflicts, and Edelstein (2000) reviews the history of 20th century war cost assessments
3:55:3240:24:24:72:539:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:dating back to Clark (1931). A textbook treatment of the macroeconomics of warfare would
3:56:3328:24:24:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:discuss defense spending and its effect on aggregate demand, alongside the death toll and
3:57:3417:24:24:72:540:337:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:capital destruction. But such an analysis omits several key types of costs that, as Nordhaus
3:58:3509:24:24:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:discusses, are more difficult to reckon.  The most apparent omissions are the budgetary
3:59:3596:24:24:72:539:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:costs of compensating and caring for surviving veterans, which Clark (1931) omitted. Far
3:60:3684:24:24:72:540:265:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:less easy to measure are any uncompensated costs of injury and death borne by veterans
3:61:3770:24:23:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and their families. And there are also readjustment costs borne bychildren, spouses, and
3:62:3858:23:24:72:539:218:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:communities, all of which are even more nebulous (Institute ofMedicine, 2010). In addition,
3:63:3949:24:24:72:540:194:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the costs of military action should be weighed against those of inaction, as argued and
3:64:4036:24:24:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:operationalized by Wallsten and Kosec (2005) and Davis, Murphyand Topel (2009). In the
3:65:4122:24:24:72:539:146:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:case of veterans’ benefits in the U.S., the counterfactual quickly becomes convoluted as a
3:66:4212:24:24:72:527:122:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:result of the overlapping social safety nets provided by Medicare and VA health benefits.
3:67:4301:24:24:89:540:98:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Goldin and Lewis (1975) assess the costs of the Civil War using a broad methodology
3:68:4384:24:0:71:539:74:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:designed to capture the budgetary, human, and opportunity costs, namely the costs of fore-
4:69:4475:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:gone consumption or any benefits of accelerated industrialization. But their analysis appears
4:70:4568:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to omit veterans’ benefits, and it calculates the human costs solely as the present value of
4:71:4660:24:24:72:539:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:future wages foregone either because of death or wounds.1The recent analysis by Glick and
4:72:4749:24:24:72:539:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Taylor (2010) extends these techniques to losses on all sides in the two world wars. Research
4:73:4842:24:24:72:539:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:into the economic valuation of life has revealed that the willingness to pay for mortality risk
4:74:4937:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reduction implies a value of a statistical life (VSL) in modern periods that is much larger
4:75:5028:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:than the capitalized value of future wages alone (Viscusi, 1993; Viscusi and Aldy, 2003).
4:76:5117:24:24:72:539:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The true human costs of historical warfare depend on the VSL and,by extension, its income
4:77:5206:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:elasticity, a parameter of independent interest and uncertain magnitude over space and time
4:78:5297:24:24:72:438:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(Viscusi and Aldy, 2003; Costa and Kahn, 2004; Hall and Jones, 2007).
4:79:5366:24:23:89:539:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In this paper, I reassess the human costs of U.S. wars alongside a broader accounting of
4:80:5454:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:their budgetary costs, which consist of veterans’ health and disability benefits in addition to
4:81:5549:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:direct military costs. By and large, these data exist already in the Historical Statistics of the
4:82:5646:24:24:72:539:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:United States for periods prior to 1970. To produce a full accounting of costs for conflicts
4:83:5738:24:24:72:539:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with surviving veterans and dependents past 1970, I extrapolate using standard techniques.
4:84:5828:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:I augment these data with estimates of VA disability ratings, which provide some sense of
4:85:5917:24:24:72:539:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:health conditions among surviving veterans, drawn from an array of recent cross sectional
4:86:6006:24:24:72:113:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:surveys.
4:87:6014:24:24:89:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The most ironclad and interesting result is that the budgetary costs of providing death
4:88:6101:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and disability compensation, health care, and survivors’ benefits to veterans and their de-
4:89:6192:24:24:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:pendents are large and long-lasting. I find that those costs represent between one third and
4:90:6284:24:23:72:539:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:one half of the total present value of all war costs, and their half life has averaged more than
4:91:6380:23:24:72:539:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:thirty years and may be rising with recent conflicts. That a component of direct war costs
4:92:6470:24:24:72:539:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:should be so large and persistent is a novel finding that modifies the textbook conceptualiza-
4:93:6564:24:24:72:539:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tion of modern wars as costly but relatively short. The timing result also mirrors the insight
4:94:6658:24:19:72:539:110:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:recently offered by the Institute of Medicine (2010) and Edwards (2010) regarding the life
4:95:6748:19:15:85:540:91:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:1Goldin and Lewis assume that all Civil War wounded lose half their future earningpotential, while the
4:96:6850:15:0:72:138:76:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:dead lose it all.
5:97:6868:0:24:72:539:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cycle of veterans’ disability benefits, which tend to peak some thirty years after hostilities
5:98:6962:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cease. Rapidly rising costs of medical care have no doubt recently contributed to this general
5:99:7056:24:24:72:539:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:pattern, but it also predates the modern VA system and the periodof significant health care
5:100:7147:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:price inflation. Rather, the life cycle of veterans’ benefits appears to reflect an initial latency
5:101:7246:24:24:72:430:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and persistence of service-related disability among surviving veterans.
5:102:7317:24:24:89:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Much uncertainty surrounds the economic value of historical losses of life and health,
5:103:7403:24:24:71:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:but estimates I recover are never small. The human costs of recent warfare in particular
5:104:7491:24:24:71:539:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:are unambiguously large.  The private costs of disability are aslong-lived as the public
5:105:7579:24:24:71:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:costs of compensation and health care. For recent cohorts of veterans, the uncompensated
5:106:7667:24:24:71:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f6:private costs, which is the difference between the two, also called thesocial economic costs
5:107:7759:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:by Stiglitz and Bilmes (2008), appear to be large. During far-removed historical periods,
5:108:7848:23:24:72:539:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the result depends on assumptions regarding injury prevalenceand on the income elasticity
5:109:7937:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of the VSL. When the latter is high, the estimated costs of lost lives and health during
5:110:8025:24:24:72:539:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:historical periods are lower because incomes were much lower then than they are now. A
5:111:8111:24:24:72:539:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:given dollar amount of veterans’ benefits compensates relatively more for a given level of
5:112:8201:24:24:72:340:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:harm when the income elasticity of the VSL is high.
5:113:8252:24:24:89:539:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In the sections that follow, I first describe my data sources in greater detail and provide a
5:114:8345:24:24:72:539:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:summary overview of personnel involved in major U.S. wars and causalities. Then I calculate
5:115:8436:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the life cycles of veterans and of war-related budgetary costs for each past U.S. conflict,
5:116:8527:24:24:72:539:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and I compare and contrast each across conflicts.  Next I present anddiscuss estimates
5:117:8613:24:24:72:539:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of VA disability ratings among survivors of recent wartime andpeacetime cohorts.  The
5:118:8698:24:23:72:539:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:VA disability ratings facilitate a back-of-the-envelope estimate of the net health impact on
5:119:8790:23:24:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:surviving veteran cohorts, which I cost out according to assumptions about the income
5:120:8875:24:24:72:539:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:elasticity of the VSL. In the final section I discuss a limited counterfactual scenario, in which
5:121:8972:24:24:72:539:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:I omit any discussion of the costs of avoiding war and focus on the budgetary and private
5:122:9061:24:24:72:539:110:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:impacts of warfare relative to a baseline of maintaining peacetime forces only. Such a scenario
5:123:9156:24:0:72:540:86:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:raises the obvious question of why countries would have a standing military at all, if it were
6:124:9251:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:never used, but I believe the scenario still provides new and useful, if limited, insights as a

6:128:9423:32:24:71:540:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:My primary data source for information on wars and veterans are the Historical Statistics
6:129:9512:24:24:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of the United, Tables Ed1–399 States (Carter et al., 2006). Ofthese, the preponderance of
6:130:9601:24:24:72:540:508:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:statistics are derived from Tables Ed1–5, which list casualtiesfor major U.S. wars; Tables
6:131:9691:24:23:72:540:484:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Ed168–170, which show the estimated direct military costs of U.S. wars; and Tables Ed324–
6:132:9780:23:24:72:539:461:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:336, which present the expenditures of the Veterans Administration and its predecessor
6:133:9866:24:24:72:540:437:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:agencies by veterans’ period of service.3I augment the casualty lists for recent wars using
6:134:9957:24:24:72:540:413:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:data from the Statistical Information Analysis Division (SIAD) of the Defense Manpower
6:135:10043:24:24:72:540:389:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Data Center, which are current through March 6, 2010.4Military spending for the First
6:136:10128:24:24:72:540:365:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Gulf War and for Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) are taken from are
6:137:10211:24:24:72:540:341:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:taken Nordhaus (2002) and Stiglitz and Bilmes (2008) respectively, the latter the “realistic-
6:138:10304:24:24:72:227:317:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:moderate” forecast as of 2008.
6:139:10334:24:24:89:540:293:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Costs of veteran cohorts prior to 1866, which are primarily those associated with the
6:140:10419:24:24:72:540:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Revolutionary War cohort, are given in a single lump sum, whichI distribute across years
6:141:10507:24:17:72:540:245:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:according to other sources.5Costs by conflict end in 1970, so I extrapolate costs for World
6:142:10598:17:16:85:539:228:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:2Military forces can still have value solely as a deterrent, as evidenced by the presence of large nuclear
6:143:10704:16:12:72:540:212:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:arsenals among major world powers. But it is clear that wars can also bringbenefits to victors that may
6:144:10807:12:12:72:540:200:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:include territory, freedom or its inverse, and possibly economic growth. Severalstudies seem to suggest that
6:145:10915:12:8:72:414:188:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:war is never a net benefit, however (Goldin and Lewis, 1975; Nordhaus, 2002).
6:146:10992:8:16:85:539:180:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:3Following the Civil War, a number of former Confederate states independently established pensions for
6:147:11094:16:12:72:539:164:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:veterans of the Confederacy. But to my knowledge, whatever statistics may exist have not been assembled,
6:148:11198:12:8:72:156:152:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:let alone examined.

6:150:11275:12:16:85:540:132:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:5For the Revolutionary War cohort, I distribute nominal dollars across yearsaccording to amounts re-
6:151:11375:16:12:72:540:116:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:ported for several non-consecutive years by Glasson (1918), and then after 1840 according to the diminution
6:152:11482:12:12:72:539:104:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:pattern of spending on veterans of the War of 1812, shifted 32 years earlier in time. The total sum of nominal
6:153:11592:12:12:72:539:92:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:dollars I set a small amount of undistributed spending on veterans of the War 1812as occurring in 1871, the
6:154:11699:12:0:72:295:80:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:last year before which annual spending is reported.
7:155:11751:0:24:72:539:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:War I and later wars to 1997 using Tables Ed311–323, which listsVA costs by function
7:156:11835:24:24:72:539:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:through 1998; and Ed351–371, which presents compensation andpension (VBA) costs by
7:157:11917:24:24:72:539:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:period of service through 1997.6For veterans of the Spanish-American War and earlier
7:158:12001:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:conflicts, who are effectively extinct by 1970, I model nominalcosts as declining 15 percent
7:159:12093:24:24:72:539:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:annually, which is roughly the average rate of decline observed for extinct cohorts in the
7:160:12183:24:24:72:425:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:data. I also institute this rule for the World War I cohort after1997.
7:161:12253:24:24:89:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:For the World War II, Korean, Vietnam, and First Gulf War cohorts after 1997, I model
7:162:12338:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:costs per surviving veteran plus costs per survivor. A more precise method of forecasting
7:163:12427:24:24:72:539:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:would model additional parameters, such as the proportion of veterans who utilize health
7:164:12515:24:24:72:539:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:care and compensation programs and the intensity of utilization, where the latter is based
7:165:12605:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:on health status.  But data limitations hamper that level of analysis, and evidence both
7:166:12693:23:24:72:539:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:from aggregate time series and cross sections suggest that focusing on usage per surviving
7:167:12783:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:veteran is a reasonable alternative, at least for cohorts past acertain age.  I explore the
7:168:12874:24:24:72:442:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cross-sectional trends that support this perspective in section 5.1 below.
7:169:12948:24:24:89:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Veteran populations are given for historical periods in Tables Ed245–261, and for future
7:170:13036:24:24:72:539:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:periods by the VetPop 2007 projections obtained from the VA website.7I measure total
7:171:13120:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:nominal costs net of survivor benefits per surviving veteran in 1997 as $1,531 for the World
7:172:13212:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:War II cohort, $890 for the Korean cohort, and $1,489 for the Vietnam cohort, and I assume
7:173:13302:24:24:72:539:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a per capita cost of $1,500 for First Gulf War veterans. This assumption seems reasonable
7:174:13391:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in light of similarities in disability rates between Vietnam and First Gulf War veterans that
7:175:13484:24:17:72:539:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:emerge in the cross-sectional surveys I examine in section 5.1.8Growth in real per capita
7:176:13573:17:16:85:539:212:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:6Based on patterns observed during the overlapping of these series between 1960 and 1970, I assign half
7:177:13676:16:12:72:540:196:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:of “All Other Expenditures” (Ed323) to veterans and recover an annual scaling factorthat recovers total VA
7:178:13782:12:12:72:540:184:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:spending (medical plus compensation and pensions plus vocational plus half of other) from compensation
7:179:13884:12:12:72:539:172:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:and pensions alone. I apply these methods to VA costs for the World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam,
7:180:13988:12:8:72:194:160:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:and First Gulf War cohorts.
7:181:14015:8:16:85:540:152:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:7The latter categorizes as “Gulf War” all veterans serving after 1990.  I extrapolated the number of
7:182:14115:16:12:72:540:136:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:veterans of the First Gulf War from these figures by assuming there are 2,223,000 surviving veterans up
7:183:14218:12:12:72:539:124:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:to the peak of the VetPop series, in 2025, after which survivorship follows the same course, falling in half
7:184:14326:12:12:72:540:112:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:by 2054. By comparison, the Vietnam cohort is expected to halve around 2027. This technique will likely
7:185:14429:12:12:72:539:100:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:overstate the number of surviving First Gulf War veterans because in the VetPop data they are mixed in
7:186:14531:12:8:72:167:88:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:with younger cohorts.
7:187:14552:8:0:85:540:80:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:8This method will tend to overstate First Gulf War costs to the extent that thenumber of veterans on
8:188:14653:0:24:72:539:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:costs after 1997 is 0 percent for the World War II cohort, 1.5 percent for the Korean cohort,
8:189:14746:24:24:72:539:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and 3.5 percent for the Vietnam cohort, all extrapolated fromtrends in the data after 1980.
8:190:14837:24:24:72:539:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:For First Gulf War costs, which the Historical Statistics do not measure well, I assume the
8:191:14928:24:24:72:539:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:same rate of annual increase as found for the Vietnam cohort, andI backcast costs to 1991
8:192:15017:24:24:72:539:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:by combining that assumption with past headcounts and the $1,500 per capita cost in 1997.
8:193:15106:24:24:72:539:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:I assume a future rate of CPI price inflation of 3 percent. Numbersof survivors by period
8:194:15195:24:24:72:539:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of service are given by Tables Ed388 and Ed295 up to 1995 for theWorld War II, Korea,
8:195:15280:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Vietnam, and Gulf cohorts. I decrement each series according toa female cohort life table
8:196:15369:24:24:72:539:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:published by Social Security (Bell and Miller, 2005).9Levels of benefits are given by Tables
8:197:15461:24:24:71:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Ed362 and Ed367, and I forecast 6 percent nominal growth beginning from their 1995 levels,
8:198:15551:24:23:71:346:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:roughly the average annual rate of historical increase.
8:199:15606:23:24:89:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Estimates of real GDP and population from 1790 are available in Tables Ca9–19. For
8:200:15688:24:24:71:539:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:years prior to 1790, I assume constant growth in GDP and population based on the period
8:201:15775:24:24:71:540:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:1790 to 1810.  After 2002, I supplement this series with recent BEA data, and I inflate
8:202:15862:24:24:71:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the series to 2008 chained dollars. Data on CPI inflation with base period 1982–1984 are
8:203:15950:24:24:71:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:available in Table Cc1, which I append using recent BLS data. To obtain nominal discount
8:204:16038:24:24:71:540:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rates, I use a composite of series in Tables Cj1192–1194, which are averages of yields on
8:205:16127:24:24:71:539:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:longer-term issues of either the U.S. government or municipalities. I splice gaps in the first
8:206:16221:24:24:71:539:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:series assuming fixed risk premia between the three. Between 1997and 2009, I use the market
8:207:16312:24:24:71:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:yield on 10-year Treasury securities reported in the Fed’s H15 release, spliced with the same
8:208:16405:24:24:71:539:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:assumption. For forecast periods after 2009, I specify a 4.5 percent nominal discount rate and
8:209:16499:24:22:71:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a 3 percent rate of CPI inflation, mirroring the assumptions of Stiglitz and Bilmes (2008).
8:210:16590:22:12:72:540:183:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:disability rolls (Institute of Medicine, 2010) and disability ratings both tend to rise as the cohort ages, as
8:211:16700:12:12:72:540:171:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:shown in section 5.1. I do not capture this dynamic at all in my forecast because of data limitations. But the
8:212:16810:12:12:72:539:159:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:method will understate costs to the extent that in any period, younger cohorts of veterans are considerably
8:213:16917:12:11:72:540:147:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:more costly on a per capita basis in the data. Setting First Gulf War costs percapita only slightly above
8:214:17022:11:9:72:265:136:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:Vietnam costs likely understates the former.
8:215:17066:9:15:85:539:127:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:9For the World War II cohort, I use the life table for the female cohort bornin 1900; for the Korean
8:216:17166:15:12:72:540:112:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:cohort, I use the 1920 life table; for the Vietnam cohort, 1950; for the First Gulf War cohort, 1970. To the
8:217:17274:12:12:72:539:100:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:extent that dependents also obtain death pension and compensation benefits, this method will understate
8:218:17377:12:0:72:147:88:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:true future costs.
9:219:17396:0:24:72:455:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Data on federal government debt are provided in Tables Ea587and Ea728.
9:220:17466:24:24:89:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In order to assess the total costs of relatively recent wars, one must project veterans’
9:221:17554:24:24:71:539:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:benefits over a fairly long horizon. According to my forecast, nominal flows of costs associated
9:222:17650:24:24:71:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with the First Gulf War are unlikely to cease before 2090. For OEF/OIF, I use the forecasts
9:223:17741:24:46:71:398:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of spending on veterans provided by Stiglitz and Bilmes (2008).
9:224:17804:46:32:71:354:566:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:2.2  Cross-sectional surveys of veterans
9:225:17844:32:24:71:540:534:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In addition to dollars of benefits, another key variable is thehealth status of surviving
9:226:17933:24:24:71:539:510:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:veterans. Past studies of historical conflicts have made do with rules of thumb based on
9:227:18021:24:24:71:539:486:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:official casualty statistics: the “Wounds Not Mortal” category (Goldin and Lewis, 1975;
9:228:18108:24:24:71:540:462:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Glick and Taylor, 2010). These studies assume each nonfatal casualty represents a case of
9:229:18197:24:24:71:177:438:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:50 percent disability.
9:230:18219:24:24:89:539:414:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:My strategy improves on that method by examining VA disabilityratings, which are
9:231:18299:24:23:71:539:390:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:traditionally designed to reflect work disability and can be interpreted as revealing the per-
9:232:18393:23:24:71:540:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:centage reduction in quality of life (Stiglitz and Bilmes, 2008). With sufficient data, I could
9:233:18488:24:24:71:539:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:also calculate quality adjusted life years or some other measure, but the added difficulty
9:234:18578:24:24:71:540:319:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:would be specifying the change in QALYs or health status that is attributable to military
9:235:18667:24:24:71:398:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:service. The VA disability rating is designed to do exactly that.
9:236:18732:24:24:89:540:271:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In principle, all veterans examined by the VA during modern periods should have medical
9:237:18819:24:24:71:540:247:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:records that indicate their health status in some fashion. We also know from the CPE Union
9:238:18909:24:24:71:539:223:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Army Dataset that medical records exist for Civil War era pensions.  But a challenge is
9:239:18996:24:24:71:540:199:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:obtaining statistics that are representative of the average veteran’s condition. The Union
9:240:19086:24:24:71:375:175:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Army data are neither universal nor weighted, for example.
9:241:19144:24:24:89:539:151:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:As of this writing, I am unaware of any official statistics on disability ratings or health
9:242:19235:24:23:71:540:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:conditions for entire veteran cohorts.  One of the issues is thatunder U.S. law, veterans
9:243:19324:23:24:71:540:104:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:have had to voluntary approach the VA and predecessor agenciesin order to obtain VA
9:244:19407:24:0:71:539:80:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:disability ratings. Time trends in disability headcounts and payments suggest that veterans
10:245:19499:0:24:72:539:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:do not obtain disability ratings all at once, and even if they did, the average service-related
10:246:19594:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:disability rating for the cohort is in considerable flux duringthe first decades after the conflict
10:247:19693:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(Institute of Medicine, 2010). While military service records would probably have recorded
10:248:19783:24:24:72:539:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:physical and possibly mental injuries, it seems unlikely that these records have ever been
10:249:19873:24:24:72:344:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:systematically assessed for entire cohorts of veterans.
10:250:19928:24:24:89:539:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:What I currently have are several cross-sectional surveys of veterans in which respondents
10:251:20018:24:24:71:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:are asked their VA disability ratings and their period of service. These datasets include the
10:252:20111:24:24:71:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:1983 Survey of Aging Veterans (SAV), the 1992 National Survey ofVeterans (NSV), the 2001
10:253:20199:24:24:71:539:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:National Survey of Veterans, and the 2008 American Community Survey (ACS). The first
10:254:20283:24:24:71:539:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:three surveys were commissioned by the VA, they exclusively coverveterans, and they range
10:255:20372:24:23:71:539:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in size from about 3,000 in the SAV to 11,600 and 20,000 in the two NSVs. The 2008 ACS
10:256:20458:23:24:71:539:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:surveyed some 250,000 veterans out of a total population of around 23.4 million. Earlier
10:257:20546:24:24:71:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:waves of the ACS did not ask about VA disability ratings, and neither did the decennial
10:258:20633:24:24:71:539:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Census. Coverage of VA disability status in various Current Population Surveys exists but
10:259:20722:24:54:71:282:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is spotty and does not begin before 1985.
10:260:20763:54:36:71:410:319:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:3  The scope and aftermath of conflicts
10:261:20802:36:24:71:539:283:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Wars are costly because personnel and mat ́eriel must be deployedto combat zones, because
10:262:20891:24:24:71:539:259:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:hostilities result in deaths and wounded, and because survivingveterans and survivors of
10:263:20979:24:24:71:539:235:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:deceased veterans require medical care and are entitled to compensation. All of these costs
10:264:21070:24:24:71:540:211:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tend to vary with the scope of the conflict, with offensive and defensive military technology,
10:265:21164:24:24:71:539:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with medical technology, and with the general mortality environment faced by veterans and
10:266:21253:24:24:71:148:163:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:their survivors.
10:267:21269:24:24:89:540:139:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Table 1 lists statistics detailing several of these dimensions foreach major U.S. war. The
10:268:21359:24:23:71:539:115:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:left panel shows estimates of military personnel involved, military fatalities, the number
10:269:21449:23:0:71:539:92:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of service members experiencing wounds that did not result in death, and the number of
11:270:21536:0:24:72:539:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:surviving veterans, calculated as total personnel minus deaths.10The right panel displays
11:271:21625:24:24:71:539:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:several crude incidence indicators:  the number of wounded perparticipating personnel,
11:272:21711:24:24:71:360:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:wounded per killed, and wounded per surviving veteran.
11:273:21765:24:24:89:539:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Conflicts have varied widely in terms of overall scope, with World War II the largest
11:274:21850:24:24:71:539:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:conflict to date in terms of participants.11The most deaths occurred during the Civil War,
11:275:21940:24:24:71:539:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:if fatalities on both sides are counted; otherwise World War IIwas also the deadliest. Recent
11:276:22033:24:24:71:529:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:conflicts, especially the two following the Vietnam War, have been more limited in scope.
11:277:22122:24:24:89:539:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Soldiers serving during the Civil War, especially on the Confederate side, were the most
11:278:22210:24:24:71:539:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:likely in history to have died or been wounded. The indicatorsin Table 1 reveal that nearly
11:279:22301:24:24:71:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:20 percent of surviving veterans had physical war wounds. Because mental health trauma
11:280:22387:24:23:71:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:appears to have been a signature combat ailment in each historical era (Institute of Medicine,
11:281:22481:23:24:71:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:2010), the share of surviving veterans with either physical or mental wounds was probably
11:282:22570:24:24:71:539:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:higher still. In other conflicts, the proportion of survivors with war wounds has fluctuated
11:283:22662:24:24:71:316:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:between 2 and 6 percent, averaging 2.5 percent.
11:284:22709:24:24:89:539:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In recent conflicts, most notably OEF/OIF, the share of wounded soldiers per fatality
11:285:22794:24:24:71:539:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:has risen. This statistic measures roughly how likely it is that aservice member will survive
11:286:22887:24:24:71:540:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:his or her wounds. While relatively high during the Revolution and the War of 1812 at about
11:287:22978:24:24:71:539:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:1.5 wounded per death, this measure fell to about 0.75 during the early mechanization of war
11:288:23070:24:24:71:539:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in the later 19th century. It rose to 1.7 during the World Wars and 2.7 during the Korean
11:289:23159:24:24:71:539:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and Vietnam conflicts before dropping to 1.2 during the brief and largely airborne First Gulf
11:290:23252:24:24:71:539:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:War. In OEF/OIF to date, the statistic is nearly 7 wounded per death. Improvements in
11:291:23337:24:23:71:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:emergency medical care and more rapid evacuation by air to trauma centers are responsible
11:292:23426:23:19:71:453:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for the improvements in survival probability (Tanielian andJaycox, 2008).
11:293:23499:19:16:81:540:163:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:10The “wounds not mortal” category probably does not include mental health trauma per se.The former
11:294:23598:16:11:72:539:147:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:appears to be a statistic that is reported by the service branches during hostilities in order to describe
11:295:23704:11:12:72:540:136:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:changes in net force strength. Mental health injuries unaccompanied by physical injuries seem likely to have
11:296:23812:12:12:72:539:124:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:been coded differently, but it is far from clear. The typical interpretation of thesestatistics, as in Tanielian
11:297:23924:12:9:72:491:112:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:and Jaycox (2008) for example, is that they capture the prevalence of nonfatal physical wounds.
11:298:24019:9:15:81:540:103:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:11As shown in Table 3, the number of participants per resident population was also highest during World
11:299:24122:15:12:72:539:88:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:War II, at 11.7 percent. Next highest was the Civil War at 9.6 percent, and theRevolution at 7.7 percent.
11:300:24227:12:0:72:430:76:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:The last three wars have involved 4.4, 0.9, and 0.7 percent of the U.S. population.
12:301:24312:0:24:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Despite the growth in the probability of surviving wounds, the number of wounded as a
12:302:24397:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:share of surviving veterans has fallen recently, from about 4.4 percent during the World Wars
12:303:24490:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to 1.8 percent in Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq and Afghanistan. Thismay reflect an increasing
12:304:24579:24:24:72:539:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:mechanization or automation of warfare, or a force reconfiguration toward more support
12:305:24665:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:units and fewer combat units, or both.  Other things equal, a more limited share of the
12:306:24752:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:wounded among surviving veterans should reduce per-capita need and compensation. But a
12:307:24838:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:greater intensity of nonfatal harm among wounded survivors, asimplied by their increased
12:308:24926:24:24:72:343:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:survival probability, would clearly work against that.
12:309:24980:24:24:89:539:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The severity of wounds is no doubt a major determinant of the future survival of veteran
12:310:25068:24:24:72:539:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cohorts,12but the latter is foremost the product of the prevailing mortality environment,
12:311:25157:24:23:71:539:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:which has improved markedly over time.  Figure 1 plots survivorship curves for veterans
12:312:25244:23:24:71:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cohorts starting with the War of 1812, where the horizontal axis shows years from the
12:313:25329:24:24:71:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:end of the conflict. As mortality rates have fallen in the U.S. ingeneral, survivorship for
12:314:25420:24:24:71:540:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:each successive cohort of veterans has improved.  While it took only about 20 years for
12:315:25507:24:24:71:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:survivorship to dwindle to half of all veterans from the War of 1812 and the Mexican War,
12:316:25596:24:24:71:539:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the half life of the Civil War cohort was 40, more than 45 yearsfor veterans of World War
12:317:25685:24:24:71:539:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:I, and higher still for later cohorts. Today the median veteranis expected to live for more
12:318:25776:24:24:71:539:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:than 60 years following the end of hostilities. These survivorship projections roughly match
12:319:25868:24:24:71:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cohort mortality forecasts provided by the Social Security Administration (Bell and Miller,
12:320:25959:24:18:71:102:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:2005).
12:321:25965:18:16:81:540:235:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:12Veterans’ benefits may also be a determinant of post-service survival. But research in health economics
12:322:26070:16:12:72:539:219:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:suggests that at least for the average individual at older ages today, causality may run more from health
12:323:26175:12:0:72:320:207:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:into wealth rather than the reverse (Adams et al., 2003).

13:328:26489:23:24:72:540:587:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and the Mexican War, none of which ever exceeded $80 million in 2008 prices in a year. As
13:329:26578:24:24:72:540:563:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:discussed by Glasson (1918), pensions for Revolutionary War veterans at first were relatively
13:330:26671:24:24:72:540:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:small, limited primarily to officers but also including some withservice-related disabilities.
13:331:26765:24:24:72:539:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The service-pension act of 1818, originally suggested by the Monroe Administration as a
13:332:26852:24:24:72:540:491:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:response to perceived need, expanded benefits massively and unexpectedly.13Spending on
13:333:26938:24:24:72:539:467:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Revolutionary War veterans and their survivors fluctuated but remained high until dimin-
13:334:27026:24:24:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ishing rapidly after 1850, some 67 years after the end of the conflict. The wars with Britain
13:335:27119:24:24:72:539:419:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and Mexico similarly resulted in large outlays with long righttails, but it was not until the
13:336:27212:24:24:72:540:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:General Law pension system of 1862 and subsequent legislation was passed that spending
13:337:27298:24:23:72:322:371:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:expanded greatly (Glasson, 1918; Linares, 2001).
13:338:27346:23:24:89:540:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The Civil War was a watershed event in the development of the modern military com-
13:339:27428:24:24:72:539:324:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:pensation system in the U.S., a fact to which Figure 3 attests. The Disability Act of 1890
13:340:27518:24:24:72:539:300:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:actually extended benefits to veterans based on length of service, rather than only on specific
13:341:27613:24:24:72:540:276:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:service-related disabilities (Costa, 1998; Linares, 2001). Under that law, annual spending
13:342:27703:24:24:72:540:252:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:on Civil War veterans’ compensation swelled to almost $4 billionin today’s dollars, and all
13:343:27794:24:24:72:540:228:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:compensation represented almost 30 percent of the federal budget at the time (Costa, 1998,
13:344:27884:24:24:72:540:204:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:p. 197). Again, these benefits were extremely long-lived, dropping under $1 billion only
13:345:27972:24:24:72:291:180:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:after 1935, fully 70 years after the conflict.

13:347:28102:18:15:81:540:138:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:13Glasson (1918) discusses this on pages 65–74.  Federal budget surpluses followingthe War of 1812
13:348:28200:15:12:72:539:123:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:prompted their actions, but Monroe and others vastly underestimated the number of surviving Revolutionary
13:349:28305:12:12:72:540:111:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:War veterans. The rapid growth in spending visible in Figure 2 triggered a string of legislative fixes that
13:350:28412:12:0:72:286:99:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:first restricted and then again expanded benefits.

14:352:28549:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in benefits and its reversal in the mid 1930s was the result of wrangling between Congress
14:353:28639:24:24:72:539:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and FDR,15presumably over the massive budget deficits of the Great Depression. Spending
14:354:28726:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:diminished gradually from a peak of $2 billion in 1939 to less than a quarter billion by 1970.
14:355:28820:24:24:89:539:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Figure 4 shows real spending on veterans of World War I and laterconflicts. The picture
14:356:28907:24:24:72:539:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is dominated by the massive spike in benefits on the World War II cohort immediately after
14:357:28997:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:hostilities ceased, reaching $60 billion in today’s prices in1947.  These short-lived flows,
14:358:29089:24:24:72:539:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:which totaled roughly $6.7 billion in current dollars, reflect the unprecedented educational
14:359:29181:24:24:72:539:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:transfers of the midcentury G.I. Bill (Bound, 2002; Stanley,2003). These alone accounted
14:360:29269:24:24:72:539:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for $3.6 billion or about 54 percent of all spending on the World War II cohort in 1947 (OMB,
14:361:29362:24:23:72:539:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:2009, Table 11.3). Benefits dropped rapidly afterward, reaching a nadir of $16.5 billion in
14:362:29453:23:24:72:539:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:1956 before climbing to another peak of $37.3 billion in 1975, thirty years after the end of
14:363:29545:24:24:72:539:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:hostilities. The Korean War cohort also saw a massive spike in their benefits around 1956,
14:364:29635:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:probably the last year of coverage under the G.I. Bill, which lapsed in 1955 (Institute of
14:365:29725:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Medicine, 2010). Like World War II veterans, their real transfers peaked again around 1975,
14:366:29816:24:24:72:197:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:23 years after hostilities.
14:367:29843:24:24:89:540:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The World War I cohort’s peak year of real benefits was probably 1962, some 44 years
14:368:29927:24:24:72:539:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:after the end of the war. The graph depicts another peak in 1971, another 9 years later, but
14:369:30019:24:24:72:539:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:data after 1970 are estimates based only on compensation and pensions by cohort. Still, the
14:370:30110:24:24:72:245:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:uptick measured in 1970 was real.
14:371:30143:24:24:89:547:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:For the Vietnam cohort, benefits were monotonically increasing almost universally through-
14:372:30233:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:out the historical period. I forecast they will peak at just under $30 billion per year around
14:373:30327:23:24:72:539:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:2020, 45 years after the end of the war.  This is because according to the VA’s VetPop
14:374:30413:24:24:72:539:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:forecasts, the annual force of mortality only then reaches 3.5percent, the average annual
14:375:30502:24:24:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rate of growth in real costs per capita found in data for that cohort since 1980. First Gulf
14:376:30594:24:18:72:540:110:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:War costs, which are considerably more uncertain for reasons I discussed in section 2.1, are

15:379:30786:0:47:72:333:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:expected to peak around 2045 for the same reason.
15:380:30835:47:31:72:332:661:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:4.2  Veterans’ costs in present value
15:381:30872:31:24:72:539:630:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The very long-lived nature of veterans’ budgetary costs implies that the right way to com-
15:382:30962:24:24:72:540:606:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:pare them to short-lived costs of war like military spending is by calculating their present
15:383:31054:24:24:72:539:582:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:discounted value. For each major war, I deflate spending on veterans in each year past the
15:384:31144:24:24:72:540:558:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:start of the conflict by a discount factor that reflects the cumulative force of compounded
15:385:31235:24:24:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:interest measured from the middle year of the conflict. I take asmy nominal discount rate
15:386:31324:24:24:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the average interest rate on long-term government bonds described in section 2.1 above. This
15:387:31416:24:24:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:produces a series of present discounted values of future spending on veterans for each con-
15:388:31507:24:24:72:539:462:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:flict in current dollars, which are comparable to the current dollar totals of military spending
15:389:31603:24:24:72:540:438:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:during the conflict. When comparing different conflicts, I can inflate both of these using the
15:390:31697:24:40:72:287:414:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:CPI to recover real values in 2008 dollars.
15:391:31740:40:32:72:297:374:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:4.2.1  The life cycle of veterans’ costs
15:392:31780:32:24:72:540:342:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:First, it is useful to examine the time path or life cycle of veterans’ spending by constructing
15:393:31876:24:24:72:539:318:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the cumulative present value of veterans’ spending remaining to be spent as of each year
15:394:31964:24:24:72:540:294:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:past the end of each conflict. This number can be expressed as a proportion of the total
15:395:32052:24:24:72:539:270:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:present value of veterans’ spending for that conflict. The resultis a statistic similar to the
15:396:32146:24:23:72:540:246:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:survivorship probability measure in a life table. Like survivorship, this statistic reveals how
15:397:32241:23:24:72:539:223:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:long-lived the costs are, in a present value sense, of treating and compensating veterans of
15:398:32333:24:24:72:98:199:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:wars.
15:399:32338:24:24:89:540:175:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Figure 5 plots this survivorship series for costs against years since the end of the conflict
15:400:32431:24:24:71:540:151:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for each of the 10 major U.S. wars for which I have data and forecasts. There is similarity in
15:401:32525:24:24:71:540:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that all curves slope upward toward the asymptote at unity, butthere is also a considerable
15:402:32616:24:24:71:539:103:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:amount of heterogeneity in the slopes themselves.  The schedulesfor World War II and
15:403:32700:24:0:71:540:79:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the Korean War, at the far left of the figure, are very steeply sloped at first, reflecting the
16:404:32797:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:large G.I. Bill disbursements early in the life spans of those cohorts. In both cases, their
16:405:32889:24:24:72:539:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:half lives, where 50 percent of spending has been disbursed, occur relatively quickly, after
16:406:32981:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:about 20 years have elapsed. At the other end, spending on veterans from the War of 1812,
16:407:33070:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the Mexican War, and the Spanish American War was all considerably delayed due to the
16:408:33155:24:24:72:539:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:vagaries in development of military pension laws. For these cohorts, half lives were more like
16:409:33249:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:50 or more years. In between these extremes lie the other 5 conflicts, with no clear pattern
16:410:33341:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:governing their relative positions. Vietnam and the First Gulf War reach their half lives
16:411:33430:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:at 32 and 41 years respectively; World War I reached its at 38 years. Although veterans’
16:412:33518:24:24:72:539:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:survivorship schedules are advancing rightward, as remaininglife expectancies increase with
16:413:33609:24:24:72:539:492:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:mortality declines, the life cycles of costs have not necessarily followed this pattern at all.16
16:414:33706:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:For all 10 conflicts, the average half life of costs is 37.5 yearsfrom the end of hostilities;
16:415:33800:23:24:72:539:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:among the 6 cohorts prior to World War II subject to minimal costforecasting, the average
16:416:33889:24:24:72:149:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:was 44.2 years.
16:417:33904:24:24:89:539:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Compared to the patterns in veterans’ survivorship seen in Figure 1, trends in the
16:418:33986:24:24:72:539:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:longevity of veterans’ costs follow no clear pattern.  This seems odd at first given how
16:419:34074:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the two should be closely related.  The differences between themmust reflect changes in
16:420:34161:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:veteran compensation regimes, which apparently are large enough to overwhelm the effects
16:421:34249:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of monotonically increasing survivorship.17In light of this, the shorter life span of benefits
16:422:34343:24:24:72:539:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:following World War II and Korea, while real, is also somewhat misleading. Half lives are
16:423:34432:24:24:72:539:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:shorter because these benefits were front-loaded with massive educational outlays under the
16:424:34523:24:24:72:539:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:G.I. Bill. It would be a mistake to construe such a trend, which may be repeated now under
16:425:34613:24:23:72:539:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill expansion, as indicating a reduction in the net fiscal burden of caring
16:426:34708:23:24:72:539:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for veterans. Rather, it would represent a net increase in the fiscal burden that also moves
16:427:34800:24:18:72:259:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:its center of gravity forward in time.
16:428:34838:18:16:81:540:140:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:16By no accident, the two cohorts whose costs follow this pattern are Vietnam and the First Gulf War, no
16:429:34942:16:8:72:458:124:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:doubt because costs for the latter are entirely estimated based on veterans’ survivorship.
16:430:35032:8:16:81:539:116:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:17If post-service mortality rises with the degree of war wounds, then the trend toward increased survival
16:431:35137:16:12:72:539:100:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:among the wounded over time could have reduced the half-life of veterans’ costs by producingmore acutely
16:432:35241:12:12:72:540:88:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:wounded veterans who die earlier. But the proportion of surviving veterans who were wounded at all has
16:433:35343:12:0:72:118:76:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:also fallen.
17:434:35357:0:32:72:344:708:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:4.2.2  Veterans’ costs as a share of total costs
17:435:35405:32:24:72:540:676:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Second, it is revealing to compare the present discounted value of veterans costs associated
17:436:35497:24:24:72:540:652:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with military conflict to the direct military costs. Because I amusing the same deflator to
17:437:35588:24:24:72:539:628:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:translate current dollars into real dollars, the results will be independent of whether I inflate
17:438:35685:24:24:72:539:604:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:historical statistics or not.18I present results in billions of 2008 dollars, in order to provide
17:439:35782:24:24:71:408:580:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:easy comparability to the estimates of Stiglitz and Bilmes (2008).
17:440:35848:24:24:89:540:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Table 2 presents historical war costs for the 10 conflicts shown inFigure 5 plus estimates
17:441:35938:24:23:71:540:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan produced by Stiglitz and Bilmes. The left side
17:442:36029:23:24:71:539:509:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of the table is similar to data presented by Nordhaus (2002), from whom I take the datum
17:443:36117:24:24:71:540:485:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:on the direct military costs of the First Gulf War. The differences result from my using a
17:444:36207:24:24:71:540:461:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:later version of the Historical Statistics, in which some updated estimates are provided by
17:445:36298:24:24:71:145:437:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Goldin (1980).
17:446:36312:24:24:89:539:413:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The center panel in Table 2 reveals the total and present valueof veterans’ costs in a
17:447:36398:24:24:71:539:389:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:variety of formats. In current dollars, veterans’ costs literally explode over time, to no great
17:448:36494:24:24:71:540:365:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:surprise. In real terms, the sum total rises and dips along with thedirect costs of military
17:449:36586:24:24:71:540:341:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:activities, proxying the scope of conflicts. The most useful comparison is the present value
17:450:36678:24:24:71:540:317:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of veterans’ benefits measured from the midpoint of the war in 2008 dollars, in the third
17:451:36767:24:24:71:539:293:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:column of the center panel. This number is extremely small forearly conflicts, for which
17:452:36855:24:23:71:540:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:appreciable veterans’ benefits were a long way off, and considerably larger for more recent
17:453:36946:23:24:71:539:246:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:conflicts. It reaches $1.4 trillion for World War II, $555 billion for Vietnam, and $372 billion
17:454:37042:24:24:71:540:222:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for the First Gulf War.  Out of the $3 trillion in costs estimated by Stiglitz and Bilmes
17:455:37131:24:24:71:362:198:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(2008), $673 billion represents budgetary veterans’ costs.
17:456:37189:24:18:89:539:174:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The rightmost panel in Table 2 shows the total budgetary costs ofthese eleven major
17:457:37272:18:16:81:540:156:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:18One could argue that nominal public budgetary costs ought to be deflated using the GDP deflator,
17:458:37370:16:12:72:539:140:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:because at least in the modern era taxes are raised off of nominal GDP. This logic suggests that from the
17:459:37475:12:11:72:539:128:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:perspective of measuring the present value of the net tax burden, real direct military costs and real veterans’
17:460:37586:11:12:72:540:117:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:benefits should be recovered using the GDP deflator. Notwithstanding the large differences inthe nature of
17:461:37692:12:12:72:539:105:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:the federal tax base over time, another problem is that the real value to veterans of veterans’ benefits ought
17:462:37802:12:12:72:540:93:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:to be based off the CPI instead. Without unambiguous theoretical motivations to usedifferent deflators, I
17:463:37907:12:0:72:265:81:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:choose to apply the CPI to all flows of cash.
18:464:37954:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:U.S. wars, and the share of those total present-value costs attributable to veterans’ benefits.
18:465:38049:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The total cost of World War II is almost $6 trillion dollars in today’s prices, while the share
18:466:38144:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:attributable to veterans’ costs is 23.5 percent. The First GulfWar stands out as a very
18:467:38231:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:inexpensive military operation that is also associated with a very large amount of veterans’
18:468:38323:24:24:72:539:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:benefits, which account for 80 percent of total costs.  This was not unprecedented; the
18:469:38410:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Spanish-American War was also relatively cheap when fought butvery expensive in terms
18:470:38495:24:24:72:539:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of veterans’ costs, which account for 78.5 percent of all costs. Across all eleven conflicts, the
18:471:38592:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:average share attributable to veterans’ costs is 35 percent; for conflicts since World War I,
18:472:38685:24:40:72:202:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the average is 41 percent.

18:474:38770:32:24:72:539:444:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Finally, it is useful to examine the magnitudes of war costs andparticipation relative to
18:475:38859:24:24:72:540:420:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:population, involved personnel, and to GDP. Table 3 reports the share of the resident popu-
18:476:38950:24:24:72:539:396:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:lation involved in each war, the direct military costs and thepresent value of veterans’ costs
18:477:39044:24:24:72:540:372:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:per involved military personnel, and the ratios to GDP of costsand initial federal debt held
18:478:39136:24:24:72:143:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:by the public.
18:479:39150:24:23:89:540:324:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Participation has varied enormously over these eleven conflicts, ranging from a low of 0.4
18:480:39240:23:24:71:539:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:percent involved during the Mexican War, to 11.7 percent during World War II. Real costs
18:481:39328:24:24:71:539:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:per soldier have also varied widely and loosely track participation, as one would expect if
18:482:39419:24:24:71:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:both measures index the scope of war. But the real costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
18:483:39511:24:24:71:540:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:per service member are vastly higher than in historical conflicts. Direct military spending per
18:484:39606:24:24:71:539:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:soldier in Iraq or Afghanistan is near the one million dollar mark at three times the quarter
18:485:39699:24:24:71:539:181:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:million dollars spent per World War II service member. The present value of veterans’ costs
18:486:39790:24:24:71:300:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:per OEF/OIF soldier is more than $300,000.
18:487:39832:24:24:89:540:133:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Costs as a share of pre-conflict GDP track the participation rate more closely and provide
18:488:39922:24:24:72:540:109:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a better index of scope than do costs per participant. Another natural comparison is between
18:489:40014:24:0:72:540:85:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the ratio of war costs per GDP and the ratio of debt held by the public to GDP, which is
19:490:40104:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:measured at the beginning and the end of each conflict in the lasttwo columns in Table
19:491:40190:24:24:72:539:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:3. Other things equal, war costs raise indebtedness, but not necessarily one-for-one.19For
19:492:40280:24:24:72:539:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:example, the unprecedented level of direct military spending during World War II, equal to
19:493:40370:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:almost three times initial GDP but spread over a period of five years, raised debt held by
19:494:40460:24:24:72:284:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the public from 36 to 94 percent of GDP.
19:495:40500:24:24:89:539:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:By contrast, the present value of future veterans’ costs as a shareof GDP is directly
19:496:40585:24:24:72:539:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:comparable to the debt-to-GDP ratio at the end of each conflict. The former is a measure of
19:497:40676:24:24:72:539:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:implicit debt, the latter explicit debt, both scaled to income. An analogous measure is the
19:498:40767:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:unfunded future liabilities of Social Security or Medicare, which respectively are on the order
19:499:40862:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of $5.3 and $13.4 trillion today,20or roughly 40 and 90 percent of GDP. The implicit debt
19:500:40951:24:23:71:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:associated with veterans’ costs has tended to be much smaller, on the order of 4 percent
19:501:41039:23:24:71:539:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of GDP, except in the cases of the World Wars and the Civil War, after which implicit
19:502:41124:24:24:71:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:debts were between 20 and 50 percent of GDP. This analogy is also appropriate for another
19:503:41213:24:24:71:539:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reason.  Like Social Security and Medicare spending, compensation and medical care for
19:504:41299:24:24:71:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:veterans represent transfers of resources rather than additions to income. In this regard, the
19:505:41393:24:24:71:539:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:share of total war costs attributable to veterans is likely to understate their net fiscal burden
19:506:41490:24:18:71:422:325:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:relative to that of direct war costs, because the latter add to GDP.21
19:507:41560:18:15:81:539:307:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:19Military spending is a direct addition to GDP, and although there may be some degree of crowding
19:508:41658:15:12:72:539:292:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:out, the former raises the latter. But not only would GDP, the denominator, rise and reduce the debt to
19:509:41761:12:12:72:539:280:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:GDP ratio, but part of military spending will also be self-financing because incomeis taxed. If the defense
19:510:41868:12:12:72:539:268:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:spending multiplier is unity and the federal tax take out of GDP is 0.18, for example, then only 82 percent
19:511:41975:12:9:72:329:256:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:of direct military costs represents unfunded net borrowing.

19:514:42239:12:8:71:101:220:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:(2009).
19:515:42246:8:16:81:540:212:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:21Pensions, or compensation unrelated to service-connected disability, are taxable, while VA disability
19:516:42349:16:12:71:539:196:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:compensation is not. This would imply a net negative effect of veterans’ transfer payments on the overall
19:517:42454:12:12:71:539:184:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:tax take. If veterans spend their transfers at a faster rate than other taxpayers, however, there could in
19:518:42560:12:0:71:471:172:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:theory be a positive effect on taxes via a stimulative “multiplier” effect on national income.
20:519:42656:0:36:72:420:708:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:5  War-related costs of injury and death
20:520:42696:36:24:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The budgetary costs of war, which include the costs of compensation and treatment for war-
20:521:42786:24:24:72:540:648:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:related trauma, are what governments and by extension taxpayers pay. But these transfers
20:522:42874:24:24:72:539:624:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:may or may not fully compensate veterans and their survivors for war wounds. The system
20:523:42961:24:24:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of VA disability compensation, in which service-related disability is scored as a percentage of
20:524:43056:24:24:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:total disability, is based on the ability to work and calibrated to the present value of future
20:525:43151:24:24:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:labor market earnings (Institute of Medicine, 2007; Stiglitz and Bilmes, 2008). But the now
20:526:43242:24:24:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:traditional view in health economics is that the full cost of disability to an individual is
20:527:43334:24:23:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reflected in his or her willingness to pay for reductions in risks to life and health. In modern
20:528:43430:23:24:72:540:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:periods, the willingness to pay to avoid death or a particular illness is much larger than is
20:529:43523:24:24:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:implied by the capitalized value of future wages foregone (Viscusi, 1993; Viscusi and Aldy,
20:530:43614:24:24:72:540:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:2003). The human costs of warfare therefore hinge on the values of a statistical life and a
20:531:43705:24:24:72:440:409:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:statistical injury, and not necessarily on VA and military compensation.
20:532:43777:24:24:89:539:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Given enough information, it would be possible to characterize and cost out each service-
20:533:43866:24:24:72:539:361:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:related injury or death for every conflict. In practice, such astrategy faces two impediments.
20:534:43960:24:24:72:539:337:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:First, there is a lack of consistency in any detailed measures of health status and conditions
20:535:44054:24:24:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:across cohorts of veterans. For more than one conflict, one would have to cobble together
20:536:44143:24:24:72:539:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:such data from an array of disparate sources.  The second problem isthat it is difficult
20:537:44231:24:24:72:540:265:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to measure service-related health conditions as opposed to allhealth conditions. Standard
20:538:44320:24:23:72:539:241:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:health surveys do not ask whether conditions are related to military service; such data
20:539:44407:23:24:72:304:218:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:presumably is only available through the VA.
20:540:44451:24:24:89:540:194:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Data on specific conditions related to service are no doubt available in some form for
20:541:44537:24:24:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:many cohorts of veterans from the VA. But a far more expeditious strategy is instead to use
20:542:44628:24:24:72:540:146:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:survey-level measures of the VA disability rating alone. The measure is designed to quantify
20:543:44720:24:24:72:539:122:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:service-related poor health as a percentage of total disability, so in principle it measures
20:544:44812:24:24:72:540:98:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:something akin to a quality-adjusted life. If one is willing toassume that a life spent with
20:545:44904:24:0:72:539:74:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:xpercent VA disability is worthxpercent of a disability-free life, then the total gross cost
21:546:44998:0:24:72:539:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of service-related disability borne by that veteran isxtimes the value of a statistical life.
21:547:45091:24:24:71:539:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Stiglitz and Bilmes (2008) use precisely this methodology, applying the VA disability rating
21:548:45183:24:24:71:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to the VSL in order to recover thesocial economic costs, defined as the difference between
21:549:45273:24:24:71:504:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the gross costs and all disability compensation, of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

21:551:45445:24:24:71:539:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:major U.S. wars using this methodology. The two key componentsare the prevalence of
21:552:45528:24:46:71:433:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:disability and death among veterans, and the value of a statistical life.

21:554:45653:32:24:71:539:486:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The primary component of the historical costs of disability anddeath are the relative magni-
21:555:45745:24:24:71:539:462:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tudes of each among veterans. Deaths are easy to measure while disability is more difficult.
21:556:45837:24:24:71:540:438:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Past studies have assumed that all service members who were reported as having “wounds
21:557:45923:24:24:71:540:414:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:not mortal” in the official military statistics were 50 percent disabled, while no other veter-
21:558:46018:24:23:71:539:390:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ans suffered any disability (Goldin and Lewis, 1975; Glick and Taylor, 2010). For conflicts
21:559:46109:23:24:71:540:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in the distant past, this assumption is difficult to assess. For recent wars, I can measure
21:560:46200:24:24:71:539:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:self-reported VA disability ratings for veteran cohorts and directly compare those statistics

21:563:46407:24:24:71:540:271:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:since 1980: the 1983 Survey of Aging Veterans (SAV), the 1992 and2001 National Surveys
21:564:46493:24:24:71:539:247:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of Veterans (NSV), and the 2008 American Community Survey (ACS). The only dataset
21:565:46574:24:24:71:540:223:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that measures the World War I cohort, which on average was bornbefore the 20th century,
21:566:46661:24:24:71:539:199:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is the 1983 SAV. Veteras from later conflicts are sequentially picked up in later surveys,
21:567:46751:24:24:71:540:175:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ending with the recently released 2008 ACS, which measured 14,588 veterans of the Iraq
21:568:46837:24:24:71:540:151:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and Afghanistan era. For each conflict, the first three rows report the VA disability rating
21:569:46929:24:23:71:540:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:averaged over all surviving veterans, the average VA disability rating among veterans with
21:570:47019:23:24:71:540:104:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a positive rating, and the share of the cohort with a positive rating. The next four rows list
21:571:47113:24:0:71:444:80:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:weighted headcounts, the average age of the cohort, and the sample size.
22:572:47187:0:24:89:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:There is a limited degree of uniformity across veteran cohorts in their average VA disabil-
22:573:47278:24:24:72:539:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ity level in these data, which has hovered between 2 and 6 percent disabled. Veterans with
22:574:47368:24:24:72:539:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a positive rating typically experience about 35 percent disability, while they have accounted
22:575:47461:24:24:72:539:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for 10–15 percent of their cohort, sometimes less as in the case of the Korean War. But
22:576:47548:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:behind this rough average that is immediately evident thereis considerable variation over
22:577:47637:24:24:72:168:588:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:ages and cohorts.22
22:578:47656:24:24:89:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Across all cohorts, there is a clear upward trajectory in the average VA disability rating
22:579:47746:24:24:71:539:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:over the life cycle, which appears to decelerate after age 60but continues to increase. The
22:580:47837:24:24:71:539:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:exceptions to this pattern arise only when comparing the muchsmaller 1983 SAV to the later
22:581:47927:24:24:71:539:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:surveys, and they are probably spurious. As revealed by the head counts of disabled veterans,
22:582:48020:24:23:71:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:which appear below the prevalence indicators, the aggregatelevel of need ultimately declines
22:583:48112:23:24:71:539:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:as the cohort dies off over time. Aggregate need drives the realdollars spent on veterans
22:584:48201:24:24:71:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:shown in Figures 2–4, which explains the hump-shaped trajectory. But per capita need as
22:585:48288:24:24:71:540:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:indexed here appears to increase continuously throughout agefor these cohorts, driven by
22:586:48376:24:24:71:539:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:increases along both extensive and intensive margins. This is the opposite of what one would
22:587:48468:24:24:71:539:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:expect to happen naturally through attrition if mortality rates were increasing in the level of
22:588:48563:24:24:71:539:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:VA disability. That both the prevalence and severity of disability appear to increase within
22:589:48655:24:24:71:540:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a cohort over time suggests that latent conditions are revealing themselves during the course
22:590:48748:24:24:71:115:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of aging.
22:591:48757:24:24:89:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:There also is interesting variation across conflicts or cohorts,especially along the extensive
22:592:48851:24:24:71:540:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:margin, or the share of veterans with a positive VA disability rating. Successively younger
22:593:48942:24:23:71:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cohorts of veterans seem to have higher VA disability ratings on average than older cohorts
22:594:49033:23:24:71:539:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:did, both overall and at comparable ages.  This appears to be driven more by a greater
22:595:49119:24:18:71:539:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:prevalence of positive ratings within the cohort rather thana higher level or intensity of VA
22:596:49212:18:16:81:540:140:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:22I recognize that age, time, and cohort effects cannot be independently identified in observational data.
22:597:49318:16:12:72:539:124:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:But I argue that there are clear theoretical reasons to support the existence of age and cohort effects. Health
22:598:49429:12:12:72:540:112:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:conditions can often be latent over the life cycle, suggesting that age effects are likely to matter; and cohorts
22:599:49542:12:12:72:540:100:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:of veterans clearly differ in their exposure to risks because they served in different theaters and used different
22:600:49656:12:0:72:260:88:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:defensive and offensive military technology.
23:601:49702:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:disability among those with positive ratings. The patterns in VAdisability in Table 4 do not
23:602:49794:24:24:72:539:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:match the trends in percent wounded across conflicts that werepresented in Table 1. In the
23:603:49884:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:two World Wars, the latter was 4.2 percent; in Korea and later,it dropped to 1.8 percent. By
23:604:49976:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:comparison, the average VA disability rating has risen, reaching 6.3 percent among Vietnam
23:605:50066:24:24:72:539:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and First Gulf War veterans, the latter at a far younger age. If VA disability is the gold
23:606:50156:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:standard of measurement, it would appear that the incidence ofwar wounds in the defense
23:607:50243:24:24:72:482:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:department statistics is a poor measure of the average health impact of warfare.
23:608:50323:24:24:89:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A very similar picture emerges when I examine VA disability among veterans who have
23:609:50406:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:served only during peacetime. These statistics are reported in Table 5 for cohorts who served
23:610:50499:24:24:72:539:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:only during three recent interwar periods. Average VA disability ratings for these peacetime
23:611:50591:24:23:72:539:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cohorts are not zero, although they average only one or two percent rather than up to six.
23:612:50681:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This is because the share with any disability is considerably lower than among war veterans,
23:613:50773:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and never above 8.2 percent in the table. Both the share disabled, and to a lesser extent the
23:614:50866:24:24:72:539:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:intensity of disability among the disabled, rise within these peacetime cohorts as they age,
23:615:50958:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:just as within wartime cohorts. The minimum average disabilityrating across all peacetime
23:616:51047:24:24:72:185:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cohorts is 0.5 percent.
23:617:51070:24:24:89:540:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The evolution of VA disability over the life course, the strong age effects that I argue are
23:618:51162:24:24:72:539:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in the data, motivate the use of extrapolative techniques to forecast and backcast average VA
23:619:51255:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:disability trends. Assuming a floor on the average VA disability rating of 0.5 percent, which
23:620:51348:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is the smallest measure within samples shown in Tables 4 and 5, I extrapolate average VA
23:621:51436:24:24:72:539:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:disability ratings by age for the five wartime cohorts startingwith World War II assuming
23:622:51525:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:piecewise linear trajectories through age.  Figure 6 plots the actual data, shown by the
23:623:51613:23:24:72:539:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:markers, alongside extrapolated values. These estimates should be viewed with skepticism
23:624:51701:24:24:72:539:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:given the small number of cohorts and limited time period of observation. Forecasts for the
23:625:51792:24:24:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:First Gulf War and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are based on fewreal data points, and it
23:626:51884:24:24:72:540:110:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is certainly conceivable that there are upper limits on disability ratings that younger cohorts
23:627:51979:24:0:72:539:86:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:will simply reach earlier in their lives. But the similar age slopes that emerge across different
24:628:52078:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cohorts in the data are reassuring, as is the fact that Vietnam veterans have remained so
24:629:52167:24:24:72:222:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:different from earlier cohorts.
24:630:52198:24:24:89:539:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Strong age effects in the average VA disability rating raise thequestion of exactly what
24:631:52286:24:24:72:539:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rate to use in determining the total lifetime impacts of war onthe health of a cohort. If
24:632:52375:24:24:72:539:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:there were known bottlenecks in assigning VA disability ratings that drove the age-related
24:633:52465:24:24:72:539:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:trajectory, one could argue that the maximum observed ratingis the appropriate measure
24:634:52551:24:24:72:539:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of lifetime harm. But the delays of several decades apparent in the data seem more likely
24:635:52640:24:24:72:539:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to have emerged from the latency of health impacts. If latencyis important, the lifetime
24:636:52728:24:24:72:539:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:impact on health is arguably best captured by an average of VA disability ratings over all
24:637:52818:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ages, ideally weighted by survivorship. I assume VA disability rates are flat after the levels
24:638:52912:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:shown at age 90 in Figure 6, and I apply the survivorship probabilities shown in Figure 1 to
24:639:53004:23:24:72:539:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:recover the following lifetime average VA disability ratings for wartime cohorts, which are
24:640:53095:24:24:72:539:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:also shown in Table 6: World War II, 1.8 percent; Korea, 1.7 percent; Vietnam, 5.2 percent;
24:641:53186:24:24:72:396:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:First Gulf War, 9.8 percent; Iraq and Afghanistan, 9.4 percent.
24:642:53249:24:24:89:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The paucity of data on VA disability ratings for veterans of conflicts prior to World War
24:643:53338:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:II hinders cost estimates for those periods. But with average lifetime VA disability rates for
24:644:53432:24:24:72:539:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:later conflicts, I can estimate the costs of death and disability using assumptions about the
24:645:53525:24:46:72:248:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:historical value of a statistical life.

24:647:53621:32:24:72:539:223:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Stiglitz and Bilmes (2008) assume the value of a statistical life(VSL) equals $7.2 million in
24:648:53714:24:24:72:539:199:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:2007 dollars, which equals the central estimate of $6.2 million in 2002 dollars used by the
24:649:53805:24:24:72:539:175:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Environmental Protection Agency (Dockins et al., 2004) adjusted for inflation. The earlier
24:650:53895:24:24:72:540:151:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:estimate was itself an inflation-adjusted update of EPA’s earlier assumption of $4.8 million in
24:651:53990:24:23:72:540:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:1990 dollars. All these figures fit within the relatively wide range of $4 to $9 million implied
24:652:54086:23:24:72:540:104:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:by U.S. labor market data on wage differentials associated with mortality risks (Viscusi and
24:653:54178:24:0:72:540:80:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Aldy, 2003). But is the VSL really fixed in real terms over time, as Stiglitz and Bilmes (2008)
25:654:54275:0:24:72:539:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and others have assumed? If there is any growth in the VSL over time, it will strongly affect
25:655:54368:24:24:72:472:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:estimates of the private costs of disability and death during historical periods.
25:656:54449:24:24:89:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Economic theory suggests the VSL ought to depend on the marginalutility of living
25:657:54530:24:24:71:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:relative to that of consumption.23Two prior studies systematically assess how the VSL
25:658:54615:24:24:71:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:varies over space and time. Viscusi and Aldy (2003) conduct a meta-review of the literature
25:659:54706:24:24:71:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:on the VSL in U.S. labor market studies since the 1960s and in a crosssection of countries.
25:660:54797:24:24:71:539:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:They estimate the income elasticity of the VSL,ηV SL, in the range of 0.5 to 0.6. Costa and
25:661:54888:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Kahn (2004), who examine U.S. data between 1940 and 1980, reportηV SLto be around 1.5
25:662:54973:24:24:72:539:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to 1.7. In an interesting study of the decision to deploy costly military resources in order
25:663:55065:24:24:72:539:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to reduce casualties, Rohlfs (2006) estimates a VSL in World War II, roughly $1 million in
25:664:55155:24:18:72:459:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:2003 dollars, that is consistent with the findings of Costa and Kahn (2004).
25:665:55231:18:16:81:540:450:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:23The question is how these may vary over time. The former is equal to the lifetime sum of discounted
25:666:55332:16:12:72:539:434:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:streams of flow utility from consumption,u(c(t)), while the latter isu′(c(t)). Then the VSL for a particular

25:700:56153:12:12:72:539:219:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:the other elements are either constant or relatively inconsequential. As discussed byHall and Jones (2007),
25:701:56260:12:12:72:539:207:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:the critical issue is the level ofγ, which the inverse of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution in con-
25:702:56370:12:12:71:539:195:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:sumption, and it is the rate at which the marginal utility of consumption declines. When that rate is high,
25:703:56477:12:12:71:539:183:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:the marginal utility of consumption falls quickly as consumption rises overtime. Ifγis sufficiently high that
25:704:56586:12:11:71:540:171:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:the marginal utility of consumption falls faster than the marginal utility of life, the VSL rises. Whenγis
25:705:56692:11:12:71:539:160:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:low, the reverse is true. And to a first approximation, the consumption elasticity of the VSL, is roughly
25:706:56797:12:17:71:119:148:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:equal toγ:

25:710:56829:0:23:338:357:131:10:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f10:≈γ.
25:711:56832:23:12:72:523:108:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:Murphy and Topel (2006) provide a more extensive theoretical treatment and arrive at a similar result.
25:712:56934:12:12:81:540:96:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:A problem is thatγis an unknown parameter. Empirical studies, which are typically based on financial
25:713:57034:12:12:72:540:84:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:data, do not agree on its magnitude, and its value in calibration exercises rangesbetween 0.5, 1, 2, and can
25:714:57142:12:0:72:384:72:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:be larger. As a result, it is better to rely on direct estimations ofηV SL.
26:715:57219:0:24:89:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Uncertainty about the magnitude ofηV SLis a clear hindrance for studies of the value
26:716:57303:24:24:72:539:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of health improvements or harms over long historical periods.Such studies have typically
26:717:57391:24:24:72:539:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:assumedηV SL≥1, as reported by Costa and Kahn (2004) and Rohlfs (2006) because such
26:718:57474:24:24:71:539:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a level is consistent with other microeconometric estimates ofparameters and appears to
26:719:57561:24:24:71:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fit historical trends better. For example, Nordhaus (2003) assumesηV SL= 1 but suspects
26:720:57648:24:24:71:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that is too low given the rising share of GDP that is devoted to health spending; that trend
26:721:57740:24:24:71:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:suggests the marginal utility of consumption must be falling faster than the marginal utility
26:722:57833:24:24:71:539:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of living, henceηV SL>1. Murphy and Topel (2006) argue that an array of indirect micro
26:723:57919:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and macro empirical evidence suggestsηV SL>1.33, and Hall and Jones (2007) make a
26:724:58000:24:24:71:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:similar assumption. While the empirical literature does not speak with one voice on what
26:725:58088:24:23:71:539:468:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:ηV SLis, the emerging consensus at least in longitudinal studies seems to be that it is equal
26:726:58181:23:24:71:196:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to or greater than unity.
26:727:58206:24:24:89:539:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Because there is uncertainty aboutηV SL, I produce two sets of time series of the VSL, one
26:728:58296:24:24:71:539:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:based on the findings of Costa and Kahn (2004) and the other on Viscusi and Aldy (2003).
26:729:58384:24:24:71:539:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:First, I use the estimates reported by Costa and Kahn (2004) of theVSL between 1940 and
26:730:58471:24:24:71:539:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:1980 and forecast and backcast it using their estimate ofηV SL= 1.5, inflating all into 2008
26:731:58563:24:24:71:540:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:dollars. These estimates are shown in the third column of Table 6,where the implied VSL
26:732:58650:24:24:71:471:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ranges from $93,000 in 1783 to $1.9 million in 1945 and $14.9 million in 2008.
26:733:58728:24:24:89:539:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Alternatively, I estimate a time series using the results of Viscusi and Aldy (2003), who
26:734:58817:24:24:71:539:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:settle on a median estimate of $7 million per statistical life in 2000 and an elasticity of
26:735:58908:24:24:71:539:229:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:ηV SL= 0.5 or 0.6.  I inflate the $7 million figure to 2008 dollars using theCPI, and I
26:736:58995:24:23:71:539:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:backcast and forecast the VSL usingηV SL= 0.5.  This time series appears in the sixth
26:737:59080:23:24:71:540:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:column of Table 6. Because the assumed income elasticity is lower, the backcast VSL is
26:738:59166:24:24:71:540:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:considerably higher, $1.6 million in 1783 and $5.3 million in1945. But the forecast is lower
26:739:59258:24:24:71:539:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:than in the Costa and Kahn (2004) series, reaching $9.2 million in 2008. This is still higher
26:740:59351:24:24:71:540:110:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:than other recent estimates in which the VSL is assumed to be fixed in real terms, such as
26:741:59441:24:0:71:437:86:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the level of $7.2 million in 2007 assumed by Stiglitz and Bilmes(2008).

27:743:59560:32:24:72:539:676:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The other columns in Table 6 tally the estimated costs associatedwith death and disability
27:744:59650:24:24:72:540:652:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:among service members for as many major U.S. wars as I have data.I can place values on
27:745:59736:24:24:72:540:628:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:lives lost back to the Revolutionary War, but data limitations preclude me from calculating
27:746:59827:24:24:72:539:604:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the costs associated with disability for cohorts of veteran who served before World War
27:747:59914:24:24:72:539:580:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:II. The cost associated with death is the product of the number ofwar fatalities and the
27:748:60002:24:24:72:539:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:estimated VSL at the end of the war the number of war deaths, whichequals the aggregate
27:749:60089:24:23:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:willingness to pay to avoid them.  Similarly, the cost of disability is the product of the
27:750:60179:23:24:72:540:509:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:number of surviving veterans, the lifetime average VA disability rating estimated for that
27:751:60269:24:24:72:540:485:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cohort, and the VSL. The implicit assumption is that beingxpercent disabled is equivalent
27:752:60358:24:24:72:213:461:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to losingxpercent of a life.
27:753:60386:24:24:89:539:437:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:These costs are very large regardless of which VSL baseline I use. This is because the
27:754:60472:24:24:71:539:413:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:levels of the VSL always tend to be high regardless of their income elasticity. The cost of
27:755:60563:24:24:71:540:389:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:World War II deaths ranges from $764 billion to $2.2 trillion, or between roughly 20 and 50
27:756:60654:24:24:71:540:365:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:percent of the direct military cost. In the case of the Civil War, the costs associated with
27:757:60746:24:24:71:540:341:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:deaths are several orders of magnitude greater than the direct military costs. Costs of deaths
27:758:60840:24:24:71:540:317:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in Iraq and Afghanistan total between $50 and $80 billion depending on on the VSL series
27:759:60928:24:24:71:97:293:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:used.
27:760:60933:24:23:89:539:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The costs of disability are very large also because the VSL is high,and also because
27:761:61017:23:24:71:540:246:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:lifetime average VA disability rates among veteran cohorts are high, especially among the
27:762:61106:24:24:71:540:222:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Vietnam and later cohorts. Disability among the World War II cohort was less costly than
27:763:61194:24:24:71:540:198:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:deaths, presumably because the mortality rate was sufficiently high relative to VA disability
27:764:61287:24:24:71:540:174:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rates among survivors. In Korea, however, survival had improved enough to push the costs
27:765:61375:24:24:71:539:150:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of disability to around two or three times the cost of deaths. This trend has continued. For
27:766:61467:24:24:71:540:126:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:each of the last three conflicts starting with Vietnam, I estimatethe costs of disability to be
27:767:61562:24:24:71:540:102:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:$2 trillion or more, a figure that dwarfs all associated budgetary costs and is large relative
27:768:61656:24:0:71:539:78:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to other recent estimates.  By comparison, Stiglitz and Bilmes (2008) estimate the total
28:769:61746:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:costs of disability to be between $250 and $367 billion,24while Wallsten and Kosec (2005)
28:770:61835:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:project $100 billion. If the lifetime average VA disability rate among OEF/OIF soldiers were
28:771:61927:24:24:72:539:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:1 percent rather than my extrapolation of 9.4 percent, then the costs of statistical injury
28:772:62018:24:24:72:539:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:would total between $200 and $300 billion, or about a ninth ofthe estimates shown in Table
28:773:62108:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:6. If VA disability rates for this cohort were instead to remainat the level of 2.9 percent
28:774:62199:24:54:72:511:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:shown in Table 4, total costs of disability would range between $550 and $900 billion.
28:775:62285:54:36:72:391:534:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:6  A counterfactual: Peacetime costs
28:776:62321:36:24:72:540:498:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In assessing the costs of war, it is worthwhile to posit a counterfactual scenario in order
28:777:62412:24:24:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to gauge costs in relation to alternatives. The difficulty lies in imagining a world without
28:778:62504:24:24:72:540:450:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:war. An extreme scenario in which no standing army is maintainedseems especially far-
28:779:62589:24:24:72:539:426:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fetched, but other baselines may seem equally implausible. A useful if perhaps not completely
28:780:62682:24:24:72:539:402:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:plausible counterfactual is to imagine the U.S. maintaining apeacetime military only. Such
28:781:62772:24:23:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a scenario implicitly assumes that the power of deterrence alone could prevent war, which
28:782:62861:23:24:72:162:355:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:may not be right.
28:783:62878:24:24:89:539:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Table 5 reveals that even peacetime veterans claim VA disability, although at much lower
28:784:62966:24:24:72:540:307:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:average rates because the prevalence of disability is reduced. On average, the peacetime vet-
28:785:63059:24:24:72:539:283:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:erans in Table 5 experience disability rates between 2 and 6 times as high as similar wartime
28:786:63152:24:24:72:539:259:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:veterans in Table 4, with a focal point of about 2.5.  It is moredifficult to compare VA
28:787:63240:24:24:72:539:235:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:spending per veteran between wartime and peacetime veterans.But to the extent the His-
28:788:63326:24:24:72:540:211:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:torical Statistics allow the analysis, they reveal a roughly similar story. The ratio of spending
28:789:63423:24:24:72:540:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:per wartime veteran to spending per peacetime veteran averaged about 2.5 for compensation
28:790:63512:24:24:72:540:163:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and health spending combined between 1960 and 1970, and 1.9 for compensation alone. And
28:791:63599:24:24:72:540:139:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for the entire period from 1960 to 1997, compensation was also about 1.9 times higher for
28:792:63688:24:17:72:540:115:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:wartime veterans. A factor of 2.5 separating costs per capita seems like a reasonable figure
28:793:63780:17:16:81:540:98:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:24Here I am counting all the social economic costs listed by Stiglitz and Bilmes(2008) in Table 4.1, minus
28:794:63886:16:0:72:376:82:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:the cost of deaths, and not including the offsetting disability benefits.
29:795:63961:0:24:72:407:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:given the evidence on disability and need and on actual transfers.
29:796:64027:24:24:89:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The other major difference between peacetime and wartime is force strength, which deter-
29:797:64115:24:24:71:539:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:mines the number of veterans produced. Estimates in Table 5 suggest that roughly 250,000
29:798:64203:24:24:71:539:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:unique veterans are produced per year in peacetime. This rate may have fallen in recent
29:799:64290:24:24:71:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:years under the all-volunteer force, but it is roughly consistent with data on annual military
29:800:64384:24:24:71:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:accessions during the 1990s.25As revealed in Table 1, wartime troop levels vary widely across
29:801:64477:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:conflicts. During the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, there has been no apparent increase in
29:802:64567:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:force strength above peacetime levels, although reservists andNational Guard have been
29:803:64653:24:24:72:539:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:utilized to an unprecedented degree. Excluding the most recent war, a reasonable baseline
29:804:64742:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is that a wartime year produces a million veterans, or 4 times as many as a peacetime year.
29:805:64833:24:23:72:539:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Combining the factor of 2.5 from the difference in per capita benefits with the four-fold
29:806:64922:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:increase in veterans yields a difference of a factor of 10 between wartime and peacetime
29:807:65010:24:24:72:150:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:veterans’ costs.
29:808:65026:24:24:89:539:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:By comparison, real direct military spending on recent wars has averaged about $125
29:809:65109:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:billion per year, equal to roughly 25 percent of the average real defense budget over the past
29:810:65203:24:24:72:539:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:two decades. That is, each year of war raises direct military spending by 25 percent. The
29:811:65292:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:direct costs of warfare can certainly be high, as evidenced bythe accumulated total for the
29:812:65383:24:24:72:539:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which currently exceeds a trillion dollars over 9 years. But
29:813:65473:24:24:72:539:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the component of military costs that is most sensitive to military action actually appears to
29:814:65566:24:24:72:312:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:be future veterans’ compensation and benefits.
29:815:65612:24:24:89:540:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This result would be bolstered if the total costs were expanded to include any uncom-
29:816:65697:24:23:72:539:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:pensated costs of injury and death that are borne by veterans. The sensitivity of veterans’
29:817:65788:23:24:72:539:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:costs to warfare is also more salient because direct military spending raises GDP and thus
29:818:65878:24:18:72:492:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:lowers its net fiscal impact, while the same may not be true for veterans’ benefits.
29:819:65962:18:16:81:540:140:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:25These data, reported in Table 584 of the 2000 Statistical Abstract of the U.S., show first enlistments
29:820:66066:16:12:72:539:124:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:at about 180,000 per year and reenlistments around 190,000 during the 1990s.Considering that the overall
29:821:66170:12:12:72:540:112:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:force size was roughly stationary during this period, these statistics suggest that the annual production of
29:822:66278:12:0:72:200:100:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:veterans was around 200,000.
30:823:66308:0:36:72:194:708:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:7  Conclusion
30:824:66321:36:24:72:539:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Since the Civil War, at least a third of the federal budgetary costs associated with warfare
30:825:66413:24:24:72:540:648:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:have been decidedly long-lived. Direct military spending still accounts for the majority of
30:826:66504:24:24:72:539:624:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:war-related spending, but veterans’ benefits represent a significant minority that follows a
30:827:66596:24:24:72:539:600:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:very different life cycle. In this paper, I have shown that as much as 80 percent of the total
30:828:66690:24:24:72:539:576:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:present value of U.S. war spending in a conflict has been allocated to veterans’ compensation
30:829:66783:24:24:72:539:552:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and benefits, which are spread out over the relatively long remaining life spans of veterans
30:830:66875:24:24:72:539:528:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and their survivors. Even for short, seemingly cheap engagements like the Spanish American
30:831:66965:24:23:72:539:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:War or the more recent First Gulf War, the unfunded liability of future veterans’ benefits
30:832:67055:23:24:72:254:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:looms as a significant fiscal burden.
30:833:67092:24:24:89:539:457:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The half life of the present value of veterans’ costs tends to be 30 years or more. The
30:834:67179:24:24:71:540:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:front-loading of benefits through educational subsidies likethe G.I. Bill tends to reduce the
30:835:67272:24:24:71:540:409:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:half life of costs, but the net effect of such an expansion is to raisethe fiscal burden, not
30:836:67365:24:24:71:539:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reduce it. The committing of troops to a war zone has lasting implications for fiscal policy
30:837:67457:24:24:71:540:361:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in addition to short-term impacts on the economy and tax revenues via direct military
30:838:67542:24:24:71:539:337:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:spending. Depending on the scope of the conflict, the unfunded obligation to pay future
30:839:67629:24:24:71:539:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:veterans’ benefits starting from the end of the conflict can range from 5 to 50 percent of
30:840:67719:24:24:71:273:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:GDP. This is a very large commitment.
30:841:67756:24:24:89:539:265:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:It is less clear what the net effects of transfers to veterans andtheir dependents may be.
30:842:67846:24:23:72:539:241:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:As opposed to military purchases, transfers do not affect income unless the propensity to
30:843:67935:23:24:72:539:218:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:spend them is higher than it is among taxpayers. At worst, highertax rates needed to fund
30:844:68024:24:24:72:540:194:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:transfers are disincentives to work and save that may have a depressing effect on GDP. At
30:845:68113:24:24:72:539:170:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:its root, veterans’ spending is designed either to compensate for service-related disability or
30:846:68208:24:24:72:539:146:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for time served, or to treat injuries. One of the open questions is to what extent veterans
30:847:68299:24:24:72:539:122:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:are compensated for their injuries. Estimates of the private cost of war-related injuries and
30:848:68392:24:24:72:539:98:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:deaths seem to imply there are many uncompensated wounds of war. Part of this is due to
30:849:68479:24:0:72:539:74:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:high estimates of the value of a statistical life, and part is dueto high VA disability rates
31:850:68574:0:24:72:245:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:among recent cohorts of veterans.
31:851:68607:24:24:89:539:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This study has omitted any costs of war associated with the loss of civilian life or the
31:852:68695:24:24:71:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:destruction of capital. Nor has it assessed the costs borne by opposing sides in conflicts nor
31:853:68789:24:24:71:539:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the costs of military inaction. As a result, I have little to say about the calculus of military
31:854:68885:24:24:71:539:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:conflict that might lead governments to war or peace, which isa clear gap in our knowledge
31:855:68975:24:24:71:539:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and a subject of much interesting research Blattman and Miguel (2010). My goals have been
31:856:69064:24:24:71:539:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to illustrate the life cycle of veterans’ costs and assess their fiscal implications, which are
31:857:69159:24:0:71:99:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:large.

41:1128:84516:14:14:72:540:289:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:year of the conflict. I specify two alternative time series of the VSL by extrapolating from the results of
