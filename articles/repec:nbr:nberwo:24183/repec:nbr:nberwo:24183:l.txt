2:36:2040:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:We  investigate  the  relationship  between  the  opening  of  a  city’s  subway  network  and  its  air 
2:37:2145:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:quality. We find that particulate concentrations drop by 4% in a 10km radius disk surrounding a 
2:38:2240:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:city  center following  a  subway  system  opening.  The  effect  is  larger  near  the  city  center  and 
2:39:2346:14:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:persists over the longest time horizon that we can measure with our data, about eight years. We 
2:40:2441:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:estimate  that  a  new  subway system  provides  an  external  mortality  benefit  of  about  $594m  per 
2:41:2545:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:year. Although available subway capital cost estimates are crude, the estimated external mortality 
2:42:2643:14:42:72:358:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:effects represent a significant fraction of construction costs.

3:69:3245:0:30:70:154:724:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:1. Introduction
3:70:3260:30:18:70:541:694:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We  investigate  the  effect  of  subway  system  openings  on  urban  air  pollution.   We  rely  on  two
3:71:3366:18:18:70:541:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:principal data sources.   The first describes the universe of world subway systems.   The second
3:72:3462:18:18:70:541:658:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is a remotely sensed measure of particulates, Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), recorded by the Mod-
3:73:3557:18:18:70:541:640:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:erate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Terra and Aqua earth observing
3:74:3649:18:18:70:541:622:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:satellites between2000and2014. These data allow us to measure airborne particulates everywhere
3:75:3743:18:17:70:541:604:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the world, monthly, with approximately3km spatial resolution.  Our strategy for establishing
3:76:3838:17:18:70:541:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the causal effect of subways on AOD relies on a comparison of changes in particulates within a
3:77:3932:18:18:70:334:569:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:city around the time of a new subway system opening.
3:78:3984:18:18:85:541:551:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The data provides clear evidence of a structural break in an average city’s AOD level around
3:79:4076:18:18:70:541:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the time that it opens its subway network and does not indicate a trend break at any time in our
3:80:4172:18:18:70:541:515:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sampling frame.   The magnitude of this break is about4% and is about constant over48post-
3:81:4262:18:18:70:540:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:subway months.  In fact, the4% decrease in AOD is evident over all96post subway months we
3:82:4351:18:18:70:515:479:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:observe, although estimates over this longer horizon are less precise and less well identified.
3:83:4446:18:18:85:541:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Consistent with the fact that subways tend to disproportionately serve central cities, we find
3:84:4540:18:18:70:541:443:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that the effect of subway openings declines with distance from the city center.  The data indicate
3:85:4638:18:18:70:541:425:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that subways do not have the same effect on AOD in all cities. We find no evidence that richer, more
3:86:4738:18:18:70:541:407:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:populous, more rainy, or cities that open more extensive networks respond differently to subway
3:87:4833:18:18:70:541:389:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:openings, although we find suggestive evidence that more polluted and Asian cities experience
3:88:4926:18:18:70:541:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:larger AOD decreases following a subway opening.  Finally, we find that subway openings have
3:89:5018:18:18:70:541:353:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:larger effects on AOD and on ridership than do the first expansions, and that the effect of the first
3:90:5119:18:17:70:302:335:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:expansion is larger than subsequent expansions.
3:91:5166:17:18:85:541:318:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Our findings are important for three reasons. Subways are often proposed as a policy response
3:92:5259:18:18:70:541:300:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to urban air pollution.  For example, Vollmer Associateset al.(2011) list air pollution reduction as
3:93:5359:18:18:70:541:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:an objective for New York City’s2nd avenue subway expansion. Our analysis provides a basis for
3:94:5453:18:18:70:541:264:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:assessing their cost effectiveness relative to other remediation policies.  Apart from this paper, we
3:95:5554:18:18:70:541:246:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are aware of only one study, Chen and Whalley (2012), that measures the effect of subways on air
3:96:5650:18:18:70:541:228:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:pollution.  Like the present investigation, Chen and Whalley (2012) use an event study research
3:97:5745:18:18:70:541:210:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:design. Unlike the present study, Chen and Whalley (2012) study the opening of a single subway.
3:98:5840:18:18:70:541:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In contrast, we study all of the43subway openings and104expansions that occurred anywhere
3:99:5929:18:18:70:541:174:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the world between February2000and December2014.  Thus, we dramatically improve on our
3:100:6017:18:18:70:466:156:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ability to assess whether subway construction, in fact, reduces urban air pollution.
3:101:6101:18:18:85:541:138:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Second, our estimates of the reduction in pollution following subway openings and expansions,
3:102:6194:18:18:70:541:120:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:together with existing estimates of the health implications of particulates, allow us to calculate the
3:103:6296:18:18:70:541:102:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:value of averted mortality that follows from subway openings.  We estimate that, for an average
3:104:6391:18:17:70:541:84:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:city in our sample,  a subway opening prevents9.4infant and221total deaths per year.   Using
3:105:6483:17:0:70:541:67:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:standard income-adjusted life values, this averted mortality is worth $21m and $594m per year,
4:106:6578:0:18:70:541:724:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:respectively.  These estimates do not include the effects of particulate reduction on morbidity or
4:107:6676:18:18:70:541:706:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on productivity and so probably understate actual health benefits.   Although available subway
4:108:6770:18:18:70:541:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:capital cost estimates are crude, the estimated external health effects represent a significant fraction
4:109:6874:18:18:70:541:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of construction costs, particularly for subway systems with costs at the low end of the observed
4:110:6970:18:18:70:100:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:range.
4:111:6976:18:18:85:541:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Finally,  little  is  known  about  transportation  behavior  in  developing  countries,  and  we  shed
4:112:7079:18:18:70:541:616:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:indirect light on this important topic. First, and interestingly, we find no evidence that developing
4:113:7180:18:18:70:541:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:world and developed world cities respond differently to subways.  This supports the idea that, at
4:114:7277:18:18:70:541:580:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:least in this regard, the two classes of cities are similar. Second, a back of the envelope calculation
4:115:7380:18:17:70:540:562:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:suggests that subways typically account for between1.5%-10% of trips within a few years of their
4:116:7476:17:18:70:541:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:opening.   Given  what  is  known  about  the  relationship  between  subway  ridership  and  traffic,
4:117:7578:18:18:70:541:527:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and between traffic andpm10 , this level of ridership can plausibly account for the observed4%
4:118:7672:18:18:70:541:509:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:reduction in particulates that follows a subway opening only if subways divert trips that would
4:119:7767:18:18:70:541:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:otherwise  have  occurred  in  particularly  dirty  vehicles  or  at  particularly  congested  times.   This
4:120:7875:18:18:70:541:473:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is consistent with evidence that public transit serves the poor and that subways are much more
4:121:7969:18:32:70:285:455:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:heavily used at peak times for vehicle traffic.

4:123:8029:30:18:70:541:393:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:While the effects of subways have been studied extensively, these studies have overwhelmingly
4:124:8122:18:18:70:541:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:focused on within-city variation in the relationship between proximity to a subway and housing
4:125:8216:18:17:70:540:357:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:prices or population density,  e.g.,  Gibbons and Machin (2005) or Billings (2011).   There are few
4:126:8315:17:18:70:541:340:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:studies which, like ours, exploit cross-city variation in subways.  Among the exceptions, Baum-
4:127:8410:18:18:70:541:322:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Snow and Kahn (2005) study a small sample of US subway systems to examine the relationship
4:128:8500:18:18:70:541:304:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:between subways and ridership, Voith (1997) also examines a cross-section of cities to investigate
4:129:8598:18:18:70:541:286:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the relationship between subways and ridership.   Finally,  Gonzalez-Navarro and Turner (2016)
4:130:8692:18:18:70:541:268:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:exploits the same underlying panel data on subway stations that we use here to examine the effect
4:131:8789:18:18:70:349:250:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of subway systems on long run urban population growth.
4:132:8843:18:18:85:541:232:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To our knowledge, the literature contains only a single paper (Chen and Whalley,2012) exam-
4:133:8934:18:18:70:541:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ining the relationship between subways and urban air quality. Chen and Whalley (2012) examine
4:134:9027:18:18:70:541:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:changes in air pollution in central Taipei during the year before and after the opening of the Taipei
4:135:9128:18:18:70:541:178:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:subway  in  March  of1996.   Chen  and  Whalley  (2012)  use  hourly  pollution  measurements  from
4:136:9227:18:18:70:541:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:several measuring stations in central Taipei,  together with hourly ridership data over the same
4:137:9323:18:18:70:541:142:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:period. By examining the change in pollution levels around the time of the system opening, Chen
4:138:9418:18:18:70:541:124:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and Whalley (2012) estimate an approximately5%-15% reduction in Carbon Monoxide from the
4:139:9506:18:18:70:541:106:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:subway  opening,  about  the  same  effect  on  Nitrous  Oxides,  but  little  effect  on  either  Ozone  or
4:140:9614:18:0:70:129:88:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:particulates.
5:141:9628:0:18:85:541:724:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:It is useful to contrast this with our findings.  We employ essentially the same research design,
5:142:9725:18:18:70:541:706:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:but consider the universe of subway cities over a considerably longer time horizon.  On the other
5:143:9822:18:18:70:541:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:hand, we are restricted to a single measure of pollution, AOD, and to monthly frequencies.  Our
5:144:9917:18:18:70:541:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:results  are  slightly  different.   Chen  and  Whalley  (2012)  find  that  the  Taipei  subway  caused  a
5:145:10024:18:18:70:541:652:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:B:5-15%  reduction  in  Carbon  Monoxide.   The  confidence  interval  we  estimate  for  AOD  overlaps
5:146:10125:18:18:70:541:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:substantially with this range.  However, Chen and Whalley (2012) find no effect on particulates,
5:147:10221:18:18:70:541:616:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:although our estimated4% effect lies well within the confidence bounds of their estimated effect
5:148:10317:18:18:70:541:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the subway opening on Taipei’s particulates.  Together with the fact that our estimates indicate
5:149:10416:18:18:70:541:580:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:considerable heterogeneity in the effect of subways across cities, this suggests the difference be-
5:150:10515:18:17:70:541:562:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tween our finding and Chen and Whalley (2012) may reflect sampling error.  Unfortunately, the
5:151:10608:17:18:70:541:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:opening of the Taipei subway predates the availability of the remotely sensed AOD data on which
5:152:10703:18:18:70:541:527:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:our analysis is based, so we cannot carry out a replication of the Chen and Whalley (2012) result in
5:153:10803:18:32:70:127:509:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:our sample.

5:155:10821:30:18:70:541:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:To investigate the effect of subways on urban air pollution we require data for a panel of cities
5:156:10918:18:18:70:541:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:describing  subways,  air  pollution,  and  control  variables.   Our  air  pollution  data  are  based  on
5:157:11025:18:18:70:541:411:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:remotely sensed measures of suspended particulates. Our subways data are the result of primary
5:158:11119:18:18:70:541:393:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:data collection. We describe these data and their construction below, before turning to a description
5:159:11220:18:30:70:165:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of control variables.

5:161:11249:25:18:70:541:320:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We use the same subways data as Gonzalez-Navarro and Turner (2016) organized into a monthly
5:162:11340:18:18:70:541:302:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:panel.  These data define a ‘subway’ as an electric powered urban rail system that is completely
5:163:11436:18:18:70:541:284:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:isolated from interactions with automobile traffic and pedestrians.  This excludes most streetcars
5:164:11534:18:18:70:541:266:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:because they interact with vehicle and pedestrian traffic at stoplights and crossings. Underground
5:165:11632:18:18:70:541:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:streetcar segments are counted as subways.  The data do not distinguish between surface, under-
5:166:11727:18:18:70:541:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ground or aboveground subway lines as long as the exclusive right of way condition is satisfied.
5:167:11823:18:18:70:541:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:To focus on intra-urban subway transportation systems,  the data exclude heavy rail commuter
5:168:11915:18:18:70:541:194:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:lines (which tend not to be electric powered). For the most part, these data describe public transit
5:169:12015:18:18:70:541:176:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:systems that would ordinarily be described as ‘subways’, e.g., the Paris metro and the New York
5:170:12110:18:18:70:541:158:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:city subway, and only such systems.  As with any such definition, the inclusion or exclusion of
5:171:12205:18:18:70:297:140:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:particular marginal cases may be controversial.
5:172:12252:18:18:85:541:122:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:On  the  basis  of  this  definition,  the  data  report  the  latitude,  longitude  and  date  of  opening
5:173:12359:18:18:70:541:104:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of  every  subway  station  in  the  world.We  compiled  these  data  manually  between  January

5:175:12547:17:0:70:541:69:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f3:B://www.urbanrail.net/and links therein,  together with links on wikipedia,  we complied a list
6:176:12641:0:18:70:541:724:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of  all  subway  stations  worldwide.   Next,  for  each  station  on  our  list,  we  record  opening  date,
6:177:12750:18:18:70:541:706:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:station  name,  line  name,  terminal  station  indicator,  transfer  station  indicator,  city  and  country.
6:178:12860:18:18:70:541:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We obtain latitude and longitude for each station fromgooglemaps. We use the subways data to
6:179:12952:18:18:70:541:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:construct a monthly panel describing the count of operational stations in each subway city between
6:180:13050:18:18:70:541:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:February2000and December2014, the time period for which our air pollution data is available.
6:181:13142:18:18:70:541:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:By connecting stations with the most direct possible routes, we approximate network maps and
6:182:13234:18:18:70:196:616:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:can calculate route length.

6:184:13350:18:18:70:541:580:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:America, Australia and Africa together account for the remaining16.  These171subway systems
6:185:13441:18:17:70:541:562:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consist of8,889stations.  Subway systems in Europe, North America and Asia are all about the
6:186:13533:17:18:70:541:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:same  size,  and  those  in  South  America  are  distinctly  smaller.   On  average,  the  world  stock  of
6:187:13641:18:18:70:540:527:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:subway stations increased by about200per year and grew by about one third between2000and
6:188:13729:18:18:70:95:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:B:2014.
6:189:13734:18:18:85:541:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Our  data  on  subway  systems  begins  in  the19th  century.   However,  our  satellite  pollution
6:190:13833:18:18:70:541:473:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:measures are more recent. Thus, our analysis will rely on subway openings that occurred between
6:191:13928:18:18:70:541:455:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:B:2000and2014. Table A.2lists all43subway system openings in the world between2000and2014,
6:192:14016:18:18:70:541:437:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by date, together with basic information about the cities where they are located. Subways opened
6:193:14112:18:18:70:541:419:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:fairly uniformly throughout the period and the average opening date is February2007.  During
6:194:14204:18:18:70:541:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:B:2000-2014, an average system at the end of its first year of operation had a route of length19.2km
6:195:14302:18:18:70:403:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and14.3stations, usually on one line, but sometimes on two or more.
6:196:14369:18:18:85:541:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Our analysis hinges on the ability to observe a subway city for some time before and after an
6:197:14462:18:18:70:541:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:opening.   Thus,  we  face  a  trade-off  between  sample  size,  the  length  of  time  we  observe  cities,
6:198:14571:18:18:70:541:329:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and maintaining a constant sample of cities.   While we experiment with other study windows,
6:199:14663:18:18:70:541:311:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f4:B:our primary econometric exercise considers the change in AOD in the period extending from18
6:200:14754:18:17:70:541:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f4:B:months before until18months after a subway opening.  Since the AOD data cover February2000
6:201:14844:17:18:70:541:276:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to December2014, to base this exercise on a constant sample of cities, we must restrict our attention
6:202:14945:18:18:70:541:258:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to subways that open between August2001and July2013.  In Table A.2, we see that these are the
6:203:15038:18:18:70:541:240:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:B:39cities beginning with Rennes and ending with Brescia.  To consider the effect of subways over
6:204:15133:18:18:70:541:222:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a longer horizon, in some specifications we consider a longer period after the subway opening. In
6:205:15230:18:18:70:541:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:this case, maintaining a constant sample of cities for each month requires that we drop cities that
6:206:15329:18:18:70:301:186:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:have openings near the end of the study period.
6:207:15376:18:18:85:541:168:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In  theory,  our  research  design  could  confound  the  effects  of  system  openings  with  those  of
6:208:15480:18:18:70:541:150:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:expansions that occur soon afterward. In fact, this is rare in our data. Among the39cities that make

6:210:15668:18:18:70:541:114:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the system opening.  We also experiment with dropping cities that experience an expansion soon
6:211:15762:18:18:70:475:96:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:after an opening from our sample. Our results are robust to such changes in sample.

7:220:16393:17:18:70:541:369:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:data.  Table A.2also reports mean daily ridership for each city where data is available, at the end
7:221:16492:18:18:70:541:351:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the first year of the system’s operation.  For an average city in our sample, about97,514people
7:222:16590:18:18:70:470:333:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rode the subway on an average day in the twelfth month of the system’s operation.

7:224:16764:18:18:70:541:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:years of system operation. The horizontal axis in this figure is months from the opening date. The

7:226:16961:18:18:70:540:261:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the three years following system opening and stabilizes at about60riders per thousand residents.
7:227:17057:18:18:85:541:243:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, we determine the date when construction began for each subway opening in our sam-
7:228:17147:18:18:70:541:225:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ple.  On average, construction begins80months prior to opening.  The25th and75th percentile of

7:230:17335:18:18:70:541:189:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:construction duration is important because it allows us to check whether the effect of subways on
7:231:17432:18:30:70:422:171:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:pollution is determined by the opening or the construction of the system.

8:247:18739:18:18:70:541:227:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:B:2016, we downloaded all available granules and subsequently consolidated them into daily rasters

9:271:20272:18:18:70:541:326:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ingly,  the figures show high AOD in India and China.   Myhreet al.(2008) attribute high AOD
9:272:20364:18:18:70:541:308:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:over Central and Western Africa to anthropogenic biomass burning in the region.   White areas
9:273:20457:18:18:70:541:290:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:indicate missing data.  Because they are highly reflective, the algorithm for recovering AOD from
9:274:20554:18:18:70:541:272:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:reflectance values performs poorly over light surfaces, so missing data is common in desert regions
9:275:20653:18:18:70:224:254:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and over snow (Levyet al.2013).
9:276:20684:18:18:85:541:236:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Themodisinstrumentation can only record AOD on cloud free days. In the June1image, much
9:277:20771:18:18:70:541:218:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the missing data reflects cloud cover,  though some reflects the fact that TERRA’s polar orbit
9:278:20868:18:18:70:541:200:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:brings it over most, but not all of the earth’s surface each day. Because AOD reporting is sensitive
9:279:20968:18:18:70:541:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to cloud cover and light surfaces, there is seasonality in the MODIS data.  We see more missing
9:280:21063:18:18:70:541:164:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:data in the Northern Hemisphere in the Winter than in the Summer. The counter-cyclical Southern

9:282:21212:18:17:85:541:128:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:With daily images in hand, it is straightforward to construct monthly averages. Figure3panel
9:283:21304:17:18:70:541:111:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(a) illustrates the AOD data for Bangalore in June of2014.  To show scale, the large circle in this
9:284:21403:18:18:70:541:93:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:image is10km in radius.  Bangalore is noteworthy in two regards.  First, there are relatively few
9:285:21500:18:0:70:541:75:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:pixels for which we have no AOD reading over the month. Second, there is a wide range in AOD
10:286:21593:0:18:70:541:724:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:readings at this scale of observation.  The corresponding picture for Delhi is entirely black.  Panel
10:287:21694:18:18:70:411:706:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(b) provides the corresponding image for Bangalore in December2014.
10:288:21761:18:18:85:541:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We construct the monthly images presented in Figure3by averaging within each pixel over
10:289:21848:18:18:70:541:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the  course  of  a  month.   This  means  that,  if  we  were  to  average  over  an  area  in  the  monthly
10:290:21956:18:18:70:541:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:images,  a pixel which we observe only once during the month would receive the same weight
10:291:22046:18:18:70:541:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:as one that we observe many times.  Therefore, to calculate city level monthly AOD measure, we
10:292:22140:18:18:70:541:616:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:instead average over a whole disk centered on the city for each day, and then average these city
10:293:22236:18:18:70:541:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:day measures,  weighting by the number of pixels observed in each day.   Thus,  our measure of
10:294:22330:18:18:70:541:580:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:AOD within10km of the center of a city is an average of all pixel-days of AOD readings that fall
10:295:22426:18:17:70:541:562:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in this region during the month. We calculate this average for both satellites using disks of radius
10:296:22526:17:18:70:357:545:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:B:r∈{10km, 25km, 50km, 150km}for all cities in our sample.
10:297:22582:18:18:85:541:527:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Table1provides  worldwide  and  continental  summary  statistics.   In2014,  the  average  AOD
10:298:22676:18:18:70:541:509:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:reading  within10km  of  a  city  center  from  the  Aqua  satellite  was0.42.   It  was  higher  in  Asian
10:299:22783:18:18:70:541:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cities,0.56, and dramatically lower in European and North American cities.  The corresponding
10:300:22876:18:18:70:541:473:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:reading from Terra is slightly higher.  The top panel of Table1also reports AOD measurements
10:301:22968:18:18:70:541:455:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:based on disks with radius25km centered on each city.  Unsurprisingly, these larger disks have
10:302:23062:18:18:70:541:437:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:slightly lower AOD levels than the smaller and more central10km disks.  As for the10km disks,
10:303:23155:18:18:70:541:419:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:AOD measures based on Terra are slightly higher than those for Aqua, and Asian cities are more
10:304:23249:18:18:70:541:401:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:polluted than non-Asian cities.  Table A.2reports the mean and standard deviation of AOD for
10:305:23341:18:18:70:346:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:each of our43new subway cities using the Terra satellite.
10:306:23398:18:18:85:541:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In an average month, the AOD reading for an average10km city disk is based on109pixel-days
10:307:23488:18:18:70:541:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for Aqua and123for Terra.  Since the pixels are nominally3km, if all possible pixel-days in a10k
10:308:23584:18:18:70:541:329:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:disk were recorded over a month, we would expect about(365/12)×π×(10km/3km)2=1061
10:309:23665:18:18:70:541:311:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:pixels.  Thus, conditional on observing one or more pixel-days, our city-month AOD values are
10:310:23758:18:17:70:541:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:based on measurements of about10% of possible pixel-days.  About10% of city-months contain
10:311:23848:17:18:70:541:276:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:zero  pixel-day  observations  and  do  not  appear  in  our  sample.   An  average  AOD  reading  in  a
10:312:23952:18:18:70:541:258:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:B:25km disk is based on about9times as many pixel-days as the smaller10km disks. Since the area
10:313:24045:18:18:70:541:240:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:covered by these disks is only about6times as large, we record a higher proportion of possible
10:314:24139:18:18:70:541:222:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:measurements in the large disks.  We suspect that this reflects two factors.  First, that the satellites
10:315:24243:18:18:70:541:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:may be worse measuring AOD over highly reflective built environments, and so do worse over
10:316:24333:18:18:70:541:186:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:more densely built up central cities.   Second,  pixels are included in a disk on the basis of their
10:317:24433:18:18:70:516:168:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:centroid location, and this makes it easier for the smaller disks to ‘just miss’ including pixels.
10:318:24531:18:18:85:541:150:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The second panel of Table1presents AOD averages for2000for10and25km disks.  Because
10:319:24614:18:18:70:541:132:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:only the Terra satellite was in operation in2000, the second panel presents only these measures.
10:320:24710:18:18:70:541:114:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Comparing  across  years,  we  see  that  variation  across  years  is  small  compared  to  the  level  and
10:321:24818:18:18:70:541:96:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:compared to variation across continents.  Table1suggests a slight downward trend in European
10:322:24910:18:18:70:541:78:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and North American AOD, a slight upward trend in South American and Asia, and no obvious
10:323:24998:18:0:70:224:60:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:trend in the43cities as a whole.

11:343:26045:18:17:70:541:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:seasonal pattern in AOD. This reflects seasonal variation in cloud cover and motivates our use of
11:344:26142:17:18:70:379:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:city-by-calendar month indicators in all of our main regressions.
11:345:26207:18:18:85:541:340:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Together  the  two  panels  of  Figure  A.1suggest  that  a  relationship  exists  between  the  extent
11:346:26310:18:18:70:541:322:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of coverage and the level of AOD. In fact, a regression of average AOD in a city-month disk on
11:347:26404:18:18:70:541:304:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the count of pixel-days used to calculate that average reveals a slightly positive relationship.  We
11:348:26504:18:18:70:541:286:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:conjecture that this reflects the fact that the air is cleaner in rainy places where cloud cover is more
11:349:26608:18:18:70:541:268:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:common. Regardless of the reason, we have experimented broadly with sampling rules that reduce
11:350:26702:18:18:70:541:250:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the importance of city-months for which AOD data is sparse and with controlling for the count of
11:351:26798:18:18:70:541:232:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:pixel-days used to construct each city-month average. In most of our regression results we control
11:352:26896:18:30:70:464:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for the number of pixel-days used to construct each city-month AOD observation.

11:354:26999:26:18:70:541:158:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In Section4we validate the relationship between the MODIS data and ground based measure-
11:355:27087:18:18:70:541:140:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ments in our sample.  Consistent with the large related literature, which we describe in Section4,
11:356:27185:18:18:70:541:122:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:we find that local weather conditions are important determinants of MODIS AOD. Given this, we
11:357:27278:18:17:70:541:104:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:construct several controls for city-month weather conditions. Thecrugridded dataset from Harris

12:360:27565:0:18:70:541:713:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:calculate monthly and annual averages of these variables over disks centered on each city.  These
12:361:27662:18:18:70:192:695:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are our ‘climate controls’.
12:362:27689:18:18:85:541:677:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We also include city population and country GDP per capita to characterize the level of eco-

12:378:29121:18:18:70:541:364:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:examines the ability of AOD to predict particulates in a set of large cities,  several of which are
12:379:29220:18:17:70:138:346:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:subway cities.
12:380:29234:17:18:85:541:329:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Broadly, this literature concludes that AOD is a good measure of airborne particulates, with two
12:381:29330:18:18:70:541:311:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:caveats. First, satellite reports of AOD describe daytime average conditions over a wide area at the
12:382:29430:18:18:70:541:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:particular time the satellite passes overhead, while ground based instruments record conditions
12:383:29525:18:18:70:541:275:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:at a particular location, often over a period of hours.  This causes an obvious divergence between
12:384:29623:18:18:70:248:257:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:satellite and ground based measures.
12:385:29659:18:18:85:541:239:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In addition, ground based instruments report the concentration of dry particulates, while the
12:386:29752:18:18:70:541:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:satellite based measure has trouble distinguishing water vapor from other particles. This suggests
12:387:29850:18:18:70:541:203:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that some method of accounting for differences in climate will be important when we examine the

14:447:33327:45:17:70:541:397:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:contrast, according to US EPA historical data, during this same period US averagepm10 declined

14:449:33510:18:18:70:541:362:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cities in North America with new subways, while the EPA reports area weighted measures for the
14:450:33604:18:18:70:224:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:US, this seems reasonably close.
14:451:33636:18:18:85:541:326:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:All specifications reported in Table2assume a linear relationship between AOD and PM. Figure
14:452:33728:18:18:70:541:308:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:B:4(a) plots residuals of regressions of PM10and AOD on all controls used in column2of Table2,
14:453:33820:18:18:70:541:290:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:along with linear and locally weighted regression lines. This graph illustrates both how closely the
14:454:33920:18:18:70:492:272:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:two variables track each other and how close to linear is the relationship between them.
14:455:34008:18:18:85:541:254:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In column2,  we conduct the same regression but include linear and quadratic terms in our
14:456:34097:18:18:70:541:236:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:annual climate variables, counts of AOD pixel-days, and continent indicators.  The coefficient on
14:457:34194:18:18:70:541:218:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:AOD drops from122.85to99.62, and theR2increases to0.75.  In column3, we add controls for
14:458:34282:18:18:70:541:200:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:city population and country GDP. This decreases the coefficient on AOD to75.26and increases the
14:459:34377:18:18:71:541:182:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:B:R2of the regression to0.81.  Columns (4) to (6) replicate (1) to (3) but usepm2.5 as the dependent
14:460:34475:18:18:70:541:164:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:variable.  These regressions have greater predictive power, with qualitatively similar results.  The
14:461:34575:18:18:70:541:146:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:AOD coefficients are about half as large,  which is consistent with thepm10 topm2.5 conversion

14:463:34763:17:18:70:541:111:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:shows analogous regressions for Aqua. We conduct, but do not present, corresponding regressions
14:464:34858:18:20:70:540:93:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:where our AOD measure is based on a25km ring around the city center instead of10km. All results

15:466:35040:0:18:70:168:702:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:are broadly similar.5
15:467:35061:18:18:85:541:684:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Recall that the ground-based instruments and MODIS, in fact,  measure something different.
15:468:35151:18:18:70:541:666:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Ground-based instruments measure pollution at a point over an extended period of time. Remote
15:469:35244:18:18:70:541:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sensing measures particulates across a wide area at an instant. Given this difference, the extent to
15:470:35344:18:18:70:357:630:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:which the two measures appear to agree seems remarkable.
15:471:35400:18:18:85:541:612:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In addition to validating the use of remotely sensed AOD, Table2provides a basis for trans-
15:472:35491:18:18:70:541:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:lating our estimates of the relationship between subways and AOD into a relationship between
15:473:35583:18:18:70:541:576:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:subways andpm2.5 , orpm10 .  To illustrate this process, and to help to describe our data, Figure
15:474:35680:18:17:70:541:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:B:4(b) provides a histogram of the12,169city-months used for our main econometric analysis.  The
15:475:35774:17:18:70:541:541:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:figure provides three different scales for the horizontal axis. The top scale is the raw AOD measure.
15:476:35875:18:18:70:541:523:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The second two axes are affine transformations of the AOD scale intopm10 andpm2.5 based on

15:480:36203:30:18:70:541:425:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In our primary econometric exercise,  we examine changes in AOD around the time that a city
15:481:36294:18:18:70:541:407:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:opens its subway system. Leti=1,...,Iindex subway cities andtindex months between February
15:482:36384:18:18:70:541:389:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:B:2000and December2014. Thus, AODitdenotes AOD in cityiat timet. We are interested in changes
15:483:36475:18:18:70:541:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to AOD in the months around a system opening. In fact, we usually observe each city twice in each
15:484:36572:18:17:70:511:353:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:month, once with each of the two satellites, but suppress the satellite subscript for legibility.
15:485:36669:17:18:85:541:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:If cityiopens its subway in montht′,  then defineτit=t−t′.   That is,τitis ‘months since
15:486:36757:18:18:70:541:318:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the subway opened’, with months before the opening taking negative values.  Letkdescribe the
15:487:36849:18:18:70:541:300:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:window over which we analyze AOD, i.e.,τit∈ {−k,...,0,...,k}. We will most often be interested in
15:488:36946:18:18:70:540:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the case ofk=18, that is, the37month period extending from18months before until18months
15:489:37033:18:20:70:541:264:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:after a subway opening. There are39cities that open a subway for which this entire window falls
15:490:37128:20:14:83:541:244:7:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f3:F:5We note that the results in Table2are quite different from those on which the2013Global burden of disease estimates
15:491:37244:14:19:70:294:230:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:are based (Braueret al.2015). In particular, they estimate
15:492:37302:19:19:243:368:211:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:ln(pm2.5)≈0.8+0.7 ln(AOD).
15:493:37328:19:11:70:541:192:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:Comparing with Table2, we see that these coefficient estimates are quite different. The difference reflects primarily our
15:494:37449:11:11:70:541:181:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:use of the level ofpm2.5 , rather than its logarithm, as the dependent variable.  We also use the level of AOD rather
15:495:37566:11:11:70:541:170:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:than its logarithm as the explanatory variable.  Since AOD is typically around0.5, this turns out not to be important.
15:496:37684:11:11:70:541:159:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:Finally, our sample describes a different and more urban sample of locations, relies on annual rather than daily data, and
15:497:37806:11:10:70:541:148:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:measures AOD using just MODIS data rather than an average of MODIS and a measure imputed using a climate model
15:498:37916:10:11:70:541:138:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:and ground based emissions release information. We prefer the formulation in Table2to that in Braueret al.(2015) for
15:499:38032:11:11:70:541:127:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:three reasons. First, AOD is already a logarithm (see footnote2), so the Braueret al.specification uses the logarithm of
15:500:38152:11:11:70:541:116:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:a logarithm as its main explanatory variable.  Second, mortality and morbidity estimates are typically based on levels
15:501:38270:11:11:70:541:105:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:of pollutants, not on percentage changes, so the dependent variable in our regressions is more immediately useful for
15:502:38387:11:11:70:541:94:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:evaluating the health implications of changes in AOD. Finally, we control for weather conditions, which appears to be
15:503:38504:11:0:70:346:83:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:important. In any case, theR2in both studies is of similar magnitude.

17:583:41084:18:18:70:242:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:they fall outside our study window.

17:585:41207:18:18:70:541:311:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the pattern of seasonality varies across the globe.  The AOD measurements reported by Terra are
17:586:41302:18:18:70:541:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:systematically  larger  than  Aqua,  but  otherwise  the  two  satellites  track  each  other  very  closely.
17:587:41411:18:18:70:541:275:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Remotely sensed AOD may confound water vapor with anthropogenic particles. City-month AOD
17:588:41500:18:18:70:541:257:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:averages are slightly increasing in the number of pixel-days on which they are based. Finally, there
17:589:41600:18:18:70:529:239:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are long run trends in pollution, and these trends are probably different on different continents.
17:590:41698:18:17:85:541:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Given this, we include the following controls in our regressions; a satellite indicator, year-by-
17:591:41795:17:18:70:541:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:continent indicators, and city-by-calendar month indicators.  We also include the count of AOD
17:592:41889:18:18:70:541:186:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:pixel-days used to calculate the city-month AOD and linear and quadratic terms of our monthly
17:593:41982:18:18:70:541:168:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:climate variables. Finally, the control set sometimes includes linear and quadratic terms in country
17:594:42082:18:18:70:541:150:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:level GDP and city level population.  Subject to the change from annual to monthly observations,
17:595:42178:18:18:70:541:132:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:these control variables closely correspond to those we used in our investigation of the relationship

17:597:42315:18:18:85:541:96:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Following Andrews (1993), Hansen (2000), and Andrews (2003), we check for a structural break

18:623:43918:29:18:85:541:274:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:For our main analysis we setk=18. This window length strikes a balance between maintaining
18:624:44008:18:18:70:541:256:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the  set  of  cities  from  which  we  identify  our  coefficient  of  interest  and  having  a  long  analysis
18:625:44119:18:18:70:541:238:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:window.  Thus, we use a37month study window and estimate equation (4) for each month in
18:626:44206:18:18:71:541:220:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:B:j∈ {−14,...,14}with errors clustered at the city level.  We then calculate a Wald test ofα1j=0 for
18:627:44304:18:18:70:540:202:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:eachj.  By including pre- and post-period indicators in these regressions we use all city-months
18:628:44400:18:18:70:541:184:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in  our  sample  to  estimate  city-by-calendar  month  indicators,  continent-by-year  indicators  and
18:629:44503:18:17:70:541:166:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:climate variables, while only using AOD variation near the subway opening date to identify the
18:630:44597:17:18:70:420:149:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:effect of subways on AOD. Panel (a) of Figure5plots these test statistics.
18:631:44671:18:18:85:541:131:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The figure shows a clear pattern.  Wald statistics increase from a low level to a peak right after
18:632:44769:18:18:70:541:113:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the subway opening,  before quickly falling.   That is,  this plot suggests that the subway system
18:633:44867:18:0:70:541:95:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:opening leads to a break in the AOD sequence, and that this break occurs around the time when
19:634:44962:0:18:70:160:724:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:the system opens.6
19:635:44980:18:18:85:541:706:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:On the basis of Panel (a) of Figure5, we assume a break in AOD levels that coincides with the
19:636:45073:18:18:70:541:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:first full month of subway system operations, i.e.,τ=1.  Conditional on such a break, we next
19:637:45166:18:18:70:541:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:check for a change in the trend of AOD associated with subway openings. We proceed much as in
19:638:45259:18:18:70:541:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:our test for a break, but instead look for a change in trend around the time of a subway opening.
19:639:45356:18:28:70:379:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Formally, this means estimating the following set of regressions,

19:643:45538:28:18:70:541:531:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:As before, we estimate the regression (5) for each month inj∈{−14,...,14}with errors clustered at
19:644:45635:18:18:70:541:513:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the city level and calculate the Wald test forα2=0 for each regression.7Panel (b) of Figure5plots

19:646:45825:18:18:70:342:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:not seem to cause a change in the trend of AOD in a city.
19:647:45882:18:18:85:541:459:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Figure5suggests that subway openings cause a one time shift in a city’s level of AOD, and no
19:648:45974:18:17:70:541:441:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:other change in the evolution of AOD. Given this evidence for the existence and timing of an effect
19:649:46073:17:18:70:441:424:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:of subway openings on the evolution of AOD, we turn to estimating its size.9
19:650:46149:18:28:85:326:406:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To illustrate patterns in the data, we also estimate,

19:657:46474:18:18:70:541:285:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:from  those  withτit=0.   Figure5plots  as  dots  the36monthly  values  ofα1jthat  result  from
19:658:46569:18:18:70:541:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:conducting regression (6) withk=18. The vertical axis of this figure indicates AOD. From Table1,
19:659:46665:18:18:70:541:249:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sample mean AOD is about0.44, so monthly variation in AOD is small relative to the mean level.
19:660:46759:18:18:70:476:231:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Inspection of Figure5suggests a drop in AOD around the time of a system opening.
19:661:46839:18:18:85:541:213:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We are concerned that AOD responds not to subway openings,  but to subway construction.
19:662:46926:18:19:70:541:195:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:This might occur for at least three reasons.   First,  construction is dusty,  and so ending it might
19:663:47027:19:14:83:541:176:7:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f3:F:6Andrews (2003) gives (asymptotic) critical values for the test statistic values we have just generated, a ‘sup-Wald’
19:664:47144:14:11:70:541:162:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:test forα1j=0 for allj.  For our case, where the break in question affects only one parameter and where we trim25%
19:665:47258:11:11:70:541:151:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:from the boundaries of the sample, the5% critical value of this statistic is7.87, less than the largest value that we observe
19:666:47383:11:11:70:541:140:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:for the Wald statistic in the months after a system opening.  With this said, our estimation framework differs from the
19:667:47502:11:10:70:502:129:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:one for which this test statistic is derived in several small ways, and so we regard this test with some caution.
19:668:47615:10:14:83:541:119:7:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f3:F:7An alternative would be to simultaneously search for locations of the break and trend break. Hansen (2000) argues
19:669:47729:14:10:70:314:105:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:that sequential searching, as we do, arrives at the same result.
19:670:47793:10:14:83:540:95:7:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f3:F:8All values are well below the10% critical value of6.35given in Andrews (2003). Again, our framework differs from
19:671:47906:14:9:70:466:81:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:the framework under which this test statistic is derived so this test should be regarded with caution.
19:672:48008:9:15:83:541:72:7:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f3:F:9Hansen (2000) provides an elegant method for estimating the location and size of the break along with confidence
19:673:48121:15:0:70:476:57:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:intervals. This method assumes a balanced panel, and so we have not been able to apply it to our data.
20:674:48225:0:18:70:541:724:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:reduce pollution independent of the effect of the opening of the subway.  Second, construction is
20:675:48322:18:18:70:541:706:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:expensive and labor intensive. AOD might decrease in response to an overall decrease in economic
20:676:48418:18:18:70:541:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:activity when construction ends. Finally, subways might occupy space otherwise used for cars and
20:677:48514:18:18:70:476:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:thereby affect traffic through a channel unrelated to the subway’s intended function.
20:678:48599:18:18:85:541:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To assess the importance and plausibility of these hypotheses, we collect data describing the
20:679:48692:18:18:70:541:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:start date of construction. These data, detailed in Table A.2, indicate that on average construction
20:680:48792:18:18:70:541:616:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:began almost seven years prior to opening, with considerable variation around this mean.  These
20:681:48887:18:18:70:541:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:data allow us to replicate the event study described in equation6around the beginning of construc-
20:682:48985:18:18:70:541:580:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tion.  The bottom right panel of Figure5presents the results and does not support the idea that
20:683:49080:18:17:70:541:562:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the start of subway construction affects city AOD levels. While it is easy to come up with reasons
20:684:49178:17:18:70:541:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:about why some event related to subway construction rather subway openings might affect AOD,
20:685:49270:18:18:70:365:527:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the data do not offer immediate support for such hypotheses.
20:686:49330:18:18:85:541:509:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To  estimate  the  size  of  the  post-subway  drop  in  AOD,  and  to  investigate  its  robustness,  we
20:687:49435:18:28:70:274:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:conduct regressions of the following form,
20:688:49477:28:21:141:541:463:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:A:AODit=α0+α1Dit(1,k)(7)
20:689:49499:21:28:174:472:442:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f3:A:+α2Dit(0) +α3Dit(τ<−k) +α4Dit(τ>k) +controlsit+eit.
20:690:49550:28:17:70:541:414:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:This is a regression of AOD on an indicator for post-opening and controls.  As before, we include
20:691:49647:17:18:70:541:397:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:pre- and post-period indicators in order to isolate AOD variation for city-months close to the time
20:692:49746:18:18:70:541:379:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of their subway opening. We include a dummy variable for city-months whenτit=0. This month
20:693:49836:18:18:70:541:361:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is ‘partly treated’ and this specification ignores AOD variation for these partly-treated city-months.
20:694:49938:18:18:70:541:343:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The intercept,α0, gives the conditional mean AOD over the city-months whereτit∈{−18,...,−1}.
20:695:50030:18:18:70:541:325:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The coefficient of interest isα1, the difference in conditional mean AOD between city-months with
20:696:50127:18:18:71:306:307:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f3:B:τit∈{−18,...,−1}and those withτit∈{1,...,18}.
20:697:50172:18:18:85:541:289:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Table3presents results.  In column1of Table3we conduct the regression given in equation
20:698:50259:18:18:70:540:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(7) with our basic set of controls.10We see that the effect of subways on AOD in the18months
20:699:50351:18:18:70:541:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:following a subway opening,α1, is about -0.02and is different from zero at the5% level. Column
20:700:50445:18:18:70:541:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:B:2adds country level GDP and city population. Column3adds city specific trends. Column4adds
20:701:50535:18:18:70:541:217:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:country level GDP and population and city specific trends. Column5adds city specific trends and
20:702:50630:18:18:70:541:199:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:allows for a trend break in each city at time zero. Column6adds country level GDP and population
20:703:50726:18:18:70:541:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to the specification of column5.  The estimated effect on AOD of subway opening is stable across
20:704:50822:18:18:70:541:163:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:these various specifications. The difference between the smallest and largest coefficients (columns
20:705:50921:18:17:70:541:145:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:B:3and6) is0.002. This is about25% of the standard error of the most precise estimate in column5.
20:706:51016:17:18:70:541:128:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Panel (c) of Figure5shows the magnitude of the AOD coefficient from column2, as well as95%
20:707:51106:18:17:70:164:110:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:confidence bounds.
20:708:51124:17:14:79:540:93:7:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f3:F:10For reference, we observe39cities where subways open, for12month per year, for14years with two satellites.
20:709:51232:14:11:70:541:79:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:Multiplying gives13,104. This slightly exceeds the size of our main regression sample because the Aqua satellite begins
20:710:51351:11:11:70:540:68:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:operation in2002rather than2000for Terra, and because of a few city-months for which a satellite reports zero AOD
20:711:51464:11:0:70:96:57:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:pixels.
21:712:51473:0:18:85:541:724:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:All regressions in Table3include the following controls; linear and quadratic climate controls
21:713:51567:18:18:70:541:706:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(temperature, vapor, cloud cover, precipitation, frost days), AOD pixel count, satellite indicator,
21:714:51666:18:18:70:541:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:calendar month×city indicators, year×continent indicators, pre- and post-period indicators.  Re-
21:715:51762:18:18:70:541:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:moving climate controls or AOD pixel count does not have an important effect on the subway
21:716:51852:18:18:70:541:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:coefficient or the regression R2. We also experimented broadly with sampling rules that reduce the
21:717:51950:18:18:70:541:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:importance of city-months for which AOD data is sparse and find that it does not qualitatively
21:718:52044:18:18:70:541:616:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:affect  our  results.   However,  calendar  month×city  indicators  are  important.   If  we  omit  these
21:719:52149:18:18:70:541:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:indicators,  all  else  equal,  the  R2of  our  regressions  drops  from  about0.83to  about0.49,  while
21:720:52253:18:18:70:541:580:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the coefficient for subway openings about doubles in the first four columns of Table3, but is not
21:721:52350:18:17:70:540:562:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:distinguishable from zero when we include city specific trend with a break at zero in columns5and
21:722:52447:17:18:70:541:545:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:B:6.  That the correlation between subway openings and AOD does not depend on weather seems
21:723:52536:18:18:70:541:527:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:unsurprising.  Since the number of AOD pixels primarily reflects cloud cover, the same intuition
21:724:52632:18:18:70:541:509:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:extends to the pixel count control. The importance of calendar month control is also expected. City
21:725:52731:18:18:70:362:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:level seasonality is an important determinant of AOD levels.
21:726:52791:18:18:85:541:473:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Cameron,  Gelbach,  and  Miller  (2008)  find  that  asymptotic  standard  errors  may  not  approx-
21:727:52891:18:18:70:541:455:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f4:B:imate  exact  finite  sample  standard  errors  in  samples  containing30or  fewer  clusters.   With39
21:728:52993:18:18:70:541:437:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cities/clusters  our  main  sample  is  not  much  larger.   To  confirm  that  the  asymptotic  standard
21:729:53098:18:18:70:541:419:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:errors  reported  in  Table3approximate  exact  values,  we  implement  the  wild-cluster  bootstrap
21:730:53198:18:18:70:540:401:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:procedure recommended in Cameronet al.(2008). We report wild cluster bootstrap p-values using
21:731:53291:18:18:70:541:383:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:B:300bootstrap replications in square brackets in Table3. The statistical significance of the estimates
21:732:53392:18:18:70:541:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is unchanged when we use the wild cluster bootstrap instead of the asymptotic standard errors.
21:733:53486:18:18:70:408:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Given this, we report only asymptotic errors for the rest of our results.
21:734:53559:18:18:85:541:329:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f4:A:Table3strongly suggests that opening a subway network decreases a city’s AOD by about0.02
21:735:53648:18:18:70:541:311:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:over the18month period following the opening.   The mean value of AOD across cities in our
21:736:53738:18:17:70:541:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sample before subways open is0.49, so this0.02subway effect on AOD represents a4% reduction
21:737:53829:17:18:70:126:276:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on average.
21:738:53840:18:18:85:541:258:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Regression results so far focus on average effects over the18months before and after a subway
21:739:53933:18:18:70:541:240:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:opening.  Table A.3refines the results of Table3by decomposing the study window into6month
21:740:54023:18:18:70:541:222:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:bins.  These estimates are broadly consistent with inspection of panel (c) of Figure5and Table3.
21:741:54119:18:18:70:541:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Subways have a negative effect on AOD during each six month period following a subway open-
21:742:54210:18:18:70:541:186:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ing. These effects are largest during the period from7-12months after an opening. Unsurprisingly,
21:743:54307:18:18:70:541:168:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:our estimates are somewhat imprecise, and only the effect during the7-12months post-opening
21:744:54398:18:18:70:541:150:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is distinguishable from zero at conventional confidence levels.  Estimates of the subway effect on
21:745:54496:18:18:70:541:132:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:AOD in the two pre-periods are dramatically smaller than post-periods, but are estimated with
21:746:54589:18:18:70:541:114:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:about the same precision.  In particular, and reassuringly, they are not distinguishable from zero.
21:747:54688:18:18:70:541:96:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In columns5and6of Table3we see that our estimates are robust to the inclusion of city specific
21:748:54782:18:18:70:541:78:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:trends, before and after the opening.  Together with the results of Table A.3this suggests that our
21:749:54881:18:0:70:509:60:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:results are not driven by confounding trends in AOD around the time of subway openings.
22:750:54970:0:18:85:541:724:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Table3presents estimates of the average effect of subways on a city.  It is natural to suspect
22:751:55064:18:18:70:541:706:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that, in fact, subways do not affect all cities in the same way.  To investigate this possibility, we
22:752:55165:18:18:70:541:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:estimate a version of equation7where we allow the effect of subways to vary across cities. Figure
22:753:55262:18:18:70:541:670:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:B:6summarizes these results. The horizontal axis gives the magnitude of the subway effect for each
22:754:55358:18:18:70:541:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:city, and the vertical axis the corresponding standard error.  Shaded regions indicate whether the
22:755:55456:18:18:70:541:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:city effect in question is distinguishable from zero at usual confidence levels. This figure suggests
22:756:55557:18:18:70:366:616:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:considerable heterogeneity in how cities respond to subways.
22:757:55617:18:18:85:541:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We  conduct  a  number  of  exercises  in  order  to  discern  a  pattern  in  this  heterogeneity.   Table
22:758:55724:18:18:70:541:580:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:A.4investigates whether subways have different effects on different types of cities.  In this table,
22:759:55824:18:17:70:541:562:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:we replicate the results of column2of Table3, but add an interaction between the post-subway
22:760:55916:17:18:70:541:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:indicator and a particular city characteristic, along with the characteristic in question. In order, the
22:761:56020:18:18:70:541:527:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:interactions considered are; an indicator for cities in the top half of the city size distribution in2000,
22:762:56126:18:18:70:541:509:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:an indicator for cities in the bottom half of the country income distribution in1990, an indicator for
22:763:56228:18:18:70:541:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:above median average rainfall, an indicator for cities whose subway opening included more than
22:764:56322:18:18:70:541:473:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the median number of stations, indicator for cities in Asia, and finally, an indicator for cities in the
22:765:56426:18:18:70:430:455:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:top half of the AOD distribution in the year prior to their subway opening.
22:766:56501:18:18:85:541:437:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The interaction term has only a small effect on the main treatment effect and the interaction
22:767:56594:18:18:70:541:419:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:term is small and indistinguishable from zero when we consider heterogeneity of effects by city
22:768:56689:18:18:70:541:401:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:size, country income level, mean precipitation, and initial subway size (Columns1-4in the table).
22:769:56786:18:18:70:541:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Heterogenous effects are more evident when we differentiate between Asian cities and the rest
22:770:56879:18:18:70:541:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(column5),  and indicate that Asian cities experience larger pollution reductions with the intro-
22:771:56976:18:18:70:541:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:duction of their subway systems (-0.025vs -0.015), although the interaction term is not statistically
22:772:57077:18:18:70:541:329:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:different from zero.  Column6distinguishes between high and low pollution cities.  As would be
22:773:57171:18:18:70:541:311:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:expected, the estimates suggest that pollution effects are larger (-0.029vs -0.012) among initially
22:774:57270:18:17:70:541:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:more polluted cities. In fact, this specification indicates that pollution reduction effects can only be
22:775:57374:17:31:70:353:276:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:differentiated from zero for initially higher pollution cities.
22:776:57437:31:25:70:187:245:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f6:C:ALonger time horizons
22:777:57458:25:18:70:541:220:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Subways are durable and their effects probably extend over decades.  Hence,  it is of interest to
22:778:57555:18:18:70:541:202:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:extend our estimates of the effects of subways to the longest possible horizon that our data permit.
22:779:57655:18:18:70:541:184:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Unfortunately, considering a longer treatment period requires that we degrade our research design
22:780:57752:18:18:70:541:166:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in one of two ways.   As we consider longer treatment periods we must either allow later post-
22:781:57846:18:18:70:541:148:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:treatment effects to reflect a decreasing set of cities, opening the door to confounding composition
22:782:57946:18:18:70:541:130:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:with subway effects, or else restrict attention to progressively smaller samples of cities, reducing
22:783:58046:18:18:70:541:112:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:precision and raising questions of external validity.  In spite of this, the importance of obtaining
22:784:58146:18:18:70:541:94:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:estimates over a time horizon that more nearly approximates the planning horizon suggests that
22:785:58240:18:0:70:435:76:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:such estimates will be useful, even though we have less confidence in them.
23:786:58317:0:18:85:541:724:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In  Table4we  continue  to  consider  a  pre-treatment  period  beginning18months  before  an
23:787:58410:18:18:70:541:706:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:opening, but consider longer post-treatment periods.  In columns1and2we consider two years
23:788:58500:18:18:70:541:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:after an opening, and allow the subway effect to vary by year using a specification that is otherwise
23:789:58601:18:18:70:541:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the same as we used in Table3. As in Table3, the two columns differ only in that column2includes
23:790:58697:18:18:70:541:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:controls for city population and country level GDP, while column1does not. We see that the one
23:791:58791:18:18:70:541:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:year effect is about−0.02, statistically identical to our estimate of the18month effect in Table3.
23:792:58889:18:18:70:541:616:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Point estimates of the second year effect are slightly smaller and are estimated with about the same
23:793:58989:18:18:70:541:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:precision as the1year effect. We can reject neither the hypothesis that the second year effect is zero
23:794:59091:18:18:70:541:580:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:nor that it is the same as the one year effect. Panel (b) of Table4estimates the average subway effect
23:795:59193:18:17:70:541:562:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:over the two year post-period considered in the first two columns.  Unsurprisingly, this average
23:796:59289:17:18:70:541:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:effect is statistically different from zero, but not from -0.02.  In order to extend our sample to two
23:797:59391:18:18:70:541:527:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:years post-treatment with a constant sample of cities in all months, we lose a city and the first two
23:798:59492:18:18:70:361:509:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:columns of Table4reflect38subway openings instead of39.
23:799:59547:18:18:85:541:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In  columns3and4of  Table4we  extend  the  post-treatment  period  to36months.   Each  of
23:800:59636:18:18:70:541:473:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the  three  post  treatment  years  are  negative  and  estimated  precisely  enough  that  they  can  be
23:801:59741:18:18:70:541:455:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:distinguished from zero.  Point estimates are slightly increasing in magnitude with time from the
23:802:59838:18:18:70:541:437:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:system opening,  although the change is not large relative to the magnitude or precision of the
23:803:59933:18:18:70:541:419:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:estimates. To consider the three year post-treatment period with a constant sample of cities in each
23:804:60033:18:18:70:541:401:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:month, we restrict our sample to35cities.  Thus, the slight change in the year1and2treatments
23:805:60126:18:18:70:540:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f4:B:from columns1and2to columns3and4may reflect the change in sample.  Finally, columns5
23:806:60210:18:18:70:541:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and6consider a four year post-treatment period.  These columns indicate slightly larger effects
23:807:60305:18:18:70:541:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:than in the other columns, and suggest that the effect of subways increases over time, although
23:808:60400:18:18:70:541:329:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the precision of these estimates does not allow us to reject the hypothesis that the effect is constant
23:809:60503:18:18:70:541:311:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in all post-treatment years.  To preserve a constant sample of cities over this longer horizon, we
23:810:60601:18:17:70:541:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:restrict our sample to only28subway openings. Again, the average effect presented in panel (b) is
23:811:60698:17:18:70:218:276:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:not distinguishable from -0.02.
23:812:60729:18:18:85:541:258:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Table5extends  the  analysis  horizon  by  dropping  the  requirement  that  the  sample  of  cities
23:813:60829:18:18:70:541:240:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is constant throughout the window of analysis and allows us to show estimates of the effect of
23:814:60923:18:18:70:541:222:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:subways over the five to eight years after a system opening.  To begin, columns1and2of Table
23:815:61015:18:18:70:541:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:B:5look at the effect of subways for a five year post-treatment period following the specification
23:816:61111:18:18:70:541:186:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of column2of Table3, except for the longer treatment period.  For reference, column1restricts
23:817:61204:18:18:70:541:168:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:attention to set of26cities for which we observe the entire post-treatment period.11In column
23:818:61297:18:18:70:541:150:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:B:1we see that all yearly effects are negative, and, except for the very large effect in the fifth year,
23:819:61399:18:18:70:541:132:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:not far from our baseline estimate of about−0.02.  Switching to the larger sample of39cities in
23:820:61494:18:18:70:540:114:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f4:B:column2, we see that coefficient magnitudes and standard error decrease slightly.  In columns3
23:821:61588:18:19:70:541:96:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to5, we consider progressively longer treatment periods. Panel (b) reports the average effect over

24:848:63084:18:18:70:282:265:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:baseline specification in column1of table3.
24:849:63127:18:18:85:541:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Inspection of these results reveals three patterns. First, across specifications, point estimates are
24:850:63228:18:18:70:541:229:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:within1.64standard errors of -0.02in almost all cases.  Second, only the first, third and fifth year
24:851:63328:18:18:70:541:211:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:effect are significantly different from zero and the fifth year effect seems anomalously large relative
24:852:63431:18:18:70:541:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to  the other  years.   Finally,  there is  no obvious  trend in  coefficient magnitudes  with time  from
24:853:63536:18:18:70:541:175:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:opening, while in all columns except1, standard errors increase monotonically, or very nearly so,
24:854:63633:18:18:70:541:157:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:with time from opening. That is, unsurprisingly, as the subway opening is more remote, its effects
24:855:63731:18:18:70:541:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are progressively more difficult to detect, and beyond5-6years we are unable to distinguish annual
24:856:63829:18:18:70:541:121:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:subway effects from zero. The lower panel in the table reports mean effects across post-treatment
24:857:63926:18:18:70:541:103:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:years and points to surprisingly stable estimates even as the number of years post treatment are

26:914:67148:18:18:85:541:412:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Table6documents precisely this phenomenon. For reference, the first two columns of this table
26:915:67241:18:18:70:541:394:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:reproduce the first two columns of Table3.  Columns3and4are identical to columns1and2,
26:916:67327:18:18:70:540:376:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:except  that  the  dependent  variable  is  mean  monthly  AOD  between10and25km  of  the  center
26:917:67424:18:18:70:540:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f4:B:rather than within10km.  Columns5and6examine AOD between25and50km, and columns7

26:919:67591:18:30:70:302:322:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:from the city center and eventually goes to zero.

26:922:67754:18:18:70:541:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:match each subway city to the nearest city within1000km that has a population within20% of
26:923:67844:18:18:70:541:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the target city.  We are able to find such a match for27of our39subway cities.  We replicate the
26:924:67940:18:18:70:541:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:regressions of Table3using placebo city outcomes in Table A.5.   Simple t-tests fail to reject the
26:925:68038:18:17:70:541:194:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:hypothesis that the subway effect is different from zero in the placebo sample, but do reject the
26:926:68135:17:35:70:436:177:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:hypothesis that the subway effect is the same for placebo and subway cities.

26:928:68313:18:18:70:541:124:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:indicators in our main specification because many of the countries in our sample experience only
26:929:68409:18:18:70:541:106:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:one  subway  opening  during  our  study  period.   Moreover,  our  results  are  somewhat  sensitive
26:930:68510:18:0:70:541:88:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to the inclusion of city-by-calendar month indicators.  Given this, we experiment with different
27:931:68608:0:18:70:541:724:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:configurations of indicator variables to capture country and season effects to check the robustness
27:932:68707:18:18:70:144:706:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of our findings.
27:933:68723:18:18:85:541:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:First,  our  results  are  robust  to  using  hemisphere-month  fixed  effects  instead  of  year-by-

27:935:68917:18:18:70:541:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:A.6,  we extend our sample to include all650cities in the United Nation’s World Urbanization
27:936:69009:18:18:70:541:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Prospects data (DESA Population Division,2014). This much larger sample of cities permits us to
27:937:69104:18:18:70:541:616:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:re-estimate and confirm our main results in specifications that use country-by-month indicators.
27:938:69200:18:18:70:541:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:This result indicates that our results hold even if we allow for completely flexible pollution trends

27:943:69622:18:18:70:540:492:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for a given satellite. The results are presented in Appendix Table A.7and, as can be seen, they are
27:944:69721:18:34:70:266:474:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:very similar to those obtained in Table3.
27:945:69762:34:18:70:541:440:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:B:Expansions vs openings:Up until now, our investigations have focussed on the effects of the initial
27:946:69861:18:18:70:541:422:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:opening of a subway.   We now turn to an investigation of subsequent expansions.   To consider
27:947:69955:18:18:70:541:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the effect of a city’s first subway expansion (typically the second subway line in the system), as
27:948:70053:18:18:70:541:386:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:opposed to the system opening, we first restrict attention to the set of14cities for which we observe
27:949:70154:18:18:70:541:368:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:AOD  for  both  the  opening  and  the  expansion.   Column1of  Table  A.8reports  the  results  of  a
27:950:70256:18:18:70:541:350:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:regression like the one reported in column2of Table3to estimate the effect on AOD of a city’s first
27:951:70355:18:18:70:541:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:subway expansion over an18month treatment window. The point estimate of this effect is−0.015,
27:952:70448:18:18:70:514:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:smaller than the opening effect from Table3, but we cannot distinguish this effect from zero.
27:953:70541:18:18:85:541:296:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Because we observe the whole history of each subway system, we can also identify the date of
27:954:70633:18:18:70:541:278:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the first expansion for cities that do not open their subways during the period when we observe
27:955:70728:18:18:70:540:260:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f4:B:AOD. This increases the number of available expansions from14to26.  Column3of Table A.8
27:956:70815:18:18:70:541:242:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:reports the estimate of the expansion effect on this larger set of cities. This estimate is smaller and
27:957:70918:18:18:70:541:224:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:more precisely estimated, and while we cannot distinguish it from zero, we also cannot distinguish
27:958:71016:18:18:70:541:206:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:it from−0.02. Columns2and4replicate the estimations of columns1and3, but use any expansion
27:959:71106:18:17:70:541:188:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:as  the  treatment  variable.   These  estimates  are  both  close  to  zero  and  estimated  with  sufficient
27:960:71216:17:18:70:541:171:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:precision to allow us to distinguish them from−0.02, but not from zero. In sum, this table provides
27:961:71315:18:35:70:449:153:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:suggestive evidence that subway expansions are less important than openings.
27:962:71391:35:18:70:541:118:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:B:Ridership:Table A.9examines the effects of subway openings and expansions on subway rider-
27:963:71481:18:18:70:540:100:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ship and confirms the conclusions suggested by Table A.8.  An average subway opening results
27:964:71573:18:0:70:541:82:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in ridership of about62people per1000of population.  The first expansion, on average, increases
28:965:71670:0:18:70:541:724:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ridership by about45people per1000of population, and subsequent expansions have still smaller
28:966:71763:18:18:70:103:706:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:effects.
28:967:71771:18:18:85:541:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In Table A.2we see that a subway system consists of14.4stations when it opens and that an
28:968:71860:18:18:70:541:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:average first expansion adds15.7stations. That is, an average expansion probably adds just about
28:969:71956:18:18:70:541:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:as much capacity as does an average opening. Together with our finding that first expansions seem
28:970:72053:18:18:70:541:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to have a smaller effect than openings, this suggests that subway networks may not be subject to
28:971:72149:18:18:70:541:616:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:increasing returns to scale.   Alternatively,  it may be that subway expansions are built in places
28:972:72248:18:34:70:403:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:where there is less demand for subway travel than are the initial line.
28:973:72319:34:18:70:541:564:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:B:Implications of longer pre-treatment period:The results presented so far are consistent with subway
28:974:72418:18:18:70:540:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:openings causing a decrease in AOD of about0.02, and with this effect being about constant over
28:975:72513:18:18:70:541:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:at least the subsequent5to8years. If we instead consider a pre-period of around48months, then
28:976:72606:18:18:70:541:510:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f4:B:there are two noteworthy changes. First, from Table A.2the set of cities for which we observe a48
28:977:72703:18:18:70:541:492:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:month pre and post-period begins with Gwanngju, South Korea and ends with Shenyang, China,
28:978:72793:18:18:70:541:474:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:so we are left with a dramatically smaller sample of21cities. Second, in this sample there are three
28:979:72893:18:18:70:541:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:extremely low pollution months about24months prior to subway opening.  The three months do
28:980:72983:18:18:70:541:438:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:not appear to indicate a break in either the trend or the level of AOD. However, they are sufficiently
28:981:73085:18:18:70:541:420:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:different from neighboring months that they shift the48month pre-period AOD mean.  With this
28:982:73177:18:18:70:541:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:said, in regressions analogous to those of Table3with the longer pre and post-treatment period
28:983:73271:18:18:70:541:384:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and smaller sample, we estimate a decline in AOD around the time of subway opening which is
28:984:73362:18:17:70:540:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:only slightly smaller than what we report in Table3. Figure A.3illustrates this longer study period
28:985:73461:17:32:70:332:349:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:but is otherwise analogous to the panel (c) of Figure5.

28:987:73557:30:18:70:541:287:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:To reconcile our estimate of the effect of subway openings on AOD with other facts about traffic,
28:988:73654:18:18:70:462:269:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:subways, and pollution, consider the following back of the envelope calculations.
28:989:73735:18:18:85:541:251:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:On the basis of travel survey data described in Akbar and Duranton (2017), residents of Bogota
28:990:73829:18:18:70:541:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:take about2.69trips per day and of these19.3%, or0.52trips per day, are by private car or taxi.
28:991:73924:18:18:70:541:215:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:From  Table  A.2,  twelve  months  after  its  subway  opening  an  average  city  in  our  sample  has  a
28:992:74030:18:18:70:541:197:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:population of about3.7m.  Multiplying per capita trips by this population, if people drive at the
28:993:74127:18:18:70:541:179:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:same rate as does the population of Bogota then an average city in our sample generates about2m
28:994:74222:18:17:70:541:161:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:trips by car or taxi per day.  From Figure1, in the second year of its operation an average subway
28:995:74320:17:18:70:541:144:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in our data provides about60rides per1000of population.  Applying this rate to a city of3.7m,
28:996:74413:18:18:70:541:126:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:an average subway system provides about200,000rides per day. If all subway rides replace car or
28:997:74508:18:0:70:372:108:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:taxi rides, this is about10% of all rides in our hypothetical city.
29:998:74577:0:18:85:541:724:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We can perform a similar calculation on the basis of US national averages using the2009Na-
29:999:74667:18:18:70:540:706:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tional Household Transportation Survey.12The2009NHTS records that an average US household
29:1000:74756:18:18:70:541:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:took3.8trips per day, about90% by car (Duranton and Turner,2017). If everyone in a city of3.7m
29:1001:74850:18:18:70:541:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:takes as many trips as an average American, then the city generates about13m trips by car per
29:1002:74943:18:18:70:541:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:day.  If the subway system provides the same about200,000rides per day and if all subway rides
29:1003:75037:18:18:70:498:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:replace car or taxi rides, then the subway opening should reduce car trips by about1.5%.
29:1004:75125:18:18:85:541:616:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:For  the  sake  of  illustration,  suppose  a1%  reduction  in  traffic  results  in  a1%  reduction  in
29:1005:75229:18:18:70:541:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:B:pm10 and that there is no demand response for car travel as drivers shift trips to the subway.  In
29:1006:75327:18:18:70:541:580:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:this case, the calculations above mean that a subway reducespm10 by10% in a city like Bogota and
29:1007:75423:18:17:70:541:562:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by1.5% the US. These magnitudes bracket our sample average4% AOD reduction.  Thus, if a1%
29:1008:75512:17:18:70:541:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:reduction in traffic results in a1% reduction inpm10 and that there is no demand response for car
29:1009:75609:18:18:70:379:527:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:travel, then our estimated4% AOD reduction seems reasonable.
29:1010:75669:18:18:85:541:509:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:With  this  said,  the  evidence  for  a  direct  relationship  between  driving  and  metropolitan
29:1011:75768:18:18:70:541:491:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:B:pm10 levels is inconclusive.  Friedman, Powell, Hutwagner, Graham, and Teague (2001) examine
29:1012:75860:18:18:70:541:473:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:changes in traffic and changes inpm10 in Atlanta around the1996summer olympics.  During this
29:1013:75952:18:18:70:541:455:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:time,  the  city  imposed  restrictions  on  driving  and  saw  traffic  fall  by  about2.8%  over  a17day
29:1014:76058:18:18:70:541:437:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:period.  During the same period,pm10 fell by16.1%.  That is, each1% reduction in driving was
29:1015:76150:18:18:70:541:419:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:associated with about a5% reduction inpm10 . In a related exercise, Gibson and Carnovale (2015)
29:1016:76245:18:18:70:540:401:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:examine the effect of a change in Milan’s congestion pricing program on both traffic andpm10 .
29:1017:76339:18:18:70:541:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Their estimates allow us to calculate that a4% reduction in traffic caused about a1% reduction
29:1018:76433:18:18:70:541:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:inpm10 .13Finally, the US EPA attributes about16% of USpm10 to on road vehicles.14Of these
29:1019:76523:18:18:70:541:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:studies, only Friedmanet al.(2001) finds that a one percent decrease in traffic is associated with at
29:1020:76624:18:18:70:247:329:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:least a one percent decrease inpm10 .
29:1021:76661:18:18:85:541:311:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:This has important implications for our calculations.   Suppose that,  in line with Gibson and
29:1022:76755:18:17:70:541:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Carnovale (2015), we require a4% reduction in traffic for each1% decrease inpm10 . In this case, in
29:1023:76854:17:18:70:541:276:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:order to achieve a4% reduction inpm10 , a subway opening would need to reduce traffic by16%,
29:1024:76946:18:18:70:541:258:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:not by4%.  This seems implausible.  Alternatively, if subway openings reduce driving by4% then
29:1025:77040:18:18:70:289:240:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:we would expect them to reducepm10 by1%.
29:1026:77080:18:18:85:541:222:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In addition,  the evidence that drivers respond to increased road capacity seems compelling.
29:1027:77172:18:18:70:541:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Duranton and Turner (2011) find that metropolitan area traffic increases in direct proportion to
29:1028:77268:18:18:70:541:186:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:road capacity, a finding that Hsu and Zhang (2014) confirm for Japan.  While these papers study
29:1029:77363:18:18:70:541:168:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:road  expansions  explicitly,  the  logic  of  their  finding  suggests  that  a  reduction  in  traffic  due  to
29:1030:77476:18:18:70:541:150:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:increased subway ridership ought to be met with almost exactly offsetting increases in the demand
29:1031:77573:18:19:70:541:132:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for automobile and truck travel.  That is, that subways ought not to reduce traffic in urban areas.
29:1032:77672:19:13:79:249:113:7:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f3:F:12nhts.ornl.gov/2009/pub/stt.pdf, Table3.
29:1033:77713:13:14:79:541:100:7:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f3:F:13From Gibson and Carnovale (2015) Table6,  treatment increased logpm10 by0.0404and,  from Table2,  traffic by
29:1034:77823:14:11:70:541:86:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f3:F:26,725cars.   From Table2,  mean traffic andpm10 are169,744and47.66.   Using these values to calculate percentage
29:1035:77936:11:10:70:342:75:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:changes we arrive at a16% change in traffic and4% change inpm10 .
29:1036:78001:10:0:79:533:65:7:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f3:F:14U.S. EPA, Report on the Environment,https://cfpub.epa.gov/roe/indicator.cfm?i=19, accessed, April2017.
30:1037:78107:0:18:70:541:724:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Duranton and Turner (2011) corroborate this argument by looking at the relationship between the
30:1038:78202:18:18:70:541:706:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:level of driving in a US metropolitan area and the stock of buses and subway cars in the MSA.
30:1039:78295:18:18:70:538:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Although the resulting estimates are imprecise, they do not contradict the hypothesis of no effect.
30:1040:78394:18:18:85:541:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:However, Duranton and Turner (2011) and Hsu and Zhang (2014) study, respectively, US and
30:1041:78482:18:18:70:541:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Japanese metropolitan areas, both with average populations of about1m. In contrast, we consider
30:1042:78577:18:18:70:541:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a  set  of  cities,  all  with  subways,  with  average  population  of  nearly4m,  of  which  only  one  is
30:1043:78685:18:18:70:541:616:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Japanese and two in the continental US. Thus,  it may be that the demand responses estimated
30:1044:78777:18:18:70:541:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in Duranton and Turner (2011) and Hsu and Zhang (2014) do not extrapolate to our sample of
30:1045:78867:18:18:70:541:580:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:larger and more international subway cities.  Garcia-Lopez, Pasidis and Viladecans-Marsal (2017)
30:1046:78963:18:17:70:541:562:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:provide suggestive evidence that the demand response to additional lanes is smaller for European
30:1047:79059:17:18:70:541:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cities with subways than without.  With this said, the hypothesis of no demand response seems
30:1048:79152:18:18:70:128:527:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:improbable.
30:1049:79163:18:18:85:541:509:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:This, too, has important implications for our calculations.  Suppose that the demand response
30:1050:79256:18:18:70:541:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in our sample is only half what Duranton and Turner (2011) find for the US. In this case, in order
30:1051:79354:18:18:70:541:473:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to reduce driving by one trip, we would require two subway trips. This would halve the effect of
30:1052:79450:18:18:70:347:455:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:subways onpm10 in our back of the envelope calculation.
30:1053:79505:18:18:85:541:437:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To sum up, subway openings reduce metropolitan AOD levels by about4% and probably carry
30:1054:79592:18:18:70:541:419:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:approximately the same fraction of daily trips.   However,  a significant traffic demand response
30:1055:79689:18:18:70:541:401:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:likely follows a subway opening, and on average a1% traffic reduction probably reducespm10 by
30:1056:79782:18:18:70:541:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:less than1%.  It follows that the effect of subways on AOD probably does not operate entirely by
30:1057:79878:18:18:70:540:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:diverting average trips to the subway. To cause the observed decrease inpm10 , subway openings

30:1059:80022:18:18:85:541:329:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We can suggest two reasons why this might occur.  First, marginal drivers who switch to the
30:1060:80113:18:18:70:541:311:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:subway  may  be  poor  relative  to  the  pool  of  all  drivers,  and  if  so,  they  may  drive  particularly
30:1061:80224:18:17:70:541:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:dirty cars (or scooters).   Thus,  the availability of subways may affect pollution by affecting the
30:1062:80324:17:18:70:541:276:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:composition of the stock of cars on the road. There does not seem to be a basis in the literature for
30:1063:80425:18:18:70:541:258:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:estimating the magnitude of this effect. Second, evidence from hourly ridership indicates subways
30:1064:80522:18:18:70:541:240:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:typically provide a disproportionate share of their trips at peak hours.  In this case, subway trips
30:1065:80622:18:18:70:541:222:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:may replace trips that occur at congested times and have high external congestion costs.  If so, it
30:1066:80721:18:18:70:541:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:may be that each car trips shifted to the subway has a disproportionate effect on pollution because
30:1067:80820:18:18:70:541:186:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:they reduce pollution produced by other commuters. Anderson (2014) provides evidence, over the
30:1068:80914:18:32:70:241:168:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:very short run, to support this idea.

32:1126:85896:18:18:85:541:453:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We obtain integrated risk functions from Burnettet al.(2014) for five causes of mortality. These

32:1133:86589:18:18:70:541:327:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ceding the opening of a subway.  Second, applying the integrated risk functions, we calculate the

33:1152:88236:17:18:70:541:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:reasonably expect that a complete accounting for the health and productivity related benefits of

33:1158:88696:18:18:70:541:519:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:construction for an average subway system in our sample ranges from298m to about3.4b dollars.
33:1159:88789:18:18:70:541:501:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Our estimates of the present value of avoided infant mortality in an average subway city range
33:1160:88883:18:18:70:541:483:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:between95.5m and441m, depending on whether the subway effect on pollution lasts for five years
33:1161:88977:18:18:70:541:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:or is permanent.  Our estimates of the present value of avoided all-age mortality in an average

33:1166:89376:31:30:70:147:362:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:8. Conclusion
33:1167:89389:30:18:70:541:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Column2of Table3indicates that AOD fell by about0.021in the10k disk surrounding a city center
33:1168:89482:18:18:70:541:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:during the18months following an average subway opening.  This effect is robust to econometric
33:1169:89575:18:18:70:541:296:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:specification, and is estimated precisely, the95% CI is [-0.040,-0.002].  Mean monthly AOD in the
33:1170:89672:18:18:70:541:278:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:regression sample before the introduction of subways is0.49. Dividing, the mean AOD reduction
33:1171:89765:18:18:70:518:260:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:from a subway opening is about4% with a95% confidence interval ranging from0.5% to8%.
33:1172:89850:18:18:85:541:242:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:From Table1, AOD readings from Terra in2000and2014are0.38and0.45. Our0.02estimated
33:1173:89932:18:18:70:541:224:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:subway  effect  is  only  about4%  of  the  level  of  AOD,  but  it  is  more  than25%  of  the14year
33:1174:90034:18:18:70:541:206:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:change.   Comparing  across  continents  in2014,  we  see  that  the  difference  between  Europe  and
33:1175:90136:18:18:70:541:188:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:North America is about0.07, three and a half subway effects, and between Europe and Asia the
33:1176:90228:18:17:70:541:170:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:difference is0.38, about20subway effects. In all, this suggests that subways may play a moderately
33:1177:90326:17:18:70:285:153:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:important role in determining AOD in a city.
33:1178:90370:18:18:85:541:135:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To  the  extent  that  our  data  allows  us  to  consider  longer  post-opening  periods,  this  effect  of
33:1179:90478:18:18:70:541:117:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:subways on AOD appears to be approximately constant during the5-6years after an opening, and
33:1180:90570:18:18:70:541:99:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:indeterminant beyond this time.  As we consider larger areas around the city center, the effects of
33:1181:90669:18:0:70:289:81:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:subway openings attenuate in intuitive ways.
34:1182:90715:0:18:85:541:724:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The effects of subway expansions seem to be smaller than those of subway openings, an effect
34:1183:90807:18:18:70:541:706:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that we observe both in changes in AOD and ridership. To the extent that public policy encourages
34:1184:90904:18:18:70:541:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:subway construction, this suggests that openings are relatively more important than expansions.
34:1185:90999:18:18:70:541:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We note that the decreasing marginal effect of subway expansion seems to be broadly consistent
34:1186:91093:18:18:70:541:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:with the slight decreasing returns in the effects of metropolitan road networks observed in Cou-
34:1187:91189:18:18:70:236:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ture, Duranton, and Turner (2016).
34:1188:91223:18:18:85:541:616:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Extant  estimates  of  the  effects  of  particulates  on  mortality  suggest  that  they  are  sufficiently
34:1189:91331:18:18:70:541:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:poisonous that the small nominal reductions from subway openings are economically important.
34:1190:91423:18:18:70:541:580:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In particular, they appear to be large enough to justify moderate subsidies for subway construction
34:1191:91522:18:17:70:541:562:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in environments where more direct policy instruments for managing automobile pollution are not
34:1192:91616:17:18:70:116:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:available.
34:1193:91626:18:18:85:541:527:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:On  the  other  hand,  the  channel  through  which  subways  affect  pollution  remains  somewhat
34:1194:91724:18:18:70:541:509:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:uncertain.   Our  calculation  suggests  that  observed  levels  of  ridership  account  for  a  significant
34:1195:91832:18:18:70:541:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:fraction of metropolitan travel. In order for this level of ridership to cause the observed4% decline
34:1196:91933:18:18:70:541:473:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in AOD, it seems likely that trips diverted to the subway are particularly polluting, either because
34:1197:92033:18:0:70:510:455:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:they use particularly polluting vehicles or because they occur at especially congested times.

40:1395:106018:45:17:70:541:239:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Second, we create a raster catalog with all the granules for a given day and calculate the average

40:1397:106174:18:18:85:541:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Figure A.1provides more information about the coverage of the two satellites and the preva-
40:1398:106265:18:18:70:541:186:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:lence of missing data.  The black dashed line in panel (a) of figure gives the count of cities in our
40:1399:106366:18:18:70:541:168:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:data for which we calculate an AOD from the Terra satellite reading for each month of our study
40:1400:106461:18:18:70:541:150:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:period.  These are cities for which there is at least one pixel within10km of the center on one day
40:1401:106560:18:18:70:541:132:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:during the relevant month. Since most of the cities in our data are in the Northern hemisphere, we
40:1402:106658:18:18:70:541:114:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:see a strong seasonal pattern this series. The light gray line in this figure reports the corresponding
40:1403:106761:18:18:70:541:96:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:quantity calculated from the Aqua satellite reading. Since Aqua became operational after Terra, the
40:1404:106860:18:18:70:541:78:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Aqua series begins later. The Aqua satellite data tracks the Terra data closely, but at a slightly lower
40:1405:106964:18:0:70:541:60:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:level.  Panel (b) of figure A.1reports city mean AOD data for all city-months in our sample over
41:1406:107062:0:18:70:541:724:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the course of our study period.  As for the other series, this one too exhibits seasonality, although
41:1407:107163:18:18:70:541:706:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:this will partly reflect a composition effect.  As we see in panel (a) not all cities are in the data for
41:1408:107268:18:18:70:541:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:all months.  As in the first two panels, the dark line describes AOD readings from Terra and the
41:1409:107364:18:18:70:151:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:light gray, Aqua.
41:1410:107381:18:18:85:541:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, figure A.2shows the relationship between the ground based measurements and MODIS
41:1411:107470:18:18:70:541:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:AOD. Panel (a) of this figure plots ground basedpm10 against Terra AOD in a10km disk. That is,
41:1412:107564:18:18:70:541:616:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the raw data on which column1of table2is based.  We see a strong positive relationship.  Panel
41:1413:107658:18:18:70:541:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(b) shows a plot of the residuals of the regression in column3of table2against the residuals of
41:1414:107753:18:18:70:541:580:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a regression of10km Terrapm10 on the control variables used in the same regression.  Again, we
41:1415:107847:18:17:70:541:562:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:see a strong positive slope.  Note that the scales on the two graphs are not the same.  The bottom
41:1416:107945:17:18:70:541:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:two panels are the same as the top, but are based on ground basedpm2.5 measures. Again we see
41:1417:108038:18:31:70:237:527:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a clear positive slope in both plots.
