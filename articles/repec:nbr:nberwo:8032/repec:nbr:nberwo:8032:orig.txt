3:45:2726:0:26:107:488:709:117:Times:117:Times:This paper provides a new analysis of a question of increasing importance and significant
3:46:2815:26:26:72:538:683:117:Times:117:Times:controversy:  the impact of 401(k) plans on households’ wealth.  Deferred compensation, or 401(k), plans are
3:47:2923:26:26:72:527:657:117:Times:117:Times:employment-based saving incentives featuring tax-deductible contributions by the employer and employee,
3:48:3026:26:26:72:527:631:117:Times:117:Times:tax-free accrual of earnings, and annual contribution limits.  Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income and
3:49:3133:26:25:72:531:605:117:Times:117:Times:may also be subject to penalties, depending on the age of the account holder.  Originally authorized in 1978,
3:50:3242:25:26:72:529:580:117:Times:117:Times:401(k) plans began to grow rapidly after regulations were issued in the early 1980s.  In 1984, active 401(k)
3:51:3350:26:26:72:494:554:117:Times:117:Times:participants numbered 7.5 million and aggregate contributions totaled $16 billion.  By 1996, active
3:52:3449:26:26:71:515:528:117:Times:117:Times:participants numbered almost 31 million, contributions were $104 billion and balances exceeded $1,061
3:53:3550:26:26:71:509:502:117:Times:117:Times:billion (Department of Labor 2000).  In short, 401(k) plans have become a major tax -preferred saving
3:54:3651:26:26:71:222:476:117:Times:117:Times:vehicle over the last 15 to 20 years.
3:55:3688:26:26:107:499:450:117:Times:117:Times:Over the same period, a growing literature on how 401(k) plans affect household saving has
3:56:3778:26:26:71:499:424:117:Times:117:Times:emerged.  The central issue addressed is simple: what proportion of 401(k) contributions or balances
3:57:3878:26:26:71:516:398:117:Times:117:Times:represent net additions to national (private plus public) saving?  Contributions raise private saving when
3:58:3984:26:26:71:522:372:117:Times:117:Times:households finance the contributions with reductions in consumption or increases in labor supply.  Private
3:59:4090:26:26:71:498:346:117:Times:117:Times:saving also rises even if the contributions are financed by the associated tax cut; this emphasizes the
3:60:4193:26:26:71:534:320:117:Times:117:Times:importance of considering the impact on both public and private saving.  However, 401(k) plans do not raise
3:61:4300:26:25:71:517:294:117:Times:117:Times:private saving when households finance contributions with reductions in existing assets, with saving that
3:62:4405:25:26:71:518:269:117:Times:117:Times:would have been undertaken even in the absence of the plan, or with increases in debt.  Moreover, the tax
3:63:4510:26:26:71:328:243:117:Times:117:Times:breaks associated with 401(k)s tend to reduce public saving.
3:64:4570:26:26:107:517:217:117:Times:117:Times:Although the central issue is straightforward, developing reliable and robust answers has proven
3:65:4666:26:26:71:504:191:117:Times:117:Times:difficult for several reasons.  First, saving behavior differs significantly across households.   Evidence
3:66:4772:26:26:71:539:165:117:Times:117:Times:indicates that households that participate in, or are eligible for, 401(k)s have systematically stronger tastes for
3:67:4887:26:26:71:525:139:117:Times:117:Times:saving than other households.  Second, the average taste for saving among eligible or ineligible households
3:68:4994:26:0:71:527:113:117:Times:117:Times:may have shifted systematically over time.  Finally, since the early 1980s, financial markets and underlying
4:69:5103:0:26:72:536:709:117:Times:117:Times:economic factors have changed dramatically.   The attempt to control for these three complicating factors has
4:70:5212:26:26:72:531:683:117:Times:117:Times:been a major theme of previous work.  Despite these efforts, previous research has reached a wide variety of
4:71:5320:26:26:72:499:657:117:Times:117:Times:conclusions regarding 401(k)s and saving.  Poterba, Venti, and Wise (1996a, page 92) conclude that
4:72:5418:26:26:72:528:631:117:Times:117:Times:“...401(k) contributions represent new saving, rather than simply being a substitute for other financial asset
4:73:5528:26:25:72:519:605:117:Times:117:Times:saving.”  However, Engen, Gale and Scholz (1996, page 115) conclude that “...little, if any, of the overall
4:74:5635:25:26:71:342:580:117:Times:117:Times:contributions to existing saving incentives have raised saving.” 
4:75:5700:26:26:107:533:554:117:Times:117:Times:This paper points the way toward a reconciliation of these findings.  Our key modeling innovation is
4:76:5800:26:26:71:539:528:117:Times:117:Times:to allow the impact of 401(k)s to vary simultaneously over both time and earnings groups.  Previous work has
4:77:5908:26:26:71:537:502:117:Times:117:Times:considered each item separately.  Our specification generalizes models used in earlier research.  We show that
4:78:6018:26:26:71:536:476:117:Times:117:Times:the modeling constraints imposed in previous studies are soundly rejected by the data.  Using data from 1987
4:79:6126:26:26:71:521:450:117:Times:117:Times:and 1991, we find that the effects of  401(k)s on wealth vary significantly by earnings level.  Our analysis
4:80:6234:26:26:71:535:424:117:Times:117:Times:implies that 401(k)s held by groups with low earnings, who hold a small portion of overall 401(k) assets, are
4:81:6343:26:26:71:530:398:117:Times:117:Times:more likely to represent net wealth than 401(k)s held by high-earnings  groups, who hold the bulk of 401(k)
4:82:6450:26:26:71:517:372:117:Times:117:Times:balances.  We also find that 401(k)s held by homeowners or IRA holders, both of whom save substantial
4:83:6551:26:26:71:514:346:117:Times:117:Times:amounts in other forms and who hold the bulk of 401(k) assets, are less likely to be new saving than are
4:84:6655:26:26:71:528:320:117:Times:117:Times:401(k) balances held by renters or non-IRA holders.  Thus, between 0 and 30 percent of 401(k) balances in
4:85:6760:26:25:71:328:294:117:Times:117:Times:the sample period represent net additions to private saving.  
4:86:6822:25:26:107:505:269:117:Times:117:Times:In section I, we describe the data set used in this and previous work, and highlight several key
4:87:6918:26:26:71:525:243:117:Times:117:Times:empirical patterns.  Section II describes and critiques previous research.  Section III develops our modeling
4:88:7027:26:26:71:516:217:117:Times:117:Times:strategy.  Section IV presents the main results.  Sections V and VI examine a variety of extensions of the
4:89:7133:26:52:71:495:191:117:Times:117:Times:basic results.  Section VII provides concluding remarks and places the results in a broader context.  
4:90:7235:52:26:71:106:139:117:Times:117:Times:I.  Data
4:91:7243:26:0:108:523:113:117:Times:117:Times:Following previous research on 401(k)s, we use data from 1984, 1987, and 1991, available in the
5:92:7338:0:13:72:88:380:117:Times:42:Times:      Households are interviewed several times over a period of about two and a half years.  Every "wave"1
5:93:7444:13:13:72:537:367:117:Times:117:Times:collects core data on income, demographics, and other items.  We use this information and data from periodic
5:94:7552:13:13:72:528:354:117:Times:117:Times:topical modules with information on 401(k) plans, assets and debt.  The 1984 SIPP wave 4 was undertaken
5:95:7655:13:12:72:539:341:117:Times:117:Times:between September and December 1984.  We refer to this as 1984 data.  The 1985 SIPP wave 7 and the 1986
5:96:7758:12:13:72:534:329:117:Times:117:Times:SIPP wave 4 surveys occurred between January and April 1987. Variables in these two samples have similar
5:97:7862:13:13:72:501:316:117:Times:117:Times:distributions, so we pool these data sets to form our 1987 data.  Interviews for the 1990 SIPP wave 4
5:98:7963:13:25:72:382:303:117:Times:117:Times:occurred between February and May 1991; we refer to this as 1991 data.
5:99:8033:25:13:72:88:278:117:Times:42:Times:      The reference person is the person in whose name the family's home is owned or rented.  If jointly owned2
5:100:8144:13:25:72:326:265:117:Times:117:Times:or rented, either spouse may appear as the reference person.
5:101:8204:25:13:72:88:240:117:Times:42:Times:      The SIPP records holdings of particular assets for each person in the household, and also provides3
5:102:8309:13:13:72:517:227:117:Times:117:Times:summary data at the household level for holdings of classes of assets.  We exclude households for whom
5:103:8411:13:25:72:240:214:117:Times:117:Times:these two sources of data do not match.
5:104:8450:25:13:72:88:189:117:Times:42:Times:      In 1991, the raw sample contained 20,329 families.  The sample totaled 11,948 after excluding families4

5:106:8667:13:13:72:527:163:117:Times:117:Times:than 64 or younger than 25, and 10,266 after excluding those with inconsistent asset data.  Similar patterns
5:107:8775:13:25:72:418:150:117:Times:117:Times:occur for the other sample years.  See Engen and Gale (1995, Appendix table 1). 
5:108:8855:25:13:72:88:125:117:Times:42:Times:      The top code for mortgages is $100,000 in 1984 and 1987, and $150,000 in 1991.  For house value, the5
5:109:8962:13:13:72:529:112:117:Times:117:Times:top code is $200,000 in 1984 and 1987, and $300,000 in 1991.  Top coding affects only 3.3 percent or less
5:110:9067:13:0:72:188:99:117:Times:117:Times:of the sample in each year. 
5:111:9096:0:26:72:507:709:117:Times:42:Times:Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), which is conducted by the Bureau of the Census.   Our1
5:112:9201:26:26:72:534:683:117:Times:117:Times:sample includes only families where the reference person is 25-64 years old, at least one person is employed,
5:113:9310:26:26:72:224:657:117:Times:42:Times:and no individual is self-employed.   We use this group for several reasons.  401(k) plans are employment-2
5:114:9417:26:26:72:519:631:117:Times:117:Times:based and are typically unavailable to the self-employed.  For people aged 65 and older, retirement issues
5:115:9523:26:25:72:537:605:117:Times:117:Times:may complicate the analysis.  SIPP questions about 401(k) plans are asked only of people aged 25 and older. 
5:116:9631:25:26:71:320:580:117:Times:42:Times:Also, we exclude households with inconsistent asset data.   These criteria leave samples of 9,310 households3
5:117:9740:26:26:72:267:554:117:Times:42:Times:in 1984, 10,669 in 1987 and 10,266 in 1991.4
5:118:9784:26:26:108:512:528:117:Times:117:Times:The SIPP is the only nationally representative survey with data on 401(k) eligibility and wealth
5:119:9880:26:26:71:525:502:117:Times:117:Times:during the 1980s, when 401(k)s grew rapidly.  But the SIPP has several shortcomings worth noting.  First,
5:120:9985:26:26:71:534:476:117:Times:117:Times:there is no information on 401(k) balances for 1984.  Second, mortgage debt and house value are top coded. 
5:121:10092:26:26:71:513:450:117:Times:117:Times:Based on sensitivity analyses we have conducted, we believe that top coding does not have an important
5:122:10194:26:286:71:177:424:117:Times:42:Times:influence on our results.   Third, Curtin, Juster, and Morgan (1989) compare the SIPP wealth data to the5
6:123:10299:286:13:72:88:138:117:Times:42:Times:      Strictly speaking, plans authorized by section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code are only available to6
6:124:10410:13:13:72:524:125:117:Times:117:Times:employees of for-profit firms that offer such plans.  Employees of non-profit institutions and federal, state
6:125:10519:13:13:72:528:112:117:Times:117:Times:and local governments are eligible for similar saving plans authorized under different section codes.  In this
6:126:10629:13:0:72:272:99:117:Times:117:Times:paper, we refer to all of these plans as 401(k)s.
6:127:10679:0:26:72:519:709:117:Times:117:Times:Survey of Consumer Finances and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.  They conclude (p. 474) that the
6:128:10779:26:26:72:529:683:117:Times:117:Times:"striking feature of these comparisons is the substantial similarity in the amounts and distribution of wealth
6:129:10889:26:26:72:533:657:117:Times:117:Times:holdings across the three surveys--provided one ignores households with extremely high wealth (in excess of
6:130:10996:26:26:72:518:631:117:Times:117:Times:$0.5 million)."   High-income, high-wealth households are under represented in the SIPP.   For analyzing
6:131:11100:26:25:72:518:605:117:Times:117:Times:401(k)s, however, this limitation is not critical, because 401(k) eligibility is distributed widely across the
6:132:11210:25:26:71:511:580:117:Times:117:Times:population and contributions are capped.  But the under-representation of high-income households may
6:133:11310:26:26:71:537:554:117:Times:117:Times:nevertheless prove important, if the effects of 401(k)s vary by earnings class.  We return to this theme below.
6:134:11421:26:26:108:537:528:117:Times:117:Times:We consider a family to be eligible for a 401(k) if either the reference person or the spouse works for
6:135:11524:26:26:72:321:502:117:Times:42:Times:an organization that offers a 401(k) plan to its employees.   Because our data lack information on 401(k)6
6:136:11630:26:26:72:538:476:117:Times:117:Times:contributions, a family is defined as a 401(k) participant if the reference person or spouse is eligible and has a
6:137:11744:26:26:71:525:450:117:Times:117:Times:positive 401(k) balance.  We define financial assets to include checking accounts, U.S. saving bonds, other
6:138:11851:26:26:71:539:424:117:Times:117:Times:interest-earning accounts in banks and other financial institutions, other interest-earning assets (such as bonds
6:139:11964:26:26:71:522:398:117:Times:117:Times:held personally), stocks and mutual funds, and IRA, Keogh, and 401(k) balances.  Net financial assets are
6:140:12069:26:26:71:526:372:117:Times:117:Times:defined as financial assets less unsecured debt.  Housing equity is the defined as the difference between the
6:141:12178:26:26:71:510:346:117:Times:117:Times:value of the primary residence and outstanding mortgage debt against the principal residence, including
6:142:12281:26:26:71:527:320:117:Times:117:Times:second and third mortgages and home equity loans.  We define wealth as the sum of housing equity and net
6:143:12385:26:26:71:524:294:117:Times:117:Times:financial assets.  This broad wealth measure omits business wealth, but since the sample excludes the self-
6:144:12492:26:25:71:528:268:117:Times:117:Times:employed, this is a natural restriction to impose.  The wealth measure also excludes defined benefit pension
6:145:12600:25:26:71:515:243:117:Times:117:Times:rights and balances in non-401(k) defined contribution plans.   We discuss the likely bias created by this
6:146:12706:26:26:71:504:217:117:Times:117:Times:omission in subsequent sections.  Family earnings are given by the sum of the reference person and, if
6:147:12808:26:0:71:155:191:117:Times:117:Times:present, the spouse.
7:148:12829:0:26:107:531:709:117:Times:117:Times:With these definitions in mind, we highlight five patterns in the data to help motivate and frame the
7:149:12930:26:26:72:520:683:117:Times:117:Times:analysis below.  First, at each point in time, eligibility for 401(k)s rises substantially with family earnings
7:150:13041:26:26:72:539:657:117:Times:117:Times:(table 1).   Conditional on eligibility, participation rates also rise with earnings, but by smaller amounts.  As a
7:151:13156:26:26:72:512:631:117:Times:117:Times:result, the share of all families that participates in a 401(k) rises dramatically with family earnings.  For
7:152:13265:26:25:72:508:605:117:Times:117:Times:example, in 1991, 14 percent of families with earnings between $10,000 and $20,000 participated in a
7:153:13365:25:26:72:522:580:117:Times:117:Times:401(k), compared to 51 percent of families with earnings above $75,000.   The wide divergence in 401(k)
7:154:13468:26:26:72:524:554:117:Times:117:Times:participation patterns suggests the impact of 401(k) eligibility on wealth may vary across earnings classes.
7:155:13576:26:26:107:537:528:117:Times:117:Times:Second, eligibility and participation rates rose significantly between 1984 and 1991 (table 1).  About
7:156:13678:26:26:71:512:502:117:Times:117:Times:15 percent of families in the sample were eligible in 1984, rising to 38 percent by 1991.  Over the same
7:157:13782:26:26:71:530:476:117:Times:117:Times:period, the proportion of all families participating rose from 8.5 percent to 27 percent.  The rapid expansion
7:158:13892:26:26:71:530:450:117:Times:117:Times:in 401(k) coverage and participation raises questions regarding the comparability of samples of eligible and
7:159:14000:26:26:71:299:424:117:Times:117:Times:ineligible households at a point in time and over time.
7:160:14055:26:26:107:519:398:117:Times:117:Times:Third, 401(k) balances are concentrated among the highest earners and families that save in non-
7:161:14151:26:26:71:536:372:117:Times:117:Times:401(k) forms (table 2).  In 1991, about 70 percent of 401(k) balances and saving incentive balances (the sum
7:162:14259:26:26:71:537:346:117:Times:117:Times:of 401(k)s, IRAs, and Keoghs) were held by households with earnings above $40,000.  Households that have
7:163:14363:26:26:71:533:320:117:Times:117:Times:IRAs or Keoghs held over half of 401(k) balances and 75 percent of saving incentive balances. Homeowners
7:164:14467:26:25:71:534:294:117:Times:117:Times:held 88 percent of 401(k) balances and the same percentage of saving incentive balances.  This suggests that
7:165:14575:25:26:71:512:269:117:Times:117:Times:the effect of 401(k)s among high-income and high-saver households will be a crucial determinant of the
7:166:14677:26:26:71:233:243:117:Times:117:Times:aggregate effect of 401(k)s on wealth.
7:167:14715:26:26:107:526:217:117:Times:117:Times:Fourth, eligible households as a group have very different economic characteristics than ineligible
7:168:14814:26:26:71:518:191:117:Times:117:Times:households as a group at a point in time.  In 1984, for example, median earnings among eligible families
7:169:14918:26:26:72:534:165:117:Times:117:Times:were almost $41,000 (in 1991 dollars), compared to only $28,000 among ineligible families.  Table 3 shows
7:170:15023:26:26:72:527:139:117:Times:117:Times:that about 52 percent of eligible families had earnings above $40,000, compared to 27 percent of ineligible
7:171:15130:26:0:72:528:113:117:Times:117:Times:families.  Median net financial assets were $3,500 for eligibles and $350 for ineligibles, and median wealth
8:172:15239:0:26:72:527:709:117:Times:117:Times:was over $47,000 for eligibles and below $21,000 for ineligibles.  These differences suggest that ineligible
8:173:15347:26:26:72:536:683:117:Times:117:Times:households as a group may not be a good control group for eligible households.  An economic shock that had
8:174:15453:26:26:72:535:657:117:Times:117:Times:differential effects across earnings groups would also have differential effects on eligibles as a group relative
8:175:15566:26:26:72:375:631:117:Times:117:Times:to ineligibles.  Thus, it could be mis-interpreted as an effect of 401(k)s.
8:176:15641:26:25:108:534:605:117:Times:117:Times:There are other systematic differences between eligibles and ineligibles as a group in 1984 (table 3).
8:177:15743:25:26:72:514:580:117:Times:117:Times:Among eligibles, 77 percent owned their homes, 75 percent were married, and 33 percent had an IRA or
8:178:15843:26:26:72:528:554:117:Times:117:Times:Keogh plan.  Among ineligible households, the corresponding figures were markedly lower:  63 percent, 64
8:179:15947:26:26:72:533:528:117:Times:117:Times:percent, and 22 percent.  Similar differences occur in 1987 and 1991.  These differences reinforce the notion
8:180:16056:26:26:72:519:502:117:Times:117:Times:that the groups of eligible and ineligible households have different characteristics and that ineligibles as a
8:181:16166:26:26:71:277:476:117:Times:117:Times:group are a poor control for eligibles as a group.
8:182:16216:26:26:107:500:450:117:Times:117:Times:Fifth, after controlling for earnings, however, eligible households are much more similar to
8:183:16308:26:26:71:512:424:117:Times:117:Times:ineligible households  at a given point in time and over time (table 3).   Average earnings, of course, are
8:184:16415:26:26:71:517:398:117:Times:117:Times:essentially the same within earnings categories for eligibles relative to ineligibles in a given year.  Within
8:185:16525:26:26:71:531:372:117:Times:117:Times:earnings groups, the average difference between eligibles and ineligibles in 1984 in the likelihood of owning
8:186:16634:26:26:71:529:346:117:Times:117:Times:an IRA or Keogh or a home is only one-fourth to one-half as large as the difference between the groups as a
8:187:16741:26:26:71:530:320:117:Times:117:Times:whole.  The average difference in marital status is essentially zero.  Similar patterns also hold for later years
8:188:16854:26:25:71:130:294:117:Times:117:Times:in the sample.
8:189:16868:25:26:107:503:269:117:Times:117:Times:These findings suggest that although the characteristics of the overall sample of eligibles and
8:190:16963:26:26:71:525:243:117:Times:117:Times:ineligibles are different at a point in time and have changed over time, the characteristics of the two groups
8:191:17073:26:26:71:509:217:117:Times:117:Times:within earnings classes are much more similar--though clearly not identical--and have changed in much
8:192:17174:26:26:71:532:191:117:Times:117:Times:smaller and less systematic ways over time.  This suggests that ineligible households in a particular earnings
8:193:17284:26:26:71:435:165:117:Times:117:Times:class may be a good control group for eligible households in the same earnings class. 
8:194:17370:26:26:71:173:139:117:Times:117:Times:II.  Previous Research
8:195:17392:26:0:108:526:113:117:Times:117:Times:Because our econometric specification is an effort specifically to resolve problems found in earlier

9:197:17539:0:26:72:519:709:117:Times:117:Times:work, we highlight key aspects of earlier work here and summarize the findings in table 4.  The effects of
9:198:17645:26:26:72:521:683:117:Times:117:Times:401(k)s on saving are surveyed more broadly in Bernheim (1997, 1999), Engen, Gale and Scholz (1996a,
9:199:17745:26:26:72:433:657:117:Times:117:Times:1996b), Hubbard and Skinner (1996), and Poterba, Venti and Wise (1996a, 1996b). 
9:200:17825:26:26:72:215:631:117:Times:117:Times:A.  Analysis of cross-section data
9:201:17859:26:25:108:511:605:117:Times:117:Times:A key issue in the analysis of 401(k) plans is how best to control for heterogeneity in tastes for
9:202:17957:25:26:72:534:580:117:Times:117:Times:saving across different groups and over time that may be correlated with 401(k) eligibility and participation. 
9:203:18068:26:26:71:534:554:117:Times:117:Times:One approach to this problem has been to use cross-sectional variation in eligibility for 401(k)s.  In this test,
9:204:18181:26:26:71:525:528:117:Times:117:Times:the effects of 401(k)s are identified by the assumption that 401(k) eligibility is uncorrelated with tastes for
9:205:18292:26:26:71:529:502:117:Times:117:Times:saving, after controlling for certain factors.  If eligibility is exogenous with respect to tastes for saving, then
9:206:18407:26:26:71:478:476:117:Times:117:Times:higher financial assets for eligibles relative to ineligibles would imply that 401(k)s raise saving.
9:207:18507:26:26:107:536:450:117:Times:117:Times:Poterba, Venti and Wise (1995) test for the exogeneity of eligibility with respect to tastes for saving,
9:208:18611:26:26:71:533:424:117:Times:117:Times:after controlling for earnings.  They use the 1984 SIPP cross-section of eligibles and ineligibles and estimate
9:209:18722:26:52:71:209:398:117:Times:117:Times:a median regression of the form:
9:210:18754:52:52:71:84:346:117:Times:117:Times:(1)
9:211:18757:52:25:71:527:294:117:Times:117:Times:In this specification, W is financial assets excluding 401(k)s and IRAs, X includes dummies for age group,
9:212:18863:25:26:71:265:269:117:Times:42:Times:educational attainment, and marital status, Y  indexes the same earnings groups as in tables 1-3, ELIG is ank
9:213:18972:26:26:72:319:243:117:Times:117:Times:indicator for 401(k) eligibility, and j indexes households.  
9:214:19033:26:26:107:247:217:117:Times:42:Times:They find that the coefficients * in (1) are economically small and statistically insignificant.  Theyk
9:215:19136:26:26:72:537:191:117:Times:117:Times:interpret this result as showing that eligible and ineligible households had similar tastes for saving in 1984, at
9:216:19250:26:26:72:530:165:117:Times:117:Times:the outset of the 401(k) program, and therefore that eligibility is exogenous with respect to tastes for saving
9:217:19361:26:26:72:531:139:117:Times:117:Times:in each earnings category.  They then employ cross-sectional regressions for 1987 and 1991 to show that, in
9:218:19468:26:0:72:535:113:117:Times:117:Times:each earnings category, eligible households in those years held more total financial assets than ineligibles did
10:219:19580:0:13:72:88:202:117:Times:42:Times:      A potential response to this criticism is that, at the beginning of the 401(k) program in 1984, typical7
10:220:19690:13:13:72:528:189:117:Times:117:Times:401(k) were likely to be small.  This response, however, ignores an important fact: most early 401(k)s were
10:221:19797:13:13:71:535:176:117:Times:117:Times:not new plans per se, but rather conversions of long-standing after-tax thrift plans.  Thus, for example, in the

10:224:20038:25:13:71:88:125:117:Times:42:Times:      Benajmin (2000) uses the 1991 SIPP to estimate the cross-sectional effects of 401(k) eligibility on wealth8
10:225:20151:13:13:72:517:112:117:Times:117:Times:controlling for a very long list of economic and demographic characteristics.  His results are discussed in
10:226:20258:13:0:72:178:99:117:Times:117:Times:detail later in the paper.  
10:227:20287:0:26:72:529:709:117:Times:117:Times:and did not have lower levels of non-saving incentive financial assets.  They conclude that 401(k)s were net
10:228:20395:26:26:72:156:683:117:Times:117:Times:additions to wealth.
10:229:20415:26:26:107:527:657:117:Times:117:Times:The advantage of this test is its simplicity.  But there are several problems, too.  Most importantly,
10:230:20517:26:26:72:529:631:117:Times:117:Times:the test compares the wrong set of assets.  The appropriate way to determine whether eligible and ineligible
10:231:20625:26:25:72:538:605:117:Times:117:Times:households have similar tastes for saving requires a comparison of (a) the wealth of ineligible households and
10:232:20735:25:26:72:517:580:117:Times:117:Times:(b) the wealth of eligible households if they had not been eligible.  For example, if z is the proportion of
10:233:20843:26:26:72:512:554:117:Times:117:Times:401(k) balances that would have been saved even in the absence of the program, then the correct wealth
10:234:20945:26:26:72:518:528:117:Times:117:Times:measure to use for eligible households in the test above is the sum of  non-401(k) wealth plus z times the
10:235:21051:26:26:72:525:502:117:Times:117:Times:household’s 401(k) balances.  Poterba, Venti, and Wise implicitly assume that z is equal to zero.  That is,
10:236:21158:26:26:72:527:476:117:Times:117:Times:they assume that all 401(k) balances are net saving.  Clearly, this creates a bias in favor of understating the
10:237:21269:26:26:72:501:450:117:Times:42:Times:correlation between eligibility and tastes for saving and overstating the effects of 401(k)s on saving.  7
10:238:21375:26:26:108:507:424:117:Times:117:Times:A second concern is that the Poterba, Venti, and Wise (1995) test ignores non-401(k) pension
10:239:21467:26:26:71:524:398:117:Times:117:Times:wealth.  In preliminary work, Engelhardt (1999) uses the 1992 Health and Retirement Study and replicates
10:240:21571:26:26:72:530:372:117:Times:117:Times:the finding that eligible households hold more total financial assets than ineligibles.  However, he also finds
10:241:21682:26:26:72:540:346:117:Times:117:Times:that once non-401(k) pension wealth is included, there is no significant difference in the wealth of eligible and
10:242:21795:26:26:72:531:320:117:Times:117:Times:ineligible households by earnings category.    These and other concerns (see Bernheim and Garrett 1995 and
10:243:21901:26:26:72:510:294:117:Times:117:Times:Engen, Gale, and Scholz 1996a, 1996) suggest that, although controlling for earnings at a point in time
10:244:22004:26:25:72:514:268:117:Times:117:Times:makes eligible and ineligible households look more similar than otherwise, it does not provide sufficient
10:245:22109:25:0:72:334:243:117:Times:42:Times:control to remove all residual differences in tastes for saving.8

11:247:22227:0:26:72:442:709:117:Times:117:Times:B.  Tests using Successive cross-sections of  “Like families” or “Similar saver groups”
11:248:22314:26:26:108:433:683:117:Times:117:Times:(1) Tests Comparing Financial Assets Over Time for Eligible Families Only
11:249:22387:26:26:108:529:657:117:Times:117:Times:Poterba, Venti, and Wise (1995) propose a second approach as well.  This test compares how asset
11:250:22483:26:26:71:541:631:117:Times:117:Times:balances evolve over time for successive cross-sections of “similar savers”--for example, eligible households. 
11:251:22594:26:25:71:537:605:117:Times:117:Times:In this test, the effects of 401(k)s are identified by the assumption that the only significant difference between
11:252:22708:25:26:71:534:580:117:Times:117:Times:the samples of eligible households in earlier and later years is that eligible households in later years have had
11:253:22821:26:26:71:522:554:117:Times:117:Times:increased years of exposure to 401(k)s (and IRAs).  Thus, if eligible households in later years have higher
11:254:22928:26:26:71:533:528:117:Times:117:Times:financial assets than those in earlier years, controlling for household characteristics, the conclusion would be
11:255:23040:26:26:71:179:502:117:Times:117:Times:that 401(k)s raise saving.
11:256:23066:26:26:107:536:476:117:Times:117:Times:To implement this test, Poterba, Venti, and Wise use the sample of eligible households only in 1984,
11:257:23166:26:52:71:300:450:117:Times:117:Times:1987, and 1991, and specify an equation of the form: 
11:258:23219:52:52:71:84:398:117:Times:117:Times:(2)
11:259:23222:52:26:71:507:346:117:Times:117:Times:In this specification, X and Y are defined as in (1), and IN84 and IN91 are indicator variables showing
11:260:23325:26:26:71:534:320:117:Times:117:Times:whether the household is in the 1984 or 1991 samples, respectively.  At the risk of oversimplifying, the main
11:261:23434:26:25:71:429:294:117:Times:42:Times:findings are:  when W represents non-saving incentive financial assets, * and * are approximately zero;E84  E91
11:262:23545:25:26:72:264:269:117:Times:42:Times:when W represents total financial assets, * is positive and significant (and the 1984 sample is excluded dueE91
11:263:23656:26:26:72:525:243:117:Times:117:Times:to missing 401(k) balance data).  Given the identifying restrictions, these results suggest that 401(k)s raise
11:264:23766:26:26:72:268:217:117:Times:117:Times:private saving and do not reduce other saving.
11:265:23812:26:26:107:533:191:117:Times:117:Times:A significant advantage of this approach is that it does not require that eligibles and ineligibles have
11:266:23916:26:26:72:522:165:117:Times:117:Times:similar tastes for saving.  However, there are problems, too.  First, the test assumes that average tastes for
11:267:24026:26:26:72:523:139:117:Times:117:Times:saving among eligible households are constant over time.  In fact, average tastes could have risen or fallen
11:268:24134:26:0:72:489:113:117:Times:117:Times:among eligibles and thus biased the test in either direction.  We investigate this issue in section V.
12:269:24236:0:13:72:88:138:117:Times:42:Times:      On the other hand, one might argue that the declining official personal saving rate over this period would9
12:270:24349:13:13:72:537:125:117:Times:117:Times:work in the opposite direction and serve to reduce financial assets.  However, the official personal saving rate
12:271:24461:13:13:72:539:112:117:Times:117:Times:badly mismeasures changes in wealth--which are the focus of this study--and in particular omits capital gains,
12:272:24571:13:0:72:366:99:117:Times:117:Times:which were large during this period.  See Gale and Sabelhaus (1999).
12:273:24641:0:26:108:530:709:117:Times:117:Times:Second, the identifying restriction that no other relevant factors changed between 1984 and 1991 is
12:274:24740:26:26:72:507:683:117:Times:117:Times:simply implausible.  Briefly, during this period, the stock market boomed, real interest rates were high
12:275:24844:26:26:72:540:657:117:Times:117:Times:relative to previous years, social security benefits were cut back significantly in the 1983 reforms, and defined
12:276:24957:26:26:72:523:631:117:Times:117:Times:benefit pension coverage fell significantly (see Engen, Gale and Scholz 1996a).  In addition, the decline in
12:277:25065:26:25:72:528:605:117:Times:117:Times:inflation and in marginal tax rates over this period caused a shift in value from real assets, such as housing,
12:278:25176:25:26:72:515:580:117:Times:117:Times:toward financial assets (See the analysis in Feldstein 1980, Summers 1981, and Poterba 1984).  Finally,
12:279:25279:26:26:72:536:554:117:Times:117:Times:between 1984 and 1991, aggregate financial assets rose by $4 trillion whereas saving incentive balances rose
12:280:25387:26:26:72:521:528:117:Times:117:Times:by about $1 trillion (Engen, Gale, and Scholz 1996a).  Thus, something other than saving incentives must
12:281:25491:26:26:72:524:502:117:Times:117:Times:have been boosting financial assets.  The existence of these non-401(k) factors makes the “similar savers”
12:282:25597:26:26:72:512:476:117:Times:117:Times:test based only on the results for eligibles difficult to interpret, and surely biased toward overstating the
12:283:25706:26:26:72:197:450:117:Times:42:Times:impact of 401(k)s on saving.  9
12:284:25737:26:26:108:521:424:117:Times:117:Times:Third, the test assumes that the additive impact of 401(k)s on wealth is the same in each earnings
12:285:25835:26:26:72:502:398:117:Times:117:Times:class.  However, most participants contribute similar proportions of their salary to 401(k)s, making it
12:286:25938:26:26:72:404:372:117:Times:117:Times:plausible that the additive effect would vary across earnings groups over time.
12:287:26017:26:26:108:469:346:117:Times:117:Times:(2) Tests Comparing Financial Assets Over Time for Eligible and Ineligible Families
12:288:26100:26:26:108:516:320:117:Times:117:Times:One way to address the problems created by examining only eligible families over time is to use
12:289:26195:26:26:72:507:294:117:Times:117:Times:ineligible families over time as a control group.  In this test, the effects of 401(k)s are identified by the
12:290:26304:26:25:72:506:268:117:Times:117:Times:assumption that nothing that changed over the sample period had a differential impact on the group of
12:291:26405:25:26:72:501:243:117:Times:117:Times:eligibles relative to the group of ineligibles.  Thus, if assets rose more for eligibles over time than for
12:292:26512:26:26:72:518:217:117:Times:117:Times:ineligibles, the difference would be interpreted as the positive effect of 401(k)s on wealth accumulation.  
12:293:26620:26:0:108:532:191:117:Times:117:Times:To implement this test, Poterba, Venti, and Wise (1995) estimate regressions with the same form as
13:294:26718:0:0:159:452:655:122:Times:122:Times:Wj'"I%Xj$I%E6K'2((Ik(Yjk)%*I84(IN84j%*I91(IN91j%uIj.
13:295:26772:0:52:71:262:709:117:Times:117:Times:(2), but for samples of ineligible households:
13:296:26818:52:52:71:84:657:117:Times:117:Times:(3)
13:297:26821:52:25:71:514:605:117:Times:117:Times:where variables are defined analogously to equation (2) and W represents non-saving incentive financial
13:298:26924:25:26:71:214:580:117:Times:42:Times:assets. They find that * and * are approximately zero.  Thus, the result of separately estimating (2) andI84  I91
13:299:27037:26:26:72:522:554:117:Times:117:Times:(3) is that financial assets rose for eligibles as a group over this period, but did not rise for ineligibles as a
13:300:27151:26:26:72:523:528:117:Times:117:Times:group.  Poterba, Venti, and Wise (1995) interpret this finding as evidence that 401(k)s have raised saving.
13:301:27258:26:26:107:517:502:117:Times:117:Times:This is clearly a stronger test than any based only on samples of eligibles over time, but it is still
13:302:27360:26:26:72:534:476:117:Times:117:Times:problematic.  First, as with tests based only on eligible households, one concern is whether average tastes for
13:303:27471:26:26:72:503:450:117:Times:117:Times:saving changed over time.  But for this test, the relevant question is whether average tastes for saving
13:304:27575:26:26:72:508:424:117:Times:117:Times:changed for eligible households relative to ineligible households.  This issue is discussed in  section V.
13:305:27681:26:26:107:537:398:117:Times:117:Times:Second, a test comparing the effects of estimating (2) on eligibles and (3) on ineligibles measures the
13:306:27784:26:26:72:536:372:117:Times:117:Times:impact of 401(k)s with a single coefficient for each year. But as shown above, eligibles as a group started the
13:307:27895:26:26:72:538:346:117:Times:117:Times:sample period with higher earnings, financial assets, and wealth than ineligibles did.  Thus, any change that is
13:308:28007:26:26:72:538:320:117:Times:117:Times:not controlled for and that raised all financial assets by the same proportionate amount would have increased
13:309:28116:26:26:72:537:294:117:Times:117:Times:financial assets by a larger arithmetic amount for eligibles than for ineligibles.  This would appear, in (2) and
13:310:28229:26:25:72:535:268:117:Times:117:Times:(3), as a larger effect over time for eligibles relative to ineligibles, but would not be due to 401(k)s. Thus, for
13:311:28344:25:26:72:505:243:117:Times:117:Times:example, the stock market boom, or proportionate shifts in the allocation of wealth from real assets to
13:312:28447:26:26:72:507:217:117:Times:117:Times:financial assets would lead to spurious increases in financial assets for eligibles relative to ineligibles. 
13:313:28556:26:26:72:540:191:117:Times:117:Times:Likewise, any change that aided high-earnings households relative to low-earners would have similar spurious
13:314:28664:26:26:72:530:165:117:Times:117:Times:effects.  For example, the well-documented widening of the income distribution helped high-earners relative
13:315:28771:26:26:72:534:139:117:Times:117:Times:to low-earners.  The stock market boom did as well, because high-earning households are more likely to hold
13:316:28878:26:0:72:514:113:117:Times:117:Times:stocks and hold a larger share of their portfolio in stocks (Poterba and Samwick 1999) than low-earning

14:318:29040:0:39:72:92:177:117:Times:42:Times:       Engen and Gale (1997, tables 4-6 and 8-10) also estimate a single equation model of the form:10
14:319:29142:39:13:72:228:138:117:Times:42:Times:The impact of 401(k)s is given by *.  This approach, however, combines the coefficient estimates for3
14:320:29243:13:13:72:523:125:117:Times:117:Times:eligibles and ineligibles, which is not a valid restriction if tastes for saving differ across groups. Appendix
14:321:29354:13:13:72:522:112:117:Times:117:Times:Tables 1 and 2 show that this restriction is rejected by the data.  Recent analyses by Sabelhaus and Ayotte
14:322:29461:13:0:72:494:99:117:Times:117:Times:(1998) and Pence (2000) employ the specification above and thus are subject to the same critique.

14:324:29574:26:26:107:539:683:117:Times:117:Times:A third concern is that this test, like the one for eligible households described above, assumes that the
14:325:29679:26:26:71:499:657:117:Times:117:Times:effect of 401(k)s on wealth is the same across all earnings classes.  This clearly need not be the case.
14:326:29783:26:26:107:430:631:117:Times:117:Times:(3) Tests Comparing Wealth Over Time for Eligible and Ineligible Families
14:327:29856:26:25:108:538:605:117:Times:117:Times:In earlier work (Engen and Gale 1997, tables 5-7 and 11-13), we estimate (2) and (3) on net financial
14:328:29957:25:26:72:525:580:117:Times:117:Times:assets and on broader measures of wealth that include housing equity.  Our results generally confirmed the
14:329:30063:26:26:72:513:554:117:Times:117:Times:Poterba, Venti, and Wise (1995) finding;  net financial assets rose more for eligibles as a group than for
14:330:30169:26:26:72:530:528:117:Times:117:Times:ineligibles.  These results, of course, are subject to the same problems as those noted above. We also found,
14:331:30278:26:26:72:510:502:117:Times:117:Times:however, that broader wealth measures that included housing equity did not rise for eligibles relative to
14:332:30383:26:26:72:528:476:117:Times:117:Times:ineligibles.  We concluded that the impact of 401(k)s on household wealth--as opposed to financial assets--
14:333:30490:26:26:71:133:450:117:Times:117:Times:was minimal.  
14:334:30504:26:26:107:516:424:117:Times:117:Times:These results have been criticized on several grounds.  First, there is concern about how average
14:335:30601:26:26:71:538:398:117:Times:117:Times:tastes for saving among eligibles evolved over time relative to ineligibles (Bernheim 1997).  Second, Poterba,
14:336:30711:26:26:71:519:372:117:Times:117:Times:Venti, and Wise (1996a, 1996b) note that at the beginning of the sample period, eligibles as a group had
14:337:30815:26:26:71:520:346:117:Times:117:Times:higher housing wealth than ineligibles did.  During the sample period, especially 1987-91, they argue that
14:338:30921:26:26:71:538:320:117:Times:117:Times:there were equal percentage declines in housing wealth among eligibles and ineligibles, due to housing market
14:339:31030:26:25:71:532:294:117:Times:117:Times:factors that are completely unrelated to 401(k)s.  However, because eligibles started out with higher housing
14:340:31139:25:26:71:526:269:117:Times:117:Times:wealth, they had a larger arithmetic decline in their housing wealth.  This shows up as a reduction in wealth
14:341:31248:26:26:71:504:243:117:Times:117:Times:for eligibles relative to ineligibles, because Engen and Gale (1997) use wealth levels as the dependent
14:342:31351:26:0:71:368:217:117:Times:42:Times:variable, but should not be interpreted as an offset to 401(k) wealth.10
15:343:31425:0:26:108:312:709:117:Times:117:Times:(4) Summary, reconciliation, and new directions
15:344:31472:26:26:108:514:683:117:Times:117:Times:Remarkably, the criticisms of the Engen and Gale (1997) estimates, which use wealth including
15:345:31565:26:26:72:540:657:117:Times:117:Times:housing equity as the dependent variable, almost exactly parallel the criticisms of the Poterba, Venti and Wise
15:346:31676:26:26:72:533:631:117:Times:117:Times:(1995) estimates, which use financial assets as the dependent variable.  In each case, the argument is that (a)
15:347:31787:26:25:72:537:605:117:Times:117:Times:eligibles as a group began the sample period with higher earnings and wealth than ineligibles, and (b) outside
15:348:31897:25:26:72:519:580:117:Times:117:Times:factors caused changes in wealth across earnings classes that ended up being confused with the impact of
15:349:32001:26:26:72:528:554:117:Times:117:Times:401(k)s.  The outside factors caused financial assets to grow in arithmetic terms for high-earners relative to
15:350:32111:26:26:72:540:528:117:Times:117:Times:low-earners over this period, leading Engen, Gale and Scholz (1996a, 1996b) to argue that tests of (2) and (3)
15:351:32221:26:26:72:504:502:117:Times:117:Times:using financial assets overstated the impact of 401(k) plans.  In contrast, other outside factors caused
15:352:32325:26:26:71:533:476:117:Times:117:Times:housing wealth to fall in arithmetic terms for high-earners relative to low-earners, leading Poterba, Venti and
15:353:32436:26:26:71:509:450:117:Times:117:Times:Wise (1996a, 1996b) to argue that tests using (2) and (3) that used broad wealth measures that include
15:354:32538:26:26:71:263:424:117:Times:117:Times:housing understated the impact of 401(k)s.  
15:355:32582:26:26:107:509:398:117:Times:117:Times:Two simple changes to (2) and (3) can resolve these problems.  First, to separate the effects of
15:356:32678:26:26:72:527:372:117:Times:117:Times:401(k) eligibility from changes in other factors that affect wealth and that have different effects at different
15:357:32790:26:26:72:520:346:117:Times:117:Times:earnings levels, the effects of eligibility should be examined within each earnings class rather than for the
15:358:32899:26:26:72:508:320:117:Times:117:Times:group as a whole.  For example, Poterba, Venti, and Wise (1996b, page 54) indicate that, despite large
15:359:33001:26:25:71:537:294:117:Times:117:Times:differences in housing equity between the typical eligible and the typical ineligible household, “within income
15:360:33112:25:26:71:484:269:117:Times:117:Times:intervals, the differences are typically small.”  Second, to remove the impact of factors that cause
15:361:33212:26:26:71:521:243:117:Times:117:Times:equiproportionate changes in wealth for different groups over time, analysis should examine the effects of
15:362:33318:26:26:71:533:217:117:Times:117:Times:401(k)s on log wealth rather wealth levels.  These are two of the significant changes to our previous analysis
15:363:33428:26:52:71:175:191:117:Times:117:Times:that we introduce below.
15:364:33452:52:26:71:294:139:117:Times:117:Times:III.  Modeling 401(k)s and Wealth Accumulation
15:365:33498:26:0:108:498:113:117:Times:117:Times:We develop our econometric model in several steps.  First, we eliminate the 1984 data from

16:372:33837:268:13:72:92:128:117:Times:42:Times:       In practice, the standard errors would be slightly different, because (5) imposes the assumption that11
16:373:33947:13:16:109:512:115:117:Times:117:Times: , where  and  represent the standard deviations of the error terms in equations (4) and (5)
16:374:34039:16:0:72:125:99:117:Times:117:Times:respectively.
16:375:34054:0:26:72:539:709:117:Times:117:Times:consideration since the SIPP does not provide information on 401(k) balances in that year.  Thus, we drop the
16:376:34163:26:26:72:536:683:117:Times:117:Times:IN84 terms in equations (2) and (3).   Second, we expand (2) and (3), which estimate wealth for eligibles and
16:377:34272:26:52:72:412:657:117:Times:117:Times:ineligibles separately, to allow the coefficient on IN91 to vary by earnings class:
16:378:34355:52:25:72:85:605:117:Times:117:Times:(4)
16:379:34358:25:52:72:85:580:117:Times:117:Times:(5)
16:380:34361:52:26:72:510:528:117:Times:117:Times:Third, we multiply (4) by the eligibility indicator and (5) by 1- the eligibility indicator and combine the
16:381:34468:26:52:72:255:502:117:Times:117:Times:equations to yield our central specification:
16:382:34513:52:104:72:85:450:117:Times:117:Times:(6)
16:383:34516:104:26:72:370:346:117:Times:42:Times:In (6), W measures wealth, X is a vector of demographic variables, Y  indexes earnings categories, IN91k
16:384:34620:26:26:72:514:320:117:Times:117:Times:indicates if a household is in the 1991 sample, and ELIG shows if the household is eligible for a 401(k).
16:385:34725:26:26:107:525:294:117:Times:117:Times:Estimating (6) will yield the same coefficients as estimating (4) for eligibles and (5) for ineligibles
16:386:34828:26:25:72:218:268:117:Times:42:Times:and then differencing the results.     Also, (6) generalizes specifications used in earlier work.  The successive11
16:387:34943:25:26:72:375:243:117:Times:42:Times:cross-section analyses outlined above assume that * = * and * = * for all earnings groups k.  Some otherEk  E  Ik  I
16:388:35059:26:26:72:349:217:117:Times:117:Times:features of this specification are worth discussing in more detail. 
16:389:35127:26:66:72:148:191:117:Times:117:Times:A.  Control group
17:390:35144:66:13:72:92:125:117:Times:42:Times:       In our sample, mean household financial assets were 25 percent of mean net worth in 1984 and rose to12
17:391:35253:13:13:72:538:112:117:Times:117:Times:33 percent in 1991.  Median holdings of financial assets were 7 percent of median net worth in 1984 and rose
17:392:35361:13:0:72:531:99:117:Times:117:Times:to 13 percent in 1991.  Aggregate data follow similar trends, with financial assets an even higher proportion
17:393:35472:0:26:108:270:709:117:Times:42:Times:The key coefficients in (6) are * - *, which indicate how much wealth increased in each earningsEk  Ik
17:394:35574:26:26:72:537:683:117:Times:117:Times:class from 1987 to 1991 for eligible households relative to ineligible households.  Thus, the control group for
17:395:35685:26:26:71:534:657:117:Times:117:Times:eligibles is ineligibles in the same earnings class.  There are several advantages to using this control group. 
17:396:35797:26:26:71:498:631:117:Times:117:Times:Two reasons were noted above.  Eligibles and ineligibles have similar--though clearly not identical--
17:397:35898:26:25:71:539:605:117:Times:117:Times:economic and demographic characteristics after controlling for earnings, and changes that are uncontrolled for
17:398:36008:25:26:71:529:580:117:Times:117:Times:and that have differential effects across earnings classes will not bias the results in this specification.  There
17:399:36122:26:26:71:535:554:117:Times:117:Times:are several additional reasons, though, to isolate effects of 401(k)s by earnings class.  First, the rate and level
17:400:36237:26:26:71:525:528:117:Times:117:Times:of saving appear to vary across earnings groups (Dynan, Skinner, and Zeldes 2000, and Hubbard, Skinner,
17:401:36340:26:26:71:535:502:117:Times:117:Times:and Zeldes 1995).  In addition, the constraints that savers face--for example, government means-testing rules
17:402:36449:26:26:71:529:476:117:Times:117:Times:or tax rates and other rules--typically vary by earnings classes.  Allowing for different effects of 401(k)s by
17:403:36560:26:26:71:521:450:117:Times:117:Times:earnings group will control for these effects, as long as they do not differ between eligibles and ineligibles
17:404:36670:26:26:71:500:424:117:Times:117:Times:within an earnings category.   Second, the ability to substitute other assets into a 401(k) or to finance
17:405:36775:26:26:71:531:398:117:Times:117:Times:contributions with debt may vary across earnings classes, since high-earning households tend to have higher
17:406:36882:26:26:71:519:372:117:Times:117:Times:wealth.  Third, to the extent that participants contribute similar percentages of their salary to 401(k)s, the
17:407:36992:26:26:71:294:346:117:Times:117:Times:effects of 401(k)s on wealth will vary with earnings.
17:408:37045:26:26:71:336:320:117:Times:117:Times:B.  Narrow versus Broad Measures of the Dependent Variable
17:409:37103:26:25:108:530:294:117:Times:117:Times:We consider the impact of 401(k)s on both net financial assets and wealth (net financial assets plus
17:410:37203:25:26:72:510:269:117:Times:117:Times:housing equity).  In the aftermath of TRA 1986, which eliminated interest deductions on non-mortgage
17:411:37303:26:26:72:506:243:117:Times:117:Times:consumer debt, high-income households switched their portfolios toward increased mortgage debt and
17:412:37401:26:26:72:536:217:117:Times:117:Times:reduced non-mortgage debt (Maki 1999).  A study that examined only net financial assets would mistake this
17:413:37507:26:26:72:532:191:117:Times:117:Times:shift in the composition of debt for an increase in net financial assets.  In addition, for the typical household,
17:414:37621:26:0:72:285:165:117:Times:42:Times:financial assets are a small fraction of net worth.      Thus, an investigation of the effect of 401(k)s only on net12
18:415:37739:0:13:72:528:227:117:Times:117:Times:of net worth because financial assets are heavily concentrated among the very wealthiest households, which
18:416:37845:13:25:72:229:214:117:Times:117:Times:are under represented in our data set.
18:417:37883:25:13:72:92:189:117:Times:42:Times:       See Engen, Gale and Scholz (1996b).  Simple calculations show that with typical employer matching13
18:418:37989:13:13:72:516:176:117:Times:117:Times:contributions, workers should do everything possible to maximize 401(k) contributions at least up to the
18:419:38093:13:13:72:530:163:117:Times:117:Times:match limit.  Kusko, Poterba, and Wilcox (1994) report that about 75 percent of 401(k) participants in their
18:420:38201:13:25:72:322:150:117:Times:117:Times:sample at one firm contributed at or above the match limit.
18:421:38260:25:13:72:92:125:117:Times:42:Times:       As Stiglitz (1988, p. 595) notes:  "The individual may, of course, not consciously perceive himself as14
18:422:38371:13:13:72:530:112:117:Times:117:Times:borrowing for these purposes; he may say to himself in April that it would be a good idea to put money into
18:423:38478:13:0:72:516:99:117:Times:117:Times:an IRA; and then in June, he may decide that he would like to buy a new car; given his available cash, he
18:424:38585:0:26:72:355:709:117:Times:117:Times:financial assets would miss many potential sources of substitution.
18:425:38652:26:26:107:530:683:117:Times:117:Times:Substitution between housing wealth and 401(k) plans should not be surprising.  Both types of tax-
18:426:38750:26:26:72:501:657:117:Times:117:Times:favored assets are relatively illiquid and typically held for a long period.  In addition, there are strong
18:427:38857:26:26:72:524:631:117:Times:117:Times:financial incentives for households to substitute and thus diversify their tax-preferred portfolio.  Employer
18:428:38966:26:25:72:540:605:117:Times:117:Times:matching of 401(k) contributions implies that financing a 401(k) with tax-deductible mortgage borrowing can
18:429:39073:25:26:72:155:580:117:Times:42:Times:be quite lucrative.      Even if households are not consciously gaming the tax system, there could still be13
18:430:39182:26:26:72:507:554:117:Times:117:Times:substitution between 401(k)s and home equity that is unintentional.  Consider different cohorts of new
18:431:39284:26:26:72:528:528:117:Times:117:Times:homeowners who are observationally equivalent except that the new homeowners in the later year have had
18:432:39387:26:26:72:528:502:117:Times:117:Times:longer exposure to 401(k)s and so have placed more funds in 401(k)s than did those in the younger cohort. 
18:433:39493:26:26:71:516:476:117:Times:117:Times:Now suppose that households in the later cohort have smaller balances of liquid cash (because they have
18:434:39596:26:26:71:528:450:117:Times:117:Times:moved more of their liquid cash into 401(k)s) than those in the earlier cohort).  Because they have less cash
18:435:39705:26:26:71:528:424:117:Times:117:Times:available, households in the later cohort might purchase the same size home as the earlier cohort, but with a
18:436:39814:26:26:71:533:398:117:Times:117:Times:larger mortgage.   A comparison of households in these two cohorts would reveal that households in the later
18:437:39922:26:26:71:529:372:117:Times:117:Times:cohort had less housing equity, more 401(k) wealth, but the same overall wealth compared to households in
18:438:40027:26:26:71:506:346:117:Times:117:Times:the younger cohort. As an analytical statement, households in the later cohort were clearly substituting
18:439:40131:26:26:71:538:320:117:Times:117:Times:401(k)s for home equity relative to earlier cohorts, even if this substitution were completely unintentional and
18:440:40243:26:26:71:515:294:117:Times:117:Times:even if the household itself were unaware of the comparison.  Similar types of "inadvertent" substitution
18:441:40348:26:92:71:192:268:117:Times:42:Times:could be quite widespread.14
19:442:40376:92:25:72:356:176:117:Times:117:Times:finds that he needs to borrow more than he otherwise would have."
19:443:40441:25:13:72:92:151:117:Times:42:Times:       Suppose 401(k)s have no effect on saving, and consider an eligible household (E) in year 1 with wealth15
19:444:40552:13:13:72:535:138:117:Times:117:Times:of 100, and an ineligible household (I) with lower tastes for saving and hence wealth of 50.  (Assume the two
19:445:40661:13:13:72:527:125:117:Times:117:Times:households have equal earnings.)  If market forces raise all asset values by 20 percent in one period, then E
19:446:40770:13:13:72:520:112:117:Times:117:Times:will have wealth of 120 and I will have 60.  A difference-in-difference estimate using wealth levels would
19:447:40876:13:0:72:528:99:117:Times:117:Times:show that E’s wealth rose by 10 more than I’s.  By construction, however, this effect is not due to 401(k)s. 
19:448:40987:0:26:108:532:709:117:Times:117:Times:It is also worth noting that between about 14 percent of eligible homeowners had home equity loans
19:449:41085:26:26:72:527:683:117:Times:117:Times:in 1991; about 19 percent bought new homes between 1987 and 1991; and a reasonable estimate is that 12
19:450:41187:26:26:72:537:657:117:Times:117:Times:percent extracted equity from their home via a refinancing between 1987 and 1991 (Bernheim 1997).  Thus a
19:451:41292:26:26:72:456:631:117:Times:117:Times:significant portion of eligible families had direct access to ways to change in home equity. 
19:452:41385:26:25:72:273:605:117:Times:117:Times:C.  Functional Form of the Dependent Variable
19:453:41430:25:26:108:511:580:117:Times:117:Times:We estimate models with four different functional forms of the dependent variable: the level of
19:454:41525:26:26:72:511:554:117:Times:117:Times:wealth; the ratio of wealth to earnings; and the natural log of these two values.  We use wealth levels to
19:455:41631:26:26:72:515:528:117:Times:117:Times:compare to previous research.  Using wealth-earnings ratios, however, is a natural way to control for the
19:456:41736:26:26:72:517:502:117:Times:117:Times:effects of 401(k)s if participants at different earnings levels tend to contribute similar percentage of their
19:457:41846:26:26:72:536:476:117:Times:117:Times:salary to 401(k)s.  In addition, using the wealth-earnings ratio helps control for any variation in earnings over
19:458:41959:26:26:72:516:450:117:Times:117:Times:time within earnings categories.  Finally, in detailed dynamic saving models (see, for example, Hubbard,
19:459:42063:26:26:72:514:424:117:Times:117:Times:Skinner, and Zeldes 1995, Samwick 1995, Laibson, Repetto, and Tobacman, 1998, or Engen, Gale, and
19:460:42160:26:26:72:537:398:117:Times:117:Times:Uccello 1999) implications often can be drawn as readily with regard to wealth-earnings ratios as with regard
19:461:42269:26:26:71:140:372:117:Times:117:Times:to wealth levels.
19:462:42286:26:26:107:539:346:117:Times:117:Times:The justification for estimating log wealth and log wealth/earnings ratios stems from the combination
19:463:42387:26:26:71:503:320:117:Times:117:Times:of two issues.  First, eligibles and ineligibles start the sample period with different assets, even within
19:464:42494:26:26:71:540:294:117:Times:117:Times:earnings groups.  This suggests that there may be still differences in tastes for saving between the two groups,
19:465:42606:26:25:71:510:268:117:Times:117:Times:even after controlling for earnings.  Second, if the groups begin the sample with different wealth levels,
19:466:42712:25:26:71:528:243:117:Times:117:Times:market forces that cause assets to rise or fall by a constant percentage rather than by a constant amount will
19:467:42822:26:67:71:493:217:117:Times:42:Times:create spurious effects for a specification that controls for wealth levels or wealth/earnings ratios.      A15
20:468:42933:67:13:72:528:150:117:Times:117:Times:Likewise, if the market fell by 20 percent, E’s wealth fall by 10 relative to I, but this would not be evidence
20:469:43044:13:25:72:192:137:117:Times:117:Times:that 401(k)s reduced saving.
20:470:43072:25:13:71:92:112:117:Times:42:Times:       Pence (2000) explicitly recognizes these issues and proposes the use of inverse hyperbolic sine16
20:471:43176:13:0:72:364:99:117:Times:117:Times:transformation of wealth, rather than the log, to resolve the problem.
20:472:43248:0:26:72:370:709:117:Times:42:Times:natural way to control for percentage changes is by using log wealth.     16
20:473:43324:26:26:72:183:683:117:Times:117:Times:D.  Explanatory Variables
20:474:43349:26:26:108:535:657:117:Times:117:Times:Dynamic models with earnings uncertainty (see Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes 1995, Samwick 1995,
20:475:43443:26:26:72:520:631:117:Times:117:Times:Laibson, Repetto, and Tobacman 1998, and Engen, Gale, and Uccello 1999) do not generate closed-form
20:476:43542:26:25:72:538:605:117:Times:117:Times:solutions for wealth.  However, the results show clearly that wealth or wealth/earnings ratios should evolve as
20:477:43653:25:26:72:540:580:117:Times:117:Times:a function of age (for life-cycle reasons), education (as a proxy for the slope of the age-earnings profile and/or
20:478:43767:26:26:72:522:554:117:Times:117:Times:tastes for saving), earnings (because social security, welfare programs, and income taxes are progressive),
20:479:43874:26:26:72:510:528:117:Times:117:Times:and marital status (as a proxy for family size).   All of these are controlled for in all previous studies of
20:480:43983:26:26:72:523:502:117:Times:117:Times:401(k)s.  In addition, theory and evidence suggests that pension coverage, family size, the presence of two
20:481:44090:26:26:72:539:476:117:Times:117:Times:earners and taste-shifters relating to race and sex of the household head should affect saving as well.  We thus
20:482:44202:26:26:72:279:450:117:Times:117:Times:include all of these as right-hand side regressors.
20:483:44253:26:26:108:538:424:117:Times:117:Times:All of the explanatory variables other than family size are expressed are indicator variables.  For age,
20:484:44357:26:26:72:507:398:117:Times:117:Times:the categories are 35-44, 45-54, and 55-64, with 25-34 being the omitted category.  For education, the
20:485:44459:26:26:72:536:372:117:Times:117:Times:categories are 12 years, 13-15 years, 16 years, and more than 16 years, with less than 12 years as the omitted
20:486:44569:26:26:72:539:346:117:Times:117:Times:category.  For earnings, we use the categories listed in tables 1-3, but we exclude all households with earnings
20:487:44681:26:26:72:525:320:117:Times:117:Times:less than $10,000 from the regressions because of data irregularities.  This should have minimal impact on
20:488:44787:26:25:72:524:294:117:Times:117:Times:the results since these households account for only 1 percent of 401(k) balances.  The regressions omit the
20:489:44894:25:53:72:341:269:117:Times:117:Times:$10,000-$20,000 earnings category as an explanatory variable.
20:490:44955:53:25:72:125:216:117:Times:117:Times:IV.  Results
20:491:44967:25:92:72:402:191:117:Times:117:Times:A.   Descriptive data on asset changes by eligibility status and earnings group
21:492:45046:92:0:72:92:99:117:Times:42:Times:       Pence (2000) provides further discussion of alternative methods of generating standard errors.17
21:493:45151:0:26:108:515:709:117:Times:117:Times:Table 5 shows how median wealth measures evolved from 1987 to 1991 for eligible households
21:494:45241:26:26:71:532:683:117:Times:117:Times:relative to ineligible households by earnings class.  For eligibles as a whole, median 401(k) balances rose by
21:495:45351:26:26:71:523:657:117:Times:117:Times:$1,214.  In earnings groups above $30,000, median 401(k) balances rose by between $1,700 and $6,000. 
21:496:45452:26:26:71:514:631:117:Times:117:Times:Thus, there was a substantial increase in median 401(k) balances during this period, especially in higher
21:497:45557:26:25:71:448:605:117:Times:117:Times:earnings groups.  Median balances in saving incentive accounts rose by similar amounts.
21:498:45644:25:26:107:532:580:117:Times:117:Times:Net financial assets rose for eligibles relative to ineligibles in middle- and upper-income groups, but
21:499:45747:26:26:71:520:554:117:Times:117:Times:not for the highest earnings group.  Other than saving incentive balances, financial assets fell for eligibles
21:500:45857:26:26:71:521:528:117:Times:117:Times:relative to ineligibles in most groups.  House value rose for eligibles relative to ineligibles within earnings
21:501:45968:26:26:71:536:502:117:Times:117:Times:groups, but mortgage debt rose even more--especially in high-earnings groups--so that housing equity fell for
21:502:46077:26:26:71:515:476:117:Times:117:Times:eligibles relative to ineligibles in three of the six groups and on an overall basis.  Median wealth rose for
21:503:46186:26:26:71:496:450:117:Times:117:Times:eligibles relative to ineligibles in most earnings groups, but fell for eligibles as a whole compared to
21:504:46290:26:26:71:118:424:117:Times:117:Times:ineligibles.
21:505:46302:26:26:71:268:398:117:Times:117:Times:B.  Replication and Extension of Earlier Work
21:506:46347:26:26:108:515:372:117:Times:117:Times:Table 6 replicates and extends earlier estimates by Poterba, Venti and Wise (PVW, 1995).  The
21:507:46440:26:26:72:534:346:117:Times:117:Times:explanatory variables include only variables used in their study:   indicators for age, education, earnings, and
21:508:46552:26:26:72:517:320:117:Times:117:Times:marital status, and whether the household is in the 1991 sample.  Poterba, Venti, and Wise (1995) report
21:509:46656:26:26:72:538:294:117:Times:117:Times:analytical standard errors.  Monte Carlo tests suggest that, in the presence of heteroskedasticity, bootstrapped
21:510:46768:26:25:72:524:268:117:Times:117:Times:standard errors provide more reliable estimates than analytical standard errors (Rogers 1992).  We present
21:511:46874:25:26:72:506:243:117:Times:117:Times:results using both approaches.  Items in parentheses in the tables represent t-statistics using analytical
21:512:46980:26:26:72:531:217:117:Times:117:Times:standard errors.  Items in square brackets represent t-statistics using bootstrapped standard errors (with 200
21:513:47090:26:26:72:134:191:117:Times:42:Times:replications).17
21:514:47106:26:26:108:523:165:117:Times:117:Times:We begin by estimating (2) for eligibles.  When the dependent variable is net financial assets, we 
21:515:47205:26:0:72:145:139:117:Times:42:Times:estimate that * = $1,190 (with t=2.91), the first entry in table 6.  Median 401(k) balances among eligiblesE91
22:516:47317:0:26:71:539:709:117:Times:117:Times:increased by $1,214 over this period (table 5), so the estimate in table 6 suggests that all 401(k) contributions
22:517:47430:26:26:71:499:683:117:Times:117:Times:were new saving, which is consistent with the results and interpretation given in PVW (1995).  If the
22:518:47531:26:26:71:416:657:117:Times:42:Times:dependent variable is financial assets excluding saving incentives, we obtain * = -$600 (t=3.41),E91
22:519:47631:26:26:72:512:631:117:Times:42:Times:suggesting a drop in other financial assets.  For ineligible households, we estimate  (3) and find that * isI91
22:520:47742:26:25:72:376:605:117:Times:117:Times:approximately zero.  These results are similar to PVW (1995, Table 5).
22:521:47812:25:26:107:526:580:117:Times:117:Times:The next step is to allow the effects of 401(k)s to vary by earnings class over time.   The results of
22:522:47914:26:26:71:537:554:117:Times:117:Times:estimating (4) for eligibles with the dependent variable equal to net financial assets is given in the first row of
22:523:48029:26:26:71:520:528:117:Times:117:Times:table 6 in the 2nd-7th columns.  The * coefficients are positive in each income class.  Using the analytical
22:524:48137:26:26:71:526:502:117:Times:117:Times:standard errors, the results are significant only in the top two earnings groups.  More importantly, an F-test
22:525:48247:26:26:71:518:476:117:Times:117:Times:easily rejects the view that the coefficients are all equal across earnings classes.  The test statistic is 6.23,
22:526:48360:26:26:71:523:450:117:Times:117:Times:whereas the 1 percent critical value for F(5, 6407) is 3.02.  The huge increase in financial assets in the top
22:527:48470:26:26:71:531:424:117:Times:117:Times:earning group, $7,756, is particularly notable and we return to this estimate below.  The second row of table
22:528:48579:26:26:71:525:398:117:Times:117:Times:6, columns 2-7, shows the same regression, but with wealth equal to non-saving incentive financial assets. 
22:529:48686:26:26:71:497:372:117:Times:117:Times:The coefficients are uniformly negative, and the top three earnings groups have large and significant
22:530:48787:26:26:71:282:346:117:Times:117:Times:coefficients, using the analytical standard errors.  
22:531:48840:26:26:107:531:320:117:Times:117:Times:The next two rows of table 6, columns 2-7, show the same regressions for ineligible households.  In
22:532:48939:26:25:71:508:294:117:Times:117:Times:the regression for financial assets, note the huge coefficient for the top income group ($7,223).  This is
22:533:49045:25:26:71:527:269:117:Times:117:Times:essentially the same increase as for high-earning eligibles noted above and shows the importance of using a
22:534:49152:26:26:71:521:243:117:Times:117:Times:control group, rather than simply relying on tests for eligible households over time.  Generally, there is no
22:535:49261:26:26:71:527:217:117:Times:117:Times:increase in financial assets for ineligible households by earnings group, except for the top group.  An F-test
22:536:49371:26:26:71:504:191:117:Times:117:Times:generates a test statistic of 136 (1 percent critical value = 3.02), thus easily rejecting the view that the
22:537:49479:26:26:71:250:165:117:Times:117:Times:coefficients are equal across income class.
22:538:49522:26:26:107:497:139:117:Times:117:Times:To compare the results for the eligible and ineligible households by earnings categories, we 
22:539:49615:26:0:71:534:113:117:Times:117:Times:subtract the coefficients in row 3 and 4 from those in 1 and 2 and calculate the standard errors.  These values
23:540:49728:0:26:71:518:709:117:Times:117:Times:are reported in the last two rows of the table and show positive but statistically insignificant increases for
23:541:49838:26:26:71:522:683:117:Times:117:Times:financial assets in all earnings groups except for households with earnings between $50,000 and $75,000,
23:542:49942:26:26:71:503:657:117:Times:117:Times:where the effect is positive and significant.  The table shows economically and statistically significant
23:543:50047:26:26:71:536:631:117:Times:117:Times:declines in non-saving incentive financial assets in the top three earnings groups.  All of the above discussion
23:544:50159:26:25:71:521:605:117:Times:117:Times:focuses on analytical standard errors, for comparison purposes with earlier work.  Using the bootstrapped
23:545:50264:25:26:71:377:580:117:Times:117:Times:standard errors reduces the significance of almost all of the coefficients.
23:546:50339:26:26:107:520:554:117:Times:117:Times:Thus, the results in table 6 generate several important findings.  First, we are able to replicate the
23:547:50441:26:26:71:530:528:117:Times:117:Times:results in earlier literature using equation (2) and (3) that show that using only a single parameter to capture
23:548:50553:26:26:71:537:502:117:Times:117:Times:year effects will generate results that are consistent with the view that 401(k)s raise saving.  Second, we show
23:549:50665:26:26:72:533:476:117:Times:117:Times:that the specification with a single parameter capturing year effects is statistically rejected in favor of a more
23:550:50779:26:26:72:515:450:117:Times:117:Times:general specification that allows the effects of 401(k)s to vary across earnings class and time.  Third, we
23:551:50886:26:26:71:506:424:117:Times:117:Times:show that using the more general specification implies smaller impacts of 401(k)s on financial assets. 
23:552:50989:26:26:71:506:398:117:Times:117:Times:Fourth, we show that using the bootstrapped standard errors reduces the significance of 401(k) effects
23:553:51091:26:26:71:108:372:117:Times:117:Times:further.  
23:554:51101:26:26:71:358:346:117:Times:117:Times:C.  Full Specification with Wealth Level as the Dependent Variable
23:555:51167:26:26:108:529:320:117:Times:117:Times:Table 7 provides estimates of (6) using wealth levels as the dependent variable.  The estimates that
23:556:51267:26:26:72:504:294:117:Times:117:Times:employ analytical standard errors show that 401(k) eligibility has a positive and significant impact on
23:557:51370:26:25:72:512:268:117:Times:117:Times:financial assets in earnings groups between $30,000 and $75,000, and leads to economically significant
23:558:51472:25:26:72:522:243:117:Times:117:Times:reductions in non-saving incentives financial assets in earnings groups above $40,000.  Examining wealth
23:559:51576:26:26:71:515:217:117:Times:117:Times:(defined as net financial assets plus housing equity) suggests only one positive significant impact (in the
23:560:51683:26:26:71:526:191:117:Times:117:Times:$30,000-$40,000 earnings class).  Examining non-saving incentive wealth suggests offsets in the top three
23:561:51788:26:26:71:161:165:117:Times:117:Times:earnings categories.  
23:562:51810:26:26:107:535:139:117:Times:117:Times:These results tell an interesting story, and one that is not completely consistent with either the earlier
23:563:51916:26:0:71:536:113:117:Times:117:Times:Poterba, Venti, and Wise (1995) or the Engen and Gale (1997) conclusions.   In the top earnings group, there
24:564:52026:0:26:71:525:709:117:Times:117:Times:appears to be no impact of 401(k)s on financial assets or wealth, and a significant reduction in other assets
24:565:52135:26:26:71:524:683:117:Times:117:Times:due to 401(k)s.  In the next two groups--with earnings between $40,000 and $75,000--401(k) eligibility is
24:566:52240:26:26:71:534:657:117:Times:117:Times:associated with higher financial assets, but not with higher wealth, and there is significant offset in both non-
24:567:52353:26:26:71:519:631:117:Times:117:Times:saving incentive financial assets (row 2) and non-saving incentive wealth (row 4).  The three top earnings
24:568:52459:26:25:71:531:605:117:Times:117:Times:groups account for about 70-80 percent of 401(k) balances in the two sample years (see table 2), and that in
24:569:52567:25:26:71:417:580:117:Times:117:Times:these groups there does not appear to be any positive effect of 401(k)s on wealth.
24:570:52649:26:26:107:519:554:117:Times:117:Times:For households with earnings between $30,000 and $40,000, the estimated impact of 401(k)s on
24:571:52741:26:26:71:534:528:117:Times:117:Times:saving is as large as the increase in 401(k) balances for eligibles in this group (table 5), suggesting that all of
24:572:52856:26:26:71:536:502:117:Times:117:Times:the 401(k) balances in this group are net new private saving.  This group accounts for about 11-16 percent of
24:573:52965:26:26:71:521:476:117:Times:117:Times:401(k) balances in each year.  For households with earnings between $10,000 and $30,000, the impact of
24:574:53067:26:26:71:520:450:117:Times:117:Times:401(k) eligibility is hard to discern:  wealth measures including 401(k)s generate positive but imprecisely
24:575:53174:26:26:71:507:424:117:Times:117:Times:estimated coefficients; wealth measures excluding 401(k)s generally generate negative but imprecisely
24:576:53275:26:26:71:517:398:117:Times:117:Times:estimated coefficients.  Part of the problem undoubtedly is the relatively small change in 401(k) balances
24:577:53381:26:26:71:531:372:117:Times:117:Times:among eligibles in these groups (see table 5).  These two groups contain  9-13 percent of 401(k) balances in
24:578:53489:26:26:71:146:346:117:Times:117:Times:each sample year.
24:579:53506:26:26:107:514:320:117:Times:117:Times:Thus, the results in table 7 suggest that between 70 and 80 percent of 401(k) balances accrue in
24:580:53602:26:25:71:512:294:117:Times:117:Times:earnings groups where eligibility has no noticeable impact on wealth accumulation.  Between 11 and 16
24:581:53703:25:26:71:539:269:117:Times:117:Times:percent accrue in the earnings group where upwards of 100 percent of 401(k) balances appear to represent net
24:582:53811:26:26:71:517:243:117:Times:117:Times:additions to private saving.  And the remaining 9-13 percent has an uncertain effect.  Note, however, that
24:583:53917:26:26:71:509:217:117:Times:117:Times:even if all of the balances of households with earnings below $40,000 were net saving, this would only
24:584:54019:26:26:71:322:191:117:Times:117:Times:account for between 25 and 29 percent of 401(k) balances.
24:585:54076:26:26:107:539:165:117:Times:117:Times:In addition, note that all of these effects are based on the analytical standard errors.  Using bootstraps
24:586:54182:26:26:71:523:139:117:Times:117:Times:generally reduces all of the t-statistics.  (Only one of the coefficients in table 7 is even significant at the 10
24:587:54296:26:0:71:521:113:117:Times:117:Times:percent level.)  Appendix tables 1 and 2 report the full set of coefficient estimates for the specifications in
25:588:54407:0:13:72:92:177:117:Times:42:Times:       The robust regression method is described in Stata (1993, volume 2, pp. 126-131).  The first step is an18
25:589:54519:13:13:72:523:164:117:Times:117:Times:ordinary least squares regression; outliers (i.e., any observation with Cook’s D>1) are then excluded.  The
25:590:54626:13:13:72:533:151:117:Times:117:Times:procedure then works iteratively: an ordinary least squares regression is run, weights are calculated based on
25:591:54736:13:13:72:507:138:117:Times:117:Times:the absolute residuals, and then those weights are used in estimating the next regression.  This process
25:592:54840:13:13:72:528:125:117:Times:117:Times:continues until convergence is obtained in the successive estimates.  The first set of weights used are Huber
25:593:54949:13:13:72:520:112:117:Times:117:Times:weights.  Based on those results, biweights are then used until convergence is obtained.  Both weights are
25:594:55055:13:0:72:396:99:117:Times:117:Times:used in order to offset potential problems with using either one or the other. 
25:595:55136:0:26:72:524:709:117:Times:117:Times:table 7 using net financial assets and wealth as the dependent variables.  The results indicate the economic
25:596:55244:26:26:72:533:683:117:Times:117:Times:and statistical significance of a wide range of explanatory variables, when entered alone and when interacted
25:597:55353:26:26:72:142:657:117:Times:117:Times:with eligibility.  
25:598:55372:26:26:107:537:631:117:Times:117:Times:Appendix table 3 provides similar estimates and generally similar results to table 7, but uses a robust
25:599:55475:26:25:72:169:605:117:Times:42:Times:regression technique.     We have also estimated the equations using ordinary least squares (OLS).  These18
25:600:55582:25:26:72:528:580:117:Times:117:Times:estimates are perhaps suspect because they may be unduly influenced by outliers and saving is known to be
25:601:55687:26:26:72:539:554:117:Times:117:Times:quite heterogeneous across households.  Nevertheless, the OLS estimates find no significant effects, except in
25:602:55797:26:26:72:528:528:117:Times:117:Times:the top earnings group where they show complete offset of 401(k) balances with reductions in other wealth.
25:603:55903:26:26:72:396:502:117:Times:117:Times:D.  Estimates by Saver Group with Wealth Level as the Dependent Variable
25:604:55975:26:26:108:522:476:117:Times:117:Times:Table 8 provides median regression estimates similar to table 7 but with the sample broken down
25:605:56070:26:26:72:533:450:117:Times:117:Times:into separate groups based on saving status.   The goal of this exercise is to help control for tastes for saving
25:606:56183:26:26:72:530:424:117:Times:117:Times:by isolating groups with similar propensities or similar opportunities to incur debt or shift assets.  Thus, we
25:607:56294:26:26:72:272:398:117:Times:117:Times:stratify by IRA status and homeowner status.   
25:608:56341:26:26:108:539:372:117:Times:117:Times:Among households with IRAs, 401(k) eligibility has a positive but statistically insignificant effect on
25:609:56444:26:26:71:534:346:117:Times:117:Times:net financial assets.  The impact on wealth is negative and insignificant in four of the six earnings categories,
25:610:56557:26:26:71:534:320:117:Times:117:Times:and positive and insignificant in two.  An F-test does not reject the view that all of the wealth coefficients are
25:611:56671:26:26:71:457:294:117:Times:117:Times:zero.  The test statistic is 0.61, whereas the 5 percent critical value for F (6, 5143) is 2.80. 
25:612:56768:26:25:107:536:268:117:Times:117:Times: For households without IRAs or Keoghs, the estimated effects on wealth are positive and significant
25:613:56868:25:26:71:501:243:117:Times:117:Times:for households with earnings between $30,000 and $75,000, and are as large as the change in 401(k)
25:614:56966:26:0:71:523:217:117:Times:117:Times:balances over time. Thus, plausibly all of these 401(k) balances represent net additions to private saving.  
26:615:57077:0:26:71:501:709:117:Times:117:Times:These groups held between 26 and 33 percent of 401(k) balances in 1987 and 1991.  However, using
26:616:57173:26:26:71:352:683:117:Times:117:Times:bootstrapped standard errors, none of these effects are significant.
26:617:57241:26:26:107:520:657:117:Times:117:Times:For homeowners, there is a strong positive significant impact of 401(k)s on financial assets in all
26:618:57340:26:26:71:524:631:117:Times:117:Times:earnings groups except the highest and the lowest, but there is no significant impact on wealth, and four of
26:619:57448:26:25:71:523:605:117:Times:117:Times:the six coefficients for wealth are actually negative.  This is important because homeowners hold about 88
26:620:57554:25:26:71:521:580:117:Times:117:Times:percent of 401(k) balances in each year of the sample.  The effect for the top earnings group is clearly not
26:621:57662:26:26:71:506:554:117:Times:117:Times:positive.  An F-test does not reject the hypothesis that all wealth coefficients in earnings groups below
26:622:57767:26:26:71:517:528:117:Times:117:Times:$75,000 are zero (the test statistic is 0.27, whereas the 1 percent critical value for F(5, 12434) is 3.02).   
26:623:57878:26:26:107:530:502:117:Times:117:Times:For renters, the effect of eligibility on net financial assets is positive and significant, and as large as
26:624:57985:26:26:71:518:476:117:Times:117:Times:the increase in 401(k) balances, in four earnings categories.  These groups account for about 8 percent of
26:625:58091:26:26:71:527:450:117:Times:117:Times:401(k) balances.  In the other earnings categories, eligibility does not have a positive and significant effect.
26:626:58203:26:26:108:517:424:117:Times:117:Times:In summary, separate estimates by saver status suggest that between 8 percent and 33 percent of
26:627:58298:26:26:72:539:398:117:Times:117:Times:401(k) balances represent new private saving, using the analytical standard errors.  This is consistent with the
26:628:58410:26:26:72:522:372:117:Times:117:Times:results in table 7, which provided estimates from 11-16 percent to 25-29 percent.  The net saving effect is
26:629:58517:26:26:72:449:346:117:Times:117:Times:most likely to occur for households that have lower wealth, lower earnings or are renters.
26:630:58607:26:26:72:237:320:117:Times:117:Times:E.  Other Functional Forms for Wealth
26:631:58644:26:25:108:521:294:117:Times:117:Times:Appendix Table 4 provides estimates with wealth measures divided by earnings as the dependent
26:632:58737:25:26:72:308:269:117:Times:117:Times:variable.  Results are similar to those in tables 7 and 8. 
26:633:58796:26:26:108:507:243:117:Times:117:Times:Specifications of the effect of eligibility on log wealth must confront the fact that a significant
26:634:58895:26:26:72:517:217:117:Times:117:Times:minority of households have zero or negative wealth.  To address this issue, we proceed in several steps. 
26:635:59001:26:26:72:540:191:117:Times:117:Times:First, we restrict the sample to age-education-earnings groups where more than 50 percent of households have
26:636:59109:26:26:72:517:165:117:Times:117:Times:positive net financial assets and positive net wealth.  This turns out to include all age-education-earnings
26:637:59217:26:26:72:537:139:117:Times:117:Times:groups with earnings above $30,000.  These households account for at least 85 percent of all 401(k) balances
26:638:59325:26:0:72:522:113:117:Times:117:Times:(table 2) in each year.  Second, rather than exclude households in these cells that have zero or negative net
27:639:59434:0:13:72:92:150:117:Times:42:Times:       Johnson, Kitamura and Neal (2000) recently make use of this result, for example, to impute unobserved19
27:640:59544:13:25:72:340:137:117:Times:117:Times:wages for unemployed individuals in median wage regressions.
27:641:59604:25:13:72:92:112:117:Times:42:Times:       Before taking the log, we multiply the ratio of wealth to income by 50,000 to set the dependent variable20
27:642:59717:13:0:72:356:99:117:Times:117:Times:at the same order of magnitude as in the log (wealth) specification.
27:643:59787:0:26:72:507:709:117:Times:117:Times:financial assets or wealth, we instead reassign their wealth to equal 1.  By doing so, we retain valuable
27:644:59892:26:26:72:511:683:117:Times:117:Times:information about these households, but we do not alter the median wealth figures in each cell.  If all of
27:645:59998:26:26:72:529:657:117:Times:117:Times:reassigned observations lie below the regression line, the LAD coefficient estimates for the sample with the
27:646:60106:26:26:72:486:631:117:Times:117:Times:reassigned values will be exactly the same as if the zero and negative wealth values could be used
27:647:60204:26:25:72:212:605:117:Times:42:Times:(Bloomfield and Steiger 1983).    In theory, the standard deviations of the coefficient estimates will be the19
27:648:60315:25:26:72:524:580:117:Times:117:Times:same as well.  However, in the presence of non-continuous variables, such as the indicator variables in our
27:649:60422:26:26:72:532:554:117:Times:117:Times:regression, the standard deviations of the coefficients can vary in an apparently unbiased way.  Third, to test
27:650:60533:26:26:72:532:528:117:Times:117:Times:the empirical effects of this transformation, we re-estimated the specifications in table 7 using wealth levels,
27:651:60645:26:26:72:523:502:117:Times:117:Times:but reassigning all negative and zero values of the dependent variables to 1.  This procedure generated the
27:652:60752:26:26:72:527:476:117:Times:117:Times:numerically identical set of estimated coefficients with standard deviations of the estimates that were about
27:653:60861:26:26:72:152:450:117:Times:117:Times:50 percent larger.  
27:654:60881:26:26:107:518:424:117:Times:117:Times:Appendix table 5 presents estimates of the model using a log transformation of the wealth level. 
27:655:60978:26:26:72:534:398:117:Times:117:Times:Table 9 estimates the model with the dependent variable being a log transformation of the wealth to earnings
27:656:61086:26:26:72:101:372:117:Times:42:Times:ratio.     The results in the latter two tables are similar and we will focus on the estimates in table 9 using log20
27:657:61203:26:26:72:152:346:117:Times:117:Times:(wealth/earnings). 
27:658:61222:26:26:107:533:320:117:Times:117:Times:For the whole sample with earnings above $30,000, focusing on the analytical standard errors, table
27:659:61321:26:26:71:528:294:117:Times:117:Times:9 shows a sizable effect of eligibility on financial assets for households with earnings between $30,000 and
27:660:61429:26:25:71:514:268:117:Times:117:Times:$40,000, but no significant effects for the higher income groups.   The results also suggest a significant,
27:661:61536:25:26:71:533:243:117:Times:117:Times:albeit much smaller, increase for wealth for those earning between $30,000 and $40,000.   Effects on wealth
27:662:61643:26:26:71:511:217:117:Times:117:Times:are positive but not significant for those with earnings between $40,000 and $75,000, and negative and
27:663:61745:26:0:71:538:191:117:Times:117:Times:insignificant for the highest earning group.  The hypothesis that the impact on wealth in the top three earnings
28:664:61859:0:26:71:308:709:117:Times:117:Times:groups is zero cannot be rejected at conventional levels.
28:665:61916:26:26:107:500:683:117:Times:117:Times:Analysis on sub-samples of households that have enough wealth to be considered for the log
28:666:62006:26:26:71:539:657:117:Times:117:Times:specification greatly reduces the impact of 401(k) eligibility.  Recall that for the whole group earning between
28:667:62118:26:26:71:532:631:117:Times:117:Times:$30,000 and $40,000, eligibility was estimated to raise wealth by 24 percent.  However, among IRA holders
28:668:62223:26:25:71:527:605:117:Times:117:Times:in that group, the effect falls to 0.6 percent and for homeowners the effect falls to 3.7 percent.  In neither of
28:669:62336:25:26:71:517:580:117:Times:117:Times:the latter two cases is the effect significant.  For the higher-income groups with IRAs or with a home, the
28:670:62443:26:26:71:502:554:117:Times:117:Times:effects are generally small and not different from zero.  Thus, results using log wealth/earnings as the
28:671:62547:26:26:71:522:528:117:Times:117:Times:dependent variable suggest an even smaller impact of 401(k) eligibility on wealth than do the wealth level
28:672:62653:26:52:71:122:502:117:Times:117:Times:regressions.
28:673:62665:52:26:71:124:450:117:Times:117:Times:V.  Dilution
28:674:62677:26:26:108:524:424:117:Times:117:Times:A crucial issue for interpreting these results and earlier results in the literature is whether and how
28:675:62780:26:26:72:515:398:117:Times:117:Times:average tastes for saving shifted over time for different groups.  Note that this is an effort to estimate an
28:676:62889:26:26:72:493:372:117:Times:117:Times:unobserved variable that changes over time, and thus may prove difficult.   In addition, the relevant
28:677:62990:26:26:72:539:346:117:Times:117:Times:comparison groups depend on the underlying specification.  For regressions using samples of eligible families
28:678:63099:26:26:72:502:320:117:Times:117:Times:over time, such as the second test in table 4, the key issue is whether average tastes for saving among
28:679:63202:26:26:72:518:294:117:Times:117:Times:eligibles fell.  For tests comparing samples of eligible and ineligible families, such as the third and fourth
28:680:63312:26:25:72:508:268:117:Times:117:Times:tests in table 4, the key issue is whether average tastes for saving fell over time for eligibles relative to
28:681:63421:25:26:72:531:243:117:Times:117:Times:ineligibles.  For the tests conducted in this paper, the key issue is whether average tastes for saving fell over
28:682:63534:26:26:72:343:217:117:Times:117:Times:time for eligibles relative to ineligibles within earnings groups.
28:683:63600:26:26:72:295:191:117:Times:117:Times:A.  Dilution Among Eligible Households Over Time
28:684:63648:26:26:108:526:165:117:Times:117:Times:Because of the rapid expansion of 401(k) eligibility in the 1980s, Bernheim (1997) argues that the
28:685:63746:26:26:71:521:139:117:Times:117:Times:sample of eligible households likely had declines in average taste for saving over time.  He argues that the
28:686:63854:26:0:71:520:113:117:Times:117:Times:most committed savers were likely to be the first to be eligible for such plans, and over time an increasing
29:687:63964:0:26:71:527:709:117:Times:117:Times:number of less committed savers became eligible, reducing average tastes for saving among eligibles.  This
29:688:64070:26:26:71:527:683:117:Times:117:Times:presents a prima facie case in favor of dilution among eligibles, but other factors need to be considered too.
29:689:64180:26:26:107:540:657:117:Times:117:Times:For example, Ippolito (1993) posits that one reason 401(k) plans have become so popular is that they
29:690:64280:26:26:71:528:631:117:Times:117:Times:help firms attract good workers.  Ippolito presents theory and evidence that workers with low discount rates
29:691:64388:26:25:71:536:605:117:Times:117:Times:(high tastes for saving) are likely to be more productive, but may be difficult to identify.  A 401(k) plan helps
29:692:64501:25:26:71:525:580:117:Times:117:Times:solve this problem in several ways.  First, by providing employer matching, the firm is able to pay workers
29:693:64608:26:26:71:522:554:117:Times:117:Times:who are willing to save more than those who are not.  This will prove relatively more attractive to workers
29:694:64715:26:26:71:516:528:117:Times:117:Times:with high tastes for saving and thus will help attract and retain such workers.  Second, workers with high
29:695:64821:26:26:71:529:502:117:Times:117:Times:discount rates (or low tastes for saving) will be able to access the cash in their account if they quit the firm. 
29:696:64935:26:26:71:532:476:117:Times:117:Times:This will encourage such workers to leave.  The Ippolito model suggests that over time, holding constant the
29:697:65043:26:26:71:525:450:117:Times:117:Times:pool of firms that offer 401(k)s, the eligible sample should become less diluted--that is, that average tastes
29:698:65153:26:26:71:524:424:117:Times:117:Times:for saving should rise among eligibles.   Of course, as Bernheim emphasizes, the pool of firms that offered
29:699:65260:26:26:71:533:398:117:Times:117:Times:401(k)s expanded rapidly, which could cause dilution among eligibles over time.  The net effect of these two
29:700:65368:26:26:71:194:372:117:Times:117:Times:factors is difficult to discern.
29:701:65400:26:26:107:541:346:117:Times:117:Times:Some evidence can be obtained from the fact that 401(k) participation rates, conditional on eligibility 
29:702:65504:26:26:71:512:320:117:Times:117:Times:and employer matching, rose over time.  The opposite would be expected if the sample of eligibles were
29:703:65606:26:25:71:499:294:117:Times:117:Times:becoming diluted.  Table 1 shows that participation rates, conditional on eligibility, in the SIPP have
29:704:65709:25:26:71:514:269:117:Times:117:Times:increased over time.  But recall that participation is defined in the SIPP as having a positive balance, not
29:705:65817:26:26:71:431:243:117:Times:117:Times:actively making a contribution.  So, even with dilution, this rate could rise over time.
29:706:65905:26:26:107:515:217:117:Times:117:Times:More compelling evidence comes from the Current Population Survey (CPS) for 1988 to 1993. 
29:707:65995:26:26:71:515:191:117:Times:117:Times:The CPS data are important because participation can be defined as making a contribution in the current
29:708:66098:26:26:71:520:165:117:Times:117:Times:period.  Using this definition, one would not expect conditional participation rates to rise, if the sample of
29:709:66208:26:26:71:526:139:117:Times:117:Times:eligibles were becoming more diluted.   But table 10 shows that among eligible workers, participation rates
29:710:66315:26:0:71:392:113:117:Times:117:Times:rose from 1988 to 1993 in all earnings groups, and by substantial amounts.
30:711:66389:0:13:72:92:177:117:Times:42:Times:       There are, of course, other possibilities for why participation rose even though the sample became more21
30:712:66501:13:13:72:507:164:117:Times:117:Times:diluted, but none seems convincing.  For example, employers could have responded in other ways than
30:713:66600:13:13:71:527:151:117:Times:117:Times:matching, such as financial education.  But Bernheim and Garrett (1995) note that the big push in financial
30:714:66707:13:13:72:506:138:117:Times:117:Times:education did not even begin until the early 1990s and that it covered only a fraction of employers and
30:715:66810:13:13:71:526:125:117:Times:117:Times:employees by the early 1990s.   In addition, 401(k) participation could have risen because the stock market
30:716:66917:13:13:71:538:112:117:Times:117:Times:became more popular during this period, but if that were the case, one would have expected IRA participation
30:717:67025:13:0:71:179:99:117:Times:117:Times:to rise, too, but it did not.
30:718:67056:0:26:108:511:709:117:Times:117:Times:Bernheim (1999) notes that participation may have increased because of the tightening of non-
30:719:67149:26:26:72:536:683:117:Times:117:Times:discrimination rules in the late 1980s, and that an effective way for employers to meet the tighter rules was to
30:720:67261:26:26:72:539:657:117:Times:117:Times:provide matching contributions.  However, table 10 also shows that participation rates rose among employees
30:721:67368:26:26:72:493:631:117:Times:117:Times:who did not receive a matching contribution.  In addition, if matching were being used to meet non-
30:722:67467:26:25:72:516:605:117:Times:117:Times:discrimination rules, one would expect participation to rise more rapidly among low-earners than among
30:723:67569:25:26:72:507:580:117:Times:117:Times:high-earners.  Table 10, however, shows that the increase in participation rates was higher for workers
30:724:67672:26:26:72:530:554:117:Times:117:Times:earning $30,000-$75,000 than for workers earning less than $30,000.  This difference is even larger among
30:725:67777:26:26:72:520:528:117:Times:117:Times:firms that matched.  Adding controls for pension status, and thus changes in coverage over time, does not
30:726:67882:26:26:72:538:502:117:Times:117:Times:affect these findings.  Alternatively, eligibles could be participating at a higher rate, but  participants could be
30:727:67998:26:26:72:510:476:117:Times:117:Times:contributing less on average.  In fact, however, table 11 shows that in almost all earnings and matching
30:728:68102:26:26:72:347:450:117:Times:42:Times:categories, participants contributed more in 1993 than in 1988.21
30:729:68167:26:26:72:367:424:117:Times:117:Times:B.  Dilution of Eligible Households Relative to Ineligible Households
30:730:68236:26:26:108:535:398:117:Times:117:Times:If average tastes for saving fell among eligibles, but fell by the same amount among ineligibles, then
30:731:68338:26:26:72:529:372:117:Times:117:Times:there would be no net bias from dilution issues.  This could occur if the workers who became newly eligible
30:732:68445:26:26:72:509:346:117:Times:117:Times:for 401(k)s over time had higher than average tastes for saving among ineligibles, or if those who were
30:733:68548:26:26:72:481:320:117:Times:117:Times:eligible but became ineligible had lower than average tastes for saving among eligible workers.  
30:734:68645:26:26:108:512:294:117:Times:117:Times:Evidence on dilution of eligibles relative to ineligibles as a group can be gleaned from different
30:735:68743:26:25:72:530:268:117:Times:117:Times:sources.  First, job-leavers tend to cash out their 401(k) balances and thus leave the pool of eligible workers
30:736:68854:25:26:72:526:243:117:Times:117:Times:(Burman, Coe and Gale 1999).  Job-stayers tend to be savers.  For example, Even and MacPherson (1999)
30:737:68955:26:0:72:526:217:117:Times:117:Times:find that workers who are more likely to participate in 401(k)s conditional on eligibility--that is, those with
31:738:69068:0:26:71:514:709:117:Times:117:Times:higher tastes for saving--are also more likely to be “stayers” on the job--that is, to have long job tenure. 
31:739:69177:26:26:72:531:683:117:Times:117:Times:These results suggest that over time, those with higher tastes for saving are attracted to 401(k)s, while those
31:740:69288:26:26:72:351:657:117:Times:117:Times:with lower tastes tend to drop out of the pool of eligible workers. 
31:741:69356:26:26:108:539:631:117:Times:117:Times:Second, Pence (2000) provides data on self-reported motives for saving among eligible and ineligible
31:742:69456:26:25:72:499:605:117:Times:117:Times:households in the Survey of Consumer Finances from 1989 to 1995.  These results show a decline in
31:743:69553:25:26:72:521:580:117:Times:117:Times:propensities to save for eligibles relative to ineligibles for some saving categories and an increase in other
31:744:69663:26:26:72:538:554:117:Times:117:Times:saving categories.  On balance, motives for saving do not appear to have changed very much for eligibles as a
31:745:69772:26:26:72:540:528:117:Times:117:Times:group compared to ineligibles over the sample period.   This is consistent with no dilution having occurred for
31:746:69883:26:26:72:296:502:117:Times:117:Times:eligibles as a group relative to ineligibles as a group.
31:747:69939:26:26:72:375:476:117:Times:117:Times:C.  Dilution of Eligibles Relative to Ineligibles within Earnings Groups
31:748:70011:26:26:108:517:450:117:Times:117:Times:The most important dilution issue for our purposes is whether average tastes for saving declined
31:749:70107:26:26:72:529:424:117:Times:117:Times:among eligibles relative to ineligibles within the same earnings classes.  There is little evidence on which to
31:750:70218:26:26:72:502:398:117:Times:117:Times:base such a judgment.  Table 3 does show that, within earnings classes, the relative values of age and
31:751:70320:26:26:72:519:372:117:Times:117:Times:education are very similar at a point in time for eligibles and ineligibles and do not change relative values
31:752:70429:26:26:72:534:346:117:Times:117:Times:over time.  To the extent that tastes for saving are correlated with these factors, there is little evidence of any
31:753:70544:26:26:72:426:320:117:Times:117:Times:shift in tastes for saving between eligibles and ineligibles, controlling for earnings. 
31:754:70632:26:26:108:522:294:117:Times:117:Times:A more difficult hypothesis to judge is, loosely, that eligible workers have “good jobs,” ineligible
31:755:70732:26:25:72:513:268:117:Times:117:Times:workers have “bad jobs” and that over the time period in question good jobs got better and bad jobs got
31:756:70835:25:26:72:533:243:117:Times:117:Times:worse.  This possibility merits several comments, though.  First, the regressions already control for earnings,
31:757:70946:26:26:72:524:217:117:Times:117:Times:age, education, and non-401(k) pension coverage.   Second, regressions that control additionally for health
31:758:71053:26:26:72:514:191:117:Times:117:Times:insurance coverage and for industry and occupation generate similar results.  Thus, in order to affect our
31:759:71159:26:26:72:514:165:117:Times:117:Times:results, any change in prospects for good and bad jobs would have to go beyond the change in prospects
31:760:71261:26:26:72:507:139:117:Times:117:Times:implied by all of these observable criteria.  Third, a dominant feature of “bad jobs” is the lack of wage
31:761:71366:26:0:72:521:113:117:Times:117:Times:growth, but average age-earnings profiles look very similar for eligibles and ineligibles in the 1991 cross-
32:762:71476:0:26:71:533:709:117:Times:117:Times:section.  These estimates do not follow individuals over time, but there is nevertheless no evidence that older
32:763:71587:26:26:71:537:683:117:Times:117:Times:ineligible workers are doing worse relative to younger ineligible workers than older eligible workers are doing
32:764:71698:26:26:71:521:657:117:Times:117:Times:compared to younger eligible workers.  Finally, the impact of having a good job get better or a bad job get
32:765:71805:26:26:71:533:631:117:Times:117:Times:worse can change saving in different ways, depending on whether the change was anticipated, expected to be
32:766:71911:26:25:71:511:605:117:Times:117:Times:permanent and other factors.  Thus, even if the job dichotomy view is correct, it is difficult to formulate
32:767:72018:25:26:71:232:580:117:Times:117:Times:unambiguous implications for saving.
32:768:72054:26:26:71:227:554:117:Times:117:Times:D.  Evidence from IRA participation
32:769:72089:26:26:108:527:528:117:Times:117:Times:Bernheim (1999) argues that changes in the propensity to hold IRAs between 1987 and 1991 are a
32:770:72183:26:26:72:540:502:117:Times:117:Times:good indicator of the extent of dilution because IRA ownership is a stable indicator of tastes for saving during
32:771:72295:26:26:72:514:476:117:Times:117:Times:that period.  Thus, to test for dilution, we estimate three separate probits.  The first examines all eligible
32:772:72405:26:26:72:493:450:117:Times:117:Times:households in 1987 and 1991, with a right hand side specification the same as in (2).  This shows a
32:773:72504:26:26:72:510:424:117:Times:117:Times:statistically significant decline in IRA participation among eligibles between 1987 and 1991 of about 5
32:774:72607:26:26:72:490:398:117:Times:117:Times:percentage points, and under Bernheim’s argument, is evidence of dilution of the eligible sample.  
32:775:72706:26:26:107:539:372:117:Times:117:Times:The second probit examines all households in 1987 and 1991 and uses a right hand side specification
32:776:72805:26:26:71:466:346:117:Times:42:Times:like (6), but allows for only one year-effect for eligibles and ineligibles (that is, it sets *=* for all k and EkE
32:777:72920:26:26:72:96:320:85:g_d0_f209R:42:Times:*=* for all k).  The result implies that eligibles as a group were only 1.8 percentage points less likely toIkI
32:778:73031:26:25:72:494:294:117:Times:117:Times:hold an IRA in 1991 than 1987, compared to the change for ineligibles.  Moreover, the effect is not
32:779:73130:25:26:72:528:269:117:Times:117:Times:significant (t=1.3).  This suggests that the case for dilution of eligibles relative to ineligibles is significantly
32:780:73246:26:26:72:398:243:117:Times:117:Times:weaker than the case for dilution of the overall sample of eligibles over time.
32:781:73325:26:26:108:530:217:117:Times:117:Times:The third probit examines all households in 1987 and 1991 and uses a right hand side specification
32:782:73423:26:26:72:502:191:117:Times:117:Times:like (6), allowing the change in probability of IRA ownership to vary across time, earnings class, and
32:783:73525:26:26:72:518:165:117:Times:117:Times:eligibility status.  None of the six estimated coefficients are significantly different from zero, and two are
32:784:73635:26:26:72:538:139:117:Times:117:Times:actually positive.  This suggests that the case that there is dilution within earnings classes is even weaker than
32:785:73749:26:0:72:339:113:117:Times:117:Times:the case that there is dilution of eligibles relative to ineligibles.
33:786:73820:0:26:71:141:709:117:Times:117:Times:VI.  Extensions
33:787:73835:26:26:72:173:683:117:Times:117:Times:A.  Sensitivity Analysis
33:788:73859:26:26:108:535:657:117:Times:117:Times:The models estimated above extend the existing literature in many ways, but can in turn be extended
33:789:73958:26:26:72:532:631:117:Times:117:Times:further.  In this section, we discuss a variety of alternative specifications.  All were carried out relative to the
33:790:74074:26:25:72:539:605:117:Times:117:Times:basic specification in table 7.  The first was to measure the effect of 401(k) eligibility on wealth measures less
33:791:74188:25:26:72:526:580:117:Times:117:Times:401(k) wealth rather than on wealth less  saving incentive balances.  This hardly changed the results at all. 
33:792:74298:26:26:72:531:554:117:Times:117:Times:The second was to approximate employer matching contributions, which really should be considered as part
33:793:74402:26:26:72:517:528:117:Times:117:Times:of wages, by raising the earnings of all participants by 5 percent.  This also had virtually no effect on the
33:794:74511:26:26:72:527:502:117:Times:117:Times:outcomes, in part because wages were raised for participants in both 1987 and 1991, so the difference over
33:795:74617:26:26:72:499:476:117:Times:117:Times:time tended to wash out.  Estimates using the 25th and 75th percentiles rather than the medians were
33:796:74717:26:26:72:386:450:117:Times:117:Times:consistent with the results in the paper, but had low levels of significance.
33:797:74794:26:26:108:508:424:117:Times:117:Times:Somewhat surprisingly, four additional and rather disparate alternative specifications all had a
33:798:74890:26:26:71:539:398:117:Times:117:Times:common effect.  The four specifications were as follows. (a) Limit the top earnings group to those who earned
33:799:74999:26:26:71:499:372:117:Times:117:Times:less than $110,000, in case outliers were driving the results for this group; (b) Restrict the sample to
33:800:75103:26:26:71:524:346:117:Times:117:Times:households that were aged 25-59 rather than 25-64 in each sample year, to reduce any problems with early
33:801:75207:26:26:71:535:320:117:Times:117:Times:retirement and because this age group faces early withdrawal penalties; (c) Restrict the sample to households
33:802:75316:26:25:71:520:294:117:Times:117:Times:that were aged 25-59 in 1987 and 29-64 in 1991, in order to follow the same age cohorts over time.  This
33:803:75420:25:26:71:530:269:117:Times:117:Times:regression controlled for age-in-1987 rather than current age.  (d) Add the self-employed into the sample, to
33:804:75529:26:26:71:533:243:117:Times:117:Times:account for possible differences in shifting employment patterns between eligibles and ineligibles over time. 
33:805:75639:26:26:71:534:217:117:Times:117:Times:The common effect was to make the coefficient on the highest earnings group in the financial assets equation
33:806:75747:26:26:71:537:191:117:Times:117:Times:positive, large and significant (about the same size as the coefficient for the $50,000-$75,000 indicator in the
33:807:75859:26:26:71:524:165:117:Times:117:Times:first row of table 7).  None of the coefficients in the other equations changed significantly, however, so the
33:808:75969:26:26:71:227:139:117:Times:117:Times:overall conclusions remain the same.
33:809:76005:26:0:107:534:113:117:Times:117:Times:We also considered expanding the sample to include SIPP data from either 1984 or 1993.  However,
34:810:76101:0:13:72:92:125:117:Times:42:Times:       It is also possible that firms dropped their defined benefit plans altogether and replaced them with22
34:811:76210:13:13:72:525:112:117:Times:117:Times:401(k)s.  See Papke (1999).  In the SIPP data, however, non-401(k) pension coverage rates did not change
34:812:76314:13:0:71:371:99:117:Times:117:Times:significantly for eligibles relative to ineligibles over the sample period.
34:813:76391:0:26:71:509:709:117:Times:117:Times:the 1984 data lack information on 401(k) balances.  This would permit estimates of non-401(k) wealth
34:814:76491:26:26:71:528:683:117:Times:117:Times:measures, as in Poterba, Venti and Wise (1995) and Engen and Gale  (1997), but such estimates  cannot be
34:815:76595:26:26:71:514:657:117:Times:117:Times:conclusive.  The absence of a significant negative coefficient on the eligibility term would not prove that
34:816:76702:26:26:71:516:631:117:Times:117:Times:401(k)s do not raise saving, and the presence of a significant negative coefficient would not demonstrate
34:817:76807:26:25:71:539:605:117:Times:117:Times:much in the way of substitution.  Tables 6 and 7 above demonstrate these facts for the 1987-91 period.  In the
34:818:76917:25:26:71:522:580:117:Times:117:Times:1993 SIPP, the 401(k) participation rate, conditional on eligibility, is lower than in 1991.  However, other
34:819:77025:26:26:71:507:554:117:Times:117:Times:data sources including the Surveys of Consumer Finances, the Form 5500s and the Current Population
34:820:77123:26:26:71:380:528:117:Times:117:Times:Surveys suggest the conditional participation rate should have increased.
34:821:77196:26:26:71:114:502:117:Times:117:Times:B.  Biases
34:822:77206:26:26:108:516:476:117:Times:117:Times:At least two items may bias our results toward overstating the effects of 401(k) plans on private
34:823:77303:26:26:72:526:450:117:Times:117:Times:saving.  First, there is some evidence that firms in the 1980s used 401(k) plans as pension replacements on
34:824:77410:26:26:72:540:424:117:Times:117:Times:the margin (see Gale, Papke, and VanDerhei 2000).  That is, firms stopped improving or “froze” their defined
34:825:77518:26:26:72:524:398:117:Times:117:Times:benefit pension plans and poured marginal pension resources into 401(k) plans instead.  To the extent that
34:826:77624:26:26:72:508:372:117:Times:117:Times:this occurred, 401(k) eligible households would have incurred a reduction in wealth, but one that is not
34:827:77728:26:26:72:508:346:117:Times:117:Times:observable in the SIPP, because the SIPP does not have information on the value of accumulated (non-
34:828:77828:26:26:72:296:320:117:Times:42:Times:401(k)) pension rights among working households.22
34:829:77878:26:25:108:536:294:117:Times:117:Times:Second, table 2 shows that about 70 percent of 401(k) balances in the SIPP are held by families with
34:830:77978:25:26:72:516:269:117:Times:117:Times:earnings above $40,000 and our results suggest that these balances do not represent new private saving. 
34:831:78082:26:26:72:532:243:117:Times:117:Times:However, recall that wealthy households are under represented in the SIPP.  We extracted a sample from the
34:832:78188:26:26:72:517:217:117:Times:117:Times:1995 Survey of Consumer Finances, consisting of employed households, with no one self-employed, and
34:833:78287:26:26:72:531:191:117:Times:117:Times:where the head was between the ages of 25 and 64.  In that sample, 80 percent of 401(k) balances were held
34:834:78393:26:0:72:528:165:117:Times:117:Times:by households with earnings above $50,000 (in 1991 dollars) and 89 percent were held by households with
35:835:78498:0:26:71:524:709:117:Times:117:Times:earnings above $40,000.  If the SIPP understates the proportion of 401(k) balances held by higher-earning
35:836:78603:26:52:72:404:683:117:Times:117:Times:households, our results may overstate the impact of 401(k)s on private saving.
35:837:78681:52:26:72:150:631:117:Times:117:Times:VII.  Conclusion 
35:838:78697:26:26:108:530:605:117:Times:117:Times:The impact of 401(k) plans on household wealth is a crucial issue for both academic analysis of the
35:839:78796:26:26:71:521:579:117:Times:117:Times:determinants of saving and public policy discussions concerning retirement income.  This paper addresses
35:840:78900:26:26:71:531:553:117:Times:117:Times:conceptual and econometric problems that have arisen in previous work on 401(k)s and wealth and provides
35:841:79004:26:26:71:534:527:117:Times:117:Times:new estimates.  We make two principal adjustments in our model relative to the previous literature.  The first
35:842:79114:26:26:71:509:501:117:Times:117:Times:is to allow the effects of 401(k)s to vary by earnings class over time.  The second is to estimate using a
35:843:79220:26:26:71:516:475:117:Times:117:Times:variety of functional forms for the dependent variable that are more consistent with theory,  are robust to
35:844:79327:26:25:71:536:449:117:Times:117:Times:differences in initial asset position, and are robust to economy-wide effects that raise or lower all asset values
35:845:79441:25:26:71:347:424:117:Times:117:Times:proportionately, or have different effects across earnings classes.
35:846:79508:26:26:107:528:398:117:Times:117:Times:Several different tests suggest that the impact of 401(k) eligibility over time varies significantly by
35:847:79611:26:26:71:526:372:117:Times:117:Times:earnings class; that during the sample period at least two-thirds of 401(k) balances accrue to households in
35:848:79719:26:26:71:525:346:117:Times:117:Times:groups where 401(k) eligibility is not associated with higher wealth for eligibles relative to ineligibles; and
35:849:79830:26:26:71:531:320:117:Times:117:Times:that it is the households that have low earnings or low wealth for whom 401(k)s may tend to be net saving.  
35:850:79938:26:26:71:528:294:117:Times:117:Times:The results for low earners, however, are generally much less significant when using the bootstrap standard
35:851:80045:26:26:71:527:268:117:Times:117:Times:errors.  Our  estimates are robust, however, across different functional forms for the dependent variable.  In
35:852:80155:26:26:71:525:242:117:Times:117:Times:addition, the same general results emerge when estimating on the sample as a whole as when estimating on
35:853:80259:26:26:71:353:216:117:Times:117:Times:various sub-groups and aggregating to obtain the overall estimate.
35:854:80325:26:26:107:534:190:117:Times:117:Times:If we rely on our estimated analytical standard errors, then our estimates on the overall proportion of
35:855:80428:26:26:71:523:164:117:Times:117:Times:401(k)s that represent net private saving are substantially below those of Poterba, Venti and Wise (1995),
35:856:80534:26:25:71:523:138:117:Times:117:Times:who find no reduction in other private wealth due to 401(k)s.  If we rely on bootstrap standard errors, then
35:857:80642:25:0:71:522:113:117:Times:117:Times:our results are not much larger than our earlier estimates in Engen and Gale (1997).  Note that all of these
36:858:80752:0:26:71:510:709:117:Times:117:Times:results overstate the effects of 401(k) eligibility on national saving, because they do not account for the
36:859:80859:26:26:71:180:683:117:Times:117:Times:attendant loss of revenue.
36:860:80885:26:26:107:531:657:117:Times:117:Times: Our findings are also similar to some of the results in Benjamin (2000).  Benjamin uses propensity
36:861:80984:26:26:71:532:631:117:Times:117:Times:score methods to control for tastes for saving and finds that, among homeowners and households with IRAs,
36:862:81089:26:25:71:524:605:117:Times:117:Times:there is no effect of 401(k)s on national saving, but positive effects of 401(k) eligibility among renters and
36:863:81199:25:26:71:527:580:117:Times:117:Times:households without IRAs.  Aggregating these estimates would suggest small overall impact of 401(k)s, but
36:864:81303:26:26:71:403:554:117:Times:117:Times:his estimates using the overall sample show a somewhat larger positive effect.
36:865:81381:26:26:107:539:528:117:Times:117:Times:The empirical finding that saving incentives may be more likely to raise saving for low earners or low
36:866:81483:26:26:71:509:502:117:Times:117:Times:savers is consistent with a variety of other results in the literature.  Gale and Scholz (1994) find similar
36:867:81591:26:26:71:513:476:117:Times:117:Times:results for IRAs, and Gale (1998) finds similar results for employer-provided pensions.  In addition, the
36:868:81696:26:26:71:516:450:117:Times:117:Times:mechanism whereby saving incentives might have positive effects on private saving for lower-earning or
36:869:81798:26:26:71:523:424:117:Times:117:Times:lower-saving households but not for higher earners is worth exploring.  One possibility is that low-income
36:870:81904:26:26:71:539:398:117:Times:117:Times:households do not hold much in the way of stocks (Carney and Gale 1999, Poterba and Samwick 1999).  This
36:871:82008:26:26:71:535:372:117:Times:117:Times:is not terribly surprising given the information and transactions costs, but it may be that 401(k)s raise saving
36:872:82120:26:26:71:520:346:117:Times:117:Times:for this group by providing cheap access to the stock market.  Another possibility, exemplified by models
36:873:82225:26:26:71:527:320:117:Times:117:Times:developed in Samwick (1995) and others is tax-preferred, but illiquid retirement saving is a poor substitute
36:874:82333:26:25:71:529:294:117:Times:117:Times:for other saving for households with little wealth who need the saving for precautionary reasons.  If so, then
36:875:82443:25:26:71:531:269:117:Times:117:Times:to the extent that low earning households do contribute to such plans, the contributions are more likely to be
36:876:82553:26:26:71:514:243:117:Times:117:Times:new saving.  A third possibility is simply that higher earners or high-saving households are simply more
36:877:82657:26:26:71:510:217:117:Times:117:Times:economically sophisticated and hence have both the resources and the wherewithal to take advantage of
36:878:82758:26:26:71:495:191:117:Times:117:Times:sheltering strategies that allow them to capture the tax benefits of 401(k)s without sacrificing living
36:879:82861:26:26:71:115:165:117:Times:117:Times:standards.
36:880:82871:26:26:107:524:139:117:Times:117:Times:Finally, as we have emphasized in earlier papers (Engen and Gale 1995, 1997), our findings point
36:881:82967:26:0:71:539:113:117:Times:117:Times:toward potentially important links between housing equity and financial assets in determining the adequacy of
37:882:83078:0:26:71:531:709:117:Times:117:Times:saving for retirement.   This result is consistent with findings in Poterba and Samwick (1997, page 25), who
37:883:83186:26:26:71:525:683:117:Times:117:Times:conclude that debt and borrowing behavior are important factors in understanding financial preparation for
37:884:83292:26:0:71:403:657:117:Times:117:Times:retirement,  and these links deserve further scrutiny on the part of economists.
