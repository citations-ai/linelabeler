2:25:487:28:20:72:526:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: The literature concerning the effect of tariffs on the inter-industry wage premium has 
2:26:574:20:21:72:526:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:not  addressed the  role  of  total  factor  productivity (TFP) in  determining  both the wage 
2:27:667:21:21:72:526:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:premium  and  tariffs. This omission  invalidates  the  use  of  the  pre-reform  tariff  level  as  an 
2:28:770:21:21:72:526:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:instrument  for  the  change  in  tariffs. Based  on  an  analysis  of Colombian  data,  I  find  that 
2:29:873:21:20:72:526:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:including TFP in the estimated model of the effects of tariffs on the wage premium leads to a 
2:30:966:20:21:72:526:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:36% decrease in the effect of tariffs on the inter-industry wage premium relative to the model 
2:31:1061:21:21:72:525:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that omits TFP. More specifically, a ten percentage point decrease in tariffs reduces the wage 
2:32:1154:21:20:72:526:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:premium  by 1.1%. This  finding  suggests  the  importance  of  using  policies  that  boost 
2:33:1246:20:21:72:379:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:productivity to offset the effect of tariffs on the wage premium.

3:39:1434:20:28:72:75:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
3:40:1434:28:27:72:526:710:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: Recent experience   with trade   liberalization in   developing   countries has raised 
3:41:1520:27:28:72:526:683:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:concerns about the impact of trade liberalization on wage inequality. In particular, there have 
3:42:1616:28:27:72:523:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:been concerns about changes in labor market outcomes such as returns to skills and the inter-
3:43:1709:27:28:72:526:628:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:industry  wage  premium  (hereafter  called  the  wage  premium),  which  is  the  part  of  the  wage 
3:44:1812:28:28:72:526:600:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:that is explained by the characteristics of the worker’s industry of affiliation (after controlling 
3:45:1912:28:27:72:526:572:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:for the worker’s characteristics). The empirical evidence provided by Gonzaga et al. (2005) 
3:46:2004:27:28:72:526:545:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:for  Brazil,  Cragg  and  Epelbaum  (1996)  for  Mexico,  Galiani  and  Sanguinetti  (2003)  for 
3:47:2101:28:27:72:526:517:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Argentina, and Attanasio et al. (2004) for Colombia suggests that the observed changes in the 
3:48:2195:27:28:72:526:490:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:skill  premium  (another  way  of  expressing  returns  to  skills)  do  not  entirely  explain  the 
3:49:2296:28:28:72:526:462:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:increase  in  wage  inequality.1 As  a  result,  some  researchers  started  to  explore  the  idea  that 
3:50:2401:28:27:72:526:434:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:trade  policy  may  affect  wage  inequality  through  other  channels  such  as  the  wage  premium. 
3:51:2503:27:28:72:526:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:For instance, changes in the wage premium can result in increased inequality if, as a result of 
3:52:2599:28:27:72:525:379:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:trade  policy  changes,  the  wage  premium  decreases  less  in  skill-intensive  industries  than  in 
3:53:2703:27:28:72:315:352:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:industries that rely primarily on unskilled workers 
3:54:2754:28:28:108:526:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The  wage  premium  has  drawn  a  lot  of  attention  in  this  context  because  the  trade 
3:55:2848:28:27:72:526:296:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:liberalization  conducted  in  countries  like  Colombia,  Mexico,  and  India  not  only  decreased 
3:56:2949:27:28:72:526:269:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:overall  protection  levels, but  also  altered  protection levels  differently across  industries. 
3:57:3049:28:28:72:526:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Interestingly, there is mixed evidence concerning the effect of tariffs on the wage premium: 
3:58:3140:28:27:72:526:213:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:no  effect  for  Mexico  (Feliciano,  2001), a positive  effect  for  Colombia  (Goldberg  and 
3:59:3235:27:28:72:435:186:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Pavcnik, 2005), and a negative effect for India (Mishra and Kumar, 2008).  
3:60:3308:28:27:72:526:158:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: A weakness of this literature is that it has ignored the role of total factor productivity 
3:61:3399:27:38:72:526:131:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(TFP) in determining both the wage premium and tariffs. Bartel and Sicherman (1999) found 
3:62:3489:38:15:72:219:93:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:                                                 
3:63:3537:15:0:72:362:78:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:1 Goldberg and Pavcnik (2007) provides a good survey of this literature. 
4:64:3609:0:28:72:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that  for  the  U.S.,  the  higher  the  industry  TFP,  the  higher  the  wage  premium  enjoyed  by  its 
4:65:3716:28:28:72:526:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:workers. In addition, Karacaovali (2011) presented evidence for Colombia that industry TFP 
4:66:3807:28:27:72:526:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  its  anticipated  future  changes  are  correlated  with  contemporaneous  import  tariffs.  This 
4:67:3910:27:28:72:526:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:means  that  the  instrument  used  for  the  change  in  tariff  level  (the  pre-reform  tariff  level)  is 
4:68:4020:28:27:72:526:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:correlated  with  the  current  TFP  level,  which  is  included  in  the  error  term.  Hence,  the 
4:69:4121:27:28:72:526:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:instrument  is  invalid  and  the  current  methodology  provides  inconsistent  estimates  of  the 
4:70:4221:28:28:72:257:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:effects of tariff on the wage premium. 
4:71:4259:28:27:108:525:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:To  address  this  weakness  in  the  current  literature,  I  use the Colombian  data  set in 
4:72:4353:27:28:72:523:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Goldberg  and  Pavcnik  (2005) to  examine  whether  trade  liberalization affects the  inter-
4:73:4446:28:27:72:526:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:industry  wage  premium  when  the  impact  of  TFP  on  trade  policy  and  on  the  wage  premium 
4:74:4546:27:28:72:526:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:has been taken into account.  I also estimate the magnitude of the bias in the Colombian case 
4:75:4640:28:28:72:387:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that is due to their failure to consider this source of endogeneity.  
4:76:4709:28:27:108:526:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:I  find  that  TFP  is  an  important  determinant  of  the  wage  premium  in  the  estimated 
4:77:4804:27:28:72:526:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:model,  with  a  10%  increase  in  TFP  implying  a  1.6%  increase  in  the  wage  premium.  The 
4:78:4903:28:27:72:526:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:estimated effect of a 10  percentage point decrease in tariffs is a 1.1% reduction in the wage 
4:79:4997:27:28:72:526:345:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:premium,  which  is  about  36%  less  than  the  result  obtained  when  TFP  is  omitted.  My 
4:80:5093:28:28:72:526:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:estimates also indicate that as an included instrument, TFP has a positive correlation with the 
4:81:5189:28:27:72:525:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:change  in  tariffs,  indicating  that  it  is  an  important  time-varying  factor  in  the  import  tariff 
4:82:5298:27:28:72:110:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:setting. 
4:83:5306:28:27:108:526:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:These  findings  are  significant  because,  according  to  Goldberg  and  Pavcnik  (2005), 
4:84:5398:27:28:72:526:207:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:industries  that  have  the  largest  share  of  unskilled  workers  suffered  the  largest  tariff  cuts, 
4:85:5505:28:28:72:526:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:which  means  that  in  principle,  trade  liberalization  increased  the  skilled-unskilled  wage 
4:86:5604:28:27:72:526:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:inequality  through  changes  in  the  wage  premium.    However,  my  results  indicate  that  there 
4:87:5706:27:28:72:526:124:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:could be a different outcome if the role of productivity were considered. Suppose these same 
4:88:5799:28:0:72:526:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:industries presented increases in TFP that were sufficiently large so as to counterbalance the 
5:89:5894:0:28:72:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:effect  of  the  tariffs,  then  inequality  would  be  reduced.  The  implication  for  policy  makers  is 
5:90:6002:28:28:72:526:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that  they  should  adopt  policies  that  boost  productivity  as  a  tool  to  reduce  the  increase  in 
5:91:6109:28:27:72:316:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:inequality that occurs through the wage premium.  
5:92:6158:27:28:72:526:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: The  remainder  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In  section  2,  I  present  a  stylized 
5:93:6260:28:27:72:526:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:model of wage premium setting and discuss the methodological problems of previous studies 
5:94:6350:27:28:72:526:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:caused  by  their  omission  of  TFP.  The data  used  in  the  empirical  analysis  are  described  in 
5:95:6453:28:28:72:526:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:section  3.  Section  4  presents  and  discusses  the  empirical  results.  Section  5  summarizes  the 
5:96:6558:28:27:72:239:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:findings and presents conclusions.

5:98:6592:28:27:72:154:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2. Methodology 
5:99:6606:27:28:108:525:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The literature (e.g. Krueger and Summers, 1988) defines the industry  wage premium 
5:100:6688:28:28:72:526:455:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:as  the share of the worker’s  wage that is  explained by the industry’s characteristics  after 
5:101:6784:28:27:72:526:427:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:controlling for the worker’s observable characteristics. Although there is no consensus, the 
5:102:6877:27:28:72:526:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:two  most  commonly  cited  reasons  for  the  existence  of  an  industry  wage  premium  are 
5:103:6972:28:27:72:525:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:different industry-level productivity levels due to industry-specific inputs, and industry rents 
5:104:7068:27:28:72:526:345:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that  arise  from  imperfect  competition  in  the  output  market.  These  industry  rents  may  be 
5:105:7169:28:28:72:526:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:affected  in  the  short  and  medium  term by  trade  liberalization,  as  discussed  in  Goldberg  and 
5:106:7273:28:27:72:526:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Pavcnik  (2005),  and  they  induce  wages  to  be  higher  than  the  market  average  due  to  rent 
5:107:7375:27:28:72:526:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:sharing, as shown by  Blanchflower et al. (1996) and Hildreth and Oswald (1997), who used 
5:108:7465:28:27:72:262:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:firm-level data for U.S. labor markets.

5:111:7547:28:27:108:526:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:To  assess  the  effects  of  trade  liberalization  on  the  wage  premium,  I  present  a 
5:112:7639:27:28:72:526:124:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:simplified  representative  firm  model  in  which  the  wage  premium  is  due  to  industry  rent 
5:113:7739:28:0:72:526:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:sharing  in  a  small  open  economy.  I  assume  that  the  capital  stock  is  fixed  in  the  short  and 
6:114:7848:0:28:72:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:medium  run,  thus  representing  a  fixed  cost  (fj).  This  assumption  is  equivalent  to  assuming 
6:115:7952:28:28:72:526:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that  capital  is  sector  specific  for  the  time  horizon  considered  here,  and  allows  for  the 
6:116:8055:28:27:72:282:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:existence of positive profits in equilibrium. 
6:117:8100:27:29:108:526:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Let pjt be the price of the good produced in industry j at time t. It is a function of the 
6:118:8189:29:29:72:526:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:import  tariff (jt) 2,  in  the  sense  that  as  the  import  tariff  decreases,  the  output  price  faced  by 
6:119:8301:29:29:72:525:618:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  domestic  representative  firm  decreases  (pjt/jt >  0).  The  profit  maximization  problem

6:128:8877:28:28:72:526:409:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:bargaining power. So, the industry wage premium received by a worker at industry j at time t

6:131:9152:28:28:72:526:323:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:demand  for  labor  back  into  equation  (1),  we  obtain  the  profit  function  as  described  by

6:152:9491:15:16:72:525:101:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:2 In a monopolistic competition framework, one can also model the increase in competitiveness induced by trade 
6:153:9601:16:11:72:525:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:liberalization as a shock to the price-elasticity of demand for output, i.e. more competitiveness results in a more 
6:154:9717:11:0:72:265:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:elastic demand, and as a result, a lower markup. 
7:155:9766:0:28:108:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The level of competitiveness is affected by trade policy through a decrease in import 
7:156:9852:28:28:72:525:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:tariffs,  which  forces  a  decrease  in  domestic  prices3,  and  implies  a  decrease  in  industry  rents

7:174:10075:28:27:72:526:631:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: The result from equation (4) relies on the  assumption that firms cannot influence the 
7:175:10162:27:28:72:526:604:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:tariff  level,  in  other  words, they  cannot  lobby  government  to  choose  a  tariff  level  that 
7:176:10264:28:28:72:526:576:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:maximize  their  profits.  In  the  next  subsection,  I  relax  this  assumption  and  explore  its 
7:177:10365:28:27:72:526:548:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:consequences  on  the  current  methodology  used  to  estimate  the  effect  of  tariffs  on  the  wage

7:181:10522:28:28:72:526:438:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: Empirically, this relationship between trade liberalization and the wage premium has 
7:182:10607:28:27:72:526:410:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:been assessed based on the fact that in several countries trade liberalization led to a decrease 
7:183:10704:27:28:72:525:383:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in  tariffs  that  was  not  uniform  across  industries.  This  changed  the  protection  pattern  across 
7:184:10811:28:27:72:526:355:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:industries,  which  can  be  used  to  identify  the  relationship  between  the  wage  premium  and 
7:185:10912:27:28:72:526:328:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:import  tariffs. Goldberg  and  Pavcnik  (2005) applied  this  methodology  to  estimate  the  effect 
7:186:11014:28:28:72:526:300:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of  tariffs  on  the wage  premium  using  data  from  the  Colombian  trade  liberalization  episode 
7:187:11116:28:28:72:321:272:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that started in the 1980s,5 as shown in equation (5): 
7:188:11168:28:59:108:512:244:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:wagepremiumjt = α+jt+δj+θt+errorjt      (5) 
7:189:11206:59:15:72:219:185:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:                                                 
7:190:11254:15:16:72:525:170:6:Times New Roman:10:g_d0_f8:F:3 Evidence that a decline in tariffs implies lower  markups  was found by Harrison (1994) for Cote d’Ivoire, 
7:191:11362:16:7:72:377:154:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:Levinsohn (1993) for Turkey, and Currie and Harrison (1997) for Morocco. 
7:192:11434:7:16:72:525:147:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:4 In  addition,  more  competition  might  change  the  bargaining  power  of  unions  and/or  shift  their  focus  from 
7:193:11554:16:11:72:525:131:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:wages  to  job  security,  hence  decreasing  their  share  of  the  industry  rents  and  therefore  reducing  the  wage 
7:194:11676:11:7:72:515:120:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:premium. But this channel is subject to the specific wage negotiation framework of each industry and country. 
7:195:11785:7:16:72:525:113:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:5 Trade liberalization  in  Colombia  started  when  President  Virgilio  Vargas  took  office  in  1986  and  was 
7:196:11899:16:12:72:525:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:completed  by  his  successor  President  Cesar  Gaviria  by  1992.  This  reform  consisted  of  a  large  decrease  in  all 
7:197:12025:12:11:72:525:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:tariffs across all industries (generating a large decrease in average tariff) and a removal of almost all non-tariff 
7:198:12142:11:0:72:107:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:barriers. 
8:199:12152:0:30:72:526:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:where jt is  the  Colombian  import  tariff  for  industry j in  year t. The  use  of industry  (δj)  and 
8:200:12257:30:28:72:526:728:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:year  (θt)  fixed  effects  makes  the  within-industry  variation the  source  of identification of , 
8:201:12360:28:28:72:419:700:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:which suggests the use of clustered standard errors at the industry level. 
8:202:12433:28:27:72:526:672:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: Changes  in  tariffs  across  industries  have  received  a  great  deal  of attention  in  the 
8:203:12529:27:28:72:526:645:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:literature  on  the  political  economy  of  trade  protection.  This  research  provides  both  a 
8:204:12628:28:28:72:526:617:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:theoretical  basis  (Grossman  and  Helpman,  1994,  and  Karacaovali,  2011)  and  empirical 
8:205:12722:28:27:72:526:589:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:support  (Trefler,  1993,  Goldberg  and  Maggi,  1999,  and  Karacaovali,  2011)  for  the  idea  that 
8:206:12826:27:28:72:526:562:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:some  characteristics  of  the  industry  (e.g.  market  concentration,  share  of  unskilled  workers) 
8:207:12930:28:27:72:526:534:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:are  taken  into  account  when  setting  tariffs.  This  means  that  if  some  of  these  characteristics 
8:208:13038:27:28:72:526:507:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:also  influence  the  wage  premium,  the  current  tariff  level  becomes  an  endogenous  variable. 
8:209:13139:28:28:72:526:479:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:For  instance,  a  higher  wage  premium  in  a  given  industry  might  induce  its  workers  to  lobby 
8:210:13244:28:27:72:526:451:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:against trade liberalization. A possible time-variant political economy factor is union activity. 
8:211:13342:27:28:72:526:424:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Fortunately,  this  does  not  appear  to  be  the  case,  based  on  anecdotal  evidence  in  Edwards 
8:212:13445:28:28:72:526:396:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(2001)  suggesting  almost  no  union  activity  in  Colombia.  Thus,  in  my  theoretical  model,  I 
8:213:13547:28:29:72:526:368:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:assume jt = j.  Time-invariant  industry  characteristics  that  affect  tariff  setting  can  be 
8:214:13646:29:27:72:416:339:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:controlled by adding industry fixed effects (δj) to the estimated model.  
8:215:13719:27:28:72:526:312:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:B: As in  many developing countries,  Colombia’s  trade reforms  were accompanied by 
8:216:13801:28:28:72:525:284:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:other  reforms.6 There  was  a labor  market  reform  in  1990  that  reduced  dismissal  costs  and 
8:217:13901:28:27:72:526:256:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:introduced  a  new  severance  payment  system.  Banking  system  reforms in  the  early 1990s 
8:218:13994:27:28:72:526:229:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:were aimed  at  liberalizing  deposit  rates,  extinguishing credit  subsidies, and  modernizing 
8:219:14088:28:27:72:526:201:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:capital  markets.  Moreover,  foreign  direct  investment  restrictions  were  greatly  reduced  in 
8:220:14188:27:28:72:526:174:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:1991, when multinational companies were basically  given the same treatment as Colombian 
8:221:14277:28:28:72:526:146:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:firms.  Finally,  in  1993, there  was  a  major  change  in  the  social  security  system. These 
8:222:14375:28:25:72:526:118:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reforms,  which  affected  all  industries  equally,  underline  the  importance  of  including  year 
8:223:14477:25:15:72:219:93:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:                                                 
8:224:14525:15:0:72:445:78:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:6 See Kugler (1999) and Eslava et al. (2004) for details about Colombia’s economic reforms. 
9:225:14612:0:28:72:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:effects (θt) in the empirical specification, which would also account for business cycle effects 
9:226:14708:28:28:72:526:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:on  both  tariff  and  wage  premium  setting. It  is  possible  that  the  reforms  affected  industries 
9:227:14813:28:27:72:423:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:differently, in which case the industry effects will capture this variation.  
9:228:14890:27:28:72:526:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: Nevertheless year and industry effects do not account for industry-level variables that 
9:229:14976:28:27:72:526:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:change over time and that affect tariffs and the wage premium simultaneously. Goldberg and 
9:230:15067:27:28:72:526:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Pavcnik  (2005) recognized this shortcoming and  suggested addressing  it  by estimating the 
9:231:15159:28:28:72:526:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:first difference of equation (5) with two-stage least squares using instruments for the change 
9:232:15254:28:27:72:119:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in tariffs. 
9:233:15265:27:28:108:526:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The  instruments they chose  are  the  1983 (pre-reform) tariff  level  and  its  interactions 
9:234:15360:28:27:72:525:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:with the exchange rate and the coffee price. The rationale for this choice is that the 1983 tariff 
9:235:15458:27:28:72:526:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:level happens to be proportional to the tariff cut at the industry level, i.e. the higher the 1983 
9:236:15557:28:28:72:526:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:tariff in a given industry, the larger the magnitude of the decrease in the tariff for this industry 
9:237:15657:28:27:72:526:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:under trade liberalization, this negative correlation is clearly depicted in Figure 1. The use of 
9:238:15755:27:28:72:526:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  interactions  of  tariffs  with the  real exchange  rate  and  coffee  prices  (the  most  important 
9:239:15861:28:27:72:526:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Colombian  export  product)  is  motivated  by  the fact that in  designing Colombia’s trade 
9:240:15953:27:28:72:526:345:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reform, trade balance levels were taken into account to prevent a Balance of Payments crisis. 
9:241:16046:28:28:72:526:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:More specifically, the idea is that exchange  rate  devaluations, which induce smaller imports 
9:242:16140:28:27:72:526:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  larger  exports,  would  lead  to a larger  decrease  in  tariffs,  and  increases  in  coffee  prices, 
9:243:16249:27:28:72:482:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:which generate larger export revenues, would also lead to a larger decrease in tariffs. 
9:244:16336:28:27:108:526:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:But there is still a problem with the strategy adopted by Goldberg and Pavcnik (2005): 
9:245:16423:27:28:72:526:207:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:it ignores  the  role of  productivity  in the  determination  of both the wage  premium  and the 
9:246:16520:28:28:72:525:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:tariff. This  is  a  problem  because  an  increase  in  industry  productivity  (TFP)  leads  to  an 
9:247:16622:28:47:72:353:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:increase in the wage premium, as shown in equation (6):7

9:249:16726:14:16:72:525:90:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:7 For example, Bartel and Sicherman (1999) found empirical evidence of a positive correlation between TFP and 
9:250:16835:16:0:72:525:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:the wage premium in the U.S. In the Colombian manufacturing industries sample used in this paper, the simple

10:264:16971:37:28:108:526:714:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:This fact alone would not pose an econometric problem if the tariff and TFP were not 
10:265:17056:28:27:72:526:686:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:correlated.  But this is clearly not the case, since  there is  a  growing literature concerning the 
10:266:17157:27:28:72:525:659:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:B:effect  of trade  liberalization  on  industry  and  firms’  productivity  levels.  In  particular,  a 
10:267:17259:28:27:72:526:631:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:decrease  in  import  tariffs  was  found  to  increase  TFP  in  Chile  (Pavcnik,  2002),  Brazil 
10:268:17358:27:28:72:526:604:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(Ferreira  and  Rossi,  2003),  India  (Krishna  and  Mitra,  1998,  and  Topalova,  2004),  and 
10:269:17455:28:28:72:224:576:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Colombia (Karacaovali, 2011). 
10:270:17484:28:27:108:526:548:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Overall,  while  on  the  one  hand  trade  liberalization  decreases  the  rents  to  be  shared 
10:271:17582:27:28:72:526:521:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  then  decreases  the  wage  premium  (direct  effect),  on  the  other  hand  trade  liberalization 
10:272:17687:28:27:72:526:493:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:may boost productivity, which increases the wage premium (indirect effect). This means that 
10:273:17779:27:28:72:526:466:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in  the  current  methodology  the  total  effect  of  trade  liberalization  on  the  wage  premium  is 
10:274:17884:28:28:72:526:438:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:ambiguous.  And  this  could  be  the  reason  behind  the  difference  in  the  sign  of  the  tariff 
10:275:17987:28:27:72:526:410:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:coefficient,  for  instance  a positive effect  for  Colombia  (Goldberg  and  Pavcnik,  2005)  and a 
10:276:18088:27:28:72:325:383:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:negative effect for India (Mishra and Kumar, 2008). 
10:277:18139:28:27:72:526:355:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: Karacaovali (2011) presents a theoretical model in which industry TFP is an important 
10:278:18223:27:28:72:526:328:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:political  economy  factor  that  affects  tariff  setting. This  is because under  the  plausible 
10:279:18320:28:28:72:526:300:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:assumption of a small price elasticity of supply, the higher the industry TFP, the greater the 
10:280:18415:28:27:72:526:272:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:benefits  from  protection that accrue  to  firms in that  industry,  and  therefore the  greater  the 
10:281:18517:27:28:72:526:245:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:incentives to lobby the government for more protection. Karacaovali (2011) further finds that 
10:282:18608:28:27:72:526:217:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in  the  context  of  a  trade  liberalization  that  is  similar  to  the  one  adopted  by  Colombia,  the 
10:283:18717:27:28:72:525:190:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:extent  of  industry-level  liberalization  (the  change  in  tariffs)  depends  positively  upon  the 
10:284:18820:28:28:72:525:162:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:change  in  its  productivity,  which  means  that  future  tariffs  may  be  influenced  by  anticipated 
10:285:18926:28:30:72:190:134:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:changes in productivity. 
10:286:18950:30:19:72:526:104:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:                                                                                                                                                        
10:287:19101:19:11:72:525:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:correlation between the  natural  logarithm of TFP and the  wage  premium  is 0.373, and the  correlation between 
10:288:19215:11:0:72:267:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:the first-difference of the same variables is 0.45. 
11:289:19268:0:28:108:526:759:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:On the empirical side, Karacaovali’s (2011) estimates using Colombian data support 
11:290:19351:28:28:72:526:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:his  theoretical  predictions.  He  examines  the  correlation  between  tariffs  and  TFP  over  time, 
11:291:19455:28:27:72:526:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and finds a statistically significant correlation between future TFP and present tariffs, and that 
11:292:19554:27:28:72:277:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:there is autocorrelation in TFP over time.8 
11:293:19597:28:27:108:526:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:From  the discussion  above,  it  is  clear that the  bias  of  the  tariff  coefficient resulting 
11:294:19695:27:28:72:526:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:from the omission of TFP should be positive, due to the positive correlation of the tariff with 
11:295:19790:28:28:72:525:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:TFP.  Once  TFP  is included in  the  estimated  model,  the  estimated  coefficient of  the  tariff 
11:296:19891:28:27:72:526:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:should decrease in magnitude. Second, the exclusion restriction for using the 1983 tariff level 
11:297:19987:27:28:72:526:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:as  an  instrument  for  tariff  changes  is  not  met.  This  is because the  pre-reform  (1983)  tariff 
11:298:20092:28:27:72:526:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:level  takes into  account  the  industry-level TFP at  that  time,  which in  turn is  correlated  with 
11:299:20195:27:28:72:525:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the current TFP level (which is part of the error term due to the omission of TFP in equation 
11:300:20287:28:28:72:526:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(5)). This  means  that  the  instrument  (1983  tariff  level)  and  the  error  term  are  correlated, 
11:301:20391:28:27:72:225:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:making the instrument invalid.  
11:302:20422:27:28:108:111:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: 
11:303:20422:28:27:72:345:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2.3 Incorporating Productivity into the Estimated Model 
11:304:20477:27:28:108:525:345:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:To address the problems described  earlier and  obtain  consistent  estimates  of  the 
11:305:20562:28:28:72:526:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:impact of tariffs on the wage premium, TFP has to be incorporated into the estimated model9. 
11:306:20652:28:28:72:526:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:This eliminates the problem of correlation between the instrument (1983 tariff level) and the 
11:307:20745:28:29:72:526:261:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:error  term. The  estimated model then  becomes  equation  (7),  where  indicates  time

11:311:20940:14:16:72:524:161:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:8 Using  Colombian  data,  Fernandes  (2007)  also  found  that  TFP  has  autocorrelation,  with  one  reason  for  this 
11:312:21061:16:8:72:330:145:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:behavior being the econometric technique used to estimate TFP. 
11:313:21123:8:23:72:525:137:8:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:9 The introduction of the productivity variable on the right-hand side can generate reverse causation if firms pay 
11:314:21237:23:17:72:525:114:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:efficiency wages (Krueger and Summers, 1988) to avoid shirking, which means they pay wages higher than the 
11:315:21344:17:17:72:525:97:10:g_d0_f8:10:Times New Roman:F:worker  outside  option.  This  causes  the  workers’  productivity  to  increase,  as  a  result  TFP  becomes  an 
11:316:21460:17:0:72:500:80:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:endogenous regressor. However, good instruments for TFP are not available to investigate this hypothesis.

12:319:21574:28:27:72:526:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: I  use  two  data  sets  for  the  empirical  analysis.  The  first  is  the  Colombian  data  set  in 
12:320:21677:27:28:72:525:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Goldberg  and  Pavcnik (2005),  from  which  I  use  the  estimated  wage  premium  and  its 
12:321:21769:28:27:72:526:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:respective  estimated  standard  error,  import  tariff,  real  exchange  rate,  and  coffee  price 
12:322:21869:27:28:72:526:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:variables. The second data set comes from Eslava et al. (2004), and consists of industry-level

13:346:23594:28:28:72:526:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:job  type  indicators. Iijt  is “1” if person i worked  in  industry j in  year t and  its  estimated 
13:347:23690:28:27:72:264:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:coefficient captures the wage premium. 
13:348:23727:27:28:108:526:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Goldberg  and  Pavcnik  (2005)  estimated the  wage  premium  using data  from all 
13:349:23809:28:27:72:526:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:industries, with industry ISIC 62  (retail  sales) being the  omitted  category. Notice  that  this 
13:350:23907:27:28:72:526:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:choice does not  affect  the  results  because  the  estimated  wage  premium  is  normalized  using 
13:351:24007:28:28:72:526:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  Haisken-DeNew  and  Schmidt  (1997)  procedure,  which  transforms  the estimated wage 
13:352:24099:28:27:72:526:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:premium  into  deviations  in  percentage  terms  from  the  employment-weighted  average  wage 
13:353:24195:27:28:72:525:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:premium. Hence this procedure provides estimates for the omitted industry and for the wage 
13:354:24286:28:27:72:525:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:premium  standard  errors. The  inverse  of  the  standard  errors  is  used  as  a  weight  in  the 
13:355:24386:27:28:72:244:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:estimation of equations (5) and (7). 
13:356:24422:28:28:72:526:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: One  important  concern  is  that  worker  self-selection  could  be  the  reason  behind  the 
13:357:24517:28:27:72:526:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:wage premium, and the specification used to estimate the wage premium does not control for 
13:358:24608:27:28:72:525:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:it.  The  literature  offers  no  clear  solution  to  this  problem.  Gibbons  and  Katz  (1992) 
13:359:24706:28:27:72:526:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:investigated  this  possibility  in  detail  and  could  not  reject  the  hypothesis  that  the  wage 
13:360:24809:27:28:72:525:345:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:premium  is  not  related  to  this  endogenous  worker-industry  matching.  On  the  other  hand, 
13:361:24908:28:28:72:526:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Abowd  et  al.  (1999)  using  matched  employer-employee  data  found  that  individual  specific 
13:362:25007:28:27:72:526:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:effects  are  more  important  than  firm  effects  in  the  wage  determination.  Nevertheless,  if 
13:363:25108:27:28:72:526:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:individuals do not move across industries, this will not pose a problem for the methodology 
13:364:25200:28:27:72:525:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:used  here.  And  this  is  indeed  the  case  for  Colombia,  since  Goldberg  and  Pavcnik  (2003) 
13:365:25301:27:28:72:526:207:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:found little evidence of inter-industry switching by workers. Thus, if there is self-selection to 
13:366:25398:28:28:72:526:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:a specific industry, it appears to be stable over time. This suggests that the time-differenced 
13:367:25493:28:27:72:459:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:version of equation (5) and equation (7) will control for this self-selection issue. 
13:368:25576:27:28:72:526:124:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: The  import  tariff  data  at  the  2-digit  ISIC  level  are  from  the  Colombian  Planning 
13:369:25670:28:0:72:526:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Department.  These  data  are  available  for  only  19  industries,  with  manufacturing  industries 
14:370:25774:0:28:72:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:among  them,  and  they  consist  of  an  average  of  more  disaggregated  tariffs  weighted  by the 
14:371:25875:28:28:72:526:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:number  of  product  lines.  The  coffee  price  and  exchange  rate  data  are  from  the  International 
14:372:25981:28:27:72:526:703:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:Monetary Fund’s International Financial Statistics (2001). The exchange rate is the nominal 
14:373:26073:27:28:72:526:676:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:B:effective  rate,  which  is  a  currency  bundle  encompassing  the  currencies of Colombia’s most 
14:374:26172:28:27:72:196:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:important trade partners.

14:377:26231:28:27:72:526:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: In Eslava et  al. (2004), the TFP is estimated  with the Capital-Labor-Energy-Material 
14:378:26318:27:28:72:526:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:methodology  (known as KLEM, and described in detail in their paper) using firm-level data 
14:379:26409:28:27:72:526:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:from  the  Colombian  Annual  Manufacturers  Survey  (AMS)  conducted  by  DANE.  The  AMS 
14:380:26500:27:28:72:526:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:contains  firm-level  information  about  the  prices  paid  for  inputs,  thus  providing  less  biased 
14:381:26605:28:28:72:523:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:firm-level estimates because there is no need to rely on non-parametric methods and industry-
14:382:26698:28:27:72:526:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:level  price  deflators  as  proxies  for  missing  plant-level  price  data.  The  industry-level  TFP 
14:383:26802:27:28:72:526:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:series  was  built  by  aggregating  firm-level  TFP  using  production  shares  as  weights.  The 
14:384:26901:28:27:72:526:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:productivity data are available only for the manufacturing sector at the ISIC 2-digit industry 
14:385:26996:27:28:72:526:345:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:level, as shown in Table 1. The sample used in this paper was ultimately determined by the 
14:386:27087:28:28:72:181:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:TFP data availability.

14:390:27136:27:28:72:526:207:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: Table 2 presents descriptive statistics of the variables used.  Here we  can see that the 
14:391:27225:28:28:72:526:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:average  import  tariff  decreased  from  36.6%  in  1986  to  13.1%  in  1998.  The  average  wage 
14:392:27325:28:27:72:526:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:premium declined from 5.7% in 1986 to 2.9% in 1998, whereas the average natural logarithm 
14:393:27415:27:28:72:525:124:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of  TFP  increased  from  0.332  to  0.647.  These  statistics  suggest  that  the  three  variables  of 
14:394:27520:28:0:72:335:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:interest changed during the trade liberalization period.

15:396:27578:28:28:72:178:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:4. Empirical Results 
15:397:27598:28:20:72:75:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
15:398:27598:20:28:108:526:683:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:In this section, I examine empirical evidence concerning the relationship among trade 
15:399:27684:28:27:72:526:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:liberalization,  the  wage  premium,  and  TFP,  in  order  to  estimate  the  bias  caused  by  the 
15:400:27785:27:28:72:526:628:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:omission  of  TFP  from  previous  analyses  in  the  literature.  Then,  I  estimate  additional 
15:401:27883:28:28:72:313:600:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regressions to assess the robustness of my results. 
15:402:27934:28:27:108:526:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:To obtain an empirical estimate of the bias generated by the omission of productivity 
15:403:28020:27:28:72:526:545:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:from previous models, the first step is to estimate the first difference of equation (5), as done 
15:404:28118:28:27:72:526:517:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:by  Goldberg  and  Pavcnik  (2005)  for  manufacturing  and  non-manufacturing  industries  (see 
15:405:28214:27:28:72:526:490:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:their Table 6b), but here using only manufacturing industries due to our  sample restrictions. 
15:406:28309:28:28:72:252:462:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The results are presented in Table 3.  
15:407:28347:28:27:108:526:434:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The technique used in column (1) is ordinary least squares (OLS). The other columns 
15:408:28431:27:28:72:526:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:present  the  2SLS  regressions,  using  as  instruments  the  1983  tariff  level  and  its  interactions 
15:409:28538:28:27:72:525:379:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:with the exchange rate and coffee prices. The results in column (1) of Table 3 are exactly the 
15:410:28632:27:28:72:526:352:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:same as those reported in Goldberg and Pavcnik (2005) (see their Table 3b column (2)), since 
15:411:28725:28:28:72:526:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:they  are  based  on  identical  data.  The  estimated  tariff  coefficient  here  implies  that  a  ten 
15:412:28830:28:27:72:526:296:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:percentage  point  decrease  in  tariffs  generates  a  1.44%  decline  in  the  wage  premium.  In 
15:413:28930:27:28:72:526:269:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:columns (2) to (6) the estimated tariff coefficients are positive and statistically significant at 
15:414:29029:28:28:72:526:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the 5% level in columns (4), (5), and (6), with the coefficients ranging from 0.096 to 0.199, 
15:415:29122:28:27:72:526:213:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  statistically  significant  at  the  10%  level  in  column  (3),  with  an  estimated  coefficient  of 
15:416:29231:27:28:72:526:186:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:0.051.  These  coefficients  are  at  least  two  times  larger  than  the  estimates  in  Goldberg  and 
15:417:29336:28:27:72:395:158:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Pavcnik (2005) (see their Table 6b), which included all industries.  
15:418:29403:27:28:72:526:131:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: The  excluded  instruments  are  statistically  significant  in  all  first  stage  regressions, 
15:419:29500:28:28:72:526:103:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:exhibiting an F-statistic of at least 136, which is enough to reject the null hypothesis that the 
15:420:29598:28:0:72:525:75:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2SLS t-test at the 5% significance level has an  actual size larger than 10%. This means that 
16:421:29693:0:28:72:525:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the t-tests  conducted  do  not  suffer  from  size  problems  due  to  weak  instruments11. For  all 
16:422:29794:28:28:72:526:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:specifications, the null   hypothesis   of   underidentification   (the   included   and   excluded 
16:423:29894:28:27:72:525:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:instrument  matrix  does  not  have  full  rank) is rejected at  the  5%  level12. Although  Goldberg 
16:424:29994:27:28:72:525:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and Pavcnik (2005) did not conduct over-identification tests and Hausman endogeneity tests, 
16:425:30086:28:27:72:526:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:these tests are conducted here. The endogeneity tests for the 2SLS estimates do not reject the 
16:426:30181:27:28:72:525:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:null hypothesis of exogeneity of tariffs for all specifications. The over-identification test for 
16:427:30279:28:28:72:526:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the specification in column (4) has a p-value of 14%, and the null hypothesis that the model is 
16:428:30375:28:27:72:526:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:correctly  specified  is  not  rejected  at  the  10%  level.  In  column  (6),  the  null  hypothesis  is 
16:429:30482:27:28:72:526:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:rejected  at  the  10% level  of  confidence.  This  result should  make  the  researcher concerned 
16:430:30581:28:27:72:526:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:about the existence of specification problems, which could be caused by the omission of the 
16:431:30673:27:28:72:98:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:TFP. 
16:432:30677:28:28:72:526:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: Next I incorporate the natural logarithm of TFP into the econometric model to address 
16:433:30763:28:27:72:526:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  consistency  problem  presented  in  section  2.  These  results  are  reported  in  Table  4.  The 
16:434:30868:27:28:72:526:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:technique used in column (1) is OLS and the technique employed in the remaining columns is 
16:435:30959:28:27:72:358:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2SLS using the Goldberg and Pavcnik (2005) instruments.  
16:436:31015:27:28:108:525:345:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The TFP coefficient is positive as expected and statistically significant in all models, 
16:437:31103:28:28:72:526:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:with values ranging from 0.155 to 0.176. The tariff coefficient is positive in all models, but it 
16:438:31201:28:27:72:526:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:is statistically significant at the 5% level only in columns (1), (4), (5), and (6). Notice that the 
16:439:31302:27:28:72:526:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:lack of statistical significance for the tariff coefficient in columns (2) and (3) is also present 
16:440:31401:28:27:72:526:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in  Table  3  columns  (2)  and  (3),  suggesting  that  this  is  caused  by  the  choice  of  instruments 
16:441:31509:27:91:72:246:207:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:rather than by the inclusion of TFP. 
16:442:31545:91:15:72:219:116:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:                                                 
16:443:31593:15:16:72:523:101:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:11 Since these specifications contain only one endogenous regressor and less than three instruments, the Stock-
16:444:31703:16:7:72:506:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:Yogo reference values for the bias of 2SLS as a fraction of OLS bias greater than 10% cannot be calculated. 
16:445:31809:7:0:72:523:78:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:12 The underidentification test used here is based on the Kleibergen-Paap LM statistic (Baum et al., 2007, p. 21). 
17:446:31923:0:28:72:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: The  instruments  are  statistically  significant  in  the  first  stage  regressions,  as  was  also 
17:447:32025:28:28:72:526:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the   case   in   Table   3.   The   estimated   TFP   coefficient   is   positive   as   expected   in   all 
17:448:32135:28:27:72:515:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:specifications, but statistically significant at the 10% level only in columns (2), (3), and (5). 
17:449:32232:27:28:72:526:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: The  null  hypothesis  of  underidentification  is  rejected  for  all  specifications  at  the  5% 
17:450:32332:28:27:72:523:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:level of significance. The first stage F-statistics are above 40, which is greater than the Stock-
17:451:32430:27:28:72:526:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Yogo  reference  values  for  the  actual  size  of  2SLS t-tests  at  5%  significance.  These  two 
17:452:32531:28:28:72:526:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:econometric   tests   indicate   that,   assuming   that   the   instruments   are   valid,   instrument 
17:453:32636:28:27:72:526:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:irrelevance does not seem to be a problem here. The null hypothesis of the over-identification 
17:454:32731:27:28:72:526:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:test is not rejected for the overidentified specifications in columns (4) and (6). Lastly, for all 
17:455:32830:28:27:72:524:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2SLS specifications, the null hypothesis of exogeneity is not rejected using the Hausman test. 
17:456:32923:27:28:108:526:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The  results  here  support  the  argument  that  the  absence  of  TFP  generates  biased 
17:457:33014:28:28:72:526:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:estimates of the effect of tariffs on the wage premium. When TFP is included in the estimated 
17:458:33108:28:27:72:526:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:equation, the tariff coefficient decreases by 36% (column (1) of Table 4) or by 44% (column 
17:459:33200:27:28:72:421:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(6) of Table 4) relative to the specifications that exclude TFP (Table 3).  
17:460:33275:28:27:108:526:372:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:A:To  illustrate  why  this  bias  is  important, let’s calculate the predicted change in the 
17:461:33367:27:28:72:526:345:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:wage  premium  using  the  estimates  when  TFP  is  ignored  (Table 3 column  (6))  and  the 
17:462:33460:28:28:72:526:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:estimates when TFP is incorporated (Table 4 column (6)) evaluated at the average changes in 
17:463:33552:28:27:72:526:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the tariff (-23.5%) and TFP (31.5%) that occurred between 1986 and 1998. By ignoring TFP, 
17:464:33642:27:28:72:526:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:this tariff change leads to a 3.38% decrease in the wage premium. When TFP is included, the 
17:465:33734:28:27:72:526:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:tariff effect alone implies a decrease of 2.6% in the wage premium, and the TFP effect is an 
17:466:33827:27:28:72:526:207:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:increase  of 4.55%  in  the  wage  premium,  resulting  in  a  net  2.88%  increase  in  the  wage 
17:467:33925:28:28:72:124:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:premium.  
17:468:33934:28:27:108:526:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:According  to  Goldberg  and  Pavcnik  (2005),  in  Colombia,  the  unskilled  intensive 
17:469:34023:27:28:72:526:124:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:industries suffered the largest tariff cuts. I find that the change in TFP seems to be large when 
17:470:34121:28:0:72:526:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  unskilled  share  is  small  (correlation  of -0.35).  The  skilled-unskilled  average  wage 
18:471:34221:0:28:72:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:premium   gap  increases  by   0.76%  when  TFP  is  ignored.  When  changes  in   TFP   are 
18:472:34314:28:28:72:526:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:incorporated, we can see that the gap actually increases by 0.88%, which is 15% larger than 
18:473:34406:28:27:72:526:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:before.  So,  the  current  methodology  underestimated  the  effect  of  trade  liberalization  on  this 
18:474:34512:27:28:72:197:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:wage inequality measure.

18:476:34536:27:28:72:183:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:4.1 Robustness checks 
18:477:34557:28:28:72:526:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: The  correlation  between  TFP  and  import  tariffs  may  raise  concerns  that  there  is 
18:478:34649:28:27:72:526:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:multicollinearity  in  the  regressions  estimated  so  far.  If  this  were  the  case,  then  in  my 
18:479:34752:27:28:72:526:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:theoretical  framework,  the  majority  of  the  tariff  effect  on  the  wage  premium  would  occur 
18:480:34854:28:27:72:525:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:through  changes  in  TFP.  Greene  (2002,  p.  56-57)  identifies  three  common  symptoms  of 
18:481:34950:27:28:72:526:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:multicollinearity.  First,  the  estimated  coefficients  will  have  high  standard  errors  and  low 
18:482:35053:28:28:72:526:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:significance  levels,  which  is  not  the  case  with  the  estimates  reported  in  Tables  3  and  4. 
18:483:35158:28:27:72:526:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Second,  the  estimated  coefficients  will  have  the  wrong  signs  or  implausible  magnitudes, 
18:484:35257:27:28:72:526:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:which  again  are  not  the  case  with  the  estimates  reported  in  Tables 3  and  4.  Third,  small 
18:485:35360:28:27:72:525:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:changes in the data will lead to large swings in the estimated coefficients. I re-estimated the 
18:486:35456:27:28:72:526:345:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:models  by  excluding  one  year  at  a  time  and  the  estimated  coefficients  did  not  exhibit  any 
18:487:35561:28:28:72:364:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:large change, either in magnitude or in the standard errors.13 
18:488:35623:28:27:72:526:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: The  number  of  clusters  (nine  manufacturing  industries)  in  the  data  set  is  small  and, 
18:489:35721:27:28:72:526:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:according  to  simulations  performed  by  Cameron  et  al.  (2008),  this  can  produce  estimates  of 
18:490:35825:28:27:72:526:234:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:B:the  coefficients’  standard  errors  that  are  biased  downward.  Unfortunately,  the  number  of 
18:491:35925:27:28:72:526:207:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:clusters  cannot  be  increased  because  nine  manufacturing  industries  is  the  finest  level  of 
18:492:36027:28:28:72:526:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:disaggregation that  can  be obtained  from the Colombian household surveys. To address this 
18:493:36120:28:27:72:526:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:concern  I re-estimated all  specifications  using  a  pairs  bootstrap  with the bootstrap-se 
18:494:36212:27:31:72:526:124:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:procedure (Cameron et al. 2008, p. 416) that randomly resample at the cluster level. It means 
18:495:36306:31:15:72:219:93:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:                                                 
18:496:36354:15:0:72:309:78:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:13 These results are available from the author upon request. 
19:497:36415:0:28:72:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that if the j-th cluster is selected, then all observations in that cluster will be in the resample. 
19:498:36514:28:28:72:526:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:An  important  aspect  is  how  to incorporate the  sample  weights in  the  resampling  procedure, 
19:499:36612:28:27:72:526:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:given  these  weights  vary  over  time  within  cluster.  Unfortunately,  the  literature  does  not 
19:500:36714:27:28:72:525:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:provide  guidance  on  how  to  procedure in this  special  case.  I  chose  the  naïve  strategy  of 
19:501:36815:28:27:72:456:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:ignoring weights in the bootstrap exercise. The results are displayed in Table 5. 
19:502:36895:27:28:72:526:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: First, I estimated the first difference of equation (5) by OLS, column (1), and then by 
19:503:36983:28:28:72:526:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2SLS,  columns  (2)  and  (3).  The  tariff coefficients  are  positive,  but  statistically  significant 
19:504:37089:28:27:72:526:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:only  in  column  (3)  and  at  the  5%  level.  The  null  hypotheses  of  underidentification  and  of 
19:505:37194:27:28:72:526:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:exogeneity of the tariff  cannot be rejected at the  10% level  for both  columns (2) and (3).  In 
19:506:37293:28:27:72:525:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  first  stage of  the  2SLS  estimates,  only  in  column  (2)  the  excluded  instruments  are 
19:507:37392:27:28:72:526:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:statistically  significant.  The  first  stage F-statistic  is  larger  than  the  Stock-Yogo  reference 
19:508:37497:28:28:72:204:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:values only in column (2).  
19:509:37524:28:27:72:526:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: Next  I  re-estimated  equation  (7).  The  results  for  the  OLS  estimate  are  reported  in 
19:510:37620:27:28:72:526:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Table  5  column  (4).  The  tariff  coefficient  is  positive  and not statistically  significant  at  the 
19:511:37728:28:27:72:526:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:10%  level.  Notice  that  it  is  smaller  than  its  Table  5  column  (1)  counterpart.  The  TFP 
19:512:37829:27:28:72:526:345:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:coefficient   is   positive   and   statistically   significant   at   the   5%   level.   The   test   of   joint 
19:513:37944:28:28:72:526:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:significance of the tariff and TFP rejects the null hypothesis that both coefficients are equal to 
19:514:38043:28:27:72:176:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:zero at the 5% level.  
19:515:38065:27:28:108:526:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The  2SLS  estimates  of  equation  (7)  in  columns  (5)  and  (6)  also  presented  a  positive 
19:516:38163:28:27:72:526:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and statistically significant coefficient for TFP, and a positive and not statistically significant 
19:517:38263:27:28:72:526:207:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:coefficient   for   tariff.   Again,   the   estimated   tariff   coefficients   are   smaller   than   their 
19:518:38373:28:28:72:526:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:counterparts  in  columns  (2)  and  (3)  as  expected.  The  null  hypothesis  that  both  the  TFP  and 
19:519:38479:28:27:72:443:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:tariff coefficients are zero is rejected at the 5% level for columns (5) and (6). 
19:520:38560:27:28:108:526:124:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:In the first stage regression, the excluded instruments are statistically significant only 
19:521:38651:28:0:72:526:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in column (5). The TFP  coefficient is positive and statistically significant at the 5% level in 
20:522:38750:0:28:72:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:column  (5)  and  at  10%  level  in  column  (6).  The  null  hypothesis  of  underidentification  is 
20:523:38853:28:28:72:526:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:rejected at the 5% level in both cases. The first-stage F-statistic is larger than the Stock-Yogo 
20:524:38951:28:27:72:526:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reference  value  only  for  column  (5).  The  null hypothesis  of  exogeneity  of  tariffs  cannot  be 
20:525:39055:27:28:72:377:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:rejected at the 5% level of confidence for columns (5) and (6).  
20:526:39118:28:27:72:526:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: The  results  in  Table  5  provide  support  to  the  Table  4  findings.  Adding  TFP  to  the 
20:527:39215:27:28:72:526:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:estimated  model  resulted  in  statistically  significant  TFP  coefficients  in  both  the  first  and 
20:528:39320:28:28:72:526:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:second  stage  of  the  2SLS  regressions,  and  in  smaller  estimated  tariff  coefficients,  as 
20:529:39419:28:27:72:525:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:predicted.  At  the  end  of  the  day, the  inclusion  of TFP  appears  to  make  an  important 
20:530:39516:27:28:72:372:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:difference on the estimated effect of tariffs on wage premium.

20:532:39576:28:27:72:149:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:5. Conclusions 
20:533:39590:27:28:72:75:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
20:534:39590:28:27:72:526:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: This  paper  has  assessed  a  major  weakness  of  the  current  methodology  used  to 
20:535:39678:27:28:72:526:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:estimate  the  effect  of  import  tariffs  on  the  wage  premium:  the  omission  of  total  factor 
20:536:39780:28:27:72:525:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:productivity  from  the  estimated  model.  This  omission  invalidates the  instrument  commonly 
20:537:39877:27:28:72:526:345:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:used  in  the  literature,  the  pre-trade  reform  import  tariff  level,  because  TFP  is  positively 
20:538:39982:28:28:72:526:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:correlated  with  both  the  wage  premium  and  the  import  tariff  setting.  This  implies  a 
20:539:40079:28:27:72:526:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:correlation between the error term and the excluded instrument, and thus leads to inconsistent 
20:540:40174:27:28:72:329:262:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:estimates of the tariff’s effect on the wage premium.  
20:541:40228:28:27:72:526:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: When  the  change  in  TFP  is  incorporated  into  the  estimated  specification,  the  results 
20:542:40325:27:28:72:526:207:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reveal that TFP does indeed positively affect the wage premium directly, and, as an included 
20:543:40418:28:28:72:526:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:instrument, also has a positive correlation with the change in tariffs, the endogenous regressor 
20:544:40515:28:27:72:526:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in  the  estimated  model.  I  find  that  a  10  %  increase  in  TFP  leads  to  a  1.6%  increase  in  the 
20:545:40625:27:28:72:525:124:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:wage  premium.  The  estimated  effect  of  the  import  tariff  is  positive,  and  a  ten  percentage 
20:546:40729:28:0:72:526:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:point  decrease  in  import  tariffs  decreases  the  wage  premium  by  1.1%,  which  is  about  36% 
21:547:40833:0:28:72:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:smaller than the estimates obtained in previous studies, which omitted productivity from the 
21:548:40926:28:28:72:144:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:methodology.  
21:549:40939:28:27:72:525:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: One  consequence  of  the  use  of  biased  estimates  from  previous  studies  is  that  in  the 
21:550:41037:27:28:72:526:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Colombian  case,  the  omission  of  TFP  resulted  in  a  smaller  estimated  increase  in  the  gap 
21:551:41139:28:27:72:526:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:between  the  average  wage  premium  for  skilled  and  unskilled  workers,  which  leads  to  an 
21:552:41238:27:28:72:473:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:underestimation of the increase in inequality due to changes in the wage premium.
