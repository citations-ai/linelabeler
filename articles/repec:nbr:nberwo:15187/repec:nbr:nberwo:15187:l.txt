2:28:1358:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models are often  solved and estimated  under specific
2:29:1458:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:assumptions as to whether the exogenous variables  are difference or trend stationary. However, even
2:30:1558:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:mild departures of the data generating process from these assumptions can severely bias the estimates
2:31:1659:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:of the model parameters. This paper proposes  new estimators  that do not require researchers to take
2:32:1760:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:a stand on whether shocks  have permanent or transitory effects. These procedures have two key features.
2:33:1864:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:First, the same filter is applied to both the data and the model variables. Second, the filtered variables
2:34:1970:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:are stationary when evaluated at the true parameter vector. The estimators are approximately normally
2:35:2071:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:distributed  not only when the shocks are mildly persistent, but also when they  have near or exact
2:36:2170:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:unit roots. Simulations  show that these robust estimators perform well especially  when the shocks
2:37:2269:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:C:are highly persistent yet stationary. In such cases, linear detrending and first differencing are shown
2:38:2372:14:42:72:255:448:12:Times:12:Times:C:to yield biased or imprecise estimates.

3:54:2706:0:29:72:160:699:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:C:1    Introduction
3:55:2723:29:18:72:554:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models are now accepted as the primary framework
3:56:2817:18:18:72:554:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for macroeconomic analysis.  Until recently, counterfactual experiments were conducted by assigning
3:57:2916:18:18:72:554:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the parameters of the models with values that are loosely calibrated to the data.  More recently, serious
3:58:3021:18:18:72:554:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:efforts have been made to estimate the model parameters using classical and Bayesian methods.  This
3:59:3120:18:18:72:554:598:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:permits researchers to assess how well the models fit the data both in and out of samples.  Formal
3:60:3218:18:18:72:554:580:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimation also permits errors arising from sampling or model uncertainty to be explicitly accounted
3:61:3318:18:18:72:554:562:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for in counterfactual policy simulations.  Arguably, DSGE models are now taken more seriously as a
3:62:3416:18:18:72:426:544:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tool for policy analysis because of such serious econometric investigations.
3:63:3492:18:18:88:553:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Any attempt to estimate DSGE models must confront the fact that macroeconomic data are highly
3:64:3585:18:17:72:554:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:persistent.  This fact often requires researchers to take a stand on the specification of the trends in
3:65:3688:17:18:72:554:491:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:DSGE models.  Specifically, to take the model to the data, a researcher needs to use sample analogs
3:66:3787:18:18:72:554:473:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of the deviations from steady states and,  in doing so,  must decide how to detrend the variables in
3:67:3887:18:18:72:554:455:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the  model  and  in  the  data.   Table  1  is  a  non-exhaustive  listing  of  how  trends  are  treated  in  some
3:68:4002:18:18:72:554:437:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:notable papers.1Some studies assume stochastic trends for the model and use first differenced data in
3:69:4103:18:18:72:554:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimation.  A number of studies specify deterministic trends for the model and use linearly detrended
3:70:4205:18:18:72:554:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:data  in  estimation.   Studies  that  apply  the  Hodrick-Prescott  (HP)  filter  to  the  data  differ  in  what
3:71:4319:18:18:72:554:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:trends are specified for the model.  Some assume simple linear trends, while others assume unit root
3:72:4419:18:18:72:554:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:processes.  Table 1 clearly demonstrates that a variety of trends have been specified for the model and
3:73:4522:18:18:72:370:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a variety of detrending methods have been used in estimation.
3:74:4583:18:18:88:553:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The problem for researchers is that it is not easy to ascertain whether highly persistent data are
3:75:4681:18:18:72:554:311:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:trend stationary or difference stationary in finite samples.  While many have studied the implications
3:76:4783:18:18:72:553:293:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for estimation and inference of inappropriate detrending in linear models,2much less is known about
3:77:4882:18:18:72:554:275:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the  effects  of  detrending  in  estimation  of  non-linear  models.   From  simulation  evidence  of  Doorn
3:78:4991:18:18:72:554:257:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(2006) for an inventory model, it seems that HP filtering can significantly bias the estimated dynamic
3:79:5093:18:17:72:554:239:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:parameters.  As well, while the local-to-unit framework is available to help researchers understand the
3:80:5196:17:18:72:554:222:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:properties  of  the  estimated  autoregressive  root  when  the  data  are  strongly  persistent,  it  is  unclear
3:81:5310:18:18:72:554:204:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to what extent the framework can be used in non-linear estimation even in the single equation case.
3:82:5409:18:16:72:554:186:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:What makes estimation of DSGE models distinct is that they consist of a system of equations and
3:83:5504:16:15:84:554:170:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:1As of June 2009, these papers were cited almost 2500 times at the Web of Science (former Social Science Citation
3:84:5617:15:7:72:269:155:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:Index) and almost 8000 times at Google Scholar.
3:85:5664:7:15:84:554:148:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:2For example, Nelson and Kang (1981) showed that linear detrending a unit root process can generate spurious cycles.
3:86:5780:15:11:72:554:133:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:Cogley and Nason (1995a) found that improper filtering can alter the persistence and the volatility of the series while
3:87:5899:11:11:72:554:122:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:spurious correlations in the filtered data was documented in Harvey and Jaeger (1993).  Singleton (1988) and Christiano
3:88:6018:11:0:72:522:111:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:and den Haan (1996) discussed how inappropriate filtering can affect estimation and inference in linear models.
4:89:6130:0:18:72:415:699:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:misspecification in one equation can affect estimates in other equations.
4:90:6203:18:18:88:553:681:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:This paper develops robust estimation procedures that do not require researchers to take a stand on
4:91:6302:18:18:72:554:663:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:whether shocks in the model have an exact or a near unit root, and yet obtain consistent estimates of
4:92:6403:18:18:72:554:645:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the model parameters.  All robust procedures have two characteristics.  First, the same transformation
4:93:6505:18:18:72:554:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(filter) is applied to both the data and the model variables.  Second, the filtered variables are stationary
4:94:6613:18:9:72:554:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:when evaluated at the true parameter vector.  The estimators have the classical properties of being
4:95:6712:9:9:72:81:600:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:C:√
4:96:6713:9:18:81:498:591:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:A:Tconsistent and asymptotically normal for all values of the largest autoregressive root.
4:97:6801:18:18:88:553:573:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Our point of departure is that the not too uncommon practice of applying different filters to the
4:98:6898:18:18:72:554:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:model variables and the data can have undesirable consequences.  Indeed, as we will show, estimates
4:99:6997:18:18:72:554:537:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of parameters governing the propagation and amplification mechanisms in the model can be severely
4:100:7094:18:18:72:554:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distorted when the trend specified for the model is not consistent with the one applied to the data.
4:101:7194:18:18:72:554:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Accordingly, we insist on estimators that apply the same transformation to both the model and the
4:102:7291:18:18:72:554:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:data.  This, however, may still lead to biased estimates if the filter does not remove the trends actually
4:103:7397:18:17:72:554:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:present in the data.  Accordingly, we need to work with filters that can remove both deterministic and
4:104:7499:17:18:72:554:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:stochastic trends without the researcher taking a stand before solving and estimating the model.  The
4:105:7600:18:18:72:554:430:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:idea of applying robust filters to both the model and the data is not new.  Christiano and den Haan
4:106:7699:18:18:72:554:412:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(1996)  as  well  as  Burnside  (1998)  applied  the  HP  filter  to  both  the  model  and  the  data,  but  they
4:107:7813:18:18:72:554:394:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:had to resort to simulation estimation to get around the large state vector that the HP filter induces.
4:108:7916:18:18:72:554:376:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The filters we consider have the same desirable feature as the HP in that they adapt to the trends
4:109:8014:18:18:72:554:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the data.  However, they can be implemented with simple modifications to the state space system
4:110:8112:18:18:72:554:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:while keeping the dimension of the state vector small.  Specifically, we consider four transformations:
4:111:8215:18:18:72:554:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(i) quasi-differencing,  (ii) unconstrained first differencing,  (iii) hybrid differencing,  and (iv) the HP
4:112:8323:18:18:72:554:304:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:filter.  All filters can be used in GMM estimation but not every method can be implemented in the
4:113:8420:18:18:72:554:286:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:likelihood framework.  Importantly,  one can use standard asymptotic inference as the finite sample
4:114:8519:18:18:72:554:268:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distribution of the estimators are well approximated by the normal distribution not only when the
4:115:8616:18:18:72:554:250:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:large autoregressive root is far from one, but also when it is near or on the unit circle.  The procedures
4:116:8722:18:18:72:554:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:can be applied to DSGE models whose solution can be shown to exist and is unique, and can be solved
4:117:8821:18:18:72:500:214:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:using variations of the method discussed in Blanchard and Kahn (1980) and Sims (2002).
4:118:8907:18:17:88:553:196:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:As discussed in Canova and Sala (2009), DSGE models are susceptible to identification failure, in
4:119:9004:17:18:72:554:179:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:which case, consistent estimation of parameters is not possible irrespective of the treatment of trends.
4:120:9108:18:18:72:554:161:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In view of this consideration and to fix ideas, we use a basic stochastic growth model whose properties
4:121:9211:18:18:72:554:143:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are well understood.  The model, which will be presented in Section 2, will also be used to perform
4:122:9310:18:18:72:554:125:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:baseline simulation experiments.  The new estimators are presented in Sections 3 and 4.  Sections 5

5:124:9510:0:18:72:554:699:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:highly persistent yet stationary.  These results also hold up in larger models though some filters are

6:252:13636:11:0:72:475:111:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:have been used to estimate DSGE models.  Ruge-Murcia (2007) provides a review of these methods.

7:266:14363:18:18:72:554:488:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We  use  the  unconditional  autocovariances  but  matching  impulse  responses  can  also  be  considered.
7:267:14470:18:18:72:554:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Although MM is somewhat less widely used than maximum likelihood estimators in the DSGE liter-

7:269:14667:18:18:72:554:434:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The more important reason for using MM is practical as it can be used with many popular filters.  We
7:270:14767:18:18:72:252:416:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:will return to this point subsequently.
7:271:14806:18:18:88:554:398:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The statistical properties of̂Θ will depend onρzand the filters used.  The robust approaches we

7:274:15112:18:18:72:554:344:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:consider four filters and then explore which of these have better finite samples properties.  Properties

9:349:19851:18:45:72:524:147:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the HP filter, which is heavily used in empirical analysis.  An HP detrended series is defined as

10:355:20063:30:18:85:554:669:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:1:  Compute  the  autocovariance  matrices  of  the  HP-filtered  datâΩdHP(0), ...,̂ΩdHP(M).   Define

10:367:20715:33:18:88:553:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:This approach is similar to Burnside (1998) who also applies the HP filter to both the model and
10:368:20811:18:18:72:554:477:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the data series, but he uses simulations to compute model-implied moments. Like the FD, the variables
10:369:20912:18:17:72:553:459:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the model and the data will be stationary withoutρzentering the filter.  By construction of the HP
10:370:21013:17:18:72:554:442:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:filter, both the filtered data and the filtered model variables are stationary for allρz≤1.  Note that
10:371:21115:18:18:72:554:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:HP filtering involves (implicitly or explicitly) estimation of many more autocovariances than the other
10:372:21218:18:18:72:554:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimators considered above.  Burnside (1998) reports that although the HP filter removes variation
10:373:21317:18:18:72:554:388:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:potentially informative for estimation of the structural parameters, the HP filtered model and data
10:374:21416:18:30:72:479:370:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:series have sufficient variability to discriminate competing theories of business cycles.

10:376:21538:29:18:72:553:311:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Let̂ωdjgenerically denote thej−thsample moments of the filtered variables whileωmj(Θ) denote the

10:379:21700:29:18:72:554:235:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and let   ̄g(Θ) = ( ̄g0(Θ), ̄g1(Θ),..., ̄gM(Θ)).  Then the MM estimator iŝΘ = minΘ|| ̄g(Θ)||is a non-
10:380:21802:18:17:72:554:217:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:linear GMM estimator using an identity weighting matrix.  This sub-optimal weighting matrix is used
10:381:21901:17:18:72:554:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:because when there are fewer shocks than variables in the system, stochastic singularity will induce
10:382:22001:18:18:72:554:182:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:collinearity in the variables resulting in a matrix of covariances that would be singular.  Even if there
10:383:22106:18:18:72:554:164:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are as many shocks as endogenous variables, Abowd and Card (1989), Altonji and Segal (1996) and
10:384:22201:18:18:72:554:146:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:others find that an identity matrix performs better than the optimal weighting matrix in the context of
10:385:22304:18:18:72:554:128:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimating covariance structures.  The optimal weighting matrix, which contains high order moments,
10:386:22403:18:0:72:554:110:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tends to correlate with the moments and this correlation undermines the performance of the estimator.
11:387:22505:0:18:88:554:699:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Let ̄G(Θ) be the matrix of derivatives of  ̄g(Θ) with respect to Θ.  In standard covariance structure
11:388:22606:18:18:72:553:681:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f8:B:estimation,  the  parameters  enter  the  model  momentsωm(Θ)  but  not  the  samplêωd,  so  that  if̂ωd
11:389:22711:18:18:72:554:663:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are moments of stationary variables,  then under regularity conditions such as stated in Newey and
11:390:22809:18:19:72:497:645:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:McFadden (1994), we have the conventional result that the estimators are consistent and

11:398:23010:18:18:71:554:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Θ = Θ0. This distribution theory applies to the FD and the HP because these two filters do not depend
11:399:23111:18:17:71:553:551:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f8:B:on unknown parameters and the filtered variables are always stationary.  For the HD estimator,̂ωd
11:400:23208:17:18:72:554:534:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:depends onρzbut its first derivative does not, so that a quadratic expansion of the objective function
11:401:23310:18:18:72:554:516:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:can still be used to derive the asymptotic distribution of the estimator.  Although ̄G(Θ) for the HD
11:402:23410:18:18:72:554:498:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:has a random limit whenρz= 1,̂ωdis a vector of covariances of stationary variables when evaluated
11:403:23507:18:18:72:554:480:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:at the true value ofρz.  Thus, the ’standardized’ estimator (or thetstatistic) remains asymptotically
11:404:23608:18:18:72:108:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:normal.
11:405:23615:18:18:88:553:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:To  understand  the  properties  of  the  QD  estimator,  we  need  to  explain  why  we  normalize  the
11:406:23719:18:18:72:554:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:lagged  autocovariances  by  the  variance.   Suppose  we  had  used ̃gj(Θ)  =̂Ωd∆ρz(j)−Ωm∆ρz(j)  instead
11:407:23824:18:18:72:554:408:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of   ̄gj(Θ)  =̂ωd∆ρz(j)−ωm∆ρz(j)  whereωd∆ρz(j)  =̂Ωd∆ρz(j)−̂Ωd∆ρz(0),  andωm∆ρzis  likewise  defined.
11:408:23926:18:15:72:554:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Minimizing|| ̃g(Θ)||over  Θ  yields  an  estimator  that  we  can  call  QD0.   The  problem  here  is  that
11:409:24034:15:21:72:554:375:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f2:B:̂Ωd∆ρz(j) is a cross-product of data quasi-differenced atρz, and is thus quadratic inρz.  The quadratic
11:410:24137:21:18:72:554:354:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:expansion of|| ̃g(Θ)||around Θ0contains terms that are not negligible whenρzis one.  As such, the
11:411:24234:18:18:72:554:336:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sample objective function cannot be shown to converge uniformly to the population objective function.
11:412:24335:18:18:72:554:318:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In fact, we show in Gorodnichenko et al. (2009) in a simpler setting that the QD0estimator forρzis
11:413:24433:18:18:72:554:300:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:consistent but it has a convergence rate ofT3/4and is not asymptotically normal.  The QD estimator
11:414:24531:18:17:72:554:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is motivated by the fact that the offending term in the quadratic expansion of̂Ωd∆ρz(j) is collinear
11:415:24631:17:30:72:200:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:witĥΩd∆ρz(0) whenρz= 1.

11:421:24897:30:18:88:553:169:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:A sketch of the argument is given in the Appendix for the baseline model whose closed-form solution
11:422:24996:18:18:71:553:151:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is known.  By subtracting the variance from each lagged autocovariance, the quadratic terms in the
11:423:25094:18:18:71:553:133:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:expansion of the objective function are asymptotically negligible.  This leads to the rather unexpected
11:424:25197:18:17:71:554:115:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:property  that̂Θ  is  asymptotically  normal  even  whenρz=  1.   From  a  practical  perspective,  the
11:425:25300:17:0:71:553:98:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:primary  advantage  of  the  robust  estimators  is  that  when  properly  studentized,  the  estimators  are
12:426:25410:0:18:72:554:699:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:normally distributed whetherρz<1 orρz= 1, which greatly facilitates inference.  Since all estimators
12:427:25510:18:18:71:553:681:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are consistent and asymptotically normal, it remains to consider which estimator is more efficient in
12:428:25611:18:29:71:139:663:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:finite samples.
12:429:25626:29:25:71:202:634:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:C:4.1    Related Literature
12:430:25651:25:18:71:553:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Our approach is related to other methods considered in the literature.  Cogley (2001) considers several
12:431:25754:18:18:71:553:591:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:alternative estimation strategies and finds that using cointegration relationships in unconditional Euler
12:432:25859:18:18:71:553:573:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:equations works quite well, as the moments used in GMM estimation remain stationary irrespective
12:433:25955:18:18:71:553:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of whether the data are trend or difference stationary.  Our method is similar (and complementary)
12:434:26053:18:18:71:553:537:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to  Cogley’s  (2001)  in  that  neither  requires  the  researcher  to  take  a  stand  on  the  properties  of  the
12:435:26169:18:18:71:553:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:trend dynamics before estimation, but there are important differences.  First, quasi-differencing can
12:436:26270:18:18:71:553:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:easily handle multiple I(1) or highly persistent shocks.  In contrast, using cointegration relationships
12:437:26374:18:18:71:553:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:works  only  for  certain  types  of  shocks.   For  example,  if  the  shock  to  disutility  of  labor  supply  is
12:438:26490:18:17:71:553:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:an  I(1)  process,  there  is  no  cointegration  vector  to  nullify  a  trend  in  hours.   Second,  cointegration
12:439:26606:17:18:71:553:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:often involves estimating identities and therefore the researcher has to add an error term (typically
12:440:26707:18:18:71:553:430:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:measurement error) to avoid singularity.  Our approach does not estimate specific equations and hence
12:441:26808:18:18:71:553:412:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:does not need to augment the model with additional, atheoretical shocks.  Finally, using unconditional
12:442:26910:18:18:71:553:394:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cointegration vectors may make estimation of some structural parameters such as adjustment costs
12:443:27006:18:18:71:553:376:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:impossible because adjustment costs are often zero by construction in the steady state.  In contrast,
12:444:27107:18:18:71:553:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:our approach utilizes short-run dynamics in estimation and thus can estimate the parameters affecting
12:445:27208:18:18:71:553:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:short-run dynamics of the variables.  Overall, our approach exploit different properties of the model
12:446:27309:18:18:71:400:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in estimation and hence can be used in a broader array of situations.

12:448:27469:18:18:71:553:286:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:models,  but  their  analysis  is  confined  to  a  single  equation  framework.   They  propose  to  use  the

12:450:27676:18:18:71:553:250:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from the fact that the permanent component in the Beveridge-Nelson decomposition may be different
12:451:27773:18:18:71:553:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from actual trend and is derived under some strong assumptions, our approach is a one-step procedure
12:452:27873:18:18:71:356:214:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that can handle multiple I(1) shocks as we discussed above.
12:453:27932:18:17:88:553:196:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Canova  (2008)  explicitly  treats  the  latent  trends  as  unobserved  components  and  estimates  the
12:454:28036:17:18:71:553:179:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:trends and cycles directly.  While this allows the data to select the trend endogenously, the procedure
12:455:28139:18:18:71:553:161:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:can be imprecise when the random walk component is small.  Canova and Ferroni (2008) considered
12:456:28234:18:18:71:553:143:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:many filters and treat each as the true cyclical component measured with error.  They are primarily
12:457:28333:18:18:71:553:125:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:concerned with the consequences of data filtering taking the model specification as given.  We take
12:458:28432:18:0:71:553:107:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the view that the trends specified for the model should be consistent with the facts that we sought to
13:459:28536:0:30:72:290:699:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:explain.  As such, it cannot be taken as given.
13:460:28583:30:29:72:248:669:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:C:5    Simulations:  Baseline Model
13:461:28616:29:18:72:554:640:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In this section we use the stochastic growth model to conduct Monte Carlo experiments.  We generate
13:462:28715:18:18:72:553:622:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:data with either deterministic trends (ρz<1) or stochastic trends (ρz= 1) using the model equations
13:463:28814:18:18:71:553:604:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for̂mt.  The model variables are then rescaled back to level form and treated as observed datadt=
13:464:28911:18:18:71:554:586:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(ct,kt,yt,lt), which we take as given in estimation.  We use the variance and first order autocovariance
13:465:29015:18:18:71:554:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(including cross variances) of the four variables as moments.  Thus,M= 1.  We also experimented
13:466:29110:18:18:71:553:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with alternative choices of observed variables, such as excluding the capital stock series, and we found
13:467:29214:18:18:71:165:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:very similar results.
13:468:29235:18:18:88:554:514:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We estimate Θ = (α,ρ,σ) and treat parameters (β,δ,θ) as known.4We estimate only a handful
13:469:29324:18:18:72:554:496:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of  parameters  because  we  want  to  decouple  the  issues  related  to  the  treatment  of  trends  from  the
13:470:29436:18:17:72:554:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:identification issues that might arise.  We calibrate the model as follows:  capital intensityα= 0.33;
13:471:29538:17:18:71:554:461:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:disutility of laborθ= 1;  discount factorβ= 0.99;  depreciation rateδ= 0.1;  gross growth rate in
13:472:29635:18:18:72:554:443:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:technology  ̄g=  ̄γ= 1.005.  We restrict the admissible range of the estimates ofαto [0.01,0.99].  We
13:473:29736:18:18:72:554:425:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:vary  the  persistence  parameterρzto  take  values  (0.95,  0.99,  1).   We  have  only  one  shock  in  this
13:474:29846:18:18:72:554:407:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:baseline model.  Thus, we set the standard deviation ofezttoσz= 1 without loss of generality.  We
13:475:29943:18:18:72:554:389:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:perform 2,000 replications for each choice of parameter values.  In each replication, we create series
13:476:30045:18:18:72:386:371:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with T=200 observations.  Other sample sizes are also considered.
13:477:30110:18:18:88:553:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In all simulations and for all estimators, we set the starting values in optimization routines equal
13:478:30210:18:18:72:554:335:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to the true parameter values.  The model is solved using the Anderson and Moore (1985) algorithm.
13:479:30307:18:18:72:554:317:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We allow mildly explosive estimates as solutions for otherwisêρzwill be truncated to the right at one,
13:480:30410:18:18:72:554:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:making the distribution of̂ρzhighly skewed.  We only keep as solution those sets of estimates that are
13:481:30512:18:18:72:357:281:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:consistent with a unique rational expectations equilibrium.5
13:482:30572:18:18:88:553:263:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We report simulation results for the baseline neoclassical growth model in Table 2.  The persistence
13:483:30672:18:18:71:553:245:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of  technology  shocks  is  given  in  the  left  column.   The  first  and  second  rows  indicate  which  filter
13:484:30786:18:18:71:553:227:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is  applied  to  both  the  data  and  the  model  variables.   Columns  (1)-(4)  report  results  for  the  four
13:485:30899:18:17:71:553:209:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimators.  By and large, all four filters yield estimates which are very close to the true values.  Notice
13:486:31007:17:18:71:553:192:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that whileρzis always precisely estimated, the variance of the estimates varies substantially across
13:487:31107:18:16:71:553:174:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:filters.  The QD estimates has the lowest standard deviation while the HP estimates are two to five
13:488:31206:16:11:84:522:158:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:4The average growth rate  ̄gis estimated in the preliminary step when we project series on linear time trend.
13:489:31315:11:15:84:554:147:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:5A rational expectations solution is said to be stable if the number of unstable eigenvalues of the system equals the
13:490:31432:15:11:72:554:132:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:number  of forward looking variables.   Stability  in this  context refers  to the  internal  dynamics of  the system.   This is
13:491:31560:11:11:72:554:121:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:distinct from covariance stationarity of the time series data, which obtains whenρz<1.  It is possible forρzto be mildly
13:492:31680:11:0:72:410:110:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:explosive and yet the system has a stable, unique rational expectations equilibrium.
14:493:31766:0:18:72:554:699:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:times more variable than the QD. The HD is more precise than the FD but is less precise than the
14:494:31862:18:18:72:302:681:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:QD. This pattern is recurrent in all simulations.
14:495:31911:18:18:88:553:663:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 1 shows the root mean squared error (RMSE) for different estimators and sample sizes.  The
14:496:32008:18:18:72:554:645:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:QD estimator performs the best while the FD tends to have the largest RMSE in almost all cases.
14:497:32103:18:18:72:554:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The performance of the HP estimator varies with sample size.  In small samples, the HP tends to lead
14:498:32203:18:18:72:554:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to large RMSE while in larger samples, the HP approaches the HD which is only slightly inferior to
14:499:32301:18:18:72:111:591:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the QD.
14:500:32308:18:0:88:482:573:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Figures  2  through  4  present  the  kernel  density  of  the  normalized  estimator  (ie.
14:501:32399:0:9:492:501:582:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:C:√
14:502:32400:9:18:501:554:573:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:A:T(̂Θ−Θ))
14:503:32408:18:18:72:554:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for sample sizes ofT=150 and 300.  Results are also reported for T=2000 to study the asymptotic
14:504:32503:18:18:72:554:537:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:properties of the estimators. Approximate normality of̂ρzwhenρzis close to one, is totally unexpected,
14:505:32605:18:18:72:554:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:given that the literature on integrated regressors prepared us to expect super consistent estimators with
14:506:32710:18:18:72:554:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Dickey-Fuller type distributions that are skewed.  Instead, all densities are bell-shaped and symmetric
14:507:32813:18:18:72:554:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for allρz≤1 with no apparent discontinuity as we increaseρzto one.  The normal approximation is
14:508:32908:18:17:72:554:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:not perfect in small samples, suggesting that some size distortion will occur if we use thetstatistic for
14:509:33013:17:18:72:554:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:inference.  In results not reported, we constructt-statistics using Newey-West standard errors and find
14:510:33116:18:18:72:554:430:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that the rejection rates tend to be greater than the nominal size for all estimators except the HP, which
14:511:33221:18:18:72:553:412:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f8:B:can be undersized.  For example, the rejection rate of the QD estimator for the two-sided t-test ofρz
14:512:33322:18:18:72:554:394:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:at the true value of 1 is 0.055 when T=200 while for testingαat the true value of 0.33, the rejection
14:513:33423:18:18:72:554:376:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rate is 0.21.  This is larger than the nominal size of 0.05.  As the sample size increases,  the actual
14:514:33526:18:18:72:554:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:size gets closer (and eventually converges) to the nominal rates.  For example, at T=1000 for QD, the
14:515:33627:18:18:72:554:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:two-sided t-test ofρz= 1 has a rejection rate of 0.05, while thettest forα=.33 is 0.10.  The QD and
14:516:33726:18:18:71:553:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:HD generally have better size than the FD and the HP. The finite sample size distortion seems to be
14:517:33825:18:18:71:553:304:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a general problem with covariance structure estimators and not specific to the estimator we consider.
14:518:33926:18:18:71:553:286:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Burnside and Eichenbaum (1996) reported similar results in covariance structure estimation with as
14:519:34024:18:18:71:553:268:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:many overidentifying restrictions as we have, and also using the Newey-West estimator of the variance
14:520:34125:18:29:71:129:250:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of moments.
14:521:34136:29:25:71:281:221:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:C:5.1    Variations to the Baseline Model
14:522:34175:25:17:71:553:196:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In response to the finding in Cogley and Nason (1995b) that the basic real business cycle model has
14:523:34274:17:18:71:553:179:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:weak internal propagation, researchers often augment the basic model to strengthen the propagation
14:524:34372:18:18:71:553:161:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and  to  better  fit  the  data  at  business  cycle  frequencies.   One  consideration  is  to  introduce  serial
14:525:34486:18:18:71:554:143:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:correlation in the growth rate of shocks to technology by assumingut= (ρz+κ)ut−1−κρzut−2+ezt.
14:526:34579:18:18:72:554:125:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:This specification generates serial correlation ofκin the growth rate of technology whenρz≈1.  Our
14:527:34677:18:0:71:553:107:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:baseline model corresponds toκ= 0.  When we simulate data withκ= 0 and estimateκfreely, the
15:528:34770:0:18:72:394:699:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:QD, HD, FD, and HP correctly find thatκ= 0 (Table 3, Panel A).
15:529:34832:18:18:88:553:681:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Habit in consumption is another popular way to introduce greater persistence in business cycle
15:530:34926:18:18:71:554:663:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:models.  Consider the utility function:θ(Ct,Ct−1,Lt) = ln(Ct−φCt−1)−θLtwhereφmeasures the
15:531:35015:18:18:72:554:645:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:degree of habit in consumption. We setφ= 0 and estimateφalong with other parameters to investigate
15:532:35113:18:18:72:554:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:how the treatment of the trends might affect estimates of this internal propagation mechanism.  The
15:533:35212:18:18:72:554:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:robust estimators again find̂φto be numerically small and not statistically from zero for all values of
15:534:35315:18:18:72:178:591:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:B:ρz(Table 3, Panel B).
15:535:35336:18:18:88:554:573:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We also augment our baseline model with a preference shockQtsuch that the utility isθ(Ct,Lt) =
15:536:35430:18:18:72:553:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:lnCt−θLt/Qtwhereqt= lnQt=ρqqt−1+eqtandeqt∼iid(0,σ2q).  In our simulations, we setρq= 0.8
15:537:35518:18:18:72:553:537:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:so  that  the  preference  shock  is  stationary.   We  letσq=  (0.5,1.0,1.5).   To  conserve  space,  we  only
15:538:35629:18:18:72:554:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:report estimates forαin Table 3, Panel C. Consistent with the results thus far, the HP estimates have
15:539:35730:18:18:72:554:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the largest variability although the difference with other estimators is not as large as it was in the
15:540:35832:18:18:72:554:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:baseline model.  Note that as we increaseσq, the difference across methods shrinks while the precision
15:541:35934:18:17:72:202:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for all estimators improves.
15:542:35962:17:18:88:553:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:A recurrent result is that the HP estimates have the largest variability.  One possibility is that the
15:543:36064:18:18:72:554:430:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:HP filters out more low frequency variation than other filters, and the parametersφandκare identified
15:544:36165:18:18:72:554:412:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from these frequencies (see also discussion in Burnside (1998)).  Another possibility is that the HP
15:545:36265:18:18:72:554:394:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:implicitly uses estimated autocovariances at many more lags than other filters (recall that we apply the
15:546:36369:18:18:72:554:376:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:inverse Fourier transform to many autocovariances).  This extensive use of sample autocovariances can
15:547:36470:18:18:72:554:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:also introduce variability to the estimator.  In addition, we find that HP is much more computationally
15:548:36573:18:30:72:257:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:intensive than other robust estimators.

15:550:36675:29:18:72:554:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In this section, we report results of the non-robust estimators applied to different models to illustrate
15:551:36780:18:18:72:554:263:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:how  treatment  of  trends  can  lead  to  misleading  conclusions  about  the  propagating  mechanism  of
15:552:36886:18:28:72:521:245:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:shocks.  We also compare the estimators using a model with many more endogenous variables.
15:553:36976:28:25:72:294:217:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:C:6.1    Alternative Detrending Procedures
15:554:37016:25:18:72:554:192:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Up to this point, we have considered approaches where the same transformation is applied to the data
15:555:37116:18:18:72:554:174:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and the model variables.  Much has been written about the effects of filtering on business cycle facts.
15:556:37219:18:18:72:554:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:King and Rebelo (1993) and Canova (1998) showed that the HP filtered data are qualitatively different
15:557:37320:18:18:72:554:138:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from the raw data.  Canova (1998) showed that the stylized facts of business cycles are sensitive to the
15:558:37424:18:18:72:554:120:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:filter used to remove the trending components.  Gregory and Smith (1996) used a calibrated business
15:559:37523:18:0:72:554:102:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cycle model to investigate what type of trend can produce a cyclical component in the data that is
16:560:37623:0:18:72:554:699:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:similar to the cyclical component in the model.  Although these authors did not estimate a DSGE
16:561:37718:18:18:72:554:681:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:model on filtered data, they hinted that the estimates of the structural parameters can be adversely
16:562:37818:18:18:72:167:663:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:affected by filtering.
16:563:37840:18:18:88:553:645:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We now investigate the consequences of using different and/or inappropriate filters by considering
16:564:37938:18:27:72:161:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:four combinations:
16:565:37956:27:27:81:482:600:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:A)  The autocovariances are computed for linearly detrended model and data series;
16:566:38038:27:18:81:554:573:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:B)  The autocovariances are computed for the first differenced model and data series with imposed
16:567:38135:18:27:99:132:555:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:A:ρz= 1;
16:568:38141:27:18:81:554:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:C)  The sample autocovariances are computed for HP filtered data but the model autocovariances
16:569:38235:18:27:99:338:510:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:are computed for the linearly detrended variables;
16:570:38285:27:18:81:554:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:D)  The sample autocovariances are computed for HP filtered data.  The model autocovariances are
16:571:38381:18:17:99:554:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:computed for series normalized by the level of technology, i.e.,mt−ztwhereztis the level of
16:572:38472:17:27:99:152:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:technology.
16:573:38483:27:18:71:553:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Each combination has been used in the literature (see e.g.  Table 1).  (A) and (B) are aimed to show the
16:574:38587:18:18:71:553:403:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:effects of imposing incorrect assumptions about trends.  (C) and (D) illustrate the consequences when
16:575:38688:18:18:71:553:385:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:different trends are applied to the model and the data.  As a general observation, the starting values
16:576:38790:18:18:71:553:367:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are very important for non-robust methods as the optimization routines can get stuck in local optima.
16:577:38891:18:18:71:553:349:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:With the robust estimators, the converged estimates do not change as we start the optimization from
16:578:38990:18:18:71:517:331:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:values other than the true parameters, though the search for global minimum was often long.
16:579:39081:18:18:88:553:313:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The results are reported in Table 2.  For (A), which is reported in column (5), we see that when
16:580:39177:18:18:71:554:295:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:B:ρz= 0.95,  the parameter estimates are slightly biased.  Asρzincreases,  the estimates are strongly
16:581:39276:18:18:71:554:277:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:biased.  This shows that whenρzis close to unity yet stationary, assuming trend stationarity still yields
16:582:39381:18:18:71:554:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:imprecise estimates.  Atρz= 1, the mean of̂ρzis 0.694 (instead of 1), the mean of̂αis approximately
16:583:39480:18:18:71:553:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:0.905 (instead of 0.33), the mean of̂σzis 19.8 (instead of 1).  The case ofρz≤1 is empirically relevant
16:584:39583:18:18:71:553:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:because macroeconomic data are highly persistent and well approximated by unit root processes.  Our
16:585:39682:18:18:71:553:205:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:results  show  that  linear  detrending  of  nearly  integrated  data  in  non-linear  estimation  can  lead  to
16:586:39794:18:17:71:553:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:biased estimates of the structural parameters.  This resembles the univariate finding of Nelson and
16:587:39893:17:18:71:528:170:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Kang (1981) that projecting a series with a unit root on time trend can lead to spurious cycles.
16:588:39989:18:18:88:553:152:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f8:A:Turning to (B) in column (6) of Table 2, we find that while the estimates are fairly precise whenρz
16:589:40088:18:18:71:554:134:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is indeed equal to one, asρzdeparts from one, the estimates get increasingly biased.  Hence imposing
16:590:40188:18:18:71:553:116:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a stochastic trend when the data generating process is trend stationary can lead to seriously distorted
16:591:40291:18:0:71:554:98:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimates.  Results for combination (C) are reported in column (7) of Table 2.  The estimates ofρzare
17:592:40394:0:18:72:554:699:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:downward biased whilêαand̂σzare upward biased.  Taken at face value, these estimates suggest a
17:593:40489:18:18:72:451:681:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:significant role for capital as a mechanism for propagating shocks in the model.
17:594:40569:18:18:88:554:663:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Results  for  (D)  are  reported  in  column  (8)  of  Table  2.   Here,  the  estimates  ofαoften  hit  the
17:595:40677:18:18:72:553:645:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f8:B:boundary of the permissible space while estimates ofσzare close to zero.  The reason is that whenzt
17:596:40776:18:18:71:554:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:has a unit root, shocks tomt−ztare transitory.  Thus, the endogenous variables such as consumption
17:597:40874:18:18:71:553:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:adjust quickly to the permanent technology shock.  But the HP filtered data are serially correlated.
17:598:40974:18:18:71:553:591:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Thus, the estimator is forced to produce parameter values that can generate a strong serial correlation
17:599:41077:18:18:71:553:573:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the model variables.  Results for (C) and (D) are consistent with the findings of Cogley and Nason
17:600:41178:18:18:71:553:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(1995a), King and Rebelo (1993) and Harvey and Jaeger (1993).  These papers suggest that the HP
17:601:41273:18:18:71:553:537:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:filter changes not only the persistence of the series but also the relative volatility and serial correlation
17:602:41382:18:18:71:553:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of the series.  This translates into biased estimates of all parameters because the estimator is forced
17:603:41485:18:18:71:312:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to match the serial correlation of the filtered data.
17:604:41538:18:18:88:553:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Clearly,  the  large  estimates  ofαwill  alert  the  researcher  that  the  model  is  likely  misspecified.
17:605:41647:18:17:71:554:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f7:B:Suppose  the  researcher  allows  for  serially  correlated  shocks  in  technology  growth  by  estimatingκ
17:606:41755:17:18:71:554:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:freely.  Panel A, Table 3 shows that the non-robust methods now yield estimates ofαaround 0.4-0.5,
17:607:41853:18:18:71:554:430:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:which seem more plausible than whenκwas assumed zero.  However, these estimates are achieved by
17:608:41948:18:18:71:554:412:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:havinĝκstrongly negative and statistically significant when the true value is zero.  Suppose now the
17:609:42049:18:18:71:553:394:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:researcher modifies the model by allowing for habits in consumption.  Evidently, the estimated habit
17:610:42149:18:18:71:554:376:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:formation parameterφis sensitive to which non-robust estimator is used.  In particular,  (A) has a
17:611:42247:18:18:71:554:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:strong downward bias, while (B) produces a negative bias in̂φwhenρzdeparts from one.  On the other
17:612:42345:18:18:71:553:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:hand, (C) and (D) have a strong upward bias.  With either modification, the fit of the misspecified
17:613:42444:18:18:71:553:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:models improves relative to the correctly specified model.  However,  these modifications should not
17:614:42544:18:18:71:553:304:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:have been undertaken as they do not exist in the data generating process.  These examples indicate
17:615:42642:18:18:71:553:286:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:how the treatment of trends can mislead the researcher to augment correctly specified models with
17:616:42739:18:18:71:402:268:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:spurious propagation mechanisms to match the moments of the data.
17:617:42804:18:18:88:553:250:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Results for the model with an additional labor supply shock are reported in Table 3, Panel C. The
17:618:42901:18:18:71:553:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimates  continue  to  be  biased  although  the  biases  tend  to  be  smaller  than  in  the  baseline  model
17:619:43014:18:18:71:554:214:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with a single persistent shock.  In general, a smallerρzand a largerσqlead to smaller biases.  In some
17:620:43116:18:17:71:554:196:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cases, we find̂σq>̂σz, so that the researcher may be tempted to conclude that preference shocks have
17:621:43216:17:29:71:400:179:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:larger volatility than shocks to technology while the opposite is true.
17:622:43287:29:25:71:271:150:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:C:6.2    The Smets and Wouters Model
17:623:43321:25:18:71:553:125:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Although the baseline model is an illuminating laboratory to evaluate how the estimators work, it is
17:624:43421:18:0:71:553:107:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:overly simplistic.  We now consider the model of Smets and Wouters (2007) (henceforth SW). We use
18:625:43520:0:18:72:554:699:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:SW’s estimates for the post-1982 sample as the true values.  We then simulate series of size T=150
18:626:43618:18:18:72:554:681:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and apply the estimators to the simulated series.  To separate identification issues from issues related
18:627:43722:18:18:72:553:663:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f8:B:to  the  treatment  of  trends,  we  estimate  only  four  parameters:  persistence  of  technology  shocksρz
18:628:43831:18:18:72:554:645:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:whose  true  value  varies  across  simulations,  investment  adjustment  costφwhose  true  value  is  5.48,
18:629:43939:18:18:72:553:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:external habit formation in consumptionλwhose true value is 0.71, and Calvo’s probability of wage
18:630:44036:18:18:72:261:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:adjustmentξwwhose true value is 0.73.
18:631:44073:18:18:88:553:591:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The results are reported in Table 4.  All robust methods yield precise estimates of the parameters.
18:632:44172:18:18:72:554:573:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Although the HP continues to be less precise, the difference with the other three robust estimators is
18:633:44274:18:18:72:554:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:smaller than in the baseline model.  This is similar to what we observed when we compare the two-
18:634:44371:18:18:72:554:537:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:shock and one-shock neoclassical growth models.  These differences between the baseline and the more
18:635:44471:18:18:72:554:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:complicated models can occur for several reasons.  First, the SW model has six other structural shocks
18:636:44573:18:18:72:554:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:so that technology shocks explain only a fraction of variation in key macroeconomic variables.  The HP
18:637:44675:18:18:72:554:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimator may simply need more shocks to identify the parameters.  Second, the SW model imposes
18:638:44770:18:17:72:554:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:many  cross  equation  restrictions  on  the  handful  of  the  parameters  we  estimate.   These  restrictions
18:639:44881:17:18:72:554:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:may improve the efficiency of some estimators more than others.  Third, some estimators may be more
18:640:44980:18:18:72:554:430:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sensitive to the size of the model than others.  The general observation, however, is that our robust
18:641:45081:18:18:72:507:412:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimators perform reasonably well for all values ofρzin simple and more complex models.
18:642:45169:18:18:88:553:394:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In contrast, the non-robust estimators (A) through (D) have dramatic biases in all four parameters
18:643:45267:18:18:72:554:376:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:being estimated when (i) the filter used for the model and the data are different, when (ii) the assumed
18:644:45371:18:18:72:554:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:trends are different from trends in the data generating process, or when (iii) the data are stationary
18:645:45473:18:18:72:554:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:but highly persistent.  Obviously, the impulse responses (and other analyses about the role of rigidities
18:646:45578:18:18:72:554:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in amplification and propagation of shocks in business cycle models) based on these biased estimates
18:647:45678:18:18:72:554:304:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of the structural parameters will be misleading.  As an illustration, Figure 5 highlights the difference
18:648:45782:18:18:72:554:286:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:between the true response of key macroeconomic variables to a technology shock in the SW model and
18:649:45880:18:18:72:554:268:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the responses based on parameter estimates from approaches (A) through (D). For instance, consider
18:650:45978:18:18:72:554:250:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the  response  of  consumption.   Estimates  from  approaches  (A)  and  (C)  imply  grossly  understated
18:651:46083:18:18:72:554:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:responses.  Estimates from approach (D) suggest a considerably more delayed consumption response

19:662:46718:18:23:88:422:545:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Suppose there areJunivariate shock processes, each characterized by

19:669:46887:29:18:71:554:439:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Now the quasi-differencing operator is the product of theJ∗polynomials in lag operator.  For example,

19:675:47362:25:18:71:553:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:As likelihood and Bayesian estimation is commonly used in the DSGE literature, one may wonder how
19:676:47459:18:18:71:553:296:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the ideas considered in this paper can be implemented in likelihood based estimation.  Conceptually,
19:677:47559:18:18:71:553:278:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:if  we  can  write  the  model  in  a  state  space  form,  we  can  specify  the  likelihood  which  makes  MLE
19:678:47671:18:18:71:553:260:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and Bayesian estimation possible.  This involves using the measurement equations to establish a strict

20:725:48427:18:18:72:554:620:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimators, the treatment of initial condition is important especially when there is strong persistence.
20:726:48531:18:17:72:554:602:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In simulations, we condition on the first observation being fixed and find that the MLE version of the
20:727:48633:17:18:72:554:585:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:FD gives precise estimates, but thetstatistics are less well approximated by the normal distribution
20:728:48733:18:18:72:247:567:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:compared to MM-FD (see Figure 6).
20:729:48766:18:18:88:553:549:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:For the other three estimators, the extension to MLE is either not possible or not practical.  For
20:730:48864:18:18:72:554:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:MLE-HP, we would need to write out the entire data density of the HP filtered data, and the Jacobian
20:731:48964:18:18:72:554:513:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:transformation from the unfiltered to filtered data involves an infinite dimensional matrix.  For the QD
20:732:49068:18:18:72:554:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimator, recall that we normalized the autocovariances by the variance in constructing the QD. By
20:733:49167:18:18:72:554:477:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:analogy, MLE-QD would require modifying the score vector.  Although such modification is possible in
20:734:49267:18:18:72:554:459:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:theory, it is beyond the scope of this paper.  We leave this promising idea for future research.  For the
20:735:49372:18:18:72:554:441:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:HD estimator, the MLE implementation is cumbersome because HD exploits covariances of variables
20:736:49467:18:18:72:554:423:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:computed with different filters.  The difference between the MM and MLE really boils down to a choice
20:737:49568:18:29:72:382:405:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:of moments, and the MM is more straightforward to implement.6

20:765:50245:16:15:84:554:155:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:6One practical drawback of GMM is perhaps that when many parameters have to be estimated, the objective function
20:766:50357:15:11:72:554:140:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:can be ill behaved which frustrates convergence.  However,  Chernozhukov and Hong (2003) suggest a novel approach
20:767:50470:11:11:72:554:129:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:by which GMM can take advantage of MCMC methods.  Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2008) use Chernozhukov-Hong’s

21:775:51133:18:28:72:165:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:obtained as follows:

21:780:51207:30:18:72:554:497:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In practice, usingHP+(L) and the autocovariances for ∆dtand ∆̂mttend to give more stable results

21:782:51403:18:18:71:553:461:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:smaller number of leads and lags. This modification however would deteriorate the HP’s approximation
21:783:51503:18:33:71:293:443:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:to the desired filter removing low frequencies.8
21:784:51551:33:18:72:554:410:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f2:B:Treatment of stationary variablesRecall that in the stochastic growth model,m∗t= ( ̄gt, ̄gt,0)
21:785:51645:18:18:72:553:392:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:when|ρz|<1 andm∗t= (ut+  ̄gt,ut+  ̄gt,0) when|ρz|= 1, where the third component ofm∗tis the trend

21:787:51842:18:18:71:554:356:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are computed forltand not̂lt, though the results do not change materially if we had filtered these
21:788:51940:18:18:71:554:338:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:series as well.  In general, if thej-th component ofm∗tis zero, it is understood that the autocovariances
21:789:52045:18:18:71:553:320:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are computed for the level of the variable both in the model and in the data.  An alternative is to
21:790:52144:18:18:71:553:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:deal with these non-trending variables through the measurement equation.  Then some variables can
21:791:52241:18:30:71:450:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:be quasi-differenced or first-differenced, while others require no transformation.
21:792:52323:30:28:71:204:254:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:C:8    Concluding Remarks
21:793:52346:28:18:71:553:226:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:A realistic situation encountered with estimation of DSGE model is that (a) the data are trending; (b)
21:794:52448:18:18:71:553:208:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:deviations from the trend are persistent; (c) the researcher does not know whether the data generating
21:795:52550:18:18:71:553:190:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:process is difference or trend stationary.  We document that the treatment of trends can significantly
21:796:52652:18:16:71:553:172:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:affect the parameter estimates of DSGE models and propose several robust approaches that produce
21:797:52748:16:15:84:554:156:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:7Since parts ofwtmay be exploding, we found that it useful to limit the size of elements in the covariance matrix
21:798:52861:15:11:72:553:141:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:Ω(i)w(0) by a fixed large number.  This introduces an error in the calculated moments ofxtbut we found that this error
21:799:52979:11:7:72:167:130:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:is negligible in practice.
21:800:53005:7:15:84:554:123:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:8We also experimented with a simulation procedure.  For each Θ, we use the model to generatej= 1,...,Rsamples
21:801:53114:15:10:72:554:108:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:of sizeT.  For eachjwe computed moments.  Then we average the moments overjand use this average forωmHP.  This
21:802:53224:10:0:71:470:98:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:procedure is computationally more intensive and the results are similar to the one considered here.
22:803:53325:0:18:72:554:699:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:precise  estimates  without  the  researcher  having  to  take  a  stand  of  trend  specification.   The  key  is
22:804:53439:18:18:72:554:681:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to apply the same filter to the data and the model variables to yield well-defined moments for the
22:805:53537:18:18:72:554:663:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimation  of  the  structural  parameters.   We  consider  several  filters  that  can  be  used  in  methods
22:806:53648:18:18:72:554:645:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of  moments  estimation,  and  the  estimators  have  approximately  normal  finite  sample  distributions.
22:807:53755:18:18:72:553:627:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:Undoubtedly,  the  estimators  require  further  scrutiny  and  can  be  improved  in  various  dimensions.9
22:808:53863:18:18:71:553:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Our analysis is a first step in the sparse literature on non-linear estimation when the data are highly

22:835:55671:16:15:84:554:156:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:9For example, one can use the bootstrap developed for covariance structures in Horowitz (1998) to correct for small-
22:836:55787:15:11:72:554:141:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:sample biases because the asymptotic distribution of the t-statistic is normal.  One might also consider a model-based
22:837:55905:11:11:72:554:130:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:weighting matrix computed as follows.  Given a set of parameters, simulate the model to generate series and compute the
22:838:56024:11:11:72:554:119:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:moments.  By repeating this many times, we can compute covariance of simulated moments rather than the Newey-West
22:839:56137:11:10:72:554:108:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:estimates.  Results in Burnside and Eichenbaum (1996) suggest that using a relatively small number of moments and as
