2:29:1512:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:We use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 cohort to examine mismatch between student
2:30:1608:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:ability and college quality. Mismatch has implications for the design of state higher education systems
2:31:1711:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:and for student aid policy. The data indicate substantial amounts of both undermatch (high ability
2:32:1809:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:students at low quality colleges) and overmatch (low ability students at high quality colleges). Student
2:33:1913:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:application and enrollment decisions, rather than college admission decisions, drive most mismatch.
2:34:2012:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:Financial constraints, information, and the public college options facing each student all affect the
2:35:2113:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:probability of mismatch. More informed students attend higher quality colleges, even when doing
2:36:2208:14:42:72:198:490:12:Times:12:Times:so involves overmatching.

3:54:2606:0:20:108:187:672:144:Times:144:Times:I. Introduction 
3:55:2622:20:21:108:507:652:144:Times:144:Times:Students graduating high school in the U.S. can choose to apply to and enroll in a 
3:56:2705:21:20:108:508:631:144:Times:144:Times:wide  variety  of  colleges.  In  this  paper,  we  investigate  how  students  of  varying  
3:57:2798:20:21:107:508:611:144:Times:144:Times:abilities  sort  into  colleges   of  different  qualities,  with  a  particular  focus  on  high  
3:58:2897:21:21:108:507:590:144:Times:144:Times:ability  students  who  choose  to  attend  relatively  low  quality  colleges  and  low 
3:59:2985:21:21:108:507:569:144:Times:144:Times:ability students who attend relatively high quality colleges. The literature refers to 
3:60:3072:21:20:108:509:548:144:Times:144:Times:these  choices  as  “undermatch”  (think  “underachiever”)  and  “overmatch”  (think  
3:61:3158:20:21:108:512:528:144:Times:144:Times:“overachiever”),   respectively.   While   we   follow   the   literature   in   using   the   
3:62:3253:21:21:108:509:507:144:Times:144:Times:normatively  loaded  language  of  mismatch,  we  do  not  take  a  stand  here  on  the  
3:63:3343:21:20:108:508:486:144:Times:144:Times:causal  effects  of  mismatch.  Instead,  we  empirically  investigate  the  determinants  
3:64:3434:20:21:108:507:466:144:Times:144:Times:of  undermatch  and  overmatch  using  data  on  a  recent  cohort  of  college-goers, 
3:65:3521:21:21:108:510:445:144:Times:144:Times:interpreting  our  results  within  the  context  of  an  informal  economic  model  of  
3:66:3610:21:20:108:186:424:144:Times:144:Times:college choice.  
3:67:3626:20:21:144:507:404:144:Times:144:Times:In our informal model, students face real tradeoffs between college quality 
3:68:3702:21:21:108:507:383:144:Times:144:Times:and cost due to state tuition policies at public universities and price discrimination 
3:69:3789:21:21:108:507:362:144:Times:144:Times:by private ones. They also worry about the potential benefits and costs of being a 
3:70:3872:21:20:107:506:341:144:Times:144:Times:relatively weak, or relatively strong, student at their college. A strong student at a 
3:71:3959:20:21:107:507:321:144:Times:144:Times:weak  school  may  stand  out  and  garner  extra  faculty  attention,  or  she  may  exert  
3:72:4052:21:21:107:507:300:144:Times:144:Times:less effort due to the bad study habits of her peers. A relatively weak student at a 
3:73:4137:21:20:108:508:279:144:Times:144:Times:strong school may benefit from the extra resources and the strong peers, but may 
3:74:4218:20:21:108:511:259:144:Times:144:Times:also  find  herself  overwhelmed  by  the  pace  of  instruction  and  the  level  of  
3:75:4305:21:21:108:511:238:144:Times:144:Times:performance   expected.   Students   also   care   about   dimensions   of   the   college   
3:76:4398:21:20:108:510:217:144:Times:144:Times:experience  other  than academics,  such  as  following  their  high  school  friends,  
3:77:4486:20:21:108:483:197:144:Times:144:Times:attending the same school as their parents, or having a religious environment. 
3:78:4565:21:21:144:507:176:144:Times:144:Times:We  study  the  sorting  of  students  to  colleges  that  results  from  students 
3:79:4648:21:21:108:507:155:144:Times:144:Times:making these tradeoffs, given the information and financial resources available to 
3:80:4731:21:0:108:507:134:144:Times:144:Times:them and to their families. These choices have important implications not only for 
4:81:4816:0:21:108:507:673:144:Times:144:Times:the students themselves but for the taxpayers who subsidize state universities and 
4:82:4899:21:21:108:337:652:144:Times:144:Times:pay for federal and state student aid programs.  
4:83:4948:21:20:108:506:631:144:Times:144:Times: Our  work  builds  on  existing  research  on  the  extent  and  determinants of 
4:84:5029:20:21:108:507:611:144:Times:144:Times:mismatch. Light and Strayer (2000, Table 4) and Black and Smith (2004, Table 4) 
4:85:5108:21:21:108:506:590:144:Times:144:Times:document  the  empirical  importance  of  both  overmatching  and  undermatching in 
4:86:5192:21:21:108:507:569:144:Times:144:Times:the earlier 1979 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. One line of 
4:87:5274:21:20:108:507:548:144:Times:144:Times:work considers overmatching resulting from affirmative action, e.g. Arcidiacono, 
4:88:5355:20:21:108:509:528:144:Times:144:Times:Aucejo  and  Spenner  (2012),  Bowen  and  Bok  (1998)  and  Sander  and  Taylor  
4:89:5437:21:21:108:508:507:144:Times:144:Times:(2012).  Another line  of  work  considers  undermatching,  focusing  specifically  on  
4:90:5525:21:20:108:507:486:144:Times:144:Times:application  behavior,  as  in  Avery  (2010), Griffith  and  Rothstein  (2009),  Howell 
4:91:5614:20:21:108:507:466:144:Times:144:Times:(2011) and Pallais (2012), or the recruiting efforts of elite colleges, as in Hill and 
4:92:5701:21:21:108:507:445:144:Times:144:Times:Winston (2010) and Hoxby and Avery (2012). Roderick et al. (2008) and Bowen, 
4:93:5778:21:20:108:506:424:144:Times:144:Times:Chingos  and  McPherson  (2009)  focus  on  the  entire  process,  including  college 
4:94:5864:20:21:108:509:404:144:Times:144:Times:completion.  The  literature  broadly  agrees  on  the  empirical  importance  of  both  
4:95:5953:21:21:108:506:383:144:Times:144:Times:overmatching  and  undermatching,  and  that  most  mismatch  results  from  where 
4:96:6036:21:21:108:508:362:144:Times:144:Times:students apply and where they attend conditional on acceptance, rather than from 
4:97:6117:21:20:108:507:341:144:Times:144:Times:rejection decisions by colleges. The literature does not agree on the effects, if any, 
4:98:6204:20:21:108:383:321:144:Times:144:Times:of mismatch on academic and/or labor market outcomes. 
4:99:6258:21:21:144:506:300:144:Times:144:Times:Relative to the existing literature, we make several contributions. First, we 
4:100:6336:21:20:108:507:279:144:Times:144:Times:study a nationally representative sample of college-goers from a relatively recent 
4:101:6419:20:21:108:510:259:144:Times:144:Times:cohort  using  the  data  from  the  National  Longitudinal  Survey  of  Youth  1997  
4:102:6505:21:21:108:509:238:144:Times:144:Times:cohort  (hereinafter  NLSY97). The  NLSY  data  have  many  advantages  for  our  
4:103:6587:21:20:108:507:217:144:Times:144:Times:purposes,  including  a  moderately  large  sample  and  a  variety  of  useful  covariates  
4:104:6680:20:21:108:508:197:144:Times:144:Times:including  student  demographics,  family  background  information  and  the  Armed  
4:105:6765:21:21:108:507:176:144:Times:144:Times:Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB). The restricted use data allow us 
4:106:6844:21:21:108:507:155:144:Times:144:Times:to match in contextual information on student’s high schools, on the census tract 
4:107:6925:21:20:108:509:134:144:Times:144:Times:in  which  they reside  when  making  the  college  choice and  on  the  state  college  
4:108:7014:20:0:108:507:114:144:Times:144:Times:system they face, as well as giving us data on what colleges they choose to attend.  
5:109:7101:0:21:108:508:673:144:Times:144:Times: Second,  we  use  a  different  and  arguably  superior  definition  of  mismatch  
5:110:7184:21:21:108:510:652:144:Times:144:Times:relative  to  other  studies.  Our  measure  focuses  on  the  difference  between  a  
5:111:7271:21:20:108:508:631:144:Times:144:Times:student’s  percentile  in  the  ability  distribution,  with  ability  defined  based  on  her  
5:112:7367:20:21:108:504:611:144:Times:144:Times:performance on the ASVAB tests, and the percentile of her college in the student-
5:113:7448:21:21:108:508:590:144:Times:144:Times:weighted  distribution  of  our  college  quality  index.  Third,  we  separately  analyze  
5:114:7540:21:21:108:509:569:144:Times:144:Times:the  determinants  of  undermatching  and  overmatching.  Fourth, we  look  at  both  
5:115:7626:21:20:108:507:548:144:Times:144:Times:application choices (though in less detail) and at the first college attended.  Fifth, 
5:116:7713:20:21:108:395:528:144:Times:144:Times:we consider three distinct measures of academic mismatch. 
5:117:7770:21:21:108:508:507:144:Times:144:Times: Our  approach  yields  several  important  findings.  We  find  that  substantial  
5:118:7853:21:20:108:509:486:144:Times:144:Times:fractions  of  students  are  both  undermatched  and  overmatched.  Perhaps  most  
5:119:7937:20:21:108:510:466:144:Times:144:Times:surprising  to  us,  student  decisions  drive  mismatch  in  almost  all  cases.  Most  
5:120:8026:21:21:108:507:445:144:Times:144:Times:students who mismatch either do not apply to a well-matched school or apply and 
5:121:8106:21:20:108:509:424:144:Times:144:Times:are admitted,  but  do  not  enroll.  Some  students appear  to  undermatch  due  to  
5:122:8192:20:21:108:507:404:144:Times:144:Times:financial constraints, as the probability of undermatch depends on parental wealth. 
5:123:8276:21:21:108:509:383:144:Times:144:Times:However,  many of  the  factors  we  examine  affect  the  quality  of  the college  a  
5:124:8364:21:21:108:507:362:144:Times:144:Times:student attends regardless of her ability, rather than affecting mismatch. Students 
5:125:8448:21:20:108:507:341:144:Times:144:Times:from the wealthiest families, from neighborhoods where many adults have college 
5:126:8528:20:21:108:509:321:144:Times:144:Times:degrees,  and  from  high  schools  where  many  students  go  on  to  college  are  less  
5:127:8619:21:21:108:508:300:144:Times:144:Times:likely to be undermatched but also more likely to be overmatched. This suggests 
5:128:8699:21:20:108:509:279:144:Times:144:Times:that  more  informed  students  think  that  the  benefits  of  improved  college  quality  
5:129:8791:20:21:108:508:259:144:Times:144:Times:associated  with  overmatch  overshadow  any  negative  effects.  Finally, features  of  
5:130:8880:21:21:108:508:238:144:Times:144:Times:the  state  university  system  facing  the  student affect  the  probability  of  mismatch.  
5:131:8974:21:20:108:508:217:144:Times:144:Times:In  particular,  having  a  well-matched  public  university  within  50  miles  decreases  
5:132:9066:20:21:108:312:197:144:Times:144:Times:the probability of both types of mismatch. 
5:133:9108:21:21:144:509:176:144:Times:144:Times:The  remainder  of  the  paper  unfolds  as  follows:  In  the  next  section  we  
5:134:9191:21:21:108:510:155:144:Times:144:Times:outline an  informal  model  of  how  students  and  their  families  decide  which  
5:135:9276:21:0:108:508:134:144:Times:144:Times:colleges  to  attend.    Section  III  describes  our  data  and  Section  IV  describes  our  
6:136:9373:0:21:108:508:673:144:Times:144:Times:measures of  student  ability,  college  quality  and  mismatch.  Sections  V  and  VI  
6:137:9461:21:21:108:388:652:144:Times:144:Times:present our empirical findings and Section VII concludes.

6:139:9519:21:20:108:312:610:144:Times:144:Times:II. College choice and college mismatch 
6:140:9558:20:21:108:511:590:144:Times:144:Times:This  section  provides  the  informal  theoretical  framework  within  which  we  
6:141:9641:21:21:108:510:569:144:Times:144:Times:interpret  our  results. Our  informal  model  draws  most  heavily  on  the  formal  
6:142:9727:21:20:108:509:548:144:Times:144:Times:models  in  Light  and  Strayer  (2000),  Arcidiacono  (2004)  and  Stinebrickner  and  
6:143:9815:20:21:107:216:528:144:Times:144:Times:Stinebrickner (2012).  
6:144:9837:21:21:143:506:507:144:Times:144:Times:In reality, the process by which students are sorted into schools has several 
6:145:9915:21:20:107:507:486:144:Times:144:Times:stages  and  involves  choices  by  both  the  student  and  the  school. The  student  first  
6:146:10010:20:21:108:509:466:144:Times:144:Times:decides  which  colleges  to  apply  to,  then  the  colleges  decide  which  students  to  
6:147:10102:21:21:108:508:445:144:Times:144:Times:admit,  and  finally  the  student  chooses  among  her  offers  of  admission.  Students  
6:148:10193:21:20:108:507:424:144:Times:144:Times:then enroll in their chosen college, learn more about their fit with that college, and 
6:149:10280:20:21:108:507:404:144:Times:144:Times:may  decide  to  transfer  to  a  different  college  or  to  drop  out  altogether. Our 
6:150:10369:21:21:108:509:383:144:Times:144:Times:discussion  and  empirical  work  implicitly  collapse  the  first  three stages  into  a  
6:151:10460:21:21:108:509:362:144:Times:144:Times:single  choice  by  the  student;  we  argue  in  Section  V  that  the  data  support  this  
6:152:10554:21:20:108:180:341:144:Times:144:Times:simplification. 
6:153:10569:20:21:144:507:321:144:Times:144:Times:We  assume  rational  and  forward-looking college  applicants.  Even  among  
6:154:10647:21:21:108:507:300:144:Times:144:Times:such applicants, we expect some students to end up at colleges that do not match 
6:155:10728:21:20:108:507:279:144:Times:144:Times:their abilities for a variety of reasons, including information constraints, financial 
6:156:10815:20:21:108:509:259:144:Times:144:Times:constraints,  and  social  considerations,  such  as  where  their  high  school  friends  
6:157:10906:21:21:108:509:238:144:Times:144:Times:choose  to  attend. Lack  of  information  on  the  part  of  either  the  student  or  the  
6:158:10999:21:20:108:507:217:144:Times:144:Times:school could increase the probability of both types of mismatch. The student may 
6:159:11080:20:21:108:509:197:144:Times:144:Times:not  have  complete  information  about  the  quality  of  different  colleges,  or  about  
6:160:11172:21:21:108:510:176:144:Times:144:Times:how  her  abilities  compare  with  other  college  applicants.  We  expect  that,  on  
6:161:11260:21:21:108:507:155:144:Times:144:Times:average, students with more educated parents, from better educated and better off 
6:162:11342:21:20:107:503:134:144:Times:144:Times:neighborhoods, and  who  attend  high  schools  where  more  students  enroll  in  a  4-
6:163:11430:20:0:107:456:114:144:Times:144:Times:year college will have better information to guide their college choices.  
7:164:11506:0:21:144:508:673:144:Times:144:Times:If  informed  students  prefer  colleges  at  which  they  are  well-matched  then  
7:165:11590:21:21:107:509:652:144:Times:144:Times:access  to  information  should  lower  the  probability  of  mismatching  in  either  
7:166:11677:21:20:107:508:631:144:Times:144:Times:direction.    However,  students  may  believe,  perhaps  correctly,  that  the  positive  
7:167:11768:20:21:107:508:611:144:Times:144:Times:effects  of  a  higher  quality  college  outweigh  any  effects  of  overmatching  or  that  
7:168:11862:21:21:107:508:590:144:Times:144:Times:the  positive  effects  of  being  a  big  fish  in  a  small  pond  outweigh  any  negative  
7:169:11956:21:21:107:508:569:144:Times:144:Times:effects  of  undermatching.    In  this  case,  students  with  better  information  about  
7:170:12048:21:20:107:506:548:144:Times:144:Times:college  may  be  more  likely  to  mismatch  in  whichever  direction  they  perceive  as 
7:171:12138:20:21:107:507:528:144:Times:144:Times:optimal. In contrast, in the spirit of Manski (1989), relatively uninformed students 
7:172:12223:21:21:107:506:507:144:Times:144:Times:might try out a college for which they are undermatched or overmatched partly in 
7:173:12304:21:20:107:304:486:144:Times:144:Times:order to learn about their optimal match. 
7:174:12346:20:21:143:508:466:144:Times:144:Times:A student’s application  may  be a poor signal of her actual ability  for two 
7:175:12424:21:21:107:511:445:144:Times:144:Times:reasons.    It  may  randomly  misstate  her  ability  if,  for  example,  she had  a  
7:176:12511:21:20:107:511:424:144:Times:144:Times:particularly   good   or   bad   day   on   the   SAT.   Students   may   also   attempt   to   
7:177:12607:20:21:107:506:404:144:Times:144:Times:strategically  misstate  their  ability  with  the  help  of  SAT  tutors  and  pricey 
7:178:12694:21:21:107:509:383:144:Times:144:Times:admissions  consultants.    If  a  college  misinterprets  the  student’s  ability  it  may  
7:179:12787:21:21:107:507:362:144:Times:144:Times:admit her to a school for which she is ill-prepared or reject her from a school that 
7:180:12872:21:20:107:185:341:144:Times:144:Times:would suit her.  
7:181:12889:20:21:143:506:321:144:Times:144:Times:In a basic framework where students make (what they perceive to be) the 
7:182:12961:21:21:107:506:300:144:Times:144:Times:best college match they can subject to their (and their family’s) budget, financial 
7:183:13044:21:20:107:511:279:144:Times:144:Times:constraints   will   tend   to   push   students   toward   schools   for   which   they   are   
7:184:13141:20:21:107:506:259:144:Times:144:Times:undermatched, because more elite schools tend to be more expensive. In practice, 
7:185:13222:21:21:107:508:238:144:Times:144:Times:for  strong  students  from  low-income  families  the  extra  cost  of  a  top  school  is  
7:186:13315:21:20:107:508:217:144:Times:144:Times:largely  offset  by  financial  aid,  but  students  do  not  know  their  aid  offers  with  
7:187:13409:20:21:107:506:197:144:Times:144:Times:certainty  when  they  are  applying  for  schools  (e.g. Avery  and  Turner,  2009). 
7:188:13495:21:21:107:510:176:144:Times:144:Times:Financially  constrained  students  may  also  choose  a  nearby  college  to  reduce  
7:189:13582:21:21:107:507:155:144:Times:144:Times:travel  costs  or  avoid  the  cost  of  living  away  from  home.  Again,  this  will  tend  to  
7:190:13680:21:20:107:508:134:144:Times:144:Times:increase undermatching more  than  overmatching because the  students  have  an  
7:191:13761:20:0:107:509:114:144:Times:144:Times:incentive  to  attend  a  closer  school  even  if  they  are  undermatched  for  it,  but  
8:192:13855:0:21:108:508:673:144:Times:144:Times:schools generally have  no  incentive  to  accept  weaker  students  just  because  they  
8:193:13945:21:21:108:173:652:144:Times:144:Times:live nearby.   
8:194:13959:21:20:144:509:631:144:Times:144:Times:Features  of  the  state university system  can  also generate  mismatch  in  
8:195:14037:20:21:108:508:611:144:Times:144:Times:either  direction.    Most  state  colleges offer  discounted  tuition  to  state  residents,  
8:196:14132:21:21:108:509:590:144:Times:144:Times:making  them  (often  quite  substantially)  less  expensive  than  other  options.    We  
8:197:14223:21:21:108:507:569:144:Times:144:Times:expect students to trade off lower price for match quality at the margin, increasing 
8:198:14308:21:20:108:516:548:144:Times:144:Times:the  probability  of  mismatch  for  students  who  have  no  well-  matched  college  
8:199:14395:20:21:108:507:528:144:Times:144:Times:within  their  state  university  system.  Because  some  state  colleges  are  required  to  
8:200:14489:21:21:108:508:507:144:Times:144:Times:have  different  admission  thresholds for in-state students,  students  who  constrain  
8:201:14578:21:20:108:497:486:144:Times:144:Times:themselves to the state system may end up either overmatched or undermatched. 
8:202:14656:20:21:144:508:466:144:Times:144:Times:Finally, students  may  appear mismatched  with  their  college  because  they  
8:203:14736:21:21:108:507:445:144:Times:144:Times:based their choice on other factors. Students may choose a college that is good for 
8:204:14820:21:20:108:508:424:144:Times:144:Times:their major, for example engineering or art, even if it appears to be a poor match 
8:205:14903:20:21:108:507:404:144:Times:144:Times:on overall quality.  Students may be recruited to colleges based on skills, such as 
8:206:14987:21:21:108:507:383:144:Times:144:Times:athletics or music, not included in our measure of ability. Students may choose to 
8:207:15070:21:21:108:509:362:144:Times:144:Times:go  to  the  college  that  their  friends  plan  to  attend,  or  their  parents  attended,  or  
8:208:15168:21:20:108:507:341:144:Times:144:Times:whose  football  team  they  like,  or  that provides  a  desired  religious  environment. 
8:209:15259:20:21:108:508:321:144:Times:144:Times:We  do  not  observe  these  types  of  skills  and  preferences  in  our  data,  so  we  will  
8:210:15355:21:21:108:509:300:144:Times:144:Times:code  the  student  as  mismatched,  even  though  she  may have  matched  well  in  a  
8:211:15443:21:20:108:179:279:144:Times:144:Times:broader sense.

8:213:15457:21:21:108:155:238:144:Times:144:Times:III. Data 
8:214:15466:21:20:108:507:217:144:Times:144:Times:We use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 Cohort (NLSY97) data, 
8:215:15542:20:21:108:506:197:144:Times:144:Times:which samples  the  population  of  Americans  born  between  1980  and  1984.  The 
8:216:15626:21:21:108:510:176:144:Times:144:Times:first  interview  was  in  1997  with  follow-up  interviews  each  year  since.  The  
8:217:15713:21:21:108:510:155:144:Times:144:Times:majority  of  the  sample  graduated  high  school  and  made  their  college  choice  
8:218:15800:21:20:108:508:134:144:Times:144:Times:between  1999  and  2002.  87 percent  of  the  un-weighted  sample  graduated  high  
8:219:15886:20:0:108:503:114:144:Times:144:Times:school or got a GED. Of these high school graduates, 38 percent started at a four-
9:220:15970:0:21:108:507:673:144:Times:144:Times:year college after high school. We focus on students who start at a 4-year college 
9:221:16053:21:21:108:507:652:144:Times:144:Times:but also  present  analyses  pooling  2-year  and  4-year  college  starters.  Appendix 
9:222:16141:21:20:107:506:631:144:Times:144:Times:Table  1  lists  our  sample  restrictions  and  the  associated  sample  losses.  The 
9:223:16228:20:21:107:506:611:144:Times:144:Times:NLSY97 sample includes both a representative cross-section and an over-sample 
9:224:16306:21:21:107:506:590:144:Times:144:Times:of black and Hispanic youths. We combine these samples in our analyses. We use 
9:225:16385:21:21:107:507:569:144:Times:144:Times:probability  of  inclusion  (in  the  overall  NLSY97  sample)  weights,  constructed  by  
9:226:16476:21:20:107:507:548:144:Times:144:Times:the NLSY, to combine the two samples, and also to control for differing sampling 
9:227:16556:20:21:107:503:528:144:Times:144:Times:and  response  rates  in  different  regions  of  the  U.S.  and by  age,  gender,  race-
9:228:16645:21:21:107:191:507:144:Times:144:Times:ethnicity groups. 
9:229:16663:21:20:107:509:486:144:Times:144:Times: One  of  the  main  strengths  of  the  NLSY97  data  lies  in  the  rich  set  of  
9:230:16747:20:21:107:507:466:144:Times:144:Times:individual  and  family  covariates  it  provides.  Using  the  restricted  access  geocode  
9:231:16840:21:21:107:508:445:144:Times:144:Times:data  provides  additional information  on  the  identities  of  colleges  attended  and  
9:232:16930:21:20:107:508:424:144:Times:144:Times:allows  the  use  of  contextual  information  based  on  the  respondent’s  residential  
9:233:17020:20:21:107:508:404:144:Times:144:Times:location.  Appendix  Table  2  defines  the  variables  we  use  in  our  analysis,  which  
9:234:17112:21:21:107:506:383:144:Times:144:Times:also include some variables from the double-secret high school survey data, which 
9:235:17194:21:21:107:506:362:144:Times:144:Times:can be accessed only at the Bureau of Labor Statistics offices in Washington, DC.  
9:236:17277:21:20:143:506:341:144:Times:144:Times:Many of the variables we use have modest amounts of item non-response. 
9:237:17348:20:21:107:507:321:144:Times:144:Times:Rather than do listwise  deletion of observations when an independent variable is 
9:238:17430:21:21:107:509:300:144:Times:144:Times:missing,  which  would  cumulatively result  in  massive  sample  loss,  we  recode  
9:239:17515:21:20:107:506:279:144:Times:144:Times:missing values to zero and include an indicator variable for missing values in our 
9:240:17598:20:21:107:215:259:144:Times:144:Times:multivariate analyses. 
9:241:17621:21:21:107:509:238:144:Times:144:Times: We  mostly  use  standard  variables  and  variable  definitions  that  do  not  
9:242:17702:21:20:107:507:217:144:Times:144:Times:require additional discussion here. Exceptions are the constructed ability, college 
9:243:17786:20:21:107:507:197:144:Times:144:Times:quality  and  mismatch  variables  considered  in  detail  in  the  next  section,  and  the  
9:244:17880:21:21:107:509:176:144:Times:144:Times:NLSY97  measures  of  family  income  and  wealth.  The  NLSY  measures  these  
9:245:17960:21:21:107:506:155:144:Times:144:Times:variables at a single point in time, namely the 1997 interview. As a result, they get 
9:246:18046:21:20:107:506:134:144:Times:144:Times:measured at different ages for different respondents. In addition, they include only 
9:247:18131:20:0:107:507:114:144:Times:144:Times:income and wealth for the household in which the respondent resides. Thus, they 
10:248:18213:0:21:108:509:673:144:Times:144:Times:will  miss  parental  income  and  wealth  entirely  for  older  respondents  with  their  
10:249:18304:21:21:108:508:652:144:Times:144:Times:own households as well as the income and wealth of the non-custodial spouse in 
10:250:18383:21:20:108:507:631:144:Times:144:Times:the case of parental divorce. Even without these issues, our ideal measures would 
10:251:18465:20:21:108:508:611:144:Times:144:Times:include  the  stock of  wealth  available at  the  time  of  the  college  choice  as  well  as  
10:252:18562:21:21:108:507:590:144:Times:144:Times:expected future income and wealth. The available measures fall well short of this 
10:253:18644:21:21:108:510:569:144:Times:144:Times:ideal,  which  has  implications  for  how  we  interpret  the  estimates  from  these  
10:254:18732:21:20:108:291:548:144:Times:144:Times:variables in our multivariate analysis.

10:257:18822:21:20:108:155:486:144:Times:144:Times:1. Ability 
10:258:18832:20:21:108:508:466:144:Times:144:Times:Our primary measure of student ability is the Armed Forces Vocational Aptitude 
10:259:18911:21:21:108:507:445:144:Times:144:Times:Battery  (ASVAB).  The  ASVAB  is designed  for  applicants  to  the  U.S.  military 
10:260:18995:21:20:108:507:424:144:Times:144:Times:and was taken by most of the NLSY97 respondents as part of a norming exercise. 
10:261:19074:20:21:108:508:404:144:Times:144:Times:NLSY respondents took the ASVAB during the first wave of the survey in 1997 
10:262:19150:21:21:108:507:383:144:Times:144:Times:and those who took the test were paid $75 for their time. 78% of the sample, and 
10:263:19231:21:21:108:507:362:144:Times:144:Times:84% of respondents who started at a 4-year college, completed all portions of the 
10:264:19313:21:20:108:134:341:144:Times:144:Times:test.  
10:265:19320:20:21:144:509:321:144:Times:144:Times:The  ASVAB  has  twelve  components,  covering  both  the  sorts  of  skills  
10:266:19398:21:21:108:511:300:144:Times:144:Times:measured  by  the  SAT  such  as  algebra,  geometry,  vocabulary,  and  reading  
10:267:19480:21:20:108:511:279:144:Times:144:Times:comprehension   and   other   skills   such   as   electronics   knowledge   and   spatial   
10:268:19573:20:21:108:506:259:144:Times:144:Times:reasoning. The ASVAB is a computer adaptive test, meaning that the difficulty of 
10:269:19654:21:21:108:508:238:144:Times:144:Times:the  questions  asked  in  the  latter  part  of  each  section  of  the  test  depends  on  how  
10:270:19752:21:20:108:509:217:144:Times:144:Times:well  respondents  do  on  the  initial  questions  in  the  section.  The  score  for  each  
10:271:19846:20:21:108:507:197:144:Times:144:Times:section reported by the NLSY depends on both the number of questions answered 
10:272:19924:21:21:108:507:176:144:Times:144:Times:correctly and the difficulty of those questions as estimated from an earlier sample 
10:273:20008:21:21:108:512:155:144:Times:144:Times:of  test  takers.  T he  ASVAB  offers  a  somewhat  richer  measure  of  ability  than  the  
10:274:20102:21:0:108:506:134:144:Times:144:Times:SAT  or  ACT  score,  and  should  be  less  influenced  by  variation  in  preparation 
11:275:20192:0:21:108:507:673:144:Times:144:Times:because there  was  nothing  riding  on  this  test  for  the  NLSY  participants.1  The 
11:276:20281:21:21:108:507:652:144:Times:144:Times:ASVAB score also has the useful feature that colleges do not observe it. We can 
11:277:20361:21:20:108:509:631:144:Times:144:Times:therefore  capture  some  of  the  college  mismatch  generated  by  colleges  having  
11:278:20448:20:21:108:229:611:144:Times:144:Times:incomplete information.  
11:279:20473:21:21:144:507:590:144:Times:144:Times:When survey participants took the ASVAB, they ranged in age from 12 to 
11:280:20544:21:21:108:509:569:144:Times:144:Times:18, younger  than  most  of  the  larger  population  taking  the  test.  We  adjust  the  
11:281:20635:21:20:108:509:548:144:Times:144:Times:scores  for  age  at  testing  and  then take  the  first  principal  component of the  12  
11:282:20727:20:21:108:506:528:144:Times:144:Times:section  scores  as  our  primary measure  of  ability,  which  we  call  ASVAB1.  We 
11:283:20813:21:21:108:504:507:144:Times:144:Times:calculate  each  respondent’s  percentile  within  the  sample  distribution of  college-
11:284:20902:21:20:108:509:486:144:Times:144:Times:bound  NLSY97  respondents,  weighted  by  their probability  of  inclusion  in  the  
11:285:20988:20:21:108:149:466:144:Times:144:Times:survey.  
11:286:20997:21:21:144:509:445:144:Times:144:Times:As  shown  in  Appendix  Table  3,  the  first  principal component  explains  
11:287:21076:21:20:108:511:424:144:Times:144:Times:60%  of  the  total  variance  in  test  scores  across  the  12  sections.  The  first  
11:288:21165:20:21:108:507:404:144:Times:144:Times:component places the highest weight on subjects like those on the SAT (or ACT): 
11:289:21245:21:21:108:510:383:144:Times:144:Times:arithmetic,  word  knowledge,  and  paragraph  comprehension. Not  surprisingly  
11:290:21326:21:21:108:507:362:144:Times:144:Times:giving the loadings, the correlation between ASVAB1 and the respondent’s SAT 
11:291:21403:21:20:108:237:341:144:Times:144:Times:or ACT score equals 0.81. 
11:292:21429:20:21:144:507:321:144:Times:144:Times:The  second  component,  which  we  call ASVAB2,  explains  a  further  11%  
11:293:21506:21:21:107:508:300:144:Times:144:Times:of  the  variance.  It  places  the  most weight  on  the  two  timed  sections  of  the  test:  
11:294:21603:21:20:108:509:279:144:Times:144:Times:numerical  operations  and  coding  speed.  Cawley,  Heckman,  and  Vytacil  (2001)  
11:295:21688:20:21:108:506:259:144:Times:144:Times:find that the first two principal components of the ASVAB score both predict later 
11:296:21771:21:21:108:507:238:144:Times:144:Times:earnings  in  the  NLSY  1979  sample.  To  construct  our  measure  of  mismatch,  for  
11:297:21860:21:20:108:508:217:144:Times:144:Times:which we need a single measure of ability, we use only ASVAB1. However, we 
11:298:21935:20:25:108:454:197:144:Times:144:Times:include ASVAB2 as an additional variable in our multivariate analyses. 
11:299:22006:25:16:108:483:172:42:Times:99:Times:1 The ASVAB test is not a straightforward measure of “innate” ability because it includes the 
11:300:22100:16:12:108:489:156:99:Times:99:Times:influences and training that the student has had up to the point she takes the test.  See Neal and 
11:301:22199:12:11:108:502:144:99:Times:99:Times:Johnson (1996) for a more thorough discussion of what the ASVAB test is measuring.  We do not 
11:302:22293:11:11:108:502:133:99:Times:99:Times:mind if the ASVAB also measures intrinsic motivation, as argued by Segal (2012). More broadly, 
11:303:22388:11:12:108:483:122:99:Times:99:Times:we use the term “ability” quite agnostically to mean the set of skills, innate or otherwise, that 
11:304:22486:12:0:108:328:110:99:Times:99:Times:students possess around the time of the college choice. 
11:305:22544:0:0:108:255:180:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
12:306:22593:0:21:144:508:673:144:Times:144:Times:While  we  prefer  our  ASVAB-based  ability  measure  to  the SAT  or  ACT  
12:307:22670:21:21:107:507:652:144:Times:144:Times:scores  commonly  relied  on  in  the  literature,  it  remains  an  imperfect  measure  of  
12:308:22763:21:20:107:512:631:144:Times:144:Times:ability. Although   the   ASVAB tests a   richer   variety   of   skills   than   most   
12:309:22852:20:21:107:507:611:144:Times:144:Times:standardized  tests  it  still  does  not  capture  all  the  abilities  that  make  for  a  strong  
12:310:22953:21:21:107:507:590:144:Times:144:Times:college  student.  Even  if  it  did  attempt  to  measure  all  relevant  abilities,  the  score  
12:311:23052:21:21:107:508:569:144:Times:144:Times:from  a  single  ASVAB  test  would  be  an  imperfect  measure  of  ability  because  
12:312:23139:21:20:107:486:548:144:Times:144:Times:some students will perform above or below their usual level on any given day. 
12:313:23217:20:21:107:196:528:144:Times:144:Times:2. College quality 
12:314:23236:21:21:107:509:507:144:Times:144:Times:We  construct  a  multifaceted  index  of  college  quality  by  combining  measures  
12:315:23322:21:20:107:508:486:144:Times:144:Times:related  to  selectivity  and  college  resources.  In  particular,  we combine data  from  
12:316:23414:20:21:107:507:466:144:Times:144:Times:the  U.S.  Department  of  Education’s  Integrated  Post-Secondary Education Data 
12:317:23496:21:21:107:506:445:144:Times:144:Times:System  (IPEDS)  and  U.S.  News  and  World  Report,  both  from  2008.2  The 
12:318:23575:21:20:108:507:424:144:Times:144:Times:components of our college quality index are mean SAT score (or mean ACT score 
12:319:23653:20:21:108:508:404:144:Times:144:Times:converted  to  the  SAT  scale)  of  entering  students,  percent  of  applicants  rejected,  
12:320:23747:21:21:107:507:383:144:Times:144:Times:the  average  salary  of  all  faculty  engaged  in  instruction,  and  the faculty-student 
12:321:23839:21:21:107:508:362:144:Times:144:Times:ratio.  Our  faculty-student  ratio  includes  only  undergraduate  students  and  faculty  
12:322:23931:21:20:107:511:341:144:Times:144:Times:who   do   not   teach   exclusively   in   graduate   or   professional   schools   within   
12:323:24025:20:21:107:508:321:144:Times:144:Times:universities.  Most  of  the  NLSY97  respondents  started  college  between  1999  and  
12:324:24114:21:21:107:507:300:144:Times:144:Times:2002,  somewhat  earlier  than  our  college  quality  measures.  2008  is  the  earliest 
12:325:24203:21:20:108:507:279:144:Times:144:Times:year  for  which  we  could  obtain  US  News  data  and  the  first  year  that  IPEDS 
12:326:24290:20:21:108:512:259:144:Times:144:Times:reported   faculty-student   ratios   focused   only   on   undergraduates.   The   other   
12:327:24382:21:53:108:509:238:144:Times:144:Times:components  of  our  college  quality  measure  are  quite  stable  between  2000  and  
12:328:24470:53:18:108:506:185:65:Times:99:Times:2 US  News  and  IPEDS  collect  many  of  the  same  statistics  and  for  the  same  college  in  the  same  
12:329:24580:18:11:108:506:167:99:Times:99:Times:year the numbers are often identical.  US News has average SAT or ACT scores for the students at 
12:330:24677:11:12:108:508:156:99:Times:99:Times:a  number  of  schools  that  do  not  report  test  scores  to  IPEDS.    However,  US  News  focuses  on  
12:331:24785:12:11:108:507:144:99:Times:99:Times:selective schools and excludes 2-year colleges altogether.  Combining data from the two sources 
12:332:24881:11:11:107:507:133:99:Times:99:Times:gives us the most complete sample of colleges.  We use US News data to fill in average SAT and 
12:333:24976:11:12:107:507:122:99:Times:99:Times:ACT  scores  and  faculty/student  ratios  when  these  statistics  are  missing  from  IPEDS.    Rejection  
12:334:25085:12:0:107:308:110:99:Times:144:Times:rates and faculty salaries come only from IPEDS. 
12:335:25136:0:0:108:255:193:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
13:336:25185:0:21:108:507:673:144:Times:144:Times:2008, so we feel the improved data available in 2008 outweigh the measurement 
13:337:25263:21:21:108:362:652:144:Times:144:Times:error from observing college quality in a later year.   
13:338:25319:21:20:143:507:631:144:Times:144:Times:Following  Black  and  Smith  (2004),  we  use  the  first  principal  component  
13:339:25401:20:21:107:508:611:144:Times:144:Times:across these four measures of quality as our quality index. Like Black and Smith 
13:340:25482:21:21:107:507:590:144:Times:144:Times:(2006),  we  view  our  index  as  providing  an  estimate  of  latent  college  quality, 
13:341:25572:21:21:107:511:569:144:Times:144:Times:which  we  view  as  continuous  and  one-dimensional.  Within  this  framework,  
13:342:25654:21:20:107:506:548:144:Times:144:Times:combining multiple proxies for college quality into a single index measures latent 
13:343:25737:20:21:107:506:528:144:Times:144:Times:quality with less error than using a single proxy (such as the average SAT score of 
13:344:25821:21:21:107:507:507:144:Times:144:Times:the  entering  class)  or  the  categorical  quality  ratings  (e.g.  from  Barron’s)  used  in  
13:345:25918:21:20:107:508:486:144:Times:144:Times:much  of  the  literature.  Our  index  corresponds  well  to  a  priori  notions  of  relative  
13:346:26015:20:21:107:507:466:144:Times:144:Times:quality. For example, taking one state at random, the University of Michigan lies 
13:347:26097:21:21:107:508:445:144:Times:144:Times:at  the  93rd  percentile,  Michigan  State  at  the  74th,    Wayne  State  at  the  36th,  and  
13:348:26195:21:20:107:507:424:144:Times:144:Times:Eastern Michigan at the 28th.  Appendix Table 4 presents the loadings. At the same 
13:349:26278:20:21:108:511:404:144:Times:144:Times:time,  our  measure  does  not  capture  differences  in  the  quality  that  different  
13:350:26367:21:21:108:510:383:144:Times:144:Times:students  experience  within  the  same  university  due  to,  for  example,  quality  
13:351:26454:21:21:108:440:362:144:Times:144:Times:difference across fields of study or participation in honors programs. 
13:352:26525:21:20:144:509:341:144:Times:144:Times:This  4-factor  quality  index  is  a  good  measure  of  the  quality  of  at  least  
13:353:26612:20:21:108:503:321:144:Times:144:Times:somewhat selective 4-year colleges. However, some 4-year colleges and many 2-
13:354:26689:21:21:108:509:300:144:Times:144:Times:year  colleges  do  not  report  the  average  SAT  or  ACT  scores  for  their  entering  
13:355:26780:21:20:108:507:279:144:Times:144:Times:classes, often because they do not require these tests as part of their applications. 
13:356:26866:20:21:108:509:259:144:Times:144:Times:Our  baseline  measure  of  college  quality,  which  we  only  construct  for  colleges  
13:357:26956:21:21:108:507:238:144:Times:144:Times:with all four quality measures, disproportionally misses less selective schools. To 
13:358:27040:21:20:108:507:217:144:Times:144:Times:address this problem, we also construct an alternative 6-factor measure of college 
13:359:27123:20:21:108:509:197:144:Times:144:Times:quality  that  includes  an  indicator  for  colleges  that  do  not  report  SAT  or  ACT  
13:360:27215:21:21:108:507:176:144:Times:144:Times:scores (setting the average SAT scores to zero for those schools). This alternative 
13:361:27299:21:21:108:508:155:144:Times:144:Times:index  also  includes  an  indicator  for  admitting  all  applicants;  that  is,  for  having  a  
13:362:27398:21:20:108:507:134:144:Times:144:Times:rejection rate equal to zero.  This 6-factor college quality measure is our baseline 
13:363:27483:20:0:108:507:114:144:Times:144:Times:measure  for  our  analysis  combining  2-year  and  4-year  college  starters.  We 
14:364:27570:0:21:108:504:673:144:Times:144:Times:designed  this  measure  to  better  capture college  quality  across  both  2-year  and  4-
14:365:27662:21:21:107:508:652:144:Times:144:Times:year  colleges,  but  it  also  allows  us  to  include  students  starting  at  4-year  schools  
14:366:27760:21:20:107:507:631:144:Times:144:Times:that  do  not  report  SAT  scores. Failure  to  report  SAT  scores  and  open  admission  
14:367:27852:20:21:107:506:611:144:Times:144:Times:policies both have negative weights in our college quality factor analysis, so these 
14:368:27937:21:21:107:433:590:144:Times:144:Times:new schools are mostly in the lower part of the quality distribution. 
14:369:28007:21:21:107:224:569:144:Times:144:Times:3. Measuring mismatch 
14:370:28028:21:20:107:510:548:144:Times:144:Times:We  employ  three  alternative  measures  of  mismatch.  Our primary measure  of  
14:371:28110:20:21:107:511:528:144:Times:144:Times:mismatch   combines   the   student   ability   and   college   quality   measures   just   
14:372:28202:21:21:107:507:507:144:Times:144:Times:described.  We calculate  the  college’s  quality  percentile  across  all  four-year 
14:373:28288:21:20:107:506:486:144:Times:144:Times:institutions in the United States included in the IPEDS, weighted by student body 
14:374:28370:20:21:107:507:466:144:Times:144:Times:size.3 Because we weight the quality percentile by student body size, a college in 
14:375:28453:21:21:108:508:445:144:Times:144:Times:the  nth  percentile  is  the  college that  a  student  in  the  nth  percentile of  the  ability  
14:376:28553:21:20:107:508:424:144:Times:144:Times:distribution would  attend  if  there  were  perfect  assortative matching  of  students  
14:377:28643:20:21:107:507:404:144:Times:144:Times:and  colleges.  We  consider  students  mismatched  when  they  deviate  substantially  
14:378:28731:21:21:107:508:383:144:Times:144:Times:from  this  type  of  matching.    When  considering  both  2-year  and  4-year  college  
14:379:28821:21:21:107:507:362:144:Times:144:Times:starters we calculate student ability percentiles across all 2-   and 4-year starters in 
14:380:28910:21:20:108:508:341:144:Times:144:Times:the  NLSY97  sample  and  calculate  weighted  college  quality  percentiles  using  all  
14:381:29000:20:21:108:485:321:144:Times:144:Times:2-year and 4-year colleges in IPEDS and the 6-factor college quality measure. 
14:382:29077:21:21:144:507:300:144:Times:144:Times:In practice, substantial gaps between a student’s ability percentile and her 
14:383:29154:21:20:107:512:279:144:Times:144:Times:college’s   quality   percentile   are   quite   common. Table   1A gives   the   joint   
14:384:29244:20:21:107:508:259:144:Times:144:Times:distribution  of  student  ability  and  college  quality,  including  only  4-year  college  
14:385:29338:21:21:107:508:238:144:Times:144:Times:starters.  Students  concentrate  along  the  diagonal,  which  indicates  a  good  match,  
14:386:29430:21:20:107:510:217:144:Times:144:Times:but  there  are  also  many  mismatched  students. The  three  upper  right  cells,  
14:387:29515:20:21:107:507:197:144:Times:144:Times:corresponding to high ability students at low quality colleges, account for 12.5% 
14:388:29597:21:21:107:509:176:144:Times:144:Times:of  the  sample,  while  the  three  lower  left  cells,  corresponding  to  low  ability  
14:389:29688:21:40:107:507:155:144:Times:144:Times:students at high quality colleges, account for 12.9%.  A comparison of Table 1A 
14:390:29768:40:0:108:406:115:42:Times:99:Times:3 Our measure of student body size is full-time equivalent undergraduates. 
14:391:29845:0:0:108:255:122:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
15:392:29894:0:21:108:509:673:144:Times:144:Times:to  Table  4  of  Black  and  Smith  (2004)  reveals  (perhaps  surprisingly  given  the  
15:393:29984:21:21:108:509:652:144:Times:144:Times:recent  policy  focus  on  mismatch)  no  dramatic  changes  in  the  joint  distribution  
15:394:30075:21:20:108:323:631:144:Times:144:Times:between the NLSY79 and NLSY97 cohorts. 
15:395:30114:20:21:144:507:611:144:Times:144:Times:In much of the following analysis we categorize students as overmatched, 
15:396:30187:21:21:108:507:590:144:Times:144:Times:well-matched, or undermatched for their college based on the difference between 
15:397:30267:21:21:107:508:569:144:Times:144:Times:their  ability  percentile  and  their  college  quality  percentile.  Figure  1  reveals  an  
15:398:30362:21:20:108:507:548:144:Times:144:Times:approximately normal distribution for this difference. We consider students to be 
15:399:30444:20:21:108:511:528:144:Times:144:Times:undermatched   or   overmatched,   as   appropriate, if   their   percentile   difference   
15:400:30536:21:21:108:508:507:144:Times:144:Times:exceeds 20. These cutoffs assign about a quarter of the sample to each mismatch 
15:401:30616:21:20:108:507:486:144:Times:144:Times:category.    Using  binary  indicators  for  mismatch  simplifies  the  analysis  and 
15:402:30701:20:21:108:512:466:144:Times:144:Times:presentation,   but   loses   some   information   relative   to   directly   studying   the   
15:403:30796:21:21:108:508:445:144:Times:144:Times:differences in the ability and college quality measures. Later on, we examine the 
15:404:30878:21:20:108:510:424:144:Times:144:Times:sensitivity  of  our  results  to  changes  in  the  cutoff  used  to  define  the  binary  
15:405:30970:20:21:108:213:404:144:Times:144:Times:mismatch indicators.  
15:406:30992:21:21:144:508:383:144:Times:144:Times:We  construct  our  second  mismatch  measure  in  the  same  way  as  the  first,  
15:407:31076:21:21:108:507:362:144:Times:144:Times:but using student SAT score as the measure of ability and the average SAT score 
15:408:31156:21:20:108:509:341:144:Times:144:Times:of  the  entering  class  as  the  measure  of  college  quality.  This  measure  links  us  
15:409:31249:20:21:108:507:321:144:Times:144:Times:somewhat to the wider literature, which tends to focus on these specific variables 
15:410:31332:21:21:108:511:300:144:Times:144:Times:(or on discretized versions of them). Table 1B presents   the joint distribution using 
15:411:31419:21:20:108:507:279:144:Times:144:Times:the SAT-based variables. This table reveals less extensive mismatch, as measured 
15:412:31500:20:21:108:508:259:144:Times:144:Times:by  the  fraction  in  the  six  corner  cells,  presumably  because  colleges  observe  the  
15:413:31594:21:21:108:442:238:144:Times:144:Times:student’s SAT score directly but only observe proxies for ASVAB1.  
15:414:31661:21:20:144:510:217:144:Times:144:Times:Our  third  mismatch  measure  compares  the  student’s  SAT  score  to  the  
15:415:31739:20:21:108:507:197:144:Times:144:Times:inter-quartile range of SAT scores at the student’s college. This measure captures, 
15:416:31823:21:21:108:507:176:144:Times:144:Times:in a crude but important way, the notion that being a bit different from the average 
15:417:31908:21:21:108:509:155:144:Times:144:Times:means  something  different  at  a  college  with  a  very  heterogenous  (in  terms  of  
15:418:31998:21:0:108:508:134:144:Times:144:Times:ability)  student  body  than  it  means  at  a  college  with  a  very  homogenous  student  
16:419:32095:0:21:108:508:673:144:Times:144:Times:body. To our knowledge, we are the first in this literature to consider variance in 
16:420:32179:21:21:108:287:652:144:Times:144:Times:student ability in defining mismatch. 
16:421:32216:21:20:143:508:631:144:Times:144:Times:Other important studies  in  the  literature,  such  as  Roderick  et  al.  (2008),  
16:422:32301:20:21:107:507:611:144:Times:144:Times:Bowen et al. (2009), and Smith et al. (2012) create their measures of mismatch by 
16:423:32383:21:21:107:506:590:144:Times:144:Times:making tables with student test score bins on one axis and college quality bins on 
16:424:32466:21:21:107:507:569:144:Times:144:Times:the other. For each student test score bin, they then determine the highest quality 
16:425:32550:21:20:107:507:548:144:Times:144:Times:bin  with  a  high  probability  of  admission.  Students  in  the  highest  bin  get  labeled  
16:426:32646:20:21:107:508:528:144:Times:144:Times:well-matched,  with  undermatch  then  defined  by  the  distance  (measured  in  bins)  
16:427:32735:21:21:108:504:507:144:Times:144:Times:between  the  bin  of  the  college  the  student  actually  enrolled  in  and  the  well-
16:428:32825:21:20:108:508:486:144:Times:144:Times:matched bin. Relative to these measures, our primary measure employs better (in 
16:429:32905:20:21:108:507:466:144:Times:144:Times:the sense of less measurement error) measures of both college quality and ability. 
16:430:32988:21:21:108:508:445:144:Times:144:Times:Our first two measures also have the feature that it is possible for everyone to be 
16:431:33072:21:20:108:506:424:144:Times:144:Times:well-matched without violating institutional enrollment constraints. This is not the 
16:432:33157:20:21:108:504:404:144:Times:144:Times:case  with  the  other  measures  in  the  literature;  for  every  student  to  be  well-
16:433:33247:21:21:108:510:383:144:Times:144:Times:matched  by  those  measures  would  require  a  vast  expansion  in  the  enrollment  
16:434:33334:21:21:108:507:362:144:Times:144:Times:capacity of more selective schools. We think this is an unattractive feature. House 
16:435:33418:21:20:107:507:341:144:Times:144:Times:(2013) surveys the literature on mismatch measures in (much) greater detail, and 
16:436:33499:20:21:107:506:321:144:Times:144:Times:demonstrates  by  applying  multiple  measures  to  a  common  data  set  that  the 
16:437:33583:21:21:107:501:300:144:Times:144:Times:amount of mismatch varies widely depending on the particular measure adopted.

16:439:33662:21:20:107:293:258:144:Times:144:Times:V. Understanding the college choice 
16:440:33697:20:21:107:251:238:144:Times:144:Times:1. Application and admission 
16:441:33726:21:20:107:506:217:144:Times:144:Times:The youngest members of the NLSY97 cohort, those born in 1983 and 1984, were 
16:442:33803:20:21:107:506:197:144:Times:144:Times:asked an additional battery of questions around the time they finished high school 
16:443:33886:21:21:107:507:176:144:Times:144:Times:about  the  set  of  colleges  to  which  they  applied  and the admission  decision  from  
16:444:33978:21:21:108:421:155:144:Times:144:Times:each school. Table 2 presents statistics based on these questions. 
16:445:34045:21:20:144:507:134:144:Times:144:Times:The top panel of Table 2 shows that just over 30% of students who ended 
16:446:34117:20:0:108:508:114:144:Times:144:Times:up  mismatched  with  their  college  had  applied  to  at  least  one  college  with  which  
17:447:34214:0:21:108:507:673:144:Times:144:Times:they would have been well-matched by our definition. Most of those students who 
17:448:34294:21:21:108:509:652:144:Times:144:Times:applied  were  also  accepted  to  one  of  those  well-matched  schools. The  bottom  
17:449:34381:21:20:108:509:631:144:Times:144:Times:panel  reveals  that,  among  s  tudents  who  ended  up  undermatched,  69%  did  not  
17:450:34469:20:21:108:507:611:144:Times:144:Times:apply to any colleges with which they were well-matched. Only 8% applied to at 
17:451:34548:21:21:108:512:590:144:Times:144:Times:least   one   well-matched   school   and   were   rejected.   The   remaining   23%   of   
17:452:34640:21:21:108:507:569:144:Times:144:Times:undermatched students were accepted to at least one school with which they were 
17:453:34720:21:20:108:507:548:144:Times:144:Times:well-matched  but  chose  to  attend  a  college  for  which  they were  undermatched. 
17:454:34807:20:21:108:507:528:144:Times:144:Times:Note that 8% represents an upper bound on the percentage of all students who end 
17:455:34888:21:21:108:507:507:144:Times:144:Times:up undermatched  due  to  college  admissions  decisions  because  even  if these 
17:456:34970:21:20:108:509:486:144:Times:144:Times:students  had  been  admitted  to  a  well-matched  college  some  would  still  have  
17:457:35057:20:21:108:507:466:144:Times:144:Times:chosen to go elsewhere. More broadly, these students could have applied to more 
17:458:35137:21:21:108:508:445:144:Times:144:Times:colleges; the  average  undermatched  student  sends  only  two  applications,  slightly  
17:459:35227:21:20:108:508:424:144:Times:144:Times:below the overall average in our sample. Overmatching is equally a consequence 
17:460:35306:20:21:108:506:404:144:Times:144:Times:of  student  choices  rather  than  college  choices;  only  4%  of  overmatched  students 
17:461:35397:21:21:108:363:383:144:Times:144:Times:applied to a well-matched school and were rejected.  
17:462:35450:21:21:144:508:362:144:Times:144:Times:In sum, mismatch overwhelmingly results from choices made by students 
17:463:35520:21:20:108:511:341:144:Times:144:Times:and   their   families,   not   choices   made   by   college   admissions   offices.   This   
17:464:35615:20:21:108:512:321:144:Times:144:Times:conclusion,   though   perhaps   surprising,   represents   the   standard   view   in   the   
17:465:35710:21:21:108:509:300:144:Times:144:Times:academic  literature;  see,  e.g.  Hoxby  and  Avery  (2012),  Griffith  and  Rothstein  
17:466:35799:21:20:108:508:279:144:Times:144:Times:(2010), Avery and Turner (2009), and Roderick et al. (2008). It also justifies our 
17:467:35882:20:21:108:507:259:144:Times:144:Times:framing of the choice as primarily one made by students in the informal model in 
17:468:35963:21:21:108:161:238:144:Times:144:Times:Section II. 
17:469:35974:21:20:108:217:217:144:Times:144:Times:2. Univariate patterns 
17:470:35997:20:21:108:508:197:144:Times:144:Times:Tables  3  and  4  describe  the  characteristics  of  students  and  their  families  by  the  
17:471:36093:21:21:108:507:176:144:Times:144:Times:quality  of  college  they  attend  and  by  their  match  category,  respectively.  We 
17:472:36181:21:21:108:507:155:144:Times:144:Times:highlight only a few of the most important univariate patterns, saving most of our 
17:473:36264:21:0:108:335:134:144:Times:144:Times:attention for the multivariate results to follow.  
18:474:36318:0:21:144:507:673:144:Times:144:Times:If unconstrained students (and college admissions officers) prefer to avoid 
18:475:36394:21:21:108:509:652:144:Times:144:Times:either  undermatch  or  overmatch,  then  we  would  expect  Table  3  to  reveal  that  
18:476:36483:21:20:108:508:631:144:Times:144:Times:variables  correlated  with  student  ability  correlate  positively  with  college  quality.  
18:477:36578:20:21:108:508:611:144:Times:144:Times:In the imperfect information version of that same world, we would expect to see 
18:478:36658:21:21:108:509:590:144:Times:144:Times:that  variables  positively  correlated  with  information  quality  have  higher  levels  
18:479:36749:21:21:108:506:569:144:Times:144:Times:among well-matched students than among mismatched students (i.e. a hill-shaped 
18:480:36828:21:20:108:203:548:144:Times:144:Times:pattern) in Table 4. 
18:481:36849:20:21:144:509:528:144:Times:144:Times:In  fact,  we  find  common  patterns  in  the  two  tables  for  nearly  every  
18:482:36930:21:21:108:507:507:144:Times:144:Times:variable. Variables that positively correlate with college quality in Table 3 predict 
18:483:37016:21:20:108:510:486:144:Times:144:Times:more  overmatch  and  less  undermatch  in  Table  4.  For  example,  in  Table  3,  
18:484:37101:20:21:108:507:466:144:Times:144:Times:students attending the highest college quality quartile have more educated parents 
18:485:37183:21:21:108:508:445:144:Times:144:Times:on average than those attending lower quality colleges. In Table 4, students who 
18:486:37264:21:20:108:509:424:144:Times:144:Times:are  overmatched  for  their  college  have  more  educated  parents on  average  than  
18:487:37352:20:21:108:508:404:144:Times:144:Times:students  who  are  well-matched  to  their  college,  who  in  turn  have  more  educated  
18:488:37444:21:21:108:508:383:144:Times:144:Times:parents  than  students  who  end  up  undermatched for  their  college.  Family  wealth  
18:489:37534:21:21:108:507:362:144:Times:144:Times:has  a  similarly  monotone  effect.  Monotone patterns in  Table  4  such  as  these 
18:490:37619:21:20:108:506:341:144:Times:144:Times:indicate that these characteristics influence college quality rather than mismatch, a 
18:491:37705:20:21:108:437:321:144:Times:144:Times:theme that will recur in the multivariate analysis in the next section. 
18:492:37777:21:21:144:508:300:144:Times:144:Times:We draw  additional  measures  related  to  information  and  guidance  from  
18:493:37855:21:20:108:506:279:144:Times:144:Times:surveys of the high schools attended by the NLSY97 respondents. These measures 
18:494:37934:20:21:108:507:259:144:Times:144:Times:have  the  advantage  (when  viewed  as  proxies  for  the  quality  of  the  student’s 
18:495:38022:21:21:108:507:238:144:Times:144:Times:information set) of a weaker (but not zero) correlation with family resources than 
18:496:38105:21:20:108:507:217:144:Times:144:Times:parental education. We consider the share of teachers at the student’s high school 
18:497:38188:20:21:108:511:197:144:Times:144:Times:with advanced degrees and the shares   of graduates from their high school (in the 
18:498:38271:21:0:108:507:176:144:Times:144:Times:class of 1999) who went on to attend a 2-year college and who went on to attend a 
19:499:38355:0:21:108:506:673:144:Times:144:Times:4-year college.4 All three variables have weak positive relationships with college 
19:500:38438:21:21:108:150:652:144:Times:144:Times:quality.  
19:501:38448:21:21:144:147:631:144:Times:144:Times: 
19:502:38448:21:20:108:238:610:144:Times:144:Times:VI. Multivariate analysis 
19:503:38473:20:21:108:507:590:144:Times:144:Times:We   estimate   separate probit   models   of   undermatching   and overmatching 
19:504:38553:21:21:108:509:569:144:Times:144:Times:conditioning  on  demographics,  multiple  measures  of  ability,  family  background  
19:505:38640:21:20:108:510:548:144:Times:144:Times:variables  including  parental  education  and  family  wealth,  contextual  variables  
19:506:38728:20:21:108:508:528:144:Times:144:Times:related  to  the  census  region  or  tract  in  which  the  student  finished  high  school,  
19:507:38823:21:21:108:511:507:144:Times:144:Times:variables  related  to  the  state  university  system  and  variables  related  to  the  
19:508:38913:21:20:108:507:486:144:Times:144:Times:student’s high school. Although we estimate reduced form specifications, we use 
19:509:38993:20:21:108:511:466:144:Times:144:Times:the  informal  theory  presented  above  to  interpret  our  findings. For  ease  of  
19:510:39079:21:21:108:507:445:144:Times:144:Times:interpretation, we present mean marginal effects (a.k.a. average derivatives of the 
19:511:39163:21:20:108:436:424:144:Times:144:Times:conditional probability of mismatch) rather than probit coefficients. 
19:512:39233:20:21:108:228:404:144:Times:144:Times:1. Baseline specification 
19:513:39258:21:21:108:515:383:144:Times:144:Times:Table  5A  presents    estimates  from  our  baseline  specification,  which  defines  
19:514:39345:21:21:108:508:362:144:Times:144:Times:mismatch as a difference of more than 20 between the student’s percentile in the 
19:515:39426:21:20:108:510:341:144:Times:144:Times:distribution  of  ASVAB  first  principal  components  and  the  percentile  of  their  
19:516:39514:20:21:108:510:321:144:Times:144:Times:college  obtained  using  the  four-factor  college  quality  index.  We  estimate  the  
19:517:39603:21:21:108:507:300:144:Times:144:Times:baseline  specification  using  the  sample  of  students  who  start  at  a  four-year 
19:518:39691:21:20:108:151:279:144:Times:144:Times:college.  
19:519:39701:20:21:144:513:259:144:Times:144:Times:In   general,   the   results   from   our   multivariate   analysis   parallel   the   
19:520:39789:21:30:108:508:238:144:Times:144:Times:unconditional  differences  presented  in  Table  4. Consider  first  the  demographic  
19:521:39877:30:17:108:472:208:65:Times:99:Times:4 Inspired by Avery (2010) we looked at whether the student’s high school offered college 
19:522:39966:17:12:108:493:191:99:Times:99:Times:counseling as well. Virtually every high school answered “yes” to this question. The survey did 
19:523:40062:12:12:108:481:179:99:Times:99:Times:not ask further questions about guidance quantity or quality. We also considered high school 
19:524:40155:12:11:108:504:167:99:Times:99:Times:teacher experience and salaries, high school graduation rates, the share of the graduating class that 
19:525:40257:11:12:108:473:156:99:Times:99:Times:took the SAT or ACT, and the availability of Advanced Placement (AP) classes. The three 
19:526:40345:12:11:108:502:144:99:Times:99:Times:variables included in the tables were selected because of their clear conceptual link to information 
19:527:40446:11:11:108:490:133:99:Times:99:Times:about college and relatively strong relationship to observed college choices. Frequent item non-
19:528:40542:11:12:108:485:122:99:Times:99:Times:response thwarted our attempts to create an index combining multiple variables from the high 
19:529:40635:12:0:108:171:110:99:Times:144:Times:school survey.  
19:530:40653:0:0:108:255:216:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
20:531:40702:0:21:108:506:673:144:Times:144:Times:variables at the top of the table. We find a lower probability of undermatching for 
20:532:40786:21:21:108:507:652:144:Times:144:Times:male students, but little difference in overmatching. Race-based affirmative action 
20:533:40870:21:20:108:506:631:144:Times:144:Times:programs  should  increase  the  probability  of  overmatch  for  minority  students, 
20:534:40956:20:21:108:506:611:144:Times:144:Times:conditional  on  their  measured  ability.  We  do  not  find  evidence  of  this  effect  for 
20:535:41051:21:21:108:509:590:144:Times:144:Times:either  blacks  or  Hispanics.  In  contrast,  students  in  the  “other”  category,  mostly  
20:536:41145:21:21:108:510:569:144:Times:144:Times:Asians,  have  a  substantially  higher  probability  (0.08)  of  overmatching  and  a  
20:537:41233:21:20:107:511:548:144:Times:144:Times:correspondingly   lower   probability   (-0.11)   of   undermatching. We   also   went   
20:538:41322:20:21:107:506:528:144:Times:144:Times:looking  for  “quality-quantity”  tradeoffs  as  in  Becker  and  Lewis  (1973)  by 
20:539:41406:21:21:107:506:507:144:Times:144:Times:including the number of household members 18 years old or younger, but the data 
20:540:41486:21:20:107:343:486:144:Times:144:Times:indicate they do not matter much in this context. 
20:541:41535:20:21:143:506:466:144:Times:144:Times:Ability has a mechanical effect on the probability of mismatch. Very able 
20:542:41609:21:21:107:506:445:144:Times:144:Times:students will have few schools for which they are overmatched and many schools 
20:543:41688:21:20:108:507:424:144:Times:144:Times:for  which  they  are  undermatched. The  first  principal  component  of  the ASVAB 
20:544:41773:20:21:108:507:404:144:Times:144:Times:scores,  the  measure  of  ability  we  use  to  define  mismatch,  demonstrates  this 
20:545:41860:21:21:108:511:383:144:Times:144:Times:mechanical  effect.  Increasing  a  student’s  ASVAB1 percentile  by  10  points  
20:546:41942:21:21:108:507:362:144:Times:144:Times:decreases her probability of overmatch by about 9 percentage points and increases 
20:547:42024:21:20:108:398:341:144:Times:144:Times:her probability of undermatch by about 7 percentage points. 
20:548:42084:20:21:144:508:321:144:Times:144:Times:Once  we  control  for  this  first  ability  measure,  however,  the  other  ability  
20:549:42171:21:21:108:508:300:144:Times:144:Times:measures have the opposite effect: higher high school grades, a higher percentile 
20:550:42253:21:20:108:507:279:144:Times:144:Times:on  the  second  principal  component  of  the  ASVAB  scores  and  a  higher  SAT 
20:551:42336:20:21:108:508:259:144:Times:144:Times:percentile all raise  a  student’s  probability  of  ending  up  overmatched,  as  defined  
20:552:42428:21:21:108:506:238:144:Times:144:Times:by  her  ASVAB1 score,  and  lower  her  probability  of  being  undermatched. 
20:553:42507:21:20:108:511:217:144:Times:144:Times:Thinking  about  the  ASVAB1  variable  as  an  error-ridden  measure  of  each  
20:554:42588:20:21:108:507:197:144:Times:144:Times:student’s  latent  ability  provides  one  way  to  think  about  these  results. Under  that  
20:555:42683:21:21:108:507:176:144:Times:144:Times:interpretation,  the  other  ability  variables  represent  three  additional  error-ridden 
20:556:42775:21:21:108:507:155:144:Times:144:Times:measures. Conditional on one, a higher value of each of the others suggests higher 
20:557:42858:21:20:108:507:134:144:Times:144:Times:latent ability. Students and colleges observe two of these other measures, namely 
20:558:42940:20:0:108:508:114:144:Times:144:Times:SAT  scores  and  grades  (and  perhaps  things  that  proxy  for  the  third,  ASVAB2),  
21:559:43033:0:21:108:507:673:144:Times:144:Times:which suggests that they should also affect application and acceptance decisions, 
21:560:43115:21:21:108:508:652:144:Times:144:Times:just  as  we  find  here.  Put  differently,  a  student  with  good  grades  and  SAT  scores  
21:561:43211:21:20:108:508:631:144:Times:144:Times:may  truly  be  a  good  match  for  a  high-quality  school,  but  we  will  consider  her  
21:562:43304:20:21:108:349:611:144:Times:144:Times:overmatched if she scored poorly on the ASVAB. 
21:563:43351:21:21:144:507:590:144:Times:144:Times:Now consider our family background variables: household wealth in 1997, 
21:564:43423:21:21:108:509:569:144:Times:144:Times:starting  college  late,  parental  education,  classes  outside  of  regular  school,  and  
21:565:43516:21:20:108:509:548:144:Times:144:Times:having  a  computer  at  home.  We  include  wealth  in  the  form  of  indicators  for  
21:566:43605:20:21:108:509:528:144:Times:144:Times:quartiles,  with  the  lowest  quartile  as  the  reference  group.  To  our  surprise,  the  
21:567:43699:21:21:108:509:507:144:Times:144:Times:wealth  variables  do  not  generate  much  explanatory  action.  Students  from  the  
21:568:43786:21:20:108:512:486:144:Times:144:Times:wealthiest   households   have   a   statistically   significantly   lower   probability   of   
21:569:43882:20:21:108:509:466:144:Times:144:Times:undermatching of  about  0.03,  presumably  reflecting  their  parents’  ability  and  
21:570:43969:21:21:107:507:445:144:Times:144:Times:interest in buying their way into a higher quality college. We find some evidence, 
21:571:44052:21:20:108:506:424:144:Times:144:Times:significant  at  the  ten  percent  level,  of  a  lower  probability  of  overmatching  at  the 
21:572:44149:20:21:107:507:404:144:Times:144:Times:third wealth quartile, which may represent parents too poor for full out-of-state or 
21:573:44234:21:21:107:509:383:144:Times:144:Times:private  tuition  but  too  well  off  for  much  financial  aid.  Alternatively,  it  may  
21:574:44326:21:21:107:508:362:144:Times:144:Times:represent  selection:  students  from  the  bottom  wealth  quartile  are  less  likely  to  
21:575:44419:21:20:107:506:341:144:Times:144:Times:attend college at all – in Table 3 the average college attendee is in the 3rd quartile 
21:576:44506:20:21:108:508:321:144:Times:144:Times:– but those who do may be particularly motivated or subject to some affirmative 
21:577:44586:21:21:108:509:300:144:Times:144:Times:action  by  higher  quality  schools.  Starting  college  more  than  12  months  after  
21:578:44675:21:20:108:507:279:144:Times:144:Times:graduating from high school raises the undermatch probability by five percentage 
21:579:44756:20:21:108:509:259:144:Times:144:Times:points. We  think  of  starting  late  as  (among  other  things)  another  indicator  of  
21:580:44847:21:21:108:210:238:144:Times:144:Times:financial constraints. 
21:581:44870:21:20:108:510:217:144:Times:144:Times: Not  at  all  surprisingly,  parental  education  plays  a  key  role  in  driving  
21:582:44954:20:21:108:508:197:144:Times:144:Times:college  choices.  We  find  a  U-shaped  pattern  in  regard  to  parental  education  and  
21:583:45047:21:21:108:507:176:144:Times:144:Times:the probability of overmatching. Those with the least educated parents and those 
21:584:45128:21:21:108:510:155:144:Times:144:Times:with  the  most  educated  parents  have  the  highest  conditional  probabilities  of  
21:585:45216:21:20:108:510:134:144:Times:144:Times:overmatching;  both  groups  exceed  the  omitted  group  – the  highest  parental  
21:586:45300:20:0:108:506:114:144:Times:144:Times:education is completed high school – by over five percentage points. The opposite 
22:587:45385:0:21:108:508:673:144:Times:144:Times:pattern  holds  for  undermatching,  with  students  with  the  most  and  least  educated  
22:588:45477:21:21:108:507:652:144:Times:144:Times:parents having substantially lower probabilities of undermatching. These patterns 
22:589:45559:21:20:108:507:631:144:Times:144:Times:suggest  a  combination  of  disadvantage-based  affirmative  action  at  the  lower  end  
22:590:45650:20:21:108:509:611:144:Times:144:Times:of  the  parental  education  distribution  and  the  pursuit  of  college  quality  at  the  
22:591:45744:21:21:108:506:590:144:Times:144:Times:upper   end.   The   effects   of   having   less-educated   parents   may   again   reflect 
22:592:45837:21:21:108:508:569:144:Times:144:Times:selection:  students  from  households  where  no  parent  completed  high  school  are  
22:593:45926:21:20:108:506:548:144:Times:144:Times:unlikely to attend college, but those who do may have strong unobserved qualities 
22:594:46008:20:21:107:509:528:144:Times:144:Times:like  motivation.  Our  concerns  about  measurement  error  in  the  family  wealth  
22:595:46094:21:21:107:507:507:144:Times:144:Times:variables lead us to interpret the education variables partly as proxies for wealth, 
22:596:46179:21:20:107:507:486:144:Times:144:Times:but they also surely capture differences in tastes for education among households 
22:597:46261:20:21:107:485:466:144:Times:144:Times:as well as differences in information related to college application and choice. 
22:598:46341:21:21:108:508:445:144:Times:144:Times: Our  final  family  background  variables  measure  whether  the  student  took  
22:599:46422:21:20:107:507:424:144:Times:144:Times:courses outside of school and/or had a computer in the home. We interpret these 
22:600:46502:20:21:108:507:404:144:Times:144:Times:variables as rough proxies for parental enthusiasm about, and willingness to invest 
22:601:46586:21:21:108:508:383:144:Times:144:Times:in, education. Other than having had courses outside of school having a negative 
22:602:46667:21:21:108:360:362:144:Times:144:Times:effect on undermatching, we do not find much here. 
22:603:46718:21:20:108:509:341:144:Times:144:Times: Our  measures  of  context  include  indicators  for  three  of  the  four  census  
22:604:46802:20:21:108:509:321:144:Times:144:Times:regions  (the  Midwest  is  the  omitted  region),  a  rural  residence  indicator  and  
22:605:46891:21:21:108:506:300:144:Times:144:Times:variables measuring log median income and the percent of adults with a four-year 
22:606:46972:21:20:108:507:279:144:Times:144:Times:college degree in the student’s census tract. The region variables matter. Students 
22:607:47056:20:21:108:507:259:144:Times:144:Times:in  the  northeast  have  a  16  percentage  point  higher  probability  of  overmatching 
22:608:47145:21:21:108:507:238:144:Times:144:Times:and  an  11  percentage  point  lower  probability  of  undermatching than  students  in  
22:609:47235:21:20:107:507:217:144:Times:144:Times:the Midwest. Perhaps more surprisingly, students in the south and west also have 
22:610:47316:20:21:107:507:197:144:Times:144:Times:lower probabilities of undermatching than those in the Midwest. We suspect that 
22:611:47396:21:21:107:507:176:144:Times:144:Times:some of the regional differences in our estimates spring from regional differences 
22:612:47479:21:21:107:508:155:144:Times:144:Times:in  the  relative  importance  of  state  and  private  colleges.  In  contrast,  we  find  little  
22:613:47579:21:20:107:507:134:144:Times:144:Times:effect of living in a rural area, though we might expect one if colleges devote less 
22:614:47664:20:0:107:443:114:144:Times:144:Times:recruiting effort to rural high schools, as in Hoxby and Avery (2012). 
23:615:47738:0:21:108:506:673:144:Times:144:Times: The  variables  measuring  income  and  education  at  the  census  tract  level 
23:616:47819:21:21:108:507:652:144:Times:144:Times:both positively affect overmatching  and negatively affect undermatching, though 
23:617:47900:21:20:107:508:631:144:Times:144:Times:only  the  education  effects are  precisely  estimated.  A  standard  deviation  increase  
23:618:47992:20:21:107:506:611:144:Times:144:Times:in the share of adults with a BA, a change of nine percentage points on an average 
23:619:48075:21:21:107:509:590:144:Times:144:Times:of  21%,  increases  the  probability  of  overmatch  by  two  percentage  points  and  
23:620:48163:21:21:107:507:569:144:Times:144:Times:lowers   the probability of undermatch by three percentage points. These variables 
23:621:48246:21:20:107:507:548:144:Times:144:Times:capture a mix of primary and secondary school quality (via residential sorting as 
23:622:48328:20:21:107:507:528:144:Times:144:Times:well  as  voting  behavior),  information  about  college,  and  social  pressure  directed  
23:623:48421:21:21:107:506:507:144:Times:144:Times:toward  higher  college  quality.  Given  the  wealth  of  variables  we  condition  on  at 
23:624:48513:21:20:107:506:486:144:Times:144:Times:the  student  level,  the  importance  of  the  census  tract  level  education  variable 
23:625:48603:20:21:107:171:466:144:Times:144:Times:surprised us. 
23:626:48617:21:21:107:507:445:144:Times:144:Times: Among  the  variables  drawn  from  the  high  school  survey,  the  fraction  of  
23:627:48700:21:20:107:506:424:144:Times:144:Times:teachers with an advanced degree has no clear effect (and a zero point estimate for 
23:628:48784:20:21:107:507:404:144:Times:144:Times:overmatching).  This  finding  comports  with  a  large  literature  – e.g.  Rivkin, 
23:629:48869:21:21:107:506:383:144:Times:144:Times:Hanushek  and  Kain  (2005)  – that  finds  that  teacher  advanced  degrees  have  little 
23:630:48959:21:21:107:508:362:144:Times:144:Times:effect on  student  outcomes.  High  school  student  characteristics  do  matter  in  our  
23:631:49051:21:20:107:508:341:144:Times:144:Times:analysis.  The  probability  of  overmatching  increases  in  the  fraction  of  students  
23:632:49142:20:21:107:508:321:144:Times:144:Times:going  on  to  either  two-year  colleges  or  four-year  colleges.  Both  variables  also  
23:633:49234:21:21:107:509:300:144:Times:144:Times:decrease  the  probability  of  undermatching,  though  the  estimates  have  smaller  
23:634:49321:21:20:107:509:279:144:Times:144:Times:magnitudes  and  less  precision  than  for  overmatching. The  fraction  going  to  a  
23:635:49409:20:21:107:510:259:144:Times:144:Times:four-year  variable  likely  reflects  better  information  and  guidance,  as  well  as  
23:636:49499:21:21:107:506:238:144:Times:144:Times:students following their friends. The fraction going to a two-year variable we find 
23:637:49583:21:20:107:508:217:144:Times:144:Times:more  puzzling,  though  it  may  reflect  a  more  select  group  of  students,  and  thus  a  
23:638:49679:20:21:107:507:197:144:Times:144:Times:group of students more likely to overmatch, going on to four-year college within 
23:639:49760:21:21:107:506:176:144:Times:144:Times:the  high  school.   Taken together, the  positive  effects  of  parental  education  along 
23:640:49852:21:21:107:507:155:144:Times:144:Times:with  measures  of  information  about  college  on  the  probability  of  overmatch 
23:641:49937:21:20:107:506:134:144:Times:144:Times:suggest that more informed students (and their families) prefer to overmatch. That 
23:642:50020:20:0:107:506:114:144:Times:144:Times:is, they view the benefits of attending a higher quality college as outweighing any 
24:643:50107:0:21:108:510:673:144:Times:144:Times:possible  costs  of  mismatch.    Manski  and  Wise  (1983)  also  find  that  students  
24:644:50196:21:21:108:485:652:144:Times:144:Times:prefer colleges where the average SAT score is slightly higher than their own. 
24:645:50274:21:20:108:510:631:144:Times:144:Times: The  final  set  of  covariates  summarizes  state  higher  education  policy.  
24:646:50354:20:21:108:507:611:144:Times:144:Times:Average four year in-state tuition at public colleges (entered in log form to allow 
24:647:50438:21:21:108:506:590:144:Times:144:Times:for a non-linear relationship) decreases the probability of both overmatching  and 
24:648:50521:21:21:107:509:569:144:Times:144:Times:undermatching,  though the  latter  effect  does  not  attain  statistical  significance.  
24:649:50612:21:20:107:508:548:144:Times:144:Times:This  pattern  may  indicate  that  states  with  relatively  high  four-year  tuition  do  a  
24:650:50707:20:21:107:508:528:144:Times:144:Times:better  job  of  matching  students  to  colleges,  perhaps  because  the  system  offers  
24:651:50798:21:21:107:509:507:144:Times:144:Times:more  choices  of  quality  and  location.  Or  it  may  be  that  lower  in-state  tuition  
24:652:50891:21:20:107:507:486:144:Times:144:Times:induces students  at  the  margin  to  remain  in-state and  in  the  public  sector  rather 
24:653:50984:20:21:107:508:466:144:Times:144:Times:than  seeking  better  matches  in  the  private  sector  or  in  other  states.  The  negative  
24:654:51081:21:21:107:508:445:144:Times:144:Times:effect  on  undermatching may  result  from  high  four-year  college  prices  pushing  
24:655:51169:21:20:107:507:424:144:Times:144:Times:some students to be undermatched at a two-year school rather than at a four-year 
24:656:51250:20:21:107:144:404:144:Times:144:Times:school. 
24:657:51258:21:21:107:508:383:144:Times:144:Times: A  more  obvious  interpretation  follows  our  finding  that  having  a  public  
24:658:51340:21:21:107:509:362:144:Times:144:Times:four-year  that  is  a  good  match  within  50  miles  (and  within  the  state)  leads  to  
24:659:51434:21:20:107:508:341:144:Times:144:Times:almost a five percentage point decrease in the probability of undermatching. This 
24:660:51516:20:21:107:507:321:144:Times:144:Times:suggests that a desire to live nearby, whether to save money by living at home or 
24:661:51598:21:21:107:511:300:144:Times:144:Times:to   stay   near   family   and   high   school   friends   plays   a   key   role   in   driving   
24:662:51698:21:20:107:512:279:144:Times:144:Times:undermatching. The   effect   on   overmatching   is   small   and   not   statistically   
24:663:51789:20:21:107:508:259:144:Times:144:Times:significant,  but  in  the  expected  sign. Similarly  straightforward  to  understand  is  
24:664:51881:21:21:107:511:238:144:Times:144:Times:that   having   a   matched   private   within   50   miles   reduces   the   probability   of   
24:665:51978:21:20:107:507:217:144:Times:144:Times:undermatching as well, by nearly five percentage points. Students make tradeoffs 
24:666:52059:20:21:107:508:197:144:Times:144:Times:between  tuition,  travel  and  room  and  board costs,  and  quality  at  the  margin  in  
24:667:52151:21:21:107:508:176:144:Times:144:Times:reasonable ways.  Less  easy  to  interpret  is  the  strong  positive  effect  of  having  a  
24:668:52246:21:21:107:506:155:144:Times:144:Times:well-matched private college within 50 miles on the probability of overmatching, 
24:669:52327:21:20:107:509:134:144:Times:144:Times:which  it  increases  by  0.106. Taken  together,  our  findings  on  the  substantively  
24:670:52417:20:0:107:507:114:144:Times:144:Times:important role of distance in college application and enrollment generally parallel 
25:671:52504:0:21:108:511:673:144:Times:144:Times:those  in  the  broader  literature:  see  e.g.  Griffith  and  Rothstein  (2009)  and  Turley  
25:672:52600:21:21:108:149:652:144:Times:144:Times:(2009).  
25:673:52609:21:20:108:359:631:144:Times:144:Times:2. Including students who start at two-year colleges 
25:674:52661:20:21:108:508:611:144:Times:144:Times:In  addition  to  attending  a  lower-quality  4-year  college,  students  can  also  end  up  
25:675:52756:21:21:107:509:590:144:Times:144:Times:undermatched  by  starting  at  a  2-year  college.  Reynolds  (2012)  and  Long  and  
25:676:52843:21:21:107:508:569:144:Times:144:Times:Kurlaender  (2009)  show that students  who  start  at  a  two-year  college  with  the  
25:677:52932:21:20:107:507:548:144:Times:144:Times:goal  of  obtaining  a  four-year  degree  represent  a  substantively important group 
25:678:53019:20:21:107:506:528:144:Times:144:Times:(albeit  one  with  a  low  probability  of  ever  attaining  a  four-year  degree).  This 
25:679:53110:21:21:107:507:507:144:Times:144:Times:section reports on what happens when we expand our analysis to include two-year 
25:680:53190:21:20:107:506:486:144:Times:144:Times:starters  using  the  6-factor  college  quality  index.  For  this  analysis,  we  follow 
25:681:53281:20:21:107:511:466:144:Times:144:Times:Reynolds  (2012)  and  include  only  2-year  college  starters  who  indicate  an  
25:682:53365:21:21:107:507:445:144:Times:144:Times:intention to complete a 4-year college degree at the time they start college.5 When 
25:683:53449:21:20:108:507:424:144:Times:144:Times:we use the 6-factor measure of college quality and construct percentiles of college 
25:684:53533:20:21:108:507:404:144:Times:144:Times:quality  across  a  pooled  sample  of  2- and  4-year  schools,  70%  of  the  2-year 
25:685:53620:21:21:108:507:383:144:Times:144:Times:schools are in the lowest quality quartile and almost none are in the top half of the 
25:686:53706:21:21:108:510:362:144:Times:144:Times:quality  distribution. This  broadly  comports  with  Stange’s  (2012)  analysis  of  
25:687:53792:21:20:108:340:341:144:Times:144:Times:community college quality; see e.g. his Table 1. 
25:688:53840:20:21:108:509:321:144:Times:144:Times: Table  5B  presents  our  analysis  of  mismatch  among  all  college  starters.  
25:689:53922:21:21:108:511:300:144:Times:144:Times:The  percentiles  of  ability  and  college  quality,  and  thus  our  definitions  of  
25:690:54010:21:20:108:507:279:144:Times:144:Times:mismatch,  are  now  constructed  using  the  set  of  all  2-year  and  4-year  colleges  in  
25:691:54105:20:21:107:507:259:144:Times:144:Times:IPEDS  and  all  2-year and  4-year  college  starters  in  the  NLSY97.  In  general,  the 
25:692:54197:21:21:107:508:238:144:Times:144:Times:qualitative  results  parallel  those  in  Table  5A,  and  even  the  average  derivatives  
25:693:54290:21:20:107:510:217:144:Times:144:Times:themselves  often  do  not  change  by  much.  We  highlight the  most  interesting  
25:694:54375:20:21:107:260:197:144:Times:144:Times:changes in our discussion here. 
25:695:54407:21:21:107:508:176:144:Times:144:Times: First,  note  that  adding  in  students  who  start  at  a  2-year  college  increases  
25:696:54496:21:39:107:510:155:144:Times:144:Times:the  sample  size  substantially  from  2,125  to  3,805.  Second,  both  black  and  
25:697:54582:39:0:108:415:116:65:Times:144:Times:5 We provide details on how we construct this filter in the on-line appendix. 
25:698:54661:0:0:108:255:124:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
26:699:54710:0:21:108:509:673:144:Times:144:Times:Hispanic  students  are  now  more  likely  to  be  overmatched  for  their  college,  not  
26:700:54802:21:21:108:508:652:144:Times:144:Times:less,  and  less  likely  to  be  undermatched,  a  pattern  consistent  with  affirmative  
26:701:54894:21:20:108:507:631:144:Times:144:Times:action. Third, students from families in the top half of the wealth distribution are 
26:702:54979:20:21:108:508:611:144:Times:144:Times:now  more  likely  to  be  overmatched  than  students  from  less  wealthy  families  as  
26:703:55070:21:21:108:507:590:144:Times:144:Times:well as less likely to be undermatched. Fourth, the probability of overmatching is 
26:704:55153:21:21:108:508:569:144:Times:144:Times:now  (roughly)  monotone  in  parental  education,  but  quite  non-linear,  with  all  of  
26:705:55245:21:20:108:507:548:144:Times:144:Times:the action at the margin between high school completion and some college. Since 
26:706:55325:20:21:108:508:528:144:Times:144:Times:this  analysis  includes  many  more  less-selective  colleges,  this  shift  supports  the  
26:707:55418:21:21:107:509:507:144:Times:144:Times:sample  selection  interpretation  of  the  positive  relationship  between  the  lowest  
26:708:55508:21:20:107:509:486:144:Times:144:Times:parental  education  group  and  the  probability  of  overmatching  in  our  baseline  
26:709:55596:20:21:107:507:466:144:Times:144:Times:analysis.    Fifth,  4-year in-state tuition at  public  colleges  now  has  a  (much) 
26:710:55683:21:21:108:506:445:144:Times:144:Times:stronger  negative  effect  on  undermatching  than  on  overmatching.  Higher  2-year 
26:711:55770:21:20:108:511:424:144:Times:144:Times:state  tuition,  which  we  include  in  this  model  for  the  first  time,  decreases  
26:712:55859:20:21:108:508:404:144:Times:144:Times:overmatching and increases undermatching. We expected the reverse, with lower 
26:713:55937:21:21:108:507:383:144:Times:144:Times:2-year tuition pushing people to the 2-year system and thus toward undermatching 
26:714:56018:21:21:108:507:362:144:Times:144:Times:in some cases. In-state 2-year and 4-year tuition are tightly correlated across states 
26:715:56105:21:20:108:513:341:144:Times:144:Times:and  may  partially  reflect  the  breadth  and  quality  of  in-state  college  options.    
26:716:56198:20:21:108:507:321:144:Times:144:Times:Finally,  the  percentage of  the  student’s  high  school  class  going  on  to  a  2-year 
26:717:56290:21:21:108:513:300:144:Times:144:Times:college switches   from   imprecisely   decreasing   undermatching   to   strongly   
26:718:56375:21:20:108:508:279:144:Times:144:Times:increasing  it  and  decreasing  overmatch.  This  results  from  the  fact  that  what  in  
26:719:56468:20:21:108:512:259:144:Times:144:Times:Table   5A   was   pushing   people   out   of   the   sample   now   pushes   them   into   
26:720:56561:21:21:108:509:238:144:Times:144:Times:undermatching  when  we  include  the  2-year  schools.  For  a  similar  reason,  the  
26:721:56649:21:20:108:507:217:144:Times:144:Times:percentage  of  the  high  school  class  going  on  to  a  4-year  school  now  has  a  much  
26:722:56744:20:21:108:307:197:144:Times:144:Times:larger deterrent effect on undermatching. 
26:723:56785:21:21:108:509:176:144:Times:144:Times: Re-estimating  the  percentiles  including  the  2-year  group  increases  the  
26:724:56865:21:21:108:508:155:144:Times:144:Times:amount  of  underlying  quality  spanned  by  a  given  percentile  difference.  This  in  
26:725:56956:21:20:108:510:134:144:Times:144:Times:turn  means  that  re-estimating  the  percentiles  will  change  the  coding  of  the  
26:726:57044:20:0:108:506:114:144:Times:144:Times:mismatch  variables  even  in  the  top  part  of  the  distribution,  as  some  high  ability 
27:727:57142:0:21:108:508:673:144:Times:144:Times:students who were more than 20 percentile points away from their college before 
27:728:57222:21:21:108:508:652:144:Times:144:Times:will  not  be  after  the  re-estimation.    Online Appendix  Table  OA-1 presents  our  
27:729:57311:21:20:108:507:631:144:Times:144:Times:multivariate  analysis  using  the  6-factor  college  quality  measure,  but  constructing  
27:730:57404:20:21:107:507:611:144:Times:144:Times:the college quality and ability percentiles from only the sample of 4-year colleges 
27:731:57488:21:21:108:508:590:144:Times:144:Times:and  starters.  The  first  set  of  results  includes  only  4-year  starters,  although  the  
27:732:57584:21:21:108:503:569:144:Times:144:Times:sample  still  increases  somewhat  because  we  can  include  students  who  start  at  4-
27:733:57675:21:20:108:507:548:144:Times:144:Times:year colleges that do not report SAT scores, while the second includes all starters. 
27:734:57760:20:21:108:511:528:144:Times:144:Times:The  results  parallel  those  obtained  when  including  all  college  starters  and  
27:735:57847:21:21:108:513:507:144:Times:144:Times:recalculating   the   percentiles,   suggesting   that   the   differences   between   this   
27:736:57941:21:20:108:509:486:144:Times:144:Times:specification  and  our  baseline  have  more  to  do  with  the  sample  expansion  than  
27:737:58032:20:21:108:278:466:144:Times:144:Times:with the redefinition of mismatch.  
27:738:58068:21:21:108:285:445:144:Times:144:Times:3. Alternative measures of mismatch 
27:739:58103:21:20:108:507:424:144:Times:144:Times:Table 5C presents our findings using our two alternative definitions of mismatch. 
27:740:58185:20:21:108:507:404:144:Times:144:Times:Consider first the two left columns of Table 5C, which display estimates from the 
27:741:58267:21:21:108:509:383:144:Times:144:Times:definition  based  solely  on  the  student’s  SAT  score  relative  to  the  average  SAT  
27:742:58359:21:21:108:507:362:144:Times:144:Times:score of the incoming class at her college. This multivariate analysis corresponds 
27:743:58442:21:20:108:507:341:144:Times:144:Times:to the joint distribution in Table 1B, discussed above. This definition of mismatch 
27:744:58525:20:21:108:509:321:144:Times:144:Times:relies  on  an  ability  measure  observed  by  colleges,  so  it  does  not  capture  the  
27:745:58617:21:21:108:508:300:144:Times:144:Times:mismatch  that  arises  because  colleges  have  imperfect  information  about  the  true  
27:746:58708:21:20:108:507:279:144:Times:144:Times:ability of applicants or because students misestimate their own abilities relative to 
27:747:58794:20:21:108:510:259:144:Times:144:Times:other  college  applicants.  Additionally,  the  SAT  score  embodies  some  of  the  
27:748:58880:21:21:108:508:238:144:Times:144:Times:guidance  students  have  about  applying  for  college  if  this  information  leads  them  
27:749:58973:21:20:108:507:217:144:Times:144:Times:to put extra effort into preparing for (or re-taking) the SAT or ACT exams. On the 
27:750:59056:20:21:108:508:197:144:Times:144:Times:other hand, SAT scores measure ability closer to the time of college application. 
27:751:59138:21:21:108:508:176:144:Times:144:Times:Because  of  the  high  stakes  of  the  SAT,  there  is  less  risk  than  in  the  ASVAB  of  
27:752:59234:21:21:108:472:155:144:Times:144:Times:under-measuring ability because students have not taken the test seriously.  
27:753:59311:21:20:144:508:134:144:Times:144:Times:Perhaps  most  importantly,  this  analysis  requires  that  we  limit  the  sample  
27:754:59396:20:0:108:507:114:144:Times:144:Times:to students reporting an SAT score, which they do by allowing the NLSY to view 
28:755:59478:0:21:108:509:673:144:Times:144:Times:a  high  school  transcript  that  includes  standardized  test  scores.  As  a  result,  the  
28:756:59573:21:21:108:507:652:144:Times:144:Times:sample size falls from 2,125 to 1,279.6 The loss comes from two different missing 
28:757:59655:21:20:108:508:631:144:Times:144:Times:data  processes:  about  half  comes  from  students  not  releasing  their  transcripts  to  
28:758:59749:20:21:108:510:611:144:Times:144:Times:the  NLSY  and  about  half  comes  from  schools  not  providing  SAT  scores  on  
28:759:59833:21:21:108:259:590:144:Times:144:Times:transcripts that do get released. 
28:760:59866:21:21:108:515:569:144:Times:144:Times: Many of the estimates in the SAT analysis in Table 5C    differ substantially 
28:761:59944:21:20:108:507:548:144:Times:144:Times:in magnitude and/or precision from the corresponding estimates in Table 5A. But 
28:762:60024:20:21:108:509:528:144:Times:144:Times:in  only  a  handful  of  cases  does  the  average  derivative  estimate  attain  statistical  
28:763:60120:21:21:108:506:507:144:Times:144:Times:significance in the two analyses, but with different signs. We confine our remarks 
28:764:60203:21:20:108:511:486:144:Times:144:Times:here  to  these  cases.  First,  as  expected,  the  mechanical  effect  of  ability  on  
28:765:60293:20:21:108:508:466:144:Times:144:Times:mismatch  moves  from  the  ASVAB1  percentile,  which  now  has  a  positive  effect  
28:766:60380:21:21:108:510:445:144:Times:144:Times:on  overmatching,  to  the  SAT  percentile,  which  now  has  a  negative  effect  on  
28:767:60468:21:20:108:508:424:144:Times:144:Times:overmatching  and  a  positive  effect  on  undermatching.  Being  in  the  south  census  
28:768:60559:20:21:107:509:404:144:Times:144:Times:region  goes  from  having  a  positive  effect  on  overmatching  in  Table  5A  to  a  
28:769:60648:21:21:107:507:383:144:Times:144:Times:negative  effect  in  Table  5B,  possibly  due  to  issues  with  the  ACT  to  SAT  score  
28:770:60741:21:21:107:507:362:144:Times:144:Times:translation, though the South is a mixed SAT / ACT region. Finally, the patterns 
28:771:60822:21:20:107:507:341:144:Times:144:Times:related to parental education change around a bit. In the SAT analysis, unlike the 
28:772:60905:20:21:107:507:321:144:Times:144:Times:analysis in Table 5A, the probability of overmatching increases monotonically in 
28:773:60986:21:21:107:508:300:144:Times:144:Times:parental  education,  while  the  probability  of  undermatching  continues  to  have  a  
28:774:61076:21:20:108:508:279:144:Times:144:Times:hill  shape  with  the  maximum  for  students  whose  most  educated  parent  is  a  high  
28:775:61168:20:21:108:507:259:144:Times:144:Times:school completer. The change may reflect different investments in preparation for 
28:776:61250:21:21:108:194:238:144:Times:144:Times:the SAT or ACT. 
28:777:61265:21:20:108:507:217:144:Times:144:Times: As  described  in  Section  IV,  our  third  measure  of  mismatch  exploits data 
28:778:61347:20:35:108:510:197:144:Times:144:Times:from  the  IPEDS  on  the  inter-quartile  range  (IQR)  of  the  SAT  scores  in  the  
28:779:61435:35:18:108:507:162:65:Times:99:Times:6 The survey also includes self-reported SAT/ACT scores.  We prefer the transcript measures for 
28:780:61530:18:11:108:508:144:99:Times:99:Times:two  reasons.    The  self-reported  SAT  scores  are  given  in  100-point  bins,  which  would  add  
28:781:61633:11:11:108:507:133:99:Times:99:Times:substantial  measurement  error.    The  SAT  scores  reported  on  transcripts  by  the  high  schools  fall  
28:782:61744:11:12:108:509:122:99:Times:99:Times:within  these  self-reported  bins  for  only  70%  of  respondents  and  below  the  bin  for  25%  of  
28:783:61849:12:0:107:389:110:99:Times:144:Times:respondents, suggesting a pattern of score inflation in the self reports. 
28:784:61925:0:0:108:255:170:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
29:785:61974:0:21:108:509:673:144:Times:144:Times:entering  class  at  different  colleges.  In  this  analysis,  we  continue  to  use  SAT  
29:786:62066:21:21:108:507:652:144:Times:144:Times:scores  as  the  measure  of  student  ability  but  define  mismatch  for  each  student  as  
29:787:62161:21:20:108:506:631:144:Times:144:Times:having  an  own  SAT  score  outside  the  inter-quartile  range  for  the  college.  This 
29:788:62252:20:21:108:507:611:144:Times:144:Times:measure captures the notion that having an SAT score different from the mean by 
29:789:62332:21:21:108:507:590:144:Times:144:Times:some absolute amount means something substantively different at a college whose 
29:790:62412:21:21:108:507:569:144:Times:144:Times:students have highly varying SAT scores than it does at a college where students’ 
29:791:62494:21:20:108:509:548:144:Times:144:Times:SAT  scores  cluster  in  a  narrow  band  around  the  mean.  The  right-hand  side  of  
29:792:62584:20:21:107:508:528:144:Times:144:Times:Table  5C presents  the  estimates  using  this  definition  of  mismatch;  note  that  we  
29:793:62676:21:21:107:509:507:144:Times:144:Times:lose  some  observations  due  to item  non-response  for  the  SAT  quartiles  in  the  
29:794:62765:21:20:107:508:486:144:Times:144:Times:IPEDS    data. Contrary  to  our  expectations,  the  big  picture  of  the  results  does  not  
29:795:62862:20:21:107:508:466:144:Times:144:Times:change  much  relative  to  the  estimates  on  the  left-hand  side  of  Table  5C,  though  
29:796:62956:21:21:107:508:445:144:Times:144:Times:particular estimates do move  around,  sometimes  non-trivially,  and  become  more  
29:797:63041:21:20:108:510:424:144:Times:144:Times:or  less  precise.  The  most  surprising  change  concerns  the  parental  education  
29:798:63128:20:21:108:508:404:144:Times:144:Times:variables, which have much less effect on the probability of overmatching in this 
29:799:63210:21:21:108:511:383:144:Times:144:Times:specification,   essentially   zero   for   students   whose   best   educated   parent   has   
29:800:63306:21:21:108:507:362:144:Times:144:Times:completed at least high school. We conjecture that the underlying mechanism has 
29:801:63386:21:20:108:506:341:144:Times:144:Times:to  do  with changes  in  who  gets  coded  as  mismatched  in  states  with  more 
29:802:63469:20:21:107:229:321:144:Times:144:Times:heterogeneous flagships. 
29:803:63494:21:21:107:297:300:144:Times:144:Times:4. Match quality versus college quality 
29:804:63534:21:20:107:506:279:144:Times:144:Times:We  tested  the  null  hypotheses  that,  for  each  variable  in  our  empirical  model,  the 
29:805:63629:20:21:107:507:259:144:Times:144:Times:sum  of  the  average  derivative  in  the  probit  for  overmatching  and  the  negative  of  
29:806:63724:21:21:107:508:238:144:Times:144:Times:the  average  derivative  in  the  probit  for  undermatching equals  zero.  In  substance,  
29:807:63817:21:20:107:507:217:144:Times:144:Times:this null  corresponds  to  symmetric  effects,  meaning  that  analyses  that  impose 
29:808:63904:20:21:107:507:197:144:Times:144:Times:symmetry do not miss much. Online appendix Table OA-9 presents these results. 
29:809:63982:21:21:107:508:176:144:Times:144:Times:We  reject  the  null  for  only  two  of  the  30  coefficients  at  the  five  percent  level:  
29:810:64080:21:21:107:507:155:144:Times:144:Times:living in the south census region and having a well-matched public college within 
29:811:64162:21:20:107:504:134:144:Times:144:Times:50 miles. The latter we expected, the former corresponds to a monotone but non-
29:812:64241:20:0:107:509:114:144:Times:144:Times:linear  relationship.  As  we  would  expect  to  reject  one  or  two  by  chance,  and  
30:813:64334:0:21:108:509:673:144:Times:144:Times:because  underlying  non-linearities  in  the  relationship  between  our  constructed  
30:814:64422:21:21:108:507:652:144:Times:144:Times:ability and college quality indices may cloud the interpretation of the tests, we do 
30:815:64507:21:20:108:510:631:144:Times:144:Times:not want  to  over-emphasize  these  findings.  Still,  we  were  surprised.  In  an  
30:816:64593:20:21:107:508:611:144:Times:144:Times:important sense, students and their families care about college quality, not match 
30:817:64676:21:21:107:146:590:144:Times:144:Times:quality. 
30:818:64685:21:21:107:268:569:144:Times:144:Times:5. Additional sensitivity analyses 
30:819:64720:21:20:107:509:548:144:Times:144:Times:We  conducted  a  wide  variety  of  sensitivity  analyses  related  to  our  baseline  
30:820:64808:20:21:107:508:528:144:Times:144:Times:specification,  a  handful  of  which  merit  explicit  mention  here.  Appendix  Table  
30:821:64897:21:21:107:507:507:144:Times:144:Times:OA-3 presents results from defining mismatch as in Table 5A, but with 10 and 30 
30:822:64977:21:20:107:508:486:144:Times:144:Times:percentile  point  differences,  rather  than  20.  Changing  the  cutoff  used  to  define  
30:823:65070:20:21:107:354:466:144:Times:144:Times:mismatch does not change the qualitative findings. 
30:824:65120:21:21:107:506:445:144:Times:144:Times: To test the sensitivity of the results to removing students who could not be 
30:825:65197:21:20:107:509:424:144:Times:144:Times:undermatched  under  the  20  percentile  point  definition  because  their  ASVAB  
30:826:65281:20:21:107:507:404:144:Times:144:Times:percentile was too low, or who could not be overmatched because it was too high, 
30:827:65362:21:21:107:506:383:144:Times:144:Times:we repeated the analysis using only students with ASVAB percentiles in (20,80). 
30:828:65442:21:21:107:509:362:144:Times:144:Times:Restricting  the  sample  in  this  way  does  not  change  the  qualitative  results  as  
30:829:65533:21:20:107:220:341:144:Times:144:Times:shown in Table OA-4.  
30:830:65555:20:21:143:511:321:144:Times:144:Times:Inspired   by   Das   and   Imberman   (2012),   who   find   higher   returns   to   
30:831:65641:21:21:107:507:300:144:Times:144:Times:attending private colleges conditioning on college quality as measured by average 
30:832:65723:21:20:107:508:279:144:Times:144:Times:SAT  score,  we  repeated  the  analysis  excluding  students  at  private  universities.  
30:833:65814:20:21:107:506:259:144:Times:144:Times:Restricting our sample to public universities, which often have simple and binding 
30:834:65897:21:21:107:506:238:144:Times:144:Times:admission   cut-off   rules,   also   makes   our   selection   on   observed   variables 
30:835:65986:21:20:107:509:217:144:Times:144:Times:assumption  particularly  plausible.  However,  Table  OA-5  reveals  that  this,  too,  
30:836:66075:20:21:107:307:197:144:Times:144:Times:does not change the qualitative findings.  
30:837:66118:21:21:143:511:176:144:Times:144:Times:Noting   that   Black   and   Smith   (2004,   2006)   perform   their   analyses

30:839:66290:21:20:107:508:134:144:Times:144:Times:those  results;  once  again,  the  qualitative  patterns,  much  to  our  surprise  in  this  
30:840:66385:20:0:107:507:114:144:Times:144:Times:case,  do  not  change.  We  also  looked  at  subgroups  defined  by  race/ethnicity  and  
31:841:66480:0:21:108:511:673:144:Times:144:Times:by  parental  education  and  including  interactions  between  race/ethnicity  and  
31:842:66565:21:21:108:506:652:144:Times:144:Times:gender  and  other  key  variables. In  all  cases,  the  results  (not  reported)  paralleled 
31:843:66660:21:20:108:314:631:144:Times:144:Times:the results for the full sample in Table 5A. 
31:844:66704:20:21:108:507:611:144:Times:144:Times: Concerned about interpreting the results from multiple measures of ability 
31:845:66779:21:21:108:508:590:144:Times:144:Times:all  conditional  on  one  another  (i.e.  ASVAB1,  ASVAB2,  high  school  grades  and  
31:846:66867:21:21:108:510:569:144:Times:144:Times:SAT  score  in  the  baseline  model),  we  estimated  a  model  including  only  one  
31:847:66954:21:20:108:509:548:144:Times:144:Times:ability  measure,  namely  ASVAB1. As  revealed  in  Table  OA-7,  this  does  not  
31:848:67038:20:21:107:508:528:144:Times:144:Times:change  the  qualitative  results.  Concerned  about  the  NLSY97  wealth  measure,  in  
31:849:67127:21:21:107:507:507:144:Times:144:Times:Table OA-8 we estimated specifications including wealth in log form, rather than 
31:850:67208:21:20:107:508:486:144:Times:144:Times:as  indicators  for  quartiles,  and  including  income,  also  in  log  form,  in  place  of  
31:851:67303:20:21:107:342:466:144:Times:144:Times:wealth. The qualitative results remain unmoved.

31:853:67351:21:20:107:191:424:144:Times:144:Times:VII. Conclusion 
31:854:67367:20:21:107:507:404:144:Times:144:Times:Our analysis of college application and attendance using the NLSY-97 sample of 
31:855:67446:21:21:107:508:383:144:Times:144:Times:recent  college  entrants  yielded  five  main  findings.  First,  using  our  definition  of  
31:856:67541:21:21:107:512:362:144:Times:144:Times:academic   mismatch   between   students   and   colleges,   we   find   substantively   
31:857:67630:21:20:107:512:341:144:Times:144:Times:important   amounts   of   both   undermatching   and   overmatching,   though   not   
31:858:67717:20:21:107:507:321:144:Times:144:Times:noticeably  more  than  was  present  in  the  earlier  NLSY-79  cohort.  Second,  this 
31:859:67805:21:21:107:512:300:144:Times:144:Times:mismatch largely results from choices made by students   and their families, not by 
31:860:67889:21:20:108:507:279:144:Times:144:Times:college admissions offices. The vast majority of students who end up mismatched 
31:861:67969:20:21:108:507:259:144:Times:144:Times:either did not apply to any well-matched schools or were accepted to at least one 
31:862:68051:21:21:108:508:238:144:Times:144:Times:well-matched  school  but attended  a  mismatched  school  instead.  Third,  we  find  
31:863:68138:21:20:108:509:217:144:Times:144:Times:some  evidence  that  financial  constraints  lead  some  students  to  undermatch,  as  
31:864:68227:20:21:108:399:197:144:Times:144:Times:students from the wealthiest families undermatch less often. 
31:865:68288:21:21:144:508:176:144:Times:144:Times:Fourth, information matters, though not in the way we expected it to. We 
31:866:68361:21:21:108:508:155:144:Times:144:Times:thought more informed students would have a lower probability of both types of 
31:867:68440:21:20:108:507:134:144:Times:144:Times:mismatch. Instead we found that our proxies for information lower the probability 
31:868:68522:20:0:108:507:114:144:Times:144:Times:of undermatching but  raise  the  probability  of  overmatching.  We  interpret  this  as  
32:869:68616:0:21:108:509:673:144:Times:144:Times:evidence  that  informed  students  and  their  families  believe  that  the  benefits  of  
32:870:68708:21:21:108:469:652:144:Times:144:Times:college quality more than compensate for any possible costs of overmatch. 
32:871:68782:21:20:144:508:631:144:Times:144:Times:Fifth,  we  find  that  students  with  a  well-matched  public  college  within  50  
32:872:68868:20:21:108:507:611:144:Times:144:Times:miles are less likely to mismatch in either direction. In-state tuition policies often 
32:873:68955:21:21:107:506:590:144:Times:144:Times:make attending a home state college much less expensive than other options; and 
32:874:69035:21:21:107:507:569:144:Times:144:Times:a nearby college allows living at home or, at least, lower travel costs to visit. At 
32:875:69120:21:20:107:507:548:144:Times:144:Times:the margin, students trade off these costs against match and quality in reasonable 
32:876:69203:20:21:107:507:528:144:Times:144:Times:ways. This supports our view of the reasonableness of looking at mismatch from 
32:877:69282:21:21:107:460:507:144:Times:144:Times:the viewpoint of rational, but possibly ill-informed, students and parents. 
32:878:69358:21:20:107:507:486:144:Times:144:Times: We close with two big picture points. First, just because we find evidence 
32:879:69433:20:21:107:510:466:144:Times:144:Times:that  more  informed  students  and  their  families  think  college  quality  trumps  
32:880:69520:21:21:107:507:445:144:Times:144:Times:concerns  about  overmatch  does  not  make  it  so.  Students  and  parents  believe  lots  
32:881:69613:21:20:107:508:424:144:Times:144:Times:of  things  contrary  to  the  evidence;  this  particular  belief  might  belong  to  that  set.  
32:882:69712:20:21:107:508:404:144:Times:144:Times:In  fact,  given  the  mixed  findings  in  the  small  existing  (academic,  rather  than  
32:883:69804:21:21:107:507:383:144:Times:144:Times:anecdotal) literature – see, e.g. Alon and Tienda (2005), Arcidiacono et al. (2012), 
32:884:69889:21:21:107:507:362:144:Times:144:Times:Arcidiacono et al. (2013), Black, Daniel and Smith (2005, Table A.7), Bowen et 
32:885:69968:21:20:107:506:341:144:Times:144:Times:al.  (2009), Light  and  Strayer  (2000),  and  Sander  and  Taylor  (2012)  –  students 
32:886:70057:20:21:107:507:321:144:Times:144:Times:deciding  where  to  attend  college  will  have  to  wait  a  while  to  get  a  clear  signal  
32:887:70154:21:21:107:510:300:144:Times:144:Times:regarding  the  evidence.  We  have  our  own  paper,  Dillon  and  Smith  (2013)  
32:888:70237:21:20:107:449:279:144:Times:144:Times:underway on this topic, building on the data and findings in this paper. 
32:889:70310:20:21:143:506:259:144:Times:144:Times:Second,  the  optimal  amount  of  mismatch  does  not  equal  zero. Sallee, 
32:890:70387:21:21:107:506:238:144:Times:144:Times:Resch and Courant (2008) show that in a simple model of university systems with 
32:891:70467:21:20:107:509:217:144:Times:144:Times:a  fixed  cost  of  establishing  each  university  and  complementarity  in  production  
32:892:70557:20:21:107:507:197:144:Times:144:Times:between expenditures per student and student ability, the optimal system consists 
32:893:70639:21:21:107:507:176:144:Times:144:Times:of  exact  matching  as  we  have  defined  it:  i.e.  a  set  of  colleges  ordered  by  quality  
32:894:70738:21:21:107:509:155:144:Times:144:Times:where  the  top  quality  college  serves  the  most  able  students,  the  second  best  
32:895:70828:21:20:107:511:134:144:Times:144:Times:college   serves   the   next   most   able   students   and   so   on.   Specific,   and   not   
32:896:70926:20:0:107:509:114:144:Times:144:Times:unreasonable,  assumptions  about  peer  effects  among  students  yield  a  similar  
33:897:71015:0:21:108:509:673:144:Times:144:Times:optimal  system  design.  These  models  play  an  important  role  as  a  conceptual  
33:898:71102:21:21:108:507:652:144:Times:144:Times:benchmark  but  they,  like  our  own  academically  oriented  definition  of  mismatch, 
33:899:71191:21:20:108:509:631:144:Times:144:Times:miss  important  features  of  the  real  world.  As  emphasized  in  e.g.  Smith  (2008)  
33:900:71282:20:21:108:508:611:144:Times:144:Times:both students and colleges have many other dimensions besides the academic on 
33:901:71360:21:21:108:509:590:144:Times:144:Times:which  they  might  care  to  match.  Models  and  empirical  studies  that  treat  these  
33:902:71451:21:21:108:363:569:144:Times:144:Times:other dimensions seriously await future work.
