2:10:267:30:27:71:137:661:13:Helvetica:13:Helvetica:Summary. 
2:11:276:27:17:71:464:634:13:Helvetica:13:Helvetica:Borrow and spend is a policy with several weaknesses. 1, it involves 
2:12:345:17:17:71:486:617:13:Helvetica:13:Helvetica:government borrowing something, that is money, which government can 
2:13:413:17:17:71:484:600:13:Helvetica:13:Helvetica:create in limitless quantities any time. 2, the “borrow” part of borrow and 
2:14:489:17:18:71:513:583:13:Helvetica:13:Helvetica:spend is deflationary: the opposite of the desired effect. 3, borrow and spend 
2:15:568:18:17:71:487:565:13:Helvetica:13:Helvetica:may result in interest rate increases and crowding out. To get round this, 
2:16:643:17:17:71:518:548:13:Helvetica:13:Helvetica:governments print extra money and buy back government securities. This is a 
2:17:719:17:17:71:521:531:13:Helvetica:13:Helvetica:charade: governments here are engaged in “print and spend” while pretending 
2:18:795:17:18:71:494:514:13:Helvetica:13:Helvetica:to effect “borrow and spend”. 4, when borrowings are paid back, the initial 
2:19:871:18:17:71:474:496:13:Helvetica:13:Helvetica:reflationary effect is reversed, thus borrow and spend does not have a 
2:20:942:17:17:71:488:479:13:Helvetica:13:Helvetica:permanent effect, whereas print and spend does. 5, one of the ways that 
2:21:1014:17:17:71:502:462:13:Helvetica:13:Helvetica:borrow and spend works is that it supplies the private sector with additional 
2:22:1092:17:17:71:448:445:13:Helvetica:13:Helvetica:assets (bonds which pay interest). This reduces “paradox of thrift” 
2:23:1160:17:17:71:484:428:13:Helvetica:13:Helvetica:unemployment. But the private sector actually NEEDS or WANTS these 
2:24:1227:17:18:71:517:411:13:Helvetica:13:Helvetica:assets, thus there is no need to pay interest to induce the recipients to accept 
2:25:1308:18:17:71:518:393:13:Helvetica:13:Helvetica:those assets. Put another way, governments should issue zero interest bonds 
2:26:1384:17:17:71:479:376:13:Helvetica:13:Helvetica:(i.e. cash) not interest paying bonds. 6, Borrow and spend expands the 
2:27:1455:17:17:71:491:359:13:Helvetica:13:Helvetica:national debt, some of which will be held by foreigners. Paying interest to 
2:28:1531:17:17:71:496:342:13:Helvetica:13:Helvetica:foreigners when no interest needs to be paid makes even less sense than 
2:29:1603:17:28:71:253:325:13:Helvetica:13:Helvetica:paying such interest to natives. 
2:30:1636:28:17:71:523:297:13:Helvetica:13:Helvetica:For the purposes of influencing unemployment and inflation, print and spend is 
2:31:1715:17:27:71:517:280:13:Helvetica:13:Helvetica:a superior policy to adjusting interest rates because the latter is distortionary.

3:42:2137:34:24:71:493:719:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:The word government refers here to government and 
3:43:2187:24:24:71:515:695:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:central bank combined, unless otherwise stated. That is 
3:44:2243:24:23:71:517:671:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:not to suggest that independent central banks are a bad 
3:45:2299:23:34:71:120:648:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:idea.  
3:46:2306:34:24:71:513:614:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:The phrase “print money” does not refer just to physical 
3:47:2363:24:24:71:513:590:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:printing of bank notes, but to the more general concept: 
3:48:2420:24:34:71:410:566:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:creation by banks of money out of thin air. 
3:49:2464:34:23:71:470:532:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Only countries that issue their own currencies are

3:51:2568:24:24:71:456:485:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:implications for common currency areas, like the 
3:52:2617:24:34:71:401:461:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Eurozone, but these are not considered.  
3:53:2658:34:34:71:526:427:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:The words stimulus and reflation are used as synonyms.

3:56:2723:34:34:71:186:326:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Introduction. 
3:57:2737:34:34:71:76:292:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica: 
3:58:2737:34:24:71:498:258:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:One of the main points made by Keynes was that in a 
3:59:2788:24:23:71:479:234:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:recession, governments should borrow and spend. 
3:60:2836:23:24:71:503:211:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:However, it has long been known that an alternative is 
3:61:2891:24:24:71:517:187:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:for government to simply create extra money and spend 
3:62:2945:24:24:71:481:163:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:it without borrowing. Indeed, Keynes (1933) himself 
3:63:2996:24:24:71:480:139:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:made the point. To quote him: “Individuals must be 
3:64:3047:24:24:71:506:115:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:induced to spend more...... through the expenditure of 
3:65:3102:24:0:71:302:91:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:borrowed or printed money.” 
4:66:3132:0:24:71:498:753:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Unfortunately, the merits of “print and spend” seem to 
4:67:3187:24:24:71:506:729:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:have been half forgotten. As Hillinger (2010) put it, “An 
4:68:3245:24:24:71:513:705:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:aspect of the crisis discussions that has irritated me the 
4:69:3304:24:23:71:476:681:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:most is the implicit, or explicit claim that there is no 
4:70:3361:23:24:71:486:658:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:alternative to governmental borrowing to finance the 
4:71:3414:24:24:71:510:634:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:deficits incurred for stabilization purposes. It baffles me 
4:72:3474:24:24:71:511:610:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:how such nonsense can be so universally accepted. Of 
4:73:3527:24:24:71:516:586:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:course, there is a much better alternative: to finance the 
4:74:3586:24:33:71:284:562:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:deficits with fresh money.” 
4:75:3614:33:24:71:494:529:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:The purpose of this paper is first, to reiterate some of 
4:76:3671:24:24:71:512:505:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:the arguments in favour of “print and spend”.  A second 
4:77:3727:24:24:71:496:481:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:purpose is to argue that print and spend is not just an 
4:78:3783:24:24:71:462:457:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:alternative to borrow and spend, but is actually a 
4:79:3834:24:23:71:514:433:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:superior policy. A third objective is to take the argument 
4:80:3893:23:24:71:518:410:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:still further, and argue that print and spend is superior to 
4:81:3954:24:24:71:521:386:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:the main conventional method of regulating demand and 
4:82:4008:24:34:71:384:362:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:inflation, namely altering interest rates. 
4:83:4051:34:24:71:500:328:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:For the benefit of those under the illusion that inflation 
4:84:4110:24:23:71:510:304:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:necessarily results from money supply increases, there 
4:85:4165:23:24:71:505:281:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:is a section near the end of this paper dealing with this 
4:86:4223:24:24:71:468:257:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:point. Also, in advocating print and spend, it is not 
4:87:4277:24:24:71:441:233:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:suggested that governments will increase their 
4:88:4324:24:24:71:488:209:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:countries’ money supply EVERY year. Given excess 
4:89:4373:24:23:71:451:185:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:demand and inflation resulting for example from 
4:90:4421:23:24:71:496:162:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:“irrational exuberance”, governments will from time to 
4:91:4476:24:24:71:506:138:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:time need to do a “reverse print and spend”, that is run 
4:92:4533:24:34:71:366:114:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:budget surpluses and rein in money. 
4:93:4569:34:0:71:76:80:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica: 
5:94:4571:0:34:71:345:753:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:The flaws in borrow and spend. 
5:95:4602:34:34:71:76:719:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica: 
5:96:4602:34:34:71:448:685:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Six flaws in borrow and spend are now set out. 
5:97:4649:34:23:71:519:651:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:1. When government borrows, it borrows something (i.e. 
5:98:4704:23:24:71:459:628:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:money) which government can create in limitless 
5:99:4752:24:24:71:521:604:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:quantities any time. To borrow something which one can 
5:100:4807:24:24:71:496:580:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:create oneself in limitless quantities and at no cost is 
5:101:4864:24:24:71:518:556:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:pointless. It is worse than a dairy farmer buying milk in a 
5:102:4924:24:23:71:495:532:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:shop when there is a thousand litre tank of milk a few 
5:103:4979:23:24:71:523:509:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:meters from the farmer’s house. At least the dairy farmer 
5:104:5037:24:24:71:420:485:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:has the excuse that the milk in the tank cost 
5:105:5083:24:34:71:280:461:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:SOMETHING to produce. 
5:106:5105:34:24:71:512:427:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:In addition, where government borrows monetary base, 
5:107:5158:24:23:71:462:403:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:as distinct from commercial bank created money, 
5:108:5206:23:24:71:517:380:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:government borrows something which government itself 
5:109:5259:24:34:71:272:356:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:created in the first place. 
5:110:5287:34:24:71:508:322:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Wright Patman, (chair of the House of Representatives 
5:111:5341:24:24:71:519:298:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Committee on Banking and Currency (1965–75)), made 
5:112:5392:24:23:71:472:274:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:much the same point in the following way (Patman 
5:113:5441:23:34:71:127:251:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:1941). 
5:114:5448:34:24:71:509:217:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:“When our Federal Government, that has the exclusive 
5:115:5501:24:24:71:497:193:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:power to create money, creates that money and then 
5:116:5552:24:24:71:475:169:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:goes into the open market and borrows it and pays 
5:117:5602:24:24:71:523:145:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:interest for the use of its own money, it occurs to me that 
5:118:5662:24:23:71:500:121:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:that is going too far. I have never yet had anyone who 
5:119:5717:23:0:71:493:98:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:could, through the use of logic and reason, justify the 
6:120:5775:0:24:71:465:753:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Federal Government borrowing the use of its own 
6:121:5823:24:24:71:504:729:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:money... I am saying to you in all sincerity, and with all 
6:122:5882:24:24:71:519:705:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:the earnestness that I possess, it is absolutely wrong for 
6:123:5941:24:23:71:509:681:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:the Government to issue interest-bearing obligations. It 
6:124:5998:23:24:71:449:658:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:is not only wrong: it is extravagant. It is not only 
6:125:6051:24:34:71:521:634:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:extravagant, it is wasteful. It is absolutely unnecessary.” 
6:126:6111:34:24:71:512:600:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:2. A second strange aspect of borrow and spend stems 
6:127:6164:24:24:71:487:576:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:from the fact that the whole object of the exercise is 
6:128:6219:24:23:71:469:552:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:stimulus. But the borrow part of borrow and spend 
6:129:6269:23:24:71:479:529:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:involves withdrawing money from the economy, the 
6:130:6318:24:24:71:461:505:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:effect of which is deflationary: the opposite of the 
6:131:6371:24:24:71:515:481:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:desired effect (as others, e.g. Dillard, 1948, p.110, have 
6:132:6430:24:24:71:480:457:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:pointed out). In short, borrow and spend is a bit like 
6:133:6485:24:23:71:487:433:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:throwing dirt over your car before cleaning it: the dirt 
6:134:6542:23:24:71:477:410:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:probably does not a huge amount of harm. It is just 
6:135:6593:24:34:71:152:386:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:pointless. 
6:136:6604:34:24:71:507:352:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:3. Another questionable aspect of borrow and spend is 
6:137:6658:24:24:71:489:328:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:that additional borrowing will at least on the face of it 
6:138:6716:24:23:71:508:304:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:raise interest rates, which will tend to crowd out private 
6:139:6775:23:24:71:521:281:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:sector borrowing and spending. There is of course some 
6:140:6830:24:24:71:471:257:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:argument as to the extent of this crowding out, but 
6:141:6881:24:24:71:473:233:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:certainly the risk is there. And that crowding out is 
6:142:6935:24:24:71:520:209:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:exactly what is not needed in a recession. To counteract 
6:143:6992:24:23:71:485:185:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:this undesirable effect, governments make sure that 
6:144:7043:23:24:71:490:162:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:interest rates do NOT rise, by buying up government 
6:145:7094:24:24:71:512:138:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:securities. Indeed, most governments in a recession go 
6:146:7149:24:0:71:447:114:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:even further and actually reduce interest rates. 
7:147:7200:0:24:71:512:753:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Now when government, 1, borrows, 2, issues securities 
7:148:7254:24:24:71:512:729:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:and, 3, prints money with which to buy those securities, 
7:149:7311:24:24:71:482:705:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:it is in effect engaged in print and spend rather than 
7:150:7366:24:23:71:484:681:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:borrow and spend. This is a charade. That is, when 
7:151:7417:23:24:71:516:658:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:governments claim to be engaged in borrow and spend, 
7:152:7470:24:24:71:493:634:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:they are actually engaged, at least to some extent, in 
7:153:7525:24:24:71:507:610:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:print and spend.  And in this scenario, it is legitimate to 
7:154:7585:24:24:71:498:586:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:ask what really has the reflationary effect: borrow and 
7:155:7641:24:33:71:285:562:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:spend or print and spend? 
7:156:7667:33:24:71:517:529:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Moreover, since the two polices both have a reflationary 
7:157:7724:24:24:71:506:505:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:effect, one has to wonder what the point of borrow and 
7:158:7779:24:24:71:510:481:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:spend is. That is, is borrow and spend much more than 
7:159:7833:24:34:71:200:457:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:a paper chase? 
7:160:7848:34:23:71:488:423:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Incidentally, it is not suggested here that borrow and 
7:161:7903:23:24:71:506:400:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:spend has the same effect dollar for dollar as print and 
7:162:7960:24:24:71:496:376:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:spend.  The latter is doubtless a more potent weapon 
7:163:8013:24:24:71:488:352:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:than the former, thus for a given stimulatory effect, a 
7:164:8069:24:24:71:506:328:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:smaller dosage print and spend is needed than borrow 
7:165:8122:24:33:71:170:304:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:and spend.  
7:166:8134:33:24:71:513:271:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:4. Another nonsense behind borrow and spend is that if 
7:167:8189:24:24:71:450:247:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:borrow and spend has a stimulatory effect, then 
7:168:8237:24:24:71:505:223:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:presumably the opposite of borrow and spend, namely 
7:169:8288:24:24:71:513:199:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:collecting extra tax and repaying the debt, has an equal 
7:170:8345:24:24:71:480:175:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:and opposite effect. There is thus no PERMANENT 
7:171:8393:24:23:71:455:151:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:effect. That permanent effect may or may not be 
7:172:8441:23:24:71:491:128:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:needed. That is, the advocates of borrow and spend 
7:173:8492:24:24:71:471:104:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:sometimes claim that borrow and spend just has a 
7:174:8541:24:0:71:491:80:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:“pump priming” effect, and that is all that is needed.  
8:175:8599:0:24:71:482:753:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:However, if something more than a pump priming is 
8:176:8649:24:24:71:478:729:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:needed, that is, if a PERMANENT effect is needed, 
8:177:8699:24:24:71:504:705:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:borrow and spend will not produce it, without as a side 
8:178:8755:24:33:71:526:681:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:effect, producing a permanently expanded national debt. 
8:179:8811:33:24:71:500:648:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:In contrast, print and spend DOES have a permanent 
8:180:8862:24:24:71:509:624:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:stimulatory effect: the private sector has a permanently 
8:181:8919:24:24:71:488:600:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:increased stock of money, which induces that sector 
8:182:8970:24:34:71:399:576:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:raise its spending on a permanent basis. 
8:183:9011:34:23:71:459:542:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:5. There is a sense in which all demand deficient 
8:184:9061:23:24:71:523:519:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:unemployment is paradox of thrift unemployment. This is 
8:185:9117:24:24:71:508:495:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:not to say that the initial cause of every recession is an 
8:186:9176:24:24:71:471:471:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:increased desire by the private sector to save. But 
8:187:9227:24:24:71:472:447:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:certainly the desire to save played a big role in the 
8:188:9281:24:23:71:513:423:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:1930s recession and in the current recession. That is in 
8:189:9338:23:24:71:446:400:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:both cases, private sector balance sheets were 
8:190:9385:24:24:71:484:376:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:damaged, which entirely predictably caused private 
8:191:9436:24:24:71:508:352:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:sector entities to try to make good their balance sheets 
8:192:9493:24:34:71:203:328:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:by saving more. 
8:193:9509:34:23:71:498:294:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Moreover, even if increased private sector saving has 
8:194:9563:23:24:71:523:271:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:nothing to do with a recession, the way out of recessions 
8:195:9621:24:24:71:498:247:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:is to have both public and private sectors spend more 
8:196:9675:24:24:71:485:223:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:(assuming the aim is to have the proportion of GDP 
8:197:9726:24:24:71:505:199:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:consumed by each sector to remain roughly constant). 
8:198:9779:24:24:71:497:175:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:As to the public sector, it is not difficult to arrange this 
8:199:9840:24:23:71:472:151:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:extra spending: just have government create more 
8:200:9889:23:0:71:238:128:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:money and spend it. 
9:201:9911:0:24:71:476:753:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:The private sector is different, in that private sector 
9:202:9967:24:24:71:493:729:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:entities cannot be ordered to spend a specific sum of 
9:203:10021:24:24:71:480:705:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:money in a given period of time. Thus governments 
9:204:10071:24:23:71:504:681:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:resort to numerous ways to inducing the private sector 
9:205:10126:23:24:71:513:658:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:to spend: “cash for clunkers” or government backing for 
9:206:10182:24:34:71:345:634:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:mortgages are just two examples. 
9:207:10215:34:24:71:492:600:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:But a weakness in any measure targeted on specific 
9:208:10266:24:24:71:473:576:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:products (as in the above two examples - cars and 
9:209:10316:24:23:71:487:552:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:houses) is that they are market distorting. However, 
9:210:10369:23:24:71:511:529:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:market distorting measures are unjustified unless it can 
9:211:10426:24:24:71:518:505:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:be shown that the market itself is distorted in some way, 
9:212:10484:24:24:71:459:481:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:which would justify a countervailing distortionary 
9:213:10535:24:24:71:516:457:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:measure (or perhaps “anti-distortionary measure” would 
9:214:10590:24:23:71:521:433:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:be a better phrase). And it is unusual for governments to 
9:215:10648:23:24:71:453:410:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:consider (never mind demonstrate) what market 
9:216:10694:24:24:71:514:386:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:distortions might need rectifying before introducing their 
9:217:10753:24:24:71:505:362:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:own weird selection of distortionary measures. That is, 
9:218:10809:24:24:71:522:338:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:much the most common reason for implementing market 
9:219:10860:24:23:71:496:314:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:distorting measures is that they have populist appeal: 
9:220:10915:23:34:71:195:291:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:they win votes. 
9:221:10931:34:24:71:509:257:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:For example “Cash for clunkers” is a simple idea which 
9:222:10986:24:24:71:500:233:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:every voter understands. And government backing for 
9:223:11037:24:24:71:502:209:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:mortgages is bound to win votes. If the latter results in 
9:224:11095:24:23:71:480:185:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:ridiculous “no income no job” mortgages and credit 
9:225:11146:23:24:71:460:162:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:crunches many years later which do catastrophic 
9:226:11194:24:24:71:520:138:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:economic damage, that will not worry the politicians who 
9:227:11251:24:0:71:265:114:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:introduce the measure.  
10:228:11277:0:24:71:497:753:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:At any rate, should some unusually wise government 
10:229:11328:24:24:71:485:729:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:want to induce the private sector to spend more in a 
10:230:11381:24:24:71:489:705:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:non-distorting way, about the only way of doing so is 
10:231:11435:24:23:71:518:681:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:simply to boost private sector incomes and/or feed extra 
10:232:11492:23:24:71:482:658:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:assets to private sector pockets. This ought to raise 
10:233:11546:24:24:71:504:634:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:private sector spending for two reasons. First, a rise in 
10:234:11604:24:24:71:516:610:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:household incomes induces households to spend more. 
10:235:11655:24:24:71:516:586:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Second, household assets expand, which has the same 
10:236:11706:24:33:71:125:562:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:effect. 
10:237:11714:33:24:71:516:529:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Now for the question as to what form these extra assets 
10:238:11770:24:24:71:465:505:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:should take. In the case of borrow and spend, the 
10:239:11820:24:24:71:519:481:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:private sector is supplied with extra assets in the form of 
10:240:11880:24:24:71:523:457:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:government bonds, which pay interest. In contrast, in the 
10:241:11938:24:23:71:497:433:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:case of print and spend, the private sector is supplied 
10:242:11994:23:24:71:528:410:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:with additional assets which pay no interest, that is cash. 
10:243:12054:24:34:71:337:386:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Which of these two is the better? 
10:244:12088:34:24:71:495:352:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Well, there is no need to pay interest on those assets 
10:245:12143:24:24:71:511:328:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:because the private sector actually WANTS or NEEDS 
10:246:12194:24:23:71:512:304:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:those assets if it is to be induced to spend at a rate that 
10:247:12254:23:34:71:266:281:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:brings full employment!  
10:248:12279:34:24:71:504:247:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Conclusion: borrow and spend involves government in 
10:249:12330:24:24:71:521:223:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:paying interest, when there is no need to. To that extent, 
10:250:12389:24:34:71:340:199:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:print and spend is a better policy. 
10:251:12425:34:23:71:468:165:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Having concluded that borrow and spend involves 
10:252:12473:23:24:71:518:142:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:paying unnecessary interest, this is NOT to suggest that 
10:253:12530:24:24:71:503:118:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:governments should NEVER pay interest on borrowed 
10:254:12580:24:0:71:124:94:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:sums. 
11:255:12589:0:24:71:470:753:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:The above point regarding unnecessary interest is 
11:256:12639:24:24:71:493:729:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:applicable to where government borrows for stimulus 
11:257:12690:24:24:71:491:705:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:purposes. It is NOT applicable to where government 
11:258:12741:24:33:71:360:681:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:borrows as a substitute for taxation. 
11:259:12779:33:24:71:491:648:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:To illustrate, if an economy is at full employment, the 
11:260:12835:24:24:71:510:624:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:private sector will almost by definition have the stock of 
11:261:12894:24:24:71:523:600:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:assets which induces it to spend at the “full employment” 
11:262:12952:24:24:71:495:576:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:rate. And in this scenario, if the private sector is to be 
11:263:13011:24:23:71:482:552:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:induced to abstain from consumption so as to make 
11:264:13061:23:24:71:516:529:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:room for extra public sector spending, the private sector 
11:265:13119:24:24:71:469:505:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:has to be induced or forced to engage in the latter 
11:266:13170:24:34:71:168:481:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:abstinence. 
11:267:13182:34:24:71:447:447:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Tax is the “force” option, and paying interest on 
11:268:13232:24:23:71:509:423:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:borrowed money is the “induce” option. And there is no 
11:269:13287:23:24:71:518:400:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:avoiding the need for a financial inducement in the latter 
11:270:13346:24:24:71:491:376:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:case: that is, there is no way of escaping the need to 
11:271:13401:24:34:71:174:352:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:pay interest. 
11:272:13415:34:24:71:523:318:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:But to repeat, where stimulus is the objective, there is no 
11:273:13475:24:23:71:493:294:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:need whatever to pay interest! To that extent, borrow 
11:274:13529:23:34:71:491:271:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:and spend with a view to stimulus is a flawed policy. 
11:275:13583:34:24:71:504:237:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:6. The final undesirable aspect of borrow and spend is 
11:276:13638:24:24:71:478:213:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:that it expands the national debt, and the larger the 
11:277:13692:24:24:71:521:189:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:national debt, the more of such debt is likely to end up in 
11:278:13752:24:23:71:492:165:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:the hands for foreign entities. Borrowing from abroad 
11:279:13806:23:24:71:515:142:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:CAN make sense. But paying interest to foreign lenders 
11:280:13861:24:0:71:487:118:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:when (as pointed out above) no interest needs to be 
12:281:13915:0:24:71:520:753:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:paid, is even more pointless than paying such interest to 
12:282:13973:24:34:71:138:729:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:natives. 
12:283:13982:34:34:71:76:695:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica: 
12:284:13982:34:23:71:420:661:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Should interest rates be used to regulate 
12:285:14024:23:34:71:181:638:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:economies? 
12:286:14035:34:34:71:76:604:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica: 
12:287:14035:34:24:71:453:570:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:A possible objection to the above anti borrowing 
12:288:14084:24:24:71:516:546:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:arguments is that it implies an abolition or near abolition 
12:289:14144:24:23:71:512:522:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:of government borrowing, which in turn might appear to 
12:290:14199:23:24:71:513:499:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:make it difficult for governments to adjust interest rates, 
12:291:14259:24:24:71:472:475:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:because governments effect these adjustments by 
12:292:14307:24:34:71:358:451:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:buying or selling government stock. 
12:293:14343:34:24:71:515:417:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:To be more accurate, the fact of not engaging in borrow 
12:294:14399:24:23:71:470:393:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:and spend for stimulus purposes does not rule out 
12:295:14449:23:24:71:520:370:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:borrowing as an alternative to tax. But the arguments for 
12:296:14507:24:24:71:471:346:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:the latter are about as feeble as the arguments for 
12:297:14558:24:24:71:508:322:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:borrowing for stimulus purposes (see Musgrave (2010) 
12:298:14611:24:24:71:500:298:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:and Kellerman (2006). Thus there is a good argument 
12:299:14662:24:23:71:485:274:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:for abolishing or reducing ALL forms of government 
12:300:14713:23:34:71:160:251:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:borrowing. 
12:301:14724:34:24:71:508:217:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:So would a reduced supply of government stock make 
12:302:14775:24:24:71:511:193:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:interest rate adjustments more difficult, and if so, would 
12:303:14834:24:24:71:501:169:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:this matter? There are various reasons, as follows, for 
12:304:14890:24:33:71:424:145:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:think that the answer is a “double negative”. 
12:305:14936:33:24:71:429:112:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:First, using interest rates to adjust demand is 
12:306:14984:24:0:71:482:88:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:distortionary, since it works only via entities that are 
13:307:15044:0:24:71:505:753:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:significantly reliant on variable rate loans. It is true that 
13:308:15106:24:24:71:450:729:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:changes in the level of activity by these entities 
13:309:15157:24:24:71:513:705:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:ultimately affects or “trickles down to” other entities. For 
13:310:15218:24:23:71:518:681:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:example, given an interest rate cut, additional activity by 
13:311:15278:23:24:71:493:658:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:the former entities will ultimately trickle down to other 
13:312:15336:24:34:71:301:634:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:entities. But that is not ideal. 
13:313:15369:34:24:71:446:600:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:In particular, by the time the trickle down is half 
13:314:15420:24:24:71:514:576:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:complete, it is possible the economy is suffering excess 
13:315:15477:24:23:71:482:552:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:demand and inflation, and stimulus from any further 
13:316:15528:23:34:71:436:529:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:“trickle down” is exactly what is NOT needed. 
13:317:15574:34:24:71:502:495:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Incidentally, having criticised interest rate adjustments 
13:318:15632:24:24:71:459:471:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:for their undesirable delayed effects, it should be 
13:319:15683:24:24:71:505:447:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:admitted that print and spend has undesirable delayed 
13:320:15737:24:23:71:516:423:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:effects which could be equally bad. That is, a proportion 
13:321:15795:23:24:71:494:400:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:of any additional cash fed to the private sector will be 
13:322:15852:24:24:71:463:376:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:saved, and may be spent exactly when additional 
13:323:15900:24:34:71:472:352:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:spending is not desirable: in an inflationary boom. 
13:324:15951:34:24:71:513:318:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:In contrast to the DELAYED effects of different policies, 
13:325:16009:24:23:71:504:294:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:and getting back to the INITIAL effects, it is relevant to 
13:326:16068:23:24:71:515:271:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:ask whether print and spend would be less distortionary 
13:327:16124:24:24:71:489:247:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:than interest rate changes. The answer is that with a 
13:328:16178:24:24:71:523:223:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:little ingenuity, the INITIAL effects of print and spend can 
13:329:16239:24:34:71:278:199:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:be almost distortion free.  
13:330:16267:34:23:71:489:165:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:For example, a payroll tax cut would benefit EVERY 
13:331:16318:23:24:71:500:142:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:employer and employee in the country. That is quite a 
13:332:16372:24:24:71:477:118:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:big chunk of the economy! Admittedly a payroll tax 
13:333:16423:24:0:71:513:94:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:change leaves out pensioners, those on social security, 
14:334:16482:0:24:71:457:753:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:and perhaps some other groups.  But with a little 
14:335:16532:24:34:71:426:729:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:ingenuity these groups could be catered for. 
14:336:16577:34:24:71:461:695:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:A second reason for thinking a reduced supply of 
14:337:16626:24:23:71:510:671:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:government stock would not matter stems from the fact 
14:338:16680:23:24:71:517:648:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:that there must be some optimum amount of investment 
14:339:16733:24:24:71:517:624:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:in any economy per dollar of GDP. And for a given state 
14:340:16789:24:24:71:485:600:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:of technological development and so on, a plausible 
14:341:16840:24:24:71:498:576:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:assumption is that this “investment per dollar of GDP” 
14:342:16895:24:33:71:437:552:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:will not change given a small change in GDP. 
14:343:16940:33:24:71:467:519:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Now the purpose of an interest rate reduction, for 
14:344:16991:24:24:71:519:495:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:example, is to expand the economy a small amount. But 
14:345:17045:24:24:71:468:471:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:the rate reduction will also increase the amount of 
14:346:17096:24:34:71:433:447:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:investment per dollar of GDP: totally illogical! 
14:347:17145:34:23:71:507:413:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:In fact, interest rate changes are arguably even MORE 
14:348:17199:23:24:71:519:390:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:illogical that the above two paragraphs suggest. Reason 
14:349:17255:24:24:71:514:366:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:is that given excess unemployment, if there is to be any 
14:350:17312:24:24:71:491:342:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:change in the amount of investment per head (or per 
14:351:17363:24:24:71:521:318:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:dollar of GDP), there should arguably be a REDUCTION 
14:352:17416:24:23:71:514:294:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:in the amount of investment per head. Put another way, 
14:353:17471:23:24:71:506:271:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:given excess unemployment, there is arguably merit in 
14:354:17525:24:24:71:509:247:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:encouraging employers, at least temporarily, to employ 
14:355:17580:24:34:71:446:223:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:MORE people for given investment, not LESS! 
14:356:17624:34:24:71:523:189:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Third, there is an obvious and serious distortion resulting 
14:357:17684:24:23:71:505:165:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:from low interest rates: asset price bubbles. And in the 
14:358:17741:23:24:71:449:142:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:case of housing, there is the already mentioned 
14:359:17789:24:24:71:512:118:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:catastrophic economic damage that can be done when 
14:360:17840:24:0:71:238:94:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:these bubbles burst. 
15:361:17864:0:24:71:480:753:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:A fourth reason for thinking a reduced number of or 
15:362:17915:24:24:71:495:729:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:volume of government bonds would not matter is that 
15:363:17966:24:24:71:497:705:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:the fact of not borrowing for stimulus or “substitute for 
15:364:18024:24:23:71:520:681:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:tax” purposes does not rule out borrowing specifically so 
15:365:18082:23:24:71:499:658:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:as to influence interest rates. (As pointed out by Abba 
15:366:18138:24:24:71:457:634:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Lerner). Indeed, where a government wanted for 
15:367:18185:24:24:71:473:610:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:example to damp down demand by raising interest 
15:368:18233:24:24:71:514:586:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:rates, the effect would come not just from the increased 
15:369:18290:24:23:71:521:562:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:rates. Such a government would announce a willingness 
15:370:18344:23:24:71:507:539:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:to borrow at a higher rate than the prevailing rate. That 
15:371:18402:24:24:71:504:515:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:in turn would withdraw funds from the economy, which 
15:372:18455:24:24:71:492:491:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:(as pointed out under the second objection to borrow 
15:373:18508:24:24:71:514:467:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:and spend above) is deflationary. At least that would be 
15:374:18565:24:33:71:514:443:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:the effect, assuming the money borrowed is not spent.  
15:375:18620:33:24:71:513:410:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Fifth and finally, “zero government borrowing” monetary 
15:376:18676:24:24:71:520:386:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:system was set out by Friedman (1948), which suggests 
15:377:18730:24:24:71:441:362:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:that an absence of, or much reduced supply of 
15:378:18776:24:34:71:459:338:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:government securities would not be a problem.   
15:379:18824:34:23:71:508:304:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:The conclusion is that a reduced supply of government 
15:380:18878:23:24:71:509:281:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:securities resulting from a print and spend policy would 
15:381:18935:24:24:71:520:257:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:not make it significantly more difficult for governments to 
15:382:18995:24:24:71:472:233:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:raise interest rates. And even if it did make it more 
15:383:19049:24:24:71:522:209:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:difficult, that would not matter in that print and spend is a 
15:384:19111:24:34:71:419:185:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:superior policy to interest rate adjustments. 
15:385:19157:34:35:71:75:151:18:g_d0_f6:18:g_d0_f6: 
15:386:19157:35:33:71:76:116:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica: 
15:387:19157:33:0:71:76:83:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica: 
16:388:19160:0:34:71:252:753:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:A counter argument. 
16:389:19180:34:24:71:497:719:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:It could be argued that the costs of borrow and spend 
16:390:19234:24:24:71:458:695:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:are not all that great, in that while this policy IS a 
16:391:19289:24:23:71:507:671:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:pointless paper chase, the costs of paper pushing as a 
16:392:19344:23:24:71:509:648:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:proportion of GDP are small. (Not a strong argument in 
16:393:19399:24:24:71:495:624:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:view of the astronomic costs of the average country’s 
16:394:19453:24:34:71:315:600:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:bureaucracy, but never mind!) 
16:395:19483:34:24:71:509:566:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:However, against that, there is a real and more serious 
16:396:19539:24:23:71:515:542:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:problem as follows. An ever expanding national debt, or 
16:397:19595:23:24:71:490:519:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:a national debt that expands relatively fast, causes a 
16:398:19650:24:24:71:507:495:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:significant number of influential people to campaign for 
16:399:19707:24:24:71:520:471:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:cuts in government spending (or tax increases). The two 
16:400:19763:24:24:71:498:447:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:latter DO HAVE serious economic consequences: the 
16:401:19813:24:23:71:503:423:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:result is a decline in demand in real terms, and means 
16:402:19868:23:24:71:478:400:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:unnecessary unemployment. And this is a very real 
16:403:19918:24:34:71:401:376:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:problem in the U.S. at the time of writing. 
16:404:19962:34:24:71:434:342:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Another possible counter argument is that the 
16:405:20008:24:24:71:497:318:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:requirement for government to borrow from its central 
16:406:20062:24:23:71:487:294:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:bank prevents politicians having direct access to the 
16:407:20116:23:24:71:523:271:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:money printing press. (Government and central bank are 
16:408:20171:24:24:71:491:247:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:treated as separate entities here, as distinct from the 
16:409:20227:24:24:71:514:223:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:usage adopted elsewhere in this paper, namely treating 
16:410:20282:24:34:71:296:199:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:the two as the same entity). 
16:411:20311:34:23:71:488:165:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:The effects of government borrowing from its central 
16:412:20364:23:24:71:494:142:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:bank are very different from where the two treated as 
16:413:20418:24:24:71:491:118:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:one unit borrow from the rest of the economy. At any 
16:414:20471:24:0:71:478:94:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:rate, is there even much to be said for government 
17:415:20525:0:24:71:473:753:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:borrowing from its own central bank with a view to 
17:416:20576:24:34:71:385:729:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:keeping a distinction between the two? 
17:417:20615:34:24:71:492:695:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:The answer is “no” because it would be quite easy to 
17:418:20668:24:23:71:470:671:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:frame a set of rules suitable for a “zero borrowing” 
17:419:20721:23:24:71:491:648:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:economy where was nevertheless a clear distinction 
17:420:20772:24:24:71:518:624:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:between government and central bank. For example the 
17:421:20825:24:24:71:451:600:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:rule could be that government must work on the 
17:422:20872:24:24:71:513:576:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:assumption that its spending shall equal what it collects 
17:423:20930:24:23:71:516:552:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:in tax. While the central bank is responsible for inflation 
17:424:20990:23:24:71:471:529:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:(as most central banks currently are), and controls 
17:425:21041:24:24:71:518:505:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:inflation by allowing government additional funds where, 
17:426:21098:24:24:71:516:481:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:for example, unemployment is excessive and inflation is 
17:427:21154:24:34:71:155:457:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:subdued.  
17:428:21164:34:33:71:76:423:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica: 
17:429:21164:33:34:71:527:390:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Printing money does not necessarily cause inflation. 
17:430:21217:34:24:71:508:356:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Having argued the case for print and spend, objections 
17:431:21272:24:24:71:441:332:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:may be raised to the effect that printing money 
17:432:21320:24:24:71:513:308:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:necessarily means inflation. Readers who have a grasp 
17:433:21374:24:23:71:463:284:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:of when money printing does and does not cause 
17:434:21421:23:34:71:403:261:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:inflation can stop reading this paper now. 
17:435:21464:34:24:71:448:227:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Printing money does NOT cause inflation to the 
17:436:21511:24:34:71:205:203:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:following extent. 
17:437:21529:34:24:71:499:169:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:1. As economies expand, all other things being equal, 
17:438:21583:24:24:71:500:145:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:they require an expanded money supply. To illustrate, 
17:439:21637:24:23:71:523:121:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:the money supply of the U.S. is (amazingly) much bigger 
17:440:21693:23:0:71:367:98:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:than that of Liechenstein or Andorra. 
18:441:21734:0:24:71:519:753:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:2. An expanded money supply is NOT inflationary until it 
18:442:21791:24:24:71:517:729:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:is actually spent (as pointed out by Hume (1752) and by 
18:443:21847:24:24:71:504:705:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Keynes (1933) and numerous others.) For example if I 
18:444:21900:24:23:71:503:681:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:print a million tons of £50 notes and hide them down a 
18:445:21955:23:24:71:513:658:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:disused coal mine and don’t tell anyone what I’ve done, 
18:446:22011:24:34:71:364:634:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:the effect on inflation would be zero. 
18:447:22050:34:24:71:505:600:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:And the latter is an illustration which is very relevant to 
18:448:22110:24:24:71:509:576:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:the basic argument in this paper. That is, it was argued 
18:449:22167:24:23:71:483:552:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:above that where the private sector is trying to save 
18:450:22221:23:24:71:510:529:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:extra cash, government needs to print extra cash so as 
18:451:22276:24:24:71:493:505:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:to supply the savings that the private sector requires. 
18:452:22332:24:24:71:520:481:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:That extra cash will not have a big effect until the private 
18:453:22393:24:24:71:511:457:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:sector finds it has TOO MUCH cash. Whereupon there 
18:454:22444:24:23:71:517:433:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:WILL be an effect on demand, and possibly an effect on 
18:455:22499:23:34:71:143:410:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:inflation. 
18:456:22510:34:24:71:523:376:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:It is of course possible that the private sector will react to 
18:457:22573:24:24:71:484:352:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:an increased money supply by ASSUMING that any 
18:458:22620:24:24:71:520:328:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:money supply increase will cause inflation, and factoring 
18:459:22678:24:23:71:520:304:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:in this inflation into wage agreements, prices of products 
18:460:22737:23:24:71:515:281:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:and so on. However this is totally unrealistic. That is the 
18:461:22797:24:24:71:496:257:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:idea that the average household keeps an eye on the 
18:462:22848:24:34:71:331:233:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:monetary aggregates is fanciful. 
18:463:22881:34:24:71:512:199:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:The above is typical of the sort of totally unrealistic idea 
18:464:22942:24:24:71:466:175:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:proposed by academic economists with a view to 
18:465:22989:24:23:71:450:151:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:keeping themselves employed at the taxpayers’ 
18:466:23035:23:0:71:149:128:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:expense. 
19:467:23047:0:24:71:504:753:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Plus the evidence does not support the latter idea. For 
19:468:23103:24:24:71:466:729:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:example the U.S. monetary base expanded by an 
19:469:23149:24:24:71:489:705:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:astronomic and unprecedented amount in 2009. The 
19:470:23198:24:23:71:437:681:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:economically unsophisticated were screaming 
19:471:23242:23:24:71:507:658:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:“Mugabwe” and “Weimar” as a result. The actual effect 
19:472:23296:24:24:71:512:634:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:of that base increase eighteen months later (at the time 
19:473:23353:24:24:71:487:610:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:of writing) is approximately zero. And as regards the 
19:474:23407:24:24:71:521:586:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:future, yields on U.S. long term government stock, at the 
19:475:23465:24:23:71:510:562:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:time of writing, are at record lows, thus the markets are 
19:476:23523:23:34:71:454:539:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:not factoring in rampant inflation any time soon. 
19:477:23573:34:24:71:464:505:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:3. A significant amount of money printing is made 
19:478:23623:24:24:71:503:481:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:necessary simply as a result of the widely agreed idea 
19:479:23678:24:24:71:497:457:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:that inflation of around 2% is optimum (as opposed to 
19:480:23732:24:33:71:510:433:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:4%, minus 2%, or any other figure). Reasons are thus. 
19:481:23786:33:24:71:521:400:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:First, inflation of 2% reduces the real value of the money 
19:482:23845:24:24:71:512:376:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:supply by 2% a year. That depreciation requires money 
19:483:23899:24:24:71:495:352:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:printing simply to keep the value of the money supply 
19:484:23953:24:24:71:471:328:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:constant in real terms (never mind, as pointed out 
19:485:24004:24:23:71:479:304:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:above, the money printing required to keep the real 
19:486:24055:23:24:71:504:281:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:value of the money supply expanding at the same rate 
19:487:24108:24:34:71:214:257:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:as the economy). 
19:488:24125:34:24:71:496:223:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Second, assuming a country has a national debt, and 
19:489:24176:24:24:71:501:199:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:that that debt is to remain more or less constant in the 
19:490:24233:24:24:71:521:175:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:long term as a proportion of GDP, further money printing 
19:491:24290:24:23:71:517:151:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:is required to keep that proportion constant. Put another 
19:492:24348:23:24:71:511:128:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:way, that “real term” proportion will not remain constant 
19:493:24406:24:0:71:520:104:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:if the national debt is not expanded in nominal or “dollar” 
20:494:24469:0:24:71:505:753:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:terms. And that in turn requires and expanded stock of 
20:495:24524:24:34:71:328:729:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:dollars (in the case of the U.S.). 
20:496:24559:34:24:71:481:695:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:All in all, a fair amount of money printing is required 
20:497:24615:24:33:71:344:671:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:simply to “keep things constant”.   
20:498:24651:33:24:71:474:638:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:The net result is that most years there will be a net 
20:499:24705:24:24:71:480:614:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:expansion in the money supply. It is only during the 
20:500:24758:24:24:71:502:590:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:occasional burst of excess demand (perhaps resulting 
20:501:24811:24:24:71:510:566:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:from “irrational exuberance”) that government will run a 
20:502:24868:24:23:71:442:542:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:surplus, i.e. need to rein in money and actually 
20:503:24917:23:34:71:308:519:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:REDUCE the money supply.  
20:504:24943:34:24:71:468:485:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:4. Governments up to about ten years ago tried to 
20:505:24993:24:24:71:518:461:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:control inflation by controlling the money supply. It didn’t 
20:506:25054:24:24:71:498:437:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:work because (with the exception of lunatic Mugabwe 
20:507:25105:24:23:71:513:413:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:type money supply increases) there is little relationship 
20:508:25163:23:24:71:501:390:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:between money supply changes and inflation. At least 
20:509:25216:24:24:71:516:366:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:the relationship is too feeble to make the above inflation 
20:510:25275:24:34:71:272:342:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:control tool a useful one. 
20:511:25302:34:24:71:460:308:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:5. In the particular case of quantitative easing (of 
20:512:25355:24:23:71:489:284:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:government stock), this is often classified as “money 
20:513:25409:23:24:71:499:261:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:printing”. And certainly the monetary base rises by $X 
20:514:25464:24:24:71:515:237:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:for every $X of government stock QEd. But QE consists 
20:515:25518:24:24:71:508:213:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:essentially of giving holders of one form of government 
20:516:25574:24:24:71:478:189:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:liability (bonds) another form of government liability 
20:517:25629:24:23:71:511:165:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:(cash). To put it in another and figurative way, one type 
20:518:25687:23:24:71:500:142:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:of valuable bit of paper is swapped for another type of 
20:519:25743:24:24:71:507:118:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:valuable bit of paper. Apart from boosting asset prices, 
20:520:25800:24:0:71:505:94:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:and possibly causing asset price bubbles, there is little 
21:521:25861:0:24:71:449:753:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:reason to suppose this will have much effect on 
21:522:25909:24:34:71:428:729:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:anything: demand, inflation or anything else. 
21:523:25955:34:24:71:473:695:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:Conclusion: the idea that a money supply increase 
21:524:26005:24:23:71:514:671:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:automatically causes inflation is grossly over simple. To 
21:525:26063:23:24:71:504:648:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:gauge the inflationary effects, it is necessary to look at 
21:526:26122:24:24:71:489:624:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:several factors. Three of those factors are as follows 
21:527:26177:24:24:71:496:600:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:(but there are doubtless several more). 1, the state of 
21:528:26233:24:24:71:472:576:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:the economy. That is, is the economy in a state of 
21:529:26284:24:23:71:484:552:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:excess unemployment and subdued inflation or is it 
21:530:26335:23:24:71:518:529:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:suffering labour shortages and excess demand? 2, Who 
21:531:26388:24:24:71:510:505:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:are the recipients of the additional money: people likely 
21:532:26446:24:24:71:523:481:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:to spend it, or people likely to save it. 3, Does the money 
21:533:26506:24:24:71:522:457:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:supply increase result (as in the case of QE) simply from 
21:534:26564:24:33:71:463:433:18:Helvetica:18:Helvetica:swapping one asset (bonds) for another (cash)?
