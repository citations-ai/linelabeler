2:30:1435:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:This paper examines the impact of the financial crisis of 2008 on the federal funds market, specifically
2:31:1539:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. Rather than a complete collapse of lending in the presence of
2:32:1635:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:a market wide shock, we see that banks become more restrictive in which counterparties they lend
2:33:1731:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:to. After Lehman Brothers, we find that amounts and spreads become more sensitive to borrower bank
2:34:1829:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:characteristics. While the market does not contract dramatically, lending rates increase. Further, the
2:35:1931:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:market does not seem to expand to meet the increased demand predicted by the drop in other bank
2:36:2026:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:funding markets. We examine discount window borrowing as a proxy for unmet fed funds demand
2:37:2117:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:and find that the fed funds market is not indiscriminate. As expected, borrowers who access the discount
2:38:2221:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:window have lower ROA. When looking at the lender side we do not find that the characteristics of
2:39:2318:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:the lending bank importantly affect the amount of interbank loans a bank makes. In particular, we
2:40:2415:14:42:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:do not find that worse performing banks start hoarding liquidity and indiscriminately reduce their lending.

3:58:2863:0:27:64:158:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:I. Introduction 
3:59:2878:27:28:72:545:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The  interbank  market  is  the  most  immediate  source  of  bank  liquidity  and  thus  an  important  
3:60:2983:28:27:72:546:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:indicator  of  the  functioning  of  the  banking  market  overall.  Problems  in  the  efficiency  of  
3:61:3087:27:28:71:544:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:interbank  markets  can  lead  to  insufficient  bank  liquidity  and  thus  to  inadequate  allocation  of  
3:62:3196:28:28:71:542:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:capital and risk sharing between banks. At the extreme, a failure in interbank markets could even 
3:63:3294:28:27:71:543:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:trigger bank runs. In addition, the overnight interbank market, known as the fed funds market in 
3:64:3391:27:28:71:543:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the US, is one of the main mechanisms by which  monetary  policy  is  implemented,  and  thus  an  
3:65:3490:28:27:71:544:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:important  market,  especially  when  the  market  rate  can  differ  from  the  target.  It  is  therefore  of  
3:66:3603:27:28:71:543:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:particular  interest  to  understand  whether  the  interbank  market  mitigates  or  amplifies  shocks  to  
3:67:3712:28:38:71:298:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:individual banks or the banking sector overall. 
3:68:3760:38:27:71:545:422:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:In  this  paper  we  study  how  the  Lehman  Brothers’  bankruptcy  and  the  ensuing  government  
3:69:3860:27:28:71:543:395:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:interventions affected the functioning of the overnight fed funds market. Apart from contributing 
3:70:3958:28:27:71:543:367:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:to a better understanding of the 2008 financial crisis, this period serves as a useful experiment to 
3:71:4059:27:28:71:544:340:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:observe  how  the  fed  fund  market  reacts  to  market  wide  shocks  to  the  stability  of  the  banking  
3:72:4169:28:28:71:545:312:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:industry.  While  the  direct  losses  of  large  banks  from  the  Lehman’s  bankruptcy  were  not  big  
3:73:4275:28:27:71:545:284:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:enough  to  trigger  a  bankruptcy,  large  banks’  access  to  fed  funds  loans  is  the  most  affected.  
3:74:4384:27:28:71:543:257:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Unlike the Bear Stearns’ failure, which did not result in meaningful disruptions in the interbank 
3:75:4482:28:27:71:544:229:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:market,  we  see  significant  changes  in  spreads  and  access  to  credit  after  Lehman.    Thus  we  
3:76:4588:27:28:71:544:202:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:interpret  the  Lehman’s  bankruptcy  as  an  implicit  shock  to  the  market’s  belief  that  large  banks  
3:77:4698:28:28:71:542:174:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:would not be allowed to fail. There is an ongoing debate in the theoretical literature as well as in 
3:78:4799:28:27:71:543:146:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:policy circles about the extent to which interbank markets are prone to contagion: Do shocks to 
3:79:4895:27:28:72:543:119:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:one part of the banking sector lead to a freeze of the overall market? A number of recent theory 
3:80:4992:28:0:72:546:91:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:papers  model  contagion  risk  from  information  asymmetry.  In  these  models  lenders  in  the  
4:81:5094:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:interbank market are unable to assess bank specific risks or the probability of liquidity shortages 
4:82:5194:27:28:72:545:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:which  then  can  lead  to  market  unraveling  when  negative  shocks  hit  banks.  See  for  example,  
4:83:5299:28:27:72:544:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Freixas  (1999)  and  Flannery  (1996)  or  more  recently  Heider,  Hoerova  and  Holthausen  (2009)  
4:84:5402:27:28:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and Acharya, Gale and Yorulmazer (2009). On the other side of the debate are scholars such as 
4:85:5496:28:28:72:544:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Furfine  (2001)  or  Flannery  and  Sorescu  (1996)  who  assume  that  participants  in  the  interbank  
4:86:5602:28:27:72:544:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:market  have  sufficient  knowledge  to  differentiate  between  banks  with  good  and  bad  credit  and  
4:87:5709:27:28:72:545:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:are  able  to  provide  liquidity  to  good  banks.  However,  to  date,  there  has  been  no  empirical  
4:88:5816:28:37:72:390:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:analysis of the overnight fed funds market during the 2008 crisis.  
4:89:5884:37:28:72:543:478:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:We use transaction level data of participants in the fed funds market to investigate the provision 
4:90:5983:28:28:72:544:450:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of  credit  in  this  market  after  the  Lehman  Brothers’  bankruptcy.  We  find  a  much  more  nuanced  
4:91:6091:28:27:72:544:422:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:picture: Under “normal” or pre-crisis conditions the fed funds market functions via rationing of 
4:92:6188:27:28:71:546:395:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:riskier  borrowers  rather  than  prices,  e.g.  adjustments  of  spreads.1  After  Lehman  we  see  a  
4:93:6292:28:27:72:544:367:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:different  picture  emerge:  In  the  days  immediately  after  the  Lehman  Brothers’  bankruptcy  the  
4:94:6397:27:28:72:542:340:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:market seems to become sensitive to bank specific characteristics, not only in the amounts lent to 
4:95:6496:28:28:72:543:312:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:borrowers  but  even  in  the  cost  of  overnight  funds.  We  see  sharp  differences  between  large  and  
4:96:6606:28:27:72:539:284:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:small banks in their access to credit: Large banks (especially those with high percentages of non-
4:97:6704:27:28:72:543:257:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:performing  loans)  show  drastically  reduced  daily  borrowing  amounts  after  Lehman  and  borrow  
4:98:6807:28:27:72:543:229:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:from fewer counterparties. In fact, the interest rate spread at which large banks borrow in the fed 
4:99:6907:27:28:72:543:202:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:funds market after Lehman falls below pre-crisis levels after September 16th, 2008. We interpret 
4:100:7004:28:27:72:545:174:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:this  initial  response  as  an  effect  of  credit  rationing.  In  contrast,  smaller  banks  were  able  to  
4:101:7116:27:27:72:545:147:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:increase  the  amount  borrowed  from  the  interbank  markets  and  even  managed  to  add  lending  
4:102:7218:27:7:216:219:120:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:                                                      
4:103:7271:7:16:72:543:113:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:1  For  example,  in  the  aftermath  of  the  Bear  Stearns’  near-bankruptcy  we  do  not  observe  that  interest  rates  spreads  
4:104:7405:16:12:72:542:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:become more sensitive to the underlying bank characteristics, e.g. performance and size. However, generally, we do 
4:105:7520:12:11:72:543:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:see  that  bank  characteristics  predict  borrowing  amounts  and  the  number  of  banks  willing  to  lend  to  a  borrower.

5:108:7787:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:from the predictions of many theoretical models of interbank lending, when faced with a market 
5:109:7882:28:27:72:544:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:wide  shock,  we  do  not  observe  a  complete  cessation  of  lending  but  instead  we  see  increased  
5:110:7989:27:38:72:357:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:differentiation between borrowers of high versus low type. 
5:111:8048:38:27:72:543:588:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:When looking at the exact timing of changes in the interbank market, we see that in the two days 
5:112:8145:27:28:72:542:561:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:after Lehman’s bankruptcy large banks show a steep decline in the amount of funds they borrow 
5:113:8239:28:28:72:546:533:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:while  small  banks  do  not  see  any  significant  decline  and  were  even  able  to  increase  their  
5:114:8345:28:27:72:544:505:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:borrowing.  The  sharp  drop  in  loan  volumes  is  mainly  driven  by  the  poorly  performing  banks  
5:115:8450:27:28:72:543:478:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(measured as banks with historically high levels of nonperforming loans (NPL) as a percentage 
5:116:8544:28:28:72:543:450:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of loans). This result is especially strong for the larger banks and suggests that directly after the 
5:117:8646:28:27:72:543:422:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:crisis lenders in the fed funds market became more sensitive to credit risk, especially for larger 
5:118:8745:27:28:72:543:395:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:borrowers. We find that this drop in loan volumes is associated with a sharp increase in interest 
5:119:8843:28:27:72:545:367:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:rates  and  a  loss  in  the  number  of  counterparties  large  (and  poorly  performing)  banks  borrow

5:121:9052:28:28:72:545:312:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(and  later  the  CPP)  the  trend  reverses  especially  for  the  large  banks.  After  the  AIG  bailout  is  
5:122:9165:28:27:72:544:284:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:announced,  spreads  for  the  largest  banks  fall  steeply,  falling  below  the  rate  in  the  week  before  
5:123:9278:27:28:72:544:257:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Lehman.  We  interpret  the  return  to  pre-crisis  spreads  as  the  effect  of  the  government’s  support  
5:124:9389:28:27:72:544:229:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:for  systematically  important  banks,  because  the  same  is  not  true  for  small  banks:  these  banks  
5:125:9498:27:38:72:443:202:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:continue to face higher spreads till well after the announcement of the CPP.   
5:126:9577:38:28:72:546:164:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:In  contrast,  we  do  not  find  a  relationship  between  lender  characteristics  and  amounts  lent  
5:127:9682:28:27:72:544:136:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:immediately  after  Lehman’s  failure.  Banks  that  might  be  expected  to  hoard  liquidity  (such  as  
5:128:9789:27:28:72:543:109:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:worse performing banks or banks that had been more dependent on repo financing) did not lend 
5:129:9882:28:0:72:544:81:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:less  in  the  interbank  market  after  the  crisis  compared  to  their  pre-crisis  lending.  This  suggests  
6:130:9997:0:27:72:545:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:either  that  these  banks  did  not  need  to  hoard  liquidity,  or  that  they  did  not  want  to  reveal  
6:131:10108:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:weakness to this market by appearing to hoard liquidity. The fact that larger, worse performing 
6:132:10204:28:27:72:545:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:banks  disproportionately  increased  their  number  of  counterparties  could  suggest  that  they  feel  
6:133:10311:27:28:71:544:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:more  pressure  to  signal  to  the  market  that  they  are  stable.  Of  course,  this  interpretation  is  only  
6:134:10427:28:28:72:545:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:suggestive;  and  alternative  interpretation  could  be  that  worse  performing  lenders  differentially  
6:135:10535:28:27:72:544:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:seek to diversify credit risk.  However, independently of the interpretation of the banks’ lending 
6:136:10634:27:28:72:544:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:behavior, the results suggest that liquidity hoarding was a less important factor in the difficulty 
6:137:10734:28:37:72:474:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:many banks had in accessing the fed fund market than the fear of counterparty risk. 
6:138:10818:37:28:72:545:478:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:It  is  difficult  to  definitively  determine  whether  the  fed  funds  market  was  able  to  efficiently  
6:139:10928:28:28:71:543:450:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:provide  banks  with  liquidity  through  the  crisis,  since  we  do  not  observe  the  full  distribution  of  
6:140:11042:28:27:71:543:422:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:latent demand and supply. After the Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy, it is likely that decreases in 
6:141:11138:27:28:71:544:395:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:banks’ other funding sources increased demand for overnight funds. We attempt to measure the 
6:142:11231:28:27:71:543:367:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:extent of unmet demand in two ways. First, we look at the use of the Federal Reserve’s discount 
6:143:11327:27:28:71:545:340:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:window  during  the  crisis.  Because  of  the  high  interest  rate  and  potential  for  stigma,  banks  
6:144:11434:28:28:71:543:312:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:usually access the discount window only if they face severe unmet liquidity needs. Thus use of 
6:145:11529:28:27:71:543:284:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the discount window gives a lower bound for the unmet liquidity needs in the fed funds market. 
6:146:11624:27:28:71:547:257:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:We  find  that  even  in  the  days  after  the  Lehman  Brothers’  bankruptcy  only  very  poorly  
6:147:11724:28:27:71:545:229:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:performing  banks,  those  with  low  ROA,  access  the  discount  window.  It  seems  reasonable  to  
6:148:11827:27:28:71:545:202:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:assume  that  these  are  banks  which  were  rationed  by  private  banks  lending  in  the  fed  funds  
6:149:11933:28:28:71:543:174:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:market.  While  again  it  is  difficult  to  assess  whether  this  means  that  interbank  markets  operated  
6:150:12045:28:27:71:543:146:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:efficiently after the crisis, it is, however, reassuring that we do not observe that well performing 
6:151:12146:27:28:71:546:119:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:banks  are  forced  to  turn  to  the  discount  window.  This  would  have  been  a  very  alarming  
6:152:12248:28:0:71:315:91:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:indication of dysfunction in the fed funds market.  
7:153:12302:0:27:72:549:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Second,   we   estimate   the   pre-crisis   relationship   between   fed   funds   borrowing,   bank   
7:154:12406:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:characteristics and the price of other overnight funding such as overnight repo and deposit rates. 
7:155:12505:28:27:72:543:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:We then use these relationships to predict post-crisis demand. While the amount borrowed in the 
7:156:12601:27:28:72:544:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:fed  funds  market  does  not  fall  sharply,  predicted  demand  for  the  fed  funds  market  far  exceeds  
7:157:12711:28:28:72:543:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:actual borrowing. The gap is not related to banks’ risk characteristics. Thus, while the overnight 
7:158:12810:28:27:72:546:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:market  did  not  collapse,  it  did  not  increase  at  a  time  when  there  was  likely  to  have  been  
7:159:12918:27:38:72:274:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:increased demand for overnight funding.

7:165:13306:28:37:72:469:357:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:financial contagion and the reasons why markets may freeze differ across studies.

7:170:13793:28:27:72:543:209:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Suarez (2010)’s general equilibrium model, counterparty risk in an economy  with  retail  deposit  
7:171:13892:27:28:72:544:182:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:insurance  may  lead  to  a  freeze  in  interbank  money  markets.  The  authors  show  that  the  risk  of  
7:172:14002:28:27:72:543:154:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:bank failure creates an asymmetric allocation of capital between banks with access to abundant 
7:173:14097:27:0:72:543:127:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:insured deposits (cheap funding) and those with no access that then need to pay higher spreads in 
8:174:14197:0:27:72:545:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:money  markets.  This  asymmetry  distorts  the  aggregate  allocation  of  credit  and  can  lead  to  a  
8:175:14304:27:38:72:266:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:drying-up of interbank money markets.

8:178:14559:28:27:72:543:588:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:demand, banks hoard liquidity in anticipation of high aggregate demand for liquidity to deal with

8:180:14765:28:28:71:543:533:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Hoarding liquidity also plays a key role in Diamond and Rajan (2009). The authors argue that an 
8:181:14861:28:27:71:545:505:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:overhang  of  illiquid  securities  might  reduce  their  price  sufficiently  such  that  banks  have  no  
8:182:14969:27:28:71:544:478:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:interest  in  selling  them.  Markets  then  freeze  as  investors  hoard  liquidity  expecting  high  returns

8:187:15449:27:28:71:543:330:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adverse selection ultimately leads to a market freeze. Adverse selection is also the driving factor

10:223:18721:28:28:72:544:578:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Federal  Funds,  or  fed  funds,  are  uncollateralized  loans  of  reserve  balances  at  Federal  Reserve  
10:224:18830:28:27:72:545:550:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:banks.  Banks  and  other  depository  institutions  keep  reserves  at  the  Federal  Reserve  banks  to  
10:225:18937:27:28:72:545:523:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:meet  reserve  requirements  and  to  clear  financial  transactions.  The  fed  funds  market  allows  
10:226:19041:28:27:72:543:495:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:institutions  with  excess  reserve  balances  to  lend  to  those  with  reserve  deficiencies.  These  loans  
10:227:19153:27:28:72:544:468:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:are  accounted  for  as  deposit  liabilities  exempt  from  the  reserve  requirements  under  the  Federal  
10:228:19263:28:28:72:545:440:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Reserve’s  Regulation  D  (Reserve  Requirements  of  Depository  Institutions2).  On  daily  basis,  
10:229:19365:28:27:72:546:412:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:financial  institutions  purchase  and  sell  reserve  balances,  mostly  overnight  (although  longer  
10:230:19469:27:38:72:421:385:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:maturity loans are also traded), at a rate known as the federal funds rate. 
10:231:19545:38:27:72:543:347:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The fed funds market is an over-the-counter market where institutions seeking to borrow or lend 
10:232:19641:27:28:72:545:320:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:negotiate  loan  terms  directly  with  each  other  or  indirectly  through  a  fed  funds  broker.  To

10:234:19851:27:28:72:544:265:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:without  a  contract.  These  verbal  agreements  rely  on  lending  relationships  and  on  established  
10:235:19957:28:28:72:544:237:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:credit lines between borrowing and lending institutions. Participants include commercial banks,

11:244:20408:27:28:72:544:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Depository  institutions  have  several  alternatives  to  the  fed  funds  market  to  meet  their  funding  
11:245:20518:28:27:71:543:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:needs.  First,  they  can  borrow  at  the  discount  window  from  one  of  the  three  lending  programs:  
11:246:20627:27:28:71:547:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:primary   credit,   secondary   credit   and   seasonal   credit   programs.3   Unlike   fed   funds   loans,   
11:247:20739:28:28:72:544:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:borrowing  from  the  discount  window  is  collateralized.  However,  the  Federal  Reserve  accepts  a  
11:248:20845:28:27:72:545:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:broad  range  of  assets  as  discount  window  collateral,  including  home  mortgages  and  related  
11:249:20948:27:28:72:542:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:assets, and thus collateral is unlikely to be a limiting factor.4 More importantly, banks have been 
11:250:21048:28:27:72:543:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:reluctant to borrow from the discount window because of a perceived “stigma”.5 Federal Reserve 
11:251:21143:27:28:72:542:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:banks extend primary credit on a short-term basis to banks that are adequately or well capitalized 
11:252:21242:28:28:72:544:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(CAMEL  rating  of  1-3),  for  up  to  90  days  at  a  rate  currently  25  basis  points  above  the  target  
11:253:21355:28:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:federal funds rate.6 Discount window loans are typically overnight and allow for early repayment 
11:254:21452:27:38:72:257:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of the loan if issued for a longer term. 
11:255:21493:38:27:72:546:367:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Second,  banks  can  bid  to  borrow  funds  from  the  Term  Auction  Facility  (TAF),  created  on  
11:256:21595:27:28:71:543:340:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:December  12,  2007.7  The  TAF  provides  funding  at  interest  rates  and  amounts  set  by  biweekly  
11:257:21701:28:40:72:543:312:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:auctions. Unlike the discount window and fed funds loans, TAF funding cannot be prepaid and is

11:259:21849:7:14:72:542:265:36:g_d0_f1:81:g_d0_f1:3  Primary  credit  is  extended  to  depository  institutions  with  strong  financial  positions  while  secondary  credit  is  offered  to  those 
11:260:21998:14:11:72:542:251:81:g_d0_f1:81:g_d0_f1:institutions that do not qualify for primary credit. Small depository institutions in agricultural communities are the typical users 
11:261:22131:11:10:71:139:240:81:g_d0_f1:81:g_d0_f1:of seasonal credit.

11:272:23007:11:10:72:450:125:81:g_d0_f1:81:g_d0_f1:50 to 25 basis points and the maximum maturity of discount window loans extended from 30 to 90 days.

12:279:23598:27:28:72:544:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:eligible  for  collateral  are  the  same  as  those  eligible  to  be  pledged  at  the  discount  window.  In  
12:280:23711:28:27:72:543:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:contrast to the discount window, TAF funding is not perceived to be associated with stigma. The 
12:281:23807:27:28:72:544:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:first  TAF  auction  was  held  on  December  17,  2007,  auctioning  $20  billion,  and  the  size  of  the  
12:282:23917:28:28:72:540:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:auctions were increased over time to a peak of $150 billion on October 6th, 2008. Auctions of 84-
12:283:24014:28:37:72:484:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:day credit were established in July 2008 to supplement the existing 28-day auctions.   
12:284:24101:37:28:72:546:533:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Borrowing  in  the  repo  market  is  a  third  alternative.  A  repurchase  agreement,  or  repo,  is  a  
12:285:24208:28:27:72:543:505:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:financial contract that allows the use of a financial security as collateral for a cash loan, mostly 
12:286:24309:27:28:72:542:478:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:on an overnight basis, at a rate known as the repo rate. The overnight repo rate is generally lower 
12:287:24409:28:38:72:185:450:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:than the fed funds rate. 
12:288:24434:38:27:72:544:412:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The  repo  market  is  a  large  and  opaque  over-the-counter  market  which  exceeded  $10  trillion  in

12:291:24736:27:28:72:543:330:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:average  haircuts  for  non-US  Treasury  collateral  increased  from  approximately  25  percent  to  43  
12:292:24843:28:28:72:543:302:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:percent in these two weeks, and argue that this pricing change was the result of concerns about 
12:293:24939:28:37:72:326:274:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the illiquidity of the assets being used as collateral.8

14:353:30394:10:11:71:542:167:81:g_d0_f1:81:g_d0_f1:advanced to October 1, 2008 by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. Initially, the interest rate paid on required 
14:354:30521:11:10:71:542:156:81:g_d0_f1:81:g_d0_f1:reserve balances was 10 basis points below the average target federal funds rate over a reserve maintenance period while the rate 
14:355:30651:10:10:71:541:146:81:g_d0_f1:81:g_d0_f1:for  excess  balances  was  set  at  75  basis  points  below  the  lowest  target  federal  funds  rate  for  a  reserve  maintenance  period.  The 
14:356:30799:10:11:71:543:136:81:g_d0_f1:81:g_d0_f1:Federal  Reserve  began  to  pay  interest  for  the  maintenance  periods  beginning  on  October  9,  2008.  The  interest  rate  paid  on

14:359:31234:10:11:71:542:105:81:g_d0_f1:81:g_d0_f1:reserve maintenance period while the interest rate on excess balances was equal to the lowest target federal funds rate in effect

17:410:35564:28:27:71:543:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:tabulate  the  daily  percentage  of  banks  borrowing,  by  dividing  the  number  of  unique  borrowers  
17:411:35671:27:38:71:534:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:by the total 360 banks that borrowed in the sample time period (April 2007 to February 2008).

17:414:35970:28:28:72:546:533:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:funds  loan  rates  and  the  target  fed  funds  rate  almost  doubles  in  the  period  immediately  
17:415:36073:28:27:72:543:505:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:surrounding the Lehman’s bankruptcy, and the volatility of spreads increases as well. It is worth 
17:416:36171:27:28:72:546:478:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:noting  that  even  in  the  pre-Lehman  time  period,  approximately  30%  of  borrowers  actually  
17:417:36272:28:28:72:543:450:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:borrow on any given day. This number falls to 27.5% surrounding Lehman’s bankruptcy, and the 
17:418:36365:28:27:72:543:422:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:decline in mean daily borrowers is significantly different from the pre-Lehman period only after 
17:419:36462:27:38:72:178:395:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:IOR (October 2008).

17:422:36604:28:27:72:545:292:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:banks.  The  borrower  sample  includes  only  borrowers  with  call  report  data  so  that  we  can  
17:423:36707:27:28:72:547:265:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:measure   banks’   characteristics   consistently.   It   includes   loans   from   all   lenders,   including

17:425:36914:28:27:72:543:209:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:As summarized in TABLE II, the median borrower in this market has more than $1billion in assets 
17:426:37009:27:28:72:544:182:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(the  mean  is  $27  billion)  and  non-performing  loans  of  0.8%  of  total  loans  as  of  December  31,  
17:427:37119:28:45:72:348:154:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:2007 (the mean level of non-performing loans is 1.1%).

18:433:37499:37:28:72:542:671:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The analysis also considers the relationship between lender characteristics and the price, amount

18:435:37702:27:28:72:544:616:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:lender  sample  is  different  from  the  borrower  sample,  because  it  includes  only  lenders  with  call  
18:436:37813:28:27:72:542:588:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:report data. Excluded are loans from GSEs and US subsidiaries of foreign banking organizations, 
18:437:37909:27:28:72:543:561:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:but we included loans to those entities. The median lender in this market has characteristics that 
18:438:38008:28:28:72:542:533:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:are similar to those of the median borrower, with close to $1billion in assets and non-performing 
18:439:38106:28:27:72:543:505:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:loans of 0.8% of total loans as of December 31, 2007, again the mean values are $26 billion and 
18:440:38202:27:38:72:173:478:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:1.3%, respectively.

18:444:38287:28:27:72:543:337:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:In the following analyses we want to shed light on the functioning of the fed funds market in the 
18:445:38385:27:28:72:544:310:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:aftermath  of  a  major  shock  to  the  banking  industry,  the  bankruptcy  of  Lehman  Brothers.  Our  
18:446:38491:28:28:72:545:282:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:objective  is  to  document  which  banks  were  able  to  access  the  market  after  the  onset  of  the  
18:447:38599:28:27:72:544:254:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Lehman  crisis  and  at  what  terms.  The  alternative  view  is  that  this  shock  led  to  a  market  wide  
18:448:38711:27:28:72:545:227:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:collapse  of  the  fed  funds  market  and  prevented  even  banks  that  are  good  credit  risks  from  
18:449:38817:28:27:72:542:199:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:accessing to the market. For that purpose we look at different dimensions of access to credit such 
18:450:38916:27:28:72:547:172:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:as   the   interest   rate   at   which   banks   borrow,   the   amount   of   loans,   and   the   number   of   
18:451:39031:28:28:72:543:144:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:counterparties. The last two are particularly important since many participants suggest that credit 
18:452:39131:28:0:72:480:116:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:risk in the interbank market is managed via credit rationing rather than interest rates. 
19:453:39223:0:27:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:In TABLE III we first look at the effect of the Lehman’s bankruptcy on the fed funds market with 
19:454:39320:27:28:72:544:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and  without  controlling  for  fixed  bank  borrower  characteristics.  This  allows  us  to  separate  the  
19:455:39430:28:27:72:543:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:effect of the crisis on a given bank from the composition effects of who (was able to) access the 
19:456:39528:27:28:72:547:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:interbank  market  after  the  Lehman  crisis.  The  first  column  is  a  probit  estimation  with  a  
19:457:39632:28:28:72:543:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:dependent variable equal  to  one  if  a  bank  borrows  on  a  given day. We do not estimate a probit 
19:458:39735:28:27:72:544:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:model with borrower fixed effects because fixed effects for the 20 banks that borrow every day 
19:459:39830:27:28:72:544:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(including  the  period  around  Lehman’s  bankruptcy)  would  perfectly  predict  access  and  thus  be  
19:460:39936:28:27:72:546:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:excluded  from  the  analysis,  distorting  the  results.  The  dependent  variable  in  the  next  two  
19:461:40041:27:28:72:544:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:columns  is  the  spread  to  target  (the  difference  between  the  weighted  average  interest  rate  for  a  
19:462:40154:28:28:72:544:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:given  bank  and  the  target  interest  rate),  columns  (4)  and  (5)  report  the  effect  on  the  log  of  the  
19:463:40271:28:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:amount  borrowed  and  finally  columns  (6)  and  (7)  show  the  log  number  of  counterparties  for  a  
19:464:40379:27:38:72:158:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:given borrower.   
19:465:40397:38:27:72:543:367:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:In contrast to theoretical predictions of a cessation in trading, without controlling for bank fixed 
19:466:40498:27:28:72:546:340:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:effects,  there  does  not  seem  to  be  much  happening  in  the  two  days  following  Lehman’s  
19:467:40598:28:28:72:546:312:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:bankruptcy.  While  the  probit  estimation  suggests  access  to  the  interbank  market  decreased  
19:468:40700:28:27:72:543:284:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:around the Lehman’s bankruptcy, the change to the market is not the abrupt cessation of activity 
19:469:40797:27:28:72:544:257:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:predicted  by  some  theories.  Rather  than  a  sudden  large  negative  coefficient  immediately  after  
19:470:40904:28:27:72:543:229:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Lehman’s bankruptcy, we estimate small negative coefficients beginning in August 2008. These 
19:471:40997:27:38:72:425:202:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:negative coefficients become significantly more negative only after IOR. 
19:472:41070:38:28:72:543:164:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:There is no statistically significant change in the amount borrowed (column (4)) or the number of 
19:473:41168:28:27:72:545:136:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:counterparties  (column  (6)).  Spreads  increase  on  Monday,  September  15th,  but  begin  falling  
19:474:41271:27:0:72:543:109:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:thereafter (column (2)). Results are similar when the data are grouped by lender and controlling 
20:475:41371:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:for  fixed  lender  characteristics  and  when  data  is  included  for  all  borrowers  and  all  lenders  (see  
20:476:41485:27:38:72:278:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:TABLE XIII and TABLE XIV in Appendix). 
20:477:41522:38:27:72:543:643:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:But that hides a dramatic shift in the flow of funds and the distribution of rates across different 
20:478:41622:27:28:72:544:616:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:borrowers  revealed  by  controlling  for  borrower  fixed  effects.  When  we  include  borrower  fixed  
20:479:41728:28:27:72:543:588:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:effects in column (5) the coefficient on the post Lehman dummy is negative and significant with 
20:480:41824:27:28:72:544:561:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:a  coefficient  estimate  of  -0.19  on  September  15th.  The  economic  effect  is  economically  large  
20:481:41931:28:28:72:545:533:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:since  a  point  estimate  of  -0.19  translates  into  a  reduction  of  lending  of  17.3%.  The  results  
20:482:42040:28:27:72:542:505:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:suggest that while after the Lehman’s bankruptcy the average loan size of banks in the fed funds 
20:483:42137:27:28:71:542:478:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:market did not drop (TABLE III, column (4)), for any given bank the amount borrowed decreased 
20:484:42231:28:27:72:542:450:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(TABLE III, column (5)). These two seemingly contrary effects can only be reconciled if there is a 
20:485:42330:27:28:72:543:423:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:change in the composition of banks that are borrowing in the market: larger banks or those banks 
20:486:42427:28:28:72:542:395:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that were able to borrow larger amounts must have accessed the interbank market less often after 
20:487:42524:28:27:72:544:367:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the Lehman’s bankruptcy. Therefore, the average loan in the sample is unchanged, while at the 
20:488:42618:27:28:72:543:340:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:same time the average bank in the sample sees a decline in the amount borrowed. It seems that 
20:489:42712:28:28:72:545:312:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:those  banks  that  usually  borrow  a  lot  and  often  from  the  market  were  the  ones  facing  very  
20:490:42819:28:27:72:544:284:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:different  borrowing  terms  or  even  losing  access,  while  banks  that  use  the  market  less  seem  to  
20:491:42929:27:38:72:236:257:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:have increased their borrowing.    
20:492:42964:38:27:72:544:219:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Similarly,  Column  (7)  shows  that  there  is  a  reduction  in  the  number  of  counterparties  a  bank  
20:493:43073:27:28:72:544:192:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:borrows  from  post-Lehman  only  after  including  borrower  fixed  effects.  The  coefficient  on  the  
20:494:43179:28:28:72:545:164:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:post-Lehman  dummy  is  negative  in  the  cross  section  but  not  significant.  This  suggests  that  a  
20:495:43287:28:27:72:543:136:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:given borrower in the sample borrows from fewer counterparties post-Lehman. Even those banks 
20:496:43380:27:28:72:544:109:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:which  are  able  to  access  the  fed  funds  market  after  the  Lehman’s  bankruptcy  borrow  from  a  
20:497:43486:28:0:72:243:81:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:smaller number of counterparties.   
21:498:43525:0:27:72:539:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:It  is  important  to  note  that  when  including  borrower  fixed  effects  in  TABLE III  the  adjusted  R-
21:499:43635:27:28:72:545:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:squared  jumps  dramatically.  So  clearly  bank  characteristics  are  an  important  determinant  of  
21:500:43739:28:27:72:544:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:banks’  borrowing  in  the  fed  funds  market.  In  fact,  including  only  borrower  characteristics  such  
21:501:43849:27:28:71:544:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:as  assets,  ROA,  NPL  levels  and  risk  ratios  instead  of  bank  fixed  effects,  we  can  explain  about  
21:502:43961:28:37:71:526:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:70% of the cross sectional variation of bank borrowing and interest rates (unreported results).

21:516:45113:28:27:72:544:144:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the  fed  funds  market  (not  included  when  the  dependent  variable  is  amount),  and  εb,t  is  an  error  
21:517:45226:27:0:72:537:117:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:term. The Fed Funds terms specifications include αb fixed effects for bank borrowers (lenders).   
22:518:45327:0:27:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:We consider characteristics of borrowing (lending) banks in two ways. First, we split the sample 
22:519:45424:27:28:72:545:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:into  three  equally  sized  bins  by  asset  size.  The  smallest  banks  are  those  with  less  than  $937  
22:520:45535:28:27:72:547:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:million  in  assets,  and  the  largest  have  more  than  $3.5  billion.  In  the  fed  funds  terms  
22:521:45638:27:28:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:specifications (TABLE IV to TABLE VII), there are fewer observations in the smaller bank group, 
22:522:45734:28:28:72:543:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:because smaller banks are less frequent borrowers (both in the pre- and post-crisis periods). We 
22:523:45831:28:27:72:543:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:estimate the same specifications separately for each size group, allowing all of the coefficients to 
22:524:45932:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:vary with bank size. We present the coefficients for the largest and smallest banks to show how 
22:525:46028:28:27:72:546:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:pricing  changes  differently  for  large  and  small  banks.  When  the  difference  in  coefficients  
22:526:46132:27:28:72:544:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:between  columns  is  statistically  significant,  the  coefficients  are  shown  in  bold  type.  It  is  worth  
22:527:46246:28:28:72:545:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:emphasizing  that  the  fed  funds  terms  regressions  include  borrower  (lender)  fixed  effects.  Our  
22:528:46353:28:27:72:544:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:identification therefore is only driven by changes in the sensitivity of fed funds terms to banks’ 
22:529:46452:27:28:72:546:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:pre-crisis  characteristics.  That  means  we  estimate  a  change  in  the  slope  of  the  relationship  
22:530:46559:28:37:72:412:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:between bank characteristics and fed funds’ loan amounts and pricing. 
22:531:46629:37:28:72:543:340:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Since the fed funds terms specifications already include controls for bank fixed effects, splitting 
22:532:46729:28:28:72:544:312:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the  sample  by  asset  size  also  allows  us  to  see  if  the  time  period  effect  is  different  for  banks  of  
22:533:46848:28:27:72:544:284:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:different  sizes.  We  also  control  for  the  interaction  of  asset  size  and  the  date  dummies  in  each  
22:534:46961:27:28:72:542:257:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:specification shown in TABLE V - TABLE VII, although these coefficients are not presented in the 
22:535:47057:28:27:72:543:229:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:tables. In the specifications with spread or counterparties as a dependent variable, we control for 
22:536:47157:27:28:72:543:202:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:interaction of amount borrowed divided by asset size and the date dummies in each specification, 
22:537:47254:28:27:71:543:174:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:although  these  coefficients  are  not  presented  in  the  tables.  We  next  add  the  interaction  of  bank  
22:538:47367:27:28:71:544:147:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:characteristics such as the percentage of non-performing loans with time period dummies to the 
22:539:47462:28:28:71:544:119:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:specifications  sorted  by  bank  size.  The  end  result  is  effectively  a  triple  difference-in-difference  
22:540:47575:28:0:71:543:91:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:estimation, testing to see if the market becomes more sensitive to these underlying characteristics 
23:541:47678:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:in the post-Lehman period, and if fed funds borrowing of small and large banks is differentially 
23:542:47775:27:38:72:235:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:sensitive to these characteristics.  
23:543:47812:38:27:72:544:643:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:We  first  test  to  see  if  borrowing  (lending)  is  associated  with  borrower  (lender)  characteristics  
23:544:47923:27:28:72:544:616:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(TABLE V).  We  find  that  borrowers  and  lenders  that  are  large  access  the  fed  funds  market  less  
23:545:48033:28:27:72:543:588:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:after  Lehman’s  bankruptcy.  Furthermore,  it  is  the  worst  performing  large  banks  that  access  the  
23:546:48142:27:28:72:546:561:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:market  least  –  the  coefficient  on  %  NPL  is  negative  and  statistically  significant  for  large  
23:547:48249:28:28:72:543:533:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:borrowers.  Surprisingly, this pattern is reversed for lenders – the worst performing large lenders 
23:548:48349:28:37:72:531:505:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:are actually more likely to lend on the Monday and Tuesday following Lehman’s bankruptcy.   
23:549:48441:37:28:71:545:468:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:TABLE V  examines  how  interbank  lending  rates  for  large  and  small  banks  changed  after  the  
23:550:48544:28:28:72:544:440:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Lehman  Brothers’  bankruptcy.  While  smaller  borrowers  see  an  increase  in  spreads  of  over  94  
23:551:48649:28:27:72:539:412:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:basis points on Monday, the larger borrowers have no significant increase in their spreads. Post-
23:552:48746:27:28:72:544:385:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Lehman  spread  changes  are  similar  for  small  and  large  lenders.  In  columns  (3)  and  (4)  and  (7)  
23:553:48857:28:27:72:543:357:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and (8) we add interactions of the post-Lehman dummies with non-performing loans as a proxy 
23:554:48949:27:28:72:544:330:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of  borrower  and  lender  quality.15  Immediately  after  the  Lehman’s  bankruptcy,  the  relationship  
23:555:49055:28:37:71:448:302:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:between spreads and quality is no different from that of the pre-crisis period.   
23:556:49137:37:28:71:546:265:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:These  results  underscore  again  that  interest  rates  in  the  fed  fund  markets  did  not  become  
23:557:49242:28:28:71:544:237:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:increasingly  sensitive  to  bank  performance  metrics  in  a  consistent  manner.  Yet  this  does  not  
23:558:49349:28:27:71:543:209:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:necessarily mean that lenders are not concerned about the counterparty risk of banks. But rather 
23:559:49446:27:28:71:542:182:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the results suggest that lenders seem to be more likely to manage their risk exposure to individual 
23:560:49546:28:27:71:543:154:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:banks by the amount they lend to a given bank or even whether they lend at all to the bank. The 
23:561:49642:27:30:72:546:127:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:fact  that  interest  rates  go  up  for  the  smaller  banks  but  not  for  the  larger  banks  does  not  
23:562:49751:30:7:216:219:97:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:                                                      
23:563:49804:7:16:72:543:90:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:15  Surprisingly,  we  do  not  consistently  see  a  flight  to  quality  as  measured  by  ROA  or  risk  ratio.    These  results  are  
23:564:49943:16:0:72:174:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:available upon request.    
24:565:49973:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:necessarily constitute a flight to size. In contrast these trends could be driven by rationing in the 
24:566:50075:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:market. If only smaller banks are able to access the fed funds market after the Lehman Brothers 
24:567:50171:28:27:72:542:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:shock but at higher rates, we could find higher rates for smaller banks. But in this case the higher 
24:568:50272:27:28:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:rate is an indication that only smaller banks are able to access the market, while large banks are 
24:569:50371:28:28:72:546:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:not.  The  results  of  the  next  two  tables  will  provide  additional  evidence  to  corroborate  this  
24:570:50479:28:37:72:143:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:interpretation. 
24:571:50495:37:38:280:334:533:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:[TABLE V] 
24:572:50505:38:27:72:544:495:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:We  next  describe  in  TABLE VI the  daily  amount  borrowed  by  banks  in  the  fed  funds  market.  
24:573:50608:27:28:72:545:468:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Interestingly  we  see  a  difference  in  the  effect  on  larger  versus  smaller  banks  which  comes  
24:574:50714:28:28:71:544:440:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:through  differences  in  bank  quality.  The  decline  in  borrowing  on  September  15th  is  largest  for  
24:575:50824:28:27:72:543:412:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:large banks with high amounts of non-performing loans (-49.1). This means that the reduction in 
24:576:50920:27:28:72:544:385:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:loan  amounts  post  Lehman  for  large  banks  is  concentrated  in  banks  with  more  non-performing  
24:577:51025:28:37:72:109:357:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:loans.   
24:578:51034:37:28:72:543:320:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Borrowers that have higher quality metrics are able to access larger loans in the fed funds market 
24:579:51133:28:27:72:543:292:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:on  September  15th.  The  interaction  between  NPLs  and  Monday  shows  banks  with  higher  NPLs  
24:580:51235:27:28:72:542:265:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:are associated with lower borrowing post Lehman.16 The relationship is also economically large. 
24:581:51331:28:28:72:545:237:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:These  results  underscore  that  banks  manage  their  risk  exposure  in  the  interbank  market  via  
24:582:51436:28:27:71:543:209:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:rationing of loan amounts rather than interest rates. Large banks with high percentages of NPLs 
24:583:51532:27:28:71:543:182:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:continue to borrow less even after the Federal Reserve’s investment in AIG was announced after 
24:584:51627:28:27:71:543:154:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the close of the market on September 16th. In unreported analysis, we found similar results when 
24:585:51724:27:28:72:543:127:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:we estimated similar specifications looking only at a binary measure of whether a bank accessed 
24:586:51820:28:14:71:159:99:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the market or not. 
24:587:51839:14:7:216:219:85:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:                                                      
24:588:51892:7:0:72:465:78:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:16 Similarly, lower ROAs and lower risk ratios are associated with lower borrowing post Lehman. 
25:589:51991:0:27:72:544:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:In  contrast,  lender  characteristics  such  as  NPLs  are  not  associated  with  changes  in  the  amount  
25:590:52101:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:lent immediately after Lehman Brothers. This means that even riskier banks did not hoard funds 
25:591:52196:28:27:72:546:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:on  the  Monday  and  Tuesday  after  Lehman’s  failure.  While  we  do  not  observe  meaningful  
25:592:52295:27:28:72:544:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:differences  in  the  lending  amounts  of  riskier  banks,  it  is  impossible  to  know  from  amounts  if  
25:593:52405:28:28:72:543:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:these lenders were trying to send a positive signal to the interbank market or simply did not want 
25:594:52504:28:37:72:148:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:to hoard cash.   
25:595:52521:37:38:278:336:533:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:[TABLE VI] 
25:596:52532:38:27:72:543:495:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Finally in TABLE VII we look at the composition of counterparties. We again begin by splitting 
25:597:52626:27:28:71:544:468:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the  specification  between  the  smallest  and  largest  banks.  Controlling  for  amount  borrowed,  we  
25:598:52733:28:28:71:544:440:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:see  a  sharp  difference  in  the  number  of  counterparties  for  smaller  versus  large  borrowers.  The  
25:599:52843:28:27:71:547:412:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:direct  effect  of  the  Monday  (9/15)  post-Lehman  dummy  now  turns  positive  for  smaller  
25:600:52940:27:28:71:543:385:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:borrowers while the coefficient for large borrowers is negative and highly significant; the point 
25:601:53038:28:27:71:544:357:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:estimate  is  -0.129.  Large  banks  see  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  counterparties  they  
25:602:53148:27:28:71:544:330:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:borrow  from  while  smaller  banks  have  more  counterparties  immediately  post  Lehman.  Smaller  
25:603:53250:28:28:71:544:302:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:banks  do  not  seem  to  be  as  strongly  affected  by  the  Lehman  shock.  In  fact,  the  market  was  
25:604:53358:28:27:71:545:274:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:functioning  well  enough  that  small  banks  were  able  to  add  more  counterparties  in  order  to  
25:605:53463:27:28:72:545:247:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:maintain  their  level  of  borrowing  from  the  market.  The  reduction  in  counterparties  for  larger  
25:606:53571:28:27:72:543:219:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:banks appears to be driven by larger banks with worse performance (as measured by NPLs).  In 
25:607:53664:27:28:72:546:192:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:contrast,  smaller  banks’  number  of  counterparties  does  not  appear  to  be  associated  with  
25:608:53765:28:37:72:145:164:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:performance.   
25:609:53780:37:28:72:544:127:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:We  find  an  interesting  relationship between lender characteristics and counterparties. For every 
25:610:53881:28:0:72:542:99:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:additional  1%  in  NPLs,  larger  lenders  increase  their  counterparties  by  8%  on  September  15th. 
26:611:53990:0:27:72:544:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Effectively,  worse  performing  larger  banks  are  distributing  the  same  amount  of  money  to  more  
26:612:54097:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:counterparties – spreading the signal that they are lending to even more banks. We do not see a 
26:613:54193:28:27:72:543:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:similar increase in counterparties for small banks, perhaps because it is more difficult for them to 
26:614:54294:27:38:72:227:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:quickly increase counterparties. 
26:615:54327:38:27:72:542:588:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Overall we show that large banks that are borrowing in the fed funds market see a sharp increase 
26:616:54424:27:28:72:543:561:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:in  spreads  and  a  drop  in  loan  amounts  immediately  following  the  Lehman’s  bankruptcy.  These  
26:617:54529:28:28:72:544:533:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:effects are particularly strong for large banks with high NPL levels. In contrast, small banks do 
26:618:54627:28:27:72:546:505:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:not  experience  the  same  fall  in  loan  amounts.  However,  immediately  before  the  Federal  
26:619:54726:27:28:72:543:478:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Reserve’s $85 billion loan to AIG is announced (and again after the initial CPP announcement) 
26:620:54820:28:28:72:543:450:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:we see that spreads for large banks return to pre-crisis levels or below. These results suggest that 
26:621:54921:28:27:72:544:422:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the  Lehman’s  bankruptcy  led  to  a  change  in  beliefs  in  the  interbank  market  about  whether  the  
26:622:55030:27:28:72:545:395:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:authorities  would  let  big  banks  fail.  In  response  we  see  that  lenders  in  the  fed  funds  market  
26:623:55141:28:27:72:544:367:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:started  both  pricing  the  credit  risk  of  and  reducing  exposure  to  poorly  performing  large  banks  
26:624:55251:27:28:72:544:340:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(rather  than  a  complete  freeze  of  the  market).  However,  as  soon  as  the  AIG  loan  is  announced  
26:625:55361:28:28:72:543:312:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the fear of counterparty risk for large banks is alleviated and loan amounts and spreads go back 
26:626:55458:28:27:72:543:284:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:to pre-crisis levels. In contrast, we do not see any significant changes in banks’ average lending 
26:627:55557:27:28:72:545:257:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:amounts  in  response  to  the  crisis.  There  is  some  evidence  that  especially  larger  banks  lend  to  
26:628:55668:28:27:72:542:229:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:more counterparties. These results do not seem consistent with liquidity hoarding by banks in the 
26:629:55766:27:38:72:160:202:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:interbank market.

27:634:55827:27:28:72:545:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:One  concern  with  the  preceding  analysis  is  that  observed  transactions  are  the  result  of  the  
27:635:55934:28:27:71:545:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:intersection  of  supply  and  demand.  To  cleanly  differentiate  between  the  supply  and  demand  
27:636:56037:27:28:72:545:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:effects  we  would  need  to  observe  the  levels  and  changes  of  (unmet)  demand  and  supply  of  
27:637:56141:28:28:72:544:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:liquidity that banks have. This is very difficult to obtain since it entails knowing the amount and 
27:638:56241:28:37:72:430:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the interest rate schedule at which each bank would have liked to borrow.  
27:639:56316:37:28:72:544:533:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The  overnight  interbank  market  provides  a  rare opportunity to observe latent  demand,  since  we  
27:640:56420:28:27:72:544:505:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:can  observe  other  sources  of  funding  that  banks  access.  In  particular  we  obtained  data  on  the  
27:641:56530:27:28:72:543:478:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:amount of loans that banks draw down from the discount window. Borrowing from the discount 
27:642:56621:28:28:72:543:450:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:window is a near perfect proxy for latent or unmet demand: on the one hand it is provided by the 
27:643:56718:28:27:72:543:422:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Federal Reserve at the same periodicity as fed funds, i.e. as daily overnight loans. But the rate is 
27:644:56819:27:28:72:543:395:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:higher than the target fed funds rate (the rate has been 25 basis point higher than the target rate 
27:645:56919:28:27:72:545:367:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:since  March  17,  2008  and  was  50  basis  points  higher  prior  to  that).  Second,  while  discount  
27:646:57026:27:28:72:542:340:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:window loans are collateralized, collateral is unlikely to be a limiting factor for discount window 
27:647:57126:28:28:72:544:312:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:access.  Finally,  the  discount  window  can  be  accessed  at  the  end  of  the  day,  allowing  banks  to  
27:648:57237:28:27:72:546:284:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:first  transact  in  the  fed  funds  market.  However,  in  addition  to  the  interest  rate  premium,  
27:649:57343:27:28:72:543:257:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:accessing the discount window is associated with a stigma. So banks will only resort to this form 
27:650:57441:28:37:72:363:229:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of liquidity if they are shut out from other forms of funding. 
27:651:57504:37:28:72:544:192:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Therefore, we first analyze whether the level of borrowing from the discount window increased 
27:652:57598:28:28:71:544:164:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:dramatically after the Lehman’s bankruptcy. Similar to the analysis in TABLE IV, we include in 
27:653:57693:28:0:71:543:136:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the possible sample all banks that borrow from the fed funds market from April 2008 to February 
28:654:57792:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:2009, and indicate with a binary variable equal to one if they access the discount window.17 In a 
28:655:57890:27:28:71:542:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:second step we examine which types of banks accessed the discount window after Lehman. If the 
28:656:57984:28:27:71:543:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:main predictor of accessing the discount window is poor past performance, we infer that the fed 
28:657:58080:27:28:71:543:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:funds  market  is  allocating  funds  to  better  banks,  which  would  be  consistent  with  the  predicted  
28:658:58190:28:28:71:543:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:demand  shortfalls  of  weaker  banks.  However,  in  contrast,  if  we  see  that  even  banks  with  good  
28:659:58299:28:27:71:539:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:past  performance  have  to  go  to  the  discount  window  to  meet  their  liquidity  needs  in  the  post-
28:660:58408:27:38:71:436:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Lehman period, it would be a sign of dysfunction in the fed funds markets.  
28:661:58484:38:27:71:544:505:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:In column (1) of TABLE VIII we use a probit estimator of the likelihood that a bank goes to the 
28:662:58580:27:28:72:543:478:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:discount  window  pre-and  post-Lehman  controlling  for  the  interest  rate  and  lending  amount  this  
28:663:58687:28:28:72:543:450:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:bank had in its last transaction on the fed funds market. There is a clear increase in the likelihood 
28:664:58789:28:27:72:540:422:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of accessing the discount window, especially on Monday, September 15th. In specifications (2)–
28:665:58883:27:28:72:544:395:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(5)  we  then  explore  the  likelihood  that  a  bank  accesses  the  discount  window  as  a  function  of  
28:666:58993:28:27:72:544:367:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:bank  characteristics  and  its  past  borrowing  behavior  in  the  fed  funds  market.    We  find  a  very  
28:667:59104:27:28:72:542:340:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:strong and economically large correlation between bank ROA and the likelihood of accessing the 
28:668:59199:28:28:72:543:312:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:discount window. Only banks that have very poor performance as measured by ROA turn to the 
28:669:59290:28:27:72:544:284:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:discount  window.  We  find  similar  results  with  NPL  on  Tuesday  September  16th,  but  the  NPL  
28:670:59394:27:28:72:543:257:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:results are not statistically significant in every time period, perhaps because the number of banks 
28:671:59494:28:37:72:250:229:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:accessing the window is quite small. 
28:672:59531:37:28:72:543:192:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:So overall, while we cannot rule out that some banks were screened out of the market it appears 
28:673:59627:28:55:72:544:164:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that  the  turmoil  in  the  interbank  market  cannot  have  been  that  big  that  completely  normal  and

28:676:59914:16:11:72:543:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:observations where banks have not yet borrowed, resulting in a lower number of observations compared to the fed 
28:677:60026:11:0:72:210:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:funds access analysis (TABLE IV). 
29:678:60063:0:27:72:544:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:solvent  banks  had  to  turn  to  the  discount  window  for  liquidity.  This  provides  evidence  that  the  
29:679:60175:27:38:71:375:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:interbank market was not completely frozen through the crisis.

29:683:60298:37:28:72:543:531:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Our next measure of bank demand for fed funds exploits disruptions in other overnight funding 
29:684:60392:28:28:72:543:503:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:markets  to  identify  banks  that  might  have  increased  demand  for  overnight  funds.  According  to  
29:685:60499:28:27:72:543:475:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:market participants, in normal times, banks will seek liquidity in the fed funds and repo markets 
29:686:60597:27:28:72:544:448:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and will substitute between the markets depending on pricing (subject to collateral availability). 
29:687:60696:28:27:72:545:420:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:As  shown  by  Gorton  and  Metrick  (2009a)  this  market  was  severely  disrupted  after  Lehman’s  
29:688:60799:27:28:72:543:393:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:failure, with dramatically increased haircuts and pricing. Therefore, to the extent that these two 
29:689:60898:28:28:72:543:365:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:markets are substitutes, post-Lehman fed funds borrowing demand should increase for banks that 
29:690:60993:28:27:72:545:337:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:fund  a  larger  percentage  of  their  assets  with  repo  borrowing.  We  examine  the  relationship  
29:691:61097:27:28:72:542:310:144:g_d0_f1:90:g_d0_f1:between bank borrowing (lending) and changes in the access to overnight repo markets in TABLE

29:699:61827:27:0:71:545:79:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the  identical  analysis  for  lenders.  Immediately  following  Lehman’s  bankruptcy,  there  is  no

30:701:62039:27:28:72:545:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:controlling  for  %  NPL,  the  coefficients  in  column  (4)  are  higher  than  those  in  column  (3)  of  
30:702:62149:28:27:72:546:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:TABLE IX in  the  three  days  immediately  surrounding  the  Lehman’s  bankruptcy  (rows  2-4),  
30:703:62246:27:28:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:indicating that banks that should have higher demand for fed funds loans are not increasing their 
30:704:62344:28:28:71:545:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:borrowing  more  than  banks  which  do  not  have  reduced  access  to  an  important  source  of  
30:705:62444:28:27:71:544:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:overnight  funding.  If  pre-crisis  reliance  on  repo  funding  is  an  indicator  for  increased  liquidity  
30:706:62556:27:28:71:543:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:demand post Lehman, our results suggest that lending in the fed fund market did not expand in 
30:707:62650:28:27:71:544:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:response  to  increased  demand;  not  even  for  the  best  of  these  borrowers  (those  with  low  NPL  
30:708:62757:27:38:71:109:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:levels). 
30:709:62766:38:28:71:544:450:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Just  as  borrowers  which  relied  on  the  repo  market  for  overnight  financing  should  have  higher  
30:710:62874:28:27:71:544:422:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:demand  for  fed  funds,  lenders  which  relied  on  the  repo  market  for  overnight  financing  might  
30:711:62981:27:28:71:543:395:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:reduce their supply of fed funds when the repo market dried up. In this market we do see that in 
30:712:63078:28:27:71:543:367:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:many cases the coefficients in column (4) of TABLE X are lower than the coefficients in column 
30:713:63172:27:28:72:547:340:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(3)  (rows  2-4)  after  Monday,  September  15th  although  the  difference  is  not  statistically  
30:714:63274:28:28:72:543:312:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:significant. Again, this effect is reversed for lenders with higher NPLs. Lenders with high NPLs 
30:715:63371:28:27:72:543:284:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and high repos actually lend more than did lenders with high NPLS and low repos, although the 
30:716:63465:27:38:72:394:257:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:difference is statistically significant in some time periods only.

30:720:63579:38:27:72:542:106:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Finally, we attempt to estimate fed funds market demand by estimating the pre-crisis relationship 
30:721:63677:27:0:72:545:79:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:between  fed  funds  borrowing,  borrower  characteristics  and  macroeconomic  variables.  We  use  
31:722:63781:0:27:72:544:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the  estimates  from  the  pre-crisis  specification  to  predict  post-crisis  demand.  We  then  calculate  
31:723:63891:27:28:72:545:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the  difference  between  predicted  demand  and  actual  borrowing.  Of  course,  this  methodology  
31:724:63993:28:27:71:543:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:assumes that the estimated pre-crisis relationships are similar to post-crisis relationships. While 
31:725:64093:27:28:71:547:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:this  may  not  be  the  case,  predicted  demand  based  on  pre-crisis  correlations  remains  an  
31:726:64194:28:37:71:205:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:interesting counterfactual.   
31:727:64224:37:28:71:545:561:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:TABLE XI  presents  the  results  from  the  pre-crisis  estimation  (January  1,  2007  to  August  29,  
31:728:64330:28:28:72:543:533:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:2008). We estimate an OLS model of the relationship between the log of amount borrowed and 
31:729:64421:28:27:72:545:505:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the  following  bank  characteristics:  Daily:  log  of  average  amount  borrowed  in  the  previous  
31:730:64524:27:28:72:544:478:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:month,  log  of  customer  funds  sent,  log  of  customer  funds  received,  difference  between  reserve

31:732:64743:28:27:72:543:422:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:databases); Quarterly: assets, ROA, risk ratio, % NPL, % MBS, % Repos (from the Y-9C). We 
31:733:64833:27:28:72:543:395:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:also include the following daily macroeconomic variables: target fed funds rate, one month term 
31:734:64929:28:27:72:543:367:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:rates on: AA asset-backed commercial paper, certificates of deposit, financial commercial paper, 
31:735:65026:27:28:72:543:340:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:LIBOR and OIS, overnight rates on treasury repos and MBS repos. In addition, we allow fixed 
31:736:65118:28:28:72:543:312:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:effects for end of maintenance period days, calendar months and quarter end dates, and estimate 
31:737:65214:28:27:72:544:284:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the  model  separately  for  small  and  large  banks.  We  explain  more  than  60%  of  the  variation  in  
31:738:65324:27:38:72:267:257:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:amount borrowed with these variables.   
31:739:65364:38:27:72:545:219:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:We  create  a  variable  “forecast  error”  which  is  the  difference  between  actual  borrowing  and  
31:740:65469:27:28:72:544:192:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:predicted  borrowing  and  then  see  if  bank  characteristics  are  associated  with  actual  borrowing  
31:741:65576:28:28:72:542:164:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:being significantly below predicted borrowing. In TABLE XII we replicate the analysis in the first 
31:742:65674:28:27:72:544:136:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:four  columns  of  TABLE VI  replacing  as  the  dependent  variable  “forecast  error.”  When  forecast  
31:743:65780:27:28:72:543:109:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:error is high, predicted borrowing is higher than actual borrowing, suggesting the possibility of 
31:744:65878:28:0:72:547:81:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:unmet  demand.  As  expected,  predicted  borrowing  is  much  higher  than  actual  borrowing  
32:745:65977:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:immediately following the Lehman’s bankruptcy, especially for smaller banks. After September 
32:746:66070:27:28:72:544:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:17th,  predicted  values  are  much  higher  than  actual  values  for  the  largest  banks,  while  smaller  
32:747:66180:28:27:72:544:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:banks  continue  to  borrow  more  than  the  pre-crisis  relationships  would  predict.  Most  of  that  
32:748:66286:27:28:72:545:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:difference  is  driven  by  bank  characteristics,  since  the  difference  between  smaller  and  larger  
32:749:66393:28:28:72:546:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:banks  is  no  longer  statistically  significant  once  measures  of  quality  are  added.  Post-crisis  
32:750:66499:28:27:72:545:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:borrowing  shortfalls  are  associated  with  low  quality  banks  (high  NPLs)  experiencing  higher  
32:751:66602:27:38:72:345:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:shortfalls (see specifications (3) and (4) of TABLE XII).

32:755:66703:37:28:72:545:393:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:This  research  presents  a  first  detailed  look  at  the  events  in  the  fed  funds  market  in  the  2008  
32:756:66816:28:28:72:544:365:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:financial crisis. In the immediate aftermath of the Lehman’s  bankruptcy  we  see  that  the  market  
32:757:66918:28:27:71:545:337:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:seems  to  become  sensitive  to  bank  specific  characteristics,  not  only  in  the  amounts  lent  to  
32:758:67025:27:28:71:543:310:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:borrowers but even in the cost of funds. We see sharp differences between large and small banks 
32:759:67121:28:28:71:544:282:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:in  their  access  to  credit:  Large  banks  show  reduced  amounts  of  daily  borrowing  after  Lehman  
32:760:67228:28:27:71:543:254:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and  borrow  from  fewer  counterparties.  In  fact,  the  interest  rate  spread  at  which  large  banks  are  
32:761:67341:27:28:71:543:227:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:borrowing in the fed funds market after Lehman goes down. Assuming that in the very short-run 
32:762:67435:28:27:71:542:199:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:banks do not change their demand for liquidity, this is likely to be an effect of credit rationing. In 
32:763:67538:27:28:71:544:172:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:contrast,  smaller  banks  were  able  to  increase  the  amount  borrowed  from  the  interbank  market  
32:764:67644:28:28:71:543:144:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and even managed to add lending counterparties during the crisis. We do not find evidence of a 
32:765:67739:28:27:71:544:116:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:complete  cessation  of  lending  predicted  by  some  theoretical  models,  nor  do  we  find  evidence  
32:766:67845:27:0:71:450:89:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that riskier lenders are more likely to hoard liquidity at the height of the crisis. 
33:767:67933:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:We also see that only the worst performing banks in terms of ROA started accessing the Federal 
33:768:68028:27:28:72:544:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Reserve’s  discount  window  after  the  Lehman’s  bankruptcy.  It  seems  reasonable  to  assume  that  
33:769:68133:28:27:72:543:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:these are banks which were rationed by the fed funds market since private banks were not willing 
33:770:68230:27:28:72:544:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:to  lend  to  them.  While  again  it  is  difficult  to  assess  whether  this  means  that  interbank  markets  
33:771:68344:28:28:72:545:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:operated  efficiently  after  the  crisis,  it  is,  however,  reassuring  that  we  do  not  observe  well  
33:772:68453:28:27:71:543:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:performing banks having to turn to the discount window. This would have been a very alarming 
33:773:68546:27:38:71:315:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:indication of dysfunction in the fed funds market.  
33:774:68598:38:27:71:543:505:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:This research is only a first step in understanding how the fed funds market has been affected by 
33:775:68696:27:28:71:543:478:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the financial crisis and how robust this market is against financial contagion. It will be important 
33:776:68797:28:28:71:543:450:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:in future research to investigate more directly how lenders in the market reacted to the change in 
33:777:68896:28:27:71:543:422:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the  perception  of  bank  risk.  We  need  to  understand  much  better  how  fed  fund  loans  are  priced  
33:778:69006:27:28:71:543:395:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and how they are affected by expectations about government and central bank interventions. The 
33:779:69101:28:27:71:546:367:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:same  is  true  for  the  decision  on  the  extensive  margin,  e.g.  the  decision  to  add  or  drop  
33:780:69206:27:28:71:546:340:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:counterparties.  Finally  we  believe  that  it  is  important  to  investigate  the  role  that  banking  
33:781:69313:28:28:71:543:312:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:relationships and repeat interactions in the fed funds market can play in improved monitoring of 
33:782:69410:28:36:71:435:284:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:counterparty risks or as a vehicle to provide coinsurance of liquidity needs.
