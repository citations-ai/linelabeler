2:28:1356:28:14:72:545:588:12:Times:12:g_d0_f1:Fertility rates have long been falling in many developed countries while educational attainment in 
2:29:1454:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:these countries has risen.  We attempt to reconcile these two trends with a novel application of a 
2:30:1553:14:14:72:548:560:12:Times:12:Times:recent model  to  generate  plausibly  causal  effects  of  education  on  these  decreases  in  fertility.  
2:31:1661:14:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:Specifically, we  find  that  education  “compresses”  the  fertility  distribution  –  women  are  more 
2:32:1765:14:14:72:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:likely  to  have  at  least one  child,  but  less  likely  to  have  multiple  children.    We  demonstrate  that 
2:33:1879:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:the  mechanism  for  this  effect is  through  the  positive  impact  of  education  on  earnings  and 
2:34:1981:14:42:72:118:504:12:Times:12:Times:marriage.

3:50:2264:0:28:72:147:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:I.  Introduction 
3:51:2281:28:28:108:527:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Both birth rates and female educational attainment have changed dramatically over the 
3:52:2367:28:27:72:538:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:past half-century.  In many developed countries between 1960 and 2010, total fertility rates have 
3:53:2465:27:28:72:529:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fallen by one-third to over one-half.1  Over the same period, female educational attainment has 
3:54:2561:28:27:72:520:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:significantly increased.  In the United States, for example, the fraction of women aged 25-29 
3:55:2655:27:28:72:510:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with at least a bachelor’s degree increased threefold—from roughly 12 percent to about 35 
3:56:2745:28:28:72:534:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:percent.  In addition to these trends, there are large differences in total fertility across women of 
3:57:2847:28:27:72:523:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:different education levels.  Fertility among American women aged 40 to 50 years old in 2012 
3:58:2939:27:28:72:519:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:varied substantially by educational attainment—from about 2.6 for those with less than a HS 
3:59:3031:28:27:72:516:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:degree to about 1.8 for women with a bachelor’s degree and 1.7 for those with a graduate or 
3:60:3123:27:28:72:519:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:professional degree.  Moreover, while just less than 12 percent of those with less than a high 
3:61:3218:28:28:72:509:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:school degree were childless, nearly one-quarter of women with a graduate or professional 
3:62:3308:28:27:72:548:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:degree had no children when surveyed.  Such descriptive evidence, coupled with    conceptually 
3:63:3403:27:28:72:541:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:plausible mechanisms, suggests there may be a causal relationship between female education and 
3:64:3498:28:27:72:154:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:lifetime fertility. 
3:65:3518:27:28:108:537:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Despite these suggestive trends, and a long standing interest by economists in the impact 
3:66:3608:28:28:72:489:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of schooling on fertility, there exist relatively few studies that credibly estimate causal 
3:67:3700:28:27:72:512:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:relationships, particularly with data from the developed world.  In this paper, we attempt to 
3:68:3794:27:28:72:527:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:estimate the causal impact of education on lifetime fertility, which we define as the number of 
3:69:3890:28:27:72:525:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:children a woman gives birth to by age forty.  After reviewing the most relevant literature, we 
3:70:3986:27:21:72:500:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:present a model of fertility, based on a standard child quantity-quality framework, which 
3:71:4076:21:8:72:218:136:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:                                                           
3:72:4134:8:17:72:538:128:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:1In the United States, total fertility decreased from about 3.5 children per woman in 1960 to roughly 2.0 children in 
3:73:4252:17:12:72:533:111:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f3:2010, while Canada saw a decline in total fertility from 3.9 children in 1960 to 1.6 in 2010.  In England and Wales, 
3:74:4369:12:13:72:540:99:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the comparable rates are 2.7 in 1960 and 1.9 in 2010; in Ireland, 3.8 in 1960 and 2.1 in 2010; in Finland, 2.7 in 1960 
3:75:4488:13:12:72:538:86:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and 1.9 in 2010; in the Netherlands, 3.1 in 1960 and 1.8 in 2010; in Italy, 2.4 in 1960 and 1.5 in 2010; in France, 2.9 
3:76:4608:12:0:72:340:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:in 1960 and 2.0 in 2010; in Germany, 2.4 in 1960 and 1.4 in 2010.  
4:77:4673:0:28:72:545:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:demonstrates that education may affect fertility differentially on extensive and intensive margins.  
4:78:4774:28:28:72:532:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In other words, the model shows that education may have different impacts on the probability a 
4:79:4869:28:27:72:497:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:woman has any children (i.e., the extensive margin) and the number of children she has, 
4:80:4957:27:28:72:539:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:conditional on having children (i.e., the intensive margin) that work through changes in the price 
4:81:5056:28:27:72:246:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of child quantity and child quality.   
4:82:5095:27:28:108:542:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We test this model using multiple waves of the Canadian Census.  More precisely, we use 
4:83:5183:28:28:72:536:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:quasi-experimental variation in compulsory schooling laws (CSLs) to identify the causal impact 
4:84:5278:28:27:72:535:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of education on each fertility margin separately.  We find evidence that education “compresses” 
4:85:5374:27:28:72:509:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fertility.  That is, we find an extra year of CSL-induced schooling decreases the number of 
4:86:5466:28:27:72:526:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:children a given woman has, but increases the probability that a woman has any children.  We 
4:87:5559:27:28:72:537:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:also find that additional CSL-induced schooling leads to a greater likelihood of marriage as well 
4:88:5657:28:28:72:514:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:as higher earnings for women.  While the latter are interesting findings independent of their 
4:89:5751:28:27:72:541:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:connection to lifetime fertility, we argue they are consistent with the compressive fertility pattern 
4:90:5853:27:28:72:533:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:we observe.  In particular, increased marriage should reduce the price of child quality which, in 
4:91:5951:28:27:72:515:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:turn, should decrease the likelihood of childlessness, while reducing the number of children 
4:92:6044:27:28:72:211:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:along the intensive margin.   
4:93:6073:28:28:108:474:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Our estimates are robust along many dimensions including several different 
4:94:6148:28:27:72:531:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:parameterizations of our compulsory schooling instrument, as well as robust to the inclusion of 
4:95:6244:27:28:72:489:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:school quality measures and region-specific trends that address a recent critique of the 
4:96:6333:28:27:72:540:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:compulsory schooling literature by Stephens and Yang (2014).  Our results contribute to a small, 
4:97:6430:27:28:72:532:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:but growing literature that uses quasi-experimental variation in education to examine important 
4:98:6526:28:0:72:259:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:socioeconomic outcomes like fertility. 
5:99:6565:0:28:108:538:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In what follows, we provide background information on Canadian compulsory schooling 
5:100:6649:28:28:72:533:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:laws, discuss related studies and the present our theoretical model which draws substantially on 
5:101:6746:28:27:72:528:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Galor (2012) and Aaronson, Lange and Mazumder (2015).  In Section 3, we describe our data, 
5:102:6837:27:28:72:536:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:focusing on key definitions and also the relevant history of minimum school leaving ages which 
5:103:6932:28:27:72:511:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:provide the variation which we use to identify the impact of schooling on lifetime fertility.  
5:104:7027:27:28:72:534:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Section 4 presents our empirical strategy which involves instrumental variables estimation.  We 
5:105:7123:28:28:72:511:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:also discuss important issues regarding appropriate variance estimation when there are few 
5:106:7214:28:27:72:533:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sources of independent variation: since minimum school leaving ages are province-specific and 
5:107:7308:27:28:72:538:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:since there are only ten Canadian provinces we implement the Wild Cluster Bootstrap procedure 
5:108:7402:28:27:72:542:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:described in Cameron and Miller (2015).  Section 5 presents our findings.  As noted, we find that 
5:109:7500:27:28:72:528:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:additional schooling has a “compressive” effect on lifetime fertility, reducing the likelihood of 
5:110:7598:28:28:72:524:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:childlessness while reducing the number of children a woman has conditional on having any.  
5:111:7690:28:27:72:458:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Section 6 discusses our findings and their implications and concludes the paper. 
5:112:7771:27:28:72:148:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:II. Background 
5:113:7786:28:27:72:277:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A. Canadian Compulsory Schooling Laws 
5:114:7824:27:28:108:530:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Compulsory schooling laws have existed in North America for well over a century.  As 
5:115:7909:28:28:72:523:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:detailed below, their historical development in Canada and the United States is quite similar.  
5:116:8005:28:27:72:520:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Other key similarities between the Canadian and U.S. educational systems include education 
5:117:8096:27:28:72:530:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:being a function of state/provincial governments that is delivered by local governments as well 
5:118:8192:28:27:72:527:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:as the use of similar, most often local, funding mechanisms in the relevant time periods (Katz, 
5:119:8288:27:28:72:529:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:1976).  In what follows, we briefly describe the history of CSLs in Canada drawing heavily on 
5:120:8382:28:28:72:508:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:existing research (Phillips, 1957; Axelrod, 1997; Oreopoulos, 2005).  We describe the law 
5:121:8472:28:0:72:433:101:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:changes we use for identification purposes in greater detail in Section 3.     
6:122:8551:0:28:108:528:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:As in the United States, compulsory schooling laws in Canada were first enacted in the 
6:123:8638:28:28:72:527:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:latter part of the 19th Century (Katz, 1976).  Early versions of these laws were subject to many 
6:124:8735:28:27:72:533:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:exemptions, most often based on the age of children, their necessity in supporting their families 
6:125:8833:27:28:72:539:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and distance lived from school.  These laws, however, became more binding over time as the list 
6:126:8929:28:27:72:516:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of exemptions narrowed.  Though an early adopter, the province of Ontario provides a good 
6:127:9019:27:28:72:537:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:example of the typical evolution of CSLs in Canada.  In 1871, Ontario became the first province 
6:128:9115:28:28:72:542:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in Canada to enact a compulsory schooling law, requiring children aged seven to twelve to attend 
6:129:9212:28:27:72:528:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:school for at least four months per year.2  Two decades later these ages were raised to between 
6:130:9308:27:28:72:534:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:eight and fourteen, and legislation introduced penalties for non-compliance as well as for hiring 
6:131:9406:28:27:72:538:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:school-aged children, though some exemptions remained.  For example, children under ten were 
6:132:9499:27:28:72:539:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:exempted if they lived more than 2 miles from school while children ten and over were similarly 
6:133:9595:28:28:72:543:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:exempted if they lived more than 3 miles away.  Moreover, there was lax enforcement of the law, 
6:134:9691:28:27:72:534:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:particularly in rural areas.3  By the mid-1950s, the Schools Administration Act raised the age of 
6:135:9789:27:28:72:518:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:school attendance to sixteen for all students in Ontario, though farm children over the age of 
6:136:9884:28:27:72:514:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fourteen were exempted as were children who were deemed to be essential to their family’s 
6:137:9974:27:28:72:538:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:subsistence.  Similar to other Canadian provinces, even these exemptions were lifted in the early 
6:138:10072:28:28:72:503:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:1970s, which is also consistent with many U.S. states (Katz, 1976).  More recently, some 
6:139:10161:28:27:72:528:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Canadian provinces have further increased the age of compulsory attendance: New Brunswick 
6:140:10251:27:22:72:537:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:raised it to eighteen in 2000, as did Ontario in 2007 and Manitoba in 2011.  Again, note that this 
6:141:10350:22:8:72:218:190:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:                                                           
6:142:10408:8:16:72:536:182:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:2 CSLs appeared in British Columbia shortly afterward in 1873 with most Canadian provinces enacting them by the 
6:143:10520:16:7:72:233:166:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:end of the first decade of 20th Century.   
6:144:10562:7:16:72:533:159:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:3 The deference shown to rural areas, mostly based on their agrarian nature and extensive use of child labor, is also 
6:145:10680:16:12:72:511:143:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:apparent in the Adolescent School Attendance Act of 1921 whereby Ontario increased the compulsory age of 
6:146:10785:12:11:72:500:131:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:attendance from fourteen to sixteen years old, but only for young adults living in urban areas.  Perhaps not 
6:147:10894:11:12:72:526:120:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:surprisingly, newly required fourteen and fifteen year olds were exempted from the law if they were employed at 
6:148:11006:12:11:72:521:108:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:home or for wages and if they possessed a parent-endorsed “certificate of employment”, which exempted youth 
6:149:11114:11:12:72:539:97:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:from minimum school leaving laws, were often obtained by passing equivalency tests, typically at the level of grade 
6:150:11230:12:11:72:527:85:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:7 or 8, but sometimes merely tested basic skills like reading or writing.  These young adults were still required to 
6:151:11347:11:0:72:364:74:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f3:attend part-time instruction in the evenings, where such classes existed.   
7:152:11422:0:28:72:540:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:broad overview does not explicitly discuss the law changes we use in our analysis; instead we do 
7:153:11519:28:28:72:156:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:this in Section 3. 
7:154:11538:28:27:72:172:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B. Literature review 
7:155:11559:27:28:72:542:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: The literature on the relationship between family size and economic circumstances begins 
7:156:11648:28:27:72:522:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with the work of Becker (1960, 1965), which proposed an analysis of fertility based upon the 
7:157:11741:27:28:72:529:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:view of children as durable goods, and documented a negative relationship between household 
7:158:11833:28:28:72:519:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:income and the number of children produced within a household.  Becker and Lewis (1973), 
7:159:11922:28:27:72:528:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Willis (1973) and Becker and Tomes (1976) further analyzed this phenomenon by proposing a 
7:160:12012:27:28:72:525:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fundamental trade-off between the quantity and quality of children produced within a family.  
7:161:12106:28:28:72:523:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Generally, models in these papers postulate that household utility,         , is a function of 
7:162:12201:28:28:72:534:432:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:three goods: n represents the number of children, w represents the quality of each child, and y is 
7:163:12300:28:29:72:518:404:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:an aggregate of all other goods.  The budget constraint within the model is:           , 
7:164:12387:29:28:72:544:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:where py represents the price of the aggregate good, p is the price of nw, and I represents income.  
7:165:12487:28:27:72:530:347:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The optimal choices in n and w reveal that there exists a trade-off between these two goods: an 
7:166:12583:27:28:72:352:320:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:increase in n raises the shadow price of w, and vice versa. 
7:167:12643:28:27:108:542:292:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The quantity-quality model has been empirically tested in a large set of papers, which can 
7:168:12734:27:28:72:534:265:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:be broadly classified into two groups.  The first group of papers relate changes in child quantity 
7:169:12833:28:28:72:531:237:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to parental investment in their children’s education, which is deemed to improve child quality.  
7:170:12930:28:27:72:527:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Within this first group of papers, the evidence for a trade-off between quantity and quality has 
7:171:13027:27:28:72:535:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:been mixed.  One subset of these papers has found a negative relationship between child quality 
7:172:13123:28:27:72:522:154:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and quantity (c.f., Rosenzweig and Wolpin, 1980; Rosenzweig and Schultz, 1987; Hanushek, 
7:173:13212:27:28:72:529:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:1992; Caceres (2006); Lee (2008); Li, Zhang and Zhu, 2008); Rosenzweig and Wolpin, 2009), 
7:174:13302:28:0:72:507:99:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:while a different subset finds less evidence for such a trade-off (c.f., Kessler, 1991; Black, 
8:175:13396:0:28:72:497:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Devereux and Salvanes, 2005; Angrist, Levy and Schlosser, 2010; Black, Devereux and 
8:176:13480:28:28:72:315:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Salvanes, 2010; Lucas, 2013; Qian, forthcoming). 
8:177:13529:28:27:108:532:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In the second group of papers, which is more relevant to our work, the central empirical 
8:178:13618:27:28:72:523:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:strategy for analyzing the quantity-quality trade-off hinged on factors that change the shadow 
8:179:13713:28:27:72:513:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:prices of children (as opposed to the quantity of children).  Many of these papers have used 
8:180:13806:27:28:72:537:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:historical data, and unlike the first set of papers, exhibit a greater consensus on the presence of a 
8:181:13908:28:28:72:535:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:quantity-quality trade-off.  Becker et. al. (2010) use nineteenth-century Prussian data and use an 
8:182:14007:28:27:72:528:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:IV strategy for educational attainment in order to create variation in the price of education (the 
8:183:14106:27:28:72:535:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:price of quality) and fertility, and they demonstrate that there is a negative causal relationship in 
8:184:14208:28:27:72:521:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:this regard.  Schultz (1985) uses historical Swedish data to examine a plausible change in the 
8:185:14303:27:28:72:515:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:relative value of women’s time in the labor market due to a change in the price of the goods 
8:186:14396:28:28:72:507:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:produced by women and men.  His IV strategy shows that the increased valuation of labor 
8:187:14484:28:27:72:518:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:market time reduces fertility, which is consistent with the quantity-quality model because an 
8:188:14578:27:28:72:504:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:increase in the opportunity cost of women’s time will increase the price of the quantity of 
8:189:14670:28:27:72:497:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:children produced within the family.4  Bleakley and Lange (2009) use the eradication of 
8:190:14758:27:28:72:541:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:hookworm disease at the beginning of the twentieth century as a plausibly exogenous decrease in 
8:191:14854:28:28:72:533:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the price of quality of children.  They argue that the eradication of hookworm raised the returns 
8:192:14952:28:27:72:539:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to education for children who could, absent this disease, obtain higher education more easily and 
8:193:15050:27:28:72:504:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:improve the retention of training from education.   As the quantity-quality tradeoff would 
8:194:15141:28:61:72:505:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:predict, a decrease in the price of quality should induce greater consumption of quality by 
8:195:15233:61:8:72:218:123:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:                                                           
8:196:15291:8:17:72:514:115:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:4 Becker et. al. (1990) develop a theoretical model to demonstrate that, in the context of economic growth and 
8:197:15401:17:12:72:524:98:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:development, increased investment in educational attainment may lead to an equilibrium with smaller families – 
8:198:15512:12:12:72:299:86:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:directly in accordance with the quantity-quality model.   
8:199:15570:12:0:72:74:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3: 
9:200:15570:0:28:72:513:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:parents; the resulting increase in the quality will raise the price of quantity and thus cause a 
9:201:15667:28:28:72:213:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:decrease in overall fertility.   
9:202:15700:28:27:108:509:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A paper that uses more recent data is a study by McCrary and Royer (2011), which 
9:203:15780:27:28:72:514:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:examines the relationship between maternal education and fertility, in the context of a more 
9:204:15873:28:27:72:541:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:prominent focus on child health.  Using data from California and Texas, these authors implement 
9:205:15969:27:28:72:533:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a regression discontinuity strategy based on compulsory schooling laws (CSL).  They find little 
9:206:16065:28:28:72:519:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:evidence of a relationship between increases in CSL-induced education and fertility.5  While 
9:207:16158:28:27:72:525:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:their data are very appropriate for examining the relationship between maternal education and 
9:208:16252:27:28:72:542:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:child health, they are more limited in examining fertility since they use natality data which, by its 
9:209:16354:28:27:72:393:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:nature, is comprised solely of those females who have given birth. 
9:210:16421:27:28:72:120:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:C. Model 
9:211:16430:28:28:72:503:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: The most relevant papers to this study are Galor (2012) and Aaronson, Lange and 
9:212:16510:28:27:72:516:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Mazumder (2014) (hereafter ALM).  Galor (2012) provides the theoretical underpinning for 
9:213:16599:27:28:72:536:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ALM to analyze the construction of Rosenwald schools in the U.S. south at the beginning of the 
9:214:16694:28:27:72:544:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:twentieth century.  These two papers use a quantity-quality framework with a few small changes.  
9:215:16791:27:28:72:532:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Specifically, the household maximizes its preferences based upon the following utility function 
9:216:16887:28:28:72:333:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with three arguments subject to the budget constraint: 
9:217:16942:28:28:202:412:239:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f2:                                
9:218:16964:28:27:72:537:211:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In this case, c represents goods and services consumed, n represents the number of children, and 
9:219:17060:27:28:72:502:184:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f2:e is the investment in the quality of the n children.  The household can spend at most I in 
9:220:17152:28:28:72:538:156:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:household income on c, and the e amount of quality for all n children.  Unlike the earlier models 
9:221:17250:28:30:72:524:128:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in this literature, there are two prices that need to be paid in this process:    is a fixed cost for 
9:222:17350:30:8:72:218:98:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:                                                           
9:223:17408:8:16:72:530:90:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:5 McCrary and Royer (2011) also find no relationship between such education and child health, which again is the 
9:224:17521:16:0:72:154:74:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:focus of their study. 
10:225:17542:0:27:72:526:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:raising children (and it is independent of the investments made into the children) and    is the 
10:226:17637:27:28:72:279:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cost of investing in the quality of children. 
10:227:17683:28:28:72:522:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: The interior solution for this problem is denoted by        , and the shadow prices of 
10:228:17767:28:28:72:192:625:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:quantity and quality are: 
10:229:17793:28:28:267:347:597:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f2:           
10:230:17797:28:28:280:334:569:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f2:        
10:231:17799:28:28:72:510:541:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:As was the case with the earlier models in this literature, these shadow prices still lead to a 
10:232:17895:28:28:72:199:513:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:quantity-quality tradeoff:  
10:233:17923:28:27:72:535:485:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(1) There is a positive relationship between    and   , which implies that increased investments 
10:234:18015:27:28:72:525:458:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in the quality of children (e) will raise the shadow price of having more children.  As such, an 
10:235:18112:28:28:72:511:430:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:increase in the investment in child quality will tend to reduce the number of children in the 
10:236:18206:28:28:72:127:402:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:household. 
10:237:18217:28:27:72:542:374:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(2) There is a positive relationship between    and   , which implies that additional children will 
10:238:18313:27:28:72:516:347:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:raise the shadow price of investment in child quality.  As such, an increase in the number of 
10:239:18407:28:28:72:485:319:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:children in the household will tend to reduce investment in children in the household. 
10:240:18494:28:27:72:535:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:For the purpose of later exposition, it should be noted that this component of the model governs 
10:241:18591:27:28:72:331:264:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the decision-making process for the intensive margin. 
10:242:18644:28:27:108:533:236:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The key insight from ALM is that the fertility literature (including Galor) often imposes 
10:243:18734:27:28:72:542:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the Inada condition, which obscures the quantity-quality trade-off, because it requires households 
10:244:18833:28:28:72:513:181:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to have at least one child.  That is: the model considers the intensive margin (the number of 
10:245:18927:28:27:72:536:153:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:children in a family, conditional on having at least one child), but ignores the extensive margin.  
10:246:19027:27:28:72:508:126:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:To better understand the extensive margin, it is necessary to consider the relative utility of 
10:247:19122:28:0:72:499:98:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:having no children in the context of this model, and how it compares to the case where a 
11:248:19211:0:28:72:528:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:household has children.   Let the value of remaining childless be captured by      , and let the 
11:249:19306:28:28:72:526:680:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:value of having the optimal non-zero number of children be represented by            – note 
11:250:19395:28:28:72:508:652:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that this value is negatively related to the two prices    and   .  In this case, a woman will 
11:251:19486:28:28:72:361:624:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:choose to have children if            is larger than      .   
11:252:19542:28:27:90:539:596:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Within the context of this discussion, it is instructive to consider how changes in the model’s 
11:253:19638:27:28:72:532:569:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:parameters will impact both the intensive and extensive margins for fertility.  In this case, there 
11:254:19738:28:28:72:200:541:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:are two effects of interest: 
11:255:19767:28:28:90:542:513:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(i) If    decreases, then            will increase, while       will remain constant.  This 
11:256:19851:28:28:126:542:485:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:will make it more likely that a woman has at least one child – that is, a woman will be 
11:257:19939:28:28:126:519:457:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:less likely to be childless given this change.  Thus, a decrease in    has a positive 
11:258:20023:28:27:126:535:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:effect on the extensive margin of fertility.  However, the fall in this price will induce 
11:259:20113:27:28:126:530:402:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a substitution effect between e and n: e will increase, and n will decrease – this will 
11:260:20201:28:28:126:537:374:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cause a negative effect on the intensive margin for fertility.  Overall, then, a decrease 
11:261:20291:28:27:126:534:346:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in    will compress fertility decisions for women: they will be more likely to have at 
11:262:20375:27:28:126:449:319:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:least one child, but also more likely to have fewer children overall. 
11:263:20445:28:29:90:537:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(ii) If    increases, then            will decrease, and this will decrease fertility on both 
11:264:20533:29:28:126:509:262:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the intensive and extensive margins.  An increase in    makes it less likely that 
11:265:20613:28:28:126:526:234:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f2:           will be larger than       (which remains constant as    increases), and 
11:266:20688:28:35:126:504:206:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the substitution effect will induce a decrease in n in favour of an increase in e. 
11:267:20771:35:28:90:537:171:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Having established points (i) and (ii), it is now possible to consider how changes in different 
11:268:20867:28:28:72:511:143:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:characteristics of women impact their fertility decisions.  Typically, it has been argued that 
11:269:20962:28:28:72:513:115:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:improvements in labour market opportunities for women represent an increase in   , which 
11:270:21049:28:0:72:515:87:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:should decrease fertility on both the intensive and extensive margins.  One of the most well-
12:271:21142:0:28:72:530:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:recognized instances of improved labour market opportunities would come from an increase in 
12:272:21234:28:28:72:535:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:educational attainment – or an improvement in the quality of educational training – for women.  
12:273:21330:28:28:72:526:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ALM also argue that an increase in the quality of schooling should reduce   , since it is easier 
12:274:21425:28:27:72:437:625:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for parents to produce higher-quality children with access to better schools. 
12:275:21503:27:28:90:537:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:With these notions in hand, ALM consider how access to Rosenwald schools altered fertility 
12:276:21594:28:27:72:523:570:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for two cohorts of African-American women in the southern U.S.: the cohort of children who 
12:277:21685:27:28:72:532:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:had varying degrees of access to the Rosenwald schools, and their parents (who were too old to 
12:278:21780:28:28:72:538:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:access the schools).  ALM argue that the construction of the Rosenwald schools should decrease 
12:279:21875:28:28:72:542:487:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f2:   for the parents since their children now have access to higher-quality schools.  However, since 
12:280:21971:28:28:72:539:459:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the parents’ education remains unaffected by the construction of these schools,    should remain 
12:281:22066:28:28:72:539:431:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:constant.  In contrast, the Rosenwald schools should decrease    and increase    for the children 
12:282:22160:28:28:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:who had access to these schools, since their labor market opportunities have improved as a result 
12:283:22258:28:27:72:504:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of these schools (as documented by Aaronson and Mazumder (2011)).  By comparing the 
12:284:22342:27:28:72:531:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fertility patterns of the children who either did or did not have access to the Rosenwald schools 
12:285:22440:28:28:72:508:320:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with the fertility parents of their parents, ALM demonstrate that the schools “compressed” 
12:286:22531:28:27:72:534:292:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fertility: children educated in the Rosenwald schools were more likely to have at least one child 
12:287:22629:27:28:72:520:265:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:compared to their parents, but (conditional on having at least one child) less likely to have as 
12:288:22726:28:27:72:507:237:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:many children as their parents.  The Rosenwald schools generated opposing effects on the 
12:289:22815:27:28:72:498:210:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:extensive and intensive margins of fertility, as predicted by the Galor and ALM models. 
12:290:22903:28:28:108:535:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This paper contributes to the relevant literature in several ways.  First, modern data from 
12:291:22995:28:27:72:536:154:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a developed country, and not historical data or data from a developing country, will be analyzed 
12:292:23092:27:28:72:506:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in conjunction with a policy change that is similar in spirit to ALM: increased educational 
12:293:23184:28:0:72:523:99:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:attainment for women due to changes in compulsory schooling laws.  Although it has already 
13:294:23275:0:27:72:528:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:been argued that a change in CSLs would raise   , this paper’s second contribution will be the 
13:295:23368:27:28:72:526:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:documentation of this fact, while taking into account concerns about this effect that have been 
13:296:23464:28:28:72:537:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:raised by Stephens and Yang (2014) (hereafter SY).  In their study, SY find that the inclusion of 
13:297:23562:28:27:72:513:625:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:region-specific trends or measures of school quality effectively reduce to zero instrumental-
13:298:23655:27:28:72:516:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:variable estimates of the return to education for U.S. data.  These findings cast at least some 
13:299:23751:28:27:72:520:570:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:doubt on the conclusions of earlier work on CSL-induced increases in formal schooling.  We 
13:300:23842:27:28:72:502:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:address this critique by using Canadian data, while incorporating Canadian variables that 
13:301:23932:28:28:72:483:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:correspond to those used by SY.  As will be seen, our estimates—both first stage and 
13:302:24017:28:28:72:528:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:structural—are robust to their inclusion, thus providing validation for the empirical strategy of 
13:303:24115:28:27:72:390:459:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:using CSL-induced changes in education to study increases in   . 
13:304:24178:27:28:108:503:432:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A third contribution of this paper is evidence we will present on the way in which 
13:305:24261:28:28:72:505:404:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:changes in one’s own educational attainment may also impact   .  We will argue that that 
13:306:24348:28:28:72:507:376:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:increased educational attainment makes it more likely that a woman becomes and remains 
13:307:24435:28:28:72:526:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:married.  In turn, this will decrease    if, compared to a single parent, a married parent faces a 
13:308:24531:28:28:72:506:320:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:lower price of investment in the quality of her child(ren), due to a couple’s increased joint 
13:309:24625:28:27:72:527:292:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:monetary resources and greater flexibility in non-work time, which increases the total parental 
13:310:24721:27:28:72:517:265:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:time which can be allocated to raising children.  Indeed, existing research suggests that such 
13:311:24816:28:27:72:535:237:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:differences exist between married and unmarried families.  Kendig and Bianchi (2008) find that 
13:312:24911:27:28:72:537:210:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:single mothers tend to spend less time in child care than married mothers, including routine care 
13:313:25009:28:28:72:519:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:as well as care deemed more intensive such as playing with or reading to children.  Pencavel 
13:314:25102:28:27:72:533:154:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(1998) finds that as husband’s education increases, women’s labour supply decreases, implying 
13:315:25196:27:28:72:525:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:intra-couple coordination of time devoted to the raising of children.  In addition, single-parent 
13:316:25294:28:0:72:518:99:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:households exhibit relatively less involvement from the non-resident parent.  Bianchi (2011) 
14:317:25387:0:28:72:527:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:shows that offspring in mother-only households receive relatively less paternal child care; this 
14:318:25484:28:28:72:550:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:gap   has increased dramatically over the past decade, to roughly half of that spent by the father in 
14:319:25586:28:27:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:married households.  While non-resident fathers may routinely spend time with children (e.g., on 
14:320:25683:27:28:72:497:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:weekends), Cooksey and Fondell (1996) show that resident fathers, particularly resident 
14:321:25771:28:27:72:512:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:biological fathers, tend to spend more time in their children than non-resident ones.  To the 
14:322:25865:27:28:72:529:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:extent that investment in children is time-intensive, it follows that marriage reduces the cost of 
14:323:25964:28:28:72:146:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:such activities. 
14:324:25980:28:28:108:539:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Given this, we assert that an improvement in educational training of women will increase 
14:325:26069:28:27:72:536:487:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f2:   and decrease   .  Although both of these price changes will have an unambiguously negative 
14:326:26158:27:28:72:528:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:effect on the intensive margin of fertility, they will have counteracting effects on the extensive 
14:327:26257:28:28:72:520:432:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:margin of fertility.  It is possible, if the decrease in    is the dominant effect on the extensive 
14:328:26355:28:28:72:520:404:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:margin, that a change in educational training for women will have a “compressing” effect on 
14:329:26447:28:27:72:521:376:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:overall fertility – women will be more likely to have at least one child, but less likely to have 
14:330:26545:27:28:72:538:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:large families.  Overall, this analysis of Canadian data will take place in a manner that is entirely 
14:331:26647:28:27:72:429:321:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:new to the literature to demonstrate this compressing effect for education. 
14:332:26723:27:28:72:116:294:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:III. Data 
14:333:26733:28:28:108:554:266:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The    primary data for this study consist of women between the age of 40 and 65 from the 
14:334:26823:28:27:72:537:238:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:confidential6 extracts of the 1981 and 1991 decennial Canadian Censuses, which were necessary 
14:335:26917:27:28:72:543:211:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for a number of reasons.  First, in addition to the standard demographic variables, such as gender, 
14:336:27017:28:63:72:513:183:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:marital status, citizenship status and ethnicity, these extracts also contain information on an 
14:337:27113:63:7:72:218:120:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:                                                           
14:338:27171:7:16:72:533:113:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:6 The confidential data sets were only accessible through secure sites, and contain information not collected for the 
14:339:27289:16:12:72:493:97:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:publicly-available extracts of the decennial censuses.  In particular, the confidential files contain specific 
14:340:27400:12:11:72:523:85:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:information about earnings in the prior year, as well as specific amounts of education obtained by the household 
14:341:27513:11:0:72:261:74:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:member and an individual’s exact date of birth 
15:342:27560:0:28:72:538:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:individual’s province7 of birth as well as their exact date of birth; both variables are necessary to 
15:343:27662:28:28:72:503:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:examine the relationship between changes in compulsory schooling laws and educational 
15:344:27748:28:27:72:537:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:attainment.   Second, they contain detailed labour market information.  The confidential extracts 
15:345:27846:27:28:72:537:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of the Census contain annual earnings from the prior year, as well as labour market participation 
15:346:27944:28:27:72:524:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and weeks worked in the prior year, which will be used to determine the relationship between 
15:347:28037:27:28:72:508:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:years of education and labour market performance.  Third, the Census asks a retrospective 
15:348:28127:28:28:72:517:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:question about fertility for all of its female respondents: what is the total number of children 
15:349:28224:28:27:72:517:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:you’ve had over your lifetime?  From this, it is possible to determine a woman’s cumulative 
15:350:28316:27:28:72:525:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:lifetime fertility.  All three sets of variables will permit a proper analysis of our adapted ALM 
15:351:28414:28:27:72:503:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:model: it will be possible to determine whether or not education is related to fertility, and 
15:352:28508:27:28:72:464:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:whether or not earnings and marital status are key mechanisms within this effect. 
15:353:28590:28:28:72:529:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: To give a sense of the data, Table 1 displays the sample means of a variety of variables 
15:354:28679:28:27:72:523:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for women in our sample with different levels of educational attainment: less than a grade six 
15:355:28774:27:28:72:536:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:education, educational attainment of grade seven or eight, some high school education (between 
15:356:28869:28:27:72:531:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:grade nine to eleven) or at least a high-school graduate’s level of education.  These subsamples 
15:357:28966:27:28:72:539:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:were chosen to demonstrate the relative fertility, relative earnings and marital patterns of women 
15:358:29065:28:28:72:532:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with different levels of education, especially over the levels of education that were impacted by 
15:359:29163:28:27:72:206:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the instrument we selected. 
15:360:29191:27:28:72:512:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: The first three rows of the table demonstrate well-documented facts about the cross-
15:361:29275:28:27:72:527:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sectional relationship between education and age, income and weeks worked.  In the first row, 
15:362:29369:27:28:72:534:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the monotonic decrease in average age as the educational attainment of the subsample increases 
15:363:29464:28:20:72:524:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:shows that younger cohorts of women have obtained relatively more education.  Of particular 
15:364:29556:20:8:72:218:109:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:                                                           
15:365:29614:8:16:72:541:101:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:7 A Canadian “province” is analogous to an American state.  There are ten provinces in Canada, and three territories; 
15:366:29732:16:11:72:498:85:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the sample analyzed within this study will include only data drawn from individuals born in one of the ten 
15:367:29839:11:0:72:115:74:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f3:provinces. 
16:368:29849:0:28:72:541:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:note for this study is the relationship between education and marital status.  The second and third 
16:369:29949:28:28:72:520:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rows show that the fraction of women currently married and the fraction who have ever been 
16:370:30040:28:27:72:529:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:married are increasing in educational attainment over the first three educational categories, but 
16:371:30138:27:28:72:503:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:decreases in the fourth column.  As will be demonstrated later, the instrument we employ 
16:372:30227:28:27:72:537:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:induces changes in educational attainment between the first three columns, but not in the fourth; 
16:373:30325:27:28:72:535:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:as such, over the range of education that is influenced by our instrument, education is positively 
16:374:30424:28:28:72:529:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:related to both the propensity of being currently married as well as the propensity to have been 
16:375:30521:28:27:72:180:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:married at some time. 
16:376:30543:27:28:72:536:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: Another notable relationship between educational attainment and total fertility is evident 
16:377:30634:28:27:72:525:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in the fourth and fifth rows of the table.  The fourth row demonstrates that the total number of 
16:378:30731:27:28:72:510:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:children to which a woman has given birth is negatively related to educational attainment.  
16:379:30823:28:28:72:493:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:However, the fifth row shows that over the range of education that is influenced by our 
16:380:30911:28:27:72:495:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:instrument (the first three columns of the table), there is a positive relationship between 
16:381:31003:27:28:72:538:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:educational attainment and the average proportion of women who have ever had a child.  Within 
16:382:31097:28:27:72:539:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the first three columns of these cross-tabulations, education has a compressing effect on fertility: 
16:383:31198:27:28:72:529:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:more education is related to a decrease in the total number of children to which a woman gives 
16:384:31293:28:28:72:403:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:birth, but an increase in the likelihood that she has at least one child. 
16:385:31367:28:27:108:495:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The last relationship of note is displayed in the last two rows of the table, which 
16:386:31451:27:28:72:498:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:document the average income and weeks worked for women across the four educational 
16:387:31534:28:27:72:495:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:categories.  Since labour market attachment can decrease with age, these averages were 
16:388:31621:27:28:72:533:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:calculated for the same cohort in the first five rows, but ten years earlier (during prime working 
16:389:31720:28:28:72:537:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:years): the sample used to compute these averages consist of women between the ages of 30 and 
16:390:31814:28:0:72:511:101:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:55 from the 1971 and 1981 Canada Censuses.  The increase in average earnings and weeks 
17:391:31901:0:28:72:521:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:worked as education rises, as shown in the second and third rows, echoes a well-documented 
17:392:31992:28:28:72:541:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cross-sectional relationship.  These cross-sectional relationships will be explored in greater detail 
17:393:32094:28:27:72:538:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:as we move to an instrumental variables framework, but as a preliminary analysis, they establish 
17:394:32191:27:28:72:504:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that the data exhibit relatively standard patterns found in studies that analyze the effect of 
17:395:32286:28:27:72:303:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:education on different labour market outcomes. 
17:396:32333:27:28:72:512:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: This study will also incorporate another set of variables from outside of the Census, 
17:397:32419:28:28:72:533:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:which include information on school quality, by province over time.  In particular, we use three 
17:398:32516:28:27:72:522:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:different variables that measure different annual aspects of school quality: average per-capita 
17:399:32612:27:28:72:517:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:number of teachers in a province, annual per-capita spending on education by the provincial 
17:400:32704:28:27:72:503:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:government, and the annual per-capita number of schools in a province.  These data were 
17:401:32792:27:28:72:518:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:provided to us by Phil Oreopoulos, and the specifics about their collection and definition are 
17:402:32887:28:28:72:228:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:detailed in Oreopoulos (2006b). 
17:403:32918:28:27:108:528:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In addition to the variables available in the Census extracts and the variables on school 
17:404:33008:27:28:72:533:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:quality, it is important for the sake of the analysis to delineate the sample chosen for this work.  
17:405:33109:28:27:72:517:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In order to test the ALM model, it is necessary to assemble a sample of women whose child-
17:406:33199:27:28:72:535:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:bearing is completed at the time of the data collection.  Since younger women are relatively less 
17:407:33297:28:28:72:543:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:likely to have completed their child-bearing, the analysis focused on women who were at least 40 
17:408:33394:28:27:72:504:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:years of age at the time of the survey.  Although this is an arbitrary cut-off, vital statistics 
17:409:33491:27:28:72:535:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:indicate that only approximately 0.5% of 40-year-old women from the 1980 and 1990 Censuses 
17:410:33582:28:27:72:526:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:gave birth after the age of 40,8 and although the results are not reported in this paper, the main 
17:411:33681:27:71:72:507:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:conclusions presented from the analysis are not substantively different if the cut-off age is 
17:412:33775:71:8:72:218:86:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:                                                           
17:413:33833:8:0:72:405:78:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:8 http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/91-209-x/2013001/article/11784/c-g/fig04-eng.htm 
18:414:33913:0:28:72:530:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:raised.9 Finally, we limit the sample to women sixty-five years old and younger to avoid issues 
18:415:34009:28:28:72:522:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of differential mortality that might be attributed causally to increased educational attainment. 
18:416:34106:28:27:72:184:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:IV. Empirical Strategy 
18:417:34129:27:28:108:528:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Though descriptive, the evidence in Table 1 suggests that lower educational attainment 
18:418:34216:28:27:72:529:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:impacts lifetime fertility.  To more systematically investigate a relationship between schooling 
18:419:34313:27:29:72:333:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and lifetime fertility, we specify the following model: 
18:420:34369:29:28:166:448:542:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f2:                                       
18:421:34403:28:28:72:532:514:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Here, β is the coefficient of greatest interest, as it represents the relationship between schooling 
18:422:34503:28:28:72:533:486:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and fertility.  Unless otherwise noted, all variables are aggregated from individual-level Census 
18:423:34601:28:27:72:542:458:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:data by calculating means for each birth cohort b, in each province p, and for each Census extract 
18:424:34700:27:28:72:532:431:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f2:c.  The dependent variable (BIRTH) is either the proportion of women who have given birth to 
18:425:34793:28:27:72:531:403:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:at least one child by age forty (i.e., the extensive margin) or the average number of children for 
18:426:34892:27:28:72:536:376:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:those women who have given birth to at least one child by age forty (i.e., the intensive margin).  
18:427:34991:28:28:72:542:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:As described in the previous section, these variables as based on a question which asks women in 
18:428:35088:28:27:72:523:320:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the Census, “what is the total number of children you’ve had in your lifetime?”  Compared to 
18:429:35181:27:28:72:523:293:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:relying on household composition data, this information better addresses measurement issues 
18:430:35273:28:27:72:541:265:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:such as those that might be created by custody issues and child mortality, for example.  They key 
18:431:35371:27:29:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:independent variable (EDUC) is defined as the average number of years of education attained by 
18:432:35466:29:29:72:527:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sample women in each cohort-province-Census extract cell.  Control variables (    ) include: 
18:433:35558:29:27:72:515:180:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:age as well as its square, cube and quartic; controls for rural status, the percent employed in 
18:434:35654:27:28:72:513:153:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:manufacturing, married status, aboriginal status, and immigrant status; and fixed effects for 
18:435:35748:28:27:72:339:125:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:province of birth, year of birth and the census extract.   
18:436:35807:27:8:72:218:98:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:                                                           
18:437:35865:8:16:72:538:90:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:9 In particular, the analysis was replicated with a cut-off age of 42 and 44, and the results are essentially the same as 
18:438:35987:16:0:72:139:74:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f3:will be reported. 
19:439:36004:0:28:108:514:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Further, we seek to ensure that our estimates are not prone to the issues identified in 
19:440:36092:28:28:72:520:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:recent work by Stephens and Yang (2014) who found that the IV return to education was not 
19:441:36182:28:27:72:528:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:significantly different from zero when controls such as school quality specific to the U.S. state 
19:442:36280:27:28:72:514:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and year were included in the IV framework.  To address this, we include three variables to 
19:443:36372:28:27:72:536:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:account for school quality within each province and birth cohort: the annual per-capita spending 
19:444:36469:27:28:72:509:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:by the provincial government on education, the annual per-capita number of schools in the 
19:445:36559:28:28:72:536:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:province, and the annual per-capita number of teachers in the province.  In a separate model, we 
19:446:36656:28:27:72:533:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:include region-level trends, again designed to address the critique of Stephens and Yang (2014) 
19:447:36752:27:28:72:529:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:who found that U.S. results were sensitive to controlling for a South region indicator variable.  
19:448:36850:28:27:72:518:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Finally, since we are concerned about potential within-province correlation of the errors, we 
19:449:36944:27:28:72:527:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:calculate standard errors using a Wild cluster bootstrap procedure – since Canada has only ten 
19:450:37039:28:28:72:509:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:provinces, Cameron et al. (2008, 2015) suggest this is the appropriate clustering approach. 
19:451:37131:28:27:108:511:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Despite the non-random assignment of education, we first estimate equation (1) via 
19:452:37214:27:28:72:520:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).  For completeness, we will present OLS estimates of β in the 
19:453:37305:28:27:72:524:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:following section, but understand fully that they do not have a causal interpretation, given the 
19:454:37402:27:28:72:525:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:clear endogeneity of the education variable.  To better estimate a valid causal relationship, we 
19:455:37499:28:28:72:517:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:employ a two-stage least squares approach that relies upon compulsory schooling laws as an 
19:456:37590:28:28:72:502:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:instrument for educational attainment.  Our first stage equation takes the following form: 
19:457:37681:28:29:176:438:211:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f2:                                   
19:458:37712:29:27:72:530:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Once again, b represents cohort of birth, p represents province, and c represents Census extract 
19:459:37809:27:28:72:508:155:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:year.  Again, EDUCbpc represents the average years of education of sample women from a 
19:460:37896:28:28:72:532:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:particular province, p, born in a particular birth cohort, b, in a particular Census year, c.  CSLbp 
19:461:37996:28:0:72:517:99:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:represents our compulsory schooling law instrument which, in our main models, is based on 
20:462:38086:0:28:72:521:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:province-determined minimum school leaving ages and is specific to particular birth cohorts, 
20:463:38179:28:28:72:515:681:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f2:Xbpc represents provincial level controls mentioned above including the three province level 
20:464:38272:28:27:72:539:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:school quality variables mentioned and θp, μb and ψc represent province, birth cohort and Census 
20:465:38369:27:28:72:517:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:year fixed effects, respectively, while νbpc is the error term.  Since this specification includes 
20:466:38468:28:27:72:542:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:province and time related fixed effects, the coefficients on the CSL variables (λ) are identified by 
20:467:38569:27:28:72:528:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:both variation in CSLs across provinces as well as variation within-province over time.  In our 
20:468:38665:28:28:72:523:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:main models, we specify the CSL instrument as a dummy variable equal to one if a particular 
20:469:38757:28:27:72:542:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:birth cohort may only drop out of the province’s educational system once they are either 15 or 16 
20:470:38855:27:28:72:246:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:years of age, and zero otherwise.10   
20:471:38893:28:27:108:520:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Given the multiple dimensions of CSLs as well as a lack of consensus on how best to 
20:472:38977:27:28:72:496:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:represent required schooling, we employ several different parameterizations of the CSL 
20:473:39064:28:28:72:535:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:instrument, including using the dropout age, total years of schooling required, entry age, as well 
20:474:39163:28:27:72:524:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:as combinations of these variables—as robustness checks on our instrument.  We report these 
20:475:39255:27:28:72:527:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:estimates, which align closely with estimates from our main models, in the following section.  
20:476:39350:28:27:72:501:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Again, due to the relatively small number of clusters in our data, we implement the Wild 
20:477:39439:27:28:72:535:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:bootstrap clustering procedure for the two-stage least-squares estimation approach, as discussed 
20:478:39536:28:27:72:261:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:by Davidson and MacKinnon (2010).

20:482:39644:27:28:108:521:171:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We report our main estimates in Table 2.  As discussed earlier, our model implies the 
20:483:39730:28:27:72:538:143:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:necessity of examining lifetime fertility separately on intensive and extensive margins.  The first 
20:484:39830:27:30:72:517:116:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:three columns of Table 2 present estimates from models where the dependent variable is the 
20:485:39921:30:8:72:218:86:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:                                                           
20:486:39979:8:0:72:460:78:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:10 Information on the specific timing for changes in these laws is presented in Appendix Table 1. 
21:487:40075:0:28:72:521:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:number of children greater than one (i.e., our intensive margin measure), while the last three 
21:488:40170:28:28:72:526:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:columns present models where the dependent variable is the percent of sample women with at 
21:489:40261:28:27:72:501:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:least one child (i.e., our extensive margin measure).  Both three-column sets first present 
21:490:40353:27:28:72:487:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:estimates from a base model with controls listed in the table notes, the second column 
21:491:40440:28:27:72:526:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:specification adds the education quality variables discussed in the data section, while the third 
21:492:40538:27:28:72:538:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:column specification includes region-specific trends.  Table rows are consistently defined across 
21:493:40636:28:28:72:520:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the three outcomes where the first row represents the mean of the dependent variable and the 
21:494:40729:28:27:72:533:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:second row represents naive OLS estimates of the relationship in question.  Rows 3-7 report IV 
21:495:40824:27:28:72:528:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:estimates with the estimates in Row 3 representing our preferred instrument set (i.e., “Dropout 
21:496:40920:28:27:72:542:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Dummies”), while rows 4-7 report different parameterizations of the CSLs facing sample women 
21:497:41013:27:28:72:526:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:at the relevant ages and in the relevant province.  Specifically, Row 4 uses a single variable to 
21:498:41111:28:28:72:530:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:represent the total required years of education (defined as the difference between the mandated 
21:499:41207:28:27:72:531:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:entry and drop-out ages), Row 5 uses a single variable to capture the mandated age at which an 
21:500:41302:27:28:72:525:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:individual may drop-out of school, Row 6 uses three dummy variables corresponding to cases 
21:501:41393:28:27:72:529:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:when the age at which children are required to attend school is 6, 7 or 8 years of age in a given 
21:502:41491:27:28:72:501:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:province and year, and Row 7 includes the three dropout dummies and three age-at-entry 
21:503:41578:28:28:72:203:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:dummies described above. 
21:504:41603:28:27:108:518:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Before discussing the IV estimates, however, we note that the first-stage relationship 
21:505:41690:27:28:72:517:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:between CSLs, parameterized as dropout indicators in our main models and in various other 
21:506:41780:28:27:72:528:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ways and our schooling variable, is consistently strong.  As seen in Appendix Table 4, all first-
21:507:41877:27:28:72:495:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:stage F-statistics are greater than 10, with roughly half over 50, and most exhibiting the 
21:508:41968:28:0:72:534:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:appropriate p-values to indicate that they are not weak instruments.  While there are differences 
22:509:42066:0:28:72:505:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in the magnitudes of these F-statistics, estimates across models that use these different IV 
22:510:42159:28:28:72:411:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:parameterizations are very robust and quite similar, as we note below. 
22:511:42230:28:27:108:538:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We now turn to our main estimates in Table 2.  As can be seen in the first three columns, 
22:512:42320:27:28:72:528:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:which are based on a sample of women with at least one child, our first set of intensive margin 
22:513:42416:28:27:72:511:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:estimates (i.e., Row 3) imply that an additional year of CSL-induced schooling reduces the 
22:514:42507:27:28:72:515:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:lifetime number of children by roughly 0.9 of a child.  Off a base of almost three-and-a-half 
22:515:42601:28:28:72:532:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:children per sample woman, this represents a decrease of roughly twenty-five percent, which is 
22:516:42696:28:27:72:482:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:very consistent with the totality of our estimates from the other instrumental variable 
22:517:42784:27:28:72:532:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:parametrizations, which collectively imply a percent reduction in the number of children that is 
22:518:42881:28:27:72:508:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:between twenty-five to forty percent.  Indeed, the relevant estimates in Rows 4-7 are quite 
22:519:42973:27:28:72:509:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:similar to our main estimates in Row 3 as well as remaining similar across the three model 
22:520:43064:28:28:72:537:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:specifications presented for each dependent variable.  We interpret this as strong evidence of the 
22:521:43163:28:27:72:241:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:robustness of our main estimates.   
22:522:43198:27:28:108:529:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:While seemingly large, the discrete nature of childbearing may be responsible for large 
22:523:43286:28:27:72:532:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:proportional magnitudes.  Indeed, our estimates are very much in line with ALM, who find that 
22:524:43380:27:28:72:519:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:construction of the Rosenwald Schools in the U.S. South is associated with about a one-third 
22:525:43473:28:28:72:510:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:increase in fertility conditional on having at least one child (i.e., our definition of intensive 
22:526:43571:28:27:72:531:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:margin fertility) in their preferred specification linked to their Table 4.  To explore this issue in 
22:527:43673:27:28:72:505:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:somewhat greater detail, we examine birth effects across the distribution of the number of 
22:528:43764:28:27:72:531:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:children, before we turn to the extensive fertility margin.  In particular, we present estimates of 
22:529:43864:27:28:72:534:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the fraction of women who have at least two, at least four, at least six and at least eight children 
22:530:43965:28:28:72:509:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in Table 3 where column tables correspond to these outcomes.  As can be seen, we find no 
22:531:44054:28:0:72:538:101:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:systematic relationship between CSL-induced schooling and intensive margin fertility at the two 
23:532:44150:0:28:72:529:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:children threshold.  By contrast, we find much stronger evidence at the four, six and especially 
23:533:44247:28:28:72:504:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the eight children thresholds.  Taken together, these suggest that intensive margin fertility 
23:534:44341:28:27:72:528:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reductions occur largely among women who would have relatively large numbers of children.  
23:535:44432:27:28:108:535:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Turning to the extensive fertility margin (i.e., the last three columns of Table 2), we find 
23:536:44525:28:27:72:543:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a very different pattern.  Consistent with our naive OLS estimates, we find that an additional year 
23:537:44625:27:28:72:518:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of CSL-induced schooling actually increases the percent of women who report having given 
23:538:44714:28:28:72:525:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:birth to at least one child, implying an increase in extensive margin of fertility.  Again, our IV 
23:539:44813:28:27:72:542:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:estimates are remarkably consistent across different parameterizations of the CSL instrument and 
23:540:44910:27:28:72:505:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:are also very similar across the three specifications we present.  These IV estimates of the 
23:541:45003:28:27:72:529:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:relationship between education and extensive margin fertility range from 0.042 to 0.057 which 
23:542:45097:27:28:72:529:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:corresponds to a 5 to 7 percent increase in the fraction of sample women who have at least one 
23:543:45192:28:28:72:529:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:child by age forty.  Overall, we find that additional schooling reduces the number of children a 
23:544:45289:28:27:72:520:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:woman has over her lifetime, while also reducing childlessness.  In other words, we find that 
23:545:45383:27:28:72:533:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:education has a “compressing” effect on lifetime fertility—the intensive margin contracts while 
23:546:45479:28:27:72:504:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the extensive margin expands.  In the next section, we reiterate our argument in favour of 
23:547:45570:27:28:72:538:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:education having a “compressing” effect on lifetime fertility and present empirical evidence that 
23:548:45668:28:28:72:175:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:supports this pattern. 
23:549:45691:28:27:72:333:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B. Reconciling main estimates with model predictions 
23:550:45744:27:28:108:537:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The observed pattern—reductions in lifetime fertility along the intensive margin coupled 
23:551:45833:28:27:72:514:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with increases along the extensive margin—can be understood in the context of our model.  
23:552:45923:27:28:72:528:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Recall, that additional education affected fertility through changes in τq and τe in the model we 
23:553:46021:28:28:72:517:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:presented.  Consistent with ALM, we asserted that additional schooling raised τq, the cost of 
23:554:46115:28:0:72:531:101:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:child quantity, and lowered τe, the cost of child quality or child investment.  As discussed, both 
24:555:46214:0:28:72:522:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:such changes imply a clear negative impact on child quantity.  That is, an increase in τq and a 
24:556:46310:28:28:72:537:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:decrease in τe both imply a reduction in the number of children to which a woman is predicted to 
24:557:46407:28:27:72:527:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:give birth.  However, these changes were shown to have an ambiguous effect on the extensive 
24:558:46499:27:28:72:501:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:margin of fertility.  In particular, the model implied that τq increasing should reduce the   
24:559:46593:28:27:72:527:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:probability a woman has at least one child, but that a decrease in τe should increase it.  That is, 
24:560:46693:27:28:72:538:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the two changes oppose each other along the extensive fertility margin.  Our estimates in the last 
24:561:46792:28:28:72:543:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:three rows of Table 2 (i.e., those that pertain to extensive-margin fertility) suggest that the impact 
24:562:46895:28:27:72:543:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of the reduction in the cost of child quality (τe) outweighs the impact of the increase in the cost of 
24:563:46998:27:28:72:545:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:child quantity (τq) since we find an increase in the fraction of women who have at least one child.  
24:564:47099:28:27:72:503:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This is also consistent with the work of ALM, who also found that increases in mandated 
24:565:47187:27:28:72:517:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:schooling levels made it more likely for women to exhibit positive changes on the extensive 
24:566:47279:28:28:72:164:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:margin of fertility. 
24:567:47300:28:27:108:516:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In what follows, we examine two major channels through which education plausibly 
24:568:47381:27:28:72:533:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:affects the costs of fertility, τq and τe.  In particular, we examine: (1) the impact of education on 
24:569:47482:28:27:72:526:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:marriage, since it should principally reduce the price of child quality (τe) and (2) the impact of 
24:570:47581:27:28:72:530:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:education on earnings, which should principally affect the price of child quantity (τq).  We find 
24:571:47679:28:28:72:539:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that education increases the probability of being married, while reducing the probability of never 
24:572:47778:28:27:72:522:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:being married; we believe that these impacts of education reduce the cost of child quality (τe) 
24:573:47874:27:28:72:539:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:which, in turn, may generate the increase in extensive margin fertility we estimate.  We also find 
24:574:47973:28:27:72:537:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that education increases earnings among sample women which represents an increase in the cost 
24:575:48067:27:28:72:530:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of child quantity (τq).  Together, these findings provide support for our assertion that education 
24:576:48166:28:28:72:508:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:increases τq while decreasing τe, a pattern which may generate the “compressing” effect of 
24:577:48256:28:0:72:239:101:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:education on fertility that we find.

25:579:48339:28:28:108:540:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Table 4 presents estimates of the impact of schooling on marriage.  While the rows of the 
25:580:48429:28:27:72:528:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:table correspond to Table 2, the dependent variable in the first three columns is current marital 
25:581:48527:27:28:72:510:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:status, while in the second three columns it is  the fraction of women who report ever being 
25:582:48620:28:27:72:520:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:married.  As in Table 2, the three columns associated with each dependent variable represent 
25:583:48713:27:28:72:540:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:three different model specifications.  Consistent with corresponding OLS estimates, IV estimates 
25:584:48810:28:28:72:522:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:from the first three columns of Table 4 suggest a positive relationship between schooling and 
25:585:48904:28:27:72:531:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:current marital status.  In particular, these estimates, which are nearly identical across the three 
25:586:49005:27:28:72:513:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:specifications, suggest a roughly one percent increase in the proportion of women in a birth 
25:587:49098:28:27:72:516:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:year/province cohort who are currently married.  Estimates from other IV parameterizations 
25:588:49189:27:28:72:537:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(Rows 4-7) are very similar and also statistically precise.  Though slightly smaller in magnitude, 
25:589:49288:28:28:72:541:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:they support the idea that CSL-induced schooling increased marriage.  Estimates presented in the 
25:590:49385:28:27:72:537:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:last three columns paint a similar picture: an increase in education is associated with a roughly 3 
25:591:49485:27:28:72:521:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to 4 percentage-point increase in the likelihood of being married at some point for a woman.  
25:592:49579:28:27:72:501:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Both sets of results—those pertaining to current and historical marital status—imply that 
25:593:49669:27:28:72:518:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:education increased marriage among women who were induced to obtain more schooling by 
25:594:49755:28:28:72:539:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:CSLs.  This increase in marriage is a primary mechanism though which education may plausibly 
25:595:49848:28:27:72:533:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:have reduced the costs of child quality, τe.  In turn, this reduction is consistent with the increase 
25:596:49950:27:28:72:381:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in extensive margin fertility we presented earlier in this section. 
25:597:50018:28:27:108:534:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In Table 5, we present estimates for models that focus on two labour market outcomes—
25:598:50103:27:28:72:527:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:earnings and annual weeks worked—which are closely linked to τq, the cost of child quantity.  
25:599:50197:28:28:72:533:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Table 5 follows the structure of Table 4, but now the first three columns contain estimates from 
25:600:50294:28:0:72:500:101:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:models where the dependent variable is the log of annual income, while the second three 
26:601:50382:0:28:72:538:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:columns present estimates from models where the dependent variable is annual weeks worked, a 
26:602:50475:28:28:72:515:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:measure of labour supply.  To avoid issues related to early retirement, our samples for these 
26:603:50569:28:27:72:528:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:models (income and weeks worked) are based on women aged 30-55 years old instead of aged 
26:604:50658:27:28:72:539:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:40-65 years old as in all other models. As can be seen in Row 3, our main IV estimates suggest a 
26:605:50755:28:27:72:524:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:14-15  percent rate of return to an additional year of schooling, which is consistent with other 
26:606:50852:27:28:72:537:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:studies using Canadian data (Oreopoulos, 2006b).  Furthermore, unlike the case of Stephens and 
26:607:50947:28:28:72:537:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Yang, the inclusion of school quality and region-specific trends does not impact the significance 
26:608:51045:28:27:72:527:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:or magnitude of the returns to education in the second stage of the IV regression.  And, as was 
26:609:51141:27:28:72:506:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the case in earlier tables, estimates are quite similar across the three specifications and the 
26:610:51237:28:27:72:531:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:different IV parameterizations in Rows 4-7 are very similar and most are precisely estimated at 
26:611:51333:27:28:72:500:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:conventional levels of significance.  This overall finding supports the idea that increased 
26:612:51425:28:28:72:509:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:schooling raises τq, the cost of child quantity, via increasing the opportunity cost of having 
26:613:51520:28:27:72:530:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:children.  In turn, it supports our finding of a negative impact of schooling on intensive margin 
26:614:51618:27:28:72:523:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fertility.  While it should also reduce extensive margin fertility, our estimates suggest such an 
26:615:51716:28:27:72:537:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:effect is outweighed by a reduction in τe, a reduction we link to our estimates above which show 
26:616:51813:27:28:72:534:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:additional CSL-induced schooling increased marriage.  The estimates in the final three columns 
26:617:51908:28:28:72:537:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of the table indicate that, if anything, education did not have a consistently significant impact on 
26:618:52009:28:27:72:524:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:labour supply for women in our sample.  In rows three through seven, the IV estimates of this 
26:619:52103:27:28:72:517:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:effect show about a one- to two-week decrease in weeks worked in a year, but most of these 
26:620:52194:28:27:72:521:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:estimates are quite imprecise and not statistically significant.  This indicates that the effect of 
26:621:52294:27:28:72:524:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:education on income in the table’s first three columns was not driven by an increase in labour 
26:622:52389:28:28:72:110:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:supply.

27:624:52397:0:28:72:146:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:VI. Discussion 
27:625:52412:28:28:72:508:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: Changes in fertility patterns have been dramatic over the past half-century, and the 
27:626:52497:28:27:72:530:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:analysis of these patterns has often focused entirely on the intensive margin of fertility, and the 
27:627:52597:27:28:72:506:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:way it has been affected by improved labor market opportunities for women.  But this has 
27:628:52686:28:27:72:525:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ignored the extensive margin of fertility, and in an earlier analysis, ALM demonstrated with a 
27:629:52781:27:28:72:521:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sample of Black women from the U.S. south that improvements in educational training had a 
27:630:52871:28:28:72:535:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:“compressing” effect on the distribution of fertility for women, who were more likely to have at 
27:631:52968:28:27:72:527:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:least one child, but less likely to have many children.  But the choice of sample in ALM raises 
27:632:53064:27:28:72:537:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the question about the generalizability of their finding.  The work of Stephens and Yang showed 
27:633:53160:28:27:72:511:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that education does not have a significant effect on earnings for a sample of all Americans, 
27:634:53253:27:28:72:514:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:which undercuts the ability to extend an analysis of changes in education on fertility, which 
27:635:53347:28:28:72:536:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:implicitly assumes that more education will increase labor market opportunities for women, and 
27:636:53442:28:27:72:316:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:hence change the price of the quantity of children. 
27:637:53494:27:28:72:501:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: This paper provides several contributions to the literatures analyzing the effect of 
27:638:53579:28:27:72:541:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:education on both fertility and earnings.  First, we use a large, representative sample of Canadian 
27:639:53679:27:28:72:530:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:women to demonstrate that the I.V. effect of education is to compress the fertility distribution.  
27:640:53778:28:28:72:536:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Second, we document the fact that – even in the presence of school quality measures and region-
27:641:53873:28:27:72:536:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:specific trends – education has a significant and positive I.V. effect on income for women.  This 
27:642:53971:27:28:72:493:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:finding is both novel to the literature on the returns to education, which has not seen an 
27:643:54062:28:27:72:539:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:equivalent finding since the work of Stephens and Yang, and the crucial to the fertility literature, 
27:644:54163:27:28:72:540:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:which requires a mechanism to alter the price of the quantity of children.  Third, we investigate a 
27:645:54263:28:28:72:497:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:novel mechanism through which education may impact the price of quality for children: 
27:646:54349:28:0:72:513:101:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:marriage propensities.  Since it is less costly to achieve a given level of child quality with a 
28:647:54446:0:28:72:520:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:married couple (as opposed to a single parent), we explore the I.V. effect of education on the 
28:648:54541:28:28:72:531:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:propensity to be currently married or to have ever been married.  In both cases, education has a 
28:649:54638:28:27:72:510:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:positive and statistically significant I.V. effect, which demonstrates a plausible mechanism 
28:650:54731:27:28:72:523:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:through which it may impact the price of child quality.  Overall, these results represent a new 
28:651:54827:28:27:72:539:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:interpretation for the effect of education on fertility for a representative sample of women from a

36:1202:67720:15:14:72:540:399:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The sample consists of women who are at least 40 years old, and born in one of the ten Canadian 
36:1203:67816:14:13:72:528:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:provinces.  The data are assembled from the 1981 and 1991 Canada Censuses.  The dependent 
36:1204:67906:13:14:72:524:372:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:variable is equal to the average educational attainment for women in each birth-year/province 
36:1205:68000:14:14:72:540:358:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cohort.  Each cell reports the F-test on the instrumental variable(s) used in the regression, as well 
36:1206:68102:14:14:72:529:344:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:as the p-values for these test statistics, which are listed in brackets beneath the F-statistics, and 
36:1207:68204:14:14:72:537:330:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:were computed with the Wild Cluster Bootstrap at the province level.  The instruments differ by 
36:1208:68300:14:13:72:525:316:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:row: the first row involves the age at which an individual is allowed to drop out of school, the 
36:1209:68397:13:14:72:521:303:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:second row involves the total number of required years of education, the third row uses three 
36:1210:68491:14:14:72:525:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:dummy variables to capture the age at which a student was permitted to cease their schooling, 
36:1211:68585:14:14:72:535:275:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the fourth row uses three dummy variables to capture the age at which a student was required to 
36:1212:68681:14:14:72:517:261:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:begin their schooling, and the fifth row involves all six dummies involved in the regressions 
36:1213:68775:14:13:72:513:247:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:from the third and fourth rows.  The independent variables in the first column’s regressions 
36:1214:68868:13:14:72:526:234:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:include: year-of-birth dummies, province-of-birth dummies, a quartic in age, a dummy for the 
36:1215:68961:14:14:72:526:220:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Census extract which produced the data, rural status, the percentage of manufacturing jobs, an 
36:1216:69056:14:14:72:530:206:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:aboriginal indicator, an immigrant indicator.  The second column’s regressions are the same as 
36:1217:69151:14:14:72:518:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:column one, but also include the per capita number of schools in the province, the per capita 
36:1218:69245:14:13:72:524:178:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:number of teachers in the province, and the real per capita annual expenditures on schooling.  
36:1219:69340:13:14:72:538:165:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The third column’s regressions are the same as column one, but also include three trend terms to 
36:1220:69437:14:14:72:539:151:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:capture trends in three different regions of Canada – the Atlantic provinces (Newfoundland, PEI,
