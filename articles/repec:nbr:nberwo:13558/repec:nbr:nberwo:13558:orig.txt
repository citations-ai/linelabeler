2:24:1070:28:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:There has been a widespread perception in the past few years that long-term asset prices are generally
2:25:1172:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:high because monetary authorities have effectively kept long-term interest rates, which the market
2:26:1270:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:uses to discount cash flows, low. This perception is not accurate. Long-term interest rates have not
2:27:1370:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:been especially low. What has changed to produce high asset prices appears instead to be changes
2:28:1466:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:in popular economic models that people actually rely on when valuing assets. The public has mostly
2:29:1564:14:42:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:forgotten the concept of "real interest rate." Money illusion appears to be an important factor to consider.

3:40:1924:14:13:258:356:639:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:By Robert J. Shiller 
3:41:1945:13:14:90:93:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: 
3:42:1945:14:14:90:93:612:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: 
3:43:1945:14:28:90:491:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: It is widely discussed that we appear to be living in an era of low long-term 
3:44:2023:28:27:90:524:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:interest rates and high long-term asset prices. Although long rates have been increasing in 
3:45:2115:27:28:90:511:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the last few years, they are still commonly described as low in the 21st century,  both in 
3:46:2206:28:27:90:517:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:nominal and real terms, when compared with long historical averages, or compared with 
3:47:2292:27:28:90:192:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:a decade or two ago. 
3:48:2313:28:28:126:500:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Stock prices, home prices, commercial real estate prices, land prices, even oil 
3:49:2393:28:27:90:520:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:prices and other commodity prices, are said to be very high.2 The two phenomena appear 
3:50:2480:27:28:90:504:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:to be connected: if the long-term real interest rate is low, elementary economic theory 
3:51:2568:28:27:90:523:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:would suggest that the rate of discount for present values is low, and hence present values 
3:52:2660:27:28:90:512:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:should be high. This pair of phenomena, and their connection through the present value 
3:53:2747:28:27:89:495:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:relation, is often described as one of the most powerful and central economic forces 
3:54:2832:27:28:89:284:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:operating on the world economy today.  
3:55:2871:28:28:125:523:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:In this paper I will critique this common view about interest rates and asset prices. 
3:56:2957:28:27:89:494:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:I will question the accuracy and robustness of the “low-long-rate-high-asset-prices” 
3:57:3042:27:28:89:522:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:description of the world. I will also evaluate a popular interpretation of this situation: that 
3:58:3138:28:64:89:320:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:it is due to a worldwide regime of easy money.  
3:59:3186:64:7:89:237:120:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:

3:62:3444:12:7:90:279:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:and Douglas Elmendorf for helpful comments. 
3:63:3488:7:0:90:439:78:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:2 See also my paper on real estate prices, written concurrently with this, Shiller (2007). 
4:64:3580:0:27:90:510:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:  I will argue instead that changes in long-term interest rates and long-term asset 
4:65:3663:27:28:90:519:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:prices seem to have been tied up with important changes in the public’s ways of thinking 
4:66:3752:28:27:90:510:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:about the economy. Rational expectations theorists like to assume that everyone agrees 
4:67:3839:27:28:90:517:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:on the model of the economy, which never changes, and that only some truly exogenous 
4:68:3924:28:28:90:473:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:factor like monetary policy or technological shocks moves economic variables. 
4:69:4002:28:27:90:512:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Economists then have the convenience of analyzing the world from a stable framework 
4:70:4086:27:28:90:507:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that describes consistent public thinking. But, there is an odd contradiction here that is 
4:71:4177:28:27:90:506:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:rarely pointed out: the economists who propose these rational expectations models are 
4:72:4263:27:28:90:500:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:constantly changing their models of the economy. Is it reasonable to suppose that the 
4:73:4349:28:28:89:518:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:public is stably and consistently behind the latest incarnation of the rational expectations 
4:74:4442:28:27:89:127:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:model? 
4:75:4449:27:28:125:516:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: I propose that the public itself is, largely independently of economists, changing 
4:76:4533:28:27:89:522:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:its thinking from time to time. The popular economic models, the models of the economy 
4:77:4620:27:28:89:510:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:believed by the public, have changed massively through time, this has driven both long 
4:78:4707:28:27:89:507:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:rates and asset prices, and that these changes should be central to our understanding of 
4:79:4796:27:28:89:324:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the major asset price movements we have seen.3 
4:80:4842:28:28:90:519:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: This paper will begin by presenting some stylized facts about the level of interest 
4:81:4926:28:27:90:489:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:rates (both nominal and real) and the level of asset prices in the world. Next, I will 
4:82:5013:27:28:90:517:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:consider some aspects of the public’s understanding of the economy, including common 
4:83:5098:28:27:90:515:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:understandings of liquidity, the significance of inflation, and real interest rates, and how 
4:84:5191:27:28:90:483:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:their thinking has impacted both asset prices and interest rates. This will lead to a 
4:85:5277:28:43:90:492:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:conclusion that there is only a very tenuous relation between asset prices and either 
4:86:5363:43:8:90:237:86:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:                                                 
4:87:5411:8:0:90:388:78:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:3 The concept of a popular economic model is discussed in Shiller (1990). 
5:88:5486:0:27:90:492:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:nominal or real interest rates, a relation that is clouded from definitive econometric 
5:89:5573:27:28:89:437:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:analysis by the continual change in difficult-to-observe popular models. 
5:90:5646:28:27:89:92:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: 
5:91:5646:27:28:89:239:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Low Long-Term Interest Rates 
5:92:5675:28:28:89:489:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Figure 1 shows nominal long-term (roughly ten-year) interest rates for four 
5:93:5751:28:27:90:497:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:countries and the Euro Area. With the exception of India, all of them have been on a 
5:94:5836:27:28:90:515:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:massive downtrend since the early 1980s. Even India has been on a downtrend since the 
5:95:5922:28:27:90:499:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:mid 1990s. The lowest point for long term interest rates appears to have been around 
5:96:6007:27:28:90:511:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:2003, but, from a broad perspective, the up-movement in long rates since then is small, 
5:97:6095:28:28:90:505:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and one can certainly say that the world is still in a period of low long rates relative to 
5:98:6187:28:27:90:237:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:much of the last half century.  
5:99:6219:27:28:126:514:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Long rates are not any lower now than they were in the 1950s, but the high rates 
5:100:6300:28:27:90:523:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of the middle part of the period are gone now. In the US, long rates are actually above the 
5:101:6392:27:28:90:500:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:historical average 1871-2007, which is 4.72%. The best one could say from this very 
5:102:6476:28:27:90:490:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:long-term historical perspective is that US long rates are not especially high now.4  
5:103:6562:27:28:90:509:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Economic theory has widely been interpreted as implying that the discount rate 
5:104:6641:28:28:90:522:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:used to capitalize today’s dividend or today’s rents into today’s asset prices should be the 
5:105:6734:28:27:90:486:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:real, not nominal, interest rate. This is because dividends and rents can be broadly 
5:106:6819:27:92:90:518:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:expected to grow at the inflation rate. However, as Franco Modigliani and Richard Cohn 
5:107:6906:92:7:90:237:120:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:                                                 
5:108:6954:7:16:90:508:113:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:4 The long-term government interest rate series for the US 1871-2007 is an update of the series I spliced 
5:109:7060:16:12:90:502:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:together, for my book Irrational Exuberance, 2000, 2005, from series in Sydney Homer’s A History of 
5:110:7160:12:11:90:513:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f1:Interest Rates for 1871 to 1952, and, starting in 1953, the ten-year Treasury Bond series from the Federal 
5:111:7267:11:0:90:130:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:Reserve.  
6:112:7278:0:27:90:522:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:argued nearly 30 years ago, it may, because of a popular model related to money illusion, 
6:113:7368:27:28:90:510:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:be the nominal rate that is used in the market to convert today’s dividend into a price.5  
6:114:7459:28:27:89:524:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The cause of the downtrend in nominal rates since the early 1980s is certainly tied 
6:115:7543:27:28:89:509:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:up with a downtrend in inflation rates over much of the world over the period since the 
6:116:7631:28:28:89:517:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:early 1980s. Figure 2 shows real ex-post real long-term interest rates based on a ten-year 
6:117:7722:28:27:89:521:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:maturity for the bonds. The annualized ten-year inflation rate that actually transpired was 
6:118:7814:27:28:89:505:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:used to correct the nominal yield. For dates since 1997, the entire ten-year subsequent 
6:119:7902:28:27:89:483:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:inflation is not yet known, and so for these the missing future inflation rates were 
6:120:7987:27:28:89:513:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:replaced with historical averages for the last ten years. Note that there has been a strong

6:122:8167:28:27:125:512:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The downtrend in the ex-post real interest rate since the early 1980s is nearly as 
6:123:8249:27:28:89:504:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:striking as with nominal rates. In some countries, ex-post real long-term rates became 
6:124:8336:28:27:89:505:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:remarkably close to zero in 2003. Just as with nominal rates, real rates have picked up 
6:125:8424:27:28:89:143:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:since then. 
6:126:8436:28:27:125:517:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The long-term average ex-post real U.S. long-term government bond yield 1871-
6:127:8514:27:28:89:496:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:1997 is 2.40%, lower than was seen in 1997 (the last year we can compute this yield 
6:128:8598:28:28:89:520:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:without making assumptions about the future).6 Even today, using the latest inflation rate 
6:129:8689:28:27:90:523:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:as a forecast, US real long-term interest rates are not obviously low compared to this long 
6:130:8781:27:28:90:515:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:run average. The best we can say for the popular low long-term interest rate view is that 
6:131:8871:28:52:90:528:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:today interest rates remain relatively low when compared with twenty or thirty years ago.

6:134:9111:16:11:90:522:108:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:corrected for the inflation-induced depreciation of their nominal liabilities, and investors do not make these 
6:135:9222:11:7:90:176:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:corrections properly. 
6:136:9244:7:16:90:518:90:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:6 Ex-post real US long-term government bond yields 1871-1997 were computed using data as described in 
6:137:9346:16:0:90:341:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:footnote 4 above and in my book Irrational Exuberance 2005. 
7:138:9407:0:27:126:506:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:However, ex-post real interest rates may not correspond to ex-ante or expected 
7:139:9486:27:28:90:519:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:real interest rates. It seems unlikely that investors expected the negative ex-post real long 
7:140:9580:28:27:90:524:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:rates of the 1970s which afflicted every major country except stable-inflation Germany. It 
7:141:9671:27:28:90:520:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:is equally unlikely that they expected the high real long rates of the 1980s. After the very 
7:142:9764:28:28:89:518:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:high inflation of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s, inflation in the United States, 
7:143:9856:28:27:89:512:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and elsewhere, came crashing down. It may be that people did not believe that inflation 
7:144:9944:27:28:89:364:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:would stay down over the life of these long-term bonds.  
7:145:10001:28:27:125:498:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Marvin Goodfriend and Robert King argued that the public rationally did not 
7:146:10077:27:28:89:515:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:believe in the 1980s that the lower inflation would continue. They point out that the Fed 
7:147:10167:28:28:89:518:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:under Chairman Paul Volcker (who served from 1979 until Alan Greenspan took over in 
7:148:10251:28:27:89:512:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:1987) announced its radical new economic policy to combat inflation in 1979, and then 
7:149:10337:27:28:89:506:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:promptly blew their credibility at the time of the January-July 1980 recession. US CPI 
7:150:10424:28:27:89:496:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:inflation reached an annual rate of 17.73% in the first quarter of 1980, and the Fed’s 
7:151:10511:27:28:89:523:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:policy had the effect of reducing that to 6.29% by the third quarter of 1980. The Fed must 
7:152:10602:28:27:89:511:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:have given the impression that it lost its resolve to combat inflation with that recession, 
7:153:10694:27:28:89:520:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and inflation was quickly back up to 10.95% in the fourth quarter of 1980. Given the fact 
7:154:10784:28:28:89:502:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that postwar Fed efforts to tame inflation before 1980 were followed in the space of a 
7:155:10871:28:27:89:497:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:number of years with yet higher inflation, a rational public would likely assume that 
7:156:10957:27:28:89:505:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:inflation would again head back up in future years. Hence the expected long-term real 
7:157:11043:28:27:89:514:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:interest rates were not as high in the early 1980s as Figure 2 would suggest. Goodfriend 
7:158:11132:27:0:89:524:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and King pointed out that at the time Paul Volcker himself regarded the nominal long rate 
8:159:11223:0:27:90:513:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:as an indicator of inflationary expectations, and so implicitly assumed that the expected 
8:160:11313:27:28:90:304:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:long-term real rate was essentially constant7 
8:161:11358:28:27:126:514:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A look at international inflation rates suggests that Goodfriend and King’s focus 
8:162:11440:27:28:90:516:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:on Paul Volcker as the stimulus for change in worldwide policy stance towards inflation 
8:163:11528:28:28:90:495:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:may be misplaced, for, on a worldwide basis, the major turning point towards lower 
8:164:11611:28:27:90:499:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:inflation looks more like 1975 than 1981. This was before Volcker’s term as Federal 
8:165:11695:27:28:90:502:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Reserve Board Chairman began, so he is unlikely to be the thought leader behind this 
8:166:11780:28:27:90:130:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:change. 
8:167:11788:27:28:126:513:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The Brookings Papers on Economic Activity certainly played a major role in the 
8:168:11867:28:28:90:512:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:1970s in the change of thinking among policy authorities on monetary policy. The very 
8:169:11953:28:27:90:493:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:first article in the very first issue, by Robert Gordon in 1970, was about the costs of 
8:170:12041:27:28:90:525:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:monetary policy aimed at reducing inflation. In the early 1970s, the theme of dealing with 
8:171:12132:28:27:90:504:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the rising inflation without inducing excessive costs on the economy seemed to be the 
8:172:12218:27:28:90:523:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:most significant topic in the Brookings Papers, where some of the most authoritative new 
8:173:12307:28:27:90:496:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:thinking about this problem appeared. It seems more likely that it was the combined 
8:174:12391:27:28:90:507:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:effect of such scholarship and discourse that changed thinking on inflation policy than 
8:175:12479:28:28:90:448:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that Paul Volcker single-handedly led the world into a new policy regime. 
8:176:12553:28:27:126:497:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:There were also opinion leaders who appealed directly to the broad public to 
8:177:12630:27:28:90:478:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:propose strong policies to deal with inflation. Irving S. Friedman, a former chief 
8:178:12713:28:27:90:475:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:economist at the International Monetary Fund, and then, at the behest of Robert 
8:179:12793:27:28:90:516:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f2:McNamara,  Professor in Residence at the World Bank,  wrote a book in 1973 Inflation: 
8:180:12879:28:28:90:482:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f1:A Growing Worldwide Disaster that may be representative of the kind of thought 
8:181:12958:28:15:90:330:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:leadership that brought down inflation. He wrote:

9:186:13253:14:14:89:498:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:called to act as he was during the Great Depression of the 1930s. . . . The inflation is

9:190:13470:27:28:90:506:612:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:consistently tighter monetary policy. Milton Friedman made a career out of criticizing 
9:191:13557:28:27:89:516:584:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:monetary policy and arguing that the growth rate of the money stock should be targeted, 
9:192:13645:27:28:89:514:557:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:no matter what effects that has on interest rates or any other economic variable. It was a

9:194:13826:28:27:89:521:501:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:in economics in 1976 and chose to give his Nobel lecture on the inflation problem, which 
9:195:13915:27:28:89:516:474:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:was published as Inflation and Unemployment: The New Dimension of Politics, in 1977. 
9:196:14000:28:27:90:154:446:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:He said that:

9:198:14091:14:14:104:471:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:hyperinflation and radical change; or institutions will adjust to a situation of 
9:199:14172:14:14:104:507:391:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:chronic inflation; or governments will adopt policies that will produce a low rate of 
9:200:14258:14:14:104:433:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:inflation and less government intervention into the fixing of prices.9

9:204:14502:27:28:90:507:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:worldwide resonance. When the Volcker Fed made its momentous announcement of a 
9:205:14581:28:28:90:521:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:new monetary policy regime on October 6, 1979, the Federal Open Market Committee in 
9:206:14665:28:27:90:301:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:its official announcement described this as:

10:217:15299:0:27:90:491:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:These words clearly ring, in sound if not fully in substance, as an acceptance of the 
10:218:15385:27:28:90:471:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Friedman formula, and willingness to accept the consequences of following it.  
10:219:15464:28:27:125:514:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Friedman left behind an important change in the popular model of the economy. 
10:220:15542:27:28:90:502:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:He created an association in the public mind between a belief in monetary policy that 
10:221:15628:28:28:90:520:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:tolerates large swings in interest rates to preserve monetary targeting and a general belief 
10:222:15721:28:27:90:505:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:in the importance of free markets, even though there is no logical connection between 
10:223:15807:27:28:90:524:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:these two beliefs. By tying a belief that long-run price stability is the paramount objective 
10:224:15901:28:27:90:510:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:for monetary policy with the emerging worldwide faith in free markets, he assured that 
10:225:15988:27:28:90:355:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f1:this time the efforts to control inflation would not fail.  
10:226:16048:28:28:126:514:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Perhaps it was thought leaders like these, now sometimes forgotten, who argued 
10:227:16127:28:27:90:520:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:persuasively enough that inflation must be controlled that gave Volcker and other central

10:229:16306:28:27:90:520:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Arthur Okun in 1978, had been that reducing inflation by monetary policy alone entails a 
10:230:16395:27:28:90:516:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:“very costly short-run tradeoff” in increased unemployment and lost output. But the rise 
10:231:16484:28:27:90:516:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of inflation led to a sense of alarm, and the failure of other measures to control inflation  
10:232:16578:27:28:90:517:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:led to a increasingly widespread conventional view that the nations of the world have no 
10:233:16667:28:28:90:345:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:choice but to tighten monetary policy considerably.   
10:234:16721:28:27:126:494:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:But, the change in thinking influencing policy makers may not have been so 
10:235:16796:27:28:90:496:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:clearly palpable to the public that they brought down their inflationary expectations. 
10:236:16883:28:27:90:506:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Thus, ex-post real rates may have shot up very high even though ex-ante real rates did 
10:237:16970:27:28:90:111:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:not. 
10:238:16975:28:28:126:514:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Market real interest rates, that is, inflation-indexed bond yields, Figure 3, have a 
10:239:17060:28:0:90:497:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:shorter history in major countries than do ex-post real rates. In the United Kingdom, 
11:240:17148:0:27:90:516:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:where the series begins in 1985, there is a distinct downtrend until the past few years. In 
11:241:17240:27:28:90:472:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the United States the path has been irregular, but the general direction has been 
11:242:17322:28:27:90:509:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:downward since they were first created in 1997. This seems to confirm in a very rough 
11:243:17408:27:28:90:504:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f2:sense that the downtrend in ex-post real interest rates might also be a downtrend in ex-
11:244:17496:28:28:90:508:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f1:ante real interest rates. The August 2007 US inflation-indexed bond yield, at 2.32%, is 
11:245:17584:28:27:90:515:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:almost exactly at the 1871-1997 average of US government ex-post real long-term bond 
11:246:17669:27:28:90:239:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:yields, noted above, of 2.40%. 
11:247:17700:28:27:126:508:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:But these inflation-indexed markets are still small and not central factors in the 
11:248:17783:27:28:90:495:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:economy and their yields may reflect inessential features of the participants in these 
11:249:17870:28:28:90:448:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:markets. Most of these bonds are still held by institutions, not individuals. 
11:250:17948:28:27:126:494:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Moreover, the path of real interest long-term rates are substantially different 
11:251:18028:27:28:90:508:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:across the two countries since 1997 even though their asset price movements are fairly 
11:252:18115:28:27:90:294:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:similar as we shall see in the next section.

11:255:18188:27:28:126:500:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Figure 4 shows real dividend yields on stock price indices for the same list of 
11:256:18268:28:28:90:506:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:countries. The period around 1980, when long term interest rates were most high, was 
11:257:18353:28:27:90:511:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:often a period of relatively low stock prices as indicated by the high dividend yields. In 
11:258:18444:27:28:90:498:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:most countries, dividend yields have been on a major downtrend since the long-term 
11:259:18527:28:27:90:518:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:interest rate peak in the early 1980s, though not exactly in phase with the decline in long-
11:260:18619:27:28:90:185:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:term interest rates.  
11:261:18641:28:28:126:499:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:There was however a major upward correction in dividend yields (downward 
11:262:18714:28:0:90:515:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:correction in stock prices) between 2000 and 2003 unexplained by any rise in long-term 
12:263:18803:0:27:90:517:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:interest rates. In the US, real stock prices fell in half from peak to trough. A good part of 
12:264:18897:27:28:90:498:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the downward correction has been reversed since 2003, even though over this period 
12:265:18980:28:27:90:295:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:long-rates have generally risen, not fallen. 
12:266:19025:27:28:126:512:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Hence, one could say that the simple story that long-rates should move opposite 
12:267:19105:28:28:90:499:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:stock prices is consistent with these data but only in a very rough sense. Stock prices 
12:268:19193:28:27:90:507:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:were abnormally low just when long-rates had their enormous peak in the early 1980s, 
12:269:19278:27:28:89:419:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:however, shorter-run movements in the series do not match up well. 
12:270:19345:28:27:126:509:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A remarkable boom in home prices has appeared since the peak in long rates in 
12:271:19423:27:28:90:506:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the early 1980s. Figure 5 shows real (inflation corrected) home prices for seven major 
12:272:19510:28:28:90:519:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:countries. Five of the seven countries have shown booms. In the United States, the boom 
12:273:19598:28:27:89:505:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:is, for the nation as a whole, the largest since 1890.11 Prior home price booms seem to 
12:274:19686:27:28:90:524:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:have been relatively contained geographically (for example, to Florida or California). The 
12:275:19777:28:27:90:503:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:fact that the boom has become so pervasive leads one to wonder if it is indeed tied up 
12:276:19864:27:28:90:498:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:with the trend in interest rates. However, the uptrend in home prices clearly does not 
12:277:19951:28:27:90:492:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:begin until the late 1990s, after most of the downtrend in nominal interest rates had 
12:278:20037:27:28:90:507:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:passed. It seems that, although it might seem at first that there is a substantial negative 
12:279:20129:28:28:90:517:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:correlation historically between asset prices and interest rates, this correlation is actually 
12:280:20224:28:27:90:520:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:very weak. However, a perception that there is such a relationship may have an influence 
12:281:20313:27:28:90:427:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f2:on the market; it may help frame today’s market as justifiably high.12

12:286:20514:12:16:90:513:124:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:12 There was a mysterious sharp drop in the US TIPS yield after 1999, as can be seen in Figure 3, but it is 
12:287:20622:16:11:89:505:108:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:hard to imagine that this market, which is hardly noticed by the general public, was driving the housing 
12:288:20727:11:12:89:509:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:market. The TIPS yield was very high in its early years, much higher than historical real interest rates or 
12:289:20835:12:11:89:501:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:index-linked yields in the UK, as the US Treasury tried to entice a highly skeptical public to buy these 
12:290:20940:11:0:89:512:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:innovative securities. The correction down of the TIPS yield only reflects a normalization of this market.

14:341:23326:27:28:90:318:300:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:real dividends show some short-run volatility.) 
14:342:23374:28:27:90:502:272:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Notably, as one can see in Figure 4, the very high real interest rates in the late 
14:343:23457:27:28:90:520:245:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:1970s to early 1980s do seem to correspond to somewhat to high dividend yields, at least 
14:344:23546:28:27:90:491:217:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:when compared with recent years. But the correspondence with interest rates is not 
14:345:23629:27:28:90:508:190:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:compelling, and seems to apply only in comparisons with the relatively brief period of 
14:346:23716:28:28:90:503:162:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:anomalously high interest rates and inflation in the late 1970s to early 1980s. And the 
14:347:23804:28:27:90:517:134:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:high dividend yields then were not so high as interest rates would suggest. In the US, for 
14:348:23895:27:28:90:508:107:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:example, dividend yields in the early1980s were at about the same level as in the early 
14:349:23983:28:0:90:519:79:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:1950s. This fact was noted by Blanchard and Summers, who, in their Brookings paper in 
15:350:24071:0:27:90:476:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:1984 wrote “One would expect that a sharp increase in real interest rates at long 
15:351:24153:27:28:90:468:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:maturities, caused by fiscal and monetary policies, would depress stock prices 
15:352:24232:28:27:90:512:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:significantly. Yet in all major countries, real stock prices have been surprisingly strong. 
15:353:24324:27:28:89:477:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Dividend-price ratios have in no way followed real rates on long-term bonds.”14

15:358:24445:14:28:126:521:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The theory presumes that real interest rates are natural concepts to use to describe 
15:359:24530:28:27:90:512:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:public decisions. However, in fact, the real interest rate is not even a concept that many 
15:360:24621:27:28:90:466:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:people use to frame their decision-making when they think about asset prices. 
15:361:24699:28:28:126:520:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The concept of the real interest rate dates back to 1895 with Columbia University 
15:362:24781:28:27:90:495:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:economics professor John Bates Clark whose name is memorialized in a prestigious 
15:363:24862:27:28:89:512:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:economics medal that the American Economic Association awards today. In describing 
15:364:24945:28:27:89:522:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the concept, he seemed to be presenting it as a strikingly original new idea that he needed 
15:365:25037:27:28:89:509:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:to explain at some length. He wrote about a widespread confusion, that he discerned in 
15:366:25124:28:27:89:490:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the then-current debate about bimetallism, about the interpretation of interest rates. 
15:367:25211:27:28:89:498:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Discussing the example of a debtor in an environment with one percent deflation, he 
15:368:25295:28:28:89:516:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:noted that “If he pays a nominal rate of five percent in interest, he may pay a real rate of 
15:369:25388:28:27:89:524:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:six.” 15  In the following year, 1896, Yale University’s Irving Fisher wrote about the same 
15:370:25480:27:28:90:498:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:popular confusion, but did not use the term “real rate” but instead “virtual interest in 
15:371:25569:28:27:90:521:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:commodities.”  He also noted the lack of public understanding of the basic concept: “It is 
15:372:25660:27:28:90:512:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:an astonishing fact that the connection between the rate of interest and appreciation has 
15:373:25750:28:32:90:517:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:been almost completely overlooked, both in economic theory and in its bearing upon the

15:376:25925:12:0:90:177:78:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:15 Clark (1895) p. 62. 
16:377:25950:0:27:90:510:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:bimetallic controversy.”16  He was right to be astonished, for indeed the significance of 
16:378:26040:27:28:90:516:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:any interest rate depends critically on the inflation rate, and referring to nominal interest 
16:379:26134:28:27:90:348:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:rates alone may be regarded as almost meaningless.17 
16:380:26186:27:28:126:484:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Clark’s long discourse on the elementary concept of real interest rates and 
16:381:26262:28:28:90:514:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Fisher’s astonishment at the lack of public understanding reflect their recognition of the 
16:382:26353:28:27:90:482:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:importance of what today are classified as behavioral biases in popular economic 
16:383:26434:27:28:90:508:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:thinking, notably a bias called “money illusion,” a term coined by Fisher in 1928. But, 
16:384:26522:28:27:90:507:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:failure to think in terms of real interest rates rather than nominal rates, while it may be 
16:385:26614:27:28:90:475:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:described as an “illusion,” is perhaps better described as just an abject failure to 
16:386:26699:28:28:90:514:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:understand the concept. The concept of real interest rate remains totally absent from the 
16:387:26789:28:27:90:246:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:popular model of the economy.  
16:388:26820:27:28:126:512:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Indeed, long after they first discussed it, the concept of the real interest rate still 
16:389:26908:28:27:90:505:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:did not even enter the language. People need to understand the concept of real interest 
16:390:26996:27:28:90:486:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:rate if they are to make the dynamic Gordon model work. If they cannot grasp the 
16:391:27077:28:27:90:488:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:concept, then it is hard to see how they will immunize themselves from the money 
16:392:27158:27:28:90:305:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:illusion described by Modigliani and Cohn.  
16:393:27202:28:28:126:521:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Of course, if people had clearly in mind the nominal growth rate of dividends, the 
16:394:27285:28:27:90:509:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f1:g in the Gordon formula above, and framed it, as well as the r in r-g, in nominal terms, 
16:395:27374:27:28:90:510:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:there would be no error. But I have not been able to find any popular discussions about 
16:396:27462:28:27:90:518:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adjusting the projected growth rate of dividends for changes in projected inflation, and it 
16:397:27554:27:48:90:312:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:appears most unlikely that most people do so. 
16:398:27600:48:8:90:237:109:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:                                                 
16:399:27648:8:11:90:175:101:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:16 Fisher (1896) p. 4. 
16:400:27671:11:16:90:511:90:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:17 In his 1898 book Geldzins und Güterpreise  Knut Wicksell spoke of the related concept of the “natural 
16:401:27776:16:0:89:156:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:rate of interest.” 
17:402:27797:0:27:126:520:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Also, of course, if the pricing of financial assets were exclusively the domain of a 
17:403:27882:27:28:89:514:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:small group of sophisticated investors, the so-called “marginal investors,” then it would 
17:404:27972:28:27:89:524:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:not matter that the general public was making mistakes. However, as I argued in my 1984 
17:405:28060:27:28:89:502:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Brookings Paper, and as Andrei Shleifer and Rob Vishny also argued, there are many 
17:406:28143:28:28:89:508:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:reasons to think that this “smart money” cannot rectify long-term mispricings of major 
17:407:28230:28:27:89:155:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:asset classes. 
17:408:28245:27:28:125:515:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Modigliani and Cohn made it part of their argument in 1979 that stock prices are 
17:409:28326:28:27:89:518:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:determined by nominal, not real rates, that few news media or business people ever refer 
17:410:28415:27:28:89:524:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:to the concept of real interest rates for the discounting of future corporate cash flows or to 
17:411:28510:28:28:89:507:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the correction that must be made to corporate earnings for the real value of the interest 
17:412:28600:28:27:89:218:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:owed by the corporation:   
17:413:28627:27:14:140:487:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:. . . the financial press kept asserting that earnings-price ratios had to be 
17:414:28705:14:14:104:479:391:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:compared with nominal interest rates, while not even mentioning the fact that 
17:415:28783:14:14:104:510:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:profits of firms with large debts should be adjusted for the inflation premium. To be 
17:416:28869:14:13:104:477:363:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:sure, the financial press may not be the best source of information about how 
17:417:28947:13:14:104:484:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:investors value equities. We therefore endeavored to secure recent memoranda 
17:418:29024:14:14:104:502:336:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:from large brokerage firms advising institutional investors; in virtually every case, 
17:419:29110:14:14:104:487:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:it was clear that analysts did not add back to earnings the gain on debt, and that 
17:420:29193:14:13:104:499:308:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:they also relied at least partly on the capitalization of earnings at a nominal rate.18

18:437:30360:28:27:90:493:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:only one reference to real interest rates (as noted above, in 1946). The frequency of 
18:438:30446:27:28:90:520:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:references to real interest rates has been extremely low, never more than a few percent of 
18:439:30537:28:27:90:522:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:references to interest rates. Even those levels of references to real interest rates have been 
18:440:30632:27:28:90:520:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:dropping off precipitously. The concept of “real interest rate” appears to have had its day 
18:441:30724:28:28:90:498:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and is dying. Note that the frequency of use of “real interest rate” picked up with the 
18:442:30812:28:27:90:493:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:inflation of the 1970s, but can hardly be described as an automatic response to high 
18:443:30897:27:28:90:491:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:inflation since there were earlier high inflation periods that had no use of the term.  
18:444:30985:28:27:126:484:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:It was suggested that perhaps the term “real interest rate” has merely been 
18:445:31061:27:28:90:499:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:replaced over time by “interest rate adjusted for inflation” and so that Figure 6 might

18:448:31322:28:28:90:513:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:inflation” or “inflation-adjusted interest rate” or “inflation-indexed interest rate.” These 
18:449:31415:28:27:90:520:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:terms together are indeed much rarer than “real interest rate,” and articles that mentioned 
18:450:31507:27:28:90:502:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:any of these terms never amounted to 0.25% of the number of articles that mentioned 
18:451:31591:28:27:90:500:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:“interest rate.” Moreover, the pattern of the usage of these terms is much the same as 
18:452:31678:27:28:90:518:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:shown in Figure 1, declining in recent years, though usage of these terms as a fraction of 
18:453:31769:28:0:89:364:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:usage of “interest rate” peaked somewhat later, in 1990.  
19:454:31829:0:27:90:488:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Figure 7 shows the use of the term real interest rate in annual reports in the 
19:455:31908:27:28:89:510:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Proquest database of corporations’ annual reports, within five-year time periods at five-
19:456:31997:28:27:90:504:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:year intervals. The same spike in usage of the term appears in these reports in 1980-4. 
19:457:32085:27:28:90:500:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Remarkably, not a single annual report used the term “real interest rate” in 1995-9 or 
19:458:32172:28:28:90:487:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:2000-4, among over 2000 annual reports in the database in both of those five-year 
19:459:32254:28:27:89:505:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:intervals.20 As with the newspaper data set, the number of annual reports that used the 
19:460:32342:27:28:90:507:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:term “real interest rate” peaked at only 1.8% of the number of annual reports that used 
19:461:32430:28:27:90:506:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the term “interest rate.” Note also that the word “interest rate” has grown dramatically 
19:462:32519:27:28:90:519:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:over this sample, from 17.7% of annual reports in 1960 to 93.5% in 1980, and has stayed 
19:463:32607:28:28:90:515:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:at around 90% ever since. The effect of the 1980 interest rate peak had its effect on both 
19:464:32698:28:27:90:509:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:“real interest rate” and “interest rate,” but the effect was permanent only on the latter.   
19:465:32791:27:28:90:516:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The real interest rate concept still seems highly relevant in judging the high asset 
19:466:32876:28:27:90:500:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:prices we observe, but the public won’t buy it. I know this from personal experience, 
19:467:32962:27:28:90:517:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:when I talk with news reporters and attempt to refer to the concept. They listen patiently 
19:468:33053:28:27:90:518:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and change the subject, and sometimes even offer that their readers don’t relate to such a 
19:469:33144:27:28:90:133:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:concept. 
19:470:33153:28:28:126:497:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS) market started in the US in 
19:471:33230:28:27:90:514:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:1997. The term “real interest rate” did not take off with the development of this market. 
19:472:33320:27:28:90:510:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The US Treasury does not use the term “real interest rate” in association with their sale 
19:473:33410:28:27:90:509:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and marketing, instead they refer just to “yield” on the Inflation-Indexed Security. The 
19:474:33499:27:28:90:497:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:stark reality and central importance suggested by John Bates Clark’s term was never 
19:475:33583:28:20:90:523:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:suggested by the words that surround TIPS. Part of the relative lack of popularity of TIPS 
19:476:33674:20:8:90:237:109:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:                                                 
19:477:33722:8:16:90:486:101:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:20A search was done in the same annual report database for “interest rate adjusted for inflation,” or 
19:478:33824:16:11:90:516:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:“inflation adjusted interest rate,” or “inflation-adjusted interest rate.” Amazingly, none of these terms was 
19:479:33934:11:0:90:280:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:ever used in any annual report in this database.

20:481:34074:27:28:90:400:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:fundamental problems or providing important price discovery.21 
20:482:34136:28:27:126:509:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:In my book New Financial Order: Risk in the 21st Century (2003) I argued that 
20:483:34214:27:28:89:508:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:governments around the world should adopt new units of measurement for real values, 
20:484:34298:28:28:89:505:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:indexed units of account, like the Unidad de Fomento that Chile adopted in 1967, and 
20:485:34383:28:27:89:514:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:educate their publics to use these units for contracts instead of currency. I proposed that 
20:486:34475:27:28:89:516:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the units be called “baskets” so that people can appreciate that by trading in these terms, 
20:487:34567:28:27:89:498:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:they are trading in the market baskets that underlie the consumer price index. Only a 
20:488:34653:27:28:89:339:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:major step like this could eliminate money illusion.

20:491:34737:27:28:125:516:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:If one looks at the things people actually say, the concepts that come naturally to 
20:492:34821:28:27:89:506:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:them rather than those that are attributed to them by economic theorists, one discovers 
20:493:34909:27:28:89:454:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that they typically frame the level of asset prices in entirely different terms. 
20:494:34990:28:27:125:515:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The idea that the world is “awash with liquidity” is part of the lore of the market 
20:495:35074:27:28:89:490:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:recently. I tabulated the occurrence of the phrase “awash with liquidity” in English 
20:496:35159:28:28:90:516:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:language newspapers with a Lexi-Nexis search. I found that the use of the phrase soared 
20:497:35247:28:27:90:512:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:during the stock market boom of the late 1990s, and then soared even higher during the 
20:498:35334:27:28:90:518:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:housing boom, starting 2004. The term was also used rather frequently in the mid 1980s, 
20:499:35422:28:52:90:301:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:just before the stock market crash of 1987.  
20:500:35467:52:8:90:237:132:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:                                                 
20:501:35515:8:16:90:493:124:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:21 According to Treasury Bulletin, federal debt securities held by the public first passed $5 trillion in 
20:502:35621:16:11:90:498:108:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:February 2007 (Table FD-1), and in that month TIPS amounted to $411 billion (Table FD-2). Federal 
20:503:35719:11:12:90:496:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:Reserve Flow of Funds Accounts, Table B100, show household net worth at $56.2 trillion in the first 
20:504:35819:12:11:90:519:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:quarter of 2007, and hence TIPS amount to well under one percent of net worth, and even that held largely 
20:505:35925:11:0:90:212:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:by institutions and foreigners. 
21:506:35959:0:27:126:470:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Reading some of the many recent newspaper accounts of this supposed 
21:507:36027:27:28:90:520:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:phenomenon, it seems clear that some of these popular writings are confused about some 
21:508:36114:28:27:90:509:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of the most basic principles of economics. It definitely seems that the popular model is 
21:509:36203:27:28:90:518:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that when people buy stocks their money goes “into” the stock market and sits there, and 
21:510:36292:28:28:90:509:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:so higher stock prices mean that there must be more money (liquidity) to pay for them. 
21:511:36379:28:27:126:489:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: An example of the kind of thinking appears in a recent Wall Street Journal

21:528:37127:14:27:126:522:253:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:We have seen here that the big movements in stock prices and real estate prices in 
21:529:37210:27:28:90:510:226:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the last decade or so do not line up with movements in long-term interest rates over the 
21:530:37299:28:32:90:513:198:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:same time period. This appears to confirm the 1988 results of Campbell and Shiller that

21:534:37586:7:16:90:519:136:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:23 Some economists have tried to give a more sensible interpretation of what these writers might be saying. 
21:535:37694:16:12:90:522:120:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:Adrian and Shin (2007) argued that the phenomenon that those who use these terms might be interpreted as 
21:536:37799:12:11:90:513:108:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:describing is that there is a feedback mechanism operating within investment banks and to a lesser extent 
21:537:37905:11:12:90:523:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:commercial banks that causes them to demand more investments when asset inflation has inflated the assets 
21:538:38011:12:11:90:511:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:on their balance sheets, so that higher asset prices tend to create through this mechanism yet higher asset 
21:539:38119:11:0:90:119:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:prices. 
22:540:38129:0:27:90:519:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:stock prices relative to dividends or earnings are not well explainable in terms of present-
22:541:38221:27:28:90:463:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:value models with time-varying interest rates. Yet if we are doing very broad 
22:542:38299:28:27:90:496:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:comparisons of the present time with another time, comparing the early 1980s when 
22:543:38381:27:28:90:510:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:interest rates were very high with today, we might say that lower nominal interest rates 
22:544:38470:28:28:90:420:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:are indeed a factor in the relatively higher asset prices we see today. 
22:545:38542:28:27:126:509:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The money-illusion theory that low nominal interest rates help propel real long-
22:546:38622:27:28:90:521:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:term asset prices upwards in a time of declining inflation may seem a little unsatisfactory 
22:547:38714:28:27:90:512:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:since it describes people as understanding enough about inflation so as to push nominal 
22:548:38802:27:28:90:512:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:rates down in declining-inflation periods but not understanding it well enough that they 
22:549:38891:28:28:90:493:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:should realize that these lower nominal rates should not be used to discount today’s 
22:550:38976:28:27:90:478:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:dividend into a higher price. It may not seem like a sound approach to economic 
22:551:39056:27:28:90:493:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:theorizing to assume that people understand some applications of a concept and not 
22:552:39139:28:27:90:128:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:others.  
22:553:39148:27:28:126:502:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:But we have seen above that people do not even talk about the concept of real 
22:554:39226:28:27:90:513:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:interest rates today, and so it certainly stands as plausible that they would be vulnerable 
22:555:39318:27:28:90:520:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:to errors in handling all ramifications of the concept equally well. The natural framing of 
22:556:39410:28:28:90:512:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:stock market reports involves dividend-price ratios and earnings-price ratios, which are 
22:557:39499:28:27:90:472:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:already framed so that they can easily be compared with nominal interest rates. 
22:558:39579:27:28:90:518:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Moreover, public understanding about a world “awash with liquidity” may be reinforced 
22:559:39665:28:27:90:490:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:by their perception of an era of low nominal rates, and may help reinforce errors in 
22:560:39750:27:28:90:455:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:pricing. Behavioral economics has always had to confront a public’s partial 
22:561:39826:28:28:90:504:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:understanding of economic concepts, of mental compartments, of framing effects that 
22:562:39910:28:0:90:178:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:distort judgment.  
23:563:39931:0:27:90:521:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:  This paper has discussed one simple explanation of the asset booms since the mid 
23:564:40014:27:28:90:513:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:1990s, that they are a direct consequence of falling long-term interest rates. I concluded 
23:565:40105:28:27:90:486:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that changes in popular economic models should be viewed as more central to our 
23:566:40185:27:28:90:519:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:understanding of these high asset prices. I have not offered a complete theory of the high 
23:567:40276:28:28:90:521:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:asset prices. Presumably, as I discussed in Irrational Exuberance, there are many factors, 
23:568:40367:28:27:90:489:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:including among other things speculative feedback and social epidemics, that have 
23:569:40449:27:0:90:274:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:contributed to high asset prices today.
