2:30:1444:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:Does the lack of peers contribute to the observed gender gap in entrepreneurial success, and is the
2:31:1543:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:constraint stronger for women facing more restrictive social norms? We offered two days of business
2:32:1642:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:counseling to a random sample of customers of India’s largest women’s bank. A random subsample
2:33:1736:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:was invited to attend with a friend. The intervention had a significant immediate impact on participants’
2:34:1841:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:business activity, but only if they were trained in the presence of a friend. Four months later, those
2:35:1943:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:trained with a friend were more likely to have taken out business loans, were less likely to be housewives,
2:36:2050:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:and reported increased business activity and higher household income. The positive impacts of training
2:37:2152:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:with a friend were stronger among women from religious or caste groups with social norms that restrict
2:38:2254:14:42:72:151:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:female mobility.

3:66:2714:0:29:72:185:709:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:1    Introduction
3:67:2731:29:17:72:540:680:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Women in rich and poor countries alike are less likely than men to succeed as entrepreneurs (Global
3:68:2830:17:18:72:540:663:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Entrepreneurship Monitor, 2011; De Mel, McKenzie, and Woodruff, 2008).  A common policy re-
3:69:2921:18:18:72:540:645:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sponse in low-income settings, where female educational attainment is relatively low, is to prescribe
3:70:3022:18:17:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:business training and counseling programs.  Yet, a growing body of experimental evidence suggests
3:71:3119:17:18:72:540:610:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that simple deficits in business or accounting know-how are not at the heart of the gender gap in
3:72:3216:18:18:72:291:592:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:performance (McKenzie and Woodruff, 2014).
3:73:3258:18:17:88:539:574:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Here,  we  ask  whether  the  low  number  of  successful  female  micro-entrepreneurs  may  directly
3:74:3359:17:18:72:540:557:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:contribute to their weaker performance by limiting positive peer effects on business behaviors.  Our
3:75:3459:18:17:72:540:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:analysis makes use of a field experiment in which a randomly selected set of clients from India’s
3:76:3556:17:18:72:540:522:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:largest women’s bank, SEWA Bank, were provided a short (two half-days, with two hours of in-
3:77:3648:18:18:72:540:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:class training per day) business counseling program.  During the program, women were taught basic
3:78:3745:18:17:72:540:486:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:financial literacy and business skills and shown a film showcasing successful role models in their
3:79:3843:17:18:72:540:469:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:community.  They also worked with the trainer to first set a six-month financial goal and then break
3:80:3943:18:17:72:540:451:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that goal down into actionable steps.  Fiscal discipline, particularly via savings, was emphasized as
3:81:4044:17:18:72:540:434:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:key to achieving the target, and participants were informed about the different savings products
3:82:4140:18:18:72:540:416:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:available from the bank.  The key experimental variation on which we focus is that a random half
3:83:4236:18:17:72:540:398:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of the potential participants were invited to attend the training and counseling sessions with a peer
3:84:4337:17:18:72:142:381:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of their choice.
3:85:4353:18:18:88:539:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Program take-up was roughly 70%, and over 90% of peer-treated women who attended training
3:86:4442:18:17:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:were accompanied by their invited friend.  Given the program’s emphasis on short-run goal setting,
3:87:4540:17:18:72:540:328:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:we focus our analysis on impacts observed four months after training.  Bank administrative data
3:88:4635:18:17:72:540:310:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:suggest that treated women were more likely to take out a loan relative to the control group of
3:89:4730:17:18:72:540:293:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:women who were not invited to training sessions.  This higher loan incidence may, however, simply
3:90:4827:18:18:72:540:275:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:reflect greater familiarity with bank products or confidence that their loan application would be
3:91:4924:18:17:72:540:257:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:successful.  More revealing are the substantial differences in borrowing behavior across those invited
3:92:5026:17:18:72:540:240:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to attend alone and those invited to attend with a friend:  Only women invited with a friend have
3:93:5123:18:17:72:540:222:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a higher propensity to borrow, and they almost exclusively used the marginal loans for business
3:94:5218:17:18:72:540:205:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:purposes.   Furthermore,  survey  data  show  that,  four  months  later,  those  invited  with  a  friend
3:95:5324:18:18:72:540:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:report  differences  in  business  behavior,  including  a  higher  volume  of  business  and  more  stated
3:96:5431:18:17:72:540:169:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:business  plans  to  increase  revenues,  while  women  invited  alone  experience  no  change  in  these
3:97:5536:17:18:72:540:152:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:outcomes relative to the control group.  Perhaps most strikingly, those invited with a friend also
3:98:5634:18:18:72:540:134:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:report significantly higher household income and expenditures and are less likely to report their
3:99:5731:18:44:72:190:116:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:occupation as housewife.

4:101:5756:0:18:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The observed benefits from training with a peer could operate through multiple mechanisms.
4:102:5846:18:18:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The  presence  of  peers  may  influence  a  woman’s  classroom  experience  –  she  may  exhibit  greater
4:103:5952:18:17:72:540:673:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:business confidence in a more supportive environment, or may feel more competitive pressure when
4:104:6048:17:18:72:540:656:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:among peers to absorb the material covered.  Equally, having a friend as a training partner may
4:105:6143:18:18:72:540:638:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:strengthen the social network that a woman relies on for support after the training is over.  This
4:106:6241:18:17:72:540:620:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:support  could  include  financial  assistance,  information,  or  even  just  ongoing  encouragement  to
4:107:6346:17:18:72:540:603:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:strive  to  attain  business  goals.   Our  experiment  was  not  designed  to  disentangle  these  potential
4:108:6455:18:17:72:540:585:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mechanisms.   That  said,  we  find  some  suggestive  evidence  that  women  in  the  treatment-with-
4:109:6557:17:18:72:540:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:friend sessions may have set systematically different goals for themselves during the training, which
4:110:6658:18:18:72:540:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:indicates  that  the  presence  of  friends  may  have  changed  aspirations  rather  than  the  ability  to
4:111:6766:18:17:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:implement  those  goals.   This  interpretation  is  consistent  with  the  fact  that,  relative  to  women
4:112:6874:17:18:72:540:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:invited alone for training,  women invited with a friend are equally likely to engage in suggested
4:113:6972:18:17:72:540:497:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:business practices, such as record-keeping, are no more or less confident about business skills after
4:114:7073:17:18:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the  training,  and  do  not  differ  in  their  propensity  to  discuss  business  matters  with  family  and
4:115:7183:18:18:72:107:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:friends.
4:116:7191:18:17:88:539:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:A different way to examine channels of influence is to ask whether the observed impacts for
4:117:7282:17:18:72:540:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:training with a friend are concentrated in particular demographic groups.  Social norms are com-
4:118:7378:18:18:72:540:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:monly cited as a constraint on labor force participation in India that restrict female mobility and,
4:119:7478:18:17:72:540:391:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:thus, women’s access to business networks (Klasen and Pieters, 2015).  If mobility constraints are
4:120:7576:17:18:72:540:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:binding, then the women most likely to benefit from professional peer interactions are those most
4:121:7673:18:17:72:540:356:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:subject to social strictures.  Consistent with this,  the impacts of peer training on business loans
4:122:7773:17:18:72:540:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and labor supply are concentrated among women belonging to groups with more restrictive social
4:123:7867:18:18:72:539:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:norms.1Being  able  to  attend  the  training  with  a  peer  has  only  a  modest  effect  on  attendance,
4:124:7974:18:17:72:520:303:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:which suggests that access to networks, not immobilityper se, limits female entrepreneurship.
4:125:8067:17:18:88:539:286:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Our  paper  contributes  to  two  growing,  but  largely  distinct,  experimental  literatures  on  peer
4:126:8171:18:17:71:539:268:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:effects in learning and the impact of business training programs.  In low-income settings, the liter-
4:127:8272:17:18:71:539:251:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ature on peer effects in learning has largely focused on schools.  Duflo, Dupas, and Kremer (2011)

4:135:9105:11:11:72:540:120:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:with a friend.  In that paper, we showed that average treatment impacts also varied with the individual’s caste and
4:136:9220:11:37:72:294:109:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:religion, which were linked to social norms on mobility.

5:141:9577:17:18:72:465:656:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:it focuses on low-income women in urban India rather than business professionals.

5:147:10141:18:18:72:540:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of propensity to work.  They find limited evidence that matching participants by workplace attach-

5:149:10336:17:18:72:413:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in peers’ average propensity to work raises a participant’s labor supply.
5:150:10409:18:17:88:539:497:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Our paper extends these literatures in multiple ways.  First,  we focus on peer effects for the
5:151:10504:17:18:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:population that is typically targeted by business training programs in low-income settings, namely
5:152:10602:18:18:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:female micro-entrepreneurs.  Although our eligibility criteria were lenient – that clients be between
5:153:10703:18:17:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:18 and 50 years old and that they had actively saved or borrowed from SEWA Bank in the previous
5:154:10798:17:18:72:540:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:two years (i.e. between 2005 and 2006) – the majority of women in our study sample also share
5:155:10891:18:18:72:540:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the demographic characteristics of typical microfinance participants in India:  married women who
5:156:10988:18:17:72:540:391:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are self-employed and earn between two to three dollars per day.  Second, we consider the role of
5:157:11085:17:18:72:540:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:friends as peers.  In environments where social norms limit women’s interactions with strangers, it
5:158:11184:18:17:72:540:356:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is important to ask whether training with self-identified friends (with whom interactions are likely
5:159:11284:17:18:72:540:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:less restricted) can have an impact.  Thus, in addition to shedding light on the role of peer networks
5:160:11386:18:18:72:540:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and, thereby, potential barriers to female microenterprise activity, our findings have implications
5:161:11485:18:17:72:540:303:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on how to design business training and counseling programs to maximize their influence.  Given
5:162:11579:17:18:72:540:286:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that peer effects seem to operate through making participants more ambitious in the goals they set
5:163:11677:18:17:72:540:268:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:or more accountable to those goals once set, we posit that the presence of friends as peers is likely
5:164:11778:17:18:72:540:251:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to be particularly influential in training programs that involve personalized business plans rather
5:165:11877:18:18:72:237:233:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:than simple information provision.
5:166:11911:18:17:88:539:215:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The  remainder  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows.   Section  2  first  describes  the  business

5:168:12112:18:17:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:describing the study design, sample and data sources.  Section 3 presents the empirical results and

5:171:12340:15:11:72:540:134:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:which used training materials from the same group, Freedom from Hunger, as we do.  Similar to them, we find that
5:172:12452:11:52:72:385:123:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:business training can increase loan demand from the microfinance institution.

6:175:12564:29:17:72:540:680:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Between September 2006 and April 2007, we worked with staff from India’s largest women’s bank,
6:176:12658:17:18:72:540:663:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:SEWA  Bank,  to  provide  over  400  female  bank  clients  in  Ahmedabad,  which  is  the  capital  city
6:177:12763:18:18:72:539:645:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of Gujarat, India, access to a two-day business counseling program.3Below we first describe the
6:178:12858:18:33:72:465:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:counseling program that we evaluate and then our data sources and analysis plan.

6:180:12994:25:17:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:SEWA Bank’s 170,000 member-clients are primarily women who work in home-based occupations
6:181:13083:17:18:72:540:552:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:such  as  stitching  and  tailoring,  piece-rate  work  (e.g.,  making  incense  sticks),  vegetable  vending,
6:182:13193:18:18:72:540:534:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:construction work, and rag picking.  SEWA Bank offers savings accounts, individual loan products
6:183:13289:18:17:72:540:516:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(rather than the joint-liability group lending often associated with microcredit), pension accounts,
6:184:13389:17:18:72:540:499:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and other financial products to its clients.  All clients are required to have a savings account and
6:185:13489:18:17:72:338:481:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:roughly a quarter eventually transition into borrowing.4
6:186:13545:17:18:88:539:464:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In the early 2000s, SEWA Bank initiated a five-day financial literacy training program, which
6:187:13638:18:18:71:539:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:used lessons, games, and videos to teach its clients basic accounting skills, interest rate calculations,
6:188:13743:18:17:71:539:428:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the importance of avoiding excess debt, and long-term “life-cycle” planning, among other topics.
6:189:13839:17:18:71:539:411:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:More recently, it started a second five-day course that teaches business skills such as marketing,
6:190:13937:18:18:71:539:393:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cost reduction, investment, and customer service.  Anecdotally, and in line with the bank’s overall
6:191:14036:18:17:71:539:375:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mission  to  serve  and  empower  its  clients,  individualized  business  counseling  occurred  frequently
6:192:14143:17:18:71:179:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:during both programs.
6:193:14164:18:17:88:539:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:To investigate factors influencing female entrepreneurial outcomes, we collaborated with SEWA
6:194:14257:17:18:71:539:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Bank to design a streamlined two-day training module, which combined elements of the existing
6:195:14350:18:18:71:539:305:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:financial  literacy  and  business  skills  curricula,  and  added  new  material  focused  on  aspirations.5
6:196:14459:18:17:71:539:287:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The  two-day  training  module  was  taught  by  the  regular  SEWA  Bank  instructors  who  had  been
6:197:14561:17:18:71:539:270:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:teaching the two five-day financial literacy and business skills classes.  The rationale for combining
6:198:14663:18:17:71:539:252:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:course material across the two courses was that the two types of skills are complementary; many
6:199:14758:17:16:71:539:235:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:self-employed women in this setting do not possess basic numeracy skills, which are clearly valuable
6:200:14858:16:15:84:539:219:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:3SEWA Bank was created in 1974 by Self-Employed Women’s Association, a trade union for poor self-employed
6:201:14963:15:11:72:540:204:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:women based in the city of Ahmedabad.  While formally a trade union, SEWA is an all-around advocacy and support
6:202:15074:11:7:72:459:193:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:group for self-employed women, and banking is one of the services SEWA provides its members.
6:203:15166:7:15:84:539:186:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:4Clients are required to be active savers for at least six months prior to being considered for a loan.  All our study
6:204:15284:15:11:72:540:171:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:clients were loan eligible since we selected study clients from the pool of SEWA clients who had an active savings
6:205:15398:11:7:72:213:160:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:account for the previous two years.
6:206:15433:7:15:84:539:153:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:5SEWA’s  five-day  course  was  based  on  a  well-known  Freedom  from  Hunger  curriculum.   Our  choice  of  how  to
6:207:15552:15:11:72:540:138:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:condense the two five-day trainings into a two-day training (a total of four hours) relied on information from focus
6:208:15668:11:11:72:540:127:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:group discussions with women who had attended SEWA trainings in 2006 in which we asked about training elements
6:209:15778:11:11:72:540:116:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:they found most useful, what they implemented in the short run and what they retained or abandoned in the long
6:210:15888:11:34:72:88:105:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:run.
6:211:15892:34:0:303:308:71:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:?:5
7:212:15893:0:18:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in making sound business decisions (e.g., assessing the returns on a potential investment relative to
7:213:15994:18:18:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the interest rate on a loan that could finance the investment), yet may also lack the ability to create
7:214:16097:18:17:72:540:673:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:business goals to apply these skills to.  We chose to implement a very short,  streamlined course
7:215:16194:17:18:72:540:656:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in order to ascertain whether women’s aspirations and willingness to take up goals (complemented
7:216:16290:18:18:72:540:638:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with a review of skills needed to attain them) could be influenced with an intervention that could
7:217:16388:18:17:72:540:620:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:easily be scaled up.  The two-day module emphasized financial prudence, aimed to raise aspirations,
7:218:16487:17:18:72:439:603:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and provided a structured way to identify and work towards a financial goal.
7:219:16563:18:17:88:539:585:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:To achieve this, women were encouraged to save more and to reduce “frivolous” spending (for
7:220:16654:17:18:72:540:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:example, on tea and snacks).  Women were also shown a short film showcasing the lives of a few
7:221:16748:18:18:72:540:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:successful SEWA members who used good financial practices to bring themselves out of poverty.
7:222:16841:18:17:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Finally, at the end of the first day women received a homework sheet in which they had to identify
7:223:16939:17:18:72:540:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(overnight) a financial goal they would like to achieve over the next six months.  During the second
7:224:17039:18:17:72:540:497:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:day of training, the participants worked in groups to identify steps they could take to achieve their
7:225:17140:17:18:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:goal  such  as  reducing  wasteful  expenditure  and  changing  sub-optimal  business  practices.   They
7:226:17244:18:18:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:completed the worksheet which broke down their goal into smaller achievable steps (the Appendix
7:227:17339:18:17:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:provides  the  worksheet).   The  aim  was  to  motivate  the  women  to  set  their  sights  higher  and  to
7:228:17448:17:18:72:415:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:identify concrete ways to improve their financial and business practices.
7:229:17521:18:18:88:539:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Our  interest  in  women’s  ability  to  implement  these  goals  motivated  our  focus  on  relatively
7:230:17624:18:17:72:540:391:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:short-run (four months post-intervention) outcomes.  To isolate the influence of peer support, we
7:231:17721:17:18:72:540:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:designed the intervention so that a randomly selected half of the participants were invited to come
7:232:17820:18:17:72:540:356:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:alone, while the other half were encouraged to bring a close friend or relative of their own choosing,
7:233:17922:17:18:72:540:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:preferably  someone  who  shared  their  occupation.   To  accomplish  this,  we  asked  women  in  both
7:234:18026:18:18:72:540:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:treatment groups at the outset to name and provide the contact information for three friends, one
7:235:18123:18:17:72:540:303:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of whom might be invited to attend with them.  For women randomly assigned to the treatment-
7:236:18215:17:18:72:540:286:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with-friend group, we subsequently visited a randomly selected friend and invited her to attend the
7:237:18314:18:33:72:176:268:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:same training session.
7:238:18336:33:25:72:251:235:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:2.2    Program Implementation
7:239:18365:25:17:72:540:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Our sample consisted of 636 women age 18 to 50 who had actively saved or borrowed from SEWA
7:240:18456:17:18:72:540:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Bank between December 2004 and January 2006.  We followed a two-stage selection process:  First,
7:241:18552:18:18:72:540:175:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:we selected 435 eligible women from a pool of 1900 SEWA clients for whom a socioeconomic survey,
7:242:18648:18:17:72:540:157:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:which we use for baseline data, had recently been conducted.  Second, in February 2007, we selected
7:243:18747:17:18:72:540:140:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:an additional 201 women from the SEWA Bank customer database (using the eligibility criteria
7:244:18839:18:18:72:400:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:listed above), and conducted a brief baseline survey for these clients.
7:245:18910:18:32:88:539:104:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Of the 636 participants, 212 clients were randomized into the control group, 217 were selected for
7:246:19008:32:0:303:308:72:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:?:6
8:247:19009:0:18:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the first treatment arm – train alone – and 207 were selected for the second treatment arm – train
8:248:19107:18:18:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with a friend.  We followed a two-step stratified randomization procedure:  the first stratification
8:249:19207:18:17:72:540:673:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is provided by the two-stage selection procedure described above (the randomization for the first
8:250:19304:17:18:72:540:656:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:435 women and the additional 201 clients occurred at different times).  Second,  we stratified by
8:251:19401:18:18:72:540:638:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:SEWA branch, with a woman being classified by one of the four bank branches nearest to her home.
8:252:19497:18:17:72:540:620:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Occupation, religion, caste, and other socio-demographic characteristics are often correlated with
8:253:19595:17:18:72:540:603:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the  area  in  which  the  woman  lives,  so  branch  stratification  helped  balance  the  sample  on  these
8:254:19704:18:17:72:540:585:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:characteristics.  In addition, trainings occurred at all four branches (with women recruited for the
8:255:19804:17:18:72:540:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:trainings at their nearest branches).  The overall treatment group, combining both arms, consists
8:256:19901:18:18:72:140:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of 424 women.
8:257:19914:18:17:88:539:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Women  were  randomly  assigned  into  control,  treated  alone,  and  treated  with  friend  groups.
8:258:20015:17:18:72:540:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Surveyors  were  unaware  of  the  individual’s  treatment  status  at  the  time  of  the  baseline  survey.
8:259:20124:18:17:72:540:497:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:After  the  completion  of  the  baseline  survey,  surveyors  were  given  a  list  of  women  to  recruit  for
8:260:20236:17:18:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:training.   Typically,  two  surveyors,  accompanied  by  a  local  SEWA  bank  officer  (“saathi”),  went
8:261:20342:18:18:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to invite each woman in the treatment group.  The woman was informed that many women had
8:262:20430:18:17:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:previously attended business training and had reported benefiting from it.  In addition,  she was
8:263:20527:17:18:72:540:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:informed that she would receive tea and snacks at each training, and if she attended both days of
8:264:20624:18:18:72:540:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the training,  she would receive Rs.  40 to cover her travel expenses.  Women were not otherwise
8:265:20720:18:17:72:540:391:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:financially compensated for attending the training.  During recruitment, the woman was also shown
8:266:20817:17:18:72:540:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a business-training certificate of participation and a photograph of training participants, which she
8:267:20918:18:17:72:540:356:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:would receive upon completion of the training on the second day.  The estimated cost of providing
8:268:21015:17:18:72:540:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the training is Rs. 157 (about four US dollars in 2007) per participant, including the instructor fee,
8:269:21117:18:18:72:437:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:classroom costs, recruitment, and snacks and transportation reimbursement.
8:270:21191:18:17:88:539:303:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Each study client invited for the training was informed that one of her friends may be invited to
8:271:21288:17:18:72:540:286:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the same training if enough spots were available.  She was then asked to list the names, occupations,
8:272:21389:18:17:72:540:268:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and addresses of three friends, two from her occupation and one with a different occupation.  For
8:273:21486:17:18:72:540:251:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:women in the treatment-with-friend group, we randomly selected one of the three friends listed and
8:274:21584:18:18:72:501:233:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a surveyor visited the woman’s friend and invited her to attend the same training session.
8:275:21674:18:17:88:539:215:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We had a single instructor team, and thus training sessions rotated among the four locations,
8:276:21767:17:18:72:540:198:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with the order and schedule determined by classroom availability in the SEWA branches.  Women
8:277:21860:18:17:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:were  recruited  to  attend  a  particular  training  session  at  their  nearest  SEWA  branch.   Typically
8:278:21968:17:18:72:540:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:eight study participants were invited for training per session – four from the treatment-alone group
8:279:22068:18:18:72:540:145:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and four from the treatment-with-friend group.  Actual attendance was, therefore, up to twelve if
8:280:22165:18:16:72:540:127:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:all study participants attended and those eligible to do so brought friends.6The morning of the
8:281:22260:16:39:84:539:111:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:6Toward the end of the intervention, nine or ten women were often recruited, including women who were unable
8:282:22368:39:0:303:308:72:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:?:7
9:283:22369:0:18:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:training, the recruiters would return to the women’s homes to remind them about the training later
9:284:22467:18:18:72:490:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that afternoon.  Those who had telephones were also phoned as an additional reminder.
9:285:22552:18:17:88:539:673:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In total, we conducted 57 two-day training sessions over an eight-month period from September
9:286:22645:17:18:72:540:656:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:2006 to April 2007,  and 292 women from the sample attended training.  In the estimation,  each
9:287:22740:18:18:72:540:638:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:woman’s  randomly  assigned  treatment  status  rather  than  her  attendance  at  training  is  used  to
9:288:22845:18:17:72:210:620:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:identify the program effects.7
9:289:22875:17:18:88:539:603:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:For analysis purposes, the 212 women who were randomized into the control group were assigned
9:290:22968:18:17:72:540:585:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to a training session.  We followed the same protocol as for the treatment group and assigned control
9:291:23069:17:18:72:540:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:women to a treatment session at their nearest SEWA location.  In 32% of groups, we assigned three
9:292:23166:18:18:72:540:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:control members, in 65% we assigned four control members, and in the remaining 3% (two groups),
9:293:23261:18:17:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:five  control  participants  were  assigned  per  group.   For  the  follow-up  survey,  control  group  and
9:294:23369:17:18:72:540:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:treatment clients in the same session were surveyed at the same time.  In our regression analysis
9:295:23466:18:33:72:292:497:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:we cluster standard errors by training session.
9:296:23513:33:25:72:131:464:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:2.3    Data
9:297:23524:25:17:72:540:439:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Our  analysis  makes  use  of  three  data  sources:   a  baseline  survey,  a  follow-up  survey  after  the
9:298:23633:17:18:72:540:422:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:intervention, and SEWA Bank administrative data.  We have administrative data for the full sample
9:299:23730:18:17:72:144:404:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:of 636 women.8
9:300:23744:17:18:88:539:387:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The baseline survey was administered to the original sample of 435 women in early 2006.  The
9:301:23836:18:18:72:540:369:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:supplementary sample of 201 clients received a separate short baseline survey;  for the treatment
9:302:23933:18:17:72:540:351:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:group, the survey was conducted at the same visit when the woman was recruited for training, and
9:303:24029:17:18:72:540:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for the control group, it was conducted (without recruitment) at a similar time.  Columns (1)–(3)
9:304:24126:18:17:72:540:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of Table 1 report descriptive statistics from the baseline survey, separately for the control and two
9:305:24227:17:18:72:149:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:treatment arms.
9:306:24242:18:18:88:539:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The average age of women in the sample is 35 years.  A little less than 90% are married, and
9:307:24334:18:17:72:540:263:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:about 30% are Muslim (most of the others are Hindu).  About 76% of the women are literate and
9:308:24427:17:18:72:540:246:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:have an average of 6.4 years of education.  Over 83% are employed in a household enterprise or
9:309:24521:18:18:72:540:228:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in a piece rate activity such as stitching, and 7% are housewives.  Our study participants live in
9:310:24619:18:17:72:540:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:households with an average of 5.3 occupants and Rs. 5717 monthly income.  For roughly half our
9:311:24713:17:18:72:540:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sample, a portion of that household income is earned from a household enterprise. The demographic
9:312:24810:18:19:72:540:175:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:profile of our study clients is similar to microfinance borrowers and microentrepreneurs in other
9:313:24907:19:7:72:277:156:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:to attend during the beginning of the intervention.
9:314:24958:7:15:84:539:149:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:7We observe the following deviations between intended training and actual training status:  two women from the
9:315:25068:15:11:72:540:134:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:control group were mistakenly recruited and attended the training, one with a friend.  In addition, three women from
9:316:25184:11:7:72:540:123:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:the treatment arm with no friend invited a friend to attend.  12 women in the treatment-with-friend arm came alone.
9:317:25299:7:15:84:539:116:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:8Since the publication of Field, Jayachandran, and Pande (2010), we have obtained SEWA Bank administrative
9:318:25405:15:30:72:225:101:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:data for the full sample of 636 clients.
9:319:25445:30:0:303:308:71:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:?:8
10:320:25446:0:18:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:parts of India.  Like clients in Hyderabad (Banerjee,  Duflo,  Glennerster,  and Kinnan, 2015) and
10:321:25544:18:18:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Kolkata (Field, Pande, Papp, and Rigol, 2013), the median household lives on approximately two
10:322:25638:18:17:72:540:673:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to three dollars per day, households have an average of five members, and approximately half the
10:323:25734:17:18:72:539:656:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:households operate a household business.9The composition of household enterprises is also very
10:324:25828:18:18:71:539:638:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:similar, with tailoring and stitching services dominating.  One important distinction may be that
10:325:25925:18:17:71:539:620:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:women in Ahmedabad,  Gujarat face stricter social norms,  although we lack comparable data to
10:326:26018:17:18:71:113:603:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:test this.
10:327:26028:18:17:88:539:585:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The follow-up survey occurred on a rolling basis, typically four months after a participant was
10:328:26123:17:18:71:539:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:recruited to attend her training event.  All clients assigned to a training session, both treatment
10:329:26222:18:18:71:539:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and control, were administered the survey at the same time, and the survey was completed for 604
10:330:26318:18:17:71:540:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:women.  The low attrition rate of 5% was similar across the three groups.10The follow-up survey
10:331:26413:17:18:72:483:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:gathers data on income, business practices, labor supply, and household expenditures.
10:332:26498:18:17:88:539:497:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Several  factors  are  likely  to  have  contributed  to  the  relatively  high  rate  of  retention  when
10:333:26604:17:18:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:compared to training programs evaluated in other studies.11First, a relatively short time elapsed
10:334:26701:18:18:71:539:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:between the training and the survey (4.3 months on average).  Second, our study clients belonged
10:335:26797:18:17:71:539:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to a large organization with which the clients maintained ties even after the study was complete.
10:336:26894:17:18:71:514:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Finally, SEWA maintains up-to-date records of its members which facilitated client tracking.
10:337:26986:18:18:88:539:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:SEWA Bank’s administrative data, which tracks clients’ account activity on a transaction level,
10:338:27081:18:17:71:539:391:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:provides information on whether the client took out a loan from SEWA after the training and for
10:339:27176:17:18:71:539:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:what purpose, which we use as outcome measures.  To create a comparable measure from survey
10:340:27267:18:33:71:406:356:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:data, we consider the four-month span after each client’s training day.

10:348:27905:14:11:72:540:169:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:SEWA, Village Financial Services, the MFI studied by the authors, has no savings component to participation and
10:349:28016:11:8:72:329:158:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:clients of the MFI are therefore strictly interested in borrowing.
10:350:28082:8:14:80:539:150:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:10The composition by treatment status for the follow-up survey was 205 from treat-alone group, 200 from the treat

11:365:29265:17:18:72:540:510:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:control groups are balanced along baseline characteristics, with two exceptions:  treatment clients

11:368:29571:17:18:72:540:457:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:differences in some variables, while insignificant, are moderately large in magnitude and possibly

11:371:29880:18:18:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are statistically identical.  While our main analysis focuses on the pure experimental estimates, in

11:374:30084:29:18:72:540:318:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In  this  section  we  examine  program  impacts  four  months  after  the  training  occurred.   We  start
11:375:30191:18:17:72:540:300:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:by examining program take-up and then turn to program impacts on participants’ financial and
11:376:30283:17:18:72:540:283:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:business behavior and household economic outcomes.  Given evidence that impacts varied by par-
11:377:30377:18:17:72:540:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ticipants’  peer  treatment  status,  we  next  examine  additional  outcomes  to  gain  some  insight  on
11:378:30483:17:18:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:channels.  Finally,  motivated by the patterns in the data we ask whether women who belong to
11:379:30576:18:33:72:502:230:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:castes that place stronger strictures on mobility benefited differentially from the program.

12:390:31405:17:18:88:539:656:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Throughout, we focus on intention-to-treat (ITT) estimates.  One may be concerned by differ-

12:392:31596:18:17:72:540:620:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Column (1) in Table 2 Panel A reports weak evidence that peer-treatment had a stronger effect on

12:395:31887:17:18:72:539:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:has  a  p-value  of  0.115.14Those  who  selected  into  training,  in  general,  likely  faced  fewer  social
12:396:31997:18:18:72:540:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:restrictions – they were older, more likely to be married and live in larger households (the last may
12:397:32098:18:17:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:reflect age and marital status differences) and more likely to belong to a lower castes (scheduled
12:398:32196:17:18:72:540:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:caste).  Later in this section, we directly examine whether impacts vary by social restrictions faced
12:399:32297:18:17:72:540:497:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:by the woman (as proxied by her caste).  Finally, there are no differences in observable character-
12:400:32396:17:34:72:400:480:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:istics of those who trained alone and those who trained with peers.15

12:404:32612:18:17:88:539:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In columns (1)-(6),  we consider clients’ borrowing behavior (regarding both SEWA and non-

12:406:32796:18:18:72:540:351:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f4:B:differential effect for theTreat  with  Friendgroup.  In column (1) we see that women in theTreat
12:407:32893:18:17:72:540:333:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f2:B:with  Friendgroup  are  seven  percentage  points  more  likely  to  take  out  a  loan  (Panel  A),  which
12:408:33000:17:18:72:540:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:amounts to a doubling of the rate of loan take-up.  Once we average across treatment status, in
12:409:33095:18:17:72:540:298:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Panel  B  we  see  an  overall  increase  of  5  percentage  points  in  the  likelihood  of  taking  out  a  loan
12:410:33209:17:18:72:540:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f4:B:from SEWA . The fact that the increase in loan incidence is concentrated amongTreat with Friend
12:411:33304:18:18:72:540:263:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:women suggests that this impact cannot be attributed to general program features, such as more
12:412:33398:18:17:72:540:245:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:information about SEWA loans, or to a belief among participants that training makes one more
12:413:33490:17:18:72:158:228:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:eligible for a loan.

12:416:33710:15:11:72:540:179:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:assigned to be treated alone but attended a training meeting with a friend.  Conditional on attending the first day,
12:417:33826:11:7:72:206:168:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:over 97% completed the training.

12:419:33981:14:11:72:540:147:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:treatment effects.  To check this, we estimated treatment-on-treated effects where we instrumented for take-up with

13:426:34500:18:17:72:540:673:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rates  are  identical  across  loan  categories;  therefore  clients  do  not  face  incentives  to  misreport
13:427:34610:17:18:72:539:656:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:purpose  of  loan  when  filing  their  application.16The  administrative  data  show  that  two  thirds
13:428:34714:18:18:72:540:638:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of the increased loan-taking was for business or house repair loans, with the remaining one third
13:429:34811:18:17:72:540:620:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:covering education, marriage, jewelry, and other expenses.  In column (2) of Table 3, we see that the
13:430:34912:17:18:72:539:603:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:increase in business loans is concentrated among theTreat with Friendgroup while, in column (3),
13:431:35008:18:17:72:540:585:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:house repair loan increases occur for both treatment groups.  Many women operate their businesses
13:432:35105:17:18:72:540:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from home, so the home versus business use are not mutually exclusive.  The training, therefore,
13:433:35201:18:18:72:540:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:could have had the level effect of inducing both types of treatment clients to take out home-repair
13:434:35300:18:17:72:539:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:loans  for  general  improvement  of  the  business.   Yet  clients  in  theTreat  with  Friendgroup  were
13:435:35406:17:18:72:366:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:additionally more likely to incur other business-specific loans.
13:436:35470:18:17:88:539:497:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We lack administrative data on the amount borrowed and therefore rely on self-reported loan
13:437:35561:17:18:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:amounts (column 4).  Consistent with the administrative data, total amount borrowed increases by
13:438:35657:18:18:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:about Rs. 1219, but the treatment-specific estimates in Panel A are noisy.  In column (5) we see that
13:439:35758:18:17:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the  total  amount  borrowed  from  non-SEWA  sources,  including  formal  and informal  lenders,  did
13:440:35860:17:18:72:540:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:not change significantly.  In interpreting the differential impact on SEWA and non-SEWA loans, it
13:441:35957:18:18:72:540:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is worth noting that training-induced exposure to SEWA loan products cannot explain differential

13:443:36147:17:18:72:539:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that,  conditional  on  the  training  raising  the  demand  for  loans  in  theTreat  with  Friendgroup,
13:444:36252:18:17:72:540:356:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:SEWA loans were preferable to loans from other formal or informal lenders:  clients already had a

13:446:36441:18:18:72:540:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:APR, the loans were offered at competitive rates.  It is also the case that SEWA is by far the largest
13:447:36543:18:17:72:540:303:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:- and arguably only - formal loan provider available to women of this income level at the time of the
13:448:36644:17:18:72:540:286:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:study.  Reassuringly, column (6) (from survey data) shows that clients in neither treatment group
13:449:36741:18:17:72:540:268:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:report greater problems repaying their loans.  This suggests that the training did not encourage
13:450:36837:17:18:72:349:251:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:clients to enter into an excessive amount of business debt.
13:451:36896:18:18:88:539:233:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Columns (7) - (10) use survey data to examine the treatment effects on savings.  The survey
13:452:36987:18:17:72:540:215:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:only asked about savings behavior over the previous 30 days and we use this data to construct four
13:453:37085:17:18:72:540:198:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:outcome variables:  the probability of making a deposit into their SEWA savings account (column
13:454:37180:18:16:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:7), the total amount deposited in their SEWA savings account (column 8), the probability of making
13:455:37278:16:15:80:539:164:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:16In the administrative data, we observe four loan products used by clients: business loans (most common), housing
13:456:37392:15:11:72:540:149:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:loans, unsecured loans (used for any purpose), and overdraft facility.  These loans carried an 18% annual percentage
13:457:37508:11:11:72:540:138:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:rate (APR) if below Rs. 25,000 and 18.5% APR if above, with loans sizes varying individually (we do not observe
13:458:37619:11:11:72:540:127:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:this or information on tenure or repayment schedules).  We do recognize that it is likely that some fraction of clients
13:459:37738:11:45:72:498:116:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:redirect their loan amount to other immediate needs that they had not anticipated while filing their loan.

14:461:37846:0:18:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a deposit into their non-SEWA savings account (column 9),  the total amount deposited in their
14:462:37940:18:18:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:non- SEWA savings account (column 10).17Overall, we do not observe any significant treatment
14:463:38032:18:17:72:261:673:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:effects on participants’ saving behavior.
14:464:38073:17:18:88:539:656:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Several hypotheses arise to explain the change in borrowing but not in savings behavior, despite
14:465:38169:18:18:72:540:638:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the fact that the latter and not the former was emphasized in the training.18First, some savings
14:466:38265:18:17:72:540:620:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:responses may be unobservable in our data:  in our survey clients only reported on deposits made
14:467:38361:17:18:72:540:603:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:into formal savings accounts (SEWA and non SEWA). It is possible that treatment clients finance
14:468:38456:18:17:72:540:585:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:business investment through informal savings (e.g.  savings at home),  and this behavior may be
14:469:38551:17:18:72:540:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:particularly  likely  when  savings  are  reinvested  quickly  into  business  activities.   In  addition,  our
14:470:38662:18:18:72:540:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:survey only asks about savings in the last thirty days; increases in savings may have occurred soon
14:471:38761:18:17:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:after training and, therefore, fall outside the recall period of the question.  (In contrast, we observe
14:472:38865:17:18:72:386:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:all new loans in the four months between training and follow-up.)
14:473:38930:18:17:88:539:497:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Second,  it  is  possible  that  –  in  the  presence  of  differences  in  outstanding  debt  between  the
14:474:39037:17:18:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:treatment and control group – theabsenceof a lower rate of savings among the treatment group
14:475:39129:18:18:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:indicates  a  higher  propensity  to  save.   Put  differently,  the  fact  that  treatment  clients  are  not
14:476:39239:18:17:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:making fewer savings deposits despite making more loan payments is consistent with the view that
14:477:39335:17:18:72:540:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:treatment increased the propensity to save.  Another way to see this is that the total amount of
14:478:39431:18:18:72:540:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:income that the client is putting aside from earnings to potentially finance investments appears to
14:479:39530:18:17:72:540:391:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:be higher among treatment clients.  Below, in Table 4, column (2) we report the outcome variable:
14:480:39627:17:18:72:540:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:how much of respondent’s monthly income was set aside for business investment.  Although noisy,
14:481:39722:18:17:72:540:356:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the point estimate implies that business spending was twice as high in the peer treatment group.
14:482:39818:17:18:72:540:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Since the survey was conducted several months after the training, it is possible that differences in
14:483:39918:18:18:72:366:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:investment were even larger very soon after the course ended.
14:484:39979:18:17:88:539:303:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, in terms of why some clients clearly preferred to finance business investments via bor-
14:485:40075:17:18:72:540:286:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rowing rather than saving,  we can only speculate,  but there are many potential explanations in
14:486:40171:18:17:72:540:268:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the literature.  For instance, it is possible that loans provided a necessary commitment device to
14:487:40269:17:34:72:350:251:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:address interpersonal or intrahousehold barriers to saving.
14:488:40328:34:24:72:210:217:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:3.3    Business Behavior
14:489:40352:24:18:72:540:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Given  that  treatment  induced  women  to  incur  more  business  loans,  in  Table  4  we  examine  the
14:490:40457:18:16:72:307:175:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:effects of the training on their business activities.
14:491:40510:16:15:80:539:159:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:17The administrative data that we received from SEWA was incomplete and did not contain data on loan or savings
14:492:40621:15:7:72:108:144:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:balances.
14:493:40630:7:15:80:539:137:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:18Note that the observed null, albeit noisy, effect on savings pushes against a reporting bias interpretation of survey
14:494:40749:15:11:72:540:122:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:reports, since in that case we may have expected social desirability to lead treated respondents to inflate their savings
14:495:40870:11:39:72:109:111:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:behavior.
14:496:40879:39:0:300:311:72:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:?:13
15:497:40881:0:18:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We first consider direct labor and capital inputs.  In column (1) Panel B, we see that treated
15:498:40975:18:18:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:clients increased their labor supply by four hours per week, which corresponds to a 17% increase.
15:499:41072:18:17:72:540:673:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f2:B:Treat  with  Friendclients show slightly but insignificantly larger increases in hours worked.  The
15:500:41171:17:18:72:540:656:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:survey did not gather information on all business assets; rather survey respondents were asked how
15:501:41269:18:18:72:540:638:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:much of their monthly earnings they set aside for business investment.  We use this as the outcome
15:502:41367:18:17:72:539:620:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:variable in column 2.  The point estimates onTreated  with  Friendimplies that business spending
15:503:41463:17:18:72:540:603:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in this group was twice as high as amongTreat Aloneclients, although the effect is only significant
15:504:41562:18:17:72:152:585:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:at the 17% level.
15:505:41579:17:18:88:539:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The training program helped women think strategically about their businesses and set short-run
15:506:41673:18:18:72:540:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:business goals. Our survey asked women whether they had taken concrete actions to expand revenue
15:507:41769:18:17:72:539:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and reduce costs.19Revenue expansion activities included seeking to increase the number of clients
15:508:41867:17:18:71:539:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:or expanding the range of products sold. We also asked them about their plans to undertake revenue
15:509:41965:18:17:71:539:497:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:increasing activities.  On the cost side, we asked about spending activities including investing in
15:510:42064:17:18:71:539:480:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:new equipment or changing suppliers.  We symmetrically construct indices for revenues and costs
15:511:42159:18:18:71:539:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(both actions and plans) using the first component of a principal component analysis, and report
15:512:42255:18:17:71:539:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f4:B:these  in  columns  (3)-  (6).   In  columns  (3)  and  (4),  respectively,  we  find  thatTreat  with  Friend
15:513:42365:17:18:72:540:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:clients are significantly more likely to report concrete actions and moderately more likely to report
15:514:42466:18:18:72:540:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:plans to increase business revenues.  On the other hand, we do not observe any changes in business
15:515:42564:18:17:72:328:391:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:activities that aim to reduce costs (columns 5 and 6).
15:516:42618:17:18:88:539:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Finally,  we  consider  two  measures  of  business  output.   Clients  were  asked  whether,  in  the
15:517:42720:18:17:72:540:356:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:previous week, they had sold more, the same number, or fewer items (products or services) than in
15:518:42817:17:18:72:540:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a typical week in the year prior.  Column (7) reports the ordered logit regression for this outcome
15:519:42916:18:18:72:540:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:variable, with the value “1” signifying clients sold less, “2” clients sold the same, and “3” clients
15:520:43017:18:17:72:540:303:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sold more than the previous year.  Panel B shows that, on average, the treatment has no significant
15:521:43116:17:18:72:539:286:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f4:B:effect.  However, decomposing by treatment arms in Panel A , we observe thatTreat  with  Friend
15:522:43211:18:17:72:540:268:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:clients are more likely to report a higher volume of sales relative to a typical week in the previous
15:523:43312:17:18:72:95:251:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:year.
15:524:43317:18:18:88:539:233:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Finally,  clients  reported  business  revenue  over  the  past  week  along  with  the  number  of  cus-
15:525:43422:18:17:72:540:215:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tomers, products sold, services provided, items completed, or contracts taken over the past week.
15:526:43519:17:18:72:540:198:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Because  volume  of  business  activity  is  inconsistently  reported  (each  respondent  chose  to  report
15:527:43626:18:17:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:using whichever one of those five measures most appropriately captured volume of business activity
15:528:43724:17:18:72:540:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for their business), we decompose the survey question into five separate variables pertaining to vol-

15:530:43920:17:14:80:539:128:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:19It is worth noting that several changes to business behavior that could have increased revenues such as increasing
15:531:44036:14:11:72:540:114:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:labor supply, searching out lower cost suppliers, and adding variety to one’s product mix (say as a tailor), do not
15:532:44151:11:31:72:178:103:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:require additional outlays.

16:534:44180:0:18:72:390:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:any significant changes in the treatment groups relative to control.
16:535:44248:18:18:88:539:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The difference in results on sales volume (column 7) and revenue measures (column 8) could
16:536:44338:18:17:72:540:673:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:reflect several factors.  First, since clients could only report one measure of business volume in our
16:537:44440:17:18:72:540:656:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:revenue question (e.g.  number of customers or services),  we may lack a comprehensive measure
16:538:44534:18:18:72:540:638:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that  incorporates  marginal  business  activities.   Alternatively,  the  lack  of  a  uniform  indicator  of
16:539:44644:18:17:72:540:620:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:volume  may  make  the  index  too  noisy  to  detect  small  changes  in  quantity.   Second,  it  could  be
16:540:44753:17:18:72:540:603:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that rather than increasing the volume of business activities, clients focused on diversifying their
16:541:44853:18:17:72:540:585:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:business activities, giving their customers more product and service options than in the previous
16:542:44950:17:18:72:539:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:year.  This is consistent with our earlier finding (columns 3 and 4) thatTreat  with  Friendclients
16:543:45049:18:18:71:240:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:report revenue expansion activities.
16:544:45085:18:17:88:539:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Overall, our findings suggest that the increased business borrowing byTreat with Friendclients
16:545:45179:17:18:71:539:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(Table 3, column 2) was accompanied by activities aimed at expanding business revenues possibly
16:546:45274:18:33:71:220:497:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:by diversifying their sales base.

16:548:45349:25:17:71:539:439:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:To more directly measure the effect of training on client well-being, in Table 5 we examine total

16:553:45836:18:18:72:540:351:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f7:B:indistinguishable from the control in terms of income and expenditures:  the coefficients onTreated

16:555:45976:17:18:88:539:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:As the training program targeted female SEWA participants, we next ask whether these women
16:556:46066:18:17:72:540:298:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f4:B:contributed  to  the  significant  increase  in  household  income  and  expenditures  in  theTreat  with
16:557:46171:17:18:72:539:281:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f2:B:Friendgroup.  We consider client-specific earnings and occupational outcomes in columns (3) and
16:558:46266:18:18:72:540:263:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(4).   The  extensive  margin  of  whether  the  client  earns  an  income  is  unaffected;  the  coefficients
16:559:46376:18:17:72:540:245:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on the treatment variables are close to zero in both Panels A and B of column (3).  However, in
16:560:46471:17:18:72:540:228:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:column (4) we observe thatTreat  with  Friendclients are 4 percentage points less likely to report
16:561:46569:18:17:72:382:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:their occupation as housewife four months after the intervention.
16:562:46634:17:18:88:539:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:These findings suggest that the intervention incentivized women in theTreat with Friendgroup
16:563:46726:18:18:72:540:175:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to either take up self employment or to recognize the value of their work such that they no longer saw

16:567:47159:11:44:72:164:116:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:and religious expenses.

17:569:47184:0:18:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:more likely to report having earned an income would be consistent with the latter interpretation
17:570:47280:18:18:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:or  with  clients  joining  an  already-existing  household  business  (as  family  members  often  are  not
17:571:47388:18:17:72:456:673:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:directly compensated for their labor in household enterprises (Benjamin, 1992)).
17:572:47468:17:18:88:539:656:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The intervention – at least at the four-month mark after treatment – appears to be welfare-
17:573:47559:18:18:72:539:638:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:improving forTreat with Friendclients, as they have higher levels of consumption and are no more
17:574:47655:18:17:72:540:620:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:likely to report problems repaying the loan or cite lower confidence (Table 6).  Our SEWA Bank

17:576:47859:18:17:72:540:585:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:default.  This means that we cannot comment on whether clients face problems later in the loan

17:578:48054:18:33:72:184:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:increases social welfare.

17:580:48107:25:18:72:540:492:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We have provided evidence of the causal impact of being trained with a friend versus being trained
17:581:48205:18:17:72:540:474:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:alone on an array of economic outcomes.  Having documented an important role for peers, a natural
17:582:48302:17:18:72:540:457:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:next question relates to the channels of influence.  A first hypothesis is that the training played no
17:583:48404:18:17:72:540:439:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:substantive role in fostering peer effects other than to serve as encouragement to take-up microcre-
17:584:48504:17:18:72:540:422:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:dit, with the invited-with-friend treatment being a more effective encouragement treatment.  This
17:585:48601:18:18:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is  unlikely  to  be  the  case:  the  increase  in  borrowing  associated  with  treatment  occurred  among
17:586:48709:18:17:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a  relatively  small  subset  of  treated  individuals  (5  percentage  point  effect  off  of  a  base  of  6  per-
17:587:48825:17:18:72:540:369:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cent); yet, when we estimate median regressions for household income and expenditure, we observe
17:588:48921:18:18:72:540:351:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:coefficients  similar  to  those  from  the  OLS  estimates.21This  suggests  that  the  training  impacts
17:589:49027:18:17:72:540:333:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:extended beyond the subset that responded by taking up a loan.22Thus, in this section, we focus
17:590:49122:17:18:72:540:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on  mechanisms  that  explain  how  the  presence  of  peers  could  have  substantively  influenced  how
17:591:49227:18:17:72:230:298:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:clients responded to the training.
17:592:49261:17:18:88:539:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We should note upfront that our field experiment varied whether clients were trained alone or
17:593:49354:18:18:72:540:263:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with a peer, but otherwise we followed an identical recruitment process for all clients.  In addition,
17:594:49456:18:17:72:540:245:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the  various  elements  of  the  training  program  were  held  constant  across  clients.   These  factors
17:595:49563:17:18:72:540:228:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:limit  our  ability  to  provide  causal  evidence  on  the  mechanisms  through  which  peers  influenced
17:596:49669:18:17:72:540:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:participants’ training outcomes.  Our approach, therefore, is to exploit survey data on individual
17:597:49767:17:16:72:540:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:behavior and heterogeneity in individual demographics to provide suggestive evidence on channels

17:599:49900:11:15:80:539:166:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:22Another way to check for the possibility that the loan take-up is driving the remaining results is to control for
17:600:50015:15:11:72:540:151:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:having  a  loan  as  an  additional  regressor  and  see  if  it  “knocks  out”  the  treatment  effect  on  other  outcomes;  this
17:601:50146:11:11:72:540:140:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:test,  while relying on an endogenous control,  can help us gauge whether the effect of the treatment on loans and
17:602:50260:11:11:72:540:129:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:the (non-causal) correlation of loan take-up and income or expenditures are large enough to explain the income and
17:603:50374:11:11:72:540:118:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:expenditure effects.  We find that they are not;  controlling for loan take-up,  we continue to see a similar effect of
17:604:50493:11:36:72:251:107:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:peer-treatment on income and expenditures.

18:612:50978:17:18:72:540:581:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that  female  business  networks  are  important  determinants  of  entrepreneurial  decisions  in  India
18:613:51083:18:18:72:540:563:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(Ghani, Kerr, and O’Connell, 2013).  In our setting, it is reasonable to posit that training with a
18:614:51182:18:17:72:540:545:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:peer widened or strengthened the non-familial business network that our counseling participants
18:615:51277:17:18:72:489:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:had access to.  In Table 6 we examine the evidence on the potential associated benefits.
18:616:51365:18:18:88:539:510:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:A first channel is sharing financial resources through the network.  In column (1), the outcome
18:617:51460:18:17:72:540:492:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of  interest  is  whether  the  household  has  a  loan  from  a  friend  or  family  member  during  the  last
18:618:51571:17:18:72:540:475:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:four months.  Treated women are more likely to report having a loan from friends or family, but
18:619:51666:18:17:72:540:457:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:peer-treated clients are no more likely to financially leverage their informal network.  It is possible
18:620:51769:17:18:72:540:440:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that greater risk-sharing or favor-trading between peer treated clients and their friends could also
18:621:51869:18:18:72:540:422:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:have  taken  a  different  manifestation,  for  example,  through  more  transfers  or  through  starting
18:622:51974:18:17:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:joint  business  ventures.   Unfortunately,  we  lack  information  on  transfers  or  on  direct  business
18:623:52081:17:18:72:540:387:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:interactions with peers.  However, we would conjecture that it is unlikely that peers gave a large
18:624:52179:18:17:72:540:369:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:enough compensation to explain the observed effects; such a channel would also require that making
18:625:52277:17:18:72:473:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:transfers and receiving loans are complements, which seems unlikely in this context.

18:627:52460:18:17:72:540:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:multiple forms.  First, women who attended with a friend may have been able to further discuss
18:628:52554:17:18:72:539:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and internalize the material being taught in the classes.24If this is the case,  we could see that
18:629:52652:18:18:72:539:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:treated-with-friend women follow the advice given in the class more closely.25This effect may be
18:630:52748:18:17:72:540:263:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:especially strong in our sample since study participants were asked to name which friends to invite.
18:631:52848:17:18:72:540:246:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In column (2) we examine whether clients are keeping formal accounts – a concrete skill taught in
18:632:52945:18:17:72:540:228:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the training – and find no evidence that this outcome was affected by the training for either clients
18:633:53046:17:18:72:367:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:who were treated alone or those who were treated with peers.
18:634:53106:18:17:88:539:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:A different measure of information sharing,  which we examine in column (3),  is whether the

18:636:53273:10:15:80:539:166:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:24There is extensive literature documenting the importance of peers in the classroom learning process (see Epple
18:637:53385:15:11:72:540:151:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:and Romano (2011) for a review of the literature).  For example, using students’ self-reported friend network, Lin
18:638:53499:11:7:72:528:140:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:(2010) finds that the presence of high quality peers benefits a student’s educational outcomes such as their GPA.
18:639:53612:7:15:80:539:133:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:25Our assignment rule sought to place an identical number (four) of treated alone and peer-treated clients in each
18:640:53726:15:11:72:540:118:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:training session.  However, sampling variation implies that, a peer-treated woman was placed in a class with an on
18:641:53840:11:36:72:478:107:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:average 4% larger class size.  This very small difference in class size is unlikely drive observed effects.

19:645:54147:18:17:72:540:673:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:we cannot rule out the possibility that peer-treated and treated-alone clients differentially switched
19:646:54249:17:18:72:540:656:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the composition of with whom they discussed business.  We are also unable to measure differences
19:647:54345:18:18:72:540:638:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the quality of these interactions across clients exposed to different training environments.  Also,
19:648:54447:18:17:72:540:620:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:we only asked about daily communications, and it is possible that those in the treatment group
19:649:54541:17:18:72:461:603:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:increased their business discussions but at a frequency higher or lower than daily.
19:650:54624:18:17:88:539:585:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:A third way in which peers may have mattered is by supporting each other’s aspirations and
19:651:54714:17:18:72:540:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:raising their confidence.  The training program explicitly sought to raise business aspirations in var-
19:652:54817:18:18:72:540:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ious ways, including by showing clients a movie on successful female entrepreneurs and encouraging
19:653:54915:18:17:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:savings for goals.  Women who were invited to attend with peers may have found themselves in
19:654:55007:17:18:72:540:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a more comfortable and supportive environment which facilitated the effectiveness of the training
19:655:55104:18:17:72:540:497:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:at raising aspirations.  At follow-up, women were asked seven questions to ascertain their level of
19:656:55203:17:18:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:confidence.26These seven measures were combined into a confidence index using the first compo-
19:657:55297:18:18:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:nent of a principal component analysis.  Column (4) shows that neither treatment influenced the
19:658:55392:18:17:72:416:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:reported confidence levels of participants four months post-intervention.
19:659:55465:17:18:88:539:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Finally,  we examine whether training with peers helped women set higher goals in the short
19:660:55556:18:18:72:540:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:run.  Some suggestive evidence comes from the goal worksheets filled out by women at the end of
19:661:55651:18:17:72:540:391:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the first day of training.  (The Appendix describes the data collected).  These worksheets, which
19:662:55748:17:18:72:540:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:were to be filled out at home, gave clients who attended both days the opportunity to identify a
19:663:55844:18:17:72:540:356:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:financial goal they wished to achieve.  On the second day,  methods for achieving that goal were
19:664:55940:17:18:72:540:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:reviewed with the group and the trainers.  We were able to retrieve the goal sheets for only a subset
19:665:56041:18:18:72:540:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of the clients trained, and examine stated goals in columns (5)–(7).  (Since the control group clients
19:666:56143:18:17:72:540:303:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:did not fill out goal sheets, our sample consists of women in the treatment arms and the omitted
19:667:56239:17:18:72:540:286:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:category in the regressions is the treated-alone arm.)  The reduced sample size limits the precision
19:668:56339:18:17:72:540:268:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and interpretability of estimated treatment effects.  The two most common goal categories were to
19:669:56436:17:18:72:540:251:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:start or expand a business (column 5) and to buy/repair a house (column 6).  The latter would often
19:670:56535:18:18:72:540:233:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:entail converting a room in the house to a business or shop location.27Reported goals match the
19:671:56630:18:17:72:539:215:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f4:B:observed loan demand in Table 3, and we find weak evidence that clients in theTreat with Friend
19:672:56725:17:16:72:540:198:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:group are more likely to set business goals.  Moreover, consistent with these clients setting more
19:673:56823:16:15:80:539:182:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:26The seven questions were:  (1) “Are you confident about countering problems that arise in your day-to-day life?”
19:674:56937:15:11:72:540:167:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:(2) “Are you confident about countering problems that arise in your work life?”  (3) “Do you think that with hard
19:675:57050:11:11:72:540:156:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:work you will be able to succeed?”  (4) “Are you satisfied with your personal life?”  (5) “Are you satisfied with your
19:676:57168:11:11:72:540:145:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:work?”  (6) “Are you comfortable calculating your business costs?”  (7) “How optimistic are you about the future?”

19:678:57357:7:15:80:539:127:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:27Examples of goals include “To open a shop; to take more catering orders to increase income,” and “ To open my

20:682:57632:18:18:72:85:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:8).
20:683:57635:18:17:88:539:673:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, it is possible that some of the observed differences in behavior across treatment arms
20:684:57730:17:18:72:540:656:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:reflects spillovers.  First, there could be negative impacts on those trained alone of being trained in
20:685:57833:18:18:72:540:638:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the presence of others with friends.  For instance, participants who come alone may be less likely to
20:686:57934:18:17:72:540:620:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:talk to anyone during the training if other participants in their group already know one another,
20:687:58031:17:18:72:379:603:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:compared to a scenario where every participant had come alone.
20:688:58093:18:17:88:539:585:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:So did peer effects matter in part because of the disadvantage they confer to non-networked
20:689:58184:17:18:72:540:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:individuals?  In the context of our experiment, one way of assessing this is to exploit variation in
20:690:58284:18:18:72:540:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the  number  ofTreat  with  Friendclients  assigned  per  group.   We  estimate  regressions  where  we
20:691:58387:18:17:71:539:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:exclude clients in theTreat with Friendgroup and ask whether treatment effects for clients treated
20:692:58485:17:18:72:540:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:alone  (relative  to  the  control  group)  vary  with  the  fraction  ofTreat  with  Friendindividuals  in
20:693:58592:18:17:72:540:497:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that group, conditional on total group size.  We do this two ways, using the exogenous but limited
20:694:58690:17:18:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:variation  induced  by  random  assignment  and  using  the  endogenous  but  larger  variation  in  who
20:695:58794:18:18:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:actually showed up for training.  In both specifications, we fail to find any consistent evidence of
20:696:58894:18:17:72:208:444:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:negative peer externalities.28
20:697:58924:17:18:88:539:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Finally,  we  should  also  note  that  our  overall  treatment  impacts  may  be  muted  if  there  are
20:698:59028:18:18:72:540:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:positive spillovers to the control group.  While we lack data to directly test this, we should note
20:699:59127:18:17:72:540:391:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that our sample of trained women is relatively small compared to the number of SEWA clients in
20:700:59221:17:18:72:540:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the catchment area of a training center.  Additionally, when we replace control clients within a given
20:701:59323:18:17:72:540:356:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:training group with randomly-selected control clients from a different SEWA training center, all of
20:702:59422:17:18:72:539:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:our results remain very similar, both in terms of significance and in magnitude.29This, combined
20:703:59518:18:18:72:540:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with the absence of peer treatment effects on discussing business with a friend, leads us to believe
20:704:59618:18:17:72:540:303:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that positive spillovers to the control group are unlikely to be large enough to be a concern.  Finally,
20:705:59722:17:18:72:540:286:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:we should note that the follow-up survey occurred on a rolling basis and typically at four months
20:706:59819:18:33:72:464:268:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:after the training; this may be too short a time period for spillovers to manifest.30

20:708:59953:24:18:72:540:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Female labor force participation in India is exceptionally low at 27%:  India ranks 168 out of 186 in
20:709:60054:18:16:72:540:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the world for this marker.A commonly cited reason is social norms which restrict female mobility
20:710:60150:16:15:80:539:177:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:28For SEWA Business loans, we find significant evidence that a higher fraction of peer treated clients in a group
20:711:60263:15:11:72:540:162:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:reduces the likelihood that a treated alone client takes out a loan.  However, we fail to observe any other significant
20:712:60382:11:7:72:455:151:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:effects and the magnitude of some of the other impacts are large and in the opposite direction.
20:713:60477:7:11:80:229:144:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:A:29Results available from the authors.
20:714:60514:11:15:80:539:133:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:30In  our  sample,  the  mean  duration  between  the  treatment  and  follow-up  data  collection  is  4.3  months  with  a
20:715:60638:15:10:72:540:118:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:standard deviation of 2.2 months.  In unreported results we check that our results are robust to controlling for the
20:716:60754:10:37:72:289:108:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:duration between treatment and the follow-up survey.

21:719:60897:18:18:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:women trained with a peer were more likely to gain economically from the training and, strikingly,
21:720:60995:18:17:72:364:673:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:four months later were less likely to report being housewives.
21:721:61057:17:18:88:539:656:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:A complementary way of understanding how peer effects operate is, therefore, to ask whether
21:722:61148:18:18:72:540:638:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:responsiveness to treatment varied with the restrictiveness of social norms faced by women.  As
21:723:61243:18:17:72:540:620:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:we have previously documented in Field, Jayachandran, and Pande (2010), social norms related to
21:724:61338:17:18:72:540:603:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mobility vary by caste and religion in India and upper-caste women benefited from the treatment
21:725:61433:18:17:72:516:585:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:relative to both more restricted groups (Muslims) and less restricted ones (scheduled castes).
21:726:61527:17:18:88:539:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In  Table  7,  we  interact  treatment  status  directly  with  an  indicator  of  mobility  restrictions

21:728:61743:18:17:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:categorization used in Field, Jayachandran, and Pande (2010)).  The indicator is created through
21:729:61839:17:18:72:540:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a point system of the following six criteria:  whether the woman (1) can seek employment, (2) can

21:732:62109:18:18:88:539:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In column (1),  we do not find differential take-up when recruited with a friend,  even among
21:733:62202:18:17:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f4:B:women from more conservative backgrounds.  In contrast, for outcome measures, the mainTreat

21:735:62388:18:18:72:140:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:their mobility.
21:736:62403:18:17:88:539:391:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Specifically, in column (2) we see thatTreat with Friendclients who face more social restrictions
21:737:62500:17:18:72:540:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are 16 percentage points (or 400%) more likely to take out a loan than unrestricted women in the
21:738:62596:18:17:72:540:356:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:control, although they are no more likely to have higher savings (column 3).  This subsample also
21:739:62693:17:18:72:540:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:works nearly 14 more hours per week than women in the control group, and this is significant at
21:740:62788:18:18:72:540:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the 1% level.  Although noisy, the income result in column (5) is qualitatively consistent with the
21:741:62887:18:17:72:540:303:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:finding in Table 5:Treat  with  Friendwomen who face restrictive social norms have 13% higher
21:742:62980:17:18:71:539:286:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:household income than women in the control group and are significantly.  less likely to report being
21:743:63080:18:17:71:126:268:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:housewives.
21:744:63091:17:18:88:539:251:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In Appendix Table 4, we show that these results are robust to including as additional covari-

21:747:63297:17:18:88:539:198:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Thus, it appears that the observed differences are not proxying for obvious economic character-
21:748:63392:18:17:71:539:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:istics though we, of course, note the caveat that our measures of social norms may, in part, capture
21:749:63492:17:18:71:265:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:other unobservable client characteristics.

22:755:63874:18:18:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:up the training.  This, together with the results in Table 6, suggests that an important aspect of
22:756:63972:18:17:72:540:673:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:peer treatment was the support women received in identifying and implementing business goals.

22:763:64520:18:18:72:540:517:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ing those results is that women are not good entrepreneurs.  However, our findings challenge such
22:764:64617:18:17:72:540:499:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a conclusion.  Specifically, women who attend a business training with a friend are able to expand
22:765:64715:17:18:72:540:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:their businesses and increase household earnings and expenditures.  This suggests that rather than
22:766:64813:18:17:72:451:464:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:being bad entrepreneurs, women may be constrained in ways that men are not.
22:767:64888:17:18:88:539:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Despite  the  proliferation  of  financial  inclusion  efforts  in  developing  countries  over  the  past
22:768:64994:18:18:72:540:429:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:few decades, financial institutions targeting the poor, such as microfinance institutions, still face
22:769:65095:18:17:72:540:411:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:problems reaching sufficient numbers of borrowers to stay afloat, and the successful ones are having
22:770:65195:17:18:72:540:394:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:trouble  scaling  up  operations  (Armend ́ariz  and  Morduch,  2010).   Our  results  suggest  that  one
22:771:65300:18:17:72:540:376:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:potentially important factor limiting financial inclusion efforts is inadequate peer support among
22:772:65398:17:18:72:540:359:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:many of the women who have the potential to start or expand entrepreneurial activities.  Involving
22:773:65496:18:18:72:540:341:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a friend led participants in our two-day training program to double their demand for loans and
22:774:65590:18:17:72:540:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:significantly  expand  their  business  activity,  resulting  in  higher  household  income.   Those  who
22:775:65695:17:18:72:540:306:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:belonged to more restrictive social groups were particularly sensitive to peer involvement.  Thus,
22:776:65793:18:18:72:540:288:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:programs designed to empower women through business training or by giving them loans or cash
22:777:65885:18:17:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:grants  (De  Mel,  McKenzie,  and  Woodruff,  2014)  may  be  more  successful  if  they  harness  peer
22:778:65988:17:18:72:540:253:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:support  as  part  of  the  program  design,  particularly  when  working  with  clients  from  restrictive
22:779:66095:18:17:72:165:235:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:social backgrounds.
22:780:66114:17:18:88:539:218:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:It  is  also  surprising  that  demand  for  bank  services  can  be  influenced  simply  by  encouraging
22:781:66219:18:18:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:female entrepreneurs to form concrete goals and aspirations.  In our study, all women were familiar
22:782:66318:18:17:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with bank loans available through the partner institution well before the training (as they were
22:783:66414:17:18:72:540:165:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:members of SEWA Bank with savings accounts), and during the training these women were neither
22:784:66507:18:17:72:540:147:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:taught about financing through loans nor encouraged to borrow.  Rather, simply encouraging them
22:785:66602:17:18:72:540:130:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to focus on concrete goals in the presence of a friend changed their demand for bank loans.  This
22:786:66699:18:40:72:540:112:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:suggests that debt-aversion and lack of information about financial services are not the only roots
