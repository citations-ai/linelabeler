3:52:3014:0:28:79:170:709:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:INTRODUCTION
3:53:3026:28:27:115:525:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:After a half-century of extraordinary growth in health care expenditures in the United
3:54:3112:27:28:79:493:654:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:States, there is now evidence that health care spending growth is slowing.  Why this is
3:55:3199:28:28:79:527:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:occurring and how long it may last is not known, but a substantial literature suggests that two
3:56:3294:28:27:79:510:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:key elements of the efforts to contain costs may have played a role: the use of prospective
3:57:3385:27:28:79:528:571:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:payment systems (Russell and Manning, 1989) and the encouragement of competition among
3:58:3471:28:27:79:524:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:providers (Melnick and Zwanziger, 1988).  Indeed, the combination of these two approaches
3:59:3560:27:28:79:520:516:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:seems to be particularly important, since competition in the absence of prospective payment
3:60:3651:28:28:79:506:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:systems has been suggested to increase costs (Robinson and Luft, 1985), and prospective
3:61:3738:28:27:79:530:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:payment in the absence of competition provides no financial incentive to provide quality care.
3:62:3832:27:28:115:526:433:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:While most theoretical discussions of the effects of prospective payment hinge on the
3:63:3917:28:27:79:519:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:incentives to provide lower levels of care under fixed reimbursement and do not discuss the
3:64:4008:27:28:79:487:378:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:differential incentives to provide care to different types of patients,1 a few theoretical
3:65:4098:28:28:79:513:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:examinations of prospective payment have also incorporated the differential incentives for
3:66:4188:28:27:79:508:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:spending on profitable or unprofitable patients (e.g. Allen and Gertler, 1991; Ellis, 1998).
3:67:4280:27:28:79:479:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Meanwhile, a number of empirical studies have examined the differential effects of
3:68:4362:28:27:79:525:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:prospective payment systems on low and high-cost patients. For example, Ellis and McGuire
3:69:4451:27:28:79:509:240:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:(1996) show how prospective payment for mental health services under Medicaid in New
3:70:4535:28:28:79:511:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Hampshire resulted in reduced expenditures selectively among the sickest patients.  In the
3:71:4625:28:27:79:522:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:context of the Medicare Prospective Payment, Newhouse (1989) finds that, while patients in
3:72:4715:27:28:79:527:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:unprofitable DRGs were not more likely than other patients to be transferred under PPS, they
3:73:4807:28:32:79:493:129:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:are more likely to be found in “hospitals of last resort”, suggesting that there is patient
3:74:4898:32:7:79:224:97:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:                                                          
3:75:4956:7:16:79:515:90:42:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:1 For standard textbook discussion, see Peter Zweifel and Friedrich Breyer, Health Economics, Oxford Press,

4:77:5155:0:28:79:522:709:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:selection according to profitability.  Similarly, Meltzer and Chung (2000) show that hospital
4:78:5248:28:27:79:529:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:spending for the elderly in California under Medicare PPS was selectively reduced among the
4:79:5339:27:28:79:524:654:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:most expensive patients.  Indeed, these reductions occurred despite an overall pattern among
4:80:5431:28:28:79:532:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the young and among the elderly prior to the implementation of Medicare PPS for cost growth
4:81:5522:28:27:79:526:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:to be greatest among the most expensive patients, as reflected in the increasing concentration
4:82:5616:27:28:79:517:571:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:of health care expenditures over this century (Cutler and Meara, 1998).  Moreover, Meltzer
4:83:5706:28:27:79:506:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and Chung show that this same pattern of selective cost reduction for the most expensive
4:84:5794:27:28:79:524:516:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:patients is present within the 12 largest Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs), the categories by
4:85:5886:28:28:79:314:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:which Medicare reimburses hospitals under PPS.
4:86:5932:28:27:115:526:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:That prospective payment systems may lead to a redistribution of resources from sick
4:87:6016:27:28:79:513:433:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and costly persons within a payment category to healthier and more profitable ones cuts in
4:88:6106:28:27:79:495:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:many ways against a fundamental idea behind prospective payment systems in that the
4:89:6189:27:28:79:527:378:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:profitable patients are supposed to subsidize the costs of the unprofitable ones.  Nevertheless,
4:90:6285:28:28:79:520:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:competitive pressures could lead to such an outcome as hospitals that attempt to support the
4:91:6377:28:27:79:526:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:care of unprofitable patients with revenue from profitable patients find the profitable patients
4:92:6473:27:28:79:509:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:wooed away by other hospitals that have chosen to invest resources in amenities that may
4:93:6561:28:27:79:526:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:appeal to patients and their doctors, but that are not necessarily related to better outcomes for
4:94:6658:27:28:79:179:240:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the most severely ill.
4:95:6680:28:28:115:512:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:In this paper, we use California data on patient charges and hospital cost-to-charge
4:96:6764:28:27:79:532:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:ratios from 1983 and 1993 to explore the effects of competition under prospective payment on
4:97:6856:27:28:79:527:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:hospital costs for low- and high-cost admissions for the 12 largest Diagnosis Related Groups.
4:98:6949:28:27:79:524:129:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Since the Medicare Prospective Payment System (PPS) was implemented nationwide almost
4:99:7034:27:0:79:505:102:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:simultaneously, we have to identify the effects of PPS mainly through comparison of the
5:100:7122:0:28:79:515:709:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:effects of competition before and after the implementation of PPS.  However, to attempt to
5:101:7212:28:27:79:520:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:separate out the effects of PPS from temporal changes in the effects of competition, we also
5:102:7304:27:28:79:523:654:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:contrast the effects of competition on costs for admissions for persons older than 65 with the
5:103:7398:28:28:79:529:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:effects of competition on costs for persons younger than 65.  Complicating this analysis is the
5:104:7493:28:27:79:523:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:fact that this period was also a time of important change in the organization and financing of
5:105:7587:27:28:79:528:571:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:health care for those below age 65 in California.  In particular, the development of a selective
5:106:7683:28:27:79:513:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:provider contracting program and per-diem reimbursement system by California Medicaid
5:107:7768:27:28:79:515:516:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:program (Medi-Cal), and the increasing use of managed care arrangements were important
5:108:7854:28:28:79:468:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:suppressing hospital cost growth among the young in California over this period.
5:109:7934:28:27:115:521:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Although we cannot prove that the patterns we observe are due to Medicare PPS, we
5:110:8015:27:28:79:527:433:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:find clear evidence that increased competition was associated with increased costs among the
5:111:8107:28:27:79:528:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:elderly before the implementation of PPS, but decreased costs afterwards, with the reductions
5:112:8200:27:28:79:520:378:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:in costs clearly much greater among high-cost admissions than among low-cost admissions.
5:113:8288:28:28:79:491:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:This is consistent with the idea that the incentives created by Medicare PPS may have
5:114:8373:28:27:79:355:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:selectively reduced expenditures on the high-cost elderly.
5:115:8431:27:28:115:522:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: We begin in Section I with a short overview of the most important cost-containment
5:116:8514:28:27:79:526:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:efforts prevailing in California during this period: the Medicare Prospective Payment System
5:117:8606:27:28:79:522:240:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:(PPS), the California Medicaid selective provider contracting program, and the expansion of
5:118:8697:28:28:79:532:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:managed care.  The description of PPS provides the institutional context for the effects of PPS
5:119:8792:28:27:79:528:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:we aim to investigate, while the discussion of the changes in reimbursement strategies among
5:120:8884:27:28:79:489:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the young provides some insight into the use of the temporal changes in the effects of
5:121:8970:28:27:79:527:129:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:competition on costs for the young as a comparison.  In Section II, we develop the theoretical
5:122:9064:27:0:79:506:102:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:motivation for our analyses using a model of provider response to fixed-rate, prospective
6:123:9154:0:28:79:502:709:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:reimbursement in which quality can be varied for patients who differ in their underlying
6:124:9242:28:27:79:531:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:severity of illness and, hence, profitability.  In Section III we describe our data, and in Section
6:125:9341:27:28:79:507:654:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:IV we present the results of our analyses of the effects of competition on cost.  Section V
6:126:9432:28:28:79:492:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:concludes and examines the implications of our work for the design of reimbursement
6:127:9515:28:82:79:372:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:strategies, for quality assessment, and for outcomes research.

6:129:9646:40:27:115:501:476:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Between 1983 and 1993, diverse cost-containment strategies were undertaken in
6:130:9723:27:28:79:510:449:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:California which led to a widespread transition to prospective payment systems as well as
6:131:9812:28:27:79:512:421:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:intensified hospital market competition.2  Here, we briefly discuss major cost containment
6:132:9902:27:28:79:527:394:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:strategies that were implemented over this period: the Medicare Prospective Payment System
6:133:9992:28:28:79:528:366:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:(PPS), selective provider contracting between California’s Medicaid program (Medi-Cal) and
6:134:10082:28:55:79:425:338:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:health care providers, and the expansion of managed care arrangements.
6:135:10152:55:27:79:148:283:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:?:Medicare PPS
6:136:10164:27:28:115:494:256:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Prospective payment systems certainly existed prior to the establishment of the
6:137:10243:28:27:79:496:228:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Medicare Prospective Payment System beginning in 1983.  Nevertheless, the scale and
6:138:10326:27:28:79:495:201:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:influence of Medicare made the shift from retrospective reimbursement on the basis of
6:139:10411:28:28:79:481:173:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:reasonable costs to PPS a change of fundamental importance for hospitals. With the
6:140:10493:28:27:79:523:145:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:establishment of PPS, reimbursement for almost all hospitalizations under Medicare came to
6:141:10583:27:32:79:496:118:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:be made on the basis of prospectively fixed rates according to diagnosis-related groups
6:142:10670:32:7:79:224:86:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:                                                          
6:143:10728:7:0:79:460:79:42:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:2 For a good summary of the cost-containment in California during the 1980s, see Langa, 1992.
7:144:10822:0:28:79:486:709:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:(DRGs).  Each hospitalization is assigned a DRG based on principal diagnosis or the
7:145:10905:28:27:79:507:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:performance of a very limited number of particularly costly procedures, such as coronary
7:146:10993:27:28:79:527:654:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:artery bypass graft surgery. Each DRG is assigned a fixed weight that reflects its relative cost
7:147:11089:28:28:79:522:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:of treatment with respect to a base rate.  Because hospitals are paid a fixed amount per DRG
7:148:11181:28:27:79:526:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:based on the DRG weight, the classification system was designed to create groups of patients
7:149:11273:27:28:79:521:571:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:as homogeneous as possible with respect to resource consumption.  To this end, DRGs were
7:150:11361:28:27:79:529:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:also stratified with respect to age and the presence of complicating conditions.  After a phase-
7:151:11457:27:28:79:492:516:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:in period over the course of four years during which reimbursement reflected a mix of
7:152:11542:28:28:79:490:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:national, regional, and facility-specific rates (Smith and Fottler, 1985), hospitals were
7:153:11631:28:27:79:521:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:reimbursed for each case according to the national average cost of treating a base case (with
7:154:11724:27:28:79:521:433:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:adjustments to reflect location and local wages) multiplied by the DRG weight (Davis et al.,
7:155:11816:28:27:79:488:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:1990).  Thus, reimbursement under PPS was fully prospective from the onset, but the
7:156:11899:27:28:79:506:378:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:persistence of differences in reimbursement rates based on historical costs meant that the
7:157:11989:28:55:79:476:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:competitive aspects of the effects of PPS increased progressively over its phase-in.
7:158:12073:55:28:79:277:295:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:?:Medi-Cal Selective Provider Contracting
7:159:12112:28:27:115:512:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:The same year that Medicare PPS was implemented, California enacted legislation
7:160:12191:27:28:79:523:240:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:authorizing the state Medicaid program, Medi-Cal, to negotiate contracts with health service
7:161:12283:28:28:79:511:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:providers for the care of Medi-Cal beneficiaries. This was done with the intent to promote
7:162:12373:28:27:79:523:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:price competition in the Medicaid market.  Under this legislation, eligible, short-term, acute-
7:163:12468:27:28:79:515:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:care general hospitals were offered the opportunity to negotiate service provision contracts
7:164:12560:28:27:79:529:129:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:with Medi-Cal on the basis of fixed per-diem rates (Johns, 1985).  Failure to secure a contract
7:165:12655:27:0:79:516:102:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:meant that hospitals would not be reimbursed for care given to Medi-Cal patients except in
8:166:12746:0:28:79:516:709:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:cases of emergency (Langa, 1992).  Though the per-diem reimbursement established under
8:167:12832:28:27:79:528:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:this legislation did not result in a fully prospective payment system for Medi-Cal patients, the
8:168:12928:27:28:79:515:654:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:resulting declines in Medi-Cal reimbursement also intensified the competitive pressures on
8:169:13018:28:55:79:264:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:California hospitals during this period.
8:170:13058:55:28:79:217:571:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:?:Expansion of Managed Care
8:171:13083:28:27:115:532:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:During the 1980s, managed care spread rapidly throughout the U.S., but particularly in
8:172:13169:27:28:79:532:516:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:California.  By 1988, California ranked first in the nation in terms of its HMO enrollment rate,
8:173:13265:28:28:79:517:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:with roughly 28.5 percent of the state population (7.68 million individuals) belonging to an
8:174:13357:28:27:79:501:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:HMO.  This was more than double the national enrollment rate in 1987, when only 12.1
8:175:13441:27:28:79:513:433:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:percent of the U.S. population was enrolled in an HMO (Davis et al., 1990), and even well
8:176:13530:28:27:79:502:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:above the national rate of 19.7 percent in 1994 (I.O.M., 1997).  Likewise, the number of
8:177:13618:27:28:79:531:378:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) in California grew 94 percent from 34 PPOs in 1984
8:178:13708:28:28:79:214:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:to 72 in 1988 (Johns, 1989).
8:179:13736:28:27:115:512:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Some managed care payers adopted prospective payment systems for hospital care
8:180:13814:27:28:79:529:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:similar to Medicare Prospective Payment. However, the majority adopted other approaches to
8:181:13904:28:27:79:530:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:cost control such as selective contracting, per diem reimbursement, and utilization review that
8:182:13999:27:28:79:509:240:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:did not necessarily provide any particular incentive to decrease expenditures for high cost
8:183:14090:28:28:79:518:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:users relative to low cost users (Gold et al., 1995)3. Nevertheless, many aspects of managed
8:184:14182:28:27:79:444:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:care served to further intensify competition in California during these years.
8:185:14260:27:28:115:496:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Indeed, the empirical evidence available suggests that Medicare PPS, Medi-Cal
8:186:14337:28:27:79:522:129:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:selective contracting and managed care arrangements all contributed to curbing cost growth.
8:187:14428:27:0:79:506:102:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:From 1967 to 1984, Medicare hospital care expenditures had been growing at an average
9:188:14514:0:28:79:521:709:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:annual rate of 16.5 percent: in the seven years immediately following PPS growth fell to 7.3
9:189:14606:28:27:79:517:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:percent (Davis and Burner, 1995).  Based on projections of Medicare expenditures, Russell
9:190:14695:27:28:79:527:654:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and Manning (1989) estimated savings of 12 to 18 billion dollars for 1990 under PPS.  Medi-
9:191:14786:28:28:79:524:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Cal selective contracting in California also appears to have been largely successful in raising
9:192:14881:28:27:79:512:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the level of competition in hospital markets while simultaneously suppressing cost growth
9:193:14970:27:28:79:526:571:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:(Johns, 1989; Robinson and Phibbs, 1989; Melnick et al., 1992).  Additionally, the growth of
9:194:15062:28:27:79:521:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:managed care organizations also contributed to lower cost growth, both by delivering health
9:195:15153:27:28:79:511:516:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:care at lower costs due to lower service intensity (Manning et al., 1984) and by increasing
9:196:15244:28:28:79:389:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:competition in hospital markets (Melnick and Zwanziger, 1995).
9:197:15306:28:27:115:523:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Thus, between 1983 and 1993, hospitals in California became increasingly subject to
9:198:15389:27:28:79:519:433:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:prospective payment systems as a result of Medicare PPS, and increased competition due to
9:199:15478:28:27:79:510:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the effects of Medi-Cal selective contracting and the growth of managed care.  It is in this
9:200:15570:27:28:79:530:378:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:context that economic theories of provider behavior under prospective reimbursement suggest
9:201:15661:28:28:79:512:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:incentives to decrease expenditures on high cost patients while increasing expenditures on

9:205:15885:28:27:115:512:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Many cost-containment strategies rely on supply-side cost-sharing to achieve cost-
9:206:15967:27:28:79:499:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:containment objectives.  Whereas retrospective reimbursement systems largely insulate
9:207:16052:28:27:79:507:129:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:providers from increases in costs, providers under prospective payment system are paid a

9:210:16369:7:0:79:386:69:42:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:3 A detailed overview managed care forms can be found in Gold et al., 1995.
10:211:16445:0:28:115:523:709:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:If the patient population is taken as given, such payment schemes that hold providers
10:212:16530:28:27:79:507:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:financially responsible for the marginal costs of treatment can create incentives to reduce
10:213:16621:27:28:79:497:654:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:provision of unnecessary services to patients.  This is reflected by the common view of
10:214:16708:28:28:79:530:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:managed care as reducing services.  What is less appreciated, however, is that when providers
10:215:16801:28:27:79:501:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:have to compete for patients, prospective payment systems also create a new distinction
10:216:16888:27:28:79:525:571:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:among patients: namely, one between profitable and unprofitable patients depending on their
10:217:16979:28:27:79:518:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:expected costs relative to the level of prospective reimbursement (Newhouse, 1989).  Thus,
10:218:17069:27:28:79:522:516:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:when profit-maximizing hospitals under fixed-rate prospective reimbursement face a patient
10:219:17159:28:28:79:520:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:population of variable illness within a reimbursement category, they may have incentives to
10:220:17250:28:27:79:525:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:provide excessive levels of care for the less-ill, and/or to choose and advertise quality of care
10:221:17347:27:28:79:512:433:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:or amenities that differentially attract these profitable patients while avoiding unprofitable
10:222:17441:28:27:79:504:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:ones (Hornbrook and Rafferty, 1982; Ellis and McGuire, 1986; Dranove, 1987; Luft and
10:223:17525:27:28:79:528:378:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Miller, 1988; Newhouse, 1989; Hodgkin and McGuire, 1994; Ellis, 1998).4  When intensified
10:224:17614:28:28:79:519:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:competition decreases overall profit levels and increases the price-responsiveness of patient
10:225:17707:28:27:79:518:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:volume, such strategies may become matters of institutional survival.  Thus, as Ellis (1998)
10:226:17799:27:28:79:516:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:has shown, incentives to engage in patient selection and discrimination in quality provision
10:227:17891:28:27:79:525:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:are exacerbated under increased competition, a condition that has been realized in many U.S.
10:228:17983:27:28:79:469:240:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:hospital markets in recent years with greater market penetration by managed care
10:229:18063:28:28:79:340:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:organizations (Ellis, 1998; Dranove and White, 1994).
10:230:18116:28:27:115:504:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:The empirical implication of these theories is that, where providers are subject to
10:231:18199:27:26:79:527:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:fixed-rate prospective payment systems, declines in hospital cost growth will be concentrated
10:232:18292:26:7:79:224:131:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:                                                          
10:233:18350:7:16:79:509:124:42:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:4 This may in practice be implemented by increasing spending on infrastructural elements that may be most
10:234:18455:16:11:79:484:108:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:important to health patients (such as a pleasant cafeteria or waiting area), and decreasing spending on
10:235:18558:11:0:79:523:97:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:infrastrucure that is most important to the sickest patients (such as expensive imaging machines, or intensity of
11:236:18672:0:28:79:520:709:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:at the top of the spending distribution.  In other words, high-cost (unprofitable patients) will
11:237:18768:28:27:79:494:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:experience greater reductions in resource consumption relative to low-cost (profitable)
11:238:18855:27:28:79:432:654:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:patients.  Furthermore, these effects will be magnified under competition.
11:239:18929:28:28:115:505:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:To illustrate this, we develop the following model of choice of quality of care for
11:240:19012:28:27:79:471:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:patients with differing severity of illness (s) given a prospective payment rate (P).
11:241:19097:27:28:79:523:571:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Specifically, we model the choice of quality of care for patient of severity s (qs) at cost c(qs).
11:242:19195:28:27:79:529:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:To capture the variation in costs of patients who differ in severity of illness, we allow the cost
11:243:19293:27:28:79:515:516:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:of providing basic care to also depend on severity (c(s)).  Thus the total cost of caring for a
11:244:19388:28:28:79:508:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:patient of severity s is c(s) + c(qs), where the first component is non-discretionary and the
11:245:19481:28:28:79:514:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:second is subject to choice depending on the desire to provide additional quality.  Thus we
11:246:19572:28:43:79:517:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:model the profit from caring for a patient of severity s (π(s)) under prospective payment as:
11:247:19665:43:28:245:369:389:144:Symbol:144:g_d0_f4:A: π(s) = P – c(s) – c(qs)(1)
11:248:19692:28:27:79:124:361:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:    where:
11:249:19702:27:28:79:284:334:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:    P  = prospective payment rate
11:250:19735:28:28:79:447:306:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:    c(s)     = basic cost of caring for patient of severity s  (cs > 0, css > 0)
11:251:19815:28:27:79:388:278:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:        qs      = quality of care provided to patient of severity s
11:252:19882:27:28:79:518:251:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:    c(qs) = cost of added quality of care to patients of severity s  (c(0)=0, cq > 0, cqq > 0)
11:253:19976:28:27:79:531:223:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:To go from this patient level-profit to the profit of caring for the class of patients of severity s,
11:254:20077:27:28:79:532:196:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:we allow the demand for care by patients of severity s when quality is qs to be D(qs,s)) = D(qs)

12:297:21310:27:28:115:485:315:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:Since one of the empirical comparisons we will make is between prospective
12:298:21384:28:27:79:521:287:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:reimbursement and retrospective reimbursement, it is useful to contrast this result with what
12:299:21477:27:28:79:513:260:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:would be expected under a retrospective reimbursement system.  In particular, instead of a
12:300:21567:28:28:79:527:232:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:fixed price P, independent of severity and quality, a retrospective reimbursement system may
12:301:21659:28:27:79:479:204:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:in general depend on both (e.g. P(s,qs)).  Under some circumstances, this makes the

12:303:21831:28:27:79:515:149:145:g_d0_f4:65:g_d0_f4:B:difficult.   To illustrate this, assume P(s,qs) takes the general form P(s,qs)= P0 + Ps c(s) + Pq

13:309:22408:27:28:79:521:654:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:categories may be hard to distinguish among in practice, but the distinction is worth making
13:310:22500:28:28:79:531:626:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:to reflect the idea that there may be some expenditures that might not be fully covered under a
13:311:22595:28:27:79:520:598:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:retrospective reimbursement system, but nevertheless desired by hospitals in order to attract
13:312:22688:27:28:79:525:571:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:patients.5  For our purposes, the most straightforward case is when reimbursement provides a
13:313:22780:28:27:79:519:543:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:fixed amount of profit per admission by providing a lump sum profit (K) per admission and
13:314:22869:27:38:79:507:516:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:exactly reimburses severity-related costs while not covering quality-related costs.  In that
13:315:22961:38:12:79:435:478:145:g_d0_f4:49:g_d0_f4:B:case,  P0=K>0, ps=1 and pq=0, so Equation 4 becomes [K-c(qs)]/c(qs)= ,

13:325:23149:27:28:79:409:409:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:spending for more expensive patients relative to less expensive ones.
13:326:23218:28:28:115:529:381:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:Perhaps even more relevant is the case in which retrospective reimbursement provides
13:327:23302:28:37:79:529:353:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:no fixed profit per admission but instead offers a markup over costs for severity-related costs,
13:328:23398:37:13:79:506:316:145:g_d0_f4:49:g_d0_f4:B:e.g. P0=0, Ps>1, and Pq=0.  In this case, equation 4 becomes [Psc(s)- c(s)-c(qs)]/c(qs)= ,

13:341:23585:37:27:79:513:229:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:therefore will spend more on quality for the more expensive patients.  Again, the switch to
13:342:23676:27:28:79:479:202:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:prospective payment will lead to a reduction in spending among the sicker patients.
13:343:23759:28:28:115:528:174:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:Finally, it is also worth considering a system in which no fixed profit per admission is
13:344:23847:28:27:79:518:146:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:given but all costs related to both severity and quality are reimbursed retrospectively with a
13:345:23941:27:26:79:508:119:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:markup. Some might consider this most like the retrospective reimbursement system as it

13:347:24086:7:0:79:517:86:42:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:5 The classic example of this is are the free car seats sometimes offered to expectant parents in order to attract

14:361:24392:42:27:79:514:629:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:This is would seem to suggest again that quality would rise with severity.  It is misleading,
14:362:24485:27:28:79:515:602:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:however, because with full retrospective reimbursements for amenities, the hospital has no
14:363:24575:28:27:79:531:574:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:incentive to limit expenditures on amenities so the second order conditions actually imply that
14:364:24670:27:28:79:516:547:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:the optimal quality is infinite for all patients.  Thus, there must be some other constraint on
14:365:24765:28:28:79:523:519:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:the reimbursement of discretionary care, which seems most likely to be a combination of the
14:366:24856:28:27:79:521:491:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:possibility of doing harm to the patient (and associated risk of liability), and whatever limits
14:367:24952:27:28:79:519:464:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:are placed by the payer.  Whichever is the case, it is not possible how to predict prospective
14:368:25046:28:27:79:454:436:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:payment will affect discretionary expenditures on low- and high-cost patients.
14:369:25124:27:28:115:521:409:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:Summarizing, except in the case where discretionary expenditures are not limited by
14:370:25207:28:28:79:495:381:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:economic incentives, there appears to be a fairly broad set of assumptions under which
14:371:25293:28:27:79:498:353:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:prospective payment would be expected to selectively reduce expenditures for the most
14:372:25378:27:55:79:362:326:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:expensive patients relative to retrospective reimbursement.
14:373:25437:55:28:79:186:271:145:g_d0_f5:145:g_d0_f5:C:Effects of Competition
14:374:25459:28:28:115:521:243:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:Equation 4 implies that that the ratio of profit to cost for quality falls with increasing
14:375:25549:28:27:79:525:215:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:elasticity of demand with respect to quality so that, accordingly, quality rises with increasing
14:376:25645:27:28:79:525:188:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:elasticity of demand with respect to quality.  Since the out-of-pocket cost of a hospitalization
14:377:25741:28:27:79:481:160:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:to a Medicare patient is independent of the hospital they choose, it seems likely that
14:378:25827:27:28:79:525:133:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:competitive pressures will make this elasticity be quite large, though such competitive forces
14:379:25921:28:26:79:506:105:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:will surely be limited by geographic factors in areas where there are few hospitals so that

15:382:26247:0:28:79:528:709:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:patient options are limited because of high search and transportation costs and where changes
15:383:26340:28:27:79:507:681:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:in quality are more likely to be coordinated (Stigler 1968; Bain 1951; Tirole 1988; White
15:384:26429:27:33:79:352:654:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:1972).6  Rearranging Equation 4 to solve for c(qs) yields:

15:388:26523:30:27:115:528:588:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:Since quality is set to a minimum for unprofitable patients, this applies where patients
15:389:26611:27:28:79:513:561:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:are profitable so the numerator is positive, and quality for profitable patients rises with the
15:390:26706:28:28:79:516:533:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:degree of competition.  As above, quality falls with increasing severity, and here the rate at
15:391:26800:28:27:79:505:505:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:which expenditures on quality fall with increasing severity is seen to rise with increasing
15:392:26891:27:28:79:512:478:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:elasticity of demand with respect to quality (e.g. competition) so that the positive effect of
15:393:26985:28:27:79:522:450:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:competition on costs is reduced for more costly patients.   Thus, an increasingly competitive
15:394:27078:27:28:79:511:423:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:environment under prospective payment has the effect of raising quality most for the least
15:395:27168:28:28:79:519:395:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:costly patients.  Since competition under prospective payment may also increase efficiency,
15:396:27259:28:27:79:516:367:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:this may not result in an absolute increase in costs, but should at least lessen cost decreases
15:397:27354:27:28:79:491:340:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:for the least expensive patients relative to the most costly patients, for whom the clear
15:398:27443:28:27:79:523:312:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:incentive is to reduce expenditures if possible because they are not profitable.  Indeed, in the
15:399:27539:27:28:79:523:285:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:limit, as the elasticity of demand with respect to quality approaches infinity, expenditures on
15:400:27634:28:28:79:506:257:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:quality fall dollar-for-dollar with increasing severity of illness as all profits are competed
15:401:27728:28:97:79:224:229:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:away at each level of severity.

15:403:27817:7:16:79:517:125:42:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:6 Note however, that the relationship between competition and quality in general may be much more complex
15:404:27922:16:12:79:475:109:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:than this in settings where both price and quantity may be varied because it will also depend on the
15:405:28022:12:11:79:500:97:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:complementarity between quantity and quality (Spence, 1975; Saving, 1982). Another alternative view is

15:407:28237:12:0:79:448:74:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:costs by decreasing the value of information held by any individual about a particular seller.

16:422:29371:28:27:115:485:322:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:We limit our analysis to all California State residents (identified by zip code)

16:424:29544:28:27:79:516:267:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:Certain institutions, many of which are managed care facilities such as Kaiser hospitals, do
16:425:29636:27:28:79:514:240:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:not report total charges on their discharge abstracts because they are exempt from standard
16:426:29727:28:28:79:515:212:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:OSHPD accounting procedures.  As a convention, patients discharged from these hospitals
16:427:29814:28:0:79:521:184:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:have zero charges recorded in their abstracts, although true costs were non-zero.  Since total
17:428:29910:0:28:79:487:709:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:hospital charges for these patients can not be ascertained, they are excluded from our
17:429:29996:28:27:79:126:681:145:g_d0_f4:65:g_d0_f4:B:analyses.7
17:430:30006:27:28:115:528:654:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:To calculate costs, we begin with charge data that we convert to 1993 constant dollars
17:431:30092:28:28:79:526:626:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:using the general Consumer Price Index and then to costs using an annual institution-specific
17:432:30185:28:27:79:512:598:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:ratios of costs to charges (RCCs).  These RCCs are calculated using the OSHPD Financial
17:433:30272:27:28:79:516:571:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:Disclosure Data, which reports facility-level data on total operating expenses, gross patient
17:434:30365:28:27:79:521:543:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:revenue, and other non-operating revenue.  Because other non-operating revenue consists of
17:435:30455:27:28:79:517:516:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:revenue from hospital enterprises such as the outpatient pharmacy and gift-shop, we follow
17:436:30545:28:28:79:511:488:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:the approach recommended by OSHPD (1993) in calculating the facility-specific RCC as:
17:437:30630:28:27:79:531:460:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:      RCC = (Total Operating Expenses-Other Non-operating Revenue)/Gross Patient Revenue.
17:438:30719:27:28:115:519:433:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:Although RCCs are commonly used to estimate costs based on charges, the fact that
17:439:30800:28:27:79:483:405:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:OSHPD data does not permit disaggregation of inpatient charges into its component
17:440:30881:27:28:79:489:378:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:departments and services so that institution-level RCCs must be used, is an important
17:441:30966:28:28:79:531:350:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:limitation since they cannot reflect discrepancies between costs and charges that arise because
17:442:31061:28:27:79:530:322:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:of internal cross-subsidization across departments and services within a facility. Nevertheless,
17:443:31157:27:28:79:525:295:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:facility-level RCCs can adjust for certain discrepancies between costs and charges, such as if
17:444:31251:28:27:79:511:267:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:a facility treats a large proportion of charity cases (Finkler, 1982), and have been found to
17:445:31344:27:28:79:531:240:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:perform somewhat better than charges as proxies for costs (Newhouse, Cretin and Witsberger,
17:446:31435:28:28:79:495:212:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:1989; Schwartz, Young and Siegrist, 1995).  While this suggests some justification for
17:447:31521:28:27:79:524:184:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:analyzing RCC-adjusted charges rather than raw charges, the most compelling reason during
17:448:31610:27:28:79:507:157:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:the period we study is the growing inflation of rates charges to full paying customers and
17:449:31700:28:26:79:511:129:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:concomitant use of rebates for managed contracts, so that charge growth based on charges
17:450:31788:26:11:79:82:103:99:g_d0_f4:42:g_d0_f4:F:                                                          7
17:451:31847:11:12:82:520:92:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F: Discharges from managed care facilities exempted from standard accounting requirements were identified in
17:452:31953:12:0:79:520:80:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:the data by a zero recorded in data field for total charges, although actual charges were non-zero.  In total, this
18:453:32070:0:28:79:504:709:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:will overstate real cost increases (Dranove et al., 1991).  The advantage of using cost-to-
18:454:32161:28:27:79:523:681:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:charge ratios in this case is that increases in gross patient charges that are offset by increases
18:455:32259:27:28:79:522:654:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:in rebates result in a decrease in the cost-to charge ratio a calculated above, so that estimates
18:456:32356:28:28:79:533:626:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:of costs based on patient-level charges and RCCs are not inappropriately inflated by the use of
18:457:32451:28:27:79:116:598:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:rebates.
18:458:32459:27:28:115:507:571:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:In addition to the effects of discrepancies between costs and charges on aggregate
18:459:32541:28:27:79:513:543:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:charge growth, it is also important to consider the possibility that such discrepancies could
18:460:32634:27:28:79:527:516:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:have effects on costs across the spending distribution if they do not apply uniformly across it.
18:461:32730:28:28:79:511:488:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:Indeed, it is possible that the discrepancy between costs and charges could vary across the
18:462:32821:28:27:79:507:460:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:spending distribution.  For example, if the mark-up on low cost services and departments
18:463:32909:27:28:79:512:433:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:exceeds the mark-up on high-cost services and departments, then the actual distribution of
18:464:32999:28:27:79:525:405:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:costs across patients will be more concentrated than suggested by the distribution of charges.
18:465:33093:27:28:79:517:378:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:Though it is not clear that it is the case, it is possible that such mark-ups might change over
18:466:33188:28:28:79:505:350:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:time – for example if competition is particularly intense in high-cost services so that cost
18:467:33280:28:27:79:530:322:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:containment differentially reduces charges in these area. If so, it is possible that an analysis of
18:468:33379:27:28:79:497:295:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:hospital charges may overstate costs at the bottom of the distribution in later years, and
18:469:33469:28:27:79:317:267:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:understate costs at the top of the cost distribution.
18:470:33522:27:28:115:522:240:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:Although this would lead to patterns in hospital costs similar to those we find, we do
18:471:33608:28:28:79:515:212:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:not believe that internal cross-subsidization drives our results because we study a period in
18:472:33701:28:27:79:524:184:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:which all payers were tightening their reimbursement policies, thereby imposing a constraint
18:473:33793:27:28:79:515:157:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:on the extent to which hospitals could shift costs to other payers and departments.  Indirect
18:474:33886:28:27:79:489:129:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:support for this comes from Dranove and White (1998), who studied the responses of
18:475:33968:27:26:79:485:102:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:hospitals in California to Medicaid fee reductions between 1983 and 1992 and found
18:476:34050:26:12:79:532:76:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:                                                                                                                                                                                    
18:477:34230:12:0:79:231:64:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:involves omitting 8.8% of discharges.
19:478:34269:0:28:79:518:709:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:significant reductions in levels of services provided to all patients, and Medicaid patients in
19:479:34364:28:27:79:501:681:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:particular, but no evidence of cost-shifting.  The ideal data to test this would allow us to
19:480:34456:27:28:79:529:654:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:assess whether rebates were more likely for sicker patients within a hospital, but the available
19:481:34552:28:28:79:526:626:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:data do not permit this disaggregated analysis because rebates are not made on a patient level
19:482:34646:28:27:79:520:598:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:basis. However, as an alternative check, we examined whether hospitals in the OSHPD data
19:483:34734:27:28:79:513:571:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:that care for sicker patients as measured by either greater average age, length of stay or in-
19:484:34828:28:27:79:511:543:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:hospital mortality were likely to give greater rebates to payers as a percent of net revenue.
19:485:34921:27:28:79:525:516:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:Our results suggest no evidence of any significant relationship or change in relationship over
19:486:35015:28:28:79:529:488:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:time between rebates and age or length of stay, but do suggest a positive relationship between
19:487:35109:28:27:79:530:460:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:rebates and mortality in the first six years we study that is eliminated by the end of the period.
19:488:35207:27:28:79:507:433:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:While this latter result could suggest an artificial inflation of costs for the sickest patients
19:489:35303:28:27:79:337:405:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:initially that is later eliminated, the effect is not large.
19:490:35363:27:28:115:529:378:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:Thus, while there are possible reasons to be concerned that changes in the relationship
19:491:35450:28:28:79:526:350:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:between costs and charges across patients that differ in severity of illness could influence our
19:492:35546:28:55:79:413:322:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:results, we cannot find evidence of any changes in such relationships.
19:493:35616:55:27:79:269:267:145:g_d0_f5:145:g_d0_f5:C:Limitations of Cost and Financial Data
19:494:35654:27:28:115:507:240:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:Several data and analytic limitations should be recognized at the outset.  First, the
19:495:35739:28:28:79:533:212:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:1983-1993 period was one during which hospital accounting and reimbursement systems were
19:496:35827:28:27:79:502:184:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:in flux.  Hospitals are instructed by OSHPD to report the total charges incurred during a
19:497:35916:27:28:79:482:157:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:patient’s hospitalization according to the facility’s full-established rates prior to any
19:498:36005:28:27:79:518:129:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:prepayment deductions.  At a minimum, hospitals are to include all charges associated with
19:499:36095:27:0:79:509:102:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:daily hospital services, ancillary services, and patient care services in calculations of total
20:500:36192:0:28:79:528:709:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:inpatient charges per discharge.  Physician fees are omitted.  Due to the volume of discharges
20:501:36286:28:27:79:525:681:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:processed, OSHPD does not conduct comprehensive accounting checks; hence the reliability
20:502:36374:27:28:79:511:654:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:of reported data on charges is not known.  Nevertheless, the OSHPD charge data has been
20:503:36461:28:28:79:528:626:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:widely used by a variety of researchers (for example: Dranove and White, 1998; Melnick and
20:504:36551:28:27:79:507:598:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:Zwanziger, 1995; Langa and Sussman, 1993; Langa, 1992; Stafford, 1990; Robinson and
20:505:36634:27:28:79:149:571:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:Phibbs, 1989).
20:506:36648:28:27:115:530:543:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:Another issue relates to our lack of data concerning charges associated with outpatient
20:507:36735:27:28:79:533:516:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:care and forms of post-discharge care.  Since the introduction of PPS and managed care, many
20:508:36827:28:28:79:531:488:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:have speculated that any decline in hospital spending may be offset by growth in other sectors
20:509:36921:28:27:79:503:460:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:such as ambulatory and long-term care.  Since we are unable to account for cost-shifting
20:510:37009:27:28:79:502:433:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:across sites of delivery, our finding that growth in hospital charges fell among high-cost
20:511:37099:28:27:79:515:405:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:admissions does not imply that the total cost of treatment among high-cost admissions also
20:512:37189:27:28:79:510:378:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:fell, since these patients may be heavy consumers of post-discharge health care resources.
20:513:37279:28:28:79:518:350:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:However, we found no tendency for differential cost reduction among high cost admissions
20:514:37367:28:27:79:530:322:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:with increasing competition in diagnoses with high or increasing levels of discharge to skilled
20:515:37462:27:28:79:508:295:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:nursing facilities.  Moreover, even if such a pattern were found, it could be understood as
20:516:37553:28:27:79:499:267:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:providing insight into a mechanism by which quality discrimination was accomplished.
20:517:37637:27:28:115:513:240:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:A final point concerns the period over which we have data to analyze.  The earliest
20:518:37720:28:28:79:494:212:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:data we have date back to 1983, the year in which Medicare’s DRG-based Prospective
20:519:37802:28:27:79:525:184:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:Payment System was implemented, and legislation authorizing selective contracting between

20:521:37973:28:27:79:489:129:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:throughout the 1983-1993 period studied, HMOs and a variety of other managed care
20:522:38054:27:0:79:495:102:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:organizations emerged and proliferated.  Because we do not have comparable data that
21:523:38140:0:28:79:481:709:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:antedate these major changes and because important changes were happening in the
21:524:38220:28:27:79:523:681:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:reimbursement strategies for younger persons at the same time, it is important to be cautious
21:525:38313:27:28:79:525:654:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:in drawing a causal connection between these specific policies and observed trends in charge
21:526:38405:28:28:79:520:626:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:growth.  On the other hand, because Medicare PPS, Medi-Cal, and managed care all rely on
21:527:38493:28:27:79:529:598:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:different approaches to achieve cost containment, we can borrow insights from the theoretical
21:528:38586:27:28:79:495:571:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:models of provider responses to alternative reimbursement systems described above in

21:530:38696:27:28:115:510:516:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:Despite these limitations, the OSHPD data offer an opportunity to study growth in
21:531:38777:28:28:79:525:488:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:hospital charges over ten consecutive years.  Particularly advantageous are the availability of
21:532:38872:28:27:79:502:460:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:data through the early 1990s and across patients above and below age 65, enabling us to
21:533:38959:27:28:79:525:433:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:extend research examining the long-term effects of widespread movement towards fixed-rate
21:534:39048:28:27:79:498:405:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:prospective payment by contrasting the pattern of cost growth of older persons affected
21:535:39135:27:56:79:376:378:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:directly by prospective payment with that of younger persons.
21:536:39196:56:39:79:200:322:145:g_d0_f5:145:g_d0_f5:C:Measures of Competition
21:537:39219:39:27:115:531:283:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:A large literature exists attempting to identify the appropriate measures of markets and
21:538:39307:27:28:79:500:256:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:competition within health care.  Key debates in this literature include how one defines a
21:539:39396:28:27:79:511:228:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:market  (e.g. by county, distance, patient flows, or economic measures such as cross-price
21:540:39486:27:28:79:510:201:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:elasticities), whether one is interested in competition at the hospital level, medical service
21:541:39580:28:28:79:482:173:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:level, or patient level, and what mathematical measure of concentration is used (e.g.
21:542:39665:28:36:79:507:145:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:Herfindahl Index, entropy measure, etc.).8  Although these approaches may differ in their
21:543:39754:36:7:79:224:109:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:                                                          
21:544:39812:7:16:79:520:102:42:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:8 There is a large literature on defining hospital markets for the purpose of measuring competition. Traditional
21:545:39924:16:12:79:516:86:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:measures have included market definitions based on geopolitical boundaries such as counties or metropolitan
21:546:40031:12:0:79:517:74:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:statistical areas (e.g. Joskow (1980)), distance (Robinson and Luft (1985)), or patient flows (e.g. Melnick and
22:547:40144:0:28:79:526:709:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:theoretical appeal both in general and in individual applications, expediency has often been a
22:548:40238:28:27:79:515:681:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:prime criteria by which measures of competition are selected, and by far the most common
22:549:40326:27:28:79:519:654:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:approach chosen has been to calculate Herfindahl indexes for total admissions at the county
22:550:40417:28:28:79:509:626:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:level.9  In the analyses reported here, we follow this same approach.  Several studies have
22:551:40508:28:27:79:519:598:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:examined the robustness of the effects of competition to the measure chosen and some have
22:552:40597:27:28:79:488:571:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:found that their results depend on the definition of competition chosen (e.g. Dranove,
22:553:40683:28:27:79:519:543:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:Shanley, and Simon, 1992.; Sohn, 1996; Kessler and McClellan, 1999). As a result, we also
22:554:40772:27:56:79:532:516:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:plan in future work to attempt to repeat our analyses with alternative measures of competition.

22:556:40880:27:28:115:471:433:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:To analyze the effects of competition across the distribution of health care
22:557:40956:28:27:79:523:405:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:expenditures, we include measures of competition in quantile regressions of cost for patients
22:558:41049:27:28:79:518:378:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:above and below age 65 before the implementation of PPS in 1983, and in 1993.  Our basic
22:559:41137:28:28:79:525:350:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:hypothesis is that competition under PPS will exert a downward pressure on costs among the
22:560:41227:28:27:79:531:322:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:most expensive elderly patients in 1993 relative to its effects among the less expensive elderly
22:561:41323:27:28:79:527:295:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:in 1993, relative to the expensive elderly in 1983, and relative to its effects among the young.
22:562:41419:28:27:79:517:267:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:To pick the most appropriate comparison group among the young, we focus on persons age
22:563:41505:27:28:79:515:240:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:55-64, though our results are not substantially different when we include persons age 5-64.
22:564:41596:28:28:79:518:212:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:Since our theory does not specify a specific measure of concentration and since we have no
22:565:41686:28:25:79:516:184:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:reason to suspect a linear relationship between any particular measure of concentration and
22:566:41777:25:12:79:532:159:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:                                                                                                                                                                                    
22:567:41957:12:11:79:522:147:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:Zwanziger (1988)).  These measures have all been criticized for varying reasons, including the (ir)relevance of
22:568:42068:11:12:79:513:136:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:geopolitical boundaries or distance with respect to competition, and the endogeneity of patient flows.  While
22:569:42177:12:11:79:486:124:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:some newer approaches have tried to address these concerns (e.g. Kessler and McClellan, 1999), such
22:570:42276:11:12:79:504:113:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:approaches are substantially more difficult to implement, and their merits have not yet been demonstrated.
22:571:42382:12:11:79:508:101:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:While a comparison of multiple measures of competition would be of value, we therefore defer it for future
22:572:42488:11:0:79:102:90:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:work.
23:573:42495:0:28:79:532:709:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:costs, we define a set of indicator variables to categorize counties as competitiveness based on
23:574:42591:28:27:79:510:681:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:the Herfindahl Index (Less Competitive (HI>0.2), Moderately Competitive (0.2>HI>0.1),
23:575:42676:27:28:79:484:654:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:Competitive (0.1>HI>0.05), Very Competitive (HI<0.05). We also control for payer
23:576:42756:28:28:79:500:626:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:(Medicare, Medi-Cal, Other non-private, and private), and a variety of market-level and
23:577:42843:28:27:79:515:598:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:hospital characteristics.  The market level characteristics are: log physicians per capita, log
23:578:42938:27:28:79:514:571:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:HMO enrollment rate, log county population, and log average per capita income.  Hospital
23:579:43026:28:27:79:490:543:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:level characteristics are ownership status (for-profit vs. not for-profit), teaching status
23:580:43117:27:28:79:515:516:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:(teaching hospital vs. non-teaching hospital), number of licensed beds, and total number of
23:581:43208:28:28:79:531:488:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:annual discharges.  In our basic specification we do not control for patient characteristics such
23:582:43305:28:27:79:514:460:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:as age and comorbidity because PPS does not base much if any of reimbursement on those
23:583:43391:27:28:79:525:433:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:factors.  As a result, selectively caring for patients who are younger or have less comorbidity
23:584:43486:28:27:79:516:405:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:may be a mechanism by which hospitals respond to PPS and limit costs, so that controlling
23:585:43575:27:28:79:526:378:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:for those variables could mask the effect we aim to identify.  In alternative specifications, we
23:586:43671:28:28:79:524:350:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:also include patient age and the number of secondary diagnoses, and find little change in our
23:587:43764:28:27:79:150:322:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:overall results.
23:588:43780:27:28:115:520:295:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:We limit our analyses to 12 highest-volume DRGs, which we define as those with at
23:589:43861:28:27:79:526:267:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:least 10,000 discharges over the age of 4 in 1983 and 1994 combined.  An important concern
23:590:43951:27:28:79:524:240:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:in this analysis relates to the incentives under Medicare PPS for hospitals to engage in ‘DRG
23:591:44044:28:28:79:521:212:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:creep’, i.e. progressively up-code patients into DRGs with a higher reimbursement rate for a
23:592:44136:28:27:79:529:184:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:given condition (Carter, Newhouse, and Relles, 1990).  As a result, changes in charges within
23:593:44229:27:28:79:515:157:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:each stratified DRG might reflect trends in coding and classification rather than changes in
23:594:44321:28:32:79:506:129:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:service provision.  To address this concern, we aggregated DRGs for the same procedure
23:595:44407:32:7:79:532:97:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:

24:602:44941:27:28:79:531:571:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:points in the spending distribution over time and also to generate meaningful estimates of cost

24:604:45134:27:28:79:531:516:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:dramatic decline in admission rates in California over this period, since a given position in the
24:605:45231:28:28:79:492:488:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:spending distribution may reflect a different degree of severity in different years.  The
24:606:45320:28:27:79:497:460:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:California data show that per capita hospital discharge rates declined steadily from 112
24:607:45408:27:28:79:519:433:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:discharges per 1,000 total population in 1983 to 69 discharges per 1,000 total population by
24:608:45500:28:27:79:531:405:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:1994.  The decline in California’s discharge rates is consistent with national utilization trends,
24:609:45598:27:28:79:511:378:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:which began slowing in the 1970s but declined even further since the 1980s.  Much of the
24:610:45686:28:28:79:503:350:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:decline has been attributed to more widespread use of utilization control mechanisms by
24:611:45773:28:27:79:495:322:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:Medicare, state Medicaid programs, managed care and other third party payers.  These
24:612:45857:27:28:79:499:295:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:controls include peer-review organizations, physician gatekeepers, and pre-certification
24:613:45945:28:27:79:515:267:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:requirements employed by Medicare and other third party payers.  In California especially,
24:614:46035:27:28:79:526:240:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:declining rates of discharges may also reflect the expansion of HMO enrollment and the shift
24:615:46127:28:28:79:266:212:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:of many services to outpatient settings.

24:617:46247:27:37:79:499:157:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:implies that in each successive year, a smaller proportion of episodes of illness result in

25:623:46725:0:28:79:528:709:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:hospitalization.  If one were to rank all admissions in order of increasing severity of illness, it
25:624:46824:28:27:79:503:681:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:would be reasonable to assume that, given the nature of utilization control measures, the
25:625:46913:27:28:79:508:654:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:distribution would tend to be truncated from the left, leaving the least severely ill episode
25:626:47006:28:28:79:470:626:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:denied hospital admission.  Hence, not only does the proportion of the population
25:627:47087:28:27:79:474:598:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:experiencing hospitalization shrink over time, but the average severity level of the
25:628:47171:27:28:79:492:571:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:hospitalized population would be expected to increase as well because there are fewer
25:629:47256:28:27:79:347:543:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:‘healthy’ admissions to dilute the spending distribution.
25:630:47313:27:28:115:490:516:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:Figure 2 illustrates how shifts in utilization rates can complicate intertemporal
25:631:47394:28:28:79:529:488:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:comparisons of expenditures at specific locations within the population spending distribution.

25:633:47581:27:28:79:528:433:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:The Y-axis plots the frequency or number of individuals at each severity level.  The curves in
25:634:47675:28:27:79:517:405:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:Figures 2a and 2b depict the distribution of illness in a given population at two time points,
25:635:47769:27:28:79:533:378:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:(Year 0 and Year 1), which we assume to be stable.  H0 and H1 represent the discharge rates in
25:636:47863:28:28:79:482:350:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:Year 0 and Year 1, respectively.  In this hypothetical population, the top 50% of the
25:637:47948:28:27:79:481:322:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:population ranked in terms of morbidity were hospitalized in Year 0.  In Year 1, the
25:638:48032:27:28:79:208:295:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:admission rate fell to 40%.
25:639:48059:28:27:115:522:267:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:Suppose we wish to compare effects on median hospital charges between Year 0 and
25:640:48139:27:28:79:506:240:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:Year 1.  In Year 0, the median discharge (M0) was the patient at the 75th percentile of the
25:641:48230:28:28:79:513:212:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:disease distribution.  In Year 1, the median discharge (M1) was at the 80th percentile of the
25:642:48323:28:27:79:520:184:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:disease distribution.  Because of the falling discharge rate between Year 1 and Year 2, these
25:643:48416:27:28:79:514:157:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:two discharges are not directly comparable.  This is seen in Figure 2 by the dotted line that
25:644:48509:28:27:79:507:129:145:g_d0_f4:65:g_d0_f4:B:traces M0 down to the disease distribution in Year 1, and by the dotted line that traces M1
25:645:48600:27:0:79:526:102:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:above to the disease distribution in Year 0.  Thus, the median discharge in Year 0 was less ill
26:646:48697:0:28:79:516:709:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:than the median discharge in Year 1.  Without taking into account falling discharge rates, a
26:647:48789:28:27:79:516:681:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:simple comparison between the median hospitalizations in Year 0 and Year 1 will compare
26:648:48876:27:28:79:295:654:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:patients that differ in their severity of illness.
26:649:48926:28:28:115:502:626:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:To address this concern due to falling admission rates, we also performed all our
26:650:49007:28:27:79:525:598:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:analyses based on adjusted percentiles in which we aim to compare persons with comparable
26:651:49096:27:28:79:529:571:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:levels of severity of illness.  Therefore, we examine growth rates or the effects of competition
26:652:49192:28:27:79:528:543:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:at adjusted percentiles wherever discharge rates fell between two time points according to the
26:653:49286:27:28:79:120:516:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:formula:
26:654:49294:28:30:216:379:488:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:P0 = [(H0 – (H1*(1-P1))/H0]*100
26:655:49325:30:27:115:524:458:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A: where P0 is the adjusted percentile in the earlier time period (Y0), P0 is the percentile
26:656:49415:27:28:79:522:431:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:in the later time period (Y1), and H0  and H1 are the discharge rates in the two corresponding
26:657:49509:28:27:79:497:403:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:years.   For example, to compare costs at the median of the spending distribution of the
26:658:49597:27:28:79:524:376:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:hypothetical population, we should compare the median discharge in Year 1 to the discharge
26:659:49687:28:28:79:507:348:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:at the 60th percentile of discharges in Year 0  (60=[(50–(40*(1.5)))/60]*100.  We use this
26:660:49777:28:27:79:532:320:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:approach directly to calculate growth rates at different percentiles in the spending distribution.
26:661:49875:27:28:79:499:293:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:To analyze the effects of competition, we implement this adjustment by performing our
26:662:49960:28:27:79:488:265:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:regression analyses using the same number of observations drawn from the top of the
26:663:50043:27:28:79:353:238:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:distribution of the 1983 data as we have in the 1993 data.
26:664:50101:28:28:115:508:210:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:Our method of adjustment exploits the fact that discharges fell over time, and that
26:665:50184:28:27:79:515:182:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:utilization control mechanisms typically raised the threshold of illness severity for hospital
26:666:50278:27:28:79:515:155:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:admission. This raises several potential problems.  One is that in DRGs in which discharge
26:667:50368:28:27:79:495:127:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:rates rise over time, it is not clear whether expanded services were extended to the less
26:668:50457:27:0:79:526:100:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:severely ill, or if improvements in technology and medical management enabled treatment of
27:669:50549:0:28:79:522:709:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:a greater number of the severely ill who would otherwise have remained untreated.  Thus, in
27:670:50640:28:27:79:505:681:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:analyzing spending growth for the few DRGs  where admission rates rose, we use all the
27:671:50726:27:28:79:390:654:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:observations from 1983 and analyze only unadjusted percentiles.
27:672:50789:28:28:115:521:626:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:Probably more important is the possibility that reductions in admission did not come
27:673:50873:28:27:79:507:598:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:uniformly from the left tail of the distribution during this period.  In an extreme example,
27:674:50965:27:28:79:501:571:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:suppose that, although we assumed the reduction of 43 admissions per 1,000 population
27:675:51050:28:27:79:495:543:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:between 1983 and 1993 came from the right of the distribution (the ‘healthy’ side), the
27:676:51137:27:28:79:518:516:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:reductions actually came entirely from the right side of the distribution. This might happen,
27:677:51230:28:28:79:526:488:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:for example, if the 43 fewer admissions in 1993 were terminally ill individuals who had been
27:678:51322:28:27:79:517:460:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:shifted into hospices but who would have died in hospitals at high cost in 1983.  The top of
27:679:51414:27:28:79:526:433:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:the 1993 distribution would then be expected to have a lower average severity of illness level
27:680:51508:28:27:79:519:405:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:compared to the top of the 1983 distribution – the opposite of our assumption.  This implies
27:681:51600:27:28:79:518:378:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:that an unadjusted comparison would understate growth, and that our adjustment procedure
27:682:51688:28:28:79:532:350:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:would further exacerbate this.  Fortunately, for the diagnoses that we examine, we believe that
27:683:51783:28:27:79:532:322:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:most of the reductions in are due to the movement of less-severely ill patients to the outpatient
27:684:51880:27:28:79:518:295:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:setting.  This is supported by the observation that the greatest declines in admission rates in
27:685:51975:28:27:79:510:267:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:our sample were among admissions for Esophageal and Gastrointestinal Disorders, which
27:686:52060:27:28:79:494:240:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:likely results from a movement towards treatment if the least severely ill patients to an
27:687:52149:28:28:79:530:212:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:ambulatory setting.  It is also supported by additional analyses we performed that showed that
27:688:52243:28:27:79:503:184:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:the degree of comorbidity of patients in the DRGs we studied increased over our sample
27:689:52329:27:48:79:532:157:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:period.11  Nevertheless, we also examined the robustness of our findings under the assumption
27:690:52422:48:7:79:224:109:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:                                                          
27:691:52480:7:16:79:504:102:42:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:11 Specifically, we calculated the Charlson co-morbidity index based on secondary diagnoses for the index
27:692:52585:16:12:79:512:86:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:admission, and found that the distribution of scores shifted upwards in all our DRGs (Charlson et al. (1987);
27:693:52694:12:0:79:296:74:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:Deyo and Romano (1993), and Romano et al. (1993)).
28:694:52746:0:28:79:503:709:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:that the reduction in admissions is distributed evenly across the spending distribution by
28:695:52836:28:55:79:334:681:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:examining growth rates at the unadjusted percentiles.

28:698:52967:27:28:115:518:571:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:Tables 1 and 2 show the number of cases and distribution of costs in 1983 and 1993
28:699:53049:28:27:79:518:543:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:for the 12 DRGs we examine.   As Figure 1 shows clearly, the distribution of costs in every
28:700:53140:27:28:79:532:516:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:DRG is highly skewed to the right, with about two-thirds of all admissions having costs below
28:701:53233:28:28:79:533:488:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:the mean (Tables 1-2).  This lays out the basic incentives implicit in PPS – that the majority of
28:702:53330:28:27:79:522:460:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:patients are profitable, while a minority are unprofitable but potentially responsible for large

28:707:53653:27:28:79:517:295:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:majority of the unadjusted and adjusted growth rates clearly show falling growth rates with
28:708:53744:28:27:79:524:267:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:increasing position in the spending distribution, as predicted by the theoretical predictions of

28:711:53957:28:27:79:514:184:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:strong in several diagnoses as for those persons above age 65, there is still a clear trend for
28:712:54052:27:28:79:499:157:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:falling growth rates with increasing position in the spending distribution.  This is not as
28:713:54143:28:0:79:457:129:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:predicted by the theoretical model. We discuss possible reasons for this below.

29:719:54645:27:28:79:496:571:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:admissions for persons ages 55-64.  Table 7 reports the coefficients on the competition

29:721:54820:27:28:79:492:516:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:persons above age 65 and for persons ages 55-64.  We begin with the panel on the left
29:722:54905:28:28:79:527:488:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:examining admissions for persons above age 65.  Examining first the results for 1983, we see
29:723:54997:28:27:79:490:460:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:in every case that costs rise with increasing competition, and particularly for the most
29:724:55085:27:28:79:497:433:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:expensive admissions. This is consistent with the “medical arms race” literature, which
29:725:55172:28:27:79:516:405:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:suggests that under the retrospective reimbursement system in place at the beginning of the
29:726:55263:27:28:79:521:378:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:period we study, a more competitive hospital market will raise costs as hospitals compete to
29:727:55355:28:28:79:513:350:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:attract doctors and their patients by offering added services (Robinson and Luft, 1985).  In
29:728:55447:28:27:79:502:322:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:contrast, in 1993, increasing competitiveness is associated with decreased costs in all 12
29:729:55537:27:28:79:498:295:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:diagnoses.  This consistent with prior findings such as those of Melnick and Zwanziger
29:730:55623:28:27:79:506:267:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:(1988), who found that costs fell by more than 11% for hospitals in the most competitive
29:731:55711:27:28:79:532:240:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:markets in California during this period, while actually rising in the least competitive markets.
29:732:55808:28:28:79:533:212:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:Not addressed in their findings, however, is the strong pattern we observe for the reductions in
29:733:55904:28:27:79:493:184:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:expenditures with increasing competition to increase progressively along the spending
29:734:55989:27:28:79:520:157:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:distribution, as predicted by the incentives of PPS to selectively reduce expenditures among
29:735:56081:28:0:79:528:129:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:the most expensive patients.  For example, for AMI admissions among the elderly the highest
30:736:56174:0:28:79:503:709:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:level of competition is associated with $8,338 lower costs at the 95th percentile, but only
30:737:56265:28:27:79:273:681:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:$1,454 lower costs at the 25th percentile.
30:738:56307:27:28:115:523:654:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:The right hand panel of Table 7 repeats the above analyses for persons age 55-64.  In
30:739:56392:28:28:79:519:626:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:general, we still find strong positive effects of competition on costs in 1983, but in 1993 we
30:740:56486:28:27:79:527:598:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:find much smaller negative effects of competition on costs that are statistically significant for
30:741:56583:27:28:79:514:571:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:only 4 of the 12 DRGs.  Several DRGs also show a statistically insignificant trend towards
30:742:56673:28:27:79:529:543:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:lower costs with competition, raising the question whether some of the difference may be due
30:743:56765:27:28:79:502:516:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:to reduced sample size.  However, increasing the sample analyzed to include all persons
30:744:56852:28:28:79:521:488:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:below age 65 or adding additional years of data (e.g. 1992), did not meaningfully alter these
30:745:56945:28:27:79:499:460:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:results.  This suggests that whatever forces led to changes in the distribution of hospital
30:746:57036:27:28:79:509:433:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:expenditures in these diagnoses among the elderly between 1983 and 1993 may have also
30:747:57121:28:55:79:499:405:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:affected those below age 65, though the effects do not appear to have been as powerful.
30:748:57208:55:28:79:295:350:145:g_d0_f5:145:g_d0_f5:C:Adjustments for Changes in Discharge Rates
30:749:57250:28:27:115:486:322:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:To address the concern that percentiles in one year may not be comparable to
30:750:57326:27:28:79:521:295:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:percentiles in another year due to changes in severity of illness, especially due to declines in
30:751:57422:28:27:79:486:267:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:admission rates due to the shift of inpatient services to the outpatient setting, we also
30:752:57511:27:28:79:529:240:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:examined quantile regressions for DRGs in which admission rates fell from 1983 to 1993 that
30:753:57602:28:28:79:477:212:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:limited the number of observation in 1983 to the number in 1993, so as to compare
30:754:57683:28:27:79:518:184:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:“comparable” patients assuming no change in the underlying distribution of disease.  These
30:755:57773:27:0:79:461:157:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:were not substantively different than the regressions reported in Tables 5 and 6.
31:756:57856:0:28:79:250:709:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
31:757:57878:28:27:79:124:681:145:g_d0_f5:145:g_d0_f5:C:Summary
31:758:57885:27:28:115:517:654:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:Using annual patient discharge data from all non-federal, acute-care hospitals in the
31:759:57970:28:28:79:528:626:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:State of California from 1983 and 1993, we examined growth in hospital costs and the effects
31:760:58062:28:27:79:517:598:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:of competition on costs at various points in the spending distribution for persons above and
31:761:58154:27:28:79:520:571:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:below age 65 for the 12 largest diagnosis-related groups.  Our analyses of cost growth show
31:762:58245:28:27:79:510:543:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:cost growth falling with increasing position in the spending distribution in every DRG we
31:763:58334:27:28:79:524:516:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:studied, as predicted by the effects of Medicare PPS.  However, a very similar pattern is also
31:764:58428:28:28:79:521:488:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:evident among admissions of patients age 55-64.  Our analyses of the effects of competition
31:765:58519:28:27:79:521:460:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:show a strong trend for increasing competition to increase expenditures in all ages groups in
31:766:58612:27:28:79:532:433:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:1983, with increasing effects at higher locations in the spending distribution.  Our analyses for
31:767:58709:28:27:79:523:405:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:those above age 65 in 1993 show the opposite pattern, however, with increasing competition
31:768:58799:27:28:79:527:378:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:associated with decreased costs, and the effects far larger among the most expensive patients.
31:769:58893:28:28:79:497:350:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:Moreover, this pattern is not as pronounced among those below age 65, suggesting that
31:770:58978:28:27:79:516:322:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:spending on persons above age 65 during this period may have been subject to some forces
31:771:59066:27:28:79:389:295:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:different than those affecting spending on persons below age 65.
31:772:59130:28:27:115:501:267:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:These findings are broadly consistent with the model of provider behavior under
31:773:59209:27:28:79:525:240:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:alternative reimbursement schemes that we present.  This predicts a tendency for hospitals to
31:774:59302:28:28:79:527:212:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:‘skimp’ on unprofitable patients and to ‘milk’ profitable patients under fixed-rate prospective
31:775:59397:28:27:79:516:184:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:reimbursement.  Although a number of studies have documented lower resource utilization
31:776:59484:27:28:79:524:157:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:associated with fixed-rate reimbursement systems, fewer have considered the possibility that
31:777:59576:28:0:79:525:129:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:such reductions might differentially affect profitable and unprofitable classes of patients, and
32:778:59674:0:28:79:529:709:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:none have demonstrated these patterns of increasing cost reductions among high-cost patients
32:779:59766:28:55:79:499:681:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:for Medicare PPS, or shown that these reductions increase with increasing competition.
32:780:59852:55:28:79:134:626:145:g_d0_f5:145:g_d0_f5:C:Limitations
32:781:59863:28:27:115:491:598:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:Certainly the establishment of PPS and the associated incentives to selectively
32:782:59942:27:28:79:516:571:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:decrease costs among the most costly patients is a plausible explanation for the patterns we
32:783:60034:28:27:79:509:543:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:observe among the elderly, but several other possible explanations are worth considering.
32:784:60123:27:28:79:532:516:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:One is that there were changes in particular medical technologies or the underlying severity of
32:785:60218:28:28:79:524:488:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:illness among the elderly over this period that somehow selectively reduced expenditures for
32:786:60310:28:27:79:529:460:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:the high-cost elderly relative to the low cost-elderly.  Concerning in this regard is the fact that
32:787:60409:27:28:79:527:433:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:we see a fairly similar pattern of growth rates among those age 55-64.  It is not clear why this
32:788:60505:28:27:79:530:405:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:is the case, but it seems highly plausible that practice patterns are likely to be similar for older
32:789:60605:27:28:79:524:378:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:and younger patients, so that the incentives implicit in PPS end up affecting practice patterns
32:790:60700:28:28:79:500:350:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:for patients below age 65 as well.  Moreover, if the changes in spending we observe are
32:791:60787:28:27:79:524:322:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:explained by some specific change in underlying severity of illness or medical technology, it
32:792:60880:27:28:79:495:295:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:is not clear why such changes should occur over such a broad range of diagnoses or be
32:793:60965:28:27:79:506:267:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:associated with increased competition.  Also, in additional analyses we also stratified the
32:794:61056:27:28:79:509:240:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:elderly according to age and controlled for measurable aspects of underlying comorbidity
32:795:61144:28:28:79:457:212:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:using the number of secondary diagnoses, and found no changes in our results.
32:796:61221:28:27:115:516:184:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:Another possibility is that our results may reflect changes in coding practices under
32:797:61306:27:28:79:513:157:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:Medicare, often referred to as “DRG creep”.   We have tried to address this concern in our
32:798:61396:28:27:79:516:129:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:analysis by combining related DRGs with and without complications, but it is possible that
32:799:61486:27:0:79:529:102:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:this does not capture all the changes that could have occurred.  Indeed, one particular concern
33:800:61583:0:28:79:518:709:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:is that the development of the tracheostomy DRG in 1991 for patients requiring mechanical
33:801:61672:28:27:79:522:681:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:ventilation may have drawn some expensive patients out of the upper part of the distribution
33:802:61764:27:28:79:487:654:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:of costs of some of our DRGs.  While this is important to consider, the fraction of all
33:803:61851:28:28:79:520:626:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:admissions in that DRG is only 0.1% to 0.2%, which seems too modest to explain the broad
33:804:61939:28:27:79:517:598:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:changes we see across the spending distribution for such a broad range of diagnoses.  Also,
33:805:62030:27:28:79:522:571:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:some of the pattern we identify is clearly present by 1991, when the tracheostomy DRG was
33:806:62119:28:27:79:501:543:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:just being introduced.  Moreover, it is somewhat surprising that such recoding would be
33:807:62206:27:28:79:532:516:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:present only in the most competitive markets, though certainly that would also be of interest if
33:808:62302:28:28:79:527:488:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:it were the case.  It should also be noted that, to the extent that some of our diagnoses may be
33:809:62398:28:27:79:523:460:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:more highly reimbursed than other closely related diagnoses, they may also be the recipients
33:810:62490:27:28:79:474:433:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:of up-coding, in which case one would expect expenditures at the lower end of the
33:811:62571:28:27:79:423:405:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:distribution to decline as healthier patients are added to the distribution.
33:812:62647:27:28:115:529:378:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:Finally, it should also be noted that our findings that cost reductions are largest for the
33:813:62738:28:28:79:523:350:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:most expensive patients might also be interpreted as simply reflecting that it is easier to save
33:814:62834:28:27:79:497:322:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:large amounts of money where more money is being spent.  We are sympathetic to this
33:815:62917:27:28:79:494:295:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:concern, but note that we find a similar pattern of reductions in both our more and less
33:816:63005:28:27:79:529:267:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:expensive DRGs, and that it is not always the case that it is easier to decrease spending where
33:817:63100:27:28:79:490:240:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:more money is being spent. For example, in analyzing data from a natural experiment
33:818:63183:28:28:79:513:212:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:comparing the cost of hospital care provided by doctors who specialize in inpatient care to
33:819:63274:28:27:79:510:184:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:care by doctors who spend only a small fraction of their time taking care of inpatients, we
33:820:63365:27:28:79:514:157:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:found no evidence that cost savings differed across the distribution of costs (Meltzer et al.,
33:821:63459:28:0:79:110:129:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:2000).
34:822:63467:0:28:79:138:709:145:g_d0_f5:145:g_d0_f5:C:Conclusions
34:823:63478:28:27:115:509:681:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:With an understanding of the limitations of our analysis, it appears that increasing
34:824:63562:27:28:79:519:654:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:competition in the context of prospective payment is associated with selective reductions of
34:825:63654:28:28:79:499:626:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:expenditures for the most expensive patients.  Whether this is desirable is impossible to
34:826:63743:28:27:79:518:598:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:determine without an analysis of the effects on outcomes.  Nevertheless, our results suggest
34:827:63835:27:28:79:251:571:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:several clear lines for such analysis.
34:828:63873:28:27:115:505:543:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:First, the possibility that costs are selectively reduced for the most costly patients
34:829:63959:27:28:79:514:516:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:suggests that outcomes may also be selectively affected.  And while more than few studies
34:830:64048:28:28:79:532:488:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:have examined the effects of prospective payment on outcomes (e.g. Rodgers et al. (1990) and
34:831:64140:28:27:79:524:460:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:accompanying articles; Cutler, 1995), none has stratified outcomes according to patient cost.
34:832:64233:27:28:79:517:433:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:Our results suggest that such analyses might be very useful, since it is possible that adverse
34:833:64327:28:27:79:510:405:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:effects among the most costly patients might be masked by their inclusion along with less
34:834:64416:27:28:79:492:378:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:costly patients, whose outcomes may even improve if increased resources allocated to
34:835:64500:28:28:79:521:350:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:attracting them to a particular hospital have some positive (albeit small) effect on outcomes.
34:836:64594:28:27:79:523:322:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:The same conclusion applies for attempts to measure the effects of competition on outcomes
34:837:64684:27:28:79:247:295:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:(e.g. Kessler and McClellan, 1999)
34:838:64718:28:27:115:530:267:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:Additionally, our results have important implications for measuring the quality of care
34:839:64805:27:28:79:519:240:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:under prospective payment systems, and especially in competitive environments, since they
34:840:64894:28:28:79:529:212:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:suggest that high cost patients may be at particular risk in such contexts.  Thus, it is important
34:841:64992:28:27:79:522:184:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:that quality measures reflect the concerns of that potentially vulnerable group.  Even when a
34:842:65085:27:28:79:508:157:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:single measure of quality is used, our findings may have implications for how to measure
34:843:65173:28:27:79:507:129:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:quality of care.  For example, our findings may provide a justification to prefer outcomes
34:844:65263:27:0:79:512:102:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:measures to process measures, since process measures can suggest quality is high over the
35:845:65354:0:28:79:532:709:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:whole population when the quality of care for certain parts of the population are actually poor,
35:846:65450:28:27:79:516:681:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:while outcomes are often favorable for less severely ill (less costly) patients in any case, so
35:847:65545:27:28:79:526:654:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:expending greater resources on them is unlikely to improve outcomes.  It is worth noting that
35:848:65638:28:28:79:512:626:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:this basic conclusion remains regardless of whether one believes that cost reductions were
35:849:65728:28:27:79:528:598:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:largest among the most costly patients due to selective incentives within prospective payment
35:850:65821:27:28:79:511:571:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:or whether one simply believes that cost reductions are largest for the most costly patients
35:851:65913:28:27:79:518:543:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:simply because, as it has been said, “that’s where the money is”.  A related issue is whether
35:852:66006:27:28:79:486:516:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:the effects of competition on costs should be interpreted as reducing quality or rather
35:853:66093:28:28:79:528:488:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:improving efficiency.  Resolution of this question will only be possible with data that permits
35:854:66188:28:27:79:281:460:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:a comprehensive assessment of outcomes.
35:855:66227:27:28:115:522:433:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:It should also be noted that the combination of prospective payment and competition
35:856:66310:28:27:79:526:405:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:studied here is not unique to Medicare PPS, but in fact is the basic idea behind the increasing
35:857:66405:27:28:79:500:378:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:use of capitated managed care arrangements and competition to control costs, including
35:858:66491:28:28:79:509:350:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:perhaps most prominently Medicare managed care.  Indeed, such “managed competition”
35:859:66574:28:27:79:525:322:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:arrangements present similar incentives to expend resources to attract less costly participants
35:860:66669:27:28:79:513:295:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:while avoiding more costly ones.  It is not difficult to imagine these incentives resulting in
35:861:66763:28:27:79:527:267:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:substantial investments in wellness programs and preventive services, amenities that improve
35:862:66855:27:28:79:496:240:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:access for working persons, reductions in copayments, etc. that would attract relatively
35:863:66943:28:28:79:485:212:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:healthy participants.  Even casual observation of the offerings of health maintenance
35:864:67028:28:27:79:506:184:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:organizations leaves little question that many of these offerings are indeed occurring, but
35:865:67119:27:28:79:509:157:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:whether such expenditures are an efficient use of health care resources and how they may
35:866:67207:28:27:79:506:129:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:impact the care received by the most severely ill are important questions for future work.
35:867:67297:27:0:79:526:102:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:This is especially true given evidence that quality of care in HMOs may be worst for patients
36:868:67392:0:28:79:513:709:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:who are chronically ill (Miller and Luft, 1997), and that HMOs may limit expenditures for
36:869:67481:28:27:79:488:681:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:severely ill persons in intensive care (Rapoport, et al., 1992; Cher and Lenert, 1997) .
36:870:67569:27:28:115:506:654:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:A:Finally, it should be noted that there a variety of approaches that could be tried to
36:871:67654:28:28:79:522:626:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:improve upon existing prospective payment systems.  These include improved risk adjusters
36:872:67743:28:27:79:493:598:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:and use of “blended” payment systems that include both prospective and retrospective
36:873:67827:27:28:79:520:571:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:components to lessen the incentives for patient selection or the provision of too much or too
36:874:67920:28:27:79:528:543:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:little care.  Indeed, the Medicare Prospective Payment System has always tied reimbursement
36:875:68011:27:28:79:482:516:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:to the amount of care provided to some extent and thus never been fully prospective
36:876:68094:28:28:79:499:488:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:(McClellan, 1997).  Moreover, proposals have been seriously considered to expand this
36:877:68179:28:27:79:509:460:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:retrospective aspect of Medicare PPS as well as to improve risk adjusters by developing a
36:878:68268:27:28:79:485:433:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:B:DRG system that allows a finer classification of admissions (Newhouse, Buntin, and
