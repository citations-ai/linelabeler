2:24:1140:28:28:273:338:616:12:Times:12:Times:C:ABSTRACT
2:25:1148:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:During the 1970s the US underwent an important change in its divorce laws, switching from mutual
2:26:1244:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:consent to a unilateral divorce regime.  Who benefitted and who lost from this change?  To answer
2:27:1341:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:this question we develop a dynamic life-cycle model in which agents make consumption, saving, labor
2:28:1440:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:force participation (LFP), and marriage and divorce decisions subject to several shocks and given a
2:29:1539:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:particular divorce regime.  We calibrate the model using statistics relevant to the life-cycle of the 1940
2:30:1645:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:cohort. Conditioning solely on gender, our ex ante welfare analysis finds that women would fare better
2:31:1747:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:under mutual consent whereas men would prefer a unilateral system. Once we condition not only on
2:32:1843:14:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:gender but also on initial productivity, we find that men in the top three quintiles of the initial productivity
2:33:1955:14:14:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:distribution are made better off by a unilateral system as are the top two quintiles of women; the rest
2:34:2058:14:14:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:prefer mutual consent. We also find that although the change in divorce regime had only a small effect
2:35:2160:14:14:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:on the LFP of married women in the 1940 cohort, these effects would be considerably larger for a
2:36:2256:14:42:72:382:434:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:cohort who lived its entire life under a unilateral divorce system.

3:48:2508:0:32:90:194:691:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:1  Introduction
3:49:2523:32:20:90:516:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:During the 1970s the US underwent an important change in its divorce laws.A large
3:50:2604:20:20:90:518:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:number of states switched from a legal regime in which divorce requires spouses’ mutual
3:51:2691:20:21:90:517:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consent to a unilateral regime in which one spouse’s desire to divorce is sufficient. Over the
3:52:2785:21:20:90:519:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:same time period, many European countries underwent a similar legal reform.1These legal
3:53:2872:20:20:89:517:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:changes were accompanied, both in the US and in Europe, by large increases in the divorce
3:54:2961:20:21:89:515:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rate and married women’s labor supply and by a reversal of the male-femaleeducation
3:55:3044:21:20:89:516:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:gap.   Not surprisingly, the contemporaneous nature of these changes has givenrise to
3:56:3129:20:20:89:517:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a growing literature that attempts to understand the links between divorce laws, divorce
3:57:3217:20:20:89:330:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rates, women’s labor supply and education choices.
3:58:3267:20:21:106:516:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In this paper we examine the welfare implications of different divorce regimes.  Who
3:59:3351:21:20:89:518:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:benefited and who lost from this change?  This is a hard question to answer as it requires
3:60:3441:20:20:89:517:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:knowing not only how marriage formation and dissolution respond to different divorce
3:61:3525:20:21:89:517:416:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:regimes, but also how endogenous household decision variables such as saving and labor
3:62:3611:21:20:89:516:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:supply are affected.   Given the complexity of the issue, making headway requires a
3:63:3694:20:20:89:514:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:quantitative model in which to analyze the key mechanisms and quantify their final impact.
3:64:3784:20:21:106:519:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To do this, we develop a relatively simple dynamic life-cycle model of endogenous marital
3:65:3873:21:20:89:519:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:status in which female and male agents, endowed with an initial level ofproductivity,
3:66:3958:20:20:89:517:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:make consumption, saving, labor force participation (LFP), and marriage/divorce decisions
3:67:4047:20:21:89:517:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:subject to a variety of shocks and given a particular divorce regime.  The environment is
3:68:4136:21:20:89:517:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:one of imperfect capital/insurance markets and very little commitment.  Capital markets
3:69:4223:20:20:89:517:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are imperfect in that, although agents can borrow and save freely at a constant interest
3:70:4311:20:21:89:518:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rate, debt is not state-contingent and thus borrowing is subject to the constraint of not
3:71:4400:21:20:89:516:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:defaulting in any state.  Insurance markets are also absent: agents are unable to directly
3:72:4490:20:20:89:517:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:insure themselves against shocks, be these productivity or marital related.  Lastly, the
3:73:4578:20:21:89:517:172:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ability of agents to commit within a marriage is also severely limited.We assume that
3:74:4663:21:20:89:516:151:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:agents cannot write binding prenuptial contracts nor commit to futureactions within a
3:75:4748:20:20:89:209:131:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:marriage or upon divorce.
3:76:4773:20:16:106:536:111:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We are particularly interested in how divorce regimes affect women versus men. Accordingly,
3:77:4864:16:0:102:464:95:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:1See Gonz ́alez and Viitanen (2009) for a very useful review of the European legal reforms.
4:78:4956:0:21:90:516:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:our model and its calibration incorporate three salient gender asymmetries arising from a
4:79:5045:21:20:90:518:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:variety of cultural, institutional and economic factors. First, we allow women’s disutility of
4:80:5139:20:20:90:515:650:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:working to depend on marital status and on the age of her children; second,our calibration
4:81:5229:20:21:90:517:630:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:respects the fact that children tend to live with their mother andthat divorced women bear
4:82:5319:21:20:90:519:609:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a disproportionate share of the cost of raising children; and, third, wecalibrate the model
4:83:5410:20:20:90:275:589:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to match the existing gender wage gap.
4:84:5448:20:21:106:516:569:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Marriage matters in this environment for a variety of reasons.  It provides not only
4:85:5532:21:20:89:517:548:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:“love,” but also economies of scale in consumption and some degree of insurance against
4:86:5619:20:20:89:518:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:income shocks.   On the other hand, marriage also exposes agents to other types of
4:87:5701:20:21:89:518:508:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:uncertainty (e.g., in the future quality of the match) as well as to the potential pain of
4:88:5791:21:20:89:516:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:divorce neither of which is insurable.2From an insurance perspective, it is easy to see
4:89:5878:20:20:89:517:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that, ceteris paribus, a mutual consent divorce regime provides more income insurance
4:90:5963:20:21:89:517:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:than a unilateral divorce regime.  Under mutual consent, the reluctantspouse must be
4:91:6047:21:20:89:517:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:compensated in order to obtain a divorce.  A unilateral regime, on the other hand, does
4:92:6134:20:20:89:515:406:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:not impose this restriction. It allows the agent to walk away but thisgreater freedom may
4:93:6223:20:21:89:517:386:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:come at additional costs, ranging from being the partner who is left to the potential costs
4:94:6314:21:20:89:517:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:arising from endogenously changed marriage patterns and household choices.Who benefits
4:95:6400:20:20:89:498:345:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:from the tradeoffs provided by the divorce regimes is our primary question of interest.
4:96:6487:20:21:106:517:325:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We calibrate the model using statistics relevant to the life-cycle of the 1940 cohort. We
4:97:6576:21:20:89:517:304:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:choose this cohort mainly for data reasons since the birth year impliesthat the comparable
4:98:6666:20:20:89:516:284:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:CPS data for LFP and wages are available for their entire working life until age 70 (in
4:99:6753:20:21:89:521:264:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:2010) and the 2001 and 2004 SIPP provide a broad coverage of their marital histories.
4:100:6838:21:20:89:517:243:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:This cohort is also of interest since it lived under both divorce regimes at different points
4:101:6931:20:20:89:183:223:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:over its working life.
4:102:6953:20:21:106:517:203:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We match match several key moments related to divorce, marriage, and women’s labor
4:103:7035:21:20:89:515:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:force participation (LFP).  In particular, we discipline the distribution of match quality
4:104:7125:20:20:89:516:162:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:draws and the parameters governing love’s law of motion over the lifecycle by requiring
4:105:7212:20:21:89:519:142:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the model to fit divorce and marriage rates and their durations at different ages, as well
4:106:7302:21:15:89:515:121:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:as generating the income elasticities of marriage and divorce implied bythe data.  With
4:107:7389:15:15:102:516:106:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:2Of course, marriage may have other benefits such as allowing greater specialization in household
4:108:7486:15:0:90:419:91:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:production (see, e.g., Weiss (1997)), from which we abstract in this simple setting.
5:109:7571:0:21:90:516:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:respect to women’s work, we require the model to generate the correct moments for married
5:110:7660:21:20:90:517:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and divorced women’s LFP at different points of their life-cycle. These moments discipline
5:111:7750:20:20:90:517:650:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the disutility of working when married versus divorced and with nochildren versus younger
5:112:7839:20:21:90:518:630:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and older children.  The endogeneity of women’s LFP allows us to addressthe question of
5:113:7926:21:20:90:515:609:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the contribution of the change in divorce regime to the rise of married women’s LFP, an
5:114:8013:20:20:90:269:589:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:issue of great interest in its own right.
5:115:8054:20:21:106:518:569:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We then use the quantitative model to study who gains from a system ofunilateral
5:116:8134:21:20:89:516:548:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:versus mutual consent divorce. Since our model has two important sources of heterogeneity
5:117:8223:20:20:89:517:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:– gender and productivity – we conduct two welfare analyses.   The first is an ex-ante
5:118:8309:20:21:89:517:508:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:approach in which agents are distinguished only by their gender.   It thus answers the
5:119:8395:21:20:89:515:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:question: conditioning solely on your gender, would you prefer to livein a world in which
5:120:8484:20:20:89:517:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:divorce is unilateral or in one that requires both spouses’ consents? The second analysis is
5:121:8576:20:21:89:516:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:also ex ante but conditions not only on gender but also on the agent’s initialproductivity
5:122:8666:21:20:89:517:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:endowment.  We thus ask: if you knew both your gender andexpectedwage profile over
5:123:8748:20:20:90:459:406:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:your life-cycle, would you prefer a regime that makes divorce easier orharder?
5:124:8826:20:21:106:516:386:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Our analysis generates several interesting findings.  First, we findthat although the
5:125:8911:21:20:90:514:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:change in divorce regime generated a relatively small increased in married women’s LFP
5:126:8997:20:20:90:518:345:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for the 1940 cohort (a result which is in line with most of the literaturein this area, e.g.,
5:127:9090:20:21:90:515:325:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Lundberg and Rose (1999), Parkman (1992), Stevenson (2008)), the consequences would
5:128:9173:21:20:90:519:304:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:have been be substantially amplified for a cohort which has always lived under a unilateral
5:129:9264:20:20:90:519:284:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:divorce system.  Our analysis indicates that this result is mostly driven by an optimal
5:130:9351:20:21:90:518:264:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:response to the increased risk of divorce in face of the conflicting preferences of spouses
5:131:9442:21:20:90:515:243:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:vis a vis consumption smoothing rather than by the change in the composition of married
5:132:9529:20:20:90:125:223:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:couples.
5:133:9537:20:21:106:515:203:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Second, conditioning solely on gender, our ex ante welfare analysis findsthat women
5:134:9620:21:20:90:519:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:would fare better under mutual consent whereas men would prefer a unilateral system.
5:135:9704:20:20:90:518:162:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:To understand this result note that, for agivenpattern of marriages, the welfare impact
5:136:9791:20:21:90:518:142:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of being granted the ability to walk away from one’s spouse without incurring additional
5:137:9879:21:20:90:517:121:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:compensation costs depends on the frequency with which an agent may wish to do so relative
5:138:9969:20:0:90:517:101:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to her/his spouse and how the agent fares when divorced relative to married. Since, ceteris
6:139:10061:0:21:90:516:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:paribus, women earn less than men and also bear a larger share of the cost of raising
6:140:10146:21:20:90:517:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:children upon divorce, their welfare losses from divorce are larger andthus they are more
6:141:10235:20:20:90:516:650:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:likely to benefit from a mutual consent regime.  Men, on the other hand,are more likely
6:142:10322:20:21:90:517:630:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to gain from a unilateral divorce regime although this is not ensured ex ante as the greater
6:143:10414:21:20:90:517:609:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ease of divorce also exposes them to greater uncertainty which, ceteris paribus, is welfare
6:144:10505:20:20:90:517:589:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:reducing.  Marriage patterns, of course, will themselves react to thewelfare consequences
6:145:10594:20:21:90:516:569:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of easier divorce.  The greater instability of marriage leads women to become considerably
6:146:10684:21:20:90:519:548:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:more reluctant to marry whereas men become more willing.  Overall, marriage rates fall,
6:147:10771:20:20:90:518:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:implying that a greater proportion of women are willing to forego some of thepotential
6:148:10857:20:21:90:516:508:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consumption insurance provided by marriage in favor of decreasing their vulnerability to
6:149:10945:21:20:90:516:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:becoming a divorced woman with young children, a probability that is higher under a
6:150:11028:20:20:90:516:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:unilateral system even with after taking into account the endogenous response of household
6:151:11118:20:21:90:309:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:formation to the change in the divorce regime.
6:152:11164:21:20:106:533:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Third, once ex-ante welfare is conditioned not only on gender but also on initial productivity,
6:153:11259:20:20:89:517:406:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:we find significant differences in preferences along this dimension.  Men in the top three
6:154:11349:20:21:89:512:386:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:quintiles of the initial productivity distribution are made better off by a unilateral system
6:155:11442:21:20:89:516:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:as are the top two quintiles of women; the remainder prefer mutual consent. The preceding
6:156:11531:20:20:89:515:345:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:explanation gives much of the intuition behind this result. Ex ante richer women and men
6:157:11619:20:21:89:517:325:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:value more the freedom of walking away from an unsatisfactory marriage than its insurance
6:158:11708:21:20:89:515:304:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:benefits.  Even if they are left by their spouse, they fare better in the divorced state than
6:159:11801:20:20:89:515:284:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:their poorer counterparts.  Poorer individuals are hit hardest by the loss of insurance and
6:160:11892:20:21:89:516:264:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:economies of scale from marriage, leading poorer women in particular to become more averse
6:161:11982:21:20:89:152:243:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:to marriage.3
6:162:11995:20:20:106:515:223:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Our paper is organized as follows.  The next subsection briefly reviews the literature in
6:163:12084:20:21:89:518:203:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:this area.  The following section introduces the model in the context of the two different
6:164:12174:21:20:89:523:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:divorce regimes. Section 3 presents the households’ marital status decisions and maximization
6:165:12267:20:20:89:517:162:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:problems over different stages of their life cycle.  Section 4 discusses the calibration of the
6:166:12362:20:21:89:516:142:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:model to key moments relevant for the 1940 cohort and section 5 examines some of the
6:167:12446:21:15:89:518:121:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:parameterized model’s implications.  In that section we study how divorce regimes affect
6:168:12534:15:0:102:293:106:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:3This accords with the findings of Rasul (2005).
7:169:12583:0:36:90:504:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:married women’s LFP. Section 6 presents the welfare analysis and section 7 concludes.
7:170:12668:36:27:90:226:655:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f8:C:A Brief Literature Review
7:171:12693:27:21:90:518:628:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Our paper contributes to a growing literature that seeks to understand the interplay of
7:172:12780:21:20:90:517:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:household formation, divorce regimes, women’s labor supply, and consumption/savings
7:173:12863:20:20:90:516:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:decisions.   The earlier literature in this area is mostly empiricaland based on using
7:174:12949:20:21:90:518:567:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:presumably exogenous cross-state variation in the timing of the introduction of unilateral
7:175:13039:21:20:90:517:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:divorce to gain insights into the implications of divorce laws for a variety of issues.  This
7:176:13132:20:20:90:518:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:literature has debated the effect of unilateral divorce on the divorce rate (see, e.g., Peters
7:177:13226:20:21:90:519:506:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(1986), Peters (1992), Allen (1992), and Friedberg (1998)) and female labor supply (e.g.,
7:178:13315:21:20:90:517:485:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Parkman (1992) and Gray (1998)). Wolfers (2006) reviews the literature on the divorce rate
7:179:13405:20:20:90:518:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and, using a more flexible approach regarding its dynamic effects, concludes that unilateral
7:180:13497:20:21:90:516:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:divorce laws temporarily increased divorce rates but that this effect disappears after 10
7:181:13586:21:20:90:519:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:years.4Stevenson (2008) provides a review of the literature regarding the effect of unilateral
7:182:13680:20:20:90:516:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:divorce on female labor supply.  This literature had found contradictoryresults depending
7:183:13769:20:21:90:516:384:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on whether differences in property division laws were included ascontrols.  By including a
7:184:13859:21:20:90:517:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:richer set of controls for state-level time-varying policies, Stevenson (2008) finds a significant
7:185:13957:20:20:90:516:343:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:positive effect on the labor supply of both married and single women that isinvariant to
7:186:14045:20:21:90:358:323:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:the legal regime governing property division at divorce.5
7:187:14102:21:20:106:516:302:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Given their methodology, regression based analyses are not well-suited to examining
7:188:14185:20:20:90:515:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:welfare consequences.  Some positive evidence in favor of the unilateral system is provided
7:189:14276:20:21:90:516:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by Stevenson and Wolfers (2006) who show that the introduction of unilateral divorce
7:190:14360:21:20:90:516:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is linked to a decrease in both female suicides and domestic violence.  On the negative
7:191:14447:20:20:90:517:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:side, Stevenson (2007) finds that investment in marriage-specific capital falls (e.g. spouse’s
7:192:14541:20:21:90:516:201:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:education and household specialization).  The full economic consequences are harder to
7:193:14627:21:20:90:515:180:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:study but Weitzman (1996) and Peterson (1996), among others, document a sharpfall in
7:194:14711:20:16:90:260:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:women’s consumption upon divorce.
7:195:14744:16:15:102:516:144:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:4While some papers in the literature have defined divorce rates as the number of divorces per a certain
7:196:14847:15:11:90:518:129:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:married population, others have defined it using instead the entire population.   We follow the former
7:197:14949:11:7:90:133:118:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:convention.
7:198:14960:7:14:102:518:111:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:5Given Stevenson’s evidence, our paper abstains from modelingdifferences in property division and it
7:199:15060:14:0:90:470:97:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:too finds a positive effect on married women’s LFP from the introduction of unilateral divorce.
8:200:15156:0:21:106:519:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:More recently, computational advances have made it feasible to use life-cycle models of
8:201:15243:21:20:90:517:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:endogenous marital status to contribute to our understanding of divorceregimes.6The
8:202:15326:20:20:89:517:650:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:seminal paper in this area is Mazzocco, Ruiz, and Yamaguchi (2007) which studies the
8:203:15410:20:21:89:518:630:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:interactions between female LFP, savings, and marital decisions in an estimated model
8:204:15495:21:20:89:517:609:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:with limited commitment.  In this model, the Pareto weights in the married household’s
8:205:15581:20:20:89:517:589:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:maximization problem under unilateral divorce can evolve endogenously thus allowing some
8:206:15669:20:21:89:518:569:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:commitment and ensuring that divorce, when it happens, is efficient(i.e. when an agent
8:207:15755:21:20:89:516:548:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:can no longer be compensated within the marriage for her/his higher outside option in a
8:208:15842:20:20:89:516:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:way that is Pareto improving).  Perhaps not surprisingly, this model is computationally
8:209:15929:20:21:89:516:508:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:extremely demanding and various authors have simplified different aspects of it in order to
8:210:16020:21:20:89:516:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:better study their question of interest (e.g. Marcassa (2013), Voena (2012), and Guvenen
8:211:16108:20:20:89:281:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and Rendall (2013), all discussed below).
8:212:16149:20:21:106:517:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Guvenen and Rendall (2013) develop an overlapping generations model of endogenous
8:213:16230:21:20:90:517:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:marital status and education choices to study the interplay betweenmarital risk and the
8:214:16317:20:20:90:517:406:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:gender gap in education. Legal changes which facilitate divorce lead women toinvest more
8:215:16405:20:21:90:517:386:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in education.  This in turn leads to higher divorce rates and lower marriage rates, further
8:216:16496:21:20:90:517:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:increasing the attractiveness of higher education. Their model relies on the same key gender
8:217:16588:20:20:90:516:345:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:asymmetries as in Fern ́andez and Wong (2011) which ensure that divorced women fare worse
8:218:16677:20:21:90:519:325:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:than their male counterparts: lower labor earnings and a larger share of children’s expenses.
8:219:16770:21:20:90:519:304:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:These asymmetries then drive the asymmetric education response by gender.7This paper,
8:220:16855:20:20:90:517:284:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:however, is more similar in spirit to Greenwood, Guner, Kocharkov, and Santos (2012) as
8:221:16942:20:17:90:515:264:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:household decisions, other than marital status, are static (e.g., no savings or accumulation
8:222:17034:17:15:102:517:247:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:6A small literature has studied the consequences of marital instability on various outcomes by keeping
8:223:17136:15:11:90:516:232:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:marital status exogenous (see, e.g., Eckstein and Lifshitz (2011) and Fern ́andez and Wong (2013) on married
8:224:17244:11:10:90:517:221:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:women’s LFP, Cubeddu and R ́ıos-Rull (2003) on household savings, Flinn and Brown (2011) on child

8:228:17645:11:11:90:516:178:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:education and Jacquemet and Robin (2011) for a search model which examines the effect of divorce risk on
8:229:17749:11:7:90:144:167:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:labor supply).
8:230:17763:7:15:102:519:160:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:7Our model also allowed for savings, thus providing an alternative insurance channel beyond education.
8:231:17865:15:11:90:519:145:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:Marital status, however, was assumed to be exogenous and we werethus unable to study the full set of
8:232:17965:11:11:90:516:134:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:endogenous interactions between education and marital status choices (though we allowed the distribution
8:233:18069:11:11:90:517:123:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:of shocks to be education dependent).  We too found that the education gap narrowed, but not by as large
8:234:18173:11:11:90:517:112:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:an extent as Guvenen and Rendall (2013).  This may be because we also allow agents to save as a way to
8:235:18275:11:0:90:253:101:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:insure themselves against divorce shocks.
9:236:18317:0:21:90:516:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of labor market experience) which greatly reduces computational complexity. This strategy
9:237:18406:21:20:90:518:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:makes sense since both sets of authors are mainly interested in a longerhistory of changes
9:238:18496:20:20:90:518:650:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in female LFP, education, and divorce rates, and less concerned with capturing features of
9:239:18586:20:21:90:515:630:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the life-cycle.  Our current paper, on the other hand, takes productivity as exogenous and
9:240:18676:21:20:90:449:609:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:hence does not capture the education response that is the main focus there.
9:241:18751:20:20:106:518:589:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Both Marcassa (2013) and Voena (2012) are mainly interested in the interactionof
9:242:18831:20:21:90:516:569:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:divorce regimes and different financial arrangements.  They both conclude that women
9:243:18915:21:20:90:517:548:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are better off under a unilateral regime if financial arrangements favor women (e.g. under
9:244:19005:20:20:90:516:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:equitable division or with a high level of alimony).  This result is largely driven by the
9:245:19095:20:21:90:516:508:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:fact that the women’s outside option is higher under these circumstances.  Unlike in a
9:246:19181:21:20:90:516:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:mutual consent regime, unilateral divorce allows the value of this higher outside option to
9:247:19272:20:20:90:516:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:influence the Pareto weights in marriage thus making women better off.  Our framework
9:248:19357:20:21:90:519:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:yields different results in part because, although the value of the outside option affects all
9:249:19451:21:20:90:516:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:decisions (e.g. who and when to marry, divorce, savings, etc.), it does not affect the Pareto
9:250:19544:20:20:90:518:406:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:weights in the married household’s maximization problem per se given our assumption of
9:251:19630:20:21:90:517:386:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:no commitment.  The two sets of assumptions regarding Pareto weights lie at opposite
9:252:19714:21:20:90:517:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:extremes and both are important to understand.  Hence, these papers should be seen as
9:253:19799:20:43:90:168:345:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:complementary.8
9:254:19814:43:31:90:187:302:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:2  The Model
9:255:19826:31:21:90:517:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We develop a dynamic life-cycle model to study the consequencesof different divorce
9:256:19909:21:20:90:517:250:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:regimes.  There are several ingredients that we consider important tounderstanding the
9:257:19995:20:20:90:517:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:welfare consequences of divorce. First, marital status is endogenous asis married women’s
9:258:20084:20:16:90:518:210:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:labor supply.  Second, markets are imperfect: there is no insurancefor income, marital,
9:259:20171:16:15:102:519:194:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:8Another potentially important reason for the difference in results lies in the calibration strategy followed.
9:260:20281:15:11:90:517:179:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:In both Marcassa (2013) and Voena (2012) agents begin life married.  In Marcassa (2013), the first divorce
9:261:20387:11:11:90:518:168:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:is an absorbing state; in Voena (2012) the second marriage is an absorbing state.  Thus, in Marcassa’s
9:262:20489:11:11:90:517:157:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:framework, divorce is very costly since it lasts forever.  In Voena (2012), remarriage is the only time an
9:263:20595:11:11:90:518:146:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:agent makes a marriage decision and it provides long-lasting insurance since no further divorces or changes
9:264:20702:11:11:90:518:135:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:in match quality are possible by assumption, making marriage veryvaluable.  In our model, on the other
9:265:20804:11:11:90:517:124:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:hand, agents start life as single and can make marital status decisions numerous times which allows it to
9:266:20909:11:11:90:518:113:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:more realistically capture the extent of marital status uncertainly and better reflect the values of marriage
9:267:21018:11:0:90:137:102:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:and divorce.
10:268:21031:0:21:90:516:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:or fertility shocks and debt is not state contingent.  Third, the ability to commit within a
10:269:21123:21:20:90:516:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:marriage is very limited: the behavior of married individuals must satisfy the solution to
10:270:21213:20:20:90:517:650:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the household’s maximization problem and spouses are unable to commit tofuture actions
10:271:21299:20:21:90:519:630:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:within marriage or contingent upon divorce other than those specified by the legal regime.
10:272:21389:21:20:90:516:609:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Fourth, the model respects several key gender asymmetries regarding how children are
10:273:21473:20:20:90:517:589:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:allocated after a divorce and the gender wage gap.  We also allow work disutility to differ
10:274:21564:20:21:90:424:569:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by gender and marital status.  The model is described in detail below.

10:278:21885:21:20:89:515:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:characterizes a particular feature of their potential match as discussed in the section on

10:280:22012:20:21:106:517:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:An agent’s life has two stages: work and retirement.   Agents have a deterministic

10:296:22985:16:15:102:519:132:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:9We do not include cohabitation as an option as this alternative was less common for the 1940 cohort.
10:297:23086:15:11:90:517:117:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:See, e.g. Gemici and Laufer (2010) for a dynamic analysis in which agents choose between those marriage
10:298:23189:11:11:90:516:106:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:and cohabitation.  In that model, cohabitation has similarities with unilateral divorce in that it allows an

12:341:25945:21:20:90:516:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by assuming that agents are endowed with a permanent potential marital type.   The
12:342:26027:20:20:90:517:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:“type” is given by the initial endowment of one’s partner’s productivity,z′0.  Each agent
12:343:26116:20:21:89:516:425:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is informed of her/his marital type in period zero and this characteristic is updated with
12:344:26206:21:20:89:517:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the realizations of its innovations over time.  This assumption implies that with respect

12:346:26381:20:21:89:515:364:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:uncertainty associated with the evolution of apotentialmate’s income process rather than

12:350:26737:21:20:89:515:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for details).  We further simplify by assuming that singles marry other singles; divorced
12:351:26826:20:20:89:257:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:agents marry other divorced agents.
12:352:26861:20:21:106:515:242:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:There are several other important characteristics of a potential maritalpartner in
12:353:26943:21:20:89:517:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:addition to her/his productivity: the quality of the match, the level of assets, and whether
12:354:27035:20:20:89:516:201:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the woman has children from another marriage and whether the man, in addition to children
12:355:27124:20:21:89:457:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:from a prior marriage has an unmarried ex spouse.  We discuss each in turn.
12:356:27199:21:20:106:517:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In this model, love is mutual.  At the beginning of each period, unmarried individuals
12:357:27285:20:20:89:516:140:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:draw a match qualityqτt∼N(-τq,σq) where the mean of the distribution may depend upon
12:358:27369:20:16:90:516:120:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the age of the potential couple.  We distinguish between matches formedwhile “young”
12:359:27453:16:11:98:497:104:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:10A woman who enters retirement divorced also receives a portion of the last ex-husband’s pension.
12:360:27551:11:0:98:502:93:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:11Unfortunately, the solution employed by Krusell and Smith (1998) does not work for this problem.
13:361:27651:0:21:90:514:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(τ=young) versus “old” (τ=old).12If the potential couple does not marry, a new
13:362:27729:21:20:90:516:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:random match quality is drawn in the following period. If the potential couple does decide
13:363:27819:20:37:90:519:650:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to marry, their love process subsequently evolves according to the followingAR(1) process:
13:364:27909:37:37:205:518:613:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f3:A:qτt+1=ρqqτt+uτtwhereuτt∼N(-τu,σu)(3)
13:365:27945:37:20:106:517:576:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Individuals start life with zero assets.  We assume that the asset level of an agent’s
13:366:28031:20:37:90:434:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:potential partner,a′t, is an increasing function of own level of assets, i.e.,
13:367:28109:37:36:278:518:519:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f3:A:a′t=ag(at)(4)
13:368:28122:36:21:90:517:483:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:This assumption (see, e.g., Mazzocco, Ruiz, and Yamaguchi (2007)), simplifies computations
13:369:28212:21:20:90:515:462:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:while also introducing an additional incentive to save.  Note that we allow the function
13:370:28300:20:20:90:517:442:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to depend on gender in order to respect the fact that the two sexes have different asset
13:371:28388:20:21:90:150:422:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:distributions.
13:372:28402:21:20:106:516:401:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Whether a potential marriage partner has children matters since theyfollow the woman
13:373:28486:20:20:90:517:381:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:into the new marriage, thus affecting consumption.  The existence of anunmarried ex wife
13:374:28574:20:21:90:519:361:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:also matters as her ex husband will continue to provide child support even if he remarries.
13:375:28665:21:20:106:518:340:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Lastly, we assume that only married women have children.  Given the cohort under
13:376:28745:20:36:90:424:320:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consideration, this is in accordance with the vast majority of the data.

13:378:28872:27:20:90:518:257:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:As discussed previously, we do not allow individuals to write contracts that govern their
13:379:28961:20:21:90:518:237:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:future behavior with respect to a future or current spouse or withrespect to an ex spouse.
13:380:29051:21:20:90:518:216:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:That is, women cannot promise to work in a given period and neither spouse can commit
13:381:29136:20:20:90:516:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to a future path of utility, consumption, or saving.  Furthermore, individuals are not able
13:382:29227:20:21:90:517:176:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to save in personal accounts once married nor write prenuptial contracts.  As in the vast
13:383:29316:21:20:90:517:155:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:majority of the literature (e.g., Cubeddu and R ́ıos-Rull (2003)), we assume that marriage
13:384:29406:20:16:90:210:135:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:entails joining all assets.13
13:385:29435:16:11:98:487:119:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:12In the calibration, this corresponds to matches before the age of 35 versus those after that age.
13:386:29534:11:15:98:517:108:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:13Although some protection of the assets brought into a marriage ispossible, its extent is not clear and
13:387:29638:15:0:89:237:93:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:likely small for an average household.
14:388:29678:0:21:106:518:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To specify more precisely the circumstances under which marriageand divorce occurs,
14:389:29761:21:20:90:517:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:we need to be clear about the exact timing of events within a period and introduce some
14:390:29848:20:20:90:521:650:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:additional notation. Agents can be in one of four possible marital statess∈ {My,Mo,S,D},
14:391:29936:20:21:90:516:630:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:which correspond to, respectively, married in a match made while young,y, married in a
14:392:30022:21:20:89:518:609:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:match made while old,o, single (meaning never married) and divorced.  The timing of
14:393:30105:20:20:89:395:589:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:events (in particular fertility) differs according to marital status.
14:394:30174:20:21:106:517:569:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Figure 1 describes the timing during a typical working period fora married woman. At
14:395:30258:21:20:89:518:548:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the beginning of periodtmarried agents receive their love, fertility, and wage shocks.  If
14:396:30348:20:20:89:516:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the husband was previously divorced, they also observe some information regarding his ex
14:397:30436:20:21:89:518:508:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:spouse as will be described in greater detail later. The couple is then faced with a decision:
14:398:30530:21:20:89:516:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to stay married or to divorce.  If they stay married, they then proceed to make saving and
14:399:30620:20:20:89:516:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:work decisions as a married couple. If they divorce, each ex spouse mayindividually obtain
14:400:30710:20:21:89:517:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:an immediate opportunity to rematch. If a rematch opportunity is not received, that agent
14:401:30799:21:20:89:517:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:makes her/his savings and work decisions as a divorced agent for that period. On the other
14:402:30889:20:20:89:516:406:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:hand, if a rematch opportunity is received, then upon observing thecharacteristics of a
14:403:30976:20:21:89:515:386:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:potential spouse, a decision is made as to whether to marry or not. If yes, that agent then
14:404:31067:21:20:89:516:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:makes its consumption, saving, and work decisions as part of a married couple (observing
14:405:31155:20:20:89:518:345:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:as well their ex-spouse’s state variables, if relevant, as will be described in greater detail
14:406:31249:20:21:89:515:325:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:below).  If not, the agent continues life as divorced for that period andmakes saving and
14:407:31338:21:20:89:215:304:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:work decisions accordingly.
14:408:31365:20:20:106:517:284:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The timing for single and divorced agents is slightly different. Single agents observe the
14:409:31455:20:21:90:515:264:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:quality of their match draw and wage shocks and then decide whether tomarry.  Fertility
14:410:31542:21:20:90:516:243:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:shocks are subsequent to the marital status decision.  Lastly, divorced agents observe the
14:411:31632:20:20:90:513:223:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:quality of their match draw, the number and age of the children of theirpotential new
14:412:31717:20:21:90:515:203:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:spouse, all their ex-spouse’s relevant state variables (describedin greater detail below), and
14:413:31811:21:20:90:516:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:then decide their marital status. If they decide to marry, they arealso subject to a fertility
14:414:31905:20:20:90:517:162:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:shock.  All work and savings decisions are made after the fertility shock is realized.  The
14:415:31996:20:21:90:423:142:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:timeline for these agents is given in the Appendix (see figures A1-A3).
14:416:32067:21:20:106:517:121:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The description of agents’ state spaces is complicated by the fact that information is
14:417:32153:20:0:90:517:101:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:revealed at different points within the same period and by the need to keep track of some

15:450:34003:21:20:89:517:198:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:child support payments.  Lastly, a divorced woman needs to form expectations about the
15:451:34089:20:20:89:521:178:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:path of child support she will obtain if she does not remarry.  Hence shecares aboutz′xt,

18:545:37642:28:20:90:516:663:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The rules governing divorce depend on the divorce regime.  In the benchmark model we
18:546:37726:20:20:90:517:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:assume that the divorce regimeris first mutual consent (r=MC) and then switches
18:547:37805:20:21:90:518:623:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:unexpectedly to a unilateral divorce regime (r=U).  TheUregime is straightforward:
18:548:37887:21:20:90:518:602:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:any individual who wishes to divorce can do so.  Upon divorce, the maritalassets are split
18:549:37977:20:20:90:517:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:equally between the ex-spouses.17In theMCregime, on the other hand, divorce requires
18:550:38061:20:21:90:516:562:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:both spouses to agree.  If, subject to an equal split of marital assets, both parties would
18:551:38152:21:20:90:517:541:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:prefer to divorce than remain marry, the couple divorces with that asset split.  If, on the
18:552:38243:20:20:90:518:521:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:other hand, one of the spouses would prefer to stay married at that asset split, then that
18:553:38333:20:21:90:516:501:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:spouse must receive a share of marital assets that leave her/him indifferent between being
18:554:38423:21:20:90:516:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:married or divorced.  Note that a spouse cannot borrow individually in order to pay off
18:555:38510:20:20:90:517:460:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the other spouse so as to obtain a divorce.  Note also that there may not be an asset split
18:556:38601:20:21:90:516:440:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:which makes both agents better off divorced. In that case the agents remainmarried. We
18:557:38687:21:20:90:517:419:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:reiterate that under both regimes the children live with their mother upon divorce and the

23:858:48316:31:20:90:517:338:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In this section we describe the calibration of the model.  Some modelparameter values are
23:859:48405:20:20:90:516:318:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:taken from preexisting estimates while others are estimated directly from the data using
23:860:48493:20:21:90:516:298:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:model restrictions.   A remaining set of parameters are calibrated within the model in
23:861:48579:21:20:90:517:277:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:order to match certain moments in the data.  The reasoning guiding different choices is
23:862:48666:20:20:90:517:257:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:explained below. Table 1 reports the parameters estimated “outside”the model and Table
23:863:48752:20:21:90:518:237:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:3, reports the “internally” calibrated parameters and their targets.  Our key parameters of
23:864:48843:21:20:90:518:216:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:interest are those that affect work decisions for women and marital decisions for both sexes.
23:865:48936:20:20:90:519:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:These parameters include those which govern disutility from labor,child-care costs, several
23:866:49027:20:21:90:476:176:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:parameters which affect wage dynamics and marital status transitions (e.g.love).
23:867:49107:21:20:106:517:155:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To construct labor statistics we mainly use the 1962-2010 waves of the March supplement
23:868:49194:20:17:90:515:135:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the Current Population Survey (CPS), a cross-sectional survey conducted by the Bureau
23:869:49282:17:14:98:516:118:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:22Note that the value functions in periodtRare given by the sum of the instantaneous utility defined
23:870:49382:14:0:90:519:104:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:during a working period with the continuation value associatedwith the retirement maximization problem.
24:871:49487:0:21:90:516:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the Census.  Although this is not a panel, we choose this dataset due toits long time
24:872:49575:21:20:90:516:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:horizon which allows one to observe the full life span of our 1940 cohort.  We construct a
24:873:49665:20:20:90:516:650:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:synthetic 1940 cohort which consists of white women born between 1939-1941.23For the
24:874:49749:20:21:89:516:630:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:relevant statistics for men, our sample consists of white men born between 1942-1944 in
24:875:49836:21:20:89:516:609:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:order to capture the average age difference between husbands and wives(approximately 3
24:876:49922:20:20:89:518:589:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:years for this cohort). Married people are defined as those “married, withspouse present”,
24:877:50012:20:21:89:516:569:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:singles are those people who report “never married” whereas divorced people are those who
24:878:50101:21:20:89:516:548:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:report their marital status to be either “divorced” or “separated”.  Finally, since longevity
24:879:50194:20:20:89:404:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is deterministic in the model, we exclude widows from our sample.
24:880:50259:20:21:106:518:508:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:For the marital status transition statistics, we rely on the marital history module of
24:881:50345:21:20:89:516:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the 2001 and 2004 waves of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP).We
24:882:50428:20:20:89:516:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:construct a cohort of women born between 1938 and 1942; since this is a panel dataset, we
24:883:50517:20:21:89:515:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:can follow the life-cycle marital transitions of these women and compute statistics based
24:884:50606:21:20:89:517:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on those.  All marital statistics are computed using women only - e.g. the divorce rates
24:885:50694:20:20:89:516:406:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:calibrated in the model are those faced by the women in this cohort.  We next proceed to
24:886:50782:20:36:89:420:386:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:explain the choices of functional forms and their calibration in detail.
24:887:50854:36:27:89:265:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:Demographics and Preferences
24:888:50882:27:21:89:516:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The model period is 5 years.  Individuals begin the working stage of life at age 20 (period
24:889:50973:21:20:89:516:302:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f3:B:t= 1) and remain in that stage for 9 periods.  Retirement begins in the model period
24:890:51057:20:20:89:519:282:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f3:B:tR+ 1 = 10 (at age 65) and death occurs at the end of model periodT= 15 (at age 90).
24:891:51141:20:21:90:517:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In the benchmark model we assume that the mutual consent divorce regime is in place for
24:892:51228:21:20:90:518:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the first 3 periods and then switches to a unilateral divorce regimein the 4th period. This
24:893:51319:20:20:90:516:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:corresponds to a regime switch occurring in 1975.  The regime switch isassumed to be
24:894:51403:20:21:90:516:201:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:completely unexpected.  As a robustness check, we also explored the opposite extreme – a
24:895:51491:21:20:90:516:180:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:perfectly anticipated regime change.  Our welfare results did not change substantially as a
24:896:51582:20:20:90:117:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:result.
24:897:51589:20:21:106:516:140:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To parameterize the utility function we setσ= 1.5 since most estimates for the relative

24:899:51766:15:15:98:517:104:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:23We restrict the sample to whites as black women have had a different LFP trajectory with significantly
24:900:51870:15:0:90:189:89:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:higher participation rates
25:901:51898:0:21:90:517:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:with the values found by Attanasio and Weber (1995) using US consumption data. We set
25:902:51983:21:20:90:518:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the discount factorβ= 0.90 (for a five year period) which corresponds to a conventional
25:903:52070:20:20:89:231:650:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:yearly discount factor of 0.98.
25:904:52101:20:21:106:518:630:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The disutility of labor is allowed to vary by marital status and to depend on the age of
25:905:52189:21:20:89:516:609:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the youngest child in the household.  The parameters are calibrated within the model in
25:906:52276:20:20:89:517:589:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:order to match female LFP rates by marital status and children’s age for the1940 cohort.24
25:907:52366:20:21:89:516:569:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:With respect to children, we distinguish between mothers withyoung children (below the
25:908:52452:21:20:89:517:548:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:age of 5), those with older children, and non-mothers and allow these womento incur
25:909:52535:20:20:89:513:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:different disutilities from working.25Lastly, single women’s and all men’s disutility from
25:910:52625:20:37:89:215:508:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:work is normalized to zero.

25:914:52846:21:20:89:517:403:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f3:B:zt, is modeled as an AR(1) process with normally distributed innovations.  This choice is
25:915:52935:20:20:89:517:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:standard in the literature and is consistent with the large increase in the variance of wages

25:921:53416:20:37:89:447:261:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f3:B:γ1,γ2of the second degree polynomial on age with the following regression:

25:923:53516:36:21:95:517:188:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Next, we use the residualswtfrom this regression to estimate the parameters of the
25:924:53598:21:16:89:535:167:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:stochastic process (σǫ,ρz) using the minimum distance estimator first proposed by Chamberlain
25:925:53691:16:15:98:518:151:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:24The distinction between working as a single or divorced woman versus married was particularly relevant
25:926:53795:15:7:90:436:136:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:to the 1940 cohort who grew up thinking of married women primarily ashomemakers.
25:927:53875:7:15:98:518:129:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:25Mothers of young children may be especially reluctant to work.   See, for example, Bernal (2008)
25:928:53973:15:11:89:518:114:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:and Bernal and Keane (2009) for some evidence regarding the effectof a mother’s working on a child’s

26:930:54087:0:21:90:519:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(1984).  This method seeks parameters which minimize the distance between the empirical
26:931:54174:21:20:90:517:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:covariance matrix of income residuals and the one obtained from simulating the income
26:932:54259:20:20:90:518:650:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:process outlined above.   This choice of estimator is standard in the literature and its
26:933:54347:20:21:90:518:630:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:use and identification in this specific income process is described in detail in, for example,
26:934:54441:21:20:90:526:609:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Storesletten, Telmer, and Yaron (2004). Finally, we normalize the male value of gender-specific
26:935:54536:20:20:90:515:589:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:interceptγgto equal one.  The analogous parameter for women,γfis calibrated internally
26:936:54622:20:21:89:521:569:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to match the ratio of female to male wages averaged over the ages of 20-50 for the 1940
26:937:54709:21:20:89:517:548:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cohort which is 0.71. The parameters of the stochastic process and age polynomials are
26:938:54795:20:20:89:518:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:assumed to be the same for both sexes as the fact that women move in and out ofthe labor
26:939:54883:20:21:89:516:508:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:force prevents us from using the same procedure to estimate theseparameters separately
26:940:54969:21:20:89:139:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for women.
26:941:54979:20:20:106:519:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The model abstracts from alimony since the data suggests that both the proportion of
26:942:55063:20:21:90:517:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:divorced people who receive alimony and the monetary amounts are small.26Child support
26:943:55149:21:20:90:518:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is a more common and substantial payment.  We assume that unless his ex-wife remarries,
26:944:55236:20:20:90:516:406:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the man pays child support equivalent to 10% of his current income until the children reach
26:945:55327:20:21:90:517:386:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the age of twenty.27These values are within the range found in the literature (see, for
26:946:55414:21:20:90:418:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:example, Del Boca and Flinn (1995) and Beller and Graham (1988)).
26:947:55479:20:20:106:518:345:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:After retirement, for computational simplicity (as in Guvenen (2007)),individuals receive
26:948:55568:20:21:90:517:325:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a constant pension which is a function of her/his last observed earnings.   The exact
26:949:55653:21:20:90:516:304:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:functional form of the pension system mimics the US Social Security bend points (following
26:950:55743:20:20:90:515:284:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Heathcote, Storesletten, and Violante (2010)) and it is outlined in the appendix.  Married
26:951:55833:20:21:90:518:264:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:couples receive either the sum of the husband’s and wife’s pensions or 1.5 times the husband’s
26:952:55927:21:20:90:515:243:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:pension (whichever one is higher).  A divorced woman receives, in addition to her own
26:953:56012:20:16:90:295:223:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:pension, 10% of her ex-husband’s pension.28
26:954:56055:16:15:98:516:207:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:26For example, Voena (2012) reports using National Longitudinal Survey of Young and Mature Women
26:955:56151:15:11:90:517:192:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:data that only 10% of divorced women report receiving alimony between 1977 and 1999.  Using 1978 CPS
26:956:56251:11:11:90:518:181:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:data, Peters (1986) reports alimony payments which correspond tounder 3% of the average male earnings
26:957:56352:11:7:90:127:170:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:that year.
26:958:56362:7:14:98:517:163:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:27The model abstracts from the risk of non-compliance.  Uncertaintyin these payments would amplify
26:959:56460:14:8:90:209:149:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:the negative effects of divorce.
26:960:56492:8:14:98:517:141:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:28The laws governing an ex-wife’s claim to the man’s pension have evolved over time.   Before 1980
26:961:56590:14:11:90:519:127:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:unvested pensions were not considered part of marital property.  Currently, pensions are divided as part of
26:962:56697:11:11:90:514:116:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:marital property and they are frequently the most valuable portion of the marital real estate (see Oldham
26:963:56802:11:0:90:119:105:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:(2008)).

27:971:57381:21:20:90:518:541:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:computed from the CPS data for married women of the 1940 cohort between the ages of
27:972:57464:20:20:90:256:521:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:20-44 working full-time year round.

28:1015:60933:21:20:90:517:281:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:only once.  This parameter is calibrated internally to amount to 50 percent of (working)
28:1016:61021:20:20:90:515:261:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:married women’s wages, averaged over their lifecycle, consistent with the evidence presented

28:1018:61158:17:14:98:516:224:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:30Since the model does not have marital status transitions beyond the age of 44, we compute the duration

28:1021:61421:8:14:98:518:191:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:31We choose to match the proportion of women (by marital status) who are mothers because LFP behavior
28:1022:61522:14:11:90:519:177:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:is driven more by the presence of a young child at home rather than by the number of children women have.
28:1023:61627:11:11:90:518:166:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:Moreover, given that our childcare costs and additional disutility from labor depend only on the age of the
28:1024:61734:11:11:90:518:155:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:youngest child in the household, we chose to focus on the distinction between mothers and others (this is

28:1026:61907:7:15:98:517:137:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:32This scale is very similar to the OECD scale, but it has the advantage that it was computed based on
28:1027:62009:15:0:90:214:122:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:expenditure data from families.
29:1028:62042:0:28:90:246:691:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:Other External Parameters
29:1029:62067:28:20:90:515:663:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:There is little guidance on the value of Pareto weight on a woman’s welfarein the household
29:1030:62158:20:20:90:515:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:allocation problem.  We set this value,λ, to 0.3 which is close to the values estimated in
29:1031:62248:20:21:89:518:623:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the literature (see, e.g., Knowles (2007) and Voena (2012)).  Recall that the asset level of
29:1032:62340:21:20:89:518:602:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a new match draw in the marriage market for a single or divorced woman depends on her
29:1033:62425:20:20:89:517:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:own assets (see equation (4)). We set it to be 1.125 times her own asset level, where the
29:1034:62514:20:21:89:515:562:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:1.125 is the ratio of the median assets of divorced and single men to the ratio of the median
29:1035:62607:21:20:89:517:541:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:assets of single and divorced women of the 1940 cohort in the 1983 SCF where thiscohort
29:1036:62694:20:20:89:517:521:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of women would have been 43 years old.33Similarly, a non-married man receives matches
29:1037:62779:20:21:89:517:501:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:with women whose assets are11.125times his level.  Finally, the gross interest rate is set
29:1038:62869:21:20:90:517:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:toR= 1.077 which in this five-year-period model corresponds to an annual interest rate
29:1039:62955:20:20:89:519:460:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of 1.5%.  This is the average real return on a 3 month t-bill over the period of 1935-2010.
29:1040:63046:20:21:89:422:440:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The values of all the parameters set externally are reported in table 1.
29:1041:63118:21:20:106:518:419:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To summarize, there are a total of 19 parameters calibrated internally: 6parameters
29:1042:63201:20:20:89:518:399:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:which govern the disutility of labor for married and divorced women, 1 childcare cost
29:1043:63286:20:21:89:539:379:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:parameter, 1 wage-intercept parameter for women, 1 parameter which governs the assortativeness
29:1044:63380:21:20:89:516:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the marriage market, 7 parameters for the initial draw and evolution of the love process, 1
29:1045:63474:20:20:89:515:338:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:parameter for the psychic cost of divorce, and 2 parameters which determine the probability
29:1046:63565:20:21:89:516:318:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of an “immediate” match draw in the same period as divorce.  We match a totalof 19
29:1047:63647:21:20:89:516:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:statistics for our 1940 cohort: 6 average LFP rates for married and divorced women by
29:1048:63732:20:20:89:516:277:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:children’s age, 10 moments related to divorce and first marriage, 1 wage gender gap, the
29:1049:63820:20:21:89:516:257:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:correlation of husband and wife’s earnings, and the childcare costs. Although this mapping
29:1050:63910:21:20:89:516:236:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is only approximate, it may be useful to think of the labor disutility parameters as targeting
29:1051:64004:20:20:89:516:216:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the LFP moments, while the love process parameters are mostly used to target the life-cycle
29:1052:64095:20:21:89:241:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:pattern of divorce and marriage.
29:1053:64127:21:20:106:518:175:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We calibrate the internal parameters by minimizing the distance between implied model
29:1054:64212:20:20:90:517:155:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:moments and their data targets.   The total distance between moments and targets is
29:1055:64295:20:21:90:519:135:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:computed as a weighted average of the squared difference between each moment and target.
29:1056:64383:21:16:90:519:114:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The weights are such that the 10 moments for marriage and divorce receive half of the total
29:1057:64474:16:0:98:286:98:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:33This is as far back as the SCF provides data.
30:1058:64523:0:21:90:516:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:weight and the 9 remaining moments receive the other half of the weight.  Within each
30:1059:64608:21:36:90:287:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:group, the moments are equally weighted.
30:1060:64648:36:27:90:212:634:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:4.1  Solution Method
30:1061:64668:27:21:90:515:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The households face a known finite horizon which allows the dynamic problem to be solved
30:1062:64756:21:20:90:518:586:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:numerically by backwards recursion from the last period of life using value-function iteration.
30:1063:64851:20:20:90:517:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In each period, the households solve for their consumption-savings rule and LFP decisions
30:1064:64940:20:21:90:518:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:taking as given their state variables that period and next period’s value function.  In what
30:1065:65032:21:20:90:515:525:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:follows, we present the solution method for the married household; the one for divorced
30:1066:65119:20:20:90:516:505:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:women is similar while those of singles and divorced men are significantly simplified by the
30:1067:65211:20:21:90:236:485:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:lack of a participation decision.
30:1068:65244:21:20:106:517:464:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In addition to household assets, the model has three other potentiallycontinuous state
30:1069:65330:20:20:89:531:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:variables: the husband’s and wife’s persistent components of earnings,zmtandzf t, respectively,
30:1070:65425:20:21:90:517:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and the match quality levelqτt. As including more than one continuous state variable, while
30:1071:65516:21:20:90:516:403:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:possible, is computationally costly, we choose to discretize thesethree variables, leaving
30:1072:65606:20:20:90:255:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:assets as the only continuous state.
30:1073:65642:20:21:106:523:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The model combines two discrete decisions (whether marriage/divorce occurs and whether
30:1074:65728:21:20:90:516:342:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the woman participates in the market) and a continuous decision (the level of savings). To
30:1075:65818:20:20:90:516:322:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:solve the model, we first solve for the asset levels and participation decision conditional upon
30:1076:65914:20:21:90:518:302:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:each marital status possibility as discussed in further detail below, and then maximize over
30:1077:66006:21:20:90:517:281:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the marital status options.  Nevertheless, even the combination of participation and assets
30:1078:66097:20:20:90:516:261:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:alone may lead to non-concavities in the value function - as explained below, we numerically
30:1079:66189:20:20:90:154:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:check for this.
30:1080:66204:20:21:106:517:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We follow Attanasio, Low, and Sanchez-Marcos (2008) and impose (and check) a unique
30:1081:66287:21:20:90:519:200:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:level of reservation assetsa∗t+1at which, given the values of all other state variables,
30:1082:66375:20:20:90:517:180:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the conditional value functions (working versus not working, given a fixed marital status)
30:1083:66465:20:21:90:517:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:intersect only once.  This is where the woman’s participation decision switches from not
30:1084:66553:21:20:90:517:139:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:working to working. Thus, conditional on all other state variables, for all valuesat+1< a∗t+1
30:1085:66646:20:20:90:517:119:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the woman works and for all valuesat+1> a∗t+1the woman does not work int+ 1.  We
30:1086:66726:20:0:90:518:99:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:numerically check both the concavity of the conditional value functions and the uniqueness
31:1087:66818:0:21:90:518:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the reservation asset level.  The existence of this unique reservation asset level allows us
31:1088:66913:21:20:90:515:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to interpolate across the asset grid fort+ 1 since each level ofat+1is now associated with
31:1089:67003:20:20:90:431:650:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a participation decision att+ 1 and thus with a concave value function.
31:1090:67074:20:21:106:515:630:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:At this point, and conditional on marital status and the woman’s participation decision
31:1091:67161:21:20:90:515:609:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:at timet, we solve for the household’s optimal level of asset accumulation.  The option
31:1092:67248:20:20:90:518:589:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(work vs not work) which implies the highest utility then yields the LFP decision.  After
31:1093:67337:20:21:90:516:569:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:solving for all asset levels and participation decision for all possible states of nature and
31:1094:67430:21:20:90:516:548:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:marital status, the value functions in the married vs. divorce state are compared for each
31:1095:67520:20:43:90:476:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:agent and a marriage or divorce decision is given at each point of the state space.
31:1096:67603:43:32:90:373:485:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:5  Implications of the Calibrated Model
31:1097:67642:32:20:90:530:453:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In this section we discuss the results obtained from the calibrationand examine the implications
31:1098:67738:20:36:90:344:433:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of different divorce regimes for married women’s LFP.
31:1099:67791:36:27:90:338:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:5.1  Model Fit and Calibrated Parameters
31:1100:67831:27:21:90:515:370:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:As can be seen from table 2, the model does a good job matching the data moments used
31:1101:67916:21:20:90:517:349:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the calibration.  It does an excellent job of reproducing the averages values of women’s
31:1102:68007:20:20:90:518:329:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:LFP, by marital status and conditional on having no children, childrenbelow the age of
31:1103:68093:20:21:90:516:309:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:5, and children between the ages of 5-10.  It also matches the conditional marriage and
31:1104:68180:21:20:90:517:288:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:divorce statistics extremely well.  The largest discrepancy is inmatching the divorce rate
31:1105:68270:20:20:90:517:268:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:during the ages of 35-44 and the immediate remarriage rate upon divorce over the ages
31:1106:68355:20:21:90:435:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:20-34, missing them by a bit over 1 and 2 percentage points respectively.
31:1107:68428:21:20:106:515:227:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The model also does well in generating some moments that were not directly targeted
31:1108:68511:20:20:90:516:207:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the calibration.  For example, conditional upon divorcing between the ages of 20-34, the
31:1109:68602:20:21:90:519:187:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:probability of remarrying within 20 years is 79.4% in the data versus 80.4% in the model.
31:1110:68691:21:20:90:516:166:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Furthermore, as can be seen in figure 2, the model also does a fairly goodjob in reproducing
31:1111:68783:20:20:90:516:146:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the general life-cycle profile of married and divorced women’s LFP, not just the targeted
31:1112:68872:20:21:90:226:126:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:averages across the life-cycle.
31:1113:68903:21:0:106:518:105:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Table 3 reports the values of the internally calibrated parameters.  A few comments
32:1114:68988:0:21:90:516:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are worth making.  First, note that the mean of the initialqdraw is higher for “young”
32:1115:69074:21:20:89:516:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:marriages than for “old” ones.  This is driven by the need to match the largeproportion
32:1116:69161:20:20:89:516:650:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of marriages that occur at young ages despite the fact that earnings are lowerand fertility
32:1117:69252:20:21:89:517:630:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is higher, both factors contributing to decrease consumption.  One way of thinking about
32:1118:69340:21:20:89:517:609:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:this is that individuals obtain pleasure from the prospect of having children and that this
32:1119:69431:20:20:89:516:589:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is captured in the higher mean ofqyoung.  Another important parameter governing the
32:1120:69514:20:21:89:515:569:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:evolution of love over time is the mean of the love shocks.  For marriagesformed when
32:1121:69599:21:20:89:517:548:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:young or when old, this parameter is positive and approximately 7 (young)to 8.5 (old)
32:1122:69684:20:20:89:519:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:percent of the initial value of the mean of the initial love draw.  Thisimplies thatqwill
32:1123:69773:20:21:89:462:508:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tend to increase by this percent each period over the duration of the marriage.
32:1124:69852:21:20:106:516:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Second, it is worth noting that, conditional on the age of a woman’s children, the
32:1125:69934:20:20:89:517:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:disutility of working is always higher for married women than for divorced ones.  In order
32:1126:70024:20:21:89:518:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to understand the magnitudes of these parameters, it is useful to state them in terms of
32:1127:70112:21:20:89:516:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:their consumption equivalence using the same consumption level.  To do this we compute
32:1128:70198:20:20:89:516:406:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the proportional decrease in average married consumption that a woman wouldbe willing
32:1129:70283:20:21:89:519:386:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to bear for one period in order to avoid incurring the disutility cost of working one period,
32:1130:70376:21:36:89:220:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:i.e., we find theξsksuch that

33:1146:71377:27:20:90:518:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:How does women’s LFP react to different divorce regimes?34To study these implications,
33:1147:71463:20:21:89:515:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:we generate the paths of women’s LFP under both divorce systems separately.  In both
33:1148:71547:21:20:89:517:525:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cases, the regime remains in force throughout the agents’ entire lifecycle.  Figure 3 depicts
33:1149:71640:20:20:89:517:505:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the life-cycle profile of women’s LFP under the two pure divorce regimes (MCandU) as
33:1150:71724:20:21:90:518:485:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:well as in the benchmark model, for married women and, separately, for divorced women.

33:1152:71894:20:20:89:517:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consent divorce.  The solid line with triangles labeled LFPUis the LFP path under the
33:1153:71979:20:21:89:518:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:unilateral regime. Lastly, the dashed line is the LFP path obtained in the benchmark model
33:1154:72069:21:20:89:236:403:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:with its mix of divorce regimes.
33:1155:72101:20:20:106:519:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Note that the benchmark model’s LFP path coincides with the path undermutual

33:1157:72268:21:20:89:517:342:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by assumption, unexpected. Thereafter, LFP is on average 1.5 percentage points higher per
33:1158:72357:20:20:89:516:322:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:period over the next 6 periods for married women in the benchmark model (now governed
33:1159:72442:20:21:89:518:302:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by the unilateral divorce system).35Thus, the unexpected change in regime from mutual
33:1160:72527:21:20:89:499:281:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consent to unilateral increased married women’s LFP but not by a very large amount.
33:1161:72610:20:20:112:516:261:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We can compare the results above with those obtained by Stevenson (2008) using
33:1162:72688:20:16:89:517:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a variety of specifications.   First, using a simple differences-in-differences strategy that
33:1163:72781:16:15:98:517:225:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:34In an earlier paper (Fern ́andez and Wong (2013)) we examined howa largeexogenousincrease in the
33:1164:72879:15:11:90:516:210:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:probability of divorce affected married woman’s LFP.  We found thatdoubling the divorce rate increased
33:1165:72981:11:11:90:518:199:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:married women’s LFP increased significantly.   The modeling strategy used there had some advantages
33:1166:73080:11:11:90:518:188:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:and some disadvantages.  On the positive side, keeping marital status exogenous allowed us to consider
33:1167:73182:11:11:90:518:177:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:the interplay of several factors that otherwise are computationally very burdensome (e.g., the endogenous
33:1168:73287:11:11:90:518:166:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:accumulation of labor market experience). On the negative side, treating divorce probabilities as exogenous
33:1169:73394:11:11:90:516:155:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:meant that all the causality went in one direction – from greater divorce risk to higher LFP – rather than
33:1170:73500:11:11:90:517:144:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:allowing the two to interact.  The model ofendogenousmarital status in this paper allows us to make
33:1171:73599:11:11:90:517:133:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:greater headway in understanding the relationship between thedual transformation of women’s work and
33:1172:73699:11:7:90:188:122:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:the stability of marriage.
33:1173:73725:7:14:98:517:115:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:35The LFP of divorced women is also higher as a result of the change, but the increase is smaller – on
33:1174:73827:14:0:90:341:101:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:average less than 1 percentage point per period over 6 periods.
34:1175:73892:0:21:90:515:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:compared the change in married women’s LFP from 1970 to 1980 across states that changed
34:1176:73979:21:20:90:516:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:their divorce regime from mutual to unilateral versus those that did not, Stevenson found
34:1177:74068:20:20:90:519:650:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:an increase of about 1.5 percentage points associated with the unilateral regime.  Second,

34:1179:74250:21:20:90:516:609:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:state policies (in addition to state and year fixed effects), she found that unilateral divorce
34:1180:74345:20:20:90:516:589:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is associated with around a 1.4 percentage points increase in the LFP of non-black married
34:1181:74435:20:21:90:516:569:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:women.  We can compare these results with those produced by our modelby calculating

34:1183:74603:20:20:90:346:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:points, which is in the same ballpark as her estimates.
34:1184:74658:20:21:106:519:508:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Turning next to the two pure divorce regimes, as can be seen from figure 3, the model
34:1185:74743:21:20:90:517:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:predicts that LFP, especially of married women, would have been substantially higher under
34:1186:74833:20:20:90:516:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a unilateral divorce regime. In particular, over the ages of 20-29 which iswhen most women
34:1187:74923:20:21:90:517:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are having children, it would have been 8.43 percentage points greateron average. Over the
34:1188:75013:21:20:90:515:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:first 5 periods (ages 20-44), it would have averaged 7 percentage points moreeach period
34:1189:75101:20:20:90:517:406:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:than under mutual consent.  When married women become older, the inequality changes
34:1190:75184:20:21:90:519:386:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sign and they would work a bit less under a unilateral divorce regime than under mutual

34:1192:75281:20:20:111:516:345:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Table 4 reports several key LFP moments.  For ease of comparison, the first column
34:1193:75363:20:21:89:517:325:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:replicates the benchmark results, and the second and third columnscompare the two pure
34:1194:75449:21:20:89:518:304:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:divorce regimes. Note that the overall ratio of female to male wages is lower under unilateral
34:1195:75543:20:20:89:517:284:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:than under mutual consent as a greater proportion of lower-productivity women enter the
34:1196:75630:20:21:89:206:264:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:labor force in the former.
34:1197:75656:21:20:106:516:243:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:What mechanism drives the large difference in married women’s LFP over the two
34:1198:75734:20:20:89:517:223:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:regimes?  It may be easiest to start by ruling out certain explanations.  First, note that
34:1199:75824:20:21:89:516:203:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:there are no returns to experience in this model – wages are assumedto automatically
34:1200:75908:21:20:89:518:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:increase with age.  Hence, the desire to accumulate more labor market experience cannot
34:1201:75995:20:16:89:517:162:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:be playing a role.37Second, it is also worth noting that the increase cannot be the result
34:1202:76085:16:15:98:517:146:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:36It would be interesting to examine whether this result holds in the data.  It is not an easy exercise to
34:1203:76191:15:11:90:517:131:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:conduct, however, as it would require contrasting the LFP of married women who always expected to live
34:1204:76293:11:11:90:516:120:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:under each of the two divorce regimes.  One possibility could beto examine the LFP for married women
34:1205:76393:11:7:90:461:109:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:20-30 years old under each regime (i.e., differentiating across states), sample size permitting.
34:1206:76489:7:0:98:519:102:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:37In our earlier paper (Fern ́andez and Wong (2013)), we found thatthe endogenous accumulation of
35:1207:76588:0:21:90:515:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of a strategic calculation in which women work more in order to decrease the probability
35:1208:76676:21:20:90:516:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that their husbands will want to divorce them.  Nor can it be the outcome ofa “contract”
35:1209:76764:20:20:90:516:650:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in which wives agree to increase family income and husbands agree to a lower probability
35:1210:76852:20:21:90:517:630:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of divorce.  The timing of decisions within a period effectively rules out these possibilities
35:1211:76946:21:20:90:515:609:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:as first individuals make marital status decisions and only subsequently does the household
35:1212:77037:20:20:90:517:589:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:make work and savings decisions.38Thus married women’s LFP must be optimal (in the
35:1213:77119:20:21:89:519:569:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sense of maximizing the weighted sum of spouses’ utilities)taking as giventhe marital
35:1214:77204:21:20:89:161:548:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:status outcome.
35:1215:77219:20:20:106:517:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Why then do married women work more under a unilateral divorce regime?To answer
35:1216:77298:20:21:89:516:508:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:this we need to understand how an (endogenously) higher divorce riskaffects married
35:1217:77381:21:20:89:519:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:agents’ preferences over their other endogenous outcomes: work, consumption, and savings.
35:1218:77470:20:20:89:518:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Consider a married household in which the wife did not work.  Divorce has two important
35:1219:77557:20:21:89:516:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:effects: it changes the size of each spouse’s household and it divides marital assets (assume
35:1220:77650:21:20:89:516:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:50-50).  From a man’s perspective, the first effect is large as he goes from supporting a
35:1221:77739:20:20:89:516:406:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:family of, say, 4 to supporting only himself (and transferring 10 percent of his income to
35:1222:77829:20:21:89:516:386:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:his ex-spouse).  From the woman’s perspective, she goes from a familyof 4 to a family
35:1223:77914:21:20:89:517:365:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:of 3 and must now support it on labor income that is 30 percent smaller on average.39
35:1224:77999:20:20:89:519:345:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Thus, consumption smoothing implies that in face of higher divorce risk, married men will
35:1225:78088:20:21:89:516:325:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:want to borrow more (or save less) than their wives.   The solution to these conflicting
35:1226:78176:21:20:89:517:304:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:preferences is governed by the relative Pareto weight on spouses’ preferences (which favors
35:1227:78267:20:20:89:515:284:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:men). However, rather than savings bearing the entire required adjustment, another option
35:1228:78356:20:21:89:515:264:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is for the married woman to enter the labor force.  Doing so increases men’s welfare (and
35:1229:78445:21:20:89:516:243:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:decreases women’s) but, by allowing savings to fall less, it can be asuperior solution to the
35:1230:78538:20:20:89:242:223:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:household optimization problem.
35:1231:78569:20:20:106:516:203:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To illustrate the reasoning above, table 6 reports the average assets held by married
35:1232:78654:20:11:90:517:183:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:experience was not a significant contributor to the increase in married women’s LFP when confronted with
35:1233:78758:11:7:90:210:172:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:a doubling of the divorce rate.
35:1234:78789:7:15:98:516:165:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:38This timing is the one required by our assumption of the inability to commit to actionscontingentupon
35:1235:78892:15:11:90:518:150:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:a certain marital status.  In the future it may be interesting to explore the consequences of alternative
35:1236:78997:11:11:90:516:139:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:timing assumptions in which individuals can make labor force participation decisions simultaneously with
35:1237:79101:11:11:90:519:128:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:marital status decisions, i.e., essentially they can committo working in that period. In this paper, however,
35:1238:79210:11:7:90:365:117:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:we are interested in exploring fully the non-commitment assumption.
35:1239:79277:7:15:98:519:110:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:39The average consumption of a divorced woman in the model ranges from 57 percent to 66 percent of
35:1240:79375:15:0:90:292:95:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:the divorce man’s consumption, depending on age.
36:1241:79425:0:21:90:517:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:couples and the average LFP of married women in each period under the mutual consent
36:1242:79509:21:20:90:517:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:versus the unilateral divorce regimes.  Columns 3 and 6 present the difference in the levels
36:1243:79601:20:20:90:516:650:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of these variables between the two divorce systems. As can be seen inthe table, relative to
36:1244:79692:20:21:90:516:630:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a mutual consent regime, savings are lower (borrowing increases) andLFP is significantly
36:1245:79780:21:20:90:517:609:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:higher over the first four periods of life under a unilateral regime.Thereafter saving starts
36:1246:79873:20:20:90:416:589:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to increase as retirement incentives kick in and women’s LFP drops.
36:1247:79940:20:21:106:515:569:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Of course, the composition of married agents differs across divorce regime.   Could
36:1248:80023:21:20:89:517:548:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:selection be responsible for most of the increase in married women’s LFP obtained under
36:1249:80110:20:20:89:516:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the unilateral divorce regime?   To check this possibility, for each period we divide the
36:1250:80199:20:21:89:518:508:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:population of married women into quintiles ofztusing the distribution of couples that
36:1251:80284:21:20:89:516:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:period under mutual consent.  We do the same for married men.  This yields a 5x5 matrix
36:1252:80371:20:20:89:517:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of married couples. For each cell we can calculate women’s LFP under the mutual consent
36:1253:80458:20:21:89:518:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:regime vs the unilateral divorce regime.  Using the same weights per cell as under mutual
36:1254:80547:21:20:89:516:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consent (at timet) allows us to eliminate the effect of differential selection into marriage
36:1255:80639:20:20:90:282:406:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on married women’s LFP in that period.
36:1256:80677:20:21:106:517:386:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We find that selection plays a role in the increase in married women’sLFP but that it
36:1257:80762:21:20:90:515:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is significantly less important than the increased motivation to work faced by all married
36:1258:80852:20:20:90:519:345:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:women.40For example, had the distribution of couples remained the same as in mutual
36:1259:80935:20:21:89:516:325:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consent, then married women’s LFP would have increased from 35.80 percent to 43.83
36:1260:81017:21:20:89:512:304:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:percent rather than to 45.22 percent in period 1.  In period 2 it would have increased from
36:1261:81108:20:20:89:516:284:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:39.25 to 45.58 rather than to 46.68.  Thus, in the first two periods selection into marriage
36:1262:81200:20:21:89:514:264:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is responsible for 15.8 percent and 14.8 percent, respectively, of the total increase in LFP
36:1263:81292:21:16:89:272:243:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:induced by a unilateral divorce regime.
36:1264:81331:16:14:98:517:227:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:40We also checked, using the same methodology, whether the results regarding savings was driven by
36:1265:81429:14:11:90:516:213:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:differential selection into marriage.  They are not.  For example, had the distribution of couples remained
36:1266:81536:11:11:90:517:202:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:the same as in mutual consent, then average assets would have decreased from -5.46 to -6.42 rather than to
36:1267:81642:11:11:90:516:191:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:-6.75 in period 1.  In period 2 it would have decreased from -6.55 to-7.72 rather than to -8.06.  Thus, in
36:1268:81748:11:11:90:519:180:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:the first two periods selection into marriage is responsible for 25.0 percent and 22.4 percent, respectively, of
36:1269:81860:11:0:90:390:169:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:the total decrease in married assets induced by a unilateral divorce regime.
37:1270:81938:0:32:90:369:691:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:6  Welfare Analysis of Divorce Regimes
37:1271:81976:32:20:90:517:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Prior to the welfare analysis it is useful to summarize the consequences of each regime for
37:1272:82067:20:20:90:517:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:several key marital status moments and to understand how each affects agents’ preferences
37:1273:82156:20:36:90:173:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:towards marriage.
37:1274:82173:36:28:90:454:583:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:6.1  The Impact of Divorce Regimes on Marriage and Divorce
37:1275:82231:28:20:90:516:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We start by examining how divorce regimes affect the basic marital moments.   These
37:1276:82314:20:20:90:517:535:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are reported in table 7.  For ease of comparison, the first column replicatesthe numbers
37:1277:82402:20:21:90:518:515:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:from the benchmark model.  As can be seen in the table, relative to a regime of mutual
37:1278:82488:21:20:90:517:494:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consent, unilateral divorce slightly more than doubles the divorce rate while younger (ages
37:1279:82579:20:20:90:517:474:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:20-34) and generates an increase of over 30% in the proportion of marriages that divorce
37:1280:82667:20:21:90:516:454:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:when older (ages 35-44).  Women are significantly less likely to marry whileyounger with
37:1281:82755:21:20:90:516:433:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the marriage rate decreasing over 14 percentage points, a 16% decrease.  They are also
37:1282:82841:20:20:90:516:413:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:somewhat more likely to marry when older: 4.4% versus 4.0%.  The proportionof women
37:1283:82924:20:21:90:517:393:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:who remarry within five years (conditional on having divorced when younger) remains
37:1284:83007:21:20:90:517:372:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:fairly constant across regimes. The average (truncated) time spent divorced when younger
37:1285:83095:20:20:90:517:352:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:increases somewhat.  The marriage gap between higher and lower income mennarrows
37:1286:83175:20:21:90:519:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and the divorce gap widens (becoming more negative under unilateral thanunder mutual
37:1287:83259:21:20:90:130:311:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consent).
37:1288:83268:20:20:106:518:291:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We next turn to an analysis of the mechanisms that produce these results and their
37:1289:83350:20:21:89:517:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ultimate welfare implications.  How does the freedom to walk away fromone’s spouse
37:1290:83432:21:20:89:517:250:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:affect welfare? For any individual and a given pattern of marriages, evaluating the welfare
37:1291:83523:20:20:89:515:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consequences of a unilateral versus a mutual consent regime requires weighing the expected
37:1292:83613:20:21:89:518:210:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:benefit of those states of nature in which she/he wishes to be free to walk away from her/his
37:1293:83706:21:20:89:516:189:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:spouse without compensating the latter, against the expected cost of the reverse – being
37:1294:83794:20:20:89:350:169:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the one walked out on without receiving compensation.
37:1295:83847:20:21:106:516:149:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:It is clear why,for a given pattern of marriages, the winners from a unilateral regime
37:1296:83933:21:20:89:516:128:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:relative to mutual consent should be men on average.   Divorce is less costly for men
37:1297:84018:20:0:89:517:108:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:since they earn substantially more than women on average and also bear a smaller share
38:1298:84106:0:21:90:517:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the cost of raising children upon divorce.  The benefits of marriage tend to be smaller
38:1299:84196:21:20:90:521:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for men as well.  Although both spouses gain equally from the quality of the match,q,
38:1300:84281:20:20:89:517:650:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:other costs and benefits are not equal.  On the positive side, both spouses obtain some
38:1301:84368:20:21:89:517:630:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:insurance from marriage: a man’s wife is more likely to work if he is hitby a negative
38:1302:84454:21:20:89:518:609:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:income shock. Moreover, marriage provides a woman with an additional (or sole) source of
38:1303:84542:20:20:89:516:589:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:income that is on average substantially higher than hers.  On the negativeside, marriage
38:1304:84630:20:21:89:518:569:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tends to substantially decrease a man’s consumption, especially ifhis wife doesn’t work.
38:1305:84718:21:20:89:517:548:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:It may also decrease a woman’s consumption, depending on family size,but this effect
38:1306:84802:20:20:89:518:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is smaller than in the case of the man, given relative wages.  Lastly, marriageincreases
38:1307:84890:20:21:89:518:508:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a woman’s disutility from working (normalized at zero when single), especially if she has
38:1308:84979:21:20:89:516:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:children.  Thus, while marriage is not a bad deal for either men or women -after all, they
38:1309:85069:20:20:89:517:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are choosing to get married – upon receiving a negative match quality shock, it is more
38:1310:85156:20:36:89:511:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:likely that the husband will be the one to benefit from the ability toexit at a lower cost.
38:1311:85247:36:27:89:354:411:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f8:C:The median agent and marital status preferences
38:1312:85294:27:21:89:517:384:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:To better illustrate the points made above (and no longer keeping constant marriage
38:1313:85377:21:20:89:517:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:patterns across divorce regimes), we can trace out the evolution of two cutoff levels: the
38:1314:85467:20:20:89:517:343:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:minimumqrequired in order to desire to marry assuming that in each period the agent is
38:1315:85553:20:21:89:516:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:single (and has been in the past), and the minimumqrequired to desire to stay married
38:1316:85638:21:20:89:517:302:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(i.e., to not want a divorce) assuming the agent is married (and has beenin the past).  We
38:1317:85728:20:20:89:435:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:denote these minimums byqMg,minand byqDg,min, respectively,g∈ {f,m}.
38:1318:85796:20:21:106:516:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We perform theqsg,mincalculations for an agent endowed with the medianz0and with
38:1319:85876:21:20:89:517:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a marital typeez′0,whereez′0equals the expected value of the match the median agent
38:1320:85959:20:20:89:517:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:would obtain, i.e,ez′0=E(z′0|z0).  We assume that a single agent faces in each period the
38:1321:86048:20:21:89:516:201:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:distribution of future draws associated with ΩSt−1(e.g., the innovations inztandz′t, etc) and
38:1322:86141:21:20:89:515:180:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ex-post resolve the uncertainty in each period by setting the innovations to their expected
38:1323:86232:20:20:89:515:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:values.  This implies that in the following period the single agent is again endowed with
38:1324:86321:20:21:89:512:140:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the medianzt(recall thatE(ǫy) = 0) and her/his marital type’s productivity isE(z′t|ez′0).
38:1325:86410:21:20:106:520:119:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Similarly, we assume that a married agent faces the future distribution of draws associated
38:1326:86501:20:0:90:515:99:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:with ΩMt−1and ex post resolve the uncertainty by setting all innovations to their expected
39:1327:86593:0:21:90:517:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:values.  Thus the following period the married agent has the medianztand the spouse has
39:1328:86680:21:20:90:515:670:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f3:B:E(z′t|ez′0).  Since ex-post fertility must be an integer, we set the realization to one child in
39:1329:86776:20:20:90:517:650:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the first period and to an additional child in the second period. We also assume that this is
39:1330:86869:20:21:90:517:630:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the married agents’ first marriage.  For both single and married agents, assets evolve over
39:1331:86960:21:20:90:516:609:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:time as prescribed by the solutions to the optimization problems (as described in section
39:1332:87049:20:20:90:108:589:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:3.2).
39:1333:87054:20:21:106:517:569:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Table 8 presents the evolution ofqsg,minover time.  The entries on the left side of the
39:1334:87141:21:20:90:517:548:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:table report the values ofqMg,min(for single agents) andqDg,min(for married agents) under the
39:1335:87234:20:20:90:517:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:mutual consent regime; those on the right correspond to the unilateral regime.  The lower
39:1336:87323:20:21:90:517:508:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:panel translates the cutoff values into potential “acceptance” rates – the proportion of the
39:1337:87415:21:20:90:517:487:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f3:B:qdistribution that is not rejected or that does not end in divorce. For asingle agent this is
39:1338:87508:20:20:90:518:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:equivalent to the proportion of the matches that she/he would want to become marriages.
39:1339:87595:20:21:90:516:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:For a married agent, the proportion of acceptances is not conditioned on the fact that being
39:1340:87687:21:20:90:517:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:married in periodt−1 implies thatqt−1must have fallen in a certain range.  Hence, the
39:1341:87772:20:20:90:517:406:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:“acceptance” rate reported is not the complement of the divorce rate – itsimply provides
39:1342:87860:20:21:90:517:386:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:an indication of how the preferences of agents evolve over time and by gender.  Lastly, to
39:1343:87950:21:20:90:515:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:facilitate comparisons, we calculateqDg,minunder the assumption that divorce in that period
39:1344:88041:20:20:90:516:345:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:would split marital assets equally. This assumption allows us to illustrate the difference in
39:1345:88134:20:21:90:519:325:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:women’s and men’s valuation of marriage prior to any compensation required under mutual
39:1346:88221:21:20:90:132:304:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:consent.41
39:1347:88231:20:20:106:515:284:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Some interesting patterns that are common to both divorce regimes can bediscerned
39:1348:88312:20:21:90:517:264:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:from table 8. First, single women and men both become less choosy about marital partners
39:1349:88400:21:20:90:519:243:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:as time progresses. Two factors are mainly responsible for this: the possibility that they will
39:1350:88495:20:20:90:516:223:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:have more than one child falls (which lowers the consumption cost of marriage as well as the
39:1351:88587:20:21:90:519:203:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:number of periods with high disutility of work) and (potential) earnings increase.  Second,
39:1352:88678:21:20:90:517:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:note that initially single women are choosier than single men; this pattern reverses at age
39:1353:88769:20:20:90:517:162:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:30-34.  At that point single women become less concerned about the negative economic
39:1354:88853:20:16:90:516:142:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consequences of children within marriage and also less concerned aboutexiting a marriage
39:1355:88941:16:15:98:519:126:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:41If mutual consent were required, there would be only oneqDminfor the couple as they must both agree.
39:1356:89043:15:11:90:519:111:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:Note that the assumption of an equal split is only made for the current period; agents under a mutual
39:1357:89144:11:0:90:371:100:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:consent regime assume that in future periods consent will be required.
40:1358:89216:0:21:90:277:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:under negative economic circumstances.
40:1359:89254:21:20:106:517:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:One may ask why single women living under a mutual consent regime should care about
40:1360:89337:20:20:89:518:650:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the possibility that once they marry they may eventually divorce.   After all, they will
40:1361:89425:20:21:89:517:630:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:be compensated in that event.  There are two reasons.  First, compensation only leaves
40:1362:89511:21:20:89:517:609:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:women indifferent between marriage and divorce.  When staying in a marriage becomes
40:1363:89594:20:20:89:518:589:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:unattractive (either because the man’s wages are low or because the match quality is low),
40:1364:89684:20:21:89:516:569:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the amount of compensation a woman receives is also likely low.  Second, even when being
40:1365:89772:21:20:89:517:548:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:married is unattractive to both parties, a husband may not be able to afford to make his
40:1366:89860:20:20:89:517:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:wife indifferent between divorce and marriage, and thus the couple remains married. While
40:1367:89949:20:21:89:515:508:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:this makes a woman better off than being divorced, it is still not a statethat she would
40:1368:90037:21:20:89:401:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:prefer relative to remaining single and waiting for a better match.
40:1369:90104:20:20:106:518:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:It is worth remarking that the model is able to capture several well-known features of
40:1370:90190:20:21:89:515:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:mate preferences.  Basic evolutionary theory predicts that females should be choosier than
40:1371:90280:21:20:89:519:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:males since the former invest more in their young.  This result is generated in the model
40:1372:90369:20:20:89:517:406:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:as a result of children being more costly to a woman.  The finding that the inequality is
40:1373:90458:20:21:89:517:386:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:reversed over time, with single men becoming choosier than singlewomen, seems at least
40:1374:90544:21:20:89:166:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:anecdotally true.
40:1375:90561:20:20:106:517:345:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Next, note that married men are more willing to divorce than married women.  This
40:1376:90642:20:21:89:517:325:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is due to the various gender asymmetries previous discussed: men earn more on average
40:1377:90727:21:20:89:517:304:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and bear a smaller share of the cost of raising children.  Interestingly, the pattern over
40:1378:90817:20:20:89:517:284:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:time ofqDg,mindiffers by gender.  It is monotonically decreasing for men, indicatingthat as
40:1379:90908:20:21:90:516:264:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:they age they become less inclined to divorce.  For women, on the other hand, theqDf,min
40:1380:90996:21:20:90:517:243:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:follows an inverted U shape.  Married women’s willingness to divorcepeaks during ages
40:1381:91081:20:20:90:516:223:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:30-34 and then decreases.  There are many things happening simultaneously that change
40:1382:91166:20:21:90:516:203:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the attractiveness of marriage relative to divorce over time for women but it seems that the
40:1383:91258:21:20:90:517:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:relative attractiveness of marriage increases with the growth in the husband’s labor income
40:1384:91349:20:20:90:173:162:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:over the life cycle.
40:1385:91369:20:21:106:517:142:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Comparing next across regimes, note from table 8 that, indeed, the minimumqsingle
40:1386:91450:21:20:90:517:121:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:women require in order to marry is higher under the unilateral divorce regime than under
40:1387:91538:20:0:90:518:101:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:mutual consent, indicating their greater reluctance to be married in a unilateral system.
41:1388:91629:0:21:90:516:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:This is because marriage without compensation for divorce is less attractive to women since
41:1389:91720:21:20:90:516:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:they will more often find themselves being walked out on rather than being the ones who
41:1390:91807:20:20:90:517:650:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:walk away.42The minimumqrequired for a woman to remain married is also higher under
41:1391:91890:20:21:90:515:630:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the unilateral system since the lower value of marriage makes it less attractive to stay in
41:1392:91981:21:20:90:519:609:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a low quality marriage.  For single men, on the other hand,qMm,minfalls relative to mutual
41:1393:92071:20:20:89:517:589:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consent indicating the greater attractiveness of marriage for them now that the exit cost
41:1394:92160:20:21:89:517:569:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is lower.  For married men,qDm,minalso falls since the value of marriage has increased for
41:1395:92250:21:20:89:518:548:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:them. To understand why men are more eager to be divorced under mutualconsent, recall
41:1396:92335:20:20:89:516:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that the calculation we performed to obtainqDm,minallowed agents, only in that period, to
41:1397:92424:20:21:89:516:508:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:exit the marriage without compensating their spouse.43This caused some men to “jump”
41:1398:92508:21:20:89:519:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:at the opportunity of a relatively inexpensive divorce that period.Under the unilateral
41:1399:92595:20:20:89:515:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:regime, the opportunity to divorce without compensating one’s spousealways exists and
41:1400:92680:20:21:89:517:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:hence men are less eager to exit marriage and are consequently less demanding vis a vis
41:1401:92767:21:20:89:167:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:marriage quality.
41:1402:92784:20:20:106:517:406:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Overall, it is clear that the preferences of men and women vis a vis marriage move
41:1403:92866:20:21:89:517:386:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in opposite directions across regimes.  The net decrease in the marriagerate under the
41:1404:92952:21:20:89:517:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:unilateral regime allows one to conclude that women’s greater reluctance to marry prevails
41:1405:93042:20:20:89:516:345:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:over men’s greater willingness to marry.   Note that although marriage rates fall and
41:1406:93127:20:21:89:518:325:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:those that marriages that form have, on average, a higher value of the initiallove draw,
41:1407:93215:21:36:89:395:304:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:nevertheless a greater proportion of marriages end up in divorce.
41:1408:93280:36:27:89:391:268:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:6.2  The Welfare Consequences of Divorce Regimes
41:1409:93328:27:20:89:516:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:To study the overall welfare consequences of the two divorce regimes we perform two
41:1410:93411:20:21:89:518:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:calculations.  The first asks, conditional solely on gender, but otherwise under the “veil of
41:1411:93504:21:16:89:516:200:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ignorance”, whether women and men prefer one regime to the other. The second calculation
41:1412:93592:16:15:98:516:184:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:42The model predicts that under a unilateral divorce regime, men will be the ones who wish to divorce in
41:1413:93696:15:10:89:518:169:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:78 percent of the cases.  This figure is for the entire universe of agents between the ages of 25 to 44.  As
41:1414:93804:10:11:89:518:159:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:has been noted in the literature, these numbers are not comparablewith figures about who legally initiates
41:1415:93910:11:8:89:389:148:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:divorce as there exist other social considerations that influence this choice.
41:1416:93988:8:14:98:514:140:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:43This was for illustrative purposes only – i.e., to indicate howmuch men value marriage. If we forced them
41:1417:94095:14:11:89:517:126:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:to compensate their wives, as required under MC, then there would be no gender differences and, in some
41:1418:94198:11:11:89:516:115:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:casesqMm,minwould not be defined since marital assets would be insufficiently large to allow compensation
41:1419:94303:11:0:89:122:104:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:to occur.

42:1424:94596:27:20:89:517:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Table 9 shows the results of both welfare calculations.  The first column (“All Quintiles”)

42:1426:94780:21:20:90:519:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:be easily seen, women prefer the mutual consent regime whereas men prefer the unilateral
42:1427:94868:20:20:90:516:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:divorce regime.  The third and sixth row provide a measure of the extent to which one
42:1428:94953:20:21:90:515:506:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:system is preferred to the other by reporting the percentageρby which the consumption

42:1444:95775:20:20:106:515:199:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Note that, perhaps surprisingly, men’s preference for the unilateral regime is not very

42:1447:96037:20:20:89:516:138:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consent regime.  They would be willing to have their consumption decreased up to 15.76

43:1452:96488:20:20:90:517:650:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:women’s work disutility. The consumption decrease required to make women indifferent

43:1455:96642:27:21:90:516:567:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:An interesting political economy question is whether a simple changesuch as a more
43:1456:96724:21:20:90:518:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:generous child support would persuade women, in an ex-ante sense, to favor a unilateral
43:1457:96811:20:20:90:516:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:system.  To answer this question we solve for the fraction of income thatmen would have
43:1458:96898:20:21:90:516:506:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to transfer to women in the form of child support so as to leave them indifferent between
43:1459:96987:21:20:90:518:485:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the two divorce systems.  This more generous transfer is received only in the unilateral
43:1460:97075:20:20:90:515:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:system; the mutual consent transfer remains constant at 10 percent as in the benchmark
43:1461:97161:20:21:90:517:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:model. We allow all decisions to change endogenously in response to thenew child-support
43:1462:97249:21:20:90:155:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:transfer value.
43:1463:97264:20:20:106:517:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We find that the childcare transfer would have to increase to 24.49 percent to leave
43:1464:97348:20:21:89:515:384:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:women indifferent between the two divorce regimes.  This change, however, leaves men
43:1465:97432:21:20:89:519:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:worse off under unilateral divorce than under the mutual consent regimewith the original
43:1466:97520:20:20:89:513:343:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:child support.  Thus, while such a change would garner women’s support, it would now
43:1467:97604:20:36:89:346:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:leave men favoring the mutual consent divorce regime.

43:1469:97690:27:21:89:516:260:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Next, we examine how preferences within gender depend on expected income by conditioning
43:1470:97778:21:20:89:517:239:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on the quintile of the initialzdraw (z0) in addition to gender.  Thus, ex ante, an agent
43:1471:97866:20:20:90:516:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:knows both gender and the quintile of her/hisz0.  Columns 2-6 report, by quintile, the ex

43:1474:98129:20:20:90:516:158:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:As before, in rows 3 and 6 we solve for the percentρby which consumption would need to
43:1475:98215:20:0:90:516:138:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:be increased under the mutual consent regime so as to leave the agent indifferent between
44:1476:98306:0:37:90:352:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the 2 divorce regimes.  That is, we solve forρsuch that

44:1483:98425:30:21:106:518:567:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:As is clear from Table 9, men born with initial productivity in the lowest two quintiles
44:1484:98513:21:20:89:517:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:prefer, on average, the mutual consent regime as do women with initial productivity in the
44:1485:98603:20:20:89:516:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:lowest three quintiles.  Higher productivity men and women prefer the unilateral divorce
44:1486:98691:20:21:89:517:506:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:system.  What explains these preference differences?  Overall, they stem from how the
44:1487:98776:21:20:89:516:485:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:valuation of the ability to exit a marriage easily vis a vis the consumption insurance offered
44:1488:98870:20:20:89:517:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by a stable marriage differs with expected income.   Higher initial productivity agents
44:1489:98957:20:21:89:516:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:expect to earn more and thus they benefit less from the insurance provided by marriage
44:1490:99043:21:20:89:517:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:relative to the ability to easily leave a low quality marriage.  They are also more likely to
44:1491:99136:20:20:89:519:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:need to make greater compensations in order to divorce a spouse under mutual consent.
44:1492:99221:20:21:89:516:384:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Lower-income individuals value more the insurance benefits of marriageand are more likely
44:1493:99310:21:20:89:517:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to profit from compensation under mutual consent.  Reinforcing these motives is the fact
44:1494:99398:20:20:89:513:343:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that lower-income women are the agents that are worst hit by divorce.  This leads them
44:1495:99484:20:21:89:517:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to reject marriage more frequently, thus decreasing marriage formationand its insurance
44:1496:99571:21:20:89:517:302:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:benefits disproportionately for both lower-income men and women. It isinteresting to note
44:1497:99660:20:20:89:516:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that over the last few decades, this is precisely what has happened:white women with
44:1498:99744:20:21:89:516:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:college education marry with greater frequency than before whereas their lower-education
44:1499:99832:21:20:89:516:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:counterparts have seen a decrease in their probability of marrying (see, e.g., Stevenson and
44:1500:99924:20:43:89:146:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Isen (2010)).
44:1501:99937:43:31:89:181:178:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:7  Conclusion
44:1502:99950:31:21:89:517:147:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:This paper developed a quantitative dynamic life-cycle model of endogenous marital status
44:1503:100039:21:20:89:517:126:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to study the positive and normative consequences of two divorce regimes: mutual consent
44:1504:100126:20:0:89:519:106:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and unilateral divorce.  Our analysis is conducted in an environment of imperfect capital
45:1505:100217:0:21:90:516:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and insurance markets, and with very limited commitment ability other than that provided
45:1506:100305:21:20:90:518:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by the legal system.  In this framework, marriage not only provides agentswith love, but
45:1507:100393:20:20:90:519:650:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:also with a degree of insurance against adverse income shocks. It simultaneously, however,
45:1508:100483:20:21:90:405:630:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:exposes them to other sources of uncertainty (e.g., match quality).
45:1509:100550:21:20:106:516:609:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We calibrated the model to key moments for the 1940 cohort which lived through both
45:1510:100633:20:20:89:517:589:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:divorce regimes.  Conditioning solely on gender, our ex ante welfare analysis found that
45:1511:100721:20:21:89:519:569:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:women would fare better under mutual consent whereas men would prefer a unilateral
45:1512:100803:21:20:89:515:548:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:system.  Once we condition on initial productivity by quintile as well as gender, we find
45:1513:100892:20:20:89:517:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that men in the top three quintiles of the initial productivity distribution would be made
45:1514:100982:20:21:89:515:508:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:better off by a unilateral system as would the top two quintiles of women; the rest would
45:1515:101071:21:20:89:515:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:prefer mutual consent. These results can be explained by two gender asymmetries: women
45:1516:101157:20:20:89:518:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tend to earn less then men (the gender wage gap) and the costs of raising children fall
45:1517:101244:20:21:89:310:447:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:primarily upon the mother in case of divorce.45
45:1518:101291:21:20:106:516:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We also examined the link between the change in divorce regime and theLFP of married
45:1519:101375:20:20:89:519:406:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:women.  We found that although the 1940 cohort’s LFP increased by a relativelysmall
45:1520:101458:20:21:89:516:386:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:amount when confronted with a switch to a unilateral divorce regime, the differences in
45:1521:101545:21:20:89:517:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:married LFP across the two regimes would be substantially higher if one compared cohorts
45:1522:101633:20:20:89:517:345:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that always lived in one versus the other regime.  The higher married women’s LFP under
45:1523:101720:20:21:89:516:325:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a unilateral divorce regime is mostly a response to spouses’ conflicting preferences regarding
45:1524:101814:21:20:89:431:304:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consumption smoothing in the face of endogenously higher divorce risk.
45:1525:101884:20:20:106:515:284:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We explored the robustness of our main results to various features of the calibration
45:1526:101969:20:21:89:517:264:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:procedure.  We experimented with slightly higher and lower Pareto weights for the wife

45:1528:102145:20:20:89:517:223:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:childcare costs (40 to 60 percent of average working women’s wages), a different baseline

45:1530:102325:21:20:89:311:182:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:welfare results remained qualitatively similar.46
