2:29:1392:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:This paper analyzes the early history of corporate shareholding, and its relationship with political change.
2:30:1500:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:F: In the late eighteenth century, corporations were extremely rare and were dominated by elites, but
2:31:1599:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:in the early nineteenth century, after American politics became significantly more democratic, corporations
2:32:1706:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:proliferated rapidly. Using newly collected data, this paper compares the wealth and status of New
2:33:1804:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:York City households who owned corporate stock to the general population there both in 1791, when
2:34:1901:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:there were only two corporations in the state, and in 1826, when there were hundreds.  The results
2:35:1999:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:indicate that although corporate stock was held principally by the city’s elite merchants in both periods,
2:36:2105:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:share ownership became more widespread over time among less affluent households.  In particular,
2:37:2201:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:F:the corporations created in the 1820s were owned and managed by investors who were less wealthy
2:38:2296:14:42:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:F:than the stockholders of corporations created in earlier, less democratic periods in the state’s history.

3:52:2643:0:12:90:164:709:121:Times:121:Times:B:1. Introduction 
3:53:2659:12:13:90:93:697:121:Times:121:Times:B: 
3:54:2659:13:13:90:93:684:121:Times:121:Times:B: 
3:55:2659:13:25:90:517:671:121:Times:121:Times:B: Over the course of the nineteenth century, the rapid growth and proliferation of business 
3:56:2749:25:25:90:518:646:121:Times:121:Times:B:corporations transformed the organization of the American economy.  The corporation became a 
3:57:2842:25:25:90:521:621:121:Times:121:Times:B:familiar part or economic life, and the financial assets issued by these enterprises became popular 
3:58:2942:25:26:90:506:596:121:Times:121:Times:B:investments among ordinary households.  The very early history of the American corporation, 
3:59:3034:26:25:90:518:570:121:Times:121:Times:B:however, was quite different.  In the years following the ratification of the Constitution, business 
3:60:3135:25:25:90:516:545:121:Times:121:Times:B:corporations were extremely rare, and their ownership was likely dominated by households who 
3:61:3228:25:26:90:500:520:121:Times:121:Times:B:were anything but ordinary.1  The first wave of incorporations in this era, which included the 
3:62:3323:26:25:89:510:494:121:Times:121:Times:B:Bank of North America, the Bank of the United States, the Bank of New York, and the Society 
3:63:3415:25:25:89:509:469:121:Times:121:Times:B:for the Establishment of Useful Manufactures, created businesses that were larger than any the 
3:64:3510:25:26:89:474:444:121:Times:121:Times:B:country had ever known. Critics expressed fears of the power and influence of the new 
3:65:3596:26:25:89:522:418:121:Times:121:Times:B:corporations, and argued that they undermined popular democracy and created an ‘aristocracy’ of 
3:66:3692:25:25:89:503:393:121:Times:121:Times:B:wealthy stockholders endowed with exclusive legal privileges. The Federalist legislators who 
3:67:3785:25:25:89:507:368:121:Times:121:Times:B:granted charters to these enterprises were accused of what John Wallis has termed “systematic 
3:68:3879:25:26:89:490:343:121:Times:121:Times:B:corruption”—the abuse of political power to manipulate the structure of the economy. The 
3:69:3968:26:25:89:508:317:121:Times:121:Times:B:political struggles over the creation of these institutions contributed in no small measure to the 
3:70:4067:25:25:89:403:292:121:Times:121:Times:B:factional divisions that led to the emergence of the Republican Party.2  
3:71:4140:25:26:90:504:267:121:Times:121:Times:B: Yet over the first decades of the nineteenth century, the American state governments, 
3:72:4226:26:25:90:515:241:121:Times:121:Times:B:under the control of those same Republicans, created more business corporations than the world 
3:73:4321:25:25:90:513:216:121:Times:121:Times:B:had ever known.  As the economy grew, and experienced what some historians have termed the 
3:74:4412:25:26:90:519:191:121:Times:121:Times:B:“market revolution,” the corporation was quickly adapted into new industries to capitalize on the 
3:75:4510:26:33:90:523:165:121:Times:121:Times:B:abundant economic opportunities that became available.3  With the vast expansion of markets, the 
3:76:4607:33:8:90:237:132:144:Times:144:Times:C:                                                 
3:77:4655:8:11:90:468:124:42:Times:100:Times:F:1 Davis (1917: II, Appendix A) documents the seven corporations created in the colonial era.   
3:78:4750:11:16:90:487:113:42:Times:100:Times:F:2 Wallis (2006); North, Wallis and Weignast (2009). The debates surrounding these enterprises are 
3:79:4848:16:7:89:340:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:discussed in Davis (1917 II:303-309) and Bodenhorn (2011a). 
3:80:4908:7:16:90:520:90:42:Times:100:Times:F:3 A synthesis of the literature on the market revolution is presented in Sellers (1991) and in Larson (2010).  
3:81:5019:16:0:90:506:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:It is important to note that this term should not be interpreted as indicating that the economy previously 
4:82:5128:0:25:90:527:709:121:Times:121:Times:B:earlier dominance of a relatively small number of elite merchants and institutions was diminished.  
4:83:5228:25:25:90:500:684:121:Times:121:Times:B:Hammond (1957: 145) puts it well:  “business was becoming democratic.  It was no longer a 
4:84:5318:25:26:90:498:659:121:Times:121:Times:B:select and innumerous aristocracy—business opportunities were falling open to everyone.”   
4:85:5409:26:25:90:519:633:121:Times:121:Times:B:Likewise corporations were no longer innumerous, and many new entrants contested the markets 
4:86:5502:25:25:90:390:608:121:Times:121:Times:B:formerly dominated by the established firms, or entered new ones.   
4:87:5570:25:25:90:516:583:121:Times:121:Times:B: Although state legislatures facilitated enormous numbers of incorporations, petitions for 
4:88:5660:25:26:90:491:558:121:Times:121:Times:B:charters remained contentious, and the familiar tropes of eighteenth-century anti-corporate 
4:89:5752:26:25:90:477:532:121:Times:121:Times:B:rhetoric found continued use.  Much of this rhetoric was directed at the owners of these 
4:90:5841:25:25:90:493:507:121:Times:121:Times:B:institutions.  Bank stockholders were called “Englishmen and Foreigners,” “Federalists and 
4:91:5931:25:26:89:492:482:121:Times:121:Times:B:tories,” and a “Gentry,” drawn from the “unproductive part of society” or the “wealthy and 
4:92:6022:26:25:89:524:456:121:Times:121:Times:B:aristocratic class,” with the power to “corrupt and subdue republican notions.”4  To a lesser extent 
4:93:6123:25:25:90:510:431:121:Times:121:Times:B:similar arguments were made about all corporations, which were likened to “aristocracies” and 
4:94:6217:25:25:90:507:406:121:Times:121:Times:B:“monopolies,” often controlled by “parcels of speculators.”5 Defenders of corporations argued 
4:95:6311:25:26:89:496:381:121:Times:121:Times:B:that were owned by huge numbers of investors, including ordinary people and “widows and 
4:96:6399:26:25:89:501:355:121:Times:121:Times:B:orphans,” and that stockholding was open to anyone with the resources to purchase a share.6  
4:97:6492:25:25:89:495:330:121:Times:121:Times:B:Some even argued that access to the corporate form could enable those of “small means” to 
4:98:6582:25:26:89:393:305:121:Times:121:Times:B:“come into fair and safe competition with the skillful and wealthy.”7 
4:99:6651:26:25:90:494:279:121:Times:121:Times:B: Did corporations remain dominated by elites, or were those of the “middle order of 
4:100:6734:25:25:90:520:254:121:Times:121:Times:B:citizens” able to incorporate their enterprises, or at least purchase shares, in the era of Republican 
4:101:6837:25:26:90:494:229:121:Times:121:Times:B:governments?  As politics became more democratic, did corporate ownership become more 
4:102:6923:26:14:90:492:203:121:Times:121:Times:B:democratic as well?  The answers to these questions are central to our understanding of the 
4:103:7015:14:12:90:524:189:144:Times:144:Times:C:                                                                                                                                                 
4:104:7159:12:11:90:518:177:100:Times:100:Times:F:lacked a market orientation.  For example, the very early market orientation among agrarian households in 
4:105:7265:11:7:90:302:166:100:Times:100:Times:F:Massachusetts is documented in Rothenberg (1992).

5:115:8079:25:25:90:491:684:121:Times:121:Times:B:have long appreciated the importance of anti-corporate rhetoric in American politics in the 
5:116:8171:25:26:89:496:659:121:Times:121:Times:B:nineteenth century, but it is difficult to evaluate or interpret these sentiments without a clear 
5:117:8269:26:25:89:481:633:121:Times:121:Times:B:understanding of who actually created and owned corporations at the time.  Although an 
5:118:8356:25:25:89:518:608:121:Times:121:Times:B:enormous literature has developed around these questions, very little evidence is available on the 
5:119:8455:25:25:89:507:583:121:Times:121:Times:B:extent of corporate ownership, or the wealth and status of stockholders, in the early nineteenth 
5:120:8552:25:26:89:128:558:121:Times:121:Times:B:century. 
5:121:8561:26:25:126:499:532:121:Times:121:Times:A:Using newly collected data from New York’s corporations in 1791 and in 1826, this 
5:122:8643:25:25:89:515:507:121:Times:121:Times:B:paper analyzes the wealth and status of early stockholders in New York City.  Stockholders lists 
5:123:8740:25:26:89:523:482:121:Times:121:Times:B:of both existing corporations in the state in 1791, and nearly half of existing corporations in 1826, 
5:124:8842:26:25:89:523:456:121:Times:121:Times:B:were transcribed and matched to city directories, tax assessment lists, and the census.  In addition, 
5:125:8944:25:25:89:496:431:121:Times:121:Times:B:random samples of the population were taken from city directories in both periods, and also 
5:126:9036:25:25:89:473:406:121:Times:121:Times:B:matched to tax lists and the census, in order to compare the stockholders to the general 
5:127:9125:25:26:89:507:381:121:Times:121:Times:B:population.  The paper uses these data to investigate the diffusion of shareholding within New 
5:128:9220:26:25:89:511:355:121:Times:121:Times:B:York City, both socially and geographically, and to analyze how the ownership of corporations 
5:129:9314:25:25:89:508:330:121:Times:121:Times:B:evolved over time.  Among the many corporations in existence in 1826 there was considerable 
5:130:9406:25:26:89:516:305:121:Times:121:Times:B:variation in the average wealth, status, and neighborhood locations of their shareholders, and we 
5:131:9504:26:25:89:518:279:121:Times:121:Times:B:investigate econometrically the corporate characteristics that were correlated with these different 
5:132:9604:25:25:89:497:254:121:Times:121:Times:B:ownership characteristics.  Although New York’s rapid growth in both population and large 
5:133:9694:25:26:89:519:229:121:Times:121:Times:B:financial institutions may have been atypical of other cities, its central role in the development of 
5:134:9796:26:25:89:510:203:121:Times:121:Times:B:the economy and capital markets of the United States makes it an important setting in which to 
5:135:9891:25:25:89:257:178:121:Times:121:Times:B:study corporations and stockholding.  
5:136:9929:25:26:89:522:153:121:Times:121:Times:B: The results of the analysis indicate that in 1791, only 6% of New York City’s households 
5:137:10018:26:25:89:520:127:121:Times:121:Times:B:owned corporate stock, but in 1826, at least 11% did, and in some parts of the city the rate was as 
5:138:10118:25:25:89:518:102:121:Times:121:Times:B:high as 35%.  Although stock was held principally by the city’s elite merchants in both 1791 and 
5:139:10215:25:0:89:509:77:121:Times:121:Times:B:1826, share ownership became more widespread over time among less affluent households.  In 
6:140:10308:0:25:90:517:709:121:Times:121:Times:B:particular, the corporations created in the 1820s were owned by investors who were less wealthy 
6:141:10404:25:25:89:499:684:121:Times:121:Times:B:than the stockholders of corporations created in earlier, less democratic periods in the state’s 
6:142:10501:25:26:90:494:659:121:Times:121:Times:B:history.  The main result of the paper is that democratization itself paid dividends, as a new 
6:143:10596:26:25:90:504:633:121:Times:121:Times:B:generation of businessmen gained access to corporate charters and sold shares to increasingly 
6:144:10690:25:25:90:522:608:121:Times:121:Times:B:‘ordinary’ households.   In a clear reflection of the changes in the politics of the city and state, the 
6:145:10795:25:25:90:521:583:121:Times:121:Times:B:wealthiest stockholders in 1791 were public officials—the very men who controlled access to the 
6:146:10891:25:26:90:512:558:121:Times:121:Times:B:corporate form—but in 1826 public officials were totally unimportant as investors in the state’s 
6:147:10988:26:25:90:487:532:121:Times:121:Times:B:corporations, and most of the prominent figures in state politics and government were not 
6:148:11078:25:25:90:181:507:121:Times:121:Times:B:stockholders at all.   
6:149:11101:25:26:90:512:482:121:Times:121:Times:B: The results of this paper contribute to several areas of research.  A substantial literature 
6:150:11194:26:25:90:506:456:121:Times:121:Times:B:on the financial history of the United States has asserted that corporate stock was quite widely 
6:151:11291:25:25:90:505:431:121:Times:121:Times:B:held throughout Wall Street’s history.  For example, Werner and Smith (1991) argue that “the 
6:152:11384:25:25:90:502:406:121:Times:121:Times:B:mainstays of the early American securities market were the more numerous men of moderate 
6:153:11473:25:26:90:512:381:121:Times:121:Times:B:means:  tradespeople, merchants, and farmers.”8  There is little evidence available on this topic, 
6:154:11572:26:25:89:524:355:121:Times:121:Times:B:however, and although this view is accepted quite generally, there are dissenters.  Pessen’s (1973) 
6:155:11672:25:25:89:521:330:121:Times:121:Times:B:study of wealth and inequality argued that “the bulk of [New York’s] population probably owned 
6:156:11767:25:26:89:503:305:121:Times:121:Times:B:nothing or a miniscule portion of [incorporated] capital.”9  Miller (1962) argues that ordinary 
6:157:11863:26:25:90:518:279:121:Times:121:Times:B:households in early nineteenth-century New York preferred the state’s canal loans, whereas only 
6:158:11959:25:25:90:522:254:121:Times:121:Times:B:wealthier households invested in bank stock (p. 87-88).  Other histories point to later events, such 
6:159:12060:25:26:90:485:229:121:Times:121:Times:B:as Jay Cooke’s efforts to retail treasury bonds during the Civil War, as exposing ordinary 
6:160:12151:26:60:90:432:203:121:Times:100:Times:B:households to securities for the first time (see for example, Geisst, 2004: 55).

6:162:12279:7:16:90:518:136:42:Times:100:Times:F:8 p. 62.  Likewise Davis (1917, II: 298) argues that a “considerable body of small savers” invested in early 
6:163:12388:16:12:89:509:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:corporations, and Angell and Ames (1832: 35) claimed of Boston that “there is scarcely an individual of 
6:164:12492:12:7:89:425:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:respectable character” who is not a stockholder or member in a private corporation. 
6:165:12576:7:16:90:510:101:42:Times:100:Times:F:9 p. 35.  Pessen qualifies this conclusion with the claim that “It is doubtless impossible to track down the 
6:166:12685:16:11:89:491:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:individual owners of corporate wealth.  Records, inadequate to begin with, have been lost” (p. 34).

7:168:12789:0:25:126:519:709:121:Times:121:Times:A:In addition, several studies have used the records of corporations in specific industries to 
7:169:12882:25:25:89:524:684:121:Times:121:Times:B:analyze the wealth and status of their shareholders or directors.  Wright (1999; 2002) analyzed the 
7:170:12982:25:26:89:505:659:121:Times:121:Times:B:stockholder lists of banks from the Mid-Atlantic states and from Maine, and Majewski (2006) 
7:171:13074:26:25:89:523:633:121:Times:121:Times:B:analyzed the lists of subscribers to Pennsylvania bank stock.  Bodenhorn (2011b) analysed a large 
7:172:13172:25:25:89:522:608:121:Times:121:Times:B:sample of bank stockholder lists from multiple states. Each of these studies found the shares to be 
7:173:13272:25:25:89:478:583:121:Times:121:Times:B:quite widely held.  Lamoreaux and Glaisek’s (1991) study of Rhode Island banks in the 
7:174:13358:25:26:89:482:558:121:Times:121:Times:B:Jacksonian era found that the directors of newer banks there were less wealthy than their 
7:175:13448:26:25:89:518:532:121:Times:121:Times:B:counterparts within long-established banks.  Davis (1958) studied the stockholder lists of several 
7:176:13547:25:25:89:521:507:121:Times:121:Times:B:prominent New England textile mills, and found a ‘vertical’ pattern of ownership in which textile 
7:177:13645:25:26:89:492:482:121:Times:121:Times:B:merchants were the most significant owners.  Majewski (1996) compared the ownership of 
7:178:13732:26:25:89:519:456:121:Times:121:Times:B:transportation companies in Pennsylvania and Virginia, and documented the importance of urban 
7:179:13826:25:25:89:512:431:121:Times:121:Times:B:capitalists in financing Pennsylvania’s railroads.  Finally, Carlos and Neal (2006) document the 
7:180:13923:25:25:89:502:406:121:Times:121:Times:B:distribution of shares of the Bank of England in the 1720s, which serves as an interesting and 
7:181:14018:25:26:89:208:381:121:Times:121:Times:B:valuable comparison case. 
7:182:14044:26:25:89:521:355:121:Times:121:Times:B: This paper builds on the approach of those studies in several ways.  First, it compares the 
7:183:14136:25:25:89:489:330:121:Times:121:Times:B:stockholders of New York’s corporations to random samples of the population, in order to 
7:184:14225:25:26:89:522:305:121:Times:121:Times:B:carefully assess how atypical stockholders were.  Second, it analyzes corporate shareholding both 
7:185:14323:26:25:89:510:279:121:Times:121:Times:B:in the earliest phase of the development of the business corporation, in 1791, and then 35 years 
7:186:14420:25:25:89:496:254:121:Times:121:Times:B:later, in 1826, when there were hundreds of corporations in the state, in order to analyze the 
7:187:14515:25:26:89:487:229:121:Times:121:Times:B:evolution of stockholding over time.  Finally, the 1826 sample includes a large number of 
7:188:14605:26:25:89:521:203:121:Times:121:Times:B:corporations in a variety of industries, and thus allows for unparalleled investigation across many 
7:189:14705:25:25:89:514:178:121:Times:121:Times:B:economic sectors.  Moreover, those 1826 corporations were created over a long time period that 
7:190:14800:25:26:89:507:153:121:Times:121:Times:B:spans enormous political and economic changes.  As a result, they varied substantially in their 
7:191:14896:26:25:89:519:127:121:Times:121:Times:B:size, charter provisions, and locations, and the effects of these differences on their ownership can 
7:192:14997:25:25:89:161:102:121:Times:121:Times:B:be investigated.

8:197:15052:13:25:90:500:671:121:Times:121:Times:B: In 1791, aristocratic landowners and merchants dominated New York City and State 
8:198:15133:25:25:90:503:646:121:Times:121:Times:B:politics.  Members of the families that owned the manorial estates along the Hudson had held 
8:199:15226:25:25:90:496:621:121:Times:121:Times:B:nearly all political offices in the colony of New York, and continued to exert overwhelming 
8:200:15318:25:26:90:514:596:121:Times:121:Times:B:influence in the state’s government in the early national period.10  The state’s conservative 1777 
8:201:15417:26:25:89:523:570:121:Times:121:Times:B:constitution was designed to maintain their position: it imposed significant property qualifications 
8:202:15518:25:25:89:522:545:121:Times:121:Times:B:for voting; created a “Council of Appointment” that selected many important officials such as the 
8:203:15616:25:26:89:513:520:121:Times:121:Times:B:Mayor of New York City; and created a “Council of Revision” within the state government that 
8:204:15709:26:25:89:502:494:121:Times:121:Times:B:checked the power of the elected legislature.11  New York’s elite families also benefited from 
8:205:15804:25:25:90:500:469:121:Times:121:Times:B:cultural norms that held that ordinary people should show respect and deference toward their 
8:206:15897:25:26:90:347:444:121:Times:121:Times:B:betters, not just in social interactions but also in politics.12 
8:207:15961:26:25:90:516:418:121:Times:121:Times:B: The social status and authority of New York’s aristocratic officeholders entitled them to 
8:208:16051:25:25:90:521:393:121:Times:121:Times:B:pursue private gain while in office.  Their interests were the state’s interests, and if they occupied 
8:209:16154:25:25:90:514:368:121:Times:121:Times:B:positions that enabled them to profit personally from their political office, it was not a source of 
8:210:16255:25:26:90:516:343:121:Times:121:Times:B:serious concern, for they were assumed to be “responsible and wise.”13  For example, New York 
8:211:16349:26:25:90:510:317:121:Times:121:Times:B:City’s (appointed) Mayor was not paid a salary, but was instead permitted to personally collect 
8:212:16445:25:25:90:509:292:121:Times:121:Times:B:most of the licenses and fees paid to the city, an extremely lucrative source of income.14  Other 
8:213:16543:25:26:90:501:267:121:Times:121:Times:B:political figures undertook major business investments while in office, and even received the 
8:214:16637:26:25:90:518:241:121:Times:121:Times:B:support of the state in their efforts.  New York’s Chancellor, Robert R Livingston, was granted a 
8:215:16735:25:15:90:512:216:121:Times:121:Times:B:twenty year monopoly on the manufacture and operation of steamboats in New York in 1798, a

8:217:16874:8:16:90:470:193:42:Times:100:Times:F:10 Kim (1978) presents the history of New York’s manors; Mark (1940) documents patterns of 
8:218:16965:16:11:90:516:177:100:Times:100:Times:F:officeholdings among the major landowning families in the colonial era. Jaher (1982) presents an analysis 
8:219:17071:11:12:90:510:166:100:Times:100:Times:F:of the continued influence of these families in the state’s politics.  As Engerman and Sokoloff (2002:14) 
8:220:17177:12:7:90:523:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:note, the system of large manorial farms ultimately failed, but this was not until the mid-nineteenth century. 
8:221:17288:7:11:90:332:147:42:Times:100:Times:F:11 Gunn (1988) summarizes the powers of these institutions. 
8:222:17348:11:16:90:491:136:42:Times:100:Times:F:12 On the culture of deference towards elites, see Bailyn (1967) and Fischer (1965).  Fox (1965) and 
8:223:17449:16:7:90:502:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:Bruegel (2002) illustrate the extent of aristocratic dominance in eighteenth century New York politics. 
8:224:17553:7:12:90:180:113:42:Times:100:Times:F:13 Bailyn (1967: 303). 
8:225:17576:12:16:90:508:101:42:Times:100:Times:F:14 For the five years Mayor James Duane held office (1784-1789), his annual income was determined to 
8:226:17677:16:11:90:512:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:have been approximately £800 ($2,000), although of course no formal accounts were kept.  During those 
8:227:17779:11:0:90:419:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:years, Duane was also a member of the New York Senate. Pomerantz (1938: 39).  
9:228:17859:0:25:90:523:709:121:Times:121:Times:B:year in which he also ran for Governor of the state.15  In the 1790s, partisan divisions among New 
9:229:17958:25:25:89:484:684:121:Times:121:Times:B:York’s elites became quite pronounced and political factions with different visions of the 
9:230:18049:25:26:89:515:659:121:Times:121:Times:B:appropriate role of government emerged. But each of these factions was led, at least initially, by 
9:231:18148:26:25:89:276:633:121:Times:121:Times:B:members of New York’s traditional elite.  
9:232:18190:25:25:126:521:608:121:Times:121:Times:A:By 1791, this political system had produced only two business corporations, both located 
9:233:18279:25:25:89:522:583:121:Times:121:Times:B:within New York City:  The Bank of New York, and the New York Society for the Establishment 
9:234:18371:25:26:89:506:558:121:Times:121:Times:B:of Manufactures (“New York Manufacturing Society”).16  The two enterprises were typical of 
9:235:18462:26:25:89:513:532:121:Times:121:Times:B:early American business corporations generally, in that they both served quasi-public purposes, 
9:236:18558:25:25:89:516:507:121:Times:121:Times:B:and were typical of other corporations in their industries, in that the bank was successful and the 
9:237:18658:25:26:89:251:482:121:Times:121:Times:B:manufacturing company was not.17   
9:238:18693:26:25:126:515:456:121:Times:121:Times:A:The Bank of New York opened as an unincorporated company in April 1784, just a few 
9:239:18776:25:25:90:523:431:121:Times:121:Times:B:months after the British ended their occupation of the city, and was immediately profitable.18  The 
9:240:18876:25:25:90:520:406:121:Times:121:Times:B:bank was founded by Federalist merchants and closely associated with Alexander Hamilton, who 
9:241:18969:25:26:90:523:381:121:Times:121:Times:B:drafted its charter.  Strong demand for its services from within New York’s merchant community, 
9:242:19065:26:25:90:524:355:121:Times:121:Times:B:coupled with the fact that it faced little competition, contributed to its immediate profitability. But 
9:243:19169:25:25:90:506:330:121:Times:121:Times:B:accusations that the bank favored Federalist borrowers and interfered in elections on behalf of 
9:244:19265:25:26:90:514:305:121:Times:121:Times:B:Federalist candidates stirred virulent opposition to the bank’s efforts to obtain a charter.  As one 
9:245:19366:26:25:90:198:279:121:Times:121:Times:B:critic of the bank wrote, 
9:246:19392:25:13:90:93:254:121:Times:121:Times:B:

9:254:19803:16:12:89:514:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:held that this monopoly interfered in interstate commerce and was unconstitutional in its 1824 Gibbons v.

9:258:20113:12:16:90:517:101:42:Times:100:Times:F:18 The founders of the bank sought a charter in 1784, but were thwarted by supporters of a rival bank.  See

10:261:20348:0:25:90:519:709:121:Times:121:Times:B:At the time when the bank finally received its charter, in 1791, it had $318,250 in paid-in capital, 
10:262:20449:25:25:90:507:684:121:Times:121:Times:B:divided into 636.5 shares of $500 each, a very high sum that was typical of the earliest banks.  
10:263:20546:25:26:89:510:659:121:Times:121:Times:B:(Median assessed wealth in New York City at the time was $570).  Its charter granted the bank 
10:264:20640:26:25:89:506:633:121:Times:121:Times:B:the right to expand its capital stock to $900,000, and subsequent revisions increased it to more 
10:265:20737:25:25:89:507:608:121:Times:121:Times:B:than $1 million.  Typical of the earliest American banks it played a semi-official role in public 
10:266:20835:25:25:89:508:583:121:Times:121:Times:B:finance in the state, and also typical of the earliest banks it enjoyed great longevity, and in fact 
10:267:20936:25:26:89:199:558:121:Times:121:Times:B:continues to exist today. 
10:268:20962:26:25:126:485:532:121:Times:121:Times:A:The New York Manufacturing Society, chartered in 1790, was one of the earliest 
10:269:21041:25:25:89:520:507:121:Times:121:Times:B:manufacturing corporations in the United States.  Like many early manufacturing corporations, it 
10:270:21138:25:26:89:521:482:121:Times:121:Times:B:was founded with the dual purpose of promoting manufacturing industries, and actually engaging 
10:271:21233:26:25:89:519:456:121:Times:121:Times:B:in manufacturing.  Also typical of early manufacturing corporations, it received financial support 
10:272:21332:25:25:89:512:431:121:Times:121:Times:B:from the state government, which subscribed to 100 of its $25 shares, whose low par value was 
10:273:21426:25:25:89:517:406:121:Times:121:Times:B:intended to make the shares affordable to artisans. The Manufacturing Society built a large brick 
10:274:21524:25:26:89:503:381:121:Times:121:Times:B:factory on Vesey Street in New York’s West Ward (see figure 1 below), and produced cotton 
10:275:21614:26:25:89:503:355:121:Times:121:Times:B:textiles using spinning jennies.20  Although the firm did manage to produce cotton textiles for 
10:276:21710:25:25:90:514:330:121:Times:121:Times:B:several years, at one point having 150 employees and more than $11,000 in total assets, it never 
10:277:21807:25:26:90:483:305:121:Times:121:Times:B:achieved profitability and was shut down by 1793.21  Its unsuccessful struggle to achieve 
10:278:21897:26:25:90:418:279:121:Times:121:Times:B:profitability was quite representative of early manufacturing corporations.

10:281:22154:26:25:90:523:203:121:Times:121:Times:B:and the city’s 1789 tax assessment list (additional details on sources and data are presented in the

10:283:22304:8:16:90:500:170:42:Times:100:Times:F:20 The Society hired Samuel Slater when he arrived in New York from England, and hoped that Slater 
10:284:22403:16:11:90:509:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:would help them improve their operations.  But Slater found their equipment “not worth using” and also 
10:285:22506:11:12:90:518:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:found the water power sources in the area inadequate and so moved to Rhode Island to work with Almy &

10:287:22709:11:7:90:262:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:powered textile mill in the United States.   
10:288:22754:7:16:90:519:113:42:Times:100:Times:F:21 The company was required in its charter to submit financial statements to the New York State Treasurer, 
10:289:22861:16:12:90:522:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:and a balance sheet from 1791 survives listing £4,546 in total assets.  (Records of the Comptroller’s Office,

11:312:24671:25:25:90:520:447:121:Times:121:Times:B:the 1791 New York City directory, and those names were also matched to the census and tax list. 
11:313:24767:25:26:125:501:422:121:Times:121:Times:A:These comparisons are presented in Table 1.  The rows of the table present the broad 
11:314:24852:26:25:89:500:396:121:Times:121:Times:B:occupational categories into which the directory listings were grouped.  Not surprisingly, the 
11:315:24947:25:25:89:516:371:121:Times:121:Times:B:occupations of stockholders tended to be quite concentrated within the category with the highest 
11:316:25044:25:25:89:523:346:121:Times:121:Times:B:average level of assessed wealth, “merchants”—the elite of the world of commerce.  Stockholders 
11:317:25140:25:26:89:506:321:121:Times:121:Times:B:were also much less likely than the population as a whole to be artisans, service providers (for 
11:318:25237:26:25:89:498:295:121:Times:121:Times:B:example, tavern keepers, hairdressers and cartmen), or fall into the “other” category (mostly 
11:319:25331:25:25:89:489:270:121:Times:121:Times:B:maritime), all occupational groups with low average levels of assessed wealth.  For all the 
11:320:25423:25:26:89:486:245:121:Times:121:Times:B:occupational categories except “professionals,” which includes attorneys and doctors, the 
11:321:25513:26:25:89:503:219:121:Times:121:Times:B:stockholders were far wealthier than the population average:  there were, for example, artisan 
11:322:25608:25:25:89:488:194:121:Times:121:Times:B:stockholders, but those artisans were clearly much wealthier than their peers. The average 
11:323:25699:25:26:89:472:169:121:Times:121:Times:B:assessed wealth of stockholders was about 2.5 times larger than that of the population.

12:326:25790:0:25:126:503:709:121:Times:121:Times:A:Slavery was legal and relatively common in New York City in the 1790s.22  From the 
12:327:25873:25:25:89:498:684:121:Times:121:Times:B:census, the number of slaves in each household was recorded, as an independent measure of 
12:328:25963:25:26:89:485:659:121:Times:121:Times:B:wealth and status. Stockholders were much more likely to own slaves, with about 66% of 
12:329:26050:26:25:89:501:633:121:Times:121:Times:B:stockholding households reporting the presence of at least one slave in their household in the 
12:330:26145:25:25:89:505:608:121:Times:121:Times:B:census, compared to about 22% for all households in the city.  The strong correlation between 
12:331:26239:25:25:89:503:583:121:Times:121:Times:B:slaveholding and stockholding was clearly driven by the fact that both occurred principally at 
12:332:26334:25:26:89:502:558:121:Times:121:Times:B:higher levels of wealth, but the connection may have been somewhat deeper.  Slaves were an 
12:333:26425:26:25:89:519:532:121:Times:121:Times:B:important investment for New York households, and wills commonly specified that slaves would 
12:334:26518:25:25:89:502:507:121:Times:121:Times:B:take care of the owner’s family (or be rented out and produce an income for the family) if the 
12:335:26613:25:26:89:521:482:121:Times:121:Times:B:owner died.  To the extent that the shares of New York’s earliest corporations also represented an 
12:336:26712:26:25:89:523:456:121:Times:121:Times:B:asset that could generate income for future generations, one would expect to see some households 
12:337:26809:25:25:89:221:431:121:Times:121:Times:B:attracted to both investments. 
12:338:26840:25:25:125:519:406:121:Times:121:Times:A:A striking feature of the data in table 1 is that the wealthiest stockholders by far were the 
12:339:26934:25:26:89:511:381:121:Times:121:Times:B:public officials—their average assessed wealth, $5,828, was more than 50% higher than that of 
12:340:27028:26:25:89:514:355:121:Times:121:Times:B:merchants.  Some of these individuals are worth noting. They include Governor George Clinton 
12:341:27121:25:25:89:522:330:121:Times:121:Times:B:(taxed at $2,500; 8 slaves); U.S. Senator Aaron Burr ($7,500; 5 slaves); U.S. Senator Rufus King, 
12:342:27219:25:26:89:511:305:121:Times:121:Times:B:who was also a director of the Bank of New York ($1,500; no slaves); Chief Justice of the U.S. 
12:343:27314:26:25:89:499:279:121:Times:121:Times:B:Supreme Court John Jay ($8,700; 5 slaves); Mayor Richard Varick ($2,425; 1 slave), former 
12:344:27404:25:25:89:500:254:121:Times:121:Times:B:mayor and current U.S. District Court judge James Duane ($8,125, 1 slave), New York State 
12:345:27494:25:26:89:515:229:121:Times:121:Times:B:Senator Isaac Roosevelt, who was President of the Bank of New York ($29,050; no slaves); and 
12:346:27587:26:25:89:500:203:121:Times:121:Times:B:U.S. Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton ($3,000; no slaves). 23  That Burr and Hamilton 
12:347:27678:25:25:89:520:178:121:Times:121:Times:B:were both stockholders in the Bank of New York is also worth noting; although the Bank of New 
12:348:27772:25:21:89:524:153:121:Times:121:Times:B:York was strongly associated with the Federalist Party, there were prominent Republicans among

12:352:28048:7:16:90:523:101:42:Times:100:Times:F:23 In 1791, New York City was the capital of both the State of New York and of the United States, although 
12:353:28155:16:11:90:523:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:within that year, the Federal government moved to Philadelphia, and in 1799 the state capital was moved to

14:413:32229:25:25:89:524:413:121:Times:121:Times:B:found in New York’s East and Montgomery wards, where a relatively large portion of households 
14:414:32323:25:26:89:519:388:121:Times:121:Times:B:were headed by merchants, and slaveholding was relatively common.  Households in the western 
14:415:32416:26:25:89:520:362:121:Times:121:Times:B:and northern part of Manhattan, the Out and West wards, had far lower levels of wealth and were 
14:416:32512:25:25:89:512:337:121:Times:121:Times:B:often headed by artisans.  Rates of stock ownership can be calculated from these data; overall it 
14:417:32610:25:26:89:511:312:121:Times:121:Times:B:was quite low, and reached its maximum in the wealthy East ward, and its minimum in the Out 
14:418:32702:26:25:89:478:286:121:Times:121:Times:B:ward, although there were at least a few stockholders in every ward.  Overall the rate of 
14:419:32792:25:25:89:243:261:121:Times:121:Times:B:households owning stock was 6%. 
14:420:32824:25:25:125:517:236:121:Times:121:Times:A:Taken together, the data in tables 1 and 2 indicate that the city’s stockholders were quite 
14:421:32916:25:26:89:519:211:121:Times:121:Times:B:atypical of the population.  They lived in exclusive neighborhoods; they were quite wealthy, and  
14:422:33014:26:25:89:504:185:121:Times:121:Times:B:likely to own slaves; and they were unlikely to be artisans or hold other modest occupations.   
14:423:33110:25:25:89:505:160:121:Times:121:Times:B:They were often elite merchants, with ties to the state’s aristocratic landowning families.  The 
14:424:33207:25:38:89:515:135:121:Times:121:Times:B:city was an extraordinarily unequal and economically segregated place, and the individuals who

14:426:33350:7:16:90:518:90:42:Times:100:Times:F:24 Using his 100% sample from the 1789 tax list, White (1991:xxvii) finds the wealth share of the top 10% 
14:427:33456:16:0:90:340:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:was 55.6%.  In our sample of 15% of households, it is 50.8%. 
15:428:33520:0:25:90:489:709:121:Times:121:Times:B:invested in stock were drawn from the very top ranks of the wealth distribution. Given the 
15:429:33611:25:25:90:508:684:121:Times:121:Times:B:initially uncertain prospects of these firms, this may have represented an efficient allocation of 
15:430:33710:25:26:90:240:659:121:Times:121:Times:B:risks, and was all but inevitable.   
15:431:33747:26:25:126:513:633:121:Times:121:Times:A:But the elites who owned these firms also controlled the government of the state and of 
15:432:33835:25:25:90:524:608:121:Times:121:Times:B:the city.  A corporation could only be formed by a special act of the state legislature, which meant 
15:433:33936:25:25:90:476:583:121:Times:121:Times:B:that these shareholder-politicians could protect their firms from competition and enrich 
15:434:34025:25:26:90:501:558:121:Times:121:Times:B:themselves by simply refusing to grant potential competitors a corporate charter.  And this is 
15:435:34120:26:25:89:496:532:121:Times:121:Times:B:exactly what they did:  the next bank to be created in New York, the Bank of the Manhattan 
15:436:34211:25:25:90:524:507:121:Times:121:Times:B:Company, was not incorporated until 1799, and was granted a charter only because its Republican 
15:437:34307:25:26:89:515:482:121:Times:121:Times:B:founders deceived the legislature about their intentions.25  But a process of significant economic 
15:438:34406:26:25:90:520:456:121:Times:121:Times:B:and political change was well underway by the early nineteenth century, which made broader use

15:443:34571:12:26:90:516:343:121:Times:121:Times:B: The 35 years that elapsed after 1791 witnessed a transformation of the economy of New 
15:444:34657:26:25:90:514:317:121:Times:121:Times:B:York.  Transportation networks expanded and developed, with steamboats traveling the Hudson 
15:445:34749:25:25:90:514:292:121:Times:121:Times:B:river and the Erie Canal opening a waterway to the west; the port of New York City emerged as 
15:446:34843:25:26:90:511:267:121:Times:121:Times:B:the nation’s largest center for trade; successful, large-scale manufacturing enterprises emerged, 
15:447:34941:26:25:90:521:241:121:Times:121:Times:B:and began to replace household production of goods such as textiles; financial markets deepened; 
15:448:35038:25:25:90:519:216:121:Times:121:Times:B:and increasingly specialized producers and distributors transacted in a market that was becoming 
15:449:35135:25:26:90:511:191:121:Times:121:Times:B:far more integrated.  The population of New York City grew from 33,131 in 1790 to more than 
15:450:35227:26:25:90:478:165:121:Times:121:Times:B:166,036 in 1825, as it surpassed Philadelphia to become the nation’s largest.  Economic 
15:451:35315:25:20:90:436:140:121:Times:121:Times:B:opportunity abounded in the city, and its population became more prosperous.

16:471:36581:25:25:126:490:513:121:Times:121:Times:A:Over these years, the state government used the law creatively and aggressively to 
16:472:36664:25:26:90:504:488:121:Times:121:Times:B:promote economic development.26  In particular, this meant granting ever greater numbers of  
16:473:36757:26:25:89:518:462:121:Times:121:Times:B:charters to businesses in many industries. In some sectors, particularly banking, incumbent firms 
16:474:36855:25:25:89:522:437:121:Times:121:Times:B:successfully limited access to the corporate form, but enormous numbers of charters were granted 
16:475:36952:25:25:89:519:412:121:Times:121:Times:B:in other industries.27  From 1790 to 1825, 812 corporations were created, and in 1826, there were 
16:476:37050:25:26:89:520:387:121:Times:121:Times:B:approximately 282 corporations in existence in the state, of which about 73 were located in New  
16:477:37147:26:25:89:510:361:121:Times:121:Times:B:York City.  Turnpike roads, bridge companies, water companies, gas companies, trading firms, 
16:478:37240:25:25:89:495:336:121:Times:121:Times:B:steamboat lines, insurance companies, and many other types of firms were incorporated.  In 
16:479:37331:25:26:89:517:311:121:Times:121:Times:B:manufacturing, the state even enacted a general incorporation act in 1811, facilitating essentially 
16:480:37431:26:25:89:502:285:121:Times:121:Times:B:open access to the corporate form in several manufacturing industries.28  Over time, access to 
16:481:37526:25:25:89:515:260:121:Times:121:Times:B:incorporation expanded significantly, and a broad range of individuals and interests formed new 
16:482:37622:25:25:89:118:235:121:Times:121:Times:B:firms. 
16:483:37629:25:26:125:519:210:121:Times:121:Times:A:Shareholder lists for 133 of these 282 corporations were located and transcribed. Table 3 
16:484:37719:26:25:89:485:184:121:Times:121:Times:B:presents summary statistics for the ownership of the 133 corporations in the sample.  The 
16:485:37809:25:39:89:522:159:121:Times:121:Times:B:corporations were owned overwhelmingly by individuals and partnerships, and it is these owners

17:505:39666:25:25:90:506:540:121:Times:121:Times:B:who will be the focus of the analysis.29  But a substantial portion of some corporations’ shares 
17:506:39763:25:26:89:491:515:121:Times:121:Times:B:were owned by trusts or estates, and it is important to note that the wealth and status of the 
17:507:39858:26:25:89:494:489:121:Times:121:Times:B:ultimate beneficiaries of those shares cannot be identified, as the stockholder lists normally 
17:508:39953:25:25:89:436:464:121:Times:121:Times:B:provided the names of the trustees or executors, rather than the beneficiaries.   
17:509:40035:25:25:125:494:439:121:Times:121:Times:A:The average size and ownership structures of the corporations varied widely across 
17:510:40118:25:26:89:515:414:121:Times:121:Times:B:industries.  Table 4 presents summary statistics for the industrial categories into which the firms 
17:511:40218:26:25:89:505:388:121:Times:121:Times:B:were grouped.  The data in the table indicate that banks were substantially larger than firms in 
17:512:40315:25:25:89:520:363:121:Times:121:Times:B:other industries.  In many respects, though, the manufacturing firms were the most unusual:  they 
17:513:40413:25:26:89:494:338:121:Times:121:Times:B:had the highest par value for their shares, the lowest number of shareholders by far, and the 
17:514:40507:26:25:89:503:312:121:Times:121:Times:B:largest average value of investment per shareholder (‘Value of Investment’ in the table).  The 
17:515:40602:25:25:89:515:287:121:Times:121:Times:B:banks and insurance companies both had very large average numbers of shareholders, reflecting 
17:516:40696:25:26:89:493:262:121:Times:121:Times:B:their greater size, and reasonably low par values, which likely improved the liquidity of the 
17:517:40790:26:25:89:524:236:121:Times:121:Times:B:shares.30  The shares of nearly all of the banks and insurance companies in the sample were traded 
17:518:40889:25:25:90:325:211:121:Times:121:Times:B:on the New York Stock & Exchange Board (NYSE). 
17:519:40936:25:25:126:520:186:121:Times:121:Times:A:For the 133 corporations in the sample, the addresses and occupations of all stockholders 
17:520:41026:25:18:90:518:161:121:Times:121:Times:B:residing in New York City who could be found in the city directory were recorded. Their names

17:522:41169:7:16:90:509:136:42:Times:100:Times:F:29 Partnerships where none of the individual partners were also shareholders were treated as if they were 
17:523:41275:16:12:90:495:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:individuals, with their taxable wealth and industry or occupation recorded in the data.  The wealth of 
17:524:41378:12:11:90:496:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:partnerships where the partners also owned stock under their own names was added to the individual 
17:525:41477:11:7:90:289:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:partners’ wealth and eliminated from the sample. 
17:526:41526:7:16:90:514:90:42:Times:100:Times:F:30 The significance of par values for the liquidity of corporate shares in the nineteenth century is analyzed 
17:527:41636:16:0:90:173:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:in Rousseau (2009). 
18:528:41659:0:25:90:509:709:121:Times:121:Times:B:and addresses were then used to obtain measures of their wealth from the city’s tax assessment 
18:529:41754:25:25:90:504:684:121:Times:121:Times:B:rolls.  The assessments list real and personal wealth separately, and exclude corporate wealth, 
18:530:41850:25:26:89:499:659:121:Times:121:Times:B:which under the state’s 1823-28 tax law was assessed on the corporations themselves, which 
18:531:41941:26:25:89:523:633:121:Times:121:Times:B:would then pay the tax on their own real and personal property.31  Although assessors were sworn 
18:532:42038:25:25:90:522:608:121:Times:121:Times:B:to record accurate property values, their assessments likely understated the true values.32  As with 
18:533:42139:25:25:89:516:583:121:Times:121:Times:B:the analysis for 1791, a random sample of households was taken from the 1826 city directory, to 
18:534:42235:25:26:89:519:558:121:Times:121:Times:B:serve as a basis of comparison to the stockholders.  This sample was equivalent in size to 10% of 
18:535:42333:26:25:89:273:532:121:Times:121:Times:B:the population of directory entries.  
18:536:42370:25:25:125:487:507:121:Times:121:Times:A:About 3,000 New York City households owned shares of stock in 1826, a tenfold 
18:537:42448:25:26:89:475:482:121:Times:121:Times:B:increase from 1791.33  Table 5 presents average assessed wealth and occupations of the 
18:538:42535:26:25:90:524:456:121:Times:121:Times:B:population and the stockholders of New York City in the same format as the 1791 data in table 1.  
18:539:42633:25:25:90:524:431:121:Times:121:Times:B:Interestingly, the occupational structure of the population remained quite similar in 1826, with the 
18:540:42734:25:25:90:512:406:121:Times:121:Times:B:only significant changes being a decline in the share engaged in the provision of services, and a 
18:541:42832:25:26:90:517:381:121:Times:121:Times:B:small increase in the share of those listed as merchants.  In a sense, the population of 1826 was a 
18:542:42932:26:25:90:516:355:121:Times:121:Times:B:vastly scaled-up version of the 1791 population.  But average wealth grew nearly threefold from 
18:543:43028:25:25:90:520:330:121:Times:121:Times:B:1791, a clear sign of rising prosperity in the city, and the rising property values that accompanied 
18:544:43129:25:26:90:517:305:121:Times:121:Times:B:that prosperity.34  The average taxable wealth of stockholders also grew by the same proportion,

18:547:43275:7:16:90:517:251:42:Times:100:Times:F:31 The items included in personal property were enumerated in a subsequent law: government bonds, bank 
18:548:43378:16:12:90:514:235:100:Times:100:Times:F:notes, bank deposits, furniture, and loans such as mortgages made to solvent borrowers.  Revised Statutes 
18:549:43483:12:11:90:492:223:100:Times:100:Times:F:(1829), Vol. I ch. III.  The exclusion of corporate wealth from tax assessments was made in order to 
18:550:43584:11:12:90:522:212:100:Times:100:Times:F:facilitate more effective collection of taxes on corporate stock, since shares in private hands could easily be 
18:551:43696:12:7:90:325:200:100:Times:100:Times:F:concealed from assessors.  New York Laws, 1823, ch. 262. 
18:552:43753:7:16:90:509:193:42:Times:100:Times:F:32 The tax law of 1823 stipulates that “real and personal property shall be valued by the assessors for the 
18:553:43860:16:11:90:518:177:100:Times:100:Times:F:purpose of taxation at the value they would appraise such estate in payment of a bona fide debt due from a 
18:554:43967:11:12:90:516:166:100:Times:100:Times:F:solvent debtor.”  New York Laws, 1823, ch. 262.   However, contemporary observers and modern scholars 
18:555:44069:12:11:90:496:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:both argue that assessments substantially understated true wealth.  For example, Hilt and O’Banion’s 
18:556:44170:11:12:90:516:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:(2009) analysis of New York merchants in the 1850s found assessed values of wealth to be equal to about 
18:557:44274:12:11:90:513:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:36% of estimated net worth as recoded by the R.G. Dun & Company agents.  See also Pessen (1973) and 
18:558:44374:11:7:90:198:120:100:Times:144:Times:C:the sources cited therein.   
18:559:44403:7:16:90:487:113:42:Times:100:Times:F:33 It should be noted that this is almost certainly an undercount, since the stockholder lists of many 
18:560:44506:16:7:90:223:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:corporations could not be found. 
18:561:44539:7:16:90:505:90:42:Times:100:Times:F:34 All data are presented in nominal terms.  According to the David-Solar-based CPI for this period, the 
18:562:44644:16:0:90:341:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:total increase in the price level from 1791 to 1826 was 5.31%.

19:582:46147:25:26:90:519:475:121:Times:121:Times:B:and the ratio of the stockholders’ wealth to the population’s wealth remained essentially constant 
19:583:46246:26:25:90:266:449:121:Times:121:Times:B:between the two periods, at about 2.5.   
19:584:46287:25:25:126:494:424:121:Times:121:Times:A:Among the stockholders, the occupational distribution was also similar to the 1791 
19:585:46370:25:26:90:515:399:121:Times:121:Times:B:values, with two important exceptions.  First, the share of professionals increased substantially.  
19:586:46470:26:25:90:523:373:121:Times:121:Times:B:This group included many individuals whose livelihoods depended on corporations either directly 
19:587:46566:25:25:90:477:348:121:Times:121:Times:B:(such as bank cashiers) or indirectly (such as attorneys), and the large size of this group 
19:588:46658:25:25:90:487:323:121:Times:121:Times:B:potentially indicates a growing effect of corporations on employment patterns in the city.  
19:589:46750:25:26:90:500:298:121:Times:121:Times:B:Secondly, public officials were no longer important stockholders.35  And although the public 
19:590:46843:26:25:90:504:272:121:Times:121:Times:B:officials who owned stock were quite wealthy, they were no longer the wealthiest category of 
19:591:46936:25:25:90:514:247:121:Times:121:Times:B:stockholders.  More importantly, neither the governor, DeWitt Clinton, nor U.S. Senator Martin 
19:592:47031:25:26:90:508:222:121:Times:121:Times:B:Van Buren, the most powerful figure in the state’s Republican Party, were stockholders in any 
19:593:47125:26:30:90:520:196:121:Times:121:Times:B:New York corporation.36  As in 1791, within every occupational category, the stockholders were  
19:594:47221:30:7:90:237:166:144:Times:144:Times:C:                                                 
19:595:47269:7:16:90:492:159:42:Times:100:Times:F:35 A potential concern is that many 1826 corporations were considerably older than the corporations 
19:596:47369:16:12:90:486:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:observed in 1791. This age difference may account for some of the differences in the occupational 
19:597:47467:12:11:90:505:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:distributions of shareholders, if, say, share were initially allocated to public officials, who then sold the 
19:598:47577:11:12:90:510:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:shares over time.  However, the occupations of the shareholders of the newest 1826 corporations—those 
19:599:47679:12:11:90:512:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:created in 1824 and 1825—are also quite different from the 1791 stockholders’ and in fact only 1.5% are 
19:600:47783:11:7:90:459:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:public officials.  Data on stockholder wealth by year of incorporation are presented below.   
19:601:47877:7:16:90:485:90:42:Times:100:Times:F:36 In New York City politics, however, the picture was different.  The Mayor in 1826 was William 
19:602:47974:16:0:90:394:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:Paulding, Jr., a shareholder in two insurance corporations taxed at $18,500.

20:611:48441:25:26:126:511:265:121:Times:121:Times:A:In 1826, we can once again examine the social context of shareholding in greater depth 
20:612:48528:26:25:89:526:239:121:Times:121:Times:B:by looking at the geographical distribution of the corporations themselves, and their shareholders.  
20:613:48629:25:25:89:467:214:121:Times:121:Times:B:As New York’s population grew and shifted uptown over time, the city’s wards were 
20:614:48711:25:26:89:519:189:121:Times:121:Times:B:reconfigured repeatedly, and by 1826 the ward boundaries had almost no relationship with those  
20:615:48807:26:25:89:510:163:121:Times:121:Times:B:of 1790-91.  Figure 2 presents a map of the city with the ward boundaries in place in 1826, and

20:617:48998:25:25:89:503:113:121:Times:121:Times:B:located in the First Ward, and nearly all of those were headquartered on Wall Street, which is

21:657:52345:11:10:58:541:435:81:Times:81:Times:F:that owned stock is estimated by apportioning the stockholders who could not be identified uniquely in the directory into wards at the

21:662:52667:26:25:90:515:365:121:Times:121:Times:B:and mining firms.  Nonetheless, a substantial minority of New York’s corporations were located 
21:663:52762:25:25:89:203:340:121:Times:121:Times:B:in the city’s upper wards. 
21:664:52789:25:26:126:488:315:121:Times:121:Times:A:Table 6 presents data on wealth, occupations and stockholding by ward.  The data 
21:665:52870:26:25:89:524:289:121:Times:121:Times:B:indicate that the proportion of households that owned stock had nearly doubled, from about 6% in 
21:666:52967:25:25:89:505:264:121:Times:121:Times:B:1791 to 11%, and in the richest (First) ward the rate was 35%.   But the data also indicate that 
21:667:53064:25:25:89:510:239:121:Times:121:Times:B:there was greater inequality across wards in 1826, with households in the First Ward having an 
21:668:53159:25:26:89:501:214:121:Times:121:Times:B:average level of taxable wealth that was nearly ten-fold higher than that of the poorest ward.  
21:669:53255:26:25:89:514:188:121:Times:121:Times:B:Following the rows down the table, and thus moving toward the “mechanic” wards uptown, one 
21:670:53346:25:25:89:523:163:121:Times:121:Times:B:sees the proportion of artisans increase, the average level of wealth decrease, and the rate of stock 
21:671:53448:25:26:89:519:138:121:Times:121:Times:B:ownership also decreases.  But wealth and stockholding were imperfectly correlated, and even in 
21:672:53544:26:25:89:479:112:121:Times:121:Times:B:some of the wards where average household wealth was relatively low, the rate of stock

22:698:55070:25:25:126:482:469:121:Times:121:Times:A:The data in the table also provide an indication of the degree of inequality of the 
22:699:55154:25:26:89:517:444:121:Times:121:Times:B:distribution of assessed wealth, and corporate wealth, across wards.  The overall Gini coefficient 
22:700:55253:26:25:89:509:418:121:Times:121:Times:B:for the distribution of assessed wealth was .65, which was essentially unchanged from its 1791 
22:701:55348:25:25:89:516:393:121:Times:121:Times:B:value of .66.  And the First Ward, which accounted for only about 11% of directory entries, held 
22:702:55445:25:26:89:524:368:121:Times:121:Times:B:about 37% of assessed wealth.  However, a much greater share of corporate stock, 47%, was held  
22:703:55541:26:25:89:517:342:121:Times:121:Times:B:there, indicating that the ownership of corporate wealth was even more concentrated than that of 
22:704:55638:25:25:89:158:317:121:Times:121:Times:B:taxable wealth. 
22:705:55654:25:25:125:516:292:121:Times:121:Times:A:Did the composition of stockholders vary by industry?  Perhaps the shares of companies 
22:706:55741:25:26:89:499:267:121:Times:121:Times:B:in specific industries were attractive to particular types of investors.  One might imagine, for 
22:707:55838:26:25:89:521:241:121:Times:121:Times:B:example, that large publicly traded banks and insurance companies would be attractive to passive 
22:708:55935:25:25:89:510:216:121:Times:121:Times:B:investors from middle-income households, whereas shares in manufacturing companies, which 
22:709:56025:25:26:89:514:191:121:Times:121:Times:B:were highly illiquid, would have been more attractive to individuals with some knowledge of or 
22:710:56120:26:25:89:484:165:121:Times:121:Times:B:connection to the firm, as Davis (1956) has shown of New England’s textile companies.   
22:711:56208:25:25:125:498:140:121:Times:121:Times:A:Table 7 presents a breakdown of the occupations of shareholders by industry.37  The 
22:712:56292:25:18:89:521:115:121:Times:121:Times:B:occupational distributions of the stockholders across industries were generally similar, with those 
22:713:56392:18:7:90:237:97:144:Times:144:Times:C:                                                 
22:714:56440:7:16:90:519:90:42:Times:100:Times:F:37 Note that the table presents the percentages of shares owned in each industry, rather than the percentage 
22:715:56549:16:0:89:239:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:of shareholders, as in tables 1 and 5. 
23:716:56591:0:25:90:517:709:121:Times:121:Times:B:of bank and insurance being nearly identical.  In manufacturing firms, artisans owned shares at a 
23:717:56689:25:25:89:524:684:121:Times:121:Times:B:substantially higher rate than they did in other industries.  It is worth noting that the transportation 
23:718:56794:25:26:89:494:659:121:Times:121:Times:B:companies, which included turnpike roads, bridges, canals, and steamboat companies, were 
23:719:56883:26:25:89:505:633:121:Times:121:Times:B:mostly located outside of New York City, and it was probably wealthy merchants who owned 
23:720:56972:25:25:89:522:608:121:Times:121:Times:B:land in the areas where the companies were located who bought shares in those firms—their local 
23:721:57068:25:25:89:504:583:121:Times:121:Times:B:shareholders may have had a somewhat different occupational distribution.38  In any case, the 
23:722:57162:25:26:89:514:558:121:Times:121:Times:B:investors in transportation companies and companies grouped into the residual “other” category 
23:723:57257:26:25:89:480:532:121:Times:121:Times:B:(which included a water company, a trading company, a gas company, etc.) were highly 
23:724:57342:25:25:89:491:507:121:Times:121:Times:B:concentrated in the elite categories of merchants and professionals, and received very little 
23:725:57436:25:26:89:340:482:121:Times:49:Times:B:investments from almost any other occupational group.

23:730:57541:25:25:126:467:393:121:Times:121:Times:A:In the 35-year interval between 1791 and 1826, New York’s politics changed 
23:731:57616:25:25:89:523:368:121:Times:121:Times:B:considerably.  Popular participation in politics expanded, and the old aristocracy saw its influence 
23:732:57717:25:26:89:517:343:121:Times:121:Times:B:in the state’s politics gradually diminish.39  Progress was made toward the elimination of slavery 
23:733:57816:26:25:89:507:317:121:Times:121:Times:B:through a gradual manumission act in 1799, which was then strengthened in 1817.40   Political 
23:734:57910:25:25:89:513:292:121:Times:121:Times:B:“societies” and voluntary organizations emerged, mobilizing political participation and creating 
23:735:58007:25:26:89:521:267:121:Times:121:Times:B:the foundations for the Second Party System of the Jacksonian Era.41  A relatively new species of 
23:736:58105:26:25:89:516:241:121:Times:121:Times:B:political figure, the professional politician, emerged. Beliefs in “inherent, irradicable differences 
23:737:58207:25:38:89:519:216:121:Times:121:Times:B:among men” which formed the basis of the hierarchical order of society with aristocratic elites at

23:739:58354:8:16:90:518:170:42:Times:100:Times:F:38 In general, the breakdowns for the occupations of manufacturing firms’ stockholders are consistent with 
23:740:58461:16:11:90:514:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:the findings of Davis (1956), and those of the banks are roughly consistent with the findings of Majewski 
23:741:58567:11:12:90:522:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:(2006) for Pennsylvania bank stockholders from around 1814, although those banks seemed to attract more 
23:742:58671:12:7:90:264:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:numerous small investments from artisans. 
23:743:58713:7:11:90:287:124:42:Times:100:Times:F:39 The story of this process is told in Fox (1965). 
23:744:58765:11:16:90:519:113:42:Times:100:Times:F:40 Laws of New York, 1817, ch. 137. By the 1817 act, all slaves born before July 4, 1799 were to be free on 
23:745:58872:16:12:90:521:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:July 4, 1827, whereas those born after that date were to be free at a certain age, depending on their gender.  
23:746:58983:12:7:90:412:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:The Federal Census lists 518 slaves in New York City in 1820 and 17 in 1830.   
23:747:59062:7:0:90:198:78:42:Times:100:Times:F:41 See McCormick (1966). 
24:748:59090:0:25:90:491:709:121:Times:121:Times:B:the top were rejected.42  To be sure, many aristocratic landowners and merchants remained 
24:749:59180:25:25:89:477:684:121:Times:121:Times:B:important figures in the state’s politics, but individuals of more modest levels of wealth 
24:750:59271:25:26:89:521:659:121:Times:121:Times:B:demanded much greater influence.   And in 1821, this process of democratization culminated in a 
24:751:59367:26:25:89:492:633:121:Times:121:Times:B:new constitution that abolished the Councils of Appointment and Revision, and effectively 
24:752:59457:25:25:89:392:608:121:Times:121:Times:B:eliminated property qualifications for voting by adult white males.43 
24:753:59526:25:25:126:496:583:121:Times:121:Times:A:Did this political transformation expand access to the corporate form, or change the 
24:754:59611:25:26:90:518:558:121:Times:121:Times:B:character of the corporations that were created?  Certainly the names chosen by incorporators for 
24:755:59709:26:25:90:520:532:121:Times:121:Times:B:their enterprises began to change.  Whereas early New York charters were granted to the Bank of

24:757:59895:25:26:90:500:482:121:Times:121:Times:B:included the Mechanics Bank (1810), Farmers Fire Insurance and Loan (1822), Tradesmen’s 
24:758:59983:26:25:90:516:456:121:Times:121:Times:B:Bank (1823), and Tradesmen’s Insurance (1825), a tradition that would ultimately continue with 
24:759:60078:25:25:90:524:431:121:Times:121:Times:B:institutions such as the Butcher’s and Drover’s Bank (1830) and the Leather Manufacturers’ Bank 
24:760:60174:25:25:90:509:406:121:Times:121:Times:B:(1832).  Likewise, petitions and memorials seeking corporate charters claimed that they would 
24:761:60268:25:26:90:507:381:121:Times:121:Times:B:operate in the uptown “mechanic” wards of Manhattan—neighborhoods that had attracted few 
24:762:60357:26:25:90:523:355:121:Times:121:Times:B:investments from “persons owning large quantities of property”—and argued that the profits from 
24:763:60453:25:25:90:514:330:121:Times:121:Times:B:providing services in those neighborhoods should be earned by a company in which “those who 
24:764:60545:25:26:90:513:305:121:Times:121:Times:B:have to pay the money have an interest.”44  But whether these newer corporations were actually 
24:765:60640:26:25:89:518:279:121:Times:121:Times:B:owned or managed by groups previously excluded from access to the corporate form, or whether 
24:766:60733:25:25:89:498:254:121:Times:121:Times:B:these were merely cynical gestures intended to win political support for a charter, is unclear. 
24:767:60829:25:26:125:502:229:121:Times:121:Times:A:If the process of democratization of the state’s politics actually did allocate corporate 
24:768:60919:26:25:89:506:203:121:Times:121:Times:B:charters to previously excluded groups, or create corporations owned by households that were 
24:769:61012:25:25:89:483:178:121:Times:121:Times:B:less wealthy than their predecessors, then the aggregate statistics for the ownership of all 
24:770:61105:25:33:89:516:153:121:Times:121:Times:B:corporations in 1826 presented in table 5 above likely concealed this pattern of change.  In order

25:776:61500:0:25:90:514:709:121:Times:121:Times:B:to investigate the effects of democratization on incorporations, the ownership of corporations of 
25:777:61598:25:25:90:504:684:121:Times:121:Times:B:different ‘vintages’ in 1826 will be compared. The hypothesis to be investigated is that newer 
25:778:61693:25:26:90:513:659:121:Times:121:Times:B:corporations—those created in more democratic eras—would have been owned by less wealthy 
25:779:61782:26:25:90:509:633:121:Times:121:Times:B:or prominent shareholders.  As the New York City stockholders that are the focus of this paper 
25:780:61877:25:25:90:495:608:121:Times:121:Times:B:frequently constituted a small minority of the total shareholders of upstate corporations, the 
25:781:61972:25:25:90:510:583:121:Times:121:Times:B:analysis will focus on to the 53 corporations located within the city for which an ownership list 
25:782:62070:25:26:90:210:558:121:Times:121:Times:B:could be found for 1826.    
25:783:62098:26:25:90:520:532:121:Times:121:Times:B: Before examining the data, it is worth noting that any initial differences in the ownership 
25:784:62190:25:25:90:493:507:121:Times:121:Times:B:of corporations created in different eras likely dissipated over time.   One might expect, for 
25:785:62285:25:26:90:518:482:121:Times:121:Times:B:example, that the ownership of new corporations would be quite concentrated in the hands of the 
25:786:62381:26:25:90:504:456:121:Times:121:Times:B:founders, but would gradually diffuse as the founders sold off their stakes and other investors 
25:787:62477:25:25:90:509:431:121:Times:121:Times:B:purchased the shares.45  Moreover, if newer companies’ prospects were less certain, one would 
25:788:62571:25:25:89:494:406:121:Times:121:Times:B:expect their shares to be held by specialized investors who would be best able to gauge and 
25:789:62663:25:26:89:503:381:121:Times:121:Times:B:perhaps hedge their risks.  This would imply that older corporations would tend to have more 
25:790:62756:26:25:89:509:355:121:Times:121:Times:B:diffuse ownership and larger numbers of small investors than they had initially, thus obscuring 
25:791:62852:25:25:89:528:330:121:Times:121:Times:B:any differences between those corporations and their successors created in a more democratic era.   
25:792:62952:25:26:125:503:305:121:Times:121:Times:A:Figure 4 presents the ownership of New York City’s corporations in 1826, by charter 
25:793:63036:26:25:89:524:279:121:Times:121:Times:B:year.  (The corporations are grouped into three-year periods because in some years there were few 
25:794:63134:25:25:89:507:254:121:Times:121:Times:B:incorporations.)   Panels (a) and (b) plot the ownership rates of artisans and merchants, both in 
25:795:63232:25:26:89:511:229:121:Times:121:Times:B:terms of the percentage of the stock held, and the percentage of the stockholders.  Although the 
25:796:63329:26:25:89:523:203:121:Times:121:Times:B:rate of ownership by artisans generally remained low, newer corporations tended to be owned at a 
25:797:63426:25:25:89:507:178:121:Times:121:Times:B:higher rate by these men, and the rate of ownership of merchants was generally declining over 
25:798:63520:25:26:89:513:153:121:Times:121:Times:B:time.  Newer corporations attracted investments from less-elite households at higher rates—and 
25:799:63615:26:30:89:513:127:121:Times:121:Times:B:these households were less elite not only in terms of their occupations, but also in their level of

25:801:63764:7:16:90:502:90:42:Times:100:Times:F:45 This is certainly the case with modern corporations.  See, for example, Helwege, Pirinksy, and Stulz

27:871:64839:25:25:89:505:684:121:Times:121:Times:B:generally decreasing with the year of incorporation.  In fact the average wealth of investors of 
27:872:64936:25:26:89:491:659:121:Times:121:Times:B:corporations chartered prior to 1810 was nearly 2.5 times as high as that of the investors in 
27:873:65030:26:25:89:498:633:121:Times:121:Times:B:corporations chartered in 1823 or later—a difference of the same magnitude as that between 
27:874:65121:25:25:89:500:608:121:Times:121:Times:B:stockholders and all households.  Panel (d) plots the size of the blocks in which the shares of 
27:875:65217:25:25:89:507:583:121:Times:121:Times:B:corporations were held; this was also generally falling over time, although most of this change 
27:876:65313:25:26:89:508:558:121:Times:121:Times:B:occurred in the earliest periods.  Although the ownership of corporate stock was still relatively 
27:877:65411:26:25:89:512:532:121:Times:121:Times:B:uncommon and median household wealth ($1,683) was quite low relative to the cost of a single 
27:878:65504:25:25:89:493:507:121:Times:121:Times:B:share (usually $50), share ownership was clearly becoming more common among less elite 
27:879:65591:25:26:89:504:482:121:Times:121:Times:B:segments of society.  Thus despite the tendency of the shares of older firms to become widely 
27:880:65685:26:25:89:499:456:121:Times:121:Times:B:held, persistent differences in the wealth and status of owners among corporations created in 
27:881:65779:25:25:89:399:431:121:Times:121:Times:B:different eras were clearly observable in the stockholder lists of 1826. 
27:882:65852:25:25:89:504:406:121:Times:121:Times:B: If the stockholders of newer corporations were less wealthy, what about the men who 
27:883:65936:25:26:89:523:381:121:Times:121:Times:B:actually controlled the enterprises, and were best able to profit from their operations?  Perhaps the 
27:884:66038:26:25:89:524:355:121:Times:121:Times:B:directors of the newer firms were drawn from the same parts of society as their counterparts in the 
27:885:66138:25:25:89:484:330:121:Times:121:Times:B:older ones, and simply acted to attract investments from more ordinary households.  This 
27:886:66227:25:26:89:514:305:121:Times:121:Times:B:possibility is investigated in panel (e) of the figure, which compares the wealth and status of the 
27:887:66327:26:25:89:501:279:121:Times:121:Times:B:directors of corporations of different vintages, for the 44 corporations for which both a list of 
27:888:66425:25:25:89:523:254:121:Times:121:Times:B:directors and a stockholder list could be found.  As the panel makes clear, the contrast in the level 
27:889:66527:25:26:89:516:229:121:Times:121:Times:B:of wealth of directors of newer and older corporations was even more dramatic than the contrast 
27:890:66623:26:25:89:513:203:121:Times:121:Times:B:in the level of wealth of the shareholders.  Older corporations were managed by much wealthier

27:892:66813:25:26:89:366:153:121:Times:121:Times:B:much less likely to be drawn from the city’s elite merchants.46

28:940:67649:25:25:125:519:235:121:Times:121:Times:A:Did the charters of the newer corporations contain provisions that made an investment in 
28:941:67738:25:26:90:520:210:121:Times:121:Times:B:their shares more attractive to small investors?  Figure 5 plots several firm characteristics by year 
28:942:67840:26:25:90:508:184:121:Times:121:Times:B:of incorporation.    Panel (a) presents the average par value of the shares of corporations.  This 
28:943:67939:25:25:90:495:159:121:Times:121:Times:B:falls dramatically, from about $200 to about $50 by 1814-16, and remains roughly constant 
28:944:68029:25:25:90:505:134:121:Times:121:Times:B:subsequently.  Although lower par values would likely have made the shares more liquid, and 
28:945:68121:25:26:90:522:109:121:Times:121:Times:B:thus more attractive to any investor, this effect would probably be greatest for an investor making 
28:946:68221:26:0:90:519:83:121:Times:121:Times:B:a small investment.  Thus it probably made the shares more accessible and appealing to investors 
29:947:68321:0:25:90:512:709:121:Times:121:Times:B:of limited wealth.  Larger firms seeking to raise significant amounts of capital from subscribers 
29:948:68419:25:25:90:513:684:121:Times:121:Times:B:might have been forced appeal to small shareholders, and panel (b) plots the average capital per 
29:949:68516:25:26:89:523:659:121:Times:121:Times:B:corporation over the period.  This is actually decreasing, with brief increase in the 1811-13 period 
29:950:68617:26:25:90:517:633:121:Times:121:Times:B:when the state chartered several enormous banks in the aftermath of the expiration of the charter 
29:951:68715:25:25:90:517:608:121:Times:121:Times:B:of the First Bank of the United States.  Panel (d) plots the location of the corporations, measured 
29:952:68815:25:25:90:499:583:121:Times:121:Times:B:as the percentage (weighted by capital) located in New York’s First Ward.  This is gradually 
29:953:68908:25:26:90:494:558:121:Times:121:Times:B:decreasing over time, as newer corporations increasingly located in the city’s upper wards.  
29:954:69001:26:25:90:495:532:121:Times:121:Times:B:Finally, panel (c) plots the percentage of corporations whose charters imposed a “graduated 
29:955:69093:25:25:89:493:507:121:Times:121:Times:B:voting rights” scheme, in which the votes per share to which an investor was entitled was a 
29:956:69185:25:26:89:493:482:121:Times:121:Times:B:decreasing function of the number of shares that investor held (see Hilt, 2008 for a detailed 
29:957:69279:26:25:89:518:456:121:Times:121:Times:B:discussion.)  These measures were commonly imposed in early corporations, as a mechanism for 
29:958:69372:25:25:89:480:431:121:Times:121:Times:B:protecting small investors.  They became increasingly uncommon over time, however.47 
29:959:69456:25:25:126:510:406:121:Times:121:Times:A:In sum, in 1826 the investors and directors in the city’s newest corporations were quite 
29:960:69545:25:26:89:491:381:121:Times:121:Times:B:different than those of the city’s older corporations.  This could have been due to efforts to 
29:961:69640:26:25:89:472:355:121:Times:121:Times:B:configure newer corporations’ charters in a way that made them appealing to non-elite 
29:962:69726:25:25:89:516:330:121:Times:121:Times:B:stockholders, to efforts market the shares to ordinary households, or simply to the persistence of 
29:963:69825:25:26:89:510:305:121:Times:121:Times:B:elite ownership among the older firms. On the other hand, this may have been due to the subtly 
29:964:69920:26:25:89:512:279:121:Times:121:Times:B:changing industrial composition of the firms over time.  Moreover, it is not clear to what extent 
29:965:70018:25:25:89:509:254:121:Times:121:Times:B:the changes were due to changes in the characteristics of the firms, such as the decreases in the 
29:966:70116:25:26:89:513:229:121:Times:121:Times:B:par values, or to other factors such as the political orientation of the government that authorized 
29:967:70216:26:25:89:147:203:121:Times:121:Times:B:the charter.

30:974:70431:0:25:90:194:709:121:Times:121:Times:B:4.1 Regression results 
30:975:70454:25:25:126:503:684:121:Times:121:Times:A:We investigate these issues in greater depth by collapsing the above data down to the 
30:976:70540:25:26:89:508:659:121:Times:121:Times:B:firm level, and performing regressions to analyze the correlates of individual firms’ ownership 
30:977:70636:26:25:89:513:633:121:Times:121:Times:B:structures.  In order to understand the extent to which the changing characteristics of firms over 
30:978:70735:25:25:89:499:608:121:Times:121:Times:B:time explains differences in their ownership structure, we include data on firm locations, par 
30:979:70830:25:25:89:525:583:121:Times:121:Times:B:values, board sizes (sometimes used to expand shareholder representation), capital, and indicators  
30:980:70930:25:26:89:522:558:121:Times:121:Times:B:for whether or not the firm’s shares were traded on the NYSE, whether or not its charter specified 
30:981:71029:26:25:89:505:532:121:Times:121:Times:B:graduated voting rights for its shareholders, and industry fixed effects.  With a time trend also 
30:982:71127:25:25:89:513:507:121:Times:121:Times:B:included in the regressions, these specifications will enable us to investigate the extent to which 
30:983:71227:25:26:89:505:482:121:Times:121:Times:B:the changing characteristics of firms can account for their changing ownership structures over 
30:984:71322:26:25:89:521:456:121:Times:121:Times:B:time.  It is important to note that many of these firm characteristics were endogenously chosen by 
30:985:71421:25:25:89:505:431:121:Times:121:Times:B:incorporators, or as in the case of listing on the NYSE, may even have been influenced by the 
30:986:71515:25:25:89:517:406:121:Times:121:Times:B:ownership structure itself.  Therefore, the estimated correlations can not be interpreted as causal. 
30:987:71616:25:26:89:506:381:121:Times:121:Times:B:Nonetheless, they do shed some light on which characteristics of corporations were correlated 
30:988:71710:26:25:89:280:355:121:Times:121:Times:B:with their changing ownership structures.   
30:989:71754:25:25:126:513:330:121:Times:121:Times:A:Table 8 presents the results of the first of these regressions, for three different measures 
30:990:71847:25:26:89:495:305:121:Times:121:Times:B:of ownership structure:  the percentage of the stock held by artisans, the percentage held by 
30:991:71941:26:25:89:496:279:121:Times:121:Times:B:merchants, and the mean assessed wealth of stockholders.48  The results for all three convey 
30:992:72034:25:25:89:513:254:121:Times:121:Times:B:essentially the same result, which is that the owners of later corporations were lower status, and 
30:993:72133:25:26:89:504:229:121:Times:121:Times:B:less wealthy.  In each of the specifications, the age variable exerts a powerful and statistically 
30:994:72232:26:25:89:516:203:121:Times:121:Times:B:significant effect, even with the corporate characteristics added into the regression as covariates, 
30:995:72333:25:25:89:500:178:121:Times:121:Times:B:indicating that these characteristics can only partly account for the change in ownership over 
30:996:72428:25:26:89:114:153:121:Times:121:Times:B:time.

32:1087:84065:25:26:90:503:309:121:Times:121:Times:B:often held by brokers and speculators, who were classified as merchants.  Another interesting 
32:1088:84159:26:25:90:510:283:121:Times:121:Times:B:correlation is that of graduated voting rights, which do not seem to have much of a relationship 
32:1089:84256:25:25:89:505:258:121:Times:121:Times:B:with the occupational distribution of shareholders, but seem to attract wealthier shareholders.  
32:1090:84353:25:25:89:515:233:121:Times:121:Times:B:This effect is also about the same in size as that of location in the First Ward.  Finally, across all 
32:1091:84456:25:26:90:493:208:121:Times:121:Times:B:specifications, industry clearly matters; transportation and “other industry” firms had much 
32:1092:84549:26:25:89:501:182:121:Times:121:Times:B:wealthier and higher-status investors, even controlling for age and other firm characteristics.  
32:1093:84646:25:25:89:424:157:121:Times:121:Times:B:Likewise, manufacturing firms seemed to attract merchants at a higher rate. 
32:1094:84722:25:26:126:508:132:121:Times:121:Times:A:These results are explored further in table 9, which presents regressions for alternative 
32:1095:84812:26:25:89:517:106:121:Times:121:Times:B:measures of firm ownership.  In the first two columns, regressions analyzing the determinants of 
32:1096:84909:25:0:89:517:81:121:Times:121:Times:B:the percentage of each corporation’s stock held in New York’s upper wards are presented.  Once 
33:1097:85007:0:25:90:513:709:121:Times:121:Times:B:again, the location of the corporation clearly matters.  Corporations in the First Ward had fewer 
33:1098:85105:25:25:90:505:684:121:Times:121:Times:B:shareholders from the upper wards, relative to corporations that were actually located in those 
33:1099:85201:25:26:90:497:659:121:Times:121:Times:B:wards.  This result may be consistent with the behavior of modern investors, who have been 
33:1100:85292:26:25:90:511:633:121:Times:121:Times:B:shown to prefer shares in companies that are familiar (see, for example, Huberman 2001). Or it 
33:1101:85387:25:25:90:466:608:121:Times:121:Times:B:could simply be that the local customers of these firms were also their investors.  But 
33:1102:85475:25:25:90:496:583:121:Times:121:Times:B:interestingly, there is no overall time trend in this variable, and firms with higher par values 
33:1103:85572:25:26:90:510:558:121:Times:121:Times:B:seemed to attract more investors from the upper wards, something which is difficult to explain, 
33:1104:85668:26:25:90:522:532:121:Times:121:Times:B:unless the ownership stakes held in the upper wards were often in single shares or small blocks of 
33:1105:85767:25:25:90:494:507:121:Times:121:Times:B:shares, in which case a higher par value of the shares could marginally increase the amount 
33:1106:85859:25:26:90:523:482:121:Times:121:Times:B:held.49  The mean value of the stake held in the corporations is analyzed in the next two columns.  
33:1107:85959:26:25:89:495:456:121:Times:121:Times:B:This is clearly increasing in the par value per share, which would almost have a mechanical 
33:1108:86051:25:25:89:493:431:121:Times:121:Times:B:relationship with this variable.  But none of the other corporate characteristics seem to help 
33:1109:86146:25:25:89:520:406:121:Times:121:Times:B:explain much of the variation in this variable.  Finally, the determinants of the assessed wealth of 
33:1110:86247:25:26:89:471:381:121:Times:121:Times:B:the directors are investigated in the final two columns.  This is significantly higher for 
33:1111:86338:26:25:89:503:355:121:Times:121:Times:B:corporations located in the First Ward and for corporations with graduated voting rights.  But 
33:1112:86433:25:25:89:515:330:121:Times:121:Times:B:even controlling for the different corporate characteristics, the time trend has a very large effect, 
33:1113:86535:25:26:89:372:305:121:Times:121:Times:B:indicating that older corporations had much wealthier directors. 
33:1114:86600:26:25:89:508:279:121:Times:121:Times:B:  Taken together, these results indicate that only some of the variation in the ownership 
33:1115:86689:25:25:89:519:254:121:Times:121:Times:B:structure of corporations of different ages can be explained by the changing characteristics of the 
33:1116:86789:25:26:89:485:229:121:Times:121:Times:B:companies themselves.  The corporations of the 1820s were created in a more democratic 
33:1117:86876:26:25:89:521:203:121:Times:121:Times:B:economy, by a more democratic government, and their ownership responded in ways that can not 
33:1118:86969:25:25:89:521:178:121:Times:121:Times:B:be fully explained by the provisions written into their charters, and the other characteristics of the 
33:1119:87072:25:26:89:504:153:121:Times:121:Times:B:corporations included in the regressions.  Perhaps other characteristics much more difficult to 
33:1120:87168:26:41:89:493:127:121:Times:121:Times:B:measure, such as the efforts to promote the purchase of shares to particular segments of the 
33:1121:87261:41:8:90:237:86:144:Times:144:Times:C:                                                 
33:1122:87309:8:0:90:511:78:42:Times:100:Times:F:49 This effect is, of course, ambiguous; a larger par value could easily cause a small investor to hold less. 
34:1123:87422:0:25:90:501:709:121:Times:121:Times:B:population, or the reputations of the founders, may also have influenced the ownership of the 
34:1124:87516:25:25:90:119:684:121:Times:121:Times:B:firms.

34:1127:87553:25:25:90:515:608:121:Times:121:Times:B: It is important to note that these results do not in fact indicate that as New York became 
34:1128:87644:25:25:90:512:583:121:Times:121:Times:B:more democratic, potential incorporators from throughout society were able to obtain corporate 
34:1129:87739:25:26:90:520:558:121:Times:121:Times:B:charters as frequently as they wanted, or on the terms they wanted.  Powerful incumbent interests 
34:1130:87837:26:25:89:506:532:121:Times:121:Times:B:may have dictated the terms under which newer corporate charters were granted, and imposed 
34:1131:87928:25:25:89:518:507:121:Times:121:Times:B:conditions on new entrants that prevented them from competing too directly, either for capital or 
34:1132:88026:25:26:89:518:482:121:Times:121:Times:B:in markets for goods and services, with existing firms.  The decision to operate in uptown wards, 
34:1133:88124:26:25:89:518:456:121:Times:121:Times:B:or to make the shares attractive to small investors, may have been imposed on the new firms as a 
34:1134:88221:25:25:89:462:431:121:Times:121:Times:B:condition on their existence.  Indeed, claims that new corporations would operate in 
34:1135:88306:25:25:89:510:406:121:Times:121:Times:B:neighborhoods “remote from the vicinity”50 of Wall Street may have been intended as a pledge 
34:1136:88399:25:26:89:511:381:121:Times:121:Times:B:not to compete with the incumbent firms located there; the requirement to adhere to this pledge 
34:1137:88495:26:25:89:242:355:121:Times:121:Times:B:was sometimes written into law.51 
34:1138:88528:25:25:90:515:330:121:Times:121:Times:B: But the results clearly do indicate that New York granted access to corporate charters to 
34:1139:88618:25:26:90:498:305:121:Times:121:Times:B:increasingly less wealthy and lower-status individuals.  In light of these data, what are we to 
34:1140:88714:26:25:90:502:279:121:Times:121:Times:B:make of the virulent anti-corporate rhetoric of the 1820s and 1830s, in particular when it was 
34:1141:88809:25:25:90:521:254:121:Times:121:Times:B:aimed at stockholders?  In a sense, charges of “aristocracy” may have helped produce the broader 
34:1142:88906:25:26:90:501:229:121:Times:121:Times:B:ownership of New York’s newer corporations in the 1820s, perhaps by pushing legislators to 
34:1143:88997:26:25:90:490:203:121:Times:121:Times:B:grant broader access to charters, or to configure charters in ways intended to appeal to less 
34:1144:89091:25:25:90:508:178:121:Times:121:Times:B:wealthy investors.  As Maier (1993) has noted, the agenda behind anti-corporate agitators may 
34:1145:89185:25:21:90:487:153:121:Times:121:Times:B:have been to influence the design of corporations that got created, rather than to block the 
34:1146:89278:21:8:90:237:132:144:Times:144:Times:C:                                                 
34:1147:89326:8:11:90:293:124:42:Times:100:Times:F:50 New York Senate Documents, 6 February 1822. 
34:1148:89373:11:16:90:504:113:42:Times:100:Times:F:51 For example, Tradesmen’s Bank, incorporated in 1823, stipulates that “the banking house of the said 
34:1149:89476:16:12:90:519:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:incorporation, shall be located in Chatham Square, in the said city, or its immediate vicinity, and not to the 
34:1150:89587:12:11:90:488:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:westward of James-street.”  (Laws of New York, 20 March 1823, ch. 93.)  Chatham Square is at the 
34:1151:89684:11:0:90:266:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:intersection of the Fourth and Sixth Wards. 
35:1152:89731:0:25:90:500:709:121:Times:121:Times:B:creation of corporations, and the data in this paper has shown that they were at least partially 
35:1153:89828:25:25:90:142:684:121:Times:121:Times:B:victorious.  
35:1154:89841:25:26:126:522:659:121:Times:121:Times:A:Other, more conservative critics of corporations witnessed the developments documented 
35:1155:89928:26:25:90:513:633:121:Times:121:Times:B:in this paper with alarm.  Jurist James Kent referred to New York’s profligate grants of charters 
35:1156:90026:25:25:90:488:608:121:Times:121:Times:B:as “improvident” and “evil,” and legislator John King, at New York’s 1821 Constitutional 
35:1157:90115:25:25:90:515:583:121:Times:121:Times:B:Convention, argued they had produced “great public mischief.”52  Both fundamentally respected 
35:1158:90209:25:26:90:514:558:121:Times:121:Times:B:the vested rights of incumbent corporations, and opposed Republican governments’ openness to 
35:1159:90302:26:25:90:492:532:121:Times:121:Times:B:petitions for charters from the ‘less respectable’ orders of society, for fear that the rights of 
35:1160:90400:25:25:90:509:507:121:Times:121:Times:B:existing corporations would be eroded.  Many of the incorporators criticized by Kent and King 
35:1161:90494:25:26:90:517:482:121:Times:121:Times:B:were keenly aware of the erosion of vested privileges created by widespread use of the corporate 
35:1162:90591:26:25:90:519:456:121:Times:121:Times:B:form, and thus offered critiques of corporate powers in order to justify granting broader access to 
35:1163:90691:25:25:90:140:431:121:Times:121:Times:B:charters.53

35:1168:90718:13:25:125:520:355:121:Times:121:Times:A:The proliferation of business corporations in the early nineteenth century exemplifies the 
35:1169:90809:25:25:89:518:330:121:Times:121:Times:B:zeal of early state governments to use the law to promote economic development.   Access to the 
35:1170:90905:25:26:89:517:305:121:Times:121:Times:B:corporate form was expanded over time, and the corporation became a familiar part of economic 
35:1171:90999:26:25:89:519:279:121:Times:121:Times:B:life.  But this paper has shown that within the 35 years between 1791 and 1826, the ownership of 
35:1172:91096:25:25:89:477:254:121:Times:121:Times:B:corporations changed as well.  Whereas in 1791, aristocratic landowners and merchants 
35:1173:91182:25:26:89:506:229:121:Times:121:Times:B:controlled both the state government and the corporations it created, by 1826, political figures 
35:1174:91279:26:25:89:522:203:121:Times:121:Times:B:were no longer important stockholders, and a much broader segment of society participated in the 
35:1175:91376:25:25:89:520:178:121:Times:121:Times:B:creation and ownership of corporations.  Charters were granted for business that operated even in 
35:1176:91474:25:21:89:514:153:121:Times:121:Times:B:the “mechanic” wards of uptown Manhattan, and ownership of shares of stock spread into those 
35:1177:91567:21:8:90:237:132:144:Times:144:Times:C:                                                 
35:1178:91615:8:16:90:508:124:42:Times:100:Times:F:52 Kent (1827 II: 219), and New York (1821: 446).  Both men were stockholders, and in fact Kent was a 
35:1179:91717:16:7:90:510:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:stockholder in one of the very institutions he criticized the legislature for incorporating, Chemical Bank. 
35:1180:91825:7:16:90:515:101:42:Times:100:Times:F:53 Arguing for a bank charter, one incorporator wrote “In proportion as the legislature extends a privilege, 
35:1181:91934:16:11:90:507:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:in that proportion the monopoly which grows out of its exclusive enjoyment is diminished.”  New York

36:1183:92073:0:25:90:519:709:121:Times:121:Times:B:neighborhoods as well.    To be sure, the elite merchants who dominated commerce in New York 
36:1184:92166:25:25:90:500:684:121:Times:121:Times:B:also held the majority of corporate stock; when measured as a percentage of total capital, the 
36:1185:92261:25:26:90:516:659:121:Times:121:Times:B:stockholdings of artisans and those of modest wealth were relatively small.  But at least some of 
36:1186:92359:26:25:90:509:633:121:Times:121:Times:B:the new enterprises incorporated in the 1820s were created to be owned, and managed, by men 
36:1187:92451:25:25:90:516:608:121:Times:121:Times:B:who lacked the pedigree and wealth of the prominent merchants who controlled the older, better-
36:1188:92546:25:25:89:508:583:121:Times:121:Times:B:established corporations in the city.  Engerman and Sokoloff (2002) have argued that the rapid 
36:1189:92641:25:26:89:497:558:121:Times:121:Times:B:economic growth of the period was associated with an institutional evolution that facilitated 
36:1190:92735:26:25:89:488:532:121:Times:121:Times:B:broader access to economic opportunity; the results presented here represent a noteworthy 
36:1191:92825:25:25:89:198:507:121:Times:121:Times:B:example of this process. 
36:1192:92850:25:26:126:523:482:121:Times:121:Times:A:The liberal use of the corporate form in the 1820s was not the same as free or open access 
36:1193:92941:26:25:90:520:456:121:Times:121:Times:B:to incorporation.  Petitions for charters in some industries remained highly contentious, and often 
36:1194:93041:25:25:90:504:431:121:Times:121:Times:B:failed, as incumbent firms and their allies worked against the creation of firms that threatened 
36:1195:93138:25:25:90:520:406:121:Times:121:Times:B:their interests. In the legislature, intense lobbying, “log-rolling” strategies, and even bribery were 
36:1196:93241:25:26:90:476:381:121:Times:121:Times:B:all part of the politics of chartering.  The dramatic change marked by the era of broader 
36:1197:93331:26:25:90:506:355:121:Times:121:Times:B:participation in politics was that political figures supported by mechanics and tradesmen were 
36:1198:93426:25:25:90:478:330:121:Times:121:Times:B:able to successfully compete within this legislative environment, and managed to create 
36:1199:93514:25:26:90:523:305:121:Times:121:Times:B:corporations that were quite different from those of earlier generations.  There was certainly a fair 
36:1200:93616:26:25:90:513:279:121:Times:121:Times:B:measure of cynicism in these efforts, and the creation of the “Tradesmen’s Bank” should not be 
36:1201:93711:25:25:90:523:254:121:Times:121:Times:B:confused with an altruistic effort to benefit tradesmen.  Nonetheless, the results of this paper have 
36:1202:93813:25:26:90:519:229:121:Times:121:Times:B:shown that the corporations created in the 1820s were in fact managed and owned by men of less 
36:1203:93908:26:25:90:352:203:121:Times:121:Times:B:wealth and lower status than those created in earlier eras.

37:1211:94088:11:12:90:521:674:100:Times:100:Times:F:York and the New York Manufacturing Society, have been published.  The list of stockholder for the Bank 
37:1212:94192:12:11:90:502:662:100:Times:100:Times:F:of New York in 1791 is in Nevins (1934), and the list of stockholders of the New York Manufacturing 
37:1213:94291:11:12:89:496:651:100:Times:100:Times:F:Society is printed in the New York Daily Advertiser, 17 March 1789. The Manufacturing Society list 
37:1214:94390:12:11:89:523:639:100:Times:100:Times:F:unfortunately does not include the number of shares held by each investor. These names were then matched 
37:1215:94495:11:12:90:479:628:100:Times:100:Times:F:to the Federal Census of 1790 to obtain information on slave holdings, and to the city’s 1789 tax 
37:1216:94593:12:11:90:490:616:100:Times:100:Times:F:assessment list. The names were also matched to the 1791 New York Directory and Register, which 
37:1217:94689:11:12:90:516:605:100:Times:100:Times:F:provided addresses and occupations. In 1791 there were 343 unique shareholders. The Bank of New York 
37:1218:94790:12:11:90:512:593:100:Times:100:Times:F:had 190 stockholders and the New York Manufacturing Society had 186; 33 individuals owned both.  Of 
37:1219:94890:11:12:90:515:582:100:Times:100:Times:F:the 343 shareholders, 300 likely resided in New York City, and of these, 262 could be uniquely identified 
37:1220:94996:12:11:90:484:570:100:Times:100:Times:F:in the directory.  A random sample of approximately 15% of households was taken from the 1791 
37:1221:95090:11:12:90:514:559:100:Times:100:Times:F:directory, by recording all of the entries on every sixth page, which yielded 776 out of 4,752 total entries, 
37:1222:95200:12:11:90:522:547:100:Times:100:Times:F:or 16.33%.  These were then also matched to the 1790 Federal Census, and to the 1789 tax assessment list.  
37:1223:95307:11:12:90:519:536:100:Times:100:Times:F:In order to calculate stockholding rates in individual wards, the 38 New York City stockholders who could 
37:1224:95413:12:11:90:509:524:100:Times:100:Times:F:not be uniquely identified in the directory (usually because there was more than one entry with the same 
37:1225:95518:11:12:90:513:513:100:Times:100:Times:F:name) were allocated to the different wards at the same rates as the stockholders who could be identified.

37:1227:95625:11:12:90:512:490:100:Times:100:Times:F:In addition to the two corporations, the 1791 New York City directory lists an unincorporated joint-stock 
37:1228:95731:12:11:90:499:478:100:Times:100:Times:F:insurance company in operation, the Mutual Assurance Society, which would become incorporated in 
37:1229:95828:11:12:90:517:467:100:Times:100:Times:F:1798.  No list of investors from this period survives, but eleven of the twelve directors of the Society were 
37:1230:95938:12:11:90:522:455:100:Times:100:Times:F:stockholders in one or both of New York’s corporations, and four of the twelve were directors in one of the 
37:1231:96046:11:12:90:515:444:100:Times:100:Times:F:corporations.  It is quite likely that the ownership of this third enterprise was substantially the same as the 
37:1232:96158:12:11:90:491:432:100:Times:100:Times:F:two incorporated firms.  Also Davis (1917 II: 260) mentions an unincorporated New York City iron 
37:1233:96255:11:12:90:500:421:100:Times:100:Times:F:company that received some corporate privileges from the state in 1786, but probably never went into 
37:1234:96356:12:11:90:133:409:100:Times:100:Times:F:operation.

37:1237:96471:11:12:90:517:375:100:Times:100:Times:F:State Archives in various record groups associated with the comptroller's office, including A0833, A0829, 
37:1238:96577:12:11:90:515:363:100:Times:100:Times:F:and A0847. These lists were submitted to the comptroller pursuant to the New York State tax of 1823-28, 
37:1239:96681:11:12:90:504:352:100:Times:100:Times:F:which exempted individuals’ stock holdings from personal taxation, instead collecting taxes on paid-in 
37:1240:96784:12:11:90:511:340:100:Times:100:Times:F:capital from the corporations themselves. Under this tax, corporations were required to submit the name, 
37:1241:96889:11:12:90:488:329:100:Times:100:Times:F:place of residence, and number of shares owned by each stockholder to the state comptroller so the 
37:1242:96988:12:11:90:510:317:100:Times:100:Times:F:revenues could be distributed to county governments. Of the 242 corporations in operation in New York 
37:1243:97090:11:12:90:524:306:100:Times:100:Times:F:State in 1826, these lists survive for 133. This sample includes $26.3 million of the $48 million total paid-in 
37:1244:97202:12:11:90:514:294:100:Times:100:Times:F:capital in the state and $19.1 million of the $34.8 million incorporated capital held in New York City. All 
37:1245:97310:11:12:90:409:283:100:Times:100:Times:F:available information was transcribed for each shareholder from all these lists.

37:1248:97487:12:11:90:514:248:100:Times:100:Times:F:Register, and City Directory (1826) to determine the address and occupation of shareholders who lived in 
37:1249:97592:11:12:90:505:237:100:Times:100:Times:F:New York City.  The directory includes “the names, occupations, and place of residence of all heads of

37:1251:97802:11:12:90:488:214:100:Times:100:Times:F:included many prominent figures such as John Jacob Astor and Nathaniel Prime, were classified as 
37:1252:97899:12:11:90:524:202:100:Times:100:Times:F:merchants. We then located the addresses on contemporary maps, particularly W. Hooker’s Plan of the City 
37:1253:98004:11:12:90:476:191:100:Times:100:Times:F:of New York (1825) and S. Marks’ A New Map of the City of New York, Comprising all the Late 
37:1254:98096:12:11:90:474:179:100:Times:100:Times:F:Improvements (1827), in order to identify the ward within which the stockholder resided.  Most 
37:1255:98191:11:12:90:504:168:100:Times:100:Times:F:stockholders had only one address listed, but some had two addresses.  The tabulations in the paper are 
37:1256:98295:12:11:90:247:156:100:Times:100:Times:F:based on primary business addresses.

37:1258:98334:12:11:90:518:133:100:Times:100:Times:F:With the address we were able to look up each shareholder within the city’s tax assessment records, which 
37:1259:98440:11:12:90:518:122:100:Times:100:Times:F:survive in the New York Municipal Archives, to determine the assessed value of real and personal wealth, 
37:1260:98545:12:11:90:507:110:100:Times:100:Times:F:which were combined to calculate total assessed wealth. Real and personal property assessed at primary 
37:1261:98648:11:12:90:513:99:100:Times:100:Times:F:and secondary addresses were recorded, but any real estate holdings not corresponding to a listed address 
37:1262:98754:12:0:90:516:87:100:Times:100:Times:F:could not be included:  there is no index to the assessment lists.  Stockholdings were not included in these 
38:1263:98866:0:11:90:518:710:100:Times:100:Times:F:assessments, because the 1823-28 tax law required the corporation, rather than the stockholders, to pay the

38:1267:99075:12:11:90:518:664:100:Times:100:Times:F:stockholders, 6,019 of which were individuals or partnerships and 2,999 of those were listed as residing in 
38:1268:99183:11:12:90:418:653:100:Times:100:Times:F:New York City, of which 1,743 could be uniquely identified in the city directory.

38:1271:99368:12:11:90:516:618:100:Times:100:Times:F:sample was taken by entering every tenth page of the directory. The 1826 sample had 2,798 out of 27,500
