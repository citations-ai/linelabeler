2:33:1917:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:Recent research suggests that parental job loss has negative effects on children's outcomes, including
2:34:2019:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:their academic achievement and long-run educational and labor market outcomes. In this paper we
2:35:2114:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:turn our attention to the effects of parental job loss on children's health. We combine health data from
2:36:2218:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:16 waves of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, which allows us to use a fixed effects specification
2:37:2320:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:and still have a large sample of parental job displacements. We find that paternal job loss is detrimental
2:38:2426:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:to the physical and mental health of children in low-socioeconomic status (SES) families, increasing
2:39:2526:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:their incidence of injuries and mental disorders. We separately find that maternal job loss leads to
2:40:2626:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:reductions in the incidence of infectious illness among children in high-SES families, possibly resulting
2:41:2731:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:from substitution of maternal care for market-based childcare services. Increases in public health insurance
2:42:2839:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:C:coverage compensate for a large share of the loss in private coverage that follows parental displacement,
2:43:2944:14:42:72:421:448:12:Times:12:Times:C:and we find no significant changes in routine or diagnostic medical care.

3:57:3297:0:36:72:166:708:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:1  Introduction
3:58:3312:36:24:89:539:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:During the Great Recession, millions of American workers lost jobs as firms restructured,
3:59:3401:24:24:72:540:648:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:relocated, downsized, and closed in response to changing demand conditions.  From January
3:60:3490:24:24:72:540:624:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:2007 through December 2009—a period encompassing the official beginning and end of the
3:61:3576:24:24:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:recession—nearly one in six US workers experienced job displacement (Farber, 2011).  Not
3:62:3664:24:24:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:only  was  the  rate  of  job  loss  significantly  higher  during  this  period  than  during  previous
3:63:3768:24:24:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:postwar recessions, the rate of reemployment was lower and the average duration of unem-
3:64:3856:24:24:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ployment was longer.  The severity of the recent economic downturn has generated renewed
3:65:3944:24:23:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:interest  among  researchers  in  the  consequences  of  job  displacement  for  workers  and  their
3:66:4044:23:24:72:114:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:families.
3:67:4053:24:24:89:539:457:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Though a substantial literature documents the effects of displacement on outcomes such
3:68:4139:24:24:72:540:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:as earnings, employment, health, and fertility for displaced workers, less is known about the
3:69:4232:24:24:72:540:409:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:consequences  of  displacement  for  another  group  of  potential  victims—the  children  of  dis-
3:70:4331:24:24:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:placed workers.  Given that job displacement causes changes in family income, parental time
3:71:4422:24:24:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:use, and the physical and mental wellbeing of parents, it is likely to alter family dynamics
3:72:4514:24:24:72:540:337:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and affect parental investments in children.  Recent studies of the effects of job displacement
3:73:4609:24:24:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on children’s academic outcomes suggest that this is the case, finding that parental job loss is
3:74:4705:24:24:72:540:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:associated with increased likelihood of grade repetition and worse performance on standard-
3:75:4796:24:24:72:540:265:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ized tests (Ananat et al., 2011; Stevens and Schaller, 2009).  Parental job loss has also been
3:76:4890:24:23:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:found to have long-run effects on children in low-income families, reducing their educational
3:77:4983:23:24:72:540:218:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:attainment and earnings in adulthood (Oreopolous et al., 2008; Page et al., 2009).  However,
3:78:5075:24:24:72:540:194:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the mechanisms by which parental job loss translates into worse outcomes for children in the
3:79:5167:24:24:72:296:170:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:short and long run are not well understood.
3:80:5210:24:24:89:539:146:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In  this  paper,  we  turn  our  attention  to  the  effects  of  parental  job  loss  on  children’s
3:81:5311:24:24:72:540:122:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:physical and mental health.  While previous work has shown that job loss is associated with
3:82:5402:24:18:72:540:98:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:increased mortality and worse physical and mental health among adults,1only a few papers
3:83:5490:18:0:85:539:80:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:1See, for example, Browning and Heinesen, 2012; Schaller and Stevens, 2015; Sullivan and von Wachter,
4:84:5592:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:have  examined  the  effects  of  parental  job  loss  on  children’s  health  and  none  have  looked
4:85:5694:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:at the effects of parental job loss on a broad set of health outcomes.2Child health is an
4:86:5783:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:important outcome because it is both an indicator of current welfare and a predictor of future
4:87:5877:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:outcomes including adult health, educational attainment, and earnings, and thus a potential
4:88:5968:24:24:72:505:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of economic shocks (Currie, 2009).
4:89:6051:24:24:89:539:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:As parental job loss is likely to affect a number of important inputs to child health, the
4:90:6141:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:predicted effects are unclear a priori.  On one hand, a negative income shock may lead to
4:91:6230:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reductions in medical care utilization and other health investments.  On the other hand, an
4:92:6321:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:unanticipated period of unemployment may allow parents to take their children to the doctor
4:93:6412:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:more often or cause them to substitute parental care for market-based childcare, which may
4:94:6502:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:lead  to  changes  in  the  quality  of  care  and  reduce  exposure  to  contagious  illness.   Along
4:95:6604:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:these lines, the medical literature documents a correlation between daycare attendance and
4:96:6694:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:infectious illness (see,  for example,  Beijers et al.,  2011;  Bradley,  2003;  Hardy and Fowler,
4:97:6792:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:1993)  and  previous  research  in  economics  has  produced  evidence  of  deleterious  effects  of
4:98:6892:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:maternal employment on child health (Gennetian et al., 2010; Ruhm, 2000; Morrill, 2011).
4:99:6980:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Other mechanisms are also possible.  For example, a number of studies have found negative
4:100:7069:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effects of job displacement on outcomes related to adult mental health (for example, Brand
4:101:7159:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:et al., 2008; Browning and Heinesen, 2012; Schaller and Stevens, 2015), which might have
4:102:7247:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:direct or indirect effects on children’s health.  Additionally, changes in insurance status or
4:103:7341:24:24:72:500:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the source of insurance coverage may alter the cost and availability of medical care.
4:104:7426:24:24:89:539:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In this study, we exploit unique data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)
4:105:7512:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that allow us to examine the reduced-form effects of parental job displacement on several
4:106:7601:23:24:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:different measures of child health and mental health and to investigate potential mechanisms
4:107:7693:24:22:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:behind these effects.  The MEPS is a large-scale representative survey that collects detailed

4:109:7790:8:16:85:539:128:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:2To  our  knowledge  there  are  only  three  existing  papers  on  the  topic:  Liu  and  Zhao  (2014)  study  the
4:110:7905:16:12:72:540:112:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:effects  of  mass  layoffs  on  child  height  and  weight  in  China,  Mork  et  al.   (2013)  look  at  the  correlation
4:111:8027:12:12:72:540:100:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:between  parental  unemployment  and  children’s  hospital  stays  in  Sweden,  and  Lindo  (2011)  studies  the
4:112:8139:12:0:72:334:88:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:effects of parental job loss on health at birth using US data.
5:113:8202:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:information on health outcomes, health insurance coverage, and health care utilization for
5:114:8292:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:families over a two-year period.  To study the causal effects of parental job loss on children’s
5:115:8388:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:health,  we  use  a  large  sample  of  children  with  displaced  parents  by  combining  data  from
5:116:8489:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:16 waves of the MEPS covering the period from 1996 through 2012.  To limit the effects of
5:117:8578:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:endogenous selection and omitted variables bias, we focus on job losses that are plausibly
5:118:8668:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:exogenous, including only layoffs, job endings, and business closures, and include child fixed
5:119:8762:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effects  in  our  main  specification  so  that  our  estimates  are  identified  by  changes  in  health
5:120:8867:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:status after displacement for a given child rather than comparisons between the children of
5:121:8958:24:24:72:400:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:displaced workers and children of continually employed workers.
5:122:9021:24:24:89:539:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Our results show that both paternal and maternal job loss result in reductions in parent

5:124:9205:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:children’s incidence of anxiety and depression and we see increases in the incidence of injuries
5:125:9301:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:following paternal job loss in low-SES families.  By contrast, maternal job loss in high-SES
5:126:9393:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:families reduces children’s incidence of infectious illness.  Though the point estimates change
5:127:9488:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:across specifications, these patterns are robust to limiting the definition of job loss to include
5:128:9586:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:only firm closures and are generally stronger when we limit the sample to the children of
5:129:9675:24:24:72:443:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:workers who are more securely attached to the labor market at baseline.

5:131:9835:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:care utilization,  we find a small but statistically significant reduction in private insurance
5:132:9930:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:coverage in the period prior to paternal job loss, which is not surprising in light of previous
5:133:10025:24:24:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:work showing that male earnings begin to fall prior to displacement (e.g. Jacobson, Lalonde,
5:134:10117:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and  Sullivan,  1993).   After  job  loss  occurs,  increases  in  public  insurance  coverage  largely

5:136:10315:24:24:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dren’s insurance coverage after displacement is much smaller than corresponding estimates
5:137:10404:24:24:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for adults (see Schaller and Stevens, 2015).  We find no significant effects on children’s use
5:138:10498:24:24:72:540:110:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of routine or diagnostic medical care.  We do see evidence, however, of increases in mental
5:139:10589:24:0:72:540:86:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:health visits after paternal job loss and reductions in prescription drug use after maternal

6:141:10691:24:24:89:539:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Taken as a whole,  our results suggest that, particularly in low-SES families,  children’s
6:142:10781:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:health is vulnerable to the stress associated with paternal job loss.  This finding can poten-
6:143:10875:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tially help to explain the long-term effects of paternal displacement on education and labor

6:145:11055:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(2008).   Among  children  in  more-advantaged  families,  the  negative  effects  of  paternal  job
6:146:11155:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:loss are weak or nonexistent, and our results suggest that the substitution of parental care
6:147:11247:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for market-based childcare following maternal job loss in families that can afford to do so
6:148:11338:24:41:72:376:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:may actually be beneficial for child health in the short-run.
6:149:11399:41:36:72:231:475:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:2  Theoretical background
6:150:11424:36:23:89:539:439:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In the standard model of child health production in economics (Grossman, 2000; Currie,
6:151:11510:23:24:72:540:416:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:2009), parents are assumed to maximize an inter-temporal utility function whose arguments
6:152:11599:24:24:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in  each  period  are  the  stock  of  child  health,  the  consumption  of  other  commodities,  and
6:153:11700:24:24:72:540:368:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:leisure.  The health stock in any given period is a function of the health stock of the previous
6:154:11796:24:24:72:540:344:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:period, its depreciation rate, and the health investments made in the previous period.  The
6:155:11887:24:24:72:540:320:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:health production function depends on both exogenous productivity shifters and permanent
6:156:11975:24:24:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:individual productivity shifters.  Finally, the investment inputs in this production function
6:157:12068:24:24:72:445:272:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:include material inputs (including health care) and parental time inputs.
6:158:12141:24:24:89:539:248:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Within this framework, there are a few ways in which parental job loss can affect a child’s
6:159:12232:24:24:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:health stock.  First, the reduction in income associated with job loss can affect consumption
6:160:12325:24:24:72:540:200:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and health investments, such as nutritious food, preventive health care, and the practice of
6:161:12417:24:23:72:540:176:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:physical exercise.  Second, the loss of a job can cause the loss of employer-provided health
6:162:12509:23:24:72:540:153:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:insurance for the worker and his/her dependents.  This will affect both the price and the
6:163:12598:24:24:72:540:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:quality of available health care and may lead to reduced use of health care, especially related
6:164:12693:24:24:72:540:105:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to preventive care, treatment of chronic conditions, and purchase of prescription drugs.  For
6:165:12786:24:0:72:540:81:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:children,  however,  the  effects  of  job  loss  on  health  insurance  coverage  may  be  mediated
7:166:12887:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by the availability of the other parent’s employer-provided health insurance, as well as the
7:167:12979:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:availability and take-up of public health insurance programs such as Medicaid and the State
7:168:13070:24:24:72:316:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).
7:169:13114:24:24:89:539:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Job loss may also change the availability of parental time and its allocation towards child
7:170:13205:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:health production, especially in the short run.  A parent who recently lost a job may spend
7:171:13296:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:more  time  caring  for  the  child,  increasing  non-market  time  inputs  to  health  production,
7:172:13395:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:which  may  also  increase  the  amount  of  health  care  received  by  the  child  (doctor  visits,
7:173:13496:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for example).  Additionally, increased availability of parental time, combined with a reduced
7:174:13589:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:income, may cause children to spend less time in daycare, preschool, or after-school activities,
7:175:13685:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:which may reduce their exposure to illness or change their likelihood of incurring injuries.
7:176:13777:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:A final avenue by which parental job loss might lead to changes in child health is increased
7:177:13869:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:parental stress caused by job loss and the associated income shock.  Parental stress might
7:178:13959:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:affect  child  health  directly  by  causing  children  to  experience  more  stress  themselves  or  it
7:179:14063:24:24:72:342:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:might affect the quality of care that children receive.
7:180:14118:24:24:89:539:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The  many  potential  mechanisms  discussed  above  make  it  unclear  whether  we  should
7:181:14208:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:expect job loss to lead to improvement or deterioration in child health on average.  We can,
7:182:14300:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:however, make predictions about how these effects might vary depending on parent, child,
7:183:14388:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and family characteristics.  For one thing, the effects of job loss are likely to depend on the
7:184:14483:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:gender of the displaced parent.  Research in psychology and sociology suggests that the stress
7:185:14577:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effects  of  job  loss  are  typically  greater  when  fathers  experience  involuntary  displacement.
7:186:14679:24:24:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This is partly because male job loss often results in a larger shock to family income,  but
7:187:14770:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:has  also  been  attributed  to  a  cultural  emphasis  on  the  role  of  the  father  as  breadwinner.
7:188:14874:23:24:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Meanwhile,  maternal  job  loss  may  be  more  likely  to  result  in  increased  time  spent  with
7:189:14974:24:24:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:children, as women are more likely to take on home-production and caregiving roles during
7:190:15063:24:24:72:333:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:periods of joblessness (Kalil and Ziol-Guest, 2008).
7:191:15115:24:24:89:539:110:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Another dimension along which the effects of parental displacement may be heterogeneous
7:192:15202:24:0:72:540:86:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is child age.  Though this type of heterogeneity is difficult to characterize a priori, one point is
8:193:15303:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:worth noting:  with outcomes such as infectious illness, for which changes in time use are an
8:194:15396:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:important mechanism, it is possible that the effects will be more pronounced among children
8:195:15487:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:who are not yet school-aged.  At the same time,  any differences across age groups will be
8:196:15577:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:muted if young children are exposed to infectious illness through parents or older siblings
8:197:15668:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(or vice versa), or if older children are also changing their time use (for example, reducing
8:198:15761:24:24:72:512:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:participation in after-school care or extra-curricular activities) in response to job loss.
8:199:15852:24:24:89:539:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Other important sources of potential heterogeneity in the effects of fathers’ and mothers’
8:200:15942:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:job  losses  include  the  number  of  earners  in  the  family,  parental  educational  attainment,
8:201:16042:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:family earnings,  and the contribution of the displaced worker’s earnings to family income
8:202:16132:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:prior to job loss.  Single-earner families, and those with less education or lower income may
8:203:16225:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:experience more stress upon job loss and are likely to have fewer resources with which to
8:204:16314:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:moderate  shocks  to  earnings  and  insurance  coverage.   Meanwhile,  the  displacement  of  a
8:205:16410:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:secondary earner in a family with high socioeconomic status may be less disruptive,  both

9:231:18740:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:firms in China following the reforms initiated in the 1990s.  They find that the father’s job
9:232:18833:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:loss has a large negative impact on height and weight of children, whereas they don’t find
9:233:18923:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:evidence of an effect of mother’s job loss.  Mork et al. (2013) look at the effect of parental
9:234:19017:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:unemployment on child health outcomes using administrative data from Sweden.  They find
9:235:19104:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that children with unemployed parents are 1 percent more likely to be hospitalized in the
9:236:19193:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:same year as the job loss, and 5 percent more likely in the long run.  However, due to data
9:237:19284:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:limitations  they  are  not  able  to  separately  identify  the  effects  of  plausibly  exogenous  job
9:238:19388:24:24:72:277:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:displacement from all causes of job loss.
9:239:19429:24:24:89:539:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The evidence on the effects of job displacement on adult health is more abundant.  Our
9:240:19515:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:paper is closest in methods to Schaller and Stevens (2015).  Using data from the MEPS, they
9:241:19606:24:24:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:look at the effect of involuntary job loss on a worker’s health outcomes in the short-run. They
9:242:19701:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:find that job loss has substantial negative effects on mental health and that it increases the
9:243:19795:23:24:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:likelihood of activity limitations and fair or poor self-reported physical health.  However, they
9:244:19892:24:24:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:find no effects on the likelihood of reporting a number of specific chronic health conditions,
9:245:19986:24:24:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:including arthritis, diabetes, high cholesterol, and hypertension, and they find reductions in
9:246:20080:24:24:72:540:110:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the incidence of infectious illness among adults after job loss.  Other papers that look at job
9:247:20175:24:0:72:540:86:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:displacement and adult health have found significant effects on adult mortality, suicide risk,
10:248:20270:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cardiovascular health, risky behaviors such as alcohol abuse and smoking, traffic accidents
10:249:20361:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and mental illness (Sullivan and Von Wachter, 2009;  Deb et al., 2011;  Classen and Dunn,
10:250:20450:24:24:72:358:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:2012; Browning and Heinesen, 2012; Black et al., 2012).
10:251:20505:24:24:89:539:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:A  second  strand  of  literature  related  to  this  paper  is  that  on  the  stability  of  health
10:252:20606:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:insurance  coverage  and  the  effects  of  unemployment  on  access  to  health  care.   The  loss
10:253:20705:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of  insurance  coverage  following  displacement  could  potentially  lead  directly  to  changes  in
10:254:20806:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:health  status  if  it  causes  individuals  to  reduce  their  utilization  of  medical  care.   Among
10:255:20909:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:adults,  Gruber  and  Madrian  (1997)  find  that  job  separations  (including  both  layoffs  and
10:256:21008:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:quits) have a large impact on the probability of having any insurance.  Schaller and Stevens
10:257:21100:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(2015) also find significant effects of involuntary job loss on insurance coverage in their study
10:258:21197:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of adults in the MEPS: a 10 percentage point reduction in insurance coverage following job
10:259:21287:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:loss among the full adult sample, and a 26 percentage point reduction in coverage among
10:260:21374:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:workers  that  were  insured  through  their  employer  prior  to  displacement.   They  also  find
10:261:21473:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:negative  effects  on  health  care  utilization  among  workers  who  were  insured  through  their
10:262:21573:24:24:72:234:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:employer prior to displacement.
10:263:21604:24:24:89:539:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:For children, the effects of job loss on health insurance coverage are likely to be smaller
10:264:21695:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:than those for adults.  While a majority of both adults and children are insured through an
10:265:21786:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:employer-provided policy,4there have been large expansions in the eligibility of children for
10:266:21879:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:public health insurance. Publicly provided child health insurance has the potential to insulate
10:267:21974:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:children from the consequences of job instability.  Cawley and Simon (2005) and Cawley et
10:268:22063:24:24:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:al. (2013) study the effects of state unemployment rates on health insurance coverage for
10:269:22152:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:both adults and children, and find that an increase in the unemployment rate significantly
10:270:22242:23:24:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:decreases the probability of being insured for men,  but not for women and children,  who
10:271:22331:24:24:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:they argue are relatively insulated from these fluctuations due to public insurance policies.
10:272:22424:24:24:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:To  our  knowledge,  the  only  paper  that  looks  at  the  effects  of  parental  job  loss  on  child
10:273:22528:24:19:72:540:110:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:health insurance coverage is that of Fairbrother et al. (2010), which finds large increases in
10:274:22622:19:15:85:539:91:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:4In our sample, 62% of children whose parents were employed in the first round of the panel had employer-

11:277:22846:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:However, the authors categorize any job separation as a job loss, and they do not control
11:278:22935:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for unobserved characteristics that may be correlated with both a job separation and loss of
11:279:23027:24:24:72:123:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:insurance.
11:280:23037:24:24:89:539:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Finally,  as job displacement constitutes an arguably exogenous shock to both employ-
11:281:23122:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ment and income, studying its effects on child health can provide insight into the nature of
11:282:23214:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the causal effects of parental employment and family income on child health.  With regard
11:283:23303:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to  employment  status,  existing  research  has  documented  negative  effects  of  maternal  em-
11:284:23401:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ployment on child health outcomes (see, for example, Gennetian et al., 2010; Ruhm, 2000;
11:285:23489:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Morrill, 2011), though none have used job displacement as a source of identifying variation.
11:286:23581:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:With regard to income, though there is well documented evidence of a positive cross-sectional
11:287:23674:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:correlation between family income and child health (Currie, 2009 provides a review of these
11:288:23765:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:studies), it has proven difficult to identify causal effects.  It could be that unobserved char-

11:292:24127:24:24:89:539:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In our paper we are able to build significantly on the existing literature by using a dataset
11:293:24220:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that allows us to (i) identify plausibly exogenous sources of job separation, (ii) link parents
11:294:24315:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to their children and follow them over several survey waves, (iii) obtain information on health

11:299:24709:16:16:85:539:166:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:5Conley and Bennett (2000, 2001) use mother fixed effects and find that income at time of birth does
11:300:24809:16:11:72:540:150:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:not have a significant effect on birth-weight in general, but they do find effects for children whose mothers
11:301:24918:11:12:72:540:139:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:had low birth-weight themselves.  A caveat of these papers is that the data they use from the PSID has a
11:302:25022:12:12:72:540:127:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:relatively small sample.  Hoynes et al. (2013) exploit variations caused by tax reforms in the generosity of
11:303:25130:12:12:72:540:115:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:the federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) as a source of exogenous variations in family income.  They
11:304:25233:12:12:72:540:103:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:find that an increase in the EITC income increases the mean birth-weight and reduces the incidence of low
11:305:25338:12:12:72:540:91:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:birth-weight.   They  also  find  that  it  increases  the  use  of  prenatal  care  and  reduces  smoking  by  pregnant

12:308:25473:36:24:89:539:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We use data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), maintained by the

12:310:25645:24:24:72:540:624:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:selects a new nationally representative subsample of households participating in the previous
12:311:25738:24:24:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:year’s National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) conducted by the National Center for Health
12:312:25828:24:24:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Statistics.  In each new panel the respondents are interviewed in five rounds spanning two
12:313:25918:24:24:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:full calendar years.  Round length varies across rounds and across households - in our sample,
12:314:26012:24:24:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reference periods are between three and five months, with an average duration of 4.2 months.
12:315:26104:24:23:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This  survey  provides  information  on  health  care  use,  expenditures,  sources  of  payment,
12:316:26201:23:24:72:540:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and  health  insurance  coverage,  as  well  as  reported  health  status,  demographic  and  socio-

12:318:26399:24:24:72:540:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The information provided by the household respondents is complemented with information
12:319:26485:24:24:72:540:409:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:collected  from  a  sample  of  medical  providers,  which  is  primarily  used  by  the  MEPS  as
12:320:26583:24:24:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:an  imputation  source  to  supplement  or  replace  household  reported  information  on  visits,
12:321:26681:24:24:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:diagnosis,  and  expenditures.   Our  sample  includes  16  waves  of  the  MEPS,  covering  the
12:322:26777:24:24:72:540:337:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:period 1996-2012.  We limit our sample to children who were 1 to 16 years old and had at
12:323:26865:24:24:72:494:313:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:least one parent employed at the time of the first interview (round) of the survey.6
12:324:26949:24:24:89:539:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The MEPS is ideally suited for this analysis for several reasons.  First, it provides rich
12:325:27039:24:24:71:539:265:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:information on child health that includes parent-reported health and mental health status,
12:326:27129:24:23:71:539:241:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:specific  health  conditions,  and  mental  disorders.   This  provides  a  broad  picture  of  health
12:327:27231:23:24:71:539:218:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:while also allowing us to isolate changes in specific conditions that are especially common
12:328:27322:24:19:71:539:194:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and/or  costly  among  children.7Second,  it  allows  us  to  examine  potential  mechanisms,
12:329:27415:19:15:85:539:175:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:6We do not count self-employed parents as employed when defining our sample.  We trimmed 6.4% of
12:330:27511:15:12:72:540:160:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:the children in the sample because they did not have data for all five rounds of the survey.  Another 4.4%
12:331:27617:12:12:72:540:148:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:of children were dropped from the sample because they had missing data on parental education, mother’s
12:332:27719:12:12:72:540:136:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:marital status, or health outcomes, and 9% of children did not have either parent employed in the first round
12:333:27828:12:9:72:130:124:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:of the survey.
12:334:27842:9:15:85:539:115:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:7Our choice of specific health conditions to include in our analysis is motivated in part by a statistical
12:335:27948:15:12:72:540:100:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:brief from the AHRQ (Soni, 2008) that ranks children’s conditions in terms of total medical expenditures.
12:336:28053:12:12:72:540:88:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:According to  this brief,  the  five  most expensive  conditions for children aged 0-17 in 2006  in terms  of to-
12:337:28166:12:0:72:540:76:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:tal expenditures were mental disorders, asthma, trauma-related disorders, acute bronchitis, and infectious
13:338:28274:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:such as changes in insurance coverage and health care utilization, using the same dataset.
13:339:28364:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Finally,  by  combining  many  short  panels  it  provides  a  relatively  large  sample  of  children
13:340:28466:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with displaced parents, which is unusual in studies of displacement that rely on survey data.
13:341:28559:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This enhances our statistical power and allows us to explore heterogeneity in the effects of
13:342:28651:24:24:72:267:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:parental displacement on child health.
13:343:28689:24:24:89:539:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Our  indicators  for  involuntary  job  displacement  are  constructed  from  a  section  of  the
13:344:28786:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:MEPS survey in which respondents are asked to choose the main reason why they changed
13:345:28871:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:jobs since the last interview from a list of possible responses. In most of our analysis, we define
13:346:28970:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:involuntary displacement as displacement for one of three reasons:  “job ended,” “business
13:347:29060:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dissolved or sold,” or “laid off.”8Although the three causes for job loss considered are clearly
13:348:29156:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:involuntary,  it  is  possible  that  layoffs  and  jobs  that  end  are  correlated  with  unobservable
13:349:29260:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:individual  or  family  shocks  that  are  also  related  to  child  health.   Though  other  possible
13:350:29362:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:responses to the survey such as “quit to take care of home or family,” “illness or injury,”
13:351:29453:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and “quit to take some time off,” are likely to capture many job changes that are potentially
13:352:29546:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:endogenous,  one limitation of the MEPS data is that we are not able to identify workers
13:353:29634:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:who were fired for cause.  To address this concern, we also create an alternative definition
13:354:29726:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of job displacement that only includes firm closures—an approach that is common in the
13:355:29812:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:literature on job displacement.  We note, however that limiting the definition of involuntary
13:356:29905:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:displacements in this way comes at a cost, resulting in a substantial decrease in the number of
13:357:30000:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:displacements that we observe.  We also interpret differences across specifications carefully in
13:358:30096:24:24:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:light of possible heterogeneous treatment effects, as the baseline characteristics of individuals
13:359:30193:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:displaced in business closure events are different from those of the full sample of displaced
13:360:30286:23:24:72:114:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:workers.
13:361:30294:24:22:89:539:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We begin by restricting our samples so that for the estimates of the effects of fathers’
13:362:30382:22:8:72:109:136:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:diseases.
13:363:30391:8:16:85:539:128:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:8When asked why they changed jobs since the last interview, respondents are given the following options:
13:364:30495:16:12:72:540:112:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:job ended, business dissolved or sold, retired, illness or injury, laid off, quit to have a baby, quit to go to
13:365:30606:12:12:72:540:100:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:school, quit to take care of home or family, quit because wanted time off, quit to take another job, unpaid
13:366:30713:12:0:72:137:88:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:leave, or other.
14:367:30731:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:displacements, the at-risk sample includes all children whose father is employed in the first
14:368:30824:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:round of the survey, and for the estimates of the effects of mothers’ displacements, the at-
14:369:30916:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:risk sample includes all children whose mother is employed in the first round of the survey.
14:370:31008:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Defining  the  samples  this  way  ensures  that  the  sample  used  to  help  identify  the  control
14:371:31109:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:variables in our analysis is as similar as possible to the treatment group.  We note, however,
14:372:31203:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that there are differences in baseline characteristics between children in the father-employed
14:373:31297:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sample  and  children  in  the  mother-employed  sample  that  make  direct  comparison  of  the
14:374:31393:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effects of paternal and maternal job displacement more difficult.  In addition to the models
14:375:31485:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:estimated  on  these  broader  samples,  we  estimate  models  in  which  we  restrict  our  father-
14:376:31585:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:employed and mother-employed samples to children whose relevant parent had at least one
14:377:31672:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:year of job tenure prior to displacement.  These samples represent groups of children whose
14:378:31763:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:parents  were  more  securely  attached  to  the  labor  market,  for  whom  job  loss  is  likely  to
14:379:31865:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:be a more severe, unexpected, and plausibly exogenous shock.  Based on precedent in the
14:380:31952:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:literature  on  job  displacement,  we  use  this  as  our  preferred  estimation  sample  when  we
14:381:32051:24:24:72:348:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:conduct robustness checks and heterogeneity analysis.
14:382:32104:24:34:89:522:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The outcome variables that we examine can be divided into the following categories:
14:383:32187:34:24:81:539:315:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:(i)Health outcomes:  These include the following:Reported health:  Respondents are asked
14:384:32275:24:24:99:539:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:to rate the health and mental health status of each child in the family according to the
14:385:32363:24:24:99:539:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:following categories:  excellent, very good, good, fair, and poor.  We create indicators
14:386:32451:24:24:99:539:243:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:for whether a child’s health and mental health were reported to be fair or poor and
14:387:32534:24:23:99:539:219:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:indicators for whether a child’s health and mental health were reported to be excellent;
14:388:32622:23:24:99:539:196:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f2:A:Health  conditions:  Medical conditions are reported by respondents when there is an
14:389:32706:24:24:99:539:172:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:event related to this condition, such as a doctor visit, hospital stay, disability day, or
14:390:32796:24:24:99:539:148:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:prescription drug purchase.  Conditions are reported verbatim by the interviewer and
14:391:32880:24:24:99:539:124:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:then coded to ICD-9-CM codes.  We use these codes to identify the following specific
14:392:32964:24:24:99:539:100:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:conditions:  infectious illnesses, bronchitis, asthma, injuries (trauma), attention deficit
14:393:33055:24:0:99:478:76:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:disorder (ADD), and stress-related mental disorders (anxiety, depression);
15:394:33131:0:24:78:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:(ii)Health  insurance  status:  We  look  at  whether  the  child  is  covered  by  any  insurance,
15:395:33230:24:24:99:539:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:private insurance, or public insurance (including Medicaid, SCHIP, Tricare, and other
15:396:33315:24:34:99:283:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:public hospital/physician coverage).
15:397:33351:34:23:74:539:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(iii)Health care and prescription drug utilization and expenditures: These include indicators
15:398:33444:23:24:99:539:603:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:for  any  doctor  visit,  checkups,  diagnostic,  emergency  room  (ER)  visits,  and  mental
15:399:33537:24:24:99:539:579:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:health  visits,  as  well  as  overall  prescription  drug  use  and  the  use  of  antibiotics  and
15:400:33637:24:32:99:205:555:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:mental health drugs.
15:401:33657:32:24:89:539:523:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Throughout  the  paper,  we  include  all  children  ages  1  and  up  in  the  regressions  with
15:402:33754:24:24:72:540:499:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:outcomes related to physical health.  In case diagnosis of mental disorders in childhood is
15:403:33845:24:24:72:540:475:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:correlated with a child’s exposure to teachers or other non-parental care providers, we limit
15:404:33938:24:24:72:540:451:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the sample to school-aged children (ages 6 and up) for all mental-health-related outcomes,
15:405:34028:24:24:72:452:427:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:including mental health ratings, conditions, visits and prescriptions drugs.
15:406:34104:24:24:89:539:403:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Before proceeding, we emphasize that, as in most of the existing literature, our measures
15:407:34193:24:24:72:540:379:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of child health are reported by household survey respondents (usually the mother).  As such,
15:408:34285:24:24:72:540:355:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:it is possible that changes in these measures may result from changes in respondent awareness
15:409:34378:24:23:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:or perception of a child’s health status, or even the respondent’s own mental state, rather
15:410:34469:23:24:72:540:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:than changes in the child’s actual health.  Moreover, because a medical condition is identified
15:411:34564:24:24:72:540:284:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the data when a health event related to the condition occurs, changes in the incidence of
15:412:34656:24:24:72:540:260:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:health conditions may be related to changes in the consumption of health care.  We interpret
15:413:34748:24:24:72:540:236:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:our findings with these caveats in mind.  We also explore the potential for changes in the
15:414:34838:24:24:72:540:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:frequency of medical care to influence reporting directly by looking for changes in the use of
15:415:34932:24:24:72:234:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:routine care after displacement.
15:416:34964:24:24:89:540:164:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Table 1 presents round 1 summary statistics by parental displacement status.9A number
15:417:35049:24:24:72:540:140:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of statistically significant differences between the columns highlight the importance of our
15:418:35141:24:24:72:540:116:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:empirical approach, which includes individual fixed effects and linear time trends that are
15:419:35232:24:17:72:540:92:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:allowed to vary depending on baseline health status.  Specifically, the children of displaced
15:420:35325:17:0:85:502:75:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:9Additional summary statistics for a number of subgroups can be found in Appendix Table A1.
16:421:35418:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:workers are less likely to be white and their parents are less likely to have a college education,
16:422:35516:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:less likely to have had at least one year of job tenure in round 1, and more likely to have
16:423:35607:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:individual earnings below the sample median. The children of displaced workers also are more
16:424:35699:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:likely to come from single-earner families and families with income below 200 percent of the
16:425:35791:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:poverty  line,  and  have  lower  levels  of  private  health  insurance  coverage  and  higher  levels
16:426:35894:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of  public  insurance  coverage.   For  the  most  part,  the  differences  between  never-displaced
16:427:35994:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and displaced samples are less pronounced when the displaced-parent samples are limited
16:428:36081:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to  include  only  the  children  of  parents  who  had  at  least  one  year  of  job  tenure  prior  to
16:429:36186:24:24:72:440:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:displacement or only the children of workers displaced in a firm closure.
16:430:36259:24:24:89:539:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Looking at health outcomes,  Table 1 shows that the children of displaced workers are
16:431:36344:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:less likely to have their physical and mental health reported as “excellent” and the children
16:432:36437:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of displaced mothers are more likely to have physical and mental health reported as “fair
16:433:36526:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:or  poor.”  The  children  of  displaced  fathers  are  less  likely  to  be  diagnosed  with  specific
16:434:36629:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mental disorders including ADD, anxiety, and depression, which could be driven by lower
16:435:36716:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:levels  of  health  insurance  coverage.   There  are  also  a  few  differences  in  the  incidence  of
16:436:36820:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:physical  health  conditions,  for  example,  a  lower  incidence  of  injuries  among  the  children
16:437:36921:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of  displaced  mothers  and  a  lower  incidence  of  infections  among  the  children  of  displaced
16:438:37022:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:fathers.   The  summary  statistics  in  Table  1  also  reveal  important  differences  between  the
16:439:37123:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:father-employed and mother-employed samples.  Specifically, black children and children in
16:440:37213:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:families with income below 200 percent of the poverty line make up a larger share of the
16:441:37301:24:24:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mother-employed  sample.   Employed  mothers  are  also  less  likely  to  have  job  tenure  than

17:443:37425:0:36:72:210:708:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:5  Empirical Approach
17:444:37446:36:24:89:539:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We estimate a series of fixed-effects models, each with a different health-related dependent
17:445:37538:24:48:72:340:648:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:variable.  Our main regression equation is as follows:
17:446:37592:48:35:223:540:600:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f2:A:Yit=αi+βDit+γXit+δt+εit(1)

17:448:37715:23:24:72:539:542:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f2:B:Ditis an indicator for post-parental displacement periods,Xitis a vector of time-varying
17:449:37803:24:24:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:control  variables,  andδtis  a  set  of  round  dummies.   Child  fixed  effects  are  included  to
17:450:37903:24:24:72:540:494:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:account for permanent characteristics of children and families that may be related both with
17:451:37995:24:24:72:540:470:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:child health and the likelihood of parental displacement.  The time-varying controls include
17:452:38087:24:24:72:540:446:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dummies for child age and the calendar year in which the interview took place,  month of
17:453:38175:24:24:72:540:422:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:interview dummies to control for seasonality in both health outcomes and the likelihood of
17:454:38265:24:24:72:540:398:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:parental displacement, and separate linear time trends for each of the five baseline health
17:455:38356:24:24:72:540:374:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:categories. We also control for the length of the round in days, which varies across individuals
17:456:38452:24:24:72:540:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:even within the same panel and round due to variation in interview dates across households.
17:457:38543:24:24:72:539:326:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Observations are weighted by MEPS individual sample weights.10To adjust for correlations
17:458:38631:24:23:72:540:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:across children within families and correlation within families over time the standard errors
17:459:38724:23:24:72:256:279:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are clustered at the household level.
17:460:38761:24:24:89:539:255:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Within this empirical framework, causal identification of the effects of parental job loss
17:461:38851:24:24:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:relies  on  the  assumption  that  the  job  loss  is  exogenous  with  respect  to  family  and  child
17:462:38954:24:24:72:540:207:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:outcomes.  In other words, there must be no unobservabletime-varyingfactors that are cor-
17:463:39043:24:24:72:540:183:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:related both with the probability of worker displacement and with child health outcomes.  It
17:464:39135:24:18:72:540:159:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:must also be the case that changes in child health do not directly cause changes in the likeli-
17:465:39230:18:15:81:539:141:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:10Following  Solon  et  al.   (2014),  we  have  also  conducted  our  analysis  without  using  sample  weights.
17:466:39343:15:12:72:540:126:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:Though there are some differences between the results from the unweighted analysis and our main results,
17:467:39447:12:12:72:540:114:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:the discrepancies between the two sets of results are consistent with the known oversampling of minority
17:468:39551:12:12:72:540:102:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:groups in the MEPS and the heterogeneity in treatment effects that we observe between groups.  Unweighted

18:470:39710:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:hood of parental displacement.  While we cannot entirely rule out either of these possibilities,
18:471:39806:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we address concerns about endogeneity in several ways.  Most importantly, we choose our
18:472:39893:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:definition of job displacement carefully and test robustness to an alternative definition of the
18:473:39989:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:variable.  Limiting our sample to workers with more stable employment history also helps
18:474:40077:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to address potential endogeneity.  Finally,  we check for a potential red flag by estimating
18:475:40169:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:models in which we include an indicator for the survey round prior to displacement to see if
18:476:40261:24:41:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the health effects of parental displacement on child health seem to occur prior to the event.

18:479:40410:31:24:89:539:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We begin, in Table 2, by estimating the effects of fathers’ and mothers’ job losses on child
18:480:40502:24:24:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:health and mental health.  As described in Section 4, we estimate the effects of each parent’s
18:481:40596:24:24:72:540:412:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:job loss with (1) the full samples and all involuntary displacements, (2) samples limited to
18:482:40688:24:24:72:540:388:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the children of workers with at least one year of job tenure prior to displacement, and (3) a
18:483:40781:24:24:72:423:364:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:restricted definition of displacement that includes only firm closures.
18:484:40852:24:24:89:539:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The  results  in  Table  2  show  modest  decreases  (about  6-10  percent)  in  the  likelihood
18:485:40948:24:24:72:540:316:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that  a  child’s  health  or  mental  health  is  reported  to  be  “excellent”  following  the  job  loss
18:486:41054:24:24:72:540:292:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of either parent.  Focusing on specific health conditions,  however,  the estimated effects of
18:487:41148:24:23:72:540:268:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:fathers’ and mothers’ job losses on child health differ.  Paternal job loss is associated with
18:488:41242:23:24:72:540:245:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:substantial (100 to 150 percent) increases in the likelihood of depression and anxiety in both
18:489:41336:24:24:72:540:221:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the tenured-father sample and the firm closures specification,  while maternal job loss has
18:490:41427:24:24:72:540:197:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:no significant effect on mental illness.  Meanwhile, a mother’s job loss is associated with 7-8
18:491:41522:24:24:72:540:173:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:percent decreases in the incidence of infectious illness (including viral and bacterial infections
18:492:41620:24:24:72:540:149:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:such as flu, colds, intestinal infection, and otitis) while a father’s job loss is not associated
18:493:41717:24:24:72:540:125:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with changes in infectious illness. Other results in Table 2 are mostly insignificant, with point
18:494:41814:24:24:72:540:101:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:estimates that vary across specifications.  Two exceptions are a weakly significant (at 10%
18:495:41905:24:0:72:540:77:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:significance level) reduction in trauma in the male firm-closure specification, and a weakly
19:496:41999:0:24:72:501:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:significant reduction in asthma in the full-sample female displacement specification.
19:497:42084:24:24:89:539:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The  differences  between  the  effects  of  fathers’  and  mothers’  job  losses  in  Table  2  are
19:498:42184:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:interesting in light of the existing literature and potential mechanisms at work.  As discussed
19:499:42279:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in Section 2, previous social science research suggests that the stress effects of paternal dis-
19:500:42375:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:placement are likely to be larger than those from maternal job loss.  Our finding that children
19:501:42470:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are more likely to be diagnosed and treated with mental disorders commonly associated with
19:502:42560:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:stress following paternal displacement is consistent with this story.  Research also tells us
19:503:42653:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that mothers are more likely to spend time as caregivers during periods of unemployment
19:504:42740:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and may remain unemployed longer than fathers, particularly in two-earner families.  Thus,
19:505:42830:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the finding that the incidence of infectious illness is decreased among children after maternal
19:506:42925:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:displacement can either be explained by reductions in mothers’ own exposure to infectious
19:507:43014:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:illness in the workplace or by changes in children’s exposure from reductions in the use of
19:508:43105:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:out-of-home childcare.  Considering the long-run implications of these findings,  the short-
19:509:43197:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:run changes in stress following paternal job loss might have broader impacts on children’s
19:510:43287:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:health and academic achievement that could translate into the long-run effects on educa-
19:511:43375:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tional attainment and labor market outcomes that have been found in other studies.  At the
19:512:43465:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:same time, it is difficult to know whether short-run reductions in infectious illness are a net
19:513:43560:24:36:72:506:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:positive or negative for children’s health (we discuss this issue in more detail below).

19:515:43728:32:24:89:539:233:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To  investigate  the  mechanisms  behind  the  health  effects  observed  in  Table  2,  we  next
19:516:43825:24:24:72:540:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:explore the effects of parental job loss on health insurance coverage and healthcare utilization
19:517:43921:24:24:72:540:185:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in Table 3.  If parents forego treatment for the conditions in question as a result of a lack
19:518:44014:24:24:72:540:161:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of insurance coverage or a change in the source of coverage, these results have potentially
19:519:44105:24:24:72:540:137:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:important  implications  for  the  interpretation  of  our  main  results.   While  we  believe  that
19:520:44206:24:23:72:540:113:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the acute nature of many of the health conditions that we consider makes it is unlikely that
19:521:44298:23:0:72:540:90:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:parents would not seek treatment for these conditions even in the absence of health insurance,
20:522:44394:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we acknowledge the possibility that the observed reduction in the incidence of events related
20:523:44487:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to infectious diseases following maternal displacement may reflect reductions in the likelihood
20:524:44582:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of diagnosis and treatment.  Reduced diagnosis may also be masking increased incidence of
20:525:44671:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:other health conditions as well.  If we find significant decreases in health insurance coverage
20:526:44766:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and  routine  healthcare  use  following  displacement,  then  we  have  reason  to  be  concerned
20:527:44864:24:24:72:156:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:about this issue.
20:528:44881:24:24:89:539:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The effects of parental job loss on children’s health insurance status are shown in the top
20:529:44972:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:panel of Table 3.  The results show that both paternal and maternal job losses lead to reduc-
20:530:45065:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tions in private insurance coverage and increases in public insurance coverage.  Comparing
20:531:45155:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the coefficients on maternal and paternal job loss across columns, we can see that children
20:532:45246:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are also more likely to lose private coverage and gain public coverage following the loss of a
20:533:45340:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:job with tenure, and that the effects of firm closure on insurance coverage are smaller than
20:534:45432:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the effects of other types of displacement.  Focusing on the tenured samples, we see that while
20:535:45527:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the effects of parental job loss on private insurance coverage are fairly substantial (with de-
20:536:45622:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:creases of around 15 percent in both the tenured father and tenured mother samples), these
20:537:45712:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effects are largely counteracted by increases in the likelihood of public coverage (26 percent
20:538:45806:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the father-tenured sample and 19 percent in the mother-tenured sample).  As a result,
20:539:45894:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:even in the sample of tenured workers, the likelihood of having insurance coverage from any
20:540:45985:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:source is reduced by only 5-6 percent following displacement.  These effects are substantially
20:541:46079:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:smaller than the effects found by Schaller and Stevens (2015), who use the MEPS to study
20:542:46167:24:24:72:539:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the effects of job displacement on adult health outcomes, insurance, and utilization.11Thus,
20:543:46259:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:our results suggest that families are making use of the public safety net following involuntary
20:544:46354:23:24:72:141:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:displacement.
20:545:46367:24:24:89:539:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In the bottom panel of Table 3 we explore whether parental job loss results in changes
20:546:46453:24:18:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in children’s medical care utilization.  We acknowledge that changes in utilization may be

20:548:46653:16:12:72:540:100:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:of having any insurance for adults in the MEPS sample. Part of this difference can be explained by differences
20:549:46763:12:12:72:540:88:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:in the availability of public insurance coverage to adults; only 8 percent of displaced adults in their sample
20:550:46873:12:0:72:210:76:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:had public coverage in round 1.
21:551:46906:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:driven simultaneously by changes in family income, changes in insurance status and source
21:552:46995:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of coverage, and changes in health status, and interpret our findings with caution.  Perhaps
21:553:47087:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:not surprisingly, given the relatively small changes in insurance coverage that we observe, we
21:554:47181:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:find no significant effects of parental displacement on the likelihood of receiving a checkup
21:555:47274:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:or well-child visit during the survey round.  Thus, it appears that family income shocks and
21:556:47366:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:changes in insurance coverage do not substantially affect the use of routine medical care in
21:557:47458:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the short run.  This finding is reassuring, as it suggests that our health effects are unlikely
21:558:47553:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to be driven by changes in the likelihood of diagnosis.12We also find no significant effects
21:559:47645:24:24:72:374:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of parental displacement on diagnostic or emergency visits.
21:560:47704:24:24:89:539:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:There are two significant results that do appear in Table 3, each of which is potentially
21:561:47793:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:consistent with the health results from the previous table.  First, we find an increase in the
21:562:47887:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:likelihood of a mental health visit following paternal displacement, which corresponds with
21:563:47978:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the increase in mental disorders after paternal displacement seen in Table 2.  We also see a
21:564:48070:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:significant reduction in prescription drug use following maternal displacement, which could
21:565:48161:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:be  related  to  the  reductions  in  infectious  illness  seen  in  Table  2.   However,  the  effects  on
21:566:48268:24:37:72:386:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:antibiotic use, while negative, are not statistically significant.

21:568:48362:31:24:89:539:281:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Next, we estimate models in which we include three separate displacement indicators: one
21:569:48450:24:18:72:540:257:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for the period prior to displacement, one for the period in which displacement occurs, and one
21:570:48544:18:16:81:539:239:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:12To further alleviate the concern that sick children might be less likely to visit the doctor and thus less
21:571:48652:16:11:72:540:223:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:likely to be diagnosed with a particular medical condition following parental displacement, we additionally
21:572:48759:11:12:72:540:212:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:investigated  the  raw  and  regression-adjusted  correlations  between  parent-reported  general  health  ratings,
21:573:48874:12:12:72:540:200:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:which are not mechanically related to specific to medical events, and the likelihood of checkup or diagnostic
21:574:48983:12:12:72:540:188:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:visits.  We wanted to see if these correlations are different for children whose parents were recently displaced
21:575:49095:12:12:72:540:176:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:than for other children.  The idea behind this exercise is that parents’ ratings of their child’s overall health
21:576:49207:12:12:72:540:164:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:status should reflect not only conditions for which the child visited a doctor, but also conditions that the
21:577:49315:12:12:72:540:152:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:family chose to treat at home or opted not to treat.  If the relationship between reported general health and
21:578:49424:12:12:72:540:140:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:doctor visits is weaker following displacement, we might worry that some conditions are not being officially
21:579:49532:12:12:72:540:128:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:“diagnosed” in our data.  We find that the correlations seen immediately following parental displacement are
21:580:49640:12:12:72:540:116:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:very similar to those for the rest of our sample.  Though they do not necessarily reflect causal relationships,
21:581:49751:12:12:72:540:104:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:the fact that these correlations don’t change following parental displacement suggests that the likelihood of
21:582:49860:12:0:72:433:92:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:getting treated for a particular health condition also does not change dramatically.
22:583:49946:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for the periods after displacement.  There are two reasons to do this.  The first reason is that
22:584:50042:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:previous research has shown that the earnings losses associated with job displacement may
22:585:50131:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:begin as early as two years before the displacement occurs (Jacobson et al. 1993). Though the
22:586:50224:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reasons for the pre-displacement decline in earnings are unknown, this pattern could mean
22:587:50313:24:24:72:539:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f6:B:that child health may be affected by changes in income, parental time use, and stressbefore
22:588:50404:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:displacement.  This could affect the magnitude of our estimated coefficients if our pre-period
22:589:50498:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is contaminated with treatment effects.  For example, if the pre-period treatment effects on
22:590:50590:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a health outcome are negative, then we will be underestimating the total treatment effect in
22:591:50682:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:our main specification.  It is also possible that individuals anticipating displacement might
22:592:50775:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:choose to attend the doctor or fill prescriptions in the period before they lose their health
22:593:50868:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:insurance,  which  would  bias  the  magnitude  of  the  health  care  utilization  effects  upward.
22:594:50968:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The second reason for estimating these models is to use the pre-displacement indicators as
22:595:51058:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a placebo test to reduce concerns about the endogeneity of parental displacement.  However,
22:596:51149:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this relies on the assumption that there arenotreatment effects in the pre-period.  If we were
22:597:51243:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to find significant deterioration in child health in the period prior to parental displacement,
22:598:51338:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:it would be difficult to sort out the reasons for this—we may be able to attribute it to early
22:599:51432:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:treatment effects, as described above, but we would also be concerned that the health shock
22:600:51523:24:24:72:381:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is related to the reason for the subsequent job displacement.
22:601:51584:24:24:89:539:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Estimates showing the timing of the health effects of fathers’ and mothers’ job losses are
22:602:51674:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:presented  in  Table  4.   In  this  and  all  remaining  tables,  we  restrict  the  sample  to  workers
22:603:51779:24:24:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with at least one year of job tenure at the start of the survey.13Consistent with the pre-
22:604:51869:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:displacement earnings losses seen in the literature, we do see a small marginally significant
22:605:51962:23:24:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:decline in private insurance coverage in the period prior to paternal displacement.  However,
22:606:52055:24:24:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we do not see any significant health effects in the period prior to displacement.  This suggests
22:607:52151:24:18:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that any decreases in income, increases in stress levels and changes in time use associated
22:608:52242:18:16:81:539:116:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:13Many studies of displaced workers restrict their samples to workers with three or more years of job tenure
22:609:52350:16:12:72:540:100:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:prior to displacement.  We estimated models in which we restricted our analysis to the children of workers
22:610:52456:12:0:72:469:88:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:with three years of tenure in round 1.  The estimates were very similar, though less precise.
23:611:52551:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with  job  loss  do  not  measurably  affect  children’s  health  before  job  loss  occurs.   This  also
23:612:52656:24:41:72:430:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mitigates concerns about reverse causality and omitted variables bias.

23:614:52742:36:24:89:539:607:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:As  discussed  in  Section  2,  it  is  possible  that  the  effects  of  parental  job  displacement
23:615:52843:24:24:72:540:583:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:seen in the full sample are masking heterogeneity in the treatment effects along a number
23:616:52932:24:24:72:540:559:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of dimensions.  In this section, we explore heterogeneity in the treatment effects of parental
23:617:53026:24:24:72:540:535:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:displacement by family type, child age, and family socioeconomic status.  We also explore
23:618:53115:24:24:72:540:511:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:whether  the  effects  of  parental  displacement  are  proxying  for  changes  in  local  economic
23:619:53214:24:24:72:540:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:conditions and whether they are affected by the macroeconomic environment in which they
23:620:53301:24:36:72:103:463:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:occur.

23:622:53325:32:24:89:539:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:First, in Table 5, we consider family structure and the number of earners in the family,
23:623:53413:24:24:72:540:371:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:comparing the effects of paternal displacement in dual-earner and single-earner families and
23:624:53505:24:24:72:540:347:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:comparing the effects of maternal displacement in two-parent versus single-mother families.
23:625:53596:24:23:72:540:323:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:A  priori,  it  is  difficult  to  predict  how  the  effects  will  differ  by  family  type.   Single  earner
23:626:53707:23:24:72:540:300:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:families may have fewer resources with which to respond to an earnings shock, and displace-
23:627:53798:24:24:72:540:276:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ment is more likely to cause a child to lose private health insurance coverage when only one
23:628:53890:24:24:72:540:252:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:parent is employed.  On the other hand, Kalil and Ziol-Guest (2008) provide evidence that
23:629:53979:24:24:72:540:228:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the negative effects of paternal displacement on children’s academic outcomes are more pro-
23:630:54070:24:24:72:540:204:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:nounced in two-earner households and suggest that this is because fathers are distressed at
23:631:54161:24:24:72:540:180:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:losing their “breadwinner” status.  Meanwhile, mothers in two-parent families may be more
23:632:54250:24:24:72:540:156:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:likely to remain out of the labor force longer following displacement than single mothers, so
23:633:54343:24:24:72:540:132:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:it may be more likely to observe reductions in infectious illness and other effects related to
23:634:54437:24:24:72:343:108:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:changes in childcare arrangements for these mothers.
23:635:54489:24:0:89:539:84:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The results by family type show a slightly larger increase in mental disorders after pa-
24:636:54579:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ternal displacement in dual-earner families, but the difference is not statistically significant.
24:637:54676:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Turning to the effects of maternal displacement, all of the estimated effects, including both
24:638:54769:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the declines in parent-reported health and mental health and the reduction in infectious ill-
24:639:54862:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ness, are larger and more precisely estimated in two-parent families.  In general, while we do
24:640:54956:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:not have enough data to rule out similar effects across family types, it appears as though the
24:641:55050:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effects of both paternal and maternal job loss in Table 2 are at least as large in two-earner
24:642:55143:24:36:72:403:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:families as they are in single-earner families, and possibly larger.

24:644:55244:32:24:89:539:496:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:One of the striking findings from studies of the long-run effects of parental job displace-
24:645:55335:24:24:72:540:472:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ment is that the effects tend to be concentrated among relatively disadvantaged households.
24:646:55426:24:24:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Oreopoulos et al.  (2008) and Page et al.  (2009) find that the strongest effects of parental
24:647:55519:24:24:72:540:424:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:job loss on children’s labor market and educational outcomes in adulthood are found at the
24:648:55609:24:24:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bottom of the income distribution.  In Table 6 we explore whether the effects of parental job
24:649:55702:24:23:72:540:376:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:loss differ depending on whether the earnings of the displaced parent were above or below
24:650:55791:23:24:72:540:353:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the sample median in round 1, whether family earnings were below 200 percent of the federal
24:651:55882:24:24:72:464:329:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:poverty line, and whether either of the child’s parents have attended college.
24:652:55960:24:24:89:539:305:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:As in previous studies, we find striking patterns when we stratify by socioeconomic status
24:653:56050:24:24:72:540:281:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(SES). Specifically, we find that the negative effects of paternal displacement on child mental
24:654:56145:24:24:72:540:257:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:health are concentrated among low-SES families. We additionally find statistically significant
24:655:56239:24:24:72:540:233:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:negative effects of paternal job loss on a child’s physical health rating and significant increases
24:656:56338:24:24:72:540:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the incidence of injuries following paternal job loss among children in low-SES families
24:657:56429:24:24:72:540:185:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that are not apparent in the full sample.  Looking at the effects of maternal displacement,
24:658:56520:24:24:72:540:161:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the coefficients are mostly similar for low- and high-SES children, with one major exception:
24:659:56613:24:24:72:540:137:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we  see  that  the  reductions  in  infectious  illness  are  substantially  larger  among  children  in
24:660:56717:24:23:72:540:113:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:high-earnings  families  and  children  with  more-educated  parents.   This  is  consistent  with
24:661:56815:23:0:72:540:90:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:our predictions,  since these are the families in which mothers are more likely to have the
25:662:56908:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:luxury  of  choosing  to  substitute  home  care  for  market-based  childcare  during  a  period  of
25:663:57009:24:24:72:150:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:unemployment.
25:664:57022:24:24:89:539:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:As a side note, while fathers’ job losses are associated with increases in injuries among
25:665:57111:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the children of in low-SES families, they are associated with decreases in injuries in more-
25:666:57203:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:advantaged families.  It is difficult to know what to make of this result—it could be driven
25:667:57295:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by differential changes in maltreatment rates (for example, if child maltreatment were ex-
25:668:57385:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:acerbated by financial stress in low-income families and exacerbated by workplace stress in
25:669:57476:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:high-income families) but also could be related to different patterns of time use and partici-
25:670:57570:24:36:72:528:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:pation in sports and other extracurricular activities between low- and high-SES children.
25:671:57659:36:32:72:156:480:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:F:7.3    Child Age
25:672:57675:32:24:89:539:448:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Next, in Table 7, we estimate the effects of parental job loss on child health by the age
25:673:57764:24:24:72:540:424:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of the child.  Recall from Section 2 that we might expect to see the largest reductions in
25:674:57854:24:24:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:infectious illness among young children if mothers are substituting home care for market-
25:675:57943:24:23:72:540:376:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:based childcare after job loss, but otherwise it is difficult to predict how the effects should
25:676:58038:23:24:72:540:353:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:vary by age.  To check for heterogeneity by age, we separate our data into three age groups:
25:677:58130:24:24:72:540:329:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:age  1-5  (pre-school  aged),  age  6-12  (primary  and  middle  school),  and  age  13-18  (teens).
25:678:58230:24:24:72:540:305:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Though the coefficients do vary across columns for most outcomes, we don’t have enough
25:679:58316:24:24:72:540:281:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:power  to  identify  significant  differences  across  age  groups  in  the  estimated  health  effects
25:680:58419:24:24:72:540:257:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of parental displacement.  For what it is worth, we do not see evidence that the effects of
25:681:58510:24:24:72:540:233:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:maternal job loss on infectious illness are concentrated among young children, as we might
25:682:58600:24:24:72:540:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:have expected if changes in daycare attendance were the only mechanism, and we do not see
25:683:58689:24:36:72:482:185:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:significant differences in the effects of paternal job loss on mental illness by age.
25:684:58774:36:32:72:217:149:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:F:7.4    Economic Conditions
25:685:58800:32:24:89:539:117:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:A  final  factor  not  yet  considered  is  the  state  of  the  local  economy  at  the  time  of  dis-
25:686:58904:24:0:72:540:93:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:placement.  A large literature has shown that macroeconomic conditions are associated with
26:687:58996:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:health, mental health, time use, and other outcomes for adults.  As displacements are more
26:688:59086:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:likely to occur when macroeconomic conditions are bad, it is possible that our displacement
26:689:59177:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:indicator is picking up the effects of experiencing an economic downturn,  rather than the
26:690:59267:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:direct effects of involuntary job loss.  Another way in which macroeconomic conditions might
26:691:59359:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:play a role in our analysis is as a source of heterogeneity in our estimated coefficients.  In
26:692:59453:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:particular, it is possible that the effects of job displacement on child health might vary de-
26:693:59547:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:pending on the state of the local economy at the time that the displacement occurs. However,
26:694:59639:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the direction of the changes in unclear.  It is possible that job displacement might carry less
26:695:59734:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:stigma during an economic downturn, as displacement is widespread when the economy is
26:696:59819:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:suffering, but displacement may also result in more financial strain and a longer period of
26:697:59910:24:23:72:315:468:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:unemployment during an economic downturn.14
26:698:59953:23:24:89:539:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To explore the link between parental job loss and local economic conditions, we use re-
26:699:60040:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:stricted  information  on  the  geographic  location  of  the  MEPS  respondents,  obtained  with
26:700:60137:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:special permission from the AHRQ. First, we estimate our health regressions with an addi-
26:701:60226:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tional control for the state monthly unemployment rate.  The results, presented in columns
26:702:60316:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:1  and  6  of  Table  8,  show  that  the  effects  of  parental  displacement  are  unchanged  when
26:703:60416:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:local  economic  conditions  are  included  in  the  regressions.   Next,  we  examine  whether  the
26:704:60516:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:treatment effects  of parental  job displacement  are  different during  an economic  downturn
26:705:60610:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by interacting the displacement variables with an indicator for whether the state unemploy-
26:706:60701:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ment rate is high (above 5) or low at the time of the displacement.  Perhaps surprisingly, the
26:707:60795:24:24:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:results again show no role for local economic conditions in mediating the effects of parental
26:708:60888:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:job displacement on child health;  while the coefficients are sometimes different across the
26:709:60980:23:24:72:464:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:two columns, the differences between them are never statistically significant.
26:710:61058:24:24:89:539:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:As an alternate way of exploring whether the state of the economy matters for the effects
26:711:61147:24:18:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of  parental  displacement  on  child  health,  we  split  our  sample  into  two  parts,  separating
26:712:61248:18:16:81:539:116:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:14It is also important to keep in mind that selection into job displacement is also likely to be different
26:713:61354:16:12:72:540:100:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:during an economic downturn, so any differences in the estimated coefficients may be the result of a change
26:714:61461:12:0:72:247:88:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:in the composition of the treated group.
27:715:61503:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:panels  that  end  prior  to  2008  (the  start  of  the  Great  Recession)  from  panels  that  end  in
27:716:61607:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:2008 or later.  This approach is somewhat crude, given that there may be changes in health
27:717:61697:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:behaviors, sample composition, survey methodology, or other unobservable factors over the
27:718:61786:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:time period that contribute to differences in the estimated effects.  However, it gives us some
27:719:61881:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:idea of whether the health effects of parental displacement are substantially different in the
27:720:61975:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:later years of our data, when the national economy was in the midst of a severe downturn
27:721:62063:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and slow recovery.  These results, also shown in Table 8, show that our main results—the
27:722:62151:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effects of paternal job loss on mental health conditions and the effects of maternal job loss
27:723:62244:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on infectious illness—are not different in the two time periods.  However, a few differences
27:724:62336:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:between the time periods do emerge.  In particular, paternal job loss results in increases in
27:725:62429:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the likelihood of reporting a child’s health and mental health to be fair or poor in the period
27:726:62524:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:before 2008, but does not have the same effect after 2008.  We also see that paternal job loss
27:727:62618:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:results in a reduction in infectious illness in general and bronchitis and upper respiratory
27:728:62710:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:infections in particular during the later time period.  This could be because men were more
27:729:62801:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:likely to remain out of work for a long period following displacement during the downturn,
27:730:62891:24:41:72:538:349:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:and thus children were less likely to be exposed to infectious illness through their fathers.15
27:731:62986:41:36:72:248:308:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:8  Discussion and Conclusion
27:732:63014:36:24:89:539:272:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:This study examines the short-run effects of parental job loss on children’s health.  Our
27:733:63103:24:24:72:540:248:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:results  suggest  differing  patterns  in  the  effects  of  paternal  and  maternal  job  loss  on  child
27:734:63209:24:24:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:health in the short-run.  In particular, while both male and female job losses are associated
27:735:63302:24:23:72:540:200:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with  declines  in  parents’  ratings  of  child  health  and  mental  health,  paternal  job  loss  is
27:736:63405:23:24:72:540:177:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:uniquely  associated  with  increases  in  depression  and  anxiety  and  visits  to  mental  health
27:737:63505:24:24:72:540:153:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:professionals  among  children,  while  maternal  job  loss  reduces  the  incidence  of  infectious
27:738:63605:24:24:72:540:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:illness and the use of prescription drugs.  We find that these patterns are robust to replacing
27:739:63700:24:18:72:540:105:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:our  definition  of  involuntary  job  displacement  with  one  that  includes  only  firm  closures,
27:740:63801:18:15:81:539:87:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:15Schaller and Stevens (2015) find that both men and women experience reductions in infectious illness
27:741:63903:15:0:72:190:72:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:following job displacement.
28:742:63932:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:though  sometimes  the  estimates  based  on  the  alternative  definition  are  less  precise,  and
28:743:64032:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we  do  not  see  any  statistically  significant  changes  in  child  health  in  the  period  prior  to
28:744:64137:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:displacement.  Exploring heterogeneity in our estimated effects,  we find that the negative
28:745:64228:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effects of paternal job loss are larger for children in low-SES families, while the reductions in
28:746:64325:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:infections after maternal job loss are concentrated among children in high-SES two-parent
28:747:64414:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:families.  We are not able to discern significant differences in the estimated effects of parental
28:748:64512:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:displacement by child age or the state of the economy at the time of displacement.  Our paper
28:749:64605:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is the first to document the negative mental health effects of paternal job loss on children,
28:750:64698:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and can potential provide insight as to why parental job loss has been found to have negative
28:751:64791:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effects on children’s academic achievement and long-run outcomes.  At the same time, the
28:752:64879:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:finding that maternal job loss reduces children’s incidence of infectious illness in the short-
28:753:64974:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:run suggests that changes in maternal time use are more important for child health than
28:754:65061:24:24:72:464:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:changes in income and health insurance status when mothers lose their jobs.
28:755:65136:24:24:89:539:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In addition to documenting the differing effects of paternal and maternal job loss on child
28:756:65227:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:health and mental health, another important finding from this study is that public health
28:757:65316:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:insurance programs such as Medicaid and the SCHIP are providing an effective safety net
28:758:65403:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for  children.   It  does  not  appear  that  the  reductions  in  the  observed  incidence  of  specific
28:759:65508:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:health  conditions  that  we  observe  are  due  to  reduced  diagnosis  resulting  from  changes  in
28:760:65609:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:insurance coverage, as we find only limited effects of job loss on children’s health insurance
28:761:65703:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:coverage and no effects on the utilization of routine and diagnositc medical care.  When we
28:762:65794:24:24:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:look at health insurance coverage by source, we find a substantial increase in the probability
28:763:65888:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of  having  public  insurance coverage  following  displacement,  which  largely  counteracts  the
28:764:65986:23:24:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:decrease in private coverage.  As a result, our estimated effects of job displacement on the
28:765:66078:24:24:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:likelihood  of  children  having  coverage  from  any  source  are  substantially  smaller  than  the
28:766:66179:24:24:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:corresponding estimates for adults using the MEPS data (Schaller and Stevens, 2015).  As
28:767:66267:24:24:72:540:110:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the  share  of  the  population  eligible  for  Medicaid  is  expanded  in  some  states  through  the
28:768:66369:24:0:72:382:86:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Affordable Care Act, this safety net may become larger still.
29:769:66432:0:24:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:One  limitation  of  our  study  is  that  we  cannot  extend  our  observation  period  beyond
29:770:66527:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the scope of the MEPS panel, which is only two years in length.  As a substantial fraction
29:771:66617:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of  displaced  workers  are  likely  to  regain  employment  soon  after  displacement,  it  is  likely
29:772:66720:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that the reductions in contagious illness that we observe will disappear over time.  It is also
29:773:66815:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:possible that the effects of job displacement related to income loss and stress will become
29:774:66906:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:larger over time.  Job displacement is associated with permanent decreases in earnings and
29:775:66996:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:increased likelihood of future displacement (Jacobson et al., 1993, Stevens 1997) so an initial
29:776:67091:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:displacement  may  be  only  the  beginning  of  a  tumultuous  period  for  a  family.   Increased
29:777:67190:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:stress in the period immediately following displacement may also take time to translate into
29:778:67282:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:worse physical health.  We also acknowledge that it is difficult to foresee whether temporary
29:779:67375:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reductions in contagious illness in childhood translate into any changes in longer-term health,
29:780:67470:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:human capital, or labor market outcomes.  According to the “cohort morbidity phenotype”
29:781:67557:24:24:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:theory of Finch and Crimmins (2004), the inflammatory processes that result from early life
29:782:67648:24:24:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:exposure to infectious illness persist from early age into adulthood and may ultimately be
29:783:67738:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:related to old-age mortality.  On the other hand,  a substantial literature in medicine and
29:784:67829:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:public  health  is  dedicated  to  exploring  the  hypothesis  that  daycare  attendance  and  early
29:785:67929:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:exposure  to  infectious  disease  in  fact  protect  against  the  development  of  asthma,  allergy,
29:786:68031:24:24:72:489:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and other diseases later in life (see, e.g.  Ball et al.  (2000), Nafstad et al.  (2005)).
29:787:68121:24:24:89:539:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Though we acknowledge that we cannot draw any conclusions about the long-term welfare
29:788:68206:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effects of parental job displacement from our findings due to these limitations, we emphasize
29:789:68299:24:24:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that the results from this study highlight the importance of considering not only changes in
29:790:68391:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:income, but also of changes in mental health, parental time use, and childcare arrangements,
