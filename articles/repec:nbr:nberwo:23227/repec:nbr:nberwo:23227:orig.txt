2:34:2005:28:28:273:338:616:12:Times:12:Times:ABSTRACT
2:35:2013:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:We   propose   a   nonparametric   method   to   test   which   characteristics   provide   independent 
2:36:2117:14:14:72:545:574:12:Times:12:Times:information for the cross section of expected returns. We use the adaptive group LASSO to select 
2:37:2213:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:characteristics and  to  estimate  how  they  affect  expected  returns  nonparametrically.  Our  method 
2:38:2317:14:14:72:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:can  handle  a  large number  of  characteristics,  allows  for  a  flexible  functional  form,  and  is 
2:39:2421:14:14:71:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:insensitive  to  outliers.  Many of  the  previously  identified  return  predictors  do  not  provide 
2:40:2523:14:14:71:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:incremental  information  for  expected  returns, and  nonlinearities  are  important.  Our  proposed 
2:41:2624:14:14:71:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:method  has  higher  out-of-sample  explanatory  power compared  to  linear  panel  regressions,  and 
2:42:2725:14:34:72:225:490:12:Times:12:Times:increases Sharpe ratios by 50%.

3:62:3137:0:34:72:205:735:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:I    Introduction
3:63:3154:34:21:72:526:701:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In  his  presidential  address,  Cochrane  (2011)  argues  the  cross  section  of  the  expected
3:64:3251:21:22:72:526:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:return “is once again descending into chaos”.  Harvey et al. (2016) identify more than 300
3:65:3341:22:22:72:524:658:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:published factors that have predictive power for the cross section of expected returns.1
3:66:3429:22:21:71:525:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Many economic models, such as the consumption CAPM of Lucas (1978), Breeden (1979),
3:67:3512:21:22:71:525:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and Rubinstein (1976), instead predict that only a small number of state variables suffice
3:68:3602:22:22:71:372:593:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to summarize cross-sectional variation in expected returns.
3:69:3661:22:21:95:525:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Researchers   typically   employ   two   methods   to   identify   return   predictors:(i)
3:70:3751:21:22:71:525:550:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(conditional)  portfolio  sorts  based  on  one  or  multiple  characteristics  such  as  size  or
3:71:3849:22:22:71:525:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:book-to-market, and (ii) linear regression in the spirit of Fama and MacBeth (1973).  Both
3:72:3939:22:21:71:525:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:methods have many important applications, but they fall short in what Cochrane (2011)
3:73:4024:21:22:71:525:485:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f5:calls the multidimensional challenge:  “[W]hich characteristics really provideindependent
3:74:4113:22:22:71:525:463:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:information about average returns?  Which are subsumed by others?”  Portfolio sorts are
3:75:4200:22:21:71:525:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:subject to the curse of dimensionality when the number of characteristics is large,  and
3:76:4288:21:22:71:524:420:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:linear regressions make strong functional-form assumptions and are sensitive to outliers.2
3:77:4378:22:22:71:525:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Cochrane (2011) speculates,  “To address these questions in the zoo of new variables,  I
3:78:4466:22:21:71:312:376:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:suspect we will have to use different methods.”
3:79:4513:21:22:95:525:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We propose a nonparametric method to determine which firm characteristics provide
3:80:4594:22:22:71:525:333:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:independent  information  for  the  cross  section  of  expected  returns  without  making
3:81:4684:22:21:71:525:311:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:strong functional-form assumptions.  Specifically, we use a group LASSO (least absolute
3:82:4771:21:22:71:525:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:shrinkage  and  selection  operator)  procedure  suggested  by  Huang,  Horowitz,  and  Wei
3:83:4862:22:22:71:525:268:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(2010)  for  model  selection  and  nonparametric  estimation.   Model  selection  deals  with
3:84:4956:22:21:71:525:246:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  question  of  which  characteristics  have  incremental  predictive  power  for  expected
3:85:5050:21:22:71:525:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:returns, given the other characteristics.  Nonparametric estimation deals with estimating
3:86:5139:22:22:71:525:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  effect  of  important  characteristics  on  expected  returns  without  imposing  a  strong
3:87:5235:22:21:71:157:181:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:functional-form.3
3:88:5252:21:18:95:525:160:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We  show  three  applications  of  our  proposed  framework.    First,  we  study  which
3:89:5340:18:12:85:367:142:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:1Figure 2 documents the number of discovered factors over time.
3:90:5403:12:16:85:525:130:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:2We discuss these, and related concerns in Section II and compare current methods with our proposed
3:91:5502:16:8:72:182:114:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:framework in Section III.
3:92:5527:8:0:85:347:106:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:3In our empirical application, we estimate quadratic splines.
4:93:5589:0:22:72:526:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:characteristics provide independent information for the cross section of expected returns.
4:94:5679:22:22:72:526:713:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We  estimate  our  model  on  36  characteristics  including  size,  book-to-market,  beta,  and
4:95:5775:22:21:72:526:691:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:other  prominent  variables  and  anomalies  on  a  sample  period  from  July  1963  to  June
4:96:5869:21:22:72:526:670:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2015.   Only  15  variables,  including  size,  idiosyncratic  volatility,  and  past  return-based
4:97:5968:22:22:72:526:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:predictors, have independent explanatory power for expected returns for the full sample
4:98:6055:22:21:72:526:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:period and all stocks.  An equally-weighted hedge portfolio going long the stocks with the
4:99:6145:21:22:72:526:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:10% highest expected returns and shorting the 10% of stocks with the lowest predicted
4:100:6230:22:22:72:526:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:returns  has  an  in-sample  Sharpe  ratio  of  close  to  3.   Only  eight  characteristics  have
4:101:6328:22:21:72:526:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:predictive power for returns in the first half of our sample.  In the second half, instead,
4:102:6419:21:22:72:526:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we find 17 characteristics are significantly associated with cross-sectional return premia.
4:103:6510:22:22:72:526:518:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:For stocks whose market capitalization is above the 20% NYSE size percentile, only seven
4:104:6598:22:21:72:526:496:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:characteristics, including size, past returns, and standardized unexplained volume, remain
4:105:6688:21:22:72:507:475:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:significant return predictors.  The in-sample Sharpe ratio is still 1.81 for large stocks.
4:106:6778:22:22:95:525:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Second, we compare the out-of-sample performance of the nonparametric model with
4:107:6858:22:21:72:526:431:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a linear model.  We estimate both models over a period until 1990 and select significant
4:108:6946:21:22:72:526:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:return predictors.  We then use 10 years of data to estimate the model on the selected
4:109:7032:22:22:72:526:388:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:characteristics.   In  the  first  month  after  the  end  of  our  estimation  period,  we  take  the
4:110:7134:22:21:72:526:366:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:selected characteristics, predict one-month-ahead returns, and construct a hedge portfolio
4:111:7224:21:22:72:526:345:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:similar to our in-sample exercise.  We roll the estimation and prediction period forward
4:112:7312:22:22:72:422:323:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:by one month and repeat the procedure until the end of the sample.
4:113:7378:22:21:95:525:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Specifically,  we  perform  model  selection  once  until  December  1990.Our  first
4:114:7462:21:22:72:526:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:estimation  period  is  from  December  of  1981  until  November  of  1990,  and  the  first
4:115:7555:22:22:72:524:258:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:out-of-sample prediction is for January 1991 using characteristics from December 1990.4
4:116:7642:22:21:71:525:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We  then  move  the  estimation  and  prediction  period  forward  by  one  month.The
4:117:7727:21:22:71:525:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nonparametric  model  generates  an  average  Sharpe  ratio  for  an  equally-weighted  hedge
4:118:7820:22:22:71:525:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:portfolio  of  3.42  compared  to  2.26  for  the  linear  model.5The  linear  model  selects
4:119:7913:22:21:71:525:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:21  characteristics  in  sample  compared  to  only  eight  for  the  nonparametric  model,  but
4:120:8009:21:18:71:525:150:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:performs  worse  out  of  sample.   Nonlinearities  are  important.   We  find  an  increase  in
4:121:8105:18:16:85:525:132:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:4We  merge  balance-sheet  variables  to  returns  following  the  Fama  and  French  (1993)  convention  of
4:122:8213:16:8:72:459:116:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:requiring a lag of at least six months, and our results are therefore indeed out of sample.
4:123:8304:8:0:85:512:108:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:5The linear model we estimate and the results for the linear model are similar to Lewellen (2015).
5:124:8403:0:22:72:526:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:out-of-sample  Sharpe  ratios  relative  to  the  Sharpe  ratio  of  the  linear  model  when  we
5:125:8500:22:22:72:526:713:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:employ the nonparametric model for prediction on the 21 characteristics the linear model
5:126:8588:22:21:72:526:691:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:selects.   The  linear  model  appears  to  overfit  the  data  in  sample.   We  find  an  identical
5:127:8689:21:22:72:526:670:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Sharpe ratio for the linear model when we use the eight characteristics we select with the
5:128:8779:22:22:72:495:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nonparametric model as we do with the 21 characteristics the linear model selects.
5:129:8861:22:21:95:525:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Third, we study whether the predictive power of characteristics for expected returns
5:130:8945:21:22:72:526:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:varies over time.  We estimate the model using 120 months of data on all characteristics we
5:131:9036:22:22:72:526:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:select in our baseline analysis, and then estimate rolling one-month-ahead return forecasts.
5:132:9128:22:21:72:526:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We find substantial time variation in the predictive power of characteristics for expected
5:133:9218:21:22:72:526:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:returns.  As an example, momentum returns conditional on other return predictors vary
5:134:9303:22:22:72:526:518:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:substantially over time, and we find a momentum crash similar to Daniel and Moskowitz
5:135:9388:22:21:72:526:496:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(2016) as past losers appreciated during the recent financial crisis.  Size conditional on the
5:136:9482:21:22:72:526:475:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:other selected return predictors, instead, has a significant predictive power for expected
5:137:9572:22:22:72:526:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:returns throughout our sample period similar to the findings in Asness, Frazzini, Israel,
5:138:9661:22:43:72:241:431:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Moskowitz, and Pedersen (2015).

5:140:9711:30:21:72:526:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) of Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965), and Mossin
5:141:9794:21:22:72:526:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(1966) predicts that an asset’s beta with respect to the market portfolio is a sufficient
5:142:9883:22:22:72:526:315:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:statistic  for  the  cross  section  of  expected  returns.   Fama  and  MacBeth  (1973)  provide
5:143:9980:22:21:72:526:293:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:empirical  support  for  the  CAPM.  Subsequently,  researchers  identified  many  variables,
5:144:10073:21:22:72:526:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:such as size (Banz (1981)), the book-to-market ratio (Rosenberg et al. (1985)), leverage
5:145:10161:22:22:72:526:250:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(Bhandari (1988)), earnings-to-price ratios (Basu (1983)), or past returns (Jegadeesh and
5:146:10250:22:21:72:526:228:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Titman  (1993))  that  contain  additional  independent  information  for  expected  returns.
5:147:10343:21:22:72:526:207:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Sorting stocks into portfolios based on these characteristics often led to rejection of the
5:148:10434:22:22:72:526:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:CAPM because the spread in CAPM betas could not explain the spread in returns.  Fama
5:149:10518:22:21:72:526:163:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and French (1992) synthesize these findings,  and Fama and French (1993) show that a
5:150:10602:21:22:72:526:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:three-factor model with the market return,  a size,  and a value factor can explain cross
5:151:10691:22:22:72:526:120:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sections of stocks sorted on characteristics that appeared anomalous relative to the CAPM.
5:152:10781:22:0:72:526:98:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In this sense, Fama and French (1993) and Fama and French (1996) achieve a significant
6:153:10868:0:22:72:526:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dimension reduction:  researchers who want to explain the cross section of stock returns
6:154:10956:22:22:72:312:713:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:only have to explain the size and value factors.
6:155:11004:22:21:95:525:691:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Daniel and Titman (1997),  on the contrary,  argue that characteristics have higher
6:156:11087:21:22:72:526:670:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:explanatory power for the cross section of expected returns than loadings on pervasive
6:157:11173:22:22:72:525:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:risk  factors.Chordia,  Goyal,  and  Shanken  (2015)  develop  a  method  to  estimate
6:158:11259:22:21:72:526:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bias-corrected return premia from cross-sectional data for individual stocks.  They find
6:159:11347:21:22:72:526:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firm  characteristics  explain  more  of  the  cross-sectional  variation  in  expected  returns
6:160:11443:22:22:72:526:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:compared  to  factor  loadings.   Kozak,  Nagel,  and  Santosh  (2015)  show  comovements  of
6:161:11536:22:21:72:526:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:stocks  and  associations  of  returns  with  characteristics  orthogonal  to  factor  exposures
6:162:11632:21:22:72:526:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:do not allow researchers to disentangle rational from behavioral explanations for return
6:163:11720:22:22:72:526:518:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:spreads.   We  study  which  characteristics  provide  incremental  information  for  expected
6:164:11814:22:21:72:526:496:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:returns but do not aim to investigate whether rational models or behavioral explanations
6:165:11902:21:22:72:165:475:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:drive our findings.
6:166:11921:22:22:95:525:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In the 20 years following the publication of Fama and French (1992), many researchers
6:167:12006:22:21:72:526:431:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:joined  a  “fishing  expedition”  to  identify  characteristics  and  factor  exposures  that  the
6:168:12104:21:22:72:526:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:three-factor model cannot explain.  Harvey, Liu, and Zhu (2016) provide an overview of
6:169:12190:22:22:72:526:388:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:this literature and list over 300 published papers that study the cross section of expected
6:170:12281:22:21:72:525:366:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:returns.  They propose at-statistic of 3 for new factors to account for multiple testing on
6:171:12372:21:22:72:526:345:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a  common  data  set.   Figure  3  shows  the  suggested  adjustment  over  time.   However,
6:172:12464:22:22:72:525:323:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:even  employing  the  higher  threshold  for  thet-statistic  still  leaves  approximately  150
6:173:12559:22:21:72:526:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:characteristics as useful predictors for the cross section of expected returns.  Fama and
6:174:12648:21:22:72:526:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:French  (2015)  take  a  different  route  and  augment  the  three-factor  model  of  Fama  and
6:175:12744:22:22:72:526:258:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:French  (1993)  with  an  investment  and  profitability  factor  (Haugen  and  Baker  (1996)
6:176:12837:22:21:72:526:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and Novy-Marx (2013)).  Fama and French (2016) test the five-factor model on a small
6:177:12921:21:22:72:526:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:set of anomalies and find substantial improvements relative to a three-factor model, but
6:178:13009:22:22:72:526:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:also substantial unexplained return variation across portfolios.  Hou et al. (2015) test a
6:179:13099:22:21:72:526:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:q-factor model consisting of four factors on 35 anomalies that are univariately associated
6:180:13189:21:22:72:526:150:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with cross-sectional return premia, and find their model can reduce monthly alphas to an
6:181:13277:22:22:72:526:128:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:average of 0.20%.  Barillas and Shanken (2016) develop a new method to directly compare
6:182:13364:22:0:72:201:106:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:competing factor models.
7:183:13389:0:22:95:525:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The  large  number  of  significant  predictors  is  not  a  shortcoming  of  Harvey  et  al.

7:185:13581:22:21:72:526:691:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:usually  consider  their  proposed  return  predictor  in  isolation  without  conditioning  on
7:186:13676:21:22:72:526:670:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:previously discovered return predictors.  Haugen and Baker (1996) and Lewellen (2015)
7:187:13761:22:22:72:526:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are notable exceptions.  They employ Fama and MacBeth (1973) regressions to combine
7:188:13844:22:21:72:526:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the information in multiple characteristics.  Lewellen (2015) jointly studies the predictive
7:189:13936:21:22:72:526:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:power of 15 characteristics and finds that only a few are significant predictors for the cross
7:190:14030:22:22:72:526:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:section of expected returns.  Green, Hand, and Zhang (2016) extend Lewellen (2015) to
7:191:14115:22:21:72:526:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:many  more  characteristics  for  a  shorter  sample  starting  in  1980,  but  confirm  his  basic
7:192:14214:21:22:72:526:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:conclusion.   Although  Fama-MacBeth  regressions  carry  a  lot  of  intuition,  they  do  not
7:193:14309:22:22:72:526:518:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:offer a formal method to select significant return predictors.  We build on Lewellen (2015)
7:194:14400:22:21:72:526:496:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and provide a framework that allows for nonlinear association between characteristics and
7:195:14489:21:22:72:526:475:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:returns,  provide a formal framework to disentangle significant from insignificant return
7:196:14578:22:22:72:322:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:predictors, and study many more characteristics.

7:205:15356:22:22:72:526:258:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of  Brandt  et  al.  (2009)  to  study  which  characteristics  provide  incremental  information
7:206:15453:22:21:72:526:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for  the  cross  section  of  returns.    Specifically,  DeMiguel  et  al.  (2016)  add  long-short
7:207:15552:21:22:72:526:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:characteristic-sorted portfolios to benchmark portfolios, such as the value-weighted market

7:210:15788:21:22:72:526:150:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:using  semi-  and  nonparametric  methods.   Bansal  and  Viswanathan  (1993)  extend  the
7:211:15878:22:22:72:526:128:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:arbitrage pricing theory (APT) of Ross (1976) and estimate the stochastic discount factor
7:212:15967:22:0:72:526:106:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:semiparametrically using neural nets.  They allow for payoffs to be nonlinear in risk factors
8:213:16061:0:22:72:526:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and find their APT is better able to explain the returns of size-sorted portfolios. Chapman
8:214:16152:22:22:72:526:713:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(1997) explains the size effect with a consumption-based model in which he approximates
8:215:16239:22:21:72:526:691:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  stochastic  discount  factor  with  orthonormal  polynomials  in  a  low  number  of  state
8:216:16335:21:22:72:526:670:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:variables.   Connor,  Hagmann,  and  Linton  (2012)  propose  a  nonparametric  regression
8:217:16425:22:22:72:526:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:method  relating  firm  characteristics  to  factor  loadings  in  a  nonlinear  way.   They  find
8:218:16523:22:21:72:526:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:momentum and stock volatility have explanatory power similar to size and value for the

8:224:17015:22:21:72:526:496:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:methods in finance are Huang and Shi (2016), who use an adaptive group LASSO in a
8:225:17096:21:22:72:526:475:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:linear framework and construct macro factors to test for determinants of bond risk premia.

8:237:18165:21:22:72:526:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:formal model selection, that is, which characteristics provide incremental information in

9:243:18543:29:22:72:526:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:One aim of the empirical asset-pricing literature is to identify characteristics that predict
9:244:18636:22:22:72:525:645:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:expected returns, that is, find a characteristicCin periodt−1 that predicts excess returns
9:245:18726:22:21:72:525:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of firmiin the following period,Rit.  Formally, we try to describe the conditional mean
9:246:18813:21:22:72:117:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:function,
9:247:18822:22:31:263:525:580:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:E[Rit|Cit−1].(1)
9:248:18838:31:22:95:525:549:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We often use portfolio sorts to approximate equation (1).  We typically sort stocks
9:249:18921:22:22:72:526:527:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:into 10 portfolios and compare mean returns across portfolios.  Portfolio sorts are simple,
9:250:19012:22:21:72:526:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:straightforward,  and  intuitive,  but  they  also  suffer  from  several  shortcomings.   First,
9:251:19109:21:22:72:526:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we can only use portfolio sorts to analyze a small set of characteristics.  Imagine sorting
9:252:19200:22:22:72:526:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:stocks jointly into five portfolios based on CAPM beta, size, book-to-market, profitability,
9:253:19292:22:21:72:525:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and investment.  We would end up with 55= 3125 portfolios,  which is larger than the
9:254:19376:21:22:72:525:419:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:number  of  stocks  at  the  beginning  of  our  sample.7Second,  portfolio  sorts  offer  little
9:255:19473:22:22:72:526:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:formal  guidance  to  discriminate  between  characteristics.   Consider  the  case  of  sorting
9:256:19569:22:21:72:526:375:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:stocks into five portfolios based on size, and within these, into five portfolios based on the
9:257:19663:21:22:72:526:354:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:book-to-market ratio.  If we now find the book-to-market ratio only leads to a spread in
9:258:19751:22:22:72:526:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:returns for the smallest stocks, do we conclude it does not matter for expected returns?
9:259:19839:22:21:72:526:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Fama and French (2008) call this second shortcoming “awkward.”  Third, we implicitly
9:260:19923:21:22:72:526:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:assume  expected  returns  are  constant  over  a  part  of  the  characteristic  distribution,
9:261:20018:22:22:72:526:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:such as the smallest 10% of stocks,  when we use portfolio sorts as an estimator of the
9:262:20105:22:21:72:524:245:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:conditional mean function. Fama and French (2008) call this third shortcoming “clumsy.”8
9:263:20193:21:22:71:525:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Nonetheless, portfolio sorts are by far the most commonly used technique to analyze which
9:264:20282:22:22:71:369:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:characteristics have predictive power for expected returns.
9:265:20341:22:18:95:525:180:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Instead of (conditional) double sorts, we could sort stocks into portfolios and perform
9:266:20428:18:16:85:525:162:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:7The curse of dimensionality is a well-understood shortcoming of portfolio sorts.  See Fama and French
9:267:20530:16:12:72:526:146:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:(2015) for a recent discussion in the context of the factor construction for their five-factor model.  They
9:268:20637:12:8:72:417:134:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:also argue not-well-diversified portfolios have little power in asset-pricing tests.
9:269:20721:8:16:85:525:126:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:8Portfolio  sorts  are  a  restricted  form  of  nonparametric  regression.   We  will  use  the  similarities  of
9:270:20835:16:0:72:513:110:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:portfolio sorts and nonparametric regressions to develop intuition for our proposed framework below.
10:271:20936:0:22:72:526:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:spanning tests, that is, we regress long-short portfolios on a set of risk factors.  Take 10
10:272:21028:22:22:72:526:713:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:portfolios  sorted  on  profitability  and  regress  the  hedge  return  on  the  three  Fama  and
10:273:21126:22:21:72:526:691:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:French (1993) factors.  A significant time-series intercept would correspond to an increase
10:274:21217:21:22:72:526:670:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in Sharpe ratios for a mean-variance investor relative to the investment set the three Fama
10:275:21308:22:22:72:526:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and  French  (1993)  factors  span  (see  Gibbons,  Ross,  and  Shanken  (1989)).   The  order
10:276:21402:22:21:72:526:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in  which  we  test  characteristics  matters,  and  spanning  tests  cannot  solve  the  selection
10:277:21501:21:22:72:526:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:problem of which characteristics provide incremental information for the cross section of
10:278:21590:22:22:72:161:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:expected returns.
10:279:21607:22:21:95:525:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:An alternative to portfolio sorts and spanning tests is toassumelinearity of equation

10:285:21802:42:22:71:525:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Linear regressions allow us to study the predictive power for expected returns of many
10:286:21888:22:21:71:525:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:characteristics  jointly,  but  they  also  have  potential  pitfalls.   First,  no  a  priori  reason
10:287:21990:21:22:71:525:411:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:explains why the conditional mean function should be linear.9Fama and French (2008)
10:288:22073:22:22:71:525:389:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:estimate linear regressions as in equation (2) to dissect anomalies, but raise concerns over
10:289:22165:22:21:71:525:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:potential  nonlinearities.   They  make  ad  hoc  adjustments  and  use,  for  example,  the  log
10:290:22262:21:22:71:525:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:book-to-market ratio as a predictive variable.  Second, linear regressions are sensitive to
10:291:22353:22:22:71:525:324:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:outliers.   Third,  small,  illiquid  stocks  might  have  a  large  influence  on  point  estimates
10:292:22453:22:21:71:525:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:because they represent the majority of stocks.  Researchers often use ad hoc techniques to
10:293:22543:21:22:71:525:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mitigate concerns related to microcaps and outliers, such as winsorizing observations and
10:294:22632:22:22:71:525:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:estimating linear regressions separately for small and large stocks (see Lewellen (2015) for
10:295:22724:22:21:71:165:237:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a recent example).
10:296:22742:21:22:95:525:216:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Cochrane (2011) synthesizes many of the challenges that portfolio sorts and linear
10:297:22824:22:22:71:525:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:regressions face in the context of many return predictors, and suspects “we will have to
10:298:22912:22:15:71:190:172:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:use different methods.”
10:299:22935:15:16:85:525:157:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:9Fama and MacBeth (1973) regressions also assume a linear relationship between expected returns and
10:300:23034:16:12:72:526:141:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:characteristics.  Fama-MacBeth point estimates are numerically equivalent to estimates from equation (2)
10:301:23138:12:0:72:264:129:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:when characteristics are constant over time.
11:302:23183:0:30:72:474:735:14:g_d0_f8:14:g_d0_f2:BEquivalence between Portfolio Sorts and Regressions
11:303:23235:30:21:72:526:705:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Cochrane (2011) conjectures in his presidential address, “[P]ortfolio sorts are really the
11:304:23325:21:22:72:526:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:same thing as nonparametric cross-sectional regressions, using nonoverlapping histogram
11:305:23412:22:22:72:526:662:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:weights.”   Additional  assumptions  are  necessary  to  show  a  formal  equivalence,  but  his
11:306:23508:22:21:72:526:640:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:conjecture contains valuable intuition to model the conditional mean function formally.
11:307:23595:21:22:72:526:619:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We first show a formal equivalence between portfolio sorts and regressions and then use
11:308:23682:22:22:72:403:597:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:the equivalence to motivate the use of nonparametric methods.10

13:422:26304:21:37:95:396:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Second, we could use the weighted least squares estimator,

13:430:26856:22:21:71:453:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with independent information for expected returns within that framework.
13:431:26928:21:40:95:525:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Suppose we knew the conditional mean functionmt(c)≡E[Rit|Cit−1=c].12Then,

13:438:27233:22:22:72:526:187:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:integrate the conditional mean function over the appropriate interval of the characteristic

13:440:27414:21:22:72:525:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:portfolio  returns.However,   knowingmt(c)  provides  additional  information  about
13:441:27498:22:18:72:526:122:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nonlinearities in the relationship between expected returns and characteristics, and the

14:451:27931:22:22:72:525:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:splines.  Estimating the conditional mean function,mt, with constant splines, means we

14:470:29377:22:21:95:525:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Finally,  we see in Figure 6 that portfolio means provide a better fit in the tails of
14:471:29463:21:22:72:526:150:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the distribution once we allow for more portfolios.  Portfolio mean returns become more
14:472:29550:22:18:72:526:128:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:comparable to the predictions from the nonparametric estimator the larger the number
14:473:29634:18:0:81:341:110:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:13We formally define our estimator in Section III.Dbelow.
15:474:29693:0:44:72:137:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of portfolios.

15:476:29764:29:22:72:526:662:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Both portfolio sorts and regressions theoretically allow us to look at several characteristics
15:477:29858:22:22:72:525:640:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:simultaneously.  Consider small (S) and big (B) firms and value (V) and growth (G) firms.
15:478:29947:22:21:71:525:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We  could  now  study  four  portfolios:  (SV),(SG),(BV),and  (BG).   However,  portfolio
15:479:30036:21:22:72:526:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sorts quickly become infeasible as the number of characteristics increases.  For example,
15:480:30125:22:22:72:526:575:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:if we have four characteristics and partition each characteristics into five portfolios, we
15:481:30216:22:21:72:525:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:end up with 54=  625 portfolios.  Analyzing 625 portfolio returns would,  of course,  be
15:482:30304:21:22:72:405:532:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:impractical, but would also result in poorly diversified portfolios.
15:483:30372:22:22:95:525:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In   nonparametric   regressions,   an   analogous   problem   arises.Estimating   the
15:484:30458:22:21:72:525:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:conditional mean functionmt(c)≡E[Rit|Cit=c] fully nonparametrically with many
15:485:30535:21:22:72:524:467:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:regressors  results  in  a  slow  rate  of  convergence  and  imprecise  estimates  in  practice.14
15:486:30634:22:22:72:525:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Specifically,  withScharacteristics  andNtobservations,  assuming  technical  regularity
15:487:30722:22:21:72:525:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:conditions, the optimal rate of convergence in mean square isN−4/(4+S)t, which is always
15:488:30810:21:22:72:525:402:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:smaller than the rate of convergence for the parametric estimator ofN−1t.  Notice the rate
15:489:30900:22:22:72:525:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of convergence decreases asSincreases.15Consequently, we get an estimator with poor
15:490:30983:22:21:72:399:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:finite sample properties if the number of characteristics is large.
15:491:31050:21:22:95:525:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:As an illustration, suppose we observe one characteristic, in which case, the rate of
15:492:31135:22:22:72:525:315:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:convergence isN−4/5t.  Now suppose instead we have 11 characteristics, and letN∗tbe the
15:493:31222:22:21:72:526:293:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:number of observations necessary to get the same rate of convergence as in the case with
15:494:31310:21:40:72:209:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:one characteristic.  We get,
15:495:31338:40:40:217:379:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9:(N∗t)−4/15=N−4/5t⇒N∗t=N3t.
15:496:31364:40:21:72:526:192:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Hence, in the case with 11 characteristics, we have to raise the sample size to the power
15:497:31453:21:22:72:526:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of 3 to obtain the same rate of convergence and comparable finite sample properties as
15:498:31539:22:18:72:525:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in the case with only one characteristic.  Consider a sample size,Nt, of 1,000.  Then, we
15:499:31628:18:15:81:525:131:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:14This literature refers to this phenomenon as the “curse of dimensionality” (see Stone (1982) for a
15:500:31728:15:9:72:153:116:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:formal treatment).
15:501:31746:9:0:81:444:107:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:15We assume the conditional mean functionmtis twice continuously differentiable.
16:502:31828:0:22:72:526:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:would need 1 billion return observations to obtain similar finite sample properties of an
16:503:31917:22:22:72:381:713:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:estimated conditional mean function with 11 characteristics.
16:504:31977:22:21:95:526:691:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Conversely, supposeS= 11 and we haveN∗t= 1,000 observations.  This combination
16:505:32055:21:22:71:525:670:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:yields similar properties as an estimation with one characteristic and a sample sizeNt=
16:506:32142:22:22:71:141:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(N∗t)1/3of 10.
16:507:32156:22:21:95:525:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Nevertheless,   if  we  are  interested  in  which  characteristics  provide  incremental
16:508:32245:21:22:71:525:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:information  for  expected  returns  given  other  characteristics,  we  cannot  look  at  each
16:509:32340:22:22:71:525:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:characteristic in isolation.  A natural solution in the nonparametric regression framework
16:510:32430:22:42:71:233:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is to assume an additive model,
16:511:32461:42:0:226:308:519:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:mt(c1,...,cS) =
16:512:32476:0:29:318:329:534:8:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f13:S∑
16:513:32478:29:0:313:328:505:8:g_d0_f11:8:g_d0_f4:s=1
16:514:32481:0:43:331:370:519:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:mts(cs),
16:515:32489:43:22:71:525:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wheremts(·)  are  unknown  functions.   The  main  theoretical  advantage  of  the  additive
16:516:32581:22:22:71:525:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:specification is that the rate of convergence is alwaysN−4/5t, which does not depend on
16:517:32668:22:21:71:525:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  number  of  characteristicsS(see  Stone  (1985),  Stone  (1986),  and  Horowitz  et  al.
16:518:32761:21:22:71:111:411:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(2006)).
16:519:32769:22:31:95:346:389:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:An important restriction of the additive model is
16:520:32818:31:17:247:329:358:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:∂2mt(c1,...,cS)

16:522:32840:0:39:333:351:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:= 0
16:523:32843:39:22:72:525:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for  alls6=s′;  therefore,  the  additive  model  does  not  allow  for  interactions  between
16:524:32937:22:21:71:525:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:characteristics; for example, the predictive power of the book-to-market ratio for expected
16:525:33028:21:22:71:525:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:returns does not vary with firm size.  One way around this shortcoming is to add certain
16:526:33116:22:22:71:525:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:interactions as additional regressors.  For instance, we could interact every characteristic
16:527:33208:22:22:71:525:223:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with size to see if small firms are really different.  An alternative solution is to estimate
16:528:33301:22:21:71:525:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  model  separately  for  small  and  large  stocks.   Brandt  et  al.  (2009)  make  a  similar
16:529:33400:21:22:71:525:180:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:assumption  but  also  stress  that  we  can  always  interpret  characteristicscas  the  cross
16:530:33495:22:22:72:305:158:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:product of a more basic set of characteristics.
16:531:33542:22:21:95:525:136:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Although the assumption of an additive model is somewhat restrictive, it provides
16:532:33623:21:0:72:526:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:desirable econometric advantages and is far less restrictive than assuming linearity right
17:533:33715:0:22:72:526:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:away as we do in Fama-MacBeth regressions.  Another major advantage of an additive
17:534:33797:22:22:72:526:713:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:model is that we can jointly estimate the model for a large number of characteristics, select
17:535:33890:22:21:72:526:691:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:important characteristics, and estimate the summands of the conditional mean function,
17:536:33976:21:44:72:314:670:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:mt, simultaneously, as we explain in SectionD.
17:537:34022:44:29:72:440:626:14:g_d0_f8:14:g_d0_f2:BComparison of Linear & Nonparametric Models
17:538:34066:29:22:72:526:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We now want to compare portfolio sorts and a linear model with nonparametric models
17:539:34149:22:22:72:526:575:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in some specific numerical examples.  The comparison helps us understand the potential
17:540:34235:22:21:72:526:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:pitfalls from assuming a linear relationship between characteristics and returns, and gain
17:541:34325:21:22:72:526:532:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:some intuition for why we might select different characteristics in a linear model in our
17:542:34414:22:22:72:217:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:empirical tests in Section V.

17:544:34523:21:22:72:525:467:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:according toCit−1∼U[0,1] fori= 1,...,Nandt= 1,...,Twith the data-generating

17:547:34625:31:22:72:193:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:whereE[εit|Cit−1] = 0.
17:548:34647:22:21:95:526:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Without  knowing  the  conditional  mean  functionmt,  we  could  sort  stocks  into
17:549:34731:21:22:72:525:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:portfolios  according  to  the  distribution  of  the  characteristic.Cit−1predicts  returns  if
17:550:34827:22:22:72:526:327:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mean  returns  differ  significantly  across  portfolios.   For  example,  we  could  construct  10
17:551:34926:22:21:72:526:305:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:portfolios based on the percentiles of the distribution and test if the first portfolio has a
17:552:35019:21:22:72:337:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:significantly different return than the 10thportfolio.
17:553:35073:22:22:95:525:262:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:If we knew the conditional mean functionmt, we could conclude thatCit−1predicts
17:554:35152:22:21:72:525:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:returns ifmtis not constant on [0,1].  Moreover, knowing the conditional mean function
17:555:35238:21:22:72:526:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:allows us to construct portfolios with a large spread in returns.  Instead of sorting stocks
17:556:35330:22:22:72:525:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:based on the values of the characteristicCit−1, we could sort stocks directly based on the
17:557:35420:22:21:72:525:175:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:conditional mean functionmt(Cit−1). For example, letqt(α) be theα-quantile ofmt(Cit−1)
17:558:35506:21:22:72:526:154:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and let stockibe in portfoliolat timetifmt(Cit−1)∈[qt((l−1)/10),qt(l/10)].  That
17:559:35586:22:22:72:526:132:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is, we construct 10 portfolios based on return predictions.  Portfolio 1 contains the 10%
17:560:35675:22:0:72:526:110:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of stocks with the lowest predicted returns, and portfolio 10 contains the 10% of stocks
18:561:35765:0:22:72:250:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with the highest predicted returns.
18:562:35800:22:22:95:525:713:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:Ifmtis monotoneand we only study a single characteristic, both sorting based on
18:563:35879:22:21:72:525:691:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the value of the characteristic and sorting based on predicted returnsmt(Cit−1) results in
18:564:35969:21:22:72:525:670:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the same portfolios.  However, ifmtis not monotone, the “10-1 portfolio” return is higher
18:565:36058:22:22:72:244:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:when we sort based onmt(Cit−1).
18:566:36089:22:21:95:525:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:As a simple example, supposemt(c) = (c−0.5)2.  Then the expected “10-1 portfolio”
18:567:36170:21:22:72:355:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:return when sorting based on characteristic,Cit−1, is 0.
18:568:36226:22:22:95:525:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We  now  consider  two  characteristics,C1,it−1∼U[0,1]  andC2,it−1∼U[0,1],  and
18:569:36305:22:39:72:306:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:assume the following data-generating process:
18:570:36350:39:40:201:395:522:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:Rit=mt1(C1,it−1) +mt2(C2,it−1) +εit,
18:571:36386:40:21:72:526:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:whereE[εit|C1,it−1,C2,it−1] = 0.  Again, we can construct portfolios with a large spread
18:572:36474:21:22:72:525:461:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in predicted returns based on the value of the conditional mean function,mt.  The idea is
18:573:36563:22:40:72:526:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:similar to constructing trading strategies based on the predicted values of a linear model,

18:575:36685:39:22:72:526:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We  will  now,  however,  illustrate  the  potential  pitfalls  of  the  linear  model  and  how  a
18:576:36784:22:22:72:282:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nonparametric model can alleviate them.

19:590:37620:21:22:71:525:670:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with the nonparametric method.  Nevertheless, the linear model is a good approximation
19:591:37706:22:22:71:525:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in this example, and the nonparametric method improves only marginally on the linear

19:597:37876:40:40:95:407:495:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Instead, now we study the following data-generating process:

20:646:39508:21:22:95:525:406:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Note that we do not know the true data-generating process,  and the linear model
20:647:39588:22:22:72:526:384:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:may provide a good or poor approximation.  Therefore, nonparametric methods are the
20:648:39671:22:21:72:147:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:natural choice.
20:649:39686:21:22:95:525:341:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In  a  last  example,  we  want  to  discuss  how  the  linear  and  nonparametric  models
20:650:39776:22:22:72:526:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:treat  nonlinear  transformations  of  variables.   This  example  helps  us  understand  why  a
20:651:39872:22:21:72:526:297:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:linear  model  might  select  more  variables  in  empirical  settings.   Consider  the  following
20:652:39970:21:22:72:196:276:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:data-generating process:
20:653:39994:22:31:229:368:254:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:Rit=C1,it−1+C2,it−1+εit,

20:655:40118:22:22:72:526:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:characteristic.   In  the  linear  model,  both  characteristics  are  important  to  describe  the
20:656:40217:22:21:72:525:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:conditional  mean  function,  whereas  in  the  nonparametric  model,mtis  a  function  of

20:658:40400:22:18:72:526:136:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:next to estimation, and these differences between the linear and the nonparametric model

21:660:40536:0:44:72:213:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:will play an important role.
21:661:40564:44:29:72:332:691:14:g_d0_f8:14:g_d0_f2:CNormalization of Characteristics
21:662:40597:29:22:72:526:662:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We now describe a suitable normalization of the characteristics, which will allow us to map
21:663:40688:22:22:72:526:640:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:our nonparametric estimator directly to portfolio sorts.  As before, define the conditional
21:664:40779:22:39:72:283:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mean functionmtforScharacteristics as
21:665:40816:39:40:165:431:579:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:mt(C1,it−1,...,CS,it−1) =E[Rit|C1,it−1,...,CS,it−1].
21:666:40868:40:21:72:525:539:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:For each characteristics, letFs,t(·) be a known strictly monotone function and denote its
21:667:40957:21:40:72:333:518:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:inverse byF−1s,t(·).  Define ̃Cs,it−1=Fs,t(Cs,it−1) and
21:668:41012:40:40:191:407:478:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9: ̃mt(c1,...,cS) =mt(F−11,t(c1),...,F−1S,t(cS)).
21:669:41059:40:21:72:102:438:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Then,
21:670:41064:21:32:174:422:417:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:mt(C1,it−1,...,CS,it−1) =   ̃mt( ̃C1,it−1,..., ̃CS,it−1).
21:671:41121:32:21:72:525:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Knowledge of the conditional mean functionmtis equivalent to knowing the transformed
21:672:41205:21:22:72:525:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:conditional  mean  function   ̃mt.   Moreover,  using  a  transformation  does  not  impose  any
21:673:41301:22:22:72:403:342:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:additional restrictions and is therefore without loss of generality.
21:674:41369:22:21:95:525:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Instead  of  estimatingmt,  we  will  estimate   ̃mtfor  a  rank  transformation  that  has
21:675:41460:21:22:72:526:299:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:desirable  properties  and  nicely  maps  to  portfolio  sorting.   When  we  sort  stocks  into
21:676:41556:22:22:72:526:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:portfolios,  we  are  typically  not  interested  in  the  value  of  a  characteristic  in  isolation,
21:677:41659:22:21:72:526:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:but rather in the rank of the characteristic in the cross section.  Consider firm size.  Size
21:678:41752:21:22:72:526:234:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:grows over time, and a firm with a market capitalization of USD 1 billion in the 1960s
21:679:41838:22:22:72:526:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:was considered a large firm, but today it is not.  Our normalization considers the relative
21:680:41929:22:21:72:489:190:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:size in the cross section rather than the absolute size, similar to portfolio sorting.
21:681:42015:21:22:95:525:169:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Hence,  we  choose  the  rank  transformation  ofCs,it−1such  that  the  cross-sectional
21:682:42103:22:22:72:525:147:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:distribution  of  a  given  characteristic  lies  in  the  unit  interval;  that  is,Cs,it−1∈[0,1].
21:683:42202:22:21:72:148:125:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Specifically, let
21:684:42219:21:0:226:297:104:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:Fs,t(Cs,it−1) =
21:685:42234:0:17:302:366:112:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rank(Cs,it−1)
21:686:42247:17:0:317:351:95:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:Nt+ 1
21:687:42252:0:0:367:370:104:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:.
22:688:42255:0:22:72:525:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9:Here,  rank(mini=1...,NtCs,it−1) = 1 and rank(maxi=1...,NtCs,it−1) =Nt.  Therefore,  theα
22:689:42344:22:22:72:525:713:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:quantile of ̃Cs,it−1isα.  We use this particular transformation because portfolio sorting
22:690:42433:22:21:72:293:691:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:maps into our estimator as a special case.18
22:691:42477:21:22:95:525:670:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Although knowingmtis equivalent to knowing   ̃mt, in finite samples, the estimates
22:692:42559:22:40:72:245:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the two typically differ; that is,
22:693:42596:40:39:191:407:608:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f9:̂mt(c1,...,cS)6=̂ ̃mt(F−11,t(c1),...,F−1S,t(cS)).
22:694:42645:39:22:72:526:569:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In  numerical  simulations  and  in  the  empirical  application,  we  found   ̃mtyields  better
22:695:42741:22:21:72:525:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:out-of-sample predictions thanmt.  The transformed estimator appears to be less sensitive
22:696:42830:21:22:72:526:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to outliers thanks to the rank transformation, which could be one reason for the superior
22:697:42919:22:22:72:212:504:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:out-of-sample performance.

22:702:43156:29:22:72:526:366:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We use a group LASSO procedure suggested by Huang et al. (2010) for estimation and

22:704:43328:21:22:72:526:323:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that is, for model selection.  To recap, we are interested in modeling excess returns as a

22:716:43982:15:0:72:263:113:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:to outliers and nicely addresses his concern.

23:718:44120:22:22:72:526:713:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:predict expected returns.  Therefore, the procedure achieves model selection;  that is, it

23:721:44315:22:22:95:525:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In  portfolio  sorts,  we  approximate   ̃mtsby  a  constant  within  each  portfolio.   We
23:722:44406:22:21:71:525:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:instead propose to estimate quadratic functions over parts of the normalized characteristic
23:723:44497:21:22:71:525:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:distribution.  Let 0 =t0< t1<···< tL−1< tL= 1 be a sequence of increasing numbers

23:725:44666:22:21:72:525:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the unit interval,  that is, ̃Il=  [tl−1,tl) forl=  1,...,L−1 and ̃IL=  [tL−1,tL].  We

23:728:44928:22:21:72:525:496:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f11:correspond to quantiles of the characteristic distribution and we can think of ̃Ilas thelth

23:742:45660:22:22:72:526:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:portfolio sorts can be interpreted as approximating the conditional mean function as a

23:744:45835:21:22:72:334:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:but follows a similar idea (see again Figures 4 – 6).

27:946:51524:22:21:72:526:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:function of the first characteristic when we fix the values of all other characteristics.  When
27:947:51619:21:22:72:526:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we set the other characteristics to different values, we change the level of the function,
27:948:51709:22:22:72:526:611:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:but not the slope.  We will report these functions in our empirical section,  and we can
27:949:51797:22:21:72:346:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:interpret both the level and the slope of the function.
27:950:51852:21:22:95:525:568:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:An  alternative  normalization  is   ̃m1(0.5)  =  0.   The  conditional  mean  function  for
27:951:51944:22:22:72:526:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a  characteristic  now  takes  the  value  of  0  for  the  median  observation.   Now,  we  cannot
27:952:52043:22:21:72:526:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:interpret the level of the function.  This normalization, however, is easier to interpret when
27:953:52137:21:22:72:526:503:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we plot the estimated functions over time in a three-dimensional surface plot.  Changes
27:954:52224:22:22:72:526:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in the slope over time now tell us the relative importance of the characteristic in the time
27:955:52316:22:21:72:526:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:series.  The first normalization has the disadvantage that in years with very low overall
27:956:52405:21:22:72:526:438:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:returns,  the  conditional  mean  function  is  much  lower.   Hence,  interpreting  the  relative
27:957:52503:22:22:72:526:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:importance of a characteristic over time from surface plots is more complicated when we
27:958:52590:22:51:72:210:394:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:use the first normalization.

30:1028:58153:22:22:72:526:713:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:or consumption-based models, as surveyed in Cochrane (2007), suggest a low number of
30:1029:58237:22:21:72:526:691:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:state variables can explain the cross section of returns.  Therefore, all characteristics are
30:1030:58330:21:22:72:408:670:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:unlikely to provide independent information for expected returns.

30:1042:59290:21:22:72:526:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2.  Portfolio sorts result in average annualized hedge portfolio returns of around 14%, 5%,
30:1043:59381:22:22:72:526:388:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:13%, and 6% for sorts on Q, return on assets, investment, and profitability, respectively.

30:1052:60205:22:22:72:526:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:functions  imply  Q,  return  on  assets,  investment,  and  profitability  have  no  marginal
30:1053:60299:22:21:72:510:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:predictive power for expected returns once we condition on other firm characteristics.
30:1054:60385:21:22:95:525:150:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The examples of Tobin’s Q, return-on-asset, profitability, and investment show the
30:1055:60467:22:22:72:526:128:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:importance  of  conditioning  on  other  characteristics  to  infer  on  the  predictive  power  of
30:1056:60566:22:0:72:526:106:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:characteristics for expected returns. We now study this question for 36 firm characteristics
31:1057:60660:0:22:72:245:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:using the adaptive group LASSO.
31:1058:60691:22:22:95:525:713:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Table 4 reports the selected characteristics of the nonparametric model for different
31:1059:60776:22:21:72:526:691:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:numbers  of  knots,  sets  of  firms,  and  sample  periods.   We  see  in  column  (1)  that  the
31:1060:60874:21:22:72:526:670:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:baseline estimation for all stocks over the full sample period using 14 knots selects 15 out
31:1061:60966:22:22:72:526:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the universe of 36 firm characteristics.  The assets-to-market cap,  total assets,  beta,

31:1065:61331:22:21:72:525:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:all provide incremental information conditional on all other selected firm characteristics.
31:1066:61422:21:22:95:525:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:When we allow for a wider grid in column (2) with only nine knots, we also select cash
31:1067:61508:22:22:72:526:518:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to total assets, free cash flow, intermediate momentum, and the average bid-ask spread.
31:1068:61595:22:21:72:526:496:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We instead select the same characteristics when we impose a finer grid and estimate the
31:1069:61682:21:22:72:382:475:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:group LASSO with 19 interpolation points (see column (3)).
31:1070:61740:22:22:95:525:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We estimate the nonparametric model only on large stocks above the 10%-,  20%-,
31:1071:61819:22:21:72:526:431:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and  50%-size  quintile  of  NYSE  stocks  in  columns  (3)  to  (5),  reducing  the  sample  size
31:1072:61917:21:22:72:526:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from  more  than  1  million  observations  to  around  300,000.   Assets-to-market  cap,  total

31:1074:62108:22:21:72:526:366:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for returns for a sample of firms above the 10%-size threshold compared to all stocks in
31:1075:62196:21:22:72:526:345:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:column (1), whereas operating accruals becomes a significant return predictor.  For firms
31:1076:62285:22:22:72:526:323:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:above the 20%-size threshold of NYSE firms, we also see capital intensity, earnings to price,
31:1077:62378:22:21:72:526:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lagged turnover, and momentum lose the predictive power, but intermediate momentum
31:1078:62460:21:22:72:526:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:becomes a significant return predictor.  For the largest firms, only seven characteristics
31:1079:62550:22:22:72:526:258:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:have significant incremental predictive power for expected returns,  including the book-
31:1080:62638:22:21:72:526:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to-market ratio, the closeness to the high price, past return-based predictors, SG&A to

31:1083:62861:22:21:72:526:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nonparametric model in both sub-samples separately to see whether the importance of
31:1084:62944:21:18:72:526:150:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:characteristics  for  predicted  returns  varies  over  time.   Only  eight  characteristics  have
31:1085:63042:18:16:81:525:132:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:22The number of knots increases with the sample size.  The penalty function instead increases in the
31:1086:63142:16:12:72:526:116:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:number of knots.  In the nonparametric model with nine knots, the penalty is proportional to 12 times
31:1087:63243:12:0:72:509:104:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:the number of selected characteristics, which is why we select fewer characteristics with more knots.
32:1088:63346:0:22:72:526:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:predictive  power  for  expected  returns  in  the  sample  until  1990.   All  the  characteristics
32:1089:63446:22:22:72:526:713:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we select in the first half of our sample still provide incremental information for expected
32:1090:63538:22:21:72:526:691:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:returns in the second half starting in 1991, but now nine additional characteristics gain
32:1091:63627:21:22:72:267:670:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:predictive power for expected returns.
32:1092:63665:22:22:95:525:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Size, the closeness to the previous 52-week high, short-term reversal, and standardized
32:1093:63752:22:21:72:526:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:unexplained  volume  are  the  most  consistent  return  predictors  across  different  sample
32:1094:63846:21:22:72:526:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:periods, number of interpolation points, and sets of firms. Table A.1 in the online appendix
32:1095:63938:22:22:72:376:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reports selected characteristics for additional specifications.
32:1096:64001:22:21:95:525:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Figure 9 and Figure 10 plot the conditional and unconditional mean functions for
32:1097:64081:21:22:72:526:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:short-term  reversal,  momentum,  size,  and  the  assets-to-market-cap  ratio.   We  see  in
32:1098:64174:22:22:72:526:518:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Figure  9  both  for  reversal  and  momentum  a  more  monotonic  association  between  the
32:1099:64266:22:21:72:526:496:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:characteristic distribution and expected returns once we condition on other characteristics
32:1100:64357:21:22:72:526:475:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in the right panel relative to the unconditional association in the left panels.  Size matters
32:1101:64451:22:22:72:526:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for  returns  for  all  firms  in  the  right  panel  of  Figure  9  and  the  conditional  association
32:1102:64554:22:21:72:526:431:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is more pronounced than the relationship in the left panel.  This finding is reminiscent
32:1103:64642:21:22:72:526:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of  Asness,  Frazzini,  Israel,  Moskowitz,  and  Pedersen  (2015),  who  argue  “size  matters,
32:1104:64738:22:22:72:526:388:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:if you control your junk”.  We see in the lower panels, the assets-to-market-cap ratio is
32:1105:64827:22:21:72:526:366:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:unconditionally positively associated with expected returns.  Once we condition on other
32:1106:64915:21:22:72:526:345:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:characteristics, though, the association flips sign, and stocks with a high ratio have lower
32:1107:65007:22:22:72:358:323:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:expected returns compared to stocks with a lower ratio.
32:1108:65062:22:21:95:525:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Figure 11 plots the conditional and unconditional mean functions for the book-to-
32:1109:65143:21:22:72:526:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:market ratio and idiosyncratic volatility.  Both book-to-market and idiosyncratic volatility
32:1110:65235:22:22:72:526:258:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:have  a  monotonic,  positive  unconditional  association  with  expected  returns  across  the
32:1111:65330:22:21:72:526:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:whole  characteristic  distribution.   Conditional  on  other  characteristics,  book-to-market
32:1112:65425:21:22:72:526:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:loses  the  predictive  power  for  returns  and  only  stocks  with  the  highest  idiosyncratic
32:1113:65522:22:22:72:328:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:volatility are significantly associated with returns.
32:1114:65575:22:21:95:525:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This section shows that many of the univariate significant return predictors do not
32:1115:65658:21:22:72:526:150:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:provide  incremental  predictive  power  for  expected  returns  once  we  condition  on  other
32:1116:65753:22:0:72:178:128:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:stock characteristics.
33:1117:65777:0:30:72:361:735:14:g_d0_f8:14:g_d0_f2:BTime Variation in Return Predictors
33:1118:65813:30:21:72:526:705:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:McLean  and  Pontiff  (2016)  document  substantial  variation  over  time  in  the  predictive
33:1119:65908:21:22:72:526:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:power  of  many  characteristics  for  expected  returns.   Figure  12  to  Figure  15  show  the
33:1120:66005:22:22:72:526:662:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:conditional mean function for our baseline nonparametric model for all stocks and nine
33:1121:66091:22:21:72:526:640:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:knots  over  time.   We  perform  model  selection  on  the  first  10  years  of  data.   We  then
33:1122:66190:21:22:72:526:619:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fix the selected characteristics and estimate the nonparametric model on a rolling basis
33:1123:66278:22:22:72:526:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:using 10 years of data.  We normalize the conditional mean function to equal 0 when the
33:1124:66365:22:21:72:490:575:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:normalized characteristic equals 0.5 (the median characteristic in a given month).
33:1125:66447:21:22:95:525:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We see in Figure 12 that the conditional mean function is non-constant throughout
33:1126:66528:22:22:72:526:532:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the   sample   period   for   lagged   market   cap.Small   firms   have   higher   expected
33:1127:66620:22:21:72:526:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:returns  compared  to  large  firms,  conditional  on  all  other  significant  return  predictors.
33:1128:66719:21:22:72:526:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Interestingly, the size effect seems largest during the end of our sample period, contrary
33:1129:66809:22:22:72:526:467:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to conventional wisdom (see Asness et al. (2015) for a related finding).  The bottom panel
33:1130:66899:22:21:72:526:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:shows  that  firms  with  higher  total  assets  have  higher  expected  returns  conditional  on
33:1131:66996:21:22:72:491:424:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:other firm characteristics, contrary to the unconditional association (see Table 2).
33:1132:67080:22:22:95:525:402:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We see in the top panel of Figure 13 that intermediate momentum has a significant
33:1133:67161:22:21:72:526:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:conditional association with expected returns throughout the sample period. Interestingly,
33:1134:67251:21:22:72:526:359:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:past intermediate losers tend to outperform once we condition on other characteristics.
33:1135:67338:22:22:72:526:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In the bottom panel,  we see momentum lost part of the predictive power for expected
33:1136:67422:22:21:72:526:315:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:returns in the more recent period because of high returns of past losers, consistent with
33:1137:67511:21:22:72:283:294:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:findings in Daniel and Moskowitz (2016).
33:1138:67551:22:22:95:525:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Figure  14  shows  the  effect  of  long-term  reversal  on  expected  returns  has  been
33:1139:67640:22:21:72:526:250:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:strongest in the modern sample period because past losers tend to appreciate more than
33:1140:67726:21:22:72:526:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:they did historically.  The bottom panel shows the association of idiosyncratic volatility
33:1141:67816:22:22:72:526:207:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and returns has been flat until the early 1990s and only afterwards did stocks with the
33:1142:67903:22:21:72:526:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:highest  level  of  idiosyncratic  volatility  earn  substantially  higher  returns  than  all  other
33:1143:68004:21:0:72:106:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:stocks.
34:1144:68013:0:30:72:470:735:14:g_d0_f8:14:g_d0_f2:COut-of-Sample Performance and Model Comparison
34:1145:68060:30:21:72:526:705:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We argued in Section II that the nonparametric method we propose overcomes potential
34:1146:68144:21:22:72:526:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:shortcomings of more traditional methods, and show potential advantages of the adaptive
34:1147:68231:22:22:72:222:662:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:group LASSO in simulations.
34:1148:68258:22:21:95:525:640:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We now want to compare the performance of the nonparametric model with the linear
34:1149:68339:21:22:72:526:619:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:model out of sample.  The out-of-sample context ensures that in-sample overfit does not
34:1150:68426:22:22:72:439:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:explain a potentially superior performance of the nonparametric model.
34:1151:68496:22:21:95:525:575:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We  estimate  the  nonparametric  model  for  a  period  from  1963  to  1990  and  carry
34:1152:68585:21:22:72:526:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:out model selection with the adaptive group LASSO with nine knots,  but also use the
34:1153:68669:22:22:72:526:532:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:adaptive LASSO for model selection in the linear model over the same sample period and
34:1154:68755:22:21:72:526:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with  the  same  number  of  knots.   We  then  use  10  years  of  data  to  estimate  the  model
34:1155:68853:21:22:72:526:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on the selected characteristics.  In the next months, we take the selected characteristics
34:1156:68943:22:22:72:526:467:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and predict one-month-ahead returns and construct a hedge portfolio going long stocks
34:1157:69028:22:21:72:526:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with the 10% highest predicted returns and shorting stocks with the 10% lowest predicted
34:1158:69116:21:22:72:526:424:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:returns.  We roll the estimation and prediction period forward by one month and repeat
34:1159:69202:22:22:72:288:402:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the procedure until the end of the sample.
34:1160:69244:22:21:95:525:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Specifically, in our first out-of-sample predictions, we use return data from January
34:1161:69329:21:22:72:526:359:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:1981 until December 1990 and characteristics data from December 1980 until November
34:1162:69412:22:22:72:525:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:1990 to get estimatorsˆβ.23We then take the estimated coefficients and characteristics
34:1163:69498:22:21:72:526:315:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:data  from  January  1981  until  December  1990  to  predict  returns  for  January  1991  and
34:1164:69593:21:22:72:526:294:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:form two portfolios for each method.  We buy the stocks with the 10% highest expected
34:1165:69678:22:22:72:526:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:returns  and  sell  the  stocks  with  the  10%  lowest  predicted  returns.   We  then  move  our
34:1166:69776:22:21:72:526:250:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:estimation sample forward by one month from February 1981 until January 1991, get new
34:1167:69861:21:22:72:341:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:estimatorsˆβ, and predict returns for February 1991.
34:1168:69913:22:22:95:525:207:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Table 5 reports the out-of-sample Sharpe ratios for both the nonparametric and linear
34:1169:69998:22:21:72:526:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:models for different sample periods,  number of knots,  and equally- and value-weighted
34:1170:70085:21:22:72:526:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:portfolios.   For  a  sample  from  1991  to  2014  and  nine  knots,  the  nonparametric  model
34:1171:70181:22:18:72:526:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:generates an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio for an equally-weighted hedge portfolio of 3.42
34:1172:70268:18:15:81:525:124:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:23To be more precise, for returns until June 1981, many of the balance-sheet variables will be from the
34:1173:70371:15:0:72:185:109:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:fiscal year ending in 1979.
35:1174:70400:0:22:72:525:735:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:compared to 2.26 for the linear model (compare columns (1) and (3)).24The linear model
35:1175:70486:22:22:72:526:713:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:selects 21 characteristics in sample compared to only eight for the nonparametric model,
35:1176:70574:22:21:72:255:691:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:but performs worse out of sample.25
35:1177:70609:21:22:95:525:670:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We see a substantial drop in out-of-sample Sharpe ratios both for the nonparametric
35:1178:70692:22:22:71:525:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and linear model when we study value-weighted portfolios (see columns (2) and (4)).  The
35:1179:70780:22:21:71:525:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:difference  in  Sharpe  ratios  between  value-  and  equally-weighted  portfolios  is  similar  to
35:1180:70879:21:22:71:525:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Lewellen (2015), who finds Sharpe ratios of value-weighted portfolios 50% smaller than
35:1181:70965:22:22:71:525:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the equally-weighted counterpart.  Most studies in empirical finance winsorize the data,
35:1182:71053:22:21:71:525:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:including size.  When we winsorize size at the 1% and 5% levels, we find out-of-sample
35:1183:71139:21:22:71:525:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:value-weighted Sharpe ratios of 1.38 and 1.73 for the nonparametric model (results not
35:1184:71225:22:22:71:122:518:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reported).
35:1185:71235:22:21:95:525:496:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Column  (5)  studies  a  linear  model  that  also  employs  the  rank  transformation  we
35:1186:71325:21:22:71:525:475:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:discuss  in  Section  III.  The  linear  model  now  selects  even  27  of  the  36  characteristics,
35:1187:71426:22:22:71:525:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:but  the  out-of-sample  Sharpe  ratio  is  similar  to  the  linear  model  for  non-transformed
35:1188:71523:22:21:71:147:431:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:characteristics.
35:1189:71539:21:22:95:525:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Nonlinearities  are  important.   We  find  an  increase  in  out-of-sample  Sharpe  ratios
35:1190:71630:22:22:71:525:388:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relative to the Sharpe ratio of the linear model when we employ the nonparametric model
35:1191:71717:22:21:71:525:366:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for  prediction  on  the  21  characteristics  the  linear  model  selects  (see  column  (6)).   The
35:1192:71818:21:22:71:525:345:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:linear model appears to overfit the data in sample.  The Sharpe ratio for the linear model
35:1193:71908:22:22:71:525:323:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:when we use the eight characteristics we select with the nonparametric model is identical
35:1194:71997:22:21:71:525:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to the one we find when we use the 21 characteristics the linear model selects (see column
35:1195:72087:21:22:71:94:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(7)).
35:1196:72092:22:22:95:525:258:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We see in columns (8) and (9) that Sharpe ratios drop by more than 50% for both
35:1197:72171:22:21:71:525:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:models when we exclude firms below the 10thpercentile of NYSE stocks (around 200,000
35:1198:72255:21:22:71:525:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firm-months observations out of 650,000).  Lewellen (2015) also finds Sharpe ratios for an
35:1199:72345:22:22:71:525:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equally-weighted hedge portfolio that are lower by 50% when he excludes “all but tiny
35:1200:72430:22:18:71:525:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:stocks.”   Columns  (10)  to  (12)  show  Sharpe  ratios  larger  than  3  for  an  out-of-sample
35:1201:72527:18:16:81:525:153:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:24The linear model we estimate and the results are similar to Lewellen (2015).  Specifically, he finds
35:1202:72629:16:12:72:526:137:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:for a linear model out-of-sample Sharpe ratios of 1.65 and 0.85 for equally- and value-weighted hedge
35:1203:72730:12:8:72:312:125:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:portfolios and an out-of-sample period of 1974 to 2013.
35:1204:72785:8:16:81:525:117:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:25The  linear  model  might  be  misspecified  and  therefore  select  more  variables  (see  discussion  and
35:1205:72894:16:0:72:217:101:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:simulation results in Section III).

36:1207:73022:22:22:72:526:713:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:our baseline sample starting in 1991, or using 4 or 14 knots rather than 9 as in column
36:1208:73109:22:21:72:90:691:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(1).
36:1209:73113:21:22:95:525:670:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We also studied whether the return forecasts of the nonparametric model actually
36:1210:73193:22:22:72:526:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:picks up cross-sectional variation in ex-post realized returns at the firm level.  A return
36:1211:73284:22:21:72:526:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:estimate  that  provides  an  unbiased  forecast  of  returns  should  predict  ex-post  returns
36:1212:73380:21:22:72:526:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with a slope of 1.  For all stocks and a sample from 1991 until 2014, we find the return
36:1213:73468:22:22:72:526:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:forecasts from the nonparametric model have a slope estimate of 0.78 and explain 3.11%
36:1214:73554:22:21:72:526:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the ex-post variation in returns at the firm level.  These estimates compare favorably
36:1215:73643:21:51:72:507:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to Lewellen (2015), who typically finds smaller point estimates andR2s of below 1%.
36:1216:73726:51:34:72:206:489:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:VI    Conclusion
36:1217:73742:34:21:72:526:455:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We propose a nonparametric method to tackle the challenge posed by Cochrane (2011)
36:1218:73824:21:22:72:526:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in  his  presidential  address,  namely,  which  firm  characteristics  provide  independent
36:1219:73916:22:22:72:526:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:information for expected returns.  We use the adaptive group LASSO to select significant
36:1220:74004:22:21:72:301:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:return predictors and to estimate the model.
36:1221:74048:21:22:95:525:369:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We  document  the  properties  of  our  framework  in  three  applications:   (i)  Which
36:1222:74136:22:22:72:526:347:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:characteristics  have  incremental  forecasting  power  for  expected  returns?   (ii)  Does  the
36:1223:74233:22:21:72:526:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:predictive  power  of  characteristics  vary  over  time?   (iii)  How  does  the  nonparametric
36:1224:74329:21:22:72:320:304:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:model compare to a linear model out of sample?
36:1225:74375:22:22:95:525:282:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our  results  are  as  follows:   (i)  Out  of  36  characteristics,  only  7  to  15  provide
36:1226:74469:22:21:72:526:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:independent  information  depending  on  the  number  of  interpolation  points  (similar  to
36:1227:74562:21:22:72:526:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the number of portfolios in portfolio sorts), sample period, and universe of stocks (large
36:1228:74652:22:22:72:526:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:versus small stocks).  (ii) Substantial time variation is present in the predictive power of
36:1229:74744:22:21:72:526:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:characteristics.  (iii) The nonparametric model selects fewer characteristics than the linear
36:1230:74837:21:22:72:414:174:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:model in sample and has a 50% higher Sharpe ratio out of sample.
36:1231:74901:22:22:95:525:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We see our paper as a starting point only and ask the following questions.  Are the
