2:32:1718:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:We extend the basic (representative-household) New Keynesian [NK] model of the monetary transmission
2:33:1818:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:mechanism to allow for a spread between the interest rate available to savers and borrowers, that can
2:34:1919:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:vary for either exogenous or endogenous reasons. We find that the mere existence of a positive average
2:35:2021:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:spread makes little quantitative difference for the predicted effects of particular policies. Variation
2:36:2124:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:in spreads over time is of greater significance, with consequences both for the equilibrium relation
2:37:2224:14:28:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:between the policy rate and aggregate expenditure and for the relation between real activity and inflation.
2:38:2331:28:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:Nonetheless, we find that the target criterion—a linear relation that should be maintained between
2:39:2429:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:F:the inflation rate and changes in the output gap—that characterizes optimal policy in the basic NK
2:40:2527:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:F:model continues to provide a good approximation to optimal policy, even in the presence of variations
2:41:2628:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:F:in credit spreads. Such a "flexible inflation target" can be implemented by a central-bank reaction
2:42:2727:14:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:F:function that is similar to a forward-looking Taylor rule, but adjusted for changes in current and expected
2:43:2834:14:42:72:173:420:12:Times:12:Times:C:future credit spreads.

3:56:3143:0:30:72:208:687:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:1    Introduction
3:57:3160:30:18:72:540:657:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:It is common for theoretical evaluations of alternative monetary policies — most notably,
3:58:3249:18:18:72:540:639:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the literature that provides theoretical foundations for inflation targeting — to be conducted
3:59:3343:18:18:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:using models of the monetary transmission mechanism that abstract altogether from financial
3:60:3434:18:18:72:539:603:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:frictions.1There is generally assumed to be a single interest rate — “theinterest rate” —
3:61:3523:18:18:72:540:585:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that is at once the policy rate that constitutes the operating target for the central bank, the
3:62:3618:18:18:72:540:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rate of return that all households and firms receive on savings, and the rate at which anyone
3:63:3711:18:18:72:540:549:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:can borrow against future income.  In models with more complete theoretical foundations,
3:64:3799:18:18:72:540:531:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this  is  justified  by  assuming  frictionless  financial  markets,  in  which  all  interest  rates  (of
3:65:3905:18:18:72:540:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:similar maturity) must be equal in order for arbitrage opportunities not to exist.  It is also
3:66:3999:18:17:72:540:495:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:common to assume a representative household, and firms that maximize the value of their
3:67:4086:17:18:72:540:478:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:earnings streams to that household, so that there is no need for credit flows in equilibrium in
3:68:4181:18:18:72:540:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:any event; such models imply that a breakdown of credit markets would have no allocative
3:69:4269:18:18:72:540:442:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:significance.  Many of the quantitative DSGE models developed in central banks and other
3:70:4357:18:18:72:442:424:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:policy institutions before the recent financial crisis share these features.2
3:71:4434:18:18:89:539:406:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Such models abstract from important complications of actual economies, even those that
3:72:4520:18:18:71:539:388:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are  financially  quite  sophisticated.   Sizeable  spreads  exist,  on  average,  between  different
3:73:4621:18:18:71:539:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interest rates;  moreover, these spreads are not constant over time, especially in periods of
3:74:4714:18:18:71:539:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:financial stress.  And “tighter” financial conditions, indicated by increases in the size of credit
3:75:4813:18:18:71:539:334:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spreads, are commonly associated with lower levels of real expenditure and employment. This
3:76:4904:18:18:71:539:316:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:poses obvious questions for the practical application of much work in the theory of monetary
3:77:4996:18:18:71:539:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:policy.3If  a  model  is  to  be  calibrated  or  estimated  using  time  series  data,  which  actual
3:78:5098:18:18:71:539:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interest rate should be taken to correspond to “the interest rate” in the model?  When the
3:79:5188:18:18:71:539:262:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model is used to to give advice about how interest rates should respond to a particular type
3:80:5280:18:17:71:539:244:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of shock, which actual interest rate (if any) should be made to respond in the way that “the
3:81:5372:17:18:71:539:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interest rate” does in the model?  How large an error is likely to be made by abstracting from
3:82:5466:18:18:71:539:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:credit frictions, with regard to the model’s predictions for the variables that appear in it?
3:83:5559:18:18:71:539:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Moreover, some questions clearly cannot even be addressed using models that abstract from
3:84:5648:18:18:71:539:173:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:credit frictions.  Most notably, how should a central bank respond to a “financial shock” that
3:85:5742:18:18:71:393:155:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increases the size of the spreads resulting from credit frictions?
3:86:5808:18:18:89:539:137:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This paper seeks to address these questions by presenting a simple extension of the basic
3:87:5897:18:12:85:534:119:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:A:1See, for example,Clarida, Gali and Gertler(1999) orWoodford(2003), among many other references.
3:88:5993:12:12:85:480:107:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:A:2The models ofSmets and Wouters(2003,2007) provide an especially influential example.
3:89:6078:12:15:85:539:95:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:3The pre-crisis generation of DSGE models was criticized on this ground byIssing(2006) andGoodhart
3:90:6176:15:0:71:166:80:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:(2007), among others.
4:91:6242:0:18:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:“New Keynesian” model (as developed, for example, in Woodford,2003) in which a credit
4:92:6327:18:18:72:540:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:friction is introduced, allowing for a time-varying wedge between the interest rate available to
4:93:6423:18:18:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:households on their savings and the interest rate at which it is possible to borrow.  Financial
4:94:6518:18:18:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intermediation matters for the allocation of resources due to the introduction of heterogeneity
4:95:6613:18:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the spending opportunities currently available to different households.  While the model
4:96:6704:18:18:72:540:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:remains  highly  stylized,  it  has  the  advantage  of  nesting  the  basic  New  Keynesian  model
4:97:6803:18:18:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(extensively used in normative monetary policy analysis) as a special case, and of introducing
4:98:6897:18:18:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:only  a  small  number  of  additional  parameters,  the  consequences  of  which  for  conclusions
4:99:6996:18:18:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:about  the  monetary  transmission  mechanism  and  the  character  of  optimal  policy  can  be
4:100:7092:18:18:72:540:525:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:thoroughly explored.  The approach taken also seeks to develop a tractable model, with as
4:101:7181:18:18:72:540:507:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:small a state space as is consistent with an allowance for financial frictions and heterogeneity,
4:102:7278:18:18:72:496:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and hence only modestly greater complexity than the basic New Keynesian model.
4:103:7356:18:17:89:539:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Among the questions to be addressed are the following:  If the parameters determining
4:104:7441:17:18:72:540:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the degree of heterogeneity and the size of credit frictions are calibrated so as to match both
4:105:7536:18:18:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the volume of bank credit and the spread between bank deposit and lending rates in the US
4:106:7625:18:18:72:540:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:economy, how much of a difference does this make (relative to the frictionless baseline) for
4:107:7717:18:18:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the model’s predictions for the response of the economy to various types of shocks, under a
4:108:7808:18:18:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:given monetary policy rule?  How much of a difference does it make for the implied responses
4:109:7900:18:18:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to  real  disturbances  under  an  optimal  monetary  policy?   How  much  of  a  difference  does
4:110:7998:18:18:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:it make for the form of the quadratic stabilization objective that would correspond to the
4:111:8088:18:18:72:540:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:maximization of average expected utility?  How much of a difference does it make for the
4:112:8176:18:18:72:540:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:form  of  the  optimal  target  criterion  for  monetary  stabilization  policy?   And  how  should
4:113:8275:18:18:72:319:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:policy optimally respond to a “financial shock”?
4:114:8323:18:18:89:539:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The model also provides perspective on “rules of thumb” for policy in times of financial
4:115:8411:18:18:72:539:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:turmoil  proposed  in  the  recent  literature.   For  example,McCulley  and  Toloui(2008)  and
4:116:8506:18:18:71:540:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Taylor(2008) propose that the intercept term in a “Taylor rule” for monetary policy should
4:117:8596:18:17:71:539:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be adjusted downward in proportion to observed increases in spreads.4Here we use our simple
4:118:8687:17:18:71:539:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model to ask whether it is correct to say that the “natural” or “neutral” rate of interest is
4:119:8780:18:18:71:539:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lower when credit spreads increase (assuming unchanged fundamentals otherwise),  and to
4:120:8867:18:18:71:539:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the extent that it is, how the size of the change in the natural rate compares to the size of
4:121:8960:18:18:71:539:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the change in credit spreads.  We also ask whether it is approximately correct to say that
4:122:9050:18:18:71:539:131:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a proper response to a “financial shock” is to conduct policy according to the same rule as
4:123:9141:18:16:85:539:113:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:4Similarly, Meyer and Sack (2008) propose, as a possible account of recent U.S. Federal Reserve policy,

4:125:9349:12:12:72:540:85:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:been adjusted downward in response to credit market turmoil,  and use the size of increases in spreads in
4:126:9454:12:0:72:414:73:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:early 2008 as a basis for a proposed magnitude of the appropriate adjustment.
5:127:9576:0:18:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:under other circumstances, except with the operating target for the policy rate adjusted by a
5:128:9669:18:18:72:540:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:factor that is proportional to the increase in credit spreads; and again, to the extent that such
5:129:9766:18:18:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an approximation is used, we ask what proportion of adjustment should be made.  C ́urdia
5:130:9854:18:18:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  Woodford  (2010)  use  the  framework  presented  in  this  paper  to  evaluate  the  positive
5:131:9953:18:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and normative consequences of adopting the proposals of McCulley and Toloui(2008) and
5:132:10038:18:18:72:540:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Taylor(2008) and find that an adjustment for variations in credit spreads can improve upon
5:133:10128:18:18:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the standard Taylor rule, but the optimal size (and direction) of adjustment depends on the
5:134:10219:18:18:72:278:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:source of the variation in credit spreads.
5:135:10261:18:18:89:539:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Other  authors  have  argued  that  if  financial  disturbances  are  an  important  source  of
5:136:10356:18:18:72:540:525:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:macroeconomic instability, a sound approach to monetary policy will have to pay attention
5:137:10445:18:18:72:540:507:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to  the  balance  sheets  of  financial  intermediaries.   It  is  sometimes  suggested  that  policy
5:138:10546:18:18:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:should  respond  to  variations  in  the  growth  rate  of  monetary  or  credit  aggregates,  rather
5:139:10647:18:17:72:540:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:than — as in the case of both the Taylor rule and conventional prescriptions for “flexible
5:140:10737:17:18:72:540:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:inflation  targeting”  —  seeking  to  determine  the  appropriate  level  of  short-term  interest
5:141:10836:18:18:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rates purely on the basis of observations of or projections for measures of inflation and real
5:142:10930:18:18:72:540:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:activity.  Here we consider two possible interpretations of such proposals:  as an argument
5:143:11021:18:18:72:539:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fortargetingmonetary  and/or  credit  aggregates,  or  at  least  adopting  a  target  criterion
5:144:11117:18:18:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that  involves  such  variables  along  with  others;  or  as  an  argument  for  their  special  value
5:145:11220:18:18:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:asindicators,so that such variables should receive substantial weight in the central bank’s
5:146:11311:18:18:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reaction  function.   We  address  the  first  issue  by  deriving  an  optimal  target  criterion  for
5:147:11414:18:18:72:540:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:monetary policy, under certain simplifying assumptions, and seeing to what extent it involves
5:148:11507:18:18:72:540:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:either money or credit.  We address the second issue, under assumptions that are arguably
5:149:11596:18:18:72:540:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more  realistic,  by  computing  the  optimal  responses  to  shocks,  and  asking  what  kinds  of
5:150:11695:18:18:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:indicator variables would allow a simple rule of thumb to bring about equilibrium responses
5:151:11786:18:18:72:134:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of this kind.
5:152:11799:18:18:89:539:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Of course, we are not the first to investigate ways in which New Keynesian [NK] models
5:153:11885:18:17:72:540:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:can be extended to allow for financial frictions of one type or another.  A number of authors
5:154:11978:17:18:72:540:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have analyzed DSGE models with financial frictions of one type or another before the recent
5:155:12069:18:18:72:540:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:financial crisis.5Many of the best-known contributions introduce obstacles to the willingness
5:156:12162:18:16:85:539:167:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:5Probably the most influential early example was the model ofBernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist(1999).
5:157:12261:16:12:72:539:151:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:More recent contributions includeChristiano, Motto and Rostagno(2003,2010),Christiano et al.(2008),
5:158:12360:12:12:72:540:139:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:Gertler,  Gilchrist  and  Natalucci(2007),  andIacoviello(2005).Faia  and  Monacelli(2007)  consider  how
5:159:12465:12:12:71:539:127:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:two  different  types  of  financial  frictions  affect  welfare-based policy  evaluation,  though  from  a  perspective
5:160:12585:12:12:71:539:115:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:somewhat different than the one taken here; they compare alternative simple rules, rather than computing
5:161:12689:12:12:71:539:103:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:optimal  policy,  as  we  do,  and  compute  the  welfare  associated  with  a  particular  rule  under  a  complete
5:162:12805:12:12:71:539:91:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:specification  of  shocks,  rather  than  considering  what  a  given  simple  rule  implies  about  the  equilibrium
5:163:12922:12:0:71:539:79:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:responses  to  shocks  considered  individually.C ́urdia(2008)  considers  optimal  policy  in  the  spirit  of  the
6:164:13083:0:18:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of savers to lend to borrowers, but assume that borrowers directly borrow from the suppliers
6:165:13175:18:18:72:540:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of savings.  The recent financial crisis increased interest in models like ours that explicitly
6:166:13270:18:18:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:introduce intermediaries and allow for a spread between the interest received by savers and
6:167:13361:18:18:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that  paid  by  borrowers;  early  contributions  includeHulsewig,  Mayer  and  Wollmershauser
6:168:13455:18:18:72:539:615:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:(2009),Teranishi(2008),Sudo and Teranishi(2008), andGerali, Neri and Signoretti(2008).6
6:169:13542:18:18:89:539:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:More  recently,Gertler  and  Kiyotaki(2010)  also  seek  to  provide  a  canonical  model  of
6:170:13635:18:18:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:credit market frictions and economic activity.  Their work extends the “financial accelerator”
6:171:13729:18:18:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:framework to the case in which financial intermediaries themselves are exposed to the risk of
6:172:13822:18:18:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:default and thus face constraints on their ability to attract deposits (unlikeBernanke, Gertler
6:173:13917:18:18:72:539:525:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and Gilchrist,1999).  Gertler and Kiyotaki use this model to discuss the consequences to
6:174:14005:18:18:72:540:507:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:real activity in the case of an imperfect interbank market, in which the banks cannot fully
6:175:14096:18:18:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:offset their risk exposure by pooling their loans.  Their analysis is similar in spirit to ours
6:176:14191:18:17:72:539:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:but less focused on monetary policy.  Related recent contributions include those ofMeh and
6:177:14281:17:18:72:474:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Moran(2010),Kiyotaki and Moore(2012), andJermann and Quadrini(2012).
6:178:14349:18:18:89:539:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In general,  these models are fairly complex,  in the interest of microfoundation and/or
6:179:14437:18:18:72:540:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quantitative realism, and the results obtained are mostly numerical.  Our aim here is some-
6:180:14528:18:18:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:what different.  While the interest of such analyses is clear, especially to policy institutions
6:181:14624:18:18:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:seeking quantitative estimates of the effects of particular contemplated actions, we believe
6:182:14716:18:18:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that it is also valuable to seek analytical insights of the kind that can only be obtained from
6:183:14811:18:18:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:analyses of simpler, more stylized models.  Here we focus on the consequences for monetary
6:184:14901:18:18:72:540:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:policy analysis of two basic features of economies — heterogeneity of non-financial economic
6:185:14993:18:18:72:540:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:units, of a kind that gives the financial sector a non-trivial role in the allocation of resources;
6:186:15092:18:18:72:540:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and costs of financial intermediation, that may be subject to random variation for reasons
6:187:15182:18:18:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relating largely to developments in the financial sector — in the simplest possible setting,
6:188:15274:18:18:72:434:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:where we do not introduce other departures from the basic NK model.
6:189:15341:18:18:89:539:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Two  contributions  have  aims  more  closely  related  to  ours.   Like  us,Goodfriend  and
6:190:15433:18:17:72:539:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:McCallum(2007) consider a fairly simple NK model, with new model elements limited to
6:191:15517:17:18:72:540:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:those necessary to allow for multiple interest rates with different average levels (including,
6:192:15611:18:18:72:539:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:like us,  a distinction between bank lending rates and the policy rate).7As in the present
6:193:15701:18:18:72:540:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:paper, a primary goal is to “investigate quantitatively how much a central bank can be misled
6:194:15794:18:22:72:540:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by relying on a [NK] model without money and banking when managing its interbank-rate
6:195:15879:22:9:72:499:127:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:present paper, but in a more complex model with features specific to emerging-market economies.

6:198:16180:12:9:72:307:91:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:implications of financial frictions of a variety of types.
6:199:16238:9:0:85:515:82:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:A:7This paper provides a quantitative analysis of type of model first proposed byGoodfriend(2005).
7:200:16379:0:18:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:policy instrument.”  De Fiore and Tristani (2011) also propose a simple generalization of the
7:201:16472:18:18:72:540:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:basic NK model in order to introduce a distinction between loan rates and the policy; also
7:202:16562:18:18:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:like us, they consider how financial frictions affect the “natural rate of interest,” and the role
7:203:16660:18:18:72:482:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of such a concept in inflation determination in an economy with credit frictions.
7:204:16741:18:18:89:539:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The approaches taken by these authors nonetheless differ from ours in important respects.
7:205:16830:18:18:72:540:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In particular, unlike us, Goodfriend and McCallum assume a representative-household model;
7:206:16920:18:18:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as a consequence, financial intermediation matters for resource allocation in their model only
7:207:17014:18:18:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:because they assume that certain liabilities of banks (transactions balances) play a crucial
7:208:17106:18:18:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:role in facilitating transactions.  We instead treat the fact that some (but not all) financial
7:209:17201:18:18:72:540:525:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intermediaries finance (some) of their lending by providing accounts that are useful as means
7:210:17294:18:18:72:540:507:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of payment as inessential to the primary function of financial intermediaries in the economy;
7:211:17387:18:18:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and in our model, for the sake of simplicity, we assume that intermediaries finance themselves
7:212:17481:18:17:72:540:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:entirely by issuing deposits that supply no transactions services at all (so that in equilibrium,
7:213:17578:17:18:72:392:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:deposits must pay the same interest rate as government debt).
7:214:17639:18:18:89:539:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:De Fiore and Tristani instead have two types of infinite-lived agents (“households” and
7:215:17726:18:18:72:540:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:“entrepreneurs,” following Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist (1999), one of which saves while
7:216:17817:18:18:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  other  borrows;  but  in  their  model,  unlike  ours,  agents  belong  permanently  to  one  of
7:217:17918:18:18:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:these categories, and one is tempted to identify the division between them with the division
7:218:18010:18:18:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:between  households  and  firms  in  the  flow  of  funds  accounts.   This  would  be  desirable,  of
7:219:18112:18:18:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:course,  if one thought that the model did adequately capture the nature of that division,
7:220:18202:18:18:72:540:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as the model would yield additional testable predictions.  But in fact, there are both saving
7:221:18295:18:18:72:540:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:units and borrowing units at a given point in time, both in the household sector and in the
7:222:18386:18:18:72:540:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firm sector; and a saving unit at one point in time need not be a saving unit forever.  We
7:223:18476:18:18:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:accordingly prefer not to introduce a distinction between households and firms (or “house-
7:224:18566:18:18:72:540:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:holds” and “entrepreneurs”) at all, and also not to assume that the identities of our savers
7:225:18658:18:18:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  borrowers  are  permanent.8In  addition,  De  Fiore  and  Tristani,  like  Goodfriend  and
7:226:18753:18:17:72:540:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:McCallum, assume that money must be used in (some) transactions, while we abstract from
7:227:18840:17:18:72:471:203:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:transactions frictions of this kind altogether in order to simplify our analysis.9

7:232:19265:8:16:85:539:137:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:9Goodfriend and McCallum justify the introduction of a cash-in-advance constraint in their model, stating
7:233:19370:16:12:72:540:121:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:(footnote 6) that “medium-of-exchange money is implicitly central to our analysis because it is by managing

7:235:19586:12:12:72:540:97:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:interest  rates.”   However,  while  in  their  model,  banks  hold  reserves  at  the  central  bank  only  because  of
7:236:19706:12:12:72:540:85:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:a reserve requirement proportional to transactions balances,  this need not be true in actual economies,  a

8:240:20167:18:18:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:evaluate those policies.  That goes beyond the scope of this paper.  C ́urdia and Woodford
8:241:20257:18:18:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(2011)  extend  our  framework  to  explicitly  evaluate  the  use  of  the  central  bank’s  balance

8:244:20539:18:18:72:344:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:through an extension ofGertler and Kiyotaki(2010).
8:245:20589:18:18:89:539:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We develop our model in section2, and compare its structure with that of the basic NK

8:252:21248:18:18:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are  from  those  derived  from  the  basic  NK  model.   We  also  discuss  the  way  in  which  the

8:259:21865:18:18:72:540:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the model presented here and the basic New Keynesian model, and show how the standard
8:260:21950:18:18:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model  is  recovered  as  a  special  case  of  the  one  developed  here.   This  sets  the  stage  for  a

8:265:22411:12:12:72:540:172:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:chap.  2).  Hence there is no need to introduce a demand for money for transactions purposes in our model,

9:289:23618:18:18:71:539:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:goods.  The household similarly supplies a continuum of different types of specialized labor,

9:294:24042:18:17:71:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we assume that each period, with probability 1−δ(for some 0≤δ <1) an event occurs
9:295:24123:17:18:71:539:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which results in a new type for the household being drawn; otherwise it remains the same
9:296:24211:18:18:71:540:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as in the previous period.  When a new type is drawn, it isbwith probabilityπbandswith

9:298:24379:18:33:71:539:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:types are constant at all times, and equal toπτfor each typeτ.) We assume moreover that

9:307:25140:16:8:72:460:107:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:by the two types varies in neighborhoods of the two values  ̄cband  ̄csshown in the figure.
9:308:25231:8:16:81:539:99:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:12As  explained  below,  all  households  have  the  same  expectations  regarding  their  marginal  utilities  of
9:309:25345:16:12:72:540:83:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:expenditure far in the future. Hence if typebhouseholds have a higher current marginal utility of expenditure,
9:310:25455:12:0:72:540:71:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:they also have a higher valuation of current (marginal) expenditure relative to future expenditure; thus we
10:311:25607:0:18:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stateξt; in addition, the current impatience to consume of all households is changed by the
10:312:25698:18:18:72:540:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:aggregate disturbanceξt.  We also assume that the marginal utility of additional expenditure
10:313:25790:18:18:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9:B:diminishes  at  different  rates  for  the  two  types,  as  is  also  illustrated  in  the  figure;  typeb
10:314:25897:18:18:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:households (who are borrowers in equilibrium) have a marginal utility that varies less with
10:315:25988:18:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the current level of expenditure, resulting in a greater degree of intertemporal substitution
10:316:26081:18:18:72:540:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of their expenditures in response to interest-rate changes.  Finally,  the two types are also
10:317:26174:18:18:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assumed to differ in the marginal disutility of working a given number of hours; this difference
10:318:26270:18:18:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is calibrated so that the two types choose to work the same number of hours in steady state,
10:319:26362:18:18:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:despite their differing marginal utilities of income.  For simplicity,  the elasticities of labor
10:320:26459:18:18:72:335:525:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:supply of the two types are not assumed to differ.13

10:323:26688:18:17:72:539:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model,  all  output  is  consumed  either  by  households  or  by  the  government;14hence  inter-
10:324:26786:17:18:72:540:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mediation  serves  an  allocative  function  only  to  the  extent  that  there  are  reasons  for  the
10:325:26889:18:18:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intertemporal marginal rates of substitution of households to differ in the absence of finan-
10:326:26982:18:18:72:540:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cial flows.  The present model reduces to the standard representative-household model in the
10:327:27074:18:18:72:421:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9:B:case that one assumes thatub(c;ξ) =us(c;ξ) andvb(h;ξ) =vs(h;ξ).

10:335:27795:22:8:72:294:252:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:may say that they are more impatient to consume.
10:336:27843:8:16:81:540:244:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:13As is specified below in our discussion of our calibrated examples, we assume that the functionvb(h;ξ)
10:337:27947:16:8:72:295:228:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:differs fromvs(h;ξ) only by a multiplicative factor.
10:338:27999:8:16:81:539:220:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:14The “consumption” variable is therefore to be interpreted as representing all of private expenditure, not
10:339:28106:16:12:72:540:204:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:only consumer expenditure.  In reality, one of the most important reasons for some economic units to wish
10:340:28211:12:12:72:539:192:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:to borrow from others is that the former currently have access to profitableinvestmentopportunities.  Here
10:341:28317:12:12:72:540:180:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:we treat these opportunities as if they were opportunities toconsume,in the sense that we suppose that the
10:342:28423:12:12:72:540:168:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:expenditure opportunities are valuable to the household, but we abstract from any consequences of current
10:343:28528:12:12:72:540:156:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:expenditure for future productivity.  For discussion of the interpretation of “consumption” in the basic New
10:344:28636:12:8:72:302:144:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:Keynesian model, seeWoodford(2003, pp.  242-243).
10:345:28685:8:15:81:539:136:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:15Here “savers” and “borrowers” identify households according to whether they choose to save or borrow,
10:346:28788:15:12:72:540:121:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:and not by their “type”.  We assume that at any time, each household is able to save or borrow (or both
10:347:28891:12:12:72:540:109:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:at once, though it would never make sense to do so) at market interest rates.  In the equilibrium described
10:348:28998:12:12:72:539:97:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:below, it turns out that a householdiborrows in periodtif and only ifτt(i) =b,but this is a consequence
10:349:29101:12:0:72:386:85:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:of optimization rather than an implication of a participation constraint.
11:350:29219:0:18:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cannot engage in financial contracting other than through the intermediary sector introduces
11:351:29311:18:18:72:359:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the financial friction with which the paper is concerned.
11:352:29368:18:18:89:539:651:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our analysis is simplified (though this may not be immediately apparent!)  by allowing
11:353:29454:18:18:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for an additional form of financial contracting.  We assume that households are able to sign
11:354:29546:18:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:state-contingent  contracts  with  one  another,  through  which  they  may  insure  one  another
11:355:29643:18:18:72:540:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:against both aggregate risk and the idiosyncratic risk associated with a household’s random

11:359:30011:18:18:72:539:525:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mentioned in the previous paragraph.  The assumption that households areeventuallyable to
11:360:30100:18:18:72:540:507:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:make transfers to one another in accordance with an insurance contract signed earlier means
11:361:30191:18:18:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that  despite  our  assumption  of  infinite-lived  households,  households’  respective  marginal
11:362:30289:18:17:72:540:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:utilities of income do not eventually become more and more dispersed as a result of their
11:363:30378:17:18:72:540:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:differing individual type histories.  This facilitates aggregation (so that our model still has
11:364:30473:18:18:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a low-dimensional state space), and allows us to obtain stationary equilibrium fluctuations
11:365:30564:18:18:72:540:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and to use local methods to characterize them.  At the same time, the fact that households

11:367:30745:18:18:72:390:382:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:financial friction for the banking sector to partially mitigate.16
11:368:30811:18:18:89:539:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To simplify the presentation, we assume here that the random dates on which a given
11:369:30894:18:18:71:540:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:householdihas  access  to  the  insurance  agency  are  the  same  dates  as  those  on  which  it
11:370:30992:18:18:71:539:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:draws a new type.  Thus with probabilityδeach period, householdiis unable to receive any
11:371:31080:18:18:71:539:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:insurance transfer in the current period, and also retains the same type as in the previous
11:372:31171:18:18:71:539:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:period.  With probability 1−δ,it learns at the beginning of the period that it has access
11:373:31260:18:18:71:539:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to  the  insurance  agency.   In  this  case,  it  receives  a  net  transferTt(i)  (under  the  terms  of
11:374:31366:18:18:71:539:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an insurance contract signed far in the past), that may depend on the history of aggregate

11:377:31640:17:18:71:540:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:transfer, householdilearns its new type (an independent drawing as explained above), and
11:378:31728:18:18:71:539:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:then makes its spending, saving and borrowing decisions as in any other period, but taking
11:379:31818:18:18:71:396:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:into account its new type and its post-transfer financial wealth.

11:383:32193:12:12:72:539:103:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:are possible at interim dates.  See,e.g.,Lucas and Stokey (1987), Lucas (1990), Fuerst(1992), orLagos and
11:384:32298:12:12:72:540:91:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:Wright(2005).  Here we use a similar device to facilitate aggregation, but without doing so in a way that
11:385:32403:12:0:72:447:79:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:implies that the allocative consequences of financial frictions are extremely transitory.

15:508:40292:18:18:72:540:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sets at this point), as no households are in this situation in the equilibria that we describe
15:509:40386:18:17:72:97:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:here.
15:510:40391:17:18:89:539:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Under conditions specified in the Appendix, one can show that there is an equilibrium
15:511:40476:18:18:72:540:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9:B:in  which  every  household  of  typeshas  positive  savings,  while  every  household  of  typeb
15:512:40573:18:18:72:540:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:borrows,  in every period.  Hence the interest rate that is  relevant for a given household’s
15:513:40666:18:18:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intertemporal tradeoff turns out to be perfectly correlated with the household’s type (though
15:514:40759:18:18:72:540:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this is not due to participation constraints).  Moreover, because in equilibrium, households

15:517:41034:18:18:72:540:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:histories, it follows that in any period, all households of a given type have the same marginal
15:518:41129:18:18:72:540:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:utility of income, regardless of their histories.  Hence we can writeλτtfor the marginal utility

16:554:42596:18:18:72:540:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relating that marginal utility of income to the expected real rate of return implied by the
16:555:42687:18:18:72:540:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model’s single interest rate.  The present model implies a similar relation between interest
16:556:42779:18:18:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rates and the timing of expenditure as in the basic model.  The main differences are (i) that
16:557:42872:18:18:72:540:430:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:now there aretwo differentinterest rates that each affect aggregate demand (though with
16:558:42959:18:18:72:540:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the same sign), by affecting the expenditure decisions of different economic units, and (ii)
16:559:43051:18:18:72:482:394:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that the resources used by the banking sector can also affect aggregate demand.
16:560:43130:18:18:89:539:376:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The presence of two interest rates relevant to aggregate demand determination does not
16:561:43216:18:18:72:540:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mean there are two independent dimensions of monetary policy.  Instead, the two rates must
16:562:43306:18:18:72:539:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be linked by equations (2.7)–(2.8), determining the equilibrium credit spread.21If we intro-
16:563:43398:18:17:72:540:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:duce no further frictions, the policy rate (which is a rate at which banks are willing to lend
16:564:43492:17:18:72:540:305:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:short-term funds to one another) corresponds to the deposit rateidt;22and we may suppose
16:565:43580:18:18:72:539:287:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that  the  central  bank  directly  controls  this  rate.23In  the  case  that  banking  uses  no  real
16:566:43683:18:18:72:539:269:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f12:B:resources (so that Ξt(bt) = 0 regardless of the volume of lending) and the credit spreadωt
16:567:43773:18:18:72:539:251:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is purely exogenous (i.e.,independent of the volume of lending),24the system consisting of
16:568:43863:18:19:72:540:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equations (2.7)–(2.8) and (2.12)–(2.15) gives a complete account of how real aggregate de-
16:569:43953:19:15:81:539:214:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:21Of course, thereisan additional, independent dimension of central-bank policy if the central bank has
16:570:44056:15:12:72:540:199:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:measures, independent of its control of the policy rate, that can influence the financial frictions represented
16:571:44167:12:9:72:507:187:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:by the functions Ξt(bt) orχt(bt) introduced in the next section.  We leave this issue for future work.
16:572:44269:9:15:81:539:178:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:22We could introduce a distinction between the rate that banks pay depositors and the rate banks pay
16:573:44369:15:12:72:540:163:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:one another for overnight funds, by supposing, asGoodfriend and McCallum(2007) do, that banks must
16:574:44467:12:12:72:540:151:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:hold unremunerated reserves in proportion to their deposits,  while required reserves are not increased by
16:575:44573:12:8:72:451:139:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:borrowing funds in the interbank market.  We abstract from reserve requirements here.
16:576:44658:8:16:81:539:131:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:23The issues involved in discussing how the central bank actually controls the policy rate are no different
16:577:44765:16:8:72:481:115:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:here than in the case of the standard NK model.  See, for example,Woodford(2003, chap.  2).
16:578:44856:8:16:81:539:107:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:24The model of the credit spread explained in the next section implies that this would be true in the case
16:579:44962:16:12:72:540:91:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:that no real resources are used in intermediation, and the default rate is independent of the scale of lending,
16:580:45073:12:0:72:223:79:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:so that the functionχt(b) is linear.
17:581:45155:0:18:72:539:687:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:mand is determined by the expected path of the policy rateidtrelative to expected inflation.25
17:582:45249:18:18:72:540:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This predicted relation between aggregate demand and the expected path of future interest
17:583:45338:18:18:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rates is of essentially the same kind as in the basic NK model.  Hence the introduction of
17:584:45428:18:18:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:financial frictions,  of a kind capable of accounting for the observed average size and vari-
17:585:45521:18:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ability of spreads between deposit rates and lending rates, need not imply any substantial
17:586:45611:18:18:72:540:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:change in our understanding of the way in which central-bank control of short-term interest
17:587:45702:18:18:72:276:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rates determines aggregate expenditure.
17:588:45741:18:18:89:539:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Indeed, the basic NK model remains nested as a special case of the model proposed here.
17:589:45828:18:18:72:539:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In the case that both types of households have identical preferences (ub(c;ξ) =us(c;ξ) and
17:590:45918:18:18:72:540:525:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:B:vb(h;ξ)  =vs(h:ξ)),  and  the  wedge  between  the  deposit  rate  and  lending  rate  is  always
17:591:46015:18:18:72:540:507:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:zero (ωt(b) = 0 at all times),  our model is equivalent to the basic NK model.  For in this
17:592:46106:18:18:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:caseibt=idtat all times, so that there is a single interest rate; equations (2.12)–(2.13) then
17:593:46200:18:17:72:540:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:imply  thatλbt=λstat  all  times;26and  since  the  functionscb(λ;ξ)  andcs(λ;ξ)  must  be
17:594:46290:17:18:72:540:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:identical in this case, equilibrium must involvecbt=cstat all times.  Equation (2.15) then
17:595:46380:18:18:72:539:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reduces simply to the standard relationYt=ct+Gt,while equations (2.12)–(2.13) imply that
17:596:46468:18:18:72:540:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the common marginal utility of income of all households satisfies the usual Euler equation.
17:597:46559:18:18:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Of course, this parameterization is not the one we regard as most empirically realistic (in
17:598:46650:18:18:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:particular,  it  would  not  account  for  observed  spreads,  as  discussed  below);  but  since  the

17:600:46844:18:18:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:becomes merely a quantitative issue to determine how different its predictions are for other
17:601:46936:18:18:72:540:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parameter  values.   In  fact,  our  results  reported  below  suggest  that  for  many  questions,  a
17:602:47038:18:18:72:540:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reasonably parameterized version of this model yields predictions quite similar to those of
17:603:47129:18:39:72:395:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an appropriately parameterized version of the basic NK model.
17:604:47190:39:25:72:284:253:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:2.2    The Intermediary Sector
17:605:47220:25:18:72:540:228:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Here we further explain our assumptions about the behavior of intermediaries and the de-
17:606:47308:18:18:72:539:210:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:terminants of the equilibrium credit spreadωt.  We allow for two sources of credit spreads
17:607:47398:18:18:72:540:192:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:—  one  of  which  follows  from  an  assumption  that  intermediation  requires  real  resources,
17:608:47496:18:18:72:540:174:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the other of which does not — which provide two distinct sources of “purely financial”
17:609:47586:18:18:72:208:156:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:disturbances in our model.
17:610:47612:18:18:89:539:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:First, we assume that real resources Ξt(bt) are consumed in the process of originating loans
17:611:47704:18:16:81:539:120:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:25To be more precise, the expected path of real interest rates determines only desired current expenditure
17:612:47810:16:12:72:540:104:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:relative to expected future expenditure, so that current aggregate demand also depends on expected long-run
17:613:47917:12:12:72:540:92:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:output, just as in the basic NK model (see,e.g.,Woodford,2003, chap.  4).  The expected long-run level of
17:614:48022:12:8:72:423:80:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:output is determined by supply-side factors and by the long-run inflation target.
17:615:48103:8:0:81:281:72:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:A:26See the Appendix for demonstration of this.
18:616:48194:0:18:72:539:687:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of real quantitybt, and that these resources must be produced and consumed in the period
18:617:48282:18:18:72:539:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in which the loans are originated.27The function Ξt(bt) is assumed to be non-decreasing and
18:618:48373:18:18:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at least weakly convex.  Strict convexity of Ξt(b) would indicate increasing costs owing to a
18:619:48466:18:18:72:410:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:capacity constraint, e.g.  the scarcity of available managerial time.
18:620:48535:18:18:89:540:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In addition, we suppose that in order to originate a quantity of loansbtthat will be repaid
18:621:48626:18:18:71:539:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(with interest) in the following period,  it is necessary for an  intermediary to also make a
18:622:48719:18:18:71:539:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quantityχt(bt) of loans that will be defaulted upon, whereχt(bt) is also a non-decreasing,
18:623:48809:18:18:71:539:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:weakly convex function.  (This function may also be strictly convex, due to reduced accuracy
18:624:48901:18:18:71:465:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of screening the larger the volume of lending relative to the bank’s capacity.)
18:625:48980:18:18:89:539:525:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We assume that the bank cannot tell the legitimate borrowers and fraudulent borrowers
18:626:49065:18:18:71:539:507:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:apart,  and so must treat them equally.  However,  the bank is able to predict the fraction
18:627:49156:18:18:71:539:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of its loans that will turn out to be fraudulent, and so correctly predicts that loan repay-

18:632:49295:10:17:319:540:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:, even though the loans extended had value
18:633:49337:17:18:71:540:454:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:B:Pt[bt+χt(bt)].  The fact that the same interest rate must be charged for both types of loans
18:634:49429:18:18:71:539:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:means that the existence of the default risk increases the cost of financing projects that are
18:635:49523:18:18:71:539:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:known to the borrower to be riskless; so a credit spread due to this kind of risk represents
18:636:49615:18:18:71:539:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a barrier to efficient financial intermediation.  The opportunity to make a fraudulent loan
18:637:49706:18:18:71:539:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:contract is assumed to arrive randomly to each household with equal probability, regardless
18:638:49797:18:18:71:539:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the household’s current type.  Thus each household has additional real income each period
18:639:49889:18:18:71:539:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equal toχt(bt), its earnings from fraud.  Each household also chooses how many legitimate
18:640:49978:18:18:71:540:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9:B:loan  contracts  to  enter  into,  understanding  that  these  loans  must  be  repaid;  only  typeb
18:641:50078:18:18:71:417:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:households choose to enter legitimate loan contracts in equilibrium.

18:644:50328:18:18:71:539:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:funds received from depositors that are not lent out or used to pay the resource costs of loan

18:648:50555:19:16:81:539:184:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:27This real resource cost can be interpreted in either of two ways:  either as a quantity of the composite

18:652:50997:12:12:72:540:133:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:does not affect the validity of the equations given here, though it affects the interpretation of variables such

19:667:51436:32:18:71:539:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The income flow to households must also include households’ earnings from fraud; hence we

19:670:51560:26:18:89:539:494:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We assume competition among intermediaries, both in the loan market and the deposit
19:671:51643:18:18:71:539:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:market.  Thus a given intermediary takes bothibtandidtas given,  independent of its own

19:675:51867:26:33:71:517:396:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Hence in equilibrium, competition between banks leads to an equilibrium credit spread

19:677:51986:33:17:71:540:330:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Thusχt(bt) plays the role of a “markup” factor that can cause credit spreads in excess of

19:679:52122:18:18:89:540:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:LikeGoodfriend and McCallum(2007), we simply posit a reduced-form intermediation

19:681:52293:18:18:71:539:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:between the interest rate available to savers and the one at which it is possible to borrow.
19:682:52385:18:18:71:539:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This  means  that  we  are  unable  to  consider  possible  effects  of  central-bank  policy  on  the

19:684:52583:18:15:81:539:205:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:28The earnings from fraud are not actually collected from the intermediaries as a dividend to shareholders.
19:685:52690:15:12:72:540:190:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:But  like  those  dividends,  we  assume  that  the  earnings  from  fraud  are  a  lump-sum  distribution  to  each
19:686:52806:12:12:72:540:178:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:household, so there is no harm in combining the two sources of income in a single term.  Both sources of
19:687:52910:12:9:72:432:166:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:income depend on activity in the intermediary sector, though for different reasons.
19:688:52993:9:15:81:539:157:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:29Certainly we do not deny that at least at certain times, central banks do seek to affect the efficiency of
19:689:53101:15:12:72:540:142:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:the banking system; this is true most obviously in the case of actions taken in a central bank’s capacity as
19:690:53209:12:12:72:540:130:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:“lender of last resort” during a financial crisis.  However, we regard such actions as representing a largely

20:699:54128:26:18:72:540:604:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We allow in general for the possibility that aggregate real borrowingbtfrom financial inter-

24:880:64653:16:12:72:539:212:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:rate more favorable than that available to private non-financial borrowers: the rateidtat which intermediaries
24:881:64763:12:12:72:540:200:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:are able to obtain funding, rather than the rateibtpaid by households that must borrow from intermediaries.
24:882:64870:12:12:72:540:188:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:In effect, when the public debt is increased the government is (among other things) borrowing at this lower

24:884:65082:12:12:72:540:164:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:on their own account.  This increases aggregate demand in somewhat the same way as a reduction in credit
24:885:65186:12:8:72:129:152:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:spreads does.

24:890:65626:12:12:72:540:92:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:of the two variables is more complex when private indebtedness increases credit frictions while government
24:891:65732:12:11:72:540:80:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:debt does not, but the most important effect of government borrowing remains the “crowding out” of private

26:930:68145:30:18:72:540:657:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We have shown that it is possible to generalize the basic NK model in a fairly straightforward
26:931:68239:18:18:72:540:639:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:way to incorporate credit frictions — more specifically, a spread between the deposit rate
26:932:68329:18:18:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  the  lending  rate,  that  may  be  large  or  small,  constant  or  variable,  and  exogenous  or
26:933:68432:18:18:72:540:603:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:endogenous, depending how we choose to parameterize the model.  This shows, at the very
26:934:68519:18:18:72:540:585:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:least, that the inherent structure of NK models does not in some way require one to ignore the
26:935:68613:18:18:72:540:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:existence of such frictions.  But how much does this generalization change the implications
26:936:68704:18:18:72:190:549:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the resulting model?
26:937:68727:18:18:89:539:531:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In this section, we consider the effects on the economy of a variety of types of exogenous
26:938:68817:18:18:72:540:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:disturbances, including monetary policy shocks, under simple specifications of monetary pol-
26:939:68909:18:17:72:540:495:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:icy.  Our goal is not yet to compare monetary policies, but rather to compare the predictions
26:940:69002:17:18:72:540:478:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  alternative  model  specifications;  we  wish  to  determine  to  what  extent  our  conclusions

26:944:69266:26:18:72:540:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:To  approach  this  question,  we  log-linearize  the  structural  relations  of  our  model  around
26:945:69366:18:18:72:540:359:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:steady-state  values  of  the  various  endogenous  variables  that  represent  a  perfect  foresight
26:946:69467:18:18:72:540:341:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equilibrium  in  the  case  of  no  random  variation  in  any  of  the  exogenous  disturbance  pro-
26:947:69568:18:18:72:540:323:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cesses, as discussed further in the Appendix.  The solution to these linear equations under a
26:948:69661:18:18:72:540:305:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:correspondingly log-linear specification of monetary policy provides a linear approximation
26:949:69752:18:18:72:540:287:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to  the  equilibrium  responses  to  the  various  types  of  disturbances,  in  the  case  that  these
26:950:69855:18:17:72:540:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:random variations are small enough.  The linearity of the solution allows us to discuss the
26:951:69946:17:18:72:540:252:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equilibrium responses to individual shocks independently of whether other exogenous vari-
26:952:70035:18:18:72:540:234:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ables change concurrently, and to discuss the size of the responses relative to the size of the
26:953:70130:18:18:72:418:216:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shock without caring about the size of the shock that is considered.
26:954:70198:18:18:89:539:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We first summarize the structure of the log-linearized model, as these equations them-
26:955:70284:18:18:72:540:180:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:selves  provide  considerable  insight  into  the  model’s  implications,  and  the  similarities  and
26:956:70386:18:18:72:540:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:differences  between  the  predictions  of  the  generalized  model  and  those  of  the  basic  NK
26:957:70485:18:18:72:540:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model (which is itself most familiar in its log-linearized form).  We log-linearize the struc-
26:958:70579:18:18:72:540:126:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tural relations of the previous section around a steady state with zero inflation ( ̄Π = 1).  This
26:959:70677:18:18:72:540:108:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:means that in our analysis, we shall restrict attention to monetary policy rules that imply
26:960:70768:18:18:72:540:90:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an inflation rate of zero, or one not far from zero, in the absence of stochastic disturbances.
26:961:70863:18:0:72:540:72:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This simplification is familiar in the standard NK literature, and we follow it here in order
27:962:71002:0:18:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to focus solely on the new complications introduced by heterogeneity and credit frictions.
27:963:71092:18:18:72:540:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Moreover, we show in section 3 that according to the present model, optimal monetary policy
27:964:71183:18:18:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:has this property; hence the approximation adopted here suffices for the study of monetary
27:965:71273:18:18:72:317:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:policies that are close enough to optimal policy.

31:1099:78954:18:18:72:539:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the disturbances  ˆμwtand  ˆτt(sources of variation in the flexible-price equilibrium level of

31:1101:79144:18:18:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cal to the “new Keynesian Phillips curve” of the basic NK model, with the exception of the
31:1102:79234:18:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:terms proportional toˆΩtandˆΞt, indicating “cost-push” effects of the credit frictions in our
31:1103:79327:18:18:72:156:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:extended model.
31:1104:79342:18:18:89:539:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Equations (3.8) and (3.12) are thus direct analogs of two of the equations of the canonical

31:1107:79622:18:18:72:540:525:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:existence of credit frictions.  In the case that both{ˆωt}and{ˆΞt}can be treated as exogenous
31:1108:79715:18:18:71:539:507:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:processes (so that{ˆΩt}is exogenous as well),  these same three equations again provide a
31:1109:79804:18:18:71:539:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:complete system for the determination of equilibrium inflation,  output and interest rates,
31:1110:79895:18:17:71:539:471:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:exceptthat one must adjoin equation (3.10) to connect the interest rate that appears in the
31:1111:79986:17:18:71:538:454:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f12:B:IS relation to the policy rate.  If one substitutes the central-bank reaction function for ˆıdt

31:1113:80173:18:18:72:540:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:supposes that the central bank uses the average interest rate as its operating target, a policy
31:1114:80268:18:18:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:proposal  that  we  analyze  further  in  section  3  —  then  one  again  obtains  a  three-equation
31:1115:80369:18:18:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model directly analogous to the basic NK model.  For example, if the central bank follows a
31:1116:80460:18:18:72:189:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Taylor rule of the form

31:1118:80509:26:33:72:376:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:then the complete model would consist of (3.8), (3.12), and
31:1119:80568:33:33:225:540:287:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:ˆıavgt=φππt+φyˆYt+πbˆωt+-mt.(3.14)
31:1120:80602:33:17:72:540:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The only differences relative to the basic NK model are that the interest rate appearing in
31:1121:80693:17:18:72:540:237:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this three-equation system is not the only relevant interest rate and may not correspond to
31:1122:80784:18:18:72:540:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the policy rate; that the numerical values of the coefficients  ̄σandκmust take appropriate
31:1123:80875:18:18:72:540:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:account of the different degrees of interest-sensitivity of expenditure of different units in the
31:1124:80972:18:18:72:540:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:economy;  and that time-varying financial frictions are an additional source of disturbance
31:1125:81063:18:18:72:216:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:terms in all three equations.
31:1126:81092:18:18:89:539:147:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:It follows that at least in this case, inflation and output determination can be understood
31:1127:81183:18:18:72:539:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f5:B:in exactly the same way as in the basic NK model,regardless of the average size of credit
31:1128:81272:18:18:72:540:111:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:frictions, or their degree of variability.For example, in the case that the monetary policy
31:1129:81363:18:18:72:540:93:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equation  involves  no  response  to  lagged  variables  (or  to  any  endogenous  variables  other
31:1130:81462:18:0:72:540:75:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:than inflation, output, or forecasts of these), and the policy implies a determinate rational-
32:1131:81602:0:18:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expectations  equilibrium,  that  equilibrium  will  make  inflation,  output  and  interest  rates
32:1132:81701:18:15:72:539:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:all a function solely of the economy’scurrent state— to be precise, the current values of
32:1133:81790:15:21:73:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ˆYnt,gt,ut,ˆωt,ˆΞt,and the monetary policy disturbance, and current information about the
32:1134:81879:21:18:71:539:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expected future evolution of these variables.  (As has often been remarked of the basic NK
32:1135:81969:18:18:71:539:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model, the model is thus “purely forward-looking,” and cannot explain inflation persistence
32:1136:82060:18:18:71:533:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:other than as a consequence of persistence in the exogenous disturbances just mentioned.)
32:1137:82149:18:18:89:539:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the simple case of a monetary policy described by (3.13), the conditions for determinacy
32:1138:82240:18:18:71:539:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f14:B:of equilibrium remain exactly the same as in the basic NK model; in the case thatφπ,φy≥
32:1139:82327:18:18:71:539:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:0,these  amount  simply  to  the  requirement  that  the  policy  rule  conform  to  the  “Taylor
32:1140:82424:18:35:71:471:525:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Principle” (Woodford,2003, p.  254),i.e.,that the response coefficients satisfy
32:1141:82503:35:0:259:283:490:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:A:φπ+
32:1142:82506:0:16:287:314:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9:?:1−β

32:1144:82510:0:33:316:352:490:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:?:φy>1.
32:1145:82515:33:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:If this condition is satisfied, one can solve for inflation as a function of current and expected
32:1146:82612:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:future values of the disturbance processes in exactly the same way as is explained in Woodford
32:1147:82706:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(2003, chap.  4, secs.  2.2, 2.4), and the coefficients on current and expected future values
32:1148:82799:18:17:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the disturbances  ̄ct,ˆGt, ̄ht,at,ˆμwt,ˆτt,or-mtat all horizons areidenticalto the predictions
32:1149:82896:17:18:72:540:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  the  basic  NK  model,  if  the  latter  model  is  calibrated  to  have  the  same  values  for  the
32:1150:83001:18:18:72:539:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:coefficientsβ,ξ, ̄σ,andωy.38The only difference in the solution is that shocks to the current
32:1151:83094:18:18:72:539:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or  expected  future  values  of  the  financial  disturbances  ˆωtandˆΞtwill  affect  equilibrium
32:1152:83192:18:18:72:156:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:inflation as well.
32:1153:83210:18:18:89:539:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Moreover, not only does the model predict the same numerical responses to non-financial
32:1154:83297:18:18:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:disturbances, under given monetary-policy coefficients (φπ,φy) — so that one’s conclusions
32:1155:83387:18:18:72:540:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:about the desirability of a particular choice of those coefficients, from the point of view of how
32:1156:83485:18:18:72:540:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:they effect the economy’s response to non-financial disturbances, will be unchanged — but
32:1157:83574:18:18:72:540:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the predicted responses to financial disturbances do not really involve any new considerations
32:1158:83668:18:18:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(beyond the mere fact that such disturbances can occur and ought to be measured in order
32:1159:83756:18:18:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to properly conduct policy).  The effects of variations in the processes{ˆωt,ˆΞt}on inflation
32:1160:83849:18:18:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and output are predicted to be the same as the effects thatotherkinds of disturbances have,
32:1161:83940:18:18:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:when they shift the three equations to a similar extent and with a similar expected degree of
32:1162:84033:18:17:72:540:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:persistence.  Thus the effects of financial shocks on inflation can be decomposed into three
32:1163:84125:17:16:81:539:135:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:38Of course, the numerical values of some of these coefficients may be different, owing to the existence of
32:1164:84232:16:12:72:540:119:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:credit frictions, than they would be in an economy without such frictions, owing, for example, to an effect
32:1165:84339:12:12:72:540:107:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:of steady-state distortions resulting from credit spreads on the steady-state level of output, and hence the
32:1166:84447:12:12:72:540:95:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:point at which various elasticities are evaluated.  This would not, however, affect the accuracy of predictions
32:1167:84558:12:12:72:540:83:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:made by the NK model if it were correctly parameterized to match the elasticities observed in an actual
32:1168:84661:12:0:72:112:71:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:economy.
33:1169:84715:0:18:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:types of effects that are already present in the basic NK model:  the effects of a disturbance
33:1170:84809:18:18:72:540:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to  the  “natural  rate  of  interest”  (a  shift  in  the  real  average  interest  rate  consistent  with
33:1171:84916:18:18:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a  zero  output  gap),  the  effects  of  a  “cost-push  shock”  (a  shift  in  the  size  of  output  gap
33:1172:85022:18:18:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:required for price stability), and the effects of a “monetary policy shock” (a change in the
33:1173:85114:18:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:average interest rate relative to what would ordinarily follow from the current inflation rate
33:1174:85208:18:18:72:540:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and output gap, in this case due to a change in the credit spread rather than a change in
33:1175:85297:18:18:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the policy rate).  Financial disturbances typically have effects of all three types;  but their
33:1176:85392:18:18:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consequences can be easily understood if the consequences of those three general types of
33:1177:85481:18:18:72:261:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:disturbances are already understood.
33:1178:85517:18:18:89:540:525:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The case in which{ˆωt,ˆΞt}are both completely exogenous processes is, of course, a fairly
33:1179:85606:18:18:72:540:507:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:special one.  If one or both of them depends on the volume of bank lending, as allowed for in
33:1180:85699:18:18:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:our exposition above, a larger system of equations, including the law of motion for private
33:1181:85790:18:17:72:540:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:debt, is needed in order to predict the evolution of inflation, output and interest rates.  We
33:1182:85884:17:18:72:540:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:do not seek to present analytical results for this more complex case, but instead offer some
33:1183:85976:18:39:72:221:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:illustrative numerical results.

33:1185:86031:26:18:72:540:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The numerical values for parameters that are used in our calculations are explained in the
33:1186:86121:18:18:72:540:353:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Appendix.  Many of the model’s parameters are also parameters of the basic NK model, and
33:1187:86209:18:18:72:540:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the case of these parameters we assume similar numerical values as in the numerical anal-

33:1189:86386:18:18:71:539:299:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for the present model are those relating to heterogeneity or to the specification of the credit

33:1196:86976:18:18:71:539:174:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time until a household has access to the insurance agency (and its type is drawn again) is 10
33:1197:87069:18:18:71:539:156:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:years.  This means that the expected path of the spread between lending and deposit rates
33:1198:87158:18:18:71:539:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for 10 years or so into the future affects current spending decisions, but that expectations
33:1199:87250:18:16:81:539:120:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:39Another new parameter as a consequence of heterogeneity is the steady-state level of government debt
33:1200:87352:16:11:72:539:104:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:relative to GDP, ̄bg/ ̄Y .This parameter need not be specified in the representative-household basic NK model,
33:1201:87462:11:12:72:540:93:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:since changes in it simply imply a different steady-state level of net transfers, and the size of these does not
33:1202:87574:12:12:72:540:81:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:affect any of the equilibrium relations.  In the model with heterogeneity, it does matter, because of the failure
33:1203:87687:12:0:72:486:69:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f15:F:of Ricardian equivalence noted above.  But in our baseline calculations, we assume that ̄bg= 0.

34:1207:88082:18:18:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:output.40This value matches the median ratio of private (non-financial,  non-government,

34:1211:88459:18:18:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:important, as this results in the prediction that an exogenous tightening of monetary policy

34:1214:88738:18:18:72:405:507:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:of an identified monetary policy shock on household borrowing.42

34:1219:89187:18:18:72:540:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:no steady-state default risk (  ̄χ(b) = 0), so that the steady-state credit spread is due entirely
34:1220:89285:18:18:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to the marginal resource cost of intermediation.  But we do allow for exogenous shocks to
34:1221:89374:18:33:72:500:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the default rate (which then becomes slightly positive); specifically, we assume that
34:1222:89459:33:33:275:336:349:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:A:χt(b) =  ̃χtb,

34:1231:89992:12:15:81:539:178:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:41We  exclude  mortgage  debt  when  calibrating  the  degree  of  heterogeneity  of  preferences  in  our  model,
34:1232:90106:15:12:72:540:163:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:since mortgage debt is incurred in order to acquire an asset, rather than to consume current produced goods

35:1261:92711:18:15:81:539:292:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:44One interpretation of this function is in terms of a monitoring technology of the kind assumed in Good-

35:1270:93248:12:12:71:540:226:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:(3.15),  where ̃Ξ =k1−η.A sudden impairment of bank capital,  treated as an exogenous disturbance,  can
35:1271:93351:12:12:71:539:214:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:then be represented as a random increase in the multiplicative factor ̃Ξ.This is another form of “financial

35:1274:93628:8:12:81:507:182:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:A:45In our quarterly numerical model, this means that we choose a value such that (1 +  ̄ω)4= 1.02.

35:1277:93930:11:12:71:539:143:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:reported in the Flow of Funds).  As it happens, this value also corresponds to the median spread between the
35:1278:94038:12:9:71:531:131:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:FRB index of commercial and industrial loan rates and the federal funds rate, over the period 1986-2007.
35:1279:94142:9:0:81:211:122:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f15:A:47This requires thatη= 51.6.

36:1281:94240:26:18:72:540:661:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We begin by considering the predicted responses to aggregate disturbances of a kind that

36:1283:94417:18:18:72:539:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are  about  the  questions  to  which  itgivesanswers.   We  first  consider  the  case  of  a  linear

36:1286:94706:18:18:72:540:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in this  case we continue to find  that  for a  reasonable  parameterization  of the quantity of
36:1287:94802:18:18:72:540:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:resources used in intermediation, the existence of credit frictions makes virtually no difference
36:1288:94899:18:18:72:326:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for the predicted equilibrium responses to shocks.
36:1289:94949:18:17:89:540:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This is illustrated in Figures2-4for three particular types of exogenous disturbances.  In

36:1297:95692:18:18:72:540:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is again assumed to have an autocorrelation of 0.75, and monetary policy is conducted in
36:1298:95780:18:18:72:539:356:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:accordance with (3.13) with no random term.  Figure4 shows the corresponding equilibrium
36:1299:95868:18:18:72:540:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:responses in response to an increase in government purchases by an amount equal to one
36:1300:95954:18:18:72:193:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percent of total output.
36:1301:95978:18:18:89:539:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In each figure, the predicted impulse responses under our model with financial frictions
36:1302:96066:18:17:72:540:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(the case labeled ‘FF’ in each figure) are contrasted with those under two variant parameter-
36:1303:96159:17:18:72:540:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:izations of the model.  The case labeled ‘NoFF’ corresponds to an otherwise identical model
36:1304:96250:18:18:72:540:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in whichωt(b)≡0 and Ξt(b)≡0, but we retain the heterogeneity in preferences, parame-
36:1305:96334:18:18:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:terized in the same way as in the ‘FF’ model.  The case labeled ‘RepHH’ is one in which in
36:1306:96424:18:18:72:540:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:addition to assuming zero credit frictions, we assume identical preferences for the two types;
36:1307:96518:18:18:72:540:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this model is equivalent to a representative-household model (specifically, to the basic NK
36:1308:96609:18:19:72:539:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model as presented inWoodford,2003, chap.  4).  Comparison of these three cases allows us
36:1309:96698:19:15:81:539:158:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:48In the plots, both the inflation rate and the interest rates are reported as annualized rates, so that 0.10
36:1310:96807:15:12:72:540:143:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:means an increase in the inflation rate of 10 basis points per annum.  In terms of our quarterly model, what
36:1311:96915:12:8:72:362:131:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f15:F:is plotted is not the response ofπt, but rather the response of 4πt.
36:1312:96983:8:16:81:539:123:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:49In the present model, the spread between the deposit rate and the lending rate is exogenously fixed, and
36:1313:97089:16:12:72:540:107:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:so these two variables necessarily respond by exactly the same amount, except in the case of a shock to the
36:1314:97196:12:12:72:540:95:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:exogenous credit spread itself.  However, we include both panels as we use the same format for the figures
36:1315:97302:12:0:72:319:83:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:to follow, when inclusion of both is no longer redundant.
37:1316:97405:0:18:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to separately consider the degree to which credit frictions as opposed to heterogeneity make
37:1317:97497:18:18:72:133:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a difference.
37:1318:97510:18:18:89:540:651:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In each of Figures2 through4, we observe that the impulse responses of output, inflation,
37:1319:97599:18:18:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  the  two  interest  rates  are  virtually  identical  under  all  three  parameterizations  of  the
37:1320:97703:18:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model.   (The  same  is  true  for  the  other  aggregate  disturbances  that  have  analogs  in  the
37:1321:97804:18:18:72:540:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:representative-household model — a common disturbance to the impatience to consume of
37:1322:97889:18:18:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:all households, a disturbance to the disutility of work, a shock to government purchases, a
37:1323:97980:18:18:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shock to the tax rate,  or a shock to the wage markup — though we do not include these
37:1324:98066:18:18:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:figures here.)  We have already explained in section 2.1 why this would be true in the case
37:1325:98157:18:18:72:540:525:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that  the  resources  used  in  intermediation  are  independent  of  the  volume  of  lending.   Our
37:1326:98258:18:18:72:540:507:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:numerical  results  indicate  that  even  when  we  assume  that  intermediation  uses  resources
37:1327:98355:18:18:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(and  indeed  that  credit  spreads  are  entirely  due  to  the  marginal  resource  cost  of  making
37:1328:98457:18:17:72:540:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:additional loans), and that the required resources are proportional to the volume of lending,
37:1329:98550:17:18:72:540:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:heterogeneity and the existence of a steady-state credit spread (of a realistic magnitude) still
37:1330:98646:18:18:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:make only a negligible difference.  This is because the contribution of the banking sector to
37:1331:98739:18:18:72:540:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the overall variation in the aggregate demand for produced goods and services is still quite

37:1333:98839:18:18:89:539:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Financial frictions matter somewhat more for equilibrium dynamics if we also assume that
37:1334:98927:18:18:72:539:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:credit spreads vary endogenously with the volume of lending.  Figures5-9show equilibrium
37:1335:99015:18:18:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:responses of the same aggregate variables to a variety of types of exogenous disturbances, in
37:1336:99108:18:18:72:540:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the case of the “convex intermediation technology” calibration discussed in section 2.2.  Fig-

37:1338:99291:18:18:72:540:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for the alternative intermediation technology.  Figure8 shows the corresponding responses to
37:1339:99383:18:18:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an exogenous increase in the impatience to consume of savers; and Figure9 shows responses
37:1340:99472:18:18:72:540:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to an exogenous increase in real government debt by an amount equal to 1 percent of GDP.
37:1341:99560:18:18:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In each case, the disturbance is modeled as an AR(1) process with autoregressive coefficient
37:1342:99652:18:17:72:96:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:0.75.
37:1343:99657:17:18:89:540:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the case of the monetary policy shock (Figure5), we again find that the equilibrium
37:1344:99743:18:18:72:540:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:responses of output and inflation are nearly the same in all three models, though the ‘FF
37:1345:99832:18:18:72:540:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model’ is no longer quite so indistinguishable from the ‘NoFF’ model.  The most important
37:1346:99921:18:18:72:540:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effect of allowing for endogeneity of the credit spread is on the implied responses of interest
37:1347:100016:18:19:72:540:131:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rates to the shock. Because credit contracts in response to this shock (as noted earlier, though
37:1348:100112:19:15:81:540:112:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:50Note that in each of Figures2-4, the existence of the credit frictions in the ‘FF’ model makes a substantial
37:1349:100222:15:12:72:539:97:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:difference for the equilibrium evolution of creditbtrelative to the prediction of the ‘NoFF’ model.  However,
37:1350:100331:12:12:72:540:85:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:this change in the size of the banking sector does not have substantial consequences for aggregate output,
37:1351:100437:12:0:72:235:73:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:employment, or inflationary pressure.
38:1352:100520:0:18:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:now  by  less  than  in  Figure  2),  the  spread  between  the  lending  rate  and  the  deposit  rate
38:1353:100623:18:18:72:540:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decreases, in accordance with the empirical finding ofLown and Morgan(2002).  This means
38:1354:100711:18:18:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that the deposit rate need no longer decline as much as does the lending rate.  Moreover,
38:1355:100800:18:18:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:because the reduced spread has an expansionary effect on aggregate demand, output declines
38:1356:100890:18:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:slightly less in response to the shock than in the ‘NoFF’ model; this is also a reason for the
38:1357:100984:18:18:72:540:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:deposit rate to decline less.  Thus the most visible effect is on the predicted response of the
38:1358:101079:18:18:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:deposit rate, which is visibly smaller in the ‘FF model.’  The effects of financial frictions are
38:1359:101176:18:18:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:similarly mainly on the path of the deposit rate in the case of a shock to the sales tax rate
38:1360:101269:18:18:72:149:543:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:B:τt(not shown).
38:1361:101283:18:18:89:539:525:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The effects of financial frictions are not quite as trivial in the case of the technology shock
38:1362:101378:18:18:72:539:507:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(Figure6).  Though again the largest effect is on the path of the deposit rate, in this case the
38:1363:101474:18:18:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:endogeneity of the credit spread also has non-negligible effects on the equilibrium response
38:1364:101566:18:17:72:540:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of output.  (The primary reason for the difference is that this shock has a larger immediate
38:1365:101658:17:18:72:540:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effect on the path of credit, and hence a larger immediate effect on the equilibrium spread in
38:1366:101752:18:18:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the case of the convex technology.)  Because an increase in productivity leads to an expansion
38:1367:101846:18:18:72:540:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of credit, credit spreads now increase in the ‘FF model’; this is has a contractionary effect on
38:1368:101942:18:18:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:aggregate demand, so that output increases less than in the ‘NoFF model’.  Similar effects of
38:1369:102035:18:18:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:financial frictions are observed in the case of a disturbance to the disutility of working (an
38:1370:102129:18:18:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:exogenous increase in the multiplicative factor ̄Htin (2.23)).  The effects of an increase in

38:1372:102309:18:18:71:202:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effects shown in Figure6.
38:1373:102334:18:18:89:539:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The effects of financial frictions are even more significant in the case of a shock to gov-
38:1374:102425:18:18:71:540:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ernment purchases (Figure7) or to the consumption demand of savers (Figure8).51These
38:1375:102509:18:18:71:539:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are  both  disturbances  that  crowd  out  the  expenditure  of  private  borrowers  (as  the  most
38:1376:102608:18:18:71:539:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interest-sensitive  category  of  expenditure)  to  a  significant  extent,  and  so  substantially  re-
38:1377:102712:18:18:71:539:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:duce equilibrium borrowing and credit spreads.  In each case, the reduction in spreads has a
38:1378:102804:18:17:71:539:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:further expansionary effect on aggregate demand, so that output increases by more than in
38:1379:102893:17:18:71:166:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the ‘NoFF’ model.
38:1380:102910:18:18:89:539:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Note that the effect would be quite different in the case of a shock to the consumption
38:1381:102997:18:18:71:539:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:demand  ofborrowersrather  than  savers  (not  shown).   In  this  case,  private  credit  would
38:1382:103093:18:18:71:540:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increase rather than decreasing, and by less than in Figure8, because of the greater interest-
38:1383:103187:18:18:71:539:131:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:elasticity of the demand of borrowers; this would imply a small increase in spreads, making
38:1384:103278:18:18:71:539:113:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:the disturbance slightly less expansionary, but with a less dramatic effect than in Figure8.52
38:1385:103372:18:12:81:518:95:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:A:51The shock considered here increases the value ofcs(λ) by one percent for each possible value ofλ.
38:1386:103471:12:0:81:539:83:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:52The effect of financial frictions in this case is somewhat similar to the case of the technology shock shown
39:1387:103627:0:18:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The aggregate effects of financial frictions are even smaller in the case of a uniform increase
39:1388:103722:18:18:72:540:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the consumption demand ofbothtypes of households, since in this case the effects of the
39:1389:103812:18:18:72:498:651:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:two types of expenditure on equilibrium credit spreads partially offset one another.
39:1390:103896:18:18:89:539:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Finally,  the consequences of financial frictions are of particular qualitative significance
39:1391:103988:18:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the case of a disturbance to the path of government debt (Figure 9).  Here we consider a
39:1392:104079:18:18:72:540:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:disturbance to fiscal policy that temporarily increases the level of government debt, through
39:1393:104172:18:18:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a lump-sum transfer to households, which is then gradually taken back over a period of time,
39:1394:104264:18:18:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:so that the path of real government debt is eventually the same as it would have been in
39:1395:104352:18:18:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  absence  of  the  shock.   In  the  case  of  the  ‘NoFF  model’,Ricardian  equivalenceholds,
39:1396:104450:18:18:72:539:525:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f5:B:as  in  the  representative  household  model;  and  so  in  these  cases,  the  fiscal  shock  hasno
39:1397:104551:18:18:72:539:507:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:effecton output, inflation, or interest rates.  However, an increase in government borrowing

39:1399:104733:18:17:72:540:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reduced private borrowing implies a reduction in spreads.  This has an expansionary effect on
39:1400:104826:17:18:72:540:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:aggregate demand, with the consequence that both output and inflation increase, as shown

39:1402:104930:18:18:89:539:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To sum up, we find that under an empirically realistic calibration of the average size of
39:1403:105019:18:18:72:539:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:credit spreads, the mere existence of a positive credit spread doesnotimply any substantial

39:1407:105388:18:18:71:540:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:isvariationin credit spreads.  If spreads vary endogenously (as in our model with a convex

39:1410:105670:18:18:71:539:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:changes in the relative spending opportunities available to savers as opposed to borrowers
39:1411:105760:18:18:71:499:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:— that particularly affect the evolution of the equilibrium volume of private credit.
39:1412:105845:18:18:89:539:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Another important difference of the model with credit frictions is the possibility of exoge-

39:1417:106287:16:11:72:540:156:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:ation technology.  However, in this case (not shown) there is no reduction in credit spreads in response to the
39:1418:106398:11:12:72:540:145:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:shock, and the only consequence for aggregate demand comes from the reduction in the resources used by
39:1419:106500:12:12:72:540:133:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:the banking sector, so that shock is actually (very slightly)contractionaryin this case.  (See the Appendix
39:1420:106607:12:12:72:540:121:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:for the corresponding figure.)  But there is very little difference in the predictions of the ‘NoFF’ and ‘FF’
39:1421:106716:12:9:72:378:109:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:models in the case of that technology, so that we omit the figure here.

40:1429:107363:29:18:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We turn now to the implications of credit frictions for optimal monetary policy.  We shall

40:1470:108076:18:18:72:143:262:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in section 1.2.
40:1471:108091:18:18:89:539:244:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:While  one  might  reasonably  consider  the  optimal  use  of  fiscal  policy  for  stabilization
40:1472:108189:18:18:72:540:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:purposes as well, we shall here consider only the optimal conduct of monetary policy, taking
40:1473:108281:18:18:72:540:208:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as  given  the  state-contingent  evolution  of  the  fiscal  variables{τt,bgt}.The  problem  with
40:1474:108379:18:18:72:540:190:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which  we  are  concerned  is  thus  the  choice  of  state-contingent  paths  for  the  endogenous

40:1477:108668:18:18:72:540:136:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:one  fewer  structural  relations  per  period  than  endogenous  variables,  so  that  there  is  one

40:1480:108913:18:0:89:539:82:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We can analyze the solution to this optimization problem, by differentiating a Lagrangian
41:1481:109048:0:18:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to obtain a system of first-order conditions, that take the form of nonlinear (expectational)

41:1483:109241:18:18:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:conclusion, demonstrated in the Appendix, is that when there are no stochastic disturbances
41:1484:109332:18:18:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(i.e.,each of the exogenous variables in ̃ξttakes a constant value), the first-order conditions
41:1485:109427:18:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for optimality admit astationary(or steady state) solution, in which the rate of inflation is
41:1486:109520:18:18:72:539:597:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:zero.  Hence under an optimal policy commitment, in the absence of stochastic disturbances
41:1487:109610:18:18:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the inflation rate will eventually converge to zero;55and in the case of small enough stochastic
41:1488:109706:18:18:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:disturbances, the optimal policy commitment will involve an inflation rate that fluctuates
41:1489:109796:18:18:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:asymptotically  around  zero.   To  the  extent  that  the  disturbances  are  small  enough  for  a
41:1490:109896:18:18:72:540:525:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:linear approximation to the equilibrium relations to provide an adequate approximation to
41:1491:109985:18:18:72:539:507:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the equilibrium dynamics, optimal policy involves along-run averageinflation rate of zero,
41:1492:110075:18:18:72:211:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:even in the stochastic case.
41:1493:110103:18:17:89:540:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This result generalizes the one obtained byBenigno and Woodford(2005) for the case with
41:1494:110190:17:18:72:540:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:representative-household, and implies that the optimal inflation target is independent of the
41:1495:110283:18:18:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(average) severity of the distortions resulting from credit frictions, just as it is independent
41:1496:110379:18:18:72:540:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  the  severity  of  the  steady-state  distortions  resulting  from  market  power  in  the  goods

41:1498:110573:18:18:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:conclusions about optimal policy derived from a model that abstracts from financial frictions

41:1500:110760:18:18:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:here only to the consequences of alternative policies that imply a long-run average inflation

41:1502:110945:18:18:72:540:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we  know  that  the  optimal  policy  commitment  involves  inflation  fluctuations  around  zero,
41:1503:111043:18:18:72:540:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we  can  restrict  our  analysis  to  policies  with  that  property,  both  when  seeking  to  further

41:1505:111248:18:18:72:322:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that are intended to approximate optimal policy.

42:1517:112419:26:18:72:540:661:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Under certain simplifying assumptions, we can obtain an analytical solution for the optimal

42:1522:112857:18:18:72:540:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assumptions, we can derive a quadratic loss function for monetary stabilization policy with
42:1523:112948:18:18:72:540:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the property that minimization of the loss function is equivalent (in the case of small enough

42:1527:113337:18:18:72:228:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:proximation to optimal policy.
42:1528:113367:18:18:89:539:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We begin by using structural relation (2.15) together with the definition Ωt≡λbt/λstto
42:1529:113453:18:18:71:539:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:solve forλbtandλstas functions ofYt,Ωt,Ξt,and the exogenous disturbances.  Substituting
42:1530:113540:18:18:71:539:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:these solutions into (4.2), we obtain a period utility function ̃U(Yt,Ωt,Ξt,∆t; ̃ξt) to replace
42:1531:113635:18:18:71:539:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the functionUdefined in (4.2).  We then compute a quadratic (Taylor-series) approximation
42:1532:113724:18:18:71:540:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to  the  function ̃Uaround  the  values  of  its  arguments  in  the  zero-inflation  steady  state,
42:1533:113824:18:18:71:540:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:( ̄Y , ̄Ω, ̄Ξ,1; 0).This takes an especially simple form under the following special assumptions:
42:1534:113921:18:18:71:540:356:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(i)  the  steady-state  tax  distortion   ̄τexactly  cancels  the  distortion  resulting  from  market
42:1535:114023:18:18:71:540:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:power in the goods markets (1−τ=μp≡θ/(θ−1)), so that in the zero-inflation steady
42:1536:114104:18:18:71:539:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:state, price is equal to marginal cost; (ii) there is no steady-state wage markup ( ̄μw= 1); (iii)
42:1537:114202:18:18:71:539:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the steady-state credit spread  ̄ω= 0 (which, because of relation (3.4), implies that ̄Ω = 1 as
42:1538:114297:18:17:71:539:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:well); and (iv) there are no resources consumed by the intermediary sector in steady state
42:1539:114387:17:18:71:540:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:( ̄Ξ = 0).  Note that the assumed absence ofsteady-statedistortions of any of these kinds does
42:1540:114481:18:18:71:539:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not mean that we cannot consider the effects of these distortions; as with the other exogenous
42:1541:114575:18:18:71:539:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:disturbances, we consider the effects of small departures from the steady-state values.  But
42:1542:114667:18:18:71:539:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the special case considered in this section, each of these distortions is assumed to be of

42:1544:114851:18:18:71:539:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the gradient ̄Ξb= 0 in steady state as well, so that anyendogenousvariation in the resources
42:1545:114943:18:18:71:539:159:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:used by the banking sector is of at most second order, though we allow for variations in the
42:1546:115035:18:15:81:539:141:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:56These simplifying assumptions are not required in order to compute a valid LQ approximation to our
42:1547:115135:15:12:72:539:126:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:policy problem, as explained inBenigno and Woodford(2012).  However, in general, the algebraic expression
42:1548:115240:12:12:72:540:114:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:of the solution to the LQ problem will be complex, so we discuss it here only in a special case allowing a
42:1549:115346:12:12:72:540:102:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:solution of a simple form.  The same general method is used, however, to approximately characterize optimal

44:1611:119231:18:18:72:540:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(LQ) problem, the solution to which provides a log-linear (approximate) characterization of

44:1613:119337:17:18:89:539:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:It is noteworthy that in (4.6), both the effects of the various types of exogenous distur-

44:1615:119522:18:18:72:539:369:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the relative weightλyplaced on the output-gap stabilization objective areidentical(as
44:1616:119611:18:18:72:540:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:functions of the model parameters) to those in the corresponding derivation for the basic
44:1617:119700:18:18:72:540:333:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:NK model, modulo the need to “average” the preferences of the two types of households in

44:1619:119877:18:18:72:540:297:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:B:gt.  In particular, not only is the output gap appearing here the same one that appears in
44:1620:119967:18:18:72:540:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  aggregate-supply  relation  (3.12)  —  again  except  for  the  effect  of  the  purely  financial

44:1622:120172:18:18:72:539:243:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:B:λy=κ/θ,whereκis  the  slope  of  the  inflation/output-gap  tradeoff  in  (3.12),  again  as  in

44:1628:120734:18:18:72:540:136:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:NK model, once one defines “average” variables appropriately.  The existence of preference

44:1631:121005:18:0:72:540:82:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time variation in their opportunities for productive expenditure — does not in itself require

45:1633:121228:18:18:89:539:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:If we instead allow for time-varying financial frictions (though no steady-state distortions,
45:1634:121321:18:18:72:539:651:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f5:B:as explained above), but assume that there is noendogenousvariation in these frictions —i.e.,

45:1636:121504:18:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:— we continue to obtain a very simple characterization of optimal policy.  In this case, the

45:1638:121700:18:18:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:order), since the log-linear approximate structural relation (3.4) implies that if{ωt}is an

45:1640:121884:18:18:71:539:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of second order, so thatˆΩ2tis exogenous, at least up to a residual of orderO(||ξ||3).  Hence
45:1641:121977:18:18:72:540:525:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the loss function can be written (ignoring terms independent of policy) in the standard New

45:1649:122316:18:18:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:frictions relate to the feasible paths for inflation and the output gap, and to the path for the
45:1650:122412:18:18:72:478:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:policy rate required to implement given paths for inflation and the output gap.

45:1652:122587:18:18:72:540:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:policy, because they shift both the IS relation (3.8) and the aggregate-supply relation (3.12)).
45:1653:122683:18:18:72:540:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:However, only the latter relation represents a constraint upon the set of achievable outcomes

45:1655:122874:18:18:72:540:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on this relation is the presence of an additional additive disturbance term.  The first-order

45:1660:123363:18:18:72:540:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:conditions for optimality to be satisfied.  Just as in the basic NK model, the optimal target
45:1661:123456:18:17:72:195:176:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:criterion is of the form61

46:1671:124305:18:18:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:only can optimal policy still be characterized as “flexible inflation targeting,” but the optimal
46:1672:124402:18:39:72:536:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:target criterion is of an identical form to what is optimal in the absence of credit frictions.

46:1674:124535:26:18:72:540:550:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The implementation of an optimal policy does require the central bank to monitor the varying
46:1675:124627:18:18:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:size of the credit frictions — more precisely, the varying size of credit spreads — in order to
46:1676:124722:18:18:72:540:514:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:determine how it must act in order to ensure fulfillment of the target criterion (4.8).  These
46:1677:124816:18:17:72:540:496:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:matter for two reasons.  First, the paths of inflation and the output gap consistent with (4.8)
46:1678:124911:17:18:72:540:479:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:depend in general on the evolution of credit spreads, because of the effect of those spreads
46:1679:125003:18:18:72:540:461:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on the aggregate-supply trade-off (3.12).  And second, the path of policy rates required to
46:1680:125094:18:18:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:implement  given  (feasible)  paths  for  inflation  and  output  depends  on  the  path  of  credit

47:1715:127959:18:18:71:539:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:based reaction function.”  Because it responds directly to (observed) current expectations,

48:1750:130238:18:18:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increase is expected to be.  It is furthermore worth noting that in the limiting case in which

48:1753:130525:18:18:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:used above), it follows that the optimal reduction in the policy rate (relative to what the
48:1754:130616:18:18:72:540:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reaction  function  would  otherwise  call  for)  in  response  to  a  purely  transitory  increase  in
48:1755:130719:18:18:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:credit spreads will equal nearly 100 percent of the increase in spreads, as proposed by Taylor
48:1756:130813:18:18:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(2008) and McCulley and Toloui (2008). In this limiting case, it is really only the interest rate
48:1757:130910:18:18:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:faced by borrowers that matters for aggregate demand, and thus it is only the consequence
48:1758:130999:18:18:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the policy rate for the rate that will be faced by borrowers that matters for fulfillment
48:1759:131091:18:18:72:540:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the target criterion;  in this case the reasoning of Taylor and of McCulley and Toloui is
48:1760:131183:18:18:72:166:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:essentially correct.
48:1761:131203:18:18:89:539:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Even in the case of a less extreme parameterization of the structural model and a more
48:1762:131289:18:18:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:persistent  disturbances  to  credit  markets,  the  optimal  adjustment  can  easily  be  a  large
48:1763:131388:18:18:72:540:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fraction of the size of the increase in credit spreads. For example, in the case of the calibration
48:1764:131487:18:18:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:discussed above and in the case of a financial shock with the degree of persistence assumed in
48:1765:131581:18:17:72:540:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Figures 15 below (i.e.,an autoregressive coefficient of 0.75), the reduction in the intercept of
48:1766:131677:17:18:72:540:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the central-bank reaction function will be by about 85 basis points for each percentage point

48:1768:131868:18:18:72:540:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decisions of borrowers are not so largely responsible for the interest sensitivity of aggregate
48:1769:131963:18:18:72:540:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expenditure,  the  optimal  reduction  in  the  policy  rate  in  response  to  an  increase  in  credit
48:1770:132067:18:18:72:540:131:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spreads would be smaller.  For example, in the case thatsbσb=ssσs, the coefficient on ˆωtis
48:1771:132158:18:18:72:540:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equal to exactly−πb,while the coefficient onˆΩtis zero.  In this case, it is only optimal to
48:1772:132250:18:18:72:539:95:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reduce the policy rate byπbpercentage points for every percentage point increase in credit
48:1773:132340:18:0:72:540:77:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spreads; in this case, the optimal reaction function is most simply expressed in terms of an

49:1775:132578:18:18:72:540:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:case, the optimal response is independent of the degree of persistence of the disturbance to
49:1776:132670:18:18:72:153:651:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:credit markets.)
49:1777:132686:18:18:89:539:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:These  analytical  results  depend,  of  course,  on  a  number  of  simplifying  assumptions.
49:1778:132780:18:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Matters are more complicated, in particular, if we assume that either the resources used in

50:1818:136427:18:18:71:540:525:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stabilizes  inflation  (i.e.,strict  inflation  targeting);  the  line  marked  with  +  signs  (labeled

50:1821:136720:18:17:71:200:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:inflation targeting policy.
50:1822:136747:17:18:89:539:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the case of this kind of shock, the aggregate-supply relation (3.12) implies that there
50:1823:136837:18:18:71:539:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is little inconsistency between inflation stabilization and output-gap stabilization; and as a
50:1824:136931:18:18:71:539:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consequence strict inflation targeting and flexible inflation targeting are barely distinguish-
50:1825:137026:18:18:71:540:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:able policies.65They are also both very close to the optimal policy, confirming that in this
50:1826:137118:18:18:71:539:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:respect the analytical results of the previous section continue to provide a good approxima-
50:1827:137210:18:18:71:539:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tion.   The  Taylor  rule  is  instead  much  less  close  to  an  optimal  policy,  because  it  requires
50:1828:137316:18:18:71:539:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:policy to be tightened in response to the output increase, even when this does not represent
50:1829:137408:18:18:71:539:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:high output relative to the natural rate (which is increased by the technology shock).  Similar
50:1830:137503:18:18:71:539:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:results are obtained in the case of exogenous shocks to the disutility of labor, the demand

50:1832:137683:18:18:71:539:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:case, there is sufficiently little tension between the requirements of inflation stabilization and
50:1833:137781:18:18:71:539:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of output-gap stabilization that flexible inflation targeting and strict inflation targeting are
50:1834:137877:18:18:71:539:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:similar policies, and both are fairly close to optimal policy (while the Taylor rule is much
50:1835:137969:18:17:71:125:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:less close).
50:1836:137981:17:18:89:539:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Figure11shows the corresponding equilibrium responses in the case of a shock to the

50:1838:138155:18:18:71:539:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:it  is  one  in  which  strict  inflation  targeting  is  clearly  not  an  optimal  policy,  even  in  the
50:1839:138262:18:18:71:539:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:representative-household model, owing to the substantial “cost-push” effect of such a shock.
50:1840:138354:18:18:71:539:131:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(However, even in this case, strict inflation targeting is still more similar to optimal policy
50:1841:138449:18:19:71:539:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:than is adherence to the Taylor rule.)  The figure shows that in the case of this kind of shock,
50:1842:138545:19:15:81:539:94:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:65In fact, if we did not allow for endogeneity of the credit spread, as in the model with a linear interme-

51:1846:138931:18:18:72:105:651:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:policy.
51:1847:138938:18:18:89:539:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Figure 12 shows the corresponding equilibrium responses to a shock to the level of gov-
51:1848:139025:18:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ernment purchases (of the kind previously assumed in Figures4 and7); and Figure13shows
51:1849:139111:18:18:72:540:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the responses to a shock to the demand of savers (of the kind previously assumed in Figure
51:1850:139201:18:18:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:8).  In the case of a shock to government purchases,  strict inflation targeting is again not
51:1851:139294:18:18:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:optimal,66and in at least some respects the Taylor rule is in this case closer to the optimal
51:1852:139387:18:18:72:539:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:policy than would be strict inflation targeting.67Nonetheless, once again flexible inflation
51:1853:139479:18:18:72:540:525:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:targeting is the closest to optimal policy of the set of simple policy rules considered here,
51:1854:139572:18:18:72:540:507:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:though optimal policy would be slightly tighter in the period of the shock.  In the case of a
51:1855:139665:18:18:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shock to the demand of savers as well, flexible inflation targeting is the closest to optimal
51:1856:139758:18:17:72:540:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:policy,  though  again  optimal  policy  would  be  slightly  tighter  in  the  period  of  the  shock.
51:1857:139861:17:18:72:540:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Flexible inflation targeting is nonetheless a slightly tighter policy (initially) in response to
51:1858:139957:18:18:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the expansionary shock than strict inflation targeting would be, though it is not excessively
51:1859:140050:18:18:72:311:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tight in the way that the simple Taylor rule is.
51:1860:140098:18:18:89:539:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Figure14instead considers equilbrium responses to a shock to the demand of borrowers
51:1861:140182:18:18:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(again,  the  shock  increases  their  purchases  by  one  percent  for  a  given  marginal  utility  of
51:1862:140286:18:18:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:income).  In this case, the way in which the strict inflation targeting policy is suboptimal
51:1863:140378:18:18:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is opposite to the case of two “demand shocks” just considered:  under an optimal policy,
51:1864:140467:18:18:72:540:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:inflation would be allowed to rise slightly in response to the shock.  But again the flexible
51:1865:140560:18:18:72:540:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:inflation  targeting  policy  deviates  from  strict  inflation  targeting  in  the  correct  direction,
51:1866:140664:18:18:72:475:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:while both targeting rules are substantially better than the simple Taylor rule.
51:1867:140744:18:18:89:539:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, Figure15shows the corresponding equilibrium responses in the case of a shock
51:1868:140829:18:18:71:539:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to the default rate   ̃χt,of a size sufficient to increase the credit spreadωtby four percentage
51:1869:140925:18:18:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:points  (annualized).   This  kind  of  shock  (not  discussed  in  section  2.3  because  there  is  no
51:1870:141029:18:17:72:540:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:analogous shock in the models without financial frictions) would be quite contractionary if
51:1871:141120:17:18:72:539:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:monetary policy were conducted in accordance with an unadjusted Taylor rule.68But as in
51:1872:141207:18:18:72:540:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the case of a productivity shock (shown in Figure 10) or a shock to the disutility of labor
51:1873:141298:18:18:72:540:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:supply, either kind of inflation targeting is much closer to optimal policy.  Yet even in this
51:1874:141392:18:18:72:540:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:case, flexible inflation targeting is not quite an equivalent policy to strict inflation targeting,
51:1875:141491:18:16:81:539:131:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:66This  would  be  true  even  in  the  representative-household  model,  given  the  existence  of  steady-state
51:1876:141604:16:8:72:327:115:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:distortions, as discussed byBenigno and Woodford(2005).
51:1877:141659:8:12:81:392:107:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:A:67The response of output is more nearly optimal under the Taylor rule.
51:1878:141729:12:16:81:539:95:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:68This  effect  could  be  substantially  mitigated,  of  course,  by  a  spread-adjusted  Taylor  rule  of  the  kind
51:1879:141847:16:0:72:529:79:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:proposed byTaylor(2008).  SeeC ́urdia and Woodford(2010) for numerical analysis of rules of that kind.
52:1880:141995:0:18:72:249:687:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and is closer to the optimal policy.
52:1881:142031:18:18:89:539:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Overall, our conclusion is that while the additional distortions that were omitted in the
52:1882:142120:18:18:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:special case for which we were able to give an analytical characterization of optimal policy
52:1883:142212:18:18:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in section 3.1 are of at least some significance in our calibrated model, the flexible inflation
52:1884:142308:18:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:targeting rule (4.8) continues to provide a fairly good approximation to optimal policy, in
52:1885:142399:18:18:72:540:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:response to each of the variety of types of exogenous disturbances discussed above.69Since
52:1886:142489:18:18:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this is also the rule that characterizes optimal policy in the basic NK model, in at least this
52:1887:142584:18:18:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sense the basic NK model remains quite a good guide to policy in the kind of environment that
52:1888:142677:18:18:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we consider.  Of course, it is important to remember that the policy prescription provided by
52:1889:142770:18:18:72:540:525:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(4.8) is not a complete description of the way in which the policy rate should be adjusted: it is
52:1890:142867:18:18:72:540:507:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:still necessary to use amodelof the transmission mechanism to determine what adjustments
52:1891:142955:18:18:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the policy rate are needed to ensure that the target criterion is satisfied.  And the model
52:1892:143049:18:17:72:540:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:used for this latter purpose needs to be one that takes account of the credit frictions — in
52:1893:143141:17:18:72:540:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:particular, that takes account of the variations over time in the size of credit spreads.  But
52:1894:143235:18:18:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the target criterion around which monetary policy deliberations are structured may not need
52:1895:143326:18:46:72:384:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to be changed in response to the existence of credit frictions.
52:1896:143389:46:29:72:201:372:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:5    Conclusions
52:1897:143405:29:18:72:540:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:With  regard  to  the  most  general  question  raised  in  our  introduction  —  implications  for
52:1898:143504:18:18:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:models for policy analysis — our results suggest that the basic view of the way in which
52:1899:143592:18:18:72:540:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:monetary policy influences aggregate expenditure and inflation presented in New Keynesian
52:1900:143681:18:18:72:540:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:models need not be modified in any fundamental way as a consequence of the observation
52:1901:143767:18:18:72:540:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that substantial spreads exist on average between different interest rates in the economy, or
52:1902:143860:18:18:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that these spreads are not always constant over time. We have exhibited a simple extension of
52:1903:143953:18:18:72:540:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the basic NK model in which a time-varying positive spread exists between the interest rate
52:1904:144044:18:18:72:540:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:available to savers and the interest rate at which borrowers can borrow.  Yet in at least the
52:1905:144137:18:18:72:540:199:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:simplest version of this model, the monetary transmission mechanism is virtually identical to
52:1906:144230:18:18:72:540:181:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that of the basic NK model:  monetary policy can be viewed purely as central-bank control
52:1907:144319:18:18:72:539:163:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of a short-term nominal interest rate (the deposit rateidt), and the ways in which aggregate
52:1908:144411:18:17:72:540:145:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expenditure and inflation are determined by the expected central-bank reaction function for
52:1909:144502:17:18:72:540:128:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the policy rate (e.g.,  a Taylor rule specification) are nearly identical to those in the basic
52:1910:144597:18:18:72:540:110:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:NK model.  Hence the fundamental lessons implied by that framework for monetary policy

53:1915:145072:18:18:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:return, rather than through their control of the current short rate as such, the conclusion
53:1916:145163:18:18:72:343:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that optimal policy is history-dependent, and so on).
53:1917:145216:18:18:89:539:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This does not mean that financial frictions are irrelevant to output and inflation deter-
53:1918:145305:18:18:72:540:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mination.  Even in the simplest case of the present model, time-variation in credit spreads
53:1919:145396:18:18:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:affects both the “IS relation” between the expected path of the real policy rate and aggregate

53:1921:145580:18:18:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:simplest version of the model, these spreads simply contribute additional additive terms to
53:1922:145671:18:18:72:540:525:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:these relations,  corresponding to a new form of exogenous disturbance,  in addition to the
53:1923:145762:18:18:72:540:507:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:real sources of variation in the natural rate of interest and natural rate of output, and the
53:1924:145855:18:18:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:“cost-push” disturbances allowed for in the basic NK model.  The occurrence of such addi-
53:1925:145944:18:17:72:540:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tional disturbances matters:  successful monetary policy requires appropriate adjustment of
53:1926:146035:17:18:72:540:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the policy rate in response to disturbances, and this requires monitoring them in real time
53:1927:146126:18:18:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and correctly identifying their character as they occur.  But the effects of “financial shocks”
53:1928:146221:18:18:72:540:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the simplest version of our model with credit frictions are not fundamentally different than
53:1929:146316:18:18:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the effects of a certain linear combination of types of shocks that are already considered in
53:1930:146409:18:18:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the standard NK literature, and the appropriate response to them (from the point of view
53:1931:146497:18:18:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of stabilization of inflation and/or real activity) is the same as would be appropriate in the
53:1932:146591:18:18:72:295:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:case of that combination of familiar shocks.
53:1933:146635:18:18:89:539:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Among  other  things,  allowing  for  credit  spreads  need  not  require  any  reconsideration
53:1934:146730:18:18:72:540:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  the  often-noted  de-emphasis  of  measures  of  the  money  supply  and  sources  of  money
53:1935:146826:18:18:72:539:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:demand in standard NK models.70We have shown that it is possible to extend the basic NK
53:1936:146913:18:18:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model to incorporate time-varying credit frictions, without making any reference to money or
53:1937:147005:18:18:72:540:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:introducing a transactions role for money.  This can be interpreted as a “cashless” model in
53:1938:147097:18:18:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which there actually are no transactions balances and no government liabilities that are held
53:1939:147190:18:17:72:540:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:other than for their pecuniary returns.  But as usual, the model can also be interpreted as
53:1940:147281:17:18:72:540:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:one in which money does supply liquidity services and earns a correspondingly lower return
53:1941:147371:18:18:72:540:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:than government debt, and in which the central bank implements its interest-rate target by
53:1942:147461:18:18:72:540:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:adjusting the supply of money.  It remains the case,  under this latter interpretation,  that
53:1943:147554:18:16:81:540:149:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:70Critics of the omission of a fundamental role for monetary aggregates in NK models (e.g.,Issing, 2006;
53:1944:147658:16:12:72:540:133:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:Goodhart,2007) often point to the absence of multiple interest rates and of any role for financial interme-
53:1945:147765:12:12:72:540:121:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:diaries as a ground for suspecting the empirical relevance of such models.  Goodhart, in particular, proposes
53:1946:147874:12:12:72:540:109:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:that the absence of financial frictions in such models may account for the absence of an essential role for
53:1947:147981:12:12:72:540:97:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:money:   “by  basing  their  model  on  [frictionless  financial  markets],  the  Neo-Keynesians  are  turning  their

54:1954:148644:18:18:72:256:615:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:of aggregate activity and inflation.71
54:1955:148682:18:18:89:539:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Yet while our results suggest that in the case of many types of aggregate disturbances

54:1957:148865:18:18:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that are considered “supply” disturbances), the effects of shocks on the evolution of output,

54:1960:149145:18:18:72:540:507:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:example  is  the  effects  of  changes  in  the  path  of  government  debt  owing  to  shifts  in  fiscal
54:1961:149251:18:18:72:539:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:policy.  While the path of government debt hasnoeffects on inflation, output or interest-rate

54:1963:149434:17:18:71:539:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that the changed path of government borrowing corresponds only to a change in the time

54:1967:149793:18:18:71:539:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of fiscal variables into models used in central banks for monetary policy analysis may deserve
54:1968:149887:18:18:71:267:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a higher place on the research agenda.
54:1969:149925:18:18:89:539:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Another important consequence of allowing for credit spreads, of course, is the possibility
54:1970:150016:18:18:71:539:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of considering how a central bank should respond to observed variation in such spreads.  It is
54:1971:150110:18:18:71:539:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:often argued that widening credit spreads provide aprima faciecase for the appropriateness of
54:1972:150203:18:18:71:539:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lowering the central bank’s policy rate.  The argument commonly given is that when spreads
54:1973:150293:18:18:71:539:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increase, the terms on which it is possible to borrow are tightened, even in the absence of any
54:1974:150388:18:18:71:539:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increase in the policy rate.  If it was not desired to tighten monetary conditions, it is therefore
54:1975:150487:18:17:71:539:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:necessary to lower the policy rate, to the extent required in order to preserve the original cost
54:1976:150584:17:16:81:540:221:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:71Of course, our analysis here does not prove that it isnotof value to model the evolution of a suitably
54:1977:150688:16:12:71:539:205:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:defined  monetary  aggregate.   In  the  model  proposed  byWoodford(2015),  for  example,  the  quantity  of
54:1978:150797:12:12:71:539:193:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:“money-like” liabilities issued by private intermediaries is an important state variable, because the amount
54:1979:150905:12:12:71:539:181:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:of funding of this kind determines the amount of assets that such intermediaries will be forced to liquidate
54:1980:151013:12:12:71:539:169:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:in  the  event  that  they  are  unable  to  roll  over  their  short-term  funding,  and  this  in  term  determines  the
54:1981:151135:12:12:71:539:157:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:extent to which asset prices will be depressed in such a crisis.  Such a model allows for a type of financial
54:1982:151244:12:12:71:540:145:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:friction that we abstract from here.  But even in the model ofWoodford(2015), the relevant aggregate is not
54:1983:151351:12:12:71:539:133:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:a traditional monetary aggregate, but rather the quantity of privately issued short-term safe instruments,
54:1984:151457:12:12:71:539:121:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:such as repos or asset-backed commercial paper; and the reason it matters is not because of the ability of
54:1985:151563:12:12:71:539:109:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:such assets to substitute for some uses of government-supplied money, as in traditional monetarist theory,
54:1986:151669:12:12:71:539:97:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:but because of the consequences of the adjustment of theassetside of bank’s balance sheets that may be
54:1987:151771:12:0:71:333:85:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:required if the demand for such liabilities suddenly changes.
55:1988:151878:0:18:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of borrowing.  Authors such asMcCulley and Toloui(2008) suggest a one-for-one reduction
55:1989:151965:18:18:71:429:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the policy rate in response to increases in particular credit spreads.
55:1990:152038:18:18:89:539:651:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In our model, it is certainly right that the policy rate is not the only interest rate that
55:1991:152129:18:18:71:539:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:matters in assessing the degree to which financial conditions are expansionary.  On the other
55:1992:152222:18:18:71:539:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hand,  it  is  not  true  (except  in  a  rather  special  limiting  case)  thatonlythe  interest  rate
55:1993:152325:18:18:71:539:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:faced by borrowers matters, either; so a full offset of the observed increase in credit spreads
55:1994:152420:18:18:71:539:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:would generally be a larger interest-rate reduction than is optimal.  (A decline in the interest
55:1995:152516:18:18:71:539:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rate received by savers, with no change in the interest rate faced by borrowers, represents

55:1997:152708:18:18:71:539:525:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:some  extent.)   Moreover,  the  justification  of  a  reduction  in  the  policy  rate  in  response  to
55:1998:152813:18:18:71:539:507:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an increase in credit spreads depends on an expectation that the lower policy rate will be
55:1999:152903:18:18:71:539:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:passed through to the interest rates at which intermediaries are willing to lend; if such pass-
55:2000:152998:18:17:71:539:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:through is incomplete,  this would further reduce the extent to which it is optimal for the
55:2001:153089:17:18:71:539:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:policy rate to adjust in response to a change in credit spreads.  And even in the case of an
55:2002:153181:18:18:71:539:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:exogenous credit spread (so that changes in the policy rate are passed through one-for-one to

55:2004:153367:18:18:71:539:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is generally less than the full size of the increase in the spread, and the optimal adjustment
55:2005:153461:18:18:71:485:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is smaller the more persistent the increase in the credit spread is expected to be.
55:2006:153544:18:18:89:539:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Still  less  would  our  model  justify  the  view,  which  sometimes  appears  to  be  assumed

55:2009:153833:18:18:71:539:310:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:enough.(This is evidently what is assumed when commentators seek to judge whether policy
55:2010:153921:18:18:71:539:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rates have been cut by the right amount by looking at whether spreads remain unusually
55:2011:154007:18:18:71:424:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:large, rather than asking whether borrowing rates are actually high.)
55:2012:154076:18:18:89:539:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:It is true that an increase in spreads is a source of deadweight loss in our model, so that

55:2017:154559:18:18:71:539:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rates  will  instead  certainly  have  collateral  effects.   Even  if  monetary  policy  can  influence
55:2018:154663:18:18:71:539:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spreads, it is not obvious that this will be beneficial.  For example, in the case that spreads
55:2019:154758:18:18:71:539:131:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are endogenous because they depend on the volume of bank lending, monetary policy can
55:2020:154843:18:18:71:539:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lower spreads to the extent that it can lead to a contraction of bank lending; butthatwould
55:2021:154934:18:18:71:540:95:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f5:B:not necessarily increase efficiency, even if a reduction in the spread associated with agiven
55:2022:155027:18:0:71:539:77:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:volume of lending would enhance efficiency (by allowing more lending).  A better principle
56:2023:155163:0:18:72:539:687:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:may well be to use monetary policy to mitigate the distortionscausedby an increase in credit
56:2024:155255:18:18:72:540:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spreads, to the extent that this is possible, rather than seeking to use policy to influence the
56:2025:155351:18:18:72:194:651:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:level of spreads as such.
56:2026:155376:18:18:89:539:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:A policy rule that directs the central bank to adjust its policy rate as necessary to satisfy a
56:2027:155471:18:18:72:539:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:“flexible inflation target” willautomaticallyrequire the central bank to adjust the policy rate
56:2028:155566:18:18:72:540:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to take account of changes in the severity of financial frictions, without any need to modify
56:2029:155659:18:18:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the target criterion that the bank aims to conform with.  In our model of the transmission
56:2030:155749:18:18:72:539:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mechanism, it is the level and expected future path of theaverageinterest rate, rather than
56:2031:155840:18:18:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the policy rate, that determines whether the evolution of output and inflation should satisfy
56:2032:155933:18:18:72:540:525:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the target criterion.  When the relation between this average rate and the policy rate changes
56:2033:156027:18:18:72:540:507:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:owing to a change in the size of interest-rate spreads, the level and expected path of the policy
56:2034:156124:18:18:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rate required for conformity with the target criterion will obviously change.  The required
56:2035:156215:18:17:72:540:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:policy rate will similarly change as a result of the effects of changing credit spreads on the
56:2036:156309:17:18:72:410:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:“IS relation” and aggregate-supply relation discussed in section 2.
56:2037:156376:18:18:89:539:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:When the policy rule is specified in terms of a target criterion, it is not obvious that the
56:2038:156468:18:18:72:540:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:target criterion that should be chosen depends much on the importance of credit frictions.  In
56:2039:156562:18:18:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a particularly simple case of a model with time-varying credit frictions, we have shown that
56:2040:156654:18:18:72:539:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the optimal target criterion remainsexactly the sameas in the basic NK model:  the central
56:2041:156744:18:18:71:539:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bank should seek to stabilize a weighted average of the inflation rate and the rate of growth
56:2042:156837:18:18:71:539:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the output gap (or alternatively, to stabilize an output-gap-adjusted price level).  Under
56:2043:156930:18:18:71:539:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more general assumptions, this exact equivalence does not obtain.  Nonetheless, the target
56:2044:157020:18:18:71:539:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:criterion that would be optimal in the case of the model without credit frictions seems still
56:2045:157113:18:18:71:539:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to provide a fairly good approximation to optimal policy in the model with credit frictions,
56:2046:157205:18:18:71:539:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:when these are parameterized to be of an empirically realistic magnitude.  Because of the
56:2047:157294:18:18:71:539:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:advantages  (for  example,  from  the  point  of  view  of  communication)  of  commitment  to  a
56:2048:157391:18:18:71:539:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:simple criterion, and because of the degree to which any attempt to refine the rule would
56:2049:157480:18:17:71:539:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:depend  on  fine  details  of  the  specification  of  the  financial  frictions,  about  which  there  is
56:2050:157586:17:18:71:539:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:likely to be uncertainty in any event, our results suggest that maintaining a commitment to
56:2051:157677:18:18:71:539:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the same target criterion as would be optimal in the absence of financial frictions is not a
56:2052:157769:18:18:71:118:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bad idea.
56:2053:157778:18:18:89:539:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This suggests that a central bank shouldnot change its target criterion— what it regards
56:2054:157866:18:18:71:539:131:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as acceptable paths of inflation and real activity — at all in times of financial stress,  but
56:2055:157960:18:18:71:540:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:instead should take account of those developmentsonlyas a result of the changes that they
56:2056:158049:18:18:71:539:95:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:imply for the links between the policy rate and the evolution of the target variables,  and
56:2057:158140:18:0:71:539:77:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hence for the path of the policy rate that is required to satisfy the target criterion.  As we
57:2058:158280:0:18:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have shown, this will generally mean lowering the policy rate in response to a disturbance
57:2059:158370:18:18:72:540:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that  increases  credit  spreads;  but  the  exact  size  of  the  appropriate  response  will  involve
57:2060:158473:18:18:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:balancing  each  of  several  economic  effects  of  the  change  in  the  anticipated  path  of  credit
57:2061:158577:18:18:72:113:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spreads.
57:2062:158585:18:18:89:539:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The present analysis represents merely a first attempt at exploration of what is obviously
57:2063:158675:18:18:72:540:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a very rich terrain.  Among other obvious limitations of the present analysis, we have allowed
57:2064:158769:18:18:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for only one, very simple form of possible endogeneity of credit spreads.72Further analysis
57:2065:158860:18:18:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:will be necessary before we can judge how robust the conclusions of the present analysis are
