2:17:447:22:11:113:422:501:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:The  paper  describes  the  main  determinants  of  electricity  intensity  in twenty-
2:18:533:11:11:99:424:490:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:nine transition  economies. We  provide  an  original  analysis  on  the  way  the  local 
2:19:622:11:11:99:425:479:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:power  sector  unreliability  may  affect  the  firm-level  electricity  intensity. The  paper 
2:20:716:11:12:99:425:468:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f7:explains the different firm’s behaviour, within EU and outside EU, in front of 
2:21:795:12:11:99:424:456:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:outages  and/or  local  supply  power  quality. For  this  purpose, we  use  the Business 
2:22:882:11:11:99:424:445:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:Environment  and  Enterprise  Performance  Survey  (BEEPS) done  in  2008-2009 
2:23:960:11:11:99:425:434:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:over 2400 enterprises. Moreover, we built an innovative  measure of  the electricity 
2:24:1044:11:12:99:425:423:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:supply quality at the local-level inspired by the previous work of Guiso et al. (2004). 
2:25:1131:12:11:99:424:411:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:Our  results  indicate  that  in  non-EU  (or  insufficiently  reformed)  countries  power 
2:26:1222:11:11:99:425:400:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:sector unreliability increases firm’s electricity intensity. We estimated a potential 
2:27:1308:11:11:99:425:389:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:reduction of one-fifth of firm’s electricity intensity associated with an improvement 
2:28:1394:11:12:99:425:378:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:from the 75th percentile to the 25th percentile of the distribution of the local power 
2:29:1479:12:11:99:424:366:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:sector  unreliability.  Our  results  suggest  that  bad  quality  of  the  local  power  sector 
2:30:1576:11:11:99:424:355:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f9:seems to dampen the firms’ ability to decreases their electricity consumption, if the

3:49:2666:0:14:70:454:675:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:use. And an appropriate use of electricity should not be exerted from an overall sobriety 
3:50:2755:14:14:70:453:661:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:effort.  First,  because  of  high  economic  and  environmental  costs  associated  with  the 
3:51:2850:14:15:70:453:647:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:power  generation,  and  second,  because  of  energy  security  concerns,  especially  for  net 
3:52:2947:15:14:70:454:632:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:importers of raw materials needed to electricity production (fuel, gas, coal). This issue is 
3:53:3040:14:14:70:453:618:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:all  the  more  important  in  the  case  of  the  countries  of  Central  and  South  East  Europe 
3:54:3140:14:14:70:453:604:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:(CSE)  and  the  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States  (CIS).  An  inefficient  use  of 
3:55:3229:14:14:70:453:590:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:electricity  is  a  legacy  of  the Soviet  Union  (Engoian,  2005).  Based  on  low  utilities prices 
3:56:3332:14:15:70:453:576:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:and large capacities in the power sector, the planned economy encouraged high level of 
3:57:3419:15:14:70:453:561:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:electricity  consumption.  The  structure  of  the  economic  activity  is  thus  biased  towards 
3:58:3517:14:14:70:453:547:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:energy   and   electricity   intensive   sectors.   Enterprises   experience   large   electricity 
3:59:3616:14:14:70:453:533:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:consumption  due  partly  to  technology  backwards,  worn  plant  and  machinery,  but  also 
3:60:3710:14:15:70:453:519:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:behaviour inherited from  planned economy. An  active energy efficiency policies should 
3:61:3797:15:14:70:453:504:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:be considered as a priority for their policymakers, not only for environmental and health 
3:62:3887:14:24:70:295:490:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:priorities, but also for the competitiveness of firms.  
3:63:3942:24:14:85:453:466:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:In  the  former  command-driven  economies  poor  energy  regulatory  policies  and 
3:64:4026:14:15:70:453:452:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:decades of power sector subsidies has failed to stem the power assets deterioration and 
3:65:4114:15:14:70:453:437:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:resulted  in  over-sized  energy  intensive  sectors.  This  involved  a  particular  pattern  of 
3:66:4212:14:14:70:453:423:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:transition economies: high level of energy intensities are coupled with low power sector 
3:67:4301:14:14:70:454:409:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:performances. This  is  basically  highlighted  by  the  macro-level  evidence  (see  section  3) 
3:68:4399:14:14:70:453:395:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:and  was  often  documented in international  organization reports  (see EBRD, 2009) and 
3:69:4486:14:25:70:300:381:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:some academic papers (see Jamasb and Nepal, 2012). 
3:70:4535:25:14:85:454:356:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:The  main  objective  of  the  present  work  is  to  test  whether  we  observe  this  kind  of 
3:71:4632:14:14:70:453:342:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:evidence  at  the  firm-level.  And  thus  provide  a  crucial  argument  in favour of  deepen 
3:72:4726:14:14:70:453:328:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:power  sector  reforming  in  the  Former  Soviet  Union  (FSU)  and  South  East  European 
3:73:4818:14:15:70:453:314:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:(SEE) countries. Indeed, if higher firm electricity intensity is related to a lower quality of 
3:74:4913:15:14:70:453:299:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the  power  sector,  implementing  an  appropriate  power  reform  path  brings  a  win-win 
3:75:5005:14:14:70:453:285:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:situation.   That   is   improving   power   sector   (financial, technical and   commercial) 
3:76:5097:14:24:70:395:271:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:performances goes hand in hand with decreasing firms’ electricity expenses. 
3:77:5172:24:15:85:453:247:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:More  precisely,  we  want  to test  the  relation  between  the  reliability  of  the  local 
3:78:5265:15:14:70:453:232:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:electricity  supply  and  firm  electricity intensity. We  assume  that regional  electric  power 
3:79:5361:14:14:70:453:218:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:sector improvements should  lower  the  firm-level  power  consumption.  At  first,  because 
3:80:5454:14:14:70:454:204:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:degraded  power  utilities  sector  is  the  result  of power  companies’ bad  demand-side 
3:81:5543:14:14:70:454:190:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:management. Indeed, power companies need to  implement  necessary actions to  change 
3:82:5625:14:15:70:454:176:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the  firm  electricity  consumption behaviours inherited  from  the  planned  economy. 
3:83:5710:15:14:70:454:161:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Regions  where  the  quality  of  the  electricity  supply  is  lower  are  those  least  able  to deal 
3:84:5814:14:14:70:454:147:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:with such problems as tariffs beyond the marginal cost, invoices, theft and rubbery, weak 
3:85:5902:14:14:70:454:133:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:metric  system or contracts favouring intensive  consumers. Secondly,  because power 
3:86:5983:14:0:70:453:119:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f9:systems characterized  by  a  lower  quality are acting  as  coercive  environment  to firms’ 
4:87:6075:0:14:70:453:675:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:electricity-conserving  investments3.  Bad  quality  of  the  local  power  utilities, insufficient 
4:88:6174:14:14:70:453:661:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:information as well as low expectations of power price increase thus prevent firms from 
4:89:6256:14:24:70:305:647:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:engaging long-term and potentially costly investments. 
4:90:6310:24:15:85:454:623:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:We measure the quality of local power sector using subjective and objective questions 
4:91:6395:15:14:70:453:608:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:from the BEEPS questionnaire. This survey collects information on firm characteristics 
4:92:6482:14:14:70:453:594:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:and their business environment on twenty-nine countries of Eastern Europe and Central 
4:93:6568:14:14:70:453:580:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Asia. Our subjective measure of the local quality of the electricity supply is based on the 
4:94:6660:14:15:70:453:566:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f7:normalized coefficients of the regional dummies in an estimation of firms’ self-declared 
4:95:6749:15:14:70:453:551:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:obstacle represented by the electricity sector (see sub-section 5.2.1 for details). We expect 
4:96:6841:14:14:70:454:537:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:this  indicator  to  catch  the  different  components  of  the  electricity  supply quality. 
4:97:6934:14:14:70:453:523:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Furthermore,  in  order  to  take  into  account  for  the  potential  endogeneity  bias  of  this 
4:98:7033:14:15:70:454:509:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:measure, we compute an objective assessment of the reliability of the power sector at the 
4:99:7123:15:14:70:453:494:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:regional  level.  This  alternative  indicator  is  based  on  the  average  number  of  outages 
4:100:7220:14:14:70:454:480:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:declared  by  firms  in  each  region  during  the last  round  of  the  survey  (2007-2009). It 
4:101:7316:14:14:70:454:466:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:allows us to  control for one particular aspect  of the quality of electricity supply, i.e. the 
4:102:7410:14:25:70:371:452:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:continuity of supply, computed through the number of interruptions.  
4:103:7478:25:14:85:453:427:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:We  first  assume  that  all  firms  follow  the  same  electricity  consumption  pattern.  In  a 
4:104:7576:14:14:70:453:413:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:second  stage  we  present  our  results  for  EU  and  non-EU  enterprises.  We  divide  our 
4:105:7670:14:14:70:450:399:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:sample in two subsamples (EU and non-EU firms) and test also for reformed and non-
4:106:7752:14:14:70:453:385:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:reformed  electricity  power  supply  countries.  We  assume  that  firms  from  EU  (or 
4:107:7841:14:25:70:444:371:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:reformed country) vs. non-EU countries react differently to electricity supply problems. 
4:108:7928:25:14:85:454:346:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:After 15 years of EU integration process (1994-2008), reforms in the electricity sector 
4:109:8015:14:14:70:453:332:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:impact  the  firm  electricity  consumption.  EU  pushes  the  12  transition  economies 
4:110:8104:14:14:70:453:318:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:candidates (1994) and than new members (2004-07) to reform substantially their electric 
4:111:8192:14:15:70:453:304:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:power  sector (see  sub-section 3.2).  On  the  opposite,  in  non  EU  countries,  the  over 
4:112:8285:15:14:70:453:289:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:investment  in  the  electricity  power  supply  during  the  communist  period  was  not 
4:113:8375:14:14:70:453:275:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:reorganized and still create over capacities. Hence no policies were implemented indoor 
4:114:8463:14:24:70:270:261:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:to promote less electric intensive productions. 
4:115:8509:24:14:85:454:237:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:The  existing  literature  in  these  countries  focuses  on  the  energy  intensity  patterns  at 
4:116:8608:14:15:70:454:223:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the macro-level (Cornillie and Fankhauser, 2004) or on the effectiveness of power sector 
4:117:8696:15:14:70:453:208:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:reforms to improve electricity outputs (Jamasb et al. (2005); Zhang et al. (2008); Jamasb 
4:118:8784:14:14:70:454:194:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:and Nepal, (2012)). Still, there is no study on the micro-level determinants of electricity 
4:119:8875:14:15:70:453:180:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:intensity, neither on the way the reliability of the power sector is related to the firm’s 
4:120:8966:15:24:70:348:165:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:electricity end-use consumption. We try to fill a part of this gap.  
4:121:9034:24:14:85:453:141:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:We  aim  at  providing  evidence  that,  in  the  case  of  the  transition  economies,  a  bad 
4:122:9130:14:20:70:453:127:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:quality  of  the  local  power  sector  goes  hand  in  hand  with  higher  firm-level  electricity 
4:123:9230:20:9:70:217:107:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:                                                        
4:124:9285:9:14:70:453:98:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:3 According  to  CEER  (2011),  the  quality  of  the  power  sector  supply  can  be  divided  into  three 
4:125:9392:14:11:70:452:84:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:components:  continuity  of  electricity  supply  (outages),  voltage  disturbances  and  commercial 
4:126:9493:11:0:70:181:73:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:quality (see sub-section 5.2). 
5:127:9524:0:14:70:453:675:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:intensity. Thus, we also aim to rely on the evidence highlighted by the literature related to 
5:128:9618:14:14:70:453:661:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:power  sector  reforms.  Papers  focusing  on  the  impact  of  market-oriented  power  sector 
5:129:9713:14:15:70:453:647:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:reforms  found  it  difficult  to  establish  that  reforms  had  a  positive  effect  on  power 
5:130:9810:15:14:70:453:632:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f9:generation  capacities  but  could  have  a  beneficial  effect  on  sector’s  productivity  and 
5:131:9907:14:14:70:453:618:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:capacity  use  (Zhang  et  al.  (2008); Jamasb  and  Nepal (2012)).  For  the  special  case  of 
5:132:10003:14:14:70:453:604:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:transition economies, this result could be at least partly explained by a better end-use of 
5:133:10095:14:14:70:454:590:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:electricity implied by restructuring of the old power system. In many of these countries, 
5:134:10185:14:15:70:453:576:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:reforming  bring  a  better  use  of  the  existing  generation  capacities,  with  an  upgrading  of 
5:135:10287:15:14:70:453:561:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the provided service. Improved reliability of the power sector can imply higher electricity 
5:136:10379:14:14:70:453:547:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f9:prices,  demand-side management  of  the  consumption  and  making  firm’s  electricity 
5:137:10467:14:14:70:453:533:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:efficiency investments more profitable. Our findings thus underline the necessity for the 
5:138:10557:14:15:70:453:519:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:countries  where  electricity  sector  reforms  are  less  implemented  to  go  deeper  in  the 
5:139:10653:15:24:70:153:504:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:reforming process. 
5:140:10671:24:14:85:454:480:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:We use an innovative two-steps approach in order to measure the quality of the local 
5:141:10756:14:14:70:453:466:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:electricity sector in twenty-nine transition economies. We adapt the approach developed 
5:142:10844:14:15:70:453:452:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:by  Guiso  et  al.  (2004)  who  assess  the  development  of  the  local  financial  markets  in 
5:143:10942:15:14:70:453:437:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:different  Italian  regions.  They  estimate  regional  financial  development  indicators  by 
5:144:11037:14:14:70:453:423:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:adding  regional  dummies  in  the  individual  subjective  assessments  of  financial  obstacle. 
5:145:11135:14:14:70:453:409:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Ranking  those  regional  dummies  allows  having  a  good  proxy  for  regional  financial 
5:146:11227:14:14:70:453:395:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:development. To  our  knowledge,  we  are  the  first  to  introduce  this  approach  outside  of 
5:147:11325:14:15:70:453:381:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the financial markets development concerns. In order to take into account for the quality 
5:148:11415:15:14:70:453:366:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:of  the  electricity  sector,  we  compute  a  regional  indicator  reflecting  local  electric  sector 
5:149:11519:14:14:70:453:352:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:underdevelopment.  The  methodological  approach  of  Guiso  et  al.  (2004)  seems  to  be 
5:150:11611:14:14:70:453:338:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:particularly fitting for the structure of the electricity sector. Indeed, inside each country, 
5:151:11706:14:15:70:454:324:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:we can  expect  a large variation  of the quality of the electricity service depending of the 
5:152:11800:15:24:70:340:309:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:local development of the electricity market and infrastructures. 
5:153:11864:24:14:85:453:285:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:The  contributions  of  this  paper  are  two-fold.  First,  it  is  an  important  input  to  the 
5:154:11963:14:14:70:453:271:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:relatively  scarce  literature  on  the  firm-level  determinants  of  electricity  intensity  in  the 
5:155:12066:14:15:70:453:257:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:countries  of  the  former  Soviet  bloc.  It  underlines  the  role  played  by  many  previously 
5:156:12165:15:14:70:453:242:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:used firm characteristic variables. In particular, the firm size, the size of locality, the age, 
5:157:12262:14:14:70:454:228:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the ownership structure and different inputs are taken into account. Second, supporting 
5:158:12350:14:14:70:454:214:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:some  previous  macro-related  empirical  papers  (Cornillie  and  Fankhauser (2002);  Zhang 
5:159:12442:14:14:70:454:200:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:et  al.  (2008); Jamasb  and  Nepal (2012)),  our  findings  highlight  the  link  between  the 
5:160:12537:14:15:70:453:186:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:quality  of  the  local  power  sector  and  the  electricity  intensity  of  firms.  Indeed,  it  seems 
5:161:12642:15:14:70:453:171:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:that  better  quality  of the  local  electricity  utilities  is  related  to  lower  firm-level  electricity 
5:162:12752:14:14:70:453:157:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:intensity,  but  only  in  the  countries  where  power  sector  reforms  are  insufficiently 
5:163:12846:14:14:70:453:143:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:implemented. Thus, this paper is a complement to the literature of the effect of reforms 
5:164:12935:14:15:70:453:129:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:on power sector performances in transition economies. It seems that the lack of reforms 
5:165:13023:15:14:70:453:114:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:in the power sector decreases the ability of the power sector to upgrade its network and 
5:166:13112:14:14:70:453:100:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:to  enhance  the  quality  of  the  provided service,  while  maintaining  the  high  firm-level 
5:167:13209:14:0:70:175:86:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:electricity consumption. 
6:168:13234:0:14:85:454:675:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:This  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  Next  section  presents  the  main  contributions  of 
6:169:13330:14:14:70:453:661:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the literature as regarding our empirical question. Section 3 addresses an overall overview 
6:170:13422:14:15:70:453:647:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:of  the  electricity sector  in  our  sample  of  countries  and  provides  the  evolutions  of their 
6:171:13524:15:14:70:453:632:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:power  sector  reforms.  In  section  4,  we  present  and  discuss  the  data  and  the  empirical 
6:172:13624:14:14:70:453:618:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:strategy.  Section  5  discusses  in  detail  our  econometric  results  and  finally  section  5

6:176:13791:25:14:70:453:531:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:This paper is at the crossroads of two literatures: the literature on energy intensity and its 
6:177:13886:14:14:70:453:517:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:micro-level   determinants   and   the   literature   on   the   specificities   of   the   electricity 
6:178:13990:14:14:70:453:503:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:distribution  utilities  and  power  sector  reforms  in  the  former  communist  countries  of 
6:179:14086:14:15:70:453:489:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Europe  and  Central  Asia. However,  to  our  knowledge  there  are  no  papers  focusing  on 
6:180:14181:15:14:70:453:474:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the  firm-level  electricity  intensity  in  the  case  of  transition  countries.  By  contrast,  a 
6:181:14282:14:14:70:454:460:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:growing literature  examine  how  firm  level  characteristics  (Fisher-Vanden  et  al.  (2004); 
6:182:14378:14:14:70:453:446:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Bloom  et  al.  (2010);  Martin  et  al.  (2012);  Morikawa  (2012))  or  some  economic  barriers 
6:183:14477:14:14:70:453:432:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:(DeCagnio  (1998);  Brown  (2001);  Trianni  and  Cagno  (2012))  are  related  to  the  energy 
6:184:14573:14:15:70:453:418:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:intensity of firms in several developed countries. We focus our attention to the first set 
6:185:14664:15:24:70:290:403:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:of papers, which is closer to our empirical strategy. 
6:186:14717:24:14:85:453:379:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Fisher-Vanden et al. (2004) uses a structural model of a Cobb-Douglas cost function 
6:187:14801:14:14:70:453:365:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:for the functional form of their estimation to identify drivers determining the decrease in 
6:188:14892:14:15:70:453:351:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:energy  intensity  of  2500  medium  and  large-sized  Chinese  industrial  firms.  From  a  cost 
6:189:14990:15:14:70:453:336:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:minimization  program,  they  derive  the  firm-level  factor  demand  for  energy.  They  have 
6:190:15086:14:14:70:453:322:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:found  that  changes  in  relative  energy  prices  and  R&D  expenditures  are  the  main 
6:191:15177:14:14:70:453:308:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:contributors  to  the  decline  in  firm-level  energy  intensity.  To  a  lesser  extent,  shifts  in 
6:192:15280:14:15:70:453:294:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:output  across  industry,  in  ownership  and  region  have  contributed  to  the  variation  in 
6:193:15377:15:24:70:145:279:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:energy intensity.  
6:194:15395:24:14:85:453:255:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f9:The  paper  of  Morikawa  (2012)  brings  another  insight  about  the  firms’  energy 
6:195:15482:14:14:70:453:241:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:intensity and  disentangles the role played by some regional characteristics. In  particular, 
6:196:15576:14:15:70:453:227:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the  author  underlies  a  positive  relationship  between  population  density  and  the  energy 
6:197:15674:15:14:70:454:212:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:efficiency  consumption  in  service  enterprises.  When  the  population  density  of  the 
6:198:15766:14:14:70:453:198:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:locality  doubles,  the  author  estimates  a  12%  decrease  of  firm-level  energy  intensity  in 
6:199:15866:14:14:70:453:184:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:services sector. He also emphasizes a negative link between capital and labour intensities 
6:200:15957:14:14:70:453:170:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:and energy  efficiency. We  try  to  take  into  account  for  this  potential  effect  by  adding 
6:201:16055:14:25:70:287:156:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:locality size dummies in our empirical estimations. 
6:202:16106:25:14:85:454:131:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Finally, some empirical papers emphasize the crucial role of organizational structures 
6:203:16193:14:14:70:453:117:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:and   management   best   practices   on   enhancing   firm-level   energy   efficiency.   Using 
6:204:16290:14:14:70:453:103:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:information  about  firm’s  managerial  quality  and  census  data  containing  energy 
6:205:16377:14:15:70:450:89:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:consumption  expenditures  of  UK  establishments,  Bloom  et  al.  (2010)  find  that  better-
6:206:16472:15:0:70:453:74:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:managed  plants  are  significantly  less  energy  intensive.  This  relationship  seems  to  be 
7:207:16570:0:14:70:450:675:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f7:related  to  the  firm’s  productivity.  Better-managed  firms  adopt  modern  and  energy-
7:208:16661:14:14:70:453:661:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:efficient  measures,  which  increase  their  productivity.  The  authors  estimate  that  an 
7:209:16755:14:15:70:453:647:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:improvement  from  the  bottom  to  the  top  quartile  of  their  management  variable  is 
7:210:16847:15:14:70:453:632:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:associated  with  a  17%  increase  in  energy  efficiency.  The  paper  of  Martin  et  al.  (2012) 
7:211:16948:14:14:70:453:618:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:provides  further  evidence  about  the  negative  link  between  management  practices  and 
7:212:17041:14:14:70:453:604:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f9:energy intensity. They argue that better  management  is also related to the firm’s energy 
7:213:17132:14:14:70:453:590:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:efficiency  innovations  (process  and  product).  Moreover,  they  provide  another  finding 
7:214:17226:14:15:70:453:576:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:about the role played by organizational structure. Firms where energy issues are devoted

7:217:17504:14:14:70:453:533:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:empirical  approach  is  inspired  by  the  works  of  Bloom  et  al.  (2010)  and  Martin  et  al.

7:220:17708:14:14:70:453:480:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:and restructuring on the performances of the electricity sector4. Zhang et al. (2008) look 
7:221:17799:14:14:70:453:466:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:at the performances gains related to privatization, competition and regulation reforms in 
7:222:17889:14:15:70:453:452:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the electricity sector in a set of transition and developing countries. They do not observe 
7:223:17981:15:14:70:453:437:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:obvious  productivity  or  generation  gains  related  to  privatization  or  regulation  reforms, 
7:224:18080:14:14:70:453:423:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:but  emphasize  a  positive  and  significant  effects  related  to  competition  reforms.  The 
7:225:18176:14:14:70:454:409:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:paper  of  Jamasb  and  Nepal (2012)  bring  new  insights  of  the  market-oriented  power 
7:226:18268:14:14:70:453:395:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:reforms patterns across the transition countries since 1990. They argue that the impact of 
7:227:18359:14:15:70:453:381:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:power sector reforms on  power sector, economic and  environmental outcomes depend 
7:228:18442:15:14:70:453:366:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:on  the  implementation  of  wider  institutional  reforms.  Using  panel  data  econometrics, 
7:229:18537:14:14:70:453:352:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:they  highlight  several  interesting  results.  In  particular,  it  seems  that  the  power  sector 
7:230:18639:14:14:70:453:338:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:reforms  have  no  significant  effect  on  per  capita  generation  installed  capacity.  Whereas 
7:231:18738:14:15:70:453:324:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the  impact  is  negative on  per  capita  transmission  and  distribution  losses.  The  effect 
7:232:18834:15:14:70:453:309:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:seems to be all the more important when the power reforms are implemented along with 
7:233:18919:14:14:70:453:295:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:a  more  liberalized  economy.  These  results  confirm  the  idea  that  the  countries  in  the 
7:234:19017:14:14:70:450:281:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:former  Soviet  bloc  inherited  of  excessive  generation  capacities.  Implementing  market-
7:235:19111:14:14:70:453:267:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:oriented  power  reforms  seemed  to  enhance  the  quality  of  the  distribution  system  and 
7:236:19207:14:15:70:453:253:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:allows  a  better  use  of  the  existing  generation  capacities.  The  results  of  our  firm-level 
7:237:19309:15:14:70:453:238:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:estimations  support these  findings.  Our  paper  provides  an  original  analysis  on  the  way 
7:238:19407:14:14:70:453:224:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:the firm’s electricity intensity could be related to the quality of the local power sector in 
7:239:19501:14:15:70:453:210:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the countries of the former Soviet  bloc. Appropriate electricity sector reforms can  thus 
7:240:19592:15:14:70:450:195:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:improve the quality of the power distribution utilities while also accompanying the firm-

8:249:20065:24:14:85:454:651:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:In  this section  we try to present  the main mechanisms which  can  explain a negative 
8:250:20153:14:14:70:453:637:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:link  between  firm-level  electricity  intensity  and  the  quality  of  the  local  power  sector. 
8:251:20254:14:15:70:454:623:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:First, we briefly describe the scheme of the involved mechanisms. Then, we present the 
8:252:20336:15:14:70:453:608:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:macroeconomic background explaining the relationship between electricity intensity, the 
8:253:20424:14:14:70:454:594:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:quality  of  the  electricity  systems  and  reforms  of  the  power  sector  (sub-section  3.1)  and 
8:254:20526:14:14:70:454:580:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:how  far  the  EU  electricity  reform  model  (sub-section  3.2)  was  implemented in  our 
8:255:20617:14:25:70:233:566:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:sample of countries (sub-section 3.3). 
8:256:20655:25:14:85:453:541:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:During  the  pre-transition  period,  overinvestment  was  predominant  in  the  power 
8:257:20742:14:14:70:453:527:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:sector. The electricity system in most countries in transition were heavily subsidized and 
8:258:20833:14:14:70:453:513:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:centralized. They were designed to favour and promote heavy industry, provide universal 
8:259:20920:14:15:70:453:499:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:access for the population and were characterized by reasonably acceptable service quality. 
8:260:21011:15:14:70:453:484:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:But their financial performance was poor because they were not designed for efficiency, 
8:261:21099:14:14:70:453:470:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:either  in  power  production  or end  use.  The  cost-plus  pricing  gives  no  incentive  to  cut 
8:262:21198:14:14:70:453:456:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:waste  or  remove  inefficient  technologies.  Rigid  price  controls  depress  profits  and 
8:263:21291:14:15:70:453:442:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:discourage  new  investment.  The  problem  is  particularly  shape  in  the  former  Soviet 
8:264:21384:15:14:70:454:427:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Union (FSU) countries, since the infrastructure was developed on non-market principles 
8:265:21471:14:14:70:453:413:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:since  a  longer  time  period.  As  the  countries  began  transitioning  to  a  market  economy, 
8:266:21570:14:14:70:453:399:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the design of these electricity distribution utilities often became financially unsustainable. 
8:267:21665:14:14:70:454:385:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:The power assets are working significantly beyond their intended life spans. Finally, high 
8:268:21756:14:15:70:453:371:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:total  losses  and  poor  collection  rates,  due  to  weak  metering,  billing  and  payment 
8:269:21850:15:14:70:453:356:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:collection  accounted  for  the  companies’  financial  distress.  Yet,  not  all  the  countries 
8:270:21948:14:14:70:453:342:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:implemented  the  necessary set  of  reforms  in  order  to  restructure  the  power  sector  and 
8:271:22046:14:14:70:453:328:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:make  it  efficient.  Starting  in  the  1990s,  most  EU  accession  countries  and  few  FSU 
8:272:22141:14:15:70:453:314:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:countries   have   successfully   privatized   their   distribution   companies.   However,   the 
8:273:22239:15:14:70:454:299:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:financial  situation  remains  almost  unchanged  and  the  financial  performance  of  power 
8:274:22333:14:14:70:453:285:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:sector  enterprises  is  poor  in  most  of  the  countries  in  the  former  Soviet  bloc  (World 
8:275:22432:14:24:70:127:271:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Bank, 2010). 
8:276:22444:24:15:85:453:247:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:After  the  URSS  collapse  the  countries  in  the  former  Soviet  bloc  inherited  of  large 
8:277:22540:15:14:70:453:232:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:power   generation   capacities   and   highly   electricity   intensive   economic   structures 
8:278:22637:14:14:70:453:218:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:(Engoian, 2005). But during the transition process, the lack of financial performance of 
8:279:22726:14:14:70:453:204:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the  power  sector  lead  to  the  depletion  of  the  electricity  utilities.  Moreover,  due  to 
8:280:22825:14:14:70:453:190:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:insufficient  market  and  out-of-market  incentives,  the  private  sector  of  many  of  those 
8:281:22922:14:15:70:453:176:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:countries  still  does  not  rationalize  its  electricity  consumption.  Thus,  in  the  countries 
8:282:23022:15:14:70:453:161:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:unable to implement appropriate power sector reforms, we observed the emergence of a 
8:283:23107:14:14:70:453:147:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:dual problem: falling quality of the provided power services and high level of electricity 
8:284:23198:14:14:70:453:133:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:inefficiency of the productive activity. The figure 1 summarizes very roughly the path of 
8:285:23288:14:15:70:453:119:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:reforms  followed  by  the  former  Soviet  bloc  countries  and  their  consequences.  We  can 
8:286:23384:15:14:70:453:104:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:thus dissociate the EU and non-EU countries (mainly FSU countries). The new members 
8:287:23468:14:14:70:453:90:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:of  the  EU  were  able  to  implement  the  power  sector  reforms  needed  to  increase  the 
8:288:23563:14:0:70:454:76:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:financial reliability and thus the overall quality of the sector. These reforms also provide 
9:289:23656:0:14:70:454:675:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:appropriate incentives to rationalize the electricity consumption of the power end-users. 
9:290:23746:14:14:70:453:661:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:At the contrary, insufficiently reformed power sectors lead to the depletion of the overall 
9:291:23838:14:15:70:454:647:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:reliability of the sector whereas maintain high level of end-use inefficiency and disallows 
9:292:23930:15:14:70:450:632:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:individual  energy  saving  investments.  The  macroeconomic  facts  presented  below  (sub-

10:331:25557:24:14:85:451:267:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f9:The  evolutions  in  the  figure 2 are  pretty  consistent  with  the  global  trends –
10:332:25643:14:15:70:453:253:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:convergence– in  those  economies.  Comparing  to  the  rest  of  the  region,  the  EU  new 
10:333:25735:15:14:70:453:238:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:members group has the lower electricity intensity. But in recent years, since 2007, we can 
10:334:25826:14:14:70:453:224:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:see a  stabilization  of  the  electricity  intensity  evolution.  The  EU  new  members  are 
10:335:25920:14:14:70:453:210:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:converging with one clear outlier: Bulgaria. Bulgaria, and, to a lesser extent, Romania and 
10:336:26012:14:15:70:454:196:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Czech Republic, have not improved so quickly their electricity efficiency (see figure 7 in 
10:337:26100:15:14:70:453:181:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the appendix). Possible reasons are the lack of foreign investment, but also the delay in 
10:338:26189:14:14:70:454:167:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:implementing  reforms  in  the  electricity  sector  (see  next  sub-section).  An  additional 
10:339:26284:14:14:70:454:153:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:reason  may  be  the  development  of  the  unrecorded  economy,  which  is  using  electricity 
10:340:26380:14:25:70:345:139:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:without declaring any output (Kaufmann and Kaliberda, 1996).

10:342:26527:14:14:70:453:100:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:countries.  The  main  reason  is  probably  the  wars  in  former  Yugoslavia  (1991-1999). 
10:343:26620:14:0:70:453:86:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Serbia  is  a  clear  example  of  war  outliers.  The  war  period  had  created  unrecorded

11:354:26896:14:14:70:453:661:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:one of the less efficient countries in our sample, due to its implication in three different 
11:355:26989:14:24:70:342:647:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:conflicts between 1991and 1999 (see figure 7 in the appendix).  
11:356:27049:24:15:85:453:623:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Finally,  CIS  countries  are  by  far  the  less  efficient  countries  among  transition 
11:357:27140:15:14:70:453:608:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:economies.  As  in  SEE,  the  countries  with  an  experience  of  war  have  the  worse  results 
11:358:27239:14:14:70:453:594:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:(i.e. Tajikistan). But the first period of transition (1990-96) was also, for those economies, 
11:359:27333:14:14:70:453:580:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:a shock in terms of electricity intensity. Most of the countries have only improved their 
11:360:27423:14:15:70:453:566:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:situation  after  1995.  It  can  be  noted  that  there  are  two  outliers – Tajikistan  and  the 
11:361:27522:15:14:70:453:551:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Kyrgyz  Republic – with  electricity  intensity  up  to  nine  times  higher  than  some  CIS 
11:362:27615:14:24:70:118:537:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:countries.  
11:363:27626:24:14:85:454:513:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Overall, at the end of the period, we observe for all the groups a slow-down or a little 
11:364:27715:14:15:70:454:499:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:increase  (for  SEE)  of  the power intensity,  whereas  all  these countries  are  still  far  from

11:366:27909:14:14:70:453:470:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:notice a break in 1994-1995 of the evolution of electricity intensity and economic growth 
11:367:27999:14:14:70:453:456:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:in  the  whole  region.  In  2009,  the  less  electricity  intensive  country  (Slovenia)  in  our 
11:368:28099:14:15:70:453:442:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:sample, has still consumed more electricity in order to produce one dollar of production, 
11:369:28189:15:23:70:390:427:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:compare to the average of OECD countries (see figure 7 in the appendix).

11:376:28683:24:14:85:453:101:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Based on cross-country data, we can see in figure 3, that better quality of the electric

12:383:29255:15:14:70:453:632:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:an  enhancement  of  the  power  sector  performances  in  these  countries  was  positively 
12:384:29348:14:14:70:453:618:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:related with a decreasing use of power energy to produce each unit of GDP. Of course a

12:396:30178:24:14:85:454:203:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Our main argument is related to  the fact  that market-oriented power sector reforms 
12:397:30263:14:15:70:454:189:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:aim at increasing the reliability of the power sector and decreasing the initial distortions 
12:398:30356:15:14:70:453:174:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:in  the  power  consumption.  Thus,  figure  4  plots  the  level  of  power  distribution  and

13:408:31500:14:15:70:453:647:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:adopted  these  reforms  are  those  displaying  the  higher  performances  of  their  electric

13:410:31637:24:24:88:236:608:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:3.2 EU Electricity Reform Model 
13:411:31667:24:14:70:453:584:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:The  EU  electric  power  sector  reform  framework  is  based  on  four  main  points:  the 
13:412:31760:14:14:70:453:570:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:creation  of  an independent  sector  regulator,  legal  unbundling  of  transmission  and 
13:413:31851:14:15:70:453:556:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:distribution businesses, reduced entry barriers and market opening to competition for all 
13:414:31941:15:14:70:453:541:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:customers. The theoretical paradigm of this reform model is thus largely inspired by the 
13:415:32030:14:14:70:453:527:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Single  Market  agenda:  efficient  regulation  of  limited  natural  monopolies  and  increased

13:417:32219:14:15:70:453:499:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:suggested   by   the   theories   of   regulation   (Joscow,   2007),   the   natural   monopoly 
13:418:32316:15:14:70:453:484:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:prerogatives are essential, but must be regulated through an independent and unpowered 
13:419:32403:14:14:70:453:470:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:control agency. Increased number of firms and reduced entry barriers are also needed in 
13:420:32491:14:24:70:339:456:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:order to deepen competition within the stages of production.

14:453:33780:24:14:70:454:651:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Figure 5 presents  the  evolution  of  electric  power  reforms  in  transition  economies. The 
14:454:33874:14:14:70:454:637:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:EU  countries  (see  table 9 in the appendix  for  the  list  of  countries)  do  have  the  best 
14:455:33969:14:15:70:453:623:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:results  mainly  due  to  the acquis communautaire regulations.  However  some  countries  may 
14:456:34063:15:14:70:454:608:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:experience  a  reverse  reform  process,  for  example  Hungary  or  Estonia. Most  of  the 
14:457:34155:14:14:70:453:594:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:improvements have been done in the period between the application to EU (1994) and 
14:458:34238:14:24:70:176:580:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the accession (2004-07). 
14:459:34262:24:15:85:453:556:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:On the contrary, in South East Europe, the evolution of reforms was unstable, due to 
14:460:34347:15:14:70:453:541:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the  wars  (1991-1999)  in  the  former  Yugoslavia.  Many  reforms  were  delayed  by  five  or 
14:461:34444:14:14:70:453:527:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:even ten years. The electricity market is still not very transparent in the region, and this 
14:462:34537:14:24:70:309:513:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:probably impacts the electricity cost for the enterprises. 
14:463:34595:24:15:85:453:489:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:As  we  can  see,  countries  in  the  CIS  region  have  experienced  very  different  reform 
14:464:34690:15:14:70:453:474:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:path. Most of the Central Asia and South CIS countries have delayed their reforms in the 
14:465:34779:14:14:70:453:460:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:electricity sector compared to Russia, and Ukraine. However, we observe some backward 
14:466:34865:14:23:70:170:446:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:policies in the region.

15:502:36508:15:14:70:453:464:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Reconstruction   and  Development   and   the   World  Bank   create   the BEEPS on   a 
15:503:36595:14:14:70:454:450:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:representative  sample  of  private  sector  firms  in  twenty-nine  countries from  Central 
15:504:36687:14:14:70:454:436:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Europe to Central  Asia  (for  the  last  round  of  the  BEEPS,  in  2008-2009).  The  survey 
15:505:36782:14:15:70:453:422:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:covers  a  large  set  of  topics,  including  corruption,  access to  finance,  crime,  justice  and 
15:506:36884:15:14:70:450:407:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:some firm performances measures. Thus, the objective of the BEEPS is to collect firm-
15:507:36969:14:14:70:453:393:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:level  information  in  order  to  assess  the  influence  of  enterprise’s  characteristics  and 
15:508:37067:14:14:70:454:379:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:several  institutional  factors  on  firm  behaviours  and performances.  There  were  four 
15:509:37159:14:14:70:453:365:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:rounds  of  survey  undertaken  since  1999-2000,  over  a  sample  of  4000  to  around  12000 
15:510:37255:14:15:70:454:351:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:firms in 2008-2009. There are a relatively small proportion of observations allowing us to 
15:511:37346:15:14:70:454:336:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:build  real  panel  data,  especially  concerning  our  research  question.  Indeed,  we  are 
15:512:37440:14:14:70:453:322:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:constrained to use only the last round of the survey, which includes questions concerning 
15:513:37530:14:14:70:453:308:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f7:firm’s electricity expenses. But  all  the  rounds  contain  information  about  regions  where 
15:514:37626:14:15:70:454:294:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:firms  are  located,  which  will  be  of  use  to  build  our  indicator  of  local  power  supply 
15:515:37726:15:24:70:115:279:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:reliability. 
15:516:37738:24:14:85:453:255:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:To build the firm-level electricity intensity variable we have used two questions. The 
15:517:37825:14:14:70:453:241:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:first one concerning the firm’s electricity consumption: “For fiscal year 2007, please 
15:518:37912:14:15:70:453:227:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:provide  the  following  information  about  this  establishment:  total  annual  costs  of 
15:519:38004:15:14:70:453:212:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:electricity”. The second question concerns the sales turnover: “In fiscal year 2007, what 
15:520:38094:14:14:70:453:198:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f7:where  this  establishment’s  total  annual  sales?”6 These  two  questions  allow  us  to 
15:521:38184:14:14:70:454:184:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:construct  our  dependent  variable  as  the  ratio  of  electricity  expenses  over  total  sales 
15:522:38283:14:14:70:453:170:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:during the year 2007 (see table 11 in the appendix for detailed description of variables).

15:524:38470:15:14:70:453:141:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:informative to look at the raw distribution of our dependent variable as regarding some

16:532:38963:25:14:85:454:598:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:As we can see in small cities, the use of electricity is rather inefficient compare to big 
16:533:39054:14:14:70:453:584:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f7:cities. Transition appears to be more “successful” in large cities, where  also  probably

17:562:39879:0:14:85:454:675:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:We can also notice that private de novo firms are on average by far the more electricity 
17:563:39966:14:14:70:453:661:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:efficient.  As  expected  state-owned  and  formerly  state-owned  firms  are  the  more 
17:564:40055:14:15:70:453:647:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:electricity   intensive,   due   probably   to   a   weaken   budget   constraint   and   remaining 
17:565:40155:15:14:70:450:632:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:consumption  behaviours from  the planned economy system. The privatization  of state-
17:566:40241:14:24:70:362:618:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:owned firms did not seem to decrease their electricity cost intensity. 
17:567:40311:24:14:85:453:594:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:Following the figure, the enterprise’s age affects intensity in two different ways. We 
17:568:40398:14:14:70:453:580:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:observe that the more energy intensive firms are at the extremes of the age distribution. 
17:569:40488:14:15:70:453:566:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Enterprises  created  before  the  USSR  collapse  (more  than  twenty  years  ago)  are  more 
17:570:40583:15:14:70:453:551:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:electricity intensive maybe due to their overall specialization in energy intensive sectors, 
17:571:40676:14:14:70:453:537:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:and also because of inherited obsolete processes and technologies. In the other side, the 
17:572:40766:14:14:70:453:523:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:younger  firms  are  also  more  electricity  intensive,  probably  because  of  a  scale  effect 
17:573:40864:14:15:70:453:509:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:accompanying  a  smaller  size  on  average  of  younger  companies.  Between  those  two 
17:574:40954:15:24:70:452:494:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:extremes, firms seem to be more electricity efficient without real gaps across the groups.  
17:575:41045:24:14:85:453:470:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:Finally  the  power  energy  intensity  is  negatively  correlated  with  firms’  size.  Large 
17:576:41140:14:14:70:453:456:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:enterprises tend to be more efficient in their use of electricity. Benefitting of economies 
17:577:41232:14:15:70:454:442:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:of  scale,  large  firms  are  more  able  to  implement  new  technologies  and  increase  their 
17:578:41330:15:24:70:161:427:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:overall productivity.  
17:579:41352:24:24:88:188:403:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:4.3 Empirical Strategy 
17:580:41373:24:14:70:453:379:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:To investigate the determinants of firms’ electricity intensity and assess specific effects of 
17:581:41468:14:14:70:454:365:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:power   sector   and   financial   constraints,   we   consider   the   following   econometrical 
17:582:41566:14:25:70:129:351:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:specification: 
17:583:41580:25:24:70:450:326:10:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f7:                                                                            (1) 
17:584:41631:24:15:70:453:302:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:where electricity  intensity =  electricity  expenditure  over  total  sales, Y =  total  sales, L = 
17:585:41730:15:14:70:454:287:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:labour (number  of  employees), K =  capital  (net  book  value  of  machinery,  vehicles, 
17:586:41819:14:14:70:453:273:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:equipment,  land  and  buildings).  Lower  case  letters  indicate  natural  logarithms,  for 
17:587:41913:14:14:70:454:259:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:example y = ln(Y). Z is a vector of control variables that could affect electricity intensity, 
17:588:42006:14:14:70:453:245:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:i.e. a set of firms’ characteristics (age, share of employees with university degree, ratio of 
17:589:42101:14:15:70:453:231:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:current annual sales to annual sales three years ago, way the firm was established) and a 
17:590:42191:15:14:70:453:216:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:proxy for population density (dummy variable for the size of the locality). The estimation 
17:591:42281:14:14:70:454:202:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:also  includes  2-digit  industry  dummies  and  country  dummies  respectively  indexed  by j 
17:592:42375:14:24:70:97:188:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:and c. 
17:593:42381:24:25:85:407:164:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:The detailed description of variables is given in the appendix (see table 11). 
17:594:42458:25:14:85:453:139:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:There  is  no  selection bias  due  to  the  fact  that  almost  no  enterprise  declares  zero 
17:595:42554:14:0:70:352:125:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:electricity costs (1.7% answered they have zero electricity costs).   
18:596:42625:0:14:85:453:675:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Our specification  is  based  on  the  approach  adopted  in  the  energy related  literature7. 
18:597:42721:14:24:70:451:661:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Nevertheless, from our electricity cost share equation a number of concerns might arise.  
18:598:42808:24:14:85:454:637:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Because  in  the  BEEPS  dataset  we  do  not  have  firm  specific  prices,  our  dependent 
18:599:42901:14:15:70:453:623:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:variable captures both variations in quantities and prices. Electricity intensive firms might 
18:600:42995:15:14:70:453:608:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:be  able  to  charge  higher  prices for  their  products  and  thus  reducing  the  electricity  cost 
18:601:43097:14:14:70:453:594:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:share, as expressed above. In order to take into account such a mark-up effect, we use an 
18:602:43187:14:14:70:453:580:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:alternative measure of electricity intensity, the electricity expenditures over variable costs 
18:603:43282:14:15:70:453:566:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:(total  cost of labour,  intermediates,  fuel,  power  and  other  utilities)  as  the  dependent 
18:604:43380:15:24:70:112:551:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:variable.  
18:605:43390:24:14:85:453:527:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Second,  to  ensure  that  our  results  are  not  driven  by  the  choice  of  variables  used  in 
18:606:43490:14:14:70:454:513:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:our  basic  specification  we  repeat  our  regressions  with  an  alternative  specification. The 
18:607:43588:14:15:70:453:499:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:main  justification  for  using  the  cost  share  equation  (1)  is  that  such  a  specification  is  in 
18:608:43695:15:14:70:454:484:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:line  with  the  usual  translog factor  demand  equation  (Christensen  et  al.  (1971)).  But,  we 
18:609:43796:14:14:70:453:470:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:also try to test our results with another econometrical specification, including a proxy for 
18:610:43888:14:14:70:454:456:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:wage  and  investment  measures  instead  of labour and  capital  variables.    Using  this  2nd 
18:611:43983:14:24:70:343:442:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:specification does not change fundamentally our main findings. 
18:612:44045:24:15:85:454:418:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f7:In the following section, we present our first regression’s results and we discuss and

18:616:44153:24:15:70:453:331:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:We  organise  the  econometric  analysis  in  the  following  way:  first  we  present  a  simple 
18:617:44251:15:14:70:453:316:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:specification with and without a management variable (5.1), then we describe and include 
18:618:44338:14:14:70:453:302:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:our indicator of the power sector quality at the local level (5.2), and finally we present the 
18:619:44429:14:14:70:450:288:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:results  for  the  two  sub-samples  of  EU  and  non-EU  members  (5.3). In the  last  sub-
18:620:44519:14:15:70:453:274:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:section we run  some  sensitivity  analysis  in  order to  test  the  robustness of  our  findings.

18:622:44624:24:24:88:301:235:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:5.1 Preliminary Regression’s Results (see table 1) 
18:623:44673:24:14:70:453:211:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:We  have  more  than  2200  observations  on  the  enterprise  level.  We  use  two  different 
18:624:44768:14:15:70:453:197:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:measures of electricity intensity. We can control for sectors and countries specific effects. 
18:625:44862:15:14:70:453:182:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:The results are similar for the electricity intensity and the share of electricity cost. In both 
18:626:44957:14:14:70:453:168:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:specifications   we   include   progressively   the   control   variables   (firm   characteristics, 
18:627:45058:14:35:70:453:154:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:settlement size and  type of ownership)  to  check for the stability of the coefficients and

18:630:45303:13:9:70:99:96:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:(2011). 
18:631:45310:9:14:70:453:87:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:8 All the variables are in local currency unit, when we use a common currency the results remains 
18:632:45407:14:0:70:341:73:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:very similar. Country dummies capture almost all the nominal effects. 
19:633:45478:0:14:70:453:675:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:reliability of our regressions. For all the specifications the coefficients are very stable and 
19:634:45574:14:24:70:151:661:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:remain significant. 
19:635:45593:24:14:85:454:637:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:We found out that the enterprise number of employees does significantly increase the 
19:636:45678:14:15:70:453:623:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:electricity  intensity.  The  number  of  employees  is  significant  and  increases  the  intensity. 
19:637:45780:15:14:70:453:608:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Furthermore,  the  amount  of  capital  tends  to  increase  the  intensity.  Capital  and  labour 
19:638:45879:14:14:70:453:594:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:seems  not  to  be  used  in  order  to  produce  at  lower  energy  costs.  It  seems  that  more 
19:639:45978:14:14:70:453:580:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:labour and capital intensive firms require more electricity intensive. Similar relationships 
19:640:46071:14:15:70:454:566:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:were find by Bloom et al. (2010) and Morikawa (2012) between energy intensity, capital 
19:641:46158:15:14:70:453:551:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:and labour variables. Those results also echo the empirical evidence of Berndt and Wood 
19:642:46246:14:14:70:453:537:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:(1975)  among  others.  They  found  that  energy  and  capital  are  complementary  and  that 
19:643:46341:14:14:70:453:523:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:energy  and labour  are  weakly  separable.  This  last  point  implies  that  more  employment 
19:644:46437:14:25:70:240:509:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:also needs more energy consumption9.  
19:645:46474:25:14:85:453:484:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:The age of the firm  does not  have any statistical significance once we introduce the 
19:646:46561:14:14:70:453:470:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:privatization dummies. In fact privatization includes part of the firm age effect. There is 
19:647:46653:14:24:70:402:456:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:also probably a non-linear effect of age on the energy intensity (see figure 6).  
19:648:46734:24:14:85:453:432:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:A  more  optimistic  result  is  provided  by  the  sales:  larger  sales  tend  to  increase  the 
19:649:46833:14:15:70:453:418:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:intensity.   We   are   probably   capturing   some   economies   of   scale.   In   addition,   the 
19:650:46934:15:14:70:453:403:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:performance  of the  firm  in terms of  actual sales  compared  to  three  years  ago seems  to 
19:651:47030:14:14:70:453:389:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:reduce the intensity. Higher sales may reflect  a higher demand  for the firm  production. 
19:652:47121:14:14:70:454:375:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:On  short  term,  the  easier  way  to  address  this  demand  is  to use  more  intensively  the 
19:653:47219:14:25:70:367:361:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:available capital stock and labour increasing the energy consumption. 
19:654:47288:25:14:85:453:336:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Originally,  private  firms  (de novo)  are  less  spending  on  electricity  per  unit  sold.  This 
19:655:47389:14:14:70:454:322:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:finding  is  strong,  significant  and  stable  over  all  of  our  estimations.  This  result  echoes 
19:656:47492:14:14:70:454:308:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:previous  literature  treating of  the  effect  of de novo privatization  on  different  variables  of 
19:657:47595:14:15:70:454:294:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f7:firm’s performances like growth, productivity, innovation, etc. (Fisher and Sahay, 2000). 
19:658:47684:15:14:70:454:279:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:The   enterprise   performance,   in   terms   of   sales,   tends   to   decrease   the   electricity 
19:659:47787:14:24:70:135:265:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:consumption.  
19:660:47800:24:14:85:454:241:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Our paper contributes to the discussion on the management quality and allocation of

19:662:47983:15:14:70:454:212:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:intensity.  This  result  might  differ  from  the previous  studies  of  Bloom  et  al.  (2010)  and 
19:663:48085:14:46:70:356:198:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Martin et al. (2011) because of our proxy of management quality10.

19:665:48206:9:14:70:452:143:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:9 There  has  been  extensive  research  on  the  substitutability  or  complementarities  between  energy 
19:666:48312:14:11:70:452:129:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:and  other  inputs.  Unfortunately,  our  database  limitations  do  not  allow  us  to  strongly  relate  our 
19:667:48423:11:11:70:453:118:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:findings  to  this  literature.  Indeed,  we  are  unable  to  deal  properly  with the  issue  of  elasticity 
19:668:48533:11:11:70:450:107:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:between energy and other production factors because we lack input prices information and time-

19:670:48639:9:14:70:450:87:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:10 The variable of management is a dummy equal to 1 if the establishment has an internationally-
19:671:48734:14:0:70:341:73:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:recognized quality certification (like ISO 9000 or 14000 for example).

20:673:48897:14:14:70:454:661:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:important since Russia is a much larger country compared to others in our sample. The 
20:674:48983:14:24:70:387:647:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:results remain also stable without the enterprises from the services sector. 
20:675:49059:24:25:88:301:623:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:5.2 Indicator of Local Power Sector Unreliability 
20:676:49107:25:14:70:453:598:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:The energy intensity related literature (Cornillie and Fankhauser, 2004) highlights the role 
20:677:49199:14:14:70:453:584:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:played  by  the  electricity  sector  in  maintaining  high  levels  of  energy  consumption  in 
20:678:49296:14:14:70:453:570:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Transition economies. In the same way, the EBRD 2011 special report argues that power 
20:679:49382:14:15:70:453:556:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:sector underdevelopment is one of the main drivers explaining electricity inefficiency in 
20:680:49472:15:14:70:454:541:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:this region, especially in former Soviet Union countries. Indeed, insufficient reforms and 
20:681:49563:14:14:70:453:527:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:underinvestment  in  the  electricity  sector  could  lead  to  the  deterioration  of  the  electric 
20:682:49665:14:14:70:454:513:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:power supply. In this case, low electricity price goes hand in hand with low quality of the 
20:683:49756:14:25:70:455:499:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:provided service, involving disruptions, inadequate quality and bureaucratic disturbances.  
20:684:49847:25:14:85:454:474:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:The  quality  of  the  power  sector  supply  can  be  divided  into  three  components: 
20:685:49936:14:14:70:453:460:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:continuity  of  supply,  voltage  disturbances  and  commercial  quality  (CEER,  2011).  The 
20:686:50030:14:14:70:453:446:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:continuity  of  supply  refers  to  the  availability  of  electricity  without  interruptions –or 
20:687:50129:14:14:70:453:432:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:outages (programmed or not). The availability of electricity supply thus affects end-user 
20:688:50219:14:15:70:453:418:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:consumers  through  the  number  and  the  duration  of  power  supply  interruptions.  The 
20:689:50311:15:14:70:453:403:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:voltage  disturbances  represent  the  adequacy  of  the  technical  properties  of  the  supplied 
20:690:50410:14:14:70:453:389:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:electricity  and  its  usefulness  for  consumers.  It  is  basically  related  to  the  distortions  of 
20:691:50515:14:14:70:453:375:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:voltage  properties  of  the  supplied  electricity  from  their  nominal  values  (frequency, 
20:692:50610:14:15:70:453:361:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:magnitude,  wave  shape,  etc.).  The  voltage  quality  impacts  on  the  electricity  appliances 
20:693:50709:15:14:70:453:346:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:and  processes.  And  it  is  all  the  more  important  for  the  industrial  sector,  where  proper 
20:694:50811:14:14:70:453:332:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:functioning  of  machines  and  processes  may  be  severely  affected  (damages,  reduced 
20:695:50902:14:14:70:453:318:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:efficiency,  breakdowns  or  even  inability  to  operate).  The  commercial  quality  aspect  is 
20:696:51000:14:15:70:453:304:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:related  to  the  capacity  and  the  speed  of  the  power  companies  to  handle  with  the 
20:697:51094:15:14:70:453:289:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:consumer  requests.  It  concerns  such  services  as  repairing  quality  voltage  problems  and 
20:698:51192:14:14:70:454:275:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:meter verification as well as new connections or adjustment of the connection capacity. 
20:699:51280:14:24:70:452:261:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:We can also point out the availability of voltage quality in line with the end-user requests. 
20:700:51372:24:14:85:453:237:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Unfortunately we do not have access to first hand information indicating the quality 
20:701:51457:14:15:70:453:223:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:of  the  local  power sector  for  the  whole span  of  countries.  Still,  in  order  to  estimate  an 
20:702:51561:15:14:70:453:208:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:indicator of power sector  quality  at  the  local  level  we  can  use  information  contained  in 
20:703:51661:14:14:70:453:194:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the  BEEPS  (EBRD)  surveys.  Indeed,  those  surveys  were  undertaken  in  order  to  assess 
20:704:51756:14:15:70:453:180:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the  business  environment  in  the  countries  of  the  former  Soviet  bloc.  Thus,  one  of  the 
20:705:51856:15:14:70:453:165:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:sections  of  the  BEEPS  aims  to  evaluate  the  electricity  access  and  reliability  faced  by 
20:706:51956:14:14:70:453:151:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:firms.  In  particular,  the  BEEPS  ask  firms  whether  electricity  is  an  obstacle  for  their 
20:707:52056:14:24:70:154:137:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:current operations. 
20:708:52075:24:14:85:453:113:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:Using in our estimation the direct response of the firms’ declared obstacle can lead to 
20:709:52163:14:15:70:453:99:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:some  endogeneity  concerns,  as  electricity  intensive  firms  might  feel  more  constrained 
20:710:52259:15:0:70:453:84:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:when the supply of their main input is problematic. In order to take into account for the 
21:711:52351:0:14:70:453:675:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:quality  of  electricity  supply  faced  by  firms,  we  compute  a  regional  indicator  reflecting 
21:712:52452:14:14:70:453:661:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:local electric power unreliability. Regions where the power sector is less reliable are those 
21:713:52546:14:24:70:364:647:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:where, ceteris paribus, the declared obstacle in electricity is the higher.  
21:714:52621:24:15:85:454:623:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:However,  if  inside  each  region  the  electricity  intensive  firms  are  not  normally 
21:715:52712:15:14:70:453:608:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:distributed, we still might face to the problem of endogeneity. That is why we also use an 
21:716:52803:14:14:70:453:594:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:objective measure of the quality of the electricity sector. For doing so, we compute, from 
21:717:52894:14:14:70:453:580:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the  last  round  of  the  BEEPS  survey,  the  average  number  of  power  outages  at  the 
21:718:52987:14:15:70:453:566:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:regional  level.  This  variable  is  thus  based  on  the  number  of  outages  reported  by  each 
21:719:53087:15:14:70:453:551:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:firm of the survey listed in the same region. In this way, this second indicator serves as 
21:720:53178:14:14:70:453:537:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:robustness check for our results, because it should not depend, at least positively, on the 
21:721:53270:14:24:70:202:523:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:firm-level electricity intensity.  
21:722:53303:24:15:85:454:499:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Using  an  indicator  of  regional  variation  of  the  power  sector quality  instead  of 
21:723:53393:15:14:70:453:484:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:individual  measure  seems  to  be  particularly  fitting  for  the  structure  of  the  electricity 
21:724:53494:14:14:70:453:470:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:sector.  Indeed,  we  can  expect  in  a  given  region  all  the  end-use  consumers  to  face  the 
21:725:53595:14:14:70:453:456:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:same electric network and the same power generation plants. Inside each country we can 
21:726:53682:14:15:70:453:442:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:expect  a  large  variation  of  the  quality  of  the  electricity  service  depending  of  the  local 
21:727:53786:15:24:70:320:427:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:development of the electricity market and infrastructures.  
21:728:53845:24:14:85:454:403:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:We  follow  a  two  step  procedure  in  order  to  assess  the  indicator  of  local  electric 
21:729:53941:14:14:70:453:389:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:power  sector  reliability.  Our  approach  is  inspired  by  the  paper  of  Guiso  et  al.  (2004). 
21:730:54043:14:14:70:453:375:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Distinguishing  differences  in  financial  development  between  different  regions  of  Italy, 
21:731:54140:14:15:70:454:361:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:their  paper highlights the positive impact  of the development of local financial markets 
21:732:54231:15:14:70:453:346:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:on  several  microeconomic  variables  (competition,  entry  of  new  firms,  growth).  This 
21:733:54324:14:14:70:453:332:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:approach computes regional financial development scores by adding region dummies in 
21:734:54408:14:14:70:453:318:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the  estimation  of  individual  subjective  assessment  of  the  extent  of  financial access. 
21:735:54504:14:15:70:453:304:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Ranking  those  regional  dummies  allows  having  a  good  proxy  for  regional  financial 
21:736:54596:15:14:70:454:289:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:development.  This  method  has  been  used  by  Villegas-Sanchez  (2008)  to  highlight  the 
21:737:54690:14:24:70:362:275:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:role of local financial markets in externalities conveyed by the FDI.  
21:738:54760:24:14:85:453:251:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:To  catch up the regional power sector unreliability, we compute the probability that 
21:739:54845:14:14:70:453:237:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:electricity is a major obstacle to the current operations of a firm. This first estimation is 
21:740:54939:14:15:70:453:223:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:done using pooled cross-sectional data from the last three rounds of the BEEPS (2002, 
21:741:55025:15:14:70:453:208:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:2005 and  2009).  The  information  contained  in  this  kind  of  dependent  variable  is  a 
21:742:55118:14:14:70:453:194:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:patchwork  of  diverse  failures  and/or  malfunctions  in  the  local  power  sector.  It  can  be 
21:743:55218:14:15:70:453:180:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:related to inadequate or insufficient power energy supply as well some “governance” 
21:744:55302:15:14:70:453:165:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:shortcomings,  as  bureaucratic  failures  or  corruption.  Thus,  we  believe  that  this  variable 
21:745:55403:14:24:70:388:151:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:contains an individual subjective measure of local power sector reliability.  
21:746:55480:24:24:88:184:127:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:5.2.1 Methodology 
21:747:55496:24:14:70:454:103:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:We  assume  that  the  underlined  obstacle  faced  by  enterprises  can  be  described  by  the 
21:748:55592:14:0:70:218:89:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:following econometrical equation: 
22:749:55627:0:24:70:437:675:11:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:                                                                         (2) 
22:750:55682:24:15:70:454:651:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f7:where “Electricity obstacle” is a dummy variable denoting an obstacle reported by firm i in 
22:751:55773:15:14:70:454:636:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f9:electricity  sector.  This  dummy  equals to 1 if a firm reports that electricity is a “very 
22:752:55866:14:14:70:453:622:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:severe” or a “major” obstacle to its current operations, and 0 otherwise (“no”, “minor” 
22:753:55954:14:14:70:453:608:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f7:or “moderate” obstacle)11. X is a vector of firm specific attributes that might explain the 
22:754:56045:14:15:70:453:594:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f7:enterprise’s underlying  response  to  the  electricity  obstacle.  In  the  equation  (2)  we  also 
22:755:56146:15:14:70:453:579:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:include year and 2-digit industry dummies respectively indexed by t and j. That allows us 
22:756:56234:14:14:70:454:565:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:to control for unobserved year-specific12 and industry-specific factors that impact on the 
22:757:56324:14:24:70:156:551:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:dependent variable. 
22:758:56343:24:15:85:453:527:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:Our  variable  of  interest  is  “Region”.  Indeed,  the  measure  of  local  power  sector 
22:759:56435:15:14:70:454:512:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:unreliability will be the ranking provided by the coefficients γ of the regional dummies k. 
22:760:56526:14:14:70:453:498:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:The Imereti region in Georgia provides the higher coefficient of electricity obstacle (see 
22:761:56617:14:14:70:453:484:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:sub-section  5.2.2),  thus  indicating  the  worth  power  sector  reliability  throughout  our 
22:762:56713:14:14:70:453:470:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:sample and according  to  our  indicator.  As  a  consequence, we  set  this  region  as  the 
22:763:56804:14:15:70:454:456:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:reference region in our estimation (table 2). Comparing to Imereti the coefficients of all 
22:764:56894:15:14:70:453:441:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:other  regions  should  display  a  negative  sign.  In  this  way,  the  minimum  regional 
22:765:56986:14:14:70:453:427:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:coefficient should  indicate  the  higher  quality  of  the  local  power  sector. For  ease  of 
22:766:57081:14:14:70:454:413:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:interpretation,  we  transform  our  regional  coefficients  into  indicator  varying  between  0 
22:767:57179:14:15:70:453:399:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:and  1,  indicating  local  power  sector  unreliability.  Therefore,  we  normalize  the  regional 
22:768:57279:15:25:70:205:384:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:dummy coefficients as follows: 
22:769:57309:25:7:70:364:359:11:g_d0_f7:7:g_d0_f14:

22:772:57374:28:24:70:273:331:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:with γk, the coefficient of the region dummy k. 
22:773:57420:24:15:85:453:307:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:In  the  sub-section  5.3  we  will  add  our  indicator  of  local  power  sector  quality  in  the 
22:774:57521:15:14:70:453:292:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:regression  of  electricity  intensity.  One  of  our  regressors  will  thus  be  estimated  from  a 
22:775:57623:14:14:70:453:278:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f9:preliminary procedure. Pagan (1984) calls it a “generated regressor”. Using this generated 
22:776:57713:14:14:70:453:264:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:regressor in the OLS regression should produce consistent estimates of all parameters, if 
22:777:57803:14:15:70:453:250:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the usual OLS assumption  in  the population holds—that  the error term  is uncorrelated 
22:778:57892:15:14:70:454:235:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:with the set of explanatory variables (see Wooldridge, 2002, p.115-116). But the statistical 
22:779:57985:14:14:70:453:221:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:inference  leaves  us  with  a  problem  due  to  the  sampling  variation  in  the  estimated 
22:780:58080:14:14:70:454:207:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:coefficients  of  the  generated  regressor.  The  standards  errors  and  test  statistics in  the 
22:781:58180:14:15:70:453:193:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:second  step  are  invalid,  because  the  estimated  coefficients  of  the  generated  regressor 
22:782:58278:15:14:70:453:178:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:depend also on the similar random sample used in the second stage estimation (it is not

22:784:58464:23:9:70:217:141:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:                                                        
22:785:58519:9:14:70:453:132:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f9:11 The related question in the BEEPS is: “Is electricity no obstacle, a minor obstacle, a moderate 
22:786:58617:14:11:70:452:118:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:obstacle,   a   major   obstacle,   or   a   very   severe   obstacle   to   the   current   operations   of   this 
22:787:58733:11:9:70:134:107:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f7:establishment?” 
22:788:58748:9:14:70:453:98:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:12 The  year  dummy  variable  corresponds  to  the  year  in  which  the  was  interviewed,  but  due  to 
22:789:58854:14:11:70:452:84:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:organizational  matters  during  the  BEEPS  last  round,  all  the  countries  were  not  surveyed  during 
22:790:58962:11:0:70:338:73:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f17:the same year (there are only 17 over 29 countries surveyed in 2009). 
23:791:59033:0:14:70:453:675:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:asymptotically valid in the second stage procedure, we need to compute an adjustment to 
23:792:59121:14:14:70:453:661:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the  common  variance  matrix  estimate  that  accounts  for  the  variability  in  the  estimated 
23:793:59220:14:15:70:453:647:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:coefficients  of  the  generated  regressor.  We  use  a  popular  resampling method,  i.e. 
23:794:59311:15:14:70:453:632:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:bootstrapping, for obtaining standards errors, confidence intervals and  p-values for test 
23:795:59402:14:24:70:114:618:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:statistics.  
23:796:59414:24:24:88:228:594:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:5.2.2 Estimation (see table 2) 
23:797:59442:24:14:70:453:570:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:In table 2 we have estimated, from the base of BEEPS 2002, 2005 and 2009, an indicator 
23:798:59529:14:15:70:453:556:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:of regional power sector quality. We compute, with a probit model, the probability that 
23:799:59617:15:14:70:453:541:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:electricity  is  a  major  or  very  severe  obstacle  to  the  current  operations  of  a  firm.  The 
23:800:59720:14:14:70:453:527:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:choice  of  the  specification  is  based  on  the  existing  literature13.  We  include  industry 
23:801:59819:14:14:70:454:513:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:dummies   in   the   estimation to   control   for   sector-specific   characteristics   possibly 
23:802:59916:14:25:70:320:499:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f7:influencing firms’ differentiated needs in electricity input.  
23:803:59978:25:14:88:453:474:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:Our results do not exhibit strong evidence about the impact of the firms’ specific 
23:804:60061:14:14:70:453:460:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:characteristics. Larger and older firms do not report  a lower constraint  of the access to 
23:805:60153:14:14:70:453:446:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:electricity supply. However, firms declaring payments overdue for utilities tend to report 
23:806:60244:14:14:70:453:432:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:significantly  higher  electricity  obstacle.  This  is  probably  because  non-paying  enterprises 
23:807:60344:14:15:70:454:418:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:get  disconnected  or  because  payments  arrears  are  related  to  insufficiently  reformed 
23:808:60438:15:14:70:453:403:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:electricity sector. We have also added in our estimation year dummies to capturing some 
23:809:60526:14:14:70:453:389:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:year’s fixed effects. We can see that in the last round of the BEEPS (2009), firms report 
23:810:60616:14:14:70:454:375:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:significantly  higher  electricity  obstacle.  In  addition,  we  have  included  in  our  estimate 
23:811:60716:14:15:70:453:361:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:regional  dummies,  capturing  power  sector  quality  differences  across  different  regions 
23:812:60811:15:14:70:453:346:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:inside  each  country.  Comparing  to  the  reference  region  (Imereti,  in  Georgia)  all  other 
23:813:60910:14:14:70:454:332:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:local  dummies  display a  negative  and  significant  coefficient14.  In  order  to  obtain  the 
23:814:61007:14:14:70:453:318:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:indicator   of   local   electricity   reliability,   we   have   normalized   the   regional   dummy 
23:815:61109:14:15:70:453:304:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:coefficients  as  explained  in  the  previous  sub-section.  The  increase  of  this  variable 
23:816:61205:15:14:70:453:289:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:indicates thus a decreasing quality of the electricity supply at the local level. Finally, our 
23:817:61298:14:24:70:436:275:11:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f8:indicator of local power sector reliability covers 137 regions in twenty-nine countries. 
23:818:61385:24:24:88:377:251:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:5.2.3 Local power unreliability and firm-level electricity intensity 
23:819:61451:24:15:70:453:227:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:In this last sub-section, we try to test whether firms facing higher regional unreliability of 
23:820:61546:15:14:70:453:212:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the power sector experience higher electricity intensity. We first introduce two different 
23:821:61637:14:14:70:453:198:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:measures  of  the  electricity  sector  quality  on  the  whole  sample,  before  testing  our  main 
23:822:61738:14:21:70:454:184:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:assumption by splitting the sample according to the level of institutional reforms of the 
23:823:61828:21:9:70:217:163:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:                                                        
23:824:61883:9:13:70:452:154:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f9:13 Gelb  et  al.  (2007)  estimated  for  example  the  firms’  perceptions  of  some  environmental 
23:825:61983:13:12:70:452:141:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:constraints,  including  electricity.  The  paper  by  Vagliasindi  (2004)  analyzes  the  development  of 
23:826:62090:12:11:70:454:129:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:electricity infrastructures in transition economies using the information of BEEPS 2002 database. 
23:827:62188:11:11:70:452:118:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:Highlighting  some  macroeconomic  aspects  determining  the  quality  of  electricity  infrastructures, 
23:828:62293:11:11:70:452:107:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:the author also uses several firm characteristic variables to explain the number of power outages 
23:829:62391:11:9:70:151:96:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:faced by enterprises. 
23:830:62412:9:14:70:453:87:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:14 Except  the  Durres  region (in  Georgia)  which  is  not  significantly  different  from  Imereti.  We 
23:831:62517:14:0:70:199:73:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f17:thus set its value to 0, as Imereti. 
24:832:62555:0:14:70:454:675:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:countries.  The  splitting  is  thus  based  on  the  EU  belonging (see  tables  5,  6  and  8) or 
24:833:62655:14:14:70:453:661:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:alternatively  to  the  extent  of  market-oriented  power  sector  reforms  undertaken  in  the 
24:834:62752:14:24:70:262:647:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:countries (see below the robustness checks). 
24:835:62795:24:25:70:181:623:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:Main results (tables 3 and 4) 
24:836:62824:25:14:70:453:598:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:In tables 3 and 4, we present the results of the regression where we include the quality of 
24:837:62914:14:14:70:453:584:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the  electricity  service  at  the  local  level – measured  using  subjective  and  objective 
24:838:63007:14:24:70:178:570:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:questions from BEEPS.  
24:839:63029:24:15:88:453:546:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Our main finding is that, for the whole sample, lower reliability of the power sector 
24:840:63115:15:14:70:453:531:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:has a positive but not significant effect on electricity consumption at the enterprise level. 
24:841:63209:14:14:70:454:517:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:However,  when  we  use  our  objective  indicator  of  the  power  unreliability  (table  4),  the 
24:842:63309:14:14:70:453:503:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:relationship becomes positive. As previously argued we expect the relationship between 
24:843:63396:14:15:70:453:489:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:firm electricity intensity and the local power sector quality to be different as regarding the 
24:844:63491:15:14:70:454:474:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:level of appropriate reforms introduced in a given country. Thus, throughout the whole 
24:845:63578:14:14:70:453:460:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:sample  the  impact  of  the  local  power  sector  quality  should  not  exert  any  significant 
24:846:63676:14:14:70:453:446:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:effect.  Indeed,  the positive effect  found  in  the  table  4  is  probably  due  to  the  weight  of 
24:847:63780:14:14:70:453:432:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the  countries  with  lower  level  of  power  sector reforms  (about  2/3  of  the  firms  in  the 
24:848:63880:14:15:70:453:418:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:sample).  To  take  it  into  account  we  thus  split  our  sample  according  to  two  basic 
24:849:63975:15:14:70:453:403:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:indicators of institutional reforms: the belonging or not to the EU (tables 5, 6 and 8) and 
24:850:64066:14:24:70:360:389:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f10:the extent of market-oriented reforms in the power sector (table 7). 
24:851:64132:24:24:70:225:365:11:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f8:Going into the details (see tables 5 and 6) 
24:852:64174:24:15:70:454:341:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:As  we  observe  in  figures  1,  3  and  4,  EU  new  members  implemented  new  reforms 
24:853:64263:15:14:70:454:326:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:(EBRD  index) in  the  power  sector  and  achieved better  performance  in  the  electricity 
24:854:64356:14:14:70:453:312:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:consumption.  We  think  that firms  behave  differently  according  to  the  institutional 
24:855:64448:14:14:70:453:298:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:framework they belong to. Hence we use the same specification as in table 3 and  4 but 
24:856:64535:14:15:70:453:284:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:we  split  our  sample  in  EU  and  non-EU  members  in  2008  (for  the  list  of  countries  see 
24:857:64635:15:14:70:453:269:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:table 9). Table 5 reports our main results. Column 1 simply regresses electricity intensity 
24:858:64726:14:14:70:453:255:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:on  local  power  sector  unreliability,  controlling  for  labour  and  capital  use  and  potential 
24:859:64828:14:14:70:453:241:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:scale effects. Outside the EU, lower quality of the local electricity supply is positively and 
24:860:64923:14:15:70:453:227:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:significantly  associated  with  higher  electricity  intensity.  We  introduce  firm  controls  in 
24:861:65023:15:14:70:454:212:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:column  2  and  the form  of  ownership in  column  3.  The  coefficient  of  power  sector 
24:862:65115:14:14:70:453:198:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:unreliability  is not  significantly  affected  by  their  inclusion  although  its size  is somewhat 
24:863:65217:14:14:70:453:184:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:lower  once  we  introduce  the  private de  novo dummy  (originally  private,  from  start-up). 
24:864:65314:14:14:70:453:170:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Interestingly,  the  introduction  of  locality  size  dummies  (column  4)  does  not  decrease 
24:865:65411:14:15:70:454:156:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:substantially the point estimate of our main variable of interest. There should be clearly 
24:866:65502:15:14:70:453:141:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:partial  correlation  between  our  indicator  of  local  electricity  unreliability  and  the  locality 
24:867:65607:14:14:70:453:127:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:size.  But  surprisingly  the  estimated  effect  remains  almost  unchanged,  whereas  its 
24:868:65699:14:14:70:454:113:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:significance  is  slightly  lower.  The  effect  of  local  power sector unreliability on  electricity 
24:869:65802:14:15:70:453:99:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:intensity  is  thus  not  simply  explained  by  the  variability  of  the  population  density 
24:870:65898:15:0:70:150:84:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:(Morikawa, 2012). 
25:871:65917:0:14:88:453:675:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:The size of the estimated effect is substantial. Following the table 5, an improving of 
25:872:66005:14:14:70:453:661:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the  local  power  sector  unreliability  from  the bottom  quartile  (the  higher  reliability  of 
25:873:66105:14:15:70:453:647:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:electricity sector)  to the top quartile (the worst reliability of electricity sector) predicts a 
25:874:66201:15:14:70:454:632:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:19.7  percentage  points  increase  in  the  firm  level  electricity  intensity15.  Overall,  the 
25:875:66299:14:14:70:454:618:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:estimated effect runs from 20.7% (column 2) to 19.5% (column  4). Increasing the local 
25:876:66384:14:14:70:453:604:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:electricity  quality  indicator  from  the  75th to  50th percentile  is  still  associated  with  a  9% 
25:877:66487:14:24:70:263:590:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:reduction of firm-level electricity intensity16.  
25:878:66536:24:15:88:453:566:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:In  table  5,  regression  results  are straightforward.  If  you  are  part  of  EU  the 
25:879:66626:15:14:70:453:551:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:unreliability  of  the  power  sector  pushes  the  enterprise  to  decrease  their  electricity 
25:880:66723:14:14:70:453:537:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:intensity. On the contrary, if an enterprise is not from a new member country the worse 
25:881:66811:14:14:70:453:523:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f9:is  the  quality  greater  is  the  electric  intensity. All  other control  variable’s  coefficients 
25:882:66912:14:15:70:453:509:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:remain similar compared to table 4 except for the share of employees with a degree. In 
25:883:66999:15:14:70:453:494:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the  EU,  and  only  in  the  EU,  this  share  of  educated  people  in  the  firm  reduces  the 
25:884:67097:14:24:70:155:480:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:electricity intensity. 
25:885:67119:24:14:88:453:456:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Nevertheless, our result might be affected by a reverse causality bias if one believes 
25:886:67205:14:15:70:453:442:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:that  in  some  regions  electricity  intensive  firms  are  over-represented,  regardless  of  their 
25:887:67307:15:14:70:453:427:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:industrial sector. Firms in these regions declaring on average a higher electricity obstacle, 
25:888:67401:14:14:70:453:413:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:because  they  are more  affected.  In  order  to  deal  with  this  issue  we compute  an 
25:889:67492:14:14:70:453:399:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:alternative  indicator  of  the  local  electricity  supply  quality.  The  average  number  of 
25:890:67588:14:14:70:453:385:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:electricity interruptions should provide a good proxy of the continuity of power supply 
25:891:67676:14:15:70:453:371:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:at  the  local  level.  Indeed,  this  indicator  is  based  on  an  objective  measure  and  should 
25:892:67777:15:24:70:381:356:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:arguably be independent of firm-specific and unobservable technology.   
25:893:67848:24:14:88:453:332:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:We observe very similar results for all the variables when we use the regional mean 
25:894:67932:14:14:70:454:318:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:outage number as a proxy for the quality of the power sector (table 6).  Except for EU 
25:895:68019:14:15:70:453:304:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:countries  where  the  number  of  outages is  not  significant.  This  is  probably  due  to  the 
25:896:68117:15:14:70:453:289:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:scarcity  of significant outage occurrences. Following  our  results,  the  accuracy  of  one 
25:897:68208:14:14:70:453:275:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:more  outage  in  the  region  is  related  to  1%  increase  of  firm-level  electricity  intensity  in 
25:898:68313:14:14:70:453:261:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:countries not belonging to  the EU. Moreover, this result  suggests that worst  continuity 
25:899:68402:14:15:70:454:247:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:of supply seems to dampen firm-level electricity inefficiency. But this effect is probably 
25:900:68493:15:14:70:454:232:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:related  to  long, or  even  very  long, interruptions.  That  is  why  there  is  no  significant 
25:901:68591:14:14:70:453:218:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:positive,  neither  negative,  impact  in  the  EU  countries.  In  the  EU  area,  the  declared 
25:902:68689:14:41:70:236:204:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:outages should be of lower duration.17

25:904:68782:9:13:70:453:154:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:15 The  estimated  effect  is  given  by:  [exp(0.195*0.922)-1]*100  =  19.7%,  where  0.195  is  the 
25:905:68883:13:12:70:453:141:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:interquartile range  of  the local power sector unreliability indicator and 0.922  is the coefficient of 
25:906:68988:12:8:70:207:129:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:this indicator in table 5, column 3.  
25:907:69025:8:14:70:453:121:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:16 The estimated effect is given with the same computation as previously but an interquartile range 
25:908:69124:14:9:70:292:107:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:of the local power sector unreliability indicator of 0.093.  
25:909:69184:9:14:70:453:98:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:17 In  the  countries belonging  to  the  EU,  power  outages  endure  on  average  less  than  3  hours, 
25:910:69288:14:11:70:452:84:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:whereas in the rest of our sample this number up to more than 5 hours (own calculations, based 
25:911:69383:11:0:70:147:73:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f17:on BEEPS( 2009)). 
26:912:69402:0:14:88:454:675:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:From  our  empirical  study  we  learned  that  poor  institutional  quality  and  poor  local 
26:913:69497:14:14:70:453:661:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:power  sector  quality  increase  the  electricity  intensity.  In  the  next  paragraph  we present 
26:914:69597:14:24:70:178:647:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:some robustness checks. 
26:915:69620:24:25:70:193:623:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:Robustness tests (tables 7 and 8) 
26:916:69652:25:14:70:454:598:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:We present two robustness tests: we first change the subsample division. We divide our 
26:917:69738:14:14:70:453:584:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:sample  in  reformed  and  unreformed  power  sector  countries  (table  7).  In  the  second 
26:918:69832:14:14:70:453:570:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:check  we  change  the specification  of  our  model  and  test  the share  of  electricity  cost  in 
26:919:69934:14:25:70:298:556:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:total variable costs instead of the electricity intensity. 
26:920:69992:25:14:88:453:531:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:For  the  first  robustness  check,  we  assume  that  the  negative  effect  of  the  local 
26:921:70085:14:14:70:453:517:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:electricity  sector  underdevelopment  on  electricity  intensity  is  based  on  the  level  of 
26:922:70182:14:14:70:453:503:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:institutional  reforms  undertaken  in  the  power  sector.  Indeed,  insufficiently  reformed 
26:923:70277:14:15:70:453:489:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:power  sector  is  characterized by  tariff  below  the  cost  recovery,  inadequate  supply  and 
26:924:70375:15:14:70:453:474:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:bad  infrastructures.  Thus,  insufficient  reforms  will  lead  at  the  same  time  to  firms’ 
26:925:70472:14:14:70:453:460:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:electricity over-consumption and a bad quality of the provided service. We expect to find 
26:926:70562:14:14:70:453:446:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:a  negative  impact  of  local  electricity  quality (measured  by  our  subjective  and  objective 
26:927:70661:14:14:70:453:432:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:variables) on  electricity intensity. For this purpose we split  our sample according to  the 
26:928:70754:14:15:70:453:418:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:level  of  undertaken  power  reforms  in  2008  as  indicated  by  the  EBRD  reform  indicator 
26:929:70851:15:24:70:147:403:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:(see section 3.2).  
26:930:70870:24:14:88:453:379:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:The threshold level is 3: insufficiently reformed = [2;3] and “well” reformed = ]3;4]. 
26:931:70957:14:14:70:453:365:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:The  choice  of  this  threshold  is  based  on  two  different  reasons.  We  believe  that  an 
26:932:71054:14:15:70:453:351:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:insufficiently reformed power sector corresponds to an indicator equal or inferior to 318. 
26:933:71144:15:14:70:453:336:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:And, it may be noted that almost all the new EU members are comprised in the “well” 
26:934:71228:14:24:70:215:322:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:reformed group, except Slovenia. 
26:935:71260:24:14:88:454:298:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:When we divide the sample in subsamples, according to the quality of the reforms in 
26:936:71343:14:15:70:453:284:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the electricity sector, we find very interesting and convincing results (table 7). If one is in 
26:937:71439:15:14:70:453:269:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the group of countries without doing reforms in the power sector (columns 1 to 4 in the 
26:938:71527:14:14:70:454:255:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:table  7),  the  local unreliability  of  electric  utilities is  increasing  the  electricity intensity. 
26:939:71632:14:14:70:453:241:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Thus, following column 2, moving from the 25th to the 75th percentile of the local power 
26:940:71716:14:15:70:453:227:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:sector unreliability distribution predicts a 26.3 percentage points increase in the firm level 
26:941:71810:15:14:70:453:212:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:electricity intensity19. The magnitude of the predicted effect  is thus even larger than the 
26:942:71902:14:14:70:454:198:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:one we found  for our main specification  (table 5). The effect  of the local power sector 
26:943:71991:14:14:70:453:184:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:quality is  not  significant  anymore  if  one  is  in  the  group  of  countries  implementing  the 
26:944:72092:14:41:70:453:170:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:power  sector  reforms  (columns 5 to 8).  This  provides  micro-level  evidences that 
26:945:72176:41:8:70:217:129:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:                                                        
26:946:72231:8:14:70:453:121:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:18 The power sector is still a state-owned monopoly, the rules for cost-reflective tariff setting are 
26:947:72332:14:9:70:405:107:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:not formulated or implemented and there is no regulator, at least an independent one. 
26:948:72417:9:14:70:453:98:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:19 The  estimated  effect  is  given  by:  [exp(0.221*1.058)-1]*100  =  26.3%,  where  0.221  is  the 
26:949:72518:14:11:70:453:84:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:interquartile range  of  the local power sector unreliability indicator and 1.058  is the coefficient of 
26:950:72623:11:0:70:207:73:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f17:this indicator in table 7, column 2.  
27:951:72661:0:14:70:454:675:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:insufficiently  reformed  power  sector is  associated  with  a  higher use  of  electricity  by 
27:952:72756:14:24:70:98:661:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:firms. 
27:953:72762:24:14:88:453:637:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:In  our  second  robustness check  we  present  an  alternative specification.  Our 
27:954:72845:14:15:70:454:623:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:dependent variable is changed. Indeed, all other things equal, firms with higher mark-up 
27:955:72933:15:14:70:453:608:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:will display higher electricity intensity, and our indicator of power quality may affect the 
27:956:73026:14:14:70:454:594:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:dependent  variable  only  through  the  denominator. We  use  a  cost  structure  variable  in 
27:957:73121:14:14:70:453:580:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:order to check if, in the previous regressions, the sales’ variations are not driving all our 
27:958:73214:14:15:70:453:566:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f9:results. All the firm’s characteristics remain significant and stable compared to our main 
27:959:73304:15:14:70:453:551:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:specification  (electricity  intensity).  For  non-EU  countries, poor local  electric  power 
27:960:73398:14:14:70:453:537:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:quality, both  in  terms  of  outages  and  perceptions, increases the  electricity  cost  share  in 
27:961:73496:14:24:70:158:523:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:total variable costs.

27:968:73930:14:14:70:454:393:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:insight about the necessity for non-EU countries to push  ahead with deeper reforms in 
27:969:74014:14:14:70:454:379:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the  power  sector. For  this  purpose, and  inspired  by  the  previous  work  of  Guiso  et  al. 
27:970:74111:14:14:70:454:365:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:(2004), we built an innovative measure of the electricity supply quality at the local-level. 
27:971:74203:14:15:70:454:351:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f7:A bad quality of the local power sector seems to dampen the firms’ ability to decreases 
27:972:74291:15:24:70:405:336:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f7:their electricity consumption, if the country’s institutional framework is poor.  
27:973:74371:24:14:88:453:312:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Our  main  findings both  for  subjective  and  objective (outages) measures  of  local 
27:974:74459:14:14:70:454:298:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:electric  power  supply unreliability are  consistent. EU  countries  of  Central  Europe  are 
27:975:74551:14:15:70:453:284:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:able to provide appropriate incentives to the firm’s electricity consumption behaviour. In 
27:976:74640:15:14:70:453:269:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:this sense, our results indicate that bad reliability of the local power supply is negatively 
27:977:74732:14:14:70:453:255:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:related  to  firm-level  electricity  intensity.  At  the  contrary,  in  non-EU  (or  insufficiently 
27:978:74834:14:14:70:454:241:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:reformed)  countries power  sector unreliability  increases firm’s electricity intensity. The 
27:979:74925:14:15:70:454:227:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:size  of  the  estimated  effect  is  substantial. We  estimated about a 20% percent  potential 
27:980:75018:15:14:70:454:212:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f7:reduction of firm’s electricity intensity associated  with  an  improvement  from  the  75th 
27:981:75110:14:14:70:453:198:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:percentile to the 25th percentile of the distribution of the local power sector unreliability 
27:982:75203:14:24:70:112:184:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:variable.  
27:983:75213:24:14:88:453:160:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Countries of the former Soviet bloc needs to reform in order to increase the electric

27:985:75389:15:14:70:453:131:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Given  our  results,  deeper  power  sector  reforming  should  bring  to  FSU  and  SEE 
27:986:75478:14:14:70:454:117:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f9:countries  a  win-win solution, increasing power companies’ financial performances and 
27:987:75565:14:0:70:181:103:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:firm electricity expenses.  
28:988:75594:0:14:88:453:675:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Our results have some policy implication: if transition countries want to improve the 
28:989:75680:14:14:70:453:661:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f7:firm’s energy efficiency, they need to create incentives for new investments and promote 
28:990:75768:14:15:70:454:647:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:high labour productivity activities. Transition countries also need to improve the quality 
28:991:75859:15:14:70:454:632:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:of electricity supply at the local level, especially when the power sector is not reformed. 
28:992:75947:14:14:70:453:618:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:To  make  it  happen,  a  detailed  assessment  of  the  local  supply  continuity  should  be 
28:993:76042:14:24:70:245:604:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:established by an independent regulator. 
28:994:76082:24:14:88:454:580:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:Our  policy  recommendations are  in  line  with  the  World  Bank  reports  of  2012  and 
28:995:76173:14:15:70:453:566:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:2010 and the EBRD report 2011. Broadly speaking, countries of the former Soviet bloc 
28:996:76258:15:14:70:453:551:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:need to prioritize the electricity efficiency measures in their political agendas. The set of 
28:997:76352:14:14:70:453:537:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:basic power sector reforms should be reinforced. In particular, cost-recovery tariffs and 
28:998:76442:14:24:70:331:523:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:strong independent regulatory authority must be established. 
28:999:76502:24:15:88:453:499:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:These broad elements should be combined with more specific reforms. To improve 
28:1000:76581:15:14:70:453:484:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:the  quality  of  electricity  supply,  the  financial  reliability  of  power  companies  should  be 
28:1001:76683:14:14:70:454:470:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:increased  and  generation  capacities should  be offset. Their  business  strategies  should 
28:1002:76775:14:14:70:453:456:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:focus on the demand-side management and favour extensive margins (new connections) 
28:1003:76858:14:15:70:453:442:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:instead  of  intensive  margins  (larger  energy  consumers).  For  this  purpose,  power  sector 
28:1004:76956:15:14:70:453:427:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:bureaucratic  barriers  for  new  connections  must  be  reduced  and  broad-based  voltage 
28:1005:77048:14:14:70:454:413:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:scope   should   be   provided   to   ensure   the   good   functioning   of   electricity-saving 
28:1006:77146:14:14:70:454:399:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:equipments.  Moreover,  an  appropriate  metering  system  is substantial:  to  improve 
28:1007:77234:14:14:70:453:385:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:demand-side  management,  decrease  power  companies  commercial  losses  and  ensure 
28:1008:77320:14:25:70:235:371:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:individual voltage quality verification.  
28:1009:77361:25:14:88:453:346:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:In order to make a smooth, but sustained, transition towards a more efficient use of 
28:1010:77446:14:14:70:454:332:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:electricity, firm-oriented measures should also  be undertaken. Thus, financial access for 
28:1011:77537:14:14:70:453:318:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:electricity-saving  investments  must  be  improved.  And  reliable  information  about  these
