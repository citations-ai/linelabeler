2:23:1118:28:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:Industrial revolution is fundamentally linked with the rise of factories and the decline of skilled artisans
2:24:1226:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:in manufacturing. Most scholars agree that factories as compared to artisan shops were intensive in
2:25:1325:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:unskilled labor. Indeed, the hallmark of the early factories is the utilization of division of labor of relatively
2:26:1439:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:unskilled workers. This paper explores whether the massive influx of unskilled immigrants between
2:27:1536:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:1840 and 1920, by significantly increasing the ratio of unskilled to skilled labor endowment, contributed
2:28:1641:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:to the growth and spread of factory manufacturing in the United States. The data indicate that immigration
2:29:1747:14:28:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:not only contributed to the growth and spread of factories but it also contributed to the growth of cities.

3:37:1981:0:28:72:144:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:I. Introduction 
3:38:1997:28:28:108:516:680:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: The century between 1820 and 1920 defined America as a nation of immigrants or a 
3:39:2078:28:28:72:532:652:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:“melting pot.” During this century, more than 33 million people entered the ports of the United 
3:40:2174:28:28:72:538:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:States. Immigrants from Europe came in massive waves until the era of open immigration ended 
3:41:2267:28:28:72:516:596:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:with the passage of the 1921 Emergency Quota Act (Figure 1).1 By the end of the first three 
3:42:2359:28:28:72:519:568:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:decades of immigration, the census of 1850 finds that almost 10% of Americans was foreign-
3:43:2449:28:28:72:517:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:born. The share of the foreign-born population fluctuated around 13-15% between 1860 and 
3:44:2538:28:27:72:534:512:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:1920, but immigrants and their children represented 30-40% of the white population (Figure 2). 
3:45:2633:27:28:72:539:485:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:With the passage of the Immigration Act of 1965, immigration rose steadily during the last three 
3:46:2730:28:28:72:519:457:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:decades. However, this recent wave of immigration pales in comparison to that of the earlier 
3:47:2823:28:28:72:453:429:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:waves in duration and in terms of the share of aggregate population (Figure 3). 
3:48:2903:28:28:108:518:401:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: What impact did immigration have on the American economy during the era of mass 
3:49:2983:28:28:72:539:373:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:immigration? Goldin (1994) and Hatton and Williamson (1998) find that immigrants and natives 
3:50:3076:28:28:72:537:345:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:were substitutes; immigration lowered native wages and displaced natives from the northeastern 
3:51:3171:28:28:72:522:317:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:United States where immigrants largely settled.2 Studies on immigrant assimilation generally 
3:52:3264:28:28:72:524:289:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:find that immigrants earned lower wages on arrival but provide different assessments on their 
3:53:3358:28:28:72:534:261:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:rates of assimilation. While Hannon (1982), Eichengreen and Gemery (1986) and Hanes (1996) 
3:54:3449:28:28:72:521:233:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:find that wage growth among immigrants was slower than native-born workers, Blau (1980), 
3:55:3538:28:28:72:515:205:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:Hatton (1997), and Minns (2000) find that immigrants experienced faster wage growth than 
3:56:3627:28:12:216:219:177:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:                                                 
3:57:3675:12:12:72:530:165:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:1 The movement to restrict immigration in the U.S. started in the late nineteenth century. Between 1897 and 1917, 
3:58:3789:12:11:71:530:153:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:the House and the Senate passed numerous bills on literacy tests which finally became law in 1917. When literacy 
3:59:3902:11:12:71:521:142:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:tests proved to be ineffective in curbing immigration, the Congress moved toward a quota system. See Hingham 
3:60:4011:12:11:71:181:130:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:(1955) and Goldin (1994).  
3:61:4038:11:12:71:525:119:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:2 Friedberg and Hunt (1995) provide an excellent summary of the literature, especially of works on the impact of 
3:62:4151:12:12:71:526:107:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:immigration on the second half of the twentieth century. Most studies on recent immigration find that immigrants 
3:63:4264:12:11:71:520:95:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:and natives are substitutes. Some studies such as Borjas (1999) and Borjas, Freeman and Katz (1997) find large 
3:64:4375:11:0:71:520:84:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:negative impact whereas Card (2001) finds small impact. On the other hand, Ottaviano and Peri (2005a, 2000b) 
4:65:4485:0:28:72:500:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:native-born and caught up to native-born level of earnings within 20 or 25 years. For the 
4:66:4575:28:28:72:535:680:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:antebellum period, Ferrie (1999) finds that immigrants were geographically, occupationally and 
4:67:4670:28:28:72:539:652:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:financially mobile.3 However, from an aggregate perspective, because American real wages rose 
4:68:4764:28:28:72:525:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:steadily between 1820 and 1920, many scholars such as Goldin (1994) point to the absorptive 
4:69:4856:28:28:72:301:596:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:capacity of the American economy (Figure 4).4 
4:70:4901:28:28:108:512:568:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: In this paper, I explore whether immigration had a more fundamental impact on the 
4:71:4983:28:28:72:521:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:American economy between 1860 and 1920. In particular, I investigate whether immigration 
4:72:5072:28:27:72:528:512:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:during this period had a significant impact on the growth and spread of factory organization in 
4:73:5168:27:28:72:512:485:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:manufacturing. Between 1820 and 1840, when factory production was still in its infancy in 
4:74:5258:28:28:72:512:457:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:America, immigration may have hindered the spread of factories as many skilled European 
4:75:5346:28:28:72:527:429:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:artisans sought refuge from the spread of European factory production by moving to America. 
4:76:5438:28:28:72:521:401:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:Immigration after 1840, however, is likely to have contributed to the growth of factories as it 
4:77:5534:28:28:71:521:373:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:significantly increased the unskilled to skilled labor endowment in America. Because factory 
4:78:5627:28:28:71:515:345:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:production utilized unskilled workers intensely, the dramatic increase in unskilled to skilled 
4:79:5722:28:46:71:500:317:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:labor endowment ratio is likely to have had a significant impact on the growth of factory 
4:80:5812:46:12:539:542:271:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:                                                                                                                                                             
4:81:5968:12:12:72:518:259:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:argue that immigrants and natives are complements and that immigrants had a positive impact on native wages. 
4:82:6077:12:11:71:537:247:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:3 Ferrie (1999) provides a richly detailed study of the immigrant experience by constructing a sample of immigrants 
4:83:6193:11:12:71:533:236:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:from passenger ship lists who entered through New York city in the 1840s and located in the census of populations 
4:84:6307:12:11:71:488:224:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:in 1850 and 1860. By 1850, most immigrants reached their intended destinations (New York, Ohio, and 
4:85:6407:11:12:71:496:213:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:Pennsylvania) and only 17% remained in the vicinity of New York city. Relative to the native population, 
4:86:6512:12:11:71:541:201:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:immigrants were initially disproportionately represented as skilled artisans and unskilled laborers. About a quarter of 
4:87:6632:11:12:71:530:190:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:immigrants moved downwards in occupational status, but the dominant tendency was to move upwards. The Irish, 
4:88:6741:12:12:71:461:178:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:compared to the British and Germans, were least mobile both geographically and occupationally. 
4:89:6836:12:11:71:526:166:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:4 Data on real wages were constructed from various sources such as Coombes (1926), Aldrich and Week’s series 
4:90:6945:11:12:71:525:155:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:from Long (1960), Rees (1961), Lebergott (1964), and Margo (2000). The nominal values were converted to real 
4:91:7054:12:11:71:516:143:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:wages using the BLS CPI from the Historical Statistics of the United States (1975). Aldrich, Weeks, Rees, and 
4:92:7164:11:12:71:532:132:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:Lebergott series are the average earnings in all manufacturing, Coombes series is the average earnings of unskilled 
4:93:7280:12:12:71:535:120:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:workers in manufacturing, and Margo series is the average earnings of common laborers in the Northeast. The ratio 
4:94:7394:12:11:71:541:108:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:of skilled to unskilled wages seems to have fluctuated without any visible trend between 1820 and 1860 based on the 
4:95:7510:11:12:71:508:97:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:ratio of wages of artisans and common laborers in the Northeast (Margo (2000)) but seems to have narrowed 
4:96:7616:12:11:71:518:85:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:between 1890 and 1940 (Goldin and Katz (1999), Goldin and Margo (1992)). Also see Williamson and Lindert 
4:97:7721:11:0:71:103:74:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:(1980).

5:99:7763:28:28:108:542:680:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: The industrial revolution, which began in England and spread to elsewhere in Europe and 
5:100:7851:28:28:72:532:652:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:to the United States, is fundamentally linked with the rise of factories and the decline of skilled 
5:101:7951:28:28:72:540:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:artisans in manufacturing (Mokyr (2002)). While there are many theories on the rise of factories, 
5:102:8049:28:28:72:510:596:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:this paper emphasizes the importance of the unskilled intensity of factory production.6 It is 
5:103:8143:28:28:71:530:568:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:widely believed that factories substituted skilled artisans with the division of labor of unskilled 
5:104:8243:28:28:71:523:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:workers who specialized in a limited number of tasks (Sokoloff (1984), Atack (1987), Goldin 
5:105:8335:28:27:71:496:512:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:and Katz (1998), Atack, Bateman and Margo (2005)).7 In the United States, in the early 
5:106:8422:27:28:71:528:485:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:industrial period (1820-1840), factories in New England utilized the unskilled labor of women 
5:107:8516:28:28:71:529:457:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:and children (Goldin and Sokoloff (1982)); however, in the second industrial revolution (1860-
5:108:8610:28:31:71:510:429:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:1920), unskilled immigrant laborers were the dominant factory manufacturing labor force.  
5:109:8700:31:12:216:219:398:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:                                                 
5:110:8748:12:11:72:510:386:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:5 Beginning with Habakkuk (1962), there is an extensive literature on skilled-biased technology in American 
5:111:8856:11:12:72:519:375:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:history. For Habakkuk, labor scarcity rather than immigration of unskilled workers caused the early adoption of 
5:112:8968:12:11:72:531:363:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:mechanized factory production in America as compared to Britain. For Rosenberg (1972), the American system of 
5:113:9078:11:12:71:525:352:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:manufacturing was biased toward resource intensive technologies due to its abundant resources. Goldin and Katz 
5:114:9189:12:11:71:538:340:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:(1998) interpret the works of James and Skinner (1985) and Cain and Patterson (1986) as providing evidence for the 
5:115:9304:11:12:71:516:329:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:existence of technology-unskilled complementarity in the nineteenth century U.S. manufacturing. These works 
5:116:9412:12:12:71:513:317:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:indicate that physical capital, raw material and unskilled labor were complements and that they substituted for 
5:117:9524:12:11:71:523:305:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:skilled artisans. To the contrary, Williamson and Lindert (1990) argue that physical capital was a complement to 
5:118:9637:11:12:72:525:294:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:skilled rather than to unskilled labor during this period (also see Temin (1966) and David (1975)). In this paper, I 
5:119:9754:12:11:72:502:282:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:highlight the role of the relative supplies of skilled and unskilled workers as in Goldin and Katz (1998) and 
5:120:9864:11:12:71:533:271:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:Acemoglu (1998). The empirical estimation in this paper is motivated by Acemoglu’s model which predicts that an 
5:121:9976:12:12:71:533:259:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:increase in the supply of unskilled (skilled) workers increases the technologies used by unskilled (skilled) workers. 
5:122:10094:12:11:71:521:247:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:Thomas (1954) and Erickson (1957) believed that immigration contributed to the growth of factories in the U.S. 
5:123:10205:11:12:71:533:236:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:Acemoglu (1998) suggests that the increase in the supply of unskilled workers from villages and Ireland to English 
5:124:10320:12:11:71:517:224:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:cities, as documented by Williamson (1990), may have played a role in the rise of factories in England as well. 
5:125:10432:11:12:71:525:213:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:Finally, Lewis (2003, 2006) finds that immigration had an impact on the direction of American technology in the 
5:126:10544:12:11:71:219:201:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:second half of the twentieth century. 
5:127:10582:11:12:71:526:190:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:6 Mokyr (1999, 2002) provides an excellent summary of the literature on the British industrial revolution. Mokyr 
5:128:10695:12:12:71:529:178:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:(2002) examines three main classes of explanations for the rise of factories: fixed costs and physical economies of 
5:129:10811:12:11:71:541:166:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:scale, information costs and incentives and labor effort. However, he argues that the most compelling explanation for 
5:130:10929:11:12:71:523:155:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:the rise of factories is based on ideas developed by Demsetz (1988) and Becker and Murphy (1992), namely that 
5:131:11039:12:11:71:502:143:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:“division of labor is limited by the size of the knowledge set necessary to execute and operate best-practice 
5:132:11149:11:12:71:507:132:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:techniques.” While workers possessed different skill endowments, factories served as repository of technical 
5:133:11258:12:12:71:420:120:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:knowledge and reduced the costs of transmitting this knowledge to individual workers. 
5:134:11344:12:11:71:540:108:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:7 According to Atack, Bateman and Margo (2004), the factory system through division of labor shortened the period 
5:135:11458:11:12:71:540:97:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:of skill acquisition and contributed to the de-skilling of workers. Thus, the factory system was well adapted to utilize 
5:136:11579:12:11:71:542:85:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:the abundance of unskilled immigrant workers. Consistent with the de-skilling hypothesis or the intense utilization of 
5:137:11698:11:0:71:518:74:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:unskilled workers, Atack, Bateman and Margo find that average wages of firms fell with increases in firm size. 
6:138:11810:0:28:108:535:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: The pace and the skill composition of immigrants differed greatly between the early and 
6:139:11898:28:28:72:542:680:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:late industrial period in the United States (Tables 1 and 2). In the early period of industrialization 
6:140:12001:28:28:72:531:652:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:between 1820 and 1840, the pace of immigration was modest and most of the immigrants were 
6:141:12091:28:28:72:519:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:skilled artisans and were relatively wealthy. In the transition period between the early to late 
6:142:12188:28:28:72:526:596:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:industrialization, the rate of immigration rose dramatically and a great majority of immigrants 
6:143:12284:28:28:72:533:568:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:were unskilled farmers, laborers and servants. Although the pace of immigration fluctuated and 
6:144:12379:28:28:72:529:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:the sources of immigrants shifted from northwestern to central and southeastern Europe by the 
6:145:12473:28:27:72:504:512:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:second industrial revolution, a majority of immigrants remained unskilled workers. Thus, 
6:146:12562:27:28:72:503:485:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:immigration between 1846 and 1920 significantly increased the unskilled to skilled labor 
6:147:12651:28:28:72:256:457:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:endowment ratio in the United States. 
6:148:12689:28:28:108:514:429:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: One major issue is whether factory jobs “pulled” immigrants to the United States or 
6:149:12773:28:28:72:540:401:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:whether immigrants endogenously changed the direction of American technology toward factory 
6:150:12865:28:28:72:524:373:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:organization of production. My principal identification strategy rests on the exogeneity or the 
6:151:12961:28:28:72:541:345:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:“push” factor of immigration between 1847-1854, a period which marked the first major wave of 
6:152:13055:28:28:72:540:317:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:mass immigration. Many scholars agree that the most important cause of immigration during this 
6:153:13150:28:28:72:539:289:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:period was the potato famine in Ireland and in other European countries (Ó Gráda and O’Rourke 
6:154:13244:28:28:72:539:261:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:(1997), Cohn (2000), Hatton and Williamson (2005)). The potato famine, caused by p. infestans, 
6:155:13339:28:28:72:511:233:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:a fungus-like disease that turns the potato into inedible black mush, reduced the acreage of 
6:156:13432:28:28:72:527:205:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:potato in Ireland from 2.1 million acres in 1845 to a mere 0.3 million in 1847 causing massive 
6:157:13527:28:28:72:348:177:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:deaths and emigration (Ó Gráda (1999), Mokyr (1985)).  
6:158:13582:28:28:108:531:149:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: The instruments used in this paper are the share of foreign-born population in 1850 and 
6:159:13670:28:35:72:519:121:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:the growth in the foreign-born population between 1850 and 1860.8 Because a large share of 
6:160:13761:35:12:216:219:86:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:                                                 
6:161:13809:12:0:72:536:74:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:8 The growth in the foreign-born population between 1850 and 1860 is likely to capture the large inflow of German 
7:162:13924:0:28:72:510:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:immigration prior to the antebellum period occurred during the famine period, the share of 
7:163:14015:28:28:72:505:680:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:foreign-born population in 1850 should be highly correlated with the share of immigrants 
7:164:14104:28:28:72:537:652:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:induced by the potato famine. The total numbers of immigrants between 1846 and 1850 equaled 
7:165:14196:28:28:72:531:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:that of the entire period between 1820 and 1845; in addition, the Irish foreign-born represented 
7:166:14293:28:28:72:536:596:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:almost 43% of all foreign-born population in 1850 (Gibson and Lennon (1999)).9 The growth in 
7:167:14386:28:28:72:527:568:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:the foreign-born population between 1850 and 1860 should also be correlated with the famine-
7:168:14478:28:28:72:531:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:induced immigration as the number of immigrants between 1851 and 1854 were one and a half 
7:169:14568:28:27:72:342:512:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:times greater than the number between 1855 and 1860.  
7:170:14622:27:28:108:524:485:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: Data on the occupation of immigrants during the mid-nineteenth century provide little 
7:171:14708:28:28:72:533:457:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:evidence for the proposition that these first wave of immigrants was “pulled” by factory jobs in 
7:172:14805:28:28:72:530:429:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:the United States. Cohn (1992), based on data from passenger lists from ships which arrived in 
7:173:14900:28:28:72:530:401:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:New York between 1836-1853, finds that a majority of English immigrants were unskilled and 
7:174:14991:28:28:72:537:373:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:less than 5% of them possessed prior industrial experience.10 Relative to the English population, 
7:175:15089:28:28:72:525:345:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:immigrants were over-represented as farmers and laborers but under-represented in almost all 
7:176:15182:28:28:72:519:317:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:other occupational categories (Table 3). For a sample of immigrants who came in the 1840s, 
7:177:15273:28:28:72:541:289:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:Ferrie (1999) finds that a majority of the Irish came as unskilled laborers, the British as unskilled 
7:178:15375:28:12:539:542:261:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:                                                                                                                                                             
7:179:15531:12:12:72:536:249:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:immigration between 1852 and 1854 sparked by the political repression following the unsuccessful 1848 revolution 
7:180:15644:12:11:72:542:237:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:(Atack and Passell (1994)). In addition, as compared to studies such as Altonji and Card (1991) and others which use 
7:181:15761:11:12:72:530:226:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:historic shares of foreign-born as instruments, the historic level of share of foreign-born in 1850 and the growth of 
7:182:15879:12:11:72:425:214:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:foreign-born population between 1850 and 1860 are much more likely to be exogenous. 
7:183:15963:11:12:72:529:203:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:9 It is important to note that immigration data between 1820 and 1860 were incomplete and subject to both under- 
7:184:16076:12:12:72:531:191:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:and over-enumeration. No data were collected for immigrants arriving from Canada, Mexico and Pacific ports and 
7:185:16187:12:11:72:535:179:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:the data included transients bound for territories outside of the U.S. and double counted merchants and visitors who 
7:186:16304:11:12:72:499:168:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:made more than one return voyage from Europe. Of these factors, the most important factor was the under-
7:187:16408:12:11:72:527:156:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:enumeration of immigration flow through Canada. Between 1810-1839, a large share of immigrants to the United 
7:188:16517:11:12:72:510:145:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:States arrived at St. Lawrence ports (see McClelland and Zeckhauser (1982)). Before 1865, about half of UK 
7:189:16624:12:12:72:530:133:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:immigrants, especially the poor, may have come through Canada because the fare to Canadian maritime ports was 
7:190:16734:12:11:72:295:121:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:less than half of that to American ports (Ferrie (1999)). 
7:191:16792:11:12:72:540:110:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:10 There is considerable anecdotal evidence that most skilled immigrants were artisans rather than factory managers, 
7:192:16909:12:11:72:523:98:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:mechanics or operatives. As the rise of factory production in Europe displaced artisans in Europe, they moved to 
7:193:17022:11:12:72:537:87:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:America. Thus, the arrival of skilled artisans may have delayed the onset of industrial revolution in American cities. 
7:194:17141:12:0:72:510:75:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:However, as factory production gained momentum in the United States, there is evidence that skilled artisans 
8:195:17251:0:28:72:426:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:laborers and skilled artisans and Germans as farmers and skilled artisans. 
8:196:17326:28:28:108:528:680:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: While the long-run ebb and flow of immigration was due to the combination of “push” 
8:197:17410:28:28:72:523:652:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:and “pull” factors, one additional exogenous factor which significantly increased the share of 
8:198:17505:28:28:72:534:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:unskilled immigrants is related to major advances in transportation.11 First, advances in internal 
8:199:17604:28:28:72:486:596:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:transportation due to railroads provided easy access to major ports for most European 
8:200:17690:28:28:72:518:568:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:populations (Hatton and Williamson (2005)). Second, the advances in steamship technology 
8:201:17779:28:28:72:541:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:made the trans-Atlantic travel shorter, safer, and easier to get in and out of secondary ports in the 
8:202:17881:28:27:72:529:512:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:Mediterranean (Cohn (2005), Keeling (1999)). Third, the passenger costs relative to per capita 
8:203:17976:27:28:72:404:485:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:income fell significantly between 1820 and 1860 (Galenson (1984)). 
8:204:18043:28:28:108:510:457:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: My second identification strategy utilizes the fact that most immigrants entered the 
8:205:18128:28:28:72:508:429:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:United States through New York and used domestic transportation networks to reach their 
8:206:18216:28:28:72:535:401:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:intended destinations. Between 1850 and 1914, 70% of immigrants arrived via the ports in New 
8:207:18309:28:28:72:512:373:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:York (Keeling (1999)); and many immigrants moved immediately from the port of entry to 
8:208:18396:28:28:72:492:345:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:internal destinations (Ferrie (1999)). Distance from New York city and access to water 
8:209:18483:28:28:72:523:317:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:transportation in 1850 are likely to capture the influence of transportation costs on immigrant 
8:210:18579:28:28:72:530:289:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:settlement patterns. It is important to note that New York city became the dominant mercantile

8:212:18771:28:28:72:536:233:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:(1939)). However, distance from New York city and access to water transportation in 1850 may 
8:213:18864:28:28:72:363:205:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:also be correlated with access to markets for manufacturers. 
8:214:18925:28:28:108:515:177:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: To determine whether immigrants contributed to the growth and spread of unskilled-
8:215:19007:28:28:72:531:149:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:biased technology embodied in factory-assembly production, I use data of manufacturing firms 
8:216:19100:28:28:72:536:121:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:drawn from the manuscripts of the decennial censuses between 1850 and 1880 which have been 
8:217:19191:28:12:539:542:93:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:                                                                                                                                                             
8:218:19347:12:0:72:533:81:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:became managers and foreman of factories suggesting complementarities between immigrant artisans and laborers. 
9:219:19459:0:28:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:merged with county-level information from the censuses of populations from the same respective 
9:220:19554:28:28:72:501:680:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:years.12 Data analysis suggests that immigration between 1850 and 1920 may have had a 
9:221:19640:28:28:72:510:652:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:fundamental impact on the direction of American technology. The data reveal that firms in 
9:222:19730:28:28:72:535:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:counties with a higher share of foreign-born were much more likely to be organized as factories 
9:223:19826:28:28:72:521:596:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:and were generally larger. In addition, firms in these counties were also more productive and 
9:224:19920:28:28:72:511:568:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:were likely to pay higher average wages to their workers. Standard tests of the instruments 
9:225:20012:28:28:72:508:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:indicate their general validity and that the 2SLS estimates are generally similar to those of 
9:226:20106:28:27:72:219:512:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:ordinary regression estimates. 
9:227:20137:27:28:108:532:485:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: The paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the model, empirical strategy and

9:229:20315:28:28:72:538:429:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:factories. Section III examines the immigrant diversity of occupations by nationality. Section IV 
9:230:20413:28:28:72:362:401:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:studies immigration and urbanization. Section V concludes.

9:233:20502:28:28:108:481:317:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: Industrial development in the United States exhibited three major production 
9:234:20579:28:28:72:536:289:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:technologies: artisan shops (1790-1820), factory-assembly (1820-1920), and factory-continuous 
9:235:20673:28:28:72:531:261:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:(1920- ). Prior to the industrial revolution, skilled artisans produced the entire product with the 
9:236:20773:28:28:72:542:233:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:help of apprentices and family members. With the industrial revolution, factories hired numerous 
9:237:20870:28:28:72:505:205:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:unskilled workers who specialized in few tasks based on division of labor and few skilled 
9:238:20960:28:28:72:502:177:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:workers who operated machines and supervised workers. In the first half of the twentieth 
9:239:21049:28:28:72:533:149:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:century, however, the factory-continuous method began to replace the factory-assembly system 
9:240:21142:28:12:539:542:121:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:

9:242:21353:12:11:72:528:97:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:12 The firm-level manuscript data were constructed by Jeremy Atack, Fred Bateman and Thomas Weiss; Michael 
9:243:21460:11:12:71:530:86:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:Haines generously provided the merged data set. For discussions on sampling criteria and other pertinent concerns 
9:244:21574:12:0:71:525:74:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:related to the firm-level data, see Atack and Bateman (1999), Atack, Bateman and Margo (2004, 2005), and Kim 
10:245:21685:0:28:72:534:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:in a number of industries (Goldin and Katz (1998), Jerome (1924)). Unlike the earlier factories, 
10:246:21782:28:28:72:535:680:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:the  new factory-continuous system was intensive in skilled rather than unskilled workers. With 
10:247:21878:28:28:72:537:652:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:the advent of electric motors, mechanization replaced the division of labor of unskilled workers. 
10:248:21976:28:28:108:535:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: Whereas Goldin and Katz (1998) examine the shift in production from factory-assembly 
10:249:22061:28:28:72:523:596:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:to the factory-continuous methods, I examine the shift from artisan shop to the earlier factory 
10:250:22157:28:28:72:500:568:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:system based on unskilled division of labor.13 The empirics of this paper is motivated by 
10:251:22247:28:28:72:528:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:Acemoglu’s (1998) model of endogenous technological change. The model assumes that there 
10:252:22336:28:27:72:513:512:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:are two types of workers, skilled (H) and unskilled (L), who supply labor inelastically. The 
10:253:22429:27:28:72:529:485:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:consumption good is produced from two complementary production process, one using skilled 
10:254:22519:28:28:72:513:457:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:and the other using unskilled. Firm level technology, Ah or Al, is determined by technology 
10:255:22611:28:28:72:493:429:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:employed by the firm where skilled and unskilled workers are assumed to use different 
10:256:22697:28:28:72:527:401:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:technologies. The main result of Acemoglu’s model is summarized by the following equation: 
10:257:22788:28:28:72:529:373:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:Ah/Al = f(p, H/L) where p=ph/pl. In this model, an increase in the relative supply of a skill type 
10:258:22887:28:28:72:514:345:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:will lead to an improvement in the technologies that uses that particular skill type. Thus, an 
10:259:22982:28:28:72:530:317:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:exogenous increase in the supply of skilled (unskilled) workers will lead to an improvement in 
10:260:23077:28:28:72:344:289:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:technologies which utilize skilled (unskilled) workers.14 
10:261:23134:28:28:107:538:261:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: In this paper, I assume that the adoption of the factory method of production signifies the 
10:262:23226:28:28:71:525:233:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:increase in the use of unskilled intensive technology and also assume that the share of foreign-
10:263:23322:28:28:71:533:205:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:born population (FB/(FB+NB)) is a useful measure of the relative supply of unskilled to skilled 
10:264:23418:28:12:539:542:177:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:                                                                                                                                                             
10:265:23574:12:12:72:104:165:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:(2005). 
10:266:23582:12:11:72:532:153:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:13 Goldin and Katz (1998) suggests that the growth in the supply of skilled labor due to the sudden growth in high 
10:267:23697:11:12:72:541:142:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:school educated workers may have fueled skilled-biased technology toward the factory-continuous batch production. 
10:268:23811:12:11:72:531:130:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:In addition, the supply of unskilled workers fell dramatically during this period as immigration slowed to a trickle. 
10:269:23929:11:12:72:526:119:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:14 The intuition of the model is as follows: when there are more unskilled workers, then the market for unskilled-
10:270:24043:12:12:72:540:107:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:complementary technologies, such as factories, is larger. As a result, more resources will be devoted to the invention 
10:271:24162:12:11:72:511:95:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:of unskilled-complementary technologies. In this model, Acemoglu (1998) shows that the impact on wages is 
10:272:24268:11:0:72:523:84:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:dynamic. Initially, the shift in supply of unskilled workers will lower unskilled wages; however, as the “directed 
11:273:24385:0:28:72:511:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:workers (L/H). The share of foreign-born population is subject to two important sources of 
11:274:24476:28:28:72:523:680:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:measurement errors: (1) not all foreign-born workers are unskilled and (2) not all native-born 
11:275:24571:28:28:72:526:652:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:workers are skilled. However, these measurement errors, to the extent that they are important, 
11:276:24666:28:28:72:306:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:are both likely to bias the estimates downwards. 
11:277:24715:28:28:108:541:596:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: To investigate whether immigration influenced the adoption of factory production in U.S. 
11:278:24804:28:28:72:318:568:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:manufacturing, I estimate the following equations: 
11:279:24855:28:27:72:339:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:(1) Factoryijc = α0 + α1 Fgn-Bornc + α2 Fijc + dj +ds + uijc 
11:280:24915:27:28:72:362:513:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:(2) ln[Firmsize]ijc = α0 + α1 Fgn-Bornc + α2 Fijc + dj +ds + uijc 
11:281:24980:28:28:72:535:485:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:where Factoryijc is equal to 1 if firm size is greater than 15 workers and 0 otherwise, firm size is 
11:282:25081:28:28:72:532:457:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:defined as one plus the number of male, female and child employees, and i, j, c, s indexes firm, 
11:283:25178:28:28:72:536:429:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:industry, county and state, respectively. The independent variables are the share of foreign-born 
11:284:25276:28:28:72:541:401:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:population in county c, firm-level (Fijc) characteristics such as the capital-labor ratio, the share of 
11:285:25380:28:28:72:519:373:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:male workers and whether a firm used steam-power or water-power rather than hand-power. 
11:286:25468:28:28:72:542:345:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:Goldin and Katz (1998) believe that the shift from artisan to factory system probably involved an 
11:287:25566:28:28:72:533:317:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:increase in capital-labor intensity. Since firms in some industries may be more likely organized 
11:288:25663:28:28:72:531:289:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:as factories because of industry-specific differences in fixed cost or because they are located in 
11:289:25762:28:28:72:535:261:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:certain regions with access to specialized raw materials, the regressions include 3-digit industry 
11:290:25861:28:28:72:223:233:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:(dj) and state fixed-effects (ds). 
11:291:25896:28:28:108:539:205:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: In addition, I estimate whether firms in counties with higher levels of immigrant workers 
11:292:25986:28:28:72:440:177:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:were more productive and paid higher wages using the following equations: 
11:293:26060:28:28:72:347:149:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:(3) ln[Wage]ijc = α0 + α1 Fgn-Bornc + α2 Fijc + dj +ds + uijc 
11:294:26121:28:35:72:334:121:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:(4) ln[LP]ijc = α0 + α1 Fgn-Bornc + α2 Fijc + dj +ds + uijc 
11:295:26180:35:12:539:542:86:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:                                                                                                                                                             
11:296:26336:12:0:72:530:74:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:technology effect” shifts the relative demand of unskilled workers, wages of unskilled workers will rise over time. 
12:297:26454:0:28:72:512:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:where wage and labor productivity (LP) are average wages and output per worker of firms, 
12:298:26543:28:28:72:529:680:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:respectively. To the extent that immigration leads to the adoption of superior factory-assembly 
12:299:26639:28:28:72:527:652:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:production technologies based on division of labor, workers in immigration abundant counties 
12:300:26732:28:28:71:316:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:should be more productive and earn higher wages. 
12:301:26781:28:28:107:527:596:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: To estimate equations (1)-(4), I use a data set which merges the Atack-Bateman-Weiss 
12:302:26866:28:28:71:541:568:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:(ABW) sample of manufacturing firms drawn from the manuscripts of the decennial censuses for 
12:303:26959:28:28:71:531:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:1850, 1860, 1870 and 1880 with the respective U.S. decadal censuses of population. The ABW 
12:304:27050:28:27:71:494:512:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:data set contains information on manufacturing firms such as output, capital, labor, raw 
12:305:27139:27:28:71:533:485:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:materials, wages, and primary power source and are categorized by the standard industrial code 
12:306:27234:28:28:71:519:457:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:at the 3-digit industry level. The county-level census data contain a rich array of information

12:308:27411:28:28:72:537:401:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:characteristics. The samples were restricted to firms with positive values of output, employment 
12:309:27508:28:28:72:525:373:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:and capital. To eliminate potential outliers in the data, I also excluded firms with gross output 
12:310:27606:28:28:72:506:345:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:less than $500 and those with extremely low and high wages (Atack, Bateman and Margo

12:312:27712:28:28:108:492:289:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: Table 4 presents data on county population characteristics from the censuses of 
12:313:27792:28:28:72:499:261:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:population. The number of counties in the U.S. grew from 1623 to 2613 and the average 
12:314:27878:28:28:72:536:233:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:population of these counties also rose steadily from 14,290 to 19,208. The foreign-born share of 
12:315:27975:28:28:72:534:205:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:the population rose from 5.9% to 11.5% between 1850 and 1870 and then fell slightly to 10.7% 
12:316:28068:28:28:72:517:177:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:in 1880. The average urban share of the county population rose from 3.8% to 8.1% between 
12:317:28157:28:28:72:520:149:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:1850 and 1880. From a regional perspective, the share of foreign-born was the highest in the 
12:318:28250:28:28:72:528:121:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:Pacific and Mountain counties followed by Middle Atlantic, East North Central, New England 
12:319:28341:28:0:72:510:93:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:and West North Central counties and was the lowest in the southern counties. The share of 
13:320:28433:0:28:72:518:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:natives who were born out of state was lowest in counties in New England, Middle Atlantic, 
13:321:28524:28:28:71:523:680:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:South Atlantic and West South Central and rose markedly in counties in the Western regions. 
13:322:28616:28:28:107:531:652:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: Table 5 shows that factory organization of production and the size of firms in the ABW 
13:323:28703:28:28:71:506:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:sample rose from 10% to 16% and 4.76 to 5.75 between 1850 and 1880, respectively. The 
13:324:28789:28:28:71:540:596:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:average nominal wages, labor productivity and capital intensity rose between 1850 and 1870 and 
13:325:28884:28:28:71:533:568:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:then fell slightly in 1880. Firms that used steam-power increased whereas those that used water-
13:326:28980:28:28:71:519:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:power decreased over time. The share of male intensity in manufacturing remained constant. 
13:327:29071:28:27:71:524:512:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:Finally, the average percentage of foreign-born of the matched data rose slightly from 13% to 
13:328:29165:27:28:71:148:485:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:16% over time. 
13:329:29180:28:28:107:502:457:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: As discussed in the introduction, equations (1)-(4) are estimated using two sets of 
13:330:29264:28:28:71:504:429:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:instruments: (1) share of foreign born in 1850 and the change in the share of foreign-born 
13:331:29355:28:28:71:532:401:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:between 1850 and 1860, and (2) distance from New York city and whether a county had access 
13:332:29446:28:28:71:530:373:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:to water transportation in 1850. In addition, for 1870 and 1880, years for which county data on 
13:333:29542:28:28:71:514:345:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:the share of foreign-born by countries are provided, I estimate whether the shares of certain 
13:334:29636:28:28:71:510:317:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:ethnic groups such as the Irish or whether immigrant diversity contributed to the growth of 
13:335:29728:28:28:71:251:289:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:factory production in manufacturing. 
13:336:29765:28:28:107:509:261:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: The first-stage regressions are presented in Table 6. As expected, the percentage of 
13:337:29850:28:28:71:529:233:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:foreign-born in 1850 was highly correlated with the percentages of foreign-born in 1860, 1870 
13:338:29944:28:28:71:506:205:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:and 1880, respectively. A little more surprising is the fact that the change in the growth of 
13:339:30038:28:28:71:539:177:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:foreign-born in 1850 to 1860 are positively correlated with the shares of foreign-born in the later 
13:340:30138:28:28:71:527:149:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:decades. Also as expected, the share of foreign-born populations in 1860, 1870 and 1880 were 
13:341:30231:28:28:71:522:121:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:all negatively correlated with the distance from New York city but were positively correlated 
13:342:30325:28:0:71:532:93:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:with whether a county possessed access to water transportation in 1850. Finally, the two sets of 
14:343:30424:0:28:72:528:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:instruments are strong candidates according to Staiger and Watson’s (1997) rule of thumb: the 
14:344:30518:28:28:72:538:680:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:first stage F-statistics, testing the hypothesis that coefficients on the instruments are jointly zero, 
14:345:30622:28:28:72:231:652:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:are significantly higher than 10.  
14:346:30657:28:28:108:512:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: Table 7 reports the probit and ordinary least squares estimates of equations (1)-(4).  
14:347:30744:28:28:72:541:596:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:The probit regression reported in Table 7 shows that counties with a higher share of foreign-born 
14:348:30842:28:28:72:524:568:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:were significantly more likely to have firms organized as factories.15 Based on stata’s dprobit 
14:349:30938:28:28:72:513:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:command which calculates marginal changes in probability for infinitesimal changes in the 
14:350:31028:28:27:72:533:512:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:independent variable (discrete change for dummy variables), the estimated marginal impacts of 
14:351:31122:27:28:72:490:485:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:foreign-born on the factory variable were 0.15, 0.32 and 0.30 for 1860, 1870 and 1880 
14:352:31208:28:28:72:502:457:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:respectively. The marginal impact on factory organization was relatively strong for male-
14:353:31297:28:28:72:513:429:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:intensity (0.16-0.26) and steam-power dummy (0.11-0.26), moderately important for water-
14:354:31385:28:28:72:500:401:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:power dummy (0.01-0.08) but surprisingly weak for capital-labor intensity (0.004-0.01). 
14:355:31473:28:28:108:518:373:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: Regression estimates on firm size indicate similar patterns. In this case, one standard 
14:356:31561:28:28:72:528:345:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:deviation increase in the county foreign-born population increased firm size by 11%, 17% and 
14:357:31654:28:28:71:522:317:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:14% in 1860, 1870 and 1880, respectively. Firm size is also positively correlated with capital 
14:358:31749:28:28:71:533:289:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:intensity, male intensity, steam and water powered firms.16 The regressions on wages and labor 
14:359:31844:28:28:72:503:261:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:productivities show that firms in counties with a higher share of foreign-born paid higher 
14:360:31935:28:28:72:522:233:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:average wages and were characterized by higher labor productivity.17 One standard deviation 
14:361:32027:28:38:72:538:205:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:increase in the share of county foreign-born population increased wages and labor productivities 
14:362:32124:38:12:216:219:167:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:                                                 
14:363:32172:12:12:72:374:155:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:15 The results were robust to the exclusion of Mountain and Pacific states.  
14:364:32249:12:11:72:529:143:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:16 Atack, Bateman and Margo (2005) explore the relationship between capital intensity and factory organization.  
14:365:32362:11:12:72:515:132:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:17 Edin, Fredricksson and Åslund (2003) find that ethnic enclaves in Sweden increased the wages of unskilled 
14:366:32471:12:11:72:526:120:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:workers: a standard deviation in concentration increased their wages by 13%. Their evidence based on individual 
14:367:32583:11:12:72:535:109:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:level data suggests that ethnic enclaves provide network effects or provide human capital externalities. My analysis 
14:368:32700:12:12:72:541:97:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:suggests that ethnic enclaves also improve the productivity of firms by lowering the costs of matching heterogeneous 
14:369:32817:12:11:72:539:85:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:workers and firms. Ottaviano and Peri (2005a) find a positive correlation between wages and employment density of 
14:370:32931:11:0:72:528:74:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:U.S.-born workers and linguistic diversity suggesting that a diversity of skills enhances the productivity of a city.  
15:371:33052:0:28:72:509:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:by 8 to 19%. In terms of firm level characteristics, wages and productivity were positively 
15:372:33144:28:28:72:507:680:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:correlated with capital intensity, male labor intensity and steam-power use, but negatively 
15:373:33236:28:28:72:278:652:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:correlated with utilization of water power. 
15:374:33280:28:28:108:539:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: For 1870 and 1880, the county-level data contain data on the share of immigrants born in 
15:375:33369:28:28:72:524:596:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:different countries as well as data on the share of native-born who migrated from other states. 
15:376:33465:28:28:71:513:568:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:The regression estimates reported in Table 8 indicate that shares of foreign-born from most 
15:377:33557:28:28:71:531:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:European countries, such as Ireland, Germany, England and Wales, and Scandinavia, and from 
15:378:33648:28:27:71:529:512:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:British America (Canada) were positively correlated with factory organization and firm size as 
15:379:33743:27:28:71:527:485:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:well as wages and productivity. However, firms in counties with higher shares of foreign-born 
15:380:33837:28:28:71:520:457:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:from Italy were less likely to organize as factories. Interestingly, native in-migration was not 
15:381:33934:28:28:71:518:429:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:associated with factory organization or firm size, but were associated with higher wages and 
15:382:34027:28:28:71:533:401:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:productivity. Finally, ethnic diversity also contributed to factory organization and firm size and 
15:383:34126:28:28:71:461:373:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:was positively correlated with wages and productivity in 1880 but not in 1870.18 
15:384:34206:28:28:107:536:345:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: Tables (9)-(12) present estimates of the instrumental variables regressions. Although not 
15:385:34296:28:28:71:539:317:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:reported for space considerations, the regressions include all the exogenous variables as in Table 
15:386:34395:28:28:71:534:289:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:7. For both the IVprobit estimates on factory organization and the IV estimates on firm size, the 
15:387:34493:28:28:71:519:261:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:IVprobit or the IV estimates are relatively similar to those of the probit or the OLS estimates 
15:388:34589:28:28:71:530:233:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:except for 1880 when the IV estimates are significantly smaller. However, the IVprobit and IV 
15:389:34683:28:28:71:534:205:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:estimates are higher than the probit or the OLS estimates when the instruments used are the two 
15:390:34779:28:28:71:482:177:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:transportation related variables for 1860 and 1870. For average firm-level wages and 
15:391:34864:28:40:71:526:149:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:productivities, the IV estimates are similar or greater than the OLS estimates, especially when 
15:392:34960:40:12:216:219:109:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:                                                 
15:393:35008:12:12:72:521:97:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:18 Immigrant diversity is measured using the following standard index of diversity: Diversity = 1/Σi (FBij/Popj)2 
15:394:35121:12:11:71:525:85:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:where FBij is foreign-born population from country i in county j and Popj is total population in county j. The data 
15:395:35237:11:0:72:310:74:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:contain information on foreign-born from 25-27 countries.  
16:396:35298:0:28:72:526:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:the instrument used are distance from New York city and water transportation access in 1850. 
16:397:35391:28:28:72:539:680:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:The differences are also significantly greater in 1880 than in the earlier years. Overidentification 
16:398:35492:28:28:72:335:652:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:tests generally indicate the validity of the instruments. 
16:399:35550:28:28:108:539:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: In addition to the formal statistical evidence presented in this paper, there is considerable 
16:400:35644:28:28:72:514:596:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:anecdotal evidence that immigrants played a major role in industrial America. The clothing 
16:401:35735:28:28:72:535:568:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:industry in New York City provides an illustrative example of the impact of immigrant workers 
16:402:35829:28:28:72:519:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:on American industries. In the early nineteenth century, clothing was made by artisan tailors 
16:403:35923:28:27:72:508:512:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:assisted by journeymen tailors and apprentices. In New York City, the majority of the 357

16:408:36366:28:28:72:512:373:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:where few skilled workers were employed as cutters and semi- and unskilled workers were 
16:409:36454:28:28:72:518:345:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:recruited to sew. Although most of the early sewing women were natives, they were quickly 
16:410:36544:28:28:72:527:317:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:displaced by immigrant workers during the period of heavy immigration in the 1840s. Prior to 
16:411:36637:28:28:72:540:289:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:1850, most firms operated “inside shops” composed of specialized cutting departments for coats, 
16:412:36733:28:28:72:528:261:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:pants, vests, and trimmings. Sewing was contracted to outside workers. According to Feldman 
16:413:36825:28:28:72:529:233:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:(1960, 97)), “Brooks employed 78 people on the premises and more than 1,500 outside. Lewis 
16:414:36916:28:28:72:540:205:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:and Hanford in 1849 employed 72 people inside and 3,600 outside.” With the introduction of the 
16:415:37011:28:28:72:517:177:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:sewing machine, a good portion of the sewing operation moved inside the shop. In addition, 
16:416:37102:28:28:72:514:149:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:division of labor increased within sewing as workers specialized by plain sewing, stitching, 
16:417:37195:28:28:72:534:121:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:finishing process, embroidering, etc. (See Feldman (1960), Pope (1905), Waldinger (1986), and 
16:418:37289:28:0:72:305:93:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:Burrows and Wallace (1999), and Stott (1990)).

17:421:37377:28:28:108:505:652:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: Between 1820 and 1920, immigrants to the United States came from a historically 
17:422:37457:28:28:72:539:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:unprecedented number of different nations and backgrounds. Immigration not only increased the 
17:423:37551:28:28:72:518:596:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:unskilled to skilled endowment ratio, it also significantly increased the diversity of the labor 
17:424:37648:28:28:72:537:568:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:force. While the vast majority of immigrants was classified in the unskilled category, immigrant 
17:425:37745:28:28:72:541:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:workers possessed diversity of prior work experience and physical attributes. Thus, immigration, 
17:426:37842:28:27:71:508:512:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:by increasing the diversity of the workforce, extended the potential for division of labor in 
17:427:37936:27:28:71:222:485:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:society, especially in factories. 
17:428:37970:28:28:107:538:457:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:  Table 13 presents the occupational distribution of the foreign-born by national origins in 
17:429:38062:28:28:71:539:429:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:manufacturing, mining and mechanical industries for 1870 and 1890.19 Although the data cannot 
17:430:38156:28:28:72:531:401:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:distinguish artisans from factory occupations, they indicate significant clustering of occupation 
17:431:38254:28:28:72:525:373:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:by nationalities. In 1870, the Germans specialized in many food related industries as brewers, 
17:432:38349:28:28:72:529:345:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:distillers, butchers and confectioners, but they also specialized in other occupations as basket-, 
17:433:38448:28:28:72:519:317:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:cabinet-, cigar-, and piano-makers. The Irish were highly specialized in gas-works and other 
17:434:38541:28:28:72:525:289:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:heavy industries and were employed in manual occupations such as bleachers (textiles), brass-
17:435:38634:28:28:72:541:261:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:founders, iron-foundry operatives, iron-furnace operatives among others. The English and Welsh 
17:436:38729:28:28:72:496:233:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:were concentrated in textiles, iron and steel, and in certain machine manufacturing. The 
17:437:38818:28:38:72:531:205:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:Scandinavians were highly specialized in a few occupations: sail and awning makers and those 
17:438:38911:38:12:216:219:167:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:                                                 
17:439:38959:12:12:72:511:155:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:19 The census occupational categories probably understate the extent of ethnic division of labor. Even within 
17:440:39069:12:11:72:519:143:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:occupational categories, there were considerable ethnic specialization. For example, Bodnar, Simon and Weber 
17:441:39178:11:12:72:533:132:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:(1982; 62-63) write: “Italians coming to Pittsburgh had considerable experience in nonagricultural and skilled blue-
17:442:39294:12:11:72:539:120:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:collar work. These experiences enabled them to secure a variety of occupations while the successful operation of the 
17:443:39411:11:12:72:531:109:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:kin network at the same time funneled Italians into clusters within certain industries. Nearly 60 percent of all adult 
17:444:39530:12:12:72:529:97:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:male Italians were classified as laborers in the 1900 census. Oral interviews and the Pittsburgh Survey of 1907 un-
17:445:39645:12:11:72:532:85:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:covered several distinct groupings of Italian day laborers. Italians in the steel industry dominated carpentry, repair, 
17:446:39765:11:0:72:137:74:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:and rail shops.” 
18:447:39784:0:28:72:223:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:related to the lumber industry.  
18:448:39817:28:28:108:542:680:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: While there were some changes in the definitions of occupations between 1879 and 1890, 
18:449:39904:28:28:72:506:652:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:the data indicate that occupational clustering by nationalities persisted over time. There is 
18:450:39998:28:28:72:502:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:considerable overlap in the occupational categories in which Germans, Irish, British, and 
18:451:40088:28:28:72:530:596:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:Scandinavians were over-represented in both 1870 and 1890. However, there were some major 
18:452:40177:28:28:72:540:568:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:changes as well. Some of these changes were due to the arrival of new immigrant groups such as 
18:453:40272:28:28:72:503:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:the Italians. Italians were over-represented in the boot and shoe, charcoal, coke and lime, 
18:454:40364:28:27:72:406:512:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:confectioners, distillers and rectifiers industries among a few others.  
18:455:40437:27:28:108:529:485:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: Despite the fact that close to one third of the workers in manufacturing and mechanical 
18:456:40525:28:28:72:533:457:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:industries were women in 1890, the data on occupation by sex reveal limited scope for division 
18:457:40620:28:28:72:532:429:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:of labor for women in manufacturing.20 Compared to men’s, women’s occupations were highly 
18:458:40710:28:28:72:527:401:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:specialized in a few industries. German women were over-represented as bakers; Irish women 
18:459:40801:28:28:72:517:373:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:were mostly servants and were not well represented in manufacturing; British and Canadian 
18:460:40891:28:28:72:515:345:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:(French-speaking) women were most prevalent in textile related occupations. Of the female 
18:461:40981:28:28:72:526:317:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:workers, only the Italian women were specialized in a variety of industries. Consequently, the 
18:462:41076:28:28:72:533:289:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:data suggest that industrialization based on the unskilled labor of native women and children in 
18:463:41173:28:28:72:486:261:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:the United States is likely to been much more muted and confined to a few industries.

18:465:41259:28:28:72:240:205:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:IV. Immigration and Urbanization 
18:466:41292:28:28:108:526:177:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: The United States transformed from a rural to an urban nation between 1820 and 1920 
18:467:41376:28:40:72:539:149:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:during the era of mass immigration. Interestingly, the pace of urban growth, especially in central 
18:468:41475:40:12:216:219:109:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:                                                 
18:469:41523:12:12:72:529:97:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:20 While female labor specialization may have been influenced by discrimination, Goldin’s (1990) work suggests 
18:470:41634:12:11:71:528:85:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:that discrimination against female workers in nineteenth century manufacturing was likely to have been relatively 
18:471:41748:11:0:72:126:74:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:unimportant. 
19:472:41763:0:28:72:536:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:cities, slowed considerably after 1920 as immigration ended. In 1820, the great majority or 93% 
19:473:41859:28:28:72:501:680:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:of the population lived in rural areas; by 1920, a majority or 51% resided in cities. In the 
19:474:41952:28:28:72:519:652:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:succeeding decades, the share of urban population rose modestly to 57% in 1940 and then to 
19:475:42043:28:28:72:526:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:64% in 1960 (Kim (2000)).21 It is well known that immigrants were concentrated in cities and 
19:476:42136:28:28:72:536:596:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:were much more likely to live in cities than natives.22 In 1870, 26.4% of foreign-born resided in 
19:477:42234:28:28:72:524:568:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:cities with populations greater than 100,000 as compared to 8.1% of native-born; in 1920, the 
19:478:42328:28:27:72:295:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:figures were 47.7% and 22.6% respectively.23 
19:479:42372:27:28:108:518:513:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: In this section, I estimate the extent to which the foreign-born individuals were more 
19:480:42459:28:28:72:535:485:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:likely to reside in cities as compared to the native-born using individual level data from IPUMS 
19:481:42556:28:28:72:534:457:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:for 1880 and 1920. While I do not address the issue of native displacement by the foreign-born, 
19:482:42652:28:28:72:514:429:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:the use of individual level data makes it possible to control for many of the individual level 
19:483:42747:28:28:72:487:401:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:characteristics which contribute to location decisions and should mitigate some of the 
19:484:42834:28:28:72:534:373:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:simultaneity problems. The samples were restricted to individuals who were 16 or older and for 
19:485:42929:28:28:72:529:345:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:those whose urban and literacy statuses were identified. In 1880, the sample consisted of more 
19:486:43024:28:28:72:530:317:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:than 300,000 individuals; in 1920, the figure was close to 700,000 (Table 14). In 1880, 32% of 
19:487:43119:28:28:72:531:289:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:the individuals in the sample lived in cities; in 1920, the figure was 54.6%. However, the share 
19:488:43216:28:28:72:440:261:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:of the population who were foreign-born remained near 20% for both years. 
19:489:43290:28:28:108:542:233:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: The logistic estimates presented in Table 15 show that the foreign-born were over 3 times 
19:490:43380:28:12:216:219:205:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:                                                 
19:491:43428:12:12:72:534:193:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:21 There seems to be some correlation between urbanization and establishment plant size. O’Brien (1988) and Kim 
19:492:43540:12:11:71:538:181:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:(1995) show that establishment size by production workers generally rose between 1880 and 1920 and then fell over 
19:493:43654:11:12:71:533:170:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:the second half of the twentieth century for many industries. These trends in plant size may reflect the general shift 
19:494:43773:12:11:72:514:158:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:in manufacturing production from the factory-assembly method based on division of labor to the factory-batch 
19:495:43882:11:12:72:542:147:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:method based on machine mechanization. Since labor recruiting and matching costs were likely to be more important 
19:496:43996:12:12:72:542:135:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:under factory-assembly based on division of labor, manufacturing contributed significantly to urbanization; however, 
19:497:44113:12:11:72:515:123:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:as establishments required fewer and fewer workers, manufacturing became less urbanized. These trends seem 
19:498:44220:11:12:71:490:112:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:consistent with the notion that division of labor was an important reason for why manufacturing became 
19:499:44323:12:11:71:217:100:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:concentrated in cities (Kim (2006)). 
19:500:44360:11:12:71:303:89:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:22 See Carpenter (1927), Ward (1972) and Bartel (1989). 
19:501:44416:12:0:71:520:77:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:23 For all urban areas, 61.4% of foreign-born resided in cities in 1890 as compared to 31.6% for native-born; in 
20:502:44531:0:28:72:526:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:more likely to reside in cities in 1880 but that the figure declined somewhat by 1920. Without 
20:503:44626:28:28:72:533:680:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:any controls, foreign-born were 3.6 and 3 times more likely to reside in cities in 1880 and 1920 
20:504:44723:28:28:72:525:652:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:respectively. With controls for individual characteristics such as sex, age, marital and literacy 
20:505:44821:28:28:72:533:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:statuses, the estimates on foreign-born rose slightly. Women and literate individuals were more 
20:506:44917:28:28:72:532:596:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:likely to reside in cities, but the coefficient on age and marital status depended on occupational 
20:507:45016:28:28:72:510:568:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:and locational fixed effects. When detailed occupational fixed-effects were included in the 
20:508:45108:28:28:72:533:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:regression, the foreign-born coefficient declined somewhat. However, the largest decline came, 
20:509:45203:28:27:72:405:512:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:especially in 1920, when the regressions included state fixed-effects. 
20:510:45274:27:28:108:509:485:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: Did immigrants contribute significantly to urbanization or did they simply displace 
20:511:45358:28:28:72:540:457:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:natives from cities?24 Unfortunately, there is no empirical estimate of native urban displacement. 
20:512:45457:28:28:72:534:429:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:However, Hatton and Williamson (1998) find that between 1880 and 1910, 100 foreign-born in-
20:513:45548:28:28:72:511:401:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:migrants displaced 40 native-born by out-migration in the Northeast region. For the period 
20:514:45639:28:28:72:529:373:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:between 1870 and 1910, Collins (1997) finds a displacement rate of about 4.8 blacks for every 
20:515:45733:28:28:72:514:345:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:100 foreign-born migrants.25 Thus, while immigrants may have displaced some natives, the 
20:516:45822:28:28:72:535:317:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:displacement rate was hardly one for one and the simple fact that immigrants were significantly 
20:517:45918:28:28:72:540:289:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:more likely to reside in cities than natives suggests that immigrants had a fundamental impact on 
20:518:46016:28:28:72:396:261:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:the geography of the American economy in the nineteenth century. 
20:519:46081:28:31:108:539:233:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: Why did immigrants concentrate in cities? Most likely, immigrants concentrated in cities 
20:520:46170:31:12:539:542:202:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:                                                                                                                                                             
20:521:46326:12:12:72:420:190:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:1920, the figures were 75.4% and 47.7% respectively. See Gibson and Lennon (1999). 
20:522:46409:12:12:72:536:178:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:24 For the second half of the twentieth century, the evidence is somewhat mixed. Filer (1992) finds that immigrants 
20:523:46525:12:11:72:529:166:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:displaced natives whereas Wright, Ellis and Reibel (1997) find that the displacement of natives from metropolitan 
20:524:46639:11:12:72:426:155:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:areas where immigrants settled were due to reasons other than the inflow of immigrants. 
20:525:46727:12:11:72:536:143:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:25 Hatton and Williamson (1998) control for state-level employment growth, share of labor force in manufacturing, 
20:526:46841:11:12:71:515:132:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:share of urban population, share of populations aged 15-27, and log of real manufacturing earnings, but do not 
20:527:46952:12:12:72:534:120:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:control for individual level characteristics of natives and foreign-born. If the natives are much more skilled than the 
20:528:47072:12:11:72:530:108:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:foreign-born, then out migration of natives may be unrelated to the inflow of immigrants since natives and foreign-
20:529:47187:11:12:72:500:97:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:born may be poor substitutes. The displacement figures reported for blacks by Collins (1997) may be more 
20:530:47292:12:11:72:520:85:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:appropriate since the skill levels of immigrants were more likely to resemble those of blacks than native whites; 
20:531:47406:11:0:72:455:74:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:however, the displacement figures for blacks may have been much lower due to discrimination. 
21:532:47501:0:28:72:535:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:to take advantage of ethnic externalities (Borjas (1995)). Immigrant networks greatly facilitated 
21:533:47599:28:28:72:518:680:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:the transmission of knowledge concerning labor market conditions and skill requirements of 
21:534:47690:28:28:72:516:652:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:their specialized occupations and industries.26 Ethnic networks fostered division of labor by 
21:535:47784:28:28:72:541:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:immigrant groups. In addition, Kim (2006) suggests that the rise of the labor market and division 
21:536:47882:28:28:72:521:596:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:of labor led to the concentration of firms and workers in cities as they attempted to minimize 
21:537:47977:28:28:72:531:568:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:labor matching costs. Thus, even though many of the first wave of immigrants came from rural 
21:538:48070:28:28:72:361:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:Europe, most immigrants became city dwellers in America.

21:541:48142:28:28:108:511:457:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: Ever since Habakkuk (1962), the idea of skilled or unskilled-biased technology has 
21:542:48225:28:28:72:520:429:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:generated significant interest in economics. In recent years, a number of scholars have found 
21:543:48319:28:28:72:522:401:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:evidence of technology-skilled complementarities between computer-based technologies and 
21:544:48408:28:28:72:541:373:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:college educated labor (Autor, Levy and Murnane (2003), Berman, Bound, and Griliches (1994),

21:546:48592:28:28:72:518:317:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:(1998) present evidence that technology-skilled complementarity originated with the shift in 
21:547:48685:28:28:72:524:289:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:manufacturing from factory-assembly to factory-batch or continuous production methods and 
21:548:48775:28:36:72:530:261:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:that this shift may have been caused by the rapid rise in American high school education in the 
21:549:48871:36:12:216:219:225:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:                                                 
21:550:48919:12:12:72:521:213:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:26 There is considerable anecdotal evidence of ethnic division of labor (see Earnst (1949), Rischin (1962), Stott 
21:551:49033:12:11:72:535:201:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:(1990), Ward (1989), Barrett (1987), and Bodnar (1977) to list just a few.)) Bodnar, Simon and Weber (1982) finds 
21:552:49147:11:12:72:528:190:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:that, unlike the Italians and Poles, the blacks were unable to establish occupation networks in Pittsburgh. Because 
21:553:49263:12:12:72:526:178:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:blacks were forced to seek work on their own, they endured substantial periods of unemployment before securing 
21:554:49374:12:11:71:361:166:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:their initial jobs. Also see U.S. Senate (1911): Immigrants in Industries. 
21:555:49449:11:12:72:538:155:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:27 In an open economy model of trade, a change in factor endowment can have two kinds of impacts: change in mix 
21:556:49561:12:11:72:535:143:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:of production caused by the Rybczynski’s theorem and a biased-technological change. Kim (1999) and Hanson and 
21:557:49671:11:12:72:533:132:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:Slaughter (2002) examine the impact of resource endowments on industry-mix. Lewis (2005, 2006) finds that local 
21:558:49783:12:12:72:532:120:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:labor supply shocks identified with a component of foreign immigration had little impact on local industry mix but 
21:559:49898:12:11:72:525:108:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:had significant impact in local factor intensity in production. These endogenous changes in technology were also 
21:560:50011:11:12:72:530:97:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:associated with little or no effect on relative wages. To the extent that differences in local factor endowments may 
21:561:50128:12:11:72:538:85:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:cause differences in local technologies, the literature on factor biased-technology provides evidence for the idea that 
21:562:50248:11:0:72:488:74:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:different localities, regions and nations may have different technologies of production (Treffler (1995)). 
22:563:50357:0:28:72:392:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:early twentieth century (Goldin and Katz (2000), Goldin (2001)).  
22:564:50423:28:28:108:525:680:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: This paper examines whether immigration, by significantly increasing the unskilled to 
22:565:50509:28:28:72:536:652:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:skilled labor endowment ratio, contributed to the growth and spread of factory production in the 
22:566:50606:28:28:71:529:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:second industrial period in the U.S. between 1860 and 1920. The empirical model is motivated 
22:567:50699:28:28:71:483:596:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:by Acemoglu (1998) and Goldin and Katz (1998). Acemoglu’s endogenous model of 
22:568:50777:28:28:71:533:568:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:technological change predicts that an increase in unskilled to skilled labor endowment will lead 
22:569:50874:28:28:71:527:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:to higher productivity of unskilled technology. As noted by Goldin and Katz (1998) and many 
22:570:50966:28:27:71:539:512:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:others, the form of unskilled technology in manufacturing was embodied in the form of a factory 
22:571:51062:27:28:71:238:485:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:system based on division of labor. 
22:572:51097:28:28:107:520:457:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: Based on the analysis of firm level data merged with county level information for the 
22:573:51183:28:28:71:525:429:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:period between 1850 and 1880, I find that immigration had a significant impact on the shift in 
22:574:51278:28:28:71:526:401:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:manufacturing from artisans to factories. Instrumental variable estimates indicate that firms in 
22:575:51375:28:28:72:530:373:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:counties with a significantly higher share of foreign-born population were much more likely to 
22:576:51470:28:28:72:536:345:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:organize as factories than as artisans. The diversity of immigrants also seem to have contributed 
22:577:51568:28:28:72:351:317:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:to the rise of a factory system based on division of labor.  
22:578:51629:28:28:108:503:289:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C: In the United States, the factory system of production arose in rural New England 
22:579:51711:28:28:72:537:261:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:between 1820 and 1840 to take advantage of that region’s abundance in unskilled native women 
22:580:51804:28:28:72:521:233:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:and children.28 However, because the supply of native unskilled workers was limited and too 
22:581:51896:28:28:72:528:205:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:homogenous, the industrial revolution in the Unites States would have been much more muted 
22:582:51987:28:12:216:219:177:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:                                                 
22:583:52035:12:12:72:528:165:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:28 Legal factors may have also lowered the costs of locating in rural locations during this period. Steinfeld (1991, 
22:584:52152:12:11:71:529:153:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:2001) argues that early American labor was “unfree” in the sense that employers possessed significant legal rights 
22:585:52267:11:12:71:536:142:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:over workers. In particular, workers who breached their employment contracts were subject to criminal sanctions or 
22:586:52382:12:11:72:521:130:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:forfeiture of back wages. Consequently, the employer’s legal position reduced the level of turn-over in the labor 
22:587:52496:11:12:71:507:119:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:market. In the 1850’s, with the rise in the idea of “free labor” in America, employers lost much of their legal 
22:588:52608:12:12:72:494:107:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:leverage over employees. As workers could terminate their employment any time, the change in the legal 
22:589:52711:12:11:72:536:95:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:environment likely increased worker turn-over and raised the cost of recruiting workers in rural areas. Interestingly, 
22:590:52830:11:0:72:526:84:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:B:Hamilton (2000) suggests that changes in the ability of a master to enforce apprentice contracts in North America 
23:591:52946:0:28:72:525:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:without immigrants. Immigrants not only significantly increased the unskilled to skilled labor 
23:592:53041:28:28:72:523:680:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:endowment, but they also increased the diversity of skills and worker attributes important for 
23:593:53136:28:28:72:500:652:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:division of labor in factories. In addition, immigration and division of labor significantly 
23:594:53229:28:28:72:279:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:contributed to urbanization (Kim (2006)).  
23:595:53272:28:28:108:491:596:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:  What lessons and insights emerge from history for understanding the impact of 
23:596:53352:28:28:72:527:568:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:immigration on the American economy today? The experience of the era of mass immigration 
23:597:53441:28:28:72:537:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:points to the great absorptive capacity of the American economy. While immigration may lower 
23:598:53534:28:27:72:530:512:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:the wages of natives in the short run, the long-run impact of immigration is likely to have been 
23:599:53631:27:28:72:519:485:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:much more positive as indicated by the secular rise in long-run real wages (Figure 4). In this 
23:600:53726:28:28:72:540:457:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:paper, I suggest that the source of this great absorptive capacity of the American economy lies in 
23:601:53825:28:28:72:510:429:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:its ability to develop and implement technologies which favor changing factor endowment 
23:602:53913:28:28:72:515:401:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:conditions. In addition, history teaches that these induced technological changes have had a 
23:603:54006:28:28:72:409:373:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:major impact on the geographic landscape of the American economy.
