2:12:331:26:26:295:343:693:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Abstract 
2:13:339:26:21:139:496:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Global reliance  on  Hydrocarbon  sector  has  dramatically  increased  multi-
2:14:417:21:20:139:499:646:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:fold which has led to rise to dominance of GCC. GCC is home to 45% of 
2:15:487:20:21:139:498:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:the  proven  oil  reserves  and  contributes  nearly  35%  of  the  world  oil 
2:16:566:21:21:139:498:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:exports  annually.  With  such  heavy  reliance  of  the  world  on  GCC  for  its 
2:17:649:21:20:139:499:584:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:A:oil produce, and the GCC’s economic reliance on Oil and Gas exports, 
2:18:718:20:21:139:498:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:the matter of world oil price shocks and its transmission to other areas of 
2:19:794:21:21:139:498:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:economy  is  of  immense  importance  to  the  GCC  economies.  With  Oil 
2:20:868:21:21:139:498:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:wealth  accumulating  in  GCC  with  some  estimates  of  over  $500  billion, 
2:21:947:21:20:139:498:501:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:oil  shocks  and  stock  market  volatility  in  GCC  has  emerged  as  a  key 
2:22:1026:20:21:139:498:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:concern area. Our paper focuses on understanding the short term and long 
2:23:1099:21:21:139:498:460:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:C:term  correlation  between  oil  price  shocks  and  GCC  stock  market’s 
2:24:1173:21:20:139:498:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:volatility  and  the  presence  of  any  lead  lag  relationships.  This  study 
2:25:1253:20:21:139:499:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:provides  unique  findings,  different  from  earlier  studies  as  we  are  able  to 
2:26:1339:21:21:139:499:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:analyze with non-linearity and least restrictive assumptions. The findings 
2:27:1414:21:20:139:498:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:of    this    study    are    paramount    for    portfolio    managers    for    their

3:41:1976:0:27:112:191:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:I. Introduction 
3:42:1990:27:28:112:526:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Gulf Cooperation Council was established in 1981 with six member nations namely 
3:43:2070:28:27:112:525:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). 
3:44:2149:27:28:112:525:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:All these countries have  gained importance in regards to global development owing 
3:45:2232:28:27:112:526:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to  their  status  as  global  business  hubs  backed  by  47%  of  the  proven  world oil 
3:46:2322:27:28:112:525:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reserves.  GCC  produces  nearly  upto  20%  of  all  world  oil,  while  controlling  nearly 
3:47:2416:28:28:112:525:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:35% of world oil exports. For these economies, their governmental earning and fiscal 
3:48:2501:28:27:112:525:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:planning  and  expenditures  are  largely  determined  by  the  oil  exports  and  the 
3:49:2588:27:28:112:226:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:international oil prices. 
3:50:2613:28:27:112:525:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The past quarter of a century has seen the GCC countries focusing extensively their 
3:51:2697:27:28:112:525:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:hydrocarbon  policies  on  two  aspects.  Firstly  the  hydrocarbon  sector  has  been  the 
3:52:2789:28:28:112:526:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:focal   point   for   funding   resources   for   government   spending   on   infrastructural 
3:53:2884:28:27:112:525:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:development and heavy transfer payments to citizens, and attracting foreign services 
3:54:2969:27:28:112:525:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:industry  and  workforce  with  a  tax  free  environment.  Secondly  heavy  investments 
3:55:3058:28:27:112:525:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:have  gone  into  cross  border  instruments,  primarily  in  Europe  and  United  States,  in 
3:56:3153:27:28:112:307:345:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the form of capital market investments.  
3:57:3193:28:28:112:525:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:In  regards  to  the  capital  market  structures  in  GCC,  quite  a  few  limitations  exist  as 
3:58:3292:28:27:112:525:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:compared  to  the  developed  world,  like  regulatory  weaknesses  and  relatively  small 
3:59:3383:27:28:112:525:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:numbers of listed firms with large institutional holdings, and a positive Skewness of 
3:60:3469:28:27:112:289:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:listed firms to oil dependent sectors. 
3:61:3507:27:28:112:525:207:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Last  few  years,  especially  post  the  2007  oil  price  shocks  and  the  2008  global 
3:62:3598:28:28:112:525:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economic crisis, much effort has been put into by GCC countries in strengthening the 
3:63:3683:28:27:112:430:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:legal, regulatory, and supervisory structures for efficient markets. 
3:64:3750:27:28:112:525:124:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:GCC member countries represent very attractive and lucrative emerging economies. 
3:65:3831:28:0:112:525:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Apart  from  Bahrain,  and  to  Dubai,  (an  emirate  under  UAE)  are  relatively  unknown 
4:66:3924:0:28:112:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to  the  global  investors.  The  promising  potential of  the  GCC  markets  has  recently 
4:67:4015:28:28:112:525:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:becoming  more  prominent  with  the  economies  opening  up  their  capital  markets. 
4:68:4102:28:27:112:525:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:While  Bahrain,  Kuwait,  and  recently  Qatar  have  allowed  foreign  stock  ownership, 
4:69:4192:27:28:112:466:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Saudi Arabia permits foreign ownership via investment in mutual funds.  
4:70:4263:28:27:112:525:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:A  structural  and  attractive  benefit  of  the  opening  up  of  GCC  markets  for  foreign 
4:71:4357:27:28:112:525:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:investors is the benefit of diversification they allow. Structurally the markets in GCC 
4:72:4445:28:28:112:525:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:are  different  from  other  emerging  economies  as  they  are  largely  segmented  from 
4:73:4535:28:27:112:526:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:global  equity  markets  but  overly  sensitive  to  regional  political  events,  and  high 
4:74:4628:27:28:112:357:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:dependency of economies on hydrocarbon exports 
4:75:4674:28:27:112:525:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The  last  few  decades  have  seen  tremendous  fluctuations  in  the  oil  prices  as  earlier 
4:76:4771:27:28:112:525:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:mentioned is evident from Chart 1 and Chart 2. Between March 2007 and June 2008, 
4:77:4852:28:28:112:525:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  international  crude  oil  prices  experienced  a  phenomenal  increase  of  76%  and 
4:78:4943:28:27:112:525:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:then a rapid decline during the global economic crisis of 48% between July 2008 and 
4:79:5027:27:28:112:526:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:October  2008.  Regardless  of  these  absolute  numbers  indicating  rapid  decline  and 
4:80:5117:28:27:112:525:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:upswing  in  prices,  Chart  1,  shows  worrying  pattern  of  high  volatility  in  daily 
4:81:5208:27:153:112:222:345:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:fluctuations in prices.

4:83:5260:27:27:112:525:165:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:An  interesting  aspect  to  the  GCC  economies  and  which  relatively  complicates  any 
4:84:5351:27:28:112:525:138:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:macroeconomic investigation in the GCC countries is the effective tying of exchange 
4:85:5435:28:0:112:526:110:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:rate to US dollar. This implies that their monetary policies and thus their short-term 
5:86:5523:0:28:112:525:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:interest rates follow the US monetary policy and its short-term interest rates (Karam, 
5:87:5610:28:28:112:149:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2001).

5:89:5617:27:28:112:525:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:From a global portfolio management comprehension of the linkage of volatility of oil 
5:90:5702:28:27:112:526:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:price  with  GCC  markets  is  imminent  for  making  informed  decision  making. At  the 
5:91:5792:27:28:112:525:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:same  time,  the  understanding  of  this  relationship  is  essential  for  policy  makers  and 
5:92:5889:28:207:112:403:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:monetary managers for policy making and implementation.

5:94:5978:28:27:112:115:358:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
5:95:5978:27:28:112:526:331:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The dependence on the hydrocarbon has been at a steady increase in these economies 
5:96:6061:28:27:112:525:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:over  the  past  two  decades  as  evident  in  Chart  3.  Most  GCC  countries  now  range 
5:97:6153:27:28:112:525:276:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:above  75%  on  hydrocarbon  revenue  as  a  ratio  of  total  revenue.  Except  UAE,  all 
5:98:6244:28:28:112:525:248:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:other  GCC  member  countries  have  over  60%  of  their  exports  in  hydrocarbons, 
5:99:6330:28:27:112:526:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:primarily  oil.  With such  high  dependence  of  the  GCC  regions  on  hydrocarbon 
5:100:6415:27:28:112:525:193:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:production  it  sounded  natural  to  investigate  the  impact  of  oil  prices  on  the  capital 
5:101:6513:28:27:112:224:165:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:markets of the region.  
5:102:6536:27:28:112:115:138:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
5:103:6536:28:28:112:525:110:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:From  literature  there  are  multiple  channels  via  which  oil  price  changes  impact  the 
5:104:6631:28:0:112:526:82:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:stock  market  of  a  country.    The  most  invoked  of  these  channels  is  through  the 
6:105:6724:0:28:112:525:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:discount  rate  factor  for  achieving  at  stock  price.  Oil  prices  directly  impact  the 
6:106:6818:28:28:112:525:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:productivity and macroeconomics of the country, in turn the macroeconomic changes 
6:107:6900:28:27:112:367:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:impacting the cash-flows and the discounting factor. 
6:108:6952:27:28:112:525:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:A number of studies in the recent past have been undertaken within the framework of 
6:109:7036:28:27:112:525:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:linear models using low frequency data for net oil importing countries, to investigate 
6:110:7123:27:28:112:473:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the short and long term relationship of oil price shocks and stock markets.  
6:111:7199:28:28:112:115:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
6:112:7199:28:27:112:525:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Our study is unique in the nature since we attempt to shed away with the assumption 
6:113:7283:27:28:112:525:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of linearity and stationarity assumptions regarding the time series variables. Linearity 
6:114:7372:28:27:112:526:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  stationarity  has  been  a  user  imposed  restriction  in  the econometric  models 
6:115:7460:27:28:112:526:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:employed  in  studying  oil-stock  market  relationships  till  now.  But  recently  with  the 
6:116:7555:28:28:112:495:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:advancement of methods, we are able to let go of these restrictive assumptions. 
6:117:7634:28:27:112:115:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
6:118:7634:27:38:112:410:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The question that we are attempting to investigate is twofold: 
6:119:7696:38:27:130:525:362:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:1) Is there any coherence between oil price shocks and stock market fluctuations 
6:120:7775:27:28:148:264:335:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:in short and long-term? 
6:121:7798:28:28:148:151:307:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:

6:123:7878:37:28:112:526:242:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:In  light  of  these  research  objectives,  the  paper  is  structured  in  a  manner  where  the 
6:124:7977:28:27:112:526:214:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:following  section  discusses  literature  on  oil-stock  market  relationship.  Section  3 
6:125:8069:27:28:112:525:187:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:sheds  a  quick  look  into  the  data  followed  by  a  brief  explanation  of  wavelet

7:131:8353:37:28:112:525:721:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Much empirical studies have been undertaken on the topic of oil shocks and impact 
7:132:8435:28:27:112:525:693:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:on  economic  variables.  Hamilton  (1983),  Cunado  and  Perez  de  Garcia  (2005),  and 
7:133:8525:27:28:112:525:666:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Kilian  (2008)  all  found  strong  evidence  of  oil  price  shocks  having  a  causal  relation 
7:134:8623:28:27:112:454:638:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:on recessions, inflation and economic growth in emerging economies.  
7:135:8691:27:28:112:525:611:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Regarding  specific  research  on  causal  relationship  of  oil  price  shocks  and  stock 
7:136:8783:28:28:112:525:583:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:markets  and  cointegrating  relationship  is  relatively  a  newer  field  in  literature.  In 
7:137:8879:28:27:112:526:555:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:recent studies the focus has been primarily on the Oil exporting economies Jones and 
7:138:8964:27:28:112:525:528:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Kaul (1996) investigate four developed stock markets reaction to oil shocks based on 
7:139:9049:28:27:112:525:500:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:standard cash flow dividend valuation model and find evidence of significant impact 
7:140:9133:27:28:112:509:473:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of oil changes in US and Canada, while inconclusive evidence for Japan and UK.  
7:141:9212:28:28:112:526:445:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:VAR  Models  have  been  recently  employed  to  investigate  the  oil-stock  market 
7:142:9297:28:27:112:528:417:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:relationship,  but  surprisingly  the   evidence  has  been  inconsistent  over  studies.  
7:143:9388:27:28:112:526:390:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Sadorsky  (1999)  and  Ciner  (2001)  found  evidence  of  asymmetric  and  nonlinear 
7:144:9474:28:27:112:320:362:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:linkages in oil – stock market relationship. 
7:145:9517:27:28:112:526:335:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Papapetrou(2001),  Basher  and  Sadorsky(2006),  Maghyereh  and  Al-Kandari  (2007) 
7:146:9601:28:28:112:525:307:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:all have found significant impact of oil shocks in emerging economies both on short 
7:147:9685:28:27:112:233:279:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:term as well as long run. 
7:148:9710:27:28:112:526:252:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Amongst  specific  focus  on  GCC  countries  we  find  surprisingly  scarce  research  on 
7:149:9801:28:27:112:526:224:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  impact  of  oil  price  shocks  to  equity  markets.  The  oil-stock  market  link  in  GCC 
7:150:9898:27:28:112:525:197:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:should be of immense importance since GCC countries are major suppliers of oil in 
7:151:9980:28:28:112:526:169:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:world energy markets, their stock markets are likely to be affected by changes in oil 
7:152:10065:28:27:112:147:141:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:prices. 
7:153:10072:27:28:112:525:114:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Hammoudeh  and  Alesia  (2004)  show  using  VAR  models  and  cointegration  tests, 
7:154:10157:28:0:112:525:86:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:evidence  of  bidirectional  relationship  between  Saudi  stock  returns  and  oil  price 
8:155:10249:0:28:112:525:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:movements.  Evidence  of  predictive  price  power  of  oil  price  change  on  GCC  stock 
8:156:10340:28:28:112:525:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:markets  in  Oman  and  Saudi  Arabia  was  found  by  Zarour  (2006)  employing  VAR 
8:157:10426:28:27:112:157:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:analysis. 
8:158:10435:27:28:112:526:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Hammoudeh  and  Choi  (2006)  in  their  investigation  of  long-run  relationship  among 
8:159:10525:28:27:112:526:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the GCC stock markets in the presence of the US oil market, the S&P 500 index and 
8:160:10607:27:28:112:525:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  US  Treasury  bill  rate,  report  that  oil  and  S&P  500  have  an  indirect  impact  on 
8:161:10704:28:28:112:457:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:these markets while evidence of direct impact of T-Bill rate was found. 
8:162:10775:28:27:112:526:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Hamilton  (2003),  Zhang  (2008),  Lardic  and  Mignon  (2006,  2008)  and  Cologni  and 
8:163:10864:27:28:112:525:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Manera (2009)  all contributed to the literature, finding evidence of link between oil 
8:164:10951:28:27:112:525:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and economic activity to be not entirely linear implying that negative oil price shocks 
8:165:11039:27:28:112:396:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:tend to have larger impact on growth than positive shocks. 
8:166:11097:28:28:112:525:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Arouri  and  Rault  (2009)  using  panel  data  approach  of  Konya  (2006)  found  strong 
8:167:11188:28:27:112:525:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:statistical  evidence  of  causal  relationship  being  consistently  bi-directional  for  Saudi 
8:168:11285:27:28:112:525:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Arabia. In line with standard thought they also found that Oil price shocks, Granger 
8:169:11370:28:27:112:301:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:cause stock prices, and not vice versa.  
8:170:11410:27:28:112:525:345:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:In the long-term, the influence of oil price on GCC stock prices was investigated by 
8:171:11495:28:28:112:525:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Ravuchandaran  and Alkhatalan (2010) and found the a prevailing influence that the 
8:172:11578:28:27:112:526:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:effect of oil price changes transmit to fundamental macroeconomic indicators, which 
8:173:11662:27:28:112:457:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in turn affect the long-term equilibrium linkage between these markets. 
8:174:11733:28:27:112:526:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The  non-linearity  of  the  relationships  between  oil  prices  and  stock  markets  in  GCC 
8:175:11828:27:28:112:526:207:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:was  investigated  by  Arouri,  Lahiani  and  Bellalah  (2010).  Their  found  that  stock 
8:176:11919:28:28:112:525:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:market returns significantly react to oil price changes in Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia 
8:177:12004:28:27:112:526:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and   UAE.   But   their   results   also   pointed   to   non-linear   relationship   switching 
8:178:12101:27:28:112:525:124:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:according  to  the  oil  price  values.  However,  for  Bahrain  and  Kuwait  they  found 
8:179:12191:28:0:112:430:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:evidence of no effect of oil price changes to stock market returns.

9:181:12259:28:28:112:525:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:From  a  review  of  the  literature  it  is  evident  that  results  of  few  studies  on  GCC 
9:182:12355:28:27:112:525:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:markets  and  globally  are  heterogeneous.  Intuitively  the  results  are  confusing,  since 
9:183:12450:27:28:112:504:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:GCC countries are heavily reliant on oil export with similar economic structures.

9:189:12721:28:27:112:525:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:undertaken  have been  restricted  either  due  to  datasets  or  due  to  the  restrictive  and

9:191:12847:28:28:112:525:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Previous  studies  in  this  area  have  mainly  used  low  frequency  data,  and  have  been 
9:192:12941:28:27:112:526:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:restricted  by  growth  phases,  of  either  pre  crisis  or  crisis  specific  studies.  For  this 
9:193:13041:27:28:112:525:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:study  we  use  daily  data  for  all  our  variables  to  adequately  capture  interaction

9:199:13550:28:27:112:525:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:often  used  as  reference  prices  for  crude  oil  globally.  Descriptive  statistics  for  the

10:220:14522:28:27:112:525:347:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:For this study, wavelet is employed in a step by step process for coherence analysis. 
10:221:14607:27:28:112:525:320:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Wavelet   Analysis   has   two   main   categories   which   have   been   implemented   in 
10:222:14699:28:27:112:525:292:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economics   and   finance   lately:   the   discrete   wavelet   analysis   (DWT)   and   the 
10:223:14793:27:28:112:526:265:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:continuous wavelet analysis (CWT). For some time now, almost a decade DWT was 
10:224:14871:28:28:112:525:237:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the dominant methodology for economic applications (Gencay et al., 2002; Ramsay, 
10:225:14952:28:27:112:525:209:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2002; Gallegati and Gallegati, 2007). In the last year or so the CWT has emerged as 
10:226:15036:27:28:112:526:182:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:a  popular  choice  of  academicians  for  studying the  interaction  and  co-movement  of 
10:227:15126:28:28:112:193:154:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:time series data. 
10:228:15143:28:27:112:525:126:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Important part of the continuous wavelet analysis is the ability to study  interactions 
10:229:15231:27:0:112:523:99:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:or co-movement between two time series in time-frequency domain using the cross-
11:230:15313:0:28:112:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:wavelet tools (Aguiar-Conraria et al., 2008; Rua and Nunes, 2009). In this study we 
11:231:15397:28:28:112:525:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:use the continuous wavelet analysis tools: wavelet coherence for measuring the local 
11:232:15482:28:27:112:390:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:correlation of two time series in time-frequency domain.  
11:233:15539:27:28:112:526:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:In literature on wavelet it is a common practice to use terminology of scale instead of 
11:234:15627:28:27:112:525:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:frequency.  It  should  be  remembered  that  frequency  has  an  inverse  relationship  with

12:296:17327:28:27:112:525:275:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:wavelet  coherence.  Cross  wavelet  transform  has  been  defined  by  (Torrence  and 
12:297:17414:27:28:112:525:248:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Compo,  1998; Grinsted  et  al.,  2004)  for  two  time  series  x(t)  and  y(t)  with  the 
12:298:17506:28:28:112:387:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:continuous wavelet transforms Wx(u, s) and Wy(u, s)by:

12:300:17591:28:27:112:525:164:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Where  u  is  a  position  index  and  s  denotes  the  scale,  symbol ∗ denotes  a  complex

13:303:17695:0:28:112:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Furthermore,  we  define  cross  wavelet  power  as |Wxy(u,  s)| (Hudgins  et  al.,  1993; 
13:304:17786:28:28:112:526:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Torrence and Compo, 1998). The cross wavelet power uncovers areas in time–scale 
13:305:17866:28:27:112:525:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:space where the two time series show high common power, i.e. it represents the local 
13:306:17951:27:28:112:526:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:covariance between  the  time  series  at  each  scale.  Since  our  analysis  is  based  on 
13:307:18043:28:27:112:525:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:financial variables we are also interested in the regions where the two time series in 
13:308:18130:27:28:112:526:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:time–scale space co-move, but does not necessarily have high power. Useful wavelet 
13:309:18213:28:28:112:441:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:tool that can uncover these co-movements is the wavelet coherence. 
13:310:18279:28:27:112:525:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The wavelet coherence is a measure of local correlation of the two time series both in 
13:311:18366:27:28:112:525:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:time  and  scale.  Following  approach  of  Torrence  and  Webster  (1999),  we  define  the 
13:312:18459:28:27:112:526:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:wavelet  coherence  as  the  squared  absolute  value  of  the  smoothed  cross  wavelet

14:346:20333:27:28:112:526:334:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:wavelet transform (CWT), it is evident that there are periods of high volatility in the 
14:347:20421:28:27:112:525:306:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:basic daily returns of oil prices during two eras in our sample period. The first one is 
14:348:20510:27:28:112:526:279:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in  2003- 2004,  and  secondly  in  2008-2009. The  simple  volatility  plot  of  the  daily

15:357:21274:28:28:112:525:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:days  maximum,  and  it  died  out  on  a  longer  time  scale,  as  represented  by  blue  area. 
15:358:21372:28:27:112:526:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The plausible reason for the short impact of this price spike is related to fundamental 
15:359:21459:27:28:112:525:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:changes in the underlying factors. At a glance at the reasons for the oil price shock of 
15:360:21548:28:27:112:526:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2003-04, the primary source was the initiation of military action in Iraq. During 2004 
15:361:21634:27:28:112:526:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and 2005 the excess oil production capacity was less than a million barrels per day, 
15:362:21718:28:28:112:526:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:not enough to cover an interruption of supply from most OPEC producers. This fear 
15:363:21800:28:27:112:525:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of  disruption  of  oil supply  caused  this  spike,  but with  smooth  sailing  for  the  war  in 
15:364:21899:27:28:112:526:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Iraq  and  oil  supply, the  shock  did  not  cause  fundamental  shifts  to  impact  oil  prices 
15:365:21996:28:37:112:204:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:over the long run.  
15:366:22015:37:28:112:525:473:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The second oil shock was a for a longer time period, starting in 2008 and leading into 
15:367:22102:28:28:112:525:445:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2009.  Referring  to  CWT  plot,  it  is  noticeable  that  the  higher  volatility  of  oil  shock 
15:368:22202:28:27:112:526:417:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:this time had a longer impact of upto 16 days on the short run,  with high impact in 
15:369:22286:27:28:112:525:390:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the shortest run of upto 4 days.  In the analysis of the actual movement of the prices 
15:370:22373:28:0:112:516:362:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:we notice in Chart 1 earlier, that this oil shock was in reality a negative drive of oil  
16:371:22464:0:37:112:311:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Fig. 3. CWT plot of Oil Price Volatilty 
16:372:22503:37:28:112:526:390:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:prices  on  the  back  of  recession,  with the  oil  price  showing  a  very  erratic  behavior, 
16:373:22601:28:27:112:525:362:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:but  with  a  steady  downward  trend.    This  phase  of  oil  price  volatility  not  only  had 
16:374:22699:27:28:112:525:335:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:impacts  on  short  run  but  it  is  noticeable  that  the  in  the  long  run  there  has  been  a 
16:375:22800:28:28:112:526:307:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:relatively higher impact than before as evident by the yellow zone in the lag of 256. 
16:376:22886:28:27:112:525:279:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:This  has  two  meanings  for  our  economic  interpretation,  firstly  the  high  volatility 
16:377:22980:27:28:112:525:252:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:phase  lasted  for  over  256  days,  and  secondly  and  more  importantly,  and  this  oil 
16:378:23073:28:27:112:526:224:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:shock  plausibly  caused  structural  change  in  the  oil  price  movements.  The  structural 
16:379:23168:27:28:112:525:197:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:change  argument  in  the  view  of  author  intuitively  explains  as  this  volatility  period 
16:380:23265:28:28:112:525:169:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:coincides  with  the  global  economic  slowdown.  The  petroleum  demand  contracted 
16:381:23351:28:27:112:526:141:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:initially  spectacularly  in the  face  of  recession the price fell  throughout 2008 to a 
16:382:23441:27:0:112:526:114:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:bottom of $40 in December. Following an OPEC cut of 4.2 million barrels per day in 
17:383:23524:0:28:112:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:early 2009 which  led  to  increase  in prices  steadily  supported  by  rising  demand  in 
17:384:23614:28:38:112:140:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Asia. 
17:385:23619:38:27:112:526:693:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Moving on to our key focus area of this study, we delve into the coherence patterns 
17:386:23703:27:28:112:525:666:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:for  oil  price  fluctuations  and  the  GCC  Markets  one  by  one.  The  rationale  behind 
17:387:23796:28:27:112:525:638:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:studying  the  markets  separately  is  that  although  these  countries  share  numerous 
17:388:23886:27:28:112:526:611:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:common  traits,  as  dependence  on  energy  trade,  fixed  exchange  rate  regimes,  high 
17:389:23977:28:28:112:525:583:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:consumption  item  imports,  and  monarchy  rule  systems.  But  with  all  the  common 
17:390:24065:28:27:112:525:555:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:traits,  the  capital  market  openness  varies  and  the  composition  of  sector  weights  in 
17:391:24161:27:28:112:525:528:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:each market varies. Owing to these differences  we are led to make a cautious effort 
17:392:24246:28:38:112:511:500:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to study every markets reaction to oil shocks separately rather than generalizing it. 
17:393:24330:38:37:112:246:462:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  
17:394:24354:37:28:112:525:425:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:For  the  Saudi  Arabian  Stock  Market  Returns  and  Oil  Price  Returns  coherence 
17:395:24440:28:27:112:525:397:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:pattern,  we  have  an  output  which  is  defying  to  great  extent  the  rational  thinking, 
17:396:24536:27:28:112:525:370:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:There is an observation of some dark high correlation patterns in the 4 day lag period 
17:397:24623:28:27:112:526:342:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:during 2008 -2009 oil price shocks, but the high correlation disappears very quickly 
17:398:24707:27:28:112:525:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  medium  range  correlation  patterns  seem  to  appear  at  random  points  in  medium 
17:399:24799:28:28:112:525:287:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:term range, at a 64 day lag period. Intuitively this leads the authors to deduce, that in 
17:400:24889:28:27:112:525:259:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:short  run  there  is  a  co-movement  of  the  oil  price  and  KSA  Stock  Market,  but  the 
17:401:24984:27:28:112:525:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:short  periods  does  not  lead  us  to  make  any  conclusion  with  conviction  regarding 
17:402:25076:28:27:112:525:204:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:impact of stock price changes with world oil price changes. Over the longer term lag 
17:403:25161:27:28:112:526:177:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:period of 128 days and above, it is observed that there is a high correlation between 
17:404:25247:28:28:112:525:149:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  two  financial  variables,  implying  that  volatility  in  one  of  the  variables  is 
17:405:25340:28:27:112:525:121:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:transmitted  to  the  other  variable  by  a  lag  of  128  days.  Mere  understanding  of  the 
17:406:25436:27:0:112:526:94:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:correlations  does  not  answer  our  research  objectives  and  we  look  towards  phase 
18:407:25528:0:28:112:525:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:difference to figure out the lead lag relationship. During both the short lag and long 
18:408:25615:28:28:112:526:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:lag  high  coherence  phases,  it  is  observed  that  there  is  no  determinable  lead-lag 
18:409:25708:28:37:112:178:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:relationship.  
18:410:25722:37:28:112:526:666:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The  question  that  arises out  of  these  observations  is  why  these  unique observations 
18:411:25814:28:27:112:526:638:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:are not in-line with any past findings. In our humble understanding the past findings 
18:412:25900:27:28:112:525:611:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of  strong  correlation  between  oil  shocks  and  volatility  in  Saudi  Market  may  have 
18:413:25993:28:28:112:526:583:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:been  a  result  of  the  linearity  assumption.  In  the  economic  sense  the  authors  believe 
18:414:26091:28:27:112:525:555:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that since the Saudi market does not allow international investors to directly invest in 
18:415:26180:27:28:112:525:528:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:their  market  and  only  via  mutual  funds,  results  in  a  shielding  effect  from  global  oil 
18:416:26280:28:27:112:525:500:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:price  shocks.  Due  to  these  restrictions  the  investors  in  KSA  Stock  market  are 
18:417:26370:27:28:112:525:473:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:primarily local institutions and high net worth individuals, who do not take a volatile 
18:418:26458:28:28:112:525:445:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:entry  and  exit  approach  based  on  global  factors.  This  understanding  is  also  further 
18:419:26554:28:27:112:525:417:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reaffirmed,  by  relatively  thin trading  volumes  in  the  market  as  compared  to  other 
18:420:26647:27:38:112:209:390:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:developed markets. 
18:421:26665:38:37:112:157:352:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Bahrain 
18:422:26672:37:28:112:526:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:For  the  Bahraini  Stock  market  fluctuation  and  oil  price  volatility  coherence  plot 
18:423:26764:28:28:112:525:287:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:provides interesting insight, with the shortest lag it is observable slight traces of high 
18:424:26855:28:27:112:526:259:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:correlation  time  periods  and  during  2009-10  the  high  correlation  between  our  two 
18:425:26947:27:28:112:526:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:variables with a lag of 8 to 16 days. Over the long term lag, of 128 days as expected 
18:426:27033:28:27:112:525:204:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:there  is  a  high  correlation  between  the  two  variables.  Studying  the  Bahraini 
18:427:27121:27:28:112:526:177:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economy,  the  results  are  somewhat  in line,  as  Bahrain  is  a  service  based  economy, 
18:428:27215:28:28:112:526:149:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:with  negligible  reliance  on  hydrocarbon  exports. In  addition  to  this,  Bahraini  stock 
18:429:27309:28:27:112:525:121:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:market is relatively open to international investors, and has been trying hard over the 
18:430:27397:27:0:112:525:94:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:past decade to develop itself as the gateway to the Middle East for western investor. 
19:431:27485:0:28:112:525:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:With this structure of capital markets and economy, and oil price shocks are deemed 
19:432:27569:28:28:112:525:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:negative for the world economy are transmitted to the Bahraini economy, in the form 
19:433:27652:28:27:112:525:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of slowing down of services sector growth, and reduction in international investment 
19:434:27737:27:28:112:525:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:portfolios or transfer to safer securities. This understanding of the  authors is further 
19:435:27827:28:27:112:525:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reaffirmed  by  the  phase  difference,  which  points  towards  a  lead  lag  relationship 
19:436:27919:27:28:112:525:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:during  high  correlation  phases  for  oil  price  volatility  to  be  the  lead  variable.  This 
19:437:28018:28:28:112:525:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:helps us understand that any price volatility in oil markets would impact the Bahraini 
19:438:28105:28:27:112:526:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Stock Market with a short lag of 4 to 8 days but that effect dies out over that lag, but 
19:439:28194:27:38:112:470:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the long lasting impact of that can be observed over the long term period.  
19:440:28269:38:37:112:151:500:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Kuwait 
19:441:28275:37:28:112:525:463:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Kuwait is one of the largest oil producers in the region behind Saudi Arabia only. On 
19:442:28361:28:28:112:526:435:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  capital  markets  front,  it  has  recently  opened  up  to  attract  foreign  investors.  The 
19:443:28461:28:27:112:525:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:coherence  plot  between  Kuwait  stock  market  changes  and  oil  price  fluctuations, 
19:444:28550:27:28:112:525:380:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:shows  towards  rare  instances  of  correlation  in  the  shortest  time  lag  of  4  to  8  days, 
19:445:28650:28:27:112:525:352:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  but  scattered  high  correlation  during  the  high  oil  price  volatility  on  a  time  lag 
19:446:28750:27:28:112:525:325:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:scale of 6 to 10 day scale, with a long lag high correlation plot. On the investigation 
19:447:28838:28:28:112:525:297:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of the lead lag relationship there is no clear indication the short lag period with slight 
19:448:28929:28:27:112:526:269:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:traces  of  oil  being  the  leader  in  the  longer  lag  period.  This  observation  of  no  short 
19:449:29030:27:28:112:525:242:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:term lead lag relationship is understandable in the view of authors, since it has been 
19:450:29117:28:27:112:525:214:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:only the recent past when Kuwait opened up its  capital markets to foreign portfolio 
19:451:29202:27:28:112:526:187:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:manager who may be sensitive to global oil shocks. The long term effect of oil price 
19:452:29287:28:28:112:525:159:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:shocks  is  plausibly  transmitted  through  the  macroeconomic  channels  of  the  whole 
19:453:29377:28:27:112:525:131:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economy  readjusting  to  oil  price  shocks,  since  Kuwait  similar  to  Saudi  Arabia  is 
19:454:29470:27:0:112:275:104:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:heavily dependent on oil exports. 
20:455:29505:0:37:112:146:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Oman 
20:456:29509:37:28:112:525:721:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Oman  is  one  of  the  more  unique  economies  in  the  region,  which  has  over  the  last 
20:457:29604:28:27:112:525:693:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:decade  maintained  a  level  of  no  national  debt  with  reasonably  sized  sovereign  fund 
20:458:29699:27:28:112:526:666:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:having  exposures  globally.  Compared  to  its  counterparts  in  the  GCC,  the  oil 
20:459:29786:28:27:112:525:638:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:production  of  the  country  is  lesser  but  in  recent  years  it  has  discovered  much  oil 
20:460:29883:27:28:112:525:611:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reserves and proven oil wealth has drastically increased. Oman has been off the radar 
20:461:29969:28:28:112:526:583:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of  global  investors  in  terms  of  stock  markets,  and  this  is  further  reaffirmed  by  the 
20:462:30068:28:27:112:525:555:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:coherence  plot  for  oil  price  fluctuations  and  stock  market  volatility.  There  is 
20:463:30159:27:28:112:525:528:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:evidence of high  correlation between during the short lag period at paused intervals 
20:464:30245:28:27:112:526:500:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:during the 2007 -2009 oil price downslide. Also similar to our observation for other 
20:465:30330:27:28:112:525:473:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:countries there is a high correlation over a longer lag with traces of high correlation 
20:466:30418:28:28:112:525:445:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:periods  in  medium  term  lag.  But  with  all  these  correlation  patterns,  the  phase 
20:467:30509:28:27:112:525:417:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:difference analysis, returns random results, with lead lag relation switching between 
20:468:30595:27:28:112:525:390:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  two  variables  in  short  term,  and  in  long  term  no  clear  direction  of  lead  lag 
20:469:30691:28:27:112:525:362:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:relationship. This leads us to make a careful inference that the oil price shocks do not 
20:470:30780:27:28:112:526:335:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:have an existing relationship to the stock market volatility in Oman, which is rational 
20:471:30868:28:38:112:403:307:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in our opinion, owing to low base of international investors. 
20:472:30929:38:37:112:144:269:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Qatar 
20:473:30934:37:28:112:525:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Qatar economy has seen a dramatic growth in the past decade backed by oil and gas 
20:474:31016:28:27:112:525:204:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:export revenues. Qatar is slated in the top 3 countries according to GDP  per  capita, 
20:475:31103:27:28:112:526:177:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:but  a  highly  dependent  economy  on  hydrocarbon.  Oil  and  gas  account  for nearly 
20:476:31191:28:28:112:526:149:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:50% of GDP translated into around 85% of export earnings and 70% of government 
20:477:31268:28:27:112:526:121:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:revenues.  With  this  preview  of  the  economy,  the  understanding  of  the  CWT 
20:478:31352:27:0:112:526:94:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:coherence  plot  for  the  Qatar  Stock  market  fluctuations  and  oil  price  volatility  is 
21:479:31449:0:28:112:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:further   clarified. The   coherence   plot   indicates   towards   non-existence   of   high 
21:480:31543:28:28:112:525:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:correlation  areas  in  the  lag  period  of  upto  4  days.  There  are  slight  traces  of  high 
21:481:31642:28:27:112:526:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:correlation in 4-10 days lag during March and April 2009 oil price volatility era. The 
21:482:31728:27:28:112:525:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:phase difference points towards a relationship of Oil volatility positively leading the 
21:483:31816:28:27:112:525:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:stock  market  volatility.  This  same  oil  price  shock  is  transmitted  over  longer  lags  as 
21:484:31915:27:28:112:526:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:well with the same lead lag relationship.2009 onwards we observe a high correlation 
21:485:31999:28:28:112:525:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:phases  coinciding  with  sudden  oil  price  movements,  but  its  observable  that  the 
21:486:32089:28:27:112:525:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:impact  is  after  a  lag  of  roughly  4  days.  The  observations  of  the  author  at  first  are 
21:487:32190:27:28:112:526:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:spurious,  but  then  the  effect  of  contagion  being  observed  from  2009  onwards  is 
21:488:32281:28:27:112:525:510:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:C:intuitively  understandable,  since  Qatar’s  Stock  Exchange  has  shown  tremendous 
21:489:32367:27:28:112:525:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:growth from 2008 onwards, backed by opening up of business and investment sector 
21:490:32448:28:28:112:526:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to international investors. In the longer lag period the correlation is as expected high, 
21:491:32538:28:38:112:457:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:owing to the heavy reliance of the economy on the hydrocarbon sector. 
21:492:32607:38:37:112:224:389:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:United Arab Emirates 
21:493:32627:37:27:112:525:352:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:United  Arab  Emirates  is  one  of  the  modern  day  examples  of  hydrocarbon  growth 
21:494:32716:27:28:112:525:325:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:based  transformations.  In  the  past  3  decades,  UAE  has  transformed  itself  from  an 
21:495:32809:28:28:112:525:297:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:impoverished  desert  state  one  of  the  most  economically  stable  state  in  the  Middle 
21:496:32903:28:27:112:525:269:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:East.    Over  the  past  decades,  UAE  has  successfully  liberalized  and  transformed  it 
21:497:32997:27:28:112:525:242:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economy  to  reduce  dependence  on  hydrocarbon  sector.  Merely  25%  of  the  GDP  is 
21:498:33086:28:27:112:525:214:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:B:based on oil and gas according to recent estimates. UAE’s Economy although reliant 
21:499:33169:27:28:112:525:187:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:on oil to only one fourth of the GDP was hard hit in the recent oil price crash of 2008 
21:500:33257:28:28:112:525:159:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:which  coincided  with  the  world  economic  slowdown.  Out  of  the  7  member  states, 
21:501:33347:28:27:112:526:131:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Dubai  was  the  worst  hit,  an  economy  primarily  based  on  services  industry  suffered 
21:502:33441:27:28:112:525:104:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:drastically  reaching  a  near  sovereign  default  state  before  being  bailed  out  by 
21:503:33531:28:0:112:347:76:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:neighboring state of Abu Dhabi, a part of UAE.  
22:504:33580:0:28:112:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Keeping  in  mind  these  realities,  the  coherence  plot  of  Oil  price  volatility  and  the 
22:505:33677:28:28:112:525:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:stock price shows traces of high correlations over short lag period 0 to 8 days, during 
22:506:33765:28:27:112:525:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:late  2009  and  early  2010.  But  the  phase  difference  provides  a  set  of  indefinite 
22:507:33858:27:28:112:525:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:pattern,  implying  that  in  short  lag  periods,  stock  market  volatility  lead  the  oil  price 
22:508:33959:28:27:112:525:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:volatility. Intuitively this does not seem a valid relationship. Over a longer lag period 
22:509:34049:27:28:112:525:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of  128  days  and  more,  our  results  provide  interesting  insights  with  the  oil  price 
22:510:34144:28:28:112:525:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:volatility  having  a  high  positive  correlations  and  a  leading  relationship  with  stock 
22:511:34240:28:38:112:198:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:market volatility.

24:515:34370:38:37:112:192:693:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:VI. Conclusion 
24:516:34384:37:28:112:525:656:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: Oil  Price  volatility  and  local  stock  markets  in  GCC  has  been  an  area  of  much 
24:517:34475:28:27:112:525:628:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:interest  to  many  research  works,  mainly  due  to  such  critical  role  of  hydrocarbon 
24:518:34568:27:28:112:525:601:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:sector  in  the  economies  of  these  nations.  Our  findings  provide  an  interesting  and 
24:519:34662:28:28:112:526:573:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:unique  perspective,  and  lead  us  to  make  cautious  deductions,  that  being  heavily 
24:520:34753:28:27:112:525:545:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reliant on one commodity for a country does not expose its stock markets blindly to 
24:521:34837:27:38:112:349:518:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:price shocks of that commodity, in our case Oil.  
24:522:34886:38:27:112:526:480:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Our  findings  provide  a  better  insight  for  international  portfolio  managers  and 
24:523:34975:27:28:112:525:453:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:sovereign  funds  in  the  form  of  an  understanding  of  which  markets  in  GCC  are 
24:524:35064:28:28:112:526:425:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:impacted by Oil Price Shocks and by how much lag. This comprehension of lead-lag 
24:525:35145:28:27:112:526:397:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:relationship is of utmost importance to every portfolio manager, for timing his entry 
24:526:35231:27:38:112:390:370:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and exit between exposures in markets and asset classes.  
24:527:35288:38:37:112:482:332:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Our research questions which were laid out laid out in the first section were: 
24:528:35366:37:28:130:525:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:3) Is there any coherence between oil price shocks and stock market fluctuations 
24:529:35446:28:28:148:264:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:in short and long-term? 
24:530:35469:28:37:130:509:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:4) If there exists coherence, what is the lag and direction of this relationship? 
24:531:35548:37:28:112:525:202:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Our  findings  are  concluded  and  summarized  country  by  country  in  reference  to  our 
24:532:35641:28:38:112:269:174:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:research objective is as follows: 
24:533:35674:38:28:130:526:136:12:g_d0_f17:12:Times New Roman:A: Kingdom  of  Saudi  Arabia: In  case  of  an  oil  price  shock,  there  is  no 
24:534:35754:28:27:148:525:108:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:determinable  impact  on  the  investments  in  the  Saudi  Stock  Market  in  the 
24:535:35837:27:0:148:304:81:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:short and the longer lag period.  
25:536:35872:0:28:130:526:758:12:g_d0_f17:12:Times New Roman:A: Bahrain: Any Oil price shock would be transmitted to Bahrain Stock market 
25:537:35946:28:27:148:526:730:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:with  a  lag  of  8  to  16  days,  and then  dies  out,  but  leaves  traces  of  long  term 
25:538:36040:27:29:148:325:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:impact in a lag period of 128+ days. 
25:539:36076:29:27:130:525:674:12:g_d0_f17:12:Times New Roman:A: Kuwait: Similar  to  KSA,  there  exists  no  lead  lag  relationship  between  oil 
25:540:36161:27:28:148:525:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:price and stock market, but an oil price shock has impact on the stock market 
25:541:36239:28:28:148:525:619:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:in  longer  time  periods.  This  lead  lag  relationship  is  plausibly  owing  to  the 
25:542:36328:28:27:148:525:591:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:impact of oil price changes on the macroeconomic variables in Kuwait which 
25:543:36403:27:29:148:329:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:leads to impact on the Stock market.  
25:544:36440:29:27:130:525:535:12:g_d0_f17:12:Times New Roman:A: Oman: According   to   our   findings,   although   there   are   traces   of   high 
25:545:36526:27:28:148:525:508:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:correlation  between oil  price  and  stock  market  volatilities  in  medium  term, 
25:546:36611:28:28:148:525:480:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:but  no  definitive  lead  relationship  could  be  deduced.  This  implies  that  oil 
25:547:36698:28:28:148:404:452:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:price shocks do not impact the local stock market.    
25:548:36750:28:28:130:526:424:12:g_d0_f17:12:Times New Roman:A: Qatar: Post 2009, once the Qatar economy has started opening up to foreign 
25:549:36826:28:27:148:525:396:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:investors,  there  are  signs  of  a  lead  lag  relationship  between  oil  price  shocks 
25:550:36917:27:28:148:525:369:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:being  transmitted  to  the  Oil  stock  market,  with  a  positive  correlation  with  a 
25:551:37007:28:27:148:526:341:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:lag  of  in  4-10.  There  are  also  strong  signs  of  long  term  impact  of  oil  price 
25:552:37099:27:29:148:227:314:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:shocks as well.  
25:553:37115:29:28:130:526:285:12:g_d0_f17:12:Times New Roman:A: United  Arab  Emirates: Oil  Price  Shocks do  not  have  a  definite  lead  lag 
25:554:37196:28:27:148:525:257:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:relationship  with  the  local  stock  market,  although  they  show  traces  of  high 
25:555:37283:27:28:148:525:230:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:correlation.  But  oil  prices  shocks  tend  to  have  a  high  correlation  with  the 
25:556:37371:28:27:148:525:202:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:local  stock  market  with  a  leading role  over  a  lag  period  of  128  days  and 
25:557:37456:27:38:148:179:175:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:more.
