2:19:605:30:21:72:543:473:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:In  the  face  of  sluggish  economic  growth,  debilitating  triangle  of  unemployment,  poverty  and 
2:20:709:21:20:72:543:452:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman:B:inequality the South African policy makers are at their wit’s end. Recognisably,  most  stake 
2:21:803:20:21:72:542:432:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:C:holders are evoking the need to forge a ‘Social Compact/  dialogue’ if South Africa will make 
2:22:897:21:21:72:543:411:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:significant  strides  in  solving  its  problems.  The  latest  contested  policy  framework,  the  National 
2:23:1006:21:21:72:543:390:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Development  Plan (2012),  also  revoke  the  need for “A  social  compact  to  reduce  poverty  and 
2:24:1106:21:20:72:543:369:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:C:inequality, and raise employment and investment.” Ireland provides some lessons for the needed 
2:25:1201:20:21:72:543:349:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:social compacts in South Africa since it managed to pursue the route of policy negotiations when 
2:26:1298:21:21:72:542:328:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:it was hit by an economic crisis in 1987. The Irish compacts were without problems and there is 
2:27:1393:21:20:72:543:307:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:no  consensus  as  to  the  real  effects  of  the  social  compacts  implemented  in  Ireland.  This  paper 
2:28:1502:20:21:72:542:287:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:argues  that  Social  compacts  in  South  Africa  are  a  possibility  albert  with  huge  challenges  to  be 
2:29:1613:21:31:72:487:266:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:overcome before they can be achieved and the Irish case illuminates such challenges.

3:37:1866:0:30:252:344:708:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: 3.1 Introduction  
3:38:1883:30:14:108:543:678:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:In general there are two possible scenarios: a) the crisis provides an external stimulus for 
3:39:1976:14:14:108:542:664:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:partners  to  come  closer  together,  as  partners share  the  understanding  that  only  by  close 
3:40:2077:14:13:108:543:650:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:collaboration  will  they  find  solutions  for  their  communities  to  weather  the  storm;  or  b) 
3:41:2179:13:14:108:543:637:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:the  crisis  makes  the  existing  and  unresolved  differences  between  partners  visible, 
3:42:2272:14:14:108:543:623:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:resulting in more complicated discussions, and difficulties in reaching agreements on new 
3:43:2362:14:24:108:249:609:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:priorities (OECD, 2010:05).  
3:44:2390:24:21:72:543:585:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The above quote in some way  explains well the  paradox of social partnership in  Ireland.  Faced 
3:45:2488:21:20:72:542:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:with  a  deep  economic  crisis  in  the  early  1980s,  there  was  an  advent  of  a  series  of  social 
3:46:2595:20:21:72:543:544:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:partnerships  starting  in  1987  and  many  writers  and  Irish  people  in  general  believe  that  these 
3:47:2703:21:21:72:543:523:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:social  partnerships  played  a  great  role  in  what  has  become  to  be  known  as  the Celtic  Tiger 
3:48:2808:21:21:72:543:502:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:C:(Baccaro  and  Simoni,  2004;  O’Donnel 2001).  What  baffles  one’s  mind  however  is  the 
3:49:2900:21:20:72:543:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:dissolution of social partnerships twenty years later in the face of the 2007 economic crisis when 
3:50:2999:20:21:72:543:461:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:many believed the Irish economy had built an institutionalised platform to deliberatively weather 
3:51:3097:21:31:72:345:440:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the crisis (Murphy, 2012; Donaghey and Teague, 2007). 
3:52:3150:31:20:72:543:409:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:There  are  great  complementary  views  about  the  social  partnership  in  Ireland  with  one  camp 
3:53:3253:20:21:72:543:389:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:arguing  that  the  Irish  partnerships  were  very  crucial  in  the  economic  turnaround  of  Ireland 
3:54:3358:21:21:72:542:368:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f11:B:(McGuinness et  al,  2008;  Walsh, 2003). O’Reardon and O’Donnell (2002), for instance argued 
3:55:3452:21:20:72:543:347:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that the country not only escaped from the profound economic, social  and political crisis of the 
3:56:3550:20:21:72:543:327:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:1980s,   but   considerably   addressed   its   long-term   developmental   problems   of   emigration, 
3:57:3654:21:21:72:543:306:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:unemployment, trade deficits and weak indigenous business development. Hardiman (2002) also 
3:58:3746:21:20:72:543:285:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:argued   that   the   adversarial   industrial   relations   were   significantly   reduced   through   social 
3:59:3857:20:21:72:543:265:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:partnerships.   Teague    and   Donaghey   (2009)   also   contended   that   partnerships    greatly 
3:60:3959:21:21:72:543:244:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:complemented the extreme openness of the Irish economy to the Euro-global economy. With its 
3:61:4051:21:21:72:543:223:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:openness,  the  Irish  economy  benefitted  from  influx  of  MNCs  from  abroad  (especially  US) 
3:62:4150:21:20:72:542:202:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:because  of  the  benign  tax  regime  and  a  lax  pro-voluntarism  approach  in  industrial relations 
3:63:4254:20:21:72:543:182:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:C:introduced through social partnerships (D’Art and Turnner, 2003; Dorgan, 2006).   The other 
3:64:4346:21:21:72:543:161:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:camp in contrast is quite critical and view Irish partnerships with contempt especially on muting 
3:65:4444:21:20:72:542:140:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the equalitarian and egalitarian principles which would have made the Irish people benefit from 
3:66:4540:20:21:72:543:120:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Celtic  Tiger boom  (Allen,  1999  &  2000).  According  to  Kirby  and  Murphy  (2011:01), “There 
3:67:4639:21:0:72:543:99:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:was a prioritisation of economic competitiveness over those of social cohesion and welfare hence 
4:68:4735:0:21:72:542:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Ireland only became an exemplar of how globalisation resituates the state so that it prioritises the 
4:69:4835:21:31:72:341:688:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman:B:needs of global capital over those of its own citizens”.   
4:70:4893:31:21:72:542:657:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The greatest victim of Irish partnership as the critics argue ware trade unions as McDonough and 
4:71:4990:21:20:72:542:636:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f11:B:Dundon  (2010)  argued  that  the political economy of Ireland reflected a ‘delayed Thatcherism’. 
4:72:5088:20:21:72:543:616:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:C:D’Art and Turner (2011:168) also argued that for Irish unions, partnership may well have turned 
4:73:5184:21:21:72:543:595:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:C:out to be a ‘Faustian bargain’. With globalisation undermining solidaristic national contracts, 
4:74:5280:21:20:72:543:574:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:liberalization,  deregulation,  and  privatization  have  not  reduced  the  role  of  state  intervention 
4:75:5387:20:21:72:543:554:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:C:overall but it just shifted it from “decommodifying bureaucracies to marketizing ones” (Murphy 
4:76:5482:21:21:72:543:533:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  Kirby,  2011:  07).The  critics  also  emphasise  the  role  of  MNCs and  EU  membership  (for 
4:77:5583:21:20:72:543:512:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:markets  access)  in  the  Celtic  Tiger  boom  hence  downplaying  the  role  of  social  partnership 
4:78:5686:20:31:72:239:492:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman:B:(Dorgan 2006; O’Donnell, 2001).  
4:79:5718:31:21:72:543:461:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Polarising the debate and the prognosis of social partnership as reflected above or as espoused in 
4:80:5817:21:21:72:542:440:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f11:B:Teague and Donaghey’s (2009) argument of whether Ireland is ‘closer’ to Boston or Berlin , will 
4:81:5913:21:20:72:543:419:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:C:only limit one’s understanding of Irish partnership. As a result, concluding that Ireland is either a 
4:82:6015:20:21:72:542:399:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:liberal  or  co-ordinated  economy  may  not  be  enough  because  it  has  to  some  extent    elements  of 
4:83:6124:21:21:72:543:378:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman:B:both models or at least more of either as Watkins (2012) argued “Corporatism is an  antidote to 
4:84:6220:21:20:72:542:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the twin dangers of the egalitarianism of the French Revolution and the laissez faire economics 
4:85:6315:20:31:72:160:337:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of Adam Smith”.  
4:86:6331:31:21:72:542:306:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:This  section  will  proceed  as  follows:  A  detailed  historical  background  of  the  Irish  experience 
4:87:6439:21:20:72:543:285:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:with  partnerships  and  corporatism,  as  policy  making  processes,  will  be  given;  the  next  section 
4:88:6547:20:21:72:542:265:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:will  look  into  what  positive  role  the  partnership  played  in  the  Celtic  tiger  boom;  the  fourth 
4:89:6656:21:21:72:543:244:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:section will critically consider the downside of the partnerships as observed in Ireland; the fifth 
4:90:6756:21:21:72:543:223:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:section  will  be  the  concluding  remarks  and  a  brief  look  into  recent  proposals  for  the  Irish 
4:91:6863:21:31:72:139:202:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:partnerships.  
4:92:6877:31:30:108:476:171:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:3.2 Irish Social Partnership through the lens of European Corporatism  
4:93:6947:30:14:108:543:141:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The army of corporatists is so disparate that one is led to think that the word, corporation, 
4:94:7041:14:0:108:543:127:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:itself is like a label placed on a whole batch of bottles which are then distributed among 
5:95:7132:0:14:108:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:diverse  producers  each  of  whom  fills  them  with  the  drink  of  his  choice.  The  consumer 
5:96:7231:14:24:108:322:695:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:has to look carefully (Schimitter, 1974: 87)2 
5:97:7276:24:14:108:543:671:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:There  are  among  corporatist  theorists,  not  unimportant  differences  as  to  how  they  view 
5:98:7375:14:13:108:543:657:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:the  concept  and  what  they  regard  as  central  elements  of  the  theory  because  it  covers 
5:99:7474:13:14:108:543:644:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:complex  and  wide  ranging  issues  and  it  is  not  unfair  to  say  that  it  is  a  relatively 
5:100:7574:14:24:108:451:630:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:inaccessible body of political and social theory (Williamson, 1989: 04) 
5:101:7645:24:21:72:543:606:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:With the term used loosely and without unanimity, there is however a general consensus among 
5:102:7738:21:21:72:543:585:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:many authors that it refers to the idea of organising the economy into major interest groups, the 
5:103:7836:21:20:72:543:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:representatives  of  which  settle  any  problem  through  negotiation  and  joint  agreement  (Baccaro, 
5:104:7941:20:21:72:542:544:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2003;  Siaroff,  1999; Watkins,  2012; Calmfors  &  Driffill,  1988:  24).  Cawson  (1982:  41)  argued 
5:105:8045:21:21:72:543:523:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that  the  broadest  meaning  of  corporatism  is  a  pattern  of  articulation  between  the  state  and 
5:106:8151:21:21:72:543:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:functional   interests   in   civil   society   which   fuses   representation   and   intervention   in   an 
5:107:8261:21:20:72:543:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:interdependent relationship.  A distinction is made also of the use of the word corporatism as (a) 
5:108:8360:20:21:72:543:461:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:a  system  of  interest  representation  where  corporatism  is  practised  sporadically  and  (b)  more 
5:109:8465:21:31:72:538:440:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:often as an institutionalised pattern of policy formation (Lehmbruch, 1979; Woldendorp, 2011).  
5:110:8560:31:20:72:542:409:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Major  features  of  stable  corporatism  thus  include  co-ordination,  co-operative  mechanisms  and 
5:111:8663:20:21:72:543:389:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:systemic management of the economy by the state, unions (centralised) and employers (Siaroff, 
5:112:8757:21:21:72:542:368:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:1999; Bartolomeo, et al 2005; Baccaro and Fraile, 2010). The above features of corporatism are

5:114:8959:20:21:72:543:327:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:argue that that the European model of concerted regulation of the economy has been called many

5:117:9229:30:21:72:542:255:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Recently, neo-corporatism is often used rather than corporatism to capture changes in the global 
5:118:9326:21:21:72:542:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economic  conditions  especially  economic  threats  of  recession  and  inflation  (Williamson,  1989;

6:130:10247:30:21:72:542:596:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: Conceptually,  northern  European  corporatist  experiments  can be  seen  in  retrospect  as  early 
6:131:10348:21:21:72:543:575:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:forms of innovative governance, which in turn have influenced the emergence of the Irish social 
6:132:10444:21:20:72:543:554:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:partnership  (McGrath  and  House,  2004).  Paradoxically,  the  widely  attributed  success  of  social 
6:133:10549:20:21:72:543:534:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:partnership in enhancing the performance of the Irish economy in the 1990s,  contrasts with the 
6:134:10645:21:21:72:543:513:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:equally  widely  attributed  failure  of  centralized  tripartite  pay  bargaining  in  Ireland  during  the 
6:135:10754:21:20:72:543:492:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:1970  (Murphy,  2012;  Roche  2007).  The  first  concerted  period  of  nationalized  tripartite  wage 
6:136:10858:20:21:72:542:472:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:bargaining  started  in  1970  and  lasted  until  1981  (Teague  and  Donaghey,  2007).  As  widely 
6:137:10959:21:21:72:543:451:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:acknowledged,  this  period  was  characterised  by  rising  inflation  and  falling  employment  (oil 
6:138:11062:21:21:72:543:430:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:crisis  of  1970  &  1979)  when  centralized  income  policies  were  aimed  at  moderating  wage 
6:139:11161:21:30:72:394:409:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:increases (McGrath and House, 2004; Roche, 2007; Walsh, 2003). 
6:140:11223:30:21:72:543:379:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:An  important  fact  worth  highlighting  is  that  by  mid  1950s  economic  nationalism  was  not 
6:141:11323:21:21:72:543:358:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:sustainable and radical policy changes were introduced causing the previous protectionism to be 
6:142:11419:21:20:72:543:337:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:abandoned  in  favour  of  openness  (Dorgan,  2006). Ireland  joined  the  European  Economic

6:144:11606:21:21:72:542:296:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:arrival  on  the  global  economic  arena  and  by  1975,  more  than  450  foreign-owned  industrial 
6:145:11707:21:20:72:543:275:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f11:B:projects,  covering  a  wide  range  of  manufacturing  sectors,  accounted  for  two-thirds of Ireland’s 
6:146:11813:20:21:72:543:255:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:total industrial output (White , 2011) Such extreme openness and other hegemonic EU-global pro 
6:147:11908:21:21:72:542:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:market policies turned Ireland towards becoming a liberal market economy (Murphy, 2012; Finn, 
6:148:12002:21:21:72:543:213:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2011, Walsh, 2003). Dorgan (2006) also noted that Ireland had become a champion in openness 
6:149:12094:21:30:72:250:192:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in the early years of the 21st century:

6:152:12330:14:14:108:543:134:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:and  commented  that  it  has  the  highest  degree  of  economic  integration  among  the 
6:153:12421:14:24:108:313:120:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:developed economies (Dorgan, 2006: 02).

6:155:12566:20:0:72:543:76:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:with  the  Economist  Intelligence  Unit  (EIU)  as  they  ranked  Ireland  the  second  in  globalisation 
7:156:12673:0:21:72:543:709:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman:B:after  Hong  Kong  (Finfacts,  2010).  D’Art  and  Turner  (2011:159)  also  argued  that  social 
7:157:12771:21:21:72:543:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:partnership  in  Ireland  happened  to  coexist  with  true  neoliberal  policies  such  as  cutting  social 
7:158:12880:21:20:72:543:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:spending, taxes, reducing regulation of labour and financial markets, eliminating barriers to free 
7:159:12979:20:31:72:259:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:trade, and privatising state companies. 
7:160:13018:31:21:72:542:616:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f11:B:The  openness of the Irish economy has led to its inclusion in the puzzle of ‘unlikely’ countries

7:162:13224:21:20:72:543:574:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the   political   system   (centre   right   ruling   Fiana   Fail   government)   inconsistent   with   those 
7:163:13335:20:21:72:542:554:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:classically thought to have provided the necessary preconditions for neo-corporatist concertation

7:165:13529:21:20:72:542:512:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f11:B:economic institutions even led to serious doubts about the ‘agenda’ of  Irish social partnership in

7:167:13694:31:21:72:543:461:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:As  noted  by  Hardiman  (2002),  social  partnership  in  the  Irish  context  refers  to  the  processes  of 
7:168:13805:21:21:72:542:440:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:consultation  between  government  and  principal  organisations  representing  employers,  trade 
7:169:13903:21:20:72:543:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:unions  and  farmers.  It  is  also  important  to  note  that  other  groups  like  the  community  and 
7:170:14008:20:21:72:543:399:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:voluntary sector became involved in the partnership process especially after seeing the success of

7:172:14210:21:20:72:543:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Irish  social  partnership  departs  from  traditional  corporatism,  as  it  goes  beyond  trade  union  and

7:184:15135:21:20:72:542:113:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(1997) who argued that besides the triumph of the Celtic tiger in the late 90s, the Irish economy

8:186:15342:0:21:72:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:sorts of names; economic quagmire, sick man of Europe, Irish Hare and the poorest of the rich,

8:188:15539:21:20:72:543:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2002). This was the period of instability in policy; national tripartite wage negotiation was tried 
8:189:15639:20:21:72:543:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in 70s and was abandoned in 1981 in favour of sector and firm level bargaining; it was a period 
8:190:15735:21:21:72:543:626:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f11:B:of political instability and adversarial industrial relations (LRC, 2000; Murphy, 2012; O’Grada,

8:195:16137:21:20:72:542:512:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Murphy  (2012)  also  contended  that  the  post colonial  political  institutions  and  culture  was

8:200:16626:20:21:72:542:399:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman:B:weaknesses were harshly exposed (O’Donnell, 1998). Public  debt  was  close  to  120%  of  GDP

10:247:20005:21:20:72:541:440:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:partnerships make it difficult to attribute the success of the Irish economy during the Celtic Tiger

10:249:20200:21:31:72:382:399:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:partnerships to the Irish economy as shared by many observers.

10:252:20343:30:14:108:542:307:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Economic performance over the past fifteen  years has been nothing short of spectacular. 
10:253:20432:14:14:108:542:293:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Clearly it would be misleading to say that social partnership produced the so-called Celtic 
10:254:20524:14:24:108:461:279:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Tiger, but it was a contributing factor (Donaghey and Teague, 2007: 39). 
10:255:20596:24:20:72:543:255:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:A  general  consensus  exists  amongst  various  authors  interested  in  Irish  partnership  that  the 
10:256:20700:20:21:72:543:235:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:prognosis  of  Irish  partnerships  is  at  best  mixed  (Macdonough  and  Dundon,  2010).  Murphy 
10:257:20799:21:21:72:543:214:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(2012)  argued  that  various  observers  offer  subjective  evaluations  with  differing  views  on 
10:258:20900:21:20:72:543:193:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:weighing  the  contribution  of  social  partnership  to  the  Irish  economy.  It  is  interesting  that  the 
10:259:21011:20:21:72:543:173:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:social  partnerships  are  viewed  as  magic  bullets  even  by  Irish  people  in  general.  For  instance  in 
10:260:21122:21:21:72:543:152:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f11:B:1999,  78  percent  of  poll  respondents  agreed  that  social  partnership was important for Ireland’s 
10:261:21227:21:21:72:543:131:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economic success (Baccaro and Simoni, 2004). Regardless of the recent  collapse of  Irish social 
10:262:21323:21:20:72:543:110:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:partnerships  as  a  policy  making  process,  it  is  important  to  explore  the  reason  why  the 
10:263:21424:20:0:72:353:90:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:partnerships have been highly esteemed in Irish economy.

11:265:21507:30:14:108:543:678:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The  main  impact  of  partnership  lay  in  improved  industrial  relations,  which  significantly 
11:266:21607:14:14:108:543:664:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:enhanced  economic  performance,  and  the  fact  that  `the  partnership  approach  has  also 
11:267:21702:14:14:108:542:650:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:contributed  to  a  more  coherent  approach to  economic  policy  making'  (FitzGerald,  2000:

11:271:22005:21:20:72:542:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:nature of Irish partnerships, the Irish economy as a whole has benefited, ever since the advent of

11:274:22302:21:21:72:542:509:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:1970s  saw  a  disarray  in  Irish  industrial  relations  with  recurrent  unofficial  disputes,  inter-union

12:300:22940:31:21:72:542:526:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The  trend  depicted  above  by  the  incidence  of strikes  shows  that  bulk  part  of  the  1990s  saw  the 
12:301:23051:21:21:72:543:505:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:stable  low  incidence  of  strikes  of  which  partnerships  might  have  assisted  significantly.  From 
12:302:23157:21:20:72:543:484:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:1984  to  1987  there  was  a  downward  trend  in  the  incidence  of  strikes  and  by  virtue  of  the  Irish 
12:303:23270:20:21:72:542:464:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:partnerships  taking  a  problem  solving  approach  (early  pacts),  it  is  plausible  that  partnerships 
12:304:23378:21:21:72:543:443:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:helped to reduce industrial conflicts.  Another important issue noted by MacPartlin (2002) is that 
12:305:23477:21:20:72:543:422:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:a series of mergers reduced the number of unions from 86 in 1981, to 48 in 2001, and the trend is 
12:306:23575:20:21:72:540:402:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:still  towards  smaller  unions  being  subsumed  into  the  larger  ones.  This  also  meant  that  inter -
12:307:23683:21:31:72:484:381:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:union disputes were minimised hence contributing to reduction of strikes in long run.

12:310:23787:30:21:72:543:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Unemployment  remained  stubbornly  high  in  the  early  years  of  social  partnerships  to  the  extent 
12:311:23894:21:20:72:543:268:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that many were worried by such a jobless growth (McGrath and House, 2004). As clearly shown 
12:312:23986:20:21:72:543:248:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in (fig 3.2), about ten years (1987-1997) into social partnerships, unemployment was invincible. 
12:313:24083:21:21:72:543:227:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:C:Baccaro and Simoni, 2004; O’Donnel, 2001) also noted that the early 1990s were difficult years 
12:314:24178:21:21:72:543:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:for  Ireland  as  growth  subsided  and  unemployment  began  to  grow  again.  Social  partnership 
12:315:24278:21:20:72:543:185:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:however,  managed  to  overcome  this  cyclical  contraction  (Baccaro,  2002).  Centralised  wage 
12:316:24377:20:21:72:543:165:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:bargaining  in  1987  played  an  important  role  in  eliminating  industrial  disputes  and  moderating 
12:317:24483:21:21:72:543:144:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:real   wage   growth   and   also   deserves   much   of   the   credit   for   the   exceptional   decline   in 
12:318:24596:21:20:72:543:123:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:unemployment  in  the  late  1990s.  As shown  in  (fig  3.2);  unemployment  declined  from  about 
12:319:24695:20:21:72:543:103:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:17.5% in 1987 to 13% in 1990 but rose significantly to about 15.5 % in 1993 signifying the crisis

13:336:24949:30:21:72:542:437:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:As  discussed  in  the  previous  section,  decline  in  industrial  disputes  also  brought  confidence  to 
13:337:25058:21:21:72:543:416:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:potential  employers  hence  social  partnerships  also  contributed  indirectly  to  the  reduction  in 
13:338:25163:21:20:72:543:395:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:unemployment. Partly contributing to the decline of unemployment was the establishment of the 
13:339:25257:20:21:72:543:375:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:C:EU single market in 1992 .This establishment was welcomed by Irish’s generous tax regime and 
13:340:25350:21:21:72:543:354:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Ireland became a tax haven for US or global companies who wanted to escape tax rates of 35% 
13:341:25442:21:20:72:543:333:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:or  more  in  the  US  or  EU(Allen,  2009;  Silke, 2009).  The  social  partnerships  had  also  indirectly 
13:342:25551:20:21:72:543:313:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:made  potential  employers  to  consider  investing  in  Ireland  due  to  moderated  wages  hence 
13:343:25650:21:31:72:294:292:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reducing the unemployment in the late 1990s.

13:345:25743:30:14:108:543:231:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:For  the  best  part  of  forty  years,  successive  Irish  Governments,  irrespective  of  political 
13:346:25845:14:14:108:543:217:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:hue, have followed a policy of promoting unbridled economic openness and perhaps the 
13:347:25930:14:14:108:542:203:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:most  decisive  contribution  the  national  social  agreements  have  made  is  complementing 
13:348:26025:14:24:108:468:189:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:the extreme openness of the Irish economy (Teague and Donaghey, 2009). 
13:349:26095:24:21:72:543:165:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Through  social  partnership,  Ireland  managed  to  create  complementing  institutional  structures 
13:350:26197:21:20:72:543:144:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:like  openness  and  low  tax  regime  that  attracted  MNCs.  In  section  3  of  PNR  in  1987  it  was 
13:351:26302:20:21:72:543:124:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:specifically  stated  that  corporate  tax  reduction  was  important  to  incentivise  investment  see 
13:352:26406:21:21:72:543:103:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(Appendix 3) (PNR, 1987:11). Walsh (2003) for instance argued that the buoyancy of the global 
13:353:26500:21:0:72:543:82:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economy  spilled  over  to  Ireland  through  the  increased  flow  of  FDI  from  the  US,  as  well  as

14:360:26766:0:21:72:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:through  strong  demand  in  exports  markets  in  Britain,  Europe,  and  the  US.  By  presenting  a  low 
14:361:26874:21:21:72:543:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:corporation tax regime to manufacturing companies abroad, the Irish economy was well situated 
14:362:26968:21:20:72:542:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to benefit from these positive external developments thus the inflow of FDI to Ireland tends to be 
14:363:27067:20:21:72:543:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:given much of the credit for the boom.  In 1998 MNCs accounted for 72  % of  gross output and 
14:364:27160:21:21:72:543:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:between  1985  and  1998  and  MNCs  also  performed  much  better  than  their  local  counterparts

14:366:27365:21:20:72:543:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:investment in accounting for the Celtic Tiger’s remarkable boom but social partnerships created

14:370:27629:30:14:108:543:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The  early  programs  were  focused  on  managing  acute  economic  and  social  crisis  and 
14:371:27722:14:14:108:543:468:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:promoting  economic  recovery.  Priority  then  shifted  around  the  middle  of  the  1990s  to 
14:372:27819:14:14:108:542:454:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:satisfying   the   criteria   for   entry   to   European   Monetary   Union   (EMU),   promoting 
14:373:27917:14:26:108:527:440:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:competitiveness and reducing the still high level of unemployment (Roche, 2007:399). 
14:374:28001:26:20:72:543:414:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:C:Ireland’s entry into the EMU is believed to have played a very subtle role by critics who argue 
14:375:28097:20:21:72:542:394:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that it led policy makers into a false sense of security and an irrational exuberance (Roche, 2007; 
14:376:28196:21:21:72:543:373:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Honohan, 2009; Reagan, 2011). On the contrary others also argued that for small open peripheral 
14:377:28292:21:20:72:542:352:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:countries like Ireland, defying Euro-globalisation would mean disaster hence the only option was 
14:378:28389:20:21:72:542:332:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:C:to be “neoliberal or neo- idiotic” (Chang, 2007:27; The Economist, 2011). It is fair to argue that 
14:379:28487:21:21:72:543:311:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the entry into EMU caused the social partnership process to be altered towards austerity implicit 
14:380:28585:21:33:72:504:290:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:design of EMU (Reagan, 2011), but the benefits of entering the union can be highlighted. 
14:381:28673:33:20:72:543:257:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:In  general,  Ireland  like  other  EMU  members,  benefited  from currency  stability (more  stable 
14:382:28773:20:21:72:542:237:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:compared  to  individual  currency), Tourism(less  transactional  costs  like  changing  money), 
14:383:28870:21:21:72:542:216:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:business benefits (no hedging costs) and lower interest rates (BBC, 1998). Ireland benefited from 
14:384:28966:21:20:72:543:195:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:positive  external  shocks  like  the  fast  growth  of  the  world  economy,  huge  inflows  of  EU 
14:385:29067:20:21:72:542:175:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:structural  funds  and  FDI,  favourable  exchange  and  interest  rate  developments,  and  rising 
14:386:29167:21:21:72:543:154:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:productivity  (to  some  extent  endogenous)  (Walsh,  2003).  According  to  (Donnell,  2002)  the 
14:387:29267:21:20:72:542:133:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Celtic  Tiger of  the  1990s  resulted  from  the  interaction  of  partnerships  with  a  set  of  supply-side 
14:388:29378:20:21:72:542:113:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:features  that  improved  international  competitiveness  and  stimulated  fast economic  progress.  He 
14:389:29482:21:0:72:543:92:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:also gave credit to better infrastructure financed by both the EU and Ireland, an influx of leading 
15:390:29582:0:21:72:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:US  enterprises  attracted  by  both  Irish  circumstances  necessitated  by  partnerships  and  the 
15:391:29683:21:33:72:215:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:deepening European market.  
15:392:29710:33:20:72:542:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Dorgan  (2006)  also  reiterated  that  EU  affiliation  has  been  very  positive  for  Ireland,  providing 
15:393:29819:20:21:72:542:635:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman:B:market access, boosting Ireland’s national-political status. He added that  despite transfers being 
15:394:29919:21:21:72:543:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:made  to  other  poorer  EU  states,  such  as  Greece,  Portugal,  and  Spain, none  of  these  countries 
15:395:30026:21:21:72:543:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:achieved  similar  growth.  Arguably,  social  partnerships  created  a  positive  impression  to  the 
15:396:30129:21:20:72:543:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:outside investors making Ireland one of the best destinations as Walsh (2003:26) noted that there 
15:397:30227:20:33:72:548:552:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman:B:was an element of a ‘beggar-my-neighbour’ in the use of a low corporation tax regime in Ireland.

15:400:30399:30:14:108:543:456:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The time has come when retrospective wisdom may assess it all as Aristotle said, we can 
15:401:30487:14:14:108:543:442:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:learn  the  nature  of  anything  only  when  it  has  reached - and  passed - its  maturation. 
15:402:30581:14:14:108:543:428:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Events  and  processes,  theories  and  actions,  appear  in  a  new  perspective  and  much  that 
15:403:30680:14:24:108:444:414:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:seems merely a bizarre is given a juster estimate (MacIver, 1968: ix)3 
15:404:30750:24:20:72:543:390:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Retrospective understanding of Irish social partnerships is worth exploring especially in light of 
15:405:30849:20:21:72:542:370:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  recent  move  by  the  Irish  government  to  abandon  partnerships  in  2009  in  the  face of  deep 
15:406:30955:21:21:72:543:349:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economic crisis. Why would the Ireland  government drop partnerships which were by then part 
15:407:31048:21:20:72:543:328:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of the DNA of  Irish policy making?; were these partnerships a mirage of  policy making and an 
15:408:31143:20:21:72:543:308:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f11:B:illusion of consensus (Gunnigle, 1997; Allen, 1999). If social partnership was ‘the only game in 
15:409:31239:21:21:72:543:287:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:C:town’, it is also important to explore whether it was a fair game to all players and probably 
15:410:31333:21:21:72:543:266:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:identify  the  losers  (Murphy,  2002).  Since  at  least  for  the  recent  crisis,  partnerships  were 
15:411:31438:21:20:72:542:245:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:abandoned,  it  is  worth  bringing  the entrenched  hegemony  of  social  partnership  ideology  in 
15:412:31538:20:21:72:543:225:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Ireland  under  scrutiny.  While  the  previous  sections  have  highlighted  some  of  the  real  and 
15:413:31641:21:21:72:543:204:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:perceived  benefits  of  the  Irish  partnerships,  this  section  seeks  to  identify  the  weakness  of  Irish 
15:414:31754:21:31:72:136:183:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:partnerships.

15:416:31824:30:21:72:543:122:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:As  noted  by  Hardman  (2002),  the  unions  were  set  to  understand  that  they  could  be,  in  the 
15:417:31929:21:14:72:543:101:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:expression of a higher trade union leader, either part of the solution or part of the problem. Given

15:419:32088:8:0:72:369:79:6:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f12:F:3 This was in the foreword in The Great Transformation by Polanyi (1964) 
16:420:32158:0:21:72:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the fact that wage bargaining was one of the central themes in social partnership negotiations; it 
16:421:32257:21:21:72:543:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:may  not  be  exaggerative  to  argue  that  unions  played  a  very  important  role  in  the  Irish 
16:422:32359:21:20:72:543:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:partnerships just like in earlier tripartite bargaining system. Over the past two decades from 1987 
16:423:32459:20:21:72:543:647:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:C:to 2007, the main instrument that has determined public and private sector workers’ wages has 
16:424:32553:21:21:72:543:626:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:C:been the national pay agreements that have been negotiated under social partnerships (O’Donnell 
16:425:32649:21:21:72:543:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and Reardon, 2002; Kelly et al, 2008). Unions thus were a crucial partner in contributing to the 
16:426:32746:21:20:72:543:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Irish  recovery  since  1987  but  it  is  worth  noting  as  many  have  observed  that  for  unions  social 
16:427:32856:20:21:72:543:564:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:C:partnership might have been the only ‘game in town’(Murphy, 2002; McDonough and Dundon, 
16:428:32944:21:31:72:105:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2010). 
16:429:32950:31:20:72:542:512:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Faced with strong right wing Fianna Fail government and aware of the on-going Thatcherism in 
16:430:33042:20:21:72:543:492:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Britain in the 1980s, unions had to either become part of the partnerships or risk being wiped out 
16:431:33141:21:21:72:543:471:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(Murphy,   2012;   Teague   and   Donaghey,   2007).   Geary   (2008)   also   noted   that   in   such 
16:432:33245:21:21:72:543:450:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:circumstances  comparatively  weak  unions  can  increase  their  influence  and  reinforce  their 
16:433:33344:21:20:72:543:429:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:representative  capacity  by  participating  in  partnerships.  Walsh  (2003)  also  highlighted  that  the 
16:434:33452:20:21:72:542:409:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:role  of  unions  was  strengthened  by  the  restoration  and  deepening  of  a  centralised bargaining 
16:435:33556:21:21:72:543:388:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:process that went outside wages to cover taxation and other facets of economic policies. It worth 
16:436:33654:21:20:72:543:367:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:noting that union organisation was also improved especially in the latter partnerships  since small 
16:437:33754:20:21:72:543:347:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:unions were being subsumed into larger ones .Teague and Donaghey ( 2009) noted that a series 
16:438:33847:21:21:72:543:326:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of  mergers  reduced  the  number  of  unions  from  86  in  1981,  to  48  in  2001  making  peak  level 
16:439:33953:21:20:72:542:305:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:representation (ICTU) an easier task and thus virtually reducing inter-union disputes. According 
16:440:34050:20:21:72:542:285:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to Teague  and Donaghey  (2007) social partnerships may have their limitations, but it is hard to 
16:441:34147:21:21:72:543:264:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:imagine an alternative that makes the prospects for trade unions any better thus arguing that trade 
16:442:34247:21:31:72:452:243:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:unions have fared relatively well though with mixed fortunes in the Irish case.

16:445:34350:30:14:108:543:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Social  partnership  in  Ireland  was  rooted  in  the  continuation  of  a  tradition  of  a  strong 
16:446:34452:14:13:108:543:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:voluntarism with minimal employment rights. The labour rights that do exist were often 
16:447:34539:13:14:108:542:124:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:begrudgingly  legislated  for  only  in  response  to  European  directives  (MacDonough  and 
16:448:34633:14:0:108:202:110:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Dundon, 2010: 02) 
17:449:34650:0:21:72:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:With the  Irish system of voluntarism in industrial relations, unions might have turned out to be 
17:450:34748:21:21:72:543:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the losers if the recent abandonment of partnerships by the government is considered. There was 
17:451:34844:21:20:72:543:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:common agreement between employer and union leaders that  a voluntarist method would serve 
17:452:34935:20:21:72:543:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:their  mutual  interests  and  build  up  the  tradition  of  collective  bargaining  better  than  any  move 
17:453:35045:21:21:72:543:626:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman:B:towards a mandatory solution (D’Art and Tuner, 2003; Dobbins et  al, 1999).  As  noted  by  Finn 
17:454:35141:21:21:72:542:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(2011)  the  Ireland  lacks  even  a  weak  union-recognition  act  and  the  years  of  partnerships  saw  a 
17:455:35251:21:30:72:372:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:considerable erosion of union density in private corporations.  
17:456:35314:30:21:72:543:554:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Voluntarism places the workers or unions in a position to depend on the good will and preference 
17:457:35411:21:21:72:543:533:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of  employers  in  a  whole  range  of  areas  affecting  wage  negotiations  and  working  conditions

17:459:35612:20:21:72:542:492:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(dominated  by  MNCs)  was  difficult  to  observe.  Even  the  2001  Act  did  not  introduce  any  new 
17:460:35717:21:21:72:543:471:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regulation  on  union  recognition  disputes  and  this  caused  a  disappointment  among  unions 
17:461:35815:21:31:72:226:450:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(Teague and Donaghey, 2007).  
17:462:35844:31:20:72:543:419:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:C:In retrospect, D’Art and Tuner (2011) concluded that for Irish trade unions partnership might 
17:463:35938:20:21:72:542:399:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f11:B:have turned out to be a ‘Faustian bargain’ as the government withdrew from discussions with the 
17:464:36033:21:21:72:543:378:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:C:unions and declared a unilateral pay cut across the public sector. D’Art and Tuner (2003) argued 
17:465:36130:21:20:72:542:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that  for  the  39  cases  taken  since  the  2001  Act  came  into  operation,  only  in  one  case  has  the 
17:466:36241:20:21:72:543:337:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:employer  conceded  union  recognition.  The  emphasis  was  placed  on  procedural  issues  like  the 
17:467:36344:21:21:72:543:316:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:introduction  of  the  right  to  bargain  than  the  union  recognition  which  unions  expected  (Teague 
17:468:36451:21:20:72:542:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  Donaghey,  2007).  Roche  (2001)  also  supported  this  when  he  argued  that  85  percent  of  US 
17:469:36557:20:31:72:523:275:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:MNCs established in Ireland from the late 1980s (partnership years) do not recognize unions. 
17:470:36649:31:21:72:543:244:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Baccaro  and  Simoni  (2004)  observed  that  the  centralised  wage  bargaining  was  dominated  by 
17:471:36750:21:21:72:543:223:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:public  sector  unions  and  this  became  counterproductive,  as  excessive  wage  agreements  were 
17:472:36851:21:20:72:542:202:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:undeservedly generalized to the rest of the economy. This was also reinforced by the fact that in 
17:473:36948:20:21:72:543:182:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the social partnerships the unwritten rules of the game implied that negotiations were to be done 
17:474:37046:21:21:72:543:161:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman:B:“through civil servants and only civil servants” (Murphy 2002:10). The  uneven  distribution  of 
17:475:37143:21:20:72:542:140:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:C:growth  across  all  sectors  had  placed  a  significant  strain  on  a  ‘one-size-fits-all’  pay  norm 
17:476:37248:20:0:72:477:120:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:especially when union recognition was not similar across sectors (Hardman, 2002).  
18:477:37330:0:21:72:542:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:When considering Ireland as the home for MNCs (Teague and Donaghey, 2009) might have had 
18:478:37419:21:21:72:543:688:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:C:a valid argument when they commented that “A fear that enterprise partnerships would be a 
18:479:37509:21:20:72:542:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:conduit for the introduction of German-style works councils into Ireland was the reason why the 
18:480:37605:20:21:72:542:647:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f11:B:Government shied away from using legislation on the matter”. Macdonough and Dundon (2010) 
18:481:37695:21:21:72:542:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:thus were relevant when they argued that while an explicit Thatcherite-type ideological attack on 
18:482:37793:21:21:72:543:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:unions was not evident, the State prevented unions from effectively defending pay and working 
18:483:37887:21:31:72:292:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:conditions in the face of the economic crisis.

18:490:38414:21:21:72:543:437:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:persistent  theme  in  the  literature  of  Irish  partnerships (Murphy,  2012).While  it  is  argued 
18:491:38515:21:20:72:542:416:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:partnerships managed  to  avoid  that  the  bottom  of  the  distribution  fell  too  much  below  the 
18:492:38618:20:21:72:543:396:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:median,  partnerships  could  not  counter  the  growing  inequality(Baccaro  and  Simoni,  2004; 
18:493:38715:21:21:72:543:375:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Donnell  and O’Reardon, 2002). The Celtic  Tiger fruits  have  been  phenomenal  on  the  business 
18:494:38813:21:20:72:542:354:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:front but on the social front societies have not been better and fairer despite reduction in absolute 
18:495:38914:20:21:72:543:334:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:poverty  (Allen,  2000).  Teague  and  Donaghey  (2007)  noted  that  while  the  profitability  of  the 
18:496:39019:21:21:72:543:313:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:corporate sector improved significantly, the distribution of earnings  and income remained more 
18:497:39115:21:31:72:167:292:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:or less unchanged.  
18:498:39134:31:20:72:542:261:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Regan  (2011:  02)  argued  that  the  pro-austerity  design  of  European  Monetary  Union  (EMU) 
18:499:39233:20:21:72:543:241:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman:B:“assumes that economic adjustment can and should take place via downward pressure on wages 
18:500:39323:21:21:72:543:220:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:C:and public spending”. With the loss of control in monetary policy to the EMU, the Irish economy 
18:501:39419:21:20:72:543:199:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:was  left  with  fewer  tools  to  manoeuvre  towards  a  bigger  welfare  state.  Regardless  of  the  lost

18:503:39631:21:21:72:543:158:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:C:saw further cuts in public spending. Ruddock (2009) in the Guardian (2009) noted, “So Lenihan 
18:504:39725:21:20:72:543:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:wielded the axe for the second time this year, cutting social welfare by 4%, public sector pay by 
18:505:39823:20:21:72:426:117:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman:B:up to 15%, child benefit by 10%, capital spending and the health budget” 
18:506:39895:21:21:72:543:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: The  years  of  high  growth  in  Ireland  did  not  yield  a  generous  welfare  state  but  rather  built  a 
18:507:40006:21:0:72:542:75:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:boom-bust  phenomenon  in  the  financial  sector  and  property  business  (Hardson,  2012).  Murphy 
19:508:40108:0:21:72:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(2010)  also  argued  that  recession  required  more  rather  than  less  of  social  policies  but  priority 
19:509:40219:21:21:72:542:688:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman:B:was  given  to  ‘economism’  hence  the  term  ‘competition  state’ – due  to  emphasis  given  on 
19:510:40317:21:20:72:299:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:remaining competitive on the global economy.

19:513:40463:21:21:72:543:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:even  during  the  boom,  the  2008  crisis  caused  further  doses  of  hardships  when  banks  had  to  be 
19:514:40572:21:20:72:542:584:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:C:rescued. It was the so called ‘socialisation of losses and privatisation of profits’ as Kirby(2012) 
19:515:40672:20:21:72:543:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:argued  that  what  the  government    had  done  was  to  give  Irish  taxpayers  the  bill  for  the 
19:516:40775:21:21:72:543:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:irresponsible  practices  of  the  putrid  Irish  banking  sector  during  the  economic  boom.  Hardson 
19:517:40880:21:20:72:543:522:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman:B:(2012:01) also noted “Yet the banks now browbeat governments – not by having ready cash but 
19:518:40971:20:21:72:543:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:by threatening to go bust and drag the economy down with them if they are not given control of

19:521:41108:21:20:72:543:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: Social  partnerships  thus  could  not  do  much  to  improve  and  extend  the  welfare  state  but  rather 
19:522:41217:20:21:72:543:419:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:C:could be seen as another variant of an ‘insider compromise’ (crony capitalism between Fianna 
19:523:41310:21:21:72:176:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Fail and Businesses).

19:536:42120:30:21:72:543:107:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:This  paper  has  displayed  a  narrative  of  the  evolution  of  the  Irish  system  of  social  compacts  in 
19:537:42232:21:0:72:542:86:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f11:B:search  of  whether there can be any ‘hints’ for the South African policy makers. This is very 
20:538:42326:0:21:72:543:709:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:C:crucial because it surely takes more than declarations and claims such as ‘we need to forge a 
20:539:42420:21:21:72:543:688:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman:B:social compact’ to get the economy moving. The Irish compacts have demonstrated particular 
20:540:42511:21:20:72:543:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:challenges.  The  first  challenge  is  that  there  is  no  means  of  measuring  causality  between  these 
20:541:42620:20:21:72:543:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:compacts  and  economic  recovery.  In  other  words,  it  is  hard  to  tell  whether  the  Celtic  tiger  was 
20:542:42732:21:21:72:543:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:born due to the system of Irish social compacts or because of other factors such as the role of the 
20:543:42832:21:21:72:543:605:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:C:multinational corporations’ rapid investment and Ireland’s entry into the European Union. One 
20:544:42926:21:20:72:543:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:very  significant  outcome  of  the  Irish  negotiations  was  the  stabilisation  of  the  labour  unrests  in

20:546:43135:21:21:72:543:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:In  this  regard,  one  may  argue  that  maybe  South  Africa  may  learn  from  the  Irish  system  that

20:550:43558:21:21:72:542:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:negotiations  and  have  no  real  influence  in  the  process  of  policy  making  is  really  alarming.  In  a
