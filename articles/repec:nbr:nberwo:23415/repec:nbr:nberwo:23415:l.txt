2:33:1755:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:Social norms are typically thought to be persistent and long-lasting, sometimes surviving through 
2:34:1853:14:14:72:545:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:growth, recessions, and regime changes. In some cases, however, they can quickly change. This 
2:35:1946:14:14:71:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:paper examines the unraveling of social norms in communication when new information becomes 
2:36:2037:14:14:71:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:available,  e.g.,  aggregated through  elections.  We  build  a  model  of  strategic  communication 
2:37:2137:14:14:71:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:between  citizens  who  can  hold  one of  two  mutually  exclusive  opinions.  In  our  model,  agents 
2:38:2240:14:14:71:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:communicate their opinions to each other, and senders care about receivers' approval. As a result, 
2:39:2338:14:14:71:546:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:senders are more likely to express the more popular opinion, while receivers make less inference 
2:40:2434:14:14:72:546:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:about  senders  who  stated  the  popular  view.  We test  these  predictions  using  two  experiments.  In 
2:41:2541:14:14:72:545:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:the main experiment, we identify the causal effect of Donald Trump's rise in political popularity 
2:42:2638:14:14:72:545:462:12:Times:12:Times:C:on individuals' willingness to publicly express xenophobic views. Participants in the experiment 
2:43:2734:14:14:72:542:448:12:Times:12:Times:F:are  offered  a  bonus  reward  if  they  authorize  researchers  to  make a  donation  to  an  anti-
2:44:2834:14:14:72:545:434:12:Times:12:Times:C:immigration  organization  on  their  behalf.  Participants  who  expect  their  decision to  be  observed 
2:45:2940:14:14:72:546:420:12:Times:12:Times:C:by the surveyor are significantly less likely to accept the offer than those expecting an anonymous 
2:46:3039:14:14:72:546:406:12:Times:12:Times:C:choice.  Increases  in  participants'  perceptions  of  Trump's  popularity  (either  through experimental 
2:47:3145:14:14:72:545:392:12:Times:12:Times:C:variation or through the “natural experiment” of his victory) eliminate the wedge between private 
2:48:3242:14:14:72:545:378:12:Times:12:Times:C:and public behavior. A second experiment uses dictator games to show that participants judge a 
2:49:3336:14:14:72:545:364:12:Times:12:g_d0_f1:C:person less negatively for publicly expressing (but not for privately holding) a political view they 
2:50:3436:14:14:72:546:350:12:Times:12:Times:C:disagree  with  if  that  person's  social  environment  is  one  where  the  majority  of  people  holds  that 
2:51:3548:14:42:72:98:336:12:Times:12:Times:C:view.

3:72:3966:0:28:72:185:690:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:C:1  Introduction
3:73:3981:28:16:72:540:662:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Social norms are an important element of any society:  some behaviors and opinions are socially
3:74:4076:16:16:72:540:646:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:desirable while others are stigmatized.  There is growing evidence that individuals care to a large
3:75:4175:16:17:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:extent  about  how  they  are  perceived  by  others  and  that  such  concerns  might  affect  important
3:76:4280:17:16:72:540:613:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:decisions in a variety of settings, from charitable donations (DellaVigna et al., 2012), to schooling
3:77:4381:16:17:72:540:597:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:choices (Bursztyn and Jensen, 2015), to political behavior (DellaVigna et al., 2017, Enikolopov et
3:78:4479:17:16:72:540:580:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:al., 2017, Perez-Truglia and Cruces, Forthcoming).  Moreover, these social image concerns matter
3:79:4575:16:17:72:540:564:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:both in interactions with other people from the same social group (Bursztyn and Jensen, 2015) and
3:80:4672:17:16:72:540:547:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in interactions with strangers, such as surveyors and solicitors (DellaVigna et al., 2012, DellaVigna
3:81:4773:16:16:72:540:531:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:et al.,  2017).  In particular,  even individuals with very strongly-held political views might avoid
3:82:4874:16:17:72:540:515:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:publicly expressing them if they believe their opinion is not popular in their social environment
3:83:4971:17:16:72:183:498:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(Bursztyn et al., 2016).
3:84:4995:16:17:88:539:482:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:A recent literature has documented the persistence of cultural traits and norms over long periods
3:85:5092:17:16:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of  time  (Voigtl ̈ander  and  Voth,  2012,  Fernandez,  2007,  Giuliano,  2007,  Algan  and  Cahuc,  2010,
3:86:5199:16:17:72:540:449:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Alesina,  Giuliano,  and  Nunn,  2013).   However,  little  is  known  about  what  factors  might  lead
3:87:5303:17:16:72:539:432:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:long-standing  social  norms  tochange,  or  even  more  so,  to  changequickly.   In  this  paper,  we
3:88:5406:16:17:72:540:416:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:argue that aggregators of private opinions in a society, such as elections, might lead to updates in
3:89:5506:17:16:72:540:399:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:individuals’ perceptions of what people around them think,  and thus induce fast changes in the
3:90:5601:16:16:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:social acceptability of holding certain opinions and in the likelihood that these opinions are publicly
3:91:5704:16:17:72:120:367:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:expressed.
3:92:5714:17:16:88:539:350:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Consider the support for the communist regime in the Soviet Union in the late 1980s.  Kuran
3:93:5805:16:17:72:540:334:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(1991) argues that many individuals opposed the regime but believed others supported it.  In that
3:94:5902:17:16:72:540:317:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:environment, a referendum on the regime would have quickly updated people’s opinions about the
3:95:5996:16:17:72:540:301:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:views  of  others.   Incorrect  beliefs  about  the  opinions  of  others  are  not  restricted  to  totalitarian
3:96:6109:17:16:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:regimes, where expressing personal views is often risky.  In fact, as we argue below, if most individ-
3:97:6211:16:16:72:539:268:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f6:B:uals assume that a specific opinion is stigmatized, the stigma might be sustained in equilibrium.1
3:98:6309:16:17:72:540:252:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:In this paper, we formalize this idea and test it using experiments with real stakes.  In our main
3:99:6407:17:16:72:540:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:experiment, we show that Donald Trump’s rise in popularity and eventual victory during the 2016
3:100:6502:16:17:72:540:219:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:U.S. presidential campaign causally increased individuals’ perception of the social acceptability of
3:101:6602:17:16:72:540:202:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:holding  strong  anti-immigration  (or  xenophobic)  views  and  their  willingness  to  publicly  express
3:102:6708:16:17:72:99:186:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:them.
3:103:6713:17:16:88:539:169:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We present a simple model of strategic communication between individuals who can hold one
3:104:6802:16:14:84:539:153:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:1This  phenomenon  is  known  in  social  psychology  as  “pluralistic  ignorance”  (Katz  and  Allport,  1931),  where
3:105:6921:14:11:72:540:139:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:privately most people reject a view, but incorrectly believe that most other people accept it, and therefore end up
3:106:7036:11:11:72:540:128:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:acting  accordingly.   For  example,  in  1968  most  white  Americans  substantially  over-estimated  the  support  among
3:107:7158:11:11:72:540:117:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:other whites for racial segregation (O’Gorman, 1975).  A related concept is that of “preference falsification” (Kuran,
3:108:7276:11:11:72:540:106:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:1995):  people’s stated,  public preferences are influenced by social acceptability,  and might be different from their
3:109:7395:11:0:72:168:95:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:true, private preference.
4:110:7421:0:17:72:539:690:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of the two mutually exclusive convictions (e.g., xenophobic and tolerant).  Eachsenderdelivers a
4:111:7517:17:16:72:540:673:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:message (states his view) to arecipient, who in turn uses this message to make a Bayesian update
4:112:7613:16:17:72:540:657:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on the sender’s true conviction (e.g., whether or not the sender is xenophobic).  In our setting, as
4:113:7713:17:16:72:540:640:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in DellaVigna et al.  (2017), lying is costly, so messages have some credibility; at the same time,
4:114:7812:16:16:72:540:624:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:citizens can pay this cost and lie, so communication need not be truthful.  Importantly, the sender
4:115:7911:16:17:72:540:608:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:has social image concerns:  he values other people’s perception of his type.  Thus, for example, if he
4:116:8013:17:16:72:540:591:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:thinks most other people are tolerant, he might want to hide his xenophobic views and pay the cost
4:117:8111:16:17:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of lying; conversely, if he believes that most other people are xenophobic, he would not only feel
4:118:8209:17:16:72:540:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:free to state such a view if he shares it, but may express xenophobia even if he is tolerant.  Thus,
4:119:8309:16:17:72:540:542:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:senders have incentives to ‘pander to the majority’. In the extreme cases we may have a ‘political
4:120:8407:17:16:72:540:525:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:correctness’ equilibrium, wherein all senders state the same view regardless of their true conviction,
4:121:8509:16:17:72:540:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:thus preventing learning about true convictions.  Receivers are Bayesian, and their perception of a
4:122:8608:17:16:72:540:492:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sender of a message depends on the strategy that senders use.  In the example above, if xenophobic
4:123:8706:16:16:72:540:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:individuals say that they are tolerant because they believe that most are tolerant, then anyone who
4:124:8805:16:17:72:540:460:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:expresses  xenophobic  opinions  must  indeed  be  xenophobic.   At  the  same  time,  if  most  receivers
4:125:8911:17:16:72:540:443:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are believed to be xenophobic so that even some tolerant people express such views, then a person
4:126:9008:16:17:72:540:427:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:stating xenophobic views is not necessarily a xenophobe, and thus will be judged less harshly by
4:127:9104:17:16:72:147:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tolerant people.
4:128:9120:16:17:88:539:394:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Our model predicts, in particular, that a positive update in beliefs about the share of xenophobes
4:129:9218:17:16:72:540:377:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in a society makes xenophobic messages more likely.  Our framework thus illustrates how a shock to
4:130:9316:16:16:72:540:361:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the information possessed by individuals, such as an election where this particular issue (tolerance
4:131:9416:16:17:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:vs.  xenophobia) is salient, can rapidly change the social norm in communication behavior:  what
4:132:9512:17:16:72:540:328:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:was unacceptable and rarely, if ever, spoken, could become acceptable and normal in a matter of
4:133:9607:16:17:72:160:312:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:weeks, if not days.
4:134:9626:17:16:88:539:295:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Quite  interestingly,  the  logic  of  the  paper  suggests  that  information  aggregation  can  make
4:135:9728:16:17:72:540:279:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:an  ‘extreme’  topic  ‘mainstream’,  but  not  the  other  way  around:   such  a  shock  cannot  make  a
4:136:9833:17:16:72:540:262:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:mainstream topic extreme.  This is easy to see:  if a topic is mainstream and socially acceptable,
4:137:9931:16:17:72:540:246:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:individuals  know  how  widely  and  by  whom  each  opinion  is  shared,  in  which  case  information
4:138:10034:17:16:72:540:229:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:aggregation is unlikely to reveal new information.  Of course, if underlying fundamentals change –
4:139:10132:16:16:72:540:213:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for example, more people become radicalized, or people become more judgmental of others – then
4:140:10226:16:17:72:540:197:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a certain viewpoint could move from mainstream to extreme.  However, since this involves changes
4:141:10322:17:16:72:375:180:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in fundamentals, this is likely to be a slow and gradual process.
4:142:10387:16:17:88:539:164:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We test the model on both the senders’ and recipients’ sides using real-stakes experiments on
4:143:10480:17:16:72:540:147:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) based on two recent votes.  On the sender’s side, we focus on the
4:144:10576:16:17:72:540:131:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:2016 U.S. presidential election.  Throughout his campaign, Donald Trump proposed, among other
4:145:10669:17:16:72:540:114:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:things, the construction of a wall separating the US and Mexico and a ban on Muslims from entering
4:146:10767:16:0:72:540:98:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the U.S. His popularity might thus send an informative signal to the population about the number
5:147:10864:0:17:72:540:690:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of people who sympathize with these proposals and thus about those who hold xenophobic views.
5:148:10957:17:16:72:540:673:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:As the experimental evidence we provide suggests, this signal is likely leading to a positive update
5:149:11057:16:17:72:540:657:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in  beliefs  about  the  share  of  xenophobes  in  the  country.   As  a  result,  Donald  Trump’s  electoral
5:150:11167:17:16:72:507:640:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:success potentially caused a shift in social norms regarding expressed views on immigrants.
5:151:11258:16:16:88:539:624:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:More specifically, in the two weeks before the election which took place on November 8, 2016,
5:152:11351:16:17:72:540:608:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:participants were offered a bonus cash reward if they authorized the researchers to make a donation
5:153:11450:17:16:72:540:591:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to  a  strongly  anti-immigration  organization  on  their  behalf.   Accepting  the  offer  is  therefore  a
5:154:11559:16:17:72:539:575:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:profitablexenophobic action.  At baseline,  participants who randomly expected their decision to
5:155:11655:17:16:72:540:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:be  potentially  observed  by  and  discussed  with  a  surveyor  in  a  future  interaction  (the  “public”
5:156:11763:16:17:72:540:542:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:condition)  were  significantly  more  likely  to  forgo  the  donation  bonus  payment  than  those  who
5:157:11868:17:16:72:540:525:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:expected their choice to be entirely anonymous (the “private” condition). This suggests the presence
5:158:11968:16:17:72:540:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of social stigma associated with the action. Before making the donation decision, a random subset of
5:159:12068:17:16:72:540:492:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:participants received information that positively updated their perceptions of Trump’s popularity
5:160:12165:16:16:72:540:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in  their  home  state  on  the  eve  of  the  election.   We  first  show  that  this  information  positively
5:161:12276:16:17:72:540:460:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:updates their beliefs about the local popularity of holding xenophobic views.  We then show that,
5:162:12373:17:16:72:540:443:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for these participants, the wedge in the likelihood of undertaking the xenophobic action in private
5:163:12472:16:17:72:540:427:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and public disappeared.  This difference with respect to the baseline condition was driven entirely
5:164:12571:17:16:72:540:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:by an increase in the donation rate in the public condition, with no change in the private condition.
5:165:12672:16:17:88:539:394:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We also exploited the “natural experiment” of Trump’s unexpected victory as an alternative
5:166:12762:17:16:72:540:377:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:“treatment” that could generate increases in the willingness to publicly express xenophobic views.
5:167:12860:16:16:72:540:361:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We  replicate  the  experimental  intervention  shortly  after  the  election,  restricting  the  design  to
5:168:12968:16:17:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the baseline condition with no initial information on Trump’s popularity.  We find that after the
5:169:13065:17:16:72:540:328:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:election, the wedge between private and public donation rates disappeared, even in the absence of
5:170:13162:16:17:72:540:312:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the experimental information intervention.  Again, this difference was entirely driven by an increase
5:171:13263:17:16:72:540:295:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in the public donation rate; the private donation rate remained unchanged from the pre-election
5:172:13358:16:17:72:540:279:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:survey.  Our results suggest that Donald Trump’s rise in popularity did not casually make these
5:173:13453:17:16:72:540:262:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:participants more xenophobic, but instead made the already more-intolerant ones more comfortable
5:174:13549:16:17:72:540:246:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:about publicly expressing their views. We also discuss suggestive evidence of the precise mechanisms
5:175:13649:17:16:72:169:229:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:driving our findings.
5:176:13670:16:16:88:539:213:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:A  second,  auxiliary  experiment  studies  the  receiver’s  side.   We  exploit  the  general  lack  of
5:177:13774:16:17:72:540:197:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:knowledge among MTurk users in Democrat-leaning U.S. states about the 2009 Swiss referendum
5:178:13865:17:16:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that banned the construction of minarets in that country.  We consider this an ideal setting for
5:179:13961:16:17:72:540:164:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:two reasons.  First, the topic of the referendum was closely aligned to that of our main experiment.
5:180:14061:17:16:72:540:147:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Second, the fact that most participants were unaware not only of the ban, but also of the fact that
5:181:14160:16:17:72:540:131:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the majority of the Swiss population supported it, allows us to manipulate their beliefs about the
5:182:14258:17:16:72:201:114:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:public support for the ban.
5:183:14285:16:0:88:539:98:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:After stating their personal views on whether the construction of minarets should be banned,
6:184:14378:0:17:72:540:690:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:participants  played  a  dictator  game  with  a  real,  anonymous  Swiss  person.   We  randomize  what
6:185:14482:17:16:72:540:673:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:information  was  given  about  the  Swiss  person  to  evaluate  via  revealed  preference  how  different
6:186:14589:16:17:72:540:657:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:information affected the participant’s opinion of that person. We focus on participants who reported
6:187:14689:17:16:72:539:640:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:beingagainstbanning the construction of minarets.  In the first treatment group, individuals who
6:188:14785:16:16:71:539:624:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:were randomly told that the Swiss person is in favor of the ban significantly reduced their donation
6:189:14885:16:17:71:539:608:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:levels in the dictator game, when compared to a control group where that piece of information was
6:190:14982:17:16:71:539:591:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:not provided.  In the second treatment group,  participants were additionally informed that 57%
6:191:15077:16:17:71:539:575:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of Swiss respondents also supported the ban, which positively updated participants’ priors about
6:192:15173:17:16:71:539:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the share of Swiss individuals in support of the ban.  Note that this was the actual support level
6:193:15271:16:17:71:539:542:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for the ban in the 2009 referendum.  Thus, when informed that the Swiss person is surrounded by
6:194:15366:17:16:71:539:525:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:B:other people who support the ban, participants judged that person less negatively forexpressing
6:195:15461:16:17:72:540:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that view, understanding that he might have done so to pander to the majority:  donation amounts
6:196:15557:17:16:72:360:492:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:went up significantly compared to the first treatment group.
6:197:15617:16:16:88:539:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:A potential alternative interpretation is that participants judge the Swiss person less negatively
6:198:15715:16:17:72:540:460:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:B:forholdinghis opinion when the majority of Swiss support the ban,regardless of whether his support
6:199:15813:17:16:72:540:443:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:was expressed in public.For example, it could be that participants feel that they cannot blame a
6:200:15909:16:17:72:540:427:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:person for privately holding a view if that person is surrounded by many other people who also
6:201:16003:17:16:72:540:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:hold that view and who could also have influenced the private opinions of that person.  To directly
6:202:16102:16:17:72:540:394:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rule out this alternative interpretation and confirm that our findings are driven by the anticipation
6:203:16203:17:16:72:540:377:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:by  participants  that  the  Swiss  person  might  have  had  strategic  reasons  to  publicly  express  an
6:204:16310:16:16:72:540:361:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:intolerant view, we also ran an additional experiment emphasizing that the Swiss person’s opinion
6:205:16407:16:17:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:was expressedanonymously.  In that treatment, informing participants of a higher level of public
6:206:16503:17:16:72:415:328:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:support for the ban in Switzerland doesnotincrease donation amounts.
6:207:16571:16:17:88:539:312:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Our results suggest that Trump’s rise in popularity and eventual electoral victory might have
6:208:16664:17:16:72:540:295:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:already  casually  changed  social  norms  regarding  the  expression  of  xenophobic  views  in  the  U.S.
6:209:16771:16:17:72:539:279:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Though we detect no changes inprivately-heldviews, we believe the findings on public expression
6:210:16866:17:16:72:540:262:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are of great policy relevance.  For example, increases in public expression of anti-foreign sentiment
6:211:16967:16:17:72:540:246:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:might  also  lead  to  more  frequent  acts  of  hate  crime  against  foreign  minorities.   Indeed,  recent
6:212:17076:17:16:72:540:229:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:reports indicate a steep increase in the number of hate crimes against these groups throughout the
6:213:17174:16:16:72:540:213:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:campaign period, and especially after Donald Trump’s election.  For example, a recent report by the
6:214:17273:16:17:72:540:197:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism indicates that across eight major metropolitan areas
6:215:17368:17:16:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in the U.S., the number of hate crimes increased by more than 20% in 2016 (CSBS, 2017).  This
6:216:17461:16:17:72:540:164:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:increase is significantly larger in both absolute and relative terms than any year-to-year increase in
6:217:17563:17:16:72:540:147:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:hate crimes in these cities since 2010.  Increases in public expression of hate against some minorities
6:218:17666:16:17:72:540:131:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:might also spur increases in expression of hate against other minorities.  For example,  the same
6:219:17763:17:16:72:540:114:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:report shows that hate crimes against blacks and Jews in New York City also increased substantially
6:220:17862:16:0:72:540:98:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:between March 2016 and March 2017.  More common public expression of certain views might also
7:221:17956:0:17:72:540:690:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:facilitate coordination for large-scale actions, such as demonstrations and movements, and recent
7:222:18053:17:16:72:540:673:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:work has provided evidence that such demonstrations and movements might affect many important
7:223:18146:16:17:72:540:657:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:outcomes, from election results (Madestam et al., 2013) to the stock market valuation of different
7:224:18244:17:16:72:540:640:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:firms (Acemoglu et al., Forthcoming).  In addition, reductions in the stigma associated with holding
7:225:18344:16:16:72:540:624:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:previously-extreme views might lead to shifts in the language used in and reported by the popular
7:226:18441:16:17:72:540:608:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:media, and might also reduce the stigma associated with consuming and discussing certain news
7:227:18534:17:16:72:540:591:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sources  on  the  far  side  of  the  political  spectrum.   For  example,  the  news  websiteBreitbarthas

7:229:18747:17:16:72:540:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:reaching 9% of the market – 18 million visitors – that month.2Increases in public expression of
7:230:18842:16:17:72:540:542:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:such views can thus lead to increases in individuals’ overall exposure to them, and more exposure
7:231:18939:17:16:72:523:525:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:might eventually lead to changes in privately-held views, via persuasion or simple conformism.
7:232:19033:16:17:88:539:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Our results contribute to a growing literature that examines the impacts of political institutions
7:233:19131:17:16:72:540:492:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on social norms and culture more generally.  This literature typically studies the long-run impact
7:234:19229:16:16:72:540:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of political institutions (e.g., Lowes et al., 2016); here we show that changes on the political side
7:235:19330:16:17:72:540:460:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:can lead to fast reversals in social norms.  Our paper also adds to a recent theoretical literature
7:236:19429:17:16:72:540:443:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on  social  norms  (e.g.,  B ́enabou  and  Tirole,  2011,  and  Acemoglu  and  Jackson,  Forthcoming)  by

7:238:19638:17:16:72:540:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to  a  cross-disciplinary  literature  on  the  consequences  of  political  action,  both  theoretical  (e.g.,
7:239:19749:16:17:72:540:394:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Lohmann,  1993)  and  empirical  (e.g.,  Madestam  et  al.,  2013).   Methodologically,  this  paper  also
7:240:19855:17:16:72:540:377:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:relates to a literature on the measurement of sensitive attitudes, which includes approaches such
7:241:19952:16:16:72:540:361:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:as the “randomized response technique” (Warner, 1965), the “list experiment” (Raghavarao et al.,
7:242:20048:16:17:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:1979), the “endorsement experiment” (Sniderman, 1993), and the “lost letter technique” (Milgram,
7:243:20144:17:16:72:540:328:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:1977).  In our study, the private donation decision provides a measure based on revealed preference,
7:244:20244:16:17:72:540:312:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and where concerns about social desirability are minimized due to anonymity.  Conceptually, our
7:245:20339:17:16:72:540:295:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:main experiment is novel since it exploits both experimental and natural occurring variation as two
7:246:20438:16:17:72:540:279:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:alternative approaches.  Randomized informational interventions are often subject to the criticism
7:247:20536:17:16:72:540:262:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of  not  being  entirely  natural,  while  before/after  designs  based  on  natural  variation  suffer  from
7:248:20645:16:17:72:540:246:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lack of true randomization.  In our setting, the two approaches yielded very similar results, which
7:249:20744:17:16:72:383:229:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:provides extra assurance of the validity of our tests of the model.
7:250:20811:16:16:88:539:213:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Theoretically, the two most important precursors to our paper are Bernheim (1994) and Morris
7:251:20903:16:17:72:540:197:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(2001).  Bernheim (1994) studies the behavior of individuals with social concerns and predicts the
7:252:21001:17:16:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:emergence  of  social  norms.   People  with  similar  preferences  will  adhere  strictly  to  such  norms,
7:253:21109:16:17:72:540:164:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:while  people  with  extreme  tastes  will  choose  not  to  do  so.   The  possibility  of  complete  pooling
7:254:21219:17:16:72:540:147:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and the resulting non-transmission of information is suggested in Morris (2001), where an advisor
7:255:21316:16:17:72:540:131:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:who  is  afraid  of  being  perceived  as  biased  ultimately  avoids  giving  advice  in  all  states  of  the
7:256:21427:17:15:72:540:114:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:world.  Our model can be viewed as combining and simplifying the two approaches to get a model

8:258:21598:0:17:72:540:690:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with  straightforward  comparative  statics  results  that  highlight  the  role  of  individual  beliefs  and
8:259:21708:17:16:72:540:673:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:information shocks.  One can loosely view the model as adapting the binary message structure of
8:260:21803:16:17:72:410:657:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Morris (2001) to the social communication setting of Bernheim (1994).
8:261:21872:17:16:88:539:640:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Our  work  also  relates  to  existing  papers  studying  the  economic  consequences  of  conformity.
8:262:21974:16:16:72:540:624:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Prendergast (1993) identifies rational incentives for managers to conform to supervisors’ opinions in
8:263:22075:16:17:72:540:608:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:order to appear competent, which in turn hampers information transmission. Andreoni et al. (2016)

8:265:22271:16:17:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:action due to individual incentives to conform to the predominant and inefficient behavior.  In a
8:266:22368:17:16:72:540:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:laboratory experiment they find, in particular, that opinion polls can facilitate changes of norms
8:267:22466:16:17:72:540:542:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that benefit the group.  Their setting, however, is one of full information, and thus opinion polls
8:268:22565:17:16:72:540:525:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:facilitate switching from one equilibrium to another.  Our model has incomplete information and
8:269:22660:16:17:72:540:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:features a unique equilibrium, and elections can change the beliefs about the distribution of other
8:270:22759:17:16:72:540:492:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:people’s opinions (though we do not take a position on whether overcoming conformity is necessarily
8:271:22858:16:16:72:540:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:socially beneficial).  In a different setting, Kets and Sandroni (2015) study the trade-off between
8:272:22957:16:17:72:394:460:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the performance of conforming versus diverse groups of individuals.
8:273:23024:17:16:88:539:443:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows.  We introduce a simple framework formalizing
8:274:23117:16:17:72:540:427:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:our argument in Section 2. In Section 3, we present the design and results from the main experiment
8:275:23216:17:16:72:540:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:studying the 2016 U.S. presidential elections.  In Section 4, we present the design and results from
8:276:23316:16:38:72:363:394:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the auxiliary dictator game experiment.  Section 5 concludes.
8:277:23377:38:28:72:260:356:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:C:2  Theoretical Framework
8:278:23401:28:24:72:262:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:C:2.1  A model of communication
8:279:23430:24:16:72:539:304:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f9:B:There is a continuum of citizens.3Citizens can hold one of two mutually exclusive convictions,A
8:280:23525:16:16:72:539:288:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:orB; we sometimes call it their type and writeti∈{A, B}for citizeni.  (One can think of these as
8:281:23621:16:17:71:539:272:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:‘beliefs’ in colloquial sense, but we reserve the word ‘beliefs’ for the game-theoretical notion.) The
8:282:23723:17:16:71:540:255:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:share of citizens holding convictionAisp, so Pr (ti=A) =p.  We do not assume thatpis known,
8:283:23814:16:17:72:539:239:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and instead allow citizens to hold an incorrect belief about the share of citizens with convictionA,
8:284:23914:17:16:72:540:222:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:which we denote byq.  To avoid dealing with higher-order beliefs,  we assume thatqis common
8:285:24005:16:17:72:124:206:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:knowledge.
8:286:24015:17:16:88:539:189:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The citizens are paired with one another;  within each pair,  there is a senderiand recipient
8:287:24108:16:16:72:539:173:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f4:B:j.   Senderisends  messagemi,  and  we  assume  that  the  message  space  is  binary,  so  message
8:288:24207:16:17:72:540:157:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f4:B:mi∈ {A, B}.  Sending a messagemimay involve the following costs for citizeni.  First, sending
8:289:24300:17:16:72:540:140:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a messagemi6=tiincurs a cost of lyingli;  this cost is assumed to be distributed uniformly on
8:290:24393:16:17:72:540:124:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:[0,1] (this can be thought of as normalization), and independently ofti(i.e., citizens holding either
8:291:24494:17:0:84:505:107:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:A:3We could instead assume communication between two individuals.  The results would not change at all.
9:292:24596:0:17:72:540:690:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:conviction are equally averse to lying).4Second, the sender bears a cost proportional (with intensity
9:293:24697:17:16:72:540:673:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:factor denoted bya) to his belief that the recipient does not approve his type.  Consequently, the
9:294:24795:16:17:72:539:657:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:expected utility of a citizeniwith two-dimensional type (ti, li) from sending messagemito recipient
9:295:24894:17:29:72:131:640:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f4:B:jis given by

9:297:24971:30:17:71:539:581:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:where  Prj(ti=A|mi)  is  the  recipient’s  posterior  that  the  sender  is  typeAconditional  on  the
9:298:25073:17:16:71:170:564:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:message he sent,mi.
9:299:25092:16:16:88:539:548:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:In this game,  we are interested in Perfect Bayesian Equilibria,  which furthermore satisfy the
9:300:25187:16:33:71:244:532:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:D1 criterion (Cho and Kreps, 1987).
9:301:25222:33:23:71:151:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:C:2.2  Analysis
9:302:25235:23:16:71:540:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We start our analysis with the caseq >12, which means that typesti=Aare perceived to be more
9:303:25327:16:17:72:540:460:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:numerous.  Then senders with the same typeti=Acommunicate truthfully.  Indeed, by sending
9:304:25416:17:16:72:539:443:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:messagemi=Bthey would incur the cost of lying and furthermore make the receiver’s opinion
9:305:25505:16:17:72:540:427:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:about them worse, on average.5For senders of typeti=B, there is a cutoffz, so that those with
9:306:25598:17:16:72:539:410:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f4:B:li< zsend messagemi=A(i.e., they lie if it is not too costly) and those withli> zsendmi=B.
9:307:25688:16:30:72:540:394:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:As a result, recipientjwho got messagemi=Abelieves that the sender isti=Awith probability
9:308:25777:30:0:217:330:364:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:?:Prj(ti=A|mi=A) =
9:309:25793:0:14:361:366:371:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:C:q
9:310:25794:14:25:334:392:357:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:C:q+ (1−q)z
9:311:25803:25:30:72:510:332:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and a recipient who got messagemi=Bbelieves that the sender is typeti=Bfor sure, so
9:312:25886:30:29:243:368:302:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:?:Prj(ti=A|mi=B) = 0.
9:313:25905:29:17:88:540:273:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:This implies that for a sender with type (ti=B, li), sending messagemi=Aresults in expected

9:322:26051:26:30:71:356:211:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:whereas sending messagemi=Bresults in expected utility

9:324:26123:17:14:84:539:164:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:4Thus, in our model, communication is not ‘cheap talk’, as in Crawford and Sobel (1982).  See Kartik, Ottaviani,
9:325:26235:14:11:72:540:150:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:and Squintani (2007) and Kartik (2009) for models of strategic communication with lying costs in an uninformed
9:326:26345:11:7:72:226:139:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:principal – informed agent framework.
9:327:26382:7:15:84:539:132:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:5This argument implicitly uses the fact that typest=Aare relatively more likely to send messagem=Athan
9:328:26484:15:11:72:540:117:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:typest=B.  We formally prove that this holds in every equilibrium in the Supplemental Appendix.  Intuitively, this
9:329:26598:11:0:72:418:106:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:follows from the presence of costs of lying, which make the two messages asymmetric.
10:330:26683:0:17:72:540:690:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(Because only recipients of typeBwill approve of him).  The sender with type (ti=B, li=z) is

10:404:28473:17:16:71:539:105:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:correctness’ form, where all senders communicate the message that a majority of receivers would
10:405:28568:16:0:71:540:89:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:prefer.  The requirementa >1 reflects that the sender’s concern about the receiver’s opinions has to
11:406:28669:0:17:72:540:690:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:be strong enough to overcome even the highest cost of lying.  For intermediate values ofq, citizens
11:407:28768:17:16:72:540:673:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:who have a low cost of lying pander to the majority, but those who have high cost of lying do not.
11:408:28866:16:17:88:539:657:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Even if the equilibrium is not fully of the ‘political correctness’ form, communication depends
11:409:28961:17:16:72:540:640:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on the beliefs that citizens have as well as their sensitivity to the opinion of others.  The cutoffs (2)
11:410:29066:16:16:72:539:624:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and (3) are both increasing ina, meaning that if senders are more concerned with the receiver’s
11:411:29161:16:17:72:540:608:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:opinion, they are more likely to send a message preferred by a majority of receivers.  Furthermore,
11:412:29260:17:16:72:539:591:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(2) is increasing inq, provided thatq >12.  This happens for two reasons.  First, a higherqmakes
11:413:29356:16:17:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:it more likely that the recipient is of typeA, which makes the sender even more willing to send
11:414:29451:17:16:72:539:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:messageA.  Second, and more subtly, a higherqincreases the receiver’s prior that the sender is
11:415:29545:16:17:72:539:542:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f9:B:typeA, which means that the drop in his opinion about the sender who discloses his convictionB
11:416:29639:17:16:72:539:525:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is now higher, and the sender’s chance to ‘pass’ as typeAif he sends messageAis also higher.  The
11:417:29736:16:17:72:540:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:cutoff (3) is decreasing inqfor similar reasons, which again implies that the share of senders who
11:418:29834:17:16:72:540:492:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sendAis increasing inqeven ifq <12.  Of course, a higher objective number of citizens of type
11:419:29927:16:16:72:539:476:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f4:B:A,p, also increases the share of senders sendingA:  while this does not change the strategy of an
11:420:30024:16:17:72:539:460:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:individual sender, this is true since citizens with convictionAare relatively more likely to sendA.
11:421:30123:17:25:88:454:443:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We summarize these comparative statics results in the following proposition.
11:422:30199:25:0:72:236:418:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f11:C:Proposition 2.Suppose  thatq∈

11:428:30239:9:17:306:539:418:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:C:,  so  in  the  unique  equilibrium  both  messages  are
11:429:30295:17:16:71:250:401:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:C:sent with positive probabilities.  Then:

11:432:30458:16:16:88:540:352:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:A:(ii) An increase inq,  the citizens’ belief about the share of those with convictionA,  also leads
11:433:30556:16:17:72:244:336:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:C:to more senders sending messageA.

11:436:30737:17:31:88:463:286:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:A:More generally, forq <12−vorq >12+v, these results hold in a weak sense.
11:437:30809:31:17:88:539:255:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Proposition 2 describes the effect of parameters on the behavior of senders.  We are also in-
11:438:30902:17:16:71:539:238:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:terested  in  their  effect  on  the  receiver’s  beliefs  about  the  sender  following  the  receipt  of  either
11:439:31016:16:16:71:540:222:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:message. To understand these effects,  suppose thatq >12.  Then after receiving messageB,  the
11:440:31110:16:17:71:540:206:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:receiver is certain that the sender was of typeB, so Prj(ti=A|mi=B) = 0.  At the same time,
11:441:31201:17:16:71:539:189:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:as argued above, after receiving messageA, the receiver’s posterior probability that the sender is
11:442:31299:16:17:71:539:173:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of typeAequals Prj(ti=A|mi=A) =qq+(1−q)z.  Sincezis increasing ina, this posterior belief
11:443:31388:17:16:72:540:156:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is decreasing ina.  This is natural:  ifais higher, more citizens of typeBmisrepresent themselves
11:444:31485:16:17:72:539:140:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:by sending messagemi=A, thus making at less likely that a random sender of messageAis truly
11:445:31576:17:16:72:539:123:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:typeA.  Now consider the comparative statics with respect toq.  Here, there are two effects.  First,
11:446:31676:16:16:72:539:107:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f9:B:the  cutoffzis  increasing  inq,  thus  making  it  harder  to  be  sure  that  a  sender  with  messageA
11:447:31781:16:0:72:539:91:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is indeed typeA.  But,  on the other hand,  a higherqimplies an overall higher share of citizens

12:450:32072:16:19:72:538:657:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f6:B:non-monotone overall effect:  the posterior Prj(ti=A|mi=A) is highest (equal to 1) atq=12
12:451:32161:19:0:72:436:638:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:andq= 1, and otherwise it is U-shaped, with the minimum attained atq=

12:477:32990:16:17:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f4:B:Abecomes a majority, receivers would recognize that this message could be sent for strategic reason

12:486:33426:23:17:72:540:321:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Let  us  now  consider  a  simple  extension  of  the  previous  model  that  will  enable  us  to  study  how
12:487:33536:17:16:72:540:304:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:certain  shocks  to  the  underlying  parameters  affect  communication  strategies  within  the  society,
12:488:33642:16:16:72:540:288:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:as well as social learning.  There may be multiple reasons for shocks:  arrival of new information
12:489:33740:16:17:72:540:272:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that makes some people change their opinions,  a speech by an influential politician or celebrity,
12:490:33838:17:16:72:540:255:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:or others.  Here, we consider elections as a particular case of a shock that aggregates convictions
12:491:33937:16:17:72:540:239:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and allows citizens to learn about members of their society that they do not directly communicate
12:492:34034:17:16:72:100:222:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f6:B:with.6
12:493:34040:16:17:88:539:206:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Specifically, we consider a three-period model. In each of the periods, each citizen communicates
12:494:34137:17:16:72:540:189:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with a continuum of other citizens, and we assume that in these communications he is both the
12:495:34230:16:16:72:540:173:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sender and the receiver.  Informally, we think about citizens adopting a certain ‘persona’ for the
12:496:34328:16:17:72:540:157:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:whole period, and if what they learned during that period about the rest of the society suggests
12:497:34424:17:16:72:540:140:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:it would be better to act differently, they can send different messages in the subsequent periods.
12:498:34522:16:15:84:539:124:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:6Political campaigns that precede elections may, of course, persuade people to change convictions about issues or
12:499:34635:15:11:72:540:109:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:make some issues more salient than others.  This may also change communication strategies in the society.  Here, we
12:500:34750:11:0:72:385:98:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:only focus on the moment of elections as the source of the information shock.
13:501:34829:0:17:72:540:690:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Formally, we assume that each citizen is matched with three disjoint continua of other citizens, and
13:502:34929:17:16:72:540:673:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in each of the periods, he sends a message to all other citizens matched to him in that period and
13:503:35027:16:17:72:539:657:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:receives messages from all of them.7Before period 1, the share of citizens having convictionA, i.e.,
13:504:35127:17:16:72:540:640:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f4:B:p, is realized, and Nature instead sends a public noisy signal to all citizens, so citizens start period
13:505:35231:16:16:72:539:624:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:1 with a common belief that the share of citizens with convictionAisq.  They communicate in

13:507:35412:17:16:71:539:591:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(e.g., through elections), after which the citizens have a final round of communication.  Such timing
13:508:35513:16:17:71:539:575:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:allows  us  to  compare  the  social  norms  learned  through  strategic  communication  (period  2)  and
13:509:35618:17:16:71:539:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the social norms learned through public information aggregation (period 3).  We do not introduce
13:510:35714:16:17:71:539:542:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:any discounting, but since each agent is infinitesimal and does not expect to change others’ beliefs
13:511:35814:17:16:71:539:525:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for the subsequent periods, each agent would communicate to maximize his static payoffs with or
13:512:35909:16:17:71:169:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:without discounting.
13:513:35929:17:25:88:227:492:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We have the following result.

13:532:36358:26:16:88:539:359:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:This result is mainly of interest if the original belief was wrong.  Ifqis relatively close to12, then
13:533:36460:16:16:71:539:343:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f9:B:both messages are sent with positive probabilities.  Each citizen is then perfectly able to deducep
13:534:36559:16:17:71:540:327:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:from what they observe in period 1.  Indeed, suppose, for the sake of the argument, thatq≥12.  In

13:540:37102:16:16:72:539:228:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f9:B:of their conviction, send the same message in period 1 in equilibrium (Aifqis close to 1 andB

13:542:37292:17:16:71:540:195:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:citizen makes any inference aboutp.  The second period is then identical to the first one.  However,

13:546:37678:18:15:84:540:128:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:7For example, suppose that citizens are randomly allocated in a unit cube with coordinates (x, y, z).  In period 1,
13:547:37793:15:10:72:539:113:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:citizen (x, y, z) communicates with citizens of the form (∗, y, z), in period 2, he does so with (x,∗, z), and in period
13:548:37913:10:11:72:539:103:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:3, he communicates with those of the form (x, y,∗).  Within a period, all citizens communicate simultaneously, so the
13:549:38030:11:0:72:390:92:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:message that a citizen sends is not affected by what he receives in that period.

14:551:38140:17:16:88:539:673:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We thus observe the following.  If the original citizens’ beliefs about their fellow citizens are
14:552:38237:16:17:71:539:657:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sufficiently moderate, the society is able to learn the true parameter through communication, and
14:553:38334:17:16:71:539:640:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:elections do not reveal new information and therefore do not lead to a change in behavior.  However,
14:554:38434:16:16:71:539:624:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:if the original beliefs led the society to a ‘political correctness’ equilibrium, then there is no learning
14:555:38541:16:17:71:539:608:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in communication.  In this case, elections can reveal new and surprising information, and thus can
14:556:38639:17:32:71:336:591:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lead to a discontinuous change in beliefs and behaviors.

14:576:39443:27:17:71:539:309:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We developed two experiments with workers from the online platform MTurk.  A number of recent
14:577:39536:17:16:71:539:292:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:papers in economics have used the same platform to conduct surveys or experiments (e.g., Kuziemko
14:578:39633:16:17:71:539:276:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:et al.  2015, Elias et al.  2016).  The platform draws workers from very diverse backgrounds, though
14:579:39733:17:32:71:345:259:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:it is not representative of the U.S. population as a whole.

14:582:39857:24:16:71:539:180:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:During the two weeks prior to the presidential election, we recruited participants (N = 458) from
14:583:39954:16:17:71:539:164:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  eight  states  in  which  the  expected  probability  of  Donald  Trump’s  victory  at  the  state  level
14:584:40064:17:16:71:539:147:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:was 100%, according to the websitePredictwise:  Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Nebraska, Oklahoma,
14:585:40157:16:17:72:540:131:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Mississippi, West Virginia, and Wyoming.  MTurk workers with at least 80% approval rate could see
14:586:40254:17:16:72:540:114:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:our request, which was described as a “5 minute survey” with a reward of $0.50.  Each worker could
14:587:40352:16:0:72:540:98:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:participate in the survey only once.  Workers who clicked on the request were displayed detailed
15:588:40450:0:17:72:540:690:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:instructions about the task, and given access to links to the study information sheet and the actual
15:589:40550:17:16:72:397:673:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:B:survey.  The survey was conducted on the online platformQualtrics.
15:590:40616:16:17:88:539:657:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:After  answering  a  number  of  demographic  questions,  half  of  the  participants  were  randomly
15:591:40717:17:16:71:539:640:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:informed about the 100% local odds from the website (informationcondition) while the other half
15:592:40812:16:16:72:539:624:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:were not informed (controlcondition).8Though restricting to these states might affect the external
15:593:40910:16:17:72:540:608:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:validity of the findings, it also allows us not to worry about the role of heterogeneous priors (and
15:594:41010:17:16:72:540:591:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:updates) in response to an informational treatment:  the 100% forecast ensured that for this half
15:595:41107:16:17:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of the sample, the direction of the update in Trump’s perceived local popularity is either zero or
15:596:41205:17:16:72:210:558:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f6:B:positive, but never negative.9
15:597:41235:16:17:88:539:542:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Participants were then all asked to predict to share of individuals in their state that agree with
15:598:41333:17:27:72:304:525:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f6:B:a relatively strong anti-immigration statement:10
15:599:41382:27:17:99:512:498:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Both legal and illegal immigration should be drastically reduced because immigrants
15:600:41465:17:28:99:414:481:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:undermine American culture and do not respect American values.
15:601:41527:28:16:88:503:453:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:This provides a measure of the perceived local popularity of anti-immigrant sentiment.
15:602:41613:16:17:88:539:437:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:In the next part of the intervention, we measured the perceived social acceptability of strong
15:603:41707:17:16:72:540:420:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:anti-immigrant  sentiment  using  a  donation  experiment  with  real  stakes.   Participants  were  first
15:604:41813:16:16:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:told that they would be given the possibility to make a donation to a randomly drawn organization
15:605:41910:16:17:72:540:388:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that  could  either  be  anti-  or  pro-immigration,  to  ensure  that  participants  would  not  associate
15:606:42017:17:16:72:540:371:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the experimenters with a specific political view.  To maximize power and avoid direct deception,
15:607:42113:16:17:72:540:355:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the randomization was such that more than 90% of participants (N=428) would get assigned the
15:608:42205:17:16:72:539:338:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:organization  we  were  interested  in:  theFederation  of  American  Immigration  Reform.   To  make
15:609:42306:16:17:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sure participants were aware of the organization’s very strong anti-immigration stance, a few more
15:610:42404:17:15:72:453:305:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:details about the organization and its founder were provided in the experiment:
15:611:42483:15:11:84:305:290:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:A:8See the survey scripts in the Supplemental Appendix.
15:612:42536:11:15:84:539:279:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:9Eliciting priors in the control group to assess the direction of the update would have been challenging since the
15:613:42650:15:11:72:540:264:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:forecast  information  was  available  online.   Therefore,  asking  the  question  before  the  donation  decision  could  have
15:614:42778:11:11:72:540:253:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:undone the treatment.  Answers to the question if asked after the donation decision could have been affected by the
15:615:42893:11:7:72:408:242:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:decision itself and by the private/public condition later assigned to the participant.
15:616:42979:7:15:80:539:235:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:10Here  we  describe  the  protocol  of  the  experiment  as  it  was  registered  on  the  AEA  RCT  registry  with  number
15:617:43103:15:11:72:540:220:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:AEARCTR-0001752.  As described in the registry,  we planned to reach 400 individuals by November 7 – the day
15:618:43211:11:11:72:540:209:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:before the election and thus conceptually the last day in which the survey could be done (also pre-registered as the
15:619:43327:11:11:72:540:198:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:trial end date).  In the piloting phase (on October 26 and 27,)  we were able to recruit 184 participants.  We thus
15:620:43442:11:11:72:540:187:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:expected not to have any issue recruiting 400 more subjects in the eight days between October 31 and November 7,
15:621:43554:11:11:72:540:176:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:given that in two days we were able to survey nearly half of that sample size.  However, only 274 MTurk workers
15:622:43665:11:11:72:540:165:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:selected themselves into the study during the registered trial dates.  The number of active MTurk workers in these
15:623:43779:11:11:72:540:154:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:states  is  lower  than  we  had  originally  expected  (and  to  our  knowledge  no  estimates  of  the  MTurk  population  in
15:624:43906:11:11:72:540:143:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:those states exist), which made it difficult to recruit enough participants before the election.  In order to reach the
15:625:44025:11:10:72:540:132:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:desired  (and  registered)  sample  size,  we  decided  to  include  individuals  who  participated  in  the  pilot  experiment
15:626:44152:10:11:72:540:122:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:conducted before the registration with nearly identical versions of the protocol.  In particular, both the wording of
15:627:44269:11:11:72:540:111:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:the informational treatment and the wording of the donation decision were completely unchanged.  If we restrict the
15:628:44384:11:11:72:540:100:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:analysis to the 274 subjects who followed the registered protocol,  results are directionally similar,  as discussed in
15:629:44503:11:0:72:132:89:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:Subsection 3.3.
16:630:44520:0:17:99:519:690:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f12:A:The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) is animmigration-reduction

16:633:44770:17:16:99:512:640:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:States.  The founder of FAIR is John Tanton, author of ‘The Immigration Invasion’ who
16:634:44855:16:16:99:512:624:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:wrote “I’ve come to the point of view that for European-American society and culture
16:635:44939:16:29:99:461:608:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:to persist requires a European-American majority, and a clear one at that.”
16:636:45014:29:16:88:539:579:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Participants were then asked if they would like to authorize the researchers donate $1 to that
16:637:45108:16:17:71:539:563:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:organization  on  their  behalf.   The  money  would  not  come  from  the  subject’s  $0.50  payment  for
16:638:45214:17:16:71:539:546:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:participation in the study.  Moreover, the participant would also be paid anextra$1 (or about 1/6
16:639:45311:16:16:71:539:530:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of an hourly wage on MTurk) if he/she authorized the donation.  Rejecting the donation would not
16:640:45407:16:17:71:539:514:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:affect the monetary payoffs to the participants in any way other than through the loss of this extra
16:641:45507:17:16:71:110:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:amount.
16:642:45514:16:17:88:539:481:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:In  addition  to  the  original  randomization  of  informing  subjects  about  Trump’s  probability
16:643:45614:17:16:71:539:464:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of victory in the participant’s state,  we introduced a second layer of cross-randomization at the
16:644:45712:16:17:71:539:448:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:donation stage.  Half of the participants were assured that their donation authorization would be
16:645:45809:17:16:71:539:431:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:kept completely anonymous, and that no one, not even the researchers would be able to match their
16:646:45906:16:16:71:539:415:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:decision to their name: we refer to this condition as thePrivatecondition.  Specifically, participants
16:647:46008:16:29:71:118:399:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:were told:
16:648:46018:29:16:99:513:370:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f12:A:Note:  just like any other answer to this survey, alsoyour donation decision will be
16:649:46102:16:16:99:512:354:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f4:A:completely anonymous.  No one, not even the researchers, will be able to match your
16:650:46185:16:29:99:207:338:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:decision to your name.
16:651:46207:29:16:88:539:309:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The other half of the subjects were instead informed, right before the donation question was
16:652:46299:16:17:71:539:293:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:displayed to them, that they might be personally contacted by the research team to verify their
16:653:46394:17:16:71:539:276:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:B:answers to the questions in the remaining part of the survey:  this is what we refer to as thePublic

16:655:46504:28:17:99:512:232:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Important: in order to ensure the quality of the data collected, a member of the research
16:656:46593:17:16:99:512:215:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:teammight personally contact youto verify your answers to the next question and
16:657:46672:16:28:99:188:199:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:the following ones.
16:658:46691:28:17:88:539:171:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Names and contact information were not collected during the intervention, since the practice
16:659:46783:17:16:72:540:154:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is not allowed on MTurk.  As a result, it was not possible to credibly lead participants to believe
16:660:46882:16:16:72:540:138:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that their decision would be observed by other individuals, for example, from their state.  However,
16:661:46982:16:17:72:540:122:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on MTurk it is possible to contact participants individually on the platform via their worker ID.
16:662:47079:17:16:72:540:105:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We were therefore able to minimize the use of deception since the decision was anonymous yet re-
16:663:47175:16:0:72:540:89:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:searchers could still potentially contact participants (moreover, participants in the public condition
17:664:47279:0:17:72:540:690:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:might have believed that they would be asked for personal information in case they were contacted
17:665:47376:17:16:72:540:673:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:later on).  As mentioned before, social acceptability with respect to surveyors and solicitors is also

17:669:47659:24:16:72:540:585:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We also exploited the natural experiment of Trump’s unexpected victory as an alternative “treat-
17:670:47755:16:17:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ment” potentially leading to an increase in the social acceptability of holding xenophobic views.  We
17:671:47856:17:16:72:540:552:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:repeated the experimental intervention in the same states during the first week after the election,
17:672:47955:16:17:72:540:536:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:restricting the design to the control condition with no additional initial information on Trump’s
17:673:48052:17:16:72:540:519:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:popularity.  We recruited both subjects who had participated before the election (N = 168; 166 of
17:674:48149:16:16:72:540:503:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:them assigned to the anti-immigration organization) and new participants (N = 218; 215 assigned
17:675:48244:16:17:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to that organization).  Based on naturally occurring variation, we can assess the impact of Trump’s
17:676:48343:17:32:72:399:470:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:electoral victory on the perceived social acceptability of xenophobia.
17:677:48413:32:24:72:424:438:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:C:3.2  Linking the Experiment to the Theoretical Framework
17:678:48469:24:16:72:539:414:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:In what follows, we assume thatAis the xenophobic conviction, whileBis the opposite (tolerant)
17:679:48563:16:16:72:540:398:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:one.   In  the  main  experiment,  the  communication  is  between  the  subject  (thesender)  and  the
17:680:48666:16:17:72:539:382:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:researcher (thereceiver).  Moreover,qhere corresponds to the sender’s beliefs about the share of
17:681:48762:17:16:72:539:365:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:xenophobes in the country.  We consider two treatments that test the effect of manipulatingqon the
17:682:48860:16:17:72:540:349:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:likelihood that a xenophobic message is sent, thus testing the comparative static result associated
17:683:48959:17:28:72:198:332:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:withqfrom Proposition 2:
17:684:48983:28:17:88:540:304:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f4:A:•Treatment 1: the researchers communicate to the subject that Trump is winning for sure in
17:685:49073:17:25:99:151:287:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:their state.
17:686:49085:25:28:88:285:262:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f4:A:•Treatment 2:  Trump wins the election.
17:687:49124:28:17:88:539:234:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Note that though both treatments increaseq, their effect might operate through different chan-
17:688:49218:17:16:72:540:217:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:nels.  In particular, since Treatment 1 provides information about the area where the sender lives,
17:689:49317:16:17:72:540:201:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the effect is likely operating through the sender updating his beliefs about what the receiver thinks
17:690:49418:17:16:72:540:184:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of him in the absence or in the presence of a xenophobic message being communicated.  On the
17:691:49510:16:16:72:540:168:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:other hand, since Treatment 2 provides information at the country level, it might also lead to an
17:692:49607:16:17:72:540:152:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:update in the sender’s priors on whether the receiver is a xenophobe.  In our discussion of results,
17:693:49707:17:0:72:381:135:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we provide suggestive evidence consistent with these hypotheses.
18:694:49773:0:24:72:181:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:C:3.3  Main Results
18:695:49790:24:16:72:540:666:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Appendix Table A.1 provides evidence that individual characteristics are balanced across all four
18:696:49887:16:17:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:pre-election experimental conditions, confirming that the randomization was successful.  The first
18:697:49985:17:16:72:540:633:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:four columns of Figure 1 display our main findings from the pre-election experiment.  In the control
18:698:50085:16:17:72:540:617:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:condition before the election, we observe a large and statistically significant wedge between dona-
18:699:50184:17:16:72:540:600:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tion rates in private and in public:  a drop from 54% in private to 34% in public (the p-value of a
18:700:50283:16:16:72:540:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:t test of equality is 0.002).  Among individuals in the information condition, we observe no differ-
18:701:50383:16:17:72:540:568:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ence in private and public donation rates, which are 47% and 46%, respectively (p-value=0.839).
18:702:50478:17:16:72:540:551:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Moreover, we find no significant difference in private donation rates between the information and
18:703:50575:16:17:72:540:535:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:control conditions (p-value=0.280), suggesting that the information is not increasing privately-held
18:704:50675:17:16:72:540:518:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:xenophobia.  The increase in public donation rates between the two conditions is statistically sig-
18:705:50774:16:17:72:540:502:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:nificant (p-value=0.089), as is the difference in differences between donation rates in private across
18:706:50876:17:16:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:conditions and donation rates in public across conditions (p-value=0.050).  These results indicate
18:707:50974:16:16:72:540:469:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that the information provided causally increased the social acceptability of the action to the point
18:708:51074:16:17:72:540:453:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of eliminating the original social stigma associated with it.  The first two columns of Table 1 display
18:709:51177:17:16:72:540:436:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the difference in differences results in regression format and show that our results are unchanged
18:710:51275:16:17:72:540:420:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:when individual covariates are included.  The table also displays p-values from permutation tests,
18:711:51373:17:16:72:371:403:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:showing that our findings are robust to that inference method.
18:712:51435:16:17:88:539:387:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:As an additional way of examining the effect of Trump’s increased popularity on public expres-
18:713:51529:17:16:72:540:370:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sion  of  the  xenophobic  action,  we  compare  the  private  and  public  donation  rates  in  the  control
18:714:51638:16:17:72:540:354:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:condition before and after the election.  In the last two columns of Figure 1, we analyze the actions
18:715:51739:17:16:72:540:337:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of respondents who participated in both waves of the experiment.  Though we focus on a subset of
18:716:51835:16:16:72:540:321:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the original participants, we find no evidence of selective attrition, and the samples in the different
18:717:51938:16:17:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:conditions  (before  and  after)  are  again  well  balanced  (see  Appendix  Table  A.2).   In  private,  we
18:718:52047:17:16:72:540:288:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:again observe no increase in donation rates (54% before the election and 49% after the election,
18:719:52143:16:17:72:540:272:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:p-value=0.440).  In public, we observe a significant increase from 34% before the election to 48%
18:720:52240:17:16:72:540:255:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:after it (p-value=0.060).  The difference in differences between donation rates in private before and
18:721:52341:16:17:72:540:239:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:after the election and donation rates in public before and after the election in the control condition
18:722:52443:17:16:72:540:222:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is  also  statistically  significant  (p-value=0.062).   It  is  worth  emphasizing  that  the  donation  rates
18:723:52554:16:16:72:540:206:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:following  the  two  different  “treatments”  (either  experimental  or  natural)  are  extremely  similar:
18:724:52661:16:17:72:540:190:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:47% vs.  49% in private, and 46% vs.  48% in public.  The last two columns of Table 1 display the
18:725:52758:17:16:72:540:173:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:results in regression format, and again confirm that the findings are robust to using permutation
18:726:52855:16:17:72:540:157:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tests.  Our results are also robust to different samples for the post-election experiment, such as also
18:727:52958:17:16:72:386:140:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f6:B:including new participants, as displayed in Appendix Table A.3.11
18:728:53023:16:14:80:539:124:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:11If we restrict the analysis to the 274 subjects who followed the registered protocol results are directionally similar:
18:729:53144:14:11:72:540:110:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:raw donation rates are respectively, for the the private and public groups, 54% and 35% in the control condition before
18:730:53263:11:0:72:540:99:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:the election, 50% and 39% in the information condition before the election, and 39% and 45% in the control condition

19:732:53396:24:23:72:231:666:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:C:3.4.1    Potential Mechanisms
19:733:53425:23:17:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:In the experimental intervention before the election, the information provided to participants gen-
19:734:53524:17:16:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:erated a positive (or null) update in their beliefs about Trump’s local popularity.  Although this
19:735:53622:16:17:72:540:610:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:might have also updated a participant’s belief regarding whether the surveyor is a xenophobe, we
19:736:53718:17:16:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:believe that the main effect of the information shock was to update a participant’s belief about
19:737:53814:16:16:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the surveyor’s priors about the share of xenophobes around the participant.  While we don’t have
19:738:53910:16:17:72:540:561:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a direct measure of this belief about the surveyor’s prior, we elicited the update in participants’
19:739:54009:17:16:72:540:544:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:beliefs about the share of xenophobes in their home state – a good proxy for the other variable.  For
19:740:54110:16:17:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the proxy to be valid, we need the update in participants’ beliefs about the share of xenophobes
19:741:54206:17:16:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in their state to go in thesame directionas the update in their beliefs about the surveyor’s beliefs
19:742:54306:16:17:72:383:495:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:about that same share.  We believe this a reasonable assumption.
19:743:54370:17:16:88:539:478:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Figure 2 provides evidence that the information shock led to a positive update in beliefs about
19:744:54465:16:17:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the opinions about other individuals in the same state.  In the control condition before the election,
19:745:54567:17:16:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the average guess was that 64% of other people in the participant’s home state would agree with the
19:746:54666:16:16:72:540:429:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:xenophobic statement, while it was 68% in the information condition (p-value=0.062).  This small
19:747:54762:16:17:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:increase in the average guess might not fully display the impact that the information intervention
19:748:54860:17:16:72:540:396:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:had on thedistributionof beliefs about others.  The distribution in the information condition first-
19:749:54960:16:17:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:order  stochastically  dominates  the  distribution  in  the  control  condition  (a  Kolmogorov-Smirnov
19:750:55064:17:16:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:test of equality of the two distributions yields a p-value of 0.072).  For example,  the percentage
19:751:55163:16:17:72:540:347:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of participants who think that the share of those agreeing with the xenophobic statement in their
19:752:55260:17:16:72:540:330:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:state is above 90% increases substantially with the provision of information (from 9% to 17%, with
19:753:55358:16:16:72:164:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a p-value of 0.018).
19:754:55378:16:17:88:539:298:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:When  we  analyze  the  effects  of  Trump’s  actual  victory  on  the  social  stigma  associated  with
19:755:55482:17:16:72:539:281:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  donation  decision,  it  is  less  clearex  antethat  an  update  in  respondents’  beliefs  about  the
19:756:55590:16:17:71:539:265:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:surveyor’s  priors  regarding  the  share  of  xenophobes  in  the  respondents’  state  would  the  main
19:757:55695:17:16:71:539:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:driver of the findings.  After the election,  the surveyor is not directly providing any information
19:758:55795:16:17:71:539:232:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that would necessarily lead to an unambiguously weakly positive update in perceptions of Trump’s
19:759:55891:17:16:71:539:215:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:local  popularity.   For  example,  participants  might  now  believe  that  Trump’s  actual  margin  of
19:760:55995:16:16:71:539:199:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:victory in their state might was smaller than what the surveyor had originally expected.  Indeed,
19:761:56092:16:17:71:539:183:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:when comparing the pre-election control group with the group after the election, we find no shift in
19:762:56192:17:20:71:539:166:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the distribution of beliefs about the share of xenophobes in participants’ home states (see Appendix
19:763:56292:20:11:72:540:146:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:after the election.  As with the full sample, the wedge between the public and private condition is significant in the
19:764:56410:11:11:72:540:135:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:control condition before the election (p-value 0.018), and not significant in the information condition (p-value 0.219),

19:766:56651:11:11:72:540:113:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:and donation rates in public across conditions is smaller than in the full sample and not significant before the election
19:767:56772:11:0:72:428:102:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:(8.4%, p-value 0.486), but large and significant after the election (24.9%, p-value 0.068).
20:768:56865:0:17:72:540:690:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Figure A.1). However, there is an unambiguously weakly positive update in participants’ perception
20:769:56963:17:16:72:540:673:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of  Trump’snationalpopularity.   According  to  our  model,  this  will  increase  the  probability  that
20:770:57068:16:17:72:540:657:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:participants:  (i) think that the surveyor is xenophobic, and (ii) think that the surveyor will judge
20:771:57169:17:16:72:540:640:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:them less negatively even if the researcher is not xenophobic.  Hence, although we do not provide
20:772:57266:16:16:72:540:624:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:direct evidence of these mechanisms, the nature of the intervention suggests that these two elements
20:773:57366:16:32:72:526:608:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are the likely drivers of the findings in the comparison of pre- and post-election donation rates.
20:774:57464:32:24:72:296:576:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:C:3.4.2    Further Interpreting the Findings
20:775:57506:24:16:72:540:552:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Although  the  effects  we  find  are  extremely  large,  it  is  important  to  note  that  they  are  coming
20:776:57616:16:17:72:540:536:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:from  a  marginal  positive  signal  of  Trump’s  local  popularity  starting  from  a  situation  where  he
20:777:57724:17:16:72:540:519:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:was already believed to be extremely popular locally.  Even in the control condition, the average
20:778:57821:16:16:72:540:503:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:individual believes that 64% of people in his/her state agree with the xenophobic statement, and
20:779:57917:16:17:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:34% of participants make the donation in public.  Though we cannot test this hypothesis, perhaps
20:780:58013:17:16:72:540:470:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:an increase in the perceived popularity of holding xenophobic views and a reduction of the related
20:781:58111:16:17:72:540:454:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:social  stigma  might  have  already  taken  place  throughout  the  presidential  campaign,  before  the
20:782:58216:17:16:72:540:437:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:experiment took place.  It is also possible that the statement we chose might have been perceived as
20:783:58316:16:17:72:540:421:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:relatively mild toward the end of the campaign period, so the small update in beliefs about the views
20:784:58417:17:16:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of others regarding the chosen statement could correspond to larger updates for a more extreme
20:785:58511:16:16:72:540:388:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:statement.  Of course, we cannot estimate how large the effects of our experiment would have been
20:786:58608:16:17:72:540:372:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:had the baseline level of Trump’s perceived local popularity been lower (as in the beginning of the
20:787:58707:17:16:72:398:355:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:campaign season) and thus the effect of the signal possibly stronger.
20:788:58776:16:17:88:539:339:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Finally, we can rule out that our main effect is coming from participants updating their beliefs
20:789:58872:17:16:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:about the instrumental benefits associated with donating to the organization (for example, because
20:790:58970:16:17:72:540:306:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the organization is now more likely to fulfill its mission).  Any effect explained by that factor would
20:791:59073:17:38:72:309:289:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:have showed up in the private donation rates too.

20:795:59244:24:16:72:540:176:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:In late February 2017, we recruited participants from the six states in which Hillary Clinton won
20:796:59341:16:16:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  presidential  election  with  the  highest  margin:  California,  Hawaii,  Maryland,  Massachusetts,
20:797:59446:16:17:72:540:144:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:New York, and Vermont.  This was done to maximize the chances of recruiting subjects with liberal
20:798:59543:17:16:72:389:127:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f6:B:views, and in particular subjects with no anti-Muslim sentiment.12
20:799:59609:16:15:80:539:111:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:12As in the main experiment, Turk workers with at least 80% approval rate could see our request, which in this case
20:800:59724:15:0:72:540:96:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:was described as a “4-5 minutes short survey” with a reward of $0.50.  Each worker could participate in the survey
21:801:59840:0:17:88:539:690:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:First, after answering a number of demographic questions, all participants were explained that a
21:802:59936:17:16:72:540:673:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:minaret is a tower typically built adjacent to a mosque and traditionally used for the Muslim call to
21:803:60037:16:17:72:540:657:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:prayer.  Second, they were asked whether they would support the introduction of a law prohibiting
21:804:60134:17:16:72:540:640:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  building  of  minarets  in  their  state.   We  focus  on  subjects  who  reported  to  be  against  the
21:805:60243:16:16:72:540:624:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:introduction  of  this  law  (N  =  396),  and  we  examine  how  they  interact  with  a  person  who  has
21:806:60350:16:17:72:540:608:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:opposite views.  In order to do so, in the third part of the survey, participants were told they were
21:807:60451:17:16:72:540:591:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:matched  with  a  subject  from  another  survey  and  were  asked  to  play  a  dictator  game  in  which
21:808:60557:16:17:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:they  could  decide  how  to  split  $3  (half  of  an  hourly  wage  on  the  platform)  between  themselves
21:809:60666:17:16:72:540:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and the other participant.  We randomly assigned our participants to three different groups and
21:810:60761:16:17:72:540:542:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:randomized the background information we gave to our participants about the person they were
21:811:60853:17:16:72:540:525:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:matched  with.   Participants  in  the  control  group  were  only  told  that  the  participant  they  were
21:812:60961:16:17:72:540:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:matched with was a 24-year-old male from Switzerland.  Note that we used real 24-year-old male
21:813:61055:17:16:72:540:492:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:subjects from Switzerland recruited to take part of a short survey by a research assistant from the
21:814:61154:16:16:72:171:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:University of Zurich.
21:815:61175:16:17:88:539:460:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Participants  in  theanti-minaretsgroup  were  additionally  told  that  this  person  supports  the
21:816:61275:17:16:72:540:443:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:B:prohibition of the building of minarets in Switzerland.  Participants in theanti-minarets,  public
21:817:61373:16:17:72:540:427:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:supportgroup were instead told that “like 57.5% of Swiss respondents,  the participant supports
21:818:61468:17:31:72:355:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the prohibition of the building of minarets in Switzerland.”

21:820:61584:24:16:72:540:355:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:B:If we find higher donations in theAnti-minarets, public support group, when compared to theanti-
21:821:61680:16:17:72:540:339:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:minarets, we can conclude that the participants may believe that the Swiss person has strategic
21:822:61775:17:16:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:reasons to state that he is anti-minarets, and for this reason judge him less for expressing that view.
21:823:61878:16:17:72:540:306:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:However, a potential alternative interpretation for this result is that participants might judge the
21:824:61978:17:16:72:539:289:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:B:Swiss person less negatively when the majority of Swiss support the ban,regardless of whether his
21:825:62075:16:17:72:540:273:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:support  was  expressed  in  public.For example, it could be that participants feel that they cannot
21:826:62175:17:16:72:540:256:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:blame a person for privately holding a view if that person is surrounded by many other people who
21:827:62272:16:16:72:508:240:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:also hold that view and who could also have influenced the private opinions of that person.
21:828:62363:16:17:88:539:224:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:To explicitly rule out this possibility, we conducted a slightly modified version of our protocol on
21:829:62463:17:16:72:540:207:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the days immediately following the first wave of the dictator game experiment.  In the second wave,
21:830:62562:16:17:72:540:191:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:participants were informed about the fact that the 24-year-old male from Switzerland expressed his
21:831:62660:17:16:72:540:174:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:opinion in ananonymoussurvey.  As in the original version, we recruited participants from the six
21:832:62757:16:17:72:540:158:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:states in which Hillary Clinton won the presidential election with the highest margin (California,

21:834:62949:20:11:72:540:121:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:only once.  Workers who clicked on the request were displayed detailed instructions about the task, and given access

22:837:63295:0:17:72:540:690:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:participants, we also included six other states with a high share of votes for Clinton (Connecticut,
22:838:63395:17:16:72:383:673:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f6:B:Delaware, Illinois, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Washington).13
22:839:63459:16:17:88:539:657:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The  design  of  this  experiment  was  almost  identical  to  the  original  version.   Once  again,  we
22:840:63564:17:16:72:540:640:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:focus on subjects who reported to be against the introduction of the ban (N = 427).  The main
22:841:63657:16:16:72:540:624:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:difference  with  the  original  version,  is  that  we  emphasized  how  the  Swiss  participant  expressed
22:842:63765:16:17:72:540:608:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:his opinion anonymously.  Instead of writing as before that “we matched you with a participant
22:843:63859:17:16:72:540:591:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:from another survey”, in this version we wrote “we matched you with a participant from another
22:844:63953:16:17:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:anonymous survey.” In our treatment groups we emphasized once again that the survey the Swiss

22:854:64832:16:16:72:540:388:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:regarding the share of the Swiss population who supports banning the construction of minarets,
22:855:64926:16:17:72:540:372:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and  whether  they  believed  the  ban  is  legal  in  Switzerland.   In  the  first  wave  we  did  not  collect
22:856:65039:17:16:72:540:355:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:this information for individuals in theanti-minaretsandanti-minarets public supportgroups.  To

22:867:66163:7:15:80:539:207:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:14Our design also included a fourth group (N=136 in wave 1, and N=139 in wave 2), where participants were instead

22:872:66768:11:11:72:540:148:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:illegal in Switzerland, following a 2009 referendum.  According to numbers from 2009, 57.5% of Swiss respondents
22:873:66880:11:10:72:540:137:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:are in favor of prohibiting the building of minarets.  However, the person you are matched with did not vote in the

22:875:67108:11:11:72:540:116:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:information that a view is not only held by a majority but is alsoofficialwould additionally change the donation
22:876:67220:11:11:72:540:105:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:rates.  We found no effect of this additional treatment relative to the second treatment group.  We report these results
22:877:67340:11:0:72:209:94:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:in Appendix Figures A.2 and A.3.

23:879:67472:17:16:72:540:673:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of the test of equality are 0.000 against both groups).  The median belief about the share of the
23:880:67569:16:17:72:540:657:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Swiss population supporting the ban is 30% in both control andanti-minaretsgroups, and 55% in
23:881:67662:17:16:72:539:640:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:theanti-minarets public supportgroup.  This confirms that our experimental manipulation indeed
23:882:67756:16:16:72:445:624:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f6:B:shifted beliefs about the level of popular support for the ban in Switzerland.15
23:883:67836:16:17:88:540:608:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Participants across conditions were also asked whether they believed the construction of minarets
23:884:67933:17:16:72:540:591:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is legal in Switzerland:  across the three groups, the majority reported to think that constructing
23:885:68032:16:17:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:minarets  was  legal  (88%  in  the  control  group,  77%  in  theanti-minaretsgroup,  and  74%  in  the
23:886:68136:17:16:72:540:558:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:anti-minarets  public  supportgroup).16We can thus rule out that the effects are affected by the
23:887:68232:16:17:72:540:542:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:fact that the ban is actually legal, and can thus isolate the role of public opinion on participants’
23:888:68333:17:32:72:213:525:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:judgment of the Swiss player.
23:889:68362:32:23:72:424:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:C:4.2  Linking the Experiment to the Theoretical Framework
23:890:68418:23:29:72:397:470:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We have the following predictions, which help us test Proposition 3.
23:891:68486:29:16:88:539:441:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f4:A:•Anti-minaretsgroup:  The  Swiss  person  is  revealed  to  be  anti-minarets.   The  participants’
23:892:68585:16:17:99:540:425:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:prior that Swiss people are on average anti-minarets is relatively low. This has two implica-
23:893:68678:17:16:99:540:408:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:tions.  First, before the information about the Swiss person is communicated, the perceived
23:894:68769:16:16:99:540:392:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:probability that he is anti-minarets is low.  Second, and more importantly, he is not thought
23:895:68862:16:17:99:540:376:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:to have strategic reasons to pretend to be anti-minarets, because this view is not thought to
23:896:68955:17:16:99:540:359:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:be popular among citizens in Switzerland (the subjects believe that the equilibrium that this
23:897:69048:16:17:99:539:343:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Swiss person faces would imply that he will only saymi=Aif he indeed has typeti=A).
23:898:69131:17:16:99:540:326:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Thus, the posterior that this person is anti-minarets increases all the way to 1.  This lowers
23:899:69225:16:26:99:326:310:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:donations when compared to the control group.
23:900:69270:26:16:88:539:284:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f4:A:•Anti-minarets,  public  supportgroup:  The Swiss person is revealed to be anti-minarets, and
23:901:69363:16:16:99:540:268:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:also we also reveal that 57% of Swiss respondents support banning minarets.  Now, compared
23:902:69453:16:17:99:540:252:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:to the previous experimental condition, the participants may believe that the Swiss person
23:903:69543:17:16:99:539:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:has strategic reasons to state that he is anti-minarets. This decreases Prj(ti=A|mi=A)
23:904:69629:16:17:99:539:219:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:from 1 to some value which, however, must be greater than12, as follows from Proposition 3.
23:905:69720:17:16:99:540:202:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:This implies that donations should be higher than in the previous treatment group, but not
23:906:69810:16:16:99:249:186:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:as high as in the control group.
23:907:69842:16:15:80:539:170:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:15Here we report the numbers from the second wave of the experiment, since the first wave only asked beliefs in
23:908:69953:15:11:72:540:155:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:the control group.  The numbers for this group are very similar across waves; for example, in the first wave, 17% of
23:909:70069:11:11:72:540:144:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:control group participants believe a majority of Swiss people support the ban, compared to 20% in the second wave.
23:910:70183:11:7:72:326:133:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:The median belief is 30% for the control groups in both waves.
23:911:70245:7:15:80:539:126:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:16While the beliefs are significantly different when comparing the control group with either of the two treatment
23:912:70358:15:11:72:540:111:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:groups (the p-values for the test of equality are 0.013 against theanonymous anti-minaretsgroup and 0.002 against
23:913:70471:11:11:72:540:100:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:theanonymous anti-minarets public support group), there is no statistical difference between the two treatment groups
23:914:70588:11:0:72:253:89:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:(the p-value for the test of equality is 0.500).
24:915:70638:0:17:99:540:690:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The second wave of the experiment helps us further test our model and rule out the main
24:916:70725:17:25:99:222:673:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:alternative interpretation:

24:918:70841:17:16:99:540:631:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Again, subjects’ prior that Swiss people are on average anti-minarets is relatively low.  The
24:919:70934:16:16:99:540:615:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:posterior that the Swiss player is anti-minarets is 1,  so donations should be similar to the
24:920:71027:16:26:99:254:599:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:ones in theAnti-minarets group.
24:921:71058:26:16:88:539:573:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f5:A:•Anonymous  anti-minarets,  public  supportgroup:   The  Swiss  person  is  revealed  to  bepri-
24:922:71154:16:17:99:540:557:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:A:vatelyanti-minarets, and also we also reveal that 57% of Swiss respondents support banning
24:923:71244:17:16:99:540:540:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:minarets.  Unlike the non-anonymous version of this treatment, participants do not think the
24:924:71336:16:17:99:540:524:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Swiss person has strategic reasons to state that he is anti-minarets, since the expression is
24:925:71429:17:16:99:540:507:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:anonymous.  As a result, the posterior that the Swiss player is against anti-minarets is again
24:926:71523:16:32:99:480:491:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:1 and the donation levels should be similar to those in theAnti-minarets group.
24:927:71602:32:24:72:146:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:C:4.3  Results
24:928:71614:24:16:72:540:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Appendix Table A.4 provides a test of balance of individual characteristics across all six conditions
24:929:71715:16:17:72:540:419:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:from the two waves and separately for the three conditions of each wave.  Although the two waves
24:930:71811:17:16:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:were  not  conducted  simultaneously,  the  variables  are  fairly  well-balanced  when  pooling  the  two
24:931:71917:16:16:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:waves.   Only  the  share  of  white  respondents  is  marginally  unbalanced  (p-value  of  0.085).   As
24:932:72022:16:17:72:540:370:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a result, to simplify the exposition of our findings, below we pool the observations in the control
24:933:72121:17:16:72:540:353:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:groups from the two waves, and compare the raw outcome variables across the two waves. Appendix
24:934:72216:16:17:72:540:337:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Figures A.4 and A.5 display the results separately for the two waves of the experiment and show
24:935:72311:17:16:72:383:320:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that the numbers are almost identical for the two control groups.
24:936:72376:16:17:88:539:304:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We now turn to the main findings from the auxiliary experiment, displayed in Figure 3.  Panel
24:937:72469:17:16:72:540:287:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:A displays comparisons of average donations across groups.  In the control condition, where partic-
24:938:72568:16:16:72:540:271:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ipants are only told that they are matched with a 24-year-old male from Switzerland, we observe
24:939:72663:16:17:72:540:255:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:an average transfer to the Swiss participant of $1.03.  The average transfer is substantially lower
24:940:72762:17:16:72:539:238:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for subjects in theanti-minaretsgroup, who are also told that this person supports the prohibition
24:941:72860:16:17:72:540:222:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on  building  minarets  in  Switzerland:  the  average  transfer  for  this  group  is  $0.69.   The  effect  of
24:942:72972:17:16:72:540:205:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:informing subject about the anti-Muslim views of the Swiss participant is statistically significant
24:943:73071:16:17:72:540:189:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:B:(p-value=0.000).  However, the average transfer among subjects in theanti-minarets, public support
24:944:73169:17:16:72:540:172:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:group who are told that the majority of Swiss respondents are against minarets is $0.92,  which
24:945:73264:16:17:72:540:156:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is not statistically different from the average transfer in the control group (the p-value of the dif-
24:946:73366:17:16:72:539:139:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ference is 0.162) but is substantially higher than the average transfer in theanti-minaretsgroup
24:947:73462:16:16:72:539:123:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(p-value=0.013).  The average donation in theanonymous anti-minaretsgroup is identical to that
24:948:73556:16:17:72:539:107:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:B:in theanti-minaretsgroup, at $0.69.  The average donation in theanonymous anti-minarets, public
24:949:73651:17:0:72:539:90:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:supportgroup is also very similar:  $0.70.  These two levels are significantly different from the av-
25:950:73754:0:17:72:540:690:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:B:erage in the control group (p-value=0.000 in both cases).  The average donation in theanonymous

25:952:73950:16:17:72:233:657:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of the treatment (p-value=0.014).
25:953:73983:17:16:88:540:640:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Panel B compares across conditions the share of participants who donotshare any of their $3
25:954:74074:16:16:71:539:624:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:endowment with the Swiss person.  The percentage of participants deciding not to transfer anything
25:955:74172:16:17:71:539:608:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to the Swiss respondent increases from 22% in the control group to 42% in theanti-minaretsgroup

25:957:74368:16:17:71:539:575:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:This percentage is not statistically different from the one in the control group (p-value=0.370), but
25:958:74469:17:16:71:539:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is substantially lower than the one for subjects in theanti-minaretsgroup (p-value=0.013).  Here
25:959:74565:16:17:72:540:542:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:again,  the  levels  of  the  outcome  variable  in  the  two  anonymous  treatments  are  almost  identical
25:960:74673:17:16:72:539:525:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to  the  level  in  theanti-minaretsgroup:  43%  and  44%.   Importantly,  the  share  of  participants
25:961:74776:16:17:72:540:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:not  donating  is  significantly  higher  in  theanonymous  anti-minarets,  public  supportgroup  when
25:962:74878:17:16:72:430:492:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:compared to the non-anonymous version of the treatment (p-value=0.004).
25:963:74949:16:16:88:539:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Panel C displays a similar pattern for the median transfer, which is $1.50 in the control group,

25:974:75939:17:16:88:539:295:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Overall, across all three outcome variables, the results confirm the four predictions stemming
25:975:76033:16:17:72:540:279:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:from the model.  Appendix Table A.5 displays the results in regression format and show that our

25:977:76190:38:27:72:173:224:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:C:5  Conclusion
25:978:76203:27:16:72:540:197:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We show that a positive update in people’s beliefs about Donald Trump’s popularity increases their
25:979:76301:16:17:72:540:181:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:willingness to publicly express xenophobic views.  Building on a simple model of communication
25:980:76395:17:16:72:540:164:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and on a second auxiliary experiment with a dictator game, we also provide suggestive evidence of
25:981:76492:16:17:72:540:148:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the mechanisms behind the effects.  By aggregating information about individuals’ private views,
25:982:76588:17:16:72:540:131:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:elections  can  update  positively  people’s  perceptions  about  the  share  of  people  who  support  an
25:983:76694:16:17:72:540:115:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:opinion previously believed to be stigmatized.  This may in turn change people’s perceptions about
25:984:76792:17:0:72:388:98:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the negative judgement they will face for expressing their opinion.
26:985:76861:0:17:88:539:690:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Though beyond the scope of our study,  the potential interaction between private and public
26:986:76952:17:16:72:540:673:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:opinions might exacerbate the effects of events that trigger changes in the social acceptability of
26:987:77051:16:17:72:540:657:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:holding particular views.  Moreover, higher electoral support for a candidate associated with certain
26:988:77152:17:16:72:540:640:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:views might shape individuals’ perceptions of the social desirability of those views,  regardless of
26:989:77252:16:16:72:298:624:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:whether or not the candidate wins the election.
26:990:77299:16:17:88:539:608:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Our  findings  shed  light  on  the  factors  that  can  trigger  rapid  change  in  social  norms,  and  in
26:991:77407:17:16:72:540:591:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:particular,  norms  against  the  expression  of  xenophobic  views.   Our  results  suggest  that  social
26:992:77513:16:17:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:norms regarding the expression of such views in the U.S. might have already been causally changed
26:993:77610:17:16:72:540:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:by Trump’s rise in popularity and eventual electoral victory.  More broadly,  the mechanisms we
26:994:77705:16:17:72:540:542:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:study  in  this  paper  might  help  explain  the  rise  –  and  potential  consequences  –  of  other  crucial
26:995:77816:17:16:72:540:525:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:recent events such as the Brexit vote in the UK, and more generally the rise in anti-immigrant and
26:996:77914:16:0:72:300:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:anti-minority sentiment in the developed world.

34:1185:89172:17:16:72:539:393:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and Prj(ti=A|mi=B) =q ̃zq ̃z+1−q.  Therefore, the utility of a citizenidefined above (and also of

34:1192:89380:32:16:71:135:294:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We thus have

34:1197:89431:28:16:72:540:250:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f9:B:Sinceq≥12, we haveUi(mi=A)≥Ui(mi=B), which contradicts the earlier result that citizeni
34:1198:89518:16:17:71:491:234:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:strictly prefers to send messageB.  This proves that ifq≥12, then in equilibrium  ̃z= 0.
34:1199:89606:17:16:88:539:217:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We can similarly prove that ifq≤12, then in equilibriumz= 0.  Applying both results to the
34:1200:89696:16:17:72:539:201:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:caseq=12, we have thatz=  ̃z= 0, so (almost) all types communicate truthfully.  This proves the
34:1201:89791:17:16:72:206:184:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:first part of the proposition.
34:1202:89821:16:17:88:539:168:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Now  consider  the  caseq  >12.   We  have  already  proved  that   ̃z=  0  in  this  case.   Suppose,

34:1206:90174:17:0:72:519:102:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is strictly preferred for type (ti=B, li= 0), which contradictsz= 0.  This implies thatz >0.
35:1207:90268:0:17:88:540:690:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Now  suppose  thatz=  1,  implying  that  (almost)  all  types  send  messageA.   In  this  case,

35:1209:90443:16:17:71:540:657:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ever,  applying  the  D1  criterion,  we  have  that  the  type  (ti=B, li= 1)  is  the  one  that  bene-

35:1214:90768:30:16:71:539:545:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:This  type  weakly  prefers  to  send  messageAif  and  only  ifaq(2q−1)≥1.   This  implies  that
35:1215:90865:16:17:71:540:529:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:an equilibrium with   ̃z= 0 andz= 1,  where (almost) all senders sendmi=A,  is only possible

35:1217:91050:16:17:72:124:496:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:conditions.
35:1218:91061:17:16:88:539:479:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Suppose thatz∈(0,1).  This is only possible if the type (ti=B, li=z) is indifferent between

35:1223:91419:16:17:71:540:371:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:root and exactly one negative root.  Consequently,z∈(0,1) is only possible ifaq(2q−1)<1, in

35:1225:91610:16:17:71:539:338:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:an equilibrium.  To finish the proof for the caseq >12, it suffices to observe thataq(2q−1)−1≥0
