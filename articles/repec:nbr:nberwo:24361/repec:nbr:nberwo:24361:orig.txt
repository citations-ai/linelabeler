2:36:2199:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:We study the effects of enabling peer supply through Airbnb in the accommodation industry. We 
2:37:2293:14:14:72:545:574:12:Times:12:Times:present a  model  of  competition  between  flexible  and  dedicated  sellers  -  peer  hosts  and  hotels  - 
2:38:2402:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:who provide differentiated products. We estimate this model using data from major US cities and 
2:39:2497:14:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:quantify  the  welfare effects  of  Airbnb  on  travelers,  hosts,  and  hotels.  The  welfare  gains  are 
2:40:2603:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:concentrated  in  locations  (New York)  and  times  (New  Years  Eve)  when  hotels  are  capacity 
2:41:2702:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:constrained.  This  occurs  because  peer hosts  are  responsive  to  market  conditions,  expand  supply 
2:42:2807:14:42:71:336:504:12:Times:12:Times:as hotels fill up, and keep hotel prices down as a result.

3:57:3154:0:30:72:208:708:296:g_d0_f2:296:g_d0_f2:1  Introduction
3:58:3169:30:18:72:540:678:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:The Internet has greatly reduced entry and advertising costs across a variety of industries.
3:59:3261:18:18:72:540:660:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:As an example, peer-to-peer marketplaces such as Airbnb, Uber, and Etsy currently provide
3:60:3350:18:18:72:540:642:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:aplatformforsmallandpart-timepeerproviders to sell their goods and services. Several
3:61:3434:18:18:72:540:624:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:of these marketplaces have grown quickly and become widely known brands. In this pa-
3:62:3518:18:18:72:540:606:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:per, we study the determinants and e↵ects of peer production in the market for short-term
3:63:3607:18:18:72:540:588:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:accommodation, where Airbnb is the main peer-to-peer platform and hotels are incumbent
3:64:3693:18:18:72:120:570:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:suppliers.
3:65:3703:18:18:89:538:552:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:We present a theoretical model of competition between incumbent hotels and peer hosts.
3:66:3789:18:18:72:540:534:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:We then use data from top US cities to test the model hypotheses about the entry of peer
3:67:3877:18:17:72:540:516:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:supply, and to quantify the e↵ects of this entry on travelers, incumbent hotels, and peer
3:68:3966:17:18:72:540:499:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:hosts. We find that Airbnb generated$41 of consumer surplus per room-night and$26 of
3:69:4050:18:18:72:540:481:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:host surplus while reducing variable hotel profits from accommodations by up to 3.7%. This
3:70:4140:18:18:72:539:463:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:resulted in a total welfare gain of$137 million in 2014 from Airbnb in these cities and this
3:71:4232:18:18:72:540:445:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:e↵ect was concentrated in locations (New York) and times (New Years Eve) where hotel
3:72:4316:18:18:72:203:427:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:capacity was constrained.
3:73:4341:18:18:89:539:409:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Since its founding in 2008, Airbnb has grown to list more rooms than any hotel group in
3:74:4428:18:18:72:540:391:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:the world. Yet Airbnb’s growth across cities and over time has been highly heterogeneous,
3:75:4517:18:18:72:540:373:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:with supply shares ranging from over 15% to less than 1% across major US cities at the end
3:76:4607:18:18:72:540:355:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:of 2014. Airbnb’s entry has also prompted policy discussion and varied regulation in many
3:77:4696:18:18:72:540:337:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:cities across the world. In order to understand Airbnb’s growth and its e↵ects, we propose
3:78:4786:18:18:72:544:319:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:asimpledemandandsupplyframeworkwhereaccommodationscanbeprovidedbyeither
3:79:4857:18:18:72:330:301:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:dedicated or flexible supply – hotels vs peer hosts.
3:80:4909:18:18:89:539:283:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:The role of Airbnb in our framework is to lower entry costs for peer hosts. This reduction
3:81:4999:18:17:72:540:265:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:in entry costs is similar across cities but the benefits of hosting travelers vary. Prices and
3:82:5093:17:18:72:540:248:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:occupancy rates, as well as marginal costs a↵ect the benefits of hosting travelers. In the
3:83:5183:18:18:72:540:230:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:long run, our model predicts higher entry of peer supply in cities with higher prices and
3:84:5272:18:18:72:540:212:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:occupancy rates, and lower peers’ marginal costs. Prices and occupancy rates are in turn
3:85:5360:18:18:72:540:194:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:determined by the trend and variability in the number of travelers, as well as geographic and
3:86:5453:18:18:72:540:176:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:bureaucratic constraints to the expansion of hotel capacity. Marginal costs are determined
3:87:5543:18:18:72:540:158:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:by the perceived risk of hosting strangers, which is higher for families with children than for
3:88:5638:18:18:72:540:140:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:unmarried and childless adults. We confirm that these predictions hold in the 50 largest US
3:89:5729:18:18:72:540:122:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:cities in terms of hotel rooms. The entry of flexible supply is higher in cities like New York,
3:90:5824:18:18:72:540:104:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:where demand is growing and highly variable, where hotels are constrained from expanding
3:91:5912:18:0:72:532:86:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:room capacity, and where peer hosts have lower marginal costs than in cities like Atlanta.
4:92:6003:0:18:89:539:708:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:In the short-run, peer producers decide whether to host on a particular day. Because
4:93:6087:18:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:of the flexible nature of their supply, we hypothesize that these producers will be highly
4:94:6177:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:responsive to market conditions, hosting travelers when prices are high, and using accommo-
4:95:6268:18:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:dation for private use when prices are low. In contrast, because hotels have a fixed number
4:96:6359:18:18:72:540:636:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:of rooms dedicated to travelers’ accommodation, they will typically choose to transact even
4:97:6450:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:when demand is relatively low, while they won’t be able to expand capacity during peaks
4:98:6537:18:18:72:539:600:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:in demand. These di↵erences imply that peer supply elasticity should be higher than ho-
4:99:6624:18:18:72:540:582:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:tels’ supply elasticity on average. We validate this prediction by estimating a peer supply
4:100:6715:18:18:72:329:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:elasticity that is twice as high as hotels’ elasticity.
4:101:6770:18:18:89:539:546:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:The heterogeneous entry of peer hosts across cities and over time has surplus implications.
4:102:6861:18:18:72:539:528:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:We estimate our short-run equilibrium model to quantify the e↵ect of Airbnb on total welfare
4:103:6953:18:18:72:540:510:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:and its distribution across travelers, peer hosts, and hotels. Travelers benefit from Airbnb
4:104:7045:18:18:72:540:492:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:for two reasons. First, flexible sellers o↵er a di↵erentiated product relative to hotels. Second,
4:105:7142:18:17:72:539:474:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:they also compete with hotels by expanding the number of rooms available. This second e↵ect
4:106:7233:17:18:72:540:457:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:is particularly important in periods of high demand when hotels are capacity constrained
4:107:7321:18:18:72:540:439:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:and can thus charge higher prices.  Consequently, we find that the increase in consumer
4:108:7408:18:18:72:540:421:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:surplus from Airbnb is concentrated in city-days of peak demand, which the accommodation
4:109:7496:18:18:72:544:403:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:industry defines ascompression nights.Inthosecitiesandperiods,flexiblesellersallowmore
4:110:7582:18:18:72:539:385:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:travelers to stay in a city without greatly a↵ecting the number of travelers staying at hotels.
4:111:7677:18:18:89:539:367:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Our data mainly come from two sources: proprietary data from Airbnb, and data from
4:112:7759:18:18:72:540:349:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:STR, which tracks supply and demand data for the hotel industry.  We obtain data on
4:113:7842:18:18:72:540:331:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:average prices and rooms sold at a city, day, and accommodation type level between 2011
4:114:7929:18:18:72:538:313:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:and 2014 for the 50 largest US cities.1We first document heterogeneity in the number of
4:115:8016:18:18:72:540:295:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Airbnb listings across cities and over time. Cities like New York and Los Angeles have grown
4:116:8108:18:18:72:540:277:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:more quickly, reaching supply shares exceeding 15% and 5% respectively in 2014, while cities
4:117:8200:18:18:72:540:259:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:like Oklahoma City and Memphis have grown more slowly, with less than 1% supply shares
4:118:8286:18:17:72:540:241:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:at the of 2014. Within each city over time, the number of available rooms is higher during
4:119:8376:17:18:72:540:224:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:peak travel times such as Christmas and the summer. The geographic and time heterogeneity
4:120:8465:18:18:72:540:206:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:suggests that hosts flexibly choose when to list their rooms for rent on Airbnb, and are more
4:121:8558:18:18:72:451:188:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:likely to do so in cities and times when the returns to hosting are highest.

4:124:8793:18:18:72:539:134:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:sellers, and products are di↵erentiated. We include two time-horizons. The long-run hori-
4:125:8882:18:18:72:540:116:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:zon is characterized by the entry decision of flexible sellers given the new Airbnb platform.
4:126:8975:18:18:72:540:98:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:We model the decision of flexible sellers to join the platform as dependent on the expected
4:127:9066:18:0:85:473:80:49:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f9:1The 50 largest US cities were selected on the basis of their total number of hotel rooms.
5:128:9157:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:returns from hosting, which in turn depend on competition from hotels and expected de-
5:129:9243:18:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:mand levels. The short-run horizon focuses on daily prices and quantities of rooms sold.
5:130:9331:18:18:72:539:672:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:We define the short-run horizon as one day in one city.  In the short-run, the capacity of
5:131:9421:18:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:flexible and dedicated sellers is fixed, and overall demand level is realized. Travelers choose
5:132:9516:18:18:72:540:636:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:an accommodation option among di↵erentiated hotel and Airbnb rooms. Hotels maximize
5:133:9599:18:18:72:490:618:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:profits subject to their capacity constraints, while peer hosts take prices as given.
5:134:9684:18:18:89:540:600:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:The model o↵ers testable predictions. The long-run share of flexible sellers should di↵er
5:135:9773:18:18:72:540:582:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:across cities. Entry should be largest in cities where hotel investment costs are high, flexible
5:136:9869:18:18:72:540:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:sellers’ marginal costs are low, and demand variability is high so that there are periods of
5:137:9961:18:18:72:540:546:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:high prices. In the short-run, flexible sellers should increase competition: they will reduce
5:138:10054:18:18:72:540:528:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:prices and occupancy rates of hotels, and the e↵ects will be largest in cities where hotel
5:139:10144:18:18:72:540:510:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:capacity is low relative to demand.  We describe those cities as having constrained hotel
5:140:10233:18:18:72:540:492:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:capacity. In capacity-constrained cities, the model predicts that Airbnb reduces prices more
5:141:10325:18:17:72:402:474:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:than occupancy rates relative to non-capacity-constrained cities.
5:142:10390:17:18:89:544:457:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:In Section3,weconfirmthatthesemodelpredictionsholdinthedata. Wefirstlook
5:143:10462:18:18:72:540:439:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:at the long-run patterns. We show that peer supply as a share of total supply is larger in
5:144:10552:18:18:72:539:421:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:cities where hotel prices are higher. These high prices are associated with the di-culty of
5:145:10643:18:18:72:540:403:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:building hotels due to regulatory or geographic constraints. Peer supply is also larger in
5:146:10733:18:18:72:540:385:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:cities where residents tend to be single and have no children. These residents likely have
5:147:10823:18:18:72:540:367:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:lower costs of hosting strangers in their homes. Another factor influencing peer supply is
5:148:10913:18:18:72:540:349:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:the volatility of demand.  A city can experience periods of high and low demand due to
5:149:10999:18:18:72:539:331:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:seasonality, festivals, or sporting events. When the di↵erence in peaks and troughs is large,
5:150:11092:18:18:72:540:313:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:the provision of accommodation exclusively by hotels can be ine-ciently low. We show that
5:151:11181:18:18:72:540:295:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Airbnb’s supply share is larger precisely in cities with high demand volatility, and, perhaps
5:152:11274:18:18:72:358:277:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:more intuitively, in cities where demand growth is high.
5:153:11330:18:18:89:538:259:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:We then test the predictions of the model on short-run hotel outcomes. We do this by
5:154:11414:18:17:72:540:241:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:estimating regressions of hotel performance on Airbnb supply using two types of instruments
5:155:11505:17:18:72:540:224:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:as well as controls for aggregate demand shocks. We find that the negative e↵ect of Airbnb
5:156:11595:18:18:72:540:206:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:on hotel revenues is larger in cities with constrained hotel capacity, and that compared to
5:157:11686:18:18:72:540:188:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:other cities, hotels here experience a bigger reduction in prices than occupancy rates. The
5:158:11777:18:18:72:540:170:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:heterogeneity in estimates is due to di↵erences in both the size of Airbnb and the e↵ects of
5:159:11869:18:18:72:314:152:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Airbnb across markets conditional on that size.
5:160:11916:18:18:89:545:134:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:In Section4,wedescribeourestimationstrategyforrecoveringtheprimitivesofour
5:161:11990:18:18:72:539:116:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:model.  We proceed in three steps.  First, we estimate a random coe-cient multinomial
5:162:12075:18:18:72:539:98:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:logit demand model (Berry et al.(1995)). We augment our estimation with survey data
5:163:12158:18:0:72:540:80:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:regarding the preferred second choices of Airbnb travelers, which helps us identify substitu-
6:164:12252:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:tion between Airbnb and hotel options. Second, we estimate hotels’ cost functions assuming
6:165:12342:18:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Cournot competition between hotels of the same scale. In order to take into account the
6:166:12429:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:fact that prices steeply increase when occupancy approaches 100%, we followRyan(2012)
6:167:12514:18:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:and rationalize these price changes with marginal costs that start increasing when hotels
6:168:12603:18:18:72:540:636:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:are close to their capacity constraint. Third, we estimate the cost distribution of peer hosts
6:169:12697:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:assuming that they are price takers. Together, these estimates allow us to measure consumer
6:170:12788:18:18:72:540:600:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:and peer producer surplus, as well as to quantify how surplus would change in the absence
6:171:12877:18:18:72:147:582:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:of peer supply.
6:172:12892:18:18:89:540:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Section5presents our results for the top 10 US cities. We find that consumers’ utility for
6:173:12982:18:18:72:540:546:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Airbnb is lower than for hotels, but that preferences for Airbnb increase between 2013 and
6:174:13072:18:18:72:540:528:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:2014. By the end of the sample period, the mean utility from top quality Airbnb listings is
6:175:13163:18:18:72:540:510:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:close to the mean utility of economy and midscale hotels. We find that peer hosts have higher
6:176:13256:18:18:72:540:492:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:marginal costs than hotels on average, and that consistent with our model, the distribution
6:177:13347:18:17:72:309:474:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:of peer costs makes peer supply highly elastic.
6:178:13394:17:18:89:539:457:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:In the absence of Airbnb, total welfare would be lower, travelers and peer producers
6:179:13478:18:18:72:540:439:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:would be worse o↵, while hotels would benefit from less competition. In the top 10 US cities,
6:180:13571:18:18:72:540:421:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:total welfare would decrease by$137 million and consumer surplus would decrease by$276
6:181:13657:18:18:72:270:403:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:million if Airbnb did not exist in 2014.
6:182:13697:18:18:89:540:385:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:This corresponds to a consumer surplus of$41 per night for every Airbnb booking. The
6:183:13781:18:18:72:540:367:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:reduction in consumer surplus if Airbnb did not exist occurs because fewer travelers would
6:184:13871:18:18:72:540:349:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:book rooms, and travelers who end up booking hotel rooms would pay higher prices. As
6:185:13955:18:18:72:540:331:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:it turns out, because of the elastic peer supply, actual Airbnb bookings and thus surplus
6:186:14044:18:18:72:540:313:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:gains disproportionately occur in cities (New York) and times (New Year’s Eve) when hotel
6:187:14133:18:18:72:540:295:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:capacity constraints bind. This implies that in the absence of peer supply, travelers could
6:188:14224:18:18:72:540:277:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:not easily find a substitute hotel room because hotels would be fully booked. Indeed, we
6:189:14312:18:18:72:540:259:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:find that around half of Airbnb bookings would not have been hotel stays had Airbnb not
6:190:14399:18:17:72:111:241:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:existed.
6:191:14407:17:18:89:539:224:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:The concentration of Airbnb bookings in cities and periods of peak demand suggests that
6:192:14494:18:18:72:540:206:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:in the absence of Airbnb, hotels would be limited in their ability to increase the number of
6:193:14586:18:18:72:540:188:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:booked rooms – they were already operating at or close to full capacity – but instead would
6:194:14677:18:18:72:540:170:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:be able to increase prices. Revenues for hotels would increase by 1.54% if Airbnb did not
6:195:14766:18:18:72:540:152:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:exist, and profits would likely increase by a larger percent. In fact, our estimates suggest
6:196:14858:18:18:72:540:134:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:that the variable profits of hotels could increase by up to 3.69% across the 10 cities in our
6:197:14951:18:18:72:110:116:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:sample.
6:198:14958:18:18:89:539:98:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:We contribute to the growing empirical literature on online peer-to-peer platforms. A
6:199:15043:18:0:72:540:80:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:limited number of papers have looked at the e↵ect of online platforms on incumbents, in

7:203:15373:18:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:addition, we highlight important dimensions of heterogeneity of the e↵ects of Airbnb across
7:204:15464:18:18:72:540:636:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:cities and over time. A complementary paper to ours isCohen et al.(2016), which uses
7:205:15548:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:discontinuities in Uber’s surge pricing policy to estimate the consumer surplus from ride
7:206:15637:18:18:72:540:600:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:sharing. Both of our papers find that successful peer-to-peer platforms generate substantial
7:207:15729:18:18:72:542:582:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:consumer surplus. However, whileCohen et al.(2016)assumethatincumbentsdonotchange
7:208:15810:18:18:72:540:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:their behavior, we incorporate capacity constraints and allow for hotel prices to adjust in
7:209:15901:18:18:72:540:546:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:the absence of Airbnb. This is important for our setting because even travelers who book
7:210:15989:18:18:72:540:528:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:hotel rooms benefit from Airbnb through lower prices. Similarly to us,Lam and Liu(2017)

7:219:16720:18:18:72:540:367:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:on peer-to-peer platforms. We find that host supply is highly elastic on the margin. This is
7:220:16812:18:18:72:540:349:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:consistent with analysis of suppliers on Taskrabbit (Cullen and Farronato(2017)) and Uber

7:226:17342:18:17:72:540:241:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:growth heterogeneity across cities, we contribute to the predominantly theoretical literature
7:227:17435:17:18:72:467:224:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:on technology adoption and di↵usion (e.g.Bass(1969)andGriliches(1957)).
7:228:17506:18:18:89:540:206:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:The paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we present the data and document

7:230:17683:18:18:72:540:170:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:framework of competition between dedicated and flexible sellers (Section2.1). In Section3
7:231:17772:18:18:72:540:152:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:we test the predictions of our model on the long- and short-run elasticities of flexible supply,
7:232:17868:18:18:72:540:134:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:and on the competitive e↵ects of Airbnb on hotels. Section4presents our empirical strategy

8:236:18135:30:18:72:540:678:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Airbnb describes itself as a trusted community marketplace for people to list, discover,
8:237:18223:18:18:72:540:660:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:and book unique accommodations around the world — online or from a mobile phone.
8:238:18303:18:18:72:540:642:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:The marketplace was founded in 2008 and has at least doubled in total transaction volume
8:239:18391:18:18:72:540:624:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:during every subsequent year in our sample. Airbnb has created a market for a previously
8:240:18479:18:18:72:540:606:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:rare transaction: the short-term rental of an apartment or room to strangers. In the past,
8:241:18569:18:18:72:540:588:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:these transactions were not commonly handled by single individuals because there were large
8:242:18660:18:18:72:540:570:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:costs to finding a match, securely exchanging money, and ensuring safety. While Airbnb is
8:243:18749:18:18:72:539:552:143:g_d0_f3:64:g_d0_f7:not the only company serving this market, it is the dominant platform in most US cities.2
8:244:18838:18:18:72:540:534:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Therefore, we use Airbnb data to study the drivers and the e↵ects of facilitating peer entry
8:245:18930:18:17:72:229:516:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:in the accommodation market.
8:246:18958:17:18:89:539:499:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Airbnb room supply has grown quickly in the aggregate, but the growth has been highly
8:247:19043:18:18:72:540:481:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:heterogeneous across geographies. Figure1plots the size of Airbnb measured as the daily
8:248:19130:18:18:72:539:463:143:g_d0_f3:64:g_d0_f7:share of available Airbnb listings out of all rooms available for short-term accommodation.3
8:249:19222:18:18:72:540:445:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Even among the top 10 cities in terms of listings, there are high growth markets like San
8:250:19311:18:18:72:540:427:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Francisco and New York, as well as slow growth markets like Chicago and DC. This increase
8:251:19400:18:18:72:540:409:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:in available rooms is specific to the peer-to-peer sector and does not represent a broader
8:252:19490:18:18:72:420:391:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:growth of the supply of short-term accommodation (see FigureA1).
8:253:19554:18:18:89:539:373:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Within a city over time, there is also heterogeneity in the size of Airbnb relative to the
8:254:19644:18:18:72:540:355:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:size of the hotel sector. The fluctuations are especially prominent in New York in Figure
8:255:19733:18:18:72:539:337:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:1, which experiences large spikes in available rooms during New Year’s Eve, and in Austin
8:256:19822:18:18:72:540:319:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:during the South by Southwest festival. The figure suggests that market conditions during
8:257:19911:18:18:72:540:301:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:these spikes are especially suited to peer-to-peer transactions.  These facts motivate our
8:258:20001:18:18:72:540:283:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:theoretical model, in which we distinguish between dedicated sellers (hotels) and flexible
8:259:20091:18:39:72:171:265:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:sellers (peer hosts).
8:260:20112:39:25:72:272:226:206:g_d0_f2:206:g_d0_f2:2.1  Theoretical Framework
8:261:20138:25:18:72:540:201:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:In this section, we introduce a theoretical model for understanding market structure with
8:262:20227:18:18:72:540:183:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:dedicated supply (hotels) and flexible supply (peer hosts) in the accommodation industry.
8:263:20316:18:18:72:543:165:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:We will test the predictions of this model in Section3,andstructurallyestimatetheshort-run
8:264:20406:18:15:85:539:147:49:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f9:2The most prominent competitor is Homeaway/VRBO, a subsidiary of Expedia. Its business has his-
8:265:20501:15:12:72:540:132:99:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f9:torically been concentrated in rentals of entire homes in vacation destinations, such as beach and skiing
8:266:20606:12:9:72:104:120:99:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f9:resorts.
8:267:20614:9:15:85:539:111:49:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f9:3The total number of available rooms is the sum of available hotel rooms and listings available on Airbnb.
8:268:20720:15:12:72:540:96:99:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f9:The same heterogeneity is apparent if we adjust for capacity, or if we divide the number of Airbnb listings
8:269:20827:12:0:72:306:84:99:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f9:by the number of total housing units within an MSA.
9:270:20879:0:18:72:195:708:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:component in Section4.
9:271:20901:18:18:89:539:690:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:In our model, hosting services can be provided by dedicated and flexible sellers, who
9:272:20986:18:18:72:539:672:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:o↵er di↵erentiated products. The model has a short and long-run component. The short-
9:273:21071:18:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:run equilibrium consists of daily prices and rooms sold of each accommodation type as a
9:274:21158:18:18:72:540:636:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:function of the overall demand level and the respective capacities of dedicated and flexible
9:275:21250:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:suppliers. We assume hotels are competing against a fringe of flexible sellers. The long-
9:276:21339:18:18:72:540:600:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:run component determines the entry condition of flexible sellers as a function of fixed hotel
9:277:21432:18:18:72:315:582:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:capacity and the distribution of demand states.
9:278:21479:18:18:89:538:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:We start with the short-run equilibrium representing daily market outcomes. We simplify
9:279:21566:18:18:72:539:546:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:the exposition by assuming that there is one single hotel and one undi↵erentiated type
9:280:21652:18:18:72:539:528:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:of Airbnb listings.  In the empirical counterpart of this model in Section4we relax this
9:281:21740:18:18:72:539:510:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:assumption. LetKhdenote the mass of existing dedicated capacity (number of hotel rooms),

10:307:23376:0:18:72:108:708:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:supply.
10:308:23383:18:18:89:540:690:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:The short-run model already o↵ers some comparative statics predictions, listed below
10:309:23467:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:and proven in AppendixA. Under standard conditions, hotel profits per available room,
10:310:23552:18:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:as well as both prices and occupancy rates, are lower ifKais higher. The separate e↵ect

10:312:23728:18:18:72:539:618:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:binding, but the opposite is true for the e↵ect on occupancy. Intuitively, this occurs because
10:313:23822:18:18:72:539:600:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:the increase in flexible capacity a↵ects hotels through a reduction in their residual demand
10:314:23914:18:18:72:539:582:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:(Figure2), and when hotels are capacity constrained, their supply curve is vertical (Figure
10:315:24005:18:18:72:540:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:2b). A marginal downward shift in residual demand will have no e↵ect on quantity and a
10:316:24091:18:18:72:329:546:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:large e↵ect on price if supply is perfectly inelastic.
10:317:24145:18:18:89:539:528:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:In the long-run, entry of flexible suppliers is endogenous. We assume thatKhwas opti-

10:320:24411:18:17:72:540:474:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:more costly, optimal dedicated capacity is lower and expected profits per unit of capacity
10:321:24501:17:18:72:127:457:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:are higher.
10:322:24512:18:18:89:539:439:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A peer-to-peer platform enables the entry of flexible sellers.  Flexible sellers decide

10:349:25993:18:18:72:540:134:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:flexible suppliers. To explain why, we can think of a simple mean-preserving spread of two
10:350:26083:18:18:72:540:116:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:demand states. In the low demand state, flexible suppliers host very few travelers in either
10:351:26175:18:18:72:540:98:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:case because hotels are not capacity constrained, leading to low equilibrium prices.  The
10:352:26264:18:0:72:539:80:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:di↵erence occurs in high demand states. If the high demand state doubles, prices increase
11:353:26354:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:steeply, especially if hotel capacity constraints are hit, making it very attractive for flexible
11:354:26451:18:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:suppliers to host in periods of high demand. AppendixAformally states the assumptions
11:355:26536:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:and proofs for these results. Section3.2confirms that these comparative statics predictions
11:356:26627:18:18:72:158:654:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:hold in the data.
11:357:26644:18:18:89:540:636:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Before presenting our data, we should note that our model does not allow hotels to adjust

11:359:26823:18:18:72:540:600:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:crowd out dedicated sellers. Since our data only spans the first few years of Airbnb di↵usion
11:360:26916:18:18:72:540:582:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:and hotel construction projects take between 3 and 5 years to complete, we are unable to
11:361:27004:18:18:72:540:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:empirically capture hotels’ capacity adjustments. Exploring the entry and exit decisions of
11:362:27095:18:45:72:398:546:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:dedicated producers would be a valuable extension of our work.
11:363:27157:45:30:72:345:501:296:g_d0_f2:296:g_d0_f2:3  Data and Tests of the Model
11:364:27187:30:18:72:540:471:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:In this section, we describe our data on Airbnb and hotels and document how it confirms the
11:365:27278:18:18:72:540:453:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:predictions of the theoretical framework. Our proprietary Airbnb data consists of information
11:366:27371:18:18:72:540:435:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:aggregated at the level of listing types.  The variables we observe include the number of
11:367:27460:18:17:72:540:417:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:bookings, active and available listings, as well as average listed and transacted prices. An
11:368:27552:17:18:72:540:400:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:available listing is defined as one that is either booked through Airbnb or is open to being
11:369:27644:18:18:72:540:382:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:booked on the date of stay according to a host’s calendar. An active room is defined as a
11:370:27733:18:18:72:540:364:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:listing that is available to be booked or is already booked for at least one date in the future.
11:371:27829:18:18:72:540:346:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Average transacted prices are calculated among all booked rooms on a given date, regardless
11:372:27920:18:18:72:540:328:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:of the time of booking. Analogously, average listed prices are calculated among all available
11:373:28013:18:18:72:373:310:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:rooms on the day of stay, regardless of prior price changes.
11:374:28073:18:18:89:539:292:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:We categorize Airbnb listings into four types: ‘Airbnb Luxury’, ‘Airbnb Upscale’, ‘Airbnb
11:375:28162:18:18:72:539:274:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Midscale’, and ‘Airbnb Economy’.4Listing types are defined using the following algorithm.
11:376:28251:18:18:72:539:256:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:We first run a city level hedonic regression of nightly price on listing fixed e↵ects, date
11:377:28342:18:18:72:540:238:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:fixed e↵ects, and bins for the number of five-star reviews.5Second, we extract the listing
11:378:28432:18:18:72:539:220:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:fixed e↵ects and use Bayesian shrinkage to shrink fixed e↵ects towards the mean. Third, we
11:379:28522:18:18:72:540:202:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:compute quartiles of listing quality and categorize a listing in a given quartile if its fixed e↵ect
11:380:28622:18:18:72:539:184:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:plus review coe-cient falls into the appropriate range. This procedure allows us to account
11:381:28713:18:17:72:540:166:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:for heterogeneity in Airbnb listing types without specifically modeling detailed geographic
11:382:28804:17:18:72:301:149:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:and room type characteristics at a city level.
11:383:28850:18:18:89:539:131:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:The hotel data come from STR, an accommodation industry data provider that tracks

12:389:29326:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:mation by running a periodic survey of hotels, to which they ask daily revenue attributable
12:390:29417:18:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:to the sale of hotel rooms, total rooms sold, and total rooms available. For the 50 largest
12:391:29508:18:18:72:540:636:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:markets, 68% of properties are surveyed, covering 81% of available rooms. STR uses sup-
12:392:29595:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:plementary data on similar hotels to impute outcomes for the remaining hotels which are
12:393:29682:18:18:72:540:600:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:in their census but do not participate in the survey. The data is then aggregated to six
12:394:29770:18:18:72:540:582:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:hotel scales, from luxury to economy, which indicate the quality and amenities of the hotels.
12:395:29863:18:18:72:540:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:So the data tell us, for example, the average price and the total number of rooms sold on

12:398:30090:18:18:72:540:510:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:city, hotels charge$108 per room and their occupancy rate is 66%. Perhaps surprisingly,
12:399:30177:18:18:72:540:492:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Airbnb has very similar transacted prices ($109) and much lower occupancy rates (15%). The
12:400:30267:18:17:72:540:474:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:within-city standard deviation of these outcomes varies greatly across cities. For example,
12:401:30358:17:18:72:539:457:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:the city at the 25th percentile has a standard deviation of hotel prices of$10 ($22 for Airbnb
12:402:30452:18:18:72:539:439:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:prices), while the city at the 75th percentile has a standard deviation of$21 ($34 for Airbnb
12:403:30545:18:18:72:539:421:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:prices).  This indicates that markets di↵er not only in levels but in the extent to which
12:404:30634:18:18:72:322:403:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:conditions fluctuate within a year and over time.
12:405:30683:18:18:89:539:385:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:During our sample period, Airbnb comprises a small share of the overall market as a
12:406:30766:18:18:72:540:367:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:percentage of total rooms available for short-term accommodation.  The average Airbnb
12:407:30851:18:18:72:540:349:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:share of available rooms in the last quarter of 2014 is 2%, and in most cities it is between
12:408:30943:18:18:72:540:331:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:1% and 3% (25th and 75th percentiles).  Two other normalizations confirm that Airbnb
12:409:31027:18:18:72:540:313:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:was still small in most US cities by the end of our sample period. Across all cities, Airbnb
12:410:31119:18:18:72:540:295:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:rooms represent 4% of all guests and represent less than 1% of total housing units for all

12:413:31306:25:18:72:540:213:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:In this section, we verify the theoretical predictions regarding the long-run growth of peer
12:414:31398:18:18:72:539:195:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:supply from Section2.1. Although the theoretical model assumes that entry decisions are
12:415:31485:18:18:72:540:177:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:made instantaneously and jointly for all flexible sellers, in practice awareness about the
12:416:31575:18:18:72:540:159:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Airbnb platform has grown between 2011 and 2014. We assume that the last quarter in
12:417:31658:18:18:72:540:141:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:2014, the end of our sample, provides a valid proxy for the long-run share of peer supply
12:418:31747:18:15:72:182:123:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:derived in our model.
12:419:31768:15:16:85:539:108:49:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f16:6The cities are ranked based on the absolute number of hotel rooms in 2014. See Census Database:http:

13:423:32055:18:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:revenues per available room. Not surprisingly, the size of Airbnb is positively correlated with
13:424:32150:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:the average revenue per available room in a city, with New York being both the city with
13:425:32238:18:18:72:492:654:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:the highest hotel revenues and the one with the highest penetration of peer hosts.
13:426:32320:18:18:89:539:636:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Our theory predicts that if hotels have high investment costs or peer hosts have low
13:427:32404:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:marginal costs, profitability for peer hosts will be high.  So we should expect more peer
13:428:32493:18:18:72:540:600:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:entry in cities with high hotels’ fixed costs and low peers’ marginal costs.  We use two
13:429:32581:18:18:72:540:582:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:proxies for hotel fixed costs. The first is the share of undevelopable area constructed bySaiz
13:430:32675:18:18:72:539:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:(2010). The index measures the share of a metropolitan area that is undevelopable due to
13:431:32763:18:18:72:540:546:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:geographic constraints, e.g. bodies of water or steep mountains. The second index is the
13:432:32851:18:18:72:540:528:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Wharton Residential Land Use Regulatory Index (WRLURI), which measures regulation
13:433:32932:18:18:72:540:510:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:related to land use in each metropolitan area and is based on a nationwide survey described
13:434:33023:18:18:72:540:492:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:inGyourko et al.(2008).7Figures4aandA2confirm that constraints to hotel capacity are
13:435:33107:18:17:72:282:474:143:g_d0_f3:64:g_d0_f7:correlated with the share of peer supply.8
13:436:33149:17:18:89:539:457:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:The second cost factor influencing the viability of peer production is the marginal cost
13:437:33237:18:18:72:540:439:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:of peers. Although many factors a↵ect the costs of hosting, we focus on those related to
13:438:33325:18:18:72:540:421:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:demographics.9Households vary in their propensities to host strangers in their homes. For
13:439:33414:18:18:72:540:403:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:example, an unmarried 30-year-old professional will likely be more open to hosting strangers
13:440:33506:18:18:72:540:385:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:than a family with children. This occurs for at least two reasons. First, children increase
13:441:33597:18:18:72:540:367:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:a host’s perceived risk of the transaction. Second, unmarried professionals are more likely
13:442:33688:18:18:72:540:349:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:to travel, creating vacant space to be rented on Airbnb. Figure4bplots the share of peer
13:443:33776:18:18:72:540:331:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:supply at the end of 2014 against the percentage of unmarried adults, while FigureA2uses
13:444:33864:18:18:72:540:313:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:the percentage of children. The figures confirm that cities with more unmarried adults and
13:445:33954:18:18:72:534:295:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:fewer children are those where Airbnb represents a higher share of accommodation rooms.
13:446:34041:18:18:89:540:277:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:In addition to cost factors, our model predicts that travelers’ demand a↵ects peer entry.
13:447:34130:18:18:72:540:259:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:This is due to two related reasons.  First, hotels typically do not have enough dedicated
13:448:34219:18:17:72:540:241:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:capacity to absorb all potential travelers in times of peak demand. In contrast, flexible sellers
13:449:34316:17:18:72:540:224:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:are able to provide additional supply during peak times, when their rooms are especially
13:450:34404:18:18:72:540:206:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:valuable to travelers. Second, since hotels must pre-commit to capacity and any adjustment
13:451:34494:18:18:72:540:188:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:in the form of new hotel buildings takes 3 to 5 years, unforeseen growth in demand will
13:452:34581:18:16:85:540:170:49:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f9:7Saiz(2010) uses these two measures to calculate the housing supply elasticity at the level of a metropoli-
13:453:34688:16:8:72:111:154:99:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f9:tan area.

13:456:34907:12:12:72:539:118:99:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f9:for liquidity constrained households. FigureA2in the Appendix confirms a positive relationship between

14:463:35572:18:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:year in our sample, in order to reduce the risk that peer entry influences demand rather
14:464:35660:18:18:72:540:636:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:than vice versa. Our data come from Sabre Travel Solutions, the largest Global Distribution
14:465:35751:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Systems provider for air bookings in the US. We isolate trips entering a city as part of a

14:470:36194:18:18:72:540:528:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:2011 and confirms that by the end of 2014 Airbnb is bigger in cities where the fluctuations

14:472:36332:18:18:89:539:492:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:To conclude this section, we combine all the descriptive results into a regression. Table
14:473:36421:18:17:72:540:474:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:2displays the summary statistics for the cost and demand factors described above. Table3
14:474:36509:17:18:72:540:457:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:displays results from a regression where the dependent variable is the size of Airbnb in the last
14:475:36606:18:18:72:540:439:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:quarter of 2014 and the explanatory variables are combinations of the measures of relative
14:476:36696:18:18:72:540:421:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:costs, demand growth, and demand variability described above. We also control for market
14:477:36784:18:18:72:540:403:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:size in order to isolate the component of the standard deviation of demand which is due to
14:478:36874:18:18:72:540:385:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:demand variability. Despite the small sample size, column (1) shows that all factors a↵ect
14:479:36964:18:18:72:539:367:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:the size of Airbnb in the expected direction, and two coe-cients are statistically significant
14:480:37058:18:18:72:540:349:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:- peers’ marginal costs, and demand volatility. Column (2) adds additional and potentially
14:481:37148:18:18:72:539:331:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:redundant proxies for costs and demand. The coe-cients are in the expected direction for
14:482:37236:18:18:72:127:313:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:all proxies.
14:483:37248:18:18:89:539:295:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:In the last column of Table3we add the 2011 average revenue per hotel room as an
14:484:37328:18:18:72:539:277:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:additional control. The coe-cient on revenue per available room is positive and statistically
14:485:37421:18:18:72:540:259:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:significant, while the coe-cients on the demand and hotel investment cost proxies decrease
14:486:37511:18:17:72:540:241:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:in magnitude and become insignificant. This result suggests that demand proxies and hotel
14:487:37600:17:18:72:540:224:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:investment costs a↵ect peer entry mostly through price and occupancy as expected. Taken
14:488:37687:18:18:72:540:206:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:altogether, our proxies for the determinants of long-run peer supply explain between 60%
14:489:37775:18:39:72:388:188:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:and 75% of the variation across our cross-section of US cities.

14:491:37888:26:18:72:540:123:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:In the previous section we have tested the long-run predictions of our theoretical model,
14:492:37977:18:18:72:540:105:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:those related to the entry of peer producers. Here, we take entry as given, and focus on the
14:493:38069:18:15:81:539:87:49:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f9:10Data from Sabre include monthly number of passengers by origin and destination airport. We aggregate
14:494:38171:15:0:72:342:72:99:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f9:these observations to an MSA-month measure of air travelers.
15:495:38233:0:18:72:539:708:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:short-run drivers of peer supply to test our model hypotheses on the e↵ects of peer supply
15:496:38323:18:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:on hotels. The awareness and di↵usion process of Airbnb and its variation across cities help
15:497:38415:18:18:72:199:672:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:us test these hypotheses.
15:498:38440:18:18:89:539:654:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:First, we show how to properly measure the size of Airbnb, and how the short-run
15:499:38520:18:18:72:540:636:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:elasticity of Airbnb supply is twice as large as that of hotels. Then, we use an instrumental
15:500:38613:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:variable approach to study the reduction in hotel revenues after the entry of Airbnb, and its
15:501:38706:18:35:72:293:600:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:heterogeneity across cities and hotel scales.
15:502:38751:35:25:72:225:565:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Measuring Airbnb Supply
15:503:38774:25:18:72:540:540:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:We start by demonstrating how to properly measure Airbnb supply and studying how hosts
15:504:38860:18:18:72:540:522:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:flexibly respond to fluctuations in market-level demand over time. Figure6displays four
15:505:38947:18:18:72:540:504:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:measures of the size of Airbnb plotted over time: active listings, two measures of available
15:506:39039:18:18:72:540:486:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:listings, and booked listings. This figure displays three important facts. First, the share
15:507:39130:18:18:72:540:468:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:of active or available listings that are booked varies greatly over time. The booking rate is
15:508:39223:18:18:72:540:450:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:especially high during periods of high demand such as New Year’s Eve and the summer. What
15:509:39312:18:18:72:540:432:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:we will show just below is that this is the result of a highly elastic peer supply. Second, the
15:510:39407:18:18:72:540:414:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:gap between active listings and available listings is increasing over time, suggesting attrition
15:511:39503:18:18:72:540:396:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:in active listings. Therefore, the meaning of an active listing does not stay constant over the
15:512:39598:18:18:72:185:378:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:entire period of study.
15:513:39621:18:18:89:539:360:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:The third and most relevant fact from Figure6is that the number of unadjusted available
15:514:39708:18:17:72:540:342:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:listings (blue line) actually decreases during periods of high demand, most notably on New
15:515:39798:17:18:72:540:325:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Year’s Eve. The main reason for this is that calendar updating behavior responds to room
15:516:39886:18:18:72:539:307:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:demand. Many hosts do not pro-actively take the e↵ort to block a date on their calendar
15:517:39973:18:18:72:539:289:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:when they are unavailable (seeFradkin(2017) for evidence). However, when they receive a
15:518:40060:18:18:72:540:271:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:request to book a room, they often reject the guest and update their calendar accordingly.
15:519:40150:18:18:72:540:253:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Since a larger share of listings receives inquiries during high demand periods, the calendar is
15:520:40245:18:18:72:540:235:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:also more accurate during those times. Therefore, the naively calculated availability measure
15:521:40338:18:18:72:539:217:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:su↵ers from endogeneity and is even counter-cyclical – high when demand is low, and low
15:522:40425:18:18:72:123:199:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:otherwise.
15:523:40435:18:18:89:539:181:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Since we need a measure of the size of Airbnb that stays stable over time, we create an
15:524:40522:18:18:72:540:163:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:adjusted measure of available listings. This measure includes any rooms which were listed
15:525:40611:18:18:72:540:145:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:as available for a given date or were sent an inquiry for a given date and later became
15:526:40698:18:18:72:539:127:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:unavailable.  Therefore, it does not su↵er from the problem of demand-induced calendar
15:527:40784:18:18:72:540:109:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:updating.  It does overstate the “true” number of available rooms in the market, but as
15:528:40871:18:17:72:540:91:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:long as it overestimates true availability consistently over time we consider it to be the
15:529:40961:17:0:72:540:74:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:best measure of Airbnb size. Figure6displays our proposed measure (red line) against the
16:530:41051:0:18:72:539:708:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:naive measure of available listings (blue line). The new measure does not su↵er from drops
16:531:41141:18:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:in availability during high demand periods. Throughout the rest of the paper we use the
16:532:41228:18:35:72:529:672:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:adjusted number of available listings as the size of Airbnb supply unless otherwise noted.
16:533:41318:35:26:72:320:637:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Peers’ Responses to Demand Fluctuations
16:534:41357:26:18:72:540:611:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:From Figure6it is clear that Airbnb bookings fluctuate over time: more rooms are booked
16:535:41444:18:17:72:540:593:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:during the peak season than in other periods. In this section, we use 2SLS to document that
16:536:41535:17:18:72:414:576:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:flexible suppliers are almost twice as elastic as dedicated suppliers.
16:537:41605:18:18:89:539:558:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:We estimate the average supply elasticity of hotel and Airbnb rooms with respect to their
16:538:41694:18:33:72:253:540:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:prices using the following equation:

16:546:42301:18:18:72:265:367:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:less likely to occupy their residences).

16:548:42424:18:18:72:540:331:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:is correlated with demand, and with unobserved fluctuations in marginal costs. Furthermore,
16:549:42515:18:18:72:539:313:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:in the case of Airbnb, the number of available roomsKmtis itself endogenous because hosts
16:550:42604:18:18:72:441:295:143:g_d0_f3:64:g_d0_f7:may list their room as available precisely during high demand periods.11
16:551:42676:18:18:89:538:277:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:We discuss each concern in order.  We instrument for price with plausibly exogenous
16:552:42759:18:18:72:540:259:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:demand fluctuations which are typically caused by holidays or special events in a city. We
16:553:42849:18:18:72:540:241:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:use two instruments.  The first is the number of arriving (not returning) flight travelers
16:554:42939:18:18:72:549:223:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:in a city-month, which we used in Section3.1.ThesecondcomesfromGoogleTrends,

16:556:43103:18:18:72:540:187:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Our query of interest is “hotel(s)c”, wherecis the name of a US city in our sample. We
16:557:43189:18:18:72:540:169:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:de-trend each city’s Google Trends series using a common linear trend to remove long-run
16:558:43277:18:17:72:540:151:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:changes in overall search behavior on Google. We use the one-week lagged search volume
16:559:43363:17:18:72:540:134:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:as an instrument. Using other lags or the contemporaneous search volume yields similar
16:560:43449:18:16:72:123:116:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:estimates.
16:561:43459:16:15:81:539:100:49:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f9:11The same endogeneity issue is not important for hotels because hotel capacity is typically fixed in a
16:562:43562:15:12:72:540:85:99:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f9:4-year interval, our sample period. However, instrumenting for hotel capacity with a quadratic time trend,
16:563:43668:12:0:72:287:73:99:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f9:as we do for Airbnb, does not change our results.

17:565:43803:18:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:instrument for the number of available listings with a city-specific quadratic time trend. It is
17:566:43899:18:18:72:539:672:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:reasonable to believe that this instrument captures the long-run di↵usion process of Airbnb
17:567:43990:18:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:while being uncorrelated with contemporaneous idiosyncratic shocks to supply. We use this
17:568:44079:18:18:72:540:636:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:same instrumentation strategy below to test for the e↵ect of Airbnb supply on hotel revenues
17:569:44171:18:18:72:195:618:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:predicted by our model.
17:570:44194:18:18:89:539:600:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Table4contains our estimates of Equation3for Airbnb and hotels separately. Turning
17:571:44276:18:18:72:540:582:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:first to column 1, a 1% increase in the average hotel daily rate increases hotel bookings by
17:572:44368:18:18:72:540:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:1.1%. This elasticity is half as large as that of Airbnb (column 2), whose estimated elasticity
17:573:44463:18:18:72:540:546:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:is 2.2. An important implication of this result is that smaller fluctuations in prices are needed
17:574:44560:18:18:72:328:528:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:for Airbnb supply to adjust upward or downward.
17:575:44607:18:18:89:539:510:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:We have shown that the Airbnb supply is highly responsive to price, more so than hotels:
17:576:44695:18:18:72:544:492:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:asmallpriceincreaseduetohighdemandgreatlyincreasesthenumberofbookedroomson
17:577:44769:18:17:72:540:474:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Airbnb, and this increase is twice as large as for hotels. The lower elasticity of hotel supply
17:578:44864:17:18:72:540:457:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:has a simple explanation. To the extent that hotels have a constant marginal cost and a fixed
17:579:44957:18:18:72:540:439:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:supply, hotel bookings cannot increase in response to increases in demand when demand is
17:580:45045:18:18:72:539:421:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:su-ciently high. The higher elasticity of flexible supply implies that there are many hosts
17:581:45136:18:18:72:540:403:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:willing to rent their rooms when prices are high, but prefer not to host when prices are just
17:582:45229:18:18:72:539:385:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:alittlelower. OurstructuralmodelinSection4rationalizes this result by estimating that
17:583:45314:18:35:72:458:367:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:there is a large mass of peers with costs close to the market clearing prices.
17:584:45392:35:25:72:305:332:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:E↵ects of Peer Entry on Hotel Revenue
17:585:45429:25:18:72:540:307:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:In this section, we test our model hypotheses on the e↵ects of peer entry on hotels’ revenue,
17:586:45522:18:18:72:540:289:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:occupancy rates, and prices using linear specifications. Before describing our empirical strat-
17:587:45617:18:18:72:539:271:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:egy, we discuss the two most important challenges to identifying the e↵ect of Airbnb. To do
17:588:45708:18:18:72:540:253:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:this, we consider the hypothetical scenario where Airbnb supply grows randomly across cities
17:589:45800:18:18:72:540:235:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:and over time. In this scenario, regressing the outcomes of hotels on the Airbnb supply would
17:590:45893:18:18:72:539:217:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:yield an unbiased estimate of the causal e↵ect of Airbnb supply. However, as highlighted
17:591:45981:18:18:72:540:199:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:above, Airbnb supply does not grow randomly. In fact, Airbnb supply is larger in cities with
17:592:46073:18:18:72:540:181:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:high hotel revenues, and during periods of high demand within each city. Observables like
17:593:46162:18:18:72:540:163:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:the number of arriving flight travelers, city fixed e↵ects, and seasonality fixed e↵ects, help
17:594:46256:18:18:72:214:145:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:us control for this selection.
17:595:46286:18:18:89:539:127:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:We instrument for the currently available Airbnb supply with a city-specific quadratic
17:596:46372:18:18:72:539:109:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:time trend, which isolates the predictable di↵usion of Airbnb over-time from the endogenous
17:597:46463:18:17:72:540:91:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:short-run Airbnb supply responses to demand shocks during peak days such as holidays.
17:598:46548:17:0:72:540:74:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:The key assumption behind this identification strategy is that there are no other city-specific

18:609:47407:18:18:72:540:499:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:incoming air passengers captures monthly fluctuations in demand. The fixed e↵ects capture
18:610:47496:18:18:72:540:481:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:seasonality, di↵erences across the days of the week, and time-invariant city characteristics

18:614:47814:18:18:72:540:409:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:First, there is variation across cities and over time in the number of available listings due
18:615:47907:18:18:72:540:391:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:to increasing awareness of Airbnb. Second, there is variation in the availability of listings
18:616:48000:18:18:72:540:373:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:due to hosts’ daily costs of hosting, which we assume are uncorrelated with residual daily
18:617:48090:18:18:72:296:355:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:demand for accommodation within the city.
18:618:48131:18:18:89:539:337:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Table5displays the results of the baseline specification. The coe-cient on Airbnb size in
18:619:48220:18:18:72:540:319:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:column (1) is statistically significant and the estimated elasticity for hotel revenue is -.033.
18:620:48316:18:18:72:539:301:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:This coe-cient implies that a 10% increase in available listings decreases the revenue per
18:621:48406:18:17:72:539:283:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:hotel room by 0.33%. The coe-cient estimates for our demand proxies, Google trends and
18:622:48492:17:18:72:540:266:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:arriving air travelers, are of the correct sign and statistically significant.  Once we break
18:623:48585:18:18:72:539:248:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:down the e↵ect into a reduction in occupancy rates (column 2) and a reduction in prices
18:624:48672:18:18:72:540:230:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:(column 3), we see that on average Airbnb has a larger e↵ect on prices than on occupancy
18:625:48760:18:18:72:100:212:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:rates.
18:626:48766:18:18:89:539:194:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Recall that our model predicts that, holding fixed Airbnb supply, in days and cities
18:627:48850:18:18:72:540:176:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:when hotels are not capacity-constrained, Airbnb should have a relatively bigger e↵ect on
18:628:48939:18:18:72:540:158:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:occupancy than on price. The opposite is true when hotels are capacity-constrained: on
18:629:49025:18:18:72:540:140:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:those days, Airbnb should have a relatively bigger e↵ect on price than on occupancy. We
18:630:49112:18:18:72:540:122:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:also predicted and confirmed empirically that there will be more Airbnb rooms available in
18:631:49202:18:17:72:540:104:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:cities where hotels are often capacity constrained. Consequently, our theory predicts that
18:632:49292:17:15:81:540:87:49:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f9:12In AppendixBwe conduct robustness checks to demonstrate that these controls and instruments likely
18:633:49392:15:0:72:249:72:99:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f9:capture potential sources of endogeneity.
19:634:49435:0:18:72:539:708:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:we will find larger e↵ects of Airbnb in constrained cities and that the price rather than
19:635:49524:18:18:72:524:690:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:occupancy channel will be more important in these cities than in non-constrained cities.
19:636:49612:18:18:89:539:672:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:To test this prediction, we divide our cities into two groups and explore the heterogeneity
19:637:49703:18:18:72:539:654:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:of the e↵ect of Airbnb across cities.Saiz(2010) uses the WRLURI and the share of unde-
19:638:49789:18:18:72:539:636:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:velopable area described in Section3.1to estimate the housing supply elasticity at the city
19:639:49880:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:level. We take that supply elasticity as a proxy for the elasticity of hotel construction, and
19:640:49974:18:18:72:540:600:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:split our sample of cities at the median level of Saiz’s estimates for the cities in our sample.
19:641:50070:18:18:72:540:582:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Table6displays the estimates of Equation4separately for the two groups of cities. Columns
19:642:50159:18:18:72:540:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:(1) and (4) display the estimates of the e↵ect on revenue per available hotel room. Both
19:643:50247:18:18:72:540:546:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:coe-cients on Airbnb are statistically insignificant. When we break the outcomes into prices
19:644:50339:18:18:72:540:528:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:and occupancy rates, we see that the statistically significant e↵ect of Airbnb is a reduction in
19:645:50435:18:18:72:540:510:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:hotel prices in the cities where hotels are capacity constrained (column 3). This is consistent
19:646:50530:18:18:72:540:492:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:with the fact that binding capacity constraints lead to spikes in hotel prices, which in turn
19:647:50623:18:17:72:540:474:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:attract more competition from Airbnb. When Airbnb enters, hotels are often fully booked,
19:648:50711:17:18:72:539:457:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:so they face more pressure on prices than on occupancy. TableA4separates the e↵ect in
19:649:50796:18:18:72:527:439:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:constrained cities by hotel scale and detects e↵ects on all hotel scales other than Luxury.
19:650:50887:18:18:89:540:421:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Di↵erences in the e↵ect of Airbnb on hotels across constrained and unconstrained cities
19:651:50974:18:18:72:540:403:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:occur for two reasons. First, for the same level of Airbnb and hotel capacity, the e↵ect of
19:652:51065:18:18:72:540:385:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Airbnb is relatively larger on prices if hotel capacity constraints are more often binding (due
19:653:51160:18:18:72:540:367:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:to higher levels of demand). Second, for the same level of demand and hotel capacity, the
19:654:51249:18:18:72:540:349:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:e↵ect on hotel revenues is larger if there are more Airbnb listings. Intuitively, the elasticity of
19:655:51348:18:18:72:540:331:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:hotel revenues with respect to the size of Airbnb should be higher, the higher the Airbnb share
19:656:51443:18:18:72:540:313:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:of supply because a 1 percent increase in Airbnb size is a much bigger share of market supply
19:657:51536:18:18:72:540:295:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:when Airbnb penetration is 3% then when it is 1%. Both conditions are true when we split
19:658:51624:18:18:72:540:277:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:our cities. Indeed, in December 2014 the average Airbnb supply share in hotel-constrained
19:659:51713:18:18:72:540:259:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:cities was 4.3% while it was only in 1.4% in unconstrained cities. At the same time, the
19:660:51801:18:17:72:540:241:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:average hotel occupancy rate was 61% in constrained cities and only 53% in unconstrained
19:661:51889:17:18:72:101:224:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:cities.
19:662:51896:18:18:89:540:206:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Before concluding this section, one caveat is in order. In these specifications we cannot
19:663:51985:18:18:72:540:188:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:take advantage of exogenous changes in price that would allow for a valid causal estimate of
19:664:52077:18:18:72:540:170:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:the e↵ect of Airbnb on hotel performance. For that analysis we refer the reader to Section
19:665:52167:18:18:72:539:152:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:5. However, this exercise helped us confirm that the main predictions of our model from
19:666:52254:18:18:72:539:134:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Section2hold in the data. We documented that the entry of peer hosts is responsive to
19:667:52339:18:18:72:540:116:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:long-run supply and demand characteristics. Peer supply is more likely to enter in cities
19:668:52428:18:18:72:540:98:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:where hotels’ fixed costs are high, where peers marginal costs are low, and where demand
19:669:52516:18:0:72:540:80:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:is increasing and highly variable. We have also shown that flexible supply is highly elastic,
20:670:52611:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:and twice as elastic as dedicated supply. Finally, we have shown that the entry of flexible

20:672:52794:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:higher in cities with binding hotel capacity constraints and has a relatively larger impact on
20:673:52888:18:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:prices in those cities. In the rest of the paper, we structurally estimate our short-run model
20:674:52982:18:45:72:515:636:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:in order to measure the welfare e↵ects of Airbnb on consumers, peer hosts, and hotels.

20:676:53100:30:18:72:540:561:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:In this section, we describe the fully specified short-run model that we estimate. This extends

20:680:53439:18:18:72:540:489:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:hotel scales and Airbnb listing types. On the supply side, we assume that hotels engage in
20:681:53529:18:18:72:540:471:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Cournot competition with di↵erentiated products across scales. Within a scale, each hotel
20:682:53618:18:34:72:516:453:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:is undi↵erentiated. Airbnb hosts are price takers with randomly drawn marginal costs.

20:684:53718:26:18:72:540:393:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Consumers make a discrete choice between hotel scales, Airbnb listing types, and an outside

21:708:54968:18:18:72:540:664:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:supply. We assume that this competition takes the form of a Cournot equilibrium. Hotels

21:711:55216:18:18:72:539:610:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:need to distinguish between scale-level and hotel-level quantities. We letQhndenote the

21:713:55394:18:18:72:544:574:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:so the number of rooms sold by each hotel, denotedqhn,istheratioofaggregatequantity
21:714:55477:18:18:72:544:556:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:divided by the number of hotels. Analogously, scale-level capacity is denotedKhn,while
21:715:55563:18:17:72:205:538:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:hotel-level capacity iskhn.
21:716:55590:17:18:89:539:521:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:We must also match the fact that prices increase sharply as the number of rooms sold
21:717:55674:18:18:72:540:503:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:approaches the number of available rooms. In practice, occupancy rates never reach 100% at
21:718:55764:18:18:72:539:485:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:the scale level, but prices start increasing before then (Figure7). This is because, although
21:719:55857:18:18:72:540:467:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:we model hotels as homogeneous within each scale, some individual hotels may sell out before
21:720:55949:18:18:72:540:449:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:others and this may result in sharply increasing scale-level prices. In addition, if hotels face
21:721:56045:18:18:72:540:431:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:uncertainty about the actual level of demand when setting prices, increases in expected
21:722:56132:18:18:72:540:413:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:demand will increase the probability of hitting capacity constraints, thus increasing prices
21:723:56224:18:18:72:540:395:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:before realized demand reaches 100%. We allow our model to fit this increasing price profile
21:724:56316:18:18:72:540:377:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:by estimating an increasing cost function for hotels that kicks in as soon as hotel occupancy
21:725:56409:18:18:72:540:359:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:is at least 85% within a scale. The estimation of increasing marginal costs as production

21:728:56612:18:18:89:539:305:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:We assume that hotels’ variable costs are made of two parts: a constant marginal costchn,

22:766:58232:18:39:72:413:353:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:surplus, and their optimal choices are consistent with one another.
22:767:58299:39:25:72:251:314:206:g_d0_f2:206:g_d0_f2:4.1  Estimation Strategy
22:768:58323:25:18:72:539:289:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:We estimate the demand, hotel supply, and peer supply separately. For demand, the high-
22:769:58410:18:18:72:499:271:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:level choices are the market size, the moments to match, and the instruments used.
22:770:58492:18:18:89:539:253:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Starting first with demand, we need to make a normalization. Since Airbnb listings are
22:771:58578:18:18:72:540:235:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:on average bigger than hotel rooms and can host more guests, we adjust quantities so that
22:772:58667:18:18:72:540:217:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:room capacity is comparable across Airbnb listings and hotel rooms. To do this, we take
22:773:58754:18:18:72:540:199:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:advantage of the fact that we have information on the average number of guests for Airbnb
22:774:58843:18:18:72:540:181:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:transactions.  In addition, lower quality Airbnb listings are typically private rooms with
22:775:58933:18:18:72:540:163:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:similar capacity as standard hotel rooms. For this reason, we assume that each hotel room
22:776:59022:18:18:72:540:145:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:is occupied by as many people as the average number of occupants of Airbnb listings in the
22:777:59112:18:17:72:540:127:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:midscale quality category in the same city. Given this adjustment, our quantities, prices, and
22:778:59206:17:18:72:538:110:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:estimates should be interpreted as referring to room-nights with standard hotel occupancy.
22:779:59296:18:16:81:539:92:49:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f9:13The objective function is not di↵erentiable atqhn=⌫khn, but otherwise the first order condition holds
22:780:59399:16:0:72:142:76:99:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f9:everywhere else.
23:781:59417:0:18:89:539:708:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:We use data on the 10 largest cities in terms of the share of Airbnb bookings in our
23:782:59501:18:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:sample. Our initial estimation sample includes all days in 2013 and 2014. We restrict the

23:784:59688:18:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:periods market shares of Airbnb are often close to zero, which complicates our estimation.
23:785:59778:18:18:72:540:636:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Second, there will not be much of an e↵ect of Airbnb when market shares are close to 0. For
23:786:59869:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:the same reason, we also drop Airbnb options if their share of available rooms is less than
23:787:59960:18:18:72:223:600:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:0.5% on a given day and city.
23:788:59989:18:18:89:545:582:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:One key choice we must make in the estimation isDn,thetotalnumberofconsumers

23:790:60151:18:18:72:540:546:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:and Airbnb, as well as the share of potential travelers choosing to stay home, to travel to
23:791:60242:18:18:72:539:528:143:g_d0_f3:64:g_d0_f11:other locations, or to stay in alternative accommodations, e.g. friends and family. We setDn
23:792:60334:18:18:72:540:510:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:equal to three times the average number of rooms booked in the corresponding month in each
23:793:60424:18:18:72:540:492:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:city in 2012. This assumption allows the potential number of travelers to vary seasonally
23:794:60513:18:17:72:540:474:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:across cities, and it allows for both substitution from hotels – hotel travelers switching to
23:795:60606:17:18:72:540:457:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Airbnb –, and market expansion – travelers switching from the outside option to Airbnb.
23:796:60693:18:18:72:539:439:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:We rationalize any remaining variation over time in the total number of travelers booking

23:799:60937:18:18:89:539:385:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:The second key choice is the set of moments that we match to the data. We construct

24:819:62093:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:of travelers booking on Airbnb.  Airbnb has conducted surveys of guests in four of the
24:820:62179:18:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:sampled cities during 2013 and 2014.  The surveys asked the question:  “If Airbnb had
24:821:62264:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:not been available, what would you have done?”. Between 58% and 81% of guests across
24:822:62348:18:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:cities said that they would have stayed in a hotel. A simple average across cities yields a
24:823:62439:18:18:72:291:636:143:g_d0_f3:64:g_d0_f7:substitution share of 68% towards hotels.14

24:854:63528:18:18:72:540:357:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:traveling out of a city. We also construct instruments using the total number of available
24:855:63618:18:18:72:540:339:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:rooms. Since for Airbnb room availability responds to demand, the number of available rooms
24:856:63709:18:18:72:540:321:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:is predicted with city-specific quadratic time trends. We interact the predicted number of
24:857:63799:18:17:72:540:303:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:available Airbnb rooms with an indicator variable for hotel options, and we do the same for
24:858:63890:17:18:72:540:286:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:hotel rooms and an indicator variable for Airbnb options. This set of instruments proxy for
24:859:63981:18:18:72:540:268:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:the level of competition within a market. A hotel scale’s own number of available rooms can
24:860:64072:18:18:72:539:250:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:also be used to construct an instrument because it a↵ects whether hotel capacity constraints
24:861:64164:18:18:72:540:232:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:are likely to bind. To use it as an instrument, we interact its inverse, and its inverse squared,
24:862:64261:18:18:72:540:214:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:with the Google search trend, and its square. We use the ratio because capacity constraints
24:863:64352:18:18:72:539:196:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:a↵ect prices more when demand is higher. Since we have a number of instruments that are

24:865:64539:16:11:72:540:162:99:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f9:UK, France, and Germany.  In the survey, they asked respondents about their travel patterns.  12% of
24:866:64639:11:12:72:540:151:99:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f9:respondents had used Airbnb within the past year and when asked which travel alternative Airbnb replaced,
24:867:64744:12:12:72:540:139:99:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f9:42% of respondents answered a hotel. SeeNowak et al.(2015). We think that the major reason for the
24:868:64842:12:12:72:540:127:99:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f9:di↵erences between the Airbnb and Morgan Stanley surveys is that Morgan Stanley sampled guests to
24:869:64939:12:12:72:540:115:99:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f9:all types of destinations including resorts and European cities. There are typically more non-Airbnb and

25:879:65667:18:18:72:540:600:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:in our model include the ordering of scales from luxury to economy, and prices. We construct
25:880:65759:18:18:72:539:582:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:the following instruments: the di↵erence and square of the di↵erence between the predicted
25:881:65849:18:18:72:540:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:price of an option and the predicted price of its closest alternatives – for midscale hotels,
25:882:65942:18:18:72:540:546:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:the closest alternatives are upper midscale and economy –, the total number of alternatives
25:883:66033:18:18:72:540:528:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:whose predicted price is within a standard deviation of an option predicted price, and the

25:885:66212:18:18:72:540:492:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:the predicted prices of all other hotel options. Since these instruments are highly correlated,
25:886:66307:18:17:72:540:474:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:we keep the principal components accounting for 75% of the variation for the estimation.

25:888:66482:18:18:72:539:439:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:we use the moments in equations9and10to estimate the set of demand parameters by

25:890:66592:18:18:89:540:403:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:It is useful to give an intuition for how the variation in the data allows us to estimate
25:891:66681:18:18:72:540:385:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:our demand parameters. Our descriptive statistics show that the prices of hotels and Airbnb
25:892:66772:18:18:72:540:367:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:options, unadjusted for di↵erent number of occupants, are similar. This fact, together with
25:893:66863:18:18:72:540:349:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:the relatively high substitution rate between hotels and Airbnb rooms derived from survey
25:894:66952:18:18:72:540:331:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:responses, suggests that the mean utilities of hotels and Airbnb options should be fairly

25:896:67128:18:18:72:540:295:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:for hotels than for Airbnb options. The market share and substitution moments helps us
25:897:67214:18:18:72:540:277:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:rationalize these two patterns in the data. On one hand, the substitution moment helps
25:898:67300:18:18:72:540:259:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:us identify the random coe-cient on the inside option, which is common across hotels and
25:899:67388:18:17:72:539:241:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Airbnb listings. On the other, di↵erences in market shares rationalize mean utilities that
25:900:67478:17:18:72:540:224:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:will be higher for hotels than for Airbnb options. Finally, di↵erences in market shares when
25:901:67570:18:18:72:540:206:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:the price of competitors change help us identify consumer preference heterogeneity across
25:902:67659:18:18:72:168:188:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:options and prices.

26:918:68430:18:18:89:539:600:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Finally, the supply of Airbnb can be estimated separately using another set of linear IV

26:950:69523:30:18:72:540:237:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:In this section, we discuss the results of our estimation.  We first go over our estimated
26:951:69613:18:18:72:539:219:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:parameters. Then we discuss the e↵ects of Airbnb on consumer surplus. Lastly, we study
26:952:69699:18:18:72:540:201:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:the e↵ects on hotels’ and hosts’ bookings, revenues, and surplus. For each of these outcomes,
26:953:69792:18:39:72:355:183:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:we discuss heterogeneity across cities and time periods.
26:954:69848:39:25:72:257:144:206:g_d0_f2:206:g_d0_f2:5.1  Parameter Estimates
26:955:69872:25:18:72:540:119:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Table7displays the estimates of demand parameters that are common across cities and
26:956:69955:18:18:72:540:101:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:accommodation options. We first discuss the parameters governing the distribution of price
26:957:70045:18:0:72:539:83:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:sensitivity across travelers. The mean price coe-cient is -.033 and the standard deviation is
27:958:70140:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:.006. The standard deviation is imprecisely estimated, but our estimates are consistent with
27:959:70232:18:18:72:539:690:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:existing work on hotel demand (Koulayev(2014)). Google search trends and incoming airline
27:960:70321:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:travelers are estimated to have a positive e↵ect on demand for the range of values observed
27:961:70412:18:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:in the data. We also estimate large and statistically significant heterogeneity in preferences
27:962:70506:18:18:72:540:636:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:for high-end hotel options – luxury and upper upscale – and a more limited but equally
27:963:70592:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:significant level of heterogeneity in preferences between traveling or not. This last estimate
27:964:70686:18:18:72:540:600:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:of the random coe-cient on the inside option is especially important because it governs the
27:965:70777:18:18:72:540:582:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:extent to which Airbnb travelers would substitute towards hotels or the outside option if
27:966:70866:18:18:72:540:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Airbnb were not available.  The model achieves a value for the objective function of 170
27:967:70954:18:18:72:540:546:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:with a relatively parsimonious specification. The total number of observations in the data
27:968:71044:18:18:72:540:528:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:is 65,172 while we estimate 375 linear parameters and 3 non-linear parameters determining
27:969:71133:18:18:72:277:510:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:the variances of the random coe-cients.
27:970:71172:18:18:89:540:492:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Next, we consider the mean utilities across accommodation options. Figure8displays the
27:971:71258:18:17:72:540:474:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:mean willingness to pay per night for each option and city at the end of 2014. The fact that
27:972:71350:17:18:72:540:457:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:some values are negative reflects our choice of a market size that’s three times the average
27:973:71442:18:18:72:540:439:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:number of booked rooms in a city-month. When looking at the mean utilities in relative
27:974:71528:18:18:72:540:421:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:terms, our estimates show that willingness to pay tends to be decreasing between upscale and
27:975:71620:18:18:72:540:403:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:economy hotels and between Airbnb luxury and economy listings. The extremely low mean
27:976:71705:18:18:72:540:385:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:utilities for luxury and upper upscale hotels are rationalized by the fact that preferences for
27:977:71800:18:18:72:406:367:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:these options are highly heterogeneous, as highlighted in Table7.
27:978:71865:18:18:89:539:349:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:The value of the top Airbnb option is lower than the value of the lowest hotel option across
27:979:71957:18:18:72:539:331:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:all cities, with some variation in the relative di↵erences.  We cannot distinguish between
27:980:72047:18:18:72:540:313:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:alternative explanations for this di↵erence, but one likely possibility is that not all travelers
27:981:72144:18:18:72:540:295:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:actually consider Airbnb as a viable option for their travel plans, yet. Another possibility
27:982:72236:18:18:72:540:277:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:is that Airbnb listings are typically located farther away from the city tourist and business
27:983:72329:18:18:72:447:259:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:centers, which might lower travelers’ willingness to pay relative to hotels.
27:984:72405:18:17:89:540:241:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:TableA5shows the city-specific elasticities of demand for di↵erent accommodations with
27:985:72491:17:18:72:540:224:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:respect to their own price and TableA6shows the average cross-price elasticities. We find
27:986:72580:18:18:72:540:206:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:that demand for accommodations is elastic on average.  For example, in New York, the
27:987:72664:18:18:72:540:188:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:demand elasticities range between -8.54 for luxury hotels and -2.93 for the lowest quality
27:988:72754:18:18:72:540:170:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:of Airbnb listings. There is also substantial variation across cities in demand elasticities,
27:989:72847:18:18:72:469:152:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:ranging between -2.65 in Portland and -6.24 in New York for midscale hotels.
27:990:72923:18:18:89:539:134:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Next, we turn to the estimates of hotel cost parameters. Our parameter estimates are
27:991:73007:18:18:72:540:116:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:precise and the estimation procedure explains most of the variation with an R-squared of
27:992:73095:18:18:72:539:98:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:0.83. The interquartile range for the errors is -$9.9 to$12.2.16Figure9plots the marginal
27:993:73184:18:0:72:539:80:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:cost curves for di↵erent hotel scales and di↵erent cities at the end of 2014. We find that
28:994:73276:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:the constant components of hotels’ marginal costs have the expected relationship with hotel
28:995:73367:18:18:72:539:690:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:quality. The marginal cost for luxury hotels in New York city are$324 on average. We
28:996:73451:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:want to be careful in not interpreting these costs as actual expenditures per night-booked.
28:997:73542:18:18:72:543:654:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Research byKalnins(2006)suggeststhatduetoreputationalconcerns,hotelstendtohave
28:998:73620:18:18:72:540:636:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:a price threshold below which they will not go, and this threshold is typically higher than
28:999:73711:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:the cost of an additional maid- or clerk-hour. We view our estimates as reflecting this price
28:1000:73804:18:18:72:540:600:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:threshold. The figure also plots the increasing component of hotels’ marginal costs. We find
28:1001:73896:18:18:72:540:582:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:that for all but one of the city and hotel combinations, marginal costs increase relatively
28:1002:73987:18:18:72:540:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:steeply with quantity when hotel occupancy reaches 85%. This increasing cost reflects the
28:1003:74076:18:18:72:540:546:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:fact that regardless of the level of competition, hotels will increase their prices as they
28:1004:74167:18:18:72:522:528:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:approach full capacity. TablesA7andA8report the full set of city-scale cost estimates.
28:1005:74253:18:18:89:540:510:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Finally, Figure10displays the mean costs over time for listings in New York City. Costs
28:1006:74340:18:18:72:540:492:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:vary over the course of the year, and there is a slightly increasing trend for all room options.
28:1007:74436:18:17:72:540:474:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:In New York but also in other cities, costs increase monotonically in listing quality, and the
28:1008:74530:17:18:72:540:457:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:mean costs exceed the mean transacted prices. These relatively high costs stem from the
28:1009:74617:18:18:72:540:439:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:fact that fewer than 50% of active listings on Airbnb typically transact (Table1). With
28:1010:74704:18:18:72:540:421:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:R-squared values ranging from .34 to .46, the variation in our data can explain a little
28:1011:74792:18:18:72:540:403:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:less of Airbnb costs than hotels’ costs. However, we estimate economically and statistically
28:1012:74884:18:18:72:540:385:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:significant dispersion in the cost distribution for all listing types, which explains the high
28:1013:74978:18:18:72:540:367:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:supply elasticity of Airbnb accommodations. Interestingly, costs go up during New Year’s
28:1014:75066:18:18:72:540:349:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Eve and other high seasons. This may reflect the fact that travelers during those times are
28:1015:75157:18:18:72:540:331:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:costlier to host, maybe because of their higher likelihood to be disruptive. Alternatively, it
28:1016:75251:18:18:72:540:313:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:may mean that during those periods hosts prefer to stay in their apartments with friends
28:1017:75339:18:18:72:539:295:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:and family rather than strangers. TableA9displays the full set of estimates of Airbnb costs
28:1018:75430:18:18:72:540:277:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:by listing type and city. The next section uses the estimates presented above to compare
28:1019:75518:18:39:72:293:259:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:realized welfare to a world without Airbnb.
28:1020:75561:39:25:72:278:220:206:g_d0_f2:206:g_d0_f2:5.2  Counterfactual Analysis
28:1021:75589:25:18:72:539:195:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:We present two counterfactual scenarios without Airbnb, and describe the e↵ect that the
28:1022:75676:18:18:72:540:177:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:absence of Airbnb would have for consumers, hotels, and peer hosts. The first counterfactual
28:1023:75768:18:18:72:540:159:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:scenario ignores hotel capacity constraints and how hotel prices would change if Airbnb
28:1024:75855:18:18:72:540:141:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:were not available. In this scenario, travelers who booked on Airbnb are allowed to book
28:1025:75943:18:18:72:540:123:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:any hotel option at the prevailing prices, regardless of actual room availability. The second
28:1026:76036:18:18:72:540:105:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:counterfactual scenario allows hotels to adjust prices in response to the absence of competing
28:1027:76130:18:15:81:539:87:49:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f9:16We also conducted a 10-folds cross-validation and found that the mean absolute error is similar between
28:1028:76235:15:0:72:413:72:99:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f9:estimation sample and hold-out sample, suggesting that we’re not over-fitting.
29:1029:76315:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:accommodations on Airbnb. This counterfactual requires computing new Cournot equilibria
29:1030:76402:18:18:72:538:690:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:for each market with demand and hotel cost parameters taken from our estimates.17We
29:1031:76485:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:refer to the first counterfactual as the ‘unconstrained’ scenario, and to the second as the
29:1032:76576:18:18:72:239:654:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:scenario with ‘price adjustment’.
29:1033:76609:18:18:89:540:636:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:We discuss consumer surplus first. Table8presents how consumer surplus would change
29:1034:76692:18:18:72:539:618:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:in 2014 without Airbnb. The table shows that there would be a$143 million loss in consumer
29:1035:76782:18:18:72:540:600:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:surplus if we could ignore hotels’ capacity constraints and price adjustments.  This loss
29:1036:76871:18:18:72:539:582:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:corresponds to$21 per room-night, about 15% of the purchase price. The consumer surplus
29:1037:76958:18:18:72:540:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:loss in this scenario only measures one channel through which Airbnb benefits consumers,
29:1038:77046:18:18:72:210:546:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:i.e. product di↵erentiation.
29:1039:77074:18:18:89:539:528:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Relative to the ‘unconstrained’ counterfactual, there are two additional mechanisms
29:1040:77157:18:18:72:540:510:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:through which the ‘price adjustment’ counterfactual hurts consumers. First, travelers who
29:1041:77246:18:18:72:540:492:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:booked on Airbnb now face higher hotel prices. Second, travelers who previously booked
29:1042:77332:18:17:72:540:474:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:hotel accommodations also face higher prices. The consumer surplus loss in this scenario
29:1043:77420:17:18:72:501:457:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:almost doubles, rising to$276 million. This loss corresponds to$41 per room-night.
29:1044:77502:18:18:89:538:439:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:We can also look at how consumer surplus losses vary across cities and time periods.
29:1045:77586:18:18:72:540:421:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:The total surplus from Airbnb is primarily determined by the number of Airbnb bookings in
29:1046:77675:18:18:72:540:403:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:that city. This means that the greatest aggregate losses from the removal of Airbnb are in
29:1047:77765:18:18:72:540:385:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. On a per room-night basis, the surplus change
29:1048:77852:18:18:72:297:367:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:is greatest for Seattle and lowest for Miami.
29:1049:77897:18:18:89:539:349:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:We also split our sample into ‘compression nights’, defined by the lodging industry to
29:1050:77983:18:18:72:540:331:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:be nights when hotels reach 95% occupancy, and non-compression nights. The surplus per
29:1051:78069:18:18:72:540:313:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:night booked is bigger on compression nights ($57) than on non-compression nights ($36).
29:1052:78157:18:18:72:540:295:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:This e↵ect is not due to travelers liking Airbnb more on these nights – the surplus per
29:1053:78244:18:18:72:540:277:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:night in the unconstrained counterfactual is nearly identical between these periods. Instead,
29:1054:78337:18:18:72:539:259:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:the e↵ect comes from the supply side.  When comparing the surplus per night between
29:1055:78420:18:17:72:540:241:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:the counterfactual with and without price adjustments, there is a$35 di↵erence during
29:1056:78505:17:18:72:540:224:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:compression nights versus$14 for non-compression nights. This occurs because hotels can
29:1057:78592:18:18:72:537:206:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:charge high prices during compression nights and the elastic host supply keep prices down.
29:1058:78682:18:18:89:540:188:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:We now turn to the e↵ects of Airbnb on hotels. If hotels did not have capacity constraints,
29:1059:78773:18:18:72:540:170:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Table10shows that hotels would increase the number of sold rooms by 2%. However, when
29:1060:78858:18:16:81:539:152:49:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f9:17Our estimation procedure doesn’t guarantee that, in the absence of Airbnb, the equilibrium quantities
29:1061:78961:16:12:72:540:136:99:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f9:remain below hotel capacity. We add an additional, although rarely binding, constraint in the price ad-
29:1062:79064:12:12:72:540:124:99:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f9:justment equilibrium which ensures that hotel quantities do not exceed an appropriately defined measure
29:1063:79167:12:12:72:540:112:99:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f9:of hotel capacity for each hotel type and period.  We define the threshold to be the maximum between
29:1064:79267:12:12:72:540:100:99:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f9:95% occupancy, the 99th percentile if occupancy for the city-scale and the observed occupancy level for a
29:1065:79372:12:0:72:249:88:99:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f9:particular hotel scale in a given city-day.
30:1066:79417:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:we account for capacity constraints and the increase in hotel prices, sold rooms would only
30:1067:79508:18:18:72:539:690:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:increase by 1.3%, for a revenue increase of 1.5%. This corresponds to a gain of$412 million
30:1068:79599:18:18:72:179:672:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:in revenue for hotels.
30:1069:79621:18:18:89:539:654:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:The e↵ects of Airbnb on hotel revenues are heterogeneous across cities and over time.
30:1070:79706:18:18:72:540:636:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:For example, in New York, bookings would increase by 2% and revenue would increase by
30:1071:79791:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:2.24% without Airbnb. In contrast, in San Jose, a city where hotels are less likely to hit
30:1072:79881:18:18:72:540:600:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:their capacity constraints, bookings would increase by .63% and revenues would increase
30:1073:79968:18:18:72:539:582:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:by .72%. There is also heterogeneity in e↵ects across high and low demand days. Hotel
30:1074:80053:18:18:72:540:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:bookings increase by just .99% on compression nights but revenues increase by 1.7%. On the
30:1075:80143:18:18:72:540:546:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:rest of the nights, bookings and revenues would both increase by about 1.4%. The di↵erence
30:1076:80233:18:18:72:539:528:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:across nights demonstrates that the e↵ect of Airbnb on hotels is more concentrated on prices
30:1077:80325:18:18:72:540:510:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:than quantities during high-demand days relative to low-demand days. If we take our cost
30:1078:80413:18:18:72:539:492:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:estimates seriously, we can also look at the e↵ect of Airbnb on hotel profits, which we
30:1079:80500:18:17:72:540:474:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:calculate as hotel revenue minus the non-increasing part of the cost function. We find that
30:1080:80591:17:18:72:540:457:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:profits would increase by 3.69% on average across all of the cities in the sample, with the
30:1081:80682:18:18:72:279:439:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:largest increase happening in New York.
30:1082:80721:18:18:89:539:421:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:We should note that our estimates give us a lower bound for hotel variable profit loss – or
30:1083:80812:18:18:72:540:403:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:an upper bound on the percent change. This is because the profit change does not directly
30:1084:80901:18:18:72:540:385:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:correspond to hotel surplus for at least three reasons. First, hotels earn additional revenues
30:1085:80995:18:18:72:540:367:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:through complimentary services such as conferences and food sales, but also incur additional
30:1086:81087:18:18:72:540:349:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:costs. Second, there are fixed costs involved in operating a hotel which we do not model in
30:1087:81178:18:18:72:540:331:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:this exercise. If competition from Airbnb is strong enough, then some hotels may close down
30:1088:81269:18:18:72:540:313:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:or new hotels may not be built. Third, our marginal cost estimates correspond in part to
30:1089:81357:18:18:72:540:295:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:reputation costs rather than ‘true’ marginal costs. These additional costs and revenues do
30:1090:81447:18:18:72:540:277:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:not allow us to state with certainty whether hotel surplus is larger or smaller than our profit
30:1091:81542:18:18:72:126:259:143:g_d0_f3:64:g_d0_f7:estimate.18
30:1092:81553:18:17:89:539:241:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Before moving to the surplus of peer hosts, we consider the extent to which Airbnb
30:1093:81635:17:18:72:539:224:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:expands the market versus cannibalizes hotel demand. Table11displays results on the share
30:1094:81724:18:18:72:540:206:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:of Airbnb travelers who would have booked a hotel room in the absence of Airbnb. In the
30:1095:81811:18:18:72:540:188:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:‘unconstrained’ scenario, between 27% and 34% of Airbnb bookings would not have resulted
30:1096:81899:18:18:72:540:170:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:in a hotel booking, which is broadly consistent with the survey moment used to estimate
30:1097:81986:18:18:72:539:152:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:demand. The market expansion e↵ect becomes much bigger when we account for capacity
30:1098:82069:18:18:72:540:134:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:constraints and hotels’ price responses. The share of Airbnb travelers who would have not
30:1099:82158:18:16:81:540:116:49:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f9:18In Appendix TableA10we display the results assuming an alternative measure of costs for hotels imputed
30:1100:82262:16:11:72:540:100:99:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f9:from the wage bill of hotels in the STR data and trends in the wages of maids across cities and over time.
30:1101:82368:11:0:72:350:89:99:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f9:This is likely a lower bound on the true marginal cost of hotels.
31:1102:82435:0:18:72:495:708:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:in fact booked a hotel room ranges between 42% in Portland to 63% in New York.
31:1103:82513:18:18:89:539:690:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Not surprisingly, peer hosts would lose without Airbnb.  We use the estimated cost
31:1104:82595:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:distributions of hosts to back out the surplus that they receive from hosting on Airbnb. The
31:1105:82687:18:0:72:475:654:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:surplus for each day can be calculated using the following expressionPSan=

31:1112:83088:18:18:72:539:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:surplus per night ranges between$23 in Miami and$30 in Austin. Across all bookings in
31:1113:83173:18:18:72:539:546:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:these cities, the average surplus is around$26 and does not vary much across high and low
31:1114:83262:18:18:72:540:528:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:demand days. In the aggregate, peer hosts enjoy$19 million in producer surplus, with hosts
31:1115:83352:18:18:72:540:510:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:in New York City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco getting the majority of it. Almost half of
31:1116:83443:18:45:72:534:492:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:this surplus is concentrated on compression nights, which comprise only 20% of all nights.
31:1117:83533:45:30:72:194:447:296:g_d0_f2:296:g_d0_f2:6  Conclusion
31:1118:83546:30:17:72:539:417:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:We have studied the economics of peer production in the lodging industry.  We first doc-
31:1119:83634:17:18:72:540:400:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:umented the determinants of peer supply and showed how market-specific factors such as
31:1120:83720:18:18:72:539:382:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:supply constraints and the costs of hosting a↵ect whether peer production is viable in a
31:1121:83808:18:18:72:540:364:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:given city. We then documented that peer supply is twice as elastic as hotel supply in the
31:1122:83898:18:18:72:123:346:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:short-run.
31:1123:83908:18:18:89:539:328:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:The highly elastic host supply implies that the largest e↵ects of Airbnb occur in markets
31:1124:83997:18:18:72:540:310:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:where hotels are often near full capacity.  We presented a simple model of competition
31:1125:84083:18:18:72:540:292:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:between peer supply and hotels, and tested its implications using data from 50 major US
31:1126:84170:18:18:72:540:274:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:cities. We confirm that the entry of Airbnb negatively a↵ects hotel revenues in cities where
31:1127:84262:18:18:72:540:256:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:hotels are more likely to be capacity-constrained, and that the e↵ect is more concentrated
31:1128:84352:18:18:72:480:238:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:on price than on quantity, at least compared to non-capacity-constrained cities.
31:1129:84432:18:18:89:539:220:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Next, we estimated our short-run equilibrium model to study the surplus and market
31:1130:84514:18:18:72:540:202:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:expansion e↵ects of Airbnb.  The availability of peer hosts generates$41 of surplus per
31:1131:84601:18:18:72:540:184:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:room-night in 2014. This surplus comes both from new bookings generated on Airbnb and
31:1132:84686:18:17:72:540:166:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:from lower prices paid by hotel travelers. In total, Airbnb generates$276 million in consumer
31:1133:84779:17:18:72:293:149:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:surplus in 2014 for the 10 largest US cities.
31:1134:84824:18:18:89:539:131:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:We showed that Airbnb has also a↵ected producers.  Without Airbnb, hotel revenues
31:1135:84905:18:18:72:540:113:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:would be 1.5% higher.  Nonetheless, between 42% and 63% of nights booked on Airbnb
31:1136:84987:18:18:72:540:95:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:would not have resulted in a hotel booking in the absence of Airbnb. These travelers would
31:1137:85077:18:0:72:540:77:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:have instead chosen the outside option, which could represent staying with friends or family,
32:1138:85172:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:staying at a non-hotel accommodation, booking fewer nights, or not traveling to the city at
32:1139:85263:18:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:all. Lastly, peer hosts also benefit from the introduction of Airbnb. Their average surplus
32:1140:85354:18:18:72:483:672:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:per night from hosting is$26, which totals$19 million in the estimation sample.
32:1141:85433:18:18:89:539:654:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Our data only extend through the end of 2014. Since then, Airbnb has continued its
32:1142:85515:18:18:72:540:636:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:rapid growth in both active listings and global awareness. While we cannot say how large
32:1143:85603:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:its e↵ects have been since then, our paper documents two fundamental reasons why peer
32:1144:85688:18:18:72:539:600:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:production is valuable in the accommodation industry.  First, peers o↵er a di↵erentiated
32:1145:85776:18:18:72:540:582:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:product that is not a perfect substitute to hotel rooms and is valued by consumers. Second,
32:1146:85867:18:18:72:540:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:the hotel sector in many cities is frequently constrained by a limited number of available
32:1147:85957:18:18:72:540:546:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:rooms, which lead to high prices during demand peaks because hotels cannot accommodate
32:1148:86043:18:18:72:540:528:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:all potential travelers. Peer production expands available supply at exactly these times of
32:1149:86134:18:18:72:493:510:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:peak demand, thus reducing hotel pricing power and increasing consumer surplus.
32:1150:86213:18:18:89:539:492:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Our paper also informs the active policy debate regarding whether and how to regulate
32:1151:86298:18:17:72:540:474:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:peer-to-peer accommodations. Proposed policies include fees and taxes, mandated registra-

32:1154:86554:18:18:72:540:421:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:gests that Airbnb is especially beneficial to consumer and host welfare during peak demand
32:1155:86644:18:18:72:248:403:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:periods in hotel constrained cities.
32:1156:86680:18:18:89:539:385:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:We have focused on the short-run e↵ects of a peer-to-peer platform on the agents directly
32:1157:86769:18:18:72:540:367:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:involved – hotels, peer hosts, and travelers – without highlighting the platform’s own costs
32:1158:86861:18:18:72:540:349:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:and revenues. In the longer run, the number of hotel rooms may also adjust to peer entry.
32:1159:86950:18:18:72:540:331:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:Peer production can have externalities and spillovers into other markets, including the labor
