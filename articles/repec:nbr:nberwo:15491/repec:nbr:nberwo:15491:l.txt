2:25:1262:28:28:273:338:616:12:Times:12:Times:?:ABSTRACT
2:26:1270:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:?:This essay proposes a set of non-econometric tests using data on wage structure, school resource costs,
2:27:1373:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:?:public expenditures, taxes, and rates of return to explain anomalies in which richer political units deliver
2:28:1481:14:28:72:229:560:12:Times:12:Times:?:less education than poorer ones. 
2:29:1514:28:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:?:Both the anomalies of education history, and its less surprising contrasts, fit broad patterns that can
2:30:1617:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:?:be revealed and partially explained using low-tech methods.  Over most of human history, contrasts
2:31:1715:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:?:in the output of education were driven mainly by contrasts in the supply of tax support for mass education.
2:32:1822:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:?:Exogenous influences on the demand for, and the private supply of, education played only lesser roles.
2:33:1924:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:?:Pro-growth public education could have emerged a century or two earlier than it did, had the leading
2:34:2024:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:?:countries of Western Europe mustered the political will to fund it.  Government underinvestment in
2:35:2122:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:?:mass education is demonstrated for England and Wales between 1717 and 1891.  Differences in political
2:36:2223:14:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:?:support still account for most of today’s education anomalies where the contrasts involve less developed
2:37:2327:14:28:72:116:420:12:Times:12:Times:?:regions.  
2:38:2337:28:14:72:540:392:12:Times:12:Times:?:In today’s highest-income settings, however, differences in tax funding lose their previous explanatory
2:39:2440:14:14:72:540:378:12:Times:12:Times:?:power.  The postwar shift away from strong effects of school resources calls for a renewed introduction
2:40:2543:14:42:72:350:364:12:Times:12:Times:?:of historical context into the “does money matter” debate.

3:48:3009:0:13:128:486:708:144:Times:144:Times:C:I. WHY WASN’T, AND ISN’T, THE WHOLE WORLD DEVELOPED? 
3:49:3061:13:21:90:93:695:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
3:50:3061:21:21:126:488:674:144:Times:144:Times:C: In an oft-cited presidential address, Richard Easterlin challenged economic 
3:51:3137:21:20:89:499:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:historians and development economists to come up with the simplest big reason why 
3:52:3219:20:21:90:489:633:144:Times:144:Times:B:most humans have been sentenced to live in poor and underdeveloped economies.  
3:53:3298:21:21:90:516:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:Honoring his own question, he suggested a single big issue to pursue.  To know why the 
3:54:3385:21:21:90:481:591:144:Times:144:Times:B:whole world isn’t developed, we should turn more attention to the lack of formal 
3:55:3466:21:20:90:515:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:schooling, especially primary school for the masses. Before 1940, less than four percent 
3:56:3555:20:21:90:523:550:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the total population was in school in most countries. Some have accelerated since then, 
3:57:3646:21:21:90:507:529:144:Times:144:Times:B:and some have not.  He did not try to explain this puzzle himself, but only conjectured 
3:58:3734:21:20:90:514:508:144:Times:144:Times:B:that “a major shift in political power” caused a positive shift in “the incentive structure” 
3:59:3827:20:21:90:190:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:for mass education.1 
3:60:3847:21:21:126:520:467:144:Times:144:Times:C: Education cannot be a monocausal explanation for underdevelopment, of course.  
3:61:3926:21:20:89:511:446:144:Times:144:Times:B:In the quarter century since Easterlin’s address, the search for a top global force behind 
3:62:4017:20:21:90:493:426:144:Times:144:Times:B:economic development has turned away from schooling toward other causal forces, 
3:63:4097:21:21:90:523:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:especially institutions that secure private property rights.  Considerable progress has been 
3:64:4190:21:21:90:497:384:144:Times:144:Times:B:made toward identifying historical-statistical instruments that can explain part of the 
3:65:4278:21:20:90:484:363:144:Times:144:Times:B:global differences in economic growth over recent centuries.2  The new empirical 
3:66:4359:20:21:90:516:343:144:Times:144:Times:B:institutionalism does agree that the advance of knowledge is crucial to growth, and most 
3:67:4448:21:21:90:509:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:empirical tests are sufficiently reduced-form to allow education policy to be part of the 
3:68:4538:21:20:90:524:301:144:Times:144:Times:B:causal machinery.  Yet the featured mechanisms are the security of private property rights 
3:69:4629:20:21:90:500:281:144:Times:144:Times:B:against piracy, theft, and government.  Even Gregory Clark’s challenge to the role of 
3:70:4715:21:21:90:512:260:144:Times:144:Times:B:institutions ignores policies toward formal mass education, although it does introduce a 
3:71:4804:21:20:90:423:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:human-capital argument about middle-class values and family size.3  
3:72:4872:20:21:126:517:219:144:Times:144:Times:C: Still, there are several reasons for going back to school, so to speak, in the search 
3:73:4958:21:21:90:498:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:for better explanations.  One is the power of history’s raw correlation: every country 
3:74:5045:21:20:90:521:177:144:Times:144:Times:B:where the average income has advanced beyond, say, a thousand PPP dollars of 1990 has 
3:75:5131:20:21:90:503:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:elevated its schooling, and has done so with public tax money, not waiting for private 
3:76:5218:21:21:90:493:136:144:Times:144:Times:B:markets to do the educating.  It would strain credibility to argue that this is purely a 
3:77:5307:21:21:90:508:115:144:Times:144:Times:B:reverse causation from economic growth to the level and funding of education. Surely, 
3:78:5393:21:42:90:517:94:144:Times:144:Times:B:any shock either to the supply of schooling or to output has a cumulative effect on both.  
4:79:5484:42:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        3                                                                        
4:80:5777:0:20:90:488:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:Even the recent studies that have downplayed the role of education in comparative 
4:81:5859:20:21:90:496:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:development have confirmed the significance of that role.  For example, a landmark 
4:82:5942:21:21:90:511:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:article by Mark Bils and Peter Klenow emphasizing that schooling cannot explain even 
4:83:6027:21:20:90:463:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:half the postwar differences in growth rates does firmly establish its minority 
4:84:6107:20:21:90:483:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:contribution, perhaps as much as a third of all postwar variance in GDP growth.4  
4:85:6189:21:21:126:503:605:144:Times:144:Times:C: A second reason to return to the role of formal schooling is that the traditional 
4:86:6271:21:20:90:502:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:externalities arguments are now being confirmed by empirical tests. The externalities 
4:87:6357:20:21:90:525:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:have proven significantly positive in recent econometric studies, despite the difficulties of 
4:88:6451:21:21:90:232:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:measuring external effects.5   
4:89:6482:21:21:126:505:522:144:Times:144:Times:C: How could we learn more from the human record about the causes and growth 
4:90:6556:21:20:90:521:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects of formal education?  Given the feedbacks between education and other variables, 
4:91:6645:20:21:90:276:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:there are four main kinds of evidence: 
4:92:6684:21:21:90:93:460:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
4:93:6684:21:20:126:508:439:144:Times:144:Times:C: (1) randomized natural experiments, the econometric “gold standard” of causal 
4:94:6762:20:21:89:159:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:identification; 
4:95:6778:21:21:125:520:398:144:Times:144:Times:C: (2) econometric estimates on panel or cross-sectional econometric samples where 
4:96:6858:21:20:89:404:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:the models fail to pass tests of instrument exogeneity and power; 
4:97:6924:20:21:125:374:357:144:Times:144:Times:C: (3) non-econometric quantitative comparisons; and 
4:98:6974:21:21:125:300:336:144:Times:144:Times:C: (4) non-quantitative historical data.  
4:99:7013:21:20:89:92:315:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
4:100:7013:20:21:89:502:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:Each of the four kinds of evidence has a contribution to make, because of each trades 
4:101:7099:21:21:90:510:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:weaknesses for strengths.  Their scientific reliability in identifying causality runs in the 
4:102:7192:21:21:90:503:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:order shown here, from (1) to (4).  Yet the empirical breadth and suggestive power of 
4:103:7278:21:20:90:515:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:their respective databases run in the opposite order.  At one extreme, naturalized natural 
4:104:7369:20:21:90:514:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:experiments have yielded the most solid evidence on the economic and health effects of 
4:105:7456:21:21:90:514:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:formal schooling, exploiting such randomizers as the calendar month of a person’s birth 
4:106:7544:21:20:90:490:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:or accidents in the sequence in which different U.S. states implemented mandatory 
4:107:7626:20:21:90:521:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:schooling laws.6  The price of this high credibility is the narrowness of the counterfactual 
4:108:7719:21:21:90:503:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:question answered (what if no mandatory schooling at that time, or what if the person 
4:109:7805:21:20:90:510:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:were born late in the year) and the narrowness of the historical context covered.  While 
4:110:7894:20:36:90:523:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:the share of history allowing randomized experiments will grow, it will always be a small 
5:111:7984:36:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        4                                                                        
5:112:8277:0:20:90:521:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:share of history.  To avoid discarding most of the human record, we must supplement the 
5:113:8365:20:21:90:509:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:best narrow tests with use of shakier testing of larger ranges of experience.  This paper 
5:114:8455:21:21:90:510:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:emphasizes the third technique, namely non-econometric quantitative comparisons, for 
5:115:8540:21:20:89:396:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:illuminating the sources and effects of extra formal schooling.   
5:116:8606:20:21:125:517:626:144:Times:144:Times:C: It turns out that low-tech handling of a set of qualitative indicators, buttressed by 
5:117:8692:21:21:89:523:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:some accounting measurements, allows us a great deal of causal insight. History has been 
5:118:8781:21:20:89:503:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:kind to us: While the different historical indicators might conceivably contradict each 
5:119:8869:20:21:90:504:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:other’s testimony, they often do not.  The power of those raw correlations has already 
5:120:8956:21:21:90:519:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:produced strong non-econometric comparative studies of the Americas by the Engerman-

5:122:9064:21:20:126:517:501:144:Times:144:Times:C: The reward for using improved non-econometric evidence is the identification of 
5:123:9144:20:21:90:390:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:some clear patterns in the history of education policy failures: 
5:124:9209:21:21:126:445:460:144:Times:144:Times:C: (1) Most of history makes it easy to find and demonstrate cases of 
5:125:9276:21:20:90:472:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:underinvestment in primary education, with no clear cases of overinvestment.   
5:126:9355:20:21:126:506:419:144:Times:144:Times:C: (2) For at least three centuries, underinvestment in primary education has been 
5:127:9435:21:21:89:524:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:mainly the result of political decision-making, not of private irrationality or of any lack of 
5:128:9530:21:20:90:512:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:technology that would reward those with extra schooling.  The one clear case of private 
5:129:9618:20:21:90:517:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:irrationality is many societies’ failure to educate daughters when the law allowed gender 
5:130:9708:21:21:90:258:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:equity in schooling and teaching.   
5:131:9744:21:20:126:511:315:144:Times:144:Times:C: (3) Indeed, some governments have even lost net revenue by under-investing in 
5:132:9822:20:21:90:523:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:mass education and failing to solve the familiar problem of capital market imperfections.  
5:133:9913:21:21:90:511:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:I illustrate with two cases in which the fiscal rate of return on extra schooling exceeded 
5:134:10004:21:21:90:497:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:the cost of government borrowing.  The risk-aversion argument, which may absolve 
5:135:10085:21:20:90:521:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:private individuals from the charge of irrationally passing up large expected returns, does 
5:136:10177:20:21:90:258:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:not apply to secure governments.   
5:137:10212:21:21:126:489:191:144:Times:144:Times:C: (4) The clearest failures have been inegalitarian, blocking education for the 
5:138:10290:21:20:90:520:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:masses while investing enough public funds in elite education to bid down its returns.  In 
5:139:10381:20:21:90:520:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:many cases, the inegalitarian bias shows signs of being linked to gender inequity as well. 
5:140:10472:21:21:90:508:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:History has still not offered a clear case of egalitarian failure to groom top talent while 
5:141:10564:21:56:90:318:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:delivering heaps of tax money to the masses.8   
6:142:10612:56:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        5                                                                        
6:143:10905:0:20:126:505:708:144:Times:144:Times:C: (5) Government underinvestment is likely to have occurred in several contexts 
6:144:10983:20:21:89:518:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:since the late seventeenth century.  In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the secure 
6:145:11075:21:21:90:509:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:states of Western Europe, particularly England, could have accelerated mass schooling 
6:146:11161:21:20:90:513:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:and growth two centuries before they actually did so. This paper also casts suspicion on 
6:147:11250:20:21:90:284:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:postwar governments in Latin America. 
6:148:11288:21:21:126:491:605:144:Times:144:Times:C: (6) Since the 1960s, however, the shortcomings in rich countries’ education 
6:149:11364:21:20:90:523:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:policies are less clearly related to under-funding.  With nearly full enrollments in primary 
6:150:11457:20:21:90:516:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:and secondary education, the frontier has shifted from education quantity to quality, and 
6:151:11547:21:21:90:445:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:inefficiency is replacing insufficiency as the locus of likely policy error.

6:154:11681:20:21:90:93:481:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
6:155:11681:21:21:126:506:460:144:Times:144:Times:C: Comparative historiography needs additional tools to explain the contrasts that 
6:156:11761:21:20:90:524:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:have occurred over a vast, but thinly quantified, historical record.  Making the most of the 
6:157:11854:20:21:90:513:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:available clues calls for a procedure that delivers clear qualitative conclusions when the 
6:158:11945:21:21:90:501:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:data fail to offer a randomized natural experiment. One can find which suspects were 
6:159:12030:21:20:90:499:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:responsible for historical contrasts in education outcomes, aided only by some of the 
6:160:12116:20:21:90:508:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:suspects’ movements, a few clearly valid behavioral assumptions, and some additional 
6:161:12201:21:21:90:308:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:contrasts, which we will call “fingerprints”.   
6:162:12249:21:20:125:512:315:144:Times:144:Times:C: To launch such a non-econometric inquiry into contrasting education outcomes, 
6:163:12327:20:21:90:498:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:we must begin with what we know to be a tight inter-relationship between education 
6:164:12410:21:21:90:498:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:achievement and the level of income.  Education achievement, or the contribution of 
6:165:12494:21:21:90:480:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:education to productive human capital, manifests itself partly in average years of 
6:166:12577:21:20:90:509:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:educational attainment and partly in some observable indicators of educational quality, 
6:167:12665:20:21:90:523:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:such as test scores.  Education achievement can also take forms that do not require formal 
6:168:12756:21:21:89:509:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:schooling, though they would be helped by it -- such forms as literacy and numeracy.9  
6:169:12843:21:20:90:476:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:Any dimension of this achievement (Ed) depends on incomes through these two

7:178:13441:21:21:90:515:644:144:Times:144:Times:B:and X is a vector of exogenous influences on Ed -- our leading suspects, it will turn out.  
7:179:13533:21:20:90:506:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:The a’s and b’s are vectors of coefficients, Z is a vector of exogenous influences on Y, 
7:180:13622:20:21:90:508:603:144:Times:144:Times:B:and the e’s are error terms.  Examples of X would be the strength of economic demand 
7:181:13707:21:21:90:471:582:144:Times:144:Times:B:for skills, social willingness to educate females, or government policies toward 
7:182:13788:21:24:90:499:561:144:Times:144:Times:B:education; and examples of Z would be geographic or historical luck, such as natural 
7:183:13873:24:28:90:505:537:144:Times:144:Times:B:resources, proximity to foreign markets, or the absence of war. The plus signs over a1 
7:184:13959:28:24:89:503:509:144:Times:144:Times:B:and b1 indicate two of our frugal assumptions: outputs of the education sector depend 
7:185:14045:24:26:90:502:485:144:Times:144:Times:B:positively on current average income, and income depends positively on the previous 
7:186:14129:26:25:90:519:459:144:Times:144:Times:B:generation’s education outputs, Edt-1. Using the assumed linear structure of coefficients, 
7:187:14220:25:21:89:431:434:144:Times:144:Times:B:the contrast between any two polities i = A and i = B, is represented by

7:189:14293:21:22:90:442:392:144:Times:144:Times:B:(3) ΔEdt=a1b1ΔEdt−1+a1b2ΔZt+a2ΔXt+Δeat+aΔ1ebt for education, and

7:191:14358:21:24:90:307:349:144:Times:144:Times:B:(4) ΔYt=b1ΔEdt−1+Δb2Zt+Δebt for income. 
7:192:14398:24:20:90:93:325:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
7:193:14398:20:21:90:474:305:144:Times:144:Times:B:To cut the differences in structure between polities, let us make the comparison 
7:194:14479:21:21:90:524:284:144:Times:144:Times:B:contemporaneous, so that either polity had the chance to draw from the same global menu 
7:195:14567:21:21:90:504:263:144:Times:144:Times:B:of technologies for providing education and for keeping adults alive and productive.10 
7:196:14653:21:20:125:510:242:144:Times:144:Times:C: So far, we have little way of constraining the set of possible explanations of the 
7:197:14736:20:21:89:523:222:144:Times:144:Times:B:difference between settings A and B.  To add more information, let us focus only on those 
7:198:14826:21:21:90:480:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:contrasts that are education-income anomalies, defined as cases where education 
7:199:14906:21:20:90:493:180:144:Times:144:Times:B:outcomes are higher in A than in B, or ΔEd > 0, even though B is richer in terms of 
7:200:14990:20:21:90:497:160:144:Times:144:Times:B:income, or ΔY < 0.  Such anomalies, with A more educated though B is richer, have 
7:201:15072:21:21:90:499:139:144:Times:144:Times:B:happened in a sizeable minority of historical settings over the last three centuries.  In 
7:202:15162:21:20:90:500:118:144:Times:144:Times:B:these anomalous cases, one can rule out either a poverty defense, or a Wagner’s Law 
7:203:15246:20:46:90:442:98:144:Times:144:Times:B:defense, that the country with less schooling simply could not afford it.11 
8:204:15321:46:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        7                                                                        
8:205:15614:0:20:126:521:708:144:Times:144:Times:C: For each of history’s anomalies, we now have a slightly narrower set of suspects.  
8:206:15697:20:21:90:516:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:Looking back at Equation (4), let us take a case in which A was as least as educated at B 
8:207:15786:21:21:89:510:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the previous generation too, and set the A-minus-B difference in Equation (4)’s error 
8:208:15875:21:22:91:494:646:143:Times:144:Times:B:eb at zero. Then the only way that A could have been poorer than B, as the anomaly 
8:209:15958:22:22:90:511:624:144:Times:144:Times:B:requires, is for the term Δb2Z to be negative.  That is, the anomaly requires that A must 
8:210:16048:22:21:90:495:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:have some exogenous disadvantage (natural resources, etc.) unrelated to education.  
8:211:16132:21:20:90:510:581:144:Times:144:Times:B:Turning back to Equation (3), our suspicions about how A got more education can now 
8:212:16216:20:22:90:481:561:144:Times:144:Times:B:focus on the term involving education-specific suspects (a2ΔX).  It seems safe to 
8:213:16298:22:22:90:512:539:144:Times:144:Times:B:conclude that this term a2ΔX plus any lagged advantage in previous education (ΔEdt−1) 
8:214:16384:22:21:90:514:517:144:Times:144:Times:B:should share in explaining at least 100 percent of the contrast in education, once we add 
8:215:16474:21:21:90:503:496:144:Times:144:Times:B:two reasonable assumptions: (1) the current contrast in education exceeds the income-
8:216:16559:21:21:90:450:475:144:Times:144:Times:B:transmitted effect of any previous education advantage that A had enjoyed 
8:217:16633:21:23:89:501:454:144:Times:144:Times:B:(ΔEdt>a1b1ΔEdt−1), and (2) the double difference in error terms (Δeat+aΔ1ebt) is not 
8:218:16718:23:20:90:134:431:144:Times:144:Times:B:positive. 
8:219:16728:20:21:125:524:411:144:Times:144:Times:C:  The tests still have only very limited power, however, since there can be a number 
8:220:16813:21:22:90:482:390:144:Times:144:Times:B:of education-specific suspects within that a2ΔX bundle.  Worse, many of these X 
8:221:16892:22:21:90:525:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:suspects cannot be measured.  A prime example would be exogenous differences in social 
8:222:16979:21:21:90:350:347:144:Times:144:Times:B:attitudes affecting the private demand for schooling.   
8:223:17035:21:20:126:513:326:144:Times:144:Times:C: Fortunately, the historical record often leaves additional fingerprints in the form 
8:224:17119:20:27:90:502:306:144:Times:144:Times:B:of other features left by the same education-specific suspects (the X’s).  There will be 
8:225:17208:27:25:90:507:279:144:Times:144:Times:B:several observable features, Fi’s, that may be linearly related to the X’s, Z’s, and other 
8:226:17299:25:21:90:144:254:144:Times:144:Times:B:forces V’s:

8:234:17570:21:32:90:297:84:144:Times:144:Times:B:poorer country the more educated country.

9:237:17981:20:21:90:508:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:anomalous contrasts.  The framework has been a parsimonious one, involving only the 
9:238:18065:21:21:90:327:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:following kinds of assumptions and information: 
9:239:18113:21:20:90:93:646:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
9:240:18113:20:21:126:517:626:144:Times:144:Times:C: (a) the assumption that a greater education of the previous generation of students 
9:241:18196:21:22:90:281:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:raises current national product (b1 > 0); 
9:242:18238:22:22:125:505:583:144:Times:144:Times:C: (b) the assumption that greater income raises investment in education (a1 > 0); 
9:243:18318:22:21:126:505:561:144:Times:144:Times:C: (c) the observed anomaly that A is more educated than richer country B, which 
9:244:18396:21:22:90:515:540:144:Times:144:Times:B:allows us to rule out a net explanatory effect of the exogenous non-education influences 
9:245:18485:22:21:89:197:518:144:Times:144:Times:B:on income (the ΔZ’s); 
9:246:18507:21:22:125:370:497:144:Times:144:Times:C: (d) data on additional fingerprints (the ΔFi’s); and 
9:247:18560:22:20:126:520:475:144:Times:144:Times:C: (e) the assumption that we know the signs of various coefficients, though we lack 
9:248:18642:20:21:90:325:455:144:Times:144:Times:B:reliable estimates of their absolute magnitudes.   
9:249:18693:21:21:90:93:434:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
9:250:18693:21:21:90:475:413:144:Times:144:Times:B:The sharpness of our explanation will depend on the specifics of each historical 
9:251:18774:21:20:90:502:392:144:Times:144:Times:B:comparison. In some cases, we will find too many X’s that could contribute uncertain 
9:252:18859:20:21:90:513:372:144:Times:144:Times:B:amounts to the observed contrast, and our explanation will remain incomplete.  In other 
9:253:18947:21:21:90:523:351:144:Times:144:Times:B:lucky “natural experiments”, we will be fortunate enough to find only 1-3 suspects guilty, 
9:254:19038:21:20:90:512:330:144:Times:144:Times:B:yielding a fairly clear explanation of each contrast.  Better still, the clear cases will turn 
9:255:19133:20:21:90:379:310:144:Times:144:Times:B:out to have some clear patterns, inviting global conjectures. 
9:256:19195:21:21:90:93:289:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
9:257:19195:21:20:204:410:268:144:Times:144:Times:C:III. WHERE WERE THE ANOMALIES? 
9:258:19226:20:21:90:162:248:144:Times:144:Times:B:  
9:259:19228:21:21:126:503:227:144:Times:144:Times:C: History has left us enough numbers to sketch a global history of the education 
9:260:19307:21:21:90:505:206:144:Times:144:Times:B:anomalies featured in this paper.  There are many cases in which a poorer country has 
9:261:19393:21:20:90:512:185:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher education outputs than a richer country, even though most comparisons find that 
9:262:19480:20:21:90:277:165:144:Times:144:Times:B:richer countries have more schooling.  
9:263:19519:21:21:126:511:144:144:Times:144:Times:C: The anomalies algorithm looks very symmetrical, though my paper title is not.   
9:264:19599:21:20:90:507:123:144:Times:144:Times:B:In principal, each anomaly invites these choices between mirror-image interpretations: 
9:265:19686:20:51:90:93:103:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
10:266:19686:51:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        9                                                                        
10:267:19979:0:20:90:519:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:• “Richer Country B ‘succeeded’ in becoming richer, despite less education, due to some 
10:268:20067:20:21:126:483:688:144:Times:144:Times:C:wiser use of resources” versus “Country B failed on the education front.”  
10:269:20142:21:21:90:511:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:• “Country A spent too much tax money on schooling” versus “Richer Country B spent 
10:270:20225:21:20:126:296:646:144:Times:144:Times:C:too little tax money on schooling”. 
10:271:20261:20:21:90:93:626:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
10:272:20261:21:21:90:506:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:In each case the second interpretation seems to hold more promise.  One reason is that 
10:273:20348:21:20:90:522:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:education outcomes are more policy-malleable than oil deposits and other exogenous “Z” 
10:274:20435:20:21:90:508:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:influences on income, making for a more inviting research agenda.  Another is that the 
10:275:20522:21:21:90:524:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:rate of return evidence suggests under-investment failures, not over-investment failures in 
10:276:20614:21:21:90:520:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:the education sector.  Finally, anomalous successes in test scores (e.g. Finland and Korea 
10:277:20705:21:20:90:522:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:in PISA today) seem to depend more on pedagogical efficiencies and ethnic homogeneity 
10:278:20791:20:21:90:498:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:than to economic policy, offering less reward for applying economic historiography. 
10:279:20875:21:21:126:503:460:144:Times:144:Times:C: The nature of quantifiable education outputs has drifted over time.  Before the 
10:280:20955:21:20:90:489:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:mid-nineteenth century the most widely available indicator was literacy. The early 
10:281:21038:20:21:90:494:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:literacy history, say between the early seventeenth century and the early nineteenth, 
10:282:21124:21:21:90:486:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:contained few anomalies.  Broadly, in the centuries before public schooling, those 
10:283:21207:21:20:90:488:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries with more prosperous middle and upper classes tended to purchase more 
10:284:21287:20:21:90:522:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:literacy for their children.  The best-known alleged exception is the relatively high rate of 
10:285:21381:21:21:90:501:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:literacy in not-so-rich Sweden, the “impoverished sophisticate” of the eighteenth and 
10:286:21467:21:20:90:486:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:nineteenth centuries.  Yet even here the anomaly was not dramatic, since Swedish 
10:287:21548:20:21:90:516:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:children were highly literate but not so highly schooled. That is, they learned to read the 
10:288:21640:21:21:90:522:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:Bible, but did not stay in school for many years, as revealed by nineteenth-century data.12 
10:289:21731:21:21:126:508:253:144:Times:144:Times:C: From the middle of the nineteenth century to the late twentieth, the most useful 
10:290:21812:21:20:90:518:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:indicator of education outputs was the overall enrollment rate for primary and secondary 
10:291:21901:20:21:90:522:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:school.  Figures 1 through 4 follow this indicator from 1870 to 2000, with the slight twist 
10:292:21993:21:21:90:497:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:that the data for 2000 have cumulated earlier enrollments into an overall educational 
10:293:22079:21:20:90:516:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:attainment of the entire adult population.  Figures 5 through 7 then introduce the kind of 
10:294:22170:20:21:90:520:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:education output measure that will dominate discussions of the twenty-first century:  Not 
10:295:22260:21:21:90:515:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:years of schooling, which are converging over time, but achievement test scores that are 
10:296:22349:21:56:90:511:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:designed to measure education quality over the primary and secondary school years.13   
11:297:22436:56:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        10                                                                        
11:298:22730:0:20:126:514:708:144:Times:144:Times:C: Within and across the regions of the world, some anomalies have persisted since 
11:299:22810:20:21:90:494:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:the mid-nineteenth century, while others have vanished or have appeared only more 
11:300:22892:21:21:90:517:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:recently.  In the community defined by Northwest Europe and its overseas offshoots, the 
11:301:22980:21:20:90:512:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:main past anomaly related to the performance of England and Wales.  In the nineteenth 
11:302:23066:20:21:90:478:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:century, when England and Wales led in national income, it lagged behind some 
11:303:23144:21:21:90:524:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries in enrollments.  By the late twentieth century, its position -- more precisely, that 
11:304:23239:21:20:90:495:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the United Kingdom -- had been transformed.  As Figures 1 and 2 show for 1870-
11:305:23320:20:21:90:513:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:1900, the United Kingdom as a whole sent a noticeably lower share of children through 
11:306:23406:21:21:90:513:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:school than did Canada, the United States, New Zealand and Australia, even though the 
11:307:23492:21:21:90:512:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:UK was the richer country in most comparisons.  In 1870, Figure 1 allows us a glimpse 
11:308:23578:21:20:90:510:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:of how the international contrasts differed for the different nations within the UK.  The 
11:309:23668:20:21:90:509:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:real anomaly indeed relates to the wealthier English-Welsh part of the Kingdom.  Why 
11:310:23753:21:21:90:509:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:did it have lower enrollments relative to Scotland, as well as relative to North America 
11:311:23842:21:20:90:498:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Australasia?  This case study will be pursued in Section VI below.  For now, the 
11:312:23927:20:21:90:480:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:important point to note is that the English lag was indeed temporary.  By the late 
11:313:24010:21:21:90:478:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:twentieth century the United Kingdom had slightly higher enrollments and adult 
11:314:24089:21:20:90:504:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:educational attainments that the United States and the rest (Figure 4), and in the PISA 
11:315:24177:20:21:89:498:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:achievement tests of the early twenty-first century Britain’s 15-year-olds were in the 
11:316:24264:21:21:89:511:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:middle of the OECD cluster (in Figure 5), scoring higher than their U.S. counterparts.   
11:317:24353:21:20:126:511:315:144:Times:144:Times:C: A more persistent anomaly is the education underperformance of much of Latin 
11:318:24430:20:21:90:505:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:America relative to East Asia and Eastern Europe. So say the available contrasts in all 
11:319:24518:21:21:90:516:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:five figures, e.g. in the lower enrollments in the South American countries than in Japan 
11:320:24608:21:21:90:495:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:in 1870-1930, when Japan’s income was much lower (Figures 1-3). Latin American 
11:321:24687:21:20:90:519:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:schooling also lagged behind that of the Caribbean region.  That is, the anomalies tended 
11:322:24777:20:21:90:525:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:to contrast poorer and better-schooled countries around the Caribbean with richer and less 
11:323:24868:21:21:90:490:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:schooled South Americans.  Specifically, Costa Rica, Cuba, Jamaica, and Trinidad-
11:324:24949:21:20:90:479:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:Tobago have generally been ahead in education despite their not being as rich as 
11:325:25030:20:21:90:493:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, and Venezuela.  The most persistent historical anomaly 
11:326:25112:21:21:89:524:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:contrasts better-schooled Costa Rica with underperforming Venezuela evident all the way 
11:327:25200:21:56:89:402:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:from 1930 (Figure 3) through the test scores of 2006 (Figure 6).  
12:328:25266:56:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        11                                                                        
12:329:25560:0:20:126:524:708:144:Times:144:Times:C: The Middle East also has puzzling contrasts, at least in the data available since the 
12:330:25646:20:21:90:514:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:late twentieth century (Figures 4 and 5 again).  The better-educated yet poorer countries 
12:331:25736:21:21:90:499:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:cluster in Anatolia and the Levant, as shown by the national observations for Jordan, 
12:332:25822:21:20:90:506:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:Lebanon, Syria, and Turkey.  By contrast, enrollments and test scores tend to be much 
12:333:25908:20:21:90:517:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:lower in Tunisia and in the oil-rich countries of North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, 
12:334:25998:21:21:90:511:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:according to data from Algeria, Libya, Saudi Arabia, and Oman.14 These anomalies are 
12:335:26083:21:20:90:463:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:only partly due to differences in the education of females, and call for further 
12:336:26164:20:21:90:152:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:explanation. 
12:337:26177:21:21:126:512:543:144:Times:144:Times:C: Africa and Asia have their own output anomalies.  These get less attention here, 
12:338:26258:21:21:89:511:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:since Africa and Asia are just beginning to participate in international testing programs 
12:339:26348:21:20:89:521:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:like PISA.  Within sub-Saharan Africa, the South and East tend to be more schooled than 
12:340:26436:20:21:90:506:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:the North and West, partly because the North and West still discriminate more against 
12:341:26522:21:21:90:511:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:females in education.  This produces some education-income anomalies like Figure 4’s 
12:342:26607:21:20:90:496:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:contrast between Malawi (poorer, more schooled in 1970) and Niger (less poor, less 
12:343:26690:20:21:90:514:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:schooled).15  Within Asia, the main anomalies are success cases, rising above the global 
12:344:26779:21:21:90:507:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:draft of education with income.  In the early going, Japan achieved far more schooling 
12:345:26866:21:20:90:525:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:than its income would have predicted (Figures 2 and 3).  In the postwar era, it is joined by 
12:346:26959:20:21:90:512:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:Korea, which has combined long average years of schooling with test scores that match 
12:347:27045:21:21:90:513:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:or exceed those of any richer Asian country (Figures 4 and 5).  And at the poorer end of 
12:348:27134:21:20:90:508:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:the spectrum, China has achieved more years of average schooling than any country in 
12:349:27219:20:21:90:154:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:South Asia.   
12:350:27232:21:21:126:483:274:144:Times:144:Times:C: The final illustration of revealed output anomalies draws on a present-day 
12:351:27307:21:21:90:517:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:American puzzle, which a larger literature, much of it econometric, has already tackled.  
12:352:27397:21:20:90:510:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:In Figure 7, as in Figures 5 and 6, the education output measure is a test-score average, 
12:353:27487:20:21:90:522:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:but this time the polities are states within the United States rather than nations.  The main 
12:354:27581:21:21:90:515:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:interregional pattern should be familiar to any student of U.S. education history: despite 
12:355:27672:21:20:90:523:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:postwar convergence, the Southeast still has lower incomes and lower test scores than the 
12:356:27762:20:21:90:522:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:Northeast and North Central regions.  The main anomaly appears in the West: California, 
12:357:27850:21:21:90:500:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:Nevada, and Hawaii have peculiarly low test scores for their income levels, and New 
12:358:27934:21:20:90:483:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:Mexico also tests poorly relative to lower-income Louisiana.  There is something 
12:359:28015:20:36:90:506:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:distinctly worse about California’s primary-secondary schooling, even after the ethnic 
13:360:28102:36:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        12                                                                        
13:361:28396:0:20:90:509:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:mix and immigrant share have been held constant.  So one would gather from a simple 
13:362:28480:20:21:90:464:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:comparison of California with middling Texas in Figure 7, and so say several 
13:363:28557:21:21:90:492:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:econometric studies.16  Thus our simple way of mapping anomalies seems to fit the 
13:364:28639:21:20:90:482:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:econometric results and institutional realities of this well-documented case.  Less 
13:365:28723:20:21:90:481:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:resolved, however, is the debate over the underlying causes of America’s current 
13:366:28804:21:21:90:403:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:anomalies in education output, and we return to this debate later.

13:368:28871:20:21:111:504:564:144:Times:144:Times:C:IV. WHAT HELD BACK MASS EDUCATION? LINING UP THE SUSPECTS 
13:369:28929:21:21:90:93:543:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
13:370:28929:21:21:126:521:522:144:Times:144:Times:C: To explain history’s education-and-income contrasts, let us begin by lining up the 
13:371:29012:21:22:90:519:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:forces most often suspected of holding back education (the ΔX’s) as row headings on the 
13:372:29100:22:20:90:523:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:left side of Table 1.  The suspects are grouped into demand-side and supply-side forces in 
13:373:29191:20:21:90:261:459:144:Times:144:Times:B:the market for primary schooling.   
13:374:29227:21:21:126:493:438:144:Times:144:Times:C: The most obvious demand-side force that might have retarded education for 
13:375:29301:21:20:90:475:417:144:Times:144:Times:B:millennia would be a lack of demand for the kind of labor that requires literacy, 
13:376:29383:20:21:89:493:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:numeracy, and other skills that schools might help to deliver.  We naturally, though 
13:377:29468:21:21:90:480:376:144:Times:144:Times:B:wrongly, suspect that most of our ancestors were unschooled largely because the 
13:378:29548:21:20:90:521:355:144:Times:144:Times:B:economy had no jobs that called for schooling.  One might accuse this first suspect if one 
13:379:29639:20:21:90:495:335:144:Times:144:Times:B:sought to summarize all history before, say, the Industrial Revolution as a setting in 
13:380:29726:21:21:90:494:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:which the backward state of technology forced people to make their living with raw 
13:381:29809:21:21:90:511:293:144:Times:144:Times:B:labor.  The first row of Table 1 says that such low demand for skills should have raised 
13:382:29898:21:20:90:515:272:144:Times:144:Times:B:the relative child (unskilled) wage, lowered the adult gains from education, and lowered 
13:383:29987:20:21:90:249:252:144:Times:144:Times:B:all rates of return on education.   
13:384:30023:21:21:126:502:231:144:Times:144:Times:C: In the second row stands its close relative, high demand for child labor (in the 
13:385:30104:21:20:90:506:210:144:Times:144:Times:B:less-educated setting B). We often believe that children have stayed away from school 
13:386:30190:20:21:89:504:190:144:Times:144:Times:B:because their parents felt they could earn good wages at an early age without going to 
13:387:30277:21:21:89:474:169:144:Times:144:Times:B:class or studying. In the manufacturing zone of northern England, the Industrial 
13:388:30358:21:20:89:501:148:144:Times:144:Times:B:Revolution famously kept children out of school, a problem that provoked a series of 
13:389:30443:20:21:89:524:128:144:Times:144:Times:B:child labor laws and compulsory schooling laws.17 The second row in Table 1 poses ways 
13:390:30530:21:21:89:523:107:144:Times:144:Times:B:to test this possibility.  If it were the dominant constraint, and other things were equal, we 
13:391:30625:21:34:90:504:86:144:Times:144:Times:B:would see higher wage rates for children, less educational attainment, and thus higher 
14:392:30712:34:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        13                                                                        
14:393:31006:0:22:90:505:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:adult-wage gains from skills (ΔW) and higher rates of return for those who invested in 
14:394:31093:22:20:90:149:686:144:Times:144:Times:B:education.   
14:395:31106:20:21:126:518:666:144:Times:144:Times:C: Next come some demographic forces that must have played at least a partial role, 
14:396:31187:21:21:90:513:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:leaving us the task of deciding how big a role and when.  Higher fertility would make it 
14:397:31276:21:20:90:506:624:144:Times:144:Times:B:harder for parents in place B to afford schooling, even though it would not necessarily 
14:398:31364:20:21:90:515:604:144:Times:144:Times:B:affect the market price of schools.  Human capital per child would be lowered.18  Larger 
14:399:31453:21:21:89:521:583:144:Times:144:Times:B:families would also supply more children to the low-skill labor market, bidding down the 
14:400:31542:21:20:89:514:562:144:Times:144:Times:B:child wage and bidding up the skilled-wage premium among adults once the adult labor 
14:401:31627:20:21:89:496:542:144:Times:144:Times:B:supply tilted toward less schooling.  The shift toward supplying less skilled workers 
14:402:31713:21:21:89:451:521:144:Times:144:Times:B:would also raise the rates of return for those who received extra education. 
14:403:31790:21:21:125:501:500:144:Times:144:Times:C: Another demographic force probably played a major role in delaying the shift 
14:404:31867:21:20:89:506:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:toward more schooling. Short adult life expectancy should have shortened the average 
14:405:31952:20:21:89:522:459:144:Times:144:Times:B:work career and held down the rates of return on schooling, even though it may also have 
14:406:32041:21:21:89:488:438:144:Times:144:Times:B:bid up the wage premium by supplying less skilled labor per year.  This prolonged 
14:407:32123:21:20:89:514:417:144:Times:144:Times:B:restraint was removed only with the arrival of modern health improvements.  As will be 
14:408:32210:20:21:89:520:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:argued below, one background reason why educational attainment is higher in Mexico or 
14:409:32296:21:21:89:485:376:144:Times:144:Times:B:India today than in England or America back in the early nineteenth century, with 
14:410:32378:21:20:89:509:355:144:Times:144:Times:B:roughly comparable incomes, is that Mexicans and Indians can now expect to use their 
14:411:32463:20:21:89:233:335:144:Times:144:Times:B:skills over longer careers.19    
14:412:32496:21:21:126:478:314:144:Times:144:Times:C: It is particularly natural to attribute the long delay of formal schooling to 
14:413:32574:21:21:89:490:293:144:Times:144:Times:B:fundamental social attitudes, represented in Table 1 by the row “family distaste for 
14:414:32659:21:20:89:512:272:144:Times:144:Times:B:schooling.” This rubric is meant to include a host of inertial instincts that parents might 
14:415:32751:20:21:90:507:252:144:Times:144:Times:B:have, such as “Your grandparents didn’t need schooling to live a decent life, nor did I, 
14:416:32840:21:21:90:515:231:144:Times:144:Times:B:and neither do you” or “Don’t try to move into a strange life where you’re not wanted”.  
14:417:32929:21:20:90:490:210:144:Times:144:Times:B:If it were the dominant retarding force in context B, then we should expect to see a 
14:418:33014:20:21:90:507:190:144:Times:144:Times:B:persistence of high skill premiums and high rates of return to extra schooling for those 
14:419:33103:21:21:90:192:169:144:Times:144:Times:B:few who obtained it. 
14:420:33124:21:20:126:515:148:144:Times:144:Times:C: Discrimination is also a leading suspect, on both the demand side and the supply 
14:421:33205:20:21:90:500:128:144:Times:144:Times:B:side of the market for primary schooling.  It has checked demand for schooling when 
14:422:33289:21:21:90:502:107:144:Times:144:Times:B:employers or powerful competing groups deny a large share of the population its free 
14:423:33374:21:34:90:520:86:144:Times:144:Times:B:access to jobs that would use the schooling.  Classic examples are refusal to hire women, 
15:424:33464:34:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        14                                                                        
15:425:33758:0:20:90:511:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:or to hire members of a disadvantaged race or caste or tribe.  Job market discrimination 
15:426:33847:20:21:90:503:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:should raise the skilled wage and raise all rates of return on education for those in the 
15:427:33937:21:21:90:164:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:favored group. 
15:428:33952:21:20:126:476:646:144:Times:144:Times:C: On the supply side, discrimination can also be practiced in the education 
15:429:34026:20:21:90:521:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:admissions process, by restricting entry from any of the same groups of outsiders.  Either 
15:430:34117:21:21:90:488:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:kind of discrimination lowers the use of persons with high ability, and drags down 
15:431:34200:21:20:90:504:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:outsiders’ incentive to get that schooling.  It would show up in the data, however, in a 
15:432:34289:20:21:90:520:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:deceiving way. The measured skilled wage premiums and the rates of return to education 
15:433:34376:21:21:90:510:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:would all look higher, even though the true wage rates and rates of return are lower for 
15:434:34465:21:21:89:479:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:those denied access.  The literature on rates of return to education has repeatedly 
15:435:34549:21:20:89:487:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:reminded us of this point when discussing “screening” and the use of best-schools 
15:436:34631:20:21:89:519:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:connections to allocate and restrict top jobs in government or guilds.  Where screening is 
15:437:34722:21:21:90:482:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:based on ability (innate talent plus parental background), the marginal product of 
15:438:34805:21:20:90:482:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:schooling looks deceivingly high because those outside the margin would be less 
15:439:34885:20:21:90:508:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:productive.  Even in the less ability-biased kinds of discrimination, the returns can still 
15:440:34977:21:21:90:509:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:deceive, because competition would have bid down the rates of pay being protected by 
15:441:35062:21:20:90:497:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:discriminatory education.  When discrimination is a prime suspect, the historian and 
15:442:35147:20:21:90:523:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:economist must decide with the help of clues not shown in Table 1.  In some cases, that is 
15:443:35238:21:21:90:520:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:easy.  For example, discrimination against female education retards education and output 
15:444:35327:21:20:90:514:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:in ways that are easy to quantify once one has data on education and wages by gender.   
15:445:35415:20:21:126:515:295:144:Times:144:Times:C: Alternatively, schooling may have been blocked through much of history simply 
15:446:35493:21:21:90:494:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:because it had a high unit costs (or out-of-pocket costs, or “direct” costs) relative to 
15:447:35582:21:21:90:484:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:average income levels.  Those high costs could have taken the form of ineffective 
15:448:35664:21:20:89:514:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:teaching technology or high prices for such school inputs as teachers, books, paper, and 
15:449:35753:20:21:89:518:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:safe buildings.  Such a possibility should be weighed by direct observation of high costs, 
15:450:35844:21:22:89:493:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:and if possible by weighing their negative effect on the private and social returns to 
15:451:35931:22:21:89:522:169:144:Times:144:Times:B:schooling.  Indirectly they should also have tended to hold up the pay premiums (ΔW) for 
15:452:36020:21:20:89:301:148:144:Times:144:Times:B:those few who acquired the skills anyway.   
15:453:36064:20:21:125:521:128:144:Times:144:Times:C: Schooling will also have been lower in settings where there was less philanthropy 
15:454:36146:21:55:89:505:107:144:Times:144:Times:B:to support it.  The signs of such a lack of charity are simply its low level and the same 
16:455:36236:55:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        15                                                                        
16:456:36530:0:20:90:522:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects that Table 1 showed for family distaste for schooling, except that denial of charity 
16:457:36623:20:21:89:422:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:also lowers the private rate of return for those who do get educated.   
16:458:36695:21:21:125:501:667:144:Times:144:Times:C: The final rows in Table 1 examine the imprints of the suspect that will end up 
16:459:36774:21:20:89:493:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:being featured in this essay:  The relative denial of tax support for basic education.  
16:460:36862:20:21:89:509:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:Whatever its causes, it leaves a distinctive set of fingerprints.  Without tax support, the 
16:461:36954:21:21:89:522:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:private returns to schooling will be lower and the restricted group receiving the schooling 
16:462:37046:21:20:89:514:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:will enjoy higher pay premiums.  Society as a whole will also get lower returns.  Unlike 
16:463:37135:20:21:89:514:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:other suspected causes of low schooling, the denial of tax support in one setting relative 
16:464:37226:21:21:89:515:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:to another will leave its traces in relatively available fiscal data.  Table 1 points this out, 
16:465:37322:21:21:89:521:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:by selecting two indicators of tax support for primary schooling, both of which tend to be 
16:466:37413:21:20:89:508:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:relatively measurable even for less developed countries and for centuries past. We will 
16:467:37501:20:21:89:475:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:look at these tax-support measures more closely when reviewing the evidence.   
16:468:37580:21:21:125:488:460:144:Times:144:Times:C: Looking down the rows of Table 1, one notices that two of the best-known 
16:469:37653:21:20:89:493:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:suspects are missing.  First, as mentioned when we defined anomalies above, lower 
16:470:37735:20:21:89:505:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:income would obviously restrain the demand for education. Yet income should not be 
16:471:37818:21:21:89:520:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:listed in Table 1 because it is too central, too endogenous to any model of how education 
16:472:37908:21:20:90:501:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:interacts with the economy. Income and education have tight simultaneous links, and 
16:473:37992:20:21:90:518:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:progress together, as noted earlier.  One needs a lucky natural experiment to quantify the 
16:474:38083:21:21:90:524:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:education effects of an income shock, or the income effects of an education shock.  While 
16:475:38173:21:20:90:512:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:some econometric studies have succeeded in exploiting such natural experiments, these 
16:476:38259:20:21:90:486:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:studies are few in number and their conclusions quantify what was already known 
16:477:38339:21:21:90:486:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:qualitatively:  positive income shocks raise investments in education, and positive 
16:478:38423:21:21:90:508:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:education shocks (e.g. mandatory schooling laws) raise income, yet the slopes of these 
16:479:38510:21:20:89:498:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:relationships are not known so securely that we can simply subtract a known income 
16:480:38593:20:21:89:522:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:effect to distill exogenous influences on education.  This, again, is why this study focuses 
16:481:38686:21:21:89:510:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:on anomalous cases in which education was held back despite a (B) polity’s having the 
16:482:38772:21:20:90:446:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:same or higher income than a polity (A) that invested more in education.   
16:483:38847:20:21:125:508:150:144:Times:144:Times:C: Second, what about the familiar problem of credit constraints?  Education is an 
16:484:38927:21:21:90:511:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:expensive investment, and perhaps the central constraint in all lower-education settings 
16:485:39016:21:20:90:518:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:had simply been the fact that poor parents find it harder get financing for their children’s 
16:486:39109:20:36:90:497:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:education.  Credit constraints, like income, are central to any explanation of why the 
17:487:39196:36:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        16                                                                        
17:488:39490:0:20:90:517:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:whole world has had so little education, yet like income they do not belong on the list of 
17:489:39581:20:21:90:493:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:exogenous suspects in Table 1.  The reason, again, is that they are too central to the 
17:490:39668:21:21:90:509:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:history of backwardness, and too correlated with income.  The poorer a household or a 
17:491:39754:21:20:90:519:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:whole society, the harder it is to gain the trust of lenders, for education or any other long-
17:492:39848:20:21:89:506:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:term investment.  Other forces must intervene to remove these constraints.  One might 
17:493:39934:21:21:89:510:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:wish that improvements in the private financial sector would have provided the keys to 
17:494:40021:21:20:89:499:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:financing schooling, yet history offers relatively little hope of a low risk premium on 
17:495:40109:20:21:89:522:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:private student loans for the masses.  Rather the crucial capital for mass private education 
17:496:40202:21:21:89:524:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:has been provided by tax-based subsidies.  History suggests a corner solution: No country 
17:497:40292:21:21:89:497:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:has achieved universal primary education without relying mainly on taxes.  Thus for 
17:498:40376:21:20:89:499:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:primary education the problem of credit supply lurks in the last rows of Table 1: The 
17:499:40462:20:21:89:507:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:issue is why some countries have been slower than others in supplying the tax funding 
17:500:40548:21:21:89:384:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:that would solve the credit constraint for primary education.

17:502:40611:20:21:206:408:419:144:Times:144:Times:C:V. THREE KINDS OF FINGERPRINTS 
17:503:40642:21:21:89:92:398:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
17:504:40642:21:20:125:496:377:144:Times:144:Times:C: The clues, or quantitative indicators, listed in Table 1 help us sort among the 
17:505:40722:20:21:89:518:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:lined-up suspects.  In fact, they also advance our standards for judging the classic fear of 
17:506:40815:21:21:89:517:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:“omitted-variable bias”.  Tests of influences, econometric or otherwise, usually draw the 
17:507:40905:21:20:89:515:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:automatic agnostic response that perhaps some other omitted variables have acted as the 
17:508:40993:20:21:89:493:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:true hidden causes of movements in the dependent variable.  The fingerprint testing 
17:509:41077:21:21:89:499:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:introduced here serves to raise the price of agnosticism.  Anyone choosing to reserve 
17:510:41163:21:21:89:506:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:doubts should explain not only what omitted variables they have in mind but also how 
17:511:41248:21:20:89:521:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:these can match the extra fingerprint patterns.  The more fingerprint tests we can add, the 
17:512:41340:20:21:89:284:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:fewer the number of possible suspects.   
17:513:41381:21:21:125:513:191:144:Times:144:Times:C: Three main types of fingerprints that would be left at the scene by any influence 
17:514:41463:21:20:89:479:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:on comparative education outputs are presented as column headings in Table 1.   
17:515:41543:20:21:89:161:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:  
17:516:41545:21:21:89:178:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:A. Market Rates 
17:517:41560:21:20:126:501:108:144:Times:144:Times:C: Child wages. The opportunity cost of school children’s foregone earnings has 
17:518:41637:20:36:90:496:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:dropped with economic development, a rough tendency that partly explains the long 
18:519:41719:36:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        17                                                                        
18:520:42013:0:20:90:486:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:delay in educational attainment.  We know that it dropped as nations became rich, 
18:521:42095:20:21:90:515:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:because the value of hired child labor became nearly zero by law.  Once a nation passed 
18:522:42183:21:21:90:515:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:laws making schooling mandatory, there was no employment opportunity during school 
18:523:42266:21:20:89:291:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:hours and therefore no opportunity cost.   
18:524:42309:20:21:125:511:626:144:Times:144:Times:C: The importance of that change depends on how much children could earn in the 
18:525:42386:21:21:89:525:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:more rural and impoverished settings where they were free to drop out of primary school.  
18:526:42476:21:20:89:521:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:The correct answer seems to be that their opportunity costs loomed large as a share of the 
18:527:42567:20:21:89:482:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:total cost of going to school.  In most of David Mitch’s calculations for Victorian 
18:528:42651:21:21:89:499:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:England, the opportunity cost was four-fifths of the total cost of attending school.  In 
18:529:42740:21:21:89:520:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:Lewis Solmon’s calculations for the United States in 1880 and 1890, the lost wages were 
18:530:42828:21:20:89:487:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:about half the total cost of schooling in the countryside, and well above half in the 
18:531:42914:20:21:89:514:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:cities.20  Awaiting more quantitative data from other settings, we can only conclude that 
18:532:43004:21:21:90:506:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:the decline of child labor opportunities was an important part of the rise of schooling.  
18:533:43094:21:20:89:514:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:Still, as we shall see in rate-of-return calculations below, even with the higher estimates 
18:534:43186:20:21:90:515:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the opportunity cost of child labor, extra schooling brought high returns to all parties, 
18:535:43279:21:21:90:394:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:leaving us to explore why those returns were often passed up.   
18:536:43343:21:20:126:494:377:144:Times:144:Times:C: Direct School Costs, and the Relative Price of Teachers.  Did most of world 
18:537:43419:20:21:90:521:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:history deliver so little education because schooling of given quality was more costly and 
18:538:43510:21:21:90:479:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:less affordable for a typical family than it has become in today’s rich countries?  
18:539:43594:21:20:90:519:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:Unencumbered by data, our intuition could run in either direction. Perhaps teachers were 
18:540:43683:20:21:90:503:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:an expensive elite in less developed times and regions, and have become cheaper.  Or 
18:541:43768:21:21:90:513:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:perhaps the opposite, if the quality of schooling declined and/or teachers became scarce 
18:542:43857:21:21:89:522:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:with development.  We are still far from a global or even multi-national economic history 
18:543:43947:21:20:89:512:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:of school costs, and equally far from a global history of teacher pay, the key input price 
18:544:44038:20:21:89:499:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:in this sector.  Nor is it easy to relate relative teacher wage rates to relative unit costs 
18:545:44131:21:21:89:310:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:unless or until one can hold quality constant.  
18:546:44179:21:20:126:510:170:144:Times:144:Times:C: A straightforward answer requires measurement of the average cost of a pupil’s 
18:547:44258:20:21:89:493:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:week or month in school, relative to a standard income.  Such data, in a form that is 
18:548:44344:21:21:89:523:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:comparable across countries or decades, are hard to find for any time before the 1980s.  It 
18:549:44436:21:20:89:506:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:is hard to correct any time series on school costs or fees for the upward drift in quality 
18:550:44527:20:36:89:522:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:caused by lengthening of the school year, improvements in teacher quality and pedagogy, 
19:551:44615:36:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        18                                                                        
19:552:44909:0:20:90:521:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:and class size reduction. The problem seems soluble, especially with U.S. historical data, 
19:553:45000:20:21:90:490:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:but only after much careful handling.21  Since the 1980s, the international agencies 
19:554:45085:21:21:90:486:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:(OECD, UNESCO, World Bank) have made international comparisons. There are 
19:555:45159:21:20:90:509:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:noteworthy differences between countries in unit costs, relative teacher pay, class size, 
19:556:45249:20:21:90:501:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:and test scores. Daily school costs per child seem to rise over the course of economic 
19:557:45336:21:21:90:522:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:development. The most likely reason, however, is a rise in school quality and not a rise in 
19:558:45428:21:20:90:515:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:the price of a given quality of schooling. Curriculum achievement test scores are clearly 
19:559:45518:20:21:90:509:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher in the richest countries than among test-taking students in developing countries, 
19:560:45607:21:21:90:520:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggesting an upward drift in the quality of delivery.22 Yet despite this rise in quality, the 
19:561:45702:21:21:90:521:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:direct cost of schooling of given quality, relative to general wage rates, has no clear trend 
19:562:45796:21:20:89:246:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:over the course of development. 
19:563:45828:20:21:126:503:481:144:Times:144:Times:C: A Broad Hint from the History of Wage Premiums.  Measuring the percentage 
19:564:45902:21:21:90:513:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:gain in adult pay that comes with extra education can help us reach an early decision on 
19:565:45991:21:20:90:512:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:the top-row suspect, namely a low market demand for skilled labor in the less-schooled 
19:566:46078:20:21:90:510:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:settings.  As noted, many might suspect that there has been less schooling for centuries 
19:567:46167:21:21:90:520:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:because less developed settings had less demand for skilled labor.  Perhaps these settings 
19:568:46258:21:20:90:503:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:lacked skilled-intensive technology or had low tastes for skill-intensive goods before, 
19:569:46346:20:21:90:491:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:say, the Industrial Revolution or the arrival of direct foreign investment from more 
19:570:46431:21:21:90:519:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:advanced countries.  The lower past demand should have manifested itself in the form of 
19:571:46519:21:20:90:511:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:a lower skilled-wage premium, as predicted in Table 1.  One might have gathered from 
19:572:46604:20:21:90:523:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:the widening of wage gaps in North America and Britain since the 1970s that wages were 
19:573:46691:21:21:90:510:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:more equal earlier, supporting the belief that demand for skills were relatively lower in 
19:574:46781:21:21:90:139:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:the past.   
19:575:46793:21:20:126:513:232:144:Times:144:Times:C: Yet the growing eclectic sets of data on wage structure cast serious doubt on the 
19:576:46875:20:21:89:496:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:notion that skills were less rewarded in less developed settings. Recent international 
19:577:46962:21:21:89:497:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:comparisons give a clear result: Less developed settings generally have higher wage 
19:578:47046:21:20:90:478:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:premiums for higher-skill occupations, and there is no trend toward higher wage 
19:579:47126:20:21:90:487:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:premiums, except in countries in transition from communism.  For example, Latin 
19:580:47206:21:21:90:517:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:American skilled-wage ratios remain above those of the US, especially in low-education 
19:581:47293:21:20:90:524:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:Brazil, Guatemala, and Nicaragua.  The low-skill-demand argument seems to be wrong in 
19:582:47379:20:36:90:393:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:predicting lower wage premiums in less developed settings.23   
20:583:47442:36:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        19                                                                        
20:584:47736:0:20:126:509:708:144:Times:144:Times:C: The available fragmentary evidence on movements over history seems to agree 
20:585:47812:20:21:90:525:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:with the recent global cross-sections.  A first hint comes simply from following American 
20:586:47902:21:21:90:494:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:wage history starting from the early nineteenth century.  That history suggests wide 
20:587:47987:21:20:90:521:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:swings but no clear long run widening.24 Similarly for Britain, skill premiums showed no 
20:588:48076:20:21:90:509:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:clear net movement toward widening wage gaps anytime in the last seven centuries. In 
20:589:48161:21:21:90:486:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:the building sector, for example, the skill premiums dropped across the fourteenth 
20:590:48244:21:20:90:514:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:century, remained stable until the mid-nineteenth, and then dropped again.25  Jan Luiten 
20:591:48333:20:21:89:518:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:van Zanden has now extended our view of wage premiums in the building sector back to 
20:592:48418:21:21:89:519:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:medieval times in Western Europe, with parallel indications from some East Asian data.  
20:593:48506:21:21:89:495:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:He finds that wages compressed considerably from the middle ages to early modern 
20:594:48587:21:20:89:509:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:times, with no real reversal in recent centuries. 26  Similarly, the skilled wage premium 
20:595:48677:20:21:90:513:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:has declined in the building trades of India from the middle of the nineteenth century to 
20:596:48767:21:21:90:509:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:the end of the twentieth.27  While the skill premium in the building trades is not itself a 
20:597:48859:21:20:90:515:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:schooling wage premium, nor a technology premium in a newly emerging sector, career 
20:598:48943:20:21:90:399:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:choices would have linked the scarcities of skills across sectors. 
20:599:49010:21:21:126:486:398:144:Times:144:Times:C: Though the wage premium evidence is indirect, apparently earlier and less 
20:600:49084:21:20:90:492:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:developed settings gave relatively high rewards to the kinds of skills that schooling 
20:601:49170:20:21:89:521:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:helped to develop.  The same was probably true in the commercial sphere, where literacy 
20:602:49258:21:21:89:498:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:and counting have always been valued.  We should look to other suspects, instead of 
20:603:49342:21:20:89:470:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:positing that there was less demand for literacy or numeracy in earlier settings.

20:605:49424:21:21:89:367:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:B. Rates of Return, with Caveats and Global Patterns 
20:606:49476:21:21:126:505:253:144:Times:144:Times:C: Let us turn next to a direct examination of rates of return on education, both as 
20:607:49558:21:20:90:512:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:concepts and as empirical measures produced by a scholarly cottage industry in the late 
20:608:49646:20:21:90:462:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:twentieth century. The rates of return have typically been used as clues about 
20:609:49725:21:21:90:494:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:underinvestment or overinvestment in formal education.  Somebody (private and/or 
20:610:49806:21:20:90:507:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:public entities) has under-invested in the sense of lowering GDP if the rate of return is 
20:611:49896:20:21:89:501:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:too high, and over-invested if they have driven the rate of return to levels that are too 
20:612:49986:21:21:89:501:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:low.  The vast literature measuring postwar rates has revealed important patterns that 
20:613:50073:21:20:89:510:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:probably held throughout modern history.  Before viewing these patterns, however, we 
20:614:50158:20:36:89:381:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:must note some shortcomings of the conventional measures. 
21:615:50216:36:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        20                                                                        
21:616:50510:0:20:126:478:708:144:Times:144:Times:C: Caveats about Conventional Private and Social Rates.  We start with the 
21:617:50582:20:21:90:489:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:conventional private and social rates of return, before introducing this paper’s new 
21:618:50667:21:21:90:478:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:emphasis on the fiscal rate of return.  The present value of private benefits is the 
21:619:50752:21:20:90:462:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:discounted sum of the extra after-tax income gains from the extra education.  
21:620:50830:20:21:90:514:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:Correspondingly, on the cost side, the household incurs out-of-pocket private costs plus 
21:621:50919:21:25:90:510:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:the opportunity cost of what the child would have earned in not in school.  The internal 
21:622:51008:25:23:90:521:580:144:Times:144:Times:B:rate of private return is the rate of discount, rP, that equates the present values of benefits 
21:623:51104:23:21:90:146:557:144:Times:144:Times:B:and costs.   
21:624:51117:21:21:126:509:536:144:Times:144:Times:C: The familiar “social” benefits and costs of giving an individual more schooling 
21:625:51197:21:20:90:475:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:are discounted in a similar manner, except that the affected party consists of the 
21:626:51280:20:21:90:518:495:144:Times:144:Times:B:household and philanthropic and government sectors together. Again, the internal rate of 
21:627:51369:21:21:90:501:474:144:Times:144:Times:B:return is that value of the rate of discount that makes net present value equal to zero.  
21:628:51459:21:21:90:519:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:Externalities are ignored here, as they are in all past measurements of the “social” rate of 
21:629:51552:21:20:90:520:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:return.  I shall also set aside non-economic consumption benefits of education, to instill a 
21:630:51645:20:21:90:397:412:144:Times:144:Times:B:bias toward understating some conclusions to be drawn later.28  
21:631:51709:21:21:126:507:391:144:Times:144:Times:C: The rate of return estimates must be used with a great deal of caution. The first 
21:632:51791:21:20:89:501:370:144:Times:144:Times:B:problem is that the rates are based on a different counterfactual, a different “margin”, 
21:633:51880:20:21:90:512:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:than what most users of the measures would want.  We typically want the rate of return 
21:634:51967:21:21:90:518:329:144:Times:144:Times:B:measure to compare the gains and losses from somehow encouraging a marginal child to 
21:635:52052:21:20:90:506:308:144:Times:144:Times:B:complete the next step of education.  Yet the measure itself does not do that.  Rather it 
21:636:52142:20:21:90:512:288:144:Times:144:Times:B:gives us what might be called the “average marginal” rate of return on the difference in 
21:637:52231:21:21:90:511:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:education at two levels, such as high school graduates versus primary school finishers.  
21:638:52320:21:20:90:499:246:144:Times:144:Times:B:The implicit counterfactual is unintended and unattractive: What if we had somehow 
21:639:52403:20:21:90:510:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:blocked everybody from getting the high school diploma?  Furthermore, as a particular 
21:640:52489:21:21:90:484:205:144:Times:144:Times:B:level of education becomes more universally attained, e.g. with almost everybody 
21:641:52570:21:21:90:499:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:finishing primary school, the difference in the earnings of the two groups reflects the 
21:642:52658:21:20:90:522:163:144:Times:144:Times:B:increasingly atypically nature of those who don’t even finish primary school.  There is no 
21:643:52749:20:21:90:515:143:144:Times:144:Times:B:way to avoid the fact that the marginal returns and costs may not equal the average ones 
21:644:52838:21:21:90:518:122:144:Times:144:Times:B:already attained, and we must imagine just how fast the diminishing returns to education 
21:645:52927:21:49:90:501:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:might set in as it expands.  Such judgments must be reached on a case-by-case basis.  
22:646:53013:49:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        21                                                                        
22:647:53307:0:20:126:510:708:144:Times:144:Times:C: A second problem is that rates of return are typically over-estimated by making 
22:648:53387:20:21:89:524:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:the nearly universal assumption that people go to work and capture the extra earnings that 
22:649:53478:21:21:89:513:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:their education makes possible.  Yet adults, especially females, typically work less than 
22:650:53568:21:20:89:517:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:that level at which they would fully reap the rewards of their educational attainment.  At 
22:651:53659:20:21:89:496:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:the level of the individual, this point matters little, since one can simply assume that 
22:652:53748:21:21:89:519:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:every individual was free to choose between paid work and home time, so that education 
22:653:53835:21:20:89:523:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:has raised the marginal value of their time whether or not they work for pay.  However, if 
22:654:53926:20:21:89:525:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:we are interested in effects on the growth of GDP per capita, or in the effects of education 
22:655:54019:21:21:89:507:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:on government revenue, the incompleteness of labor force participation means that the 
22:656:54105:21:21:89:507:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:economic returns are overstated.  In what follows this likely effect of incomplete work 
22:657:54193:21:20:89:222:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:will be taken into account.  
22:658:54222:20:21:126:515:481:144:Times:144:Times:C: Two Useful Global Patterns, Despite Another Flaw. Despite these caveats, there 
22:659:54301:21:21:90:519:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:is a great deal of useful information in comparing rates of return across contexts.  Recent 
22:660:54393:21:20:90:507:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:studies have produced the useful rates of private and social return shown in Table 2.29  
22:661:54482:20:21:89:518:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:Note that Table 2 has three patterns. First, the rates of return are usually higher in poorer 
22:662:54576:21:21:89:495:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries, as one might expect from the greater severity of credit constraints in poor 
22:663:54663:21:20:89:506:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:settings. This suggests what the emerging economic history of wage structure has also 
22:664:54749:20:21:89:509:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggested:  The economic gains from education were probably even higher in that past 
22:665:54834:21:21:89:504:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:than they are today.  Second, the rate of return is usually higher at the earlier levels of 
22:666:54926:21:20:89:521:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:education.  The return on primary education exceeds the return on higher education, even 
22:667:55015:20:21:89:513:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:without measuring externalities, which should have been larger in primary schooling.30  
22:668:55103:21:21:90:473:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:Finally, the private rates of return look higher than the social rates because of a 
22:669:55187:21:21:90:525:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:questionable decision that the authors have consistently made in defining the private rate.  
22:670:55280:21:20:126:517:232:144:Times:144:Times:C: The first two tendencies offer valuable historical clues that probably extend back 
22:671:55363:20:21:90:509:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:for centuries, but the third is misleading. How could the private rate always exceed the 
22:672:55452:21:21:90:523:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:social rate, as shown in Table 2?  The key assumption relates to the role of government in 
22:673:55543:21:20:90:524:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:the private rate calculations.  Like most authors calculating private rates of return, George 
22:674:55637:20:21:90:510:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:Psacharopoulos and co-authors have deducted government subsidies to education from 
22:675:55720:21:21:90:485:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:the private cost side, but ignored the taxes paid on the private benefits side.  Their 
22:676:55807:21:20:89:486:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:decision to take a short cut was made explicit at least as early as 1981: “Of course 
22:677:55892:20:36:89:513:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:earnings [in the social-rate calculation] should be before tax, whereas in the private rate 
23:678:55984:36:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        22                                                                        
23:679:56278:0:20:90:498:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:of return calculation earnings should be after tax.  But contrary to popular belief, the 
23:680:56367:20:21:90:507:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:post- versus pre-tax treatment of earnings does not make a big difference in the rate of 
23:681:56456:21:21:90:502:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:return calculation.”31  The same short cut has been taken by most of the rate of return 
23:682:56544:21:20:90:513:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:literature, though the difference was quantified in an early study by W. Lee Hansen and 
23:683:56632:20:21:90:472:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:also discussed by Gary Becker.32 Some authors have omitted all taxes from the 
23:684:56710:21:21:90:497:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:calculation of private returns, while others only missed indirect taxes, some kinds of 
23:685:56797:21:20:90:499:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:wealth tax, and the losses of social program benefits that accompany extra earnings.  
23:686:56883:20:21:90:519:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:Early authors (e.g. Hansen, Becker) were in this less-biased category, rightly introducing 
23:687:56974:21:21:90:339:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:income tax rates but missing other taxes altogether. 
23:688:57027:21:21:126:512:522:144:Times:144:Times:C: The whole international comparative literature, however, took a step backwards 
23:689:57106:21:20:90:517:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:after 1964 by failing to deduct any taxes at all from private returns. Only in 2005 did the 
23:690:57198:20:21:90:495:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:OECD re-introduce income taxation and explicitly consider the fiscal rate of return, 
23:691:57283:21:21:90:444:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:though they still failed to deduct indirect taxes from the extra earnings.33  
23:692:57361:21:20:126:516:439:144:Times:144:Times:C: Overstating the private returns by the amount of direct and indirect taxes paid on 
23:693:57444:20:21:90:499:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:extra income misdirects our suspicions.  Viewing the persistent gap in private versus 
23:694:57530:21:21:90:519:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:social rates of return, one might ask “Why do private individuals constantly under-invest 
23:695:57620:21:20:90:486:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:more in education than does society as a whole?”  That puzzle would be lessened, 
23:696:57701:20:21:90:510:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:however, if the calculations took account of direct and indirect taxes, thus lowering the 
23:697:57791:21:21:90:521:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:private rates of return.  The numbers need to be worked out, since governments take their 
23:698:57881:21:20:90:520:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:bite from every year of a long work career.  (The social rates, however, are free from this 
23:699:57973:20:21:90:137:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:tax bias.) 
23:700:57984:21:21:126:509:274:144:Times:144:Times:C: The Fiscal Rate of Return.  Correctly handling taxes invites a calculation of the 
23:701:58066:21:21:90:503:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:fiscal rate of return on extra education attainment and quality.  Such a calculation can 
23:702:58155:21:20:89:522:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:reveal whether governments have actually passed up large bills on the sidewalk, i.e. large 
23:703:58246:20:21:89:516:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:later tax revenues, by refusing to pay smaller amounts to subsidize mass schooling.  The 
23:704:58335:21:21:89:507:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:fiscal rate of return is the internal rate that equates the revenue gains and the costs that 
23:705:58428:21:20:89:310:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:extra education brings to government itself.34 
23:706:58474:20:21:126:493:150:144:Times:144:Times:C:  In what follows, we will find two historical cases in which the fiscal rate of 
23:707:58554:21:21:90:517:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:return on education was quite high, like many of those private and social rates of return.  
23:708:58646:21:20:90:512:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:Yet the fiscal measure has some extra strength as a clue revealing past underinvestment 
23:709:58734:20:36:90:523:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:in education.  It is harder to ignore a high fiscal rate of return, because is a traditional risk 
24:710:58832:36:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        23                                                                        
24:711:59126:0:20:90:513:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:argument is much less applicable on the government side.  Traditionally, we look at the 
24:712:59214:20:21:89:520:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:high rates of return foregone on private investments and excuse them on the grounds that 
24:713:59303:21:21:89:512:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:such investments are very risky, warranting a rate well above the interest rates at which 
24:714:59393:21:20:89:521:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:risk-averse private businesses and households might borrow.  The traditional argument is 
24:715:59482:20:21:89:521:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:certainly valid for private education loans, which repay private lenders only over a whole 
24:716:59573:21:21:90:487:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:generation.  Yet for a provincial or national government, it seems unlikely that the 
24:717:59658:21:20:90:490:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:aggregate future tax returns from investing with subsidies in mass education are so 
24:718:59742:20:21:90:501:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:uncertain. Indeed, the uncertainty of the aggregate tax base could even be reduced by 
24:719:59828:21:21:90:494:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:subsidizing broad-based education. Calculations for Victorian England and postwar 
24:720:59910:21:21:90:503:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:Venezuela will confirm that the governments could have earned higher rates of return 
24:721:59995:21:20:90:339:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:than the interest rates they paid on their own debt.   
24:722:60050:20:21:90:162:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:  
24:723:60052:21:21:90:296:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:C. The Relative-Public-Inputs Evidence 
24:724:60090:21:20:126:512:439:144:Times:144:Times:C: Next let us turn to Table 1’s pair of tax-support clues that allow us a direct view 
24:725:60174:20:21:90:499:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:of political and fiscal efforts in support of education.  The first clue is a support ratio 
24:726:60266:21:28:90:153:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:defined as35  
24:727:60280:28:0:126:312:370:144:Times:144:Times:C: Tax support ratio for primary pupils = 
24:728:60319:0:17:314:462:378:144:Times:144:Times:C:(subsidies/attending_student)
24:729:60348:17:0:351:425:361:144:Times:144:Times:C:(income/adult)
24:730:60362:0:31:464:467:370:144:Times:144:Times:C: 
24:731:60362:31:20:90:520:339:144:Times:144:Times:B:This ratio scales the generosity of the subsidy in terms of the population’s ability to pay.  
24:732:60456:20:21:90:519:319:144:Times:144:Times:B:Such a measure is already displayed in publications by the OECD and UNESCO, as well 
24:733:60540:21:21:90:510:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:as in the scholarly literature.36 What is the norm for this ratio? If it is lower in setting B 
24:734:60634:21:20:89:522:277:144:Times:144:Times:B:than in higher-education A, is that a bad thing for B?  The answer will depend on whether 
24:735:60724:20:21:89:478:257:144:Times:144:Times:B:or not A has over-invested in subsidizing and delivering primary education.  The 
24:736:60805:21:21:89:523:236:144:Times:144:Times:B:empirical literature tends to approve of the levels of primary-education support in today’s 
24:737:60897:21:21:89:521:215:144:Times:144:Times:B:most-educated societies.  Granted, there is a hot debate over whether adding more money 
24:738:60985:21:20:89:519:194:144:Times:144:Times:B:would do any good in the public schools of the United States and other OECD countries, 
24:739:61072:20:21:89:499:174:144:Times:144:Times:B:with Eric Hanushek supplying an abundance of evidence for the null hypothesis, and 
24:740:61155:21:21:89:502:153:144:Times:144:Times:B:there is good reason to wonder whether the subsidies need to be restricted to publicly-
24:741:61242:21:20:89:500:132:144:Times:144:Times:B:supplied schooling.37  Yet nobody in these debates has mustered evidence in favor of 
24:742:61327:20:21:89:500:112:144:Times:144:Times:B:actually cutting primary school subsidies or in favor of cutting attendance toward the 
24:743:61414:21:39:89:513:91:144:Times:144:Times:B:lower levels of the past.  It seems safe, when comparing this ratio between two settings, 
25:744:61504:39:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        24                                                                        
25:745:61798:0:20:90:482:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:to presume that the more educated setting A has not yet reached the point of over-
25:746:61880:20:21:89:509:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:investing in primary education, especially since those rates of return continue to run so 
25:747:61970:21:21:90:215:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:high (again see Table 2).  
25:748:61997:21:20:126:500:646:144:Times:144:Times:C: A quick examination of Table 3’s postwar rates of public support for primary 
25:749:62074:20:21:90:513:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:schooling helps to bring this simple public-expenditure fingerprint into focus. Globally, 
25:750:62164:21:21:90:486:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:those countries whose children went to school less and got lower test scores (as in 
25:751:62248:21:20:89:514:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:Figures 4-6) tended to be countries that were less willing to spend taxes even in relation 
25:752:62339:20:21:90:483:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:to their average incomes (here in Table 3).  Some of them were poorer, of course, 
25:753:62421:21:21:90:505:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:allowing them the excuse that they simply could not afford to spend as high a share of 
25:754:62508:21:21:90:519:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:their income on public education.  Yet this Wagner’s Law variant on the poverty defense 
25:755:62596:21:20:90:520:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:falls short in the cases in which richer countries chose to spend less on public schooling.  
25:756:62689:20:21:90:495:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:We will find that most of history’s anomalies were such cases, with richer countries 
25:757:62774:21:21:90:501:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:achieving less education largely because they spent less of their incomes on taxes for 
25:758:62861:21:20:90:132:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:schools. 
25:759:62870:20:21:126:513:419:144:Times:144:Times:C: The second selected support measure also reveals much about education finance 
25:760:62948:21:28:89:499:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.  It is a double ratio, by level of education: 
25:761:63039:28:0:126:276:370:144:Times:144:Times:C: Primary/tertiary double ratio = 
25:762:63071:0:17:278:489:378:144:Times:144:Times:C:(subsidy/student)_in_primary_education
25:763:63109:17:0:280:487:361:144:Times:144:Times:C:(subsidy/student)_in_tertiary_education
25:764:63148:0:31:491:498:370:144:Times:144:Times:C:, 
25:765:63150:31:20:90:521:339:144:Times:144:Times:B:where tertiary refers to university education and other training beyond secondary school.  
25:766:63241:20:21:90:482:319:144:Times:144:Times:B:The lower this ratio in setting B relative to setting A, the more favor given by B’s 
25:767:63326:21:21:90:260:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:governments to higher education.   
25:768:63361:21:20:126:517:277:144:Times:144:Times:C: Again, the ratio cannot be used to judge education policies until we have a norm, 
25:769:63443:20:21:90:506:257:144:Times:144:Times:B:a “best” balance between subsidizing primary education and subsidizing tertiary.  One 
25:770:63529:21:21:90:497:236:144:Times:144:Times:B:guide is that the case for externalities from education spending has been stronger for 
25:771:63616:21:20:90:512:215:144:Times:144:Times:B:primary than for higher education.  It was primary education that Adam Smith, Thomas 
25:772:63701:20:21:90:506:195:144:Times:144:Times:B:Jefferson, and Milton Friedman considered most worthy of subsidy on the ground that 
25:773:63785:21:21:90:499:174:144:Times:144:Times:B:mass schooling created citizens and social order, and the econometric evidence cited 
25:774:63870:21:21:90:493:153:144:Times:144:Times:B:above also emphasized spillovers from primary and secondary education.  Granted, 
25:775:63951:21:20:90:505:132:144:Times:144:Times:B:institutions of higher learning in the United States and a few other advanced countries 
25:776:64039:20:21:90:519:112:144:Times:144:Times:B:generated great spillover benefits from their Research and Development.  Yet the returns 
25:777:64128:21:39:90:458:91:144:Times:144:Times:B:from the instructional part of higher education are arguably more private.38   
26:778:64207:39:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        25                                                                        
26:779:64501:0:20:126:517:708:144:Times:144:Times:C: By itself, the fact that externalities might be greater for lower levels of education 
26:780:64587:20:21:90:508:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:does not tell us the “best” balance of public subsidies.  Yet if we accept the notion that 
26:781:64678:21:21:89:496:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:the per-student externalities could reasonably be larger at the primary level, then the 
26:782:64766:21:20:89:485:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:“best” value of the primary/tertiary ratio should not be below one in any country.  
26:783:64850:20:21:89:510:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:Alternatively, in the OECD countries this ratio tends to be one-half (50%), as shown at 
26:784:64938:21:21:89:517:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:the top of Table 4.  To err on the side of acquitting too many governments of developing 
26:785:65027:21:20:89:378:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries, let us say that the efficiency norm is 50 percent.   
26:786:65091:20:21:126:513:564:144:Times:144:Times:C: Table 4 reveals that many developing countries spend less than half as much tax 
26:787:65171:21:21:90:499:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:money on each primary student as on each student in higher education, causing us to 
26:788:65255:21:21:89:514:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:wonder how the case for subsidizing those at the top could be stronger in countries with 
26:789:65344:21:20:90:524:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:more illiterates and less research-agglomeration efficiencies of the sort experienced in the 
26:790:65437:20:21:90:519:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:world’s top research centers.  Recent literature has supported these suspicions by finding 
26:791:65528:21:21:89:511:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:that inequality in educational attainment, a result fostered by favoring higher education 
26:792:65618:21:20:89:499:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:subsidies, has had a negative effect on economic growth since 1960.39  Note that this 
26:793:65704:20:21:90:498:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:primary-versus-tertiary fingerprint offers telling evidence even without an education 
26:794:65790:21:21:90:514:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:output anomaly. Countries with relative primary support ratios well below 50 percent in 
26:795:65878:21:20:90:501:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:Table 4 cannot use their poverty as an excuse, since the same education budget could 
26:796:65963:20:21:90:516:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:have been more productively reallocated from tertiary to primary education.  Such cases 
26:797:66051:21:21:90:517:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggest a policy failure regardless of the nation’s income per capita.40  Table 4 hints that 
26:798:66144:21:20:90:485:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:a counterproductive bias in favor of over-subsidizing higher education, and under-
26:799:66226:20:21:90:499:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:subsidizing primary education, is endemic in Latin American, the Caribbean, Africa, 
26:800:66310:21:21:90:496:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:South Asia, and Southeast Asia.  We return to this point in discussing postwar Latin

26:807:66479:13:21:126:512:143:144:Times:144:Times:C: A strong illustration of the applicability of this paper’s clues in earlier history is 
26:808:66566:21:21:90:510:122:144:Times:144:Times:B:provided by English experience between the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the Fees 
26:809:66650:21:20:90:475:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:Act that finally funded universal primary education in 1891.  Here is a case that 
26:810:66732:20:29:90:511:81:144:Times:144:Times:B:particularly points toward insufficient government support, the suspect at the bottom of 
27:811:66821:29:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        26                                                                        
27:812:67115:0:20:90:515:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:Table 1. By 1688, England was a great power with a secure government and a famously 
27:813:67199:20:21:90:508:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:secure revenue base.41  Yet England and the United Kingdom delivered relatively little 
27:814:67286:21:21:89:492:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:tax support for primary schools.  Both England-Wales and the Kingdom as a whole 
27:815:67366:21:20:89:502:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:lagged behind France and the United States (along with Prussia) until the Fees Act of 
27:816:67452:20:21:89:496:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:1891, despite having a higher income per capita.  So testify both the primary-school 
27:817:67537:21:21:89:504:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:support ratios (public or total expenditures per pupil, divided by GDP per capita), and 
27:818:67625:21:20:90:493:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:also the teacher/pupil ratios.42  Elsewhere I have conjectured that centralization and 
27:819:67712:20:21:90:496:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:restriction of the franchise played important roles in holding Britain behind until the 
27:820:67800:21:21:90:497:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:franchise was extended down the social ranks and the demand for schooling became 
27:821:67881:21:21:90:176:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:overpowering.43   
27:822:67899:21:20:126:522:501:144:Times:144:Times:C: Confirming evidence comes through the availability of micro-studies of education 
27:823:67980:20:21:90:483:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:in Victorian England, studies that now make it possible to quantify the returns on 
27:824:68063:21:21:90:504:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:primary-school investments in England.  David Mitch’s work allows us to convert his 
27:825:68147:21:20:90:497:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:extensive data on occupational rewards and school costs into rates of return on three 
27:826:68233:20:21:90:524:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:years’ schooling in the 1820s leading to literacy in adulthood, and Jason Long’s matching 
27:827:68323:21:21:90:514:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:of children in the 1851 census with adults in 1881 provides a similar view of the returns 
27:828:68413:21:20:90:495:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:to completing primary school around mid-century. Table 5 presents estimates of the 
27:829:68496:20:21:90:498:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:returns that are conservative in that they are likely to understate some of the gains or 
27:830:68585:21:21:90:516:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:overestimate some of the costs.44  Even with this tilt toward underestimation, the returns 
27:831:68676:21:20:90:523:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:are high enough to make some suggestions.  The private and social returns are up close to 
27:832:68766:20:21:89:513:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:those reported for the 1970s-1990s in Table 2 above, even though the Victorian English 
27:833:68853:21:21:89:517:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:population had noticeably shorter careers.  One implication of this is that the direct costs 
27:834:68946:21:21:89:508:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:and opportunity costs of schooling did not loom large enough to choke off the case for 
27:835:69033:21:20:89:502:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:investing in formal primary education.  Yes, there was sufficient demand for literacy, 
27:836:69120:20:21:89:520:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:despite the likelihood that the demand for child labor held back the progress of schooling 
27:837:69211:21:21:89:292:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the industrial North for a few decades.  
27:838:69255:21:20:125:511:170:144:Times:144:Times:C: The main innovation in Table 5, however, is the fiscal rate of return.  Even with 
27:839:69337:20:21:89:520:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates that are probably too pessimistic, it was well above the rate of interest at which 
27:840:69430:21:21:89:506:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:Parliament could borrow.  The issue returns:  Why did Parliament decline to subsidize 
27:841:69516:21:20:89:498:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:mass schooling if it would repay Her Majesty’s government itself? Indeed, the fiscal 
27:842:69601:20:36:89:519:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:indictment stands even when we re-introduce the fact that a grown-up child’s labor force 
28:843:69690:36:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        27                                                                        
28:844:69984:0:20:90:506:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:participation would have been only partial, especially for females.  Table 5’s Row (h.) 
28:845:70072:20:21:90:518:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:reports the same rates of return as for 1840, but with the adult earnings increments cut in 
28:846:70164:21:21:89:512:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:half.  This lowers the rates of economic return on schooling, though not by half the rate 
28:847:70254:21:20:89:516:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:itself.  The result is still a double-digit rate of return -- either private or social or fiscal -- 
28:848:70354:20:21:89:526:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:well above the 4.4 percent rate at which Her Majesty’s government could have borrowed.  
28:849:70442:21:21:89:503:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:The government appears to have left money on the sidewalk by not investing more in 
28:850:70525:21:20:89:510:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:primary education before the Elementary Education Act of 1870 and the more decisive 
28:851:70609:20:21:89:177:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:Fees Act of 1891. 
28:852:70627:21:21:125:509:543:144:Times:144:Times:C: The failure may have extended back to the start of the Hanoverian dynasty.  As 
28:853:70706:21:21:89:496:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:far as we know, the returns and costs of primary education in the eighteenth century 
28:854:70791:21:20:89:502:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:should have yielded rates of return at least as high as those in Table 5, given what we 
28:855:70879:20:21:89:483:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:know about tax rates, interest rates, and the wage structure.  The tax rates paid by 
28:856:70964:21:21:89:513:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:laborers were thought by Joseph Massie to be 8 percent, similar to the Victorian rates.45 
28:857:71053:21:20:90:516:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:Government could also borrow cheaply: The consol rate was below five percent as early 
28:858:71139:20:21:90:503:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:as 1717, the fourth Hanoverian year.  So as early as 1717, the government could have 
28:859:71224:21:21:90:523:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:reaped a significant fiscal return by investing in universal primary education.  Finally, the 
28:860:71318:21:20:90:500:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:wage structure did not reward education any less in the eighteenth century than later, 
28:861:71405:20:21:90:501:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:given the indirect evidence cited when introducing the skilled/unskilled wage ratio in 
28:862:71492:21:21:90:524:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:Table 1 above.  Thus given the history of tax rates, interest rates, and wage rates, the rates 
28:863:71587:21:20:90:514:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:of return back to about 1717 should have been as high as those Victorian rates shown in 
28:864:71675:20:21:90:513:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:Table 5.  It is fair to ask why Parliament in 1717 could not have enacted something like 
28:865:71764:21:21:90:512:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:the Education Act of 1870, followed 21 years later, in 1738, by an analogue to the Fees 
28:866:71852:21:21:90:497:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:Act of 1891.  The usual explanation just re-poses the same question:  Yes, education 
28:867:71937:21:20:90:514:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:subsidies were blocked partly by conflicts over the link between education and religion, 
28:868:72026:20:21:90:488:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:but these were later resolved in favor of free public schooling.  Regardless of what 
28:869:72111:21:21:90:491:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:explains the opposition to tax-based schooling, the point remains that the operative 
28:870:72196:21:20:90:502:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:constraint that held up the advance of schooling lay in the collective unwillingness to 
28:871:72284:20:21:89:155:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:supply taxes. 
28:872:72298:21:21:125:507:129:144:Times:144:Times:C: We cannot extend the same simple indictment back before the late seventeenth 
28:873:72375:21:20:89:518:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:century, however.  The consol rate was well above five percent under the Stuarts and the 
28:874:72464:20:36:89:510:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:House of Orange, largely because the throne could (and did) default on its debts before 
29:875:72552:36:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        28                                                                        
29:876:72846:0:20:90:505:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:1688.46   Britain and other emerging states were still not secure enough to take a more 
29:877:72934:20:21:89:496:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:modern long-run view of the economics of education subsidies.  And before the late 
29:878:73017:21:21:89:489:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:fifteenth century, regimes were not only insecure but also more rural than the Tory 
29:879:73101:21:20:89:482:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:opponents of education in the nineteenth century, and thus had a self-interest that 
29:880:73185:20:21:89:519:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:opposed paying taxes to educate peasants to flee or revolt.  Yet from the early eighteenth 
29:881:73276:21:21:89:477:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:century on, the necessary elements were all in place -- other than political will.   
29:882:73361:21:20:125:502:584:144:Times:144:Times:C: Thus for the Victorian period at least, and probably for the whole period from 
29:883:73440:20:21:89:516:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:1717 to 1891, England-Wales and the United Kingdom underperformed in the sphere of 
29:884:73523:21:21:89:523:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:education relative to the United States and France.  The culprits can be summarized using 
29:885:73613:21:21:89:517:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:the line-up of suspects in Table 1.  Drawing on data for the Anglo-American anomaly of 
29:886:73700:21:20:89:488:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:1850-1890, the guiltiest suspect appears to have been deficient British (or superior 
29:887:73785:20:21:89:504:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:American) political will to pay taxes for primary schools, to judge from those support 
29:888:73872:21:21:89:510:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:ratios and from Britain’s lower teacher/pupil ratios.  Accomplices may have included a 
29:889:73959:21:20:89:515:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:high relative wage for child labor in Britain and the higher cost of Britain’s (more male) 
29:890:74050:20:21:89:500:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:teachers relative to the (more female) primary-school teachers of North America and 
29:891:74134:21:21:89:519:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:Australasia.47  Other suspects are acquitted:  Relative to the United States, rich Victorian 
29:892:74227:21:20:90:514:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:Britain did not suffer from lower market demand for skills, or higher fertility, or shorter 
29:893:74319:20:21:90:319:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:adult life expectancy, or weaker philanthropy.

29:896:74409:20:21:126:495:295:144:Times:144:Times:C: The lag in Latin American schooling behind that of North America has been 
29:897:74483:21:21:89:496:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:summarized and tentatively explained in a series of writings by the research team of 
29:898:74568:21:21:89:514:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:Stanley Engerman, Elisa Mariscal, and Kenneth Sokoloff (EMS).  Reaching back to the 
29:899:74652:21:20:89:483:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:colonial era for root causes, they argue that low and unequal education, like other 
29:900:74736:20:21:89:505:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:symptoms of Latin American inequality in the nineteenth century and early twentieth, 
29:901:74821:21:21:89:499:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:stemmed from inequality in political power and landownership.   They conclude that

29:903:74904:20:21:126:499:150:144:Times:144:Times:C:“although investment in schooling is strongly and positively correlated with per

30:910:75554:21:20:90:496:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:To this Ewout Frankema has now added an important extension of the data on Latin 
30:911:75635:20:21:90:508:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:American education since 1870, emphasizing the inequality of education more than its 
30:912:75720:21:21:90:173:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:average level.49   
30:913:75739:21:20:126:507:584:144:Times:144:Times:C: This section follows their lead, both in focusing on anomalous departures from 
30:914:75818:20:21:90:511:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:the income-education correlation and in emphasizing the distribution of political voice. 
30:915:75907:21:21:90:515:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:I offer new twists in the geography and historical timing of the Latin lags, especially for 
30:916:75999:21:21:90:478:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, and fresh evidence on the political 
30:917:76083:21:20:90:512:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:economy of government failure to subsidize.  My tentative conclusions, to be presented 
30:918:76170:20:21:90:165:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:elsewhere, are: 
30:919:76186:21:21:90:93:460:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
30:920:76186:21:20:126:508:439:144:Times:144:Times:C: (1) If one compares Latin America with the rich industrialized countries, as the 
30:921:76267:20:21:90:522:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:EMS team has done, the data neatly fit both their concern and their explanation.  Relative 
30:922:76358:21:21:90:494:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:to the richer countries, Latin American education has always been low and unequal. 
30:923:76441:21:20:126:513:377:144:Times:144:Times:C: (2) While I think their explanation is the correct one, we must acknowledge that 
30:924:76522:20:21:90:507:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:their North-South contrast fits too many hypotheses.  In the language of this paper, the 
30:925:76611:21:21:90:499:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:fact that Latin America has always been poorer allows critics to resist our hunch that 
30:926:76698:21:20:90:501:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:unequal voice is the key.  Their lower education attainments do not pose an anomaly. 
30:927:76783:20:21:126:496:295:144:Times:144:Times:C: (3) The search for anomalies yields more fruit, by revealing cases in which a 
30:928:76861:21:21:90:500:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:Latin American country has less education, and more unequal education, than poorer 
30:929:76944:21:21:90:520:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries.  There are several such Latin American anomalies. The most dramatic one is a 
30:930:77032:21:20:90:518:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:case that has been relatively ignored: Venezuela.50  This section focuses on that case and 
30:931:77123:20:21:90:512:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:finds strong support for indicting a political environment that refused to subsidize mass 
30:932:77213:21:21:90:149:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:schooling.   
30:933:77226:21:20:90:93:170:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
30:934:77226:20:21:126:517:150:144:Times:144:Times:C: The global positioning of Latin American education achievements can be judged 
30:935:77304:21:21:90:497:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:by a renewed look at Figures 2-6 above. The region as a whole indeed had far lower 
30:936:77387:21:20:90:520:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:education than Canada, the United States, or Northwest Europe between 1900 and 2006.  
30:937:77473:20:36:90:497:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:Relative to countries with similar income per capita, its lag was less dramatic, as the 
31:938:77561:36:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        30                                                                        
31:939:77855:0:20:90:508:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:figures suggest.51  Latin America’s disadvantage might be reinforced a bit if one could 
31:940:77943:20:21:90:502:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:adjust the enrollments data for a bias now identified by Frankema. Not only are Latin 
31:941:78029:21:21:90:505:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:American enrollments a bit lower, for a given income per capita, but these enrollment 
31:942:78115:21:20:90:517:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:rates also consist of a higher share of grade-repeaters dropouts, and a lower share of true 
31:943:78207:20:21:90:493:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:primary-school completers, than on other continents. He thus finds that the postwar 
31:944:78291:21:21:90:487:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:catching-up in Latin American enrollments may hide a loss in educational quality, 
31:945:78373:21:20:90:235:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:relative to other continents.52  
31:946:78406:20:21:126:505:564:144:Times:144:Times:C: If Figures 2-6 show that Latin America as a whole has not distinctly lagged all 
31:947:78486:21:21:90:517:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:other continents in education attainment, they nonetheless also show some incriminating 
31:948:78574:21:21:90:498:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:anomalies.  The new clues cast a different light on the Southern cone countries.  The 
31:949:78660:21:20:90:523:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:Engerman-Mariscal-Sokoloff team described Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay as education 
31:950:78745:20:21:90:525:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:leaders in the Latin American context.  While that is broadly correct, these three countries 
31:951:78838:21:21:90:496:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:provided less schooling than several poorer countries outside South America.  As of 
31:952:78922:21:20:90:510:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:1900-1930, enrollment rates in Argentina and Uruguay trailed behind those of both the 
31:953:79008:20:21:90:489:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:mother countries (Spain and Italy), and trailed behind those of much poorer Japan, 
31:954:79091:21:21:90:510:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:Greece, and (in 1930) Romania.  In terms of test scores, Argentina’s first entry into the 
31:955:79181:21:20:90:506:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:PISA exams, in 2006, yielded lower sample-average scores than those achieved by 15-
31:956:79264:20:21:90:483:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:year-old students in Turkey and Mexico.  Thus the position of the Southern Cone 
31:957:79344:21:21:90:518:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries in education history depends on what other countries we compare them to.  On 
31:958:79431:21:20:90:500:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:the global level, they have tended to be slight under-achievers relative to countries in 
31:959:79520:20:21:90:278:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:other regions with the same incomes.   
31:960:79559:21:21:126:511:274:144:Times:144:Times:C: The most noteworthy anomaly, however, relates to Venezuela, a country whose 
31:961:79635:21:21:90:496:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:education history has been seriously under-studied (at least, in the English-language 
31:962:79721:21:20:89:496:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:literature).  Throughout the twentieth century Venezuela has been a clear Country-B 
31:963:79804:20:21:89:500:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:“failure” case, a rich country with strangely low education.  Despite its oil prosperity 
31:964:79893:21:21:89:497:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:after World War I, Venezuela’s school enrollment rates in 1930 were no higher than 
31:965:79976:21:20:89:515:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:those of much poorer Turkey, and also below those of Mediterranean Europe, as well as 
31:966:80062:20:21:89:495:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:such distant poor countries as Japan, Romania, and even Siam (Figure 3).  Closer to 
31:967:80146:21:21:89:503:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:home, Venezuelan children have been consistently less schooled than those in at least 
31:968:80232:21:20:89:516:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:five poorer neighbors: Colombia, Costa Rica, Guyana, Trinidad-Tobago, and Mexico.53  
31:969:80317:20:36:90:494:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:Even as late as 2006, after decades of oil wealth and after a few years of enrollment 
32:970:80403:36:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        31                                                                        
32:971:80697:0:20:90:516:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:increases under Hugo Chavez, Venezuela’s sixth-graders got the second-lowest national 
32:972:80783:20:21:90:444:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:average sample score in math and reading out of 16 countries (Figure 6).  
32:973:80857:21:21:126:521:667:144:Times:144:Times:C: Why these anomalies? Why did some many Latin American countries each enroll 
32:974:80933:21:20:90:519:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:and teach a lower share of their children than poorer countries?  Some initial suggestions 
32:975:81024:20:21:90:401:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:can be offered here, ones that will be expanded in later writings. 
32:976:81091:21:21:126:518:605:144:Times:144:Times:C: For all of Latin America, as for Industrial-Revolution Britain, we can reject some 
32:977:81174:21:20:90:521:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:natural suspicions.  It seems untrue that the relative demand for higher-skilled and higher-
32:978:81266:20:21:90:506:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:educated labor was weaker in Latin America.  On the contrary, skill premia seemed as 
32:979:81351:21:21:90:524:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:high there as on any other continent.54  Nor was the use of child labor any greater in Latin 
32:980:81444:21:21:90:468:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:America than in South Asia or Africa or the Middle East.  There has also little 
32:981:81524:21:20:90:523:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:discrimination against female enrollments for at least a century of Latin American history 
32:982:81615:20:21:90:508:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:-- certainly not as much as in Mediterranean Europe, the Middle East, Africa, or South 
32:983:81702:21:21:90:132:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:Asia.55   
32:984:81712:21:20:126:493:439:144:Times:144:Times:C: For Latin America as a whole, as for Industrial Revolution Britain, the main 
32:985:81789:20:21:90:499:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:culprit has been a political bias against subsidizing mass schooling.  To the evidence 
32:986:81876:21:21:90:514:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:already presented by EMS and by Frankema, this section can add two new international 
32:987:81961:21:20:90:520:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:clues, one for the start of the twentieth century and another for the later twentieth and the 
32:988:82055:20:21:90:505:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:early twenty-first.  The start-of-century clue appears in the form of a pair of diagrams, 
32:989:82145:21:21:89:507:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:Figures 8 and 9, comparing expenditures across countries around the year 1900.  Back 
32:990:82230:21:20:89:513:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:then, says Figure 8, Latin America spent about as much per child of school age as other 
32:991:82318:20:21:89:519:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:regions at the same income levels.  The behavior of the data-supplying countries clusters 
32:992:82408:21:21:90:509:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:along the same familiar line relating expenditures to income.  In this respect, there was 
32:993:82498:21:21:90:493:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:nothing different about Latin American school finance, given the levels of income.  
32:994:82582:21:20:90:486:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:Figure 9, however, reveals a consistent difference using some of the same data.  It 
32:995:82666:20:21:90:520:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:decomposes Figure 8’s expenditures per child of school age into (expenditures per pupil) 
32:996:82755:21:21:90:520:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:times (pupils per child of school age, alias the enrollment rate).  The two components are 
32:997:82846:21:20:90:520:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:graphed against each other, separately for Latin American and the rest of the world.  One 
32:998:82936:20:21:90:504:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:would expect the two to rise together as we move from poorer to richer countries, and 
32:999:83022:21:21:90:509:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:they do so in Figure 9.  Yet the relationship between these two components is different 
32:1000:83110:21:20:90:481:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:for Latin America:  Moving toward the richer and higher-spending countries like 
32:1001:83190:20:36:90:501:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:Argentina yields much less gain in enrollments per dollar of expenditure per enrolled 
33:1002:83276:36:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        32                                                                        
33:1003:83570:0:20:90:519:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:pupil, than the same movement (toward the US and New Zealand behavior) in the rest of 
33:1004:83656:20:21:89:514:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:the world.  Given the same resources, Latin American governments somehow delivered 
33:1005:83739:21:21:90:517:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:more inputs per pupil to a smaller fraction of the school-age population.  This appears to 
33:1006:83830:21:20:89:460:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:be the same sort of elitism in deciding what schooling to supply, and in what 
33:1007:83908:20:21:89:399:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:neighborhoods, as was emphasized by EMS and by Frankema.   
33:1008:83967:21:21:126:508:605:144:Times:144:Times:C: A century later the same elitism seems evident in much of Latin America, even 
33:1009:84045:21:20:89:487:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:though the locus of power has shifted.  A key choice variable in today’s education 
33:1010:84128:20:21:89:515:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:structures is the allocation of public funds between using the same tax money for higher 
33:1011:84217:21:21:89:509:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:education or using it for primary (and secondary) education.  We saw in Table 4 above 
33:1012:84303:21:21:89:520:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:that countries differ greatly in their choices here.  Among the data-supplying countries of 
33:1013:84395:21:20:89:484:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:Latin America, Table 4 suggests that primary education seems to have been short-
33:1014:84475:20:21:89:497:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:changed relative to higher education in Argentina before the return of democracy, in 
33:1015:84560:21:21:89:501:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:Brazil, in Chile before the concertación began in 1990, and in Colombia, Costa Rica, 
33:1016:84645:21:20:89:514:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:Jamaica, Mexico, and Venezuela (but not in Cuba).  Given that the social rates of return 
33:1017:84734:20:21:89:500:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:run higher for the earlier stages of education in these same countries, their tilt toward 
33:1018:84824:21:21:89:524:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher education appears to have lowered GDP.  This testimony from Table 4 agrees with 
33:1019:84911:21:20:89:522:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:several past studies about Latin America as well as about the Asian and African countries 
33:1020:85001:20:21:89:354:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:with low relative investments in primary education.56   
33:1021:85057:21:21:126:522:336:144:Times:144:Times:C: Since Venezuela’s low education performance offered the most glaring anomalies 
33:1022:85136:21:20:90:520:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:in Figures 2-6, its sources need to be identified.  Here, even more than in other countries, 
33:1023:85229:20:21:90:500:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:the culprit seems to have been a political bias against mass education.  That bias was 
33:1024:85316:21:21:90:501:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:spotlighted back in 1959, when Carl Shoup and his collaborators published their task-
33:1025:85401:21:21:90:353:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:force study of the whole fiscal structure of Venezuela: 
33:1026:85457:21:20:90:93:232:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
33:1027:85457:20:21:126:505:212:144:Times:144:Times:C:“Education has such a low priority in the national investment program that the 
33:1028:85536:21:21:126:505:191:144:Times:144:Times:C:level of education relative to income is one of the lowest in the world.  Further 
33:1029:85618:21:20:126:494:170:144:Times:144:Times:C:progress in the non-petroleum sectors, particularly industry, agriculture, and 
33:1030:85697:20:21:126:398:150:144:Times:144:Times:C:government, will depend heavily on better education.”57 
33:1031:85752:21:77:90:93:129:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
34:1032:85752:77:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        33                                                                        
34:1033:86046:0:20:90:521:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:So they judged at twentieth-century Venezuela’s first sustained switch from caudillo rule 
34:1034:86136:20:21:89:511:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:to democracy.  Yet, as we saw in Tables 3 and 4 and in Figures 5 and 6, Venezuela still 
34:1035:86224:21:21:89:493:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:has not caught up, despite three rounds of sudden enrichment from oil price hikes.   
34:1036:86309:21:20:125:508:646:144:Times:144:Times:C: So large were the windfalls passed up by Venezuela’s politicians that they may 
34:1037:86388:20:21:89:517:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:even, like Victorian Britain, have missed a high rate of return to government itself.  That 
34:1038:86480:21:21:89:482:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:is, the fiscal rate of return may have exceeded the opportunity cost of funds.  The 
34:1039:86564:21:20:89:524:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:Venezuelan data in Table 6 suggest that the under-investment may have reached even this 
34:1040:86652:20:21:89:503:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:extreme, to judge from data circa 1958.  The cost of public funds for investments like 
34:1041:86739:21:21:89:524:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:education was thought to be about 10 percent.  On the assumption that people worked full 
34:1042:86828:21:21:90:522:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:time after their education, not only the rest of society but also the government itself could 
34:1043:86922:21:20:90:525:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:have reaped a net gain from extra investment in any level of education (far right column).  
34:1044:87014:20:21:90:518:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:On the pessimistic assumption that people worked only half time, the same would not be 
34:1045:87101:21:21:90:494:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:true, so that the lost social gains did not translate into losses for government itself.   
34:1046:87192:21:20:126:511:439:144:Times:144:Times:C: Such evidence of bias does not emerge in all cases. As Table 6 shows, the same 
34:1047:87271:20:21:90:511:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:was not true of Mexico around 1963, suggesting that Mexico’s bias against subsidizing 
34:1048:87357:21:21:90:501:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:primary education was less strong.  Still, the fiscal rates of return in Table 6 were not 
34:1049:87447:21:20:90:518:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:negative, which underlines a more basic point:  Investing in education did raise revenues 
34:1050:87537:20:21:90:523:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:for government, contrary to the assumption commonly implied.  An open question is why 
34:1051:87623:21:21:90:502:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:they did not discuss such returns.  If they had somehow not thought of the point, why 
34:1052:87709:21:20:90:120:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:not?   
34:1053:87716:20:21:90:93:295:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
34:1054:87716:21:21:90:359:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:C. Different Fingerprints in Today’s Rich Countries 
34:1055:87767:21:21:126:533:253:144:Times:144:Times:C: The third illustrative application reveals a developmental shift in the seeming ability 
34:1056:87855:21:20:90:533:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:of different forces to explain differences in education outputs.  For historical settings before 
34:1057:87952:20:21:90:533:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:the late twentieth century, and continuing into the twenty-first for developing regions, it has 
34:1058:88048:21:21:90:536:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:been easy to identify insufficient tax support as a prime culprit in poor performances.  A key 
34:1059:88143:21:20:90:537:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:premise of this explanation is, of course, that spending more tax money would keep children 
34:1060:88235:20:21:90:530:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:in school longer and raise their test scores.  This premise is well supported for most history 
34:1061:88330:21:21:90:537:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:and for most of the world’s children today.  As we have seen in Figures 8 and 9, enrollments 
34:1062:88423:21:20:90:523:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:historically responded to raising tax support per pupil or per child of school age.  We also 
34:1063:88516:20:36:90:517:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:saw in Table 2 that raising the levels of education brought higher rates of return in lower 
35:1064:88608:36:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        34                                                                        
35:1065:88902:0:20:90:534:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:income countries, again pointing to insufficient supply of public funds as the main check on 
35:1066:88995:20:21:90:514:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:education.  For most of modern history, there should have been little doubt that “money 
35:1067:89083:21:21:90:442:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:matters”, both in raising the years of schooling and in raising cognition.   
35:1068:89160:21:20:126:541:646:144:Times:144:Times:C: In today’s rich countries, however, the money-matters premise is less strong, possibly 
35:1069:89247:20:21:90:541:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:because we have changed frontiers for primary and secondary education.  Once a country has 
35:1070:89338:21:21:90:506:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:reached full enrollments and high attendance up through age 15, and the average child 
35:1071:89424:21:20:90:519:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:reaches 8,000 hours of instruction between the 5th and 15th birthdays, adding further tax 
35:1072:89514:20:21:90:512:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:support can only raise test scores, productivity, and income by improving the quality of 
35:1073:89603:21:21:90:499:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:learning per hour of contact time.  How money translates into quality learning is less 
35:1074:89690:21:21:90:140:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:obvious.   
35:1075:89701:21:20:126:541:501:144:Times:144:Times:C: Figures 10 and 11 offer crude hints about this developmental shift, by graphing recent 
35:1076:89788:20:21:90:514:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:test scores against expenditures per primary school pupil.  Figure 10 notes two different 
35:1077:89878:21:21:90:514:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:slopes in the international OECD data for 2004-2006.  If we include the new test-taking 
35:1078:89966:21:20:90:514:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries Turkey, Chile, and Mexico in the sample, there is still an upward slope:  more 
35:1079:90055:20:21:90:523:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:public expenditures seem to be accompanied by higher test scores.  If the PISA tests were 
35:1080:90145:21:21:90:534:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:given to 15-year-olds world-wide, then most of the test-taking students would yield national 
35:1081:90238:21:20:89:526:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:averages like those of Turkey, Chile, and Mexico, or further to the southwest in Figure 10, 
35:1082:90330:20:21:89:537:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:and there would be a even more significant positive slope relating public expenditures to test 
35:1083:90425:21:21:89:524:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:scores.  Yet among the rich OECD core countries (white circles) and formerly communist 
35:1084:90512:21:20:89:484:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries of Eastern Europe (black triangles), the slope between expenditures and 
35:1085:90594:20:21:90:540:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:achievement scores is nearly flat.  Countries spending much more failed to raise their student 
35:1086:90689:21:21:90:529:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:test scores significantly.  Figure 11 finds the same twist among states of the United States.  
35:1087:90784:21:21:90:482:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:Over all 50 states, there appears to be a significant upslope relating public school 
35:1088:90869:21:20:90:516:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:expenditures and the NAEP test performance of eighth-graders.  Yet the 50-state picture 
35:1089:90957:20:21:90:478:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:includes several poorer states of the South and West that have not completed the 
35:1090:91038:21:21:90:540:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:developmental shift.  True, their children stay in school past age 15, and their schools run the 
35:1091:91135:21:20:90:533:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:same 175-180 days per year as in the rest of the country.  Yet their lower spending seems to 
35:1092:91228:20:21:90:535:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:have lowered quality by raising class sizes in the Western states, and in unmeasured ways in 
35:1093:91321:21:21:90:531:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:the South.  Yet when we restrict our view to the more prosperous and established Northeast 
35:1094:91412:21:20:90:536:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:and North Central regions, the effect of expenditures drops to insignificance, as indicated by 
35:1095:91507:20:36:90:489:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:the thicker line.  Once one looks only at regions where the lowest state average for 
36:1096:91592:36:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        35                                                                        
36:1097:91886:0:20:90:509:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:expenditures per student is already high, one gets the kind of result that Eric Hanushek 
36:1098:91975:20:21:90:401:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:repeats so often: no clearly significant effect of spending more.   
36:1099:92043:21:21:126:497:667:144:Times:144:Times:C: Once a region’s income and educational effort is up in the range where extra 
36:1100:92120:21:20:90:524:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:expenditures have less certain effect, it should not surprise us to find more abundant clues 
36:1101:92213:20:21:90:521:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:that something other than expenditures is responsible for those anomalous cases in which 
36:1102:92302:21:21:89:522:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:rich areas have poorer education performance.  And so it seems for two anomalous under-
36:1103:92389:21:20:89:535:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:performers in the United States.  One is the District of Columbia, where test scores were too 
36:1104:92483:20:21:90:540:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:low to fit conveniently on Figure 11.  Even though the District has a technically high average 
36:1105:92578:21:21:90:529:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:income, its income inequality is extreme and its school system is stricken with controversy 
36:1106:92670:21:21:90:379:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:and fighting. Expenditure levels are not the prime suspect.   
36:1107:92732:21:20:126:511:501:144:Times:144:Times:C: The other poor performer to be noted here is California, which shares with New 
36:1108:92811:20:21:90:535:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:Mexico and Hawaii the unenviable position of having low student test scores despite having 
36:1109:92902:21:21:90:517:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:an average income level. Why are California’s test scores worse than those of Texas and 
36:1110:92990:21:20:90:535:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:North Carolina, with their similar expenditures and similar percentages of ethnic minorities, 
36:1111:93084:20:21:90:534:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:by about 1.5 standard deviations among state averages?  The relatively lower test scores can 
36:1112:93177:21:21:90:536:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:be only partly due to low expenditures.  Despite frequent rumors to the effect that California 
36:1113:93272:21:20:90:509:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:ranks 49th in education spending per pupil, or in education spending as a share of state 
36:1114:93361:20:21:90:535:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:income, its expenditures are only moderately low by inter-state standards.  In the 2004-2005 
36:1115:93454:21:21:90:521:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:school year, California’s current expenditures per enrolled student were 91 percent of the 
36:1116:93545:21:20:90:528:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:national average.  The performance looks a bit anomalous for a state with a slightly higher-
36:1117:93637:20:21:90:510:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:than-average income, yet California’s rank among states was still no worse than 30th.   
36:1118:93725:21:21:126:484:274:144:Times:144:Times:C: The input measure that does put California near the bottom of states is not 
36:1119:93801:21:21:89:526:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:expenditures, but teachers per pupil, the inverse of class size. California ranks 48th, above 
36:1120:93895:21:20:89:211:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:only Arizona and Utah.   
36:1121:93920:20:21:125:532:212:144:Times:144:Times:C: If California pays for fewer teachers for each (say) 100 students than any other state 
36:1122:94007:21:21:89:525:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:but Arizona and Utah, why were its expenditures not so far below average? California has 
36:1123:94096:21:20:89:538:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:apparently always ranked near the top in average annual pay for a state’s teachers.  That may 
36:1124:94190:20:21:89:526:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:have been true as far back as 1880. With greater certainty, we know that California ranked 
36:1125:94281:21:21:89:514:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:2nd-7th among states in average teacher pay since 1939 or earlier, and ranks 3rd by this 
36:1126:94370:21:56:89:173:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:measure today.58 
37:1127:94386:56:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        36                                                                        
37:1128:94680:0:20:126:522:708:144:Times:144:Times:C: To pin down causes, it also helps to know when California’s relative performance 
37:1129:94761:20:21:90:497:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:sagged, and which suspects would have contributed to this sagging.  The anomaly is 
37:1130:94844:21:21:90:477:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:relatively recent.  For relative expenditures per pupil, we know that California’s 
37:1131:94927:21:20:90:524:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:expenditures per pupil ranked as high as 7th back in 1960. Its spending per pupil has been 
37:1132:95018:20:21:90:511:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:below average only since sometime in the 1980s, reaching a trough at 87 percent of the 
37:1133:95105:21:21:90:484:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:national average in the mid-1990s, reviving to 96 percent after the dot-com boom 
37:1134:95186:21:20:90:426:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:centered in Silicon Valley, and sliding down to 91 percent since then. 
37:1135:95257:20:21:126:489:564:144:Times:144:Times:C: The simple non-econometric evidence suggests that the California political 
37:1136:95332:21:21:89:502:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:outcome in school finance is peculiarly inefficient, and not simply by denying funds.  
37:1137:95419:21:21:89:522:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:While the famous Serrano decisions and Proposition 13 clearly cut expenditures since the 
37:1138:95508:21:20:89:481:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:1970s, the story is not simply one of a polity trapped by anti-tax radicals. Rather, 
37:1139:95593:20:21:89:509:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:California has caught between this force and at least two others since about the 1970s:  
37:1140:95682:21:21:89:481:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:high immigration and a powerful teachers’ lobby.  The result combines moderate 
37:1141:95761:21:20:89:470:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:expenditures with high teacher pay, crowded classrooms, and low test scores.

37:1143:95840:21:14:211:403:398:144:Times:144:Times:C:VII. CONCLUSIONS AND AGENDA 
37:1144:95868:14:21:89:92:384:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
37:1145:95868:21:20:126:516:363:144:Times:144:Times:C: It should now be evident why this paper focuses on revealing failures rather than 
37:1146:95950:20:21:90:524:343:144:Times:144:Times:B:on revealing successes in education output, and why its title highlights finance rather than 
37:1147:96043:21:21:89:496:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:learning.  The failures appear to spring more from the public finance side, making it 
37:1148:96129:21:20:89:496:301:144:Times:144:Times:B:easier for economists and economic historians to suggest solutions.  By contrast, the 
37:1149:96215:20:21:89:516:281:144:Times:144:Times:B:success cases probably relate less to economists’ comparative research advantage, being 
37:1150:96303:21:21:89:489:260:144:Times:144:Times:B:due in greater part to differences in pedagogical technique and social environment. 
37:1151:96387:21:20:126:510:239:144:Times:144:Times:C: There are sufficient non-econometric tools to exploit and interpret the abundant 
37:1152:96468:20:21:89:518:219:144:Times:144:Times:B:historical information about the progress of schooling in the data-constrained past.  Even 
37:1153:96559:21:21:89:485:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:without the randomized natural experiments that we prefer, we can identify prime 
37:1154:96640:21:20:89:368:177:144:Times:144:Times:B:suspects for several cases of failure in education supply.   
37:1155:96701:20:21:126:490:157:144:Times:144:Times:C: We can even see some patterns in the preliminary signs.  Looking at earlier 
37:1156:96777:21:21:89:517:136:144:Times:144:Times:B:centuries, it should easier to find cases where education was under-supported rather than 
37:1157:96867:21:21:89:520:115:144:Times:144:Times:B:over-supported, given the high rates of return not captured.  Most visible failures seem to 
37:1158:96959:21:42:89:496:94:144:Times:144:Times:B:be cases of inegalitarian policy, under-investing in mass primary schooling.  So past 
38:1159:97045:42:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        37                                                                        
38:1160:97339:0:20:90:514:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:scholars have feared, and so say the new indicators especially for Victorian Britain, and 
38:1161:97429:20:21:89:512:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:possibly for Belgium in the late nineteenth century.  We have also raised the possibility 
38:1162:97519:21:21:90:478:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:that secure Western European states could have accelerated mass education, and 
38:1163:97598:21:20:90:507:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:economic growth, as much as two centuries earlier than they did.  The balance of guilt 
38:1164:97685:20:21:89:498:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:may be shifting.  Our clues from the start of the twenty-first century point less at tax-
38:1165:97774:21:21:89:507:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:blocking elites, and more at the messiness of political compromises between them and 
38:1166:97859:21:20:89:175:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:their opponents.   
38:1167:97878:20:21:126:500:564:144:Times:144:Times:C: These modest early clues point toward at least four areas for further detective 
38:1168:97958:21:21:89:288:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:work in the history of education finance: 
38:1169:98000:21:21:126:504:522:144:Times:144:Times:C: (1) One set of projects relates to the reasons for the delay in Western Europe’s 
38:1170:98081:21:20:90:478:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:public primary schooling.  In which cases did those in power pass up productive 
38:1171:98161:20:21:90:520:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:opportunities because their narrow self-interest opposed educating the masses?  In which 
38:1172:98250:21:21:90:524:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:cases were they not sufficiently secure in their power to believe that the later tax revenues 
38:1173:98344:21:20:89:497:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:from a more educated population would be theirs to control? For example, could the 
38:1174:98427:20:21:90:510:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:Dutch Republic have launched free schools in the first half of the 17th century, leading 
38:1175:98516:21:21:90:521:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:their actual history by two and a half centuries?  Might the government budget have been 
38:1176:98605:21:20:90:482:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:able to spend more on wars with England with the help of the extra taxes raised?  
38:1177:98687:20:21:90:512:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:Certainly they could have borrowed the extra money, if they chose, at interest rates that 
38:1178:98777:21:21:90:521:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:were even lower than Britain’s consol rate before 1792 and only about one percent above 
38:1179:98865:21:20:90:516:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:the consol rate for most of the nineteenth century. For France, too, it is possible to argue 
38:1180:98958:20:21:90:427:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:that political opposition delayed schooling by more than a century.59   
38:1181:99030:21:21:126:487:274:144:Times:144:Times:C: (2) Another project would pursue whether or not the early failure in public 
38:1182:99106:21:21:89:469:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:primary education was matched by public health failure.  Why were the public 
38:1183:99183:21:20:89:503:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:improvements in urban sanitation, for example, delayed until the nineteenth century?  
38:1184:99269:20:21:89:497:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:One possibility is that sanitation, unlike basic education, waited on breakthroughs in 
38:1185:99356:21:21:89:513:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:knowledge, such as the discovery of the link between water supplies and cholera.  If so, 
38:1186:99445:21:20:89:516:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:policy may have been blameless in this area of public health.  An opposing possibility is 
38:1187:99535:20:21:89:507:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggested by Jeffrey Williamson, who notes that some partial advances in English and 
38:1188:99620:21:21:89:474:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:French urban sanitation dated back to the late seventeenth century and the early 
38:1189:99701:21:56:90:516:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:eighteenth, suggesting a policy failure of the sort described for primary education in this 
39:1190:99793:56:0:90:738:52:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                Page                                                                        38                                                                        
39:1191:100087:0:20:90:486:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:paper.60  Here is a related policy issue for which a broad early history can use non-
39:1192:100172:20:21:90:215:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:econometric techniques.   
39:1193:100197:21:21:126:507:667:144:Times:144:Times:C: (3) Another research priority is to pursue an issue that is a close relative of this 
39:1194:100282:21:20:90:507:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:paper’s inquiry into mass primary and secondary education: How would one judge the 
39:1195:100365:20:21:90:495:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:insufficiency or excess of public support for higher education, beyond the few clues 
39:1196:100450:21:21:90:511:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggested by some literature cited here?  And does a closer look really substantiate this 
39:1197:100540:21:20:90:484:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:paper’s suspicions against excess spending on tertiary education at the expense of 
39:1198:100623:20:21:90:214:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:primary and secondary?   
39:1199:100648:21:21:126:491:543:144:Times:144:Times:C: (4) Finally, why was the balance of apparent guilt different in the past from 
39:1200:100726:21:21:90:500:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:today’s patterns in the OECD and within the United States?  In earlier history, and in 
39:1201:100813:21:20:90:482:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:developing countries today, the most frequent culprit appears to have been elites’ 
39:1202:100896:20:21:90:503:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:blocking of tax support for schools.  So we saw in the case of British education in the 
39:1203:100984:21:21:90:504:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and also in the global tendency for social rates of 
39:1204:101073:21:20:90:493:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:return on still-unachieved schooling to be highest at in poorer countries.  In today’s 
39:1205:101160:20:21:90:516:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:OECD countries, however, the cases of clear under-funding of mass education are being 
39:1206:101246:21:21:90:502:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:crowded out by cases of apparent inefficiency in some polities’ delivery of education 
39:1207:101332:21:20:90:520:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:from historically high budgets.  Explaining this long drift from inegalitarian tax-blocking 
39:1208:101424:20:21:90:516:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:to inefficient political compromise remains high on the research agenda in the history of 
39:1209:101514:21:21:90:149:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:education.

41:1267:104689:13:14:90:416:569:144:Times:144:Times:B:Fuller definitions of the support ratio indicators (fingerprints):  
41:1268:104756:14:14:90:494:555:144:Times:144:Times:B:(3a) Absolute tax support for primary pupils  = (tax-based expenditures per primary 
41:1269:104840:14:14:90:273:541:144:Times:144:Times:B:school pupil) / (GDP per adult).   
41:1270:104874:14:14:90:511:527:144:Times:144:Times:B:(3b) Relative tax support for primary pupils = the same double ratio, but divided by the 
41:1271:104963:14:13:90:343:513:144:Times:144:Times:B:corresponding double ratio for university education.

41:1273:105016:14:14:90:483:486:144:Times:144:Times:B:Imagined exogenous sources of each force, and further explanation of the effects: 
41:1274:105098:14:14:90:511:472:144:Times:144:Times:B:More demand for child labor:  May be due to shifts toward child-using sectors, such as 
41:1275:105185:14:15:90:484:458:144:Times:144:Times:B:agriculture.  Would lower school attendance, of course, later raising the supply of 
41:1276:105269:15:13:90:498:443:144:Times:144:Times:B:unskilled adult labor at the expense of skilled labor.  So the wage gain ΔW would be 
41:1277:105354:13:14:90:149:430:144:Times:144:Times:B:raised later. 
41:1278:105368:14:14:90:93:416:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
41:1279:105368:14:14:90:491:402:144:Times:144:Times:B:High unit costs of schooling:  May be due to restrictions training fewer teachers, or 
41:1280:105454:14:13:90:480:388:144:Times:144:Times:B:denying teacher careers to women, or less efficiency in education techniques. By 
41:1281:105535:13:14:90:522:375:144:Times:144:Times:B:lowering the supply of more educated entrants into the labor force, such cost-push factors 
41:1282:105626:14:14:90:404:361:144:Times:144:Times:B:will raise the wage gains for those who have the extra schooling.

41:1284:105692:14:14:90:509:333:144:Times:144:Times:B:Less market demand for skilled labor: Could be due to de-skilling shifts in technology. 
41:1285:105780:14:13:90:524:319:144:Times:144:Times:B:Symmetrically, it can be due to any force that shifts demand toward more skills in Setting

45:1447:113415:14:14:89:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:Brazil, and developing countries.  Korea's figure is so low because of a high private share

47:1512:118345:14:14:90:516:362:144:Times:144:Times:B:The main source for Venezuela is Carl Shoup et al. (1959), and for Mexico the works of 
47:1513:118432:14:14:90:273:348:144:Times:144:Times:B:Martin Carnoy (1964, 1967a, 1967b). 
47:1514:118468:14:13:126:505:334:144:Times:144:Times:C: These are supplemented with life-table survival rates based on data from 1959-
47:1515:118546:13:14:90:506:321:144:Times:144:Times:B:1961 for Mexico and 1963 for Venezuela.  Carnoy conducted his own survey of a few 
47:1516:118628:14:14:90:490:307:144:Times:144:Times:B:thousand urban Mexican workers and their family members in 1963, and based his 
47:1517:118707:14:14:90:524:293:144:Times:144:Times:B:published rates of return on these micro-data.  By contrast, Shoup and collaborators based 
47:1518:118798:14:14:90:512:279:144:Times:144:Times:B:their estimates of present values and rates of return for Venezuela on aggregate average

47:1520:118950:13:14:126:508:252:144:Times:144:Times:C: Both sets of data have been reworked here, however, to refine the fiscal side of 
47:1521:119031:14:14:90:507:238:144:Times:144:Times:B:education.  My retention of most of Carnoy's assumptions yields rates of returns in the 
47:1522:119119:14:14:90:511:224:144:Times:144:Times:B:same range as his.  For Venezuela, however, my rates of return are below the very high 
47:1523:119206:14:14:90:473:210:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates announced by Shoup and his collaborators.  The main reasons for the 
47:1524:119284:14:13:90:501:196:144:Times:144:Times:B:discrepancy are that (a) Shoup and collaborators omitted any opportunity costs of the 
47:1525:119370:13:14:90:510:183:144:Times:144:Times:B:student's time, and (b) they omitted indirect taxation (usually 10-11 percent of income) 
47:1526:119459:14:14:90:524:169:144:Times:144:Times:B:from their calculations of private and social returns, and omitted any fiscal rates of return.

56:1583:123366:14:13:126:507:639:144:Times:144:Times:C: The estimates of GDP per capita in 1870, 1900, and 1930 in 1990 international 
56:1584:123444:13:14:90:503:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:PPP dollars are those of Angus Maddison (1995 and 2001).  The enrollments data are 
56:1585:123527:14:14:90:506:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:derived from other sources in Lindert (2004, Volume 2, Appendix A), from the Banks 
56:1586:123610:14:14:90:503:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:post-1815 data base, and from Benavot and Riddle (1988), in that order of priority. In 
56:1587:123697:14:14:90:514:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:some cases where it was impossible to obtain the 5-14 population denominator from the 
56:1588:123783:14:13:90:490:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:Lindert sources or from Banks, I used the school age population denominator from 
56:1589:123864:13:14:90:442:557:144:Times:144:Times:B:Benavot and Riddle, introducing some differences in the ratio definition. 
56:1590:123938:14:14:126:487:543:144:Times:144:Times:C: The reason that the UK dot fails to look like a weighted average within the 
56:1591:124014:14:14:90:510:529:144:Times:144:Times:B:triangle formed by England-Wales, Ireland, and Scotland seems to be that the GDP per 
56:1592:124099:14:14:90:525:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:capita and the enrollment rates are based on different weighting schemes (total population 
56:1593:124190:14:13:90:210:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:versus population 5-14).

64:1886:144508:13:22:90:509:639:42:Times:100:Times:F:2 A classic non-econometric single-country study is North and Weingast (1989), with revisions by Clark 
64:1887:144611:22:17:89:518:617:100:Times:100:Times:F:(1996).  The econometric testing of institutional influences from earlier centuries has been led by De Long 
64:1888:144719:17:13:89:516:600:100:Times:100:Times:F:and Shleifer (1993); Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001, 2002); and Acemoglu and Johnson (2005).

64:1891:144941:22:13:90:479:548:100:Times:100:Times:F:macro-estimates of the effects of education does not deny its positive role (Pritchett 2001, 2008). 
64:1892:145041:13:21:90:504:535:42:Times:100:Times:F:5 On the civic participation effects of schooling, see Dee (2004) and Milligan, Moretti, and Oreopoulos 
64:1893:145145:21:18:90:521:514:100:Times:100:Times:F:2004.  On its crime prevention effect, see Lochner and Moretti (2004). Currie and Moretti (2003) and other 
64:1894:145252:18:17:90:516:496:100:Times:100:Times:F:studies find positive effects of schooling on health. Other studies use production-function econometrics to 
64:1895:145360:17:17:90:508:479:100:Times:100:Times:F:capture the productivity effects of spillovers that leave no specific imprint (Moretti 2004a, 2004b, and a 
64:1896:145467:17:17:90:464:462:100:Times:100:Times:F:survey in 2006). See also the surveys by Krueger and Lindahl (2001) and McMahon (2004).  
64:1897:145556:17:18:125:503:445:100:Times:100:Times:?: The natural-experiment study by Acemoglu and Angrist (2000) emphasized the low statistical 
64:1898:145647:18:17:90:508:427:100:Times:100:Times:F:significance of externalities from the extra schooling triggered by compulsory schooling laws.  Yet they 
64:1899:145752:17:17:90:493:410:100:Times:100:Times:F:authors acknowledge that their point estimates still include enough externalities to justify noticeable 
64:1900:145856:17:13:89:483:393:100:Times:100:Times:F:subsidies, and that their experiment was limited to externalities from secondary education alone.   
64:1901:145956:13:17:90:515:380:42:Times:100:Times:F:6 See, for example Angrist and Krueger (1991), Acemoglu and Angrist (2000), and Lleras-Muney (2005).

64:1903:146159:22:17:89:503:341:100:Times:100:Times:F:transatlantic empirics are also comparative and reach conclusions like those of the Engerman-Mariscal-
64:1904:146261:17:17:89:514:324:100:Times:100:Times:F:Sokoloff team, but tend to rely more on panel-data econometrics, with the usual caveats about exogeneity 
64:1905:146366:17:13:89:302:307:100:Times:100:Times:F:and instrument power (Lindert 2004, Chs. 5 and 15). 
64:1906:146418:13:22:90:524:294:42:Times:100:Times:F:8 If there are exceptions in which society over-invested public funds in primary education rather than higher 
64:1907:146528:22:17:90:524:272:100:Times:100:Times:F:education, they would probably be highly egalitarian communist regimes, such as Cuba under Castro.  Yet I 
64:1908:146634:17:13:90:437:255:100:Times:100:Times:F:am not aware of any study that has quantified such overinvestment in basic education. 
64:1909:146720:13:22:90:519:242:42:Times:100:Times:F:9 Lack of numeracy is demonstrated in the aggregate by age heaping, the tendency to round numbers off to 
64:1910:146825:22:12:89:479:220:100:Times:100:Times:F:integers ending in 0 or 5.  See Baten and Crayen (2008) and A’Hearn, Baten, and Crayen (2009). 
64:1911:146920:12:22:90:518:208:42:Times:100:Times:F:10 The underlying structure shaping education outcomes might conceivably involve different a’s and b’s in 
64:1912:147026:22:17:90:490:186:100:Times:100:Times:F:the two polities.  If so, any judgment of the education performance of B should use a counterfactual 
64:1913:147127:17:18:90:476:169:100:Times:100:Times:F:drawing on the coefficients from B, posing questions of the form “If B had had A’s values of the 
64:1914:147224:18:17:90:510:151:100:Times:100:Times:F:independent variables Edt-1, Z and X, how would its education outcome have differed, in our view, given 
64:1915:147328:17:13:89:172:134:100:Times:100:Times:F:B’s own structure?” 
64:1916:147348:13:21:90:484:121:42:Times:100:Times:F:11 The poverty defense argues that exogenous income determinants (in the Z vector) have lowered 
64:1917:147444:21:18:90:493:100:100:Times:100:Times:F:education simply because the income elasticity of education is positive.  The Wagner’s Law defense 
64:1918:147543:18:30:90:497:82:100:Times:100:Times:F:excuses the poorer and lower-education country even from spending as great a share of its income on

65:1921:148081:11:18:90:503:697:100:Times:100:Times:F:public services (in this case, public education).  Applying either of these defenses requires that the less 
65:1922:148189:18:12:90:509:679:100:Times:100:Times:F:educated country be the poorer one, which is ruled out in the cases defined as education anomalies here.

65:1933:149173:13:22:90:506:494:42:Times:100:Times:F:15 According to Penn World Table 6.2, Niger’s income per capita has now sunk sufficiently since about

65:1938:149451:17:22:90:490:408:42:Times:100:Times:F:19 Even a relatively unhealthy country today, like Burkina Faso, is arguably on the same enrollment 
65:1939:149551:22:17:90:506:386:100:Times:100:Times:F:trajectory, and the same life expectancy, as were England and America at nineteenth-century dates with 
65:1940:149654:17:17:90:522:369:100:Times:100:Times:F:comparable PPP incomes per capita.  For the enrollment comparison, see Clemens (2004, especially Tables 
65:1941:149758:17:18:90:523:352:100:Times:100:Times:F:10, 11).  Life expectancy from birth in Burkino Faso was about 44 years at the end of the twentieth century, 
65:1942:149867:18:17:90:513:334:100:Times:100:Times:F:versus 40 in England in 1851 or 38 in the United States in 1850 (Wrigley and Schofield 1981, Table A.3;

65:1945:150132:17:22:90:519:287:42:Times:100:Times:F:21 For United States, one could start with the data series in Claudia Goldin’s education chapter in volume 2 
65:1946:150241:22:17:90:508:265:100:Times:100:Times:F:of Carter et al. (2006), and consult Solmon (1970, 1975) for detailed cost estimates by state in 1880 and

65:1948:150355:13:21:90:504:235:42:Times:100:Times:F:22 In addition to the correlations shown in Figures 5 and 6, see Tan and Mingat (1992), OECD (various 
65:1949:150457:21:18:90:508:214:100:Times:100:Times:F:years), and UNESCO (various years).  IQ scores have also been correlated with economic development, 
65:1950:150557:18:17:90:514:196:100:Times:100:Times:F:both internationally in recent years and across the 20th century in each of several OECD countries (Flynn 
65:1951:150663:17:17:90:519:179:100:Times:100:Times:F:1984, 1987, 2000).  It remains to be seen how much the improvement in IQ scores relates to schooling and

66:1965:152022:12:22:90:512:598:42:Times:100:Times:F:29 This paper uses only the “full method” cross-sectional estimates based on monetary benefits and costs, 
66:1966:152128:22:17:90:510:576:100:Times:100:Times:F:avoiding any rates of return in the tradition of Jacob Mincer.  The Mincerian estimates never explore the 
66:1967:152234:17:18:90:520:559:100:Times:100:Times:F:costs of education, or who paid for them, and instead use extra years of schooling as a cost proxy.  Such an 
66:1968:152343:18:17:90:517:541:100:Times:100:Times:F:approach is a non-starter here, given this paper’s desire to focus more attention on who paid whom for the 
66:1969:152450:17:17:90:518:524:100:Times:100:Times:F:schooling.  In addition, the Mincerian estimates have come in for serious econometric criticisms regarding 
66:1970:152557:17:13:90:492:507:100:Times:100:Times:F:their functional form (e.g. Heckman, Lochner, and Todd 2008), and often yield unstable estimates.   
66:1971:152657:13:22:90:500:494:42:Times:100:Times:F:30 As Lant Pritchett has pointed out (2001, 373, note 6), the higher rate of return on primary education 
66:1972:152762:22:17:90:486:472:100:Times:100:Times:F:derives not so much from a higher percent pay increase in later life as from the simple fact that the 
66:1973:152864:17:13:90:478:455:100:Times:100:Times:F:opportunity cost of the child’s time is so much lower in the earlier years of the education cycle.

66:1977:153117:17:22:90:516:391:42:Times:100:Times:F:34 In an open economy, one would have to lower the tax rate to reflect partial losses due to an average rate 
66:1978:153226:22:17:90:509:369:100:Times:100:Times:F:of brain drain.  This paper deals mainly with large-country cases, where this effect would be negligible.  
66:1979:153333:17:18:90:500:352:100:Times:100:Times:F:One might also worry that the calculations need to include any crowding out or crowding in of private 
66:1980:153435:18:17:90:512:334:100:Times:100:Times:F:education from the extension of government subsidies.  Yet the calculations applied in this paper assume 
66:1981:153540:17:17:90:507:317:100:Times:100:Times:F:that the government subsidizes all schools, as in a voucher plan, so that substitution between public and 
66:1982:153646:17:17:90:521:300:100:Times:100:Times:F:private schools has less relevance.  One must also not overlook something obvious to the historian: In most 
66:1983:153754:17:18:90:511:283:100:Times:100:Times:F:settings where public subsidies were not provided, private schooling was also lacking for most children.  
66:1984:153860:18:12:90:306:265:100:Times:100:Times:F:This would have limited the amount of crowding out. 
66:1985:153912:12:22:90:513:253:42:Times:100:Times:F:35 One can choose variants on this basic measure, depending on practicalities and purpose.  They fall into 
66:1986:154019:22:17:90:514:231:100:Times:100:Times:F:three main categories: (1) tax effort, (2) absolute public inputs per child, and (3) relative public inputs per 
66:1987:154131:17:18:90:413:214:100:Times:100:Times:F:child (the “support ratio” featured here).  Each has its strengths and weaknesses. 
66:1988:154214:18:17:125:507:196:100:Times:100:Times:?: (1) Tax effort is conveniently measured by the share of national income devoted to subsidizing 
66:1989:154309:17:17:90:515:179:100:Times:100:Times:F:primary education.  This straightforward ratio unfortunately can be raised or lowered just by diffrences in 
66:1990:154417:17:17:90:519:162:100:Times:100:Times:F:the share of population that is school-aged, making a country look less generous when in fact it simply has 
66:1991:154525:17:18:90:289:145:100:Times:100:Times:F:fewer children (e.g. nineteenth-century France).   
66:1992:154576:18:17:125:510:127:100:Times:100:Times:?: (2) The absolute public inputs of subsidies per child are closer to the input concept preferred by 
66:1993:154675:17:17:90:491:110:100:Times:100:Times:F:the production-function literature in the economics of education.  These inputs can be measured per 
66:1994:154775:17:17:90:519:93:100:Times:100:Times:F:enrolled pupil, per attending pupil, or per child of school age.  The last denominator has the advantage and 
66:1995:154884:17:24:90:518:76:100:Times:100:Times:F:disadvantage of including the enrollment or attendance rate in the measure. That is good or bad depending

67:1997:155284:0:11:521:524:708:144:Times:144:Times:C:                                                                                                                                                 
67:1998:155428:11:18:90:514:697:100:Times:100:Times:F:on whether enrollment and attendance were driven by the supply of student slots (our present purpose) or 
67:1999:155533:18:17:90:214:679:100:Times:100:Times:F:the parental demand for slots.  
67:2000:155565:17:17:125:508:662:100:Times:100:Times:?: (3) The relative public inputs per child is captured by the “support ratio” of (subsidies/child) to 
67:2001:155665:17:17:90:504:645:100:Times:100:Times:F:(GDP per capita or per adult of working age).  It best dramatizes the departures from the usual positive 
67:2002:155770:17:18:90:513:628:100:Times:100:Times:F:Wagner’s Law relationship of tax effort to income per capita.  Here again its “child” measure can refer to 
67:2003:155877:18:17:90:504:610:100:Times:100:Times:F:enrolled students, attending students, or children of school age.  The choice again depends on which of 
67:2004:155981:17:17:90:515:593:100:Times:100:Times:F:these comes closest to tracking the supply of subsidies as opposed to parental demand.  My choices in the 
67:2005:156087:17:13:90:432:576:100:Times:100:Times:F:text reflect my hunches about how best to proxy the public supply-of-subsidies side.  
67:2006:156173:13:22:90:508:563:42:Times:100:Times:F:36 In cases of discriminatory access to subsidized schools, one must avoid the pitfall of mis-applying the 
67:2007:156280:22:17:90:509:541:100:Times:100:Times:F:subsidies per favored-group student to the larger population or its incomes.  For example, one must take 
67:2008:156385:17:17:90:524:524:100:Times:100:Times:F:care not to use the wrong data from the American post-bellum South or from South Africa under apartheid.  
67:2009:156491:17:17:90:519:507:100:Times:100:Times:F:Separate support ratios must be applied to different groups, and compared with the incomes of the relevant 
67:2010:156598:17:13:90:133:490:100:Times:100:Times:F:taxpayers.

67:2012:156666:17:22:90:517:460:42:Times:100:Times:F:38 For the debate over whether externalities are truly greater in higher education, and how this might hinge 
67:2013:156775:22:17:90:520:438:100:Times:100:Times:F:on the degree of separability of research from instruction, see Birsdall (1987, 1996) versus Psacharopoulos 
67:2014:156883:17:13:90:411:421:100:Times:100:Times:F:(1996).  See also Behrman (1996) on the methodological difficulties involved.   
67:2015:156963:13:17:90:228:408:42:Times:100:Times:F:39 Castelló and Doménech (2002). 
67:2016:156996:17:22:90:505:391:42:Times:100:Times:F:40 The comparison with current leading-country practice can be doubted and replaced with an opposing 
67:2017:157097:22:17:89:515:369:100:Times:100:Times:F:infant-industry or Gerschenkronian argument in favor of tilting toward investments in higher education in 
67:2018:157203:17:18:89:508:352:100:Times:100:Times:F:developing countries.  Given that higher education calls for very high fixed costs before its research and 
67:2019:157310:18:17:89:489:334:100:Times:100:Times:F:instruction can compete with the leading foreign universities, it might be more necessary for higher 
67:2020:157411:17:17:90:512:317:100:Times:100:Times:F:education than for primary education to have the government force its growth with heavy subsidies.  The 
67:2021:157515:17:17:90:361:300:100:Times:100:Times:F:present paper can only pose this possibility, and not yet resolved it. 
67:2022:157586:17:18:125:523:283:100:Times:100:Times:?: A key clue to the validity of the infant-industry or Gerschenkronian argument would be whether or 
67:2023:157684:18:17:90:493:265:100:Times:100:Times:F:not countries that caught up in the past and became educational leaders did it by tipping government 
67:2024:157785:17:17:90:500:248:100:Times:100:Times:F:subsidies away from primary education and toward higher education, like some of today’s developing 
67:2025:157884:17:17:90:511:231:100:Times:100:Times:F:countries covered in Table 4.  A good case study would be North America and Australasia, which had to 
67:2026:157986:17:18:90:511:214:100:Times:100:Times:F:catch up with Britain, France, and Germany in the nineteenth century.  While I am still gathering data on 
67:2027:158092:18:17:90:522:196:100:Times:100:Times:F:American university finance between the Civil War and World War II, it seems that the Northeastern states 
67:2028:158198:17:17:90:496:179:100:Times:100:Times:F:achieved their global prominence in higher education with primary/tertiary ratios above the text 50% 
67:2029:158299:17:17:90:521:162:100:Times:100:Times:F:threshold, to judge from the data for 1850 and from 1950 on.  The Southern and Western states usually had 
67:2030:158405:17:13:90:383:145:100:Times:100:Times:F:lower primary/tertiary ratios, but also failed to catch up to the Northeast.

68:2042:159854:17:17:90:513:593:100:Times:100:Times:F:Long’s work may have been too pessimistic in assuming that it would take six years of primary school to 
68:2043:159958:17:13:90:520:576:100:Times:100:Times:F:achieve the kind of wage gains estimated by Long.  I am grateful to him for his advice on these estimates.

68:2051:160516:18:21:90:522:442:42:Times:100:Times:F:50 Nugent and Robinson (forthcoming) are also urging the shift of more attention to the development policy

68:2053:160713:13:22:90:507:408:42:Times:100:Times:F:51 The relative position of Latin America for given income per capita is less dramatic in Figures 2 and 3 
68:2054:160819:22:17:90:510:386:100:Times:100:Times:F:than in Frankema’s 4.1 because of a difference in samples.  Figures 2 and 3 include more countries from 
68:2055:160923:17:13:90:516:369:100:Times:100:Times:F:outside of the OECD core, some of which had enrollment deficiencies similar to those of Latin America.

68:2067:161759:22:17:90:522:162:100:Times:100:Times:F:California ranked second to Colorado in such costs per pupil. This was likely a wage effect at least as much
