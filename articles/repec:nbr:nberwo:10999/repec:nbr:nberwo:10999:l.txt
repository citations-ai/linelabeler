2:25:1133:28:28:71:539:602:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:We develop a multi-tasking model in which a firm can devote its efforts either to increasing sales
2:26:1231:28:29:71:539:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:growth,  or  to  improving  per-unit  profit  margins  by,  e.g.,  cutting  costs.  If  the  firm’s  manager  is
2:27:1343:29:28:71:539:545:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:concerned with the current stock price, she will tend to favor the growth strategy at those times when
2:28:1445:28:28:71:539:517:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:the stock market is paying more attention to performance on the growth dimension. Conversely, it
2:29:1541:28:28:71:539:489:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:can be rational for the stock market to weight observed growth measures more heavily when it is
2:30:1636:28:29:71:539:461:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:known that the firm is following a growth strategy. This two-way feedback between firms’ business
2:31:1733:29:28:71:539:432:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:strategies and the market’s pricing rule can lead to purely intrinsic fluctuations in sales and output,
2:32:1836:28:28:71:539:404:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:creating excess volatility in these real variables even in the absence of any external source of shocks.

3:47:2177:0:32:133:246:657:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:C:1  Introduction
3:48:2192:32:12:133:477:625:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:In his companyís annual report for 2001, Amazon.com founder and CEO Je§rey
3:49:2266:12:19:133:348:613:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Bezos begins his letter to shareholders as follows:
3:50:2317:19:12:165:452:594:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:?:ìIn July of last year, Amazon.com reached an important way sta-
3:51:2380:12:12:158:452:582:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:tion.  After four years of single-minded focus on growth, and then
3:52:2446:12:12:158:452:570:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:just under two years spent almost exclusively on lowering costs, we
3:53:2513:12:12:158:452:558:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:reached a point where we could a§ord to balance growth and cost
3:54:2576:12:19:158:443:546:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:improvement, dedicating resources and sta§ed projects to both.î
3:55:2639:19:12:148:477:527:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:As this statement suggests, many Örms face a fundamental strategic tradeo§:
3:56:2714:12:12:133:477:515:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:they can focus their e§orts on increasing sales growth, or on improving proÖt
3:57:2791:12:12:133:477:503:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:margins (e.g., by lowering unit costs), but given limits on managerial time and
3:58:2870:12:12:133:477:491:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:other resources, doing more on one dimension necessarily implies doing less on
3:59:2948:12:12:133:477:479:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the other. In other words, the choice of whether to emphasize growth or margins
3:60:3027:12:12:133:477:467:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:is essentially a multi-tasking problem of the sort envisioned by, e.g., Holmstrom
3:61:3108:12:12:133:223:455:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:and Milgrom (1991).
3:62:3127:12:12:148:477:443:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:In this paper, we study the implications of this multi-tasking problem for
3:63:3201:12:12:133:477:431:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the dynamics of Örm behavior.  We are particularly interested in the interplay
3:64:3279:12:12:133:477:419:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:between Örmsístrategies and the way that the stock market goes about eval-
3:65:3353:12:12:133:477:407:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:uating them.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that, just as a Örm can change its
3:66:3429:12:12:133:477:395:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:strategic orientation over time, so too can investors shift the emphasis that they
3:67:3511:12:12:133:477:383:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:place on various performance measures.  In the speciÖc case of Amazon.com,
3:68:3585:12:12:133:477:371:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Hong and Stein (2004) provide a detailed reading of equity analystsíreports, and
3:69:3665:12:12:133:477:359:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:document that, during the period that Bezos calls the growth phase (roughly
3:70:3740:12:11:133:477:347:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:through the end of 1999), analysts were almost uniformly focused on growth-
3:71:3815:11:12:133:477:336:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:related metrics in valuing Amazon stock, to the virtual exclusion of proÖtability
3:72:3896:12:12:133:477:324:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:or cost-related metrics.1Conversely, during the cost-cutting phase that followed,
3:73:3977:12:12:133:477:312:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:analysts began to pay much more attention to per-unit measures of costs and
3:74:4052:12:12:133:167:300:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f4:B:proÖts.2
3:75:4060:12:12:148:477:288:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:One interpretation of the Amazon story is that managers actively cater to
3:76:4133:12:12:133:477:276:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the stock marketís preferences in choosing their strategies.  That is, when the
3:77:4212:12:12:133:477:264:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:market is more interested in growth than proÖt margins, managers like Bezos
3:78:4287:12:12:133:477:252:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:give the market what it wants, by focusing their e§orts on delivering increased
3:79:4366:12:12:133:477:240:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:revenue growth.  And when the market changes to being more interested in
3:80:4438:12:12:133:477:228:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:margins, managers take the cue and adapt their strategies accordingly.  Cer-
3:81:4514:12:12:133:477:216:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:tainly, if one thinks of the marketís valuation model as exogenously given, it
3:82:4592:12:12:133:477:204:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:would seem to make sense for a manager interested in maximizing her Örmís
3:83:4665:12:14:133:319:192:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:current stock price to cater in this fashion.
3:84:4710:14:12:144:477:178:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:1For example, in a February 1999 report lauding Amazonís growth prospects, Scott Ehrens
3:85:4797:12:9:133:477:166:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:of Bear Stearns writes that: ìIn traditional o§-line retail, the gross margin is a very important
3:86:4894:9:7:133:357:157:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:metric to watch...This is not the case in the on-line world..î
3:87:4956:7:12:144:477:150:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:2In a March 2001 report on Amazon, Holly Becker of Lehman Brothers argues: ìIt is now
3:88:5041:12:10:133:476:138:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:clear that higher customer churn rates, weak shipping margins and equally high marketing
3:89:5129:10:9:133:477:128:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:spend will o§set many of the companyís virtues...we recommend investors stay on the side-
3:90:5218:9:0:133:379:119:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:lines...Clearly, the company will need to increase gross margins...î
4:91:5287:0:12:151:477:657:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Alternatively, one might read the Amazon story as saying that Örmsístrate-
4:92:5361:12:12:133:477:645:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:gies drive the marketís valuation model, not the other way around. And again,
4:93:5438:12:12:133:477:633:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:it would seem perfectly rational for investors to pay more attention to a Örmís
4:94:5517:12:12:133:477:621:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:growth numbers if they know that management is devoting most of its e§ort to
4:95:5593:12:12:133:218:609:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f4:B:generating growth.3
4:96:5612:12:12:148:477:597:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:We take the view that the causality runs in both directions.  In our model,
4:97:5687:12:12:133:477:585:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:managers interested in their stock prices do indeed cater to the market, but at
4:98:5766:12:12:133:477:573:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the same time, the marketís valuation model rationally takes into consideration
4:99:5845:12:12:133:477:561:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:what it perceives to be a Örmís current business strategy. This two-way feedback
4:100:5925:12:12:133:477:549:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:can produce a variety of interesting e§ects.  Perhaps most notably, it can lead
4:101:6004:12:12:133:477:537:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:to autonomous áuctuations in output growth, even absent any external source
4:102:6079:12:12:133:175:525:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:of shocks.
4:103:6089:12:12:148:477:513:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:The Örst step in understanding how these áuctuations arise is to note that
4:104:6163:12:12:133:477:501:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:in a static setting, the two-way feedback can generate multiple equilibria when
4:105:6242:12:12:133:477:489:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:parameter values are in an ìintermediateî range such that neither a growth-
4:106:6317:12:12:133:477:477:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:oriented nor a margins-oriented strategy represents too extreme a deviation
4:107:6392:12:12:133:477:465:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:from Örst-best e¢ ciency.  For example, if the market conjectures that the Örm
4:108:6470:12:11:133:477:453:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:is pursuing a growth strategy, its valuation will tend to put more weight on
4:109:6546:11:12:133:477:442:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:realized growth, which will in turn encourage the manager to stick with the
4:110:6621:12:12:133:477:430:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:growth strategy, so long as this is not too ine¢ cient.   On the other hand,
4:111:6697:12:12:133:477:418:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:if the market conjectures that the Örm is pursuing a cost-cutting strategy, its
4:112:6776:12:12:133:477:406:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:valuation will tend to emphasize margins, which will reward the manager for
4:113:6851:12:12:133:299:394:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:staying with the cost-cutting strategy.
4:114:6890:12:12:148:477:382:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Now consider the dynamics. Imagine a Örm that starts out endowed with
4:115:6959:12:12:133:477:370:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:such attractive growth prospects that, irrespective of the marketís conjecture,
4:116:7038:12:12:133:477:358:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the optimal choice is for it to pursue a growth strategy.  This puts us initially
4:117:7119:12:12:133:477:346:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:in the growth equilibrium, in which the market price is especially sensitive to
4:118:7198:12:12:133:477:334:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:performance on the growth dimension.  Now over time, as it penetrates the
4:119:7271:12:12:133:477:322:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:market more fully, the Örm will begin to Önd the growth strategy less attractive.
4:120:7352:12:12:133:477:310:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:More speciÖcally, it will eventually reach a point where, if it were only interested
4:121:7436:12:12:133:477:298:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:in choosing the Örst-best action, it would start shifting resources away from the
4:122:7517:12:12:133:477:286:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:growth strategy, and toward the margins strategy. But here is where things get
4:123:7595:12:12:133:477:274:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:di¢ cult.  For as long as the market continues to value it as a growth Örm, any
4:124:7674:12:12:133:477:262:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:change in strategy will lead it to disappoint the market on the growth dimension,
4:125:7755:12:12:133:477:250:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:thereby damaging its stock price.  Thus if it cares about pleasing the market,
4:126:7833:12:12:133:477:238:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the Örm will be trapped into continuing with the growth strategy longer than
4:127:7909:12:12:133:396:226:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:is optimal, instead of attending to cost-cutting, as it should.
4:128:7972:12:12:148:477:214:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Eventually, the market will become so saturated, and the growth strategy so
4:129:8047:12:12:133:477:202:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:ine¢ cient, that the Örm will have no choice but to switch to a margins strategy.
4:130:8128:12:11:133:477:190:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:However, relative to the Örst-best, this shift will not only come too late, it will
4:131:8211:11:12:133:477:179:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:be too abrupt.  Much like Bezosídescription of Amazon post-1999, the Örm
4:132:8283:12:15:133:477:167:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:will go to the other extreme of focusing exclusively on cost-cutting, as opposed
4:133:8363:15:12:144:477:152:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:3As Dewatripont, Jewitt and Tirole (1999) argue, and as we develop in more detail be-
4:134:8448:12:10:133:477:140:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:low, this is a natural feature of the sort of learning model introduced by Holmstrom (1999).
4:135:8540:10:9:133:476:130:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:Intuitively, investors can learn more about a managerís general ability by looking at those
4:136:8631:9:0:133:384:121:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:performance measures that she is most actively trying to maximize.
5:137:8698:0:12:133:477:657:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:to taking a balanced approach of devoting some resources to each of the two
5:138:8773:12:12:133:477:645:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:strategies.  This lack of balance in turn sets the stage for another round of
5:139:8850:12:12:133:477:633:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:áuctuations.  Once entrenched in the margins equilibrium, with the market
5:140:8923:12:12:133:477:621:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:now expecting strong performance on the margins dimension, the Örm will for
5:141:8998:12:12:133:477:609:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:too long pay insu¢ cient attention to growth opportunities, and will eventually
5:142:9077:12:12:133:477:597:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:get to a point where it is forced to go back to the growth strategy, at which
5:143:9154:12:12:133:296:585:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:point the whole process begins again.
5:144:9191:12:12:148:477:573:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:The bottom line is that unlike in the Örst bestñwhere the Örm responds
5:145:9261:12:12:133:477:561:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:to a smooth decline in its growth prospects by gradually and monotonically
5:146:9335:12:12:133:479:549:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:shifting resources away from a growth strategy and towards a margins strategyñ
5:147:9413:12:12:133:477:537:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:adjustment in a world where managers cater to the market involves a series of
5:148:9490:12:12:133:477:525:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:sharp oscillations.  The Örm may go from an all-growth strategy, to an all-
5:149:9565:12:12:133:477:513:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:margins strategy, then back again to an all-growth strategy, before eventually
5:150:9643:12:12:133:477:501:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:settling down.   Central to this result is the premise that managers care to
5:151:9719:12:12:133:477:489:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:some degree about maximizing their current stock price, as opposed to just the
5:152:9797:12:12:133:477:477:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:present value of future casháows. Indeed, the more intensely a manager cares
5:153:9873:12:12:133:477:465:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:about the current stock price, the more dramatic are the associated áuctuations.
5:154:9953:12:11:148:477:453:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:The idea that the stock market can lead to excessive volatility in investment
5:155:10030:11:12:133:477:442:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:and output is a venerable one, going back at least to Keynes (1936).  More
5:156:10104:12:12:133:477:430:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:recent treatments of this idea have tended to emphasize the role of irrational
5:157:10182:12:12:133:477:418:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:noise traders, who create exogenous deviations of stock prices from fundamen-
5:158:10259:12:12:133:477:406:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:tals.  The question then typically asked is to what extent these mispricings
5:159:10335:12:12:133:477:394:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:ináuence corporate investment, either at the micro or macro level.4Our ap-
5:160:10409:12:12:133:477:382:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:proach in this paper is quite di§erent.  In most of our analysis, we model the
5:161:10487:12:12:133:476:370:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f4:B:market as fully rational, albeit imperfectly informed about managerial ability.5
5:162:10567:12:12:133:477:358:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Moreover, beyond this uncertainty about ability, we introduce no further exoge-
5:163:10646:12:12:133:477:346:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:nous sources of variationñi.e., there is no analog in our setting to noise-trader-
5:164:10728:12:12:133:477:334:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:induced sentiment shocks.  Thus the real-side volatility in our model is driven
5:165:10807:12:12:133:477:322:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:by intrinsic forces, and changes over time in the marketís approach to valuation
5:166:10887:12:12:133:477:310:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:are completely endogenized.  As we argue in detail below, this leads to a novel
5:167:10966:12:12:133:258:298:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:set of empirical implications.
5:168:10996:12:12:148:477:286:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.  In Section 2, we in-
5:169:11069:12:12:133:477:274:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:troduce a static version of our model.  This static version leaves a lot out; in
5:170:11149:12:12:133:477:262:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:particular, it takes the demand for a Örmís products to be exogenous. However,
5:171:11227:12:12:133:477:250:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:it helps to develop the basic intuition for how multiple equilibria can arise in
5:172:11307:12:12:133:477:238:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:our setting.  In Section 3, we study dynamics.  In so doing, we endogenize
5:173:11381:12:12:133:477:226:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the demand curve facing the Örm at any point in time, via a market saturation
5:174:11458:12:12:133:477:214:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:mechanism of the sort alluded to aboveñi.e., when the Örm plays the growth
5:175:11532:12:14:133:477:202:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:strategy for several periods in a row, this reduces the stock of unsatiated cus-

6:188:12366:30:12:133:477:546:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:To build intuition and lay the groundwork for our dynamic model, we begin
6:189:12439:12:12:133:477:534:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:with a very simple static setup.   We consider a Örm that produces for two
6:190:12513:12:11:133:477:522:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:periods. In the Örst period, the Örmís manager must decide how to allocate
6:191:12587:11:12:133:477:511:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:her e§ort between two business strategies: (i) a ìgrowthîstrategy of expanding
6:192:12665:12:12:133:477:499:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:production and sales; and (ii) a ìmarginsî strategy of maintaining sales while
6:193:12743:12:12:133:477:487:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:improving proÖt margins (say by reducing unit costs). Following Holmstrom
6:194:12816:12:12:133:477:475:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:(1999), we assume that the managerís ability is initially unknown to both the
6:195:12893:12:12:133:477:463:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:manager herself and the market. However, it is inferred by the market at the
6:196:12969:12:12:133:477:451:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:end of the Örst period, based on the Örmís performance at this time. Managerial
6:197:13048:12:12:133:477:439:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:ability is captured by a parameterawhich is normally distributed with mean
6:198:13122:12:12:133:215:427:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:C:Aand varianceva:
6:199:13138:12:12:148:477:415:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:The Örmís Örst-period proÖt is the sum of two components, a sales-volume

6:203:13339:12:11:133:216:348:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:allocation of e§ort.
6:204:13359:11:12:148:477:337:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:The manager is endowed with one unit of e§ort, a fractioneof which is
6:205:13428:12:12:133:477:325:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:devoted to the growth strategy of increasings0and the remaining(1-e)of
6:206:13498:12:12:133:477:313:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:which is devoted to improving marginsm0.  The manager chooses e§ort so
6:207:13568:12:12:133:477:301:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:as to maximize her expected utilityU;which we take to be equal to a linear
6:208:13642:12:22:133:384:289:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f4:B:combination of current proÖts and the Örmís stock price:7

6:210:13714:21:12:133:476:246:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:where the stock priceP0is equivalent to the marketís discounted expectation of
6:211:13792:12:12:133:477:234:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:future (i.e., second-period) proÖts as of the end of the Örst period. As will be-
6:212:13873:12:12:133:477:222:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:come clear shortly, this expectation will depend in part on the marketís updated
6:213:13953:12:12:133:275:210:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:assessment of managerial ability.
6:214:13986:12:12:148:477:198:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:We assume the following technologies for generating Örst-period sales and
6:215:14059:12:12:133:224:186:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:margins respectively:

6:217:14094:15:12:144:477:159:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:6Naturally, it would be more realistic to write proÖts as the product of sales and a proÖt
6:218:14184:12:9:133:476:147:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:margin, rather than as the sum.   While such a multiplicative formulation is a bit more
6:219:14271:9:7:133:438:138:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:cumbersome than our additive simpliÖcation, it leads to all the same basic results.
6:220:14354:7:12:144:477:131:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:7This sort of managerial utility function appears in a number of previous papers, including,

7:231:15033:12:12:133:477:546:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:ability and e§ort are complements when it comes to improving either aspect
7:232:15107:12:12:133:477:534:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:of performance.   As emphasized by Dewatripont, Jewitt and Tirole (1999),
7:233:15180:12:12:133:477:522:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:this implies that one learns more about an agentís ability by looking at her
7:234:15256:12:12:133:477:510:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:performance on the dimension on which she is working the hardest.8Second,
7:235:15329:12:12:133:477:498:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:there is an asymmetry across the two tasks: both managerial e§ort and ability
7:236:15406:12:12:133:477:486:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:have a higher marginal product in terms of increasing sales when the size of the
7:237:15486:12:12:133:477:474:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:marketq0is larger, but their impact on margins is independent of market size.
7:238:15563:12:12:133:477:462:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:This means that, insofar as the manager is interested in maximizing current
7:239:15638:12:12:133:477:450:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:proÖts, she will be more inclined to devote her e§orts to the growth strategy
7:240:15715:12:12:133:213:438:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:whenq0increases.
7:241:15731:12:18:148:446:426:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:In the second period, we assume that the Örmís proÖts are given by:
7:242:15798:18:18:260:477:408:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:A:-1=a+-("s+"m);(5)
7:243:15815:18:12:133:476:390:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:where-2(0;1)measures the persistence of the sales and margin shocks over
7:244:15887:12:12:133:477:378:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:time.  Thus not only do the sales and margins shocks partially carry over from
7:245:15965:12:12:133:477:366:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:one period to the next, but the Örm is also better o§ in the second period, all
7:246:16044:12:11:133:313:354:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:else equal, with a higher-ability manager.
7:247:16086:11:12:148:477:343:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:The timing of actions within the Örst period is as follows. First, the manager
7:248:16164:12:12:133:477:331:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:chooses an allocation of e§ort. Second, sales and margins are realized and pub-
7:249:16243:12:12:133:477:319:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:licly observed. Third, the market updates its forecast of second-period proÖts,
7:250:16322:12:12:133:477:307:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:based on the observed values of sales and margins, and its prior conjecture as to
7:251:16403:12:12:133:477:295:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:how the manager allocates e§ort. This in turn determines the Örst-period stock
7:252:16481:12:12:133:477:283:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:priceP0.  Recall that the stock price is simply the discounted expectation of
7:253:16558:12:18:133:313:271:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:second-period proÖts, which implies that:
7:254:16599:18:18:255:477:253:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:A:P0=-E(-1js0; m0; e-);(6)
7:255:16623:18:12:133:477:235:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:wheree-is the allocation of managerial e§ort that the market conjectures, and
7:256:16700:12:39:133:439:223:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:B:-is the marketís discount factor between the Örst and second periods.
7:257:16769:39:18:133:221:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:C:2.2  First best
7:258:16784:18:12:133:477:166:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:The natural benchmark is the case in which the manager has no incentive to
7:259:16858:12:14:133:477:154:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:distort her e§ort allocation in order to impress the market.  This case arises
7:260:16936:14:12:144:477:140:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:8To take a canonical example: a high-school studentís inability to speak French can only say
7:261:17028:12:9:133:477:128:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:something negative about her broader capabilities if she has been enrolled in French classes;
7:262:17121:9:0:133:388:119:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:if she has been studying Spanish instead, no inference can be drawn.
8:263:17190:0:12:133:477:657:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:when either the managerís abilityais public information ex ante (i.e., when
8:264:17265:12:12:133:477:645:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:B:va= 0), or when the manager does not care about the stock price (i.e., when
8:265:17340:12:12:133:477:633:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:B:-= 0). If either of these conditions holds, the manager will simply chooseeso
8:266:17417:12:22:133:326:621:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:as to maximize expected Örst-period proÖts:
8:267:17460:22:25:237:477:599:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f4:A:maxefE(-0) =aeq0+a(1-e)g:(7)
8:268:17488:25:12:133:477:574:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:It then immediately follows that the static Örst-best is to sete= 1(i.e., to
8:269:17564:12:12:133:477:562:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:pursue a growth strategy) ifq0>1and to sete= 0(i.e., to pursue a margins
8:270:17636:12:12:133:477:550:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:strategy) ifq0<1.  Again, the intuition for this result is that the marginal
8:271:17712:12:12:133:477:538:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:return on e§ort devoted to the growth strategy is greater when the size of the
8:272:17790:12:28:133:217:526:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:marketq0is larger.
8:273:17808:28:19:133:454:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:C:2.3  The interaction between the Örm and the market
8:274:17859:19:11:133:477:479:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:To solve the model in the more general case in which the manager does try
8:275:17932:11:12:133:477:468:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:to ináuence the marketís perceptions, we proceed as follows.   We begin by
8:276:18006:12:12:133:477:456:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:endowing the market with a particular conjecture about managerial actions (e.g.,
8:277:18086:12:12:133:477:444:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the market might conjecture that the manager is pursuing a growth strategy).
8:278:18162:12:12:133:477:432:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Given this conjecture, we can solve for market prices as a function of the Örmís
8:279:18242:12:12:133:477:420:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:observed performance on the growth and margins dimensions.  Then we take
8:280:18314:12:12:133:477:408:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the managerís perspective and ask what strategy she will prefer to follow, in
8:281:18391:12:12:133:477:396:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:light of the market pricing rule.  In a rational expectations equilibrium, the
8:282:18469:12:12:133:477:384:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:managerís optimal strategy coincides with the marketís conjecture.  In other
8:283:18545:12:12:133:477:372:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:words, an equilibrium is a pair(e; e-)such that: (i) anticipating the market

8:287:18747:18:12:133:477:304:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Suppose Örst that the market conjectures that the Örm is pursuing a growth
8:288:18821:12:12:133:477:292:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:B:strategy (e-= 1).  Then, based on the observed realizations ofs0andm0;
8:289:18891:12:22:133:452:280:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Bayesian updating leads to the following pricing rule for the Örmís stock:
8:290:18965:22:15:215:477:258:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:A:Pg0=-E(-1js0; m0; e-= 1)(8)
8:291:18992:15:22:238:395:243:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f5:A:=-(A+\fsg(s0-Aq0) +\fmgm0);
8:292:19019:22:12:133:477:221:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:where, using the fact that the two variabless0andm0are uncorrelated, we have
8:293:19095:12:22:133:154:209:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:that:
8:294:19100:22:0:149:397:187:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:A:\fsg=cov(-1; s0je-= 1)=var(s0je-= 1) = (q0va+-vs)=

8:299:19163:22:12:133:149:165:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:and
8:300:19166:12:18:201:477:153:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:A:\fmg=cov(-1; m0je-= 1)=var(m0je-= 1) =-:(10)
8:301:19210:18:12:148:477:135:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Similarly, suppose that the market conjectures that the Örm is pursuing a
8:302:19283:12:0:133:477:123:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:margins strategy (e-= 0).  Then, based on the observed realizations ofs0and
9:303:19359:0:22:133:386:657:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:B:m0;Bayesian updating leads to the following pricing rule:
9:304:19416:22:15:215:477:635:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:A:Pm0=-E(-1js0; m0; e-= 0)(11)
9:305:19444:15:22:241:395:620:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f5:A:=-(A+\fsms0+\fmm(m0-A));
9:306:19468:22:12:133:158:598:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:where
9:307:19473:12:18:206:477:586:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:A:\fsm=cov(-1; s0je-= 0)=var(s0je-= 0) =-(12)
9:308:19516:18:22:133:149:568:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:and
9:309:19519:22:22:144:477:546:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:A:\fmm=cov(-1; m0je-= 0)=var(m0je-= 0) = (va+-vm)=(va+vm):(13)
9:310:19579:22:12:148:477:524:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:A couple of features of these pricing rules should be emphasized.  First, we
9:311:19655:12:12:133:477:512:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:have that\fmm> \fsm.  In other words, when the market thinks the manager
9:312:19727:12:12:133:477:500:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:is playing the margins strategy, it puts more weight on margins than on sales.
9:313:19805:12:12:133:477:488:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:This makes intuitive sense: when the manager is actively trying to improve
9:314:19879:12:12:133:477:476:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:margins, the realization ofm0is more informative about her ability, and hence
9:315:19956:12:11:133:477:464:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:about future proÖts, than is the realization ofs0.  Second, if-q0<1;(which
9:316:20030:11:12:133:477:453:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:will always be satisÖed in a neighborhood aroundq0= 1, given that- <1), then
9:317:20106:12:12:133:477:441:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:B:\fsg> \fmg, which means that when the market thinks the manager is playing
9:318:20180:12:12:133:477:429:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the growth strategy, it puts more weight on sales than on margins.   These
9:319:20254:12:12:133:477:417:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:inequalities suggest the possibility of multiple equilibria, in which the manager
9:320:20335:12:12:133:477:405:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:may cater to the marketís beliefs.  For example, if the market believes that
9:321:20411:12:12:133:477:393:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the manager is playing a margins strategy, the pricing rule will tend to reward
9:322:20490:12:12:133:477:381:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:strong performance on the margins dimension more, which will, all else equal,
9:323:20567:12:26:133:392:369:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:make the margins strategy more attractive to the manager.
9:324:20624:26:18:133:350:343:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:C:2.3.2  The potential for multiple equilibria
9:325:20668:18:12:133:477:325:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:We are now ready to construct the equilibria of the game between the manager
9:326:20744:12:12:133:477:313:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:and the market.   This involves postulating a market conjecture,e-2f0;1g;
9:327:20817:12:12:133:477:301:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:then, using the updating rules derived above, computing the expected payo§ to
9:328:20894:12:12:133:477:289:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the manager under alternative e§ort allocations; and from there deriving the
9:329:20970:12:12:133:477:277:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:necessary and su¢ cient conditions under whiche=e-is indeed the optimal
9:330:21041:12:12:133:265:265:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:strategy for the Örm manager.
9:331:21070:12:12:148:477:253:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Suppose Örst that the market conjectures that the manager is following the
9:332:21144:12:12:133:477:241:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:growth strategye-= 1. Then, if the manager chooses to be consistent with the
9:333:21220:12:12:133:477:229:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:market conjecture by in fact pursuing the growth strategy (e= 1), her expected
9:334:21298:12:22:133:356:217:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:sales, proÖts and margins are respectively equal to:
9:335:21350:22:22:192:477:195:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:A:E(s0je= 1) =Aq0=E(-0je= 1);E(m0je= 1) = 0;(14)
9:336:21396:22:12:133:477:173:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Therefore, from our analysis in the previous subsection, her expectation of the
9:337:21475:12:22:133:272:161:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:resulting stock price is equal to:
9:338:21509:22:0:143:477:139:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:A:E(Pg0je= 1) =-(A+\fsgE(s0-Aq0je= 1) +\fmgE(m0je= 1)) =-A:(15)

10:340:21645:12:21:133:338:645:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:manager obtains a total utility payo§ equal to:

10:342:21721:21:12:148:477:603:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Now, if the manager instead chooses to go against the market conjecture by

10:346:21918:17:21:133:391:550:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:and her expectation of the resulting stock price is equal to:

10:349:22056:21:12:133:477:493:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Thus, by choosing a margins strategy in the face of a growth conjecture, the

10:356:22524:12:12:133:477:391:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:price, while the latter translates into a gain. Overall, the manager will choose
10:357:22604:12:21:133:400:379:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:to fulÖll the marketís conjecture by choosinge= 1whenever:

10:368:23079:27:12:133:477:235:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Using this fact, one can show thatq-is a decreasing function of both ability-

10:371:23314:11:12:133:477:200:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:one. That is, we converge to the Örst-best situation, where the growth strategy

10:373:23415:12:12:148:477:176:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Applying similar reasoning, we can derive the conditions under which the
10:374:23487:12:12:133:477:164:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:margins strategy is an equilibrium. Suppose the market conjectures that the

11:378:23747:0:12:148:477:657:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:On the other hand, if the manager deviates from the market conjecture and

11:398:24605:12:20:148:477:350:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Our analysis of the static model is summarized in the following proposition:
11:399:24681:20:12:133:477:330:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f12:F:Proposition 1Suppose that-and-aare both strictly positive. Then, there
11:400:24751:12:12:133:477:318:10:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f12:F:exist two cut-o§ valuesq-andq+such that: (i)q+>1> q-;(ii) ifq0< q-,
11:401:24818:12:12:133:477:306:10:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f12:F:the unique equilibrium is that the Örm plays the margins strategy (e= 0); (iii)
11:402:24897:12:12:133:477:294:10:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f12:F:ifq0> q+, the unique equilibrium is that the Örm plays the growth strategy
11:403:24971:12:12:133:477:282:10:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f12:F:(e= 1); (iv) ifq--q0-q+, there are two equilibria, one where the Örm plays
11:404:25045:12:12:133:477:270:10:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f12:F:margins and the other where the Örm plays growth. The size of this multiple-
11:405:25121:12:11:133:477:258:10:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f12:F:equilibrium region increases with-or-a;but it vanishes as-or-aconverge
11:406:25191:11:21:133:419:247:10:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f12:C:to zero, in which case the Örm always plays the Örst-best strategy.
11:407:25258:21:12:148:477:226:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Again, the economic intuition behind the proposition is one of managers
11:408:25329:12:12:133:477:214:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:catering to the stock marketís beliefs.  If the market perceives that a Örm is
11:409:25407:12:12:133:477:202:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:trying hard to generate sales growth, it will tend to react more strongly to news
11:410:25488:12:11:133:477:190:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:about growth, because such news is more informative about managerial ability.
11:411:25565:11:12:133:477:179:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:In contrast, if the market thinks that the Örm is focusing its e§orts on improving
11:412:25647:12:12:133:477:167:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:margins, it will tend to react more strongly to news about proÖtability. In either
11:413:25729:12:12:133:477:155:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:case, a manager who is concerned about stock prices will tend to give the market
11:414:25809:12:12:133:477:143:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:what it is looking for, which creates the scope for multiple equilibria.  And the
11:415:25890:12:12:133:477:131:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:more intense the managerís concern with stock prices, the wider the range of
11:416:25966:12:0:133:347:119:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:parameters under which multiple equilibria arise.
12:417:26016:0:33:133:227:657:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:C:3  Dynamics
12:418:26027:33:12:133:477:624:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:In the static analysis, we took the market sizeq0to be exogenously Öxed. Now
12:419:26103:12:12:133:479:612:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:we consider the case whereqvaries endogenously over time, in response to Örmsí
12:420:26181:12:12:133:477:600:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:past strategic choices.  In particular, we assume that the longer a Örm pursues
12:421:26260:12:12:133:477:588:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:a growth strategy, the more it exhausts the potential pool of customers for its
12:422:26339:12:12:133:477:576:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:products, and hence the lower is demand going forward. This formulation yields
12:423:26417:12:12:133:477:564:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:a system with its own internal dynamics, and allows us to ask, e.g., how the
12:424:26493:12:28:133:456:552:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:volatility of sales growth depends on the various parameters of the model.

12:426:26595:18:12:133:477:506:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Imagine an inÖnite-horizon economy in which, at each datet,qtdenotes the

12:428:26737:12:12:133:477:482:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:identical Örms. This demand comes from a unit mass of consumers with unÖlled
12:429:26813:12:12:133:477:470:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:orders.  Every period, a fraction\rof these consumers die, and are replaced

12:431:26961:12:12:133:477:446:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:to di§erent dynamic equations forqtdepending upon whether Örm managers
12:432:27031:12:12:133:477:434:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:choose a growth versus a margins strategy. More speciÖcally, the dynamics of
12:433:27107:12:12:133:330:422:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:unÖlled ordersqtcan be described as follows.
12:434:27151:12:12:148:477:410:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:In the growth regime, there are per-Örm sales ofAqt, leaving unÖlled or-

12:437:27368:12:12:133:477:374:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f4:B:(1-\r) (1-A)qt. In addition, a fraction\rof new consumers are born, with
12:438:27440:12:21:133:417:362:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:orders ofQt. So if the growth regime prevails at timet, we have:
12:439:27504:21:21:236:477:341:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:A:qt+1= (1-\r) (1-A)qt+\rQt:(28)
12:440:27534:21:12:148:477:320:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:In the margins regime, everything is the same, except that per-Örm sales at
12:441:27609:12:21:133:423:308:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:timetare0.  So if the margins regime prevails at timet, we have:
12:442:27673:21:21:253:477:287:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:A:qt+1= (1-\r)qt+\rQt:(29)
12:443:27697:21:12:148:476:266:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f6:A:More generally, if managers choose to allocate an interior level of e§ortet
12:444:27772:12:12:133:477:254:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:to the growth strategyñso that we are in neither the pure growth nor the pure
12:445:27849:12:24:133:242:242:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:margins regimeñwe have:
12:446:27872:24:18:234:477:218:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:A:qt+1= (1-\r)(1-Aet)qt+\rQt:(30)

12:448:27980:12:12:133:477:188:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the next. Again, the key point to note is that if we are in the growth regime at
12:449:28060:12:12:133:477:176:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:timet, this leads to lower demand at timet+ 1, since the representative Örm
12:450:28135:12:14:133:456:164:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:produces more and hence satisÖes a greater fraction of the unÖlled orders.
12:451:28209:14:12:144:477:150:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:9We assume that there are many identical Örms selling to the same pool of customers,
12:452:28293:12:10:133:476:138:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:so that we can ignore the e§ect of Örm-level shocks to sales and managerial ability on the
12:453:28383:10:9:133:477:128:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:aggregate dynamics of unÖlled orders. In other words, these Örm-level shocks wash out across
12:454:28475:9:0:133:249:119:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:the many Örms in the industry.

13:472:29212:12:12:133:477:448:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:corresponds to the reasonable idea that a better manager leaves a Örm in better

13:491:30293:12:12:133:477:159:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:particular, the market can now make forecasts based on ìadjusted valuesî of

14:497:30692:12:12:148:477:633:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:The timing of events can be described as follows.  First, at the beginning

14:516:31951:18:12:133:477:384:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Before proceeding, we consider the Örst-best benchmark in two cases.  In the

14:522:32311:12:12:133:477:292:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:B:the market. Now, we know from our analysis of the static model that when-
14:523:32384:12:12:133:477:280:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:or-aare equal to zero, managers will be indi§erent between the growth and

14:525:32530:12:12:133:477:256:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f8:B:question is whether we can sustain a steady-state equilibrium in whichqt= 1

15:558:34106:12:12:133:477:458:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:even under the pure growth strategy, the Örm cannot keep up with demand, and
15:559:34182:12:12:133:477:446:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:unÖlled orders asymptote toqt=\rQ=(\r+ (1-\r)A)>1.  Similarly, ifQ <1,
15:560:34252:12:12:133:477:434:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:so that the right-hand size of (39) is negative, the Örm plays the pure margins
15:561:34331:12:26:133:330:422:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:strategy, and unÖlled orders asymptote toQ.

15:563:34415:30:12:133:477:366:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:It is straightforward to extend the above reasoning to the case whereQtdeclines
15:564:34494:12:13:133:477:354:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:monotonically.  Consider the natural analog to (39) with a time-varying e§ort
15:565:34571:13:13:133:146:341:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:B:eft:
15:566:34575:13:18:246:477:328:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:A:eft=\r(Qt-1)=((1-\r)A):(40)
15:567:34602:18:11:133:477:310:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:If we start out with a value ofQtsuch that the right-hand side of (40) exceeds
15:568:34680:11:12:133:477:299:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:one, the Örm is initially at a corner solution, and plays the all-growth strategy
15:569:34761:12:12:133:477:287:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:in whicheft= 1.  Over time, asQtfalls, the right-hand side of (40) drops
15:570:34833:12:12:133:477:275:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:below one, at which point we have an interior solution with the level of e§ort
15:571:34911:12:13:133:477:263:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:devoted to growth,eft, given by (40).  From this point on, the equation tells us
15:572:34991:13:14:133:477:250:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:that further declines inQtlead to matching declines ineft.  Eventually, when
15:573:35067:14:12:133:477:236:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:B:Qtdrops below one, we hit the other corner, whereeft= 0, and the Örm plays
15:574:35141:12:11:133:477:224:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the all-margins strategy.  The important point here is that if demand shrinks
15:575:35218:11:12:133:477:213:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:monotonically, so must the e§ort devoted to the growth strategy.  As we will
15:576:35294:12:12:133:477:201:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:demonstrate below, this need no longer be the case when managers care about
15:577:35369:12:28:133:187:189:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:stock prices.
15:578:35382:28:30:133:474:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:F:3.4  Excess volatility when managers cater to the market
15:579:35438:30:12:133:477:131:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:We now reintroduce a managerial concern with stock prices, and show that this
15:580:35515:12:0:133:477:119:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:can lead to endogenous volatility in sales growth. Our reasoning proceeds in two
16:581:35597:0:12:133:477:657:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:steps. First, we consider a given periodtand show that Proposition 1 continues
16:582:35675:12:12:133:476:645:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:to hold.  That is, for the same cut-o§ valuesq-andq+as in the static case:
16:583:35749:12:12:133:477:633:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:(i) the unique equilibrium is that Örms choose the growth strategy whenever
16:584:35824:12:12:133:477:621:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:B:qt> q+;(ii) the unique equilibrium is that Örms choose the margins strategy
16:585:35899:12:12:133:427:609:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:wheneverqt< q-;(iii) forq-< qt< q+;the two equilibria coexist.
16:586:35961:12:12:148:477:597:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Second, we consider the dynamics ofqtand the resulting managerial deci-
16:587:36032:12:12:133:477:585:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:sions over time. To do so, we assume that in a dynamic equilibrium the market
16:588:36109:12:12:133:477:573:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:maintains the same conjecture as in the previous period whenever there con-
16:589:36184:12:12:133:477:561:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:tinues to exist a static equilibrium with that conjecture. Thus, for example,
16:590:36261:12:12:133:477:549:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:ifqtenters the multiple-equilibrium region(q-; q+)from aboveñthat is, com-
16:591:36335:12:12:133:477:537:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:ing from the regionqt> q+where the growth strategy is the unique static
16:592:36406:12:12:133:477:525:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:equilibriumñthen as long asqtremains in that region, the Örm and the market
16:593:36481:12:12:133:477:513:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:keep playing the growth equilibrium.  Or said di§erently, whenever there is a
16:594:36558:12:26:133:413:501:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:choice of equilibria, we select the one played in the prior period.
16:595:36625:26:18:133:282:475:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:C:3.4.1  Within-period analysis
16:596:36654:18:12:133:477:457:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:To understand why the same cut-o§ valuesq-andq+obtain as in the static
16:597:36724:12:12:133:477:445:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:model, observe that a Örmís market value as of the end of periodtcan be
16:598:36795:12:12:133:189:433:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:expressed as:
16:599:36808:12:18:210:477:421:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:A:Pt=-E(at+-("st+"mt) + \nt+1jsat; mat; e-t);(41)
16:600:36855:18:12:133:477:403:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:where\nt+1is a function that depends on only those random variables that
16:601:36927:12:12:133:477:391:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:are realized fromt+ 1onwards.  Thus as of periodt, the market makes a
16:602:36996:12:12:133:477:379:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:conjecturee-tabout the Örmís current choice of strategy, and tries to forecast
16:603:37074:12:12:133:477:367:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:B:exactly the same item as in the static model, namely-(at+-("st+"mt)); period-t
16:604:37152:12:12:133:476:355:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f4:B:observations of proÖts, sales and margins are of no help in forecasting\nt+1.11
16:605:37231:12:11:133:477:343:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Moreover, given our previous assumptions on information structure, the market
16:606:37308:11:12:133:477:332:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:has access to the same two predictive variables as before,sat=atetqt+"st, and
16:607:37385:12:12:133:459:320:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:B:mat=at(1-et) +"mt.  So the inference problem is completely unchanged.
16:608:37454:12:12:148:477:308:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Similarly, from the perspective of the period-tmanager, everything is also
16:609:37528:12:12:133:477:296:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the same, since her utility function is the same as in the static model.  Thus
16:610:37606:12:12:133:477:284:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Proposition 1 continues to apply as stated, with the only modiÖcation being
16:611:37681:12:26:133:302:272:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:thatq0is replaced everywhere withqt.

16:613:37766:19:12:133:477:227:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:In order to fully pin down the dynamic evolution ofqtandet, we need to
16:614:37836:12:11:133:477:215:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:specify a mechanism for picking an equilibrium when we are in the parameter
16:615:37911:11:12:133:477:204:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:region(q-; q+)where there are multiple static equilibria. To do so, we make
16:616:37986:12:15:133:244:192:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the following assumption:
16:617:38011:15:12:141:477:177:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:11In addition to future realizations of the random variables,\nt+1also depends on the
16:618:38096:12:10:133:477:165:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:future path of unÖlled ordersqt+1,qt+2, etc., which in turn shape future Örm strategieset+1,
16:619:38188:10:9:133:477:155:8:g_d0_f13:8:g_d0_f4:F:et+2, etc. But as we will show below, these variables evolve completely deterministically in
16:620:38280:9:0:133:177:146:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:equilibrium.
17:621:38294:0:12:148:477:657:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f4:A:Assumption A1:If at datet;for a given value ofqt;there exist (according
17:622:38365:12:12:133:477:645:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:to Proposition 1) multiple static equilibria, the same equilibrium is chosen as in
17:623:38447:12:12:133:220:633:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the previous period.
17:624:38467:12:12:148:477:621:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:As noted above, this assumption can be thought of as introducing an element
17:625:38542:12:12:133:477:609:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:of history-dependence into the equilibrium-selection criterion.12Importantly,
17:626:38619:12:12:133:477:597:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the assumption does not require any departure from Bayesian rationality on
17:627:38693:12:12:133:477:585:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the part of either the market or managers.  Rather, it follows from imposing
17:628:38769:12:12:133:477:573:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:some relatively mild non-common-knowledge structure on the marketís higher-
17:629:38844:12:12:133:477:561:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:order beliefs out of equilibrium. In particular, Assumption A1 would be implied
17:630:38923:12:12:133:477:549:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:by the following higher-order beliefs.  Suppose that the market believes that
17:631:39000:12:12:133:477:537:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:managers believe that the market is inertial in its conjecturesñin other words,
17:632:39079:12:12:133:477:525:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the market believes that managers believe that the market always maintains the
17:633:39157:12:12:133:477:513:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:same conjecture about managersístrategies as in the prior period. And suppose
17:634:39234:12:12:133:477:501:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:further that managers understand that the market has such beliefs about them.
17:635:39311:12:12:133:477:489:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:This will lead both sides to coordinate on the equilibrium-selection criterion we
17:636:39392:12:12:133:477:477:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:have assumed.  Moreover, neither sideís beliefs will ever be contradicted along
17:637:39471:12:25:133:212:465:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f4:B:the path of play.13

17:639:39542:27:12:133:477:413:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:With all the pieces now in place, let us return to the case where the demand

17:643:39833:12:12:133:477:360:10:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f12:F:rium in which managers allocate a positive and time-invariant amount of e§ort
17:644:39910:12:12:133:477:348:10:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f12:F:to both growth and margins, except for possibly on a zero-measure subset of
17:645:39985:12:12:133:477:336:10:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f12:F:parameters; (ii) there exists a subset of parameters with positive measure, for
17:646:40064:12:12:133:477:324:10:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f12:F:which one can construct a cyclical equilibrium.  In this cyclical equilibrium, the
17:647:40146:12:12:133:477:312:10:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f12:F:Örm switches back and forth between the growth and margins regimes at regular
17:648:40223:12:12:133:477:300:10:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f12:F:intervals, and the level of unÖlled ordersqtáuctuates within a range bounded by

17:650:40335:15:9:141:477:273:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:12Rajan (1994) makes an identical assumption in a model with a similar dynamic structure.
17:651:40424:9:13:141:477:264:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:13Several readers have suggested another equilibrium-selection criterion: if at datet, there
17:652:40516:13:9:133:477:251:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:exist multiple equilibria, the incumbent manager simply announces which strategy she in-
17:653:40604:9:10:133:477:242:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:tends to pursue, and the market believes her.   At Örst glance, it might appear that this
17:654:40693:10:9:133:476:232:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:mechanism would allow for an approximately e¢ cient outcome in which the growth strategy
17:655:40781:9:10:133:477:223:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:is played wheneverqt>1, and the margins strategy is played wheneverqt<1.  However,
17:656:40863:10:9:133:477:213:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:this conclusion does not hold if we perturb the model slightly so that the manager has pri-
17:657:40954:9:10:133:477:204:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:vate information about the upcoming realizations of the sales and margins shocks,"stand"mt.
17:658:41045:10:9:133:477:194:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:(This perturbation does not a§ect our results at all if we continue to disregard announcements
17:659:41139:9:9:133:477:185:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:by the manager.)  To see why, suppose that the market believes the managerís announce-
17:660:41225:9:10:133:477:176:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:ments, and that within each equilibrium, the updating rules continue to be given as before.
17:661:41316:10:9:133:477:166:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:Now consider a situation whereqt<1ñso that it is e¢ cient for the manager to announce
17:662:41401:9:10:133:476:157:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:the margins strategyñbut where the manager anticipates a large positive sales shock.  The
17:663:41490:10:9:133:477:147:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:manager will prefer to announce the growth strategy, because she wants to get more credit
17:664:41579:9:10:133:476:138:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:for a strong showing on the sales dimension.  Thus e¢ cient equilibrium selection is not in

18:667:41851:0:12:148:477:657:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f4:A:Proof:Part (i) of Proposition 2 is proven in the appendix.  Here, we just
18:668:41924:12:12:133:477:645:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:establish part (ii); this part of the proof is briefer and captures most of the
18:669:42003:12:12:133:477:633:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:important intuition.  Letqgandqmdenote the Öxed points of the dynamic
18:670:42072:12:12:133:477:621:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:equations (28) and (29), i.e., the steady-state values ofqtin the all-growth and
18:671:42152:12:36:133:408:609:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:all-margins regimes, respectively.  We have already noted that:
18:672:42215:36:18:252:477:573:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:A:qg=\rQ=(\r+ (1-\r)A)(42)
18:673:42239:18:12:133:152:555:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:and:
18:674:42243:12:18:287:477:543:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:A:qm=Q:(43)
18:675:42252:18:22:133:477:525:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Then, a su¢ cient condition for the existence of endogenous cycles is simply that:
18:676:42334:22:22:257:477:503:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:A:qg< q-andqm> q+:(44)
18:677:42354:22:12:148:477:481:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:To see why, suppose that at some datet;unÖlled ordersqtlie in the interval
18:678:42428:12:12:133:477:469:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f4:B:(qg; q-):Then, the unique static equilibrium is for managers to play the margins
18:679:42508:12:11:133:477:457:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:strategy.  But then Assumption A1 implies that the market will maintain the
18:680:42583:11:12:133:477:446:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:margins conjecture, and managers will continue to fulÖll that conjecture, until
18:681:42662:12:12:133:477:434:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:B:qtcrosses the thresholdq+.  This crossing will necessarily occur in Önite time,
18:682:42741:12:12:133:477:422:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:sinceqm> q+:When the threshold is crossed, the margins strategy will cease
18:683:42815:12:12:133:477:410:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:to be an equilibrium and the Örm will switch to the growth strategy.  Once the
18:684:42893:12:12:133:477:398:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:growth strategy is in place,qtwill begin to decline, heading towardsqg.  Now,
18:685:42970:12:12:133:477:386:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:sinceqg< q-, the sequenceqtwill cross the thresholdq-in Önite time, which in
18:686:43046:12:12:133:477:374:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:turn brings us back to the situation where we startedñi.e., whereqtbelongs to
18:687:43123:12:12:133:473:362:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the interval(qg; q-)and where the margins strategy is the unique equilibrium.
18:688:43200:12:12:148:477:350:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:This establishes part (ii) of the proposition.  It also should be pointed out
18:689:43277:12:12:133:477:338:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:that, sinceq-andq+are independent ofQandA;the above condition (44)
18:690:43343:12:12:133:476:326:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f6:B:is easily satisÖed if\ris small relative toAandQ, because in this case,qg
18:691:43416:12:12:133:477:314:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:is approximately equal to\rQ=A, which can be made arbitrarily small, while
18:692:43490:12:12:133:348:302:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:B:qm=Q, which can independently be made large.
18:693:43534:12:12:148:477:290:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Figure 1 provides an illustration of deterministic cycles with constant de-
18:694:43609:12:12:133:477:278:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:mand áow. We choose the following baseline parameter values:Q= 2,\r= 0:1,
18:695:43682:12:12:133:477:266:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:B:A= 0:5,-a=-s=-m= 1,-= 0:1, and-= 1. We then solve the model
18:696:43741:12:12:133:477:254:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:forward over 100 periods, for each of three values of-: (i)-= 0(i.e., the Örst-
18:697:43820:12:12:133:477:242:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:best case); (ii)-= 1:0; and (iii)-= 1:5.  In each case, we plot the evolution
18:698:43897:12:12:133:199:230:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:ofqtover time.
18:699:43911:12:12:148:477:218:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:In the Örst-best case,qtstarts out at a value of0:2, so we are initially in the
18:700:43990:12:12:133:477:206:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:margins regime. The low level of output associated with the margins strategy
18:701:44066:12:11:133:477:194:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:causesqtto rise. Whenqthits one, the Örm switches to an interior level of
18:702:44139:11:12:133:477:183:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:e§ort given by (39).  From this point onward, the Örm is in steady state, with
18:703:44217:12:12:133:265:171:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:B:ef= 0:22, andqtÖxed at one.
18:704:44244:12:12:148:477:159:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Moving to the catering-to-the-market case when-= 1:0, we have that
18:705:44310:12:12:133:479:147:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:B:q-= 0:71, andq+= 1:41.  Thus the Örm stays with the margins strategyñ
18:706:44379:12:12:133:477:135:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:andqtkeeps increasingñfor longer than in the Örst-best, untilqtcrosses1:41.
18:707:44454:12:0:133:477:123:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:At this point, the Örm switches to the growth strategy, which drivesqtsharply
19:708:44533:0:12:133:477:657:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:downward. Whenqtfalls below0:71, the Örm goes back to the margins strategy,
19:709:44608:12:12:133:269:645:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:and the cycle starts over again.
19:710:44640:12:12:148:477:633:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Things are qualitatively similar with-= 1:5.   However, we now have
19:711:44707:12:12:133:477:621:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:thatq-= 0:64, andq+= 1:59, i.e., the size of the multiple-equilibrium range
19:712:44782:12:12:133:477:609:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:has increased.  This leads to more pronounced overshooting, and hence to a
19:713:44856:12:12:133:477:597:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:smaller number of cycles, with each cycle being of larger amplitude.  Consider
19:714:44934:12:12:133:477:585:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:in particular the Örst switch point.  With-= 1:5, the Örm stays with the
19:715:45006:12:12:133:477:573:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:margins strategy longer, untilqtcrosses1:59.  Thus the Örst transition to the
19:716:45083:12:12:133:477:561:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:growth strategy is delayed, coming att= 14, rather than att= 11, as in the
19:717:45157:12:12:133:476:549:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f6:B:case where-= 1:0.  The bottom line is that the increase in-results inqt
19:718:45228:12:12:133:477:537:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:being on average further away from the Örst-best value of one.  The natural
19:719:45303:12:12:133:477:525:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:interpretation is that a more intense managerial focus on current stock prices
19:720:45381:12:22:133:350:513:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:has negative consequences for economic e¢ ciency.

19:723:45500:18:12:133:477:447:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:The other case of interest is the one where the demand áow declines monotoni-
19:724:45577:12:12:133:477:435:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:cally over time.  As seen above, in the Örst-best this decline in demand áow is
19:725:45656:12:12:133:477:423:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:matched by a monotonic reduction in the e§ort devoted to the growth strategy.
19:726:45733:12:12:133:477:411:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:The goal here is to show that when managers cater to the stock market, the
19:727:45807:12:12:133:462:399:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:adjustment of growth-related e§ortñand hence ofqtñcan be non-monotonic.
19:728:45878:12:12:148:477:387:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:The mechanism is very similar to that which generates cycles in the constant-
19:729:45955:12:12:133:477:375:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:B:Qcase. For the sake of concreteness, suppose that the demand áowQtdeclines
19:730:46029:12:24:133:272:363:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:geometrically over time, that is:

19:733:46146:12:22:133:413:310:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:growth regime.  In this regime, the dynamics ofqtare given by:

19:736:46313:12:12:133:477:230:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:tion A1, the Örm will stay in the growth regime past the point whereqtdrops

19:738:46464:12:12:133:477:206:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:best, the Örm transitions to an interior level of e§ort as soon asqtreaches one.)

19:742:46678:18:12:148:477:140:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Because the e§ort devoted to growth has been cut by a discrete amount, it
19:743:46751:12:0:133:477:128:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:is possible thatqtwill now start rising, in spite of the general downward drag
20:744:46831:0:12:133:477:657:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:from the shrinking demand áow.  Indeed,qtmay well cross back aboveq+,
20:745:46900:12:12:133:415:645:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:leading the Örm to switch back to the growth regime once again.
20:746:46963:12:12:148:477:633:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Of course, in the long run,qtwill always converge to zero (since the demand
20:747:47038:12:12:133:477:621:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:áowQtis going to zero), and the Örm will wind up absorbed in the margins
20:748:47110:12:12:133:477:609:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:regime.  But what is interesting relative to the Örst-best case is that this con-
20:749:47191:12:12:133:477:597:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:vergence need not be monotonic. Indeed, it can in principle involve a number
20:750:47267:12:12:133:477:585:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:of transitions back and forth between the growth and margin regimes, with
20:751:47340:12:12:133:328:573:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:corresponding áuctuations in the value ofqt.
20:752:47384:12:12:148:477:561:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Figure 2 illustrates this phenomenon of non-monotonic convergence. We set
20:753:47457:12:12:133:477:549:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:B:Q0= 20,\f= 0:9,\r= 0:1,A= 0:5,-a=-s=-m= 1,-= 0:1, and-= 1.
20:754:47515:12:12:133:477:537:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:We then plot the evolution ofqtin two cases: (i) the Örst-best case where-= 0;
20:755:47593:12:12:133:205:525:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:and (ii)-= 1:0.
20:756:47608:12:12:148:477:513:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:In the Örst-best case,qtstarts out at a value of2:0, so we are initially in
20:757:47683:12:12:133:477:501:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the growth regime. In spite of this fact, the demand áow is so high in the early
20:758:47763:12:12:133:477:489:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:periods thatqtcontinues to increase, reaching a peak value of3:2att= 3.
20:759:47834:12:12:133:477:477:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:From this point on, the level of output associated with the growth strategy is
20:760:47912:12:12:133:477:465:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:enough to overwhelm the now-smaller demand áow, soqtbegins to fall.  When
20:761:47985:12:11:133:477:453:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:B:qthits one, which happens att= 14, the Örm switches to an interior level
20:762:48057:11:12:133:476:442:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f6:B:of e§ort given by (40). This e§ort level declines gradually over time, andqt
20:763:48133:12:12:133:477:430:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:remains Öxed at one, untilt= 30.  From this point onward, the demand áow
20:764:48205:12:12:133:477:418:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:is too low for an interior e§ort level to be viable.  Therefore the Örm moves to
20:765:48285:12:12:133:373:406:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the pure margins strategy, andqtdeclines toward zero.
20:766:48338:12:12:148:477:394:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:In the second-best case, with-= 1:0, we have as before thatq-= 0:71,

20:768:48481:12:12:133:477:370:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:early periodsñthe Örm plays the growth strategy, andqtÖrst rises, then begins
20:769:48558:12:12:133:477:358:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:to fall.  However, the two cases diverge whenqtreaches one.  Rather than

20:772:48779:12:12:133:477:322:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the Örm switches to the margins strategy.  Demand áow is still strong enough

20:774:48930:12:12:133:477:298:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:goes back to the growth strategy, andqtstarts falling again. As it turns out,
20:775:49007:12:12:133:477:286:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:this second growth episode is the last one; the next time that the Örm returns to
20:776:49088:12:12:133:477:274:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the margins strategy, demand áow has abated to the point whereqtnever again

20:778:49237:12:20:133:476:250:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:goes back to growth, all before settling permanently into the margins strategy.

20:782:49389:29:12:133:477:155:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:So far we have taken stock-market investors to be fully rationalñi.e., able to
20:783:49467:12:12:133:477:143:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:form Bayesian forecasts based on all observed variables.  In what follows, we
20:784:49544:12:12:133:477:131:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:brieáy explore the consequences of a simple form of bounded rationality.  In
20:785:49620:12:0:133:477:119:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:particular, we suppose that there is a representative investor who can only run
21:786:49701:0:12:133:477:657:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:univariate regressions.14Since optimal forecasting in our setting requires the
21:787:49779:12:12:133:477:645:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:use of bivariate regressions, this is a meaningful limitation. In all other respects,
21:788:49864:12:12:133:477:633:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:however, the representative investor is completely rational. His univariate fore-
21:789:49945:12:12:133:477:621:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:casts are unbiased, and in any given equilibrium (growth or margins) he picks

21:791:50087:12:12:148:477:597:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:In principle, the single most powerful forecasting variable for next periodís
21:792:50164:12:12:133:477:585:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:proÖts can be either: i) current proÖts; ii) current sales; or iii) current margins,
21:793:50248:12:12:133:477:573:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:depending on the equilibrium that we are in.  So to solve the general case, we
21:794:50326:12:12:133:477:561:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:would have to compute the forecast errors associated with each of these three
21:795:50403:12:12:133:477:549:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:variables, across both the growth and margins regimes. To keep things simple,
21:796:50480:12:12:133:477:537:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:we focus on an extreme but illustrative case, where the persistence coe¢ cient
21:797:50558:12:12:133:477:525:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:B:-is small but non-zero. We Örst revisit the static model, and then sketch the
21:798:50635:12:12:133:229:513:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:dynamic implications.
21:799:50656:12:12:148:477:501:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:In the context of the static model, it is easy to see that when-is positive but

21:803:50961:12:11:133:477:453:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:as given before. All that changes is that\fmgand\fsmare now e§ectively set to

21:805:51119:12:12:133:477:430:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:words, in the growth regime the representative investor focuses only on sales,
21:806:51197:12:12:133:477:418:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:and gives it the same weight as before, while completely ignoring margins, with
21:807:51276:12:12:133:329:406:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the reverse being true in the margins regime.
21:808:51321:12:12:148:477:394:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:As in Section 2, we can calculate cut-o§ values ofq0that deÖne the regions

21:815:51549:21:12:137:477:321:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:This equation is almost identical to its counterpart (21) in the rational case,
21:816:51628:12:12:133:477:309:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:except that the term(----)on the left-hand side of that equation has now
21:817:51700:12:19:133:317:297:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:disappeared.  It follows immediately that:

21:824:51800:23:12:133:477:200:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:This equation also looks like its counterpart (25) in the rational case, except for

21:826:51956:12:12:133:160:176:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:yields:

21:828:51975:14:12:141:477:150:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:14This assumption can be motivated by the observation that investors tend to simplify
21:829:52060:12:10:133:476:138:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:the world around them, and hence do not use all available sources of information in making
21:830:52150:10:9:133:476:128:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:their forecasts.  See Hong and Stein (2004) for an extensive discussion, and references to the
21:831:52244:9:0:133:245:119:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:relevant psychology literature.
22:832:52277:0:12:148:477:657:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Thus for the static model, introducing the bounded-rationality feature en-
22:833:52351:12:12:133:477:645:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:larges the multiple-equilibrium region, from(q-; q+)to(q-b; q+b).  There is a
22:834:52428:12:12:133:477:633:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:very natural intuition for this result. Suppose we are currently in a growth equi-
22:835:52510:12:12:133:477:621:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:librium. With bounded rationality, the market pays attention to sales as before,
22:836:52590:12:12:133:477:609:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:but now completely ignores margins.  Thus for a manager who contemplates
22:837:52662:12:12:133:477:597:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:deviating from the growth strategy to the margins strategy, the prospective hit
22:838:52741:12:12:133:477:585:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:to her stock price is more severe than beforeñthe market will penalize her for the
22:839:52823:12:12:133:477:573:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:reduction in sales, but will give her no credit whatsoever for the improvement
22:840:52901:12:12:133:477:561:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:in margins.  As a result, she is more inclined to simply continue playing the
22:841:52978:12:12:133:477:549:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:growth strategy. Similarly, if we start o§ in a margins equilibrium, the manager
22:842:53058:12:12:133:394:537:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:will again be very reluctant to deviate to a growth strategy.
22:843:53119:12:12:148:477:525:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Notice that introducing bounded rationality has an e§ect that is isomorphic
22:844:53194:12:12:133:477:513:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:to increasing the parameter-, which measures how intensely managers care
22:845:53266:12:12:133:477:501:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:about the current stock price.  In the former case, the potential for multiple
22:846:53344:12:12:133:477:489:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:equilibria goes up because there is a bigger stock-price penalty for bucking the
22:847:53424:12:12:133:477:477:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:expectations of a naive market; in the latter case, the potential for multiple
22:848:53502:12:12:133:477:465:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:equilibria goes up because managers are less willing to tolerate a stock-price
22:849:53580:12:11:133:243:453:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:penalty of any given size.
22:850:53606:11:12:148:477:442:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:When we move to the dynamic setting, everything continues to work exactly
22:851:53679:12:12:133:477:430:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:as before, except that we now use the new cut-o§ valuesq-bandq+bin place of
22:852:53754:12:12:133:477:418:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:their rational counterpartsq-andq+. This implies that whenever the conditions
22:853:53831:12:12:133:477:406:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:of Proposition 2 are satisÖed, and a cyclical equilibrium exists, the magnitude of
22:854:53913:12:12:133:477:394:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:B:the áuctuations is greater than before, in much the same way as an increase in-
22:855:53992:12:12:133:477:382:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:leads to more extreme áuctuations. Again, this is because once entrenched in a
22:856:54070:12:12:133:477:370:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:given regime, managers are more reluctant than before to change strategies. As
22:857:54148:12:12:133:477:358:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:a result, they play any given strategy longer, which leads to more pronounced

22:860:54321:12:12:133:477:322:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:cases.   We return to a constant-demand-áow environment, and setQ= 2,

22:863:54517:12:12:133:477:286:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the fully-rational case is actually identical to the one for-= 1in Figure 1;
22:864:54593:12:12:133:477:274:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:all the other parameter values are the same, and so we again haveq-= 0:71,
22:865:54667:12:12:133:477:262:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:andq+= 1:41.  With bounded rationality,q-b= 0:65, andq+b= 1:55; these
22:866:54736:12:12:133:477:250:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:are almost the same cuto§s that we obtained under full rationality in Figure 1
22:867:54814:12:12:133:477:238:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:by setting-= 1:5.  So not surprisingly, we get essentially the same outcome:
22:868:54890:12:12:133:477:226:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:cycles are of both longer duration and greater amplitude, and on average,qtis

23:876:55398:12:12:133:477:633:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:context, this might mean using the same pricing rule (based on either a growth

23:883:55896:12:12:133:477:549:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:very strong growth prospects, and winds up entrenched in the growth equilib-

23:885:56051:12:12:133:477:525:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:as well, because they know they will be evaluated by the market based on the

23:888:56193:33:12:133:477:447:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:We now turn to the modelís empirical content. First, we discuss the implications
23:889:56273:12:12:133:477:435:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:that áow from the version with fully rational investors.  Next, we brieáy touch
23:890:56352:12:12:133:477:423:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:on the extra predictions that arise when bounded rationality is added to the
23:891:56428:12:28:133:152:411:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:mix.
23:892:56432:28:19:133:364:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:C:4.1  The model with rational investors
23:893:56470:19:12:133:477:364:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Unlike most of the literature on the stock market and real activity, our theoryís
23:894:56551:12:11:133:477:352:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:primary focus is not on how thelevelof stock prices ináuences real variables.
23:895:56628:11:12:133:477:341:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:That is, we have little to say regarding the textbookQ-theoretic prediction that
23:896:56708:12:12:133:477:329:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:a Örmís investment and sales growth will be higher when its stock price is high
23:897:56787:12:12:133:477:317:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:(Tobin (1969)). Instead, what matters in our framework is the marketís pricing
23:898:56865:12:12:133:477:305:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:ruleñi.e., thesensitivityof stock prices to observable variables such as sales and
23:899:56947:12:12:133:477:293:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:proÖt margins.  Thus our central implication is that a Örmís investment and
23:900:57022:12:12:133:477:281:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:sales growth will be higher when its stock price is more sensitive to growth-
23:901:57099:12:12:133:477:269:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:oriented metrics.  And conversely, a Örmís investment and sales growth will
23:902:57174:12:12:133:477:257:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:be lowerñand proÖt margins higherñwhen its stock price is more sensitive to
23:903:57249:12:12:133:477:245:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:measures of costs and margins.  Moreover, a subsidiary prediction is that these
23:904:57328:12:12:133:477:233:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:basic e§ects will be more pronounced in those Örms where managers have high-
23:905:57404:12:12:133:377:221:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:powered incentives to maximize short-term stock prices.
23:906:57459:12:12:148:477:209:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:How might one operationalize tests of these hypotheses?  Although a com-
23:907:57531:12:12:133:477:197:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:plete treatment of this question is beyond the scope of the paper, we can o§er
23:908:57609:12:12:133:477:185:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:a few tentative thoughts.  First, one might use cross-sectional regressions to
23:909:57687:12:12:133:477:173:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:estimate the sensitivity of stock prices to di§erent variables at a given point in
23:910:57769:12:12:133:477:161:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:time.  To be more speciÖc, imagine that for industryiat timet, we take all
23:911:57843:12:12:133:477:149:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the existing Örms, and run a cross-sectional regression of each Örmís market-to-
23:912:57923:12:0:133:477:137:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:book ratio against: (i) some measure of its growth-related performance (e.g.,
24:913:58002:0:12:133:477:657:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:sales growth over the prior year); and (ii) some measure of its per-unit prof-
24:914:58080:12:12:133:477:645:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:itability (e.g., its gross margin).  The coe¢ cient on the former variable would
24:915:58160:12:12:133:477:633:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:then be the ìgrowth betaî for industryiat timet, and the coe¢ cient on the
24:916:58234:12:12:133:327:621:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:latter variable would be the ìmargins betaî.
24:917:58278:12:12:148:477:609:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:The next step would be to relate changes in these growth and margins betas
24:918:58352:12:12:133:477:597:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:over time to changes in the nature of Örm performance. In particular, one could
24:919:58431:12:12:133:477:585:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:ask whether, e.g., investment is on average higher for Örms in industryiat those
24:920:58511:12:12:133:477:573:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:times when the industryís growth beta is larger.   And with the appropriate
24:921:58586:12:12:133:477:561:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:data on managerial incentives, one could further check to see if this relationship
24:922:58668:12:12:133:477:549:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:is more pronounced in the subset of Örms where managers have a lot of stock
24:923:58743:12:12:133:334:537:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:or options that can be sold in the near future.
24:924:58790:12:12:148:477:525:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:We are unaware of any empirical work that explores these questions.  How-
24:925:58863:12:12:133:477:513:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:ever, we should mention a pair of recent papers by Baker and Wurgler (2004a,
24:926:58939:12:12:133:477:501:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:2004b) that share a similar spirit. Baker and Wurgler develop a catering theory
24:927:59018:12:12:133:477:489:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:of dividends, and provide the following evidence in favor of it.  First, they cal-
24:928:59100:12:12:133:477:477:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:culate at any point in time a ìdividend premiumî, deÖned as the di§erence in
24:929:59176:12:12:133:477:465:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the average market-to-book ratio of dividend-paying and non-dividend-paying
24:930:59251:12:11:133:477:453:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Örms. They then show that variation over time in this dividend premium helps
24:931:59327:11:12:133:477:442:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:to explain Örmsíchoices of dividend policy: Örms are signiÖcantly more likely to
24:932:59407:12:12:133:477:430:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:initiate dividend payments when the dividend premium is high.  While Baker
24:933:59481:12:12:133:477:418:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:and Wurglerís interest is in a Önancial, rather than real variable (i.e., dividends,
24:934:59565:12:12:133:477:406:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:as opposed to sales growth or investment), the structure of their tests is closely
24:935:59647:12:12:133:477:394:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:analogous to what we propose above.  That is, they estimate the point-in-time
24:936:59724:12:12:133:477:382:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:sensitivity of stock prices to a particular Örm attribute using cross-sectional
24:937:59803:12:12:133:477:370:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:comparisons, and then show that managersíapparent willingness to deliver this
24:938:59880:12:28:133:396:358:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f4:B:attribute is greater when the market values it more highly.15
24:939:59941:28:18:133:381:330:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:C:4.2  Consequences of bounded rationality
24:940:59981:18:12:138:477:312:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:The fully-rational version of the model has nothing to say about expected
24:941:60054:12:12:133:477:300:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:stock returnsñthey are simply constant over time.  In contrast, the bounded-
24:942:60130:12:12:133:477:288:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:rationality version of the model makes a novel and relatively subtle prediction.
24:943:60210:12:12:133:477:276:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:When we are in a growth equilibrium, the market fully impounds all growth-
24:944:60284:12:12:133:477:264:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:related information, but ignores margins-related information. This implies that
24:945:60363:12:12:133:477:252:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:in a growth equilibrium, Örms with strong proÖt margins will be undervalued,
24:946:60439:12:12:133:477:240:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:and have high expected returns, while Örms with weak proÖt margins will be
24:947:60513:12:12:133:477:228:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:overvalued, and have low expected returns.   Conversely, in a margins equi-
24:948:60588:12:12:133:477:216:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:librium, the market takes account of margins-related information, but under-
24:949:60664:12:12:133:477:204:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:weights growth-related information.  So Örms with strong growth performance
24:950:60739:12:12:133:477:192:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:will have high expected returns, and Örms with weak growth performance will
24:951:60814:12:15:133:249:180:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:have low expected returns.
24:952:60840:15:12:141:477:165:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:15One distinction between our work and Baker and Wurgler (2004a, 2004b) is that they in-
24:953:60928:12:9:133:477:153:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:tepret the time-variation in the marketís sensitivity to dividends as a manifestation of investor
24:954:61025:9:10:133:476:144:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:irrationality.  In contrast, we have emphasized that time-variation in the marketís sensitivity
24:955:61120:10:0:133:423:134:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:to measures of growth and margins can be part of a fully rational equilibrium.
25:956:61200:0:12:148:477:657:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:The key insight is that neither attributeñgrowth or marginsñwill be system-
25:957:61275:12:12:133:477:645:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:atically mispriced at all times.   Rather, there will be time-variation in the
25:958:61353:12:12:133:477:633:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:nature of cross-sectional return predictability.  For example, sometimes a trad-
25:959:61433:12:12:133:477:621:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:ing strategy of buying high-margin Örms and shorting low-margin ones will work
25:960:61511:12:12:133:477:609:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:well, and at other times it will work less well. Moreover, the theory tell us pre-
25:961:61593:12:12:133:477:597:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:cisely when the strategy should be expected to work best: when the industry in
25:962:61671:12:12:133:290:585:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:question is in a high-growth regime.
25:963:61707:12:12:148:477:573:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Again, we do not know of any work that can be thought of as a systematic
25:964:61779:12:12:133:477:561:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:test of this hypothesis.  Perhaps the closest bit of evidence comes from Baker
25:965:61857:12:12:133:477:549:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:and Wurgler (2004c).   They too are interested in the general idea of time-
25:966:61932:12:12:133:477:537:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:variation in the cross-section of expected stock returns, and they examine how
25:967:62010:12:12:133:477:525:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the predictive content of di§erent Örm characteristics for stock returns varies
25:968:62089:12:12:133:477:513:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:with proxies for the overall level of investor sentiment.  One of their Öndings
25:969:62168:12:12:133:477:501:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:is that: (i) when investor sentiment is relatively high, unproÖtable Örms have
25:970:62246:12:12:133:477:489:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:lower expected returns than proÖtable Örms; but (ii) when investor sentiment
25:971:62322:12:12:133:477:477:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:is relatively low, this pattern reverses itself, so that unproÖtable Örms have
25:972:62400:12:12:133:477:465:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:higher expected returns. If one thinks of investor sentiment as being positively
25:973:62480:12:11:133:477:453:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:correlated with economy-wide growth prospects, this Önding can be seen as
25:974:62553:11:33:133:341:442:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Ötting nicely with the predictions of our theory.
25:975:62602:33:22:133:256:409:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:C:5  Related Work

25:979:62852:12:12:133:477:351:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:our model di§ers from this work in that we do not require any irrationality on

25:981:63008:12:12:133:477:327:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:as we have argued, accommodate such irrationality).  Moreover, in our set-

25:990:63666:12:12:133:477:219:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:earnings, short-term-oriented managers will take various steps to pump up earn-
25:991:63745:12:12:133:477:207:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:ings, either via accounting manipulations, or through real-side distortions such
25:992:63825:12:11:133:477:195:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:as cuts in maintenance expenditures, changes in pricing policies designed to
25:993:63901:11:12:133:443:184:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:bring forward current sales at the expense of future sales, and so forth.
25:994:63974:12:12:148:477:172:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:By contrast with this work, our premise is that the market makes inferences
25:995:64049:12:12:133:477:160:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:about Örm value based on multiple variables (i.e., both growth and proÖtability
25:996:64128:12:12:133:477:148:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:measures) rather than just earnings.  This leads to the potential for a broader
25:997:64207:12:12:133:477:136:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:set of outcomes than in models of earnings hyping; for example, Örms may
25:998:64279:12:0:133:477:124:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:sometimes invest too much, when they are playing the growth strategy.  And
26:999:64355:0:12:133:477:657:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:importantly, multivariate learning generates a more dynamic account of Örm
26:1000:64429:12:12:133:477:645:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:behavior, whereby the nature of the distortion varies over time along with the
26:1001:64507:12:12:133:271:633:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:marketís approach to valuation.
26:1002:64538:12:12:148:477:621:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:The one paper in the short-termism/learning genre that is closest to ours is
26:1003:64614:12:12:133:477:609:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Rajanís (1994) account of bank credit cycles.  Like we do, Rajan considers the
26:1004:64692:12:12:133:477:597:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:possibility that there will be time-variation in how the market makes inferences
26:1005:64772:12:12:133:477:585:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:about managerial ability. In particular, if a bank reports poor performance due
26:1006:64851:12:12:133:477:573:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:to loan losses, it will tend to be evaluated harshly by the market, unless many
26:1007:64930:12:12:133:477:561:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:other banks are also su§ering loan losses at the same time, in which case the
26:1008:65007:12:12:133:477:549:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:market will blame a systematic shock.  This mechanism can lead to cycles in
26:1009:65082:12:12:133:477:537:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:which banks roll over bad loans for several periods in order hide their losses, and
26:1010:65165:12:12:133:477:525:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:then, when the buildup of bad loans reaches a critical point, they coordinate
26:1011:65242:12:12:133:477:513:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:and all switch to a strategy of loss recognition and credit contraction.  This is
26:1012:65323:12:12:133:477:501:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:similar in many ways to our story.  Perhaps the most noteworthy di§erence is
26:1013:65399:12:12:133:477:489:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:that in Rajanís model, the dynamics of learning are driven by a benchmarking
26:1014:65475:12:12:133:477:477:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:externality across banks.  That is, there need to be several similar banks, and
26:1015:65554:12:12:133:477:465:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:the market must base its evaluation of bankiin part on the performance of
26:1016:65627:12:11:133:477:453:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:bankj.  In our model, on the other hand, each Örm is evaluated by the market
26:1017:65703:11:12:133:293:442:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:based solely on its own performance.
26:1018:65739:12:12:148:477:430:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:Within the large literature on macroeconomic áuctuations, we are probably
26:1019:65812:12:12:133:477:418:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:closest to the work on endogenous business cycles.16This research shows that
26:1020:65888:12:12:133:477:406:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:purely intrinsic cycles can arise from a variety of other sources beyond those
26:1021:65966:12:12:133:477:394:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:considered here: (i) the existence of non-linearities as in Grandmont (1985);
26:1022:66043:12:12:133:477:382:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:(ii) price or wage rigidities which lead to a multiplier-accelerator mechanism as
26:1023:66124:12:12:133:477:370:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:in Goodwin (1951); or (iii) pecuniary externalities combined with credit con-
26:1024:66201:12:12:133:477:358:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:straints, as in Aghion, Banerjee and Piketty (1999).  Also related is Shleifer
26:1025:66279:12:12:133:477:346:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:(1986), who shows that endogenous cycles can be driven by each Örmís desire
26:1026:66354:12:12:133:477:334:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:to coordinate the timing of its investments with that of other Örms.  As with
26:1027:66431:12:12:133:477:322:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:Rajan (1994), Shleiferís model is thus fundamentally about strategic interaction
26:1028:66511:12:12:133:477:310:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:across Örms, whereas ours is about the interplay between a single Örm and the

26:1031:66617:22:12:133:477:243:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:The basic message of this paper can be simply stated.  A desire on the part of
26:1032:66695:12:14:133:477:231:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:managers to please the stock market can introduce signiÖcant excess volatility
26:1033:66773:14:13:141:477:217:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:16The work on endogenous business cycles can be contrasted with the real-business cycle
26:1034:66860:13:9:133:476:204:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:(RBC) approach pioneered by Kydland and Prescott (1982), as well as with models based on
26:1035:66948:9:10:133:476:195:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:ìsunspotsî or ìanimal spiritsî (e.g., Woodford (1990), Howitt and McAfee (1992)).  In the
26:1036:67037:10:9:133:477:185:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:RBC framework, áuctuations result from exogeneous shocks to, e.g., demand or technology.
26:1037:67125:9:10:133:479:176:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:In sunspot models, extrinsic variables also play a key role, namely that of coordinating agentsí

26:1041:67414:10:9:133:476:138:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:F:are endogenous. This means that, as in our model, Örms have to divide their e§orts between

27:1044:67630:12:12:133:477:645:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:e¢ cient.  This conclusion di§ers from the premise implicit in much recent re-

27:1048:67948:12:0:133:355:597:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:B:which we hope to explore in future empirical work.
