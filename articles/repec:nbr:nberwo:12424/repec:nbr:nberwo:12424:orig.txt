2:29:1515:42:14:71:539:581:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Analyses of college attainment typically focus on factors affecting enrollment demand, including the
2:30:1615:14:15:71:539:567:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:financial attractiveness of a college education and the availability of financial aid, while implicitly
2:31:1718:15:14:71:539:552:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:assuming  that  resources  available  per  student  on  the  supply  side  of  the  market  are  elastically
2:32:1826:14:14:71:539:538:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:supplied. The higher education market in the United States is dominated by public and non-profit
2:33:1922:14:14:71:539:524:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:production, and  colleges  and universities receive considerable subsidies from state, federal, and
2:34:2021:14:14:71:539:510:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:private sources. Because consumers pay only a fraction of the cost of production, changes in demand
2:35:2120:14:14:71:539:496:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:are unlikely to be accommodated fully by colleges and universities without commensurate increases
2:36:2217:14:15:71:539:482:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:in non-tuition revenue. For this reason, public investment in higher education plays a crucial role in
2:37:2319:15:14:71:539:467:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:determining the degrees produced and the supply of college-educated workers to the labor market.
2:38:2415:14:14:71:539:453:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Using data covering the last half of the twentieth century, we find strong evidence that large cohorts
2:39:2517:14:14:71:539:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:within  states  have  relatively  low  undergraduate  degree  attainment,  reflecting  less  than  perfect
2:40:2623:14:14:71:539:425:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:elasticity of supply in the higher education market. That large cohorts receive lower public subsidies
2:41:2725:14:14:71:539:411:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:per student in higher education explains this result, indicating that resources have large effects on
2:42:2826:14:14:71:539:397:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:degree  production.  Our  results  suggest  that  reduced  resources  per  student  following  from  rising
2:43:2933:14:15:71:539:383:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:cohort size and lower state expenditures are likely to have significant negative effects on the supply
2:44:3035:15:42:71:333:368:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of college-educated workers entering the labor market.

3:59:3324:14:28:146:467:695:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f3:Cohort Crowding:  How resources affect collegiate attainment 
3:60:3384:28:27:125:507:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Analyses of college enrollment and college completion rates typically focus on 
3:61:3463:27:28:89:515:640:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:demand-side factors including the financial attractiveness of a college education and the 
3:62:3553:28:28:89:483:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:availability of financial aid. Implicit in this line of research is the assumption that 
3:63:3641:28:27:89:513:584:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:colleges and universities adjust supply fully with changes in demand. However, there is 
3:64:3729:27:28:89:489:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:good reason to believe that supply is not even close to perfectly elastic. The higher 
3:65:3815:28:27:89:515:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:education market in the United States is dominated by public and non-profit production, 
3:66:3903:27:28:89:492:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and colleges and universities receive considerable subsidies from state, federal, and 
3:67:3989:28:28:89:522:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:private sources. Indeed, Winston (1999) estimates that student fees cover only about 12% 
3:68:4078:28:27:89:513:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:percent of total educational costs at public colleges and universities in the U.S.  Parallel 
3:69:4171:27:28:89:494:419:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:estimates of the average share of costs covered by student tuition and fees at private 
3:70:4258:28:27:89:520:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:colleges and universities are substantially higher, but still less than 50%, and much lower 
3:71:4350:27:28:89:506:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:at the most selective institutions. Because consumers pay only a fraction of the cost of 
3:72:4439:28:28:89:508:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:production, changes in demand are unlikely to be accommodated fully by colleges and 
3:73:4523:28:27:89:497:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:universities without commensurate increases in non-tuition revenue. For this reason, 
3:74:4608:27:28:89:498:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:public investment in higher education plays a crucial role in determining the degrees 
3:75:4694:28:27:89:445:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:produced and the supply of college-educated workers to the labor market. 
3:76:4767:27:28:125:452:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Significant public subsidies for college education brought about the 
3:77:4836:28:28:89:500:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:transformation to “mass higher education” in the post World War II decades with the 
3:78:4920:28:27:89:486:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:founding of community colleges and dramatic growth in public four-year colleges 
3:79:5000:27:28:89:494:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(Goldin, 1999).  Resources for higher education were especially plentiful in the two 
3:80:5085:28:27:89:511:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:decades following World War II, a period sometimes referred to as the “Golden Years” 
3:81:5170:27:0:89:506:88:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of higher education. One study sites an average annual growth rate of 8% in education 
4:82:5257:0:28:89:513:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and general expenditures per student during the decade of the 1960s  (Cheit, 1971). The 
4:83:5345:28:28:89:521:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reach of public subsidies during this period extended to capital projects as well as current 
4:84:5438:28:27:89:518:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:expenditures, with the number of colleges rising from 1,886 institutions in 1955 to 2,573 
4:85:5528:27:28:89:517:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in 1970, a rate of almost 1 new institution per week (Finn, 1978).1  Fortunes for colleges 
4:86:5619:28:27:89:492:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reversed dramatically at the end of the 1960s and through the 1970s, however.  The 
4:87:5702:27:28:89:470:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:aggregate link between higher education resources and collegiate attainment is 
4:88:5781:28:28:89:521:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:unmistakable: the proportion of the population completing a BA rose from about 17% for 
4:89:5868:28:27:89:520:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:those born in 1930, representing college-going in the early 1950s, to about 29% for those 
4:90:5958:27:28:89:492:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:born two decades late in 1950.  It would be hard to imagine this dramatic change in 
4:91:6042:28:27:89:523:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:attainment without a corresponding increase in public support for higher education.  After 
4:92:6133:27:28:89:502:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the 1951 birth cohort, collegiate attainment declined and then stagnated, before rising 
4:93:6221:28:28:89:273:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:again with cohorts born in the 1960s.

4:95:6342:27:28:89:496:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the aggregate time series provides circumstantial evidence that changes in collegiate 
4:96:6428:28:27:89:490:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:resources per student affect student outcomes. The interpretation of this time series 
4:97:6514:27:28:89:515:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:evidence is, however, open to question --  it is possible that expenditures may have been 
4:98:6604:28:28:89:511:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:responding to increases in the demand for a college education rather than the other way 
4:99:6692:28:50:89:506:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:around. This paper uses variation in the size of the college-age cohorts within states to

4:101:6830:7:16:125:522:182:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:1 The period from 1950 to 1970 brought about an enormous expansion in the “capital stock” of the 
4:102:6927:16:11:89:509:166:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:college and university system.  Federal and state support were integral in building the physical capital of 
4:103:7035:11:12:89:497:155:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:colleges and universities, in addition to providing subsidies for operating expenses.. For example, the 
4:104:7139:12:12:89:504:143:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:contribution from federal government sources to plant fund accumulation increased from $12.3 million 
4:105:7240:12:11:89:515:131:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:dollars in 1950 to $333.7 million in 1966, while state funds increased from $285.2 million dollars in 1950 
4:106:7347:11:12:89:515:120:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:to $738.7 million in 1966.  These data are from Table 129 of the 1972 Digest of Education Statistics, with 
4:107:7454:12:11:89:513:108:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the Department of Education Surveys “Financial Statistics of Institutions of Higher Education” providing 
4:108:7559:11:11:89:496:97:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the original source. In addition to the direct grants from the federal government over this interval, the 
4:109:7665:11:12:89:507:86:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:federal government also provided access to substantial (subsidized) loan funds through the Housing Act 
4:110:7768:12:0:89:135:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:until 1969.

5:112:7870:28:28:89:392:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:per student and to measure the effects on collegiate attainment 
5:113:7934:28:27:125:512:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Because only part of any observed change in current expenditures is likely to be 
5:114:8015:27:28:89:524:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:exogenous and expenditures translate to resources with long lags, direct assessment of the 
5:115:8106:28:27:89:462:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:effect of resources per student on degree outcomes using measures of current 
5:116:8183:27:28:89:520:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:expenditures or state appropriations is not appropriate. As an alternative, we focus on the 
5:117:8274:28:28:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:effects of “crowding out” brought about by relatively large cohorts within states vying for 
5:118:8366:28:27:89:506:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a limited number of spaces in the higher education sector. Increases in the college-age 
5:119:8453:27:28:89:481:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:population shift out the higher education demand function. Yet, in the absence of 
5:120:8535:28:27:89:521:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:complete per capita adjustment in educational subsidies, increasing enrollment demand is 
5:121:8624:27:28:89:498:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:likely to reduce educational resources per student in aggregate.  When an increase in 
5:122:8710:28:28:89:520:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cohort size is not accompanied by a proportionate increase in resources, large cohorts are 
5:123:8801:28:27:89:472:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:essentially “crowded out” of the higher education sector. To this end, plausibly 
5:124:8882:27:28:89:509:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:exogenous variation in cohort size leads to a test of how the availability of resources at 
5:125:8973:28:27:89:386:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the college and university level affects collegiate attainment.  
5:126:9038:27:28:125:512:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Within state and year, we find a strong negative association between cohort size 
5:127:9119:28:28:89:517:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and college completion rates.  Our preferred estimates suggest that a 10% increase in the 
5:128:9209:28:27:89:498:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:size of the college-age population leads to a 4% decrease in college completion rates 
5:129:9295:27:28:89:510:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:within states.   Whether the reductions in college completion rates among large cohorts 
5:130:9383:28:27:89:521:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are caused by declines in the college-preparedness of large cohorts on the demand side of 
5:131:9473:27:28:89:513:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the higher education market or limitations in the adjustment of colleges and universities 
5:132:9563:28:0:89:523:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is important to the understanding of the ‘production’ of education and the determinants of 
6:133:9655:0:28:89:506:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the supply of college-educated workers.2 We present compelling evidence that limited 
6:134:9740:28:28:89:506:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:adjustment among colleges and universities on the supply-side of the higher education 
6:135:9826:28:27:89:494:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:market is the primary cause of the relative reduction in attainment (“crowding out”) 
6:136:9911:27:28:89:199:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:among large cohorts.   
6:137:9933:28:27:125:494:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: The first section of this analysis sets forth the defining characteristics of the 
6:138:10016:27:28:89:510:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:market for higher education in the context of a rudimentary but illustrative model.  The 
6:139:10105:28:28:89:513:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:high degree of public subsidy, the mixed market of public and non-profit providers, and 
6:140:10193:28:27:89:523:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the differentiated nature of the product in higher education lead to adjustments along both 
6:141:10285:27:28:89:517:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:quality and quantity dimensions in response to demand shocks. As a result, the predicted 
6:142:10374:28:27:89:504:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:change in undergraduate degree attainment is ultimately less than proportionate to the 
6:143:10461:27:28:89:484:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:change in cohort size, which can be thought of as a direct measure of the effect of 
6:144:10545:28:28:89:491:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:resources on collegiate attainment. The second section turns to the measurement of 
6:145:10628:28:27:89:522:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:variation within states over time in cohort size and the effect of this variable on collegiate 
6:146:10723:27:28:89:521:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:attainment. The third section focuses more directly on the nature of adjustments in higher 
6:147:10814:28:27:89:519:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:education by type of institution and the link between current revenues available to higher 
6:148:10905:27:28:89:508:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:education and cohort size. In the fourth section, we assess the empirical strength of the 
6:149:10995:28:28:89:515:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:alternative explanation that larger cohorts may have lower demand for college if college 
6:150:11084:28:27:89:510:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:preparedness (e.g., pre-collegiate achievement) is also connected to cohort size; but we 
6:151:11173:27:28:89:505:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:find such demand-side factors account for little of the reduction in college completion 
6:152:11261:28:27:89:515:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:among large cohorts. The basic finding is that the incomplete adjustment of resources in 
6:153:11350:27:28:89:509:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:response to population changes leads to a substantial reduction in collegiate attainment 
6:154:11439:28:28:89:121:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rates.

6:156:11495:7:16:125:490:94:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:2 That within-state growth in cohort size is negatively related to collegiate attainment is an 
6:157:11590:16:0:89:511:78:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:established result in the empirical literature (Card and Lemieux (2000) also record this relationship using 
7:158:11699:0:28:125:512:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:The conclusion is clear: resources matter in the production of higher education.  
7:159:11780:28:28:89:511:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Changes in the funding for public colleges and universities have a large impact on both

7:161:11955:27:28:89:491:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:appropriations limit the flow of resources to higher education and reduce collegiate 
7:162:12040:28:27:89:515:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:attainment, ultimately lowering the long-term supply of college-educated workers in the

7:169:12414:27:28:89:518:419:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:“quality” (or resource intensity) of this product. State colleges and universities expanded 
7:170:12506:28:27:89:506:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:markedly in the immediate post-war years and are integral to the overall production of 
7:171:12593:27:28:89:509:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:college education in the United States. The share of undergraduate degrees awarded by 
7:172:12679:28:28:89:518:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:public institutions has increased from about 50% in 1947 to about 65% in the 2003-2004 
7:173:12766:28:27:89:509:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:academic year, while the share of total college enrollment (including enrollment at sub-
7:174:12854:27:28:89:446:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:baccalaureate institutions) is even higher at about 79% in the fall of 2004. 
7:175:12931:28:27:125:470:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:State colleges and universities provide the majority of higher education 
7:176:13004:27:28:89:498:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:enrollment opportunities to their residents at a steep discount in price, made possible 
7:177:13092:28:28:89:516:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:through substantial public subsidies. Table 1 summarizes the role of state appropriations 
7:178:13182:28:27:89:485:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in the current revenue stream of colleges and universities. Notably, state and local 
7:179:13267:27:28:89:509:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:support accounted for 57.5% of current revenues at the public community colleges and 
7:180:13352:28:29:89:512:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:more than 36% of revenues at comprehensive four-year institutions. Although the share

8:183:13608:0:28:89:513:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of state support (30%) is somewhat lower at public research universities, the levels tend 
8:184:13698:28:28:89:499:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to be higher, and these institutions also rely on a range of other non-tuition revenues, 
8:185:13787:28:27:89:480:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:including resources from private donations and research support from the federal 
8:186:13868:27:28:89:502:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:government. Overall, the data in this table show that tuition payments fall far short of 
8:187:13957:28:27:89:254:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:covering total educational costs.3  
8:188:13993:27:28:125:497:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:As shown in the final columns of Table 1, there are substantial differences in 
8:189:14072:28:28:89:513:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tuition prices between in-state and out-of-state tuition charges4 and between private and 
8:190:14162:28:27:89:500:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:public institutions. For this reason, public colleges and universities within a potential 
8:191:14252:27:28:89:502:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:student’s state of residence are the institutions determining the choice set for students 
8:192:14342:28:27:89:498:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:likely to be at the margin of college enrollment and completion.  Private institutions, 
8:193:14430:27:28:89:496:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:particularly the selective colleges and research universities, also rely heavily on non-
8:194:14518:28:28:89:464:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tuition sources of revenue, including donations and income from endowment. 
8:195:14593:28:27:89:501:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Nevertheless, the selective private institutions with substantial subsidies enroll a very 
8:196:14683:27:28:89:314:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:small share of the undergraduate population.5  
8:197:14730:28:27:125:503:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Non-tuition revenue affects the tradeoff between enrollment and resources per 
8:198:14808:27:28:89:476:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:student faced by colleges and universities and is critical to explaining how these 
8:199:14891:28:28:89:516:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:institutions respond to changes in the demand for higher education. We develop a model 
8:200:14978:28:27:89:503:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that applies to a range of colleges and universities, including open-access institutions,

8:202:15116:8:16:125:489:204:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:3 Estimates by Winston mentioned earlier place the degree of subsidy even higher because 
8:203:15205:16:11:89:510:188:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:conventional statements of revenues and expenses for colleges and universities fail to account for capital 
8:204:15312:11:12:89:491:177:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:costs (both depreciation and the opportunity cost of funds), which account for an average of 25% of 
8:205:15412:12:7:89:165:165:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:educational costs.  
8:206:15432:7:16:125:489:158:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:4 For 2005-2006, the average ratio of in-state tuition to out-of-state tuition at state flagship 
8:207:15529:16:11:89:510:142:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:universities was .37, amounting to an average tuition price difference of $10,558; in states where there is 
8:208:15637:11:12:89:517:131:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:considerable demand for out-of-state students, differences between in-state and out-of-state undergraduate 
8:209:15744:12:11:89:518:119:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:charges are much larger, with differences of  $19,882 and $18,388 in Colorado and Michigan, respectively 
8:210:15849:11:7:89:417:108:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:for 2005-2006 (Washington State Higher Education Coordinating Board, 2006).   
8:211:15927:7:16:125:504:101:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:5 While the state-level is the appropriate unit of analysis for the consideration of the collegiate 
8:212:16027:16:0:89:489:85:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:attainment of students likely to be at the margin of degree attainment, the most competitive level of 
9:213:16130:0:28:89:510:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:flagship universities, and private colleges.  Variation among institutions in mission and 
9:214:16220:28:28:89:483:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:objectives, as well as resources, produce somewhat different predicted behavioral 
9:215:16302:28:27:89:259:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:adjustments by type of institution.

9:217:16362:28:27:125:502:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:On the supply side of the market, colleges and universities combine their own 
9:218:16440:27:28:89:516:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:resources with the energies of their students to produce collegiate attainment. University 
9:219:16531:28:28:89:519:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:revenues, representing the sum of tuition, fees, and public and private subsidies, are used 
9:220:16623:28:27:89:518:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to purchase inputs like faculty, libraries and dormitories.   The essential choices made by 
9:221:16715:27:28:89:516:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the colleges and universities are the number of students to admit and enroll and the level 
9:222:16806:28:27:89:510:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of resources to invest per student, subject to the university’s own budget constraint and 
9:223:16896:27:28:89:511:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the level of student demand, which is a function of the quality (or resource intensity) of 
9:224:16987:28:28:89:480:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the education offered. Generating more money either through tuition revenues or 
9:225:17067:28:27:89:510:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:subsidies implies having more resources to spend on instruction.  When the non-tuition 
9:226:17154:27:28:89:507:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:share of revenues does not vary proportionately with the number of students, enrolling 
9:227:17240:28:27:89:511:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:more students necessarily implies spreading these resources more thinly.  In short, with 
9:228:17329:27:28:89:497:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the presence of non-tuition revenue, colleges and universities face a quality-quantity

9:230:17503:28:27:89:170:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:prevailing price. 
9:231:17521:27:28:125:522:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Student demand varies, as usual, with price – the higher the price, ceteris paribus, 
9:232:17606:28:27:89:496:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the lower the share of the population attending college. Demand also varies with the 
9:233:17691:27:28:89:519:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:subsidy per student (L/n, where L is the total non-tuition revenue and n is enrollment), as 
9:234:17783:28:31:89:492:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:students would clearly prefer to pay a given price to attend an institution with more 
9:235:17869:31:12:89:524:98:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                                                                                                                 
9:236:18013:12:12:89:502:86:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:colleges and universities (e.g., Stanford University, Harvard University) define a highly integrated and 
9:237:18118:12:0:89:506:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:national market that is unlikely to include students at the margin of college enrollment (Hoxby, 2000).

10:250:18508:27:28:89:470:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:non-distribution constraint, which applies to both public and private non-profit

10:258:18761:39:28:89:505:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reflects per-student costs as a function of quality (or resources), with c’(q)>0 and total 
10:259:18852:28:27:89:518:430:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:costs of n c(q). It follows that the per-student cost of the quality of education provided is 
10:260:18946:27:28:89:509:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:simply equal to tuition plus the per-student subsidy (L/n). Although the presentation of 
10:261:19035:28:28:89:507:375:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tuition revenue as endogenous (determined by the inverse demand function for college 
10:262:19120:28:43:89:511:347:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:enrollment) may capture the circumstances of some private institutions, it is unlikely to

10:264:19258:7:16:125:507:297:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:6 Comparison of tuition levels among private institutions makes this point clear. In 2005-2006, 
10:265:19354:16:12:89:514:281:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Tufts University had tuition and required fee charges of $32,621  while Harvard University posted tuition 
10:266:19460:12:11:89:507:269:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and fees of $32,092. With an endowment of $25.4 billion at Harvard relative to the Tufts endowment of 
10:267:19562:11:12:89:511:258:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:$845 million, it should be no surprise that demand revealed by application behavior is greater at Harvard 
10:268:19668:12:7:89:147:246:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:than at Tufts.  
10:269:19684:7:15:125:498:239:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:7 This inverse demand curve should be thought of as institution specific.  Institution-specific 
10:270:19780:15:12:89:521:224:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:demand is not infinitely elastic with respect to either tuition levels or quality because individual institutions 
10:271:19894:12:7:89:224:212:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:have considerable market power. 
10:272:19926:7:16:125:520:205:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:8 This model builds on Hansmann’s (1981) effort to illustrate the potential quality-quantity choice 
10:273:20026:16:12:89:493:189:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:for a performing arts organization when private donations depend on the quality of the presentation.  
10:274:20128:12:11:89:516:177:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Implicitly we are assuming constant returns to scale, which we think of as a reasonable assumption for the 
10:275:20235:11:11:89:500:166:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:long run.  Also, we focus only on the choices surrounding undergraduate education, though one might 
10:276:20335:11:7:89:417:155:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:rightly consider other educational outputs such as research or graduate education. 
10:277:20418:7:17:125:508:148:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:9 In some states, a component of state funding for higher education depends on enrollment. For 
10:278:20513:17:11:89:513:131:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:simplicity, we have ignored this fact. What is important is the L rises less than proportionately with n and 
10:279:20622:11:12:89:513:120:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:this is always true. The model explains the response of students and college administrations to changes in 
10:280:20729:12:11:89:513:108:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the size of the college-age population. Additionally, one might imagine that the cost of producing a given 
10:281:20836:11:11:89:519:97:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:level of quality, c, would depend not just on the level of quality produced, but also on enrollment rates – as 
10:282:20947:11:12:89:498:86:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:enrollment rates rise, selectivity falls. Letting c be a function of q and n/pop, rather than just q, would 
10:283:21055:12:0:89:278:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:complicate without changing the basic story.    
11:284:21105:0:28:89:491:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:apply to public colleges and universities where state legislators and governors have 
11:285:21190:28:28:89:339:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:considerable sway in the determination of tuition.10 
11:286:21242:28:27:125:514:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The nonlinear constraint showing the tradeoff between enrollment and resources 
11:287:21321:27:28:89:514:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:per student provides much of the intuition for analyzing the institutional adjustment to a 
11:288:21412:28:27:89:494:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:demand shock. The constraint, illustrated in Figure 1 for the case in which tuition is 
11:289:21499:27:28:89:496:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:determined exogenously, is nonlinear and asymptotes at the level of quality equal to 
11:290:21584:28:28:89:520:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tuition, as the number of students enrolled goes to infinity.11 At low levels of enrollment, 
11:291:21677:28:27:89:504:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the price of expansion is high as the relative change in per-student resource subsidy is 
11:292:21766:27:28:89:497:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:substantial. At higher levels of enrollment (and lower levels of quality), the quantity-
11:293:21854:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:quality tradeoff is less pronounced as per-student subsidy becomes a tiny piece of the cost 
11:294:21946:27:28:89:284:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of education for any individual student.  
11:295:21988:28:28:125:490:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Universities face a choice in the production of college education, implicitly 
11:296:22066:28:27:89:485:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:weighing a tradeoff between the quantity variable (or the output of the enrollment 
11:297:22149:27:28:89:509:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:decision) and the resources spent per student. How colleges and universities weigh this 
11:298:22237:28:27:89:509:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tradeoff depends on their specific “mission” (e.g., the University of Michigan has been 
11:299:22325:27:28:89:517:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:given different objectives by the state than Central Michigan University) and their initial 
11:300:22417:28:28:89:522:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:levels of endowment or fixed subsidy. We assume that institutions maximize an objective 
11:301:22505:28:27:89:507:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:function that includes both quantity (n) and quality (q) components – U(n,q) subject to

11:304:22671:7:16:125:493:169:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:10 A survey of State Higher Education Executive Officers finds that legislatures in 10 states 
11:305:22765:16:12:89:491:153:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:explicitly set tuition in practice or in statute (Christal, 1997). In other states, tuition determination is 
11:306:22874:12:11:89:520:141:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:generally the responsibility of governing boards or state higher education authorities, with these authorities 
11:307:22985:11:7:89:387:130:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:often composed of political appointees (Kane, Orszag, and Gunter, 2003). 
11:308:23058:7:16:125:519:123:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:11 The basic “shape” of the constraint would be the same with the endogenous treatment of tuition 
11:309:23156:16:21:89:518:107:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:though the slope would be steeper and the function would “flatten” at a greater rate. With tuition fixed, the 
11:310:23266:21:0:89:416:86:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f3:slope of the constraint is 2/nL-, while endogenous tuition yields 2212

12:329:23529:28:27:89:517:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:revenues. Some institutional leaders may have ambitions to upgrade quality while others

12:332:23786:27:28:89:499:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:changes in subsidy, brought about by state fiscal shocks will depend on the objective 
12:333:23872:28:28:89:521:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:function governing the behavior of the university and the level of subsidy available to the 
12:334:23964:28:27:89:516:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:university. At one extreme, potentially representative of the public research universities, 
12:335:24056:27:28:89:487:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:institutions weigh the tradeoff between quantity and quality directly and choose to 
12:336:24140:28:27:89:453:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:operate at the tangency between the institutional indifference curve and the 
12:337:24217:27:28:89:505:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nondistribution constraint (illustrated in the top panel of Figure 1). In such a situation, 
12:338:24309:28:28:89:508:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:enrollment may be independent of student demand (with the demand function crossing 
12:339:24392:28:27:89:494:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the constraint at or to the right of the tangency). Shifts in demand do not change the 
12:340:24479:27:28:89:510:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:optimal enrollment-quality choice of the institution, but rather lead to or exacerbate the 
12:341:24570:28:27:89:232:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:condition of excess demand.  
12:342:24599:27:28:125:523:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In the alternative case where institutions simply maximize enrollment, the level of 
12:343:24683:28:28:89:518:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:enrollment (and the quality of the collegiate experience) is determined at the intersection 
12:344:24775:28:27:89:475:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the demand function and the constraint in quality-enrollment space.  Without 
12:345:24855:27:28:89:512:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:compensating increases in subsidy (L), which would shift out the constraint, the shift in

12:348:25122:28:28:89:514:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:panel); along the downward sloping part of the constraint, the change in enrollment will 
12:349:25211:28:0:89:521:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:be less than the shift in demand. What is more, quality (resources per student) declines as 
13:350:25305:0:28:89:515:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:quantity (enrollment) increases along the constraint. Note that, in addition to the decline 
13:351:25397:28:28:89:479:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in enrollment, this decline in resources per student will have a negative effect on 
13:352:25481:28:27:89:486:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:collegiate attainment so long as resources are an input in the collegiate production 
13:353:25566:27:28:89:134:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:process.  
13:354:25576:28:27:125:518:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The implication of the model is clear: unless resources increase to match changes 
13:355:25658:27:28:89:492:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in demand, increases in cohort size are likely to lead to lower proportional levels of 
13:356:25745:28:28:89:517:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:college enrollment and completion. Increases in cohort size will lead to reductions in the 
13:357:25836:28:27:89:472:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:share of the cohort receiving BA (undergraduate) degrees because colleges and 
13:358:25914:27:28:89:500:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:universities must trade resources per student, which include substantial subsidies, for 
13:359:26002:28:27:89:500:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:larger enrollments. The extent to which institutions respond to changes in cohort size 
13:360:26089:27:28:89:492:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with adjustments in resources per student, tuition price, and enrollment will depend 
13:361:26174:28:28:89:515:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:significantly on the mission and control of the college and university. In this section, we 
13:362:26266:28:27:89:516:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:highlight the circumstances of public institutions because they enroll the largest share of 
13:363:26358:27:28:89:512:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:higher education students and are central to the market; yet, for reasons given, the basic 
13:364:26449:28:27:89:429:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:insights apply more broadly to all non-profit colleges and universities.

13:377:26859:28:28:89:516:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on where the institution begins on the budget constraint (e.g., on the steep portion where

14:381:27083:0:27:89:364:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:II. Cohort Size and College Completion within States 
14:382:27135:27:28:125:518:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our empirical approach begins with the measurement of the relationship between 
14:383:27214:28:27:89:499:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cohort size and college completion within states.  States are a natural unit of analysis 
14:384:27303:27:28:89:493:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:because public institutions of higher education are largely under the control of state 
14:385:27390:28:27:89:499:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:governments.  By looking at changes within states over time, we abstract from broad 
14:386:27474:27:28:89:509:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:national changes.  While aggregate adjustments in cohort size may affect the returns to 
14:387:27562:28:28:89:510:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:college, within-state variation in cohort size should not affect returns in the presence of 
14:388:27654:28:27:89:277:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nationally integrated labor markets.12   
14:389:27695:27:28:125:522:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The empirical analysis in this section focuses on the measurement of the elasticity 
14:390:27779:28:27:89:514:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of college completion, defined as the log of BA degrees awarded, with respect to cohort 
14:391:27867:27:28:89:504:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:size. The state is the unit of analysis and all specifications include state and year fixed 
14:392:27959:28:28:89:505:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:effects.   Thus, regression estimates of collegiate attainment of a cohort on cohort size 
14:393:28049:28:27:89:513:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:examine whether the collegiate outcome of a cohort differs when that state and cohort’s 
14:394:28137:27:28:89:393:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:population changes at a rate different from the national norm.   
14:395:28202:28:27:125:497:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Given our interest in how cohort size affects the resources available to those  
14:396:28282:27:28:89:487:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:considering college attendance, it is natural to measure cohort size at a point when 
14:397:28367:28:28:89:498:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:individuals would typically attend college (age 18). We would then like to be able to 
14:398:28453:28:27:89:514:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:calculate the fraction of these cohorts that eventually receive a BA degree. Such data do 
14:399:28543:27:28:89:519:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:not exist.  Measures are available from colleges and universities enumerating the number 
14:400:28632:28:7:89:236:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                 
14:401:28680:7:16:125:520:177:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:12 Larger cohorts may experience somewhat lower returns to education if the substitution between 
14:402:28777:16:12:89:511:161:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:younger and older workers among the college educated is less than complete, thus reducing incentives to 
14:403:28881:12:11:89:513:149:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:complete college in aggregate. A long research literature (e.g., Welch, 1979; Stapleton and Young, 1988) 
14:404:28986:11:12:89:518:138:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:focuses on the question of how adjustments of the labor market to relatively large cohorts affect incentives 
14:405:29095:12:11:89:513:126:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:to invest in education for relatively large cohorts.  Using Census data, we find no evidence of variation in 
14:406:29204:11:12:89:496:115:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:state-specific college/high school wage differentials with cohort size. In addition, while state specific 
14:407:29310:12:11:89:512:103:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:cohort size is (negatively) associated with state specific unemployment rates, we also find no evidence of 
14:408:29417:11:0:89:510:92:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:any association between unemployment and college completion rates (see also Card and Lemieux, 2000; 
15:409:29519:0:28:89:519:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of degrees conferred each year (we refer to this as “institutional data”). Alternatively, the 
15:410:29613:28:28:89:517:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:decennial Census allows researchers to calculate degree completion by state of birth, but 
15:411:29703:28:27:89:506:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:does not identify state of residence at age 18.   Using both sources of data allows us to 
15:412:29793:27:28:89:520:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:check the potential effect of the differences between the two data sets on our estimates of 
15:413:29885:28:27:89:147:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:crowding.   
15:414:29896:27:28:125:520:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We begin with the presentation of results based on institutional data and then turn 
15:415:29980:28:28:89:489:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to results employing Census data. Finally, we discuss possible explanations for the 
15:416:30064:28:27:89:483:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:differences between the two sets of results.  In the main, results using Census and 
15:417:30148:27:28:89:525:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:institutional data tell a very similar story: increases in cohort size are not accompanied by  
15:418:30243:28:27:89:334:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:commensurate increases in collegiate attainment.

15:421:30331:28:27:125:491:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Table 2 begins the empirical analysis with the estimation of the elasticity of 
15:422:30410:27:28:89:501:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:college completion, defined as the log of BA degrees awarded, with respect to cohort 
15:423:30495:28:27:89:497:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:size, defined as the size of the population age 18 within the state four years earlier.13 
15:424:30584:27:28:89:519:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Estimates are presented for two periods: 1954-1996 and 1967-1996. Columns (1) and (2) 
15:425:30670:28:28:89:522:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:show that the elasticity of college completion at all institutions with respect to cohort size 
15:426:30765:28:27:89:478:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is significantly less than one, varying from .71 to .62 depending on the period of 
15:427:30848:27:28:89:521:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:observation.  In addition, the estimate in column (3) for the effect of cohort size at age 18 
15:428:30942:28:52:89:522:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on the number of degrees awarded by public institutions is broadly similar to the estimate 
15:429:31033:52:12:89:524:132:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                                                                                                                 
15:430:31177:12:12:89:519:120:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Fitzpatrick and Turner, 2006).  These estimates suggest that the primary effect of variation in state-specific 
15:431:31288:12:7:89:533:108:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f4:college-age population size on college completion rates cannot be working through labor market incentives.     
15:432:31398:7:15:125:522:101:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:13  Thus, for example, we related BA’s produced in Michigan in 1990 to the size of the 18 year old 
15:433:31497:15:12:89:497:86:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:population in the state in 1986.  The choice of this four year lag was dictated by the fact that 22 is the 
15:434:31604:12:0:89:335:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:modal age at which individuals receive their BA in the U.S.   
16:435:31668:0:28:89:544:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of overall effect (.59 vs. .62) over the period for which this distinction is possible.14                  
16:436:31775:28:28:89:507:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Another variable of interest in measuring higher educational attainment is enrollment.  
16:437:31863:28:27:89:519:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Enrollment represents an “input” to educational attainment while degrees awarded are an 
16:438:31951:27:28:89:489:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:outcome. For this reason, we regard degrees received rather than enrollment as our 
16:439:32034:28:27:89:523:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:primary outcome and would expect effects of cohort size on enrollment to be more muted 
16:440:32121:27:28:89:497:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:than the effects on degree completion. Using measures of total enrollment presents a 
16:441:32206:28:28:89:515:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:story similar to the regressions for degree outcomes.  With the log of total enrollment as 
16:442:32297:28:27:89:496:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the outcome in columns (4)-(6) of Table 2, estimates of the elasticity with respect to 
16:443:32384:27:28:89:519:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cohort size are larger for enrollment (0.89 and 0.79), while still appreciably less than one 
16:444:32477:28:27:89:222:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in all of the specifications.  
16:445:32508:27:28:125:497:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Figure 2 plots per-year cohort size and BA production from 1950 to 1995 for 
16:446:32584:28:28:89:506:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:selected states. (Similar figures for all states appear in the appendix). It is important to 
16:447:32677:28:27:89:514:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:note that while the regressions we reported in Table 2 took out year effects, much of the 
16:448:32767:27:28:89:523:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:observed variation in these figures represents the growth and decline of the overall size of 
16:449:32860:28:27:89:505:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the college-aged population.  For each of the states shown, the 1950s and 1960s saw a 
16:450:32946:27:28:89:485:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:very dramatic rise in both cohort size and the number of individuals receiving BA 
16:451:33028:28:28:89:514:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:degrees. However, around 1970 BA production leveled off and remained approximately 
16:452:33111:28:27:89:493:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:constant in the subsequent 25 years, despite an expansion in cohort size through the 
16:453:33196:27:28:89:495:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:1980s and a drop in cohort size thereafter. The figures give the strong impression of 
16:454:33282:28:27:89:502:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:capacity constraints and the absence of full elasticity in supply. During the 1950s and 
16:455:33370:27:37:89:493:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:1960s many states were investing heavily in higher education. As a result, capacity,

16:458:33597:16:11:89:512:97:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:smaller private higher education sectors would be different from those in states with larger private higher 
16:459:33705:11:12:89:481:86:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:education sectors. Interacting cohort size with an indicator for states with public higher education 
16:460:33806:12:0:89:349:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:enrollment below the median does not yield a significant effect.  
17:461:33874:0:28:89:502:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:enrollments, and BA production expanded rapidly. Starting in the 1970s, investments 
17:462:33958:28:28:89:417:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:leveled off and capacity and enrollments remained relatively fixed.  
17:463:34027:28:27:125:506:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The pattern observed in Figure 2 suggests that, while BA production might not 
17:464:34105:27:28:89:501:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:have dropped much during periods when cohort size was shrinking, it would increase 
17:465:34188:28:27:89:493:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:during periods when cohort size was increasing. This kind of asymmetric pattern of 
17:466:34271:27:28:89:485:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:adjustment might arise if it were politically harder to shrink than to expand higher 
17:467:34356:28:28:89:496:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:education. To check on this notion, we re-estimated our regression models using the 
17:468:34440:28:27:89:516:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:period before and after 1970. The point estimates suggest that, if anything, crowding out 
17:469:34530:27:28:89:502:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(i.e., the less-than-proportional increase in BA production relative to cohort size) was 
17:470:34619:28:27:89:502:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:more severe before 1970s than it was after, though the difference was not statistically 
17:471:34707:27:28:89:489:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:significant.  More generally, our results do not depend on the period or set of years 
17:472:34793:28:28:89:193:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:chosen for analysis.   
17:473:34816:28:27:125:473:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Still, there are a number of reasons why the institutional measure of BA 
17:474:34889:27:28:89:515:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:production regressed on cohort size at age 18 might tend to exaggerate the magnitude of 
17:475:34977:28:27:89:516:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cohort crowding. It would not be too surprising to find that being born into a large (state-
17:476:35069:27:28:89:513:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:specific) cohort would tend to increase the odds that a person went out of state to attend 
17:477:35160:28:28:89:513:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:college or temporarily postponed going to college. In either case our estimates based on 
17:478:35249:28:27:89:488:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the institutional data, would overstate the magnitude of the effect of cohort size on 
17:479:35335:27:28:89:503:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:college completion (crowding). The Residence and Migration survey, which has been 
17:480:35417:28:27:89:511:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:conducted periodically by the Department of Education since the 1940s, provides some 
17:481:35502:27:28:89:521:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:information on enrollment by state of residence and college. We estimate the elasticity of 
17:482:35593:28:28:89:479:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:total enrollment at the state level with respect to population [0.61 (0.11)] and the 
17:483:35678:28:0:89:493:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:elasticity of enrollment of state residents with respect to population [0.62 (0.08)]. If 
18:484:35769:0:28:89:483:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:increased out-of-state enrollment were a substantial part of the response to cohort 
18:485:35853:28:28:89:513:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:expansion, we would see larger elasticities (closer to 1) for enrollment of state residents 
18:486:35945:28:27:89:492:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:than for total enrollment in the state. Yet, the elasticities for these two measures are 
18:487:36034:27:28:89:497:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:virtually identical. The available empirical evidence does not support the notion that 
18:488:36121:28:27:89:516:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relatively large cohorts of college students are “absorbed” by neighboring states. In fact, 
18:489:36213:27:28:89:518:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:it appears that the enrollment behavior of state residents is closely tied to in-state college 
18:490:36308:28:28:89:494:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:opportunities, with elasticities very close to the estimates using the full panel of BA 
18:491:36396:28:27:89:213:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:degree data in Table 2.15  
18:492:36423:27:28:125:502:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In addition, it seems plausible that time to degree may tend to rise with cohort 
18:493:36504:28:27:89:491:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:size. If college-age individuals in large cohorts face fewer resources, they may find 
18:494:36590:27:28:89:511:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:college less attractive, and marginal students might delay college enrollment.16 What is 
18:495:36679:28:28:89:515:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:more, fewer resources might translate into slower progress while in school. Empirically, 
18:496:36768:28:27:89:520:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:calculations using the Current Population Survey suggest that increasing cohort size does 
18:497:36858:27:28:89:509:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:increase the age at degree receipt17, though the magnitude of this effect is by no means 
18:498:36947:28:27:89:519:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:large enough to explain the overall effect on completion rates. One concern is that, in the 
18:499:37039:27:28:89:513:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:institutional measures of degree attainment, increases in time to degree will tend to bias 
18:500:37130:28:28:89:499:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:estimates of the effect of cohort size on the number of BAs produced per cohort; yet, 
18:501:37216:28:38:89:495:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:such errors should be offsetting as time to degree expands and contracts with cohort 
18:502:37301:38:7:89:236:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                 
18:503:37349:7:17:125:523:194:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:15 Focusing on just the flagships schools, we do find that out-of-state enrollment tends to fall in the 
18:504:37453:17:11:89:521:177:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:face of large cohorts; however this effect is small enough and the flagship schools represent a small enough 
18:505:37562:11:11:89:496:166:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:share of total enrollment, that this pattern hardly shows up when we combine data on all colleges and 
18:506:37664:11:7:89:142:155:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f4:universities.  
18:507:37678:7:17:125:488:148:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:16 If shifts in population size occurred at fairly high frequency, individuals who are part of 
18:508:37773:17:11:89:519:131:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:particularly large cohorts might find it optimal to postpone college for several years. However, this kind of 
18:509:37883:11:12:89:507:120:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:substitution is unlikely to be plausible in large scale as, as we will see, most of the movements in cohort 
18:510:37991:12:11:89:507:108:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:size observed occur at relatively low frequency. Moreover, such inter-temporal adjustment would likely 
18:511:38094:11:11:89:506:97:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:reduce the number of years over which an individual would get the benefits of a college education, thus 
18:512:38198:11:7:89:227:86:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:reducing the return to the degree.  
18:513:38234:7:0:125:429:79:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:17 Falaris and Peters (1992) find similar patterns using NLS and PSID data. 
19:514:38312:0:28:89:512:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:size.18 All in all, we doubt these inter-temporal substitution effects have much effect on 
19:515:38403:28:28:89:165:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:our estimates.   
19:516:38420:28:27:125:477:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We should note that with the census data we can directly measure cohort 
19:517:38492:27:28:89:508:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:completion rates.  As a result, effects of cohort size on the location or timing of degree 
19:518:38583:28:27:89:492:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:completion will not affect our estimates of the relationship between cohort size and 
19:519:38668:27:28:89:190:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:degree completion.   
19:520:38689:28:28:89:239:543:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Results Based on Census Data 
19:521:38718:28:27:125:498:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:An alternative way to measure the effect of cohort size on degree completion 
19:522:38795:27:28:89:521:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:employs Census micro data on BA completion rates, organized by state of birth withbirth 
19:523:38883:28:27:89:516:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cohort size as the relevant demographic variable.19 Using alternative data sources serves 
19:524:38973:27:28:89:480:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to underscore the reliability of our results while necessarily answering somewhat 
19:525:39055:28:28:89:513:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:different questions. Table 3 presents estimates of the effects of cohort size (measured in 
19:526:39146:28:27:89:497:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:terms of year and state of birth) on degree completion using Census data, along with 
19:527:39231:27:8:89:236:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                 
19:528:39279:8:16:125:522:342:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:18 A simple example will illustrate. Suppose that the fraction of a cohort ultimately receiving a BA 
19:529:39380:16:11:89:492:326:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:remains constant, but cohort size grows at a rate of 1% per year. Also suppose that, as a result of the 
19:530:39484:11:12:89:505:315:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:increase in cohort size, the age at which individuals typically receive their BA rises from 22 to 23 years 
19:531:39591:12:11:89:520:303:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:over a 10-year period. During this period we would observe an approximate 10% increase in the size of the 
19:532:39697:11:12:89:514:292:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:population, but only a 9% increase in the size of the number of BAs. As a result, we would underestimate 
19:533:39802:12:11:89:513:280:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f3:-ln(BA) / - ln(Pop) by about 10% – or estimate crowd out when none exists. This example might make it 
19:534:39904:11:12:89:509:269:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:seem as if the data we are using will lead us to overestimate crowd out effects. However, if one runs this 
19:535:40011:12:11:89:517:257:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:thought experiment in reverse, one sees that during periods of declining cohort size (and decreased time to 
19:536:40119:11:12:89:518:246:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:degree), we will tend to overestimate -ln(BA) / - ln(Pop). Since the variables we use in our regressions are 
19:537:40228:12:11:89:519:234:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:all deviations from year and state means, some states will be experiencing increases in cohort size (relative 
19:538:40338:11:12:89:522:223:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:to the mean), while others are experiencing decreases in cohort size, and the bias introduced by the fact that 
19:539:40449:12:7:89:380:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:we are using period rather than cohort measures will tend to cancel out.  
19:540:40523:7:16:125:509:204:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:19 Note that when we use Census micro data organized by state and year of birth to measure the 
19:541:40618:16:11:89:507:188:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:college completion rates, the regression estimates with the dependent variable specified as a completion 
19:542:40723:11:12:89:509:177:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:rate (ln[BA/N]) are not equal to the specification in levels (ln[BA]) minus one. The reason is that that the 
19:543:40832:12:11:89:523:165:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:denominator in the measure of the completion rate, a measure of cohort size calculated from the micro data, 
19:544:40940:11:12:89:507:154:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:is not identical to the population measure from Vital Statistics sources. What we observe in the data is a 
19:545:41047:12:11:89:518:142:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:negative correlation between the error (the difference in the measures) and the measure of population from 
19:546:41154:11:12:89:503:131:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the Vital Statistics source. While the simple correlation between the population measure from the Vital 
19:547:41258:12:11:89:497:119:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Statistics and the population measure from the Census micro data is 0.996, a regression of the Census 
19:548:41360:11:12:89:523:108:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:measure on the Vital Statistics measure (both measured in logs), produces a coefficient of .952 (.0127). The 
19:549:41469:12:0:89:520:96:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:result is that regression estimates using the Census micro data in levels will produce estimates suggesting a 
20:550:41581:0:28:89:515:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:estimates of the effects on degrees conferred using the institutional data for comparison. 
20:551:41672:28:28:89:485:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Because the dependent variable for the Census-based estimates is the cohort share 
20:552:41754:28:27:89:498:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(fraction with a BA) while for the institutional-based results it is the number of BAs, 
20:553:41842:27:28:89:509:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:subtracting one from the latter results will put these two estimates on the same footing. 
20:554:41932:28:27:89:512:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Regressions of the share of the population born in each state and year with a BA degree

20:556:42113:28:28:89:509:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:decline in college completion shares with changes in cohort size. The magnitude of the 
20:557:42200:28:27:89:521:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:estimated decline when using the Census data is somewhat smaller than the magnitude of 
20:558:42287:27:28:89:521:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the decline when using the institutional data – that is -0.26 or -0.24 versus -0.34 or –0.29, 
20:559:42381:28:27:89:505:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:but the differences between the point estimates are not qualitatively important, nor are 
20:560:42470:27:28:89:239:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:they statistically significant.20  
20:561:42505:28:28:125:523:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To address the potential concern that the identification of the effect of within-state 
20:562:42592:28:27:89:519:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:changes in cohort size on degree attainment is entirely a reflection of broad demographic 
20:563:42682:27:28:89:486:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:shifts, we add state-specific linear trends to the baseline specification.  Results are

20:565:42859:27:28:89:519:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in the specifications using Census data tends to weaken the evidence for “crowding out,” 
20:566:42948:28:28:89:491:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:doing so in the specifications using institutional data strengthens it, though perhaps 
20:567:43035:28:27:89:519:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:implausibly (even columns, bottom row of Table 3).   Understanding the large difference 
20:568:43123:27:28:89:518:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:between the results based on the institutional data and the Census data with the inclusion 
20:569:43214:28:27:89:492:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of state-specific trends would certainly seem to be important. Possible explanations 
20:570:43299:27:12:89:524:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                                                                                                                 
20:571:43443:12:12:89:520:145:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:lower elasticity of completion with respect to population than related estimates with the dependent variable 
20:572:43552:12:7:89:218:133:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:specified as a completion rate.   
20:573:43586:7:16:125:520:126:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:20 These estimates are quite similar to those presented in Card and Lemieux (2000). Depending on 
20:574:43683:16:11:89:492:110:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the specification and cohorts used in their regressions, they estimate a 10% increase in cohort size is 
20:575:43787:11:12:89:497:99:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:associated with a decline in college completion of between 0.4 and 0.8 percentage points for men and 
20:576:43888:12:0:89:522:87:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:between 0.3 and 0.6 percentage points for women.  To convert these estimates into elasticities, one needs to 
21:577:43999:0:28:89:497:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:include differences between the two in the timing of the cohort-size variable and the 
21:578:44084:28:28:89:516:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:potential for significant measurement error in the state-specific measure of population at 
21:579:44175:28:27:89:130:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:age 18.  
21:580:44184:27:28:125:492:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Given our maintained hypothesis that the primary reason for the association 
21:581:44260:28:27:89:507:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:between cohort size and college completion rates involves cohort crowding at colleges 
21:582:44346:27:28:89:497:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and universities, the right measure of cohort size is the cohort size during the typical 
21:583:44435:28:28:89:513:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:college going years. Cohort size at birth can then be thought of as an error-ridden proxy 
21:584:44525:28:27:89:488:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for cohort size 18 years later. Under the assumption that the variable we wanted to 
21:585:44609:27:28:89:516:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:include in these regression was the size of the population in a person’s state of residence 
21:586:44701:28:27:89:523:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:when the person was in high school, we use Census data to calculate the magnitude of the 
21:587:44790:27:28:89:509:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:attenuation bias associated with using the size of the population in the person’s state of 
21:588:44881:28:28:89:507:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:residence at birth.  To do this we use data on 15-17 year olds in the 1960-1990 Census 
21:589:44968:28:27:89:504:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and regress the log of current state-specific cohort size on the log of the person’s state 
21:590:45059:27:28:89:505:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:specific birth cohort size, controlling for state and year effects.  The coefficient on the 
21:591:45151:28:27:89:498:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:birth cohort variable in these regressions is 0.56 (0.10), implying a downward bias if 
21:592:45238:27:28:89:507:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:44%.  Once state specific trends are included in the regression, the coefficient drops to 
21:593:45328:28:28:89:500:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:0.30 (0.06), implying a downward bias of 70%.  We use these estimates to adjust our 
21:594:45412:28:27:89:520:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Census-based estimates, with corrected estimates reported in the second row of Table 3.   
21:595:45502:27:28:89:506:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:These corrected results are remarkably consistent across specifications and years – the 
21:596:45590:28:27:89:475:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:estimates imply that a 10% increase in state specific cohort size reduces college 
21:597:45672:27:59:89:518:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:completion rates by about 4%.   The corrected Census based estimates are also similar in 
21:598:45761:59:12:89:524:98:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                                                                                                                 
21:599:45905:12:12:89:498:86:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:divide by the average fraction receiving a BA in these cohorts – somewhat more than 0.2 for men and 
21:600:46005:12:0:89:238:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:somewhat less than 0.2 for women.   
22:601:46043:0:28:89:508:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:magnitude to the estimates based on institutional data that do not include state-specific 
22:602:46133:28:28:89:130:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:trends.   
22:603:46143:28:27:125:520:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Because including state-specific trends eliminates more than 80% of the variation 
22:604:46225:27:28:89:506:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in our key explanatory variable, one natural hypothesis is that the introduction of state-
22:605:46315:28:27:89:513:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:specific trends seriously exacerbates the impact of measurement error in our cohort size 
22:606:46404:27:28:89:505:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:measures on outcomes. The intercensal estimates of cohort size at age 18 are based on 
22:607:46490:28:28:89:510:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:imputations that, importantly, involve Census estimates of migration flows, which may 
22:608:46576:28:27:89:518:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reflect divergence from the actual level of the population within a state in a given year.21 
22:609:46668:27:28:89:483:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Gauging the direct effect of these errors on our estimates would be difficult if not 
22:610:46753:28:27:89:522:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:impossible.   Notably, the Vital Statistic data that we use to construct the birth cohort size 
22:611:46848:27:28:89:490:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:variables used in our analysis of Census data does not suffer from the same kind of 
22:612:46932:28:28:89:356:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:measurement error problems generated by imputation.  
22:613:46985:28:27:125:505:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Regressions that use institutional measures of degree attainment (without state-
22:614:47065:27:28:89:515:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:specific trends) produce estimates of the effect of cohort size on college completion that 
22:615:47156:28:27:89:520:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are close to the ones we obtain using Census data adjusted for the imperfect link between 
22:616:47246:27:28:89:478:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cohort size at birth and the size of cohorts at the time of college entry.  With this 
22:617:47332:28:28:89:492:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:adjustment, Census-based estimates produce nearly the same estimated elasticity of 
22:618:47415:28:27:89:493:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:college completion with and without state-specific trends, and these point estimates 
22:619:47500:27:28:89:525:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:actually suggest slightly more crowding than those estimates relying on institutional data.  
22:620:47593:28:27:89:490:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Overall, these results are consistent with the interpretation that the “crowding” that 
22:621:47680:27:28:89:270:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:matters occurs at the collegiate level.

22:623:47768:7:16:125:522:122:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:21 Some evidence on the magnitude of the errors introduced by the census imputations comes from 
22:624:47864:16:12:89:490:106:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:comparing estimates based on imputations to estimates based on actual enumerations. Comparisons 
22:625:47960:12:0:89:511:94:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:between Census projections of the college-age population in each state in 2000 benchmarked to the 1990

23:627:48120:28:28:125:484:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Geographic shifts in the location of economic activity in the U.S. generate 
23:628:48196:28:27:89:513:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:migration across states, with regions in the South and West growing much more rapidly 
23:629:48282:27:28:89:518:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:than those in the North East and North Central, and generate much of the variation in the 
23:630:48372:28:27:89:511:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cohort size measures. Geographic mobility of adults of childbearing age and those with 
23:631:48459:27:28:89:487:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:children generates changes in the size of the pool of potential college-age students 
23:632:48544:28:28:89:515:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:within-states some years later. Indeed, the within-state-and-year correlation between the 
23:633:48634:28:27:89:510:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:size of the 18-year old population and employment (both measured in logs) is 0.72 (the 
23:634:48721:27:28:89:451:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:correlation between the size of the birth cohort and employment is 0.67).    
23:635:48798:28:27:125:517:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To get a perspective on the time series properties or our population measures, we 
23:636:48880:27:28:89:515:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:employ Fourier decomposition following Baker, Benjamin, and Stanger (1999), and we  
23:637:48964:28:28:89:495:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:find the vast majority of the total variation in the data in the low frequency range.22  
23:638:49053:28:27:89:496:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Indeed, with either population variable, over two-thirds of the variance occurs at the 
23:639:49140:27:28:89:517:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lowest two frequencies identified in the data (frequencies corresponding to periods of 44 
23:640:49230:28:27:89:516:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and 22 years), before state specific trends are taken out.  Even with the inclusion of state 
23:641:49323:27:28:89:485:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:specific trends, three-fifths of the variation occurs as the lowest two frequencies.   
23:642:49410:28:28:125:514:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:State-specific shifts in the size of the college-age population tend to be slow and 
23:643:49494:28:27:89:506:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:steady and are, as a result, highly predictable. The predictable nature of changes in the 
23:644:49584:27:28:89:508:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:size of the college-age population within states and the observation that growing states 
23:645:49673:28:27:89:523:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:may experience less budgetary pressure would, at the surface, mitigate against findings of 
23:646:49764:27:12:89:524:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:

23:648:50008:12:7:89:182:133:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:being as large as 20%! 
23:649:50031:7:16:125:524:126:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:22  With 43 years of data (1954-1996), we employ the Fourier decomposition to divide the measure 
23:650:50128:16:0:89:478:110:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of cohort size into 22 orthogonal components at varying frequencies (from 0 to -) according to:  
24:651:50227:0:28:89:504:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:substantial crowding out at the postsecondary level.  That such effects exist, given the 
24:652:50316:28:28:89:486:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nature of the variation in cohort size, point to the importance of substantial capital 
24:653:50403:28:27:89:513:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:subsidies in higher education and the limited degree of supply-side adjustments at those 
24:654:50492:27:28:89:271:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:institutions like research universities.

24:657:50587:27:28:125:481:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To understand the mechanism behind the limited adjustment of collegiate 
24:658:50659:28:27:89:466:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:attainment with increases in cohort size, we consider the potential supply-side 
24:659:50739:27:28:89:510:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:adjustments of colleges and universities.  Potential margins of adjustment include price 
24:660:50828:28:27:89:521:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(tuition) and resources per student, with changes in these avenues potentially differing by 
24:661:50920:27:28:89:183:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:type of institution.  
24:662:50942:28:28:125:223:405:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Tuition adjustments 
24:663:50962:28:27:125:520:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:For public institutions, tuition covers such a small fraction of total costs and there 
24:664:51049:27:28:89:515:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is such an unusual link between political actors at the state level and public colleges and 
24:665:51141:28:27:89:501:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:universities that tuition (price) may not serve as a plausible channel for adjustment to 
24:666:51230:27:28:89:501:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:demand shocks and other market forces. Indeed, the evidence from regressions of the 
24:667:51314:28:28:89:497:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tuition charged to in-state students by public colleges and universities on cohort size 
24:668:51402:28:27:89:503:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:points clearly in the other direction: a 10% increase in cohort size is associated with a

25:686:52351:28:27:125:518:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Beyond tuition levels, we consider the relationship between cohort size and other 
25:687:52433:27:28:89:515:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sources of revenue, including federal support and appropriations from state sources. Not 
25:688:52522:28:28:89:500:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:surprisingly, variation in federal support to colleges and universities is quite inelastic 
25:689:52613:28:27:89:512:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with changes in cohort size, with an elasticity of about 0.27 (0.19), net of state and year 
25:690:52705:27:28:89:498:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fixed effects for the interval from 1950-1996.  State appropriations demonstrate a bit 
25:691:52792:28:27:89:490:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:more adjustment to cohort size, with an elasticity of 0.58 (0.11).24  This estimate is 
25:692:52879:27:28:89:502:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:remarkably similar to the estimates we report in Tables 2 and 3 of the effect of cohort 
25:693:52967:28:28:89:506:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:size on college completion rates, which is consistent with our notion that the source of 
25:694:53056:28:27:89:475:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:these effects is college resources.25  While we do not have a full series, it seems 
25:695:53140:27:28:89:505:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:implausible that private philanthropy would adjust perfectly to changes in cohort size. 
25:696:53228:28:27:89:504:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Given the overall enrollment elasticities in Table 2, it is clear that non-tuition revenue

25:702:53760:12:11:89:515:177:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:approaches zero, with increases in state employment having a substantial negative effect on tuition prices. 
25:703:53868:11:11:89:523:166:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:These results would seem to confirm the notion that states tend to raise tuitions when state economies are in

25:705:54016:7:17:125:498:148:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:24 The measures of state appropriations used in these regressions are from the Department of 
25:706:54109:17:11:89:498:131:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Education’s institutional survey of college and university finances which extends from 1950 to 1996.  
25:707:54211:11:12:89:519:120:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Measures of state appropriations from state-based finance surveys, which are available only after 1960, are 
25:708:54319:12:11:89:426:108:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:strongly correlated and yield a slightly smaller elasticity with respect to cohort size. 
25:709:54408:11:11:89:509:97:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:  25 As these estimates suggest, a regression of the log of the number BA degrees awarded on the 
25:710:54505:11:12:89:511:86:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:log of state appropriations (including state and year effects), using cohort size as an instrument, yields an 
25:711:54615:12:0:89:410:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:estimated coefficient that is close to and not statistically distinguishable from 1.

26:713:54783:28:28:89:501:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:types is to be expected from the differences in the objective functions of colleges and 
26:714:54871:28:27:89:491:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:universities. Community colleges and four-year institutions with modest admission 
26:715:54953:27:28:89:512:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:requirements tend to place “access” at the center of their mission, attempting to provide 
26:716:55043:28:27:89:498:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:enrollment opportunities for all applicants who meet minimum qualifications. At the 
26:717:55127:27:28:89:511:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:other extreme, research universities and liberal arts colleges are likely to emphasize the 
26:718:55218:28:28:89:493:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:role of student quality and resources per student as they make choices at the margin 
26:719:55303:28:27:89:472:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:between quality and quantity. These considerations suggest that we should find 
26:720:55382:27:28:89:503:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:substantial accommodation among two-year institutions to changes in cohort size and 
26:721:55466:28:27:89:505:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:little accommodation (and, perhaps, a ratcheting up of selectivity) among universities. 
26:722:55554:27:28:125:485:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The regression results in Table 4 show the elasticity of enrollment and BA 
26:723:55629:28:28:89:515:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:completion with respect to cohort size (measured at age 18) by type of institution. In the 
26:724:55720:28:27:89:490:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:public sector, we distinguish community colleges, flagship institutions (the highest 
26:725:55805:27:28:89:493:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ranked public university in the state), and other four-year institutions. In addition to 
26:726:55894:28:27:89:492:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:presenting the total for all private institutions, we distinguish the unique and highly 
26:727:55982:27:28:89:506:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:subsidized set of research universities and liberal arts colleges. At one extreme, cohort 
26:728:56072:28:28:89:505:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:size has a coefficient that is close to 1 at the two-year colleges, indicating that at these 
26:729:56165:28:27:89:500:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:institutions enrollment levels fluctuate markedly with changes in cohort size. Among 
26:730:56250:27:28:89:513:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:public institutions awarding at least a BA degree, the flagship institutions are much less 
26:731:56341:28:27:89:505:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:responsive in degrees awarded and enrollment to changes in cohort size than the other 
26:732:56427:27:28:89:506:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:four-year institutions. At the other extreme, the elasticity of enrollment with respect to 
26:733:56518:28:28:89:505:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cohort size is close to zero at the private liberal arts colleges and universities. (If these 
26:734:56612:28:0:89:524:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:institutions are in fact operating in a national rather than regional market, then they would 
27:735:56708:0:28:89:499:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:not face demand shocks at the state level – e.g., if there is a 10% population shock in 
27:736:56796:28:28:89:509:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:New Jersey, the change in applications to Princeton would be appreciably less than the 
27:737:56883:28:27:89:262:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:change in applications to Rutgers.)  
27:738:56920:27:28:89:515:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: The likelihood of completing college differs markedly with the institution where 
27:739:57001:28:27:89:464:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:an individual starts in the higher education pipeline, even after accounting for 
27:740:57082:27:28:89:513:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:composition differences between the student bodies. Perhaps the most visible margin of 
27:741:57169:28:28:89:508:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:differences in completion rates occurs between the two-year and four-year institutions. 
27:742:57257:28:27:89:523:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Reynolds (2006) finds that college students starting at two-year schools with the intention 
27:743:57349:27:28:89:490:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of completing a BA and observable characteristics paralleling students at four-year 
27:744:57433:28:27:89:510:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:schools are much less likely to complete the BA than their peers beginning at four-year 
27:745:57521:27:28:89:508:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:schools.26  The probability of completing a BA is 0.48 for men, relative to 0.62 among 
27:746:57608:28:28:89:503:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:students starting at four-year institutions, and 0.59 for women, relative to 0.76 among 
27:747:57696:28:27:89:513:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:students starting at four-year institutions.  It follows that part of the effect of cohort size 
27:748:57792:27:28:89:509:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on college completion rates works through the effect of cohort size on the nature of the 
27:749:57881:28:27:89:521:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:institutions students attend, with larger cohorts pushing a higher share of college students 
27:750:57974:27:28:89:497:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to community colleges and open-access four-year institutions which tend to be more 
27:751:58057:28:28:89:401:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:limited in resources per student than state flagship universities.   
27:752:58125:28:27:89:429:239:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:IV. Changes in College Preparedness and Compositional Changes 
27:753:58187:27:28:125:497:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Within states, large cohorts are less likely to complete college than relatively 
27:754:58268:28:27:89:505:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:small cohorts. As discussed, adjustments on the supply side of the market provide one 
27:755:58354:27:28:89:510:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:explanation for this result. An alternative explanation is that changes in the demand for 
27:756:58444:28:0:89:494:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:college may be reduced among relatively large cohorts if college preparation is also 
28:757:58531:0:28:89:468:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:linked to cohort size. At issue in this analysis is whether results we attribute to 
28:758:58615:28:28:89:493:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:adjustments on the supply-side of the higher education market are instead related to 
28:759:58700:28:27:89:509:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:demand-side explanations. Two related concerns surface. First, relatively large cohorts 
28:760:58788:27:28:89:489:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:may be distinguished by adverse demographic or economic shocks that have direct 
28:761:58868:28:27:89:499:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:effects on collegiate attainment. For example, if big cohorts are distinguished by low 
28:762:58955:27:28:89:509:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:parental education or large family size, such “compositional effects” might account for 
28:763:59043:28:28:89:506:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reduced college completion rather than crowding out on the supply side of the market. 
28:764:59129:28:27:89:518:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Secondly, membership in a relatively large birth cohort may dilute educational resources 
28:765:59218:27:28:89:509:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:at the elementary and secondary levels, which would also reduce college preparedness. 
28:766:59304:28:27:89:497:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Both types of effects imply that the change in college demand may be far less than a 
28:767:59389:27:28:89:200:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:change in cohort size.  
28:768:59413:28:28:125:506:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To understand how compositional factors such as race, parental education, and 
28:769:59491:28:27:89:502:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:family size are tied to cohort size, we examined 16 year-olds (as 18 year-olds are less 
28:770:59579:27:28:89:509:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:likely to appear with their parents in the data) and their parental characteristics by state 
28:771:59672:28:27:89:522:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for the 1970, 1980, and 1990 decennial Census enumerations.  Regressions of a particular 
28:772:59761:27:28:89:514:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:parental demographic characteristic (e.g., share black or number of children) on the size 
28:773:59851:28:28:89:522:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the 16-year-old population in a state and Census year, with year and state fixed effects, 
28:774:59944:28:27:89:507:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:provides an indication of how changes in cohort size are tied to observed demographic 
28:775:60030:27:28:89:468:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:characteristics. More children in a family imply fewer resources per child, and 
28:776:60110:28:27:89:520:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:educational attainment—both formal and informal—is likely to be negatively affected by

29:784:60830:28:27:125:476:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:For the most part, we find effects that are not statistically significant and 
29:785:60908:27:28:89:497:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:economically small. This applies to measures of family size, parental education, and 
29:786:60993:28:27:89:484:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ethnicity. When we weight by state size, the only significant effect is on Hispanic 
29:787:61077:27:28:89:515:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ethnicity, with a coefficient of .27 indicating that a 2.7% increase in the share of college-
29:788:61170:28:28:89:507:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:age students of Hispanic origin would follow a 10% increase in the size of the 16-year-
29:789:61257:28:27:89:499:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:old population. Even with the upper end estimates of the effect of Hispanic origin on 
29:790:61343:27:28:89:510:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:college completion, these compositional effects could not explain a sizable share of the 
29:791:61432:28:27:89:396:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reduction of college completion with increases in cohort size.27 
29:792:61496:27:28:125:494:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Individuals in relatively large cohorts may also face diminished resources in

29:796:61820:28:27:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:perspective. First, resources per student are negatively affected by increases in cohort size 
29:797:61914:27:28:89:512:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:at the elementary and secondary levels. Using data for the 1970 to 1995 period, we find 
29:798:62002:28:28:89:522:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that variation in K-12 enrollment and in average daily attendance is linked to lower levels 
29:799:62094:28:27:89:520:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of teachers per student, with coefficients -0.18 (0.06) and -0.16 (0.05) respectively which

29:803:62458:7:16:125:516:159:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:27 Additional evidence suggests that the increase in the fraction of the population that is Hispanic 
29:804:62559:16:12:89:518:143:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:can explain little, if any, of the crowd out effects we estimate.  The association between population growth 
29:805:62668:12:11:89:480:131:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and the growth in the share of the population that is Hispanic largely reflects secular trends in the

29:807:62871:7:16:125:519:113:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:28 Because it is not possible to distinguish enrollments and class size accurately at the grade level, 
29:808:62974:16:11:89:493:97:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:year and state aggregates over all elementary and secondary (K-12) enrollment form the variables of 
29:809:63074:11:12:89:523:86:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:interest.  Data are from Statistics of State School Systems (1998) for 1970-1995. Average Daily Attendance 
29:810:63181:12:0:89:510:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:is from Table 13, Fall elementary and secondary enrollment is from Table 10, and teachers per student is

30:812:63368:28:28:89:509:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:college achievement? While an increasing number of research papers find a significant 
30:813:63454:28:27:89:518:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:effect of class size on student achievement (e.g., Krueger, 1999), most of these estimates 
30:814:63545:27:28:89:506:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:measure the effect of lower class size in a single year on achievement. Because we are 
30:815:63632:28:27:89:492:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:interested in the cumulative effects of class size on educational attainment, existing 
30:816:63719:27:28:89:515:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:estimates of the effect of class size on test scores do not provide an appropriate basis for 
30:817:63812:28:28:89:482:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:inference. Instead, following Card and Krueger (1992), we use the average of the 
30:818:63893:28:27:89:515:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:potential pupil-teacher ratio faced by the student in a state. Using measures of collegiate 
30:819:63985:27:28:89:509:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:attainment from Census data, we find significant effects of the teacher-student ratio for 
30:820:64075:28:27:89:499:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:all Census years examined.29 The estimated effect of teacher-student ratio on college 
30:821:64161:27:28:89:503:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:completion for the 1926-1975 birth cohorts in the 2000 Census is large –  0.46 (0.15), 
30:822:64248:28:28:89:483:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with both collegiate attainment and resources measured in logs.  Such evidence is 
30:823:64330:28:27:89:523:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:indicative of reductions in college preparedness associated with resource declines in large 
30:824:64422:27:28:89:508:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cohorts, but likely represents an upper bound of the causal effect of the teacher student 
30:825:64512:28:27:89:503:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ratio on attainment because state-level changes in the student-teacher ration are likely 
30:826:64601:27:28:89:494:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:correlated with other policy changes affecting attainment, including lengthening the

30:846:65161:11:7:89:495:142:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:numbers include state and year effects; adding state specific trends had little impact on the estimates. 
30:847:65266:7:16:125:523:135:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:29 The dependent variable is the share of college graduates in each state and birth cohort, measured 
30:848:65367:16:12:89:495:119:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:in logarithmic form. Pupil-teacher measures were provided by Alan Krueger and reflect the potential 
30:849:65467:12:0:89:497:107:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:resources available to students in the K-12 years. All regressions include state and year fixed effects.  
31:850:65575:0:28:89:519:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:completion operating through resources is likely to be quite modest (0.07 to 0.08). While 
31:851:65665:28:28:89:509:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:demand-side effects are plainly not zero, and the impact of cohort size on precollegiate 
31:852:65754:28:27:89:519:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:academic achievement is an interesting question in its own right, these effects are plainly 
31:853:65846:27:28:89:459:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:too small to explain the entire effect of cohort size or resources on collegiate

31:856:66014:28:28:89:493:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:preparedness is not the major factor behind the strong negative association between 
31:857:66098:28:27:89:506:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f5:college completion rates and cohort size. Using data from the College Board’s Annual 
31:858:66183:27:28:89:513:488:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:Survey of Colleges, which includes institution-level characteristics of the undergraduate 
31:859:66273:28:27:89:511:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:class and admission process from 1986-2000, we found that a 10% increase in a within-
31:860:66358:27:28:89:493:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:state cohort size was associated with a roughly 1.1 (0.4) percentage point rise in the 
31:861:66445:28:28:89:472:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fraction of college students with a GPA of 3.0 or better, and a 2.9 /2.7 (0.8/0.7)

31:863:66610:27:28:89:512:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:including considerable missing data and a relatively short time horizon, we do not want 
31:864:66698:28:27:89:511:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to overemphasize these results, but they are certainly consistent with the notion that the 
31:865:66789:27:28:89:488:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dominant factor effecting the negative association between cohort size and college 
31:866:66872:28:28:89:504:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:completion rates is educational crowding out rather than lack of college preparedness.

31:869:67103:8:16:125:504:204:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:30 See Loeb and Bound (1996) for a more extensive discussion of this issue. In similar fashion 
31:870:67198:16:11:89:497:188:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Hanushek, Rivkin and Taylor (1996) argue that state level aggregation is likely to exacerbate omitted 
31:871:67300:11:7:89:330:177:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:variable bias, leading to an overstatement of causal effects.  
31:872:67363:7:16:125:514:170:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:31 An alternative way to measure the effects of cohort size on college preparedness is to measure 
31:873:67461:16:12:89:519:154:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the effect of cohort size on test scores directly. Unfortunately, NAEP scores provide only a limited number 
31:874:67569:12:11:89:494:142:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of state-specific observations over time. SAT scores at the state level may suffer from changes in the 
31:875:67672:11:12:89:514:131:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:selection of the test-taking population over time. Using data on SAT scores at the state level from 1971 to 
31:876:67780:12:11:89:479:119:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:2000, regressions of test scores on the log of cohort size with state and year fixed effects yields a 
31:877:67882:11:12:89:499:108:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:coefficient of -43.27  (18.12), implying that a 10% increase in cohort size would lead to a within-state 
31:878:67987:12:11:89:520:96:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:decrease in scores of less than 4.5 points overall.  These effects are modest in magnitude, though indicative 
31:879:68097:11:0:89:523:85:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of some reduction in college-preparedness with cohort size. More surprising is the link between the share of

32:885:68482:28:27:89:498:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:growth in out-of-state enrollment nor expansion of private enrollment is sufficient to 
32:886:68569:27:28:89:507:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:“absorb” the effects of cohort size on enrollment and attainment at public colleges and 
32:887:68657:28:28:89:521:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:universities. The available evidence suggests that this crowding out effect occurs because 
32:888:68748:28:27:89:492:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:public colleges are unable to absorb the increased demand for college education, as 
32:889:68832:27:28:89:501:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:public resources do not increase sufficiently. While it might seem plausible that large 
32:890:68920:28:27:89:520:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cohorts would reach college age less well prepared to continue their education than small 
32:891:69010:27:28:89:514:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cohorts, our estimates suggest that neither the effects of declines in school quality in the 
32:892:69103:28:28:89:519:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:elementary and secondary years nor the effects of changes in the composition of the pool 
32:893:69192:28:27:89:500:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of potential college students associated with large cohorts are  nearly large enough to 
32:894:69280:27:28:89:520:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:produce the observed negative relationship between cohort size and college completion.   
32:895:69369:28:27:125:518:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:On the supply side of the market, the reduction in college completion with cohort 
32:896:69451:27:28:89:491:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:size occurs on two margins. Among institutions, those with the greatest non-tuition 
32:897:69535:28:28:89:482:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:resources per student, such as flagship universities, are the least likely to increase 
32:898:69622:28:27:89:496:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:enrollment to accommodate relatively large cohorts; still, these universities have the 
32:899:69709:27:28:89:500:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:highest levels of college completion. To the extent that the distribution of enrollment 
32:900:69797:28:27:89:506:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:shifts away from these resource-intensive institutions, the college completion rate will 
32:901:69886:27:59:89:498:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fall. Within public institutions, those that expand to meet population-related shifts in 
32:902:69975:59:12:89:524:98:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                                                                                                                 
32:903:70119:12:12:89:514:86:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:eligible seniors taking the exam and cohort size, which is positive and significant. One explanation is that 
32:904:70228:12:0:89:419:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:colleges increase requirements for standardized tests with relatively large cohorts. 
33:905:70315:0:28:89:497:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:demand may face reductions in resources per student, further reducing attainment of 
33:906:70399:28:28:89:180:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:enrolled students.  
33:907:70419:28:27:125:518:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:While it is plain that the well-known cyclical variation in state funding for higher 
33:908:70504:27:28:89:517:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:education may have deleterious effects on public colleges and universities, it is the more 
33:909:70595:28:27:89:509:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sustained depletion in resources per student accompanying relatively large cohorts that 
33:910:70683:27:28:89:503:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:has the significant impact on collegiate attainment and the supply of college-educated 
33:911:70770:28:28:89:516:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:workers to the economy. In the coming decade, many states are facing large increases in 
33:912:70858:28:27:89:515:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the college-age population, with serious questions about the capacity of state colleges to 
33:913:70949:27:28:89:499:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:meet enrollment demand for these cohorts.32 Adding to the demographic pressure on 
33:914:71031:28:27:89:507:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:higher education resources created by increasing cohort size are persistently tight state 
33:915:71121:27:28:89:522:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:budget circumstances in which higher education competes with entitlement programs and 
33:916:71207:28:28:89:393:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the rising cost of healthcare (Kane, Orszag, and Gunter, 2003).

33:918:71351:27:28:89:512:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:education is not just a predicament for colleges and universities, but a potential crisis in 
33:919:71444:28:27:89:497:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:economic growth for decades to come if the flow of college-educated workers to the 
33:920:71527:27:28:89:479:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:labor force is further curtailed. Because tuition is a small enough part of the total 
33:921:71613:28:28:89:513:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:revenues of higher education, it would take enormous increases in tuition to provide the 
33:922:71702:28:27:89:504:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:necessary resources for colleges and universities to expand and maintain quality, with 
33:923:71789:27:28:89:512:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:such a shift adversely affecting the level and distribution of enrollment. At issue is how 
33:924:71880:28:27:89:511:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:colleges and universities, particularly in the public sector, can raise resources from non-
33:925:71971:27:37:89:503:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tuition sources to expand the pool of collegiate opportunities without diluting quality.

33:927:72108:7:16:125:512:113:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:32 For example one report estimated that the number of students seeking to enroll at California’s 
33:928:72206:16:11:89:500:97:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:public colleges would rise by 36% between 2000 and 2010. Former University of California President 
33:929:72305:11:12:89:508:86:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Clark Kerr has dubbed this projected increase in demand “Tidal Wave II” as nearly three-quarters of the 
33:930:72409:12:0:89:403:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:projected growth is strictly attributable to population growth (Schmidt, 1999).

44:1274:84650:14:14:89:515:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sources for our population measures: age-specific estimates from the Census bureau and 
44:1275:84737:14:14:89:407:545:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:measures of birth cohort size from the Vital Statistics tabulations.

44:1282:85086:13:14:125:513:449:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:For the most recent three decades, data on population by state and single year of 
44:1283:85168:14:14:89:488:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:age are available through the Bureau of the Census website. For the years between 
44:1284:85250:14:14:89:519:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Census enumerations, these numbers are estimates which take into account mortality and 
44:1285:85337:14:13:89:485:407:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:migration. See: http://eire.census.gov/popest/topics/methodology/stage98.txt for a 
44:1286:85420:13:14:89:516:394:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:discussion of this methodology. For the years before 1970, we combine data on the state 
44:1287:85508:14:14:89:518:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and single year of age enumerations published in the U.S. Census Bureau State Volumes 
44:1288:85594:14:14:89:502:366:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for 1950 (Table 51), 1960 (Table 94), and 1970 (Table 19) and the total population in 
44:1289:85680:14:14:89:507:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:each state and year for single years from 1950-1970. Because the population measures 
44:1290:85765:14:13:89:505:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:between census enumerations are estimates, measurement error is a logical concern as

44:1296:85997:13:14:89:506:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of colleges and universities. The degree data are based on the annual “Earned Degrees 
44:1297:86083:14:14:89:505:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Conferred” survey conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), 
44:1298:86167:14:14:89:515:228:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:which records degrees awarded in the 12-month academic year from July to June.33 The 
44:1299:86252:14:14:89:494:214:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:enrollment data are from the “Fall Enrollment” surveys which record the number of 
44:1300:86334:14:13:89:494:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:students enrolled in classes in the fall. Through 1986, these surveys were part of the 
44:1301:86421:13:14:89:483:187:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:larger NCES Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS), which was 
44:1302:86496:14:14:89:480:173:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:subsequently redesigned as the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System

44:1307:86735:15:12:89:512:86:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:degrees. Prior to this point, the two were combined, reflecting the fact that in the early part of the century 
44:1308:86846:12:0:89:489:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:first professional programs were concurrently undergraduate degree programs at some institutions.  
45:1309:86947:0:14:125:518:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Historical data (primarily in the years prior to 1966) were entered from published 
45:1310:87030:14:14:89:506:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tabulations in the government document publications under the titles “Earned Degrees

45:1324:88001:13:14:89:524:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:discussed in the text, the Census data are conceptually different from the institutional data 
45:1325:88095:14:14:89:512:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in that they do not record the year or state of degree receipt. As is well known, the form 
45:1326:88186:14:14:89:502:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the Census question on educational attainment changed to a degree-based question

45:1334:88581:13:14:89:502:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and universities complete a survey of institutional finances in which they report basic

45:1337:88839:14:14:89:485:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:revenue, while also measuring the total level of educational expenditures. For this 
45:1338:88923:14:13:89:354:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:purpose, we focus on the state appropriations variable.

45:1344:89326:13:14:89:522:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:subtracted as they already appear as tuition and fees). This line item also includes Federal 
45:1345:89419:14:14:89:493:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:aid received through State channels and regional compacts.  We have compared the 
45:1346:89500:14:14:89:469:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:measures of state appropriations with data reported from state governments on 
45:1347:89578:14:14:89:479:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:appropriations and found these measures to be highly correlated. Data from state 
45:1348:89659:14:13:89:516:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:governments are compiled annually since 1960 by the Center for the Study of Education 
45:1349:89745:13:14:89:513:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Policy at Illinois State in the Grapevine series. These data differ slightly from measures 
45:1350:89836:14:14:89:493:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reported by institutions in that they also include state funds to non-collegiate higher
