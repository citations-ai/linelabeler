2:33:1763:28:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:We   study   whether   current   spending   levels   and   public   knowledge   of   them   contribute   to 
2:34:1871:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:transatlantic differences  in  policy  preferences  by  implementing  parallel  survey  experiments  in 
2:35:1974:14:14:72:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:Germany and the United States. In both countries, support for increased education spending and 
2:36:2068:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:teacher  salaries  falls sharply  when  respondents  receive  information  about  existing  levels. 
2:37:2167:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:Treatment effects vary by prior knowledge in a manner consistent with information effects rather 
2:38:2263:14:14:72:546:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:than  priming.  Support  for  salary increases  is  inversely  related  to  salary  levels  across  American 
2:39:2371:14:14:72:546:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:states, suggesting that salary differences between the two countries could explain Germans’ lower 
2:40:2468:14:14:72:545:476:12:Times:12:Times:F:support  for  increases.  Information  about the  tradeoffs  between  different  categories  of  education 
2:41:2574:14:42:72:518:462:12:Times:12:Times:F:spending shifts preferences away from class-size reduction and towards alternative purposes.

3:65:3147:0:26:72:173:707:197:Times:197:Times:C:1.   Introduction 
3:66:3164:26:21:93:521:681:144:Times:144:Times:A:Citizens in Europe and the United States differ widely in their views on various policies. 
3:67:3255:21:21:72:541:660:144:Times:144:Times:B:Such transatlantic differences in policy preferences have been attributed to differences in culture, 
3:68:3356:21:21:71:513:639:144:Times:144:Times:B:social beliefs, and political regulations and institutions (e.g., Alesina and Angeletos (2005); 
3:69:3452:21:20:72:534:618:144:Times:144:Times:B:Alesina, Glaeser, and Sacerdote (2006)).   In this paper, we focus on another potential source of 
3:70:3550:20:21:72:525:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:differing preferences for government spending reforms: differences in current spending levels 
3:71:3644:21:21:72:525:577:144:Times:144:Times:B:across countries and the extent to which citizens are informed about these spending levels. To 
3:72:3739:21:20:72:539:556:144:Times:144:Times:B:shed light on how information on spending levels affects policy preferences, we conduct the first 
3:73:3837:20:21:72:512:536:144:Times:144:Times:B:parallel randomized experiments within representative surveys of public opinion in the two 
3:74:3928:21:21:72:473:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:largest industrialized nations in the western world, Germany and the United States. 
3:75:4012:21:20:93:524:494:144:Times:144:Times:A:We focus on government spending on education, which comprises a large share of public 
3:76:4098:20:21:71:535:474:144:Times:144:Times:B:sector budgets around the world. On average across developed countries, more than one in eight 
3:77:4193:21:21:71:510:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:dollars that governments spend goes to education—more than on defense, public order and 
3:78:4281:21:20:71:508:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:safety, and environmental protection combined (OECD (2014)).1 The quality of education 
3:79:4368:20:21:72:532:412:144:Times:144:Times:B:systems is a cornerstone for future national prosperity (Hanushek and Woessmann (2015)), and 
3:80:4461:21:21:72:490:391:144:Times:144:Times:B:citizens’ support for education spending is a critical factor in shaping public budgets.2  
3:81:4552:21:21:93:514:370:144:Times:144:Times:A:Germany and the U.S. differ in a number of features of education finance that might be 
3:82:4639:21:20:71:515:349:144:Times:144:Times:B:expected to give rise to differences in public support for higher education spending. Among 
3:83:4731:20:21:71:520:329:144:Times:144:Times:B:others, the U.S. has higher overall spending levels, but lower teacher salaries, than Germany. 
3:84:4826:21:21:71:527:308:144:Times:144:Times:B:Ignoring any other differences, one might thus expect Americans to be less inclined to support 
3:85:4921:21:20:71:532:287:144:Times:144:Times:B:overall spending increases, but more inclined to support higher teacher salaries. In addition, the 
3:86:5020:20:21:71:513:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:majority of school funding comes from the local level in the U.S. but from the state level in 
3:87:5114:21:21:71:531:246:144:Times:144:Times:B:Germany. If local control aligns actual spending levels more closely with citizens’ preferences, 
3:88:5211:21:20:71:535:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:one would expect smaller effects of informing about actual spending levels in the United States. 
3:89:5308:20:21:72:530:205:144:Times:144:Times:B:Yet we know very little about the public’s knowledge of current education spending levels, the 
3:90:5403:21:21:72:532:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:extent of support for increased spending, and the role of information in shaping public views in 
3:91:5500:21:25:72:164:163:144:Times:144:Times:B:the two countries.  
3:92:5520:25:7:93:240:138:144:Times:144:Times:A:                                                 
3:93:5568:7:17:93:521:131:42:Times:99:Times:F:1 In 2011, public spending on education was 12.9 percent of total public expenditure on average across the 
3:94:5675:17:11:71:527:114:99:Times:99:Times:F:member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD (2014), p. 257). The 
3:95:5782:11:10:71:363:103:99:Times:99:Times:F:figure is 11.0 percent in Germany and 13.6 percent in the United States.  
3:96:5856:10:16:93:529:93:42:Times:99:Times:F:2 The importance for public budgets holds irrespective of the debate over whether higher spending levels are 
3:97:5965:16:0:71:474:77:99:Times:99:Times:F:essential to improve school quality (e.g., Hanushek (2003); Jackson, Johnson, and Persico (2016)).   
4:98:6067:0:21:93:531:709:144:Times:144:Times:A:To investigate these issues, we surveyed representative samples of the adult populations in 
4:99:6159:21:21:71:533:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:Germany and the U.S. and implemented three randomized experiments on how the provision of 
4:100:6249:21:20:72:539:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:information affects support for education spending. The German and American surveys included 
4:101:6342:20:21:72:520:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:more than 4,000 and 2,600 respondents, respectively. Within each survey, randomly selected 
4:102:6433:21:21:71:534:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:subgroups were given different types of information before answering the same questions about 
4:103:6527:21:20:71:508:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:the level and allocation of public spending on education. Earlier in both surveys, we asked 
4:104:6619:20:21:72:464:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:respondents to estimate current levels of education spending and teacher salaries. 
4:105:6701:21:21:93:533:564:144:Times:144:Times:A:We find that a vast majority of the public in both countries underestimates current levels of 
4:106:6795:21:21:71:531:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:school spending and teacher salaries. Absent the provision of information, an absolute majority 
4:107:6891:21:20:71:531:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:in both countries supports increased government spending on education, with somewhat higher 
4:108:6983:20:21:71:452:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:levels of support among Germans than Americans (71 percent vs. 60 percent).  
4:109:7060:21:21:93:535:481:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our first survey experiment shows that citizens of both countries also react similarly to two 
4:110:7154:21:20:71:519:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:information treatments, with treatment effects (relative to the control mean) hardly differing. 
4:111:7250:20:21:71:527:440:144:Times:144:Times:B:Informing respondents about the current level of annual public education spending per student 
4:112:7344:21:21:71:535:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:reduces support for increased spending by more than one quarter (to 50 percent in Germany and 
4:113:7438:21:20:71:504:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:43 percent in the U.S.). Additionally stating that the spending increase would be financed 
4:114:7529:20:21:71:534:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:through higher taxation reduces support by more than half compared to the control group (to 30 
4:115:7624:21:21:71:524:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:percent in Germany and 26 percent in the U.S.), with the shares in support no longer differing 
4:116:7719:21:21:71:266:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:significantly between the two countries. 
4:117:7760:21:20:93:519:315:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our second survey experiment examines preferences for increases in teacher salaries. In 
4:118:7848:20:21:71:510:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:both countries, staff compensation makes up 81 percent of total current school expenditure 
4:119:7939:21:21:71:536:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:(OECD (2014), p. 284), making salary levels a crucial component of overall education spending 
4:120:8033:21:20:71:503:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:levels. When respondents are informed about current salary levels, the share who support 
4:121:8122:20:21:71:541:233:144:Times:144:Times:B:increases in teacher salaries declines sharply by about 40 percent (relative to the control mean) in 
4:122:8223:21:21:71:527:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:both countries, although baseline support is much lower in Germany. The latter difference, the 
4:123:8318:21:20:71:532:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:only notable divergence in preferences that we observe between the two countries, is consistent 
4:124:8414:20:21:71:535:171:144:Times:144:Times:B:with the fact that current salaries are higher in Germany. In fact, based on an estimated negative 
4:125:8513:21:21:71:527:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:relationship between salary levels and support for salary increases across U.S. states, we show 
4:126:8609:21:21:71:502:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:that Germany’s higher current salary levels could account for more than two thirds of the 
4:127:8699:21:0:71:343:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:German-U.S. difference in support for salary increases.  
5:128:8757:0:21:93:513:709:144:Times:144:Times:A:Further analysis confirms that these treatment effects reflect actual information effects, 
5:129:8848:21:21:72:535:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:rather than simply the effect of being primed to think about monetary values as opposed to, say, 
5:130:8945:21:20:72:542:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:observable conditions in local schools before reporting support for spending increases (Iyengar et 
5:131:9044:20:21:72:522:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:al. (1984); Krosnick and Kinder (1990)). In both countries, treatment effects are substantially 
5:132:9140:21:21:72:540:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:larger for respondents who underestimated actual levels and are almost zero for respondents who 
5:133:9236:21:20:72:541:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:had already been well informed prior to the information treatment. The fact that treatment effects 
5:134:9335:20:21:72:517:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:vary with prior information levels indicates that they at least partly reflect genuine effects of 
5:135:9433:21:21:72:533:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:being better informed, rather than just priming. The heterogeneity by prior information levels is 
5:136:9531:21:21:72:527:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:more pronounced for teacher salaries than for school spending, in line with the hypothesis that 
5:137:9627:21:20:72:513:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:people have a better anchor when estimating salaries compared to spending levels. It is also 
5:138:9720:20:21:72:516:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:particularly noteworthy given that we find virtually no evidence of heterogeneous treatment 
5:139:9812:21:21:72:542:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects across population subgroups defined by gender, age, education, income, employment, and 
5:140:9907:21:20:72:212:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:parental and minority status. 
5:141:9937:20:21:93:499:440:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our third experiment examines how preferences for specific categories of education 
5:142:10020:21:21:72:530:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:spending react to the provision of information on the tradeoffs involved when choosing among 
5:143:10113:21:20:72:531:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:them. When asked how best to allocate new education spending, respondents’ preferences shift 
5:144:10206:20:21:72:507:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:away from class-size reductions towards alternative spending categories—teacher salaries 
5:145:10295:21:21:72:503:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:(particularly in the U.S.) and materials such as new books and technology (particularly in 
5:146:10386:21:21:72:528:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:Germany)—if they are informed about what could be achieved in each category with the same 
5:147:10476:21:20:72:227:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:amount of additional spending.  
5:148:10508:20:21:93:533:295:144:Times:144:Times:A:The broad pattern of results across the three comparative survey experiments suggests that, 
5:149:10600:21:21:72:514:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:despite numerous institutional and political differences between the two countries, citizens’ 
5:150:10694:21:20:72:518:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:knowledge of and preferences over education spending are quite similar in Germany and the 
5:151:10784:20:21:72:502:233:144:Times:144:Times:B:U.S., as are reactions to the provision of information. The overall level of preferences for 
5:152:10877:21:21:72:520:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:increases in government spending on education, their substantial reduction when mentioning 
5:153:10968:21:20:72:533:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:current spending levels and tax financing requirements, and the shift away from preferences for 
5:154:11064:20:21:72:530:171:144:Times:144:Times:B:class-size reductions towards other spending alternatives when informed about the quantitative 
5:155:11159:21:21:72:532:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:tradeoffs involved are all comparable across the two countries. The lone exception is Germans’ 
5:156:11254:21:21:72:539:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:lower preference for teacher salary increases, which is consistent with existing salary differences 
5:157:11354:21:0:72:204:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:between the two countries. 
6:158:11382:0:21:93:529:709:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our results contribute to at least three strands of literature. First, a substantial comparative 
6:159:11479:21:21:72:534:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:literature examines transatlantic differences in the public’s policy preferences in different areas. 
6:160:11580:21:20:72:491:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:In particular, Alberto Alesina and coauthors have studied U.S.-European differences in 
6:161:11667:20:21:72:498:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:preferences for inequality, redistribution, and working times, concluding that preference 
6:162:11757:21:21:72:534:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:differences are not so much related to differences in utility functions or culture as to differences 
6:163:11858:21:20:72:520:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:in social beliefs, political institutions, and regulations (see Alesina and Angeletos (2005) and 
6:164:11955:20:21:72:509:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:Alesina, Di Tella, and MacCulloch (2004) on redistributive policies; Alesina, Glaeser, and 
6:165:12046:21:21:72:526:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:Sacerdote (2001) on the welfare state; and Alesina, Glaeser, and Sacerdote (2006) on working 
6:166:12139:21:21:72:532:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:times). Our results similarly suggest that the views of Americans and Germans about education 
6:167:12233:21:20:72:278:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:spending may not be so different, after all. 
6:168:12277:20:21:93:530:502:144:Times:144:Times:A:Second, several recent papers use survey experiments in individual countries to study how 
6:169:12367:21:21:72:525:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:policy preferences respond to the provision of different kinds of information. For example, Di 
6:170:12462:21:20:72:531:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:Tella, Galiani, and Schargrodsky (2012) study effects of information treatments on preferences 
6:171:12557:20:21:72:540:440:144:Times:144:Times:B:for privatization reforms in Argentina, Cruces, Perez-Truglia, and Tetaz (2013) and Kuziemko et 
6:172:12653:21:21:72:532:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:al. (2015) for redistributive policies in Buenos Aires and the U.S., respectively, Elias, Lacetera, 
6:173:12753:21:20:72:515:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Macis (2015) for payments for human organs in the U.S., Schueler and West (2016) for 
6:174:12842:20:21:72:505:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:education spending in the U.S., Lergetporer et al. (2016) for public spending in general in 
6:175:12934:21:21:72:540:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:Germany, and Bursztyn (2016) for the tradeoff between education spending and cash transfers in 
6:176:13029:21:21:72:524:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:Brazil. To our knowledge, our paper is the first to use parallel survey experiments to compare 
6:177:13124:21:20:72:443:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:how the same information treatments affect public opinion in two countries.  
6:178:13201:20:21:93:530:295:144:Times:144:Times:A:Third, our results advance our understanding of the political economy of education policy. 
6:179:13292:21:21:72:499:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:They provide empirical underpinning for the mostly theoretical literature on the political 
6:180:13383:21:20:72:540:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:economy of education spending (see, e.g., Glomm, Ravikumar, and Schiopu (2011)) and provide 
6:181:13475:20:21:72:532:233:144:Times:144:Times:B:guidance as to the political feasibility of policies such as increasing teacher salaries or reducing 
6:182:13576:21:21:72:306:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:class sizes (e.g., Woessmann and West (2006)).  
6:183:13624:21:20:93:524:191:144:Times:144:Times:A:In what follows, Section 2 provides a theoretical framework to guide interpretation of the 
6:184:13715:20:21:72:518:171:144:Times:144:Times:B:information experiments, as well as background on the U.S. and German education systems. 
6:185:13804:21:21:72:519:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:Section 3 introduces the data and the experimental design. Section 4 reports our main results 
6:186:13898:21:21:72:522:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:concerning the effect of information provision on support for education spending and teacher 
6:187:13991:21:20:72:540:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:salaries in the two countries. Section 5 demonstrates that German levels of support are consistent 
6:188:14090:20:0:72:504:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:with the relationship between current salary levels and support for salary increases across 
7:189:14183:0:21:72:541:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:American states. Section 6 provides evidence of heterogeneous treatment effects by respondents’ 
7:190:14279:21:21:72:521:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:prior information. Section 7 examines the effects on preferences of highlighting the tradeoffs 
7:191:14374:21:40:72:494:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:between different spending categories. Section 8 discusses our findings and concludes.  
7:192:14462:40:27:72:174:627:197:Times:197:Times:C:2.   Background  
7:193:14478:27:20:93:505:600:144:Times:144:Times:A:We start by providing theoretical and institutional context for the survey experiments 
7:194:14565:20:21:72:540:580:144:Times:144:Times:B:described below. We first propose a theoretical framework based on a standard preference model 
7:195:14660:21:21:72:520:559:144:Times:144:Times:B:that illustrates how the provision of information could influence policy preferences. We then 
7:196:14754:21:20:72:530:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:offer background information on the American and German education systems and the sources 
7:197:14844:20:33:72:336:518:144:Times:144:Times:B:and levels of education spending in the two countries.  
7:198:14900:33:26:72:218:485:144:Times:144:Times:B:2.1 Theoretical Framework 
7:199:14925:26:21:93:486:459:144:Times:144:Times:A:As a framework for our analyses, let us consider a standard model that represents 
7:200:15007:21:20:71:505:438:144:Times:144:Times:B:preferences as indifference curves for bundles of two goods between which a consumer is 
7:201:15095:20:21:71:511:418:144:Times:144:Times:B:indifferent. In our case, the two goods are policies: spending on public education and other 
7:202:15188:21:21:72:542:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:categories of government spending (see Figure 1 for a graphical exposition and Appendix A for a 
7:203:15284:21:20:72:524:376:144:Times:144:Times:B:formal derivation). A budget line depicts how much of one good must be sacrificed to receive 
7:204:15377:20:21:71:520:356:144:Times:144:Times:B:more of the other. Our analysis refers to the preferences of one individual who represents the 
7:205:15472:21:21:72:531:335:144:Times:144:Times:B:median voter in a given country. There will be a distribution of preferences around that median 
7:206:15568:21:20:72:521:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:voter, so changes in the size of preferred changes for this representative agent will ultimately 
7:207:15665:20:21:72:516:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:translate into changes in the share of people in the country supporting spending increases or 
7:208:15759:21:33:72:126:273:144:Times:144:Times:B:decreases.  
7:209:15770:33:26:72:388:240:144:Times:144:Times:B:The Effect of Status Information on Support for Policy Change 
7:210:15832:26:20:93:527:214:144:Times:144:Times:A:We start with two assumptions about the median individual’s knowledge and preferences, 
7:211:15919:20:21:71:505:194:144:Times:144:Times:B:which are supported below by evidence from our survey data for both countries. First, the 
7:212:16009:21:21:71:542:173:144:Times:144:Times:B:individual underestimates current levels of spending and teacher salaries. Second, without further 
7:213:16108:21:20:71:542:152:144:Times:144:Times:B:information, what the person perceives to be the current levels of spending and salaries are below 
7:214:16207:20:21:71:463:132:144:Times:144:Times:B:her personal optimal levels, so that she prefers spending and salaries to increase.  
7:215:16292:21:21:93:513:111:144:Times:144:Times:A:This simple framework allows us to analyze the effects of the two types of information 
7:216:16379:21:0:71:511:90:144:Times:144:Times:B:treatments in our survey experiments. The first type is informing respondents about current 
8:217:16472:0:21:72:507:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:levels of education spending.3 Let Eu in Figure 1 represent the individual’s estimate of the 
8:218:16565:21:21:72:539:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:current level of education spending. Her optimal policy choice is Eu*, indicating that she favors a 
8:219:16664:21:20:72:333:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:large increase in education spending (Δ uninformed).  
8:220:16718:20:21:93:539:647:144:Times:144:Times:A:If the person now is informed that the actual level of education spending is in fact not Eu but 
8:221:16814:21:21:72:517:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:rather the higher level Ei, her optimal policy choice would be Ei*, and support for increasing 
8:222:16909:21:20:72:532:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:education spending declines (Δ informed < Δ uninformed). Put differently, Ei* lies to the left of 
8:223:17007:20:21:72:513:585:144:g_d0_f5:144:Times:B:Eu* projected onto the new budget line with constant levels of other spending. The intuition 
8:224:17100:21:21:72:500:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:behind this shift in preferences is straightforward: The individual in the informed state is 
8:225:17193:21:21:72:540:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:equivalent to an uninformed individual who received an increase in her budget and spent it all on 
8:226:17291:21:20:71:534:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:education. Since under standard preferences she would prefer to spend a portion of this increase 
8:227:17388:20:21:72:505:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:on other items, the allocation after the increase reduces her relative demand for additional 
8:228:17481:21:21:72:530:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:education spending. In a setting of underestimation of current levels of education spending and 
8:229:17577:21:20:72:530:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:preferences for increased education spending, one would therefore expect that informing about 
8:230:17671:20:21:72:472:440:144:Times:144:Times:B:current levels of education spending would reduce support for spending increases.  
8:231:17753:21:21:93:536:419:144:Times:144:Times:A:If we change the axes in Figure 1 to represent teacher salaries (rather than overall education 
8:232:17848:21:20:72:517:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:spending) vs. other spending (inside or outside the education system) and maintain the same 
8:233:17940:20:21:72:525:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:assumptions, the analysis can similarly be interpreted in terms of providing information about 
8:234:18035:21:21:72:511:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:current levels of teacher salaries, which is predicted to reduce support for salary increases.  
8:235:18130:21:21:93:520:336:144:Times:144:Times:A:Analyzing the effects of providing information on a single budget item like spending for 
8:236:18219:21:20:72:520:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:schools or teacher salaries is useful in illustrating the potential consequences of transparency 
8:237:18316:20:21:72:514:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:policies focused on these areas. More generally, the analysis illustrates how access to better 
8:238:18411:21:21:72:529:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:information can shape citizens’ policy preferences with respect to public spending, a topic that 
8:239:18508:21:20:72:540:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:has been the subject of surprisingly little scholarly research. One should be cautious, however, in 
8:240:18608:20:21:72:518:233:144:Times:144:Times:B:using such analysis to draw conclusions about how spending levels would need to change to 
8:241:18698:21:21:72:535:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:better align with citizens’ preferences. To the extent that respondents are also uninformed about 
8:242:18796:21:20:72:492:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:areas of public spending beyond education, the analysis does not necessarily reveal the 
8:243:18884:20:21:72:529:171:144:Times:144:Times:B:optimality of policy choices, and providing information on education spending may also affect 
8:244:18978:21:49:72:376:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates of spending levels on other items (see Appendix A).  
8:245:19041:49:8:93:240:101:144:Times:144:Times:A:                                                 
8:246:19089:8:16:93:537:93:42:Times:99:Times:F:3 We assume for now that the information treatment does not affect the individual’s estimate of other spending 
8:247:19200:16:0:72:218:77:99:Times:99:Times:F:or of the relative price of education. 
9:248:19240:0:26:72:404:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:The Effect of Tradeoff Information on Support for Policy Change  
9:249:19305:26:21:93:516:683:144:Times:144:Times:A:The second type of information treatment informs about the tradeoffs between different 
9:250:19392:21:20:71:534:662:144:Times:144:Times:B:categories of education spending, rather than about current spending levels. Consider the choice 
9:251:19489:20:21:71:505:642:144:Times:144:Times:B:between the number of teachers per student (the inverse of class size) and other education 
9:252:19580:21:21:72:508:621:144:Times:144:Times:B:spending in Figure 2. The dashed line shows the individual’s uninformed beliefs about the 
9:253:19670:21:21:72:536:600:144:Times:144:Times:B:tradeoff between class-size reduction and other spending categories. Informing the person about 
9:254:19766:21:20:72:518:579:144:Times:144:Times:B:the actual tradeoff makes her aware that the true budget line has a steeper slope (i.e., smaller 
9:255:19863:20:21:72:535:559:144:Times:144:Times:B:reductions in class size for increases in alternative spending than the person had expected). As a 
9:256:19962:21:21:71:523:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:result, the optimal policy choice is one where class sizes are not reduced by as much as in the 
9:257:20058:21:20:71:540:517:144:Times:144:Times:B:uninformed case (Δ informed < Δ uninformed). Support for class-size reduction decreases, while 
9:258:20153:20:21:72:371:497:144:Times:144:Times:B:support for increasing spending in other categories increases.  
9:259:20216:21:21:93:502:476:144:Times:144:Times:A:If we redefine the axes in Figure 2 to capture overall education spending (rather than 
9:260:20303:21:20:72:516:455:144:Times:144:Times:B:teachers per student) vs. non-education spending, the picture can also be used to analyze the 
9:261:20397:20:21:72:517:435:144:Times:144:Times:B:additional treatment in our first survey experiment designed to raise the salience of taxation: 
9:262:20493:21:21:72:523:414:144:Times:144:Times:B:mentioning the need to raise taxes heightens the person’s awareness that increasing education 
9:263:20587:21:21:72:512:393:144:Times:144:Times:B:spending requires taking money from other (in this case private) uses. Making this tradeoff 
9:264:20679:21:32:72:412:372:144:Times:144:Times:B:salient is therefore expected to reduce support for spending increases.

9:266:20808:26:21:93:518:314:144:Times:144:Times:A:Education is currently the third largest category of government expenditure (after social 
9:267:20898:21:20:72:501:293:144:Times:144:Times:B:protection and health care) in both Germany and in the U.S. (OECD (2015), p. 73). Each 
9:268:20985:20:21:72:515:273:144:Times:144:Times:B:country’s public school system enrols the vast majority of students. In the U.S., the share of 
9:269:21080:21:21:72:510:252:144:Times:144:Times:B:students who attend a private school is 8 percent from primary through to upper secondary 
9:270:21170:21:21:72:535:231:144:Times:144:Times:B:school (OECD (2014), p. 416). In Germany, it is 4 percent in primary school, 9 percent in lower 
9:271:21266:21:20:72:505:210:144:Times:144:Times:B:secondary, and 8 percent in upper secondary school. However, the American and German 
9:272:21351:20:21:72:500:190:144:Times:144:Times:B:education systems also differ in a number of important respects, including the sources of 
9:273:21441:21:46:72:380:169:144:Times:144:Times:B:education funding, spending levels, and teacher compensation.4 
9:274:21503:46:7:93:240:123:144:Times:144:Times:A:                                                 
9:275:21551:7:16:93:536:116:42:Times:99:Times:F:4 The education systems also differ in other aspects such as a reliance on comprehensive high schools versus a 
9:276:21662:16:11:71:540:100:99:Times:99:Times:F:tracked secondary school system, the prevalence of central exit exams, methods of school finance, and the allocation 
9:277:21779:11:12:71:540:89:99:Times:99:Times:F:of educational resources. See Henderson et al. (2015) for a more extensive description of the historical, institutional, 
9:278:21900:12:0:71:342:77:99:Times:99:Times:F:and cultural contexts of the education systems in the two countries. 
10:279:21969:0:21:93:504:709:144:Times:144:Times:A:In both the U.S. and Germany, the federal government plays only a secondary role in 
10:280:22052:21:21:72:520:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:education governance. The distribution of responsibility for public education across different 
10:281:22147:21:20:72:504:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:levels of government is reflected in the sources of education funding. In 2011, the federal 
10:282:22239:20:21:72:508:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:government contributed 14 percent of total funding in the U.S. and 11 percent in Germany 
10:283:22328:21:21:72:531:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:(OECD (2014), p. 259). While only 35 percent of funding for American schools came from the 
10:284:22419:21:20:71:524:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:states, this share was 72 percent in Germany, underscoring the dominant role of the Länder in 
10:285:22513:20:21:72:533:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:education policy. In the U.S., 51 percent of funding comes from the local level, compared to 17 
10:286:22609:21:21:72:541:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:percent in Germany, giving local school boards a larger role in education governance. If the local 
10:287:22708:21:21:72:539:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:nature of funding aligns spending levels more closely with the local optimum or makes residents 
10:288:22804:21:20:72:515:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:better informed, the theoretical framework presented above would predict smaller effects of 
10:289:22896:20:21:72:471:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:information treatments on preferences for education spending in the United States. 
10:290:22979:21:21:93:537:481:144:Times:144:Times:A:In addition to funding sources, spending levels also differ between the countries. According 
10:291:23072:21:20:72:513:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:to OECD estimates, spending for primary education is 45 percent higher in the U.S. than in 
10:292:23163:20:21:72:542:440:144:Times:144:Times:B:Germany, and 24 percent higher for secondary education (OECD (2014), p. 215). In dollar terms, 
10:293:23258:21:21:72:499:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:while the U.S. spent $10,958 per student in primary education and $12,731 in secondary 
10:294:23345:21:20:72:523:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:education in 2011, expenditures in Germany were at $7,579 and $10,275, respectively. These 
10:295:23436:20:21:72:512:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:numbers correspond to 3.7 percent of GDP in the U.S. and 3.0 percent of GDP in Germany 
10:296:23523:21:21:72:538:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:(OECD (2014), p. 230). Public expenditure on non-tertiary education accounts for 9.2 percent of 
10:297:23619:21:21:72:537:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:total public expenditure in the U.S. and 6.7 percent in Germany (OECD (2014), p. 257). All else 
10:298:23715:21:20:72:497:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:equal, the theoretical framework would thus lead to the expectation of lower support for 
10:299:23804:20:21:72:511:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:spending increases, as well as smaller absolute information treatment effects, in the United 
10:300:23897:21:21:72:106:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:States. 
10:301:23905:21:20:93:510:253:144:Times:144:Times:A:The higher overall spending level in the U.S. is not reflected in higher average teacher 
10:302:23994:20:21:72:524:233:144:Times:144:Times:B:salaries. Quite to the contrary, teacher salaries are substantially higher in Germany than in the 
10:303:24092:21:21:72:532:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:U.S., both in absolute terms and relative to other workers with a post-secondary degree (OECD 
10:304:24186:21:20:72:532:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:(2014), p. 467-471). In primary school, the average annual statutory salary of teachers (after 10 
10:305:24284:20:21:72:533:171:144:Times:144:Times:B:years of experience) is 33 percent higher in Germany ($59,795) than in the U.S. ($44,995). The 
10:306:24379:21:21:72:542:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:difference is even more pronounced in secondary school, where German teachers earn 48 percent 
10:307:24473:21:21:72:540:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:more than U.S. teachers at the lower secondary level and 55 percent more at the upper secondary 
10:308:24569:21:20:72:543:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:level. Comparing teacher salaries to the earnings of other workers with a tertiary education yields 
10:309:24669:20:0:72:538:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:a similar picture: At the primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary levels, German teachers 
11:310:24766:0:21:72:528:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:earn 88, 97, and 105 percent, respectively, compared to other college-educated workers. In the 
11:311:24861:21:21:72:540:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:U.S., relative wages are substantially lower at 67, 68, and 70 percent, respectively. Average class 
11:312:24961:21:20:72:513:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:sizes in the two countries are nonetheless quite similar in primary school at 21 students and 
11:313:25055:20:21:72:512:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:slightly smaller in Germany (24 students) than in the U.S. (27 students) in lower secondary 
11:314:25147:21:21:72:524:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:school (OECD (2014), p. 450). Moreover, as noted above, the total share of current education 
11:315:25240:21:20:72:538:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:spending devoted to staff compensation is 81 percent in both countries. Together with the higher 
11:316:25337:20:21:72:491:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:spending levels and lower teacher salaries in the U.S., this implies that the U.S. spends 
11:317:25427:21:21:72:536:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:considerably more than Germany on non-teaching staff. All else equal, one would expect higher 
11:318:25521:21:21:71:509:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:support for salary increases and larger absolute information treatment effects in the United 
11:319:25614:21:40:71:109:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:States.

11:321:25644:26:21:93:521:456:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our analysis draws on three randomized survey experiments embedded in representative 
11:322:25729:21:33:72:489:435:144:Times:144:Times:B:surveys of public opinion on education policy that we conducted in the two countries.  
11:323:25816:33:26:72:429:402:144:Times:144:Times:B:3.1 Comparative Opinion Surveys in Germany and the United States 
11:324:25880:26:20:93:540:376:144:Times:144:Times:A:In spring 2014, we surveyed representative samples of the adult population in both countries 
11:325:25973:20:21:72:501:356:144:Times:144:Times:B:about their opinions on education policy.5 The German sample includes more than 4,000 
11:326:26059:21:21:72:498:335:144:Times:144:Times:B:respondents, and the U.S. sample used in this paper more than 2,600. Both surveys were 
11:327:26146:21:20:72:516:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:conducted primarily online, with additional provisions undertaken in each country to ensure 
11:328:26238:20:33:72:366:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:representativeness also for residents without internet access.  
11:329:26302:33:26:72:174:261:144:Times:144:Times:B:The German Survey 
11:330:26320:26:21:93:506:235:144:Times:144:Times:A:The German survey drew a nationally representative, stratified sample of the German 
11:331:26404:21:20:72:519:214:144:Times:144:Times:B:population aged 18 years and older.6 Random sampling was conducted in two steps: Persons 
11:332:26493:20:21:72:534:194:144:Times:144:Times:B:with internet access at home (75 percent) were selected from an online panel and polled with an 
11:333:26589:21:21:72:529:173:144:Times:144:Times:B:online survey. Persons without internet access at home (25 percent) were polled at their homes 
11:334:26684:21:26:72:537:152:144:Times:144:Times:B:by trained interviewers. These respondents were provided with a tablet computer for completing 
11:335:26779:26:7:93:240:126:144:Times:144:Times:A:

11:338:26970:10:16:93:522:93:42:Times:99:Times:F:6 The survey was implemented by the polling firm TNS Infratest (now called Kantar Public Germany); see

12:340:27117:0:21:72:523:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:the survey autonomously. When necessary, the interviewer assisted with handling the device. 
12:341:27209:21:21:72:401:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:The survey was conducted in German between April and July 2014. 
12:342:27273:21:20:93:540:667:144:Times:144:Times:A:Overall, the German survey comprised 39 questions on education policy. These included the 
12:343:27363:20:21:72:506:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:questions on education spending used in this paper, which were coordinated with the U.S. 
12:344:27452:21:21:72:485:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:survey. The exact wording of each question can be found at www.cesifo-group.de/ifo-
12:345:27535:21:20:72:535:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:bildungsbarometer. Within the survey experiments, the maximum number of different treatment 
12:346:27627:20:21:72:173:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:conditions was four. 
12:347:27648:21:21:93:539:564:144:Times:144:Times:A:The total number of observations in the German survey is 4,171 adults. The specific number 
12:348:27739:21:21:72:521:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:of respondents to each question varies for two reasons. The first reason is item non-response, 
12:349:27834:21:20:72:524:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:which is very low at 1 percent on average. The second reason is that on the spending question 
12:350:27928:20:21:72:520:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:and on the tradeoff question, subgroups of respondents were assigned to additional Germany-

12:352:28106:21:20:72:488:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:throughout to ensure the sample’s representativeness with respect to the national adult

12:355:28222:26:21:93:497:381:144:Times:144:Times:A:The American survey drew a nationally representative, stratified sample of the U.S. 
12:356:28306:21:20:72:533:360:144:Times:144:Times:B:population aged 18 years and older and representative oversamples of the following subgroups: 
12:357:28400:20:21:72:508:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:public school teachers, African Americans, and Hispanics.7 The sample was drawn from a 
12:358:28487:21:21:72:528:319:144:Times:144:Times:B:nationally representative panel of adults, obtained via address-based sampling and list-assisted 
12:359:28584:21:20:72:513:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:random digit-dialing sampling techniques, who agreed to participate in a limited number of 
12:360:28675:20:21:72:535:278:144:Times:144:Times:B:online surveys. Individuals who do not have internet access were provided access by the polling 
12:361:28771:21:21:72:538:257:144:Times:144:Times:B:firm. The survey was conducted in May and June 2014. Respondents could elect to complete the 
12:362:28864:21:20:72:216:236:144:Times:144:Times:B:survey in English or Spanish. 
12:363:28894:20:21:93:495:216:144:Times:144:Times:A:Overall, the U.S. survey comprised 36 questions on education policy, including the 
12:364:28977:21:21:72:520:195:144:Times:144:Times:B:questions coordinated with the German survey used in this paper. The exact wording of each 
12:365:29068:21:21:72:516:174:144:Times:144:Times:B:question is displayed at www.educationnext.org/edfacts. Within the survey experiments, the

13:372:29652:21:21:72:525:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:The specific number of respondents varies from question to question due to item nonresponse 
13:373:29744:21:20:72:523:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:and the fact that, in the cases of opinion about school spending and teacher salary, the sample 
13:374:29840:20:21:72:543:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:was randomly divided into multiple groups in order to examine the effect of variations in the way 
13:375:29938:21:21:72:534:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:questions were posed. Survey weights are employed throughout to account for nonresponse and

13:377:30093:33:25:71:207:572:144:Times:144:Times:B:3.2 Experimental Design  
13:378:30118:25:21:93:540:547:144:Times:144:Times:A:In order to identify the effect of the provision of information on public support for education 
13:379:30214:21:21:71:542:526:144:Times:144:Times:B:spending in the two countries, we implemented the same three randomized survey experiments in 
13:380:30308:21:20:72:530:505:144:Times:144:Times:B:both countries. Within each survey, randomly selected subgroups were given different types of 
13:381:30402:20:21:72:536:485:144:Times:144:Times:B:information before answering the same questions about their views on specific aspects of public 
13:382:30498:21:21:72:532:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:education spending. Randomization was independent across the three survey experiments. This 
13:383:30590:21:20:72:530:443:144:Times:144:Times:B:design allows us to identify the causal effect of the provision of the specific information on the 
13:384:30689:20:21:71:381:423:144:Times:144:Times:B:public’s preferences for education spending in a survey setting.  
13:385:30755:21:21:93:528:402:144:Times:144:Times:A:The first experiment relates to a question on preferences for overall increases in education 
13:386:30848:21:21:71:530:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:spending.9 The control group (Uninformed) was simply asked about their support for increases 
13:387:30941:21:20:72:540:360:144:Times:144:Times:B:or decreases in government funding for public schools in their school district (U.S.) or nationally 
13:388:31041:20:21:72:511:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Germany). Respondents could choose one of the following five answer categories: greatly 
13:389:31130:21:21:72:524:319:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase, increase, stay about the same, decrease, or greatly decrease. There are two treatment 
13:390:31226:21:20:72:542:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:groups. One treatment group (Informed) was first informed about the actual level of spending per 
13:391:31323:20:21:72:522:278:144:Times:144:Times:B:student in their district (U.S.: $12,400 on average across the sample) or nationally (Germany: 
13:392:31418:21:21:72:497:257:144:Times:144:Times:B:€6,400) and then asked the same question as the control group. After receiving the same 
13:393:31506:21:20:71:520:236:144:Times:144:Times:B:information as the first treatment group, a second treatment group (Informed+tax) was asked 
13:394:31598:20:21:71:539:216:144:Times:144:Times:B:whether taxes to fund public schools should increase or decrease. As is evident from Table 1, the 
13:395:31696:21:21:71:536:195:144:Times:144:Times:B:samples are well balanced across the treatment conditions in terms of observable characteristics, 
13:396:31794:21:48:71:379:174:144:Times:144:Times:B:indicating that randomization was successful in both countries.  
13:397:31859:48:7:93:240:126:144:Times:144:Times:A:                                                 
13:398:31907:7:16:93:521:119:42:Times:99:Times:F:8 The full U.S. survey had a sample size of 5,266 adults and included an additional experiment designed to 
13:399:32014:16:11:71:537:103:99:Times:99:Times:F:estimate the impact of the provision of information on student achievement on policy views; the sample used in this 
13:400:32130:11:10:71:300:92:99:Times:99:Times:F:paper comprises the control group from that experiment. 
13:401:32185:10:0:93:444:82:42:Times:99:Times:F:9 The exact wording of the questions in the two countries can be found in Appendix B.  
14:402:32274:0:21:93:542:709:144:Times:144:Times:A:In the other two experiments, there is only one treatment group each. The second experiment 
14:403:32366:21:21:72:504:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:asked about support for increases or decreases in the salaries of public school teachers. In 
14:404:32459:21:20:72:522:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:contrast to the uninformed control group, the treatment group was informed about the current 
14:405:32552:20:21:72:509:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:level of teacher salaries in their state (U.S.) or nationally (Germany). The third experiment 
14:406:32646:21:21:72:515:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:examined preferences for different categories of education spending. The control group was 
14:407:32737:21:20:72:501:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:simply asked whether a planned increase in government spending should go to class-size 
14:408:32824:20:21:72:524:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:reductions, teacher salary increases, or new books and technologies. The treatment group was 
14:409:32917:21:21:72:512:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:informed that in the U.S. (Germany), reducing average class sizes by 3 students would cost 
14:410:33008:21:21:72:521:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:roughly the same amount as increasing teacher salaries by 13 (15) percent or buying $10,000 
14:411:33100:21:20:72:535:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:(€20,000) in new books and technologies for each class every year before choosing one of these 
14:412:33195:20:21:72:537:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:three options. The balancing table (Appendix Table A1) indicates that observable characteristics 
14:413:33292:21:21:72:539:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:are again well balanced across control and treatment groups in the second and third experiments. 
14:414:33389:21:20:93:541:460:144:Times:144:Times:A:In addition to the survey experiments on opinions, we asked respondents in both countries to 
14:415:33482:20:21:72:505:440:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimate the current levels of education spending and teacher salaries, respectively. These 
14:416:33574:21:21:72:523:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:questions were asked much earlier in the surveys and were separated from the related opinion 
14:417:33667:21:20:72:398:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:questions by a series of questions on other education policy topics.  
14:418:33737:20:21:93:497:378:144:Times:144:Times:A:In our analyses, we report results both with and without the following set of control 
14:419:33823:21:21:72:529:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:variables available in both countries: gender, parental and employment status, income,10 age,11 
14:420:33918:21:21:72:535:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:and education.12 As is evident from Table 1, a larger share of U.S. than German respondents are 
14:421:34014:21:20:72:540:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:parents and employed. The U.S. population is also somewhat younger. In addition, it has a larger 
14:422:34111:20:21:72:508:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:share of people with college degrees, whereas the German population has a larger share of 
14:423:34201:21:21:72:521:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:apprenticeship degrees. The available information on minority status differs between the two 
14:424:34294:21:20:72:515:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries: in the U.S., it refers to the non-white population, whereas in Germany, it refers to 
14:425:34390:20:21:72:529:233:144:Times:144:Times:B:having a migration background (i.e., both parents not born in the country). We therefore report 
14:426:34486:21:21:72:541:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:the minority variable in Table 1 but omit it as a control variable in our experimental analyses due 
14:427:34586:21:15:72:291:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:to the lack of comparability across countries. 
14:428:34633:15:8:93:240:176:144:Times:144:Times:A:                                                 
14:429:34681:8:16:93:533:168:42:Times:99:Times:F:10 Income is measured as percentile rank within each country because income was surveyed in different ways 
14:430:34788:16:12:72:541:152:99:Times:99:Times:F:in the two countries that correspond to the most common way of reporting income. In the U.S. survey, income refers 
14:431:34903:12:11:72:539:140:99:Times:99:Times:F:to annual pre-tax household income. In the German survey, income refers to monthly household income net of taxes 
14:432:35016:11:10:72:208:129:99:Times:99:Times:F:and social security contributions.  
14:433:35051:10:16:93:527:119:42:Times:99:Times:F:11 To allow for non-linearities in the relationship between age and preferences, we collapse our age variable 
14:434:35161:16:10:71:277:103:99:Times:99:Times:F:into four categories: 18-34, 35-49, 50-64, and 65+. 
14:435:35212:10:16:93:528:93:42:Times:99:Times:F:12 To make the different degrees in the two countries comparable, education is measured in three categories: 
14:436:35321:16:0:72:372:77:99:Times:99:Times:F:less than high school, high school but no B.A., and B.A. degree or higher.  
15:437:35399:0:16:72:528:707:197:Times:197:Times:C:4. The Effect of Information Provision on Support for Education Spending 
15:438:35472:16:26:93:375:691:197:Times:197:Times:C:and Teacher Salaries in Germany and the U.S. 
15:439:35516:26:21:93:535:665:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our first two experiments study the effect of information provision on support for increases 
15:440:35609:21:21:72:515:644:144:Times:144:Times:B:in education spending and in teacher salaries, respectively. In both cases, respondents in the 
15:441:35704:21:21:72:524:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:treatment and control conditions were asked to indicate their preferences on a five-point scale 
15:442:35800:21:20:72:528:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:ranging from “greatly decrease” to “greatly increase,” with the middle category indicating that 
15:443:35896:20:21:72:510:582:144:Times:144:Times:B:spending or salary levels should “stay about the same.” To simplify presentation, our main 
15:444:35987:21:21:72:522:561:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimations of treatment effects are based on linear probability models where the top two and 
15:445:36081:21:20:72:540:540:144:Times:144:Times:B:bottom three response options are collapsed to create a binary indicator of support for a spending 
15:446:36180:20:21:72:529:520:144:Times:144:Times:B:or salary increase; we report conventional OLS standard errors. We also show results in which 
15:447:36274:21:33:72:499:499:144:Times:144:Times:B:the outcome is defined as the probability of support for decreased spending or salaries.13 
15:448:36364:33:26:71:281:466:144:Times:144:Times:B:4.1 Preferences for Education Spending 
15:449:36402:26:20:93:519:440:144:Times:144:Times:A:In the control group that did not receive any specific information, 60 percent of the U.S. 
15:450:36493:20:21:71:509:420:144:Times:144:Times:B:population and 71 percent of the German population favors government funding for public 
15:451:36581:21:21:71:510:399:144:Times:144:Times:B:schools to increase or greatly increase (Figure 3). Note that the lower support for increased 
15:452:36674:21:20:71:523:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:spending in the U.S. compared to Germany is consistent with the fact that spending levels are 
15:453:36768:20:21:71:517:358:144:Times:144:Times:B:currently higher in the U.S. than in Germany, independent of whether they are measured per 
15:454:36859:21:21:71:521:337:144:Times:144:Times:B:student, relative to GDP, or as a share of total public spending. A descriptive analysis of who 
15:455:36955:21:20:71:534:316:144:Times:144:Times:B:supports higher spending in Table 2 shows that in the U.S., females and poorer people are more 
15:456:37050:20:21:72:534:296:144:Times:144:Times:B:likely to be in favor of spending increases and in Germany, respondents with university degrees 
15:457:37145:21:21:72:280:275:144:Times:144:Times:B:are more supportive of spending increases. 
15:458:37188:21:21:93:526:254:144:Times:144:Times:A:Table 3 reports how the two information treatments affect support for education spending 
15:459:37277:21:20:72:527:233:144:Times:144:Times:B:(see also Figure 3). In each country, both treatments substantially reduce support for increased 
15:460:37374:20:21:72:525:213:144:Times:144:Times:B:spending. The strong majority in favor of spending increases turns into a minority of less than 
15:461:37470:21:21:72:525:192:144:Times:144:Times:B:one third among those who are informed about current spending levels and told that increased 
15:462:37563:21:20:72:511:171:144:Times:144:Times:B:spending would be financed through a tax increase. In this treatment group, preferences for 
15:463:37655:20:21:72:517:151:144:Times:144:Times:B:spending increases no longer differ significantly between the two countries. Being informed 
15:464:37747:21:18:72:535:130:144:Times:144:Times:B:about current spending levels reduces support for increased spending by 17 percentage points in 
15:465:37843:18:7:93:240:112:144:Times:144:Times:A:                                                 
15:466:37891:7:16:93:534:105:42:Times:99:Times:F:13 Supplemental analyses available upon request confirm that using ordered probit models with the dependent 
15:467:37999:16:12:72:514:89:99:Times:99:Times:F:variable coded 1 for “greatly decrease” to 5 for “greatly increase” yields qualitatively identical results to those 
15:468:38115:12:0:72:165:77:99:Times:99:Times:F:reported in Tables 2-6. 
16:469:38141:0:21:72:531:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:the U.S. (column 1) and by 20 percentage points in Germany (column 2). Treatment effects are 
16:470:38234:21:21:72:522:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:even larger in the second treatment that also raises the salience of tax financing: This reduces 
16:471:38331:21:20:72:526:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:support by 34 percentage points in the United States and by 41 percentage points in Germany. 
16:472:38424:20:21:72:525:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:That is, in both countries the information treatment reduces support for increased spending by 
16:473:38519:21:21:72:467:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:more than a quarter and the additional tax treatment reduces it by more than half.  
16:474:38603:21:20:93:524:605:144:Times:144:Times:A:Pooling the data from both countries (column 3) reveals that the effect of the information 
16:475:38694:20:21:72:509:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:treatment does not differ significantly between the two countries, whereas the effect of the 
16:476:38787:21:21:72:520:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:combined information and tax treatment is 7 percentage points larger in Germany than in the 
16:477:38879:21:21:72:527:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:United States. If the willingness to accept marginal tax increases is negatively related to status 
16:478:38978:21:20:72:531:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:quo tax levels, Germans’ stronger reaction to the tax treatment could plausibly be related to the 
16:479:39076:20:21:72:531:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:fact that the tax burden is higher in Germany than in the United States (OECD (2016)). Results 
16:480:39171:21:21:72:523:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:do not change qualitatively when controls are included (column 4), indicating that neither the 
16:481:39266:21:20:72:513:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:difference in support levels nor the differences in the treatment effect are due to underlying 
16:482:39361:20:21:72:512:440:144:Times:144:Times:B:demographic differences in the populations of the two countries. The same is true when the 
16:483:39452:21:21:72:528:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:controls are additionally interacted with a country indicator (column 5). This model allows the 
16:484:39548:21:20:72:495:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:associations of the control variables with support for spending increases to differ across 
16:485:39638:20:21:72:522:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries. Thus, to the extent that differences exist between the two countries, they cannot be 
16:486:39734:21:21:72:526:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:attributed to differences in background characteristics such as age, gender, education, income, 
16:487:39830:21:21:72:524:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:employment status, parental status, and migration status or in their association with opinions.  
16:488:39927:21:20:93:511:315:144:Times:144:Times:A:Column 6 reports the same model with an indicator for support for spending decreases 
16:489:40012:20:21:72:521:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:(rather than increases) as dependent variable (with the residual being respondents who prefer 
16:490:40106:21:21:72:511:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:spending levels to stay about the same). While the control mean is low in both countries (7 
16:491:40198:21:20:72:511:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:percent in the U.S. and 4 percent in Germany), the information treatment raises support for 
16:492:40290:20:21:72:531:233:144:Times:144:Times:B:decreased spending by 3 percentage points on average in the two countries and the information-
16:493:40384:21:21:72:534:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:plus-tax treatment raises support for decreased spending by 11 percentage points. Neither of the 
16:494:40481:21:33:72:466:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:two treatment effects differs statistically significantly between the two countries.  
16:495:40567:33:25:72:163:158:144:Times:144:Times:B:Replication Study 
16:496:40585:25:21:93:534:133:144:Times:144:Times:A:As a robustness check, we administered a slightly revised version of the experiment to new 
16:497:40676:21:21:72:509:112:144:Times:144:Times:B:representative samples of respondents in both countries in a follow-up survey in 2015. We 
16:498:40766:21:0:72:541:91:144:Times:144:Times:B:randomly assigned respondents in both countries (1,986 in the U.S. and 1,984 in Germany) either 
17:499:40864:0:21:72:492:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:to the control group or the information treatment group. In contrast to the 2014 survey, 
17:500:40953:21:21:72:533:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:respondents in Germany were informed about the average annual spending levels per student in 
17:501:41046:21:20:72:537:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:their respective Land, which varied between €5,800 (in North Rhine-Westphalia) and €8,700 (in 
17:502:41140:20:21:72:540:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:Thuringia). The provision of state-level information is particularly relevant for Germany because 
17:503:41238:21:21:72:465:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the Länders’ dominant role for education policy and funding (see Section 2.2). 
17:504:41319:21:20:93:529:605:144:Times:144:Times:A:Results of the follow-up survey are presented in Appendix Table A2. The control mean of 
17:505:41407:20:21:72:540:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:support for increased school spending is 61 percent in the U.S. and 74 percent in Germany. As in 
17:506:41503:21:21:72:517:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:the 2014 survey, being informed about current spending levels reduces support for spending 
17:507:41594:21:21:72:534:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:increases substantially in both countries (columns 1 and 5). In the U.S., the information reduces 
17:508:41692:21:20:72:510:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:support by 16 percentage points and in Germany by 15 percentage points. The fact that the 
17:509:41782:20:21:72:504:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:information treatment effect for Germany, while still substantial and highly significant, is 
17:510:41875:21:21:72:492:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:somewhat smaller in the follow-up survey than in the 2014 survey, might be due to the 
17:511:41961:21:20:72:530:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:presentation of state information rather than national information. In any case, the 2015 survey 
17:512:42058:20:21:72:528:440:144:Times:144:Times:B:results confirm that the negative effect of informing respondents about current spending levels 
17:513:42154:21:33:72:393:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:on preferences for higher spending is replicated in both countries.  
17:514:42223:33:26:72:266:386:144:Times:144:Times:B:4.2 Preferences for Teacher Salaries  
17:515:42261:26:20:93:539:360:144:Times:144:Times:A:The second survey experiment examines how the provision of information influences public 
17:516:42350:20:21:72:508:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:support for one specific category of education spending: teacher salaries. In contrast to the 
17:517:42444:21:21:72:497:319:144:Times:144:Times:B:relatively abstract concept of per-pupil spending levels, people are likely to have clearer 
17:518:42536:21:20:72:534:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:benchmarks drawn from their own personal experience when asked to evaluate whether a given 
17:519:42627:20:21:72:493:278:144:Times:144:Times:B:level of compensation is appropriate (an assertion we will return to in section 6 below). 
17:520:42717:21:21:93:511:257:144:Times:144:Times:A:In the uninformed control group, 62 percent of Americans support increases in teacher 
17:521:42803:21:20:72:539:236:144:Times:144:Times:B:salaries, as compared to just 29 percent of Germans (Figure 4). This difference is consistent with 
17:522:42902:20:21:72:530:216:144:Times:144:Times:B:the evidence presented above that teacher salaries are substantially higher in Germany than the 
17:523:42998:21:21:72:510:195:144:Times:144:Times:B:U.S., both in absolute terms and relative to other college graduates. Note that the pattern is 
17:524:43093:21:21:72:539:174:144:Times:144:Times:B:exactly the opposite from that observed for spending levels (which were lower in Germany, with 
17:525:43188:21:20:72:489:153:144:Times:144:Times:B:Germans more supportive of spending increases), suggesting that the between-country 
17:526:43272:20:21:72:510:133:144:Times:144:Times:B:differences in public preferences do not reflect overall differences in the level of education 
17:527:43367:21:21:72:540:112:144:Times:144:Times:B:spending or in the extent of support for increased educational inputs. In describing supporters for 
17:528:43467:21:0:72:540:91:144:Times:144:Times:B:salary increases, Table 2 shows that minorities and those with a college degree are more likely to 
18:529:43568:0:21:72:528:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:support teacher salary increases in the U.S.; females and older people are less likely to support 
18:530:43666:21:21:72:184:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:increases in Germany.  
18:531:43689:21:20:93:532:667:144:Times:144:Times:A:Table 4 reports the results of the survey experiment examining how informing respondents 
18:532:43778:20:21:72:523:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:about current levels of teacher salaries affects support for salary increases (see also Figure 4). 
18:533:43877:21:21:72:530:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:The information treatment reduces support for teacher salary increases by 24 percentage points 
18:534:43972:21:20:72:540:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the U.S. and by 12 percentage points in Germany. The difference in the absolute magnitude of 
18:535:44068:20:21:72:517:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:the treatment effects of 12 percentage points is statistically significant and unaffected by the 
18:536:44165:21:21:72:518:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:inclusion of control variables (columns 3-5). Likewise, conditioning on the control variables 
18:537:44259:21:21:72:527:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:does not qualitatively affect the German indicator, suggesting that the lower support for salary 
18:538:44356:21:20:72:483:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:increases cannot be attributed to demographic differences between the two countries. 
18:539:44440:20:21:93:535:502:144:Times:144:Times:A:In the uninformed control group, relatively few people support decreases in teacher salaries 
18:540:44533:21:21:72:488:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:(6 percent in the U.S. and 8 percent in Germany). In the U.S., this is unaffected by the 
18:541:44622:21:20:72:536:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:information treatment (column 6). In Germany, however, support for decreasing teacher salaries 
18:542:44717:20:33:72:480:440:144:Times:144:Times:B:grows by 8 percentage points when people are informed about current salary levels.  
18:543:44801:33:26:72:417:407:144:Times:144:Times:B:4.3 Heterogeneous Treatment Effects by Demographic Subgroups  
18:544:44862:26:21:93:497:381:144:Times:144:Times:A:Table 5 reports the two treatment effects of the school spending experiment and the 
18:545:44946:21:20:72:528:360:144:Times:144:Times:B:treatment effect of the teacher salary experiment for subgroups defined based on the following 
18:546:45041:20:21:72:519:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:characteristics: gender, parental status, employment status, minority status, income, age, and 
18:547:45136:21:21:72:539:319:144:Times:144:Times:B:education. There are hardly any significant treatment heterogeneities present either in the U.S. or 
18:548:45236:21:20:72:538:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:Germany. In particular, treatment effects are significant in all cases, and they rarely differ across 
18:549:45338:20:21:72:539:278:144:Times:144:Times:B:the subgroups. For example, none of the treatment effects differs in a noteworthy way for people 
18:550:45435:21:21:72:515:257:144:Times:144:Times:B:with different levels of income, age, or education. Neither do the information treatments act 
18:551:45529:21:20:72:509:236:144:Times:144:Times:B:differently for different ethnic groups in the United States. The only cases where treatment 
18:552:45622:20:21:72:530:216:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects differ statistically significantly across subgroups are the combined information-plus-tax 
18:553:45720:21:21:72:510:195:144:Times:144:Times:B:treatment in Germany by parental and minority status and the treatment effect in the salary 
18:554:45812:21:21:72:538:174:144:Times:144:Times:B:experiment in the U.S. by parental status and income level. We refrain from offering substantive 
18:555:45909:21:20:72:520:153:144:Times:144:Times:B:interpretations of these differences due to the large number of subgroup comparisons and the 
18:556:46002:20:0:72:250:133:144:Times:144:Times:B:associated risk of false conclusions.  
19:557:46043:0:26:72:477:707:197:Times:197:Times:C:5.   Explaining Differences between Germany and the United States 
19:558:46109:26:21:93:539:681:144:Times:144:Times:A:Both in Germany and the United States, informing citizens about current levels of education 
19:559:46201:21:21:72:521:660:144:Times:144:Times:B:spending and teacher salaries significantly reduces support for spending and salary increases. 
19:560:46296:21:21:72:506:639:144:Times:144:Times:B:Likewise, making tax financing requirements salient further reduces support for increased 
19:561:46385:21:20:72:531:618:144:Times:144:Times:B:spending in both countries. However, in absolute terms, the tax treatment effect is significantly 
19:562:46483:20:21:72:516:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:larger in Germany and the effect of the salary information treatment is significantly smaller. 
19:563:46578:21:21:72:532:577:144:Times:144:Times:B:Does this reflect differences in the composition of the populations, differences in the status quo 
19:564:46677:21:20:72:516:556:144:Times:144:Times:B:policies in the two countries, or genuine differences in public preferences? We have already 
19:565:46770:20:21:71:499:536:144:Times:144:Times:B:shown that treatment effects hardly budge when controlling for demographic differences 
19:566:46857:21:21:71:495:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:between the populations. We have also noted that the direction of the differences across 
19:567:46946:21:20:71:521:494:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries is consistent with citizens of the two countries reacting in similar ways to divergent 
19:568:47043:20:21:71:175:474:144:Times:144:Times:B:policy environments. 
19:569:47064:21:21:93:534:453:144:Times:144:Times:A:Here, we use two approaches to provide additional evidence suggesting that the differences 
19:570:47155:21:20:71:525:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:between the two countries reflect differences in current policy. As indicated, current spending 
19:571:47251:20:21:71:510:412:144:Times:144:Times:B:levels are lower, but teacher salary levels are higher, in Germany than in the United States. 
19:572:47345:21:21:71:512:391:144:Times:144:Times:B:Consistent with this, Germans in the control conditions are more likely to support spending 
19:573:47437:21:21:71:327:370:144:Times:144:Times:B:increases, but less likely to support salary increases.  
19:574:47494:21:20:93:539:349:144:Times:144:Times:A:Thus, a first approach is to look at treatment effects relative to the extent of baseline support 
19:575:47592:20:21:71:536:329:144:Times:144:Times:B:for increases in the two countries in the absence of any treatment. As is evident from the bottom 
19:576:47690:21:21:71:524:308:144:Times:144:Times:B:parts of Tables 3 and 4, treatment effects relative to control means are quite similar in the two 
19:577:47788:21:20:71:537:287:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries: Informing about spending levels reduces support for spending increases by 28 percent 
19:578:47884:20:21:71:493:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the untreated support level in the U.S. and by 29 percent in Germany. The combined 
19:579:47970:21:21:71:508:246:144:Times:144:Times:B:information plus tax treatment reduces support for spending increases by 57 percent of the 
19:580:48061:21:20:71:524:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:control mean in the U.S. and by 58 percent in Germany. And relative to the respective control 
19:581:48155:20:21:71:526:205:144:Times:144:Times:B:means, the information treatment reduces support for teacher salary increases by 39 percent in 
19:582:48250:21:21:71:503:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:the U.S. and by 42 percent in Germany. This pattern indicates that differences in absolute 
19:583:48341:21:21:71:521:163:144:Times:144:Times:B:treatment effects are directly related to differences in uninformed levels of support for policy 
19:584:48438:21:20:71:400:142:144:Times:144:Times:B:changes, which may in turn relate to differences in current policies.  
19:585:48509:20:21:93:488:122:144:Times:144:Times:A:To examine this possibility more formally, we link the analysis directly to current 
19:586:48593:21:21:71:535:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:differences in policy levels. To do so, we make use of the variation across U.S. states. We focus 
19:587:48691:21:0:71:512:80:144:Times:144:Times:B:the analysis on opinions on teacher salaries, where differences are starkest between the two 
20:588:48786:0:21:72:512:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries. The analysis proceeds in two steps: First, using our U.S. dataset, we estimate the 
20:589:48880:21:21:72:540:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:association between current levels of teacher salaries and support for salary increases across U.S. 
20:590:48980:21:20:72:513:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:states. Second, from that association we project the level of support we would expect at the 
20:591:49073:20:21:72:529:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:German teacher salary level and compare this to Germans’ actual support for salary increases.  
20:592:49167:21:21:93:534:626:144:Times:144:Times:A:Figure 5 illustrates this projection analysis. It confirms that higher average salary levels are 
20:593:49264:21:20:72:513:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:systematically related to less support for salary increases across U.S. states. The underlying 
20:594:49359:20:21:72:518:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:regression (which includes our standard set of control variables) indicates that an increase in 
20:595:49455:21:21:72:540:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:average monthly teacher salaries by $1,000 is associated with a decrease in support for increased 
20:596:49553:21:21:72:515:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:salaries by 0.8 percentage points (p-value 0.015). In units equivalent to the U.S. salary data, 
20:597:49649:21:20:72:512:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:current teacher salaries in Germany are at $ 85,450.14 Based on a linear projection from the 
20:598:49742:20:21:72:534:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:association across U.S. states, at this salary level we would expect 39 percent support for salary 
20:599:49841:21:21:72:535:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:increases, just 10 percentage points higher than the actual support of 29 percent. In other words, 
20:600:49940:21:20:72:508:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:differences in current salary levels can account for as much as 69 percent of the difference 
20:601:50033:20:21:72:450:440:144:Times:144:Times:B:between Germany and the U.S. in mean support for teacher salary increases.15 
20:602:50109:21:21:93:538:419:144:Times:144:Times:A:In this sense, even the German results on preferences for teacher salaries are consistent with 
20:603:50204:21:20:72:510:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:the U.S. results: The lower uninformed support level for salary increases is in line with the 
20:604:50298:20:21:72:508:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher current salary levels in Germany. And relative to this uninformed support level, the 
20:605:50390:21:21:72:492:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:information treatment effect in Germany is very similar to the one in the United States. 
20:606:50479:21:21:72:529:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:Differences in the absolute size of the treatment effects thus appear to be mostly attributable to 
20:607:50577:21:40:72:344:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:differences in the policy status quo in the two countries. 
20:608:50636:40:26:72:462:275:197:Times:197:Times:C:6. Information vs. Priming: Heterogeneity by Prior Knowledge  
20:609:50697:26:21:93:535:249:144:Times:144:Times:A:A potential concern with the evidence presented so far is that the apparent treatment effects 
20:610:50790:21:21:72:493:228:144:Times:144:Times:B:of information could reflect respondents having been primed to think about the topic of 
20:611:50878:21:34:72:514:207:144:Times:144:Times:B:education spending in terms of financial values, as opposed to respondents becoming better 
20:612:50969:34:8:93:240:173:144:Times:144:Times:A:                                                 
20:613:51017:8:16:93:540:165:42:Times:99:Times:F:14 To translate German salary levels into the units available for U.S. states (drawn from the U.S. Department of 
20:614:51130:16:12:72:538:149:99:Times:99:Times:F:Education’s Digest of Education Statistics 2012), we take the relative salary level of Germany compared to the U.S. 
20:615:51246:12:11:72:499:137:99:Times:99:Times:F:on an internationally comparable scale from the OECD (2014), p. 467 (using the statutory salary for lower 
20:616:51352:11:12:72:525:126:99:Times:99:Times:F:secondary teachers after 10 years), which stands at 148 percent of the U.S. level, and inflate the national average 
20:617:51468:12:9:72:253:114:99:Times:99:Times:F:salary level in our U.S. data by this amount.  
20:618:51515:9:16:93:514:105:42:Times:99:Times:F:15 Using salary levels at the upper rather than lower secondary level, where German salaries stand at 155 
20:619:51621:16:12:72:517:89:99:Times:99:Times:F:percent of the U.S. level, the expected support would be even closer to the true value at 36 percent, with salary 
20:620:51735:12:0:72:382:77:99:Times:99:Times:F:differences accounting for 78 percent of the U.S-German support difference.  
21:621:51813:0:21:72:483:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:informed. To shed light on this issue, we estimate whether treatment effects differ by 
21:622:51900:21:21:72:375:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:respondents’ prior knowledge of spending and salary levels.16  
21:623:51963:21:20:93:532:667:144:Times:144:Times:A:To be able to do so, we asked respondents to report their best estimates of current levels of 
21:624:52057:20:21:72:525:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:school spending and teacher salaries. In both countries, these estimation questions were asked 
21:625:52152:21:21:72:540:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:early in the survey and separated from the respective opinion questions by a number of questions 
21:626:52249:21:20:72:232:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:on other education policy topics. 
21:627:52283:20:21:93:525:585:144:Times:144:Times:A:Figure 6 shows distributions of the public’s estimates of spending and salary levels in the 
21:628:52375:21:21:72:536:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:two countries (expressed relative to the respective actual levels). Two patterns stand out. First, a 
21:629:52476:21:21:72:530:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:majority of the public in both countries tends to underestimate actual levels of school spending 
21:630:52573:21:20:72:537:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:and teacher salaries. In the U.S., the median estimate of spending per student is $3,000, which is 
21:631:52672:20:21:72:535:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:24 percent of the actual average spending level of $12,400. In Germany, the median estimate is  
21:632:52768:21:21:72:538:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:€1,500, or 23 percent of the actual average spending level of €6,400.17 Second, in both countries 
21:633:52866:21:20:71:496:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:the distribution of estimates of salary levels comes close to a normal shape, whereas the 
21:634:52956:20:21:71:534:440:144:Times:144:Times:B:distribution of estimates of spending levels, in addition to being further from the actual value, is 
21:635:53057:21:21:71:511:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:more diffuse.18 This might indicate that people do not have a clear anchor when estimating 
21:636:53148:21:20:71:512:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:current levels of educational spending per student, whereas they have a better anchor (from 
21:637:53240:20:21:71:504:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:knowing their own salary or salary levels in general) when estimating what teachers earn. 
21:638:53330:21:21:71:542:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:Therefore, estimates of teacher salary levels may be more informative and include less noise than 
21:639:53428:21:21:71:249:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates of school spending levels.  
21:640:53466:21:20:93:527:315:144:Times:144:Times:A:Thus, focusing first on the teacher salary experiment, we analyze whether the information 
21:641:53556:20:21:71:535:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:treatment effect differs by respondents’ prior knowledge of actual teacher salary levels. The key 
21:642:53654:21:21:71:521:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:result is displayed in Figure 7, which plots a linear estimate of how the probability to support 
21:643:53751:21:20:71:539:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:increased salaries depends on the prior guesses of teacher salary levels, separately for the control 
21:644:53852:20:32:71:528:233:144:Times:144:Times:B:group and for the treatment group.19 In the uninformed control group, there is a clear tendency 
21:645:53948:32:7:93:240:201:144:Times:144:Times:A:                                                 
21:646:53996:7:16:93:530:194:42:Times:99:Times:F:16 This approach to distinguishing information and priming effects was developed in an observational setting 
21:647:54105:16:11:72:541:178:99:Times:99:Times:F:by Lenz (2009) and has been applied in survey experiments by Cruces, Perez-Truglia, and Tetaz (2013), Clinton and 
21:648:54219:11:10:71:265:167:99:Times:99:Times:F:Grissom (2015), and Schueler and West (2016). 
21:649:54265:10:17:93:542:157:42:Times:99:Times:F:17 In both countries, the leftmost bar of the histogram is the highest one, containing estimates below 8.8 percent 
21:650:54380:17:9:72:338:140:99:Times:99:Times:F:of the actual value in the U.S. and below 8.3 percent in Germany.  
21:651:54446:9:17:93:524:131:42:Times:99:Times:F:18 The spikes in the distribution of German estimates reflect that respondents tend to answer in multiples of 
21:652:54556:17:11:72:532:114:99:Times:99:Times:F:5000 (spending) or 500 (salary) and that the denominator (the actual levels) is a national constant in Germany (but 
21:653:54672:11:10:72:141:103:99:Times:99:Times:F:not in the U.S.).  
21:654:54691:10:16:93:536:93:42:Times:99:Times:F:19 So as not to be driven by extreme outliers, we trim observations whose guesses were below one third of and 
21:655:54801:16:0:72:272:77:99:Times:99:Times:F:above three times the actual level in this analysis. 
22:656:54855:0:21:72:540:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:for respondents who had initially underestimated actual salary levels to be more likely to support 
22:657:54954:21:21:72:489:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:salary increases. In the treatment group that is informed about actual salary levels, this 
22:658:55045:21:20:72:198:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:association turns around.  
22:659:55072:20:21:93:539:647:144:Times:144:Times:A:The difference between the two lines illustrates the dependence of the information treatment 
22:660:55165:21:21:72:515:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:on prior guesses. In both countries, the treatment effect is largest for those who had initially 
22:661:55262:21:20:72:536:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:underestimated actual salary levels the most: Once these people learn that teachers actually earn 
22:662:55360:20:21:72:532:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:much more than they had thought, their willingness to support salary increases drops by a large 
22:663:55456:21:21:72:541:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:amount. This treatment effect of information in terms of decreasing support for increased salaries 
22:664:55555:21:21:72:521:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:decreases (in absolute terms) as the extent to which people underestimate actual salary levels 
22:665:55649:21:20:72:126:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:decreases.  
22:666:55660:20:21:93:515:502:144:Times:144:Times:A:For people who had roughly the correct guess about teacher salary levels, the treatment 
22:667:55748:21:21:72:506:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:effect is no longer statistically significantly different from zero. For them, the information 
22:668:55843:21:20:72:542:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:provided was already known, and indeed there is no treatment effect. Finally, for people who had 
22:669:55940:20:21:72:530:440:144:Times:144:Times:B:initially overestimated teacher salaries, the treatment effect turns in the other direction: Having 
22:670:56040:21:21:72:523:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:thought that teachers earned more, now being informed about the actual (lower) levels makes 
22:671:56132:21:20:72:523:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:these people more willing to support salary increases, and significantly more so in Germany.  
22:672:56226:20:21:93:524:378:144:Times:144:Times:A:The right panel of Table 6 shows these results in regression form. The treatment effect of 
22:673:56317:21:21:72:535:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:informing respondents about actual levels of teacher salaries shows a strong positive interaction 
22:674:56415:21:21:72:537:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:with the extent to which respondents had initially underestimated salary levels in both countries. 
22:675:56514:21:20:72:538:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:For respondents with low estimates of teacher salary levels, the information treatment (revealing 
22:676:56612:20:21:72:520:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:that teachers in fact earn more than they had thought) significantly reduces the probability of 
22:677:56708:21:21:72:535:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:favoring salary increases. For respondents who had roughly had the correct knowledge of actual 
22:678:56803:21:20:72:527:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:teacher salaries (with an estimate roughly equal to the actual level), this information treatment 
22:679:56901:20:21:72:529:233:144:Times:144:Times:B:effect is close to zero. And for respondents whose initial estimate was much higher than actual 
22:680:56997:21:21:72:540:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:teacher salary levels, the information treatment (revealing that teachers in fact earn less than they 
22:681:57099:21:20:72:508:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:had thought) turns positive, so that they are now more likely to favor salary increases. The 
22:682:57192:20:21:72:509:171:144:Times:144:Times:B:pooled model indicates that both the negative treatment effect for under-estimators and the 
22:683:57284:21:21:72:530:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:positive treatment effect for over-estimators are smaller (in absolute terms) in Germany than in 
22:684:57381:21:21:72:512:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:the U.S. when under- and over-estimation is measured in percent of the actual salary level.  
22:685:57474:21:20:93:507:108:144:Times:144:Times:A:For the school spending experiment, results from a specification that includes a linear 
22:686:57562:20:0:72:519:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:interaction between the information treatment variable and respondents’ estimates of current 
23:687:57657:0:21:72:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:spending as a percentage of actual levels are less clear. This is consistent with our suggestion 
23:688:57754:21:21:72:537:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:that estimates of spending levels—for which there is no readily available anchor on which to fix 
23:689:57851:21:20:72:533:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates—contain more noise than estimates of salary levels. However, the first three columns 
23:690:57946:20:21:72:525:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:of Table 6 confirm that a similar pattern of heterogeneity emerges from a simple specification 
23:691:58041:21:21:72:527:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:that interacts the treatment effect with an indicator of whether respondents’ initial guesses had 
23:692:58139:21:20:72:532:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:been above the actual value. In both countries, the effect of information is strongly negative for 
23:693:58238:20:21:72:529:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:the larger group of respondents who had initially underestimated spending levels, whereas it is 
23:694:58334:21:21:72:480:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:significantly smaller (in absolute terms) and close to zero for those who had initially 
23:695:58422:21:21:72:534:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:overestimated spending levels. In the pooled model, the treatment effect is 18 percentage points 
23:696:58519:21:20:72:535:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:smaller (in absolute terms) for those who initially overestimated actual spending levels, and this 
23:697:58618:20:21:72:522:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:difference by prior knowledge status does not differ significantly between the two countries.  
23:698:58713:21:21:93:541:481:144:Times:144:Times:A:A potential concern with asking respondents to guess spending levels is that doing so creates 
23:699:58807:21:20:72:536:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:a situation in which the information treatment explicitly corrects the false initial guesses offered 
23:700:58908:20:21:72:532:440:144:Times:144:Times:B:by most respondents. Since respondents might feel obliged to state spending preferences which 
23:701:59002:21:21:72:490:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:are consistent with the new information, the reported treatment effects might be due to 
23:702:59090:21:20:72:532:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:experimenter demand effects rather than genuine information effects. Presumably, this reaction 
23:703:59185:20:21:71:524:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:to the correction of false beliefs should be particularly prevalent among individuals who were 
23:704:59280:21:21:71:529:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:very sure about the accuracy of their estimate as compared to those who were very unsure. We 
23:705:59373:21:21:71:511:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:test this proposition in our 2015 follow-up surveys (see section 4.1), where we again asked 
23:706:59465:21:20:71:524:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:respondents for their best estimate of current spending levels and, in addition, asked how sure 
23:707:59561:20:21:71:519:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:they were about their guess.20 This allows us to test whether the information treatment effect 
23:708:59656:21:21:71:522:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:differs by the degree of initial uncertainty about the guess. Columns 2-4 and 6-8 of Appendix 
23:709:59750:21:20:71:482:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:Table A2 show that, in both countries, the information treatment effect does not vary 
23:710:59835:20:21:72:495:233:144:Times:144:Times:B:significantly with the uncertainty of the prior guess. This finding is inconsistent with an 
23:711:59927:21:21:72:537:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:interpretation where demand effects triggered by the correction of false beliefs are a main driver 
23:712:60026:21:20:72:143:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the results.  
23:713:60043:20:21:93:538:171:144:Times:144:Times:A:In sum, in both countries treatment effects of informing people about actual levels of school 
23:714:60137:21:21:72:513:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:spending and teacher salaries are strongly heterogeneous by respondents’ prior information 
23:715:60228:21:21:72:533:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:status about spending and salary levels. If all that the treatment did was to prime respondents to 
23:716:60327:21:19:72:532:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:think about spending and salaries in terms of dollar or euro values, treatment effects should not 
23:717:60425:19:7:93:240:89:144:Times:144:Times:A:                                                 
23:718:60473:7:0:93:485:82:42:Times:99:Times:F:20 Respondents indicated their certainty on a seven-point scale from “very unsure” to “very sure”. 
24:719:60574:0:21:72:539:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:differ by prior knowledge. The fact that they do indicates that they do not solely capture priming 
24:720:60673:21:21:72:479:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects, but in fact also reflect effects of people becoming better informed. The stark 
24:721:60761:21:20:72:500:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:heterogeneities in treatment effects by prior knowledge of spending and salary levels are 
24:722:60851:20:21:72:530:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:especially noteworthy in light of the fact that treatment effects for the same experiments hardly 
24:723:60949:21:41:72:242:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:differ across demographic groups.  
24:724:60984:41:26:72:472:585:197:Times:197:Times:C:7. Evidence on Tradeoffs between Different Spending Categories  
24:725:61047:26:21:93:525:559:144:Times:144:Times:A:To study support for different categories of education spending in greater detail, our third 
24:726:61140:21:20:72:501:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:survey experiment examines the effect of providing information on the tradeoff involved 
24:727:61228:20:21:72:503:518:144:Times:144:Times:B:between different spending options. In particular, supposing that the government plans to 
24:728:61318:21:21:72:522:497:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase spending in the school system, respondents are asked to choose one of the following 
24:729:61411:21:20:72:524:476:144:Times:144:Times:B:three options: reducing class sizes, increasing teacher salaries, and purchasing new books and 
24:730:61506:20:21:72:139:456:144:Times:144:Times:B:technologies. 
24:731:61520:21:21:93:538:435:144:Times:144:Times:A:In the uninformed control group, a plurality of respondents in each country favors class-size 
24:732:61614:21:20:72:531:414:144:Times:144:Times:B:reductions over the other options: 46 percent in the U.S. and 64 percent in Germany (Figure 8). 
24:733:61710:20:21:72:536:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:Consistent with the second experiment, fewer Germans (4 percent) than Americans (24 percent) 
24:734:61803:21:21:72:513:373:144:Times:144:Times:B:favor teacher salary increases. Roughly one third of respondents in both countries favor the 
24:735:61896:21:21:72:272:352:144:Times:144:Times:B:purchase of new books and technologies. 
24:736:61936:21:20:93:539:331:144:Times:144:Times:A:The treatment group is informed that in the U.S. (Germany), reducing average class sizes by 
24:737:62028:20:21:72:537:311:144:Times:144:Times:B:3 students would cost roughly the same amount as increasing teacher salaries by 13 (15) percent 
24:738:62124:21:21:72:519:290:144:Times:144:Times:B:or buying $10,000 (€20,000) in new books and technologies for each class every year before 
24:739:62215:21:20:72:538:269:144:Times:144:Times:B:choosing one of these three options.21 This treatment reduces support for class-size reductions in 
24:740:62314:20:21:72:529:249:144:Times:144:Times:B:both countries, to 35 percent in the U.S. and 48 percent in Germany. While in the U.S. support 
24:741:62409:21:21:72:506:228:144:Times:144:Times:B:mainly shifts towards increasing teacher salaries (33 percent), in Germany it mainly shifts 
24:742:62500:21:20:71:351:207:144:Times:144:Times:B:towards buying new books and technologies (46 percent). 
24:743:62556:20:21:93:521:187:144:Times:144:Times:A:Table 7 reports treatment effects on support for the different spending options as relative 
24:744:62648:21:21:71:519:166:144:Times:144:Times:B:risk ratios estimated by multinomial logit models. In both countries, the tradeoff information 
24:745:62743:21:21:71:506:145:144:Times:144:Times:B:significantly reduces the relative risk of choosing class-size reductions over teacher salary 
24:746:62837:21:23:71:505:124:144:Times:144:Times:B:increases. While the treatment effect is larger in Germany, the difference between the two 
24:747:62928:23:8:93:240:101:144:Times:144:Times:A:                                                 
24:748:62976:8:16:93:541:93:42:Times:99:Times:F:21 The differences in the calculated tradeoffs in the two countries are consistent with slightly smaller class sizes 
24:749:63093:16:0:72:382:77:99:Times:99:Times:F:and substantially higher teacher salaries in Germany (see section 2.2 above).  
25:750:63173:0:21:72:512:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries is not statistically significant. Given the difference in baseline support for teacher 
25:751:63270:21:21:72:539:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:salary increases, the treatment effect of tradeoff information on the relative support for increased 
25:752:63371:21:20:72:508:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:teacher salaries compared to new books and technologies also does not differ significantly 
25:753:63462:20:21:72:495:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:between the two countries. Only the difference in the reduction in support for class-size 
25:754:63552:21:21:71:503:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:reductions over new books and technologies between the two countries reaches statistical 
25:755:63641:21:20:71:393:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:significance, with the relative risk ratio being smaller in Germany. 
25:756:63709:20:21:93:515:585:144:Times:144:Times:A:In sum, support for education spending is affected not only by information on spending 
25:757:63796:21:21:71:495:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:levels, but also by information on the tradeoffs involved between different categories of 
25:758:63886:21:21:71:516:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:education spending. In particular, once aware of these tradeoffs, the public in both countries 
25:759:63981:21:20:71:529:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:expresses far less enthusiasm for class-size reductions. In the informed group, support is rather 
25:760:64079:20:21:71:496:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:evenly distributed over the three options in the U.S. and closely split between class-size 
25:761:64170:21:41:71:378:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:reductions and purchase of new teaching material in Germany.  
25:762:64231:41:26:72:262:440:197:Times:197:Times:C:8.   Discussion and Conclusions 
25:763:64263:26:20:93:514:414:144:Times:144:Times:A:In a series of survey experiments, we examine how various forms of information affect 
25:764:64349:20:21:72:521:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:public opinion concerning education spending in Germany and the United States. Our results 
25:765:64440:21:21:72:542:373:144:Times:144:Times:B:show that in both countries, providing the public with information on current spending levels and 
25:766:64538:21:21:72:514:352:144:Times:144:Times:B:clarifying the tradeoffs involved in allocating educational resources changes preferences on 
25:767:64630:21:20:72:508:331:144:Times:144:Times:B:education spending. In particular, information on current levels of education spending and 
25:768:64721:20:21:72:530:311:144:Times:144:Times:B:teacher salaries reduces support for spending and salary increases for the public as a whole and 
25:769:64818:21:21:72:534:290:144:Times:144:Times:B:within virtually all demographic subgroups. In both countries, these effects are confined largely 
25:770:64916:21:20:72:520:269:144:Times:144:Times:B:to individuals who had underestimated actual spending and salary levels, indicating that they 
25:771:65010:20:21:72:537:249:144:Times:144:Times:B:reflect genuine effects of becoming better informed. In addition, telling the public that increased 
25:772:65110:21:21:72:518:228:144:Times:144:Times:B:education spending would be financed through higher taxes further reduces support. Finally, 
25:773:65202:21:20:72:523:207:144:Times:144:Times:B:informing the public about the tradeoffs involved between different spending options reduces 
25:774:65295:20:21:72:518:187:144:Times:144:Times:B:support for class-size reductions in favor of teacher salary increases (mostly in the U.S.) and 
25:775:65391:21:21:72:349:166:144:Times:144:Times:B:purchase of new teaching material (mostly in Germany).  
25:776:65446:21:21:93:502:145:144:Times:144:Times:A:These experimental results are consistent with the preference model presented in our 
25:777:65531:21:20:72:506:124:144:Times:144:Times:B:theoretical framework. Our descriptive data indicates that, in both countries, the public on 
25:778:65624:20:21:72:487:104:144:Times:144:Times:B:average underestimates current levels of spending and salaries and—in the absence of 
25:779:65709:21:0:72:515:83:144:Times:144:Times:B:information treatment—tends to favor spending and salary increases. The preference model 
26:780:65800:0:21:72:527:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:therefore predicts that providing information about current levels of spending and salaries will 
26:781:65897:21:21:72:531:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:reduce support for increases; that making the implications of increasing education spending for 
26:782:65993:21:20:72:488:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:resource uses outside education salient will also reduce support for increases; and that 
26:783:66082:20:21:72:494:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:information on tradeoffs between spending options will affect their relative popularity.  
26:784:66171:21:21:93:518:626:144:Times:144:Times:A:In this general sense, the public in Germany and the U.S. responds quite similarly to the 
26:785:66261:21:20:72:525:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:provision of information on education spending. Relative to the baseline support for spending 
26:786:66355:20:21:72:529:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:and salary increases in the uninformed group, the information treatment effects are remarkably 
26:787:66450:21:21:72:524:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:consistent across the two countries. The country with higher current levels   differs for overall 
26:788:66548:21:21:72:540:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:education spending and teacher salaries—and so do our results on which country exhibits greater 
26:789:66643:21:20:72:514:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:support for increasing these levels. And while current teacher salary levels are substantially 
26:790:66738:20:21:72:537:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher in Germany than in the U.S. on average, Germans’ level of support for salary increases is 
26:791:66835:21:21:72:514:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:very much in line with what would be predicted based on the negative relationship between 
26:792:66925:21:20:72:420:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:salary levels and support for increases observed across American states. 
26:793:66998:20:21:93:534:440:144:Times:144:Times:A:These similarities in citizens’ reactions to information treatments may be surprising in light 
26:794:67093:21:21:72:536:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:of research emphasizing transatlantic differences. For example, the two countries we study have 
26:795:67189:21:20:72:534:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:adopted very different institutional structures for their societies, with Germany considered to be 
26:796:67288:20:21:72:509:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:the leading exemplar of the conservative welfare state and the U.S. the prototype of liberal 
26:797:67381:21:21:72:539:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:capitalism (e.g., Esping-Andersen (1990); Hall and Soskice (2001)). Other work has emphasized 
26:798:67475:21:21:72:525:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:how differences between the U.S. and Europe in political institutions, market regulations, and 
26:799:67570:21:20:72:542:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:social beliefs about matters such as the extent to which effort influences economic outcomes lead 
26:800:67668:20:21:72:519:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:to sharp differences in policy preferences (see Alesina, Glaeser, and Sacerdote (2001, 2006); 
26:801:67762:21:21:72:509:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:Alesina, Di Tella, and MacCulloch (2004); Alesina and Angeletos (2005); Linos and West 
26:802:67849:21:20:72:509:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:(2003)). Despite these differences, our results suggest that German and American citizens’ 
26:803:67939:20:21:72:519:233:144:Times:144:Times:B:preferences with respect to education spending are quite similar, as are their responses to the 
26:804:68035:21:21:72:196:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:provision of information. 
26:805:68061:21:20:93:523:191:144:Times:144:Times:A:The provision of more direct evidence for the notion that public preferences are the same 
26:806:68151:20:21:72:533:171:144:Times:144:Times:B:across countries is of course complicated by the fact that preferences are likely to be influenced 
26:807:68250:21:21:72:526:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:by the policies that are currently in place, which differ across countries. However, our surveys 
26:808:68347:21:21:72:511:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:indicate that Germans and Americans provide very similar responses when asked about the 
26:809:68435:21:20:72:521:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:importance of student performance to future prosperity: fully 97 percent of the public in both 
26:810:68530:20:0:72:536:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries stated that the academic performance of high school students is “very” or “somewhat” 
27:811:68627:0:21:72:533:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:important for the country’s future prosperity (on a four-point-scale ranging from “not important 
27:812:68724:21:21:72:506:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:at all” to “very important”). This similarity in perspective on academic performance lends 
27:813:68815:21:20:72:521:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:credibility to our suggestion that preferences are, in fact, similar across countries and that the 
27:814:68914:20:21:72:530:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:differences in documented policy preferences are largely due to differences in the policy status 
27:815:69011:21:21:72:96:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:quo. 
27:816:69016:21:20:93:542:605:144:Times:144:Times:A:In terms of policy implications, our results first illustrate how information matters in shaping 
27:817:69113:20:21:72:518:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:policy preferences. Citizens in both countries systematically underestimate what is currently 
27:818:69207:21:21:72:508:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:spent on education and, once provided with accurate information, update their preferences 
27:819:69297:21:21:72:535:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:accordingly. Our results therefore cast doubt on whether uninformed opinions accurately reflect 
27:820:69393:21:20:72:514:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:public preferences concerning the size of the education budget. At the most basic level, this 
27:821:69487:20:21:72:524:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:implies that public opinion polls are likely to be an unreliable guide for policymakers seeking 
27:822:69583:21:21:72:526:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:information on citizens’ true preferences with respect to education spending (Althaus (1998)). 
27:823:69678:21:20:72:519:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:Surveys that incorporate information about status quo spending levels across multiple policy 
27:824:69771:20:21:72:525:440:144:Times:144:Times:B:domains and clarify the implications of proposed changes for tax burdens are apt to produce a 
27:825:69865:21:21:72:292:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:more reliable barometer of public sentiment.  
27:826:69911:21:20:93:515:398:144:Times:144:Times:A:The results also shed light on the potential consequences of proposals prevalent in both 
27:827:70000:20:21:71:542:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries to improve information levels by increasing transparency about education spending, for 
27:828:70097:21:21:71:521:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:example by incorporating spending information into educational accountability systems (see, 
27:829:70189:21:21:71:516:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:e.g., Boser (2011)). In the U.S., a new requirement to publish school-level data on per-pupil 
27:830:70283:21:20:72:499:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:spending in annual school report cards was incorporated into the federal Elementary and 
27:831:70371:20:21:72:538:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:Secondary Education Act in its 2015 reauthorization in an effort to promote efficiency in the use 
27:832:70469:21:21:72:495:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:of public resources and expose inequities in the distribution of spending across schools. 
27:833:70559:21:20:72:510:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:Providing citizens with more information on education policy is also high on the agenda in 
27:834:70650:20:21:72:521:233:144:Times:144:Times:B:Germany. In 2006, the meeting of the federal and state ministers of education has instituted a 
27:835:70745:21:21:72:515:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:biannual national education report that reports on leading indicators in different educational 
27:836:70840:21:20:72:505:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:areas, including education spending, in increasing detail. Over recent years, several of the 
27:837:70933:20:21:72:516:171:144:Times:144:Times:B:individual Länder have also started to publish their own education reports. For example, the 
27:838:71026:21:21:72:526:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:government of Schleswig-Holstein announced that it will start to publish a biannual education 
27:839:71120:21:21:72:236:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:report again starting in fall 2016.  
27:840:71157:21:20:93:534:108:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our results suggest that such proposals to increase transparency may make it more difficult 
27:841:71249:20:0:71:532:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:to sustain public support for increased education spending. The importance of information does 
28:842:71346:0:21:72:508:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:not mean, however, that efforts to improve transparency about government budgets would 
28:843:71433:21:21:72:502:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:necessarily undermine public support for education budgets. First, in no case do we see a 
28:844:71523:21:20:72:536:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:majority emerge in favor of decreasing overall spending levels. Second, citizens may be equally 
28:845:71619:20:21:72:501:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:misinformed about spending levels in other policy domains. Providing them with similar 
28:846:71706:21:21:72:499:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:information on how much the government spends for other purposes (e.g., health care or 
28:847:71793:21:20:72:534:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:incarceration) might well lead to substitution effects towards education. Our results do indicate, 
28:848:71892:20:21:72:540:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:however, that equipping the public with better information about government budgets could alter 
28:849:71988:21:21:72:409:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:their views and help align spending levels with citizen’s preferences.  
28:850:72060:21:21:93:533:543:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our results also have a bearing on policies governing the allocation of education resources. 
28:851:72153:21:20:72:514:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:Specifically, they suggest that in the absence of information on the relative cost of different 
28:852:72249:20:21:72:540:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:spending options, people in both countries will support greater investment in class-size reduction 
28:853:72348:21:21:72:512:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:than would be the case if they understood its opportunity costs. In that sense, informing the 
28:854:72442:21:20:72:542:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:public about the tradeoffs between different forms of education spending may provide politicians 
28:855:72539:20:0:72:390:440:144:Times:144:Times:B:with leverage to reallocate resources within the education system.
