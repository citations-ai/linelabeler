3:21:870:22:12:141:448:706:10:Times:10:Times:Laboratory experimentation has been a growing field in economics for the
3:22:942:12:12:141:447:694:10:Times:10:Times:last decades.2But the more experiments have been conducted in economics,
3:23:1014:12:12:141:447:682:10:Times:10:Times:the more the issue of an appropriate methodology and organization has been
3:24:1088:12:12:141:167:670:10:Times:10:Times:raised.
3:25:1095:12:12:152:448:658:10:Times:10:Times:At the moment, there are the following items which are commonly agreed
3:26:1165:12:12:141:447:646:10:Times:10:Times:to be symptomatic for economic experiments (compared to human subject
3:27:1234:12:15:141:356:634:10:Times:10:Times:experiments in psychology and other social sciences):
3:28:1287:15:12:141:317:619:10:Times:10:Times:–Subjects are payed for their participation.
3:29:1331:12:12:141:448:607:10:Times:10:Times:–Payment should reflect subjects’ performance in the experiment, i.e.  the
3:30:1405:12:12:152:357:595:10:Times:7:Times:strategy space should translate to the payoff space.3
3:31:1458:12:12:141:442:583:10:Times:10:Times:–Subjects should be volunteers motivated by the experimenters’ payment.
3:32:1529:12:15:141:282:571:10:Times:10:Times:–Subjects should not be deceived.
3:33:1562:15:12:152:448:556:10:Times:10:Times:However, there is a wide variety in the procedures of maintaining a sub-
3:34:1634:12:12:141:448:544:10:Times:10:Times:ject pool and organizing experiments.  In this paper we introduce the Online
3:35:1710:12:15:141:423:532:10:Times:10:Times:Recruitment System for Economic Experiments (ORSEE), which aims
3:36:1773:15:12:141:411:517:10:Times:10:Times:–to simplify the organization of economic laboratory experiments,
3:37:1838:12:12:141:382:505:10:Times:10:Times:–to standardize the procedures of experiment organization,
3:38:1896:12:12:141:366:493:10:Times:10:Times:–to depersonalize the experimenter-subject interaction,
3:39:1951:12:12:141:372:481:10:Times:10:Times:–to allow the conduction of simple internet experiments,
3:40:2007:12:15:141:389:469:10:Times:10:Times:–to provide information and statistics about the subject pool.
3:41:2069:15:12:152:447:454:10:Times:10:Times:ORSEE has been implemented and has been online in Jena, Germany since
3:42:2138:12:12:141:448:442:10:Times:10:Times:March 2003. Currently, it is used at four institutions.4The software is main-

3:44:2282:12:12:141:448:418:10:Times:10:Times:list, a bug report and a feature request tracker.  In order to support the reader
3:45:2363:12:12:141:396:406:10:Times:7:Times:while going through this paper a test system has been installed.6
3:46:2428:12:12:152:448:394:10:Times:10:Times:Section  2  lists  the  functions of ORSEE  and some technical parameters.
3:47:2502:12:12:141:448:382:10:Times:10:Times:Next, we describe the two essential views of the system:  the public and the
3:48:2578:12:12:141:447:370:10:Times:10:Times:administration area. Section 5 and  6 show how laboratory andonline surveys
3:49:2653:12:12:141:309:358:10:Times:10:Times:can be conducted in ORSEE, respectively.

6:152:8634:11:12:115:421:347:10:Times:10:Times:registration form allows the user to change his data or to unsubscribe in order
6:153:8713:12:12:115:422:335:10:Times:10:Times:not to get further invitations.  To keep database integrity the account is not
6:154:8791:12:12:115:422:323:10:Times:10:Times:deleted internally.  If the subject tries later to register again with the system,
6:155:8873:12:12:115:421:311:10:Times:10:Times:the  system  recognizes him and an experimenter can  reactivate his account
6:156:8948:12:12:115:422:299:10:Times:10:Times:by hand.  On the privacy policy page we use to declare that we will delete
6:157:9022:12:12:115:326:287:10:Times:10:Times:personal data on written request (see next Section 4).
6:158:9076:12:12:126:422:275:10:Times:10:Times:An experiment invitation e-mail (see Figure 2) includes another link which
6:159:9150:12:12:115:422:263:10:Times:10:Times:leads to the participant’sexperiment registration page(see Figure 3). This
6:160:9224:12:15:115:226:251:10:Times:10:Times:page consists of three parts:
6:161:9253:15:0:115:422:236:10:Times:10:Times:–a list of future sessions of all experiments the participanthas been invited

7:169:9657:17:12:152:448:394:10:Times:10:Times:While the two latter parts only have informational character, the first list
7:170:9733:12:12:141:447:382:10:Times:10:Times:contains smallregisterbuttons on the right side.  If a user clicks on one of
7:171:9809:12:12:141:447:370:10:Times:10:Times:these buttons, he registers for the corresponding session.A text above the
7:172:9883:12:12:141:447:358:10:Times:10:Times:page informs participants about the binding character of the registration.  At
7:173:9961:12:12:141:447:346:10:Times:10:Times:the same time an e-mail is sent out to the participant’s e-mail address to in-
7:174:10039:12:12:141:447:334:10:Times:10:Times:form him again about the successful registration, containing the date, time,
7:175:10115:12:13:141:249:322:10:Times:10:Times:and location of the session.
7:176:10143:13:12:152:447:309:10:Times:10:Times:At a time specified at the administration page for the sessiona subject has
7:177:10218:12:12:141:448:297:10:Times:10:Times:registered for (e.g.,  48 hours before the session  starts),  asession  reminder
7:178:10298:12:13:141:282:285:10:Times:10:Times:e-mail is sent out to the participant.
7:179:10336:13:12:152:447:272:10:Times:10:Times:ORSEE provides no mean for subjects to deregister from a session.  We
7:180:10405:12:12:141:448:260:10:Times:10:Times:rather encourage subjects to check thoroughly if they are  available for the
7:181:10481:12:12:141:448:248:10:Times:10:Times:time of the session at the moment of experiment registration.  However, if
7:182:10555:12:12:141:448:236:10:Times:10:Times:there are reasons beyond his control, the participant can write an e-mail as a
7:183:10633:12:0:141:431:224:10:Times:10:Times:reply to his registration e-mail, and the experimenter willderegister him.

8:185:10745:34:22:115:253:449:12:Times:12:Times:4The Administration Area
8:186:10769:22:12:115:421:427:10:Times:10:Times:To access the administration area, an experimenter has to log in first.  User-
8:187:10847:12:11:115:421:415:10:Times:10:Times:names, passwords, and user rights are provided by a superuser administrator.
8:188:10923:11:12:126:422:404:10:Times:10:Times:Beside the experiment organization logic, the administration area provides
8:189:10997:12:12:115:422:392:10:Times:10:Times:a  bunch of useful functions.   In theoptions sectionnearly all settings re-
8:190:11073:12:12:115:422:380:10:Times:10:Times:garding the system can be done. These are general settings assystem e-mail
8:191:11147:12:12:115:421:368:10:Times:10:Times:sender address, defaults for forms and output, colors used,professions and
8:192:11221:12:12:115:422:356:10:Times:10:Times:fields of study known by the system, the schedule of regular tasks to be done
8:193:11298:12:12:115:422:344:10:Times:10:Times:automatically by the system,  default e-mail texts,  the  pagecontent for the
8:194:11375:12:12:115:322:332:10:Times:10:Times:public pages, and the FAQs listed in the public area.
8:195:11428:12:12:126:421:320:10:Times:10:Times:In this section, also the laboratories the system serves on can be registered.
8:196:11506:12:12:115:421:308:10:Times:10:Times:You may create different public experiment types to which participants may
8:197:11580:12:12:115:421:296:10:Times:10:Times:subscribe and match them with the internal experiment typesimplemented in
8:198:11653:12:12:115:363:284:10:Times:10:Times:ORSEE (laboratory and internet experiments, online surveys).
8:199:11713:12:12:126:421:272:10:Times:10:Times:Different sub-subjectpools can be set up.  At time of registration, subjects
8:200:11789:12:12:115:422:260:10:Times:10:Times:self-select to a subject pool by a provided self description.  This allows you
8:201:11867:12:12:115:422:248:10:Times:10:Times:to administrate different populations, for example undergraduate students at
8:202:11943:12:12:115:421:236:10:Times:10:Times:your university, professional internet experiment participants, PhD students,
8:203:12020:12:0:115:156:224:10:Times:10:Times:and so on.
9:204:12031:0:12:152:447:728:10:Times:10:Times:A special strength of ORSEE is it’s multilingualism.  Every output by the
9:205:12104:12:12:141:447:716:10:Times:10:Times:system (e-mails, pages, pdf files etc.) is configured in a hugelanguage table.
9:206:12182:12:12:141:448:704:10:Times:10:Times:Thus, every experimenter and even every participant may select the language
9:207:12257:12:12:141:447:692:10:Times:10:Times:to communicate with the system given that the language is installed. You may
9:208:12333:12:12:141:448:680:10:Times:10:Times:edit all output via the web interface, and even create a new language.  To do
9:209:12410:12:221:141:415:668:10:Times:10:Times:this, you have to translate the terms of an existing languageto yours.
9:210:12480:221:30:234:355:447:8:Times:8:Times:Fig. 4: Internal Experiment Calendar.
9:211:12517:30:12:152:447:417:10:Times:10:Times:Theexperiment calendar(see Figure 4) provides the current state of lab-
9:212:12588:12:12:141:448:405:10:Times:10:Times:oratory booking,  but also  the  timing  and  registration stateof  sessions  etc.
9:213:12670:12:12:141:447:393:10:Times:10:Times:You may access the experiments, sessions and participant lists directly from
9:214:12746:12:12:141:447:381:10:Times:10:Times:the calendar.  The calendar is sent to subscribed experimenters as a regular
9:215:12822:12:13:141:190:369:10:Times:10:Times:system task.
9:216:12834:13:12:152:447:356:10:Times:10:Times:In thedownloads sectionall general uploads like the system’s manual and
9:217:12905:12:12:141:447:344:10:Times:10:Times:files for experiments (like instructions, programs, presentations) uploaded by
9:218:12983:12:12:141:448:332:10:Times:10:Times:experimenters can be found.  This facilitates collaboration and learning be-
9:219:13059:12:12:141:226:320:10:Times:10:Times:tween experimenters.
9:220:13079:12:12:152:448:308:10:Times:10:Times:Theparticipants  sectionallows  the  experimenter  to  maintain  the  sub-
9:221:13153:12:12:141:448:296:10:Times:10:Times:ject pool.  You have the option to search through the current subject pool or
9:222:13230:12:12:141:448:284:10:Times:10:Times:’deleted’ participants (see below), to add new participants or to send out bulk
9:223:13309:12:12:141:447:272:10:Times:10:Times:mails to selected subjects.  At each participant’s page, youwill see a com-
9:224:13384:12:12:141:447:260:10:Times:10:Times:plete history of his experiment registrations and participation (see Figure 5).
9:225:13463:12:12:141:448:248:10:Times:10:Times:To keep database integrity, in ORSEE you cannot really delete a participant
9:226:13538:12:0:141:351:236:10:Times:10:Times:from the database. There are three options you have:
10:227:13591:0:57:221:315:558:8:Times:8:Times:Fig. 5: Participant Edit Page.
10:228:13621:57:12:115:422:501:10:Times:10:Times:1. You can unsubscribe the subject.  This is what the participant can also do
10:229:13698:12:12:126:422:489:10:Times:10:Times:himself at his personal data page.   An unsubscribed participant will not
10:230:13771:12:12:126:348:477:10:Times:10:Times:receive any invitations to experiment sessions anymore.
10:231:13826:12:12:115:422:465:10:Times:10:Times:2. You can exclude the subject.  This is nothing else than the unsubscription
10:232:13903:12:12:126:422:453:10:Times:10:Times:with an additional flag set that it was not the participant’s choice to get
10:233:13978:12:12:126:422:441:10:Times:10:Times:unsubscribed.   A reason for exclusion might be that the subject has not
10:234:14050:12:12:126:422:429:10:Times:10:Times:shown up at his booked experiment sessions for a certain number of times.
10:235:14123:12:12:115:421:417:10:Times:10:Times:3. You may empty the subject’s personal data.  This option is included due
10:236:14197:12:12:126:421:405:10:Times:10:Times:to privacy issues.  Only the subject’s ID will be kept in the system, but all
10:237:14274:12:12:126:422:393:10:Times:10:Times:personal data will be deleted. You may recover unsubscribedand excluded
10:238:14345:12:38:126:288:381:10:Times:10:Times:participant entries, but not emptied ones.
10:239:14387:38:12:126:422:343:10:Times:10:Times:A comprehensivestatistics sectionprovides user with summarizing data.

11:249:15069:38:25:141:338:468:12:Times:12:Times:5Conducting a Laboratory Experiment
11:250:15104:25:12:141:448:443:10:Times:10:Times:In this section we will describe the procedure of organizinga laboratory ex-
11:251:15180:12:12:141:448:431:10:Times:10:Times:periment with ORSEE. Theexperiment overview pagelists the current ex-
11:252:15249:12:12:141:448:419:10:Times:10:Times:periments already registered in the system (see Figure 7).   To list only the
11:253:15326:12:12:141:448:407:10:Times:10:Times:experimenter’s or already finished experiments, use the links in the menu on
11:254:15402:12:14:141:190:395:10:Times:10:Times:the left side.
11:255:15416:14:12:152:448:381:10:Times:10:Times:From here the experimenter may access the experiment main page of the
11:256:15485:12:12:141:448:369:10:Times:10:Times:listed experiments by clicking on the appropriate name, or create a new exper-
11:257:15563:12:12:141:447:357:10:Times:10:Times:iment.  On theexperiment creation page(Figure 8) she fills in the internal
11:258:15637:12:12:141:447:345:10:Times:10:Times:and public name of the experiment, a description, the type ofexperiment, her
11:259:15713:12:12:141:448:333:10:Times:10:Times:name and e-mail address. The public name is used to identify the experiment
11:260:15788:12:11:141:447:321:10:Times:10:Times:in the subject area of the system, the internal name is used atthe administra-
11:261:15866:11:14:141:312:310:10:Times:10:Times:tion pages and in e-mails to experimenters.
11:262:15909:14:12:152:448:296:10:Times:10:Times:After adding an experiment, the experimenter uses thesession creation
11:263:15978:12:12:141:447:284:10:Times:10:Times:page(which is accessible from the experiment’s main page) to register each

11:265:16128:12:12:141:448:260:10:Times:10:Times:number of participants needed and over-recruited, the  timeof  registration,
11:266:16204:12:12:141:447:248:10:Times:10:Times:and  when  the  reminder  should  be  sent  to  registered  participants  (see  Fig-
11:267:16288:12:0:141:448:236:10:Times:10:Times:ure 9).   When creating or editing a session the system checks whether the

12:270:16425:38:12:115:421:274:10:Times:10:Times:session clashes with another laboratory booking and the experimenter gets a
12:271:16500:12:14:115:154:262:10:Times:10:Times:feedback.
12:272:16509:14:12:126:422:248:10:Times:10:Times:Next, sheassigns subjectsregistered in the database to her experiment.
12:273:16579:12:0:115:421:236:10:Times:10:Times:When doing so, she can use different queries including name,e-mail-address,

13:275:16686:34:12:141:448:515:10:Times:10:Times:number of no-shows and registrations, sub-subjectpool, gender, profession,
13:276:16760:12:12:141:447:503:10:Times:10:Times:field and start of studies, and participation/registrationat certain old experi-
13:277:16840:12:12:141:167:491:10:Times:10:Times:ments.
13:278:16846:12:12:152:448:479:10:Times:10:Times:ORSEE provides the feature to select a random subsample of a defined size
13:279:16919:12:12:141:447:467:10:Times:10:Times:from the registered participants matching the query.  This should be used to
13:280:16995:12:12:141:447:455:10:Times:10:Times:prevent a bias regarding the fact that some subjects have immediate and more
13:281:17071:12:12:141:271:443:10:Times:10:Times:often internet access than others.
13:282:17105:12:12:152:447:431:10:Times:10:Times:Once  participants are  assigned,  the  experimenter sends aninvitation e-
13:283:17179:12:12:141:448:419:10:Times:10:Times:mailwhich lists the sessions’ dates and times and includes a linkto the sub-
13:284:17255:12:12:141:447:407:10:Times:10:Times:jects’  individualized registration page.   Following this link the  subject can
13:285:17335:12:12:141:447:395:10:Times:10:Times:choose one date out of the sessions available. When registering for a session,
13:286:17413:12:12:141:313:383:10:Times:10:Times:a confirmation e-mail is sent to the subject.
13:287:17458:12:12:152:447:371:10:Times:10:Times:When the registration period expires, aregular jobof the system checks
13:288:17528:12:12:141:448:359:10:Times:10:Times:the state of registration for the experiment. For each session, the experimenter
13:289:17608:12:12:141:447:347:10:Times:10:Times:gets an  e-mail informing her  about the  number of subjects registered,  and
13:290:17685:12:12:141:447:335:10:Times:10:Times:having attached a pdf-file containing the list of the names ofparticipants.  In

13:292:17842:12:12:141:448:311:10:Times:10:Times:period,  or cancel the session  at the very end.   At the time specified at the
13:293:17921:12:12:141:398:299:10:Times:10:Times:sessions’s edit page the session reminder e-mail will be sent out.
13:294:17987:12:12:152:448:287:10:Times:10:Times:During the whole registration process, the experimenter can observe the
13:295:18058:12:12:141:447:275:10:Times:10:Times:current state  of each session  at the experiment main page.   There are four
13:296:18135:12:15:141:248:263:10:Times:10:Times:states of a specific session:
13:297:18164:15:12:141:347:248:10:Times:10:Times:1.Not complete: There are not enough participants.
13:298:18214:12:0:141:448:236:10:Times:10:Times:2.About complete:  There are as much participants as explicitly needed for

14:300:18317:34:12:126:333:482:10:Times:10:Times:the experiment, but not enough reserve participants.
14:301:18369:12:12:115:421:470:10:Times:10:Times:3.Complete: The number of required participants plus the reserve is reached.
14:302:18445:12:12:115:421:458:10:Times:10:Times:4.Finished: All data was filled in for the session. The participation data will
14:303:18524:12:14:126:261:446:10:Times:10:Times:be used for the reputation system.
14:304:18558:14:12:126:422:432:10:Times:10:Times:We distinguish between five different independent states (flags) of a par-
14:305:18632:12:14:115:294:420:10:Times:10:Times:ticipant with regards to a certain experiment:
14:306:18678:14:12:115:421:406:10:Times:10:Times:1.Assigned: The participant is allowed to register for a session of thisexpe-
14:307:18755:12:12:126:155:394:10:Times:10:Times:riment.
14:308:18762:12:12:115:406:382:10:Times:10:Times:2.Invited: The participant received an invitation e-mail from the system.
14:309:18835:12:12:115:421:370:10:Times:10:Times:3.Registered:  The participant is registered for a certain session of a labora-
14:310:18914:12:12:126:192:358:10:Times:10:Times:tory experiment.
14:311:18930:12:12:115:404:346:10:Times:10:Times:4.Showed-up: The participant was at the right location at the right time.
14:312:19003:12:26:115:338:334:10:Times:10:Times:5.Participated: The participant really played the game.

14:316:19216:12:12:115:421:272:10:Times:10:Times:sion in the laboratory.  She fills in the show-up and participation data for all
14:317:19296:12:12:115:422:260:10:Times:10:Times:participants. When all data is filled in, she marks the session as finished, and
14:318:19376:12:12:115:422:248:10:Times:10:Times:its data will be included in the calculation of reputation score for the partici-
14:319:19457:12:12:115:421:236:10:Times:10:Times:pants. When all sessions are done, the experimenter marks the experiment as
14:320:19532:12:0:115:361:224:10:Times:10:Times:finished, and it will be listed in the "old experiments" section.

15:323:19667:22:12:141:447:478:10:Times:7:Times:A special experiment type implemented in ORSEE is an ’OnlineSurvey’.7
15:324:19736:12:12:141:447:466:10:Times:10:Times:After creation of the experiment, the experimenter fills in aspecial properties
15:325:19815:12:12:141:448:454:10:Times:10:Times:pagestating the start and stop time of the survey, the browser window size,
15:326:19890:12:11:141:448:442:10:Times:10:Times:and a short description of the experiment (mentioning required technology
15:327:19963:11:12:141:448:431:10:Times:10:Times:for participation and so on). The experimenter can restrictthe participation to
15:328:20042:12:12:141:448:419:10:Times:10:Times:invited subjects from the known subject pool or can allow forfree registration,
15:329:20121:12:12:141:448:407:10:Times:10:Times:specifying whether unknown participants have to fill in a personal data form.
15:330:20198:12:12:152:448:395:10:Times:10:Times:An online survey may consist of an introductory page, an instruction page,
15:331:20272:12:12:141:447:383:10:Times:10:Times:the personal data form, a number of questions, and an ending page. Each part
15:332:20348:12:12:141:447:371:10:Times:10:Times:is freely configurable in ORSEE. Questions are of a certain type, have certain
15:333:20426:12:12:141:448:359:10:Times:10:Times:predefined answering options, and are organized in items.  ORSEE supports
15:334:20499:12:12:141:448:347:10:Times:10:Times:’text lines’ and ’text fields’, ’select fields’ for numbers and text, ’checkboxes’
15:335:20581:12:12:141:448:335:10:Times:10:Times:and ’radio buttons’.  The latter two can be presented as matrices.  Questions
15:336:20658:12:12:141:351:323:10:Times:10:Times:and items can be given a numbered or random order.
15:337:20708:12:12:152:447:311:10:Times:10:Times:After having created and configured all pages and questions,the survey is
15:338:20781:12:12:141:448:299:10:Times:10:Times:ready to start.  Invited subjects can follow a link in their invitation e-mail to
15:339:20862:12:12:141:447:287:10:Times:10:Times:participate, and if free participation is enabled, the experiment is listed in the
15:340:20944:12:12:141:448:275:10:Times:10:Times:’Internet Experiments’ section of the public area. From thetime specified as
15:341:21020:12:15:141:448:263:10:Times:10:Times:the start time of the survey subjects are allowed to fill in thequestionnaire.
15:342:21098:15:12:153:447:248:6:Times:8:Times:7For the implementation of this module, we used methods described in Greiner, Jacobsen and
15:343:21188:12:0:141:193:236:8:Times:8:Times:Schmidt (2003).
16:344:21205:0:12:115:422:728:10:Times:10:Times:While the survey is running, the experimenter can observe the participation
16:345:21280:12:12:115:317:716:10:Times:10:Times:rate and some simple average statistics of answers.
16:346:21331:12:12:126:422:704:10:Times:10:Times:When the survey time runs out, no subject can start the surveyanymore.
16:347:21401:12:12:115:421:692:10:Times:10:Times:The experimenter may extend the time or end the survey by marking it as
16:348:21472:12:12:115:421:680:10:Times:10:Times:finished. Participant and decision data may be downloaded separately as excel
16:349:21549:12:34:115:168:668:10:Times:10:Times:spreadsheets.
