2:35:1899:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:Several Chinese cities have invested billions of dollars to construct new industrial parks.  These place
2:36:2003:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:based investments solve the land assembly problem which allows many productive firms to co-locate
2:37:2100:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:close to each other.  The resulting local economic growth creates new opportunities for real estate
2:38:2199:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:developers and retailers that develop properties and stores close to the new park.  The city mayor has
2:39:2301:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:the political clout and the personal promotion incentives to anticipate these effects as he chooses whether
2:40:2408:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:and where within the city to build the park.  Using several geo-coded data sets, we measure the localized
2:41:2513:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:spillover effects of the new parks on local incumbent firm productivity, the growth of retail activity
2:42:2615:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:close to the park and local real estate pricing and construction. We document the heterogeneous effects
2:43:2718:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:of investment in parks.  Those parks featuring a higher level of human capital, a greater level of co-agglomeration
2:44:2833:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:C:among firms within the park, and a smaller share of State Owned Enterprises offer greater spillover
2:45:2932:14:42:72:107:448:12:Times:12:Times:C:effects.

3:73:3519:0:34:89:168:756:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:Introduction 
3:74:3532:34:20:89:485:722:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:    The rise of edge cities in the United States has fostered urban growth through 
3:75:3615:20:21:89:500:702:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:providing global corporations with the advantage of cheaper land, and advanced new 
3:76:3698:21:21:89:504:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:capital infrastructure and a high quality of life for employees and executives (Garreau 
3:77:3786:21:20:89:486:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1991).  Over the last twenty years, China’s local officials have made much larger 
3:78:3868:20:21:89:482:640:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:place based investments as they have sought to create new suburban edge cities.   
3:79:3950:21:21:89:496:619:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:These new industrial parks are contained geographic areas within a city with special 
3:80:4035:21:21:89:500:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:land, tax, financial and economic policies to recruit highly productive manufacturing 
3:81:4121:21:20:89:478:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and service firms (Wang 2013).    Physical proximity between firms who seek to 
3:82:4200:20:21:89:503:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:co-agglomerate facilitates local productivity growth.    The well paid workers at these 
3:83:4288:21:21:89:495:536:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:new employment centers seek nearby housing and retail opportunities.    Real estate 
3:84:4372:21:20:89:505:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:developers and retail entrepreneurs respond to this increased local market potential by 
3:85:4460:20:21:89:499:495:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:supplying new housing and consumer amenities.    This “chain reaction” of new jobs 
3:86:4543:21:21:89:496:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:causing real estate construction and the opening of new high end retail opportunities 
3:87:4629:21:32:89:232:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:creates a vibrant edge city.     
3:88:4662:32:21:110:507:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Through its multi-billion dollar place based investments, China’s central and local 
3:89:4746:21:21:89:504:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:governments have made a large bet that the agglomeration benefits of industrial parks 
3:90:4832:21:21:89:506:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:offer a stream of benefits that exceed the upfront cost of establishing the parks and the 
3:91:4922:21:20:89:484:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:opportunity cost of allowing the land that the park sits on to be allocated for other 
3:92:5008:20:21:89:512:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:purposes.    Local governments have paid for place based projects using debt financing. 
3:93:5096:21:21:89:489:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:According to IMF estimates, local-government debt reached 36% of GDP in 2013, 
3:94:5174:21:20:89:484:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:double its share of GDP in 2008, and will increase to 52% of GDP in 2019.  The 
3:95:5253:20:21:89:509:276:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:popular press has suggested that China’s local governments face a potential major debt 
3:96:5340:21:21:89:503:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:crisis.1    This ugly scenario is less likely to occur if place based investments generate 
3:97:5431:21:21:89:511:234:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:significant economic spillovers. Wang (2013) estimates that industrial parks in Chinese 
3:98:5519:21:20:89:497:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cities increase the total factor productivity, foreign direct investment (FDI) and local 
3:99:5608:20:33:89:186:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:workers’ earnings.   
3:100:5629:33:21:110:492:160:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:China’s unique political system grants city mayors with powers that far exceed 
3:101:5708:21:20:89:491:139:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their Western counterparts.    China’s local leaders have strong incentives to pursue 
3:102:5794:20:21:89:509:119:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:economic growth because this increases their promotion chances. New industrial parks 
3:103:5879:21:13:89:506:98:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:can stimulate economic growth because they solve a co-ordination problem and a land 
3:104:5963:13:7:89:235:85:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:F:                                                             
3:105:6023:7:0:89:456:78:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:1  See http://www.wsj.com/articles/debt-that-once-boosted-its-cities-now-burdens-china-1422415981 
4:106:6123:0:20:89:500:758:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assembly problem (Combes et. al. 2012). Establishments that seek to co-agglomerate 
4:107:6206:20:21:89:485:738:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:within a small geographic area face transaction costs in simultaneously seeking to 
4:108:6289:21:21:89:501:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:co-locate. Even if they could agree to do so, there is no reason to believe that a major 
4:109:6378:21:20:89:458:696:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:city would have a large enough vacant plot of land that would allow them to 
4:110:6454:20:21:89:511:676:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:simultaneously execute this plan.    In this sense, the industrial park permits a degree of 
4:111:6546:21:21:89:483:655:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:co-ordination in a timely fashion that is unimaginable in a setting featuring a land 
4:112:6631:21:32:89:478:634:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:market with pre-existing durable structures and long lags between sales dates.   
4:113:6711:32:21:110:482:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This paper uses detailed within city geocoded data to study the Chinese local 
4:114:6789:21:21:89:509:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:governments past success in creating vibrant new edge cities. Our metrics of “success” 
4:115:6876:21:21:89:509:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:focus on economic dynamics within cities in geographic areas close to the new parks.   
4:116:6963:21:20:89:505:539:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We test whether successful “work-live-play” places emerge based on outcome criteria 
4:117:7047:20:21:89:468:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:such as localized job growth, TFP increases for incumbent firms, new housing 
4:118:7124:21:21:89:473:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:construction, increased home prices, and increased retail opportunities.    These 
4:119:7206:21:20:89:507:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:outcomes directly benefit the local government officials because their fiscal revenue is 
4:120:7295:20:21:89:485:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tied to the commercial and residential land sales, and also the tax from productive 
4:121:7379:21:33:89:133:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms.   
4:122:7387:33:20:89:489:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:    To test for the extent of localized agglomeration spillovers, we merge together 
4:123:7471:20:21:89:486:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:several geocoded data sets in China’s eight major cities – 120 industrial parks, the 
4:124:7556:21:21:89:500:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:productivity and employment data of manufacturing firms between the years of 1998 
4:125:7638:21:21:89:505:341:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and 2007, and the housing and retail data after 2006. This piece of our empirical work 
4:126:7725:21:20:89:472:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:builds on research documenting spatial industrial spillover effects (Greenstone, 
4:127:7806:20:33:89:368:300:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Hornbeck, Moretti 2010, Arzaghi and Henderson 2010).    
4:128:7861:33:21:89:484:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:    Previous research studying the effects of China’s industrial parks has focused 
4:129:7944:21:20:89:510:246:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:solely on the productivity impacts on the select set of firms who choose to locate in the 
4:130:8034:20:21:89:485:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:park (see Lu, Wang and Zhu 2015) and has studied the overall city level treatment 
4:131:8116:21:21:89:509:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effects of building a park (the treatment) in a given year and comparing growth in such 
4:132:8204:21:20:89:485:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:treated cities to a set of plausible control cities (Wang 2013). Using data on recent 
4:133:8290:20:21:89:498:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Chinese industrial parks (built between 2004 and 2008),    Lu, Wang and Zhu (2015) 
4:134:8373:21:21:89:470:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:document that such parks do cause a 12% increase in firm employment, 14.2% 
4:135:8448:21:21:89:494:122:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increase in output, and also significant increases in capital, capital to labor ratio and 
4:136:8538:21:20:89:510:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:labor productivity for firms within parks.  Our study differs from this past work along 
4:137:8626:20:0:89:494:81:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:three key margins. First, we focus on the localized spillover effects due to industrial 
5:138:8716:0:20:89:480:758:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parks based on very fine geographic level data. Second, we are interested in both 
5:139:8798:20:21:89:510:738:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:production and consumption spillovers, so we study how an industrial park triggers the 
5:140:8885:21:21:89:509:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:birth of an “edge city” featuring both production and consumption activities. Third, we 
5:141:8973:21:20:89:501:696:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:allow industrial parks to differ along several dimensions – the park’s birth cohort and 
5:142:9061:20:21:89:476:676:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:age, the synergy of industries within a park, and how a park “fits” with the local 
5:143:9144:21:21:89:501:655:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:incumbent industries. Estimating the heterogeneous effects of those parks allow us to 
5:144:9230:21:20:89:492:634:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:infer why some parks are successful and some are not in terms of forming a vibrant 
5:145:9313:20:33:89:470:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:“edge city” (as a subcenter) far away from the metropolitan area’s main center. 
5:146:9393:33:21:110:500:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our study builds on research estimating localized productivity spillover effects.   
5:147:9477:21:21:89:487:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Most agglomeration studies focus on the United States (see Rosenthal and Strange 
5:148:9558:21:20:89:491:539:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2004, Arzaghi and Henderson 2008, Greenstone, Hornbeck and Moretti 2010). Our 
5:149:9636:20:21:89:505:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:new estimates of the co-agglomeration effects builds on the estimates from developed 
5:150:9721:21:21:89:504:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cities generated by Ellison, Glaeser and Kerr (2010).    Several studies have examined 
5:151:9808:21:20:89:505:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the role of place based policies on U.S local and regional growth (see Rossi-Hansberg 
5:152:9894:20:21:89:469:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:et. al. 2010, Kline and Moretti 2013, Neumark and Kolko 2010). Their general 
5:153:9971:21:21:89:494:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:conclusion is that those place-based policies do not lead to net growth, instead, they 
5:154:10058:21:20:89:484:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:“reshuffle” economic activities from one place to another place. Such “zero sum” 
5:155:10139:20:21:89:495:395:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reshuffling suggests that place based policies do not lead to new growth and instead 
5:156:10224:21:21:89:486:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:can have perverse consequences by distorting the efficient allocation of resources. 
5:157:10308:21:21:89:505:353:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:However, this argument may not hold in China.    Macro research has documented the 
5:158:10391:21:20:89:492:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:productivity wedges across Chinese firms (Hsieh and Klenow 2009). If place based 
5:159:10472:20:21:89:504:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:policies, such as industrial parks, help to reallocate labor and capital to its highest and 
5:160:10564:21:33:89:366:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:best use then local economic growth is likely to result.     
5:161:10625:33:20:110:480:258:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our most novel empirical contribution is to study the consequences of urban 
5:162:10701:20:21:89:482:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sub-center growth on the emerging “consumer city” (see Glaeser, Kolko and Saiz 
5:163:10780:21:21:89:470:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2001).    Urban economists have increasingly been studying cities as centers of 
5:164:10860:21:20:89:500:196:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consumption.    This research has tended to focus on the United States and Europe. A 
5:165:10945:20:21:89:461:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:novel feature of our study is to link the rise of the industrial parks (centers of 
5:166:11028:21:21:89:509:155:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:production) to the emergence of new consumer city clusters.    While China’s cities are 
5:167:11116:21:21:89:504:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:known for their high levels of urban air pollution (see Zheng and Kahn 2013), there is 
5:168:11203:21:20:89:492:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nascent rising demand for quality of life in China’s cities.    Quality of life is both a 
5:169:11293:20:0:89:502:93:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:function of city level local public goods such as climate and air pollution but is also a 
6:170:11385:0:20:89:512:758:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:function of consumer opportunities (Waldfogel 2008).    Industrial park workers seek to 
6:171:11473:20:21:89:500:738:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reduce their commute costs and they are well paid, thus new residential communities 
6:172:11557:21:21:89:489:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and retail opportunities emerge close to the new parks (Lucas and Rossi-Hansberg, 
6:173:11639:21:20:89:507:696:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2002). Moretti (2010) estimates such local multipliers using US census data, and finds 
6:174:11726:20:21:89:506:676:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that for each additional job in manufacturing in a given city, 1.6 jobs are created in the 
6:175:11817:21:21:89:512:655:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nontradable sector in the same city, and this effect is significantly larger for skilled jobs 
6:176:11911:21:20:89:502:634:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:because they command higher earnings (2.5 for skilled jobs and 1 for unskilled jobs). 
6:177:11997:20:21:89:477:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:While past consumer city research has focused on developed nations, one of our 
6:178:12076:21:21:89:506:593:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:paper’s contributions is to document the rise of nascent consumer cities in Communist 
6:179:12162:21:33:89:124:572:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:China. 
6:180:12169:33:20:110:498:539:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The benefits of place based policies are likely to be localized and heterogeneous 
6:181:12251:20:21:89:505:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(Glaeser and Gottlieb 2008, Kline 2010, Faggio, Silva and Strange, 2015). We present 
6:182:12336:21:21:89:489:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:new evidence on the heterogeneous spillover effects of different types of industrial 
6:183:12421:21:20:89:476:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parks. We test several ideas from the economic geography and urban economics 
6:184:12498:20:21:89:505:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:literature (Moretti 2004, Rauch 1999). Parks that feature a higher human capital level, 
6:185:12586:21:21:89:505:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a lower level of State Owned Enterprise share and parks that are a better “fit” with the 
6:186:12675:21:20:89:492:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:local incumbent industries (in terms of stronger input-output linkages, labor market 
6:187:12760:20:21:89:507:395:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pooling, and knowledge spillover) have larger local spillovers.    Our micro data based 
6:188:12848:21:21:89:507:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:approach allows us to test for a rich set of such heterogeneous effects, and to study the 
6:189:12938:21:33:89:303:353:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:key mechanisms generating such spillovers. 
6:190:12981:33:20:110:492:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Industrial parks are not assigned to geographic locations at random.  They are 
6:191:13060:20:21:89:510:300:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more likely to be built at the suburban fringe where land is cheaper and has not already 
6:192:13149:21:21:89:492:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:been developed.    We argue that both the invisible hand and the Chinese “managed 
6:193:13231:21:20:89:507:258:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hand” of the state play a key role as there is a complementarity between highways and 
6:194:13317:20:21:89:495:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fringe industrial parks. Measuring the benefits of active industrial policy remains an 
6:195:13404:21:21:89:511:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:open research topic (Beason and Weinstein 1996, Harrison and Rodriguez-Clare 2009). 
6:196:13488:21:20:89:496:196:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We carefully discuss site selection issues and study how this affects our estimates of 
6:197:13575:20:21:89:504:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:productivity and consumption spillovers.    We contrast OLS and IV estimates of park 
6:198:13660:21:21:89:498:155:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spillover effects on local economic activity in which we instrument for the industrial 
6:199:13747:21:21:89:475:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:park’s location within a city.    We argue that OLS and IV estimates of localized 
6:200:13829:21:20:89:506:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spillover effects answer two distinct economic questions.    OLS estimates of spillover 
6:201:13917:20:0:89:481:93:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effects associated with industrial parks built in specific parts of the city provide a 
7:202:14006:0:20:89:488:758:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:historical ex-post evaluation of the effectiveness of past Chinese Communist Party 
7:203:14089:20:21:89:487:738:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:industrial policy investments.    In a second set of results, we instrument for where 
7:204:14175:21:21:89:514:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parks are built using topographic, historical land use and population density variables.  
7:205:14265:21:20:89:457:696:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:These instruments proxy for the economic cost of building a park in a given 
7:206:14341:20:21:89:502:676:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:geographic location within a city.    By using such cost shifters as instruments, our IV 
7:207:14430:21:21:89:492:655:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:results recover estimates of the productivity effects of park construction in low cost 
7:208:14517:21:20:89:499:634:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:versus high cost areas within a city.    As we will discuss below, we control for many 
7:209:14604:20:21:89:506:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:observed attributes of different locations such as each location’s distance from the city 
7:210:14694:21:21:89:502:593:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:center.    Thus, in our IV regressions we will be comparing the productivity dynamics 
7:211:14780:21:21:89:457:572:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for areas equidistant to the city center that differ with respect to their cost of 
7:212:14863:21:32:89:216:551:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:constructing a new park.   
7:213:14890:32:21:110:477:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Sections 2 we introduce the 
7:214:14968:21:21:89:501:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:institutional background and our conceptual framework; Section 3 describes data and 
7:215:15052:21:20:89:488:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:models industrial parks’ site selection. Section 4 and 5 present our estimates of the 
7:216:15138:20:33:89:474:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:production and consumption spillovers, respectively. We conclude in Section 6.

7:219:15255:34:33:89:403:355:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:2.1 Industrial Parks and Local Leaders’ Investment Problem 
7:220:15314:33:20:110:499:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Local leaders who seek to be promoted within the Chinese political system have 
7:221:15393:20:21:89:515:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:strong incentives to invest in projects that yield local economic growth (Wu et. al. 2013, 
7:222:15484:21:21:89:483:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Zheng et. al. 2014).    The goal of establishing industrial parks is to promote FDI, 
7:223:15569:21:20:89:498:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:international trade, technological innovation and employment. Industrial parks are at 
7:224:15655:20:21:89:460:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:different levels: state-level, provincial-level, and prefecture (or below)-level. 
7:225:15737:21:21:89:489:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Higher-level parks enjoy more favorable policies, such as lower interest rate loans, 
7:226:15822:21:21:89:498:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:larger tax, land price and utility price discounts. In this paper we focus on state-level 
7:227:15912:21:20:89:493:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and provincial-level parks.2    Being a host city of such parks has become a favorite 
7:228:15998:20:31:89:464:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:strategy of city mayors to compete for FDI and foster local economic growth. 
7:229:16075:31:7:89:235:126:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:F:                                                             
7:230:16135:7:14:89:480:119:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:2  The reason that we only focus on state-level and provincial level parks is because many of the lower-level 
7:231:16245:14:11:89:481:105:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:industrial parks did not obtain formal approval from the central and provincial governments and violated the 
7:232:16354:11:10:89:494:94:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:relevant laws and regulations. In 2003, the central government did a thorough investigation into industrial parks 
7:233:16468:10:10:89:504:84:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:regarding the violation of land use regulation and other regulations. A large number of those lower-level industrial 
7:234:16585:10:0:89:483:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:parks were abolished after this investigation. See detailed documentation in Cartier (2001) and Adler (2013). 
8:235:16697:0:20:110:494:758:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In choosing whether to invest in a park, local leaders face a trade-off between a 
8:236:16779:20:21:89:496:738:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stream of benefits an industrial parks offers and the upfront and opportunity costs of 
8:237:16866:21:21:89:502:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:establishing the park. To create a park, a local leader acquires a large parcel of vacant 
8:238:16956:21:20:89:500:696:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:land (or relocates current residents).    Industrial parks are highly land intensive. This 
8:239:17047:20:21:89:499:676:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:land must be acquired and this land has a major opportunity cost as developers could 
8:240:17132:21:21:89:506:655:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:build new residential towers or commercial properties.    Land closer to the city center 
8:241:17221:21:20:89:507:634:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is already occupied and is expensive to acquire. Suburban fringe farmland represents a 
8:242:17308:20:21:89:498:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:much more attractive location for building parks due to the low land conversion cost 
8:243:17393:21:21:89:489:593:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:there.3  Once the leader acquires the land, he invests to improve the infrastructure 
8:244:17478:21:21:89:489:572:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:including; paved roads, highways, sewage system, the supply of water, power, gas, 
8:245:17560:21:20:89:463:551:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cable and phone services and some landscaping.  The leader also introduces 
8:246:17635:20:21:89:502:531:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:preferential policies for potential park entrants to attract productive firms, such as tax 
8:247:17726:21:21:89:504:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:break and customs duty exemption, discounted land-use fees, and special treatment in 
8:248:17811:21:32:89:322:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:securing bank loans (Wang 2013, Adler 2013).   
8:249:17858:32:21:110:507:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Chinese local leaders are powerful but capital constrained. If they are able to raise 
8:250:17944:21:21:89:515:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:enough funds, they can build a park quickly. They raise funds through various channels. 
8:251:18032:21:20:89:493:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:On average, bank loans, land sale revenue and on-budget fiscal revenue account for 
8:252:18115:20:21:89:501:395:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:28%, 25% and 33% of the sources of municipal infrastructure investment in China in 
8:253:18198:21:21:89:489:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2010, respectively, and the rest of the money comes from other non-bank financial 
8:254:18280:21:21:89:509:353:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:channels.4  Some local leaders borrow heavily. An industrial park in Liaoning province 
8:255:18367:21:20:89:490:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:plans to invest 4.2 billion yuan (US$680 million) in 2015, and almost 100% of this 
8:256:18450:20:33:89:304:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investment comes from bank or trust loans.5 
8:257:18493:33:21:110:501:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Each    industrial park has an Administrative Committee (AC), which, on behalf of 
8:258:18575:21:20:89:510:258:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the city government, takes the responsibility to direct and to administer the park – such 
8:259:18665:20:21:89:495:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as project approval, local taxation, land management, finance, personnel, and public 
8:260:18750:21:21:89:500:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:service provision. Once an industrial park is built, the AC leaders will actively solicit 
8:261:18840:21:39:89:417:196:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:FDI and domestic firms with the potential to be highly productive.   
8:262:18909:39:7:89:235:157:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:F:                                                             
8:263:18969:7:14:89:507:150:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:3  Such farmland was owned by rural villages. If the city government (the upper government of those rural villages) 
8:264:19085:14:11:89:478:136:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:wants to build a new industrial park on the farmland, it needs to covert the use type of that land parcel from 
8:265:19196:11:10:89:489:125:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:agriculture use to industrial use, and compensate the rural village. In most cases the range of compensation for 
8:266:19309:10:10:89:506:115:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:farmers for land taken is quite low because it is often based on income generated in agriculture use instead of being 
8:267:19427:10:7:89:441:105:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:tied to its opportunity cost (the value of the land if allocated to urban use) (Ding and Song 2005).

9:271:19814:0:20:110:486:758:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The Park’s AC has a plan for the park’s industrial composition and the anchor 
9:272:19892:20:21:89:492:738:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:industries (for instance car producers or biotech companies). A recruitment strategy 
9:273:19977:21:21:89:502:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:will intend to maximize the industrial synergies both within the park and in a vicinity 
9:274:20065:21:20:89:510:696:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the park.    Private negotiations take place between the AC and the potential entrants 
9:275:20155:20:21:89:498:676:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:regarding the exact bundle of subsidies each firm will receive if it agrees to enter the 
9:276:20244:21:33:89:510:655:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:park.    The AC will offer additional incentives to those firms that they desire the most. 
9:277:20335:33:20:110:505:622:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This recruitment process bears a close resemblance to the anchor tenant issue that 
9:278:20418:20:21:89:469:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:arises in filling a successful shopping mall (Pashigian and Gould 1998, Gould, 
9:279:20497:21:21:89:507:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Pashigian and Prendergast 2005) and the development of U.S suburban planned towns 
9:280:20579:21:21:89:498:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(Henderson and Mitra 1996). Both the owner of a mall and the Chinese local leaders 
9:281:20662:21:20:89:502:539:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:has a strong incentive to internalize the spillovers taking place within their respective 
9:282:20752:20:21:89:506:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:borders.  A key difference between mall owners and local leaders is that mall owners 
9:283:20837:21:21:89:497:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:only gain profit from activity within their mall.    In U.S edge cities, developers only 
9:284:20926:21:20:89:508:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:internalize the spillover gains taking place within their land parcel’s area.    If there are 
9:285:21020:20:21:89:494:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:positive spillover effects from a mall to the local community, the mall owner has no 
9:286:21105:21:21:89:505:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:claim to those. In contrast, Chinese local leaders have an incentive to internalize these 
9:287:21195:21:20:89:509:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:additional outside the park spillover effects, because their goal is to maximize the total 
9:288:21286:20:21:89:506:395:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:output from all the economic activities within their political boundary.    In the case of 
9:289:21377:21:21:89:508:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:U.S edge cities, the edge city competes with the center city and may make choices that 
9:290:21464:21:21:89:496:353:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:do not maximize the synergies with the incumbent center city (Henderson and Mitra 
9:291:21546:21:20:89:490:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1996, Orfield 2011).    In the Chinese case, the city mayor is in charge of the entire 
9:292:21633:20:21:89:506:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:jurisdiction (including the center city and the edge city) and thus internalizes all of the 
9:293:21725:21:21:89:480:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:possible synergistic effects.    The main purpose of this paper is to estimate those 
9:294:21810:21:20:89:469:270:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spillovers and explore the heterogeneity in such spillovers with respect to park 
9:295:21891:20:33:89:503:250:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:attributes, and the extent to which this park “fits” with the local incumbent industries.

9:297:22050:33:20:110:513:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We  will  estimate  the  localized  production  and  consumption  spillovers  that  an

9:299:22230:21:21:89:513:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:motivate  our  empirical  approach.  The  goal  of  our  empirical  work  is  quantify  the 
9:300:22322:21:33:89:434:122:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:“chain reaction” created by the introduction of a new industrial park.     
9:301:22397:33:0:110:513:89:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our starting point is that industrial parks attract productive firms, and also improve 
10:302:22486:0:20:89:513:758:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the productivity of incumbent firms located close and within the park.  S   uch parks 
10:303:22572:20:21:89:512:738:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:will  have  no  aggregate  impact  on  urban  growth  if  their  creation  simply  leads  to  a 
10:304:22668:21:21:89:512:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spatial  reshuffling  of  economic  activity  that  would  have  located  somewhere  in  the 
10:305:22761:21:20:89:512:696:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:same  city  had  the  park  not  been  created.  Wang  (2013)  presents  a  cross-city  study 
10:306:22855:20:21:89:518:676:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:documenting the positive overall effect of China’s industrial parks on urban growth.   
10:307:22942:21:21:89:512:655:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Such a city/macro study abstracts away from internal workings of a city and that study 
10:308:23029:21:20:89:512:634:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:did not examine how the real estate market or the retail sector is affected by the growth 
10:309:23119:20:33:89:304:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of a major suburban employment center.

10:312:23269:21:20:89:512:527:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:production function. All else equal, firms located closer to the city center (where the 
10:313:23357:20:21:89:512:507:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:main  agglomeration  takes  place)  are  more  productive.    Standard  urban  economics 
10:314:23446:21:21:89:512:486:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:logic  posits  that  a  geographic  location’s  distance  to  the  city  center  is  a  sufficient 
10:315:23545:21:20:89:512:465:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:statistic for measuring this agglomeration force.    Once an industrial park is built, each 
10:316:23637:20:21:89:512:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:location within a city becomes two dimensional as we track the plant’s distance to the 
10:317:23724:21:21:89:512:424:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:city center and its distance to the closest industrial park. If a city has multiple parks, 
10:318:23815:21:20:89:512:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:other parks will also have some effect on this plant. In the empirical analysis we will 
10:319:23903:20:21:89:512:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:construct a variable to measure this global impact of all the parks in the city, but now 
10:320:23992:21:33:89:362:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we abstract from this and only consider the closest park.

15:459:34354:21:21:89:512:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:plants in our data set, we know their zone identifiers, and for about 60% of them we 
15:460:34439:21:20:89:513:622:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:know their small zone identifiers. We know the exact street address of all residential 
15:461:34526:20:21:89:512:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:complexes and retail establishments. We set up 2 km*2 km grid maps (each cell is 4

15:470:35135:21:20:89:512:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Industrial  Parks”,  there  are  120  state-  and  provincial-level  industrial  parks  in  these 
15:471:35233:20:21:89:513:347:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:eight cities, accounting for 8.6% in all such parks in China. From the list we know each

15:479:35898:33:22:110:510:169:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Chinese cities have experienced four waves of establishing industrial parks: 1978
15:480:35979:22:22:89:513:147:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:B:–1985,  1986–1990,  1991–1995,  and  1996–2008  (Wang  2013).  The  first  three 
15:481:36060:22:20:89:512:125:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:waves happened before the start year of our manufacturing plants data set, and the last 
15:482:36148:20:7:89:235:105:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:F:                                                             
15:483:36208:7:14:89:509:98:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:8  The largest park is 64, and the smallest one of 0.2 square kilometers. If we measure the distance from the centroid 
15:484:36327:14:10:89:504:84:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:of a park to the corresponding city’s CBD, the average park is located 24.9 kilometers away. The most remote park 
15:485:36441:10:0:89:230:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:is 95.1 kilometers from the city center. 
16:486:36485:0:20:89:512:758:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wave almost overlaps with our data set. So we define the parks established before1996 
16:487:36571:20:33:89:430:738:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as “old parks”, and those established in or after 1996 as “new parks”.

16:489:36678:33:20:110:513:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We obtain plant-level data from the Annual Survey of Industrial Firms (ASIFs) 
16:490:36756:20:21:89:512:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dataset  conducted  by  National  Bureau  of  Statistics  of  China  (NBSC)  from  1998  to 
16:491:36848:21:21:89:513:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2007. All  the  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  and  non-state  owned  enterprises  with 
16:492:36939:21:20:89:513:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:annual sales of more than 500 million RMB in the manufacturing sector are surveyed,

16:494:37110:21:21:89:512:569:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:all financial variables. Those firms hire roughly 70% of the industrial employment,

16:496:37281:21:20:89:512:527:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:advantage of this ASIFs data set (compared to the economic census data set) is that it 
16:497:37368:20:21:89:512:507:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:enables us to estimate plant-level total factor productivity (TFP). We use the data on 
16:498:37455:21:21:89:512:486:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:outputs and intermediate inputs, deflated by output and input price indices in Brandt et 
16:499:37544:21:20:89:512:465:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:al.(2012), to calculate real capital stock, real value added, and then estimate plant-level 
16:500:37636:20:21:89:512:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:TFP. We link  plants  over time using their information  on  ID, name, industry  code, 
16:501:37723:21:21:89:512:424:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:small zone/zone identifier, etc., and construct an unbalanced panel of 58,834 plants in 
16:502:37811:21:32:89:293:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this ten year period for these eight cities.   
16:503:37858:32:21:110:512:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To measure the spillovers of these industrial parks in their vicinity, we map plants 
16:504:37943:21:21:89:513:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:into industrial parks9, so that we are able to identify whether a plant is located inside or 
16:505:38036:21:21:89:512:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:outside  the  industrial  parks.  Figure  3  shows  that  industrial  parks  do  emerge  as 
16:506:38128:21:20:89:513:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:subcenters in a city, with much higher employment density (number of jobs per square 
16:507:38213:20:21:89:512:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:kilometer) both within parks and in their vicinity, compared to other places in the city. 
16:508:38303:21:21:89:512:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We also compute the average human capital level (years to schooling) by park by year. 
16:509:38389:21:16:89:512:246:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Figure 3 shows that the human capital level in industrial parks and the zones within 2

16:511:38536:8:14:89:508:222:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:9  This involves two processes: geocoding the boundaries of the 120 industrial parks in those eight cities’ GIS maps, 
16:512:38654:14:10:89:482:208:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:and geocoding plants in the ASIFs dataset in the GIS maps, so that these two can be merged. We use China’s 
16:513:38761:10:11:89:494:198:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:Streetmap GOOGLE online to do the geocoding work. We start with the official street addresses of an industrial 
16:514:38872:11:10:89:501:187:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:park and its land use drawings, and then use ArcGIS to precisely identify the location and geographic boundary of 
16:515:38986:10:10:89:490:177:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:an industrial park. We exploit the address information of each plant in the ASIFs dataset and geocode the exact 
16:516:39098:10:11:89:500:167:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:locations of these plants in GIS maps. We match ASIFs address information with the street maps using village (or 
16:517:39211:11:10:89:511:156:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f3:F:Juweihui) names and township (or Jiedao) names. The ASIFs dataset provides the village-(or Juweihui-) level codes 
16:518:39325:10:10:89:499:146:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:for each firm for the period of 2004-2007. To get the village-(or Juweihui-) level codes for firms for the period of 
16:519:39442:10:11:89:500:136:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:1998-2003, we pursued a number of ways. First, we track the firm’s village- (or juweihui-) level code for firms in 
16:520:39557:11:10:89:514:125:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:the ASIFs data set in the period of 1998-2002 by taking advantage of the information on village (or Juweihui) names. 
16:521:39674:10:10:89:491:115:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:Second, because some firms have no information on village (or Juweihui) names, we utilize the information on 
16:522:39783:10:11:89:508:105:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:township (or Jiedao) names to get their corresponding township- (or Jiedao-) level codes. Third, if some firms have 
16:523:39899:11:10:89:497:94:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:neither village (or Juweihui) names nor township (or Jiedao) names especially in 2003, we turn to Baidu, a local 
16:524:40012:10:10:89:504:84:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:google searching engine, to find their address information by using firms’ name information. Then we repeated the 
16:525:40126:10:0:89:492:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:first step or the second step to get their village-(or Juweihui-) level codes or township- (or Jiedao-) level codes. 
17:526:40246:0:32:89:474:758:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:km and 5 km from parks are significantly higher than that in the rest of the city.

17:528:40364:33:21:110:512:693:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We construct two key variables from this plant data set for our empirical analysis. 
17:529:40448:21:20:89:512:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The  first  variable  is  the  plant-level  productivity  measure  –  total  factor  productivity 
17:530:40546:20:21:89:513:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(TFP). Figure 3 shows that industrial parks and their vicinity do show  significantly 
17:531:40632:21:33:89:468:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:higher TFP. The average TFP within parks is even higher than that in CBD.10   
17:532:40710:33:20:110:512:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The  second  variable  is  the  park-specific  co-agglomeration  index.  Ellison  and 
17:533:40796:20:21:89:512:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Glaeser (1997) developed a methodology of industry pair EG co-agglomeration index, 
17:534:40879:21:21:89:512:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which measures the extent to which the two industries tend to co-locate in a certain 
17:535:40964:21:21:89:512:536:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:area.11  We run a simple regression to see how an industrial park’s co-agglomeration 
17:536:41049:21:20:89:512:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:index evolves over time as the park gets older. The polynomial regression generates the 
17:537:41137:20:21:89:513:495:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:curve presented in Figure D-2 in Appendix D. For the average industrial park, as more 
17:538:41223:21:21:89:513:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms enter the park, the industry synergy increases over time. This suggests that local 
17:539:41312:21:20:89:512:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:governments  use  their  “managed  hand”  to  recruit  those  firms  they  want,  and  this 
17:540:41404:20:21:89:512:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increases the degree of industrial synergy within a park. In the Technical Appendix A 
17:541:41490:21:33:89:396:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we provide the details of how we construct these two variables.

17:546:41819:21:20:89:497:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:transaction price and the number of units sold by residential complex by month. The 
17:547:41903:20:21:89:473:264:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sample size varies from 8,000 to 40,000 complex-month in the eight cities. The 
17:548:41982:21:21:89:506:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:physical attributes for each complex include the floor area ratio (F AR), greening space 
17:549:42071:21:33:89:481:222:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rate (GREEN), and ratio of parking space to the number house units (PARKING). 
17:550:42149:33:7:89:235:189:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:F:                                                             
17:551:42209:7:15:89:496:182:6:g_d0_f1:9:g_d0_f3:F:10 One possibility is that, if incumbent firms anticipate that a park will open up soon. In this case, they may take 
17:552:42325:15:11:89:504:167:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:actions to accumulate inputs and then their TFP could be artificially low in the period just before the park opens. If 
17:553:42444:11:10:89:511:156:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:this is true, we will overestimate parks’ effect in generating TFP spillovers. In Figure D-1 in Appendix D we plot the 
17:554:42563:10:10:89:493:146:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:TFP trends of incumbent firms which had existed at least two years before the introduction of an industrial park 
17:555:42676:10:7:89:349:136:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f1:F:nearby. We do not observe any TFP drop before the park establishment. 
17:556:42745:7:14:89:512:129:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:11  Our park-specific co-agglomeration index is the weighted average of the bilateral EG co-agglomeration indices 
17:557:42859:14:10:89:511:115:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:for the existing industry pairs in the park (using employment in each industry pair as the weight). Intuitively, if those 
17:558:42981:10:11:89:512:105:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:industry pairs that have higher EG co-agglomeration indices have larger employment shares in a park, this park will 
17:559:43097:11:10:89:511:94:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:have a higher park-specific co-agglomeration index, which means that the industries in the park enjoy a higher level 
17:560:43214:10:10:89:512:84:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:of synergy. We calculate the park-specific co-agglomeration index by year using the employment data of three-digit 
17:561:43329:10:0:89:303:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:level manufacturing industries in China during 1998-2007. 
18:562:43390:0:20:110:503:758:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Using data on the longitude and latitude of each residential complex, we geocode 
18:563:43471:20:21:89:506:738:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:all the residential complexes.    We calculate each complex’s locational attributes such 
18:564:43560:21:21:89:506:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as distance to the city center, distance to the closest industrial park, and which 2 km*2 
18:565:43650:21:20:89:504:696:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:km grid cell this complex is in. We also calculate for each grid cell, in each month the 
18:566:43739:20:21:89:485:676:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:number of units sold. As shown in Figure 3, there are peaks of both quantities and 
18:567:43822:21:21:89:481:655:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prices in the housing market in the vicinity of the new industrial parks.12  These 
18:568:43905:21:32:89:438:634:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:figures highlight that the new parks are creating new city sub-centers.

18:571:44016:33:21:110:512:536:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We construct a dataset for local private consumption goods based on dianping.com 
18:572:44097:21:20:89:512:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which  is  China’s  leading  local  retail  information  and  commentary  platform,  like 
18:573:44187:20:21:89:512:495:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:yelp.com  in  the  US.  The  website  covers  12  general  categories  and  nearly  200 
18:574:44275:21:21:89:512:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sub-categories.  The  three  biggest  categories  are  restaurants,  entertainment  facilities, 
18:575:44371:21:20:89:512:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and retail shops. For these three major categories, there are more than 990 thousand 
18:576:44456:20:21:89:512:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:retail establishments in these eight cities as of 2013. We know the establishment dates 
18:577:44544:21:21:89:512:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  those  shops.  We  geocode  them  in  the  GIS  maps  and  calculate  each  category’s 
18:578:44635:21:20:89:512:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:density in each grid cell. Figure 3 shows that all three types of consumption amenities 
18:579:44723:20:33:89:371:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have their density peaks in the vicinity of industrial parks.

18:581:44868:21:21:89:512:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this paper.  Unlike previous localized spillover studies, we have introduced a more 
18:582:44952:21:20:89:512:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:comprehensive approach that captures the impact of new parks on the productivity in 
18:583:45036:20:21:89:518:276:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  manufacturing  sector,  as  well  as  on  the  residential  sector  and  the  retail  sector.   
18:584:45137:21:21:89:513:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Such coverage is crucial because our ASIF dataset contains high-tech companies that 
18:585:45221:21:20:89:512:234:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:produce high-tech goods, such as Intel, Samsung, IBM, Lenovo, Siemens, etc., but it 
18:586:45305:20:21:89:512:214:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:does  not  contain  those  high-tech  companies  that  produce  Internet  services  such  as 
18:587:45398:21:21:89:513:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Baidu  and  Alibaba.    By  explicitly  studying  the  residential  and  retail  sectors,  our 
18:588:45493:21:32:89:304:172:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:empirical approach captures these impacts.

18:591:45598:7:14:89:504:88:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:12  There is a limited supply of residential land within industrial parks (most of the land is zoned as industrial land) 
18:592:45719:14:0:89:370:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:so many managers and workers buy or rent their apartments in nearby places.

19:597:45884:32:21:107:498:640:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In a city, industrial parks are not randomly assigned to locations.  In a large city 
19:598:45969:21:21:89:498:619:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:featuring durable capital and farming activity at the fringe, specific geographic areas 
19:599:46057:21:20:89:512:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:within the city will differ with respect to land use patterns, infrastructure, and industrial 
19:600:46151:20:21:89:496:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:agglomeration.    The cheapest and easiest land to create into a park is likely to be at 
19:601:46240:21:21:89:492:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the suburban fringe but such land may be disconnected from the rest of the city and 
19:602:46324:21:21:89:503:536:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:offer few synergistic effects with existing activity.    The mayor has a strong incentive 
19:603:46414:21:32:89:421:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to tradeoff these facts when he decides where to place a new park.     
19:604:46485:32:21:107:486:483:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Consider an extreme case in which the mayor has perfect foresight concerning 
19:605:46562:21:21:89:493:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:what will be the spillover effects from building a new park in each feasible location 
19:606:46648:21:20:89:478:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:within the city.    In this case, the site selection choice will reflect the anticipated 
19:607:46737:20:21:89:511:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:treatment effect.    Consider two different models of site locational choice.    In the first 
19:608:46831:21:21:89:488:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:case, the mayor embraces a complementarity model of economic growth where he 
19:609:46908:21:20:89:512:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:places the park in the strongest part of the city. In this case, a naïve econometrician will 
19:610:47001:20:21:89:498:359:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:over-state the true causal impact of a new park because the park has been place in an 
19:611:47087:21:21:89:500:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:area with excellent unobservable productive attributes.    In a second case, consider a 
19:612:47175:21:21:89:503:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mayor who engages in “spatial compensation” such that he places the park in the area 
19:613:47260:21:20:89:478:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with the weakest fundamentals.    He might pursue this strategy to reduce spatial 
19:614:47342:20:21:89:470:276:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:economic inequality. In this second case, the naïve OLS econometrician would 
19:615:47419:21:21:89:503:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:under-state the impact of parks because they have been systematically placed in areas 
19:616:47505:21:32:89:218:234:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with weak fundamentals.   
19:617:47531:32:21:110:509:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Chinese local leaders are powerful but capital constrained.    Land is one key input 
19:618:47616:21:21:89:482:181:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in production that they can access because of their ability to seize it from farmers 
19:619:47701:21:20:89:476:160:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:located at the suburban fringe.    Mayors recognize that industrial parks are land 
19:620:47784:20:21:89:506:140:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intensive.    When deciding on where to locate an industrial park, the land is the major 
19:621:47873:21:21:89:499:119:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:component in the mayor’s upfront out-of-pocket cost. To reduce relocation costs and 
19:622:47957:21:21:89:503:98:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the compensation paid to the original residents on the land parcel where the industrial 
19:623:48045:21:0:89:504:77:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:park will occupy, the local leader tends to choose a low-density place at the city edge, 
20:624:48137:0:20:89:494:758:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with a large share of farm land. In this way both the relocation cost (paid to original 
20:625:48225:20:21:89:503:738:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:residents) and the compensation cost (paid to villages who own the farm land) will be 
20:626:48311:21:21:89:496:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relatively low.    We create our instrumental variables based on this logic. One is the 
20:627:48399:21:20:89:496:696:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:developed land share in 1980 (DEV   ELPED_LAND%_1980), revealed by the remote 
20:628:48477:20:21:89:507:676:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sensing map of that year. The resolution of this remote sensing map is 1 km*1 km grid 
20:629:48563:21:21:89:502:655:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cells. From the map we can calculate the share of developed land in each cell, and we 
20:630:48649:21:20:89:505:634:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:aggregate this share to the zone level. The higher this share is, the less likely this zone 
20:631:48741:20:21:89:510:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:will be chosen by the local leader for an industrial park due to the high land acquisition 
20:632:48832:21:21:89:484:593:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and compensation costs. The second instrumental variable is historical population 
20:633:48914:21:21:89:512:572:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:density by zone in 1982 (China’s 3rd population census), POP_DENSITY_1982. Higher 
20:634:48996:21:20:89:475:551:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:historical population density also means higher compensation cost if this area is 
20:635:49078:20:21:89:468:531:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:converted to an industrial park. Unfortunately this historical population data is 
20:636:49160:21:21:89:484:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unavailable in Shenzhen and Xi’an, so the observations in these two cities will be 
20:637:49243:21:32:89:255:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dropped when this IV is included. 
20:638:49277:32:21:110:494:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Using the 1980 remote sensing maps, we create our third instrumental variable, 
20:639:49356:21:21:89:501:436:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:COMMUNIST_LAND%_1980, which measures the share of land that was designated 
20:640:49431:21:20:89:508:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to big public projects (such as dams, power plants, etc.) owned by China’s Communist 
20:641:49516:20:21:89:505:395:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Party (CCP) and CCP military uses in the old time before China’s economic reform in 
20:642:49600:21:21:89:506:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1980s. There were no land market and other factor markets at that time so the location 
20:643:49687:21:21:89:501:353:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decisions of such land uses were solely based on CCP’s central orders. Therefore this 
20:644:49773:21:20:89:497:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variable tracks the persistence of past CCP land use orders for major public projects. 
20:645:49860:20:21:89:510:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We expect that the higher this “communist land use” ratio, the less likely this zone will 
20:646:49950:21:21:89:472:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be converted to an industrial park later due to the high engineering cost of such 
20:647:50032:21:32:89:148:270:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:conversion. 
20:648:50044:32:21:110:467:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We use the topographic data to construct our fourth instrumental variable, 
20:649:50119:21:21:89:505:217:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:FLAT_LAND%, which measures the share of land with slope smaller than 15 degrees. 
20:650:50200:21:20:89:490:196:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Building industrial parks on relatively flat land will incur smaller engineering cost, 
20:651:50287:20:21:89:506:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:since many parks contain large-scale factory buildings, warehouses, and also high-rise 
20:652:50374:21:21:89:506:155:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:office buildings. The validity of the above four IVs relies on the assumption that those 
20:653:50463:21:21:89:504:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cost measures are only correlated with the probability of building an industrial park at 
20:654:50552:21:0:89:508:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a certain location, but are not correlated with the productivity potential at this location.

21:656:50730:20:21:89:496:738:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is built as a function of location attributes. In the first version, we are interested in if 
21:657:50823:21:21:89:487:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:zone k is the home to at least one park in 2006. We estimate Equation (6), whe   re Z

21:659:50995:20:21:89:505:676:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:location attributes of zone k, such as the distances to the CBD, the railway station, the 
21:660:51085:21:21:89:483:655:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:airport and the closest university, which are all predetermined locations long time

21:669:51656:21:21:89:487:472:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:established in our study period (year 1998-2006). We match each park with all the 
21:670:51738:21:20:89:511:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:zones in that city, so the observation here is a zone-park pair. We estimate a conditional 
21:671:51829:20:21:89:492:431:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:logic model to examine whether a newly-established park j matches with zone k. In

21:694:52697:20:21:89:488:146:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reports the regression results of the probit model Equation (6). Industrial parks are 
21:695:52783:21:21:89:486:125:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more likely to locate in the zones further away from CBD where farmland is more 
21:696:52863:21:21:89:502:104:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:available and the opportunity cost is also small. At the same time, industrial parks are 
21:697:52952:21:0:89:508:83:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more likely to locate close to the railway stations and universities. Such locations have 
22:698:53045:0:20:89:488:758:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:productivity advantages. Zones with larger share of developed land in 1980, larger 
22:699:53128:20:21:89:512:738:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:share of flat land, or higher population density in 1982, are less likely to have industrial 
22:700:53221:21:21:89:474:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parks in 2006. The “communist land use” share in 1980 has the right sign but is 
22:701:53301:21:20:89:473:696:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:statistically insignificant. The joint F test for the Z vector (which we will use as

22:703:53447:33:21:110:511:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the second version of park site selection model (columns (3) and (4) in Table 2),

22:705:53608:20:21:89:482:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variable is not statistically significant. This implies that, at least on average, local 
22:706:53697:21:21:89:508:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:leaders do not consider the incumbent firms’ synergy with the proposed industrial park 
22:707:53784:21:21:89:387:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:when choosing the location for that park. The three variables,

22:719:54456:21:21:89:513:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Beijing and we contrast it with the actual park locations within the city.    A darker 
22:720:54543:21:20:89:512:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:color means that the propensity score is higher. We  observe that parks do locate in 
22:721:54628:20:21:89:513:251:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:those places  with  higher scores.  We also  plot  each  zone’s  average TFP  against this

23:767:57171:16:11:89:501:116:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:Our paper provides the evidence that those nearby firms receive significant spillovers from parks. So their control 
23:768:57287:11:10:89:95:105:9:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f1:F:group is also treated and they underestimate parks’ effect. 14
23:769:57349:10:11:95:473:95:9:g_d0_f1:9:g_d0_f3:F: We use a new travel-distance algorithm written by John Voorheis, a PhD candidate in Economics at the

24:774:57772:21:33:89:348:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that zone’s centroid) and the park exists in that year.   
24:775:57830:33:20:110:512:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Table 3 presents five estimates of equation (9). Column (1) is estimated using OLS

24:779:58191:20:21:89:512:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:industrial parks have a  22.7% TFP premium, which is a sum of both selection and 
24:780:58272:21:21:89:513:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:treatment effects. We then only keep those plants with small zone identifiers, and 62% 
24:781:58359:21:21:89:512:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the plants are left. In column (3) we include plant fixed effects to explicitly model 
24:782:58448:21:20:89:513:539:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the firm selection effect. The TFP premium shrinks from 22.9% (column (2)) to 14.6% 
24:783:58532:20:21:89:512:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for  this  subsample  of  incumbent  plants.  By  including  plant  fixed  effects,  we  are 
24:784:58625:21:21:89:512:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:identifying  the  park  effect  based  on  the  subsample  of  incumbent  firms  that  were 
24:785:58717:21:20:89:512:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:located in the industrial park’s area before and after the park opened.    The fact that the 
24:786:58810:20:33:89:483:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:park’s fixed effect shrinks highlights that the ACs are recruiting productive firms. 
24:787:58895:33:21:110:512:424:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In columns (4) and (5) we report IV estimates where we instrument for whether a 
24:788:58975:21:20:89:513:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:zone has a park using our historical land use, historical population density, and land

24:790:59156:21:21:89:512:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We can observe that the TFP premium for within-park plants rises from 22.9% (based 
24:791:59239:21:21:89:513:341:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on the OLS results) to 27%-35%. The fact that our productivity estimates rise when we

24:793:59419:20:21:89:512:300:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:identifying low cost areas within the city to place the park) suggests that the mayors 
24:794:59506:21:21:89:512:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are either unaware of the differential benefits of placing a park in one area or another 
24:795:59595:21:20:89:512:258:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:within the city or they are intentionally seeking to place the parks in less productive 
24:796:59683:20:21:89:512:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parts of the city.    This is consistent with our finding in Table 2 that the zone-park 
24:797:59771:21:33:89:439:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:co-agglomeration index does not matter in the park site selection model.

25:805:60344:21:33:89:449:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a dynamic variable – it will shrink if a new park is located near the plant.   
25:806:60423:33:20:110:513:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We recognize that in a major city that local productivity could also be affected by

25:808:60591:21:21:89:512:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:other parks increase the city’s overall size and this would increase the city’s economic 
25:809:60680:21:20:89:513:622:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:growth. We use the distance to CBD (DISTANCE_CENTER) to control for the global

26:884:64007:32:21:89:486:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The observation in this regression is plant i in our firm data set. AGEi is the age of 
26:885:64094:21:21:89:504:244:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:plant i since its appearance in our firm data set. If it exits from our data set during our 
26:886:64186:21:21:89:511:223:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:study period, the dependent variable equals to 1, otherwise it equals to 0. There may be 
26:887:64275:21:20:89:482:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:several reasons for a plant’s exit: closure, relocation, or the size of its total output 
26:888:64364:20:21:89:510:182:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shrinks to far below the threshold of the ASIFs survey (500 million RMB).15  Since we 
26:889:64450:21:21:89:499:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:do not know the reasons for why individual firms exit the sample, we assume that all 
26:890:64535:21:20:89:484:140:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sample exits represents a firm’s death.    Table A2 in the Appendix C  reports the 
26:891:64618:20:25:89:509:120:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:regression results of this probit model. Column (1) is for all plants. Older plants have a

26:894:64883:14:0:89:376:74:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:since the 5 million RMB is not a ‘hard’ rule (see details in Brandt et al. (2012)) 
27:895:64969:0:20:89:490:758:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:higher probability to be closed. We find that plants closer to industrial parks have a 
27:896:65056:20:21:89:504:738:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lower probability to exit. This is another piece of evidence documenting the industrial 
27:897:65144:21:21:89:473:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parks’ production spillovers. Interestingly, those plants closer to the city center, 
27:898:65229:21:20:89:504:696:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:universities and railway station have a higher probability to be closed. One possibility 
27:899:65318:20:21:89:495:676:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is that those places are undergoing urban redevelopment and industrial land uses are 
27:900:65403:21:21:89:493:655:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:replaced by commercial and residential land uses, so many manufacturing firms are 
27:901:65485:21:32:89:218:634:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relocated to other places.

27:904:65551:33:21:107:512:536:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:A: We now test for industrial park TFP spillover heterogeneity by allowing the TFP 
27:905:65631:21:20:89:512:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spatial gradient to vary along four dimensions. The first dimension is based on the age 
27:906:65719:20:21:89:512:495:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the park. We have two cohorts – old parks established before 1996 and new ones 
27:907:65801:21:21:89:513:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:established in or after 1996.    If the Chinese leaders built the best parks first and if 
27:908:65891:21:20:89:512:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:diminishing returns have taken place for subsequent parks then we will observe that the 
27:909:65979:20:21:89:512:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:new parks have weaker spillovers than the old ones.    We find evidence of diminishing 
27:910:66066:21:21:89:512:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:returns, the spatial gradient of the old parks’ TPF spillovers is 2.3 times that of the new 
27:911:66158:21:20:89:512:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parks (-0.171 vs. -0.075).    Within each cohort, our panel data set of manufacturing 
27:912:66244:20:21:89:512:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:plants’ TFP allows us to examine as a park gets more mature, does its spillover effect 
27:913:66331:21:21:89:512:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:get larger. Panel B in Table 4 reports such heterogeneous spillovers. Within the old 
27:914:66416:21:21:89:512:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:park cohort, as a park matures over time, its TPF spillovers get stronger. For the new 
27:915:66503:21:20:89:512:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parks, those with an age between 11-15 years also have much stronger spillovers than 
27:916:66588:20:21:89:512:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:younger ones.    The regression has the same specification as column (3) in Panel A 
27:917:66672:21:33:89:441:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(OLS regression with district-time trend and industry-year fixed effects). 
27:918:66747:33:20:107:513:234:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The  second  heterogeneity  depends  on  the  park’s  own  economic  power.  We 
27:919:66827:20:21:89:513:214:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:construct five “park power” indicators (powerpark,m, m=1,2,3,4,5): (1) park’s distance to 
27:920:66917:21:21:89:512:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the CBD. Closer distance means stronger linkage with the city’s mean economic center 
27:921:67002:21:20:89:512:172:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:so more powerful; (2) park’s size. Larger parks are more powerful; (3) the share of 
27:922:67086:20:21:89:512:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:SOE  employment  in  the  park.  SOEs  are  less  productive  so  smaller  share  of  SOEs 
27:923:67177:21:21:89:512:131:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:means more powerful parks; (4) the average human capital level (years to schooling) in 
27:924:67264:21:21:89:513:110:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the park. Higher human capital means more powerful; (5) the co-agglomeration index 
27:925:67347:21:0:89:512:89:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for the industries residing in the park, higher synergy between those industries will lead 
28:926:67441:0:20:89:513:758:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to a more powerful park.  Our hypothesis is that more powerful parks (measured by 
28:927:67523:20:33:89:312:738:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:these five indices) generate larger spillovers.   
28:928:67573:33:21:107:512:705:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The third heterogeneity dimension measures  the extent to which this park “fits” 
28:929:67654:21:20:89:512:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with the local incumbent industries. Following Glaeser and Kerr (2009), Ellison et al. 
28:930:67741:20:21:89:512:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(2010)  and  Jofre-Monseny  et  al.  (2011),  We  construct  four  park-vicinity  “synergy 
28:931:67832:21:21:89:512:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:indices” (synergypark-vicinity,n, n=1,2,3,4) to measure the input-output linkages, the size of 
28:932:67927:21:20:89:512:622:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:labor market pooling and the knowledge spillover possibility between within-park and 
28:933:68012:20:21:89:513:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:outside-park firms.  In Appendix B, we report the details of how we construct these 
28:934:68096:21:21:89:512:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:four indices. Our hypothesis here is that if an incumbent firm in a park’s vicinity has 
28:935:68184:21:21:89:512:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:higher synergy indices with the park, it will enjoy a larger spillover effect from the 
28:936:68271:21:32:89:122:539:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:park.   
28:937:68279:32:21:107:512:507:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The fourth heterogeneity depends on plant attributes. We construct two variables to 
28:938:68363:21:21:89:512:486:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:measure a plant’s size and age. Size is measured in a plant’s employment. We group all 
28:939:68450:21:20:89:512:465:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:plants into three age categories based on their establishment year: before 1978 (before 
28:940:68538:20:21:89:513:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the economic reform), between 1979 and 1998 (earlier stage of the economic reform) 
28:941:68621:21:21:89:297:424:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:B:and after 1998 (later stage of the reform).  
28:942:68665:21:20:110:509:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We estimate Equation (13) to    (15) to explore the heterogeneity in the spatial decay 
28:943:68752:20:21:89:489:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rate of TFP spillovers with respect to the second to the fourth sets of heterogeneity

31:1102:74507:20:21:89:502:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in those plants will buy or rent residential units outside but near the park. That is why 
31:1103:74597:21:21:89:485:593:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in Figure 3 we see the closest zones to parks have the highest densities of housing 
31:1104:74681:21:33:89:421:572:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:transactions in the surrounding area, even higher than that in parks.   
31:1105:74753:33:20:110:512:539:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To empirically test whether there is a booming housing market around the park, we 
31:1106:74835:20:21:89:502:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:construct two dependent variables – the number of new home sales in the 2 km*2 km 
31:1107:74917:21:21:89:486:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:grid cell g by quarter (HOUSE_SALESgt), and the transaction price in a residential 
31:1108:75000:21:20:89:501:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:complex l by quarter (HOUSE_PRICElt). We use each complex’s exact street address 
31:1109:75081:20:21:89:497:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to calculate its shortest real travel distance to the closest park’s boundary. We expect 
31:1110:75170:21:21:89:501:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that, controlling for the real travel distance to the main center (CBD), those grid cells 
31:1111:75260:21:20:89:505:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:closer to a park will see more new home sales, and we should also observe that homes 
31:1112:75345:20:21:89:496:395:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:closer to the park sell for a price premium. We control for the global impact of other 
31:1113:75432:21:37:89:308:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parks in the city. See Equation (18) and (19).

31:1142:75871:21:21:89:445:186:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time all industrial parks had been built, therefore what we observe are the 
31:1143:75947:21:20:89:489:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consequences of industrial parks on nearby housing market, rather than the reverse

32:1147:76242:0:20:89:506:758:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for distance to the CBD, we observe a negative gradient with respect to the distance to 
32:1148:76330:20:21:89:508:738:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the closest park (as a subcenter). The size of this spatial decay rate is quite large, about

32:1150:76513:21:20:89:483:696:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:insignificant here. In the ZIP-IV regression (column (2)), this decay rate becomes 
32:1151:76596:20:21:89:508:676:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:smaller (-0.199)  , and it is statistically significant at 1% level, indicating there may be

32:1156:76967:33:21:110:503:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Column (3) tells us that residential units close to the parks further from the CBD, 
32:1157:77051:21:20:89:501:539:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the parks with higher human capital and higher co-agglomeration index are more

32:1164:77572:20:21:89:485:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nearby park. This housing price decay rate is about -0.101 (log-log) in column (4)

32:1166:77743:21:21:89:507:341:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The magnitude of this local gradient is about 55% of the global price gradient (-0.170)

33:1214:80645:21:20:89:512:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:receive higher land sale revenue by selling the residential and commercial land parcels 
33:1215:80733:20:21:89:512:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:near industrial parks if the parks’ consumption spillovers are large. Housing and retail 
33:1216:80822:21:21:89:512:150:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are non-tradable goods. Instead, city mayors have to set very low price for industrial 
33:1217:80909:21:20:89:512:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:land parcels in parks and also provide tax break in the initial years to attract mobile 
33:1218:80997:20:21:89:512:109:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms. Chinese city mayors have a term constraint (four years for one term. A mayor 
33:1219:81081:21:0:89:512:88:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:always  stay  in  position  for  one  to  two  terms).  From  the  mayor’s  perspective,  the 
34:1220:81178:0:20:89:512:758:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:revenue  from  residential  and  commercial  land  sales  can  be  realized  in  a  lump-sum 
34:1221:81271:20:21:89:512:738:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:form  in  the  short-run,  while  tax  revenue  from  productive  firms  can  only  come  in 
34:1222:81364:21:21:89:512:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:annually in the long-term, so they have the incentive to place parks in those places with 
34:1223:81454:21:34:89:236:696:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:higher consumption potential. 
34:1224:81484:34:34:89:177:662:14:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:B:6. Conclusion 
34:1225:81496:34:21:107:509:628:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:At the broadest level, our paper provides strong support for Marshallian theories of 
34:1226:81581:21:21:89:479:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:localized production and consumption co-agglomeration in a leading developing 
34:1227:81659:21:21:89:490:586:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:country. Using the opening of over 120 industrial parks across eight major Chinese 
34:1228:81742:21:20:89:495:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cities as a natural experiment, we quantify the spatial decay patterns in productivity, 
34:1229:81830:20:21:89:503:545:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firm survival, real estate construction, real estate pricing, and retail store openings for 
34:1230:81922:21:21:89:508:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:economic activity close to these new suburban centers of productivity. Consistent with 
34:1231:82009:21:20:89:488:503:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Marshall’s core hypotheses, we find that proximity to the parks reduce the costs of 
34:1232:82093:20:33:89:265:483:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:moving goods, people, and ideas.   
34:1233:82127:33:21:107:498:450:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Unlike other agglomeration studies, we have explicitly integrated our analysis of 
34:1234:82209:21:20:89:478:429:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the production and consumption side of the economy.   The new park creates a 
34:1235:82286:20:21:89:485:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spatially concentrated increase in local market potential as well paid workers seek 
34:1236:82370:21:21:89:503:388:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nearby housing and retail opportunities. We have provided new evidence on this local 
34:1237:82455:21:21:89:508:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:multiplier effect in a developing nation (Moretti 2010).  This local multiplier effect is 
34:1238:82545:21:32:89:516:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:larger for those industrial parks that attract more human capital and more private firms.   
34:1239:82637:32:21:107:504:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We have explicitly modeled the tradeoffs that the mayor faces in siting a new park 
34:1240:82720:21:21:89:465:293:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in a specific area within a city.    A forward looking mayor has an incentive to 
34:1241:82801:21:20:89:486:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:recognize that each area in a city may offer different benefits and impose different 
34:1242:82886:20:21:89:472:252:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:costs if a park is built there.    When we use cost shifter proxies as instrumental 
34:1243:82970:21:21:89:484:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variables, we estimate a larger TFP treatment effect from building a park. But, we 
34:1244:83053:21:21:89:497:210:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimate smaller IV estimates in our housing and retail regressions.    This collective 
34:1245:83141:21:20:89:464:189:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:set of facts suggests that mayors locate parks in those places featuring greater 
34:1246:83222:20:33:89:404:169:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consumption potential but lower producer efficiency potential.     
34:1247:83289:33:21:107:494:136:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:One explanation for these facts is due to the Chinese political system.    Chinese 
34:1248:83372:21:20:89:495:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mayors face term limits so that they serve for at most eight years. From the mayor’s 
34:1249:83457:20:0:89:505:95:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:perspective, the revenue from residential and commercial land sales can be realized in 
35:1250:83547:0:20:89:497:758:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a lump   -sum form in the short-run, while tax revenue from productive firms can only 
35:1251:83633:20:21:89:496:738:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:come in annually in the long-term, so they have the incentive to place parks in those 
35:1252:83719:21:33:89:293:717:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:places with higher consumption potential.

57:2082:118416:32:41:89:383:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Then we take the natural logs of equation (A1) and estimate:

57:2084:118528:37:15:89:512:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The dependent variable is real value added at the plant level, which is constructed by

57:2086:118702:16:15:89:512:414:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:material inputs. Labor input, L, is measured by the number of employees each year. 
57:2087:118785:15:16:89:512:399:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Capital  stock  is  measured  by  plant-level  real  book  value  of  fixed  assets.  The 
57:2088:118875:16:16:89:513:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:information on plants’ fixed investment is not available in the ASIFs dataset, which 
57:2089:118960:16:15:89:513:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reports the value of plants’ fixed capital stocks at original purchase price, and their

57:2091:119142:16:15:89:512:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:values are the sum of nominal values and are not comparable across time and firms. 
57:2092:119225:15:16:89:513:321:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We follow the procedure developed by Brandt et al (2012) and estimate plants’ real 
57:2093:119308:16:16:89:513:305:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:value of the capital stock in each year. εit is the error term, which has two components, 
57:2094:119398:16:31:89:440:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a white noise component, ηit, and a time-varying productivity shock, ωit. 
57:2095:119471:31:15:89:512:258:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:A  major  concern  in  estimating  equation  (A2)  is  that  the  correlation  between 
57:2096:119558:15:16:89:513:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unobservable productivity shocks, ωit, and the input factors chosen by the plant. This 
57:2097:119645:16:16:89:512:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:may produce inconsistent estimates under OLS. A second problem is the endogeneity 
57:2098:119727:16:15:89:512:211:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:arising  from  sample  selection.  Plants  exit  when  productivity  falls  below  a  certain 
57:2099:119821:15:16:89:513:196:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:threshold, and thus the surviving firms will have ωit from the selected sample, which 
57:2100:119907:16:15:89:512:180:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:has an effect on the inputs employed. To address both of these two problems, we rely 
57:2101:119992:15:16:89:512:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on Olley-Pakes (OP) estimator (Olley and Pakes 1996). We estimate the production 
57:2102:120073:16:16:89:512:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:function for  plants  in  each two-digit sectors separately  with  Olley-Pakes.  Thus, the 
57:2103:120164:16:37:89:342:133:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:measured TFP of plant i i n year t, tfpit, is defined as:

58:2106:120365:15:16:89:512:742:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Olley-Pakes are presented in Table A1. For comparison we also report OLS estimates 
58:2107:120448:16:15:89:512:726:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with  different  production  coefficients.  The  correlation  between  the  OP  and  OLS  is 
58:2108:120541:15:16:89:512:711:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quite high: 0.976 in value. Both of the labor and capital estimates are underestimated 
58:2109:120628:16:16:89:512:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with OLS, as expected when unobserved productivity is also possibly correlated with 
58:2110:120712:16:20:89:257:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:labor inputs and real capital stock.

60:2168:122164:16:16:89:512:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:incumbent  firms.  Following  Glaeser  and  Kerr  (2009),  Ellison  et  al.  (2010),  and 
60:2169:122254:16:15:89:512:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Jofre-Monseny  et  al.(2011),  our  first  step  is  to  construct  measures  of  the  extent  to 
60:2170:122352:15:16:89:512:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which two industries (1) have a strong input-and-output linkage; (2) share the same

60:2176:122879:31:16:89:513:555:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We first measure the advantage that a firm exploits from locating close to a park rife
