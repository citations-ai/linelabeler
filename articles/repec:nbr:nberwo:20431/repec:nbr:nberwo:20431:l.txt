2:37:2310:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:This study quantifies the efficiency of a real-world bargaining game with two-sided incomplete information.
2:38:2417:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:Myerson and Satterthwaite (1983) and Williams (1987) derived the theoretical efficient frontier for
2:39:2516:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:bilateral trade under two-sided uncertainty, but little is known about how well real-world bargaining
2:40:2617:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:performs relative to the frontier. The setting is wholesale used-auto auctions, an $80 billion industry
2:41:2720:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:where buyers and sellers participate in alternating-offer bargaining when the auction price fails to
2:42:2820:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:reach a secret reserve price. Using 270,000 auction/bargaining sequences, this study nonparametrically
2:43:2922:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:estimates bounds on the distributions of buyer and seller valuations and then estimates where bargaining
2:44:3026:14:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:outcomes lie relative to the efficient frontier. Findings indicate that the dynamic mechanism attains
2:45:3127:14:42:72:408:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:80-91% of the surplus which can be achieved on the efficient frontier.

3:53:3314:0:25:72:185:681:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:1    Introduction
3:54:3331:25:16:72:526:656:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:From haggling in an open-street market to negotiating a corporate takeover deal, alternating-offer bar-
3:55:3434:16:15:72:526:640:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:gaining between a buyer and seller is one of the oldest and most common forms of transaction.  When both
3:56:3538:15:16:72:525:625:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:B:parties have incomplete information, it is known that equilibrium outcomes are difficult to characterize.1
3:57:3644:16:15:72:526:609:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Myerson and Satterthwaite (1983) demonstrated that full efficiency is not possible, and theoretical effi-
3:58:3749:15:16:72:526:594:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:ciency bounds are derived in Myerson and Satterthwaite (1983) and Williams (1987), but it is unknown
3:59:3849:16:15:72:526:578:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:how well real-world bargaining performs relative to these bounds.  Williams (1987) emphasized that “little
3:60:3955:15:16:72:526:563:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:is known about whether or not these limits can be achieved with ‘realistic’ bargaining procedures.”  This
3:61:4060:16:16:72:526:547:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:paper is the first attempt to bring data to this question in order to quantify the efficiency of real-world
3:62:4167:16:15:72:526:531:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:bargaining with two-sided incomplete information.  I develop a framework to estimate distributions of
3:63:4268:15:16:72:526:516:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:private valuations on both sides of the market at wholesale used-auto auctions.  I then map these prim-
3:64:4371:16:15:72:526:500:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:itives into results from the theoretical mechanism design literature in order to measure the efficiency of
3:65:4477:15:16:72:526:485:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:bargaining relative to the first-best frontier and the information-constrained, second-best efficient frontier.
3:66:4588:16:15:86:525:469:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The  data  analyzed  in  this  paper  consist  of  several  hundred  thousand  sequences  of  back-and-forth
3:67:4696:15:16:72:526:454:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:bargaining offers between buyers and sellers at wholesale used-auto auctions, a large market where new
3:68:4798:16:15:72:526:438:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and used-car dealers buy vehicles from other dealers as well as from rental companies and banks.  This
3:69:4900:15:16:72:526:423:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:industry  passes  15  million  cars  annually  through  its  lanes,  selling  about  60%  of  the  vehicles,  worth  a
3:70:5018:16:15:72:525:407:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:total of$80 billion.  Throughout much of the industry, auction houses employ the following mechanism:
3:71:5119:15:16:72:526:392:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:a secret reserve price set by the seller followed by an ascending price auction,  which,  when the secret
3:72:5224:16:16:72:526:376:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:reserve price is not met, is followed by post-auction, alternating-offer bargaining mediated by the auction
3:73:5331:16:15:72:526:360:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:house.  This setting is ideal for studying bargaining under two-sided uncertainty because all players are
3:74:5436:15:16:72:526:345:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:experienced professionals and are likely to understand well the game being played.  Also,  because the
3:75:5538:16:15:72:526:329:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:bargaining takes place after an ascending auction and after the seller’s choice of a secret reserve price,
3:76:5644:15:16:72:526:314:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the efficiency of bargaining can be studied while imposing only minimal assumptions on the structure or
3:77:5747:16:15:72:228:298:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:equilibrium of the bargaining game.
3:78:5782:15:16:86:525:283:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:After  a  brief  introduction  to  the  industry,  Section  2  discusses  the  data  in  detail.   The  data  comes
3:79:5897:16:15:72:526:267:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:from several different auction houses from 2007 to 2010, containing detailed information on each car as
3:80:6000:15:16:72:526:252:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:well as the actions taken by sellers and buyers in each stage of the game.  The data is broken down into
3:81:6104:16:15:72:526:236:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:two main samples:  cars sold by used and new-car dealers (which I refer to as the dealers sample), and
3:82:6206:15:16:72:526:221:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:cars sold by large institutions, such as rental companies, banks, and fleet companies (which I refer to as
3:83:6312:16:15:72:526:205:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the fleet/lease sample).  Fleet/lease sellers tend to set reserve prices which are not as high above auction
3:84:6420:15:16:72:485:190:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:prices as are the reserve prices set by dealers, and hence fleet/lease cars are more likely to sell.
3:85:6520:16:15:86:525:174:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:I lay out a simple model in Section 3 which describes the three stages of the game at wholesale auto
3:86:6620:15:15:83:525:159:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:1Fudenberg  and  Tirole  (1991)  stated,  “The  theory  of  bargaining  under  incomplete  information  is  currently  more  a
3:87:6746:15:12:72:526:144:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:series of examples than a coherent set of results.  This is unfortunate because bargaining derives much of its interest from
3:88:6870:12:12:72:526:132:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:incomplete information.”  Fudenberg, Levine, and Tirole (1985) similarly commented “We fear that in this case [of two-sided
3:89:6993:12:13:72:526:120:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:incomplete information], few generalizations will be possible, and that even for convenient specifications of the functional
3:90:7117:13:0:72:462:107:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:form of the distribution of valuations, the problem of characterizing the equilibria will be quite difficult.”
4:91:7228:0:15:72:526:681:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:auctions.  The post-auction bargaining is modeled as a general alternating-offer bargaining game.  The
4:92:7330:15:16:72:526:666:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:auction  stage  is  modeled  as  an  ascending  auction  with  private  values  among  bidders,  where  bidders’
4:93:7442:16:15:72:526:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:values (as well as the seller’s value) are correlated through auction-level heterogeneity unobserved by the
4:94:7549:15:16:72:526:635:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:econometrician.  The seller’s secret reserve price is chosen optimally before the auction.  I prove three
4:95:7654:16:16:72:526:619:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:preliminary results which motivate an estimation strategy:  first, truth-telling is a dominant strategy for
4:96:7761:16:15:72:526:603:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:bidders in the auction; second, the seller’s secret reserve price strategy is monotone; and third, auction-
4:97:7868:15:16:72:526:588:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:level heterogeneity affects the outcomes of the game in a tractable manner.  These three properties allow
4:98:7973:16:15:72:526:572:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:for nonparametric identification of the distributions of buyer and seller types and the region of the type
4:99:8079:15:16:72:195:557:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:space in which trade occurs.
4:100:8107:16:15:86:525:541:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Sections 4 and 5 constitute the heart of the paper.  Section 4 presents the approach for estimating the
4:101:8210:15:16:72:526:526:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:distributions of buyer and seller valuations.  After controlling for observable covariates and auction house
4:102:8318:16:15:72:526:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:fees, I account for unobserved heterogeneity at the auction level, relying on a deconvolution argument due
4:103:8424:15:16:72:526:495:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to Kotlarski (1967) for identification.  I then estimate the distribution of buyer valuations using an order
4:104:8532:16:15:72:526:479:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:statistic inversion.  The approach for estimating the distribution of seller types is new.  It exploits bounds
4:105:8642:15:16:72:526:464:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:defined  by  revealed  preferences  arguments  taken  from  the  seller’s  response  to  the  auction  price.   The
4:106:8757:16:15:72:526:448:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:approach is similar in spirit to Haile and Tamer (2003), using bounds implied by very basic assumptions
4:107:8860:15:16:72:526:433:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:about  players’  rationality  to  learn  about  model  primitives  without  imposing  a  complete  model  of  the
4:108:8973:16:16:72:225:417:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:game or solving for an equilibrium.
4:109:9008:16:15:86:525:401:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Section 5 presents the methods for estimating the efficient frontier and other counterfactual mecha-
4:110:9108:15:16:72:526:386:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:nisms from mechanism design theory.  Throughout the paper, the terms “efficient” or “second-best” refer
4:111:9211:16:15:72:526:370:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to ex-ante incentive efficiency, taking informational asymmetries into account.  To refer to full efficiency,
4:112:9320:15:16:72:525:355:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:I use the terms “ex-post efficient” or “first-best.”2I also use the terms “surplus” and “gains from trade”
4:113:9426:16:15:72:526:339:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:interchangeably.  The efficient frontier (or Pareto frontier) delineates the best possible outcomes, in terms
4:114:9535:15:16:72:526:324:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of buyer and seller surplus, that could be achieved by any bilateral bargaining game in the presence of
4:115:9638:16:15:72:526:308:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:two-sided incomplete information.  Myerson and Satterthwaite (1983) and Williams (1987) demonstrated
4:116:9738:15:16:72:526:293:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:how this frontier depends on the distributions of buyer and seller valuations.  Therefore, the estimated
4:117:9842:16:15:72:526:277:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:distributions from Section 4 are crucial in solving for these mechanisms.  To solve for the Pareto frontier,
4:118:9950:15:16:72:526:262:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:I adopt an approach described in Williams (1987).  I also demonstrate that the direct-revelation mech-
4:119:10052:16:16:72:526:246:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:anism corresponding to the dynamic bargaining mechanism currently used at auto auctions is identified
4:120:10153:16:15:72:526:230:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:from information on whether trade occurred and from secret reserve and auction prices, relying on the
4:121:10254:15:16:72:384:215:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:property that the seller’s secret reserve price will be strictly monotonic.
4:122:10329:16:15:86:525:199:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:I then combine the estimated distributions of buyer and seller valuations and the allocation functions
4:123:10431:15:16:72:526:184:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:defining the current mechanism and counterfactual mechanisms, putting theoretical bargaining and real-
4:124:10533:16:15:72:526:168:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:world  bargaining  on  the  same  footing  in  order  to  quantify  bargaining  efficiency.   First,  I  examine  the
4:125:10650:15:16:72:526:153:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:efficiency loss due to incomplete information.  Ideally, a buyer and seller should trade whenever the buyer
4:126:10757:16:15:72:526:137:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:values a good more than the seller (first-best, ex-post efficient trade).  However, incomplete information
4:127:10863:15:15:83:525:122:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:2For a more detailed taxonomy of ex-ante, interim, and ex-post efficiency under incomplete information, see Holmstr ̈om
4:128:10982:15:0:72:148:107:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:and Myerson (1983).
5:129:11002:0:15:72:526:681:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:on  both  sides  gives  rise  to  a  bilateral  monopoly,  where  each  party  has  some  market  power.   Myerson
5:130:11116:15:16:72:526:666:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and Satterthwaite (1983) demonstrated that a deadweight loss occurs as each party trades off the dual
5:131:11217:16:15:72:526:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:incentives of increasing the probability of trade and extracting additional rent from the other party, akin
5:132:11324:15:16:72:526:635:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to the deadweight loss in a standard one-sided monopoly pricing model.  As a result, some trades fail to
5:133:11428:16:16:72:525:619:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:occur even when the buyer values the good more than the seller.3This deadweight loss is given by the
5:134:11528:16:15:71:525:603:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:gap between the the second-best mechanism derived in Myerson and Satterthwaite (1983) and first-best
5:135:11628:15:16:71:525:588:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:trade.  I discover that incomplete information need not be a huge problem in this market: The second-best
5:136:11733:16:15:71:519:572:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:mechanism achieves about 99% of first-best surplus and over 90% of the first-best probability of trade.
5:137:11836:15:16:86:525:557:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Second,  I  examine  the  efficiency  of  post-auction  bargaining  relative  to  the  information-constrained
5:138:11946:16:15:71:525:541:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:efficient frontier.  Unlike the mechanisms discussed in Myerson and Satterthwaite (1983) and Williams
5:139:12047:15:16:71:525:526:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:(1987), alternating-offer bargaining with two-sided uncertainty has no clear equilibrium predictions due
5:140:12151:16:15:71:525:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to signaling by both parties.  As a result,  it is unknown where alternating-offer bargaining lies within
5:141:12256:15:16:71:525:495:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the  efficient  frontier.   Any  gap  between  the  efficient  frontier  and  real-world  bargaining  represents  a
5:142:12371:16:15:71:525:479:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:deadweight loss which could theoretically be eliminated by committing to a static efficient mechanism
5:143:12472:15:16:71:525:464:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:along  the  frontier.   Therefore,  I  refer  to  this  as  the  deadweight  loss  due  to  mechanism  choice/limited
5:144:12589:16:15:71:525:448:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:commitment.4Findings indicate that the post-auction bargaining achieves 80–84% of the efficient level
5:145:12690:15:16:71:525:433:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of surplus in the dealers sample and 87–91% in fleet/lease sample.  The deadweight loss due to limited
5:146:12792:16:16:71:313:417:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:commitment is therefore roughly 9–20% in this market.
5:147:12845:16:15:86:525:401:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:In addition to Myerson and Satterthwaite (1983) and Williams (1987), theoretical papers examining

5:150:13151:15:16:71:525:355:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:(1983).   Ausubel  and  Deneckere  (1993)  and  Ausubel,  Cramton,  and  Deneckere  (2002)  demonstrated
5:151:13255:16:15:71:525:339:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:theoretically that when buyer and seller distributions have monotone hazard rates and when high weights
5:152:13358:15:16:71:525:324:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:are placed on the seller or buyer payoff, some equilibria of a dynamic, alternating-offer bargaining game
5:153:13463:16:15:71:525:308:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:can reach the efficient frontier.  Satterthwaite and Williams (1989) studied thekdouble auction game and
5:154:13567:15:16:71:525:293:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:found that generically only thek= 0 ork= 1 double auctions reach the efficient frontier.5Chatterjee
5:155:13666:16:15:71:525:277:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and  Samuelson  (1983)  demonstrated  that  in  the  symmetric  uniform  case  thek=  1/2  double  auction
5:156:13772:15:16:71:525:262:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:also reaches the efficient frontier.  To my knowledge, the current paper is the first to bring data to the
5:157:13878:16:16:71:368:246:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:framework of Myerson and Satterthwaite (1983) or Williams (1987).
5:158:13943:16:15:86:525:230:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:A  large  theoretical  literature  on  incomplete-information  strategic  bargaining  has  yielded  valuable
5:159:14051:15:15:71:525:215:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:B:insights through focusing on special cases rather than the full, two-sided incomplete information setting.6
5:160:14158:15:15:83:525:200:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:3Formally, Myerson and Satterthwaite (1983) demonstrated that when the supports of buyer and seller types overlap,
5:161:14272:15:12:72:526:185:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:there  does  not  exist  an  incentive-compatible,  individually  rational  mechanism  which  is  ex-post  efficient  and  which  also
5:162:14406:12:8:72:173:173:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:satisfies a balanced budget.
5:163:14434:8:10:83:508:165:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:4Cramton (1992) and Elyakime, Laffont, Loisel, and Vuong (1997) also referred to this as an issue of commitment.
5:164:14546:10:15:83:525:155:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:5Akdouble auction consists of both the buyer and seller simultaneously reporting sealed bids to an intermediary and,
5:165:14662:15:8:72:509:140:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:if the buyer’s bid exceeds the seller’s, trading at a price which is a convex combination of the two bids, with weightk.

6:170:15231:15:16:72:526:666:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:is  quite  small,  including  Sieg  (2000),  Ambrus,  Chaney,  and  Salitsky  (2011),  and  Silveira  (2012),  who
6:171:15345:16:15:72:526:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:focused on settings of one-sided incomplete-information bargaining, and Keniston (2011), who estimated

6:173:15550:16:16:72:526:619:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:One advantage of the current paper over previous structural papers is that, because the bargaining occurs
6:174:15655:16:15:72:526:603:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:after an auction and after the seller reports a secret reserve price,  the model’s primitives,  namely the
6:175:15761:15:16:72:526:588:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:distributions of buyer and seller valuations, can be identified from these pre-bargaining actions without
6:176:15866:16:15:72:526:572:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:relying on much structure or on a complete model of the bargaining game.  This is particularly useful
6:177:15967:15:16:72:526:557:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:given that, unlike auction settings or complete-information bargaining games, there is no canonical model

6:181:16305:16:16:72:526:462:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Each  year  approximately  40  million  used  cars  are  sold  in  the  United  States,  15  million  of  which  pass
6:182:16422:16:15:72:525:446:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:through a wholesale auction house.  About 60% of these cars sell, with an average price between$8,000
6:183:16523:15:16:72:525:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and$9,000, totaling to over$80 billion in revenue (NAAA 2009).  The industry consists of approximately
6:184:16625:16:15:72:526:415:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:320 auction houses scattered across the country.  The industry leaders, Manheim and Adesa, maintain
6:185:16724:15:16:72:526:400:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:about a 50% and 25% market share, respectively, and the remaining auction houses are referred to as
6:186:16823:16:15:72:526:384:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:independents.  Each auction house serves as a platform in a two-sided market, competing to attract both
6:187:16926:15:16:72:526:369:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:sellers  and  buyers.   Throughout  the  industry,  the  majority  of  auction  house  revenue  comes  from  fees
6:188:17039:16:17:72:526:353:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:paid by the buyer and seller when trade occurs.  Buyers attending wholesale auto auctions are new and

6:195:17848:12:12:72:526:262:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:of players signaling their valuations through the length of delay between offers, as in Admati and Perry (1987).  Neither
6:196:17969:12:13:72:526:250:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:of these models fits the type of bargaining observed at wholesale auto auctions.  See Binmore,  Osborne,  and Rubinstein

7:217:20159:15:16:72:526:526:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the car as well as the current bid are listed on a large monitor near the auctioneer.  The entire bidding
7:218:20264:16:15:72:230:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:process usually takes 30–90 seconds.
7:219:20300:15:16:86:525:495:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:If the auction price exceeds the secret reserve price,  the car is awarded to the high bidder.  If the
7:220:20402:16:15:72:526:479:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:auction  price  is  below  the  secret  reserve,  the  high  bidder  is  given  the  option  to  enter  into  bargaining
7:221:20522:15:16:72:526:464:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:with the seller.  If the high bidder opts to bargain, the auction house will contact the seller by phone,
7:222:20627:16:15:72:525:448:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:B:at which point the seller can accept the auction price, end the negotiations, or propose a counteroffer.12
7:223:20733:15:16:72:526:433:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:If the seller counters,  the auction house calls the buyer.  Bargaining continues until one party accepts
7:224:20838:16:16:72:525:417:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:or  terminates  negotiations.   The  typical  time  between  calls  is  2–3  hours.13Auction  house  employees
7:225:20948:16:15:72:526:401:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:contacting each party take care not to reveal the other party’s identity in order to prevent the buyer and
7:226:21054:15:15:72:466:386:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:B:seller from agreeing on a trade outside of the auction house, avoiding auction house fees.14
7:227:21146:15:15:83:525:371:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:9Note that the term “new” means the dealer is authorized to sell new cars from a manufacturer, but can also sell used
7:228:21263:15:12:72:526:356:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:cars.  On the other hand, “used” car dealers can only sell used cars.  Genesove (1993) discussed the differences of cars sold
7:229:21388:12:13:72:526:344:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:by new vs.  used-car dealers and found weak evidence of adverse selection among cars sold by used-car dealers.  Note also
7:230:21509:13:12:72:526:331:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:that the general public is not allowed at these auctions; Hammond and Morrill (2014) presented a model explaining this
7:231:21627:12:7:72:162:319:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:feature of auto auctions.
7:232:21652:7:16:79:525:312:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:10Most sellers report this secret reserve price to the auction house.  Some sellers choose not to report their reserve as they
7:233:21778:16:12:72:526:296:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:plan to either be present during the auction or to await a phone call from the auction house informing them of the auction
7:234:21900:12:7:72:226:284:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:price prior to deciding whether to accept.
7:235:21942:7:16:79:525:277:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:11According to conversations with participants and personal observations, few buyers appear to visit the auction house
7:236:22060:16:7:72:159:261:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:prior to the day of sale.
7:237:22085:7:15:79:525:254:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:12If  the  seller  a  present  during  the  auctioning  of  the  car,  the  seller  may  choose  to  accept  or  reject  the  auction  price
7:238:22225:15:12:72:526:239:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:immediately.  If the seller is not present but the auctioneer observes that the auction price and the reserve price are far
7:239:22348:12:13:72:526:227:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:enough apart that phone bargaining is very unlikely to succeed, the auctioneer may choose to immediately reject the auction
7:240:22471:13:7:72:175:214:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:price on behalf of the seller.
7:241:22501:7:15:79:525:207:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:13During the time a car is in the bargaining process, or if that bargaining has ended in no trade, interested buyers other
7:242:22623:15:13:72:526:192:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:than the high bidder may also contact the auction house and place offers on the car.  If the bargaining between the original
7:243:22747:13:12:72:526:179:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:high bidder and seller ends in disagreement, bargaining commences with the next interested buyer as long as his offer is
7:244:22867:12:12:72:526:167:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:higher than previous offers the seller has rejected.  This occurs for about three percent of the cars in the full dataset.  This
7:245:22995:12:13:72:526:155:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:separate form of dynamics is not accounted for in the model below the observations where this occurs are not included in
7:246:23115:13:7:72:118:142:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:the analysis.
7:247:23128:7:15:79:525:135:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:14The identity of a fleet/lease seller is revealed, and these sellers tend to try to build a positive reputation of not setting
7:248:23255:15:13:72:526:120:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:excessively high reserve prices.  Conversations with industry participants reveal that at some auction houses outside of the
7:249:23379:13:0:72:362:107:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:data sample studied in this paper, the identity of small sellers is also revealed.
8:250:23462:0:15:86:525:681:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:A seller accepting the auction price (or bargaining offers) below the reserve price may seem puzzling
8:251:23563:15:16:72:526:666:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:given that the seller could have accomplished an equivalent outcome by reporting a lower secret reserve
8:252:23666:16:15:72:526:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:price.  Industry participants explain this phenomenon as having several potential causes:  sellers system-
8:253:23772:15:16:72:526:635:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:ically  set  high  reserve  prices  due  to  overly  optimistic  beliefs  about  auction  prices  (Treece  2013)  or  in
8:254:23892:16:16:72:526:619:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:attempt to influence auctioneers to achieve higher prices (Lacetera, Larsen, Pope, and Sydnor 2014), or
8:255:23995:16:15:72:398:603:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:B:sellers are learning something about demand after observing the auction.15
8:256:24069:15:16:86:525:588:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:If the auction and/or bargaining does not result in trade the first time the vehicle is up for sale (or
8:257:24172:16:15:71:525:572:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:first “run”), the vehicle can either be taken back to the seller’s business location or, more often, remain
8:258:24279:15:16:71:525:557:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:at the auction house until the next available sales opportunity, usually several weeks later.16The seller
8:259:24384:16:15:71:525:541:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:can change her reserve price before the next run of the vehicle.  If trade takes place but the buyer feels he
8:260:24493:15:16:71:525:526:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:has been given a lemon, he may, under certain conditions, request arbitration, in which the auction house
8:261:24598:16:15:71:525:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:intervenes to either undo the sale or negotiate a lower sale price.  This occurs less than three percent of
8:262:24705:15:16:71:160:495:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the time in practice.
8:263:24726:16:15:86:525:479:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The  dataset  used  in  this  paper  is  new  to  the  literature.   The  data  come  from  six  auction  houses,
8:264:24839:15:16:71:525:464:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:each maintaining a large market share in the region in which it operates.  Between January 2007 and
8:265:24938:16:15:71:525:448:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:March 2010 these auction houses passed over 600,000 vehicles through their lanes.  The data from these
8:266:25040:15:16:71:525:433:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:auction houses includes detailed information on each car, including make, model, year, trim, and odometer
8:267:25145:16:16:71:525:417:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:reading; condition report (prepared by the auction house for fleet/lease vehicles); a blue book estimate
8:268:25249:16:15:71:525:401:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:provided by the auction house; the number of pictures displayed in the online pre-sale profile of the car;
8:269:25355:15:16:71:499:386:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:disclosure codes for different types of damage reported by the seller; and the identity of the seller.
8:270:25457:16:15:86:525:370:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:An observation in the dataset represents a run of the vehicle, that is, a distinct attempt to sell the
8:271:25559:15:16:71:525:355:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:vehicle  through  the  auction  or,  if  the  reserve  price  is  not  met,  through  post-auction  bargaining.   The
8:272:25676:16:15:71:525:339:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:total  number  of  runs  recorded  in  the  data  is  approximately  1,000,000,  so  on  average  a  vehicle  passes
8:273:25792:15:16:71:525:324:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:through the lanes 1.67 times.  I treat each run as an independent observation and do not model dynamics
8:274:25895:16:15:71:525:308:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:between  runs.   For  a  given  run,  the  data  records  the  date,  time,  auction  house  location,  and  auction
8:275:26011:15:16:71:525:293:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:lane, as well as the seller’s secret reserve price, the auction price, and, when bargaining occurs over the
8:276:26118:16:15:71:525:277:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:phone, the full sequence of buyer and seller actions (accept, quit, or counter), and the amounts of any
8:277:26221:15:16:71:157:262:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:offers/counteroffers.
8:278:26242:16:16:86:525:246:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:I drop observations with no recorded auction house blue book estimate;  cars less than one year or
8:279:26340:16:15:71:525:230:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:greater than 16 years old; cars with less than 100 miles or greater than 300,000 miles on the odometer;
8:280:26443:15:16:71:525:215:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:observations in which the auction sale timestamp is missing;  and observations for which the following
8:281:26545:16:15:71:525:199:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:variables lie outside their respective 0.01 and 0.99 quantiles:  auction price, reserve price, blue book price,
8:282:26656:15:16:71:525:184:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:or the gap between the reserve and auction price.  I drop observations for which fewer than ten vehicles
8:283:26760:16:14:71:525:168:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:were observed at a given make-model-year-trim-age combination or days in which fewer than 100 cars
8:284:26858:14:16:79:525:154:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:15For the estimation approach I adopt, knowing the precise data-generating process for reserve prices is unnecessary; it
8:285:26978:16:12:72:526:138:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:is only necessary that secret reserve prices be strictly increasing in the seller’s underlying true valuation, a result generated
8:286:27107:12:7:72:170:126:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:by the model in Section 3.
8:287:27133:7:16:79:525:119:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:16Genesove (1995) presented a search model to study the seller’s decision to reject the auction price and take the car back
8:288:27256:16:0:72:141:103:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:to her own car lot.

9:303:27963:15:16:72:526:408:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:runs of cars offered for sale by used-car dealers (which I will refer to as the dealers sample), and 136,453

9:305:28161:15:16:86:525:377:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Summary statistics are displayed in Table 1.  The probability of trade is 0.71 in the dealers sample
9:306:28261:16:15:72:526:361:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and  slightly  higher  in  the  fleet/lease  sample.   In  the  dealers  sample,  the  average  auction  price  is  over
9:307:28381:15:16:72:525:346:10:g_d0_f385R:10:g_d0_f3:B:$1,000 below the average reserve price and about$600 below the average blue book price.  Dealer cars are
9:308:28485:16:15:72:526:330:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:on average seven years old and have nearly 100,000 miles on the odometer.  Fleet/lease cars tend to be
9:309:28587:15:16:72:526:315:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:newer (three years old and 57,000 miles) and higher priced and have a smaller gap between the reserve
9:310:28688:16:15:72:526:299:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and auction prices.  Also, unlike dealer cars, in fleet/lease cars the reserve price does not exceed the blue
9:311:28797:15:16:72:526:284:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:book price on average.  All of these descriptive statistics are consistent with conversations with industry
9:312:28904:16:16:72:526:268:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:participants:  Dealer cars tend to be older cars with more aggressive reserve prices and be less likely to
9:313:29010:16:15:72:89:252:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:sell.

9:320:29736:12:13:72:526:158:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:rather than determining a reserve price ex-ante.  Missing auction prices can occur due to the descending/ascending practice
9:321:29859:13:12:72:526:145:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:of auctioneers:  auctioneers do not start the bidding at zero; they start the bidding high and then lower the price until a
9:322:29982:12:12:72:526:133:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:bidder indicates a willingness to pay, at which point the ascending auction begins.  If bidders are slow to participate, the
9:323:30106:12:12:72:526:121:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:auctioneer will cease to lower bids and postpone the sale of the vehicle until a later date, leaving no auction price recorded.

12:419:35061:0:15:86:525:681:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The  remaining  periods  are  labeled  with  even  numbers  for  seller  turns  and  odd  numbers  for  buyer
12:420:35170:15:16:72:526:666:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:turns.  Period 2 is the seller’s first turn in the post-auction bargaining game, and observations ending in
12:421:35277:16:15:72:526:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:this period represent cases in which the seller accepted the auction price or quit.  Period 3 is the buyer’s
12:422:35385:15:16:72:526:635:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:first turn in bargaining, and is reached only if the seller chose to counter in period 2.  Play continues back
12:423:35495:16:16:72:384:619:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and forth between the buyer and seller until one party accepts or quits.
12:424:35567:16:15:86:525:603:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Table 2 demonstrates that in 77% of the dealers sample the game ends at the auction, and in these
12:425:35664:15:16:72:526:588:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:cases the final price when trade happens (which occurs 81% of the time) is naturally the auction price.
12:426:35767:16:15:72:526:572:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Consider now the fifth period of the game.  Only 1.4% of the full sample reaches the this period,  but
12:427:35869:15:16:72:526:557:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:this still consists of nearly 2,000 observations.  In the fifth period, when trade does occur, it occurs at
12:428:35976:16:15:72:525:541:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:an average final price ($7,650) which is over$600 above the average auction price ($7,005), but still does
12:429:36082:15:16:71:525:526:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:not reach as high as the average reserve price ($8,523).  Overall, Table 2 suggests that observations which
12:430:36189:16:15:71:525:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:ended in later periods had somewhat higher reserve prices than those ending in earlier periods, consistent
12:431:36295:15:16:71:525:495:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:with Coasian dynamics (see Fudenberg and Tirole 1991).  Only 3 buyer-seller pairs endured ten periods of
12:432:36399:16:15:71:525:479:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the game, all of them coming to agreement in the end, at an average price over$1,000 above the average
12:433:36501:15:16:71:130:464:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:auction price.
12:434:36515:16:15:86:525:448:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Table 3 displays similar patterns for the fleet/lease sample.  82% of the sample ended the game at the
12:435:36617:15:16:71:525:433:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:auction.  Less than one percent ended in the fifth period, but this still consists of over 1,000 observations.
12:436:36727:16:16:71:525:417:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Buyer-seller pairs who traded in this round did so at an average of about$600 above the auction price.
12:437:36829:16:15:71:525:401:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Other than observations ending in the first period, observations with phone bargaining ending in later
12:438:36931:15:16:71:525:386:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:periods  had  higher  average  reserve  prices  than  those  ending  in  earlier  periods,  again  consistent  with
12:439:37046:16:15:71:525:370:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Coasian dynamics.  Three pairs remained for nine periods of the game, with only one of the three ending
12:440:37149:15:39:71:108:355:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in trade.
12:441:37158:39:25:71:525:316:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:3    Model of Post-Auction Bargaining with Secret Reserve Price
12:442:37221:25:15:71:525:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:This section presents a model of the auction-followed-by-bargaining mechanism used at wholesale auto
12:443:37321:15:16:71:525:276:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:auctions.  I first discuss the timing of the mechanism and set up some general assumptions.  I discuss each
12:444:37428:16:16:71:525:260:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:stage of the game, starting from the end with the post-auction bargaining stage.  I then present a model
12:445:37532:16:15:71:525:244:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of the ascending auction stage, demonstrating that truth-telling is a weakly dominant strategy, and the
12:446:37635:15:16:71:525:229:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:stage in which the seller chooses a secret reserve price, demonstrating that the seller’s strategy is strictly
12:447:37745:16:15:71:117:213:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:increasing.
12:448:37756:15:24:86:366:198:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The timing of the game at wholesale auto auctions is as follows:
12:449:37820:24:23:84:237:174:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:1.  Seller sets a secret reserve price.
12:450:37859:23:24:84:265:151:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:2.  N bidders bid in an ascending auction.
12:451:37901:24:17:84:458:127:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:3.  If the auction price exceeds the secret reserve price, the high bidder wins the item.
12:452:37990:17:0:72:488:110:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:auction price on behalf of the seller this choice coincides with what the seller would have done given the chance.
13:453:38106:0:15:84:525:681:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:4.  If the auction price does not exceed the secret reserve price, the high bidder is given the opportunity
13:454:38213:15:23:96:351:666:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:A:to walk away, or to enter into bargaining with the seller.19
13:455:38273:23:16:84:525:643:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:5.  If the high bidder chooses to enter bargaining, the auction price becomes the first bargaining offer,
13:456:38378:16:15:96:525:627:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:and the high bidder and seller enter an alternating-offer bargaining game, mediated by the auction
13:457:38476:15:22:96:123:612:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:house.
13:458:38482:22:22:86:305:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Throughout I maintain the following assumptions:
13:459:38530:22:22:72:139:568:10:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f12:C:Assumptions.
13:460:38542:22:16:71:526:546:10:g_d0_f13:10:g_d0_f13:C:(A1)  The ascending auction follows a button auction model withN≥2risk-neutral bidders participating.
13:461:38643:16:16:96:525:530:10:g_d0_f13:10:g_d0_f13:C:Fori= 1,...,N, each buyerihas a private valuation ̃Bi=W+Bi, withW∼FW,Bi∼FB, and
13:462:38722:16:22:96:213:514:10:g_d0_f13:10:g_d0_f13:C:withBiindependent ofW.
13:463:38744:22:16:71:525:492:10:g_d0_f13:10:g_d0_f13:C:(A2)  The  risk-neutral  seller  has  a  private  valuation ̃S=W+S,  whereS∼FS,  withSindependent  of
13:464:38845:16:23:96:181:476:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f13:C:WandBifor alli.
13:465:38860:23:15:71:525:453:10:g_d0_f13:10:g_d0_f13:C:(A3)  In bargaining players face a per-offer disutility,(cB,cS)>0, as well as discount factor,δ∈[0,1),
13:466:38962:15:22:96:454:438:10:g_d0_f13:10:g_d0_f13:C:where1−δrepresents the probability that bargaining will break down exogenously.
13:467:39041:22:16:86:525:416:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:I further assumeFB,FS, andFWhave corresponding atomless densitiesfB,fS, andfW, with supports
13:468:39133:16:15:72:487:400:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:[B,B], [S,S], and (−∞,∞).  Let realizations of these random variables be denotedb,s, andw.
13:469:39223:15:16:86:525:385:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The random variableWis observed by all buyers and the seller. In the estimation framework in Section
13:470:39323:16:15:72:525:369:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:4, I allowWto be unobservable to the econometrician but observed by all players, thus allowing for all
13:471:39425:15:16:72:525:354:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:players’ values to be correlated.20Conditional onW, buyers and sellers have independent private values
13:472:39527:16:15:72:526:338:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:(IPV). A motivation for this framework is that buyers—as well as dealer-type sellers—have valuations
13:473:39627:15:16:72:525:323:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:arising primarily from their local demand and inventory needs.21Also, seller valuations can depend on
13:474:39728:16:16:72:526:307:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the value at which the car was assessed as a trade-in, or, for a bank or leasing company, valuations can
13:475:39832:16:14:72:526:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:arise  from  the  size  of  the  defaulted  loan.22The  button  auction  model  is  a  natural  choice  given  that
13:476:39947:14:15:79:525:277:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:19At wholesale auto auctions, some large sellers are given the option to elect to eliminate step 4 above, implying that
13:477:40066:15:12:72:526:262:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:when the auction price does not meet the secret reserve price, the high bidder is not allowed to immediately walk away
13:478:40184:12:12:72:526:250:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:from bargaining but must wait until the seller responds to the auction price.  This situation is referred to as a “binding-if
13:479:40309:12:13:72:526:238:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:auction.”  It can be shown that in a binding-if auction, the seller’s secret reserve price strategy is only guaranteed to be
13:480:40433:13:12:72:526:225:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:weakly increasing, rather than strictly as in the non-binding-if case.  It can also be shown that bidders will not necessarily
13:481:40559:12:12:72:526:213:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:drop out of bidding at their valuations but may instead drop out at a price slightly below their valuation to account for
13:482:40680:12:13:72:526:201:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:the possibility of paying bargaining costs.  In the data, there is no way to know if a sale took place in a binding-if setting.
13:483:40807:13:7:72:242:188:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:I treat all auctions as non-binding-if auctions.
13:484:40855:7:10:79:525:181:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:20I also introduce characteristics observable toboththe econometrician and all players and I control for these observables.
13:485:40978:10:16:79:525:171:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:21Conversations with buyers, sellers, and auction house employees support this assumption:  buyers claim to decide upon
13:486:41097:16:12:72:526:155:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:their willingness to pay before bidding begins, often having a specific retail customer lined up for a particular car.  See Lang
13:487:41225:12:12:72:526:143:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:(2011).  Studying Korean auto auctions, Kim and Lee (2014) tested and failed to reject the IPV assumption, while Roberts
13:488:41345:12:8:72:379:131:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:(2013) found evidence of unobserved auction-level heterogeneity (analogous toW).
13:489:41425:8:15:79:525:123:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:22These  explanations  for  seller  values  are  due  to  conversations  with  industry  professionals.   Note  also  that  adverse
13:490:41556:15:12:72:526:108:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:selection  from  the  seller  possessing  more  knowledge  about  car  quality  than  the  buyer  is  likely  small  because  of  auction
13:491:41693:12:0:72:479:96:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:house information revelation requirements and because sellers are not previous owners/drivers of the vehicles.
14:492:41805:0:15:72:525:681:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:jump bidding is rare—as it is the auctioneer who calls out bids—and bid increments are small.23The
14:493:41903:15:16:72:526:666:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:assumption  of  symmetry  is  not  strong  in  this  setting  given  that  buyer  identities  are  unknown  to  the
14:494:42018:16:15:72:526:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:seller in bargaining and given the assumption of a private values button auction, implying that bidders’
14:495:42122:15:16:72:525:635:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:auction strategies will not depend on the identities of other participants.24The parameterδcaptures the
14:496:42225:16:16:72:526:619:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:feature that bargaining may end through an auction house employee failing to follow up on a bargaining
14:497:42327:16:15:72:320:603:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:B:sequence, occurring in 1–2% of bargaining interactions.25
14:498:42384:15:16:86:525:588:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:In what follows, I demonstrate three properties which prove useful for estimation: 1) a buyer’s auction
14:499:42487:16:15:72:526:572:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:strategy is to drop out at his value, as in a standard ascending auction, 2) the seller’s secret reserve price
14:500:42597:15:16:72:525:557:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:strategy,ρ(S), is strictly increasing in her typeS, and 3) auction-level heterogeneity shifts the outcomes
14:501:42703:16:15:72:525:541:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of the game in a tractable manner.  I begin by modeling the game conditional on a realization ofWand
14:502:42803:15:16:72:525:526:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:thus omitWfor notational simplicity and return to it in Section 3.4.  I ignore auction house fees in this
14:503:42908:16:32:72:474:510:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:B:theoretical analysis but account for their existence in the empirical analysis in Section 4.1.26
14:504:43004:32:22:72:203:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:3.1    Bargaining Stage
14:505:43027:22:15:72:526:456:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:This section describes a simple model of the dynamic, post-auction bargaining game.  The game begins
14:506:43127:15:16:72:525:441:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:with an offer by the buyer in periodt= 1. At wholesale auto auctions, this offer is the price at the auction.
14:507:43236:16:15:72:526:425:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:The seller then chooses between accepting (A), quitting (Q)—meaning terminating the negotiations—
14:508:43333:15:16:72:526:410:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:or making a counteroffer (C). Accepting ends the game, with trade taking place at the accepted price.
14:509:43434:16:16:72:526:394:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Quitting also ends the game, with no trade taking place.  After a counteroffer by the seller, play returns
14:510:43540:16:15:72:525:378:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to the buyer, who then chooses between accepting, quitting, and countering.  Thus, atteven it is the
14:511:43640:15:16:72:525:363:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:seller’s turn, and attodd it is the buyer’s turn.  Below, I refer to period “t” as being the seller’s turn and
14:512:43750:16:15:72:525:347:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:period “t+ 1” as being the buyer’s turn.  Where useful for clarification, I also include the superscripts
14:513:43855:15:16:72:441:332:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:“S” or “B” in notation to denote an action taken by the seller or buyer respectively.

14:521:44506:10:10:79:525:212:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:24See Coey, Larsen, and Sweeney (2014) for a formal treatment of the implications of asymmetries in ascending auctions.
14:522:44625:10:15:79:525:202:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:25This number is based on the percent of bargaining sequence records in which trade failed and the sequence of offers was
14:523:44746:15:13:72:526:187:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:incomplete, ending with an counteroffer.  A key reason for modeling discounting (either time discounting or, in this case, a
14:524:44870:13:12:72:526:174:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:probability of exogenous breakdown) lies in the results of Perry (1986), who showed in a game with two-sided uncertainty
14:525:44990:12:12:72:526:162:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:that if 1) there is no discounting and 2) bargaining costs take the form of an additive cost common to all buyers and an

16:639:48638:16:23:72:227:409:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:setup, the following property holds:
16:640:48674:23:16:72:526:386:10:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f13:C:Proposition 1.If in the bargaining game the seller never accepts offers below the auction price, truth-
16:641:48777:16:23:72:418:370:10:g_d0_f13:10:g_d0_f13:C:telling is weakly dominant for bidders in the auction stage.  That is,βi(bi) =bi.
16:642:48858:23:31:86:244:347:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:All proofs are found in Appendix A.
16:643:48893:31:16:86:525:316:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:This result implies that the winning bid will be the second order statistic from the distribution of
16:644:48993:16:15:71:525:300:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:buyer valuations, as in standard ascending or second price auctions.29Intuitively, the assumption that
16:645:49095:15:16:71:525:285:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the seller never accepts bargaining offers below the auction price ensures that buyers will not be tempted
16:646:49201:16:15:71:525:269:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to bid beyond their valuations in the ascending auction stage in hopes of bargaining to a lower price in the
16:647:49309:15:16:71:525:254:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:post-auction bargaining stage.  This is supported by the data:  the bargained price is not lower than the
16:648:49414:16:15:71:525:238:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:auction price (see Tables 2–3).  Moreover, bidders are not tempted to drop out before the bidding reaches
16:649:49519:15:16:71:525:223:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:their valuations because if the high bidder learns that the auction price did not meet the secret reserve,
16:650:49625:16:16:71:525:207:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:he can always opt out of bargaining, and I assume this opting out is costless.  And because the auction
16:651:49728:16:15:71:525:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:price is the second-highest valuation of the bidders, the seller cannot infer anything about the valuation
16:652:49834:15:16:71:525:176:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of the winner other than learning the point at which the buyer distribution is truncated, eliminating any
16:653:49939:16:15:71:525:160:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:incentive of buyers to shade bids downward to avoid revealing information to the seller.  The argument
16:654:50041:15:15:71:506:145:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:for identifying the distribution of buyer valuations, discussed in Section 4.4, relies on Proposition 1.
16:655:50145:15:15:79:525:130:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:29Huh and Park (2010) found the same result in a theoretical model of second price auctions with complete informa-
16:656:50259:15:12:72:526:115:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:tion (rather than incomplete information) post-auction bargaining:  bidders’ strategies were unaffected by the presence of
16:657:50381:12:0:72:113:103:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:bargaining.

17:659:50427:22:15:72:526:659:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:In this section, I discuss the seller’s choice of a secret reserve price, chosen before the beginning of the

17:697:51345:16:15:72:526:455:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:occurs.  I apply a monotone comparative statics result from Edlin and Shannon (1998), a special case of
17:698:51448:15:24:72:258:440:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Topkis’s Theorem, to obtain the following:
17:699:51490:24:23:72:467:416:10:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f13:C:Proposition 2.The seller’s optimal secret reserve price,ρ∗(s), is strictly increasing ins.
17:700:51580:23:16:86:525:393:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The intuition behind Proposition 2 is that the secret reserve price is never revealed and hence the
17:701:51679:16:15:72:526:377:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:seller  can  use  a  separating  strategy  without  perfectly  signaling  her  type.   To  prove  this  result,  I  first
17:702:51800:15:16:72:526:362:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:show that bargaining payoffs are weakly increasing in players’ types.  The strict monotonicity then relies
17:703:51906:16:15:72:526:346:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:on  bargaining  being  costly  to  buyers  (Assumption  A3),  such  that  some  buyers  will  choose  to  opt  out
17:704:52020:15:16:72:526:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of bargaining when informed that the auction price does not meet the secret reserve.  Without costly
17:705:52120:16:15:72:455:315:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:bargaining, Topkis’s Theorem can be used to show thatρ∗(s) will be weakly increasing.
17:706:52205:15:16:86:525:300:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The approach presented in Section 4.5 for identifying the distribution of seller valuations does not

17:713:52801:23:16:72:525:160:10:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f13:C:Proposition 3.Suppose, whenW= 0, the secret reserve isrand, for each periodtat which the game
17:714:52894:16:15:72:525:144:10:g_d0_f13:10:g_d0_f13:C:arrives,  the  offer  is  given  byPt=ptand  the  decision  to  accept,  quit,  or  counter  is  given  byDt=dt.
17:715:53006:15:16:72:525:129:10:g_d0_f13:10:g_d0_f7:C:Then  whenW=wthe  secret  reserve  will  ber+w,  the  periodtoffer  will  bept+w,  and  the  periodt
17:716:53106:16:0:72:152:113:10:g_d0_f13:10:g_d0_f13:C:decision will bedt.
18:717:53127:0:15:86:525:681:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Proposition 3 is similar to results used elsewhere in the empirical auctions literature (Haile,  Hong,
18:718:53229:15:16:72:526:666:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and Shum 2003) but is a generalization specific to this setting of a secret reserve price auction followed
18:719:53335:16:15:72:526:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:by bargaining.  The result makes it feasible to apply empirical approaches accounting for auction-level

21:891:63071:13:15:79:525:284:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:35The  above  framework  can  be  treated  as  a  semi-nonparametric  maximum  likelihood  setting,  letting  the  smoothing

21:894:63433:12:7:72:343:244:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:I find that choosingKlarger than 5 does not affect estimates noticeably.

21:896:63607:11:25:79:224:226:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:37Differentiating (5) yields the density:

22:905:64085:22:15:72:526:659:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:To identify the distribution of seller valuations,  I invoke an argument similar to the Haile and Tamer

22:907:64290:16:15:72:526:628:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in that observation-level bounds are not available.  Instead, I obtain bounds on the distribution of seller
22:908:64397:15:16:72:526:613:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:values relying on probability statements formed from many observations of sellers’ initial responses to
22:909:64500:16:15:72:148:597:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the auction price.
22:910:64518:15:16:86:525:582:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:As in Section 3, letDS2∈{A,Q,D}represent the seller’s choice to accept, quit, or counter in period

22:912:64722:16:15:72:525:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:cases where the auction price falls below the reserve price but there is immediate trade, I considerDS2to
22:913:64827:15:16:72:525:535:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:have a value of accept (A); and in cases where there is immediate disagreement, I considerDS2to have a
22:914:64929:16:15:72:525:519:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:value of quit (Q). Therefore, a realization ofDS2=dS2is available for each observation in the data.  As
22:915:65032:15:16:71:170:504:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:above, let ̃S≡S+W.

22:919:65184:23:16:71:525:423:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Both observations follow from revealed preference arguments.  Intuitively, if a seller accepts an auction

23:964:68717:15:15:79:525:297:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:41In this setting,  rearrangement is performed by simply sorting the vector of lower bounds (estimated on a uniformly
23:965:68834:15:12:72:526:282:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:spaced grid) and reassigning them to the original grid points, and similarly for the upper bounds.  Chernozhukov, Fernandez-
23:966:68958:12:13:72:526:270:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:Val,  and Galichon (2009) demonstrated that,  when estimating a monotone function,  a rearranged estimate is always an
23:967:69076:13:12:72:526:257:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:improvement, in terms of estimation error, over an original, non-monotonic estimate.  In practice, the approach is sensitive
23:968:69200:12:12:72:525:245:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:to extreme outliers, and so for this estimation I do not include the top and bottom 0.1% of observations ofV, where the
23:969:69319:12:12:72:526:233:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:kernel regression estimates are noisy.  In practice, the rearrangement has only little impact on the estimates, smoothing out
23:970:69444:12:9:72:238:221:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:small non-monotonic portions of the bounds.
23:971:69487:9:15:79:524:212:6:g_d0_f5:6:g_d0_f20:F:42Specifically, to fill in values of ̃L∗(·) and ̃U∗(·) so that these functions are onto, I do the following.  Let{vm}m=1,...,M
23:972:69613:15:10:72:525:197:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:represent the grid of points on which ̃L∗(·) is evaluated, which can lie beyond the range ofVin the data, in which case
23:973:69732:10:34:72:487:187:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F: ̃L∗(v) returns the empty set.  LetvL= arg minm: ̃L∗(vm)6=∅ ̃L∗(vm) andvL= arg maxm: ̃L∗(vm)6=∅ ̃L∗(vm).  Then
23:974:69842:34:0:209:241:153:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f23:F:FL ̃S(v)≡

23:981:69915:17:10:72:525:123:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:Finally, to remove unobserved heterogeneity,FLSis given byFLS(v)≡∫FL ̃S(v−w)fW(w)dw.  I follow the same steps for

23:983:70036:10:0:79:378:103:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:43As above, I use a Gaussian kernel with the asymptotically optimal bandwidth.
24:984:70116:0:15:72:525:681:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:follows:  for a car with vector of observablesx, the overall reserve price—less the auction house fee—will
24:985:70222:15:16:72:525:666:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:have densityfR+W, shifted by the quantityx′γ.  Similarly, for a car with observablesxand unobserved
24:986:70321:16:15:72:526:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:heterogeneityw, the overall density will befR, shifted by the quantityx′γ+w.  A similar interpretation
24:987:70423:15:16:72:183:635:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:follows for auction prices.
24:988:70450:16:16:86:525:619:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Figure 1 shows that the density after removing unobserved heterogeneity,fR(in red), is tighter than

24:990:70662:15:16:72:526:588:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:panel (a), suggesting that unobserved heterogeneity plays a bigger role in explaining price variation in
24:991:70766:16:15:72:526:572:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:reserve prices in dealer cars than in fleet/lease cars.  Panel (a) suggests that,  after accounting for fees
24:992:70874:15:16:72:526:557:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and observed and unobserved heterogeneity, the residual of sellers’ reserve prices varies principally over a
24:993:70982:16:15:72:525:541:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:range of about$4,000, ranging from about$0 to$4,000.  In this paper, this residual variation is attributed
24:994:71088:15:16:72:323:526:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to variation in the seller’s private valuation for the car,s.
24:995:71149:16:15:86:525:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Panels (c) and (d) demonstrate that the results are similar when comparing the density of the auction
24:996:71250:15:16:72:525:495:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:price with unobserved heterogeneity,fB(2)+W,  to the density without unobserved heterogeneity,fB(2),
24:997:71350:16:15:72:525:479:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in  the  dealers  (c)  and  fleet/lease  samples  (d).   In  each  panel  the  densityfB(2)is  centered  about  zero
24:998:71466:15:16:72:525:464:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:because the estimation procedure of 4.3 constrainsE[B(2)] = 0 as a normalization required to apply the
24:999:71568:16:15:72:282:448:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:identification argument due to Kotlarski (1967).

24:1003:71845:15:16:86:525:386:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:As a measure of the goodness of fit of this deconvolution procedure, I compare the correlation of the
24:1004:71946:16:15:72:526:370:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:reserve price and auction price (after adjusting for auction house fees) in the raw data to the correlation
24:1005:72053:15:16:72:525:355:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:between simulated draws for ̃Rand ̃B(2), generated by 10,000 draws from the estimated distributions for
24:1006:72156:16:15:72:525:339:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f3:B:FR,FB(2), andFW.  The correlations agree quite closely:  In the dealers sample, the raw vs.  simulated
24:1007:72258:15:16:72:526:324:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:correlation is 0.6146 vs.  0.6149, and in the fleet/lease sample the two quantities are 0.3817 vs.  0.3705.
24:1008:72365:16:15:72:526:308:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:As a further check of fit, note that the model assumes that auction-level heterogeneity—both observed
24:1009:72466:15:16:72:526:293:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and unobserved—is additively separable.  Therefore, the difference between the reserve and auction price
24:1010:72570:16:15:72:525:277:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in the raw data, after removing auction house fees but with heterogeneity included (Rh−B(2),h), should
24:1011:72672:15:16:72:526:262:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:be  equal  in  distribution  to  the  simulated  difference  between  the  reserve  price  and  auction  price  after
24:1012:72789:16:16:72:525:246:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:removing heterogeneity (R−B(2)).  Figure 3 displays the raw and simulated densities of this difference,
24:1013:72892:16:15:72:219:230:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:which agree well in both samples.

31:1364:83446:23:15:79:525:323:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:45A “direct-revelation” or “direct” mechanism in a bilateral trade setting is one in which players truthfully report their
31:1365:83568:15:13:72:526:308:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:valuations  to  a  broker  and  then  trade  and  transfers  occur  following  allocation  and  payment  rules  which  depend  on  the
31:1366:83702:13:7:72:244:295:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:distributions of types and the players’ reports.
31:1367:83750:7:15:79:525:288:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:46For  example,  the  buyer  and  seller  types  choosing  to  attend  the  auction  house  could  change  if  the  mechanism  were
31:1368:83881:15:13:72:526:273:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:more or less favorable for certain types.  Also, the distribution of seller types could change, because embedded in the seller
31:1369:84007:13:12:72:526:260:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:valuations is the option to attempt to sell the car at the auction house at a later date, and the payoff from doing so would
31:1370:84131:12:8:72:177:248:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:change with the mechanism.
31:1371:84157:8:15:79:525:240:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:47Note that I do not work with a direct mechanism in whichNbuyers and one seller simultaneously report types to a
31:1372:84270:15:12:71:525:225:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:mechanism designer, primarily because this mechanism would be starkly different from mechanisms applied in practice and
31:1373:84389:12:12:71:525:213:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:because I wish to focus on the efficiency of bilateral trade in particular.  I also do not consider a secret reserve price in these
31:1374:84520:12:8:71:173:201:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:counterfactual mechanisms.
31:1375:84546:8:15:79:525:193:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:48Setting the lower bound of the buyer’s support to be exactly the auction price is an approximation; the actual lower
31:1376:84664:15:12:71:525:178:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:bound  of  the  support  of  buyer  types,  from  the  seller’s  point  of  view,  may  be  slightly  higher  than  this  in  post-auction
31:1377:84802:12:13:71:525:166:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:bargaining given that the buyer’s choice to not opt out of bargaining contains some information about the buyer’s type.
31:1378:84921:13:7:71:525:153:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:See the proof of Proposition 2 in Appendix A.  This approximation error will be small as long as bargaining costs are small.

32:1404:86049:16:15:71:525:399:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:highest seller type—must receive a non-negative surplus in order to be willing to participate in the mech-
32:1405:86155:15:16:71:525:384:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:anism.  A sufficient condition for success of this solution method is thatφS(s) andφB(b)—traditionally

35:1588:94822:16:15:72:526:171:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:displayed.  In each panel, the second-best and trade-maximizing mechanisms are nearly indistinguishable
35:1589:94925:15:16:72:526:156:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:from one another on the frontier, and both lie very close to the seller-optimal point of the frontier (the
35:1590:95031:16:16:72:526:140:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:far-right point).  Figure 8 suggests that the frontier is approximately linear as it approaches the seller
35:1591:95137:16:15:72:526:124:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:optimal  mechanism  on  the  far  right  point  of  the  frontier.   However,  magnifying  the  plot  reveals  that
35:1592:95252:15:0:72:525:109:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the  frontier  is  actually  quite  concave  in  this  region  asη,  the  Pareto  weight,  moves  from  0.5  to  1.   In
36:1593:95374:0:15:72:526:681:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:both the dealers and fleet/lease samples, and under both the upper bound and lower bound of the seller
36:1594:95476:15:16:72:526:666:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:valuation distribution, the auction followed by alternating-offer bargaining results in a surplus level which
36:1595:95585:16:15:72:466:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:lies relatively close to the Pareto frontier, suggesting that the mechanism may be efficient.
36:1596:95678:15:16:86:525:635:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Any  gap  between  the  frontier  and  the  dynamic  mechanism  would  represent  a  deadweight  loss—
36:1597:95780:16:16:72:526:619:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:neither  bargaining  party  captures  this  lost  surplus.   I  refer  to  this  gap  as  the  deadweight  loss  due  to
36:1598:95900:16:15:72:526:603:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:limited commitment or mechanism choice, as this gap could theoretically be eliminated by committing
36:1599:95999:15:16:72:526:588:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to a static,  direct-revelation mechanism which lies on the Pareto frontier.  Figure 8 suggests that this
36:1600:96104:16:15:72:526:572:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:deadweight loss may not be large, but is still positive, and some points along the frontier would make
36:1601:96206:15:16:72:179:557:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:B:both parties better off.56
36:1602:96232:16:15:86:525:541:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:An additional source of deadweight loss is incomplete information.  Myerson and Satterthwaite (1983)
36:1603:96332:15:16:72:526:526:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:demonstrated that this deadweight loss is inevitable in bilateral bargaining with two-sided uncertainty.
36:1604:96436:16:15:72:526:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Intuitively,  both  parties  trade  off  the  conflicting  incentives  of  increasing  the  probability  of  trade  and
36:1605:96555:15:16:72:526:495:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:increasing the rent extracted from the other party, leading buyers to shade their offering price downward
36:1606:96660:16:15:72:526:479:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and sellers to shade their asking price upward, leading some trades to fail to be consummated even when
36:1607:96763:15:16:72:526:464:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the buyer values the good more than the seller.  This deadweight loss is depicted graphically in Figure
36:1608:96866:16:15:72:526:448:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:9 as the gap between the Pareto frontier and the first-best (infeasible) surplus line.  In both the dealers
36:1609:96973:15:16:72:526:433:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:sample and the fleet/lease sample, the gap is small.  In fact, much of the estimated Pareto frontier lies
36:1610:97078:16:16:72:526:417:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:within the pointwise 95% confidence band of the first-best line, indicating that incomplete information
36:1611:97181:16:15:72:372:401:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:per se is likely not the primary reason for inefficiency in this market.

36:1620:98097:15:16:71:144:262:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the lower bound.
36:1621:98113:16:16:86:525:246:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:I focus first on the estimation using the upper bound of seller valuations, panel A, of Table 4.  The
36:1622:98214:16:15:71:525:230:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:final  column  shows  that  the  expected  gain  from  trade  in  the  current  mechanism  is$4,276,  with$548
36:1623:98324:15:16:71:525:215:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:going  to  the  buyer,$3,509  going  to  the  seller,  and  the  remainder  going  to  the  auction  house  through
36:1624:98439:16:15:71:525:199:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:fees.  For buyers,$548 can be interpreted as an expected retail markup above the auction price (net of

36:1626:98658:15:12:72:526:169:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:outcomes than the theoretical bounds of Myerson and Satterthwaite (1983) and Williams (1987) would predict possible.
36:1627:98774:12:13:72:526:157:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:Bazerman,  Gibbons,  Thompson,  and  Valley  (1998)  reviewed  evidence  from  the  behavioral  and  experimental  literature
36:1628:98899:13:12:72:526:144:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:suggesting that more efficient outcomes can occur due to non-traditional utility functions (where one player’s utility nests
36:1629:99023:12:7:72:455:132:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:the other’s), limits on players’ abilities to mimic other types, and other features of bounded rationality.
36:1630:99130:7:16:79:525:125:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:57Because buyer and seller gains take into account fees paid to the auction house, the total expected gains from trade for

40:1790:103281:15:16:72:525:666:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:price), as a buyer’s valuation should be the amount he expects to make on the car.  For a seller,$3,509 is
40:1791:103387:16:15:72:526:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the expected gain from selling the car at the auction today as opposed to selling it through her next-best
40:1792:103493:15:16:72:526:635:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:option.  This next-best option includes the possibility of taking the car back to the seller’s own lot or
40:1793:103598:16:16:72:526:619:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:leaving it at the auction house to run again in several weeks.  Therefore,  the relatively high expected
40:1794:103702:16:15:72:526:603:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:gains from trade for the seller suggest that, in a complete-information world, sellers would be willing to
40:1795:103808:15:16:72:526:588:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:sell cars for much less.  The characteristic of the data leading to this result is the fact that even when
40:1796:103914:16:15:72:526:572:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the auction price falls far below expectation (based on auction-level characteristics) sellers still accept (or
40:1797:104025:15:16:72:458:557:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:not walk away from) the auction price with high probability, as discussed in Section 4.6.
40:1798:104114:16:15:86:525:541:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The estimated probability of trade in the dynamic mechanism is 0.705.  This measure comes from
40:1799:104208:15:16:72:525:526:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:integrating the dynamic allocation functionxD(ρ(S),B;B(2)) over all three of its arguments, as described
40:1800:104312:16:15:72:526:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in Section 5.2.  Comparing the estimated probability of trade to the raw probability of trade from Table
40:1801:104416:15:16:72:297:495:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:1 (0.710) serves as one indication of good model fit.
40:1802:104469:16:15:86:525:479:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Comparing each of the columns in panel A to each other yields several useful insights.  The first-best
40:1803:104571:15:16:72:525:464:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:surplus in panel A is$5,342, and the second-best surplus captures 99.7% of this surplus (as seen by the
40:1804:104674:16:15:72:526:448:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:percentage in square brackets in the second-best column), as was suggested by Figure 9.  Therefore, the
40:1805:104777:15:16:72:526:433:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:deadweight loss due to incomplete information is small.  The second-best probability of trade (0.831) is
40:1806:104881:16:16:72:443:417:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:B:also similarly close to the first-best (0.849), capturing 98% of the first-best volume.59
40:1807:104970:16:15:86:525:401:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The deadweight loss due to limited commitment can be evaluated by comparing the expected gains
40:1808:105064:15:16:72:526:386:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:from trade in final column of Table 4 to the second-best column.  In the used-car dealers sample, the dy-
40:1809:105169:16:15:72:526:370:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:namic mechanism achieves 80.3% of the second-best surplus (as seen in square brackets).  The probability
40:1810:105273:15:16:72:526:355:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of trade in the dynamic mechanism achieves 84.8% of the second-best level.  The gains to the buyer in
40:1811:105374:16:15:72:526:339:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the dynamic mechanism are 101.3% of the buyer gains under the second-best mechanism, while the seller
40:1812:105475:15:16:72:526:324:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:gains are only 73.4% of the second-best level.  However, the buyer-optimal mechanism would yield much
40:1813:105576:16:15:72:525:308:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:higher gains for the buyer (increasing from$548 to$3,631) and the seller-optimal mechanism would yield
40:1814:105678:15:16:72:341:293:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:improvements to the seller (increasing from$3,509 to$4,786).
40:1815:105738:16:15:86:525:277:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:For the most part,  the quantities in panel A are maximized by the appropriate mechanism,  which
40:1816:105834:15:16:71:525:262:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:serves as another check of the model.  Specifically, the expected gains from trade are maximized by the
40:1817:105937:16:16:71:525:246:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:first-best, followed by the second-best.  The buyer gains are maximized by the buyer-optimal mechanism
40:1818:106039:16:15:71:525:230:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and seller gains by the seller-optimal mechanism.  One exception to this good fit is the trade-maximizing
40:1819:106144:15:16:71:525:215:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:mechanism, which attains a level of probability of trade (0.868) which exceeds the first-best (0.849).  This
40:1820:106252:16:15:71:525:199:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:feature is due to the fact that the virtual valuations (φBandφSfrom Section 5.1) are not necessarily
40:1821:106352:15:16:71:525:184:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:increasing.  I address this in Appendix B.4 by imposing monotonicity of virtual valuations and find that
40:1822:106456:16:15:71:525:168:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:this corrects the ranking of first-best vs.  the trade-maximizing mechanism; however, this correction also

40:1824:106647:16:15:86:525:137:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Panel  B  of  Table  4,  which  uses  the  lower  bound  of  seller  valuations,  demonstrates  similar  results
40:1825:106759:15:15:79:525:122:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:59Recall that the first-best would have trade occur whenever the buyer’s value is higher than the seller’s.  Therefore, the
40:1826:106882:15:0:72:491:107:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:first-best probability of trade will not be one, but will depend on the distributions of buyer and seller valuations.
41:1827:107001:0:15:72:526:681:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to panel A, with several interesting differences.  First,  under the lower bound of seller valuations,  the
41:1828:107108:15:16:72:526:666:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:probability  of  trade  in  the  dynamic  mechanism  exceeds  slightly  the  probability  of  trade  in  the  trade-
41:1829:107224:16:15:72:526:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:maximizing mechanism.  Second, the trade-maximizing mechanism no longer appears to outperform the
41:1830:107321:15:16:72:526:635:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:first-best.  Finally, while the second-best captures 99.2% of the first-best surplus, it captures only 92.8%
41:1831:107429:16:16:72:526:619:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of  the  first-best  trade  volume,  highlighting  the  fact  that  trades  which  are  captured  by  the  first-best
41:1832:107546:16:15:72:526:603:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:mechanism but missed by the second-best (due to the incomplete information explored in Myerson and
41:1833:107644:15:16:72:526:588:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Satterthwaite 1983) tend to be relatively low-surplus trades, i.e.  cases where the buyer only values the
41:1834:107749:16:15:72:214:572:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:car slightly more than the seller.
41:1835:107783:15:16:86:525:557:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The qualitative findings from the dealers sample are similar in the fleet/lease sample (Table 5).  The
41:1836:107885:16:15:72:526:541:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:second-best mechanism achieves 99.5% or 98.8% of the first-best gains from trade, depending on whether
41:1837:107987:15:16:72:526:526:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the upper (panel A) or lower (panel B) bound of seller valuations is used.  The second-best probability
41:1838:108090:16:15:72:526:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of trade attains 96.4% or 90.8% of the first-best volume.  Comparing Table 5 to Table 4 suggests that
41:1839:108191:15:16:72:526:495:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the dynamic bargaining mechanism may be slightly more efficient in the fleet/lease sellers sample than
41:1840:108293:16:15:72:526:479:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in the dealers sample—consistent with conventional wisdom in the industry—capturing 90.9% (panel A)
41:1841:108392:15:16:72:526:464:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:or 86.5% (panel B) of second-best surplus in the fleet/lease sample.  The levels of gains as well as the
41:1842:108496:16:15:72:526:448:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:probability of trade are also higher in the fleet/lease sample than in the dealers sample.  Under the upper
41:1843:108603:15:16:72:526:433:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:bound of seller valuations, panel A shows that the expected gains from trade in the dynamic mechanism
41:1844:108704:16:16:72:525:417:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:are$5,201, with buyers capturing$912, sellers capturing$4,060, and the remainder going toward auction
41:1845:108805:16:15:72:118:401:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:house fees.
41:1846:108816:15:16:86:525:386:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The expected gains from trade in Figures 8-9 and Tables 4–5 do not take into account any surplus
41:1847:108912:16:15:72:526:370:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:lost due to bargaining costs, and thus can be thought of as an upper bound on surplus under dynamic
41:1848:109011:15:16:72:526:355:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:bargaining.  Appendix B.3 provides an approach for estimating a lower bound on surplus which takes
41:1849:109109:16:15:72:526:339:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:into account bargaining costs.  I find that the surplus lost due to costs in dynamic bargaining is small,
41:1850:109214:15:16:72:320:324:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:less than$25 for buyers and less than$50-100 for sellers.
41:1851:109271:16:15:86:525:308:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Further checks of model robustness as well as analyses of additional mechanisms are contained in the
41:1852:109371:15:16:72:526:293:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:appendices.  Appendix B.5 presents results analogous to those in Tables 4–5 under alternative sample
41:1853:109471:16:15:72:526:277:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:restrictions.  Appendix B.6 displays welfare results under alternative assumptions on the mean number
41:1854:109572:15:16:72:525:262:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of bidders,λ, and demonstrates that alternative assumptions forλdo not alter the paper’s conclusions.
41:1855:109673:16:16:72:526:246:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Appendix B.7.1 analyzes the efficiency of a seller bargaining with a random bidder rather than the high
41:1856:109776:16:15:72:526:230:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:bidder. This mechanism changes not only what dynamic bargaining can achieve, but also shifts the Pareto
41:1857:109879:15:16:72:526:215:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and first-best frontiers as well. I find that bargaining with a random bidder is less efficient than bargaining
41:1858:109990:16:15:72:526:199:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:with the high bidder, but still achieves 70–88.5% of the second-best gains from trade.  Appendix B.7.2
41:1859:110092:15:16:72:526:184:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:contains results from an auction in which all players commit not to bargain, and in which the seller is only
41:1860:110200:16:15:72:526:168:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:allowed to accept or reject the auction price.  I find this mechanism is quite efficient.  Finally, Appendix
41:1861:110308:15:0:72:482:153:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:B.7.3 analyzes the mechanism which would maximize revenue for a monopolist auction house.

43:1919:112303:25:16:72:526:656:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:This paper examined the efficiency of bargaining from a real-world setting with two-sided incomplete in-
43:1920:112407:16:15:72:526:640:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:formation.  I developed a model and strategy for nonparametrically identifying and estimating the distri-

43:1923:112734:15:16:72:526:594:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:mechanism framework which traces out the efficient frontier derived in Myerson and Satterthwaite (1983)

43:1925:112937:15:16:72:526:563:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the first-best trade line and the second-best frontier—is small in the wholesale used-car market.  I also
43:1926:113042:16:16:72:526:547:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:found that the deadweight loss due to mechanism choice/limited commitment is roughly 9–20% of the
43:1927:113139:16:15:72:526:531:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:second-best  surplus.   This  result  is  consistent  with  the  hypothesis  of  Wilson  (1986)  and  Ausubel  and
43:1928:113253:15:16:72:526:516:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Deneckere (1993) who suggested that it may be that “[dynamic bargaining mechanisms] survive because
43:1929:113352:16:15:72:410:500:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:they employ trading rules that are efficient for a wide class of environments.”
43:1930:113431:15:16:86:525:485:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The findings of this paper shed some light on the question of why bargaining may be used after an
43:1931:113528:16:15:72:526:469:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:auction, as opposed to sales mechanisms which are more standard in the theoretical literature, such as an
43:1932:113633:15:16:72:526:454:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:auction with no reserve price or an auction with a public reserve price.  In this industry, it is the auction
43:1933:113742:16:15:72:526:438:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:house,  rather  than  the  seller,  who  chooses  the  mechanism.   An  auction  house  is  a  platform  in  a  two-
43:1934:113858:15:16:72:526:423:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:sided market, required to attract both buyers and sellers, each with private information about his or her
43:1935:113963:16:15:72:526:407:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:valuation for the good.  A no-reserve auction could drive some high-value sellers out of the market.  And
43:1936:114068:15:16:72:526:392:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:while a public reserve auction is optimal for the seller, alternative mechanisms, including post-auction
43:1937:114172:16:16:72:526:376:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:bargaining, may be preferred for the buyer or for the auction house, and may allow the market to achieve
43:1938:114276:16:15:72:526:360:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:a more efficient allocation.  Alternating-offer bargaining in particular is a natural mechanism which is
43:1939:114380:15:16:72:526:345:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:easy for players to understand and for the auction house to implement, and which does not require the
43:1940:114481:16:15:72:526:329:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:same level of commitment as static bargaining mechanisms, which, while more efficient, require players
43:1941:114583:15:16:72:526:314:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to sometimes walk away from negotiations even when it is discovered ex-post that gains from trade exist.
43:1942:114687:16:15:86:525:298:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The nature of the wholesale used-car industry as a network of competing platforms also likely affects
43:1943:114788:15:16:72:526:283:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:auction houses’ choice of mechanism—both the choice of whether or not to allow post-auction bargaining
43:1944:114890:16:15:72:526:267:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:as well as the choice of fee structure.  Studying the role of two-sided uncertainty and competition among
43:1945:114995:15:16:72:526:252:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:auction houses in determining auction houses’ choice of mechanism would be a valuable avenue for future

48:2125:125961:15:0:72:525:97:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:has  the  option  to  immediately  walk  away  without  entering  bargaining,  the  payoffM(β,bi)  cannot  be
49:2126:126072:0:15:72:525:681:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:negative.  To see that truth-telling is a dominant strategy, suppose first that bidderidrops out at some
49:2127:126176:15:22:72:104:666:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f3:B:βi< bi.
49:2128:126183:22:15:84:525:644:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:1.  Ifbi≤β, thenβi< bi≤β, so bidderiis not the high bidder, and would not have been even if he
49:2129:126277:15:23:96:166:629:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:had bidβi=bi.
49:2130:126290:23:23:84:252:606:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:2.  Ifbi> β, then the following is true:
49:2131:126330:23:18:101:500:583:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:(a)  Ifβ < βi< bi, then bidderiis the high bidder and gets an expected payoff ofM(β,bi).
49:2132:126418:18:16:100:525:565:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:(b)  Ifβi< β < bi, then bidderiloses, butiwould have been the high bidder if he had bidbi, and
49:2133:126512:16:22:118:275:549:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:would have again receivedM(β,bi).
49:2134:126545:22:16:71:525:527:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Thus, dropping out at a price less thanbiwill never raise bidderi’s payoff, and in some cases may decrease
49:2135:126651:16:15:71:80:511:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:it.
49:2136:126654:15:22:86:320:496:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f15:A:Now, suppose that bidderidrops out at someβi> bi
49:2137:126702:22:15:84:525:474:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:1.  Ifβ≤bi, thenβ≤bi< βi, then bidderiis the high bidder and gets payoffM(β,bi), but would
49:2138:126792:15:16:96:525:459:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:have received this same payoff dropping out atbi.  Also, as noted above, because it is the auctioneer,
49:2139:126894:16:15:96:525:443:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:rather than the bidders, who calls out bids, a player cannot actually outbid himself in an attempt
49:2140:126992:15:23:96:317:428:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:to win the object while avoiding costly bargaining.
49:2141:127043:23:22:84:252:405:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:2.  Ifβ > bi, then the following is true:
49:2142:127084:22:16:101:525:383:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:(a)  Ifbi< βi< β, then bidderiloses, and would not have been the high bidder even if he had
49:2143:127175:16:19:118:168:367:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:bidβi=bi.
49:2144:127184:19:15:100:525:348:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:(b)  Ifbi< β < βi,  then bidderiis the high bidder,  but would not choose to enter bargaining
49:2145:127277:15:16:118:525:333:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:because the condition that the seller never accepts offers below the auction price rules out the
49:2146:127373:16:45:118:421:317:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:possibility that biddericould receive a positive payoff by bargaining.

55:2599:139968:22:16:72:526:166:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:This section describes a simple approach to account for bargaining costs incurred during the alternating-
55:2600:140073:16:15:72:525:150:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:offer bargaining game.  The parameterδ, the probability that the game does not end exogenously, can be
55:2601:140175:15:16:72:526:135:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:estimated in the data as the empirical probability that a bargaining sequence is not incomplete (where
55:2602:140277:16:15:72:526:119:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:incomplete means the sequence is recorded as having ended with a counteroffer which was not responded
55:2603:140378:15:0:72:526:104:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to).  In practice this probability can vary from period to period.  Table 6, panel A, displays these empirical
56:2604:140490:0:15:72:525:681:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:probabilities for periods one through six.  In estimation below I use both an upper bound onδ,δ≡1,
56:2605:140588:15:16:71:458:666:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and a lower bound,δ, given by the smallest of the period-levelδestimates from Table 6.
56:2606:140674:16:15:86:525:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Bounds on the parameterscBandcSare given by cases in which a player chooses to make a coun-

56:2615:141090:26:15:72:525:464:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Thus, an upper bound oncSis given by the minimum gap between period 2 and period 1 offers and an

59:2814:146901:21:16:86:525:531:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Figure  10  displays  the  resulting  densities  from  this  rearrangement.   The  first  row,  panels  (a)  and
59:2815:147013:16:15:72:526:515:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:(b), displays the density of seller valuations using the seller distribution upper bound in the dealers and
59:2816:147120:15:16:72:526:500:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:fleet/lease samples.  Panels (c) and (d) use the seller distribution lower bound.  Panels (e) and (f) display
59:2817:147229:16:15:72:526:484:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the density of buyer valuations.  Several densities, including those in panels (a), (e), and (f) are mostly
59:2818:147336:15:16:72:526:469:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:unaffected  by  the  monotonization  of  virtual  valuations.   In  the  remaining  panels,  the  monotonization
59:2819:147448:16:15:72:322:453:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:shifts the mass in particular regions of the seller support.
59:2820:147508:15:16:86:525:438:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Table  7  compares  the  original  welfare  estimates  to  those  implied  under  the  monotonized  virtual
59:2821:147615:16:15:72:526:422:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:valuations.   In  panel  A1,  the  original  estimates  suggest  that  the  trade-maximizing  mechanism  has  a
59:2822:147726:15:16:72:526:407:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:higher probability of trade (0.868) than the first-best (0.849).  After monotonization, the two mechanism
59:2823:147831:16:16:72:526:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:are ranked correctly, with the trade-maximizing mechanism achieving trade with probability 0.897 and
59:2824:147931:16:15:72:526:375:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the first-best with probability 0.937.  However,  the monotonized density does not fit the data as well,
59:2825:148035:15:16:72:526:360:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:as can be seen by the predicted probability of trade in the dynamic mechanism, 0.845, which lies much
59:2826:148136:16:15:72:526:344:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:farther from the observed probability of trade in the dealers sample, 0.710 (see Table 1).  The results are
59:2827:148243:15:16:72:526:329:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:similar in the fleet/lease sample, where the rearranging corrects the ranking of the trade-maximizing vs.
59:2828:148348:16:15:72:526:313:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:first-best mechanisms, and the loss in model fit is not as drastic in this sample.  This is consistent with
59:2829:148455:15:16:72:526:298:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the evidence in Figure 10, where the densities in the fleet/lease sample, panels (b) and (d), while affected
59:2830:148563:16:32:72:325:282:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:by rearrangement, are not as affected as that in panel (c).

59:2832:148691:22:15:72:526:228:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:As a check of model fit and robustness, Table 8 displays, for alternative sample restrictions in the dealers

59:2834:148903:16:15:72:526:197:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:results under the same sample restrictions in the fleet/lease sample. In each table, panel A displays results
59:2835:149012:15:16:72:526:182:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:for the seller distribution upper bound and panel B for the seller distribution lower bound.  The first row
59:2836:149119:16:16:72:526:166:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in each panel displays the full sample results (equivalent to results in Tables 4 and 5).  The second row
59:2837:149224:16:15:72:526:150:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:results use only the first time a car is run in order to eliminate any correlation among buyer and seller
59:2838:149329:15:16:72:526:135:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:values for a given car which is run multiple times (the full sample estimation treats these multiple runs
59:2839:149434:16:15:72:526:119:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:as independent).  The results are quite similar in each panel to the full sample, although the probability
59:2840:149540:15:0:72:298:104:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of trade is somewhat higher under each mechanism.

62:2985:153168:0:15:86:525:681:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The third row of each panel uses only the first car offered for sale by a given seller on a given day,

62:2987:153379:16:15:72:526:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:may be affected by the outcomes of her previous sales that day.  The sample size is reduced substantially

62:2989:153602:16:16:72:526:619:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:The estimates using the upper bound of seller valuations suggest that dynamic bargaining is less efficient
62:2990:153708:16:15:72:526:603:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:than implied by the full sample, capturing 76.4% of the second-best surplus in the dealers sample and
62:2991:153809:15:16:72:526:588:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:only 70.0% in the fleet/lease sample.  However, using the lower bound of seller surplus, the percentages
62:2992:153913:16:15:72:244:572:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in rows one and three are more similar.
62:2993:153952:15:16:86:525:557:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The fourth row of each panel limits the sample to cars with a blue book value lying below the median.
62:2994:154053:16:15:72:526:541:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:In each panel, row four demonstrates a lower level of expected gains from trade among these lower-priced
62:2995:154157:15:16:72:526:526:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:cars.  The efficiency of bargaining appears similar to the full sample.  The final row limits the sample
62:2996:154261:16:15:72:526:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to new cars (those with age below the median age).  This sample results in higher expected gains from
62:2997:154362:15:16:72:526:495:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:trade but similar efficiency implications to the full sample in most cases.  One exception is in panel A of
62:2998:154469:16:15:72:526:479:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Table 8, which demonstrates that using the upper bound of the seller distribution implies that dynamic
62:2999:154571:15:16:72:321:464:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:bargaining only captures 76% of the second-best surplus.

62:3003:154942:16:32:72:307:401:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:prices.  In both tables the columns agree quite closely.

62:3011:155479:22:16:72:526:225:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Table 12 displays the welfare estimates in a setting where bargaining takes place between the seller and a
62:3012:155585:16:15:72:526:209:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:random bidder rather than the high-value bidder.  Note that this setting will shift not only the outcomes
62:3013:155690:15:16:72:425:194:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:achieved in dynamic bargaining, but also the first-best and second-best frontiers.

62:3017:156076:16:15:72:526:131:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:bidder is equivalent to an auction followed by bargaining where the auction price was the lowest possible
62:3018:156181:15:0:72:333:116:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:price and hence yielded no truncation of the buyer support.

66:3245:166077:14:0:72:198:104:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:seller distribution lower bound.
67:3246:166111:0:15:86:525:681:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:For the dynamic mechanism, bargaining with a random bidder is more difficult to simulate accurately
67:3247:166210:15:16:72:526:666:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:without estimating a model yielding predictions of equilibrium bargaining behavior, which, as highlighted
67:3248:166315:16:15:72:526:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:above, is infeasible. However, following the argument in Section 5.2, the allocation function in the dynamic
67:3249:166423:15:16:72:525:635:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:bargaining is identified for any value of Ψ =R−B(2).  Therefore,  I evaluate the expected gains from
67:3250:166523:16:16:72:444:619:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:trade by integrating over buyer types and seller types, setting the auction price toB.
67:3251:166609:16:15:86:525:603:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Table 12 presents the results.  Panel A1 displays the results for the dealers sample using the seller
67:3252:166710:15:16:72:526:588:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:distribution upper bound, and shows that second-best bargaining with a random bidder captures 96.8%
67:3253:166809:16:15:72:526:572:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of the first-best surplus.  This suggests that, even in the absence of an auction which selects the high-value
67:3254:166919:15:16:72:526:557:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:bidder, the deadweight loss due to incomplete information may not be large.  The deadweight loss due to
67:3255:167022:16:15:72:526:541:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:limited commitment does not appear to increase in panel A1 relative to the main results in Table 4, as the
67:3256:167128:15:16:72:526:526:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:dynamic mechanism captures 86.4% of the second-best surplus.  In panel A2, using the seller distribution
67:3257:167232:16:15:72:526:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:lower bound, the dynamic mechanism only achieves 70.5% of the second-best level.  The results for the
67:3258:167333:15:16:72:391:495:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:expected gains from trade in the fleet/lease sample (panel B) are similar.
67:3259:167407:16:15:86:525:479:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The results in Table 12 provide some evidence that the model fit is worse when the auction is ignored,
67:3260:167509:15:16:72:526:464:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:as the probability of trade in the dynamic mechanism greatly exceeds the first-best level, suggesting some
67:3261:167615:16:15:72:526:448:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:trades are occurring even the seller values the good more than the buyer.  This implies that the fit of the
67:3262:167722:15:16:72:525:433:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:allocation function,g0, is worse when conditioning on the auction price being fixed at the lower bound
67:3263:167824:16:16:72:525:417:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of the buyer support,B, than when integrating over all values of the auction price.  Also note that in the
67:3264:167930:16:15:72:526:401:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:random bidder setting, the expected transfer between the buyer and seller is not identified, whereas in the
67:3265:168037:15:16:72:526:386:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:currently used auction-followed-by-bargaining mechanism, the expected transfer is directly observable in
67:3266:168141:16:15:72:526:370:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the data.  For these reasons, I do not focus on the random-bidder-bargaining setting in the main body of
67:3267:168245:15:30:72:117:355:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the paper.

67:3269:168300:22:15:72:526:303:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Table 13 displays the comparison of the main results from Tables 4–5 to the results from a setting where
67:3270:168404:15:16:72:526:288:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:all players can commit not to bargain ex-post and where the seller chooses only to accept or reject the
67:3271:168507:16:15:72:526:272:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:auction price.  As seen by the percentages in square brackets in the “Accept/reject only” column, this
67:3272:168609:15:16:72:526:257:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:alternative mechanism would capture all or nearly all of the second-best surplus and probability of trade,
67:3273:168715:16:15:72:526:241:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:suggesting that such commitment could eliminate the need for bargaining.  Conversations with industry
67:3274:168816:15:16:72:526:226:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:professionals reveal that, while this alternative mechanism is used at some auto auction houses, others
67:3275:168919:16:15:72:526:210:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:have historically found such commitment difficult to maintain, as both the high-value bidder and the seller
67:3276:169026:15:30:72:526:195:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:have incentives ex-post to negotiate when the seller rejects the second-order statistic of buyer valuations.

67:3281:169473:16:0:71:525:96:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:passes on to the seller.  These transfer functions can be defined in many ways.  One such way is given by

70:3451:176109:230:14:72:467:229:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:Notes:  Estimates of auction house revenue, expected gains from trade, and probability of trade in
70:3452:176207:14:15:72:520:215:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:broker-optimal vs.  dynamic mechanisms.  Estimates from dealers sample shown on the left and from fleet/lease
70:3453:176316:15:26:72:153:200:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:sample on the right.
70:3454:176336:26:16:86:525:174:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The performance of this mechanism relative to the dynamic mechanism is shown in Table 14.  The
70:3455:176430:16:15:72:526:158:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:expected revenue for the auction house in the dynamic mechanism is estimated using data on fees when
70:3456:176530:15:16:72:526:143:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:trade occurs.  Table 14 demonstrates that, in the dealers sample, the broker-optimal mechanism would
70:3457:176630:16:16:72:525:127:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:result in auction house revenues of$3,712 under the seller distribution upper bound, and$1,824 under the
70:3458:176734:16:15:72:526:111:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:seller distribution lower bound.  Under the current dynamic mechanism, these revenues are much lower,
70:3459:176835:15:0:72:526:96:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:at$219.  The comparison is similar in the fleet/lease sample.  Both buyer gains and seller gains would be
71:3460:176942:0:15:72:526:681:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:much lower in the broker-optimal mechanism, as the majority of surplus would be taken by the auction
71:3461:177042:15:16:72:526:666:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:house.  The probability of trade would also decrease, from about 0.70 to 0.352–0.631 in the dealers sample,
71:3462:177149:16:15:72:526:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and from about 0.76 to 0.451–0.697 in the fleet/lease sample.  Comparing the total expected gains from
71:3463:177251:15:16:72:526:635:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:trade in the broker-optimal mechanism to the second-best from Tables 4–5 highlights that this mechanism
71:3464:177354:16:16:72:446:619:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:introduces an additional deadweight loss due to the broker’s rent-extraction behavior.
71:3465:177440:16:15:86:525:603:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:It is difficult to interpret these results given that a shift to this mechanism would likely drive buyers
71:3466:177545:15:16:72:526:588:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and sellers away from the auction house and toward competing sourcing venues, and this competition is
71:3467:177646:16:15:72:526:572:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:not expressed in the model.  Therefore, while auction house revenue is clearly of primary interest to the
71:3468:177751:15:16:72:526:557:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:auction house, competition among auction houses may impede an individual auction house from achieving
71:3469:177852:16:15:72:526:541:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the payoff of the broker-optimal mechanism.  Townsend (1983) demonstrated, in a general equilibrium
71:3470:177951:15:16:72:526:526:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:framework,  that  competition  among  auction  houses,  or  even  the  threat  of  competition,  leads  to  the
71:3471:178062:16:15:72:526:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Walrasian equilibrium as the number of buyers and sellers grows large.  Thus, auction houses may appear
71:3472:178165:15:16:72:526:495:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to behave as though they were maximizing surplus rather than achieving the optimal revenue for a solo
71:3473:178266:16:15:72:526:479:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:auction  house.   However,  Economides  and  Siow  (1988)  showed,  in  a  competition-on-a-line  framework,
71:3474:178374:15:16:72:526:464:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that  liquidity  provides  positive  externalities  for  buyers  and  sellers  which  are  not  fully  internalized  by
71:3475:178493:16:15:72:526:448:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the auction house, and this may prevent efficient entry of auction houses and hence prevent the market
71:3476:178595:15:16:72:526:433:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:from achieving the surplus-maximizing allocation.  It is theoretically ambiguous how close auction houses
71:3477:178700:16:16:72:526:417:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:would come to achieving the revenue-maximizing outcomes in a setting with two-sided uncertainty.  For
71:3478:178801:16:15:72:526:401:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:these reasons, and due to the fact that I have no data on competing auction houses, I do not focus on
71:3479:178902:15:0:72:264:386:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:this mechanism in the main body of results.
