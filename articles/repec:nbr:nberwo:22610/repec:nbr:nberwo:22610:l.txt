2:28:1443:14:14:72:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:abuse-treatment facility openings and closings measured at the county level. The results indicate 
2:29:1540:14:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:that  substance-abuse-treatment facilities  reduce  both  violent  and  financially  motivated  crimes  in

3:52:2196:0:32:72:185:709:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:1    Introduction
3:53:2213:32:20:72:540:677:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Drug-induced deaths in the United States have increased 280 percent since 1999 and now represent
3:54:2309:20:20:72:540:657:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the largest major category of external causes of death by a wide margin:  there were 47,055 deaths
3:55:2407:20:21:72:540:637:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:due to drug overdoses in 2014 compared to 32,675 due to motor vehicle accidents.1These facts
3:56:2499:21:20:72:540:616:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:underscore a growing need to understand how to reduce drug-related harms.  Towards this end, a
3:57:2593:20:20:72:540:596:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:large body of work has shown that policies targeting the supply of drugs are rarely effective.2In
3:58:2690:20:21:72:540:576:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:contrast, recent work indicates that expanding access to substance-abuse treatment (SAT) facilities
3:59:2789:21:20:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:significantly reduces severe drug abuse, as measured by drug-induced mortality (Swensen, 2015).
3:60:2884:20:20:72:540:535:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:While this evidence highlights that investments in SAT can improve outcomes for some individuals,
3:61:2981:20:20:72:540:515:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:it  does  not  necessarily  reflect  a  broad-based  benefit  for  communities  that  might  be  considering
3:62:3089:20:21:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:making such investments.  In this paper we fill this important gap in the literature by estimating
3:63:3187:21:20:72:274:474:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the effects of SAT facilities on local crime.
3:64:3232:20:20:90:540:454:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:There are several mechanisms through which SAT facilities may affect local crime.  As outlined
3:65:3326:20:21:72:540:434:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in Goldstein’s (1985) influential tripartite conceptual framework for the drugs-violence nexus, drugs
3:66:3427:21:20:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:may  affect  violence  through  psychopharmacological  effects,  economically  compulsive  effects,  and
3:67:3531:20:20:72:540:393:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:systemic effects.  In these terms,  SAT could be expected to reduce violence by:  (i) reducing the
3:68:3629:20:21:72:540:373:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:use of drugs that lead to aggressive behavior (though there may be some offsetting effects caused
3:69:3726:21:20:72:540:352:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by withdrawal), (ii) by reducing conflicts associated with financially motivated crimes committed
3:70:3823:20:20:72:540:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by  addicts  seeking  funds  to  buy  drugs,  and  (iii)  by  reducing  violence  among  and  against  those
3:71:3931:20:21:72:539:312:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:associated with the drug trade.3Moreover, drug-abuse treatment may reduce gun carrying through
3:72:4025:21:20:72:540:291:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:all three of these mechanisms, which could serve to reduce the amount—and intensity—of violence
3:73:4120:20:20:72:540:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in communities.  It is also important to keep in mind that a relatively large share of drug users
3:74:4217:20:21:72:540:251:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:have mental health problems that contribute to their addiction and to violent behaviors (Lavine,
3:75:4313:21:20:72:540:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:1997; Hoaken and Stewart, 2003).  As such, we could expect SAT to reduce violence because it can
3:76:4409:20:20:72:540:210:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:itself include—or can direct patients towards—treatment for underlying mental health problems
3:77:4502:20:21:72:540:190:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that contribute to violence (Lavine, 1997; Marcotte and Markowitz, 2011).  Finally, SAT treatment
3:78:4599:21:20:72:540:169:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:may reduce criminal activity through positive spillover effects on friends and family members of
3:79:4695:20:16:72:196:149:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:those receiving treatment.

3:81:4762:11:15:84:539:122:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:2See for instance Dinardo (1993), Yuan and Caulkins (1998), Miron (2003), Cunningham and Liu (2003), Kuziemko

3:83:4984:7:15:84:539:100:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:3Prior studies have documented causal effects of drug activity on community violence by exploiting variation in
3:84:5095:15:11:72:540:85:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:drug  use  induced  by  price  shocks  (Markowitz,  2001,  2005)  and  by  exploiting  variation  in  the  timing  with  which
3:85:5221:11:0:72:446:74:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:specific drugs became available across different cities (Evans, et al., 2012; Fryer et al., 2013).
4:86:5320:0:21:90:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Although these mechanisms highlight how SAT facilities can reduce crime through their effect
4:87:5412:21:20:72:539:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f7:B:on drug abuse, there are other mechanisms through which we might expect SAT facilities toincrease
4:88:5509:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:local crime.  Featuring prominently in not-in-my-backyard arguments against SAT facilities is the
4:89:5606:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:notion that such facilities pose risks by drawing into the area individuals who have relatively high
4:90:5706:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rates of crime perpetration (drug users).  Going beyond the idea of shifting crime perpetration from
4:91:5806:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:one place to another, SAT facilities could increase crime by altering the social and environmental
4:92:5904:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:context faced by drug users.  That is, by altering the types of people and places that they encounter
4:93:6005:21:20:72:214:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and with which they interact.
4:94:6034:20:20:90:540:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In this study we contribute to this policy debate by quantifying the effects of SAT facilities on
4:95:6131:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:crime.  Specifically, we use annual county-level data on the number of SAT facilities to evaluate the
4:96:6232:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:degree to which crime rates change when SAT facilities open and close.  We consider various crime
4:97:6329:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:outcomes measured over time at the county and law-enforcement agency level, based on data from
4:98:6423:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the National Center for Health Statistics and the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting Program.  These
4:99:6518:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:panel  data  allow  us  to  include  a  rich  set  of  fixed  effects  (county/agency  and  state-by-year)  and
4:100:6629:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:control  variables  (demographics,  various  measures  of  economic  conditions,  and  law  enforcement
4:101:6732:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:presence)  in  our  models,  so  the  estimates  are  identified  based  on  plausibly  exogenous  variation.
4:102:6841:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Several  ancillary  analyses  support  the  validity  of  this  research  design,  including  analyses  that
4:103:6949:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:demonstrate that outcomes in an area change after but not before the number of facilities change.
4:104:7046:20:21:90:540:343:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Our approach shifts the focus from the effects of SAT on those who receive treatment to the
4:105:7137:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:effects of SAT facilities on the communities they serve. This allows us to make several contributions.
4:106:7239:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:First, we consider outcomes that tend to be beyond the scope of randomized control trials (RCTs),
4:107:7336:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:which are limited by small samples, short follow-up periods, and the potential for false reporting.
4:108:7435:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In particular, our approach allows us to consider severe-but-infrequent outcomes (e.g., homicide)
4:109:7532:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and behaviors that individuals are likely to conceal (e.g., sexual assault).  Second, our estimates
4:110:7631:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:reflect the effects of SAT on patients and the spillover effects onto the broader community, inclusive
4:111:7733:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of any spillover effects on nearby friends and family and on the market for illegal drugs.  In so doing,
4:112:7837:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:our estimates will allow for more comprehensive cost-benefit considerations.  Third,  whereas the
4:113:7934:20:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:nature of RCTs tends to require the use of small localized samples, which may have limited external
4:114:8033:21:20:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:validity, our use of administrative data allows us to obtain estimates that reflect the effects of SAT
4:115:8135:20:20:72:234:119:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:facilities across the United States.
4:116:8171:20:20:90:540:99:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Our  analysis  reveals  significant  and  robust  evidence  that  expanding  access  to  SAT  through
4:117:8272:20:0:72:540:79:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:additional treatment facilities reduces local crime.  The effects appear to be particularly pronounced
5:118:8375:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for  relatively  serious  violent  and  financially  motivated  crimes:   homicides,  aggravated  assaults,
5:119:8482:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:robbery,  and  motor  vehicle  theft.   We  do  not  find  significant  effects  on  more  frequent  but  less
5:120:8592:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:serious crimes (simple assault, burglary, and larceny), nor do we find a significant effect on sexual
5:121:8693:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:assault.  Overall, we find that an additional treatment facility reduces felony-type crimes by 0.10
5:122:8792:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:percent annually.  We show that the estimated effect on homicides is present across three different
5:123:8891:20:20:72:192:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sources of homicide data.
5:124:8916:20:21:90:540:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Despite the various contributions of our research described above, there are some limitations
5:125:9009:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that bear noting.  First, our empirical approach, which focuses on county- and law-enforcement-
5:126:9104:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:agency-level aggregates, implies that we cannot separate the effects of SAT facilities on those who
5:127:9203:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:receive treatment from the effects of SAT facilities on the broader community.  That said, we view
5:128:9301:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:this as a reasonable tradeoff in order to be able to speak to the effects on the community as a whole.
5:129:9403:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Second, while there is significant variation across SAT facilities in the types of treatment that they
5:130:9505:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:offer, our estimates will reflect an average of the effects of these facilities.  Finally, openings and
5:131:9608:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:closings of SAT facilities are not random.  While this has the potential to compromise our ability to
5:132:9709:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:identify causal effects, our ancillary analyses, which are discussed in detail in subsequent sections,
5:133:9811:20:21:72:379:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:demonstrate that it is unlikely in light of our empirical strategy.
5:134:9878:21:20:90:540:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.  Section 2 discusses relevant background on
5:135:9974:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:drug abuse and treatment in the United States, in addition to related studies that have considered

5:137:10183:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:detail.   Section  5  begins  with  a  replication  and  extension  of  Swensen  (2015)  to  show  the  effects
5:138:10294:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of SAT facilities on severe drug abuse and then presents the results of our analyses that focus on
5:139:10392:20:44:72:305:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:crime.  We offer concluding remarks in Section 6.

5:142:10492:28:20:72:540:179:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:According to the National Survey of Drug Use and Health over 21.5 million people in the U.S. are
5:143:10588:20:20:72:540:159:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:classified as having a substance-use disorder (CBHSQ, 2015).4A high incidence of substance abuse
5:144:10684:20:21:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is also apparent in crime perpetration, with 40 percent of convicted violent criminals being under the
5:145:10786:21:16:72:540:118:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:influence of alcohol and nearly 60 percent of all arrestees testing positive for some illicit substance
5:146:10889:16:0:84:537:102:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:4Based on criteria specified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV)
6:147:11001:0:21:72:539:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:at the time of arrest.5The annual societal costs of drug abuse solely in terms of drug-related crime

6:149:11143:20:20:90:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Though substance-abuse treatment is a promising avenue to reduce these costs, treatment rates

6:151:11344:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:illicit substance did not receive treatment and despite the prevalence of alcohol and drugs among
6:152:11441:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:arrestees, 70 percent of arrestees have never been in any form of drug or alcohol treatment (ONDCP,
6:153:11540:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:2014).  Notably, recent changes brought about by the Affordable Care Act are expected to increase
6:154:11637:21:20:72:461:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:coverage and take-up of treatment (Buck, 2011; Beronio, Glied, and Frank 2014).
6:155:11716:20:20:90:540:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In this context, the number of substance-abuse treatment facilities may be a particularly rel-
6:156:11810:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:evant policy parameter.  In the United States, over 14,500 stand-alone treatment facilities are the
6:157:11909:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:primary setting for delivery of substance-abuse treatment, offering a wide range of drug-treatment
6:158:12007:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:programs and related services (SAMHSA, 2014).  Local treatment centers most commonly offer out-
6:159:12102:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:patient care to deliver treatment programs such as detoxification, methadone maintenance, regular

6:161:12293:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:substance-abuse problems, facilities provide residential treatment in which clients temporarily live
6:162:12393:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:at  the  treatment  site  (e.g.   inpatient  detoxification,  chemical  dependency  programs,  therapeutic
6:163:12499:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:communities).   While  treatment  programs  vary  substantially  and  often  target  particular  demo-

6:165:12701:20:21:72:386:343:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the consequences of drug abuse and encourage healthier lifestyles.
6:166:12767:21:20:90:540:322:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:More broadly,  the substance-abuse treatment industry includes profit,  non-profit,  and public
6:167:12862:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:providers,  the  bulk  of  which  (87  percent)  are  privately-owned  facilities.7Though  the  objective
6:168:12967:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:functions of facilities may differ somewhat by ownership status and treatment focus, the decision
6:169:13064:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to open or close a treatment facility likely depends crucially on (i) a perceived need for treatment
6:170:13164:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:providers or opportunities to improve upon currently offered treatment services and (ii) the ability
6:171:13264:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to secure funding for treatment services from either public or private third-party payers (SAMHSA
6:172:13361:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:2011).   Given  the  high  need  for  addiction  treatment  and  existing  evidence  of  binding  treatment
6:173:13468:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:capacity  constraints  and  long  wait  lists,  the  availability  of  funds  is  particularly  relevant  when

7:184:14332:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:abuse treatment relies primarily on public funding in the form of federal block grants and state
7:185:14428:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:subsidies.  That said, recent mental health parity legislation and the rise of managed-care contracts
7:186:14529:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:have increased the importance of public and private insurance revenue to providers (Horgan and

7:191:14918:27:21:72:540:524:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:An extensive literature has evaluated the relationship between substance-abuse treatment programs
7:192:15015:21:20:72:540:503:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and criminal activities,  including some that use “the gold standard” for empirical research,  ran-
7:193:15114:20:20:72:540:483:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:domized control trials (RCTs).  In a widely-cited meta analysis, Pendergast et al.  (2002) reviewed
7:194:15213:20:21:72:540:463:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:78 studies of SAT, 60 percent of which used random or quasi-random assignment to treatment and
7:195:15307:21:20:72:540:442:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:25 of which examined crime outcomes.  The authors found an average 13 percent decline in criminal
7:196:15404:20:20:72:539:422:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:involvement as a result of treatment.9More recent reviews of specific treatment approaches provide
7:197:15502:20:21:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consistent evidence that criminal involvement declines during treatment and mixed evidence when

7:200:15719:20:21:90:540:341:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The existing literature also adds insight into the efficacy of specific treatment settings in reduc-

7:202:15914:20:20:72:540:300:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:evaluating  prison-based  drug  treatment.   This  is  partly  due  to  the  relative  ease  of  employing  a
7:203:16023:20:21:72:540:280:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:randomized treatment design and the ability to consider recidivism rates rather than relying on
7:204:16118:21:20:72:539:259:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:self-reported criminal activity.10Summarizing the literature, Mitchell et.  al (2012) review 74 stud-
7:205:16219:20:20:72:540:239:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ies of prison-based treatment programs and conclude that substance-abuse treatment for inmates
7:206:16313:20:20:72:540:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:reduces recidivism by 15 percent.  Existing evidence also suggests that court-mandated treatment
7:207:16409:20:21:72:539:199:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:programs, which account for a third of all treatment admissions, can be effective in reducing crime.11
7:208:16511:21:19:72:540:178:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:For instance, Wilson, Mitchell, and Mackenzie (2006) identify and review 55 quasi-experimental and

7:211:16844:11:11:72:540:137:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:part, because of treatment capacity constraints suggested by limited growth in the number of treatment facilities and
7:212:16961:11:7:72:222:126:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:increasing treatment waiting periods.

7:215:17205:7:15:80:539:97:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:10Treatment rates increased by 34 percent among state inmates and 90 percent among federal inmates from 1997-

8:226:18000:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is predicated on the notion that some of the most important questions about the effects of SAT are

8:231:18477:20:21:90:540:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To our knowledge only one other recent working paper attempts to consider the effects of SAT
8:232:18569:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on  crime  in  such  a  comprehensive  fashion.   Wen,  Hockenberry,  and  Cummings  (2014)  consider
8:233:18670:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the  effects  of  changes  in  SAT  rates  on  property  and  violent  crimes  using  data  collected  by  the
8:234:18780:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:FBI that span the United States.  Their instrumental variables approach relies on the assumption
8:235:18876:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that  state  health  insurance  expansions  (made  possible  through  Health  Insurance  Flexibility  and
8:236:18981:20:20:72:539:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Accountability  waivers)  only  relate  to  changes  in  crime  through  their  impacts  on  SAT.12This
8:237:19084:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:assumption could be violated if, for example, expanding access to health insurance affects crime
8:238:19180:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:through its impact on treatment for mental health problems or through its impacts on overall health
8:239:19279:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and well being.  As all observational studies rely on fundamentally untestable assumptions, and as
8:240:19377:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:any body of evidence is more compelling when similar results are documented using approaches that
8:241:19474:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rely on different assumptions, we view our work as an important contribution that complements this
8:242:19572:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:prior study, which reports that increases in substance-use-disorder treatment significantly reduces

8:247:19911:17:14:80:539:109:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:12They also use as an instrumental variable state-level mandates requiring private group health plans to provide
8:248:20023:14:11:72:540:95:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:benefits  for  substance-use  disorder  treatment  that  are  no  more  restrictive  than  the  benefits  for  medical  insurance
8:249:20152:11:11:72:540:84:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:parity mandates; however, it is always used in conjunction with the waiver expansion instrument, presumably due to
8:250:20266:11:38:72:188:73:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:a lack of independent power.

9:254:20489:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:classified separately in the CBP data,  residential and outpatient establishments often offer both

9:257:20800:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and  residential  facilities  would  not  be  informative  as  residential  and  outpatient  services  are  not
9:258:20911:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:distinctly identified.  As such, we combine outpatient and residential classifications using the total
9:259:21013:21:20:72:529:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:count of establishments as an indicator for county-level provision of substance-abuse treatment.

9:269:21914:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:data,  which  provide  a  measure  of  homicides,  and  the  Uniform  Crime  Reports  (UCR)  which  are

9:273:22313:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:include  the  most  commonly  reported  violent  and  property  crimes  including  criminal  homicide,
9:274:22415:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sexual assault, robbery, assault, burglary, larceny theft, and motor vehicle theft. We focus on known
9:275:22516:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:offenses in order to capture crimes that come to the attention of law enforcement, as opposed to
9:276:22612:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:alternative data sets that are available but are restricted to crimes that have been cleared by arrest.
9:277:22715:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In addition, we use the UCR Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR) to consider additional details
9:278:22810:20:16:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the victims, offenders, and circumstances associated with homicides.  The SHR is an incident-

9:281:23111:7:15:80:539:142:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:14In particular, we use the following ICD-10 codes to measure drug-induced mortality:  X40-X45, X60-X65, X85,
9:282:23220:15:7:72:110:127:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:Y10-Y15.
9:283:23228:7:14:80:539:120:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:15As reported by Stevens et al.  (2015), the Cancer-SEER population data are more accurate than data interpolated
9:284:23341:14:11:72:540:106:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:from the Census because they “are based on an algorithm that incorporates information from Vital statistics, IRS
9:285:23453:11:8:72:274:95:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:migration files, and the Social Security database.”

10:290:23813:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:participating in the UCR program.  For agencies that do report homicides in the SHR, we impute
10:291:23907:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:zeros by expanding the SHR to the same agency-years as our UCR Offenses Known sample.  We
10:292:23996:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:link  the  UCR  agency-level  data  with  county-level  CBP  data  using  the  primary  county  in  which
10:293:24101:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:each municipality resides and calculate crime rates using the annual reported population covered
10:294:24197:20:20:72:196:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by each municipal agency.
10:295:24222:20:21:90:540:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We restrict our analysis to U.S. counties with at least one treatment facility over the 1999-2012

10:297:24426:20:20:71:539:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:data  include  treatment  facility,  mortality,  and  crime  data  in  48  states,  spanning  14  years.18In
10:298:24534:20:21:71:539:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Table 1 we present summary statistics for our sample, weighted by the relevant populations.  CBP
10:299:24630:21:20:71:539:505:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:data indicate that counties have a population-weighted average of 49.5 SAT facilities.  Importantly,
10:300:24730:20:20:71:539:485:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:there is substantial variation in the number of facilities with the average county experiencing 5.8

10:302:24925:21:20:71:539:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:increase in the number of facilities from one year to the next and a net closing is defined similarly.
10:303:25027:20:20:71:539:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:For reference, Table 1 also shows summary statistics for each mortality and crime outcome used in

10:306:25160:31:20:71:539:329:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We  identify  the  effects  of  SAT  facilities  using  year-to-year  variation  within  counties  driven  by
10:307:25269:20:20:71:539:309:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:facility openings and closings, controlling for state-by-year shocks common to areas within a state

10:309:25475:21:20:71:539:268:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:outcomes, we operationalize this strategy using a regression model that includes either county or

11:321:26616:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rates to avoid dropping area-year observations for which the outcome would otherwise be undefined,
11:322:26714:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:but  we  show  that  results  of  all  of  our  analyses  are  similar  if  we  instead  simply  focus  on  areas

11:335:27979:21:20:90:540:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Our focus on within-area variation accounts for fixed characteristics of areas (both observable
11:336:28074:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and  unobservable)  that  may  be  correlated  with  the  number  of  SAT  facilities  in  the  county  and
11:337:28181:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:our outcomes of interest.  For example, this approach will address the fact that there are inherent
11:338:28280:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:differences between urban and rural counties.  The inclusion of state-by-year fixed effects account
11:339:28379:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for aggregate time-varying shocks, such as aggregate economic conditions or changes in the national
11:340:28478:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:drug-control strategy.  They also control for state-specific shocks such as changes in state funding
11:341:28578:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for  law  enforcement  services.   The  controls  for  unemployment  rates  and  firm  births  account  for
11:342:28685:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the possibility that our outcomes of interest and treatment facilities may both be related to local
11:343:28784:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:economic conditions.  The controls for demographics account for the possibility that compositional
11:344:28882:21:20:72:493:200:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:changes in a county’s population may affect outcomes and investments in SAT facilities.
11:345:28969:20:20:90:540:180:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Our  empirical  approach  closely  follows  Swensen  (2015),  who  also  conducts  several  ancillary
11:346:29070:20:16:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:analyses in support the validity of the research design.  In particular, Swensen demonstrates that
11:347:29168:16:15:80:539:144:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:19County  unemployment  rates  are  from  the  BLS  Local  Area  Unemployment  Statistics.   Firm  births  include  all
11:348:29287:15:11:72:540:129:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:county-level firm births reported by the U.S. Census Statistics of U.S. Businesses.  The number of law-enforcement
11:349:29401:11:11:72:540:118:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:officers per 100,000 residents are calculated using the UCR agency-specific employment reports available in the Law

11:351:29575:7:15:80:539:100:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:20That  is,  we  estimate  two-way  standard  errors  clustered  on  counties  and  years.   This  approach  yields  more
11:352:29696:15:11:72:540:85:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:conservative estimates than estimates that solely cluster on counties, reflecting that there are unobserved shocks to
11:353:29813:11:39:72:189:74:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:outcomes that span counties.

12:356:29954:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:facilities are greatest for causes of death that are most closely related to drug abuse.21Importantly,

12:358:30155:20:21:71:539:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:such,  increases in admissions due to an additional SAT facility may correspond with more drug
12:359:30249:21:20:71:539:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:offenders  in  public,  leading  to  estimates  that  understate  any  decreases  in  drug-related  criminal

12:364:30665:20:21:71:539:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ties.  Furthermore, his estimates from models that consider additional lags and leads of treatment
12:365:30763:21:20:71:539:505:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:facilities show that the that previous- and current-year changes in the number of facilities is sig-
12:366:30863:20:20:71:539:485:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:nificantly related to drug-induced mortality, but that drug-induced mortality is not related to the
12:367:30962:20:21:71:539:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:number of facilities in future periods.22In a similar fashion, we estimate a version of Eq.  (1) that
12:368:31063:21:20:71:539:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:also considers the effect of the number of facilities in the current, previous and subsequent years
12:369:31162:20:20:71:539:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on the outcomes that are the focus of this paper.  The results of this analysis, discussed in more
12:370:31260:20:21:71:539:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:detail  below,  indicate  that  changes  in  the  number  of  treatment  facilities  are  also  not  driven  by
12:371:31371:21:20:71:539:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:recent changes in drug abuse or crime.  That said, we note that our estimates would understate the
12:372:31469:20:20:71:539:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:benefits of SAT facilities if they opened in response to recent increases in drug abuse and related

12:376:31660:28:20:71:539:240:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We begin our analysis of the effects of SAT facilities by documenting their effects on serious drug
12:377:31759:20:20:71:539:220:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:abuse measured by drug-induced mortality rates at the county level.  Specifically,  we expand on
12:378:31855:20:21:71:539:200:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Swensen’s (2015) analysis by adding four additional years of restricted-use NCHS mortality data
12:379:31950:21:16:71:539:179:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to bring it in line with the years of data used in our analysis of crime, which run through 2012.
12:380:32047:16:14:80:539:163:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:21Swensen uses data on admissions into facilities receiving public funding to offer “proof of concept” that increases in
12:381:32167:14:11:72:540:149:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:treatment facilities leads to a change in an underlying factor associated with treatment.  Notably, other mechanisms—
12:382:32284:11:11:72:540:138:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:including  perceptions  toward  treatment  or  factors  influencing  the  quality  and  accessibility  treatment—may  also
12:383:32406:11:7:72:360:127:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:contribute to declines in substance abuse as treatment services expand.
12:384:32477:7:15:80:539:120:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:22Swensen also estimates models using demand-side characteristics to predict treatment facility openings in order to
12:385:32593:15:11:72:540:105:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:offer insight into the degree to which treatment provision responds to changes in the demand for addictive substances.
12:386:32711:11:11:72:540:94:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:His results suggest that the number of treatment facilities varies directly with measures that proxy for the demand
12:387:32826:11:11:72:540:83:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:for addictive substances, he argues that not adequately accounting for these correlations would understate the effect
12:388:32943:11:37:72:316:72:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:of an additional treatment facility on drug-related mortality.

13:390:33007:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In Table 2, we show the results of this analysis, using logged drug-induced mortality rates as the
13:391:33105:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:outcome.   Columns  1–5  report  the  estimates  from  increasingly  flexible  specifications:  Column  1
13:392:33210:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:shows estimates based on a model that only includes county and year fixed effects; Column 2 shows
13:393:33307:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:estimates that additionally control for state-by-year fixed effects; and Columns 3–5 show estimates
13:394:33406:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that additionally control for county-level time-varying measures of demographics, economic condi-
13:395:33503:20:20:72:539:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tions, and the size of the police force.23With the exception of the Column 1 estimate, which omits
13:396:33601:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:controls for state-by-year fixed effects, the estimates are precise and similar in magnitude across
13:397:33700:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:specifications.  They indicate a 0.50 percent decline in drug-induced mortality rates associated with
13:398:33801:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:an additional SAT facility in a county.24This estimate is very similar to the estimated effect of
13:399:33898:20:37:72:267:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:0.42 percent reported in Swensen (2015).

13:402:33989:27:21:72:540:435:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Before turning to estimates that are based on Uniform Crime Reports data, we begin our analysis
13:403:34084:21:20:72:540:414:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of crime by analyzing homicide deaths recorded in NCHS mortality data.  Though these also include
13:404:34181:20:20:72:540:394:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:justified homicides, 94 percent are unjustified criminal homicides and, as such, they can shed light
13:405:34281:20:21:72:540:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on the degree to which treatment interventions affect the most serious and costly form of criminal
13:406:34379:21:20:72:539:353:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:activity.25The results of this analysis, shown in the first panel of Table 3, provide causal evidence
13:407:34480:20:20:72:540:333:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that county-level homicide rates are reduced by SAT facilities.  Specifically, the estimates indicate a
13:408:34583:20:21:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:0.24 percent decline in intentional homicide death rates associated with an additional SAT facility.
13:409:34683:21:20:90:540:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In the second and third panels of Table 3 we investigate the effects on homicide rates using
13:410:34775:20:20:72:540:272:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:law-enforcement-agency-level data from the UCR’s Offenses Known and Supplemental Homicide
13:411:34864:20:21:72:540:252:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Reports databases, respectively.  We continue to estimate the same models when using these data,
13:412:34960:21:20:72:540:231:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:but use agency fixed effects instead of county fixed effects and use agency covered population as
13:413:35057:20:20:72:540:211:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the denominator to construct homicide rates.  Analyses of these data continue to indicate that SAT
13:414:35155:20:21:72:540:191:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:facilities  significantly  reduce  homicides  in  areas  covered  by  municipal  law-enforcement  agencies,
13:415:35262:21:20:72:540:170:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:though the estimates are somewhat smaller, indicating a 0.18 percent decline in intentional homicide
13:416:35362:20:16:72:332:150:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:death rates associated with an additional SAT facility.
13:417:35417:16:15:80:539:134:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:23Controls for county economic conditions are the unemployment rate and firm births; controls for demographics
13:418:35527:15:11:72:540:119:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:are the fraction of the population that is white, fraction black, fraction male, fraction 0–9 years old, fraction 10–19

14:424:36039:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ing log rates to avoid dropping area-year observations for which the outcome would otherwise be
14:425:36134:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:undefined.  We acknowledge that this transformation could introduce bias, especially for an out-
14:426:36230:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:come like the homicide rate which tends to be relatively low.  Out of concern for this possibility, in
14:427:36332:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Section 5.4 we will present estimates for each outcome based on an alternative approach in which
14:428:36428:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:we do not add one to outcome counts and we instead focus on areas for which outcome counts are
14:429:36522:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:positive in every year.  These estimates are almost identical to our main results for nearly all of the
14:430:36625:21:35:72:350:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:outcomes we consider, including the overall homicide rate.

14:432:36717:28:20:72:540:503:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In Table 4, we report the results of analyses that exploit the details available in the SHR data to
14:433:36816:20:20:72:540:483:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:separately  consider  homicides  involving  different  victim-offender  relationships.   In  particular,  we
14:434:36924:20:21:72:540:463:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:explore  the  degree  to  which  the  reduction  in  homicides  associated  with  SAT  facilities  (reported
14:435:37032:21:20:72:540:442:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in Table 3) are driven by reductions in homicides committed by individuals who were friends or
14:436:37126:20:20:72:540:422:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:acquaintances  of  the  victim,  homicides  committed  by  strangers,  homicides  committed  by  family
14:437:37229:20:21:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:members, and/or homicides in which the victim-offender relationship was not established by law
14:438:37323:21:20:72:540:381:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:enforcement.  Victim-offender relationships can provide useful information regarding the nature of
14:439:37421:20:20:72:540:361:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:homicide incidents. For instance, investigators were unable to establish victim-offender relationships
14:440:37523:20:21:72:540:341:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in 43 percent of homicides in our sample.  These “uncleared” incidents are more likely to be gang,
14:441:37621:21:20:72:540:320:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:drug-related,  and  stranger  homicides.26When  the  victim-offender  relationship  is  known,  friend
14:442:37723:20:20:71:526:300:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:groups account for 44 percent, strangers for 29 percent, and family for 27 percent of homicides.
14:443:37819:20:21:89:539:280:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The results shown in Table 4 suggest that the effects of SAT facilities on homicides are con-
14:444:37912:21:20:71:539:259:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:centrated among homicide incidents in which the relationship to the offender was unknown or in
14:445:38006:20:20:71:539:239:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:which the offender was a friend.  Specifically, these estimates indicate that an additional treatment
14:446:38107:20:21:71:539:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:facility leads to a 0.14 percent decline in “uncleared” homicides and a 0.26 percent decline in homi-
14:447:38208:21:20:71:539:198:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cides where the offender was a friend of the victim.  There is no evidence of effects on homicides
14:448:38306:20:16:71:220:178:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:committed by family members.
14:449:38334:16:15:80:539:162:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:26The fraction of homicides with an “unknown” victim-offender relationship has steadily increased over the past
14:450:38445:15:11:72:540:147:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:several decades which has been attributed to the changing nature of homicides.  Drug-related homicides in particular
14:451:38561:11:0:72:343:136:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:are less likely to be cleared (Riedel, 2008; Quinet and Nunn, 2014).

15:453:38667:28:20:72:540:681:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Having established that SAT facilities reduce severe drug abuse and reduce the most costly of crimes
15:454:38767:20:20:72:540:661:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(homicides), we next consider the degree to which treatment facilities affect other types of violent
15:455:38867:20:21:72:540:641:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:crimes.  In Table 5 we show a detailed breakdown of the effects of SAT facilities on violent crimes
15:456:38966:21:20:72:540:620:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:based on analyses of the UCR Offenses Known data.  While we focus our discussion below on the
15:457:39059:20:20:72:540:600:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:point estimates from models with the richest set of controls (Column 5), we note that the estimated
15:458:39158:20:21:72:540:580:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:effects are similar across specifications once state-by-year fixed effects and demographic controls
15:459:39257:21:20:72:540:559:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are included as covariates.  The estimates are not sensitive to the inclusion of other county-year
15:460:39355:20:20:72:153:539:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:control variables.
15:461:39373:20:21:90:540:519:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Across the first four panels of Table 5, we sequentially report the estimated effects on violent
15:462:39469:21:20:72:540:498:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:crimes of decreasing severity according to social cost estimates reported in McCollister, French and
15:463:39569:20:20:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Fang  (2010):  homicides  ($9,881,198  per  incident),  sexual  assault  ($264,854),  aggravated  assault
15:464:39674:20:21:72:540:458:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:($117,722),  and  simple  assault.27We  defer  our  consideration  of  robbery  until  the  next  section
15:465:39779:21:20:72:540:437:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:where  we  focus  on  financially  motivated  crimes.   As  mentioned  above,  the  estimated  effect  on
15:466:39884:20:20:72:540:417:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:homicides indicates a significant reduction caused by SAT facilities.  While the point estimate for
15:467:39983:20:21:72:540:397:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the effect on sexual assault is also negative,  suggesting that SAT facilities reduce sexual assault
15:468:40083:21:20:72:540:376:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:as well, it is not close to being statistically significant at conventional levels.  The estimated effect
15:469:40188:20:20:72:540:356:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on aggravated assaults also suggests a reduction in crime associated with SAT facilities,  though
15:470:40285:20:21:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:this estimate is only marginally statistically significant.  Finally, the estimates suggest no effect on
15:471:40389:21:20:72:146:315:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:simple assaults.
15:472:40405:20:20:90:540:295:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The mixed findings described above naturally raise the question of whether there is a “general
15:473:40499:20:21:72:540:275:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:effect” of SAT facilities on violent crime, or whether the significant effects we document are a result
15:474:40602:21:20:72:540:254:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of random chance which becomes increasingly likely as one considers a larger set of outcomes.  As
15:475:40699:20:20:72:540:234:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:described in Anderson (2008), this issue can be addressed through the analysis of summary indices
15:476:40796:20:21:72:540:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that are invariant to the number of outcomes considered.  We take this approach across the final
15:477:40892:21:20:72:540:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:three panels of Table 5 as we consider violent crimes in the aggregate.  First, we estimate the effect
15:478:40994:20:20:72:540:173:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on all violent crimes and do not find a significant effect.  This is not surprising because we did not
15:479:41096:20:21:72:540:153:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:find  evidence  of  effects  on  simple  assaults,  which  represent  77  percent  of  the  crimes  considered.
15:480:41207:21:20:72:540:132:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Second,  we  estimate  the  effect  on  all  violent  crimes  that  are  typically  considered  felonies.   This
15:481:41319:20:16:72:540:112:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:approach amounts to excluding simple assaults from the analysis, which encompass any attempted
15:482:41413:16:15:80:539:96:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:27Note  that  we  have  adjusted  the  cost  estimates  for  inflation  to  put  the  amounts  in  2016  dollars.   McCollister,
15:483:41541:15:46:72:346:81:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:French and Fang (2010) do not include estimates for simple assault.
15:484:41608:46:0:300:311:35:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:?:14
16:485:41610:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:or completed physical contact with malicious intent that does not rise to the level of severity to
16:486:41708:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:constitute  an  aggravated  assault.   The  results  of  this  analysis  indicate  a  statistically  significant
16:487:41820:20:20:72:322:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:effect of SAT facilities on felony-type violent crimes.
16:488:41875:20:21:90:540:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, we estimate the effects on overall violent crime weighted by the social cost estimates
16:489:41970:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:associated with each of the violent crimes considered.  Specifically, we use the log of the inflation-
16:490:42072:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:adjusted  cost  estimates  put  into  2016  dollars  from  McCollister,  French,  and  Fang  (2010).   As
16:491:42177:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:McCollister, French, and Fang (2010) do not estimate the social cost of simple assault, we calculate
16:492:42277:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the  cost  of  simple  assaults  as  20  percent  of  the  cost  of  aggravated  assaults,  which  is  consistent
16:493:42390:20:20:72:539:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:with Cohen and Piquero (2009).28The estimates indicate a 0.15 percent decline in the social costs
16:494:42487:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:associated with violent crime (excluding robbery).  A back-of the envelope calculation based on this
16:495:42587:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:estimate suggests that an additional treatment facility decreases social costs associated with these
16:496:42687:20:36:72:288:485:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:crimes by approximately $615,000 annually.29

16:498:42768:27:20:72:540:422:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Table 6 shows the estimated effects on financially motivated crimes.  We again sequentially report
16:499:42866:20:21:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the estimated effects on crimes of decreasing severity according to social cost estimates:  robbery
16:500:42965:21:20:72:540:381:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:($46,541),  motor  vehicle  theft  ($11,849),  burglary  ($7,108),  and  larceny  ($3,885).   As  with  the
16:501:43072:20:20:72:540:361:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:estimated effects on violent crimes, these estimates suggest more pronounced effects of SAT facilities
16:502:43174:20:21:72:540:341:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on relatively serious crimes. The point estimates indicate that a SAT facility reduces robbery by 0.11
16:503:43276:21:20:72:540:320:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:percent, motor vehicle theft by 0.12 percent, burglary by 0.05 percent, and larceny by 0.04 percent.
16:504:43376:20:20:72:540:300:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The estimated effects on burglary and larceny are not statistically significant at conventional levels.
16:505:43479:20:21:90:540:280:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Our estimates of financially motivated crimes in the aggregate provide further evidence that
16:506:43571:21:20:72:540:259:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:SAT facilities reduce crime.  The estimated effect on financially motivated crimes overall is almost
16:507:43671:20:20:72:540:239:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the same as the estimated effect on larceny, which is not surprising since these crimes represent 65
16:508:43771:20:21:72:540:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:percent of the crimes considered, and yields a p-value of 0.0720.  Excluding larceny theft, which is
16:509:43871:21:20:72:540:198:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:often considered a misdemeanor offense, our estimates indicate that a SAT facility reduces finan-
16:510:43968:20:20:72:540:178:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cially motivated crimes by 0.08 percent (p-value = 0.0214).  Finally and similar to our approach to
16:511:44067:20:21:72:540:158:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:violent crimes, we consider the log of the social costs of financially motivated crimes as a dependent
16:512:44169:21:15:72:540:137:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:variable.  These estimates indicate that an additional SAT facility reduces social costs attributed
16:513:44268:15:15:80:539:122:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:28In Appendix Table A2, we show results that use a social cost of simple assault set at varying fractions of the
16:514:44380:15:7:72:470:107:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:social cost of aggravated assault.  Appendix Table A1 shows the corresponding summary statistics.
16:515:44477:7:15:80:539:100:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:29This calculation is based on average annual social costs of violent crime totaling $1,273,156 per 1,000 people each
16:516:44594:15:50:72:417:85:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:year in the average agency jurisdiction and an average population covered of 321,685.

17:519:44781:21:35:72:486:688:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:approximate annual $60,000 decline in the social costs of financially motivate crimes.30

17:521:44909:28:20:72:540:625:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The  estimates  in  Tables  5  and  6  provide  evidence  that  county-level  expansions  in  treatment  fa-
17:522:45017:20:20:72:540:605:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cilities significantly reduce both violent and financially motivated crimes and that the effects are
17:523:45117:20:21:72:540:585:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:concentrated among more serious types of these crimes.  In Table 7 we present estimates that pool
17:524:45214:21:20:72:540:564:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:violent and financially motivated crimes together so that the estimates reflect the effects on overall
17:525:45316:20:20:72:540:544:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:crime.  The first panel shows the effect of SAT facilities on all crime including the less serious crimes
17:526:45421:20:21:72:540:524:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of simple assault and larceny, which account for 68 percent of all crimes considered.  The estimates
17:527:45521:21:20:72:540:503:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:suggest a marginally significant 0.004 percent decline in crime associated with an additional SAT
17:528:45618:20:20:72:540:483:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:facility.  Considering all felony-type crimes in the second panel, which excludes simple assault and
17:529:45718:20:21:72:540:463:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:larceny, the estimates indicate an effect of 0.010 percent.  In the third panel, we report the estimated
17:530:45822:21:20:72:540:442:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:effects on the log of the social costs of crime, which weights each crime by its estimated social cost
17:531:45924:20:20:72:540:422:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:estimate as before.  These estimates indicate that an additional SAT facility reduces social costs
17:532:46022:20:36:72:534:402:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:attributed to all crime by 0.14 percent annually, which corresponds to approximately $700,000.31

17:534:46164:28:20:71:539:338:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:As discussed in Section 4, the main threat to the validity of our empirical strategy is the possibility
17:535:46267:20:21:71:539:318:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that  changes  in  the  number  of  facilities  in  an  area  might  be  driven  by  trends  in  the  outcomes
17:536:46377:21:20:71:539:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:we consider (or the correlates thereof) and/or recent shocks to the outcomes we consider (or the
17:537:46473:20:20:71:539:277:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:correlates thereof).  To the degree to which such trends and/or shocks occur at the state level or
17:538:46571:20:20:71:539:257:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:relate to changing demographics, economic conditions, or the size of police forces, they should be
17:539:46669:20:21:71:539:237:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:captured by state-year fixed effects and the control variables included in our analysis.  As this is
17:540:46769:21:20:71:539:216:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:fundamentally untestable, we propose a test of the validity of our identification strategy based on

17:544:47091:20:17:89:539:135:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We also expand on Eq.  (1) to consider contemporaneous versus lagged measures of SAT fa-

18:550:47690:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:year as our main variable of interest, a choice we made to avoid attenuation bias that would likely
18:551:47789:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:be caused by the fact that newly opened (or closed) facilities would only affect counties for some
18:552:47887:20:21:72:167:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:fraction of the year.
18:553:47908:21:20:90:540:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Table 8 shows estimates of this type for all of the outcomes considered across Tables 2 through
18:554:48003:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:7.  Specifically,  it shows estimates based on our richest model while additionally considering the
18:555:48102:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:number of facilities in the current year and in the future year.  Across the 24 outcomes we consider,
18:556:48203:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the estimated effects of the number of facilities one year in the future isneverstatistically significant.
18:557:48309:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We interpret these results as evidence that reverse causality, or the possibility that changes in the
18:558:48410:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:number of SAT facilities may be driven by recent changes in drug abuse and related outcomes, is
18:559:48505:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:not a major concern.  As such, these results provide support for a causal interpretation of our main
18:560:48605:20:20:72:106:485:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:results.
18:561:48613:20:21:90:540:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:These results also provide support for our focus on the lagged measure of facilities. In particular,
18:562:48713:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:where we see significant effects on outcomes, it is always the case that the number of treatment
18:563:48809:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:facilities in the prior year has a stronger effect than the number of treatment facilities in a given
18:564:48910:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:year.  Moreover, the estimated effects of the number of treatment facilities in the current year is
18:565:49009:21:20:72:239:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:usually not statistically significant.
18:566:49047:20:20:90:540:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Further results along these lines are presented in Appendix Tables A3 through A8.  In these
18:567:49138:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tables,  we  reproduce  our  main  estimates  in  Column  1  for  ease  of  comparison;  in  Column  2  we
18:568:49244:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:simultaneously consider the estimated effects of the number of SAT facilities in the preceding two
18:569:49342:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:years on current year outcomes; in Column 3 we simultaneously consider the estimated effects of
18:570:49437:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the number of SAT facilities in the current year and the prior year on current year outcomes; and
18:571:49534:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in Column 4, we simultaneously consider the estimated effects of the number of SAT facilities in
18:572:49630:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the  prior  year,  current  year,  and  one  year  in  the  future,  on  current  year  outcomes  (as  in  Table
18:573:49742:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:8).  The results of these analyses lead to the same conclusions as before.  We also note that they
18:574:49840:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sometimes indicate that the number of facilities two years prior is more strongly related to current
18:575:49940:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:year outcomes than the number of facilities on year prior, which suggests an important avenue for
18:576:50037:20:36:72:538:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:future work in exploring the effects of SAT facilities over time through alternative methodologies.

18:578:50173:28:20:72:540:96:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:As an additional test of the robustness of our estimates, in Table 9 we show the estimated effects for
18:579:50275:20:0:72:540:76:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:each outcome based on the subset of areas for which the log outcome rate can be defined in each year
19:580:50377:0:21:72:539:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:without adding one.32For nearly all of the outcomes we consider, these estimates are virtually the
19:581:50475:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:same in both statistical and economic significance.  The one exception is the homicide rate estimates
19:582:50576:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by  victim-offender  relationship.   For  these  outcomes,  this  approach  produces  estimated  effects
19:583:50680:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that  are  larger  in  magnitude  for  homicides  in  which  the  relationship  is  unknown  and  homicides
19:584:50787:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:committed by friends.  As before, these are statistically significant while the estimated effects on
19:585:50887:20:43:72:377:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:homicides committed by strangers and family members are not.
19:586:50947:43:32:72:284:564:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:6    Discussion and Conclusion
19:587:50977:32:20:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In  the  preceding  sections,  we  document  statistically  and  economically  significant  effects  of  SAT
19:588:51085:20:20:72:540:512:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:facilities  on  drug-related  mortality  and  on  several  categories  of  crime.   The  updated  estimates
19:589:51192:20:21:72:540:492:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:we provide for the effects on county-level drug-related mortality suggest that an additional SAT
19:590:51288:21:20:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:facility reduces drug-related mortality by 0.50 percent annually.  Based on a value of 7 to 8 million
19:591:51389:20:20:72:540:451:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:dollars  per  expected  life  saved,  the  estimate  implies  a  decline  in  a  county’s  annual  drug-related
19:592:51500:20:20:72:540:431:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:mortality costs by 4.2 to 4.8 million dollars.33,34Our estimates of the effects on agency-level crime
19:593:51601:20:21:72:540:411:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:indicate that an additional facility in a county reduces municipal felony-type crimes by 0.10 percent
19:594:51702:21:20:72:540:390:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:annually.  In conjunction with social-cost-of-crime estimates from McCollister,  French,  and Fang
19:595:51800:20:20:72:540:370:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(2010), our estimates indicate that an additional SAT facility in a county reduces municipal crime
19:596:51898:20:21:72:540:350:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:costs  by  0.14  percent  annually,  which  corresponds  to  approximately  $700,000  per  municipality.
19:597:52002:21:20:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Given an average of 6 municipal governments in each county, this suggests a decline in annual costs
19:598:52101:20:20:72:540:309:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of  county-level  crime  by  approximately  4.2  million  dollars  for  each  additional  facility.   In  total,
19:599:52213:20:21:72:540:289:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:these cost calculations suggest that the county-level benefits of an additional facility—in terms of
19:600:52313:21:20:72:472:268:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:drug-related mortality and criminal activity—are between 8.4 and 9 million dollars.
19:601:52396:20:20:90:540:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To compare these benefits to the annual costs of treatment at each facility,  we can consider
19:602:52489:20:21:72:540:228:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the average number of annual treatment admissions (255) from the National Survey of Substance
19:603:52582:21:20:72:540:207:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS), and treatment modality-specific cost estimates from French,
19:604:52677:20:17:72:540:187:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Popovici, and Tapsell (2008).35A back-of-the-envelope calculation indicates that the annual costs
19:605:52774:17:14:80:539:170:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:32As such, the set of areas contributing to the estimates varies across outcomes, with fewer areas contributing to
19:606:52888:14:8:72:314:156:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:the estimates focusing on rarer outcomes such as homicides.
19:607:52947:8:14:80:539:148:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:33This estimate is based on 10.9 drug-related deaths per 100,000 and an an average weighted county population of
19:608:53059:14:7:72:122:134:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:1.09 million.

19:610:53205:15:11:72:540:112:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:regulation cost-benefit analyses, which is consistent with median VSL estimates from meta analysis of existing VSL
19:611:53319:11:7:72:210:101:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:research (Viscusi and Aldy, 2003).
19:612:53353:7:15:80:539:94:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:35Estimates from French, Popovici, and Tapsell (2008) include all treatment delivery costs related to personnel,
19:613:53465:15:44:72:492:79:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:supplies and materials, contracted services, buildings and facilities, equipment, and miscellaneous items.

20:616:53671:21:20:72:523:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that the benefits of expanding treatment facilities far outweigh the associated treatment costs.
20:617:53767:20:20:90:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:While our data do not allow us to establish a direct link between substance-abuse treatment
20:618:53858:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and incidents, the results of our analyses provide support for the idea that there are broad-based
20:619:53956:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:benefits  of  SAT  facilities  in  terms  of  public  safety.   This  evidence  is  in  contrast  to  not-in-my-
20:620:54068:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:backyard  arguments  that  have  been  used  to  hinder  attempts  to  expand  access  to  SAT  through
20:621:54171:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:additional facilities.  That said, an important limitation of our research design is that it identifies
20:622:54274:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:effects of having an additional SAT facilityin the county, which could mask heterogeneous effects
20:623:54371:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for areas in a county that are nearer versus farther from such a facility.  Assessing whether such
20:624:54469:20:407:72:449:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:heterogeneity exists would seem to be an important avenue for future research.
20:625:54547:407:15:80:539:119:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:36We use the annual number of treatment admissions reported in Swensen (2015) based on the 2002-2008 N-SSATS
20:626:54655:15:11:72:540:104:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:data.  More recent N-SSATS data do not include treatment admissions information.  To calculate the total cost of
20:627:54767:11:10:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:treatment  at  a  SAT  facility,  we  use  the median  of  the cost  bands  reported  for  each  modality  in French  Popovici,
20:628:54894:10:11:72:540:83:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:and Tapsell weighted by the proportion of total admissions accounted for by each modality as reported in the 2013
