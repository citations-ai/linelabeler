2:24:1037:33:21:108:538:562:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The endogeneity of exchange rates and intervention has long plagued studies of the effectiveness
2:25:1133:21:22:72:539:541:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of central banks actions in foreign exchange markets. Researchers have either excluded contemporaneous
2:26:1235:22:21:72:538:519:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:intervention, so that their explanators are predetermined, or obtained a small, and typically incorrectly
2:27:1340:21:21:72:539:498:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:signed, coefficient on contemporaneous intervention. Failing to account for the endogeneity, when central
2:28:1445:21:21:72:537:477:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:banks lean against the wind and trade strategically, will likely result in a large downward bias to the
2:29:1548:21:22:72:539:456:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:coefficient on contemporaneous intervention -- explaining the negative coefficient frequently obtained.
2:30:1651:22:21:108:539:434:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:We  use  an  alternative  identification  assumption,  a  change  in  Reserve  Bank  of  Australia
2:31:1749:21:21:72:538:413:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:intervention  policy,  that  allows  us  to  estimate,  using  simulated  GMM,  a  model  that  includes  the
2:32:1858:21:21:72:538:392:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:contemporaneous impact of intervention. There are three main results. Our point estimates suggest that
2:33:1960:21:22:72:539:371:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:central bank intervention has a economically significant contemporaneous effect. A $US100m purchase
2:34:2059:22:21:72:538:349:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of the domestic currency will appreciate the exchange rate by 1.35 to 1.81 per cent. This estimate is
2:35:2160:21:21:72:538:328:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:remarkably similar to the calibration conducted by Dominguez and Frankel (1993), who themselves noted
2:36:2261:21:21:72:538:307:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:their estimate was larger than previous empirical findings. Secondly, the vast majority of the effect of an
2:37:2368:21:21:72:538:286:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:intervention on the exchange rate is found to occur during the day in which it is conducted, with only a
2:38:2472:21:22:72:538:265:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:smaller impact on subsequent days. Finally, we confirm findings that Australian central bank intervention
2:39:2577:22:71:72:322:243:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:policy can be characterized by leaning aginst the wind.

3:46:2797:0:25:72:201:673:207:g_d0_f4:207:g_d0_f4:1Introduction
3:47:2810:25:15:72:562:648:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Since the introduction offloating exchange rates the use, and efficacy,ofinterventionintheforeignexchange
3:48:2915:15:15:72:558:633:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:market has been a controversial topic. Most central banks have at times engaged in frequent intervention, and at
3:49:3027:15:15:72:557:618:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:other times followed a more laissez faire approach to the exchange rate.1No doubt the observed disparate range
3:50:3137:15:15:72:558:603:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:of policies between central banks, and within individual central banks over time, can in part be attributed to
3:51:3247:15:15:72:558:588:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:thelackofaccordontheeffectiveness and consequencesof central bank intervention. Two key questions remain
3:52:3351:15:15:72:557:573:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:unresolved: how effective is foreign exchange intervention, and, if it is effective, through which channel does it
3:53:3465:15:15:72:90:558:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:act?
3:54:3469:15:15:87:558:543:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:A critical barrier to answering these questions has beenovercoming the endogeneity of changes in the exchange
3:55:3578:15:15:72:558:528:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:rate and intervention. The central hypothesis is that intervention changes the exchange rate. But at the same
3:56:3687:15:15:72:558:513:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:time, the decision to intervene is not independent of the movements in the exchange rate. Moreover, even once
3:57:3796:15:15:72:558:498:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:a central bank has decided to intervene, the quantity of currency it buys or sells will typically depend on the
3:58:3907:15:14:72:263:483:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:responseoftheexchangeratetoitstrades.
3:59:3944:14:15:87:557:469:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:The literature has typically dealt with the simultaneous equations problem by assuming that the contempo-
3:60:4049:15:15:72:557:454:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:raneous decision of the central bank is independent of the current innovations to the exchange rate. This is a
3:61:4159:15:15:72:558:439:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:strong assumption. For example, it assumes that the central bank does not change its selling or buying behavior
3:62:4270:15:15:72:558:424:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:by assessing the impact its actions have had on the exchange rate. On the other hand, there is strong evidence
3:63:4380:15:15:72:558:409:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:in stock markets that big players indeed act strategically when they are unwinding large positions. Therefore,
3:64:4490:15:15:72:400:394:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:why should we expect the same behavior is not optimal for a central bank?
3:65:4563:15:15:87:558:379:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:In this paper we use an alternative identification method to solve the problem of simultaneous equations.
3:66:4668:15:15:72:558:364:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:We use daily Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) interventions data over the period 1986 to 1993, which contains
3:67:4776:15:15:72:558:349:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:a dramatic change in intervention policy that we use for identification. We show that the estimates we obtain
3:68:4885:15:15:72:557:334:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:have the correct sign and are significantly larger than those found with more standard methods. This is exactly
3:69:4996:15:15:72:558:319:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:the direction we would have expected if endogenous variables is an important source of the bias. Further, the
3:70:5105:15:15:72:557:304:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:vast majority of the effect of an intervention on the exchange rate is found to occur during the day in which it
3:71:5217:15:15:72:558:289:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:is conducted with a smaller impact on subsequent days. This explains why small effects are usually found when
3:72:5326:15:15:72:558:274:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:lag values are used in the typical OLS specifications. The major contribution of this paper is to provide some
3:73:5436:15:15:72:558:259:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:evidence on the contemporaneous effectiveness of intervention. Although, our methodology does not indicate the
3:74:5546:15:15:72:558:244:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:channels through which intervention operates, it provides an improvement from previous estimates obtained in
3:75:5654:15:15:72:132:229:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:the literature.
3:76:5669:15:15:87:558:214:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:We concentrate our analysis on sterilized interventions, but we do not distinguish between secret and public
3:77:5777:15:14:72:558:199:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:interventions. While undoubtedly this is an important distinction, most and in particular the largest, interven-
3:78:5889:14:15:72:558:185:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:tions are public. Certainly, future research should reconsider this issue. In this paper the focus of our attention is
3:79:6007:15:15:72:558:170:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:the estimation problem. Indeed, we think that the simultaneous equations problem is the crucial aspect limiting
3:80:6118:15:15:72:264:155:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:our understanding of how effective policy is.
3:81:6163:15:15:87:558:140:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:The identification assumption we use is based on the fact that the RBA (in 1991) decided to change their
3:82:6267:15:24:72:558:125:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:policy regarding foreign exchange rate interventions. We interpret this shift in policy as exogenous, which is
3:83:6377:24:12:83:558:101:36:g_d0_f5:65:g_d0_f5:1Schwartz (2000) suggests that intervention is a dying practice despite the continued use of active intervention by the ECB and
3:84:6504:12:10:72:557:89:65:g_d0_f5:65:g_d0_f5:Bank of Japan. However, the 18 central banks that responded to a survey reported in Neely (2001) believe it affects the exchange
3:85:6632:10:0:72:558:79:65:g_d0_f5:65:g_d0_f5:rate. Traders’ survey responses in Cheung and Wong (2000) indicate they also believe intervention has an effect on exchange rates.
4:86:6763:0:15:72:558:673:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:an important ingredient in our solution to the problem. Other countries have also changed “exogenously” their
4:87:6872:15:15:72:558:658:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:policies, but typically central banks endogenously respond to the conditions in the market. Again, future research
4:88:6986:15:15:72:557:643:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:should endogenize the policy decision and extend the present analysis to deal with more general framework.
4:89:7092:15:15:72:558:628:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:However, as is argued in the text below it is the case that the Australian central bank decision to change their
4:90:7204:15:15:72:327:613:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:method of intervention is unrelated to other macro events.
4:91:7262:15:15:87:558:598:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:The paper proceeds as follows. There is a brief discussion, in Section II, of central bank intervention and the
4:92:7373:15:15:72:557:583:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:associated literature. A description of the data and discussion of RBA intervention follow this, in Section III.
4:93:7485:15:15:72:558:568:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Section IV presents the estimation method used in this study. The results are presented in Section V, followed

4:96:7667:25:15:72:557:491:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:This section briefly reviews the literature on central bank intervention, focussing on the simultaneous relationship
4:97:7783:15:15:72:558:476:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:between, and temporal behavior of, exchange rate returns and intervention. For more general and extensive
4:98:7888:15:15:72:558:461:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:reviews see Sarno and Taylor (2001), Dominguez and Frankel (1993b) and Edison (1993).(Sarno and Taylor,
4:99:7991:15:15:72:159:446:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:2001)(Edison, 1993)
4:100:8010:15:15:87:558:431:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Empirical studies, and statements by central banks, suggest that central banks intervene in foreign exchange
4:101:8118:15:15:72:558:416:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:markets to slow or correct excessive trends in the exchange rate, i.e. they “lean against the wind”, and to calm
4:102:8230:15:15:72:557:401:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:disorderly markets (for example Lewis (1995b) and Baillie and Osterberg (1997b)).2The survey responses of
4:103:8335:15:15:72:558:386:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:central banks in Neely (2001) suggest that these factors continue to drive the decision to intervene. A recent
4:104:8445:15:15:72:557:371:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:study for Australia by Kim and Sheen (2000) has similar conclusions. Importantly, when central banks intervene
4:105:8555:15:15:72:558:356:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:they trade in blocks throughout the day. As Neely (2001) reports, their subsequent trades are conditional on the
4:106:8667:15:15:72:300:341:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:response of the exchange rate to their earlier trades.
4:107:8721:15:14:87:558:326:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Two main channels have been suggested through which sterilized intervention can affect the level of the
4:108:8824:14:15:72:557:312:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:exchange rate: the portfolio balance channel and the signalling channel. Intervention changes the exchange rate
4:109:8935:15:15:72:558:297:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:through the portfolio balance channel if government bonds are imperfect substitutes, and so the change in the
4:110:9044:15:15:72:558:282:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:reserve asset holdings of a central bank results in private investors revaluing their portfolios of domestic and
4:111:9156:15:15:72:557:267:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:foreign assets.3Since interventions are small relative to the stock of outstanding bonds most authors, including
4:112:9268:15:15:72:557:252:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Rogoff(1984), have expressed skepticism that intervention could have a large impact through the portfolio
4:113:9373:15:15:72:558:237:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:balance channel. Not surprisingly, many studies do notfind evidence of this channel, and those that do, such as
4:114:9484:15:15:72:515:222:102:g_d0_f5:50:g_d0_f5:Dominguez and Frankel (1993b), Evans and Lyons (2001) and Ghosh (1992), suggest that it is weak.4
4:115:9581:15:15:87:558:207:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Mussa (1981) suggested that if the central bank uses foreign exchange interventions to credibly indicate
4:116:9685:15:15:72:558:192:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:intended changes in monetary policy, the resulting revaluing of the exchange rate can be described as the signaling
4:117:9800:15:15:72:558:177:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:channel.  The impact of intervention through the signaling channel has often been found to be substantially
4:118:9907:15:15:72:558:162:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:stronger than through the portfolio balance channel (for example Dominguez and Frankel (1993b)). For the
4:119:10011:15:24:72:558:147:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:signalling channel to be an ongoing transmission mechanism central banks should be seen to follow interventions
4:120:10122:24:12:83:558:123:36:g_d0_f5:65:g_d0_f5:2Other reasons occasionally cited by central banks include to target particular exchange rates, or to support other central banks.
4:121:10252:12:9:72:558:111:65:g_d0_f5:65:g_d0_f5:We do not explicitly consider the impact of intervention on conditional exchange rate volatility, see Rogers and Siklos (2001) for
4:122:10382:9:7:72:382:102:65:g_d0_f5:65:g_d0_f5:Australia or more generally Dominguez (1998) and Bonser-Neal and Tanner (1996).
4:123:10461:7:9:83:558:95:36:g_d0_f5:65:g_d0_f5:3The portfolio balance channel requires not only that bonds are imperfect substitutes, but also the failure of Ricardian equivalence.
4:124:10594:9:13:83:558:86:36:g_d0_f5:65:g_d0_f5:4Dominguez and Frankel (1993c) and Evans and Lyons (2001) both assess the portfolio balance channel for unsterilized intervention
4:125:10723:13:0:72:362:73:65:g_d0_f5:65:g_d0_f5:and so provide upperbound estimates for the impact of sterilized intervention.
5:126:10802:0:15:72:558:673:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:with appropriate changes in monetary policy. As a result intervention operating through the signaling channel
5:127:10911:15:15:72:558:658:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:does not constitute an independent policy tool. Despite the evidence of a signaling channel, Fatum and Hutchison
5:128:11023:15:15:72:558:643:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:(1999) are unable tofind an explicit link between intervention and future monetary policy, while Lewis (1995b)
5:129:11133:15:15:72:456:628:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:and Kaminsky and Lewis (1996) suggest it occasionally operates in the wrong direction.
5:130:11219:15:15:87:558:613:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Most central banks do not publicly announce their interventions.5In light of the evidence for a signaling
5:131:11324:15:15:72:558:598:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:channel many authors have questioned this policy.6But interventions are not completely secret. Dominguez
5:132:11428:15:15:72:558:583:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:and Frankel (1993b)find that most, and particularly the largest, interventions are reported. Central banks can
5:133:11538:15:15:72:558:568:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:choose the method of intervention, ranging from direct trades with commercial banks, to indirect trades through
5:134:11649:15:15:72:317:553:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:brokers, to control the degree of secrecy of their actions.
5:135:11708:15:15:87:558:538:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:If intervention operates through the signaling channel then the exchange rate should react as soon as traders
5:136:11817:15:15:72:557:523:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:digest the information contained within the intervention. Goodhart and Hesse (1993), Peiers (1997), Dominguez
5:137:11926:15:15:72:558:508:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:(1999) and Chang and Taylor (1998)find that interventions that are intended to be visible are typically reported
5:138:12038:15:15:72:558:493:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:by news services within 10 minutes to 2 hours, by whichtime it is often no longer ’news’ to traders. Any effect
5:139:12149:15:15:72:557:478:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:through the portfolio balance channel is also likely to be rapid as bond holders quickly respond to the change
5:140:12259:15:15:72:558:463:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:in the relative supplies in the highly liquid market for government securities. Indeed, Neely (2001) reports that
5:141:12372:15:15:72:562:448:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:the majority of central banks believe the full effects of intervention are reflectedintheexchangeratewithina

5:143:12496:14:15:87:558:419:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Despite the evidence of the rapid response of the exchange rate to intervention, studies using daily data
5:144:12601:15:15:72:557:404:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:have often abstracted from the endogeneity of intervention and exchange rate determination by only including
5:145:12709:15:15:72:558:389:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:lagged intervention (for example Baillie and Osterberg (1997a) and Lewis (1995b)). While intervention may still
5:146:12820:15:15:72:557:374:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:have an effect on the days subsequent to the initial trades, omitting the contemporaneous intervention prevents
5:147:12931:15:15:72:557:359:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:measurement of the immediate impact and is likely to bias other coefficient estimates. Other studies that include
5:148:13044:15:15:72:557:344:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:contemporaneous intervention, such as Kaminsky and Lewis (1996) and Kim et al (2001), typically obtain an
5:149:13149:15:15:72:557:329:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:incorrectly signed contemporaneous coefficient, suggesting that purchases of the domestic currency cause it
5:150:13256:15:15:72:558:314:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:to depreciate.  Seemingly what they capture is the policy function coefficient that represents central banks’
5:151:13365:15:15:72:558:299:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:tendency to “lean against the wind”.  The insignificant and incorrectly signed coefficients in many previous
5:152:13473:15:15:72:557:284:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:studies indicate that an accurate estimation of the impact of intervention on the exchange rate must incorporate
5:153:13585:15:37:72:445:269:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:the contemporaneous effect, and account for the endogeneity between these variables.

5:155:13715:25:15:72:558:207:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:The estimation in this study uses daily interventions in the foreign exchange market by the RBA over the
5:156:13819:15:15:72:558:192:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:period from July 1986 to November 1993. This period is chosen because it contains a single distinct change
5:157:13925:15:15:72:558:177:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:in intervention policy, in October 1991, that allows us to identify the parameters in our exchange rate and
5:158:14032:15:15:72:558:162:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:intervention system. Additionally, the characteristics of intervention in this sample facilitate accurate estimation.
5:159:14149:15:15:72:558:147:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Over the 7 years of data (1,930 daily observations) intervention is frequent (48 per cent of days) and often large
5:160:14263:15:15:72:558:132:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:(up to $A1.3 billion).  Another advantage of our sampleis that other central banks do not intervene in the
5:161:14369:15:23:72:425:117:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:USD/AUD market and so we need only focus on the actions of one central bank.
5:162:14445:23:10:83:401:94:36:g_d0_f5:65:g_d0_f5:5One exception is the Swiss National Bank as noted by Fischer and Zurlinden (1999).
5:163:14528:10:12:83:558:84:36:g_d0_f5:65:g_d0_f5:6Alternatively, Bhattacharya and Weller (1997) and Vitale (1999) develop models of intervention that rationalize secrecy about
5:164:14654:12:0:72:122:72:65:g_d0_f5:65:g_d0_f5:interventions.
6:165:14669:0:15:87:558:673:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:The data are the daily net purchases of Australian dollars by the RBA and include all transactions made by
6:166:14775:15:15:72:558:658:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:the RBA, including those on behalf of the Government. Since the RBA can, and does, meet the Government’s
6:167:14879:15:15:72:558:643:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:demand for foreign currency transactions from its own reserves, it has discretion as to the timing of transactions
6:168:14993:15:15:72:558:628:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:on behalf of the Government. For this reason the inability to exclude transactions on behalf of the Government
6:169:15103:15:15:72:557:613:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:does not appear to be problematic. Similarly, Neely (1998) argues that not excluding client transactions for the
6:170:15215:15:15:72:558:598:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Fed has little influence. Over the sample used, almost all RBA intervention were conducted in the spot market
6:171:15324:15:15:72:557:583:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:verses the US dollar (Andrew and Broadbent (1994)).7Rankin (1998) reports that the RBA has always sterilized
6:172:15432:15:15:72:148:568:102:g_d0_f5:50:g_d0_f5:its interventions.8
6:173:15451:15:15:87:558:553:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:The exchange rate is measured as the US dollar value of an Australian dollar (USD/AUD). The intervention
6:174:15555:15:15:72:558:538:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:and exchange rate returns data are aligned to cover exactly the same 24-hour period, commencing at 9am Sydney
6:175:15664:15:15:72:558:523:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:time.  This avoids inaccurate results from using misaligned data, which have potentially hampered previous
6:176:15770:15:15:72:558:508:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:studies on central bank intervention.  Aligning the intervention and exchange rate returns data is important
6:177:15878:15:15:72:558:493:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:since central banks can, and do, intervene outside their business hours, as shown in Dominguez (1999), and
6:178:15984:15:15:72:558:478:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:stated for the RBA by Rankin (1998).9The 24-hour period over which the data are measured will be referred
6:179:16089:15:14:72:558:463:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:to as a day. The intervention data for any given day will include transactions conducted in any of the major
6:180:16197:14:15:72:288:449:102:g_d0_f5:50:g_d0_f5:markets around the world on that calendar day.10
6:181:16245:15:15:87:557:434:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Rankin (1998) outlinesfive distinct periods of intervention policy used by the RBA since thefloat of the
6:182:16349:15:15:72:558:419:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Australian dollar in December 1983. Table 1 summarizes the pattern of intervention over thesefive episodes.
6:183:16456:15:15:72:557:404:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:The two periods used in this study are the second and third. During the period immediately following thefloat of
6:184:16568:15:15:72:560:389:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:the Australian dollar, December 1983 to June 1986, the RBA allowed the dollar tofloatfreelywithonlyverysmall
6:185:16676:15:15:72:557:374:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:interventions. Our study commences using data fromJuly 1986 when the RBA took on a distinctly proactive
6:186:16779:15:15:72:558:359:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:policy to foreign exchange market intervention. Interventions became more frequent (the RBA was active on
6:187:16884:15:15:72:558:344:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:69 per cent of days) and substantially larger (the average absolute intervention was $A63 million). The change
6:188:16994:15:15:72:558:329:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:in policy in our sample occurs in October 1991 when the RBA all but ceased to make very small interventions.
6:189:17102:15:15:72:558:314:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Large interventions continued to be used as in the preceding era as seen in Figure 1. As a result, the frequency
6:190:17214:15:15:72:558:299:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:of interventions was drastically reduced (to 24 per cent of days), and the average size of interventions increased
6:191:17328:15:15:72:558:284:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:substantially (to $A144 million). We do not consider the last two episodes when the RBA did not intervene from
6:192:17438:15:25:72:397:269:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:December 1995 to June 1995, or when interventions resumed in July 1995.

6:197:17757:14:24:72:558:175:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:1980s to the end of the 1990s, the RBA intervened on 42 per cent of days, compared to between 4 and 12.5 per
6:198:17865:24:13:83:558:151:36:g_d0_f5:65:g_d0_f5:7Over the past decade the RBA has moved to using a combination of spot maket transactions and currency swaps, which together
6:199:17989:13:9:72:86:138:65:g_d0_f5:36:g_d0_f5:replicate a forward, to intervene and sterilize their intervention (see Rankin (1998)).8
6:200:18077:9:10:87:558:129:65:g_d0_f5:65:g_d0_f5:Dominguez and Frankel (1993b) and the references contained therein, suggest the Fed, Bundesbank and Bank of Japan have
6:201:18195:10:9:72:86:119:65:g_d0_f5:36:g_d0_f5:typically only partially sterilized their interventions.9
6:202:18252:9:9:87:558:110:65:g_d0_f5:65:g_d0_f5:Given Australian trading hours do not overlap with either London or New York trading hours, and BIS (1993) shows one-quarter

7:208:18887:15:15:72:558:658:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:in foreign exchange markets. The daily turnover in the USD/AUD market was estimated to be $US17.9 billion
7:209:18992:15:15:72:558:643:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:in 1992 by BIS (1993), although only $US4.8 billion of this involved a non-financial counterparty .11While the

7:211:19209:15:15:72:558:613:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:heavily traded than all three other currencies in Table 2, the RBA interventions are of a comparable size to those
7:212:19323:15:15:72:557:598:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:of the larger central banks.12The large magnitude of some RBA interventions is also confirmed by comparing
7:213:19429:15:15:72:558:583:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:the maximum interventions to the money base and M1 in Table 1. In the two episodes considered in this study,
7:214:19537:15:15:72:558:568:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:the largest intervention is seen to be over 5 per cent of the money base, or 2 per cent of M1. Note that while the
7:215:19651:15:15:72:558:553:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:turnover in the foreign exchange market has increased substantially, and certainly did so through our sample,
7:216:19760:15:25:72:461:538:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:neither of the hypothesized transmission channels are affected by the volume of turnover.

7:220:19945:24:15:72:558:429:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:In this section we use a simple model of central bank intervention to highlight the limitations of the standard

7:245:20761:15:15:72:558:234:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:relative supplies of domestic and foreign bonds changes so that the risk premium on domestic assets, which is
7:246:20870:15:14:72:557:219:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:part ofηt, changes. This is then seen to affect the current exchange rate. The signalling channel suggests that
7:247:20981:14:15:72:558:205:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:interventions are a commitment to future monetary policy and so represent a change in the expected future

7:249:21194:15:15:72:333:175:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:a function of contemporaneous intervention,et=et(INTt).
7:250:21249:15:15:87:558:160:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:As noted earlier, central banks typically state that they intervene to slow or correct excessive trends in the
7:251:21359:15:24:72:558:145:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:exchange rate and to calm disorderly markets. Indeed, the governor of the RBA states that the RBA has used

7:253:21591:10:12:79:558:111:36:g_d0_f5:65:g_d0_f5:12The BIS survey lists the USD/AUD currency pair as the 9th most traded.  The average daily turnover for the USD/DEM,
7:254:21708:12:9:72:557:99:65:g_d0_f5:65:g_d0_f5:USD/JPY and USD/CHF were $US192.2b, $US154.8b, and $US48.8b. Only considering trades with non-financial counterparties
7:255:21826:9:10:72:557:90:65:g_d0_f5:65:g_d0_f5:the USD/AUD was thefifth most traded currency pair with the three pairs mentioned before respectively $US26.9b, $US32.3b,

8:259:22173:15:15:72:558:643:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:RBA sterilizes interventions, and is acknowledged to allow the Australian dollar tofloat quite freely, it seems
8:260:22284:15:15:72:558:628:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:reasonable to assume that intervention is not used as a separate policy tool with independent goals. Rather,
8:261:22392:15:15:72:558:613:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:intervention is focused on exchange rate outcomes. A simple representation of this policy, as used in Almekinders
8:262:22505:15:15:72:558:598:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:and Eijffinger (1996), is that the central bank’s preferred level of intervention, or shadow intervention,INT∗,
8:263:22616:15:27:72:415:583:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:would minimize squared deviations of the exchange rate from a moving target.

8:265:22712:28:15:72:558:528:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Given the central bank is allowing the exchange rate tofloat, but doesn’t want it to move ’too quickly’, the

8:279:23015:34:15:87:558:412:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:However, central banks do not intervene on every day, and very small interventions are extremely rare.
8:280:23117:15:15:72:557:397:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Presumably there are some costs to intervention, possibly because the strength of signals is reduced if they
8:281:23225:15:15:72:558:382:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:are used too frequently. As a result the central bank only intervenes if the loss function would exceed some
8:282:23333:15:15:72:558:367:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:benchmark, or equivalently if the shadow intervention exceeds a given threshold, otherwise remaining absent

8:291:23662:32:21:72:286:251:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:4.1  Setup of the estimation system
8:292:23697:21:15:72:561:230:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:We generalize the previous framework to include unobservable variables that affecttheexchangerateandthe
8:293:23800:15:15:72:558:215:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:central bank’s decision for intervention. The reason behind this extension is that we believe that there are factors
8:294:23916:15:15:72:558:200:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:that are unobservable at daily frequencies that have impact on both variables, such as liquidity shocks, macro
8:295:24026:15:27:72:208:185:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:shocks, etc. The model used is:

9:305:24337:0:15:72:557:673:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:estimation procedure includes constants and potentially lags, but this simple version is sufficient to demonstrate
9:306:24451:15:15:72:182:658:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:the endogeneity problem.
9:307:24475:15:15:87:558:643:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Equation (7) is the reaction of the exchange rate to the central bank intervention.  We assume that the
9:308:24578:15:15:72:558:628:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:exchange rate is affected by two types of shocks:εtwhich is a pure idiosyncratic shock to the exchange rate,
9:309:24686:15:15:72:557:613:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:which we assume has no direct impact on the intervention decision, and a common shock (zt) which is assumed
9:310:24793:15:15:72:558:598:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:to move both the exchange rate and the central bank intervention decision. We explore the interpretation of
9:311:24900:15:15:72:157:583:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:these shocks below.
9:312:24919:15:15:87:558:568:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Equation (8) is the decision of the central bank to intervene or not. We assume that this decision is made
9:313:25025:15:15:72:558:553:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:entirely based on the shadow intervention. In other words, if the required intervention is large (larger in absolute
9:314:25141:15:15:72:558:538:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:terms than some thresholdINT) then the central bank participates in the market, otherwise, it remains absent.
9:315:25250:15:15:72:558:523:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Observe that implicitly we assume that if the shadow intervention is larger than the threshold then the central
9:316:25361:15:15:72:349:508:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:bank intervenes, and its intervention is exactly the shadow one.
9:317:25425:15:15:87:557:493:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Equation (9) determines the shadow intervention. We assume that it is affected by the movements in the
9:318:25527:15:15:72:557:478:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:exchange rate, by the aggregate or common shock, and by some idiosyncratic shock reflecting innovations to
9:319:25633:15:15:72:557:463:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:exchange rate policy. If the central bank aims to offset changes in the exchange rate, i.e. lean against the wind,
9:320:25747:15:15:72:558:448:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:thenβwill be negative. Equations (8) and (9) together constitute the central bank’s reaction function; where
9:321:25855:15:14:72:551:433:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:the former reflects the decision to intervene, and the later one determines the quantity, or size of intervention.
9:322:25969:14:15:87:558:419:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:The policy shock (ηt) is interpreted as innovations in the exchange rate target that are independent of the
9:323:26076:15:15:72:558:404:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:nominal exchange rate shocks (εt) and the common shock (zt). The idea is to separate idiosyncratic shocks to
9:324:26184:15:15:72:558:389:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:policy (such as trades on behalf of the government or unwinding of positions) and to the exchange rate (for
9:325:26291:15:15:72:557:374:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:example, economic fundamentals) from those shocks that we might expect to affect both variables (such as
9:326:26395:15:15:72:558:359:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:herding, liquidity, or shocks to the exchange rate during periods of high conditional volatility). These common
9:327:26506:15:15:72:558:344:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:shocks will affect how intervention takes place, and the exchange rate at the same time. We assume that these
9:328:26615:15:15:72:557:329:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:shocks are i.i.d., with mean zero and variancesσε,ση,andσz. For simplicity in the exposition we have assumed
9:329:26723:15:15:72:557:314:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:that all the variables have zero mean, but in the empiricalimplementation it is important to include constants.
9:330:26834:15:15:87:558:299:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Finally, the parameter of interest isα. If central bank intervention is effective, then purchases of the domestic
9:331:26947:15:15:72:347:284:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:currency will appreciate the currency and soαwill be positive.
9:332:27009:15:15:87:558:269:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:The intuition for this model is that the central bank leans against the wind, soβ<0, either to slow deviations
9:333:27119:15:15:72:558:254:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:from trend, or to calm volatile markets. Small changes are tolerable and so the central bank does not bother
9:334:27227:15:15:72:558:239:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:intervening. On the other hand, if exchange rate returns would otherwise be large, larger interventions would
9:335:27336:15:15:72:558:224:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:be required to counteract these and will cause the central bank to enter the market. The shadow intervention
9:336:27444:15:15:72:557:209:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:(INT∗t) summarizes the expected intervention if the central bank were to trade continuously in the foreign
9:337:27550:15:15:72:168:194:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:exchange rate market.
9:338:27571:15:14:87:557:179:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:This simple framework captures the two sources of simultaneity that exist in the data.  Thefirst one, is
9:339:27675:14:15:72:558:165:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:the endogenous decision of participation. The second one, is the size of the intervention and the change in the
9:340:27786:15:15:72:557:150:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:exchange rate once the decision of participation has been made. While thefirst source of bias has been widely
9:341:27895:15:15:72:558:135:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:acknowledged in the literature, the second has received very little attention. This is understandable. Finding
9:342:28005:15:15:72:557:120:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:instruments for thefirst one is hard, but some might be available. For the second one, this is much more difficult.
9:343:28120:15:15:87:558:105:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:In this model there does not exist an instrument that can be used to solve the problem of simultaneous
9:344:28222:15:15:72:557:90:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:equations.  More importantly, this bias is likely to be negative, pushing the estimate ofαin equation (7)
9:345:28327:15:0:72:436:75:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:downward, possibly even negative, explaining most of the results found in the data.
10:346:28411:0:15:87:558:673:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:It is important to mention that there are several aspects of central bank intervention that have been oversim-
10:347:28521:15:15:72:558:658:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:plified in this model. First, there is no distinction between public and secret interventions. As was mentioned
10:348:28632:15:15:72:558:643:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:before, this has received considerable attention in the literature. In this paper we focus on the estimation prob-
10:349:28746:15:15:72:558:628:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:lem. Second, we do not attempt to distinguish between sterilized and unsterilized interventions as the RBA
10:350:28852:15:32:72:279:613:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:states that all of its interventions are sterilized.

10:352:28963:21:15:72:557:560:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:The problem of identification is easily shown by counting the number of unknowns, and the number of series
10:353:29069:15:15:72:558:545:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:we can measure, in the model. Under the assumption that we only observe the exchange rate, the size of the
10:354:29175:15:15:72:558:530:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:intervention, and its timing, then, aside from the means, we can compute onlyfive moments from the data: the
10:355:29283:15:15:72:558:515:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:probability (or frequency) of intervention, the varianceof the exchange rate when there is no intervention, and
10:356:29394:15:15:72:558:500:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:the covariance matrix when an intervention has taken place. However, in the model there are seven unknown
10:357:29499:15:15:72:557:485:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:coefficients that explain the behavior of such variables: the parameters of interest (α,β,andγ), the threshold
10:358:29609:15:15:72:358:470:102:g_d0_f5:50:g_d0_f5:of intervention (INT) and the three variances (σε,ση,andσz).13
10:359:29671:15:14:87:558:455:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:The standard procedures in the literature use the following assumptions. First, that there are good instru-
10:360:29778:14:15:72:558:441:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:ments for the participation decision. Second, that eitherβ=0orα=0(exclusion restrictions). And third, that
10:361:29884:15:15:72:558:426:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:the instrument is correlated withηtbut not withzt. This set of assumptions seems rather strong. Central banks
10:362:29993:15:15:72:557:411:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:no doubt intervene based on their most recent information set, which includes the change in the exchange rate
10:363:30102:15:15:72:558:396:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:during the day. Further, the fact that central banks know they have market power, which is the whole rationale
10:364:30212:15:15:72:558:381:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:why they think it is worth intervening in thefirst place, collides with the assumption thatβis zero. Central
10:365:30320:15:15:72:558:366:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:banks should be, and indeed are, strategic in their interventions. The alternative identification assumption that
10:366:30433:15:15:72:558:351:102:g_d0_f18:102:g_d0_f5:α=0is similarly problematic in that it implies that central bank interventions don’t have any effect on the day
10:367:30544:15:15:72:448:336:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:during which they are conducted. This contradicts significant circumstantial evidence.
10:368:30630:15:15:87:558:321:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:The main contribution of this paper, is to relax these set of assumptions and use an alternative identification
10:369:30741:15:15:72:558:306:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:method that can deal with some of the econometric issues at hand. Obviously, we depend on another set of
10:370:30845:15:15:72:558:291:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:assumptions. We think those are weaker, in the sense that most of them are already imposed in the standard
10:371:30951:15:15:72:557:276:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:literature. But this is certainly thefirst pass at the problem using these alternative methods and further research
10:372:31066:15:15:72:427:261:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:should extend the present procedure. We discuss the caveats in detail at the end.
10:373:31147:15:15:87:557:246:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Our identification procedure is quite simple; in September 1991, the RBA changed its foreign exchange rate
10:374:31253:15:15:72:558:231:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:intervention policy. Following the change, the RBA all but ceased to conduct small interventions but continued
10:375:31363:15:15:72:558:216:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:to undertake larger interventions as before the change. In the model this would be summarized by a shift in
10:376:31470:15:14:72:557:201:102:g_d0_f10:102:g_d0_f5:INT.Effectively, this means that there are two regimes. Under the assumption that the parameters and the
10:377:31574:14:15:72:557:187:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:variance of the shocks remain the same across both regimes, we have only eight unknowns (one more than before
10:378:31683:15:15:72:381:172:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:because we have two thresholds) but at least ten moments in the data.
10:379:31752:15:24:87:335:157:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Specifically, the basic model we estimate is the following:
10:380:31811:24:12:79:558:133:36:g_d0_f5:65:g_d0_f5:13The estimation of means adds the same number of equations and unknowns to the system, thus, the problem of underidentification
10:381:31939:12:0:72:139:121:65:g_d0_f5:65:g_d0_f5:remains the same.

11:399:32188:15:15:87:558:567:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:We estimate this model with, and without, lags and present both results.  When the model is estimated
11:400:32289:15:20:72:302:552:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:without lags, there are eleven parameters of interest:

11:404:32379:8:27:409:412:524:102:g_d0_f10:102:g_d0_f10:.
11:405:32380:27:15:72:558:497:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:We compute the following moments in each of the regimes: the proportion of days with intervention; the mean
11:406:32487:15:15:72:558:482:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:exchange rate return; the mean intervention; the variance of the exchange rate on days with no intervention;
11:407:32595:15:15:72:558:467:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:and, the variance-covariance matrix on days with intervention. Furthermore, we compute the moments related
11:408:32701:15:15:72:558:452:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:to the serial correlation of the exchange rate, as well as the probability of consecutive interventions. This gives
11:409:32816:15:15:72:511:437:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:us a total of 20 moments, greater than the number of parameters, leaving our system over-identified.
11:410:32916:15:15:87:557:422:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:We use simulated GMM to estimate the model. The general idea of this procedure can be easily understood
11:411:33019:15:15:72:557:407:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:by analyzing how other techniques estimate the coefficients. For example, when we use Maximum Likelihood
11:412:33123:15:15:72:557:392:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:the goal is to estimate the parameters using the mean and the variances. GMM extends that procedure and
11:413:33226:15:15:72:557:377:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:uses other moments. Simulated GMM is a further generalization, in which we choose different moments and
11:414:33329:15:15:72:558:362:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:characteristics from the data, and “create” our own data using our auxiliary model to match those “moments”.
11:415:33437:15:15:72:558:347:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Indeed, all three techniques use auxiliary models for their estimation. On the one hand, in ML we use multinomial
11:416:33550:15:14:72:557:332:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:distributions, described only by means and variances. On the other hand, simulated GMM creates its own data
11:417:33657:14:15:72:554:318:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:within a well specified model to produce the statistics that we are interested in matching from the population.
11:418:33768:15:15:87:558:303:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:In summary, the procedure is as follows: First, we create random draws of 20,000 observations for three
11:419:33871:15:15:72:558:288:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:uncorrelated shocks with unitary variance. The same set of shock variables are retained for the entire estimation
11:420:33984:15:15:72:558:273:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:procedure. Second, we simulate the model given some initial conditions. Third, we compute the moments in the
11:421:34092:15:15:72:558:258:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:simulated data and compare them with the sample moments. Finally, we iterate this procedure to search for the
11:422:34201:15:15:72:493:243:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:coefficients that minimize the distance between the population moments and the simulated ones.
11:423:34295:15:15:87:558:228:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:To calculate the standard errors of the estimates we use the asymptotic distribution of the sample moments.
11:424:34402:15:15:72:558:213:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Using the data, we bootstrap the exchange rate, intervention, and probabilities of interventions to produce a
11:425:34511:15:15:72:557:198:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:sequence of moments (100 of them). Then we estimate the coefficients for each draw of the moments, computing
11:426:34619:15:15:72:558:183:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:the distribution of our coefficients. Because it is likely that the data is serially correlated, the bootstrap takes
11:427:34735:15:24:72:148:168:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:this into account.
11:428:34753:24:12:79:558:144:36:g_d0_f5:65:g_d0_f5:14The lag structure takes into account that the exchange rate can only depend on observable variables. Thus, the lag of intervention
11:429:34885:12:0:72:557:132:65:g_d0_f5:65:g_d0_f5:used isINTt−1and notINT∗t−1. However, for the shadow intervention equation we allow it to depend on the lag shadow realization.

12:431:35021:25:15:72:558:648:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Before we present our results, it is illustrating to demonstrate the problems in estimation that arise from using
12:432:35134:15:15:72:558:633:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:more traditional methods.  As noted earlier, frequently, researchers exclude the contemporaneous impact of
12:433:35240:15:15:72:557:618:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:intervention in an attempt to overcome the endogeneity. To account for the properties of exchange rate data,
12:434:35348:15:15:72:558:603:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:a GARCH error structure is typically used. Table 3 presents the results from an EGARCH(1,1) model of log
12:435:35452:15:15:72:558:588:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:changes in the USD/AUD exchange rate over the full sample, and in each of the high and low bound regimes.
12:436:35557:15:15:72:557:573:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:To highlight the impact of the simultaneity bias, we also present regressions that include the contemporaneous
12:437:35667:15:15:72:558:558:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:intervention.  The coefficients on lagged intervention are uniformlysmall (around 0.005), and frequently the
12:438:35775:15:25:72:491:543:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:wrong sign, suggesting that RBA purchases of Australian dollars depreciated the exchange rate.
12:439:35869:25:25:270:358:518:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:[Insert Table 3 here]
12:440:35890:25:15:87:557:493:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:The coefficient on contemporaneous intervention is always significant and incorrectly signed. The estimates

12:442:36106:15:14:72:558:463:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:wrong sign is a direct consequence of the endogeneity. The OLS estimate is a combination ofαandβ, and likely

12:446:36416:21:15:72:558:381:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:We now move on to the results from our basic model (equation (10)) that excludes lags. This implies that the
12:447:36524:15:15:72:557:366:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:central bank target is the previous day’s exchange rate, although the rich error structure will capture deviations
12:448:36638:15:15:72:518:351:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:from this. Later we extend the model to include lagsthat implies a target of a longer moving average.

12:450:36842:15:15:72:557:321:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Thefirst column is the point estimate using the simulated GMM methodology and the moments from the data.

12:452:37035:15:15:72:558:291:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:generate 100 sets of moments bootstrapping the residuals of the original data in each of the regimes. The standard
12:453:37149:15:15:72:557:276:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:deviation is of the boostrapped distribution of parameter estimates. The fourth column is the quasi t-statistic
12:454:37260:15:15:72:557:261:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:calculated as the mean divided by the standard deviation. It is important to highlight that the distributions are
12:455:37373:15:15:72:557:246:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:not normal, so this statistic should be considered informative, but not conclusive in terms of the significance of
12:456:37487:15:14:72:557:231:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:the coefficients. Thefifth and sixth column are the maximum and minimum value of the boostrapped estimates.
12:457:37594:14:15:72:557:217:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:The last column is the percentage of the observations that are below zero. This is the statistic that we use to
12:458:37705:15:15:72:557:202:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:determine the significance of the coefficients. We prefer to look at the mass above and below zero rather than
12:459:37815:15:25:72:511:187:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:the quasi t-statistic given that most of the estimates are not normally distributed (this is a p-value).

12:461:37940:25:15:87:557:137:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Our main focus is on the estimate ofα. The point estimate is 0.135, and the mean of the distribution is 0.136.
12:462:38050:15:24:72:558:122:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:The standard deviation is 0.037. Indeed, as can be seen, from all 100 realizations the minimum is 0.033, which

13:466:38330:0:15:72:558:673:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:implies that there is no mass below zero. Both the quasi t-statistic and the proportion of realizations below zero
13:467:38444:15:25:72:466:658:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:indicate that the estimate is highly significant. The distribution ofαis shown in Figure 2.
13:468:38535:25:25:268:360:633:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:[Insert Figure 2 here]
13:469:38557:25:15:87:558:608:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:This estimate ofαindicates that intervention has a large effectontheexchangerate. Thecoefficient on
13:470:38656:15:15:72:557:593:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:contemporaneous intervention,α(0.136), implies that $A100m of purchases of Australian dollars is associated
13:471:38763:15:15:72:558:578:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:(on average) with a 1.36 per cent appreciation of the Australian dollar. If we take the average exchange rate
13:472:38872:15:15:72:558:563:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:over our sample period to be 0.75, then $US100m of purchases of Australian dollars would have appreciated the
13:473:38981:15:15:72:558:548:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Australian dollar by approximately 1.81 per cent. This response is larger than most results in the literature but
13:474:39094:15:15:72:557:533:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:closely related to calibrations obtained by Dominguez and Frankel (1993c). Dominguez and Frankel calculated
13:475:39201:15:15:72:509:518:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:that $US100m of purchases of US dollars would appreciate the US dollar by just under 1.6 per cent.
13:476:39299:15:15:87:557:503:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Our estimate differs from that in Dominguez and Frankel (1993c) in that it is calculated directly from
13:477:39401:15:15:72:558:488:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:exchange rate and intervention data.  In constructing their estimate Dominguez and Frankel need to make
13:478:39504:15:15:72:558:473:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:several assumptions, such as mean-variance preferences ofinvestors, and use expectations survey data and assets
13:479:39615:15:15:72:558:458:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:supplies data that are likely to contain measurement errors.  The dependence on survey data also requires
13:480:39720:15:14:72:558:443:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:that they consider exchange rate returns over a longerhorizon and so can’t estimate the short-run impact of
13:481:39827:14:15:72:557:429:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:intervention.  A significant improvement of our estimation methodology is that we are able to include both
13:482:39933:15:15:72:557:414:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:contemporaneous intervention and exchange rate returns to address the simultaneity. Nevertheless, our estimate
13:483:40043:15:15:72:558:399:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:is close to the one found by Dominguez and Frankel (1993c), and we cannot reject the hypothesis that they are
13:484:40152:15:15:72:110:384:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:different.
13:485:40162:15:15:87:558:369:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:The point estimate ofβis -0.028, with mean of -0.089 and a relatively large standard deviation of 0.095.
13:486:40266:15:15:72:558:354:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:As can be seen in Table 4 the quasi t-statistics suggest that the estimate is not statistically significant from
13:487:40378:15:15:72:558:339:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:zero.  However, demonstrating the importance of the non-normality of the distribution, all realizations are
13:488:40485:15:15:72:557:324:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:below zero indicating the estimate is highly significant. Figure 3 depicts the distribution ofβ. As can be seen,
13:489:40597:15:15:72:558:309:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:the distribution is not normal and there are some realizations that are relatively large (close to zero) but the
13:490:40709:15:25:72:209:294:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:distribution has a long left tail.

13:492:40765:25:15:87:558:244:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Thenegativecoefficient conforms with our priors, and RBA statements, that interventions are dictated by
13:493:40868:15:15:72:558:229:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:leaning against the wind. The point estimate implies that a one percent unexpected depreciation of the exchange
13:494:40979:15:15:72:558:214:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:rate leads the central bank to lean against the wind, buying 28 million Australian dollars in the foreign exchange
13:495:41093:15:15:72:213:199:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:market to slow the depreciation.
13:496:41125:15:15:87:558:184:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Our estimate ofγis precisely estimated; it is negative and significant. The point estimate is -0.304, almost
13:497:41233:15:14:72:558:169:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:identical to the mean of the bootstrapped distribution, -0.305, while the standard deviation is 0.056. In this case
13:498:41348:14:15:72:558:155:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:100 percent of the bootstrapped estimates are negative, implying that the coefficient is significantly different from
13:499:41465:15:15:72:558:140:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:zero at high levels of significance. The negative sign ofγdemonstrates that shocks common to the exchange rate
13:500:41575:15:15:72:558:125:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:process and the central bank’s reaction function simultaneously weaken (strengthen) the currency and increase
13:501:41684:15:15:72:557:110:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:(decrease) the central bank’s desire to support the currency. Again this supports our priors of central bank
13:502:41792:15:15:72:558:95:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:policy. These shocks can be interpreted to be shocks to the exchange rate during periods of high conditional
13:503:41900:15:0:72:558:80:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:volatility which the central bank shows greater inclination to resist. The negative estimate ofγprovides an
14:504:42009:0:15:72:557:673:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:additional reason why failing to account for the simultaneity of exchange rate and intervention determination is
14:505:42121:15:15:72:389:658:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:likely to bias downward the impact of intervention on the exchange rate.
14:506:42193:15:15:87:557:643:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Finally, the estimates of the thresholds are highly significant and reasonable given what we have observed.
14:507:42300:15:15:72:558:628:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:These values have been scaled to simplify the estimation process. Their interpretation is that in the early period
14:508:42414:15:15:72:558:613:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:the central bank participates in the foreign exchange rate market when the shadow intervention is larger than
14:509:42523:15:31:72:502:598:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:$A3.2m, while in the later regime it intervenes if the required intervention is larger than $A18.5m.

15:551:44757:37:15:87:558:569:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:The interpretation of the response of the exchange rate to intervention is complicated by the feedback between
15:552:44867:15:15:72:558:554:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:the variables in the presence of lags. Figure 4 shows the impulse response functions for the exchange rate in
15:553:44976:15:15:72:557:539:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:the model with lags and the base model without lags. Theimpulse responses for the two models are calculated
15:554:45083:15:15:72:557:524:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:ignoring the participation decision of the central bank. Since the coefficients in the policy function on lagged
15:555:45195:15:15:72:558:509:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:intervention are negative, abstracting from the participation decision implies the central bank will unwind its
15:556:45306:15:15:72:558:494:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:intervention on subsequent days. Empirically this does not occur demonstrating the importance of the interaction
15:557:45418:15:15:72:558:479:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:of the two components of the central bank policy function. The central bank almost never intervenes on opposite
15:558:45529:15:15:72:558:464:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:sides of the market on subsequent days. A third series on the graph incorporates the entry decision by restricting
15:559:45643:15:14:72:558:449:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:the central bank to remain absent from the market on the days following the initial intervention. Here the effect
15:560:45756:14:25:72:466:435:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:on subsequent days is shown to be larger, though still smaller than that on the initial day.

15:562:45870:37:15:87:558:373:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:The cumulative impact of intervention is shown in Figure 5. Note that the short lag structure used constrains
15:563:45979:15:15:72:558:358:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:that intervention has a permanent effect on the exchange rate. A long lag structure would be needed to capture
15:564:46089:15:15:72:558:343:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:the unwinding of the effects of intervention. Including many lags is not practical for the estimation method
15:565:46197:15:15:72:558:328:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:we employ and so we are unable to assess how long the effects of intervention last beyond a few days. The
15:566:46302:15:15:72:557:313:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:cumulative response of the exchange rate to intervention, after 2 to 3 days, is similar for the models including
15:567:46414:15:15:72:558:298:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:and excluding lags. In the model with lags $A100m ($US100m) will appreciate the exchange rate by 1 per cent
15:568:46521:15:37:72:531:283:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:(1.35 per cent), slightly less than the 1.36 per cent (1.81 per cent) predicted by the model excluding lags.

15:571:46684:21:15:72:557:182:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Before concluding, it is worth spending time discussing the robustness and validity of the procedure developed in
15:572:46797:15:15:72:557:167:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:this paper. Our estimation methodology has several caveats that should be addressed in future research. First,
15:573:46907:15:15:72:558:152:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:it does not distinguish through which channel intervention affects the exchange rate. Given the relative shifts
15:574:47018:15:15:72:557:137:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:in bonds in private hands is small, the portfolio balance channel is likely to play an insignificant role. Rather,
15:575:47132:15:15:72:557:122:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:the signalling channel, and possibly market microstructure effects, would seem to be responsible - but this is a
15:576:47244:15:15:72:211:107:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:conjecture, rather than a result.
15:577:47277:15:15:87:557:92:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Second, as it stands our methodology requires that the change in policy is truly exogenous. Finding such
15:578:47381:15:0:72:558:77:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:exogenous changes in policy for other countries may not be straight forward. However, it is possible to model
16:579:47492:0:15:72:558:673:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:the threshold in the participation equation as a function of macro variables, the exchange rate, and even the
16:580:47601:15:15:72:558:658:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:second moments of the endogenous variables. The procedure of estimation would be exactly the same as the one
16:581:47709:15:15:72:558:643:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:described here if the change in policy is thought as a shift in the coefficients in that equation. Furthermore, the
16:582:47824:15:15:72:558:628:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:participation decision could be rationalized as a switching Markov regime where the transition probabilities are
16:583:47936:15:15:72:558:613:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:function of the endogenous variables. The estimation of these models is beyond the scope of the present paper,
16:584:48046:15:15:72:558:598:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:and are left for future research. Nevertheless, it is important to mention that in this paper we have emphasized
16:585:48158:15:15:72:558:583:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:the identification issue, and our specification is a reduced form representation of these models where the shift in
16:586:48273:15:15:72:393:568:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:policy would be reflected in changes in the intervention decision equation.
16:587:48348:15:15:87:558:553:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Finally, our methodology assumes that the coefficients are stable across regimes (other than the threshold).
16:588:48456:15:15:72:558:538:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:This seems to be a reasonable assumption in the current study but may be more difficult to justify in other
16:589:48563:15:15:72:558:523:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:contexts.  This criticism is akin to the application of the Lucas critique to models of monetary policy.  Our
16:590:48672:15:15:72:557:508:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:framework is not entirely exempt from this critique, and therefore, conclusions from this analysis are subject to
16:591:48785:15:37:72:281:493:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:the caveat of the strength of these assumptions.
16:592:48833:37:25:72:190:456:207:g_d0_f4:207:g_d0_f4:6Conclusion
16:593:48844:25:15:72:558:431:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:The endogeneity of exchange rates and intervention has long plagued studies of the effectiveness of central
16:594:48951:15:15:72:558:416:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:banks’ actions in foreign exchange markets. Researchers have either excluded contemporaneous intervention,
16:595:49057:15:15:72:558:401:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:so that their explanators are predetermined, or obtained a small, and typically incorrectly signed, coefficient
16:596:49168:15:15:72:558:386:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:on contemporaneous intervention. Failing to account for the endogeneity, when central banks lean against the
16:597:49276:15:15:72:557:371:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:wind and trade strategically, will likely result in a large downward bias to the coefficient on contemporaneous
16:598:49387:15:15:72:374:356:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:intervention — explaining the negative coefficient frequently obtained.
16:599:49458:15:15:87:557:341:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:This paper uses a novel identification assumption, a change in RBA intervention policy, that allows us
16:600:49560:15:14:72:558:326:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:to estimate a model that includes the contemporaneous impact of intervention.  We use simulated GMM to
16:601:49662:14:15:72:558:312:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:estimate the model. There are three main results. Our point estimates suggest that central bank intervention
16:602:49770:15:15:72:558:297:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:has a substantial effect. Wefind that a (sterilized) purchase of $US100m of Australian dollars by the RBA would
16:603:49881:15:15:72:558:282:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:be associated with an appreciation of between 1.35 and 1.81 per cent. These estimates are remarkably similar
16:604:49989:15:15:72:557:267:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:to that in Dominguez and Frankel (1993c) even though our estimation methodology is completely different,
16:605:50093:15:15:72:558:252:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:depending on only exchange rate and intervention data. Second, an intervention is shown to have its largest
16:606:50200:15:15:72:558:237:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:effect on the exchange rate on the day in which it is conducted, with smaller effects on subsequent days. This
16:607:50310:15:15:72:557:222:102:g_d0_f6:102:g_d0_f5:finding has not previously been demonstrated in the literature due to the problem of endogeneity, and confirms
16:608:50420:15:15:72:557:207:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:the beliefs of central banks of the immediacy of the efficacy of intervention. Finally, we confirmfindings that
16:609:50531:15:0:72:474:192:102:g_d0_f5:102:g_d0_f5:Australian central bank intervention policy can be characterized by leaning aginst the wind.
