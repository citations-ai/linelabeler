3:0:1:0:28:126:484:709:144:Times:144:Times:In this paper, we examine trends in relative wages in the United States and
3:1:76:28:28:90:516:681:144:Times:144:Times:Canada. These trends are of interest for two reasons. First, technological change is likely
3:2:167:28:27:90:487:653:144:Times:144:Times:to affect the distribution of income. The data considered here illustrate some of the
3:3:252:27:28:90:513:626:144:Times:144:Times:consequences we can expect from the introduction of new technologies. They also point
3:4:337:28:27:90:357:598:144:Times:144:Times:in the direction of policy options for dealing with them.
3:5:394:27:28:126:518:571:144:Times:144:Times:Second, labor market data open up a new window on the process of technological
3:6:472:28:28:90:489:543:144:Times:144:Times:change. As the other papers in this volume suggest, new technologies may arrive at
3:7:554:28:27:90:518:515:144:Times:144:Times:sharply different rates in different decades. There is little doubt that this kind of variation
3:8:649:27:28:90:473:488:144:Times:144:Times:arises at the level of the firm or even at the level of the industry. The interesting
3:9:734:28:27:90:442:460:144:Times:144:Times:conjecture is that it also shows up at the level of the economy as a whole.
3:10:809:27:28:126:494:433:144:Times:144:Times:The usual way to infer something about variation in the rate of technological
3:11:886:28:28:90:509:405:144:Times:144:Times:change is to use the fact that new technologies raise the first moment of the distribution
3:12:976:28:27:90:507:377:144:Times:144:Times:of income. Variation in the rate of technological change should show up as variation in
3:13:1063:27:28:90:512:350:144:Times:144:Times:the rate of growth of average wages, average income, or productivity. However, data on
3:14:1149:28:27:90:516:322:144:Times:144:Times:these variables are increasingly suspect because of problems with price mismeasurement
3:15:1235:27:28:90:494:295:144:Times:144:Times:that may be getting worse as the economy evolves. (See, for example, Zvi Griliches,
3:16:1318:28:28:90:517:267:144:Times:144:Times:1994.) Errors in measures of the price level will bias measures of real output, real wages,
3:17:1409:28:27:90:496:239:144:Times:144:Times:or productivity. Changes in the magnitude of these errors will bias measured rates of
3:18:1494:27:28:90:519:212:144:Times:144:Times:growth in these variables. At the same time that we try to construct better price measures,
3:19:1585:28:27:90:509:184:144:Times:144:Times:we must also explore other indicators of the trend in technology that are not susceptible
3:20:1674:27:28:90:289:157:144:Times:144:Times:to bias from price level mismeasurement.
3:21:1714:28:28:126:488:129:144:Times:144:Times:If, as many people believe, technological change also influences the second
3:22:1789:28:0:90:462:101:144:Times:144:Times:moment of the wage distribution, we can use the trend in relative wages as an
4:23:1867:0:28:90:508:709:144:Times:144:Times:independent indicator of underlying changes in technology. As an alternative indicator,
4:24:1954:28:28:90:492:681:144:Times:144:Times:the ratio of two wages has the advantage that it does not require a price index and is
4:25:2040:28:27:90:521:653:144:Times:144:Times:therefore invulnerable to bias from price mismeasurement. Of course, this measure has its
4:26:2129:27:28:90:506:626:144:Times:144:Times:own disadvantages. For example, relative wages can tell us about the trend in only one
4:27:2215:28:27:90:494:598:144:Times:144:Times:component of technological change — the skill bias. Nevertheless, it is a potentially
4:28:2300:27:28:90:499:571:144:Times:144:Times:revealing measure that we should certainly exploit, along with others, when we try to
4:29:2385:28:28:90:330:543:144:Times:144:Times:understand the evolution of technology over time.
4:30:2434:28:27:126:515:515:144:Times:144:Times:To get at both of the questions that interest us — How does technology influence
4:31:2514:27:28:90:508:488:144:Times:144:Times:relative wages? and, How has the rate of technological change varied over time? — we
4:32:2598:28:27:90:485:460:144:Times:144:Times:focus in this paper on the university-high school wage premium. We calculate this
4:33:2679:27:28:90:504:433:144:Times:144:Times:premium as the ratio of the wage for someone with a university degree to the wage for
4:34:2764:28:28:90:507:405:144:Times:144:Times:someone with only a high school education. We illustrate the trends in this premium in
4:35:2850:28:27:90:473:377:144:Times:144:Times:Figure 1. This figure presents data from the United States that were explored by
4:36:2930:27:28:90:480:350:144:Times:144:Times:Lawrence Katz and Kevin Murphy (1992). We extend this series with illustrative
4:37:3008:28:27:90:503:322:144:Times:144:Times:estimates for the United States that extend through 1994. The figure also presents new
4:38:3094:27:28:90:517:295:144:Times:144:Times:data for Canada from 1981 to 1994. (Details of the data we use are presented in section 3
4:39:3183:28:28:90:510:267:144:Times:144:Times:below.) For the rest of the analysis presented here, we work with the Katz-Murphy data
4:40:3269:28:27:90:499:239:144:Times:144:Times:through 1987 and process the Canadian data in the same way that that they processed
4:41:3352:27:28:90:511:212:144:Times:144:Times:their data. For our purposes, the key fact about the data illustrated in Figure 1 is that the
4:42:3445:28:27:90:504:184:144:Times:144:Times:university-high school wage premium varies substantially both over time and between
4:43:3528:27:28:90:484:157:144:Times:144:Times:countries. In the United States, it grew during the 1960s and fell during the 1970s.
4:44:3612:28:0:90:517:129:144:Times:144:Times:Throughout the 1980s, the premium grew in the United States yet fell slightly in Canada.
5:45:3701:0:28:126:516:709:144:Times:144:Times:Many people have interpreted movements in relative wages as an indicator of the
5:46:3780:28:28:90:475:681:144:Times:144:Times:forces influencing the demand for different types of labor. In this sense, they are
5:47:3863:28:27:90:507:653:144:Times:144:Times:implicitly adopting the approach that we advocate here — using movements in relative
5:48:3947:27:28:90:472:626:144:Times:144:Times:wages as indicators of changes in relative demands (which are in turn related to
5:49:4027:28:27:90:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:technological change). However, in informal and popular discussions, people often do not
5:50:4115:27:28:90:494:571:144:Times:144:Times:take account of the confounding effects induced by changes in the relative supply of
5:51:4199:28:28:90:508:543:144:Times:144:Times:different types of labor. Katz and Murphy (1992) have shown that in the United States,
5:52:4285:28:27:90:517:515:144:Times:144:Times:the variation in relative wages plotted in Figure 1 is well explained by a steady growth in
5:53:4376:27:28:90:485:488:144:Times:144:Times:relative demand together with the observed changes in relative supply. Changes in
5:54:4457:28:27:90:506:460:144:Times:144:Times:relative supply of university and high school educated workers seem to account for the
5:55:4543:27:28:90:514:433:144:Times:144:Times:substantial decade-to-decade variations in the path of relative wages illustrated in Figure
5:56:4634:28:28:90:517:405:144:Times:144:Times:1. For the 1980s, we find similar differences in rates of growth of different types of labor
5:57:4726:28:27:90:509:377:144:Times:144:Times:between the United States and Canada. As Richard Freeman and Karen Needels (1993)
5:58:4807:27:28:90:518:350:144:Times:144:Times:conjectured, supply changes seem to explain the difference in the behavior of the relative
5:59:4897:28:27:90:507:322:144:Times:144:Times:wages of more- and less-educated workers in these two countries. Our main result is to
5:60:4983:27:28:90:501:295:144:Times:144:Times:show that this qualitative impression carries over to a quantitative representation. The
5:61:5071:28:28:90:507:267:144:Times:144:Times:same model that Katz and Murphy used to explain the difference in trends over time in
5:62:5156:28:27:90:519:239:144:Times:144:Times:the United States also explains the difference between the trend in inequality between the
5:63:5246:27:28:90:158:212:144:Times:144:Times:two countries.
5:64:5260:28:27:126:518:184:144:Times:144:Times:After Katz and Murphy correct for relative supply changes, they find no evidence
5:65:5340:27:28:90:513:157:144:Times:144:Times:of variation in the rate at which the relative demand for different types of labor has been
5:66:5431:28:28:90:488:129:144:Times:144:Times:shifting over time. After we correct for the effects of changes in supply, we find no
5:67:5516:28:0:90:517:101:144:Times:144:Times:evidence of differences in the rate at which the relative demand is shifting in Canada and
6:68:5607:0:28:90:499:709:144:Times:144:Times:the US. We also find that over the entire sample period the underlying trend seems to
6:69:5692:28:28:90:519:681:144:Times:144:Times:have been increasing relative demand at a steady rate. However, within some sub-periods
6:70:5779:28:27:90:516:653:144:Times:144:Times:there is some evidence of a slowdown and subsequent speedup relative to the underlying
6:71:5865:27:28:90:499:626:144:Times:144:Times:trend.  Whether or not this evidence weighs against the hypothesis that the process of
6:72:5951:28:27:90:496:598:144:Times:144:Times:technological change has varied in a fundamental way in recent decades is discussed
6:73:6034:27:28:90:114:571:144:Times:144:Times:later.
6:74:6040:28:28:126:501:543:144:Times:144:Times:Of course, it is possible that forces such as increased openness to international
6:75:6121:28:27:90:517:515:144:Times:144:Times:trade are also shifting the relative demand for labor. It is also possible that the factor bias
6:76:6216:27:28:90:510:488:144:Times:144:Times:of technological change (the part of technological change that we measure with relative
6:77:6303:28:27:90:493:460:144:Times:144:Times:wages) changes at a steady rate even though the productivity effect of technological
6:78:6387:27:28:90:513:433:144:Times:144:Times:change varies from decade to decade. For both of these reasons, one must be cautious in
6:79:6474:28:28:90:489:405:144:Times:144:Times:interpreting the meaning of the shifts we infer in the relative demand for labor. The
6:80:6559:28:27:90:514:377:144:Times:144:Times:evidence we offer is only one of many different bits of evidence that need to be weighed
6:81:6647:27:28:90:413:350:144:Times:144:Times:in making a judgment about overall trends in technological change.
6:82:6713:28:27:126:499:322:144:Times:144:Times:But regardless of how we interpret shifts in the relative demand for labor, it is
6:83:6794:27:28:90:497:295:144:Times:144:Times:clear that one cannot infer anything about the magnitude of these shifts, or even their
6:84:6881:28:28:90:515:267:144:Times:144:Times:direction, without first correcting for changes in relative supplies of labor. In the data we
6:85:6974:28:27:90:498:239:144:Times:144:Times:examine, changes in supply appear to be the most important force causing decade-to-
6:86:7057:27:28:90:506:212:144:Times:144:Times:decade and country-to-country variation in trends in relative wages. If this relationship
6:87:7146:28:27:90:518:184:144:Times:144:Times:holds more generally, it has important implications for policy responses to growing wage
6:88:7234:27:28:90:516:157:144:Times:144:Times:inequality caused by technological change. Policy makers who want to influence relative
6:89:7321:28:28:90:499:129:144:Times:144:Times:wages may find it easier and more productive to adjust the relative supply of workers
6:90:7406:28:0:90:497:101:144:Times:144:Times:with different levels of education than the relative demand. If the government adopts
7:91:7492:0:28:90:516:709:144:Times:144:Times:policies which raise educational attainment of some workers, it simultaneously increases
7:92:7580:28:28:90:487:681:144:Times:144:Times:the relative supply of more educated workers and lowers the relative supply of less
7:93:7663:28:27:90:512:653:144:Times:144:Times:educated workers. Educational subsidies can therefore have a doubly powerful effect on
7:94:7749:27:28:90:498:626:144:Times:144:Times:the relative supply. We find a relatively high degree of substitution between different
7:95:7836:28:27:90:513:598:144:Times:144:Times:types of workers. Nevertheless, feasible changes in government policies — changes that
7:96:7922:27:28:90:520:571:144:Times:144:Times:are of the same magnitude as the differences in policies we see between the United States
7:97:8011:28:28:90:491:543:144:Times:144:Times:and Canada — can have a substantial effect on the wage premium, and therefore on
7:98:8091:28:27:90:499:515:144:Times:144:Times:income inequality. Moreover, other kinds of policies to encourage skill formation are
7:99:8176:27:28:90:234:488:144:Times:144:Times:likely to have the same effect.
7:100:8207:28:27:126:519:460:144:Times:144:Times:In the next section, we relate our results to work from labor economics, economic
7:101:8288:27:28:90:522:433:144:Times:144:Times:history, and growth theory. We also outline some of the main positions in the old political
7:102:8379:28:28:90:465:405:144:Times:144:Times:debate about economic prospects for workers in the bottom part of the income
7:103:8455:28:27:90:493:377:144:Times:144:Times:distribution. Then we present our basic model and describe our data and results. We
7:104:8538:27:28:90:500:350:144:Times:144:Times:conclude with some conjectures about how to reconcile our wage-based finding of no
7:105:8620:28:27:90:513:322:144:Times:144:Times:change in the process of technological change with the usual quantity-based finding of a
7:106:8708:27:42:90:320:295:144:Times:144:Times:substantial productivity slowdown in the 1970s.
7:107:8755:42:31:90:454:253:197:Helvetica:197:Helvetica:1. Technological change, income inequality, and policy
7:108:8809:31:27:126:475:222:144:Times:144:Times:Although few economists stress the connection, the assumption that new
7:109:8879:27:28:90:478:195:144:Times:144:Times:technologies (or new types of capital goods) are relative complements with more
7:110:8958:28:28:90:475:167:144:Times:144:Times:educated labor is closely related to the popular intuition that machinery and new
7:111:9039:28:27:90:520:139:144:Times:144:Times:technology harm low-skill workers. This concern forms the basis for one side in the long-
7:112:9128:27:28:90:520:112:144:Times:144:Times:standing debate about the connection between technology, growth and income inequality,
7:113:9214:28:0:90:422:84:144:Times:144:Times:a debate that goes back at least to Ricardo’s discussion of machinery.
8:114:9285:0:28:126:502:709:144:Times:144:Times:In this debate, proponents of what one could call the “interventionist” position
8:115:9365:28:28:90:519:681:144:Times:144:Times:start from the presumption that technological change harms workers in the bottom part of
8:116:9453:28:27:90:494:653:144:Times:144:Times:the income distribution. They conclude that the gains from economic growth will be
8:117:9535:27:28:90:486:626:144:Times:144:Times:widely shared only if governments adopt activist policies that resist market forces.
8:118:9619:28:27:90:501:598:144:Times:144:Times:Examples of such policies include a minimum wage, regulations limiting work hours,
8:119:9701:27:28:90:506:571:144:Times:144:Times:unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation, employment standards, and support
8:120:9781:28:28:90:513:543:144:Times:144:Times:for unions that negotiate above market wages. Proponents of the interventionist position
8:121:9869:28:27:90:497:515:144:Times:144:Times:believe that the advanced industrial economies have been able to achieve a relatively
8:122:9954:27:28:90:475:488:144:Times:144:Times:equal sharing of the gains from growth only because governments adopted these
8:123:10031:28:27:90:515:460:144:Times:144:Times:measures. Many of them fear that a process of global competition will lead to an erosion
8:124:10119:27:28:90:435:433:144:Times:144:Times:of these interventions and a corresponding growth in income inequality.
8:125:10190:28:28:126:500:405:144:Times:144:Times:An opposing pole in this debate comes from within the economics profession.
8:126:10265:28:27:90:509:377:144:Times:144:Times:Economists do not necessarily oppose the kinds of social welfare policies advocated by
8:127:10351:27:28:90:505:350:144:Times:144:Times:the interventionists. Some do, and some do not. However, they are close to unanimous
8:128:10435:28:27:90:522:322:144:Times:144:Times:that these measures by themselves cannot explain much of the gains in standards of living
8:129:10524:27:28:90:495:295:144:Times:144:Times:experienced by people in the bottom half of the income distribution. The economists
8:130:10607:28:28:90:515:267:144:Times:144:Times:argue that technological change and the market forces it unleashes tend naturally to raise
8:131:10697:28:27:90:503:239:144:Times:144:Times:the incomes of all members of the labor force, just as the proverbial rising tide lifts all
8:132:10788:27:28:90:513:212:144:Times:144:Times:boats. According to this view, wages for all types of workers will naturally tend to grow
8:133:10877:28:27:90:374:184:144:Times:144:Times:as technological change raises the average level of income.
8:134:10936:27:28:126:497:157:144:Times:144:Times:Paul Samuelson’s principles textbook gives a representative statement of this
8:135:11013:28:0:90:282:129:144:Times:144:Times:rising-tide position as of the mid-1960s:
9:136:11055:0:21:126:494:709:144:Times:144:Times:An alternative theory would ascribe the rise of wages under capitalism to (1)
9:137:11132:21:21:126:461:688:144:Times:144:Times:trade-union pressure, (2) government regulation of monopoly, and (3)
9:138:11200:21:21:126:482:667:144:Times:144:Times:interventions of a welfare and regulatory kind by democratic governments
9:139:11272:21:20:126:522:646:144:Times:144:Times:reacting to militant political pressures from the masses.  This cannot be rejected as
9:140:11357:20:21:126:520:626:144:Times:144:Times:without substance, for we have seen throughout this book that government actions
9:141:11437:21:21:126:506:605:144:Times:144:Times:do have consequences for both good and evil. But the magnitude and pattern of
9:142:11514:21:20:126:511:584:144:Times:144:Times:the rise in real wages in this last century has been such as to cast doubt on union
9:143:11597:20:21:126:519:564:144:Times:144:Times:or political action as an important element in its explanation. ... With the advance
9:144:11681:21:21:126:514:543:144:Times:144:Times:of technology and the piling up of a larger stock of capital goods, it would take a
9:145:11764:21:20:126:491:522:144:Times:144:Times:veritable miracle of the devil to keep real wages of men from being bid ever
9:146:11840:20:21:126:495:502:144:Times:144:Times:higher with each passing decade. Who fails to see this fails to understand the
9:147:11918:21:21:126:513:481:144:Times:144:Times:fundamentals of economic history, as it actually happened. (Samuelson, 1964, p.
9:148:11997:21:48:126:148:460:144:Times:144:Times:773)
9:149:12001:48:28:90:519:412:144:Times:144:Times:Samuelson is surely correct when he argues that supporters of the interventionist position
9:150:12091:28:27:90:481:384:144:Times:144:Times:are wrong about the reasons why income gains have been widely shared since the
9:151:12169:27:28:90:489:357:144:Times:144:Times:beginning of the industrial revolution. However, his explanation in terms of capital
9:152:12253:28:27:90:500:329:144:Times:144:Times:accumulation and technological change fails to confront the microeconomic evidence
9:153:12335:27:28:90:513:302:144:Times:144:Times:suggesting that everything else equal, technological progress can harm large parts of the
9:154:12424:28:28:90:254:274:144:Times:144:Times:labor force even as it helps others.
9:155:12460:28:27:126:511:246:144:Times:144:Times:The neoclassical vision that Samuelson articulates, one based on the assumption
9:156:12539:27:28:90:501:219:144:Times:144:Times:that technology is a complement with a homogeneous labor aggregate, has dominated
9:157:12620:28:27:90:509:191:144:Times:144:Times:textbook and policy discussions of wage trends for many years. Economists formalized
9:158:12704:27:28:90:503:164:144:Times:144:Times:this view in the neoclassical growth model based on two factors of production: capital
9:159:12790:28:28:90:498:136:144:Times:144:Times:and labor. It continues to be embedded in most treatments of aggregate growth. Even
9:160:12873:28:27:90:512:108:144:Times:144:Times:growth models that explicitly introduce human capital as a separate factor of production
9:161:12961:27:0:90:512:81:144:Times:144:Times:generally do so in a way that makes more educated workers perfect substitutes with less
10:162:13049:0:28:90:506:709:144:Times:144:Times:educated workers (Assaf Razin, 1972; Robert Lucas, 1988) or that makes technology a
10:163:13132:28:28:90:496:681:144:Times:144:Times:complement with both types of labor (N. Gregory Mankiw, David Romer and David
10:164:13209:28:27:90:477:653:144:Times:144:Times:Weil, 1992; Paul Romer, 1990). Either way, there is no scope in such models for
10:165:13288:27:28:90:504:626:144:Times:144:Times:technological change to differentially affect wages for workers with different levels of
10:166:13376:28:27:90:496:598:144:Times:144:Times:education. In particular, there is no recognition that technological change can reduce
10:167:13462:27:28:90:210:571:144:Times:144:Times:wages for some workers.
10:168:13485:28:28:126:481:543:144:Times:144:Times:However, there are two important lines of work in economics that do treat
10:169:13558:28:27:90:500:515:144:Times:144:Times:different types of labor as inputs that could be differentially affected by technological
10:170:13647:27:28:90:515:488:144:Times:144:Times:progress or capital accumulation. Since the work of Sherwin Rosen (1968) and Griliches
10:171:13733:28:27:90:517:460:144:Times:144:Times:(1969), a number of labor economists have presented evidence supporting the notion that
10:172:13820:27:28:90:473:433:144:Times:144:Times:higher skilled or more educated workers benefit disproportionately from capital
10:173:13899:28:28:90:503:405:144:Times:144:Times:investment or technological change. The evidence is sketchy, but tends to suggest that
10:174:13985:28:27:90:477:377:144:Times:144:Times:more educated workers are stronger complements with new investment than less
10:175:14061:27:28:90:501:350:144:Times:144:Times:educated workers. It also suggests that there is a relatively high degree of substitution
10:176:14150:28:27:90:504:322:144:Times:144:Times:between these two types of workers. (See Daniel Hamermesh, 1993, for a summary of
10:177:14231:27:28:90:228:295:144:Times:144:Times:research on these questions.)
10:178:14260:28:28:126:521:267:144:Times:144:Times:These conclusions are reinforced by the work of economic historians on education
10:179:14340:28:27:90:508:239:144:Times:144:Times:and wages. In the last century, the level of educational attainment in the population has
10:180:14429:27:28:90:497:212:144:Times:144:Times:increased substantially. (See, for example, the discussion of the experience in the US
10:181:14515:28:27:90:491:184:144:Times:144:Times:presented by Claudia Goldin, 1994.) In the absence of some force that increases the
10:182:14598:27:28:90:513:157:144:Times:144:Times:relative demand for educated labor, this increase in the relative supply of more educated
10:183:14687:28:28:90:507:129:144:Times:144:Times:workers should have driven their relative wage inexorably downward if more educated
10:184:14770:28:0:90:390:101:144:Times:144:Times:workers are not perfect substitutes with less educated workers.
11:185:14835:0:28:126:511:709:144:Times:144:Times:Both the historical evidence (e.g., Katz and Goldin, 1995) and the contemporary
11:186:14914:28:28:90:507:681:144:Times:144:Times:evidence from labor markets (Hamermesh, 1992; Katz and Murphy, 1992) suggest that
11:187:14995:28:27:90:507:653:144:Times:144:Times:relative wages for more educated workers do fall when the supply of educated workers
11:188:15079:27:28:90:502:626:144:Times:144:Times:outpaces growth in demand. This evidence and everyday experience both suggest that
11:189:15161:28:27:90:511:598:144:Times:144:Times:workers with different levels of education are not perfect substitutes. Four workers with
11:190:15250:27:28:90:509:571:144:Times:144:Times:six years of education cannot do the job that one worker with 24 years of education can
11:191:15337:28:28:90:515:543:144:Times:144:Times:do. Adding more workers with a primary education to the task usually will not help. The
11:192:15424:28:27:90:508:515:144:Times:144:Times:elasticity of substitution between more- and less-educated workers is large, but it is not
11:193:15514:27:28:90:401:488:144:Times:144:Times:infinite. They are substitutes, but they are not perfect substitutes.
11:194:15583:28:27:126:514:460:144:Times:144:Times:Nevertheless, the general historical pattern is one with no persistent tendency for
11:195:15666:27:28:90:484:433:144:Times:144:Times:relative wages of more educated workers to fall despite the large increases in their
11:196:15750:28:28:90:518:405:144:Times:144:Times:relative supply. For more than a century, some force must therefore have been increasing
11:197:15838:28:27:90:319:377:144:Times:144:Times:the relative demand for more educated workers.
11:198:15884:27:28:126:522:350:144:Times:144:Times:Some economists have pointed to increased international trade as the source of the
11:199:15966:28:27:90:520:322:144:Times:144:Times:demand shifts that have taken place in the last couple of decades. (Edward Leamer, 1996;
11:200:16054:27:28:90:502:295:144:Times:144:Times:Adrian Wood, 1994). Most attempts at quantifying the effects of trade fall far short of
11:201:16141:28:28:90:514:267:144:Times:144:Times:explaining the shifts (Jeffrey Sachs and Howard Shatz, 1994) or find other evidence that
11:202:16229:28:27:90:517:239:144:Times:144:Times:is inconsistent with the trade explanation (Katz and Murphy, 1992; Robert Lawrence and
11:203:16315:27:28:90:499:212:144:Times:144:Times:Matthew Slaughter, 1993). Nevertheless, the interpretation of the shifts remains open
11:204:16400:28:27:90:493:184:144:Times:144:Times:because it is difficult to offer direct evidence on the effects of technological change.
11:205:16488:27:28:90:499:157:144:Times:144:Times:(However, see, for example, Frank Levy and Richard Murnane, 1996.) The historical
11:206:16569:28:28:90:488:129:144:Times:144:Times:evidence is relevant because it reminds us that the pattern of relative demand shifts
11:207:16654:28:0:90:517:101:144:Times:144:Times:extends back at least into the last century. Any explanation based on developments in the
12:208:16745:0:28:90:509:709:144:Times:144:Times:world trading system since World War II cannot capture the whole story. It also fails to
12:209:16833:28:28:90:518:681:144:Times:144:Times:explain why levels of education have been growing throughout the world without driving
12:210:16919:28:27:90:290:653:144:Times:144:Times:down the worldwide returns to education.
12:211:16959:27:28:126:510:626:144:Times:144:Times: Technological change is an obvious candidate force that has been impinging on
12:212:17037:28:27:90:517:598:144:Times:144:Times:the economy for centuries. There is no theoretical presumption that technological change
12:213:17125:27:28:90:486:571:144:Times:144:Times:will always tend to raise the demand for more educated workers. Nevertheless, the
12:214:17206:28:28:90:407:543:144:Times:144:Times:evidence suggests that over long historical periods, it has done so.
12:215:17274:28:27:126:475:515:144:Times:144:Times:In their analysis of historical trends, the proponents of the interventionist
12:216:17351:27:28:90:505:488:144:Times:144:Times:interpretation overestimate the power of conventional labor market policies. They also
12:217:17437:28:27:90:498:460:144:Times:144:Times:fail to appreciate the overwhelming importance of education as a force that limits the
12:218:17523:27:28:90:494:433:144:Times:144:Times:growth in inequality. But in responding to the interventionists, the proponents of the
12:219:17609:28:28:90:515:405:144:Times:144:Times:rising-tide view tend to oversimplify, perhaps even overstate, their case. They gloss over
12:220:17699:28:27:90:509:377:144:Times:144:Times:both the theory and the evidence suggesting that technological change can depress both
12:221:17785:27:28:90:495:350:144:Times:144:Times:relative and absolute wages for workers in the bottom part of the skill or educational
12:222:17871:28:27:90:495:322:144:Times:144:Times:distribution. Like the interventionists, advocates for the rising-tide model also fail to
12:223:17960:27:28:90:402:295:144:Times:144:Times:emphasize the importance of increases in educational attainment.
12:224:18024:28:28:126:517:267:144:Times:144:Times:In language that they borrow from Jan Tinbergen (1975), Katz and Goldin (1996)
12:225:18102:28:27:90:497:239:144:Times:144:Times:suggest that it is more appropriate to think of the behavior of the relative wage of the
12:226:18190:27:28:90:477:212:144:Times:144:Times:skilled and unskilled as the outcome of a race between technological change and
12:227:18269:28:27:90:500:184:144:Times:144:Times:increases in educational attainment. The theory and evidence that we present here fits
12:228:18355:27:28:90:452:157:144:Times:144:Times:more comfortably with this education-race view than it does with either the
12:229:18430:28:28:90:478:129:144:Times:144:Times:interventionist or rising-tide explanations for the interaction between growth and
12:230:18512:28:0:90:141:101:144:Times:144:Times:inequality.
13:231:18525:0:28:126:506:709:144:Times:144:Times:In recent years, the various positions in the debate about wages and technology
13:232:18604:28:28:90:508:681:144:Times:144:Times:have become more complicated than these three positions suggest. The growth in wage
13:233:18687:28:27:90:521:653:144:Times:144:Times:inequality in the United States during the 1980s made it increasingly difficult to support a
13:234:18779:27:28:90:497:626:144:Times:144:Times:pure version of the rising-tide position on growth and wages. As a result, a variety of
13:235:18866:28:27:90:512:598:144:Times:144:Times:economists began to consider once again the possibility that technological change could
13:236:18953:27:28:90:496:571:144:Times:144:Times:increase inequality. Because they believe that the rising-tide theory fits the historical
13:237:19042:28:28:90:517:543:144:Times:144:Times:facts, they suggest that something fundamental about the nature of technology must have
13:238:19129:28:27:90:516:515:144:Times:144:Times:changed. This re-examination has lent additional importance to the concept of a “general
13:239:19217:27:28:90:483:488:144:Times:144:Times:purpose technology” or GPT that was defined by Timothy Bresnahan and Manuel
13:240:19292:28:27:90:477:460:144:Times:144:Times:Trajtenberg (1995) and analyzed in the context of a model of growth by Elhanan
13:241:19370:27:28:90:516:433:144:Times:144:Times:Helpman and Trajtenberg (1994). The introduction of a new general-purpose technology
13:242:19454:28:28:90:456:405:144:Times:144:Times:is a natural way to explain a sharp change in the nature and consequences of
13:243:19530:28:27:90:195:377:144:Times:144:Times:technological change.
13:244:19551:27:28:126:513:350:144:Times:144:Times:In economic history in general and especially in discussions of technology, there
13:245:19632:28:27:90:481:322:144:Times:144:Times:are many antecedents for the concept of a general purpose technology (GPT). For
13:246:19711:27:28:90:514:295:144:Times:144:Times:example, it is closely related to the concept of “technological convergence” as described
13:247:19800:28:28:90:490:267:144:Times:144:Times:by Nathan Rosenberg (1963) in his discussion of the central role that machine tools
13:248:19883:28:27:90:508:239:144:Times:144:Times:played in the development of industry in the last century. It can also be understood as a
13:249:19972:27:28:90:516:212:144:Times:144:Times:refinement and formalization of the concept of a technological trajectory as described by
13:250:20061:28:27:90:318:184:144:Times:144:Times:Christopher Freeman and Carlota Perez (1988).
13:251:20106:27:28:126:517:157:144:Times:144:Times:As it has come to be used, both in this volume and more generally, the concept of
13:252:20187:28:28:90:485:129:144:Times:144:Times:a GPT captures two distinct ideas. First, it formalizes the notion that technological
13:253:20272:28:0:90:514:101:144:Times:144:Times:change is an irregular process that can have different effects on the economy at different
14:254:20364:0:28:90:507:709:144:Times:144:Times:times. Second, the concept of a GPT reminds us that adopting new technologies can be
14:255:20448:28:28:90:514:681:144:Times:144:Times:costly and disruptive. In this sense, it echoes and partially rehabilitates the old Ricardian
14:256:20541:28:27:90:377:653:144:Times:144:Times:and Marxian vision of technology as a double-edged sword.
14:257:20598:27:28:126:510:626:144:Times:144:Times:This first part of the GPT concept — the claim that technological change can be
14:258:20677:28:27:90:505:598:144:Times:144:Times:radically different in different periods — offers one possible reason why technological
14:259:20764:27:28:90:511:571:144:Times:144:Times:change seemed to have different effects in the 1950s and 1960s as opposed to the 1970s
14:260:20850:28:28:90:476:543:144:Times:144:Times:and 1980s. This leads to the fourth and final theoretical position that we identify
14:261:20933:28:27:90:520:515:144:Times:144:Times:concerning the relationship between growth and inequality. The “trend-break” hypothesis
14:262:21020:27:28:90:509:488:144:Times:144:Times:argues that developments in the last two decades represent an important departure from
14:263:21106:28:27:90:517:460:144:Times:144:Times:the rest of the post-WWII period. According to the most common statement of this view,
14:264:21192:27:28:90:485:433:144:Times:144:Times:the digital computer is the natural candidate for a GPT that began working its way
14:265:21274:28:28:90:497:405:144:Times:144:Times:through the economy in the last two decades. Some economists have argued that this
14:266:21356:28:27:90:480:377:144:Times:144:Times:approach offers a unified explanation for both the productivity slowdown and the
14:267:21436:27:28:90:512:350:144:Times:144:Times:increase in wage inequality (Jeremy Greenwood and Mehmet Yorukoglu, 1997). Others
14:268:21517:28:27:90:511:322:144:Times:144:Times:recognize that it is difficult to explain the difference in the timing of these events with a
14:269:21610:27:28:90:514:295:144:Times:144:Times:single technology shock. The productivity slowdown in the United States was evident in
14:270:21696:28:28:90:503:267:144:Times:144:Times:the data even before the oil shock in the early 1970s. Wage inequality did not begin to
14:271:21783:28:27:90:514:239:144:Times:144:Times:increase until the end of the 1970s. As a result, other proponents of the trend-break view
14:272:21873:27:28:90:499:212:144:Times:144:Times:have used the arrival of the computer to explain just the productivity slowdown (Paul
14:273:21958:28:27:90:477:184:144:Times:144:Times:David, 1991) or just the developments in the labor market (Alan Krueger, 1993).
14:274:22037:27:28:126:518:157:144:Times:144:Times:There are many possible versions of the trend-break position and combinations of
14:275:22117:28:28:90:495:129:144:Times:144:Times:this position with the other positions outlined here. For example, the economy could
14:276:22201:28:0:90:487:101:144:Times:144:Times:cycle back and forth. In periods when a new GPT is being introduced, productivity
15:277:22284:0:28:90:508:709:144:Times:144:Times:growth slows and income inequality could increase. In periods when existing GPTs are
15:278:22368:28:28:90:510:681:144:Times:144:Times:being developed, productivity growth could be more rapid and income inequality could
15:279:22452:28:27:90:505:653:144:Times:144:Times:shrink. Yet over long periods of time, the average behavior of the economy could look
15:280:22537:27:28:90:480:626:144:Times:144:Times:like one characterized by the rising-tide model (Helpman and Trajtenberg, 1994).
15:281:22617:28:27:90:509:598:144:Times:144:Times:Alternatively, the trend break could be imposed on top of a model of an education race,
15:282:22704:27:28:90:361:571:144:Times:144:Times:as suggested by David Autor, Katz, and Krueger (1997).
15:283:22758:28:28:126:513:543:144:Times:144:Times:In this broader context, we can restate our conclusions. Based on the behavior of
15:284:22839:28:27:90:520:515:144:Times:144:Times:wages in the United States and Canada, we see no reason to prefer a trend-break model to
15:285:22927:27:28:90:491:488:144:Times:144:Times:a pure model of an education race with a constant rate of technological change. The
15:286:23010:28:27:90:509:460:144:Times:144:Times:education race model seems to fit the historical data and our evidence on developments
15:287:23096:27:28:90:502:433:144:Times:144:Times:over the last few decades and between the US and Canada. In this sense, our evidence
15:288:23180:28:28:90:505:405:144:Times:144:Times:does not provide any aggregate level support for the first of the two ideas subsumed in
15:289:23267:28:27:90:468:377:144:Times:144:Times:the concept of the GPT — the idea that there are sharp breaks in the process of
15:290:23346:27:28:90:520:350:144:Times:144:Times:technological change. This does not deny the importance of irregularity or trend breaks in
15:291:23436:28:27:90:495:322:144:Times:144:Times:the analysis of technological change at the microeconomic level or in the analysis of
15:292:23521:27:28:90:498:295:144:Times:144:Times:specific technologies like digital computing. It merely suggests that their effects may
15:293:23608:28:28:90:517:267:144:Times:144:Times:average out if there are enough different technologies following independent trajectories.
15:294:23698:28:27:90:482:239:144:Times:144:Times:At the aggregate level, the process may resemble most closely a steady process of
15:295:23779:27:28:90:195:212:144:Times:144:Times:technological change.
15:296:23800:28:27:126:509:184:144:Times:144:Times:Although a steady rate of technological advance does appear to fit best with our
15:297:23880:27:28:90:521:157:144:Times:144:Times:Canadian and U.S. evidence over the entire sample period, we do find some evidence of a
15:298:23967:28:0:90:489:129:144:Times:144:Times:slowdown and speedup phenomenon during relatively brief sub-periods of the U.S.
16:299:24048:0:28:90:495:709:144:Times:144:Times:experience.  As we note later, this evidence appears consistent with some theoretical
16:300:24133:28:28:90:335:681:144:Times:144:Times:predictions of the economy-wide impacts of GPTs.
16:301:24181:28:27:126:515:653:144:Times:144:Times:In developing this position, we are forced to move well outside the framework of
16:302:24261:27:28:90:509:626:144:Times:144:Times:a simple neoclassical model in which one can treat labor as a homogeneous commodity
16:303:24344:28:27:90:519:598:144:Times:144:Times:or treat all factors of production as complements with technology. We allow skilled labor
16:304:24433:27:28:90:513:571:144:Times:144:Times:and unskilled labor to be substitutes for each other and take seriously the possibility that
16:305:24525:28:28:90:515:543:144:Times:144:Times:technological change can reduce the relative or absolute wage for low skilled workers. It
16:306:24614:28:27:90:517:515:144:Times:144:Times:has long been clear that it is theoretically possible for Ricardo’s fears to be realized. (See
16:307:24708:27:28:90:500:488:144:Times:144:Times:for example, Samuelson, 1988.) The evidence from the labor market that we examine
16:308:24789:28:27:90:504:460:144:Times:144:Times:supports Ricardo’s concerns about machinery, or, more precisely, it supports a closely
16:309:24875:27:28:90:507:433:144:Times:144:Times:related concern about technology. It suggests that this concern is of real significance in
16:310:24965:28:28:90:231:405:144:Times:144:Times:practice, not just in principle.
16:311:24997:28:27:126:518:377:144:Times:144:Times:In this sense, we support and extend the revisionist interpretation of technological
16:312:25081:27:28:90:503:350:144:Times:144:Times:change that is implicit in the concept of a GPT. In the neo-classical growth model and
16:313:25167:28:27:90:499:322:144:Times:144:Times:simple endogenous growth models, technological advance tends to raise the marginal
16:314:25249:27:28:90:499:295:144:Times:144:Times:productivity of all factors of production, and growth proceeds in a smooth fashion by
16:315:25334:28:28:90:511:267:144:Times:144:Times:scaling up the marginal productivity of all factors of production. The new interpretation
16:316:25423:28:27:90:491:239:144:Times:144:Times:implicit in the concept of a GPT is that new technologies cause large changes in the
16:317:25507:27:28:90:522:212:144:Times:144:Times:relative marginal productivity of different inputs. These changes in relative returns induce
16:318:25599:28:27:90:506:184:144:Times:144:Times:large changes in prices and offsetting changes in patterns of investment throughout the
16:319:25686:27:28:90:481:157:144:Times:144:Times:economy. Our interpretation of the evidence in terms of an education race is fully
16:320:25768:28:0:90:482:129:144:Times:144:Times:consistent with this second thread in the concept of a general purpose technology.
17:321:25852:0:45:90:146:707:197:Helvetica:197:Helvetica:2. Model
17:322:25860:45:28:126:484:662:144:Times:144:Times:The basic model that we use to motivate our analysis starts with a constant
17:323:25935:28:27:90:503:634:144:Times:144:Times:elasticity of substitution aggregator that depends on university-educated labor,  H, and
17:324:26023:27:28:90:511:607:144:Times:144:Times:high school-educated labor,  L. Because we are interested in the effects of technological
17:325:26112:28:27:90:501:579:144:Times:144:Times:change, not its sources, we will represent technological change in terms of exogenous
17:326:26197:27:28:90:496:552:144:Times:144:Times:functions of time. Specifically, we characterize technological change in terms of two
17:327:26282:28:28:90:507:524:144:Times:144:Times:functions of time,  A(t) and B(t). The first augments the services of university-educated
17:328:26371:28:27:90:470:496:144:Times:144:Times:workers; the second augments high school-educated workers. Then we nest the
17:329:26446:27:28:90:517:469:144:Times:144:Times:expression for labor inside a Cobb-Douglas function that depends on this labor aggregate
17:330:26534:28:54:90:202:441:144:Times:144:Times:and physical capital, K:

17:352:26624:62:28:126:509:305:144:Times:144:Times:When we use this kind of single-sector, aggregate production function, we must
17:353:26702:28:27:90:498:277:144:Times:144:Times:be clear about what it means. At time t, F(K,H,L,t)  represents the maximum possible
17:354:26786:27:28:90:471:250:144:Times:144:Times:output for an economy with total resources K, H, and L.  This kind of aggregate
17:355:26865:28:27:90:509:222:144:Times:144:Times:production function is always well defined.  However, there is no reason to believe that
17:356:26953:27:28:90:514:195:144:Times:144:Times:actual economies satisfy the assumptions from aggregation theory necessary for us to be
17:357:27040:28:28:90:521:167:144:Times:144:Times:able to give this aggregate production any simple interpretation in terms of the production
17:358:27131:28:28:90:231:139:144:Times:144:Times:functions of individual firms.
17:359:27161:28:29:126:487:111:144:Times:144:Times:For example, the parameter  σ,  which controls the elasticity of substitution
17:360:27238:29:0:90:512:82:144:Times:144:Times:between  H and L  in the aggregate economy, may not be closely related to the elasticity
18:361:27328:0:28:90:499:709:144:Times:144:Times:of substitution faced by an individual firm. Shifts between firms or industries may be
18:362:27414:28:28:90:506:681:144:Times:144:Times:more important than shifts within firms. Similarly, one cannot necessarily interpret the
18:363:27502:28:27:90:480:653:144:Times:144:Times:aggregate augmentation factors A(t) and B(t) in terms of standard microeconomic
18:364:27581:27:28:90:496:626:144:Times:144:Times:processes of technological change. At the firm level, one would typically impose the
18:365:27665:28:27:90:513:598:144:Times:144:Times:restriction that technological factors that augment inputs like H and L are monotonically
18:366:27754:27:28:90:484:571:144:Times:144:Times:nondecreasing. In general, this kind of microeconomic assumption does not imply
18:367:27833:28:28:90:418:543:144:Times:144:Times:anything about the behavior of the aggregate functions A(t) and B(t).
18:368:27902:28:27:126:510:515:144:Times:144:Times:We make one final observation. When we apply this model to data from the last
18:369:27979:27:28:90:501:488:144:Times:144:Times:four decades, we will interpret more educated workers H as workers with a university
18:370:28063:28:27:90:514:460:144:Times:144:Times:degree and less educated workers  L  as workers with a high school education. However,
18:371:28149:27:28:90:522:433:144:Times:144:Times:if we wanted to apply the model to earlier historical periods, we would bring in additional
18:372:28240:28:28:90:481:405:144:Times:144:Times:levels of education. What constitutes a less skilled worker changes over time. For
18:373:28322:28:28:90:496:377:144:Times:144:Times:example, if we let M denote workers with only a primary school education, we could
18:374:28404:28:25:90:341:349:144:Times:144:Times:write an extended production function $F as follows:

18:402:28542:53:27:126:495:238:144:Times:144:Times:In the decades from the 1960s to the 1990s, a period of time when university
18:403:28618:27:28:90:515:211:144:Times:144:Times:graduates became a significant fraction of the labor force, changes in the economy made
18:404:28705:28:28:90:501:183:144:Times:144:Times:the factor A(t) grow relatively rapidly and made the factor B(t) grow slowly or shrink.
18:405:28792:28:27:90:480:155:144:Times:144:Times:The number of workers with primary education M  was sufficiently small that the
18:406:28871:27:28:90:490:128:144:Times:144:Times:dominant group in the “less educated” workers is those with high school education.
18:407:28953:28:0:90:486:100:144:Times:144:Times:However, at the turn of the century, an insignificant fraction of the labor force was
19:408:29040:0:28:90:506:709:144:Times:144:Times:university educated. Relatively few workers were high school educated, and they were
19:409:29124:28:28:90:513:681:144:Times:144:Times:relatively more educated compared to workers with only a primary school education. At
19:410:29209:28:27:90:492:653:144:Times:144:Times:that time, changes in the economy were leading to a greater demand for high school
19:411:29291:27:28:90:497:626:144:Times:144:Times:workers. In terms of the model, B(t)  was growing rapidly compared to A(t) and D(t).
19:412:29375:28:27:90:521:598:144:Times:144:Times:(See Goldin 1994, Goldin and Katz, 1995, 1996 for a description of the changes that were
19:413:29463:27:28:90:518:571:144:Times:144:Times:taking place.) Thus, whether a high school-educated worker is a relatively high-skilled or

20:525:30642:30:28:126:515:561:144:Times:144:Times:Except for the illustrative data used in Figure 1, the data for the United States are
20:526:30727:28:27:90:510:533:144:Times:144:Times:the same as those used in Katz and Murphy (1992), so our description will be relatively
20:527:30814:27:28:90:484:506:144:Times:144:Times:brief. We describe the details primarily to illustrate the steps we will take with the
20:528:30900:28:27:90:511:478:144:Times:144:Times:Canadian data. Raw data from the US come from the March Current Population Survey
20:529:30981:27:28:90:522:451:144:Times:144:Times:covering data for years from 1963 to 1987. Katz and Murphy use two different samples to
20:530:31068:28:28:90:518:423:144:Times:144:Times:construct the wage and labor supply series. The preferred wage series tracks as closely as
20:531:31158:28:27:90:492:395:144:Times:144:Times:possible the wage for a homogenous group of workers, so the sample is restricted to
20:532:31241:27:28:90:507:368:144:Times:144:Times:people with strong labor market attachment. For labor supply, they use a much broader
20:533:31326:28:27:90:522:340:144:Times:144:Times:sample that reflects total hours, by education category, actually worked in the economy in
20:534:31416:27:28:90:511:313:144:Times:144:Times:each year. The labor supply series include hours worked for essentially all people in the
20:535:31505:28:28:90:115:285:144:Times:144:Times:CPS.
20:536:31509:28:27:126:508:257:144:Times:144:Times:The wage series for high school graduates is based on wages for people with 12
20:537:31587:27:28:90:515:230:144:Times:144:Times:years of schooling. The series for university graduates is based on wages for people who
20:538:31675:28:27:90:521:202:144:Times:144:Times:report having 16 or more years of schooling. After eliminating people who participated in
20:539:31764:27:28:90:481:175:144:Times:144:Times:the labor force less than 39 weeks in the year prior to the March survey, Katz and
20:540:31846:28:28:90:498:147:144:Times:144:Times:Murphy classify workers by sex (2 cells) and years of experience (8 cells). In each of
20:541:31932:28:27:90:522:119:144:Times:144:Times:these 16 cells, they calculate an average wage for each year, then form a wage for all high
20:542:32023:27:0:90:508:92:144:Times:144:Times:school graduates (or all university graduates) by taking a weighted average of wages in
21:543:32112:0:28:90:496:709:144:Times:144:Times:the different cells. The weights are based on the fraction of total hours worked by all
21:544:32199:28:28:90:515:681:144:Times:144:Times:individuals in the cell, averaged over all years in the sample. Because the weights do not
21:545:32289:28:27:90:518:653:144:Times:144:Times:change over time, both the high school and university wage series give an estimate of the
21:546:32378:27:28:90:452:626:144:Times:144:Times:average wage for a pool of workers with fixed demographic characteristics.
21:547:32452:28:27:126:516:598:144:Times:144:Times:To construct the labor supply series, they count hours worked for all workers and
21:548:32533:27:28:90:517:571:144:Times:144:Times:classify them into four categories based on educational attainment: less than 12 years, 12
21:549:32623:28:28:90:518:543:144:Times:144:Times:years, 13-15 years, and 16 or more years of schooling. Labor supply in each of these four
21:550:32712:28:27:90:494:515:144:Times:144:Times:categories is calculated by assuming that workers within these categories are perfect
21:551:32797:27:28:90:509:488:144:Times:144:Times:substitutes and summing up total hours worked using efficiency units based on average
21:552:32882:28:27:90:280:460:144:Times:144:Times:wages for each sex and experience cell.
21:553:32921:27:28:126:477:433:144:Times:144:Times:In the final stage, they aggregate hours worked for these four educational
21:554:32995:28:28:90:494:405:144:Times:144:Times:categories into two series corresponding to hours of work by high school-equivalent
21:555:33078:28:27:90:514:377:144:Times:144:Times:workers and hours worked by university-equivalent workers. Because we do not want to
21:556:33162:27:28:90:516:350:144:Times:144:Times:assume that workers with different levels of education are perfect substitutes, we have to
21:557:33252:28:27:90:493:322:144:Times:144:Times:be careful not to use the wrong procedure to do this aggregation. For example, if we
21:558:33336:27:28:90:506:295:144:Times:144:Times:followed an efficiency units approach, we could assume that a worker with 14 years of
21:559:33421:28:28:90:485:267:144:Times:144:Times:education is a more efficient provider of the kind of labor provided by high school
21:560:33504:28:27:90:512:239:144:Times:144:Times:graduates, and use the ratio of wages for these workers to high school-educated workers
21:561:33591:27:28:90:516:212:144:Times:144:Times:to find the scaling factor. Or we could assume that this worker is a less efficient provider
21:562:33683:28:27:90:511:184:144:Times:144:Times:of the kind of labor provided by university graduates, and use the ratio of their wages to
21:563:33773:27:28:90:419:157:144:Times:144:Times:wages for university graduates to calculate efficiency units for them.
21:564:33843:28:28:126:498:129:144:Times:144:Times:To establish the basic units of measurement, assume that in the United States,
21:565:33921:28:0:90:491:101:144:Times:144:Times:individuals with 12 years of education supply, on average, one hour of high school-
22:566:34006:0:28:90:517:709:144:Times:144:Times:equivalent labor per hour worked. Similarly, assume that someone with 16 or more years
22:567:34092:28:28:90:507:681:144:Times:144:Times:of education supplies one hour of university-equivalent labor per hour worked. To deal
22:568:34178:28:27:90:501:653:144:Times:144:Times:with the other two categories, Katz and Murphy assumed that someone in educational
22:569:34260:27:28:90:510:626:144:Times:144:Times:category  i   supplied  ai   hours, measured in efficiency units, of high school-equivalent
22:570:34350:28:27:90:473:598:144:Times:144:Times:labor per hour worked and bi  hours, measured in efficiency units, of university-
22:571:34431:27:28:90:513:571:144:Times:144:Times:equivalent labor per hour worked. They estimate the coefficients  ai and  bi by running a
22:572:34520:28:28:90:511:543:144:Times:144:Times:regression (with no constant term) of the wage series for people in education category  i
22:573:34609:28:27:90:414:515:144:Times:144:Times:on wages for high school workers and university educated workers:

22:578:34824:44:27:126:516:346:144:Times:144:Times:There are a number of arbitrary choices one must make in constructing aggregate
22:579:34903:27:28:90:508:319:144:Times:144:Times:relative wage and relative supply series. There are valid rationales for different choices
22:580:34993:28:28:90:513:291:144:Times:144:Times:and none of these choices seem to make an important difference to our final results. Our
22:581:35081:28:27:90:501:263:144:Times:144:Times:goal in processing the data for Canada was simply to follow as closely as possible the
22:582:35167:27:28:90:518:236:144:Times:144:Times:treatment that Katz and Murphy used for the data in the United States. However, because
22:583:35254:28:27:90:521:208:144:Times:144:Times:the measurement of educational attainment in the Canadian survey differs from that in the
22:584:35343:27:28:90:493:181:144:Times:144:Times:United States and because the Canadian data are available for fewer years, the exact
22:585:35427:28:28:90:277:153:144:Times:144:Times:procedures we followed differ slightly.
22:586:35466:28:27:126:494:125:144:Times:144:Times:The data for Canada come from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), an
22:587:35537:27:0:90:499:98:144:Times:144:Times:annual supplement to the Labour Force Survey carried out in April of each year. This
23:588:35623:0:28:90:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:annual supplement is very similar to the March CPS. Indeed, these two surveys have been
23:589:35710:28:28:90:510:681:144:Times:144:Times:used in other comparisons of the Canadian and US labor markets. (See for example, the
23:590:35795:28:27:90:516:653:144:Times:144:Times:articles in Card and Freeman, 1993.) The SCF has data on all individuals 15 years of age
23:591:35883:27:28:90:499:626:144:Times:144:Times:and older starting only in 1981. Before that year, hours worked are publicly available
23:592:35969:28:27:90:477:598:144:Times:144:Times:only for heads-of-households, yet reported income is for the entire household. In
23:593:36050:27:28:90:519:571:144:Times:144:Times:addition, this survey did not collect data for 1983. Thus, our sample includes the 13 years
23:594:36141:28:28:90:196:543:144:Times:144:Times:1981-82 and 1984-94.
23:595:36161:28:27:126:496:515:144:Times:144:Times:The SCF does not report years of education. Instead it reports 5 categories of
23:596:36239:27:28:90:521:488:144:Times:144:Times:educational attainment: (1) attended primary school, (2) some high school, (3) some post-
23:597:36328:28:27:90:512:460:144:Times:144:Times:secondary, (4) diploma or certificate from a community college, (5) a university degree.
23:598:36416:27:28:90:474:433:144:Times:144:Times:Throughout this paper, we follow the Canadian usage and distinguish between a
23:599:36493:28:28:90:504:405:144:Times:144:Times:university degree and a college diploma or certificate. A college diploma or certificate
23:600:36581:28:27:90:499:377:144:Times:144:Times:typically requires 2 years whereas a university degree generally requires 3 or 4 years.
23:601:36668:27:28:90:504:350:144:Times:144:Times:(Because students in the province of Ontario typically continue in high school through
23:602:36754:28:27:90:500:322:144:Times:144:Times:grade 13, they may complete the course of study in what one would consider a 4-year
23:603:36837:27:28:90:499:295:144:Times:144:Times:institution in only 3 years.) We treat the average worker with some high school as the
23:604:36923:28:28:90:500:267:144:Times:144:Times:basic unit for high school equivalent labor in Canada. Note that this is a different unit
23:605:37012:28:27:90:512:239:144:Times:144:Times:from the one used in the United States, 12 years of schooling. We allow for a correction
23:606:37100:27:28:90:495:212:144:Times:144:Times:factor that takes account of this and any other stable differences between the US and
23:607:37185:28:27:90:505:184:144:Times:144:Times:Canada. Naturally, we treat the average worker with a university degree as the unit for
23:608:37272:27:28:90:366:157:144:Times:144:Times:measuring hours worked by university-educated workers.
23:609:37326:28:28:126:489:129:144:Times:144:Times:As for the data from the US, we use the survey information on earnings and
23:610:37400:28:0:90:516:101:144:Times:144:Times:weeks of work during the previous year rather than the month of the survey. Because the
24:611:37489:0:28:90:506:709:144:Times:144:Times:SCF does not ask about usual hours worked in the previous year, we simply use weeks
24:612:37572:28:28:90:481:681:144:Times:144:Times:worked instead of total hours as our labor supply measure. The CPS does ask this
24:613:37652:28:27:90:482:653:144:Times:144:Times:question so labor supply for the US is measured in hours worked. For Canada, we
24:614:37731:27:28:90:485:626:144:Times:144:Times:discarded any records with non-positive earnings or weeks worked. We formed an
24:615:37809:28:27:90:514:598:144:Times:144:Times:estimate of total labor supply using a sample that includes everyone with positive weeks
24:616:37897:27:28:90:496:571:144:Times:144:Times:worked. Following the Katz-Murphy treatment of the US data, we formed a separate
24:617:37977:28:28:90:514:543:144:Times:144:Times:sample to estimate the weekly wages (annual earnings divided by weeks worked). In the
24:618:38062:28:27:90:500:515:144:Times:144:Times:wage sample, we included full time, paid workers with 39 or more weeks in the labor
24:619:38145:27:28:90:516:488:144:Times:144:Times:force and who earned at least one half of the full-year, full-time minimum wage earnings
24:620:38233:28:27:90:165:460:144:Times:144:Times:during the year.
24:621:38249:27:28:126:502:433:144:Times:144:Times:We formed cells based on the five educational attainment categories described
24:622:38326:28:28:90:473:405:144:Times:144:Times:above, eight experience categories, and the two sexes. Because the survey gives
24:623:38405:28:27:90:506:377:144:Times:144:Times:educational attainment by broad category rather than by years of education completed,
24:624:38490:27:28:90:508:350:144:Times:144:Times:we subtracted the average years associated with a given level of attainment from age to
24:625:38577:28:27:90:470:322:144:Times:144:Times:form an estimate of years of experience in the labor market for workers in each
24:626:38656:27:28:90:193:295:144:Times:144:Times:educational category.
24:627:38677:28:28:126:497:267:144:Times:144:Times:The SCF made a major change in the educational attainment questions which
24:628:38750:28:27:90:510:239:144:Times:144:Times:affect the years 1989 and after. Although the education questions were much improved,
24:629:38835:27:28:90:505:212:144:Times:144:Times:the pre-1989 and post-1989 data are not comparable. At present, no parallel survey for
24:630:38921:28:27:90:513:184:144:Times:144:Times:estimating independent conversion factors is available. We adjusted the data by fitting a
24:631:39010:27:28:90:516:157:144:Times:144:Times:trend and a post-1989 dummy to each time series. We adjusted the post-1989 data by the
24:632:39096:28:28:90:510:129:144:Times:144:Times:value of the coefficient on the post 1989 dummy. These adjustments do not make much
24:633:39179:28:0:90:508:101:144:Times:144:Times:difference for the real weekly wage series but do matter for the weeks worked series. If
25:634:39269:0:28:90:498:709:144:Times:144:Times:more data becomes available, it would be useful to improve on this crude adjustment
25:635:39352:28:28:90:141:681:144:Times:144:Times:procedure.
25:636:39362:28:27:126:503:653:144:Times:144:Times:The final step is to aggregate our five labor supply series to two series of labor
25:637:39444:27:28:90:517:626:144:Times:144:Times:supply measured in units of high school equivalents and university equivalents. As noted
25:638:39532:28:27:90:495:598:144:Times:144:Times:above, we treated people in the some-high-school category as our reference level for
25:639:39616:27:28:90:487:571:144:Times:144:Times:measuring high school equivalents. That is, we assumed that the average Canadian
25:640:39696:28:28:90:498:543:144:Times:144:Times:worker in the some-high-school category supplied one hour of Canadian high-school
25:641:39777:28:27:90:513:515:144:Times:144:Times:equivalent labor per hour worked. One Canadian high-school equivalent hour will differ
25:642:39863:27:28:90:498:488:144:Times:144:Times:from one US high-school equivalent hour because we defined high school equivalent
25:643:39944:28:27:90:476:460:144:Times:144:Times:workers in the US in terms of people with 12 years of education. If there are any
25:644:40025:27:28:90:517:433:144:Times:144:Times:differences in the quality of the Canadian and US educational systems, this will also lead
25:645:40115:28:28:90:493:405:144:Times:144:Times:to a difference in the two concepts of hours of high-school labor supplied in the two
25:646:40200:28:27:90:489:377:144:Times:144:Times:countries. Finally, labor supply in Canada is in weeks worked. In the US it is hours
25:647:40284:27:28:90:129:350:144:Times:144:Times:worked.
25:648:40291:28:27:126:517:322:144:Times:144:Times:We make an allowance for these differences when we compare the two countries.
25:649:40368:27:28:90:503:295:144:Times:144:Times:We can do this because all of our estimates depend only on the rate of growth of  H/L,
25:650:40454:28:28:90:490:267:144:Times:144:Times:not on its level. In principle, it is possible that a university education has a different
25:651:40544:28:27:90:495:239:144:Times:144:Times:market value in the two countries. Our adjustment allows for this possibility as well,
25:652:40630:27:28:90:382:212:144:Times:144:Times:provided the difference in quality does not change over time.
25:653:40691:28:27:126:513:184:144:Times:144:Times:Table 1 reports the fraction of total weeks worked that are accounted for by each
25:654:40772:27:28:90:479:157:144:Times:144:Times:of the five different education categories in Canada. These fractions are based on
25:655:40854:28:28:90:498:129:144:Times:144:Times:averages taken over all 13 years for which we have data in the 14 years from 1981 to
25:656:40938:28:0:90:521:101:144:Times:144:Times:1994. It also reports the rates of growth of total weeks supplied by people in each of these
26:657:41032:0:28:90:517:709:144:Times:144:Times:categories. Workers with college diplomas or certificates supply slightly more labor than
26:658:41121:28:28:90:484:681:144:Times:144:Times:university graduates and their labor supply grows as rapidly as the labor supply of
26:659:41204:28:28:90:190:653:144:Times:144:Times:university graduates.

26:678:41474:47:28:126:513:473:144:Times:144:Times:Our final challenge is to allocate weeks worked by people in the three remaining
26:679:41554:28:27:90:493:445:144:Times:144:Times:educational categories: primary school, some post-secondary schooling, and college
26:680:41636:27:28:90:515:418:144:Times:144:Times:graduate. As before, we assume that on average, a worker in category  i  supplies a fixed
26:681:41725:28:28:90:503:390:144:Times:144:Times:number  ai  of efficiency units of high school-equivalent hours per week worked and a
26:682:41809:28:27:90:495:362:144:Times:144:Times:fixed number  bi  of efficiency units of university-equivalent labor per week worked.
26:683:41893:27:28:126:507:335:144:Times:144:Times:We have only 13 annual observations on wages for each of the five educational
26:684:41970:28:27:90:492:307:144:Times:144:Times:attainment categories. In addition, wages in Canada do not exhibit the kind of sharp
26:685:42054:27:28:90:522:280:144:Times:144:Times:movements that we see in the United States in the Katz-Murphy sample. For both of these
26:686:42141:28:28:90:521:252:144:Times:144:Times:reasons, any attempt to use a regression to estimate the coefficients in an equation like (6)
26:687:42234:28:27:90:493:224:144:Times:144:Times:is unlikely to yield very precise estimates. As a result, we tried a variety of different
26:688:42323:27:28:90:507:197:144:Times:144:Times:estimates for ai  and  bi  and found that our conclusions were not sensitive to the values
26:689:42411:28:27:90:132:169:144:Times:144:Times:we used.
26:690:42419:27:28:126:506:142:144:Times:144:Times:Workers who have completed a primary school education are relatively easy to
26:691:42495:28:28:90:508:114:144:Times:144:Times:handle. In both countries, wages of primary school-educated workers are little different
26:692:42583:28:0:90:509:86:144:Times:144:Times:from wages for people in some-high-school or 12-year categories. In Canada, they earn
27:693:42670:0:28:90:496:709:144:Times:144:Times:about 98% of the wages for the workers with some high school. In the United States,
27:694:42753:28:28:90:496:681:144:Times:144:Times:workers with less than 12 years of education earn about 94% of the wages earned by
27:695:42835:28:27:90:489:653:144:Times:144:Times:workers with 12 years of education. In each country, we allocated 95% of the labor
27:696:42917:27:28:90:517:626:144:Times:144:Times:supply of workers in the lowest skill category to labor supply for high school equivalents

27:707:43141:39:27:126:498:525:144:Times:144:Times:These are very close to the weights of .94 and -.04 used by Katz and Murphy.
27:708:43217:27:28:90:495:498:144:Times:144:Times:They used weights of .69 and .29 to allocate work effort by workers with some post-
27:709:43300:28:28:90:510:470:144:Times:144:Times:secondary education to high school equivalents and university equivalents respectively.
27:710:43387:28:27:90:502:442:144:Times:144:Times:Because we could not estimate these weights for the some post secondary and college
27:711:43470:27:28:90:515:415:144:Times:144:Times:diploma categories in Canada, we followed the lead of Autor, Katz, and Krueger (1997).
27:712:43556:28:27:90:486:387:144:Times:144:Times:In one of their estimates, they set both of the weights  ai  and  b i   for workers with
27:713:43644:27:28:90:520:360:144:Times:144:Times:education beyond high school equal to 0.5. Like them, we allocated one half of the weeks
27:714:43732:28:28:90:510:332:144:Times:144:Times:worked by workers with some post-secondary education to high school equivalents and
27:715:43815:28:27:90:509:304:144:Times:144:Times:one half to university equivalents. We used these same values for people with a college
27:716:43902:27:28:90:140:277:144:Times:144:Times:education.
27:717:43912:28:27:126:519:249:144:Times:144:Times:Figure 2 illustrates the small difference that it makes when we change the weights
27:718:43994:27:28:90:512:222:144:Times:144:Times:for the United States from the ones estimated by Katz and Murphy to the more arbitrary
27:719:44080:28:28:90:499:194:144:Times:144:Times:ones we used in both samples in our analysis. It plots both the logarithm of the actual

28:809:45189:46:30:90:510:257:144:Times:144:Times:Given a value for σ, we can calculate the time path for g(t) up to a constant term, which
28:810:45278:30:27:90:500:227:144:Times:144:Times:is of no interest. The figure plots the values of g(t) calculated in this way for different
28:811:45369:27:30:90:505:200:144:Times:144:Times:values of σ  and for both the United States and Canada. In their analysis of data for the
28:812:45458:30:29:90:519:170:144:Times:144:Times:United States, Katz and Murphy found a value of σ equal to 1.41. Thus, in this figure, we
28:813:45547:29:29:90:497:141:144:Times:144:Times:plot data for σ equal to 1.25, 1.5, and 2. We have adjusted the vertical position of the
28:814:45635:29:0:90:500:112:144:Times:144:Times:curves to make the graph more readable. The vertical position carries no information.
29:815:45722:0:28:90:497:709:144:Times:144:Times:Only the slope matters.  In addition to the data series, the figure also plots trend lines
29:816:45812:28:28:90:331:681:144:Times:144:Times:calculated from a linear regression of g(t) on time.
29:817:45864:28:27:126:520:653:144:Times:144:Times:If, based on a priori information, one specified that g(t) follows precisely the time
29:818:45949:27:30:90:502:626:144:Times:144:Times:path associated with one of the values of σ, then inference conditional on this path for
29:819:46037:30:29:90:503:596:144:Times:144:Times:g(t)  would select precisely this value of σ. In this sense, we cannot identify σ without
29:820:46126:29:28:90:515:567:144:Times:144:Times:imposing some restriction on the behavior of g(t). There is a one-dimensional continuum
29:821:46213:28:29:90:503:539:144:Times:144:Times:of values for σ and paths for g(t) that will fit the data exactly. Thus, for every possible
29:822:46304:29:29:90:477:510:144:Times:144:Times:value of σ, there is a path for g(t) that would rationalize this value. However, the
29:823:46388:29:28:90:484:481:144:Times:144:Times:converse is not true. Because the set of possible paths is much larger than the one-
29:824:46472:28:30:90:515:453:144:Times:144:Times:dimensional set of possible values for σ, we generally will not be able to find a value for
29:825:46563:30:29:90:503:423:144:Symbol:144:Times:σ that will make an arbitrary path consistent with the data. Thus we can test and reject
29:826:46651:29:27:90:271:394:144:Times:144:Times:hypotheses about the behavior of g(t).
29:827:46689:27:28:121:518:367:144:Times:144:Times:Figure 3 also illustrates one of the basic messages from our analysis. In this figure,
29:828:46775:28:28:90:496:339:144:Times:144:Times:we have not imposed any restriction that forces the slopes of the trend lines to be the
29:829:46862:28:29:90:520:311:144:Times:144:Times:same in Canada and the US for each value of σ. Nevertheless, these slopes are very close.
29:830:46951:29:29:90:514:282:144:Times:144:Times:Also, for all of the illustrated values of σ, the path for g(t) fits a straight line surprisingly
29:831:47048:29:28:90:510:253:144:Times:144:Times:well. The one exception, to which we will return below, arises when g(t) seems to grow
29:832:47134:28:28:90:511:225:144:Times:144:Times:more slowly starting in about 1976 and then grows faster and recovers back to the trend
29:833:47221:28:39:90:189:197:144:Times:144:Times:line starting in 1982.
29:834:47243:39:28:121:503:158:144:Times:144:Times:Figure 4 shows what happens if we impose the restriction that g(t) is equal to gt
29:835:47324:28:29:90:492:130:144:Times:144:Times:and then estimate the parameters σ and g.  This figure plots the actual and predicted
29:836:47409:29:0:90:494:101:144:Times:144:Times:values of the relative wage in the United States and Canada along with the predicted
30:837:47495:0:28:90:510:709:144:Times:144:Times:values from the regression. (To improve readability, note that the values for Canada are
30:838:47583:28:28:90:511:681:144:Times:144:Times:plotted against a scale that is translated vertically downward.)  The regression estimates

30:865:47772:39:28:90:513:567:144:Times:144:Times:We also performed a Chow test to see whether the Canadian and U.S. parameters differ.
30:866:47857:28:28:90:495:539:144:Times:144:Times:The F statistic for testing the null hypothesis that slope and trend coefficients are the
30:867:47946:28:27:90:476:511:144:Times:144:Times:same is F2,33= 1.2. If we impose the Katz-Murphy weights on both countries, the
30:868:48025:27:28:90:505:484:144:Times:144:Times:corresponding statistic is F2,33= 1.4. In either case, we cannot reject the hypothesis that
30:869:48116:28:27:90:229:456:144:Times:144:Times:the coefficients are the same.
30:870:48146:27:28:126:513:429:144:Times:144:Times:In this equation, we have allowed for separate constant terms for Canada and the
30:871:48226:28:28:90:521:401:144:Times:144:Times:US. To account for the differences between the data for the two countries, we assume that
30:872:48315:28:27:90:519:373:144:Times:144:Times:the true value of  H/L  in one country, measured in terms of the definitions from the other
30:873:48406:27:28:90:509:346:144:Times:144:Times:country, differs from our estimate by a constant factor. When we take logarithms of the
30:874:48493:28:27:90:509:318:144:Times:144:Times:relative supply, this factor will be captured in the different values for the constant term.
30:875:48585:27:28:90:516:291:144:Times:144:Times:These will pick up any systematic differences between the measured variables in the two
30:876:48672:28:28:90:137:263:144:Times:144:Times:countries.
30:877:48682:28:28:126:520:235:144:Times:144:Times:Equation 5, which we repeat below, helps us illustrate why the data imposes some
30:878:48762:28:37:90:483:207:144:Times:144:Times:restrictions on the trend process even though σ is not, strictly speaking, identified.

31:901:48891:0:28:90:519:709:144:Times:144:Times:Roughly speaking, we ask whether the data are consistent with the restriction imposed by
31:902:48979:28:28:90:507:681:144:Times:144:Times:this equation, and test it against the alternative that the trend rate of growth  g  takes on
31:903:49072:28:27:90:378:653:144:Times:144:Times:different values in the first and second halves of the sample.
31:904:49134:27:28:126:513:626:144:Times:144:Times:Figure 5 gives an alternative representation of the data represented in Figure 2, a
31:905:49217:28:27:90:503:598:144:Times:144:Times:representation that is suggested by equation 5. This figure collapses the data into three
31:906:49306:27:28:90:512:571:144:Times:144:Times:key periods in the US data and adds a fourth data point for Canada. The three periods in
31:907:49394:28:28:90:493:543:144:Times:144:Times:the US were determined by picking the turning points in the predicted relative wage
31:908:49477:28:27:90:509:515:144:Times:144:Times:series in Figure 4. After aggregating the data into these four points, we can put them on
31:909:49566:27:28:90:497:488:144:Times:144:Times:the scatter diagram suggested by equation 5. According to this equation, these points
31:910:49651:28:29:90:506:460:144:Times:144:Times:should fit on a straight line with slope −1σ and should have an intercept g. As Figure 2
31:911:49739:29:27:90:496:431:144:Times:144:Times:suggests, the data are roughly consistent with this characterization. We could also fit
31:912:49826:27:28:90:495:404:144:Times:144:Times:these four points with four different lines that have the same slope and four different
31:913:49913:28:27:90:505:376:144:Times:144:Times:intercepts. These intercepts will correspond to the implied values for  g in each period.
31:914:50002:27:28:90:471:349:144:Times:144:Times:However, as Figure 5 shows, we will not be able to do so in a way that makes g
31:915:50080:28:28:90:498:321:144:Times:144:Times:consistently different in the first and second halves of the sample. For example, if we
31:916:50167:28:29:90:493:293:144:Times:144:Times:make the slope of the line flatter by making σ larger, it will impose a relatively high
31:917:50254:29:28:90:491:264:144:Times:144:Times:value of  g  in the 1960s and 1980s in the US and a relatively low value for g  in the
31:918:50340:28:27:90:303:236:144:Times:144:Times:1970s in the US and in the 1980s in Canada.
31:919:50383:27:28:126:510:209:144:Times:144:Times:If we want to conduct a formal test for a break in the trend, we face the problem
31:920:50464:28:27:90:475:181:144:Times:144:Times:of picking the point where we split the sample and the more difficult problem of
31:921:50544:27:28:90:520:154:144:Times:144:Times:interpreting the results. Figure 6 represents the results from a series of t-tests for a change
31:922:50639:28:28:90:483:126:144:Times:144:Times:in the value of  g . For each point in the bottom curve in the graph, we estimated a
31:923:50723:28:0:90:494:98:144:Times:144:Times:separate regression with a dummy variable interacted with the trend term. In each of
32:924:50809:0:28:90:520:709:144:Times:144:Times:these regressions, the dummy allows for a break in a different year. We ran these tests for
32:925:50900:28:28:90:517:681:144:Times:144:Times:all years from 1968 to 1987. Each point on this bottom curve corresponds to the estimate
32:926:50988:28:27:90:499:653:144:Times:144:Times:of this term. It can be interpreted as the change in the value of g for all years after the
32:927:51079:27:28:90:502:626:144:Times:144:Times:date corresponding to the point. The points that have a t-statistic that is less than 2 are
32:928:51170:28:27:90:521:598:144:Times:144:Times:marked with triangles and connected with lines. The points with a t statistic greater than 2
32:929:51262:27:28:90:368:571:144:Times:144:Times:are marked with squares and are not connected with lines.
32:930:51319:28:28:126:518:543:144:Times:144:Times:From this figure, we can infer that a test for a trend break starting in 1974 to 1977
32:931:51404:28:27:90:507:515:144:Times:144:Times:would find a statistically significant slowdown in the rate at which the relative demand
32:932:51492:27:28:90:505:488:144:Times:144:Times:for more educated labor has been growing. In contrast, a test in the years 1981 to 1985
32:933:51579:28:27:90:508:460:144:Times:144:Times:would find a statistically significant increase in the rate at which the relative demand is
32:934:51670:27:28:90:514:433:144:Times:144:Times:increasing. This slowdown and speedup are parallel to the slowdown and speedup in the
32:935:51755:28:28:90:520:405:144:Times:144:Times:paths for g(t)  that we observed in Figure 3. By comparing the predicted and actual values
32:936:51845:28:27:90:498:377:144:Times:144:Times:for the real wage, one can see in Figure 6 another manifestation of this same process.
32:937:51931:27:28:90:506:350:144:Times:144:Times:Between about 1976 and 1981, the changes in relative supplies imply a higher value of
32:938:52016:28:27:90:466:322:144:Times:144:Times:the relative wage than the actual value. The estimated trend breaks are another
32:939:52095:27:28:90:495:295:144:Times:144:Times:manifestation of the fact that the regression estimates over-predict wages during this
32:940:52181:28:28:90:509:267:144:Times:144:Times:period. If we estimate a coefficient for a slowdown in g in 1976 and a speedup in 1981,
32:941:52268:28:27:90:513:239:144:Times:144:Times:both of these coefficients are statistically significant. In 1981, the rate returns back to its
32:942:52363:27:28:90:488:212:144:Times:144:Times:previous value, as Figure 3 suggests. This formulation with both a slowdown and a
32:943:52444:28:27:90:504:184:144:Times:144:Times:speedup best captures the behavior of the data.  Although it is not clear that we should
32:944:52532:27:28:90:464:157:144:Times:144:Times:interpret this as evidence of a trend-break, this type of slowdown and speedup
32:945:52610:28:28:90:521:129:144:Times:144:Times:phenomenon may be consistent with some theoretical predictions of the impacts of GPTs,
32:946:52696:28:0:90:448:101:144:Times:144:Times:such as those in the model developed by Helpman and Trajtenberg (1994).
33:947:52769:0:31:90:174:707:197:Helvetica:197:Helvetica:Conclusions
33:948:52780:31:28:126:509:676:144:Times:144:Times:There are two ways to interpret the inconsistency between our results and direct
33:949:52860:28:27:90:506:648:144:Times:144:Times:productivity measures, which find a significant slowdown after the early 1970s.  In the
33:950:52947:27:28:90:512:621:144:Times:144:Times:first interpretation, the direct productivity measures are telling us that the rate of growth
33:951:53040:28:28:90:516:593:144:Times:144:Times:of the functions A(t) and B(t) has decreased since the 1970s; the labor market evidence is
33:952:53130:28:27:90:479:565:144:Times:144:Times:telling us that the rate of growth of the difference A(t)-B(t) does not seem to have
33:953:53214:27:28:90:499:538:144:Times:144:Times:changed. That is, productivity growth has slowed down but the rate of increase in the
33:954:53299:28:27:90:506:510:144:Times:144:Times:skill bias in technology has not. In the second interpretation, the rate of growth has not
33:955:53389:27:28:90:507:483:144:Times:144:Times:changed for either A(t) or B(t). This explains the labor market evidence which points to
33:956:53477:28:28:90:516:455:144:Times:144:Times:no break in the factor bias of technology. The evidence of a productivity slowdown must
33:957:53564:28:27:90:517:427:144:Times:144:Times:therefore be the result of price mismeasurement that has been getting steadily worse over
33:958:53653:27:28:90:465:400:144:Times:144:Times:time. Our results by themselves offer no basis for choosing between these two
33:959:53730:28:27:90:493:372:144:Times:144:Times:explanations. However, until a few years ago, the second possibility was given little
33:960:53815:27:28:90:482:345:144:Times:144:Times:serious consideration in the economics profession. We interpret our results as one
33:961:53897:28:28:90:492:317:144:Times:144:Times:additional bit of evidence suggesting that this second interpretation deserves careful
33:962:53983:28:27:90:489:289:144:Times:144:Times:consideration. We need to convert the productivity slowdown from a fact about the
33:963:54064:27:28:90:518:262:144:Times:144:Times:economy that needs to be explained into a hypothesis about the economy that needs to be
33:964:54151:28:27:90:204:234:144:Times:144:Times:more fully investigated.
33:965:54175:27:28:126:520:207:144:Times:144:Times:Regardless of which of these interpretations is correct, the evidence provided here
33:966:54258:28:28:90:462:179:144:Times:144:Times:offers additional support for the claim that over time, the cumulative effect of
33:967:54338:28:27:90:479:151:144:Times:144:Times:technological change has been to increase the relative demand for more educated
33:968:54417:27:28:90:503:124:144:Times:144:Times:workers. The evidence presented here also suggests that the relative earnings of more-
33:969:54503:28:0:90:492:96:144:Times:144:Times:and less-educated workers respond to changes in their relative supply, i.e. that labor
34:970:54591:0:28:90:513:709:144:Times:144:Times:demand is sensitive to the price of labor.  Because they can influence the relative supply
34:971:54681:28:28:90:465:681:144:Times:144:Times:of more and less educated workers, governments control powerful policies for
34:972:54757:28:27:90:495:653:144:Times:144:Times:counteracting this unwanted side effect of technological progress. Policies like those
34:973:54843:27:28:90:502:626:144:Times:144:Times:followed in Canada — policies that facilitated during the past two decades substantial
34:974:54929:28:27:90:516:598:144:Times:144:Times:growth in post-secondary education at both the college and university levels — can have
34:975:55016:27:28:90:521:571:144:Times:144:Times:a major effect on wage inequality.  Our results imply that in the absence of this expansion
34:976:55107:28:28:90:478:543:144:Times:144:Times:of educational attainment Canada would have experienced an increase in income
34:977:55184:28:27:90:500:515:144:Times:144:Times:inequality between the more- and less-educated similar to that observed in the United
34:978:55269:27:0:90:122:488:144:Times:144:Times:States.
