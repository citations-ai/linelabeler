2:21:469:20:20:68:522:484:12:Times:12:Times:B:Since the early 1970s there has been a worldwide upsurge in the price of energy and in particular 
2:22:567:20:21:68:496:464:12:Times:12:Times:B:of gasoline. Therefore, demand functions for energy and its components like gasoline have 
2:23:657:21:20:68:490:443:12:Times:12:Times:B:received much attention.  However, since confidence in the estimated demand functions is 
2:24:746:20:20:68:503:423:12:Times:12:Times:B:important for use in policy and forecasting, following Amarawickrama and Hunt (2008), this 
2:25:837:20:20:68:506:403:12:Times:12:Times:B:paper estimates the demand for gasoline is estimated with 6 alternative time series techniques 
2:26:932:20:20:68:488:383:12:Times:12:Times:B:with data from Fiji.   Estimates with these 6 alternative techniques are very close and thus 
2:27:1025:20:20:68:492:363:12:Times:12:Times:B:increase our confidence in them.  We found that gasoline demand is both price and income 
2:28:1114:20:21:68:116:343:12:Times:12:Times:B:inelastic.

3:35:1216:0:20:68:146:725:12:Times:12:Times:B:1. Introduction 
3:36:1232:20:20:68:71:705:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
3:37:1232:20:20:68:527:685:12:Times:12:Times:B:Since the early 1970s there has been a worldwide upsurge in the price of energy and in particular  
3:38:1331:20:20:68:503:665:12:Times:12:Times:B:of gasoline. Many researchers, therefore, have estimated demand functions for energy and its 
3:39:1424:20:20:68:495:645:12:Times:12:Times:B:components of which the gasoline has received much attention.1 The main purpose of these 
3:40:1513:20:20:68:517:625:12:Times:12:Times:B:studies has been to understand how the demand for gasoline has responded to price changes and 
3:41:1607:20:21:68:511:605:12:Times:12:Times:B:whether the income and price elasticities of demand are elastic or inelastic. This information is 
3:42:1705:21:20:68:487:584:12:Times:12:Times:B:useful to forecast demand for gasoline and also for determining taxes to reduce demand if 
3:43:1795:20:20:68:519:564:12:Times:12:Times:B:necessary. Therefore, it is necessary to have some confidence in the estimates of the parameters 
3:44:1892:20:20:68:522:544:12:Times:12:Times:B:and this confidence can be increased if alternative methods of estimation yield similar estimates. 
3:45:1991:20:20:68:479:524:12:Times:12:Times:B:This is the main objective of our paper and is similar to the purpose of a recent study by 
3:46:2082:20:20:68:431:504:12:Times:12:Times:B:Amarawickrama and Hunt (2008) of the demand for electricity in Sri Lanka.  
3:47:2157:20:20:68:71:484:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
3:48:2157:20:21:68:525:464:12:Times:12:Times:B:In this process we also highlight a few neglected issues in estimating the demand for gasoline and 
3:49:2256:21:20:68:509:443:12:Times:12:Times:B:energy. One of these issues is endogeniety of the explanatory variables viz., income and price. 
3:50:2352:20:20:68:503:423:12:Times:12:Times:B:This may lead to biases in the estimates in the single equation time series methods. A second 
3:51:2446:20:20:68:482:403:12:Times:12:Times:B:issue is the reliability of the estimated standard errors in finite samples although they are 
3:52:2540:20:20:68:515:383:12:Times:12:Times:B:asymptotically efficient in all methods. Some exceptions in the energy demand studies to these 
3:53:2635:20:20:68:511:363:12:Times:12:Times:B:limitations are Polemis (2006) for the demand for gasoline in Greece and Amarawickrama and 
3:54:2726:20:21:68:331:343:12:Times:12:Times:B:Hunt (2008) in the demand for electricity in Sri Lanka.  
3:55:2783:21:20:68:71:322:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
3:56:2783:20:20:68:491:302:12:Times:12:Times:B:The above two issues are partly methodological in nature and it is worth stating briefly the 
3:57:2876:20:20:68:511:282:12:Times:12:Times:B:general conclusions reached by Inder’s (1993) Monte Carlo simulation study. Firstly, he found 
3:58:2970:20:20:68:495:262:12:Times:12:Times:B:that although the popular Engle and Granger (1987) two-step procedure gives unbiased and 
3:59:3059:20:20:68:512:242:12:Times:12:Times:B:efficient estimates in finite samples, these properties can be improved if an over-parameterized 
3:60:3156:20:20:68:484:222:12:Times:12:Times:B:dynamic equation is estimated in the first stage to derive the equilibrium or cointegration 
3:61:3248:20:44:68:509:202:12:Times:12:Times:B:equation. In the second stage the short run equation can be estimated with the lagged residuals 
3:62:3344:44:7:68:212:158:12:Times:12:Times:B:                                                   
3:63:3394:7:21:68:506:151:6:Times:10:Times:F:1  A quick search for energy demand papers produced 95 references from Science Direct journals alone of which 
3:64:3504:21:17:68:252:130:10:Times:10:Times:F:more than half are on the demand for gasoline. 
3:65:3551:17:0:68:70:113:10:Times:10:Times:F: 
4:66:3552:0:20:68:508:725:12:Times:12:Times:B:from this first stage cointegrating equation.2 The modified Engle-Granger method is known as 
4:67:3645:20:20:68:515:705:12:Times:12:Times:B:dynamic Engle-Granger method (DEG). Secondly, Inder (1993) also found that the Phillips and 
4:68:3737:20:20:68:518:685:12:Times:12:Times:B:Hansen (1990) alternative with a semi-parametric correction did not yield unbiased and efficient 
4:69:3834:20:20:68:517:665:12:Times:12:Times:B:estimates in finite samples. However, this approach is attractive because it is easy to implement 
4:70:3932:20:20:68:506:645:12:Times:12:Times:B:and known as the fully modified OLS (FMOLS) approach.  Inder (1993) found that the Monte 
4:71:4021:20:20:68:498:625:12:Times:12:Times:B:Carlo exercise conducted by Phillips and Hansen is somewhat biased in favour of FMOLS.  
4:72:4109:20:21:68:71:605:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
4:73:4109:21:20:68:524:584:12:Times:12:Times:B:Amarawickrama and Hunt have provided a useful summary of the relative merits of  6 alternative 
4:74:4204:20:20:68:523:564:12:Times:12:Times:B:time series estimation methods: (1) Static Engle and Granger (1987),(SEG) method, (2) Dynamic 
4:75:4298:20:20:68:512:544:12:Times:12:Times:B:Engle and Granger (1987), (DEG) method, (3) Fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) 
4:76:4388:20:20:68:492:524:12:Times:12:Times:B:method, Pesaran, Shin and Smith’s (2001) bounds test (BT) method, (5) Johansen’s (1988) 
4:77:4476:20:20:68:498:504:12:Times:12:Times:B:maximum likelihood method (JML), which is a systems method and minimizes endogenous 
4:78:4560:20:20:68:482:484:12:Times:12:Times:B:variable bias, and (6) an alternative approach advocated by Harvey (1997), known as the 
4:79:4648:20:21:68:515:464:12:Times:12:Times:B:Structured time series method (STSM). In this last method trend is treated as stochastic whereas 
4:80:4745:21:20:68:508:443:12:Times:12:Times:B:in all other methods trend is deterministic.3 Two methods not examined by them are the Stock 
4:81:4838:20:20:68:509:423:12:Times:12:Times:B:and Watson (1988) dynamic ordinary least squares method (DOLS) and the general to specific 
4:82:4929:20:20:68:478:403:12:Times:12:Times:B:approach (GETS) of  the London School of Economics; see footnote 2. Thus there are 8 
4:83:5014:20:20:68:505:383:12:Times:12:Times:B:alternative methods to estimate time series models. In principle all these methods should give 
4:84:5109:20:20:68:509:363:12:Times:12:Times:B:similar estimates of the coefficients in large samples i.e., their asymptotic properties should be 
4:85:5208:20:21:68:522:343:12:Times:12:Times:B:similar. However, their finite sample properties may differ and the more substantial problems are 
4:86:5306:21:20:68:495:322:12:Times:12:Times:B:biases due to endogeneity and lack of power of the cointegrating tests against the null of no 
4:87:5400:20:20:68:521:302:12:Times:12:Times:B:cointegration. These issues can only be resolved by undertaking exhaustive Monte Carlo studies 
4:88:5495:20:20:68:413:282:12:Times:12:Times:B:similar to Inder (1993) and Banerjee, Dolado, Hendry  and Smith (1986). 
4:89:5567:20:20:68:71:262:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
4:90:5567:20:7:68:212:242:12:Times:12:Times:B:                                                   
4:91:5617:7:21:68:501:235:6:Times:10:Times:F:2 This solution is somewhat similar to Banerjee, Dolado,  Hendry  and Smith (1986) where they argued that the 
4:92:5727:21:17:68:517:214:10:Times:10:Times:F:London School of Economic method, known as the general to specific approach (GETS), of which Professor David 
4:93:5836:17:17:68:515:197:10:Times:10:Times:F:Hendry is the most ardent exponent, is efficient with good finite sample properties. In GETS both the cointegrating 
4:94:5952:17:17:68:519:180:10:Times:10:Times:F:equation and the short run dynamics are estimated in one step by estimating an over-parameterized equation at first. 
4:95:6069:17:16:68:454:163:10:Times:10:Times:F:Then a parsimonious specification is derived by deleting the insignificant changes in the variables.

4:97:6170:13:21:68:515:134:6:Times:10:Times:F:3 An easy to understand exposition of the methodological nature of the controversy on how to model trend see Rao 
4:98:6283:21:0:68:99:113:10:Times:10:Times:F:(2009). 
5:99:6292:0:20:68:519:725:12:Times:12:Times:B: The outline of this paper can be stated as follows. Section 2 reviews selected previous works. In 
5:100:6391:20:20:68:521:705:12:Times:12:Times:B:Section 3 we present estimates of the demand for gasoline in Fiji with DEG, GETS, FMOLS, BT 
5:101:6482:20:20:68:522:685:12:Times:12:Times:B:and JML.4 We have neglected the other methods to limit the length of this paper. Comparisons of 
5:102:6578:20:20:68:506:665:12:Times:12:Times:B:estimates with these 5 methods should be adequate to reveal any differences that are likely to 
5:103:6673:20:20:68:355:645:12:Times:12:Times:B:exist in the estimates of the parameters. Section 4 concludes.

5:106:6775:20:20:68:71:584:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
5:107:6775:20:20:68:503:564:12:Times:12:Times:B:We have selected a few recent studies on the demand for gasoline because most of the earlier 
5:108:6868:20:20:68:513:544:12:Times:12:Times:B:studies have been adequately reviewed in some of these recent works like Amarawickrama and 
5:109:6959:20:20:68:337:524:12:Times:12:Times:B:Hunt (2008) and Akinboade, Ziramba and Kumo (2008). 
5:110:7010:20:20:68:328:504:12:Times:12:Times:B:  
5:111:7010:20:20:68:483:484:12:Times:12:Times:B:Studies on the gasoline demand functions predominantly estimated the price and income 
5:112:7096:20:21:68:519:464:12:Times:12:Times:B:elasticities of demand using different methodologies and time series techniques.  Most estimates 
5:113:7193:21:20:68:482:443:12:Times:12:Times:B:of price and income elasticities do not provide a consensus on the short run and long run 
5:114:7283:20:16:68:508:423:12:Times:12:Times:B:elasticity estimates. Sterner and Dahl (1990) surveyed over a hundred past studies on gasoline 
5:115:7378:16:8:68:212:407:12:Times:12:Times:B:                                                   
5:116:7428:8:23:68:517:399:8:Times:10:Times:F:4 We have selected GETS for the following reasons. Firstly, the cointegrating equation and the dynamic adjustment 
5:117:7541:23:17:68:514:376:10:Times:10:Times:F:equation can be estimated in one step. Secondly, GETS can be estimated with the instrumental variables method to 
5:118:7654:17:16:68:478:359:10:Times:10:Times:F:minimize the endogenous variables bias. Thirdly, it is possible to estimate by imposing constraints on the 
5:119:7761:16:17:68:499:343:10:Times:10:Times:F:coefficients and this is not easy in other methods although one can test for the validity of the constraints on the 
5:120:7877:17:17:68:520:326:10:Times:10:Times:F:parameters in JML. This option is especially useful for incorporating structural breaks in trend and the cointegrating 
5:121:7996:17:17:68:510:309:10:Times:10:Times:F:vector. Finally, it is not necessary to pretest the variables for unit roots under the original interpretation of GETS. 
5:122:8116:17:16:68:500:292:10:Times:10:Times:F:Before the time series econometrics became popular, GETS was seen as an alternative to the partial adjustment 
5:123:8225:16:17:68:505:276:10:Times:10:Times:F:method of estimating equilibrium relationships with disequilibrium data. Therefore, GETS  specifications can be 
5:124:8337:17:17:68:503:259:10:Times:10:Times:F:estimated with the standard classical methods. However, this has been neglected after the popularity of the time 
5:125:8450:17:17:68:516:242:10:Times:10:Times:F:series methods. Belatedly Ericsson and MacKinnon (2002) have developed a cointegrating test giving a time series 
5:126:8563:17:17:68:485:225:10:Times:10:Times:F:interpretation to GETS .  We shall use both approaches noting that pretesting is necessary under the second 
5:127:8671:17:17:68:125:208:10:Times:10:Times:F:interpretation. 
5:128:8687:17:11:68:70:191:10:Times:10:Times:F: 
5:129:8687:11:17:68:496:180:10:Times:10:Times:F:We have selected BT for two reasons. Firstly it is popular in applied work because pretesting is not necessary. 
5:130:8799:17:16:68:520:163:10:Times:10:Times:F:Secondly,  it does not seem to have been applied correctly in some if not all the applied papers. Although we are not 
5:131:8917:16:17:68:506:147:10:Times:10:Times:F:aware of any Monte Carlo study on its finite properties, Turner (2006) has computed the critical values for small 
5:132:9031:17:17:68:517:130:10:Times:10:Times:F:samples using the surface response approach of MacKinnon (1991) which is more appropriate than others based on 
5:133:9142:17:0:68:436:113:10:Times:10:Times:F:unexplained criteria. Only the asymptotic critical values are tabulated in the Microfit manual.  
6:134:9240:0:20:68:479:725:12:Times:12:Times:B:demand. The models ranged from static to dynamic partial adjustment models to lagged 
6:135:9325:20:20:68:523:705:12:Times:12:Times:B:endogenous models with variations in the use of explanatory variables. All studies have used real 
6:136:9423:20:20:68:514:685:12:Times:12:Times:B:income and real price of gasoline as the explanatory variables in the model.  Some studies have 
6:137:9519:20:20:68:518:665:12:Times:12:Times:B:taken stock of vehicles or proxied automobile size for vehicle efficiency in the model. The price 
6:138:9617:20:20:68:515:645:12:Times:12:Times:B:elasticity estimates in the short run ranged from -0.12 to -0.41, implying a highly price inelastic 
6:139:9717:20:20:68:495:625:12:Times:12:Times:B:demand. The long run estimates are more elastic, ranging from -0.23 to – 0.97. The income 
6:140:9807:20:21:68:492:605:12:Times:12:Times:B:elasticity of demand in the short run is insensitive to income, income elasticity coefficients 
6:141:9902:21:20:68:508:584:12:Times:12:Times:B:ranging from 0.14 to 0.58. The long run income elasticity coefficients range from 0.6 to 1.315. 
6:142:9998:20:20:68:504:564:12:Times:12:Times:B:These results provide estimates with a wide range. After stratifying the models into ten broad 
6:143:10093:20:20:68:520:544:12:Times:12:Times:B:categories, Sterner and Dahl were able to provide alternative estimates for the long run and short 
6:144:10192:20:20:68:521:524:12:Times:12:Times:B:run. They conclude that there is strong evidence that gasoline consumption is responsive to price 
6:145:10290:20:20:68:216:504:12:Times:12:Times:B:and income albeit inelastically. 
6:146:10323:20:20:68:71:484:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
6:147:10323:20:21:68:524:464:12:Times:12:Times:B:Wasserfallen and Ghtensperger (1988) estimated the demand for gasoline with the stock of motor 
6:148:10418:21:20:68:518:443:12:Times:12:Times:B:vehicles as the explanatory variable for the Swiss economy. They showed that an increase in the 
6:149:10514:20:20:68:515:423:12:Times:12:Times:B:stock of cars by 1% increases gasoline consumption by 0.75 %.  Sterner and Dahl (1990) report 
6:150:10608:20:20:68:516:403:12:Times:12:Times:B:that vehicle elasticity ranges from 0.40 to 0.91 from their survey of gasoline demand functions. 
6:151:10705:20:20:68:523:383:12:Times:12:Times:B:Bentzan (1994) reported that the magnitudes of price elasticities in the short and long run are       
6:152:10807:20:20:68:497:363:12:Times:12:Times:B:-0.32 and -0.41, respectively. The possible differences in estimates for the income and price 
6:153:10901:20:21:68:499:343:12:Times:12:Times:B:elasticities in various studies have been attributed to differences in modeling techniques and 
6:154:10996:21:20:68:270:322:12:Times:12:Times:B:different time periods used for estimation.  
6:155:11041:20:20:68:71:302:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
6:156:11041:20:20:68:494:282:12:Times:12:Times:B:While Sterner and Dahl (1990) surveyed several important studies prior to 1990’s, Polemis 
6:157:11131:20:20:68:512:262:12:Times:12:Times:B:(2006) has provided an overview a number of studies during the 1990s to early 20006.  Most of 
6:158:11225:20:20:68:523:242:12:Times:12:Times:B:the studies have been on either the OECD countries or some developed countries. We review two 
6:159:11319:20:20:68:265:222:12:Times:12:Times:B:studies here on the developing countries.  
6:160:11362:20:15:68:71:202:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
6:161:11362:15:8:68:212:187:12:Times:12:Times:B:                                                   
6:162:11412:8:21:68:526:179:6:Times:10:Times:F:5 Akinboade, Ziramba and Kumo (2008) also find long run estimates of price elasticities ranging from -0.12 to -0.464 
6:163:11529:21:17:68:263:158:10:Times:10:Times:F:and income elasticity ranging from 0.12 to 2.68.   
6:164:11580:17:7:68:70:141:10:Times:10:Times:F: 
6:165:11580:7:21:68:497:134:6:Times:10:Times:F:6 For example, Bentzen (1994), Ramanathan (1999),  Nicol (2003), Fouquet et al (1997) and Alves and Bueno 
6:166:11686:21:0:68:237:113:10:Times:10:Times:F:(2003), quoted in Sterner and Dahl (1990). 
7:167:11730:0:20:68:515:725:12:Times:12:Times:B:Alves and Bueno (2003) estimated the elasticities for gasoline demand for Brazil. In their study 
7:168:11827:20:20:68:505:705:12:Times:12:Times:B:they extended the previous studies by estimating the cross price elasticity of demand between 
7:169:11921:20:20:68:492:685:12:Times:12:Times:B:gasoline and alcohol. They found that gasoline and alcohol are imperfect substitutes. Their 
7:170:12013:20:20:68:491:665:12:Times:12:Times:B:estimates of price elasticities are close to the estimates by Eltony and Al-Mutairi (1995) in 
7:171:12107:20:20:68:496:645:12:Times:12:Times:B:Kuwait (-0.463) and Ramanathan (1999) in India (-0.319). But they find low long and short 
7:172:12197:20:20:68:508:625:12:Times:12:Times:B:income elasticities for Brazil (0.122 and 0.122 respectively) when compared to Kuwait (1.617 
7:173:12290:20:21:68:514:605:12:Times:12:Times:B:and 0.319) respectively) and India (2.682 and 1.178 respectively). Alves and Bueno (2003) and 
7:174:12384:21:20:68:361:584:12:Times:12:Times:B:Ramanthan have used the two step Engle and Granger (1987). 
7:175:12443:20:20:68:71:564:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
7:176:12443:20:20:68:521:544:12:Times:12:Times:B:Akinboade and Kumo (2008) applied the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds testing 
7:177:12534:20:20:68:508:524:12:Times:12:Times:B:approach to cointegration to analyze the gasoline demand for South Africa. They analyzed the 
7:178:12627:20:20:68:497:504:12:Times:12:Times:B:long run relationship between the variables in the gasoline demand function over the period 
7:179:12719:20:20:68:517:484:12:Times:12:Times:B:1978-2005. Their study confirms the existence of a cointegrating relationship and the estimated 
7:180:12815:20:21:68:491:464:12:Times:12:Times:B:long run price and income elasticities were, respectively, -0.47 and 0.36, implying that the 
7:181:12908:21:20:68:364:443:12:Times:12:Times:B:gasoline demand in South Africa is price and income inelastic.

7:185:13019:20:20:68:519:363:12:Times:12:Times:B:As stated earlier we shall use data from Fiji for the period 1970-2005 to estimate the demand for 
7:186:13117:20:21:68:509:343:12:Times:12:Times:B:gasoline with 5 alternative methods viz., DEG, FMOLS, GETS, BT and JML. Our procedure is 
7:187:13206:21:20:68:511:322:12:Times:12:Times:B:easy to replicate for other countries and where necessary we shall quote some results with data 
7:188:13302:20:20:68:503:302:12:Times:12:Times:B:from a recent study by Akinboade, Ziramba and Kumo (2008) on South Africa for the period

7:191:13404:20:20:68:525:242:12:Times:12:Times:B:Fiji is a small island country with a population of less than a million. Its per capita vehicle ratio is 
7:192:13509:20:20:68:521:222:12:Times:12:Times:B:high compared to other developing countries and this has increased from 3 per 100 in 1970 to 17 
7:193:13605:20:21:68:514:202:12:Times:12:Times:B:by 2005. The trend rate of growth is about 4% per year. Private cars, taxies, rental and hire cars 
7:194:13704:21:20:68:515:181:12:Times:12:Times:B:and motorcycles, which use gasoline, are more than 60% of total of vehicles. Some commercial 
7:195:13797:20:31:68:518:161:12:Times:12:Times:B:vehicles and coaches also use gasoline. Since Fiji has no oil fields and oil refineries, 100% of its

8:199:13999:0:20:68:493:725:12:Times:12:Times:B:gasoline needs are imported from the refineries in Singapore. The import bill of gasoline is 
8:200:14092:20:20:68:506:705:12:Times:12:Times:B:FJ$70.1 million in 2005 and this is slightly above 9.0% of its total mineral fuel imports.8  The 
8:201:14189:20:20:68:511:685:12:Times:12:Times:B:demand for gasoline in Fiji has steadily increased over time as incomes grew and due to policy 
8:202:14284:20:20:68:522:665:12:Times:12:Times:B:changes which enabled traders to import pre-used vehicles from December 1986. This helped the 
8:203:14378:20:20:68:513:645:12:Times:12:Times:B:lower middle income groups to own vehicles. Table-1 below shows the annual average imports

9:244:15962:20:20:68:477:596:12:Times:12:Times:B:that we have excluded the trend variable from (3) because inclusion of trend gave some 
9:245:16049:20:20:68:518:576:12:Times:12:Times:B:implausible empirical results. A similar problem has been also encountered by Amarawickrama

9:249:16262:20:20:68:503:495:12:Times:12:Times:B:We address 3 issues at the outset concerning the 3 variables in equation (1). These are (a) the 
9:250:16358:20:21:68:521:475:12:Times:12:Times:B:order of integration of these 3 variables (b) the optimal order for VAR with these 3 variables and

9:252:16547:22:20:68:512:432:12:Times:12:Times:B:given in Table-2. We have used the standard ADF and KPSS tests for the variables. The results 
9:253:16641:20:23:68:509:412:12:Times:12:Times:B:indicate that whilegasandpare I(1) in levels and I(0) in their first differences, both tests have 
9:254:16739:23:22:68:517:389:12:Times:12:Times:B:shown that the level of yis stationary at the 5% level. However, the more powerful DFGLS test 
9:255:16833:22:22:68:492:367:12:Times:12:Times:B:showed thatyis I(1)  in its level and I(0) in first differences. The results in Table-2 are self 
9:256:16930:22:20:68:129:345:12:Times:12:Times:B:explanatory.

9:258:16943:21:20:68:508:304:12:Times:12:Times:B:To determine the order of the VAR the standard AIC and SBC criteria are used starting with an 
9:259:17037:20:20:68:511:284:12:Times:12:Times:B:order of 4. AIC indicated a second order but SBC indicated only a first order. Since our sample 
9:260:17133:20:20:68:325:264:12:Times:12:Times:B:size is small we decided to use first order for the VAR.

9:263:17280:22:22:68:515:201:12:Times:12:Times:B:weakly exogenous to.gas We included the intercept and then the intercept and trend. When the 
9:264:17373:22:20:68:501:179:12:Times:12:Times:B:trend is excluded the null that both explanatory variables are weakly exogenous could not be

11:327:19136:21:20:68:489:584:12:Times:12:Times:B:Estimates with DEG are reported in column1 of Table-3. We have introduced an intercept 
11:328:19223:20:20:68:487:564:12:Times:12:Times:B:dummy DUM8798 because without this dummy, tests for both serial correlation and non-
11:329:19307:20:20:68:513:544:12:Times:12:Times:B:normality of residuals were poor.11 This dummy variable is 1 from 1987 to 1998 and zero at all 
11:330:19402:20:20:68:494:524:12:Times:12:Times:B:other times. This was a period of political instability in Fiji. The issues surrounding the Fiji 
11:331:19499:20:20:68:524:504:12:Times:12:Times:B:constitution were being challenged in the courts and subsequently a new constitution was drafted. 
11:332:19597:20:20:68:523:484:12:Times:12:Times:B:The simple ADF test on the computed residuals with trend has been used as the cointegration test 
11:333:19694:20:21:68:528:464:12:Times:12:Times:B:for all countries for uniformity, but where a technique specific test for cointegration is available it 
11:334:19798:21:20:68:510:443:12:Times:12:Times:B:is shown in the last row of Table-3. The absolute value of the ADF test statistic (4.84) exceeds 
11:335:19895:20:20:68:502:423:12:Times:12:Times:B:the absolute critical value (3.56) at the 5 % level and rejects the null of no cointegration. The 
11:336:19993:20:20:68:522:403:12:Times:12:Times:B:estimates of income and price elasticities, which are all significant, are highly plausible and have 
11:337:20094:20:20:68:512:383:12:Times:12:Times:B:the expected signs and within the range of estimates for various other countries summarized by 
11:338:20189:20:20:68:520:363:12:Times:12:Times:B:Akinboade, Ziramba and Kumo (2008) in their Table-2. However, our estimates are closer to the 
11:339:20283:20:21:68:515:343:12:Times:12:Times:B:estimates for South Africa by Cloete and Smit (1988).  Gasoline demand in Fiji is inelastic with 
11:340:20380:21:20:68:478:322:12:Times:12:Times:B:respect to income and relative price since the estimated elasticities are 0.429 and -0.244 
11:341:20471:20:20:68:130:302:12:Times:12:Times:B:respectively.

11:344:20577:20:20:68:495:242:12:Times:12:Times:B:There does not seem to be any specific test for cointegration. However, the ADF test on the 
11:345:20669:20:20:68:497:222:12:Times:12:Times:B:residuals, with trend, shows that the null of no cointegration is rejected at the 5% level. The 
11:346:20765:20:44:68:527:202:12:Times:12:Times:B:estimated coefficients are all significant at the 5% level and have the expected signs. Estimates of

11:348:20916:7:21:68:488:151:6:Times:10:Times:F:11 Without the intercept dummy the estimated coefficients are close to those in column 1 of this table. These 
11:349:21026:21:17:68:488:130:10:Times:10:Times:F:estimates for the intercept income and price, respectively, are 18.092, 0.476 and -0.187. All are significant.

12:351:21139:0:20:68:515:725:12:Times:12:Times:B: intercept and income elasticity at 0.433 are close to the estimates with DEG method. However, 
12:352:21234:20:20:68:265:705:12:Times:12:Times:B:price elasticity at -0.203 is slightly lower. 
12:353:21280:20:20:68:71:685:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
12:354:21280:20:20:68:511:665:12:Times:12:Times:B:Estimates with GETS are in column 3 of Table-3. These estimates are made with the two stage 
12:355:21372:20:22:68:517:645:12:Times:12:Times:B:nonlinear instrumental variables method. Lagged values of the variables are used as instruments 
12:356:21468:22:23:68:526:623:12:Times:12:Times:B:and the Sargan 2χtest (not shown) validated the choice of instrumental variables. Its specification 
12:357:21568:23:20:68:501:600:12:Times:12:Times:B:also includes the short run dynamic terms, which will be shortly discussed. Both the residual 
12:358:21662:20:20:68:524:580:12:Times:12:Times:B:based ADF and a specifically developed test for cointegration in GETS specifications by Ericsson 
12:359:21759:20:20:68:526:560:12:Times:12:Times:B:and MacKinnon (2002) show that the null of no cointegration can be rejected at the 5% level. The 
12:360:21856:20:20:68:485:540:12:Times:12:Times:B:income and price coefficients have the expected signs. While the coefficient of income is 
12:361:21946:20:20:68:522:520:12:Times:12:Times:B:significant at the 5% level, the coefficient of price is significant at the 10% level. The estimate of 
12:362:22048:20:20:68:491:500:12:Times:12:Times:B:price elasticity at -0.159 is lower compared to the estimates with DEG and FMOLS. When 
12:363:22135:20:21:68:517:480:12:Times:12:Times:B:DUM8798 was included into the specification of the error correction term, the income and price 
12:364:22230:21:20:68:402:459:12:Times:12:Times:B:coefficients became insignificant. This is not shown to conserve space.

12:366:22302:20:20:68:508:419:12:Times:12:Times:B:Estimates with the popular bounds test (BT) are somewhat disappointing. In a good number of 
12:367:22394:20:20:68:499:399:12:Times:12:Times:B:empirical works with this method, some arbitrary changes seem to have been made and they 
12:368:22483:20:20:68:469:379:12:Times:12:Times:B:depart from the procedure explained in the Microfit 4.0 manual in pages 302-308. For 
12:369:22568:20:21:68:525:359:12:Times:12:Times:B:convenience these steps are stated as follows with a couple of additional suggestions for selecting 
12:370:22668:21:19:68:501:338:12:Times:12:Times:B:the order of the VAR and testing for weak exogeneity. First, test for the order selection of the 
12:371:22765:19:21:68:525:319:12:Times:12:Times:B:underlying VAR of the selected variables using AIC and SBC criteria. Second, test for deleting the 
12:372:22864:21:20:68:500:298:12:Times:12:Times:B:deterministic variables viz., trend and intercept. Third, use the test for block non-causality to 
12:373:22962:20:20:68:524:278:12:Times:12:Times:B:determine the choice of the dependent variable. This test can also be conducted with BT. Suppose 
12:374:23059:20:22:68:517:258:12:Times:12:Times:B:the optimal order of the VAR is 2 in a model (  ,  ,  ),F  y  x  z and and xzare also found to be weakly 
12:375:23164:22:21:68:458:236:12:Times:12:Times:B:exogenous, then the following model can be estimated with OLS in the fourth step.

12:380:23404:21:20:68:523:130:12:Times:12:Times:B:deterministic terms determines whether one or both should be included in the OLS estimates. The 
12:381:23500:20:0:68:525:110:12:Times:12:Times:B:summary statistics for this OLS equation can be ignored. In the fifth step the variable addition test 
13:382:23604:0:20:68:516:725:12:Times:12:Times:B:for including the one period lagged values of the 3 variables is conducted. The F-statistic of this 
13:383:23704:20:20:68:506:705:12:Times:12:Times:B:test is the test statistic for cointegration and should be compared with the critical values in the 
13:384:23804:20:20:68:525:685:12:Times:12:Times:B:Microfit manual. If the null of no cointegration is rejected, in the final step the long run and  short 
13:385:23908:20:20:68:494:665:12:Times:12:Times:B:run relationships can be estimated with the univariate option 6 in the Microfit or with other

14:484:25132:0:20:68:508:725:12:Times:12:Times:B:In some applications of BT, some investigators have removed the insignificant changes in the 
14:485:25225:20:20:68:497:705:12:Times:12:Times:B:variables from the OLS estimates in the fourth step. It is not clear if this is a valid procedure 
14:486:25323:20:20:68:521:685:12:Times:12:Times:B:because arbitrary removal of insignificant variables causes path dependence biases and changes  
14:487:25419:20:20:68:522:665:12:Times:12:Times:B:the computed value of F statistic. A second practice is to estimate both the long run and short run 
14:488:25519:20:20:68:502:645:12:Times:12:Times:B:specifications in one step as in GETS. However, using the estimated F value of this equation, 
14:489:25613:20:20:68:511:625:12:Times:12:Times:B:which will be much higher compared to its value from the variables addition test, is not a valid 
14:490:25710:20:21:68:218:605:12:Times:12:Times:B:test statistic for cointegration.12 
14:491:25745:21:20:68:71:584:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
14:492:25745:20:20:68:501:564:12:Times:12:Times:B:We have followed the procedure described in the Microfit manual and estimated with OLS a 
14:493:25834:20:20:68:472:544:12:Times:12:Times:B:specification similar to (3) without the trend variable i.e., the following specification.

14:497:25994:21:20:68:513:459:12:Times:12:Times:B:The variable addition test gave a low F value of 2.363 which is lower than the upper bound 5% 
14:498:26088:20:20:68:479:439:12:Times:12:Times:B:CV of 4.368 implying that the null of no cointegration cannot be rejected. However, our 
14:499:26176:20:20:68:526:419:12:Times:12:Times:B:somewhat ad hoc ADF test on the residuals show that these are I(0). When we increased the order 
14:500:26271:20:20:68:474:399:12:Times:12:Times:B:of the VAR and included the trend the value of the F test did not increase. Although the 
14:501:26360:20:20:68:526:379:12:Times:12:Times:B:cointegration test based on the F test failed, we have estimated the long run equation to see how it 
14:502:26461:20:21:68:520:359:12:Times:12:Times:B:differs from the estimates with other methods. It can be seen from column 4 that the estimates of 
14:503:26559:21:19:68:520:338:12:Times:12:Times:B:all the parameters are good and close to those of other estimates. However, the elasticity of price 
14:504:26659:19:60:68:484:319:12:Times:12:Times:B:at -0.162 is significant at a slightly higher level than the 10% level. Since BT is a popular 
14:505:26753:60:7:68:212:259:12:Times:12:Times:B:                                                   
14:506:26803:7:21:68:509:252:6:Times:10:Times:F:12 These errors were found by the first author while refereeing papers based on the bounds test. The first doubtful 
14:507:26919:21:17:68:519:231:10:Times:10:Times:F:procedures has been recently used by Akinboade, Ziramba and Kumo (2008). This not to pillory these authors since 
14:508:27032:17:17:68:521:214:10:Times:10:Times:F:a few others may have also used such procedures.  Akinboade, Ziramba and Kumo (2008) has some merits although 
14:509:27142:17:17:68:497:197:10:Times:10:Times:F:their procedure can be interpreted as estimation with GETS and not with the bounds test. When their model is 
14:510:27251:17:17:68:514:180:10:Times:10:Times:F:reestimated, using the data they have kindly supplied, with the GETS approach described in our paper, their results 
14:511:27367:17:16:68:524:163:10:Times:10:Times:F:stand with minor changes. The Ericsson and MacKinnon test for cointegration rejected the null of no cointegration at 
14:512:27484:16:17:68:523:147:10:Times:10:Times:F:the 10% but not at the 5% level. The computed test statistic is -3.575 and the 10% CV is  -3.250. However, the Wald 
14:513:27600:17:17:68:475:130:10:Times:10:Times:F:test did not reject the null that the absolute values of the income and price elasticities are equal at 0.385.

15:515:27713:0:20:68:526:725:12:Times:12:Times:B:technique, it would be useful if others, with a sound knowledge of estimation theory, clarify some 
15:516:27812:20:20:68:246:705:12:Times:12:Times:B:confusions in applying this method.13 
15:517:27849:20:20:68:71:685:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
15:518:27849:20:20:68:509:665:12:Times:12:Times:B:Estimates with JML are in the last column of Table-3. A first order VAR is used as in the other 
15:519:27945:20:20:68:525:645:12:Times:12:Times:B:methods. Both the eigenvalue and trace tests showed that with restricted intercept and without the 
15:520:28044:20:20:68:496:625:12:Times:12:Times:B:trend there is a single cointegrating vector.14 The estimated coefficients of the cointegrating 
15:521:28140:20:21:68:488:605:12:Times:12:Times:B:equation show that while income elasticity at 0.462 is significant at the 5% level the price 
15:522:28233:21:20:68:514:584:12:Times:12:Times:B:elasticity at -0.196 is significant at a slightly higher level of 6%. The residual based ADF test is 
15:523:28334:20:20:68:511:564:12:Times:12:Times:B:reported only for comparisons but it is not a valid test for JML.  Since this is a systems method 
15:524:28432:20:20:68:519:544:12:Times:12:Times:B:and the endogeneity biases will be minimal, it is worth comparing estimates with other methods 
15:525:28527:20:20:68:517:524:12:Times:12:Times:B:to those with JML. The percentage deviations of other estimates from JML are shown below the 
15:526:28619:20:20:68:507:504:12:Times:12:Times:B:coefficient estimates. In general the deviation of the intercept is minimal at about 2%. Income 
15:527:28715:20:20:68:526:484:12:Times:12:Times:B:elasticity seems to be overestimated in other methods ranging from 6.7% in FMOLS to high value 
15:528:28810:20:21:68:511:464:12:Times:12:Times:B:of 7.9% in GETS. Price elasticity is over estimated ranging from a low of 6.6% in FMOLS to a 
15:529:28903:21:20:68:513:443:12:Times:12:Times:B:high of 25% in DEG. Surprisingly estimates with BT, though these failed the cointegration test, 
15:530:28999:20:20:68:524:423:12:Times:12:Times:B:are not bad at all. All in all FMOLS estimates seem to have performed better than the other single 
15:531:29098:20:20:68:489:403:12:Times:12:Times:B:equation methods. Since this method is easy to implement with Microfit, it is an attractive 
15:532:29190:20:15:68:482:383:12:Times:12:Times:B:alternative single equation method. However, we do not recommend only one method of 
15:533:29274:15:8:68:212:368:12:Times:12:Times:B:                                                   
15:534:29324:8:21:68:502:360:6:Times:10:Times:F:13 Some confusions are as follows. First, pretesting for the order of the variables has now become simpler. If all 
15:535:29439:21:17:68:497:339:10:Times:10:Times:F:variables are I(0), then there is no need to use time series methods. Second,  the finite sample properties of the 
15:536:29554:17:17:68:507:322:10:Times:10:Times:F:estimates and the CVs are not clear and well known. This would be useful because some have been claiming that 
15:537:29664:17:16:68:500:305:10:Times:10:Times:F:they have computed these small sample CVs without an adequate explanation of how they are computed. It is a 
15:538:29772:16:17:68:523:289:10:Times:10:Times:F:reasonable guess that these CVs are computed by simply replacing the value of T with lower numbers in the GAUSS 
15:539:29884:17:17:68:501:272:10:Times:10:Times:F:programme of the original authors which has been used to compute the asymptotic CVs in the Microfit manual. 
15:540:29992:17:17:68:526:255:10:Times:10:Times:F:Third, are some deviations from the procedures in the Microfit manual, e.g., use of  parsimonious versions of VAR by 
15:541:30109:17:17:68:518:238:10:Times:10:Times:F:deleting the insignificant variables, valid? This is important because the F statistics differ considerably in these two

16:556:30788:20:20:68:501:645:12:Times:12:Times:B:gasoline in Fiji? Using an average of the estimates with FMOLS and JML we conjecture that 
16:557:30878:20:20:68:490:625:12:Times:12:Times:B:broadly these elasticities, respectively, are about 0.45 and -0.20. It is also note worthy that 
16:558:30974:20:21:68:511:605:12:Times:12:Times:B:estimates of these parameter, with other methods, are not far from these values and needless to 
16:559:31070:21:20:68:384:584:12:Times:12:Times:B:say these close results thus increase our confidence in the estimate.

16:561:31140:20:20:68:512:544:12:Times:12:Times:B:To conserve space we do not report all the estimates of the short run dynamic equations. These 
16:562:31235:20:20:68:521:524:12:Times:12:Times:B:dynamic equations are estimated with the lagged error terms implied in Table-3 and by including 
16:563:31331:20:20:68:523:504:12:Times:12:Times:B:3 lagged values of the changes in the variables. To obtain the parsimonious versions PcGETS has 
16:564:31427:20:20:68:508:484:12:Times:12:Times:B:been used since its search procedures are free from the path dependence biases. The estimated 
16:565:31521:20:21:68:503:464:12:Times:12:Times:B:adjustment coefficients are similar at about unity in all but in JML where it is about 0.7. This 
16:566:31618:21:30:68:509:443:12:Times:12:Times:B:implies that adjustment towards equilibrium is quick which is plausible in a small country like 
16:567:31714:30:0:68:413:413:12:Times:6:Times:B:Fiji. The summary statistics of all these equations are also similar with 2

16:571:31913:22:20:68:525:369:12:Times:12:Times:B:the 5% level. Since GETS (equation 4 below) is a one step procedure and JML (equation 5 below) 
16:572:32008:20:21:68:520:349:12:Times:12:Times:B:is a systems procedure, estimates of the short run dynamic equations with these two methods are

17:613:32571:0:20:68:514:725:12:Times:12:Times:B:It seems that the GETS dynamics is more plausible because consumers generally respond in the

17:618:32730:19:20:68:71:625:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
17:619:32730:20:21:68:515:605:12:Times:12:Times:B:This study has estimated the gasoline demand function for Fiji using five alternative time series 
17:620:32828:21:20:68:519:584:12:Times:12:Times:B:methods. Estimates of the long run parameters are close in all the five selected methods. Among 
17:621:32924:20:20:68:507:564:12:Times:12:Times:B:the single equation methods FMOLS estimates are closer to the estimates of the systems JML 
17:622:33014:20:20:68:501:544:12:Times:12:Times:B:method.  Using rounded values from the estimates with FMOLS and JML we conjecture that 
17:623:33101:20:20:68:529:524:12:Times:12:Times:B:broadly income and price elasticities, respectively, are about 0.45 and -0.20. It is also note worthy 
17:624:33203:20:20:68:529:504:12:Times:12:Times:B:that estimates of these elasticities with other methods are also similar increasing the confidence in 
17:625:33305:20:20:68:503:484:12:Times:12:Times:B:them and to draw the conclusion that gasoline demand in Fiji in long run is price and income 
17:626:33398:20:21:68:113:464:12:Times:12:Times:B:inelastic. 
17:627:33409:21:20:68:71:443:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
17:628:33409:20:20:68:517:423:12:Times:12:Times:B:Further we find that the GETS dynamics is more plausible than the JML estimates as consumers 
17:629:33502:20:20:68:496:403:12:Times:12:Times:B:generally respond in the short run to price changes than changes in income. The adjustment 
17:630:33593:20:20:68:523:383:12:Times:12:Times:B:coefficient of about unity, in all but in JML where it is about 0.7, implies that adjustment towards 
17:631:33694:20:20:68:523:363:12:Times:12:Times:B:equilibrium is quick and this is plausible in a small country like Fiji. From a fiscal policy point of 
17:632:33796:20:21:68:517:343:12:Times:12:Times:B:view we may conclude that taxation to limit gasoline demand either to contain the import bill or 
17:633:33893:21:20:68:461:322:12:Times:12:Times:B:for the containment of environmental degradation may not be a good policy option. 
17:634:33975:20:20:68:71:302:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
17:635:33975:20:20:68:515:282:12:Times:12:Times:B:A limitation in this paper is that the popular bounds test approach could not reject the null of no 
17:636:34075:20:20:68:464:262:12:Times:12:Times:B:cointegration. However, we pointed that this technique is used in some modified and 
17:637:34159:20:20:68:515:242:12:Times:12:Times:B:unsubstantiated forms to produce a high test statistics to reject the null of no cointegration. It is 
17:638:34261:20:20:68:519:222:12:Times:12:Times:B:not known if these ad hoc procedures are valid and we hope that other investigators will develop 
17:639:34358:20:21:68:144:202:12:Times:12:Times:B:some solutions.
