2:29:1515:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:If voters are fully rational and have negligible cognition costs, ballot layout should not affect election
2:30:1621:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:outcomes. In this paper, we explore deviations from rational voting using quasi-random variation in
2:31:1720:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:candidate name placement on ballots from the 2003 California Recall Election. We find that the voteshares
2:32:1825:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:of minor candidates almost double when their names are adjacent to the names of major candidates
2:33:1921:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:on a ballot. Voteshare gains are largest in precincts with high percentages of Democratic, Hispanic,
2:34:2021:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:low-income, non-English speaking, poorly educated, or young voters. A major candidate that attracts
2:35:2120:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:a disproportionate share of voters from these types of precincts faces a systematic electoral disadvantage.
2:36:2227:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:If the Republican frontrunner Arnold Schwarzenegger and Democratic frontrunner Cruz Bustamante
2:37:2321:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:had been in a tie, adjacency misvoting would have given Schwarzenegger an edge of 0.06% of the
2:38:2415:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:voteshare. This gain in voteshare exceeds the margins of victory in the 2000 U.S. Presidential Election
2:39:2518:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:and the 2004 Washington Gubernatorial Election. We explore which voting technology platforms
2:40:2610:14:28:72:221:434:12:Times:12:Times:and brands mitigate misvoting.

3:53:2872:0:27:72:151:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:I. Introduction 
3:54:2887:27:28:108:542:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:In this paper, we use the quasi-random variation in layouts of 150 types of ballots used in 
3:55:2979:28:27:72:545:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the  2003  California  Recall  Election  to  study  how  different  ballot  designs  led  to  systematic  
3:56:3085:27:28:72:545:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:deviations  in  the  voteshares  of  candidates.  We  refer  to  votes  for  a  candidate  that  are  solely  
3:57:3195:28:28:72:543:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:attributable to that candidate’s favorable position on the ballot as misvotes because differences in 
3:58:3296:28:27:72:545:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:ballot  layout  should  not  affect  the  decisions  of  fully  rational  voters.1  Previous  literature  has  
3:59:3407:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:focused on position misvotes – when candidates receive more votes because they are listed first 
3:60:3503:28:27:72:544:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:on  the  ballot  page  or  column.  In  this  paper,  we  consider  another  type  of  misvote:  adjacency  
3:61:3611:27:28:72:541:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:misvotes – when candidates receive more votes because they are adjacent to a popular candidate. 
3:62:3707:28:28:108:544:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Adjacency  misvotes  can  occur  if  voters  accidentally  select  candidates  adjacent  to  their  
3:63:3807:28:27:72:546:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:preferred  choices.    Evidence  from  simulated  voting  experiments  suggests  that  some  voters  
3:64:3908:27:28:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:become confused by the ballot layout and voting technology and, as a result, cast accidental but 
3:65:4005:28:27:72:544:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:valid  votes  for  candidates  adjacent  to  the  intended  choice  of  the  voter  (e.g.,  Roth  1998).  These  
3:66:4118:27:28:71:544:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adjacency  misvotes  are  especially  likely  if  the  ballot  columns  are  unclearly  marked,  the  ballot  
3:67:4228:28:27:72:544:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:text is small, the punch card grid is confusing, or if voters slip while marking their ballots. See 
3:68:4328:27:28:71:410:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Appendix 1 for sample ballots that may produce adjacency misvotes.2 
3:69:4395:28:28:108:543:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Misvotes are important for two reasons. First, and at a more fundamental level, misvotes 
3:70:4484:28:27:72:544:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:provide  insight  into  human  cognition:  While  Simon’s  (1955)  seminal  article  has  spurred  much  
3:71:4589:27:28:72:543:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:research on the limits of rational decision-making (see Conlisk 1996 for an overview), relatively 
3:72:4687:28:29:72:544:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:few  papers  examine  which  types  of  individuals  are  most  prone  to  behavioral  anomalies.    We  
3:73:4792:29:8:216:219:155:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:                                                 
3:74:4840:8:16:72:539:147:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:1 We use rational in the traditional sense of the term: someone who has a preference ordering over candidates that is 
3:75:4958:16:11:72:521:131:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:complete and transitive over the candidates. Implicit in this definition is that choice is not affected by cognition 
3:76:5075:11:7:72:97:120:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:costs. 
3:77:5082:7:16:72:541:113:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:2 It is also conceivable that adjacency misvotes can occur if voters scan quickly for popular candidates and then give 
3:78:5201:16:12:71:535:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:increased consideration to candidates listed near the popular candidate.  In Table 3, we show that accidental voting 
3:79:5318:12:11:71:532:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:rather than increased consideration is likely to be the primary cause of adjacency misvotes. However, our findings 
3:80:5433:11:0:71:316:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:hold regardless of which process drives adjacency misvotes. 
4:81:5494:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:examine how ballot design alters voting behavior and for which types of voters these effects are 
4:82:5591:27:28:72:544:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:strongest.    Following  List  and  Reiley  (2002),  we  assume  that  the  rationality  of  voter  behavior  
4:83:5701:28:27:72:545:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:decreases  with  the  cognitive  cost  of  processing  complicated  ballot  design.  We  examine  how  
4:84:5804:27:28:71:544:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:variation  in  cognitive  costs  across  demographic  groups  can  affect  the  probability  of  casting  a  
4:85:5913:28:28:72:543:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:misvote and thereby determine election outcomes. Our paper thus contributes to a relatively new 
4:86:6009:28:27:72:546:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:literature  that  examines  demographic  variation  in  people’s  decision-making  abilities  in  real  
4:87:6113:27:28:72:544:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:world  situations  (e.g.,  Madrian  2001,  Choi  et  al.  2004,  Thaler  and  Benartzi  2004,  and  Lusardi  
4:88:6222:28:27:72:170:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and Mitchell 2006). 
4:89:6242:27:28:108:543:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Second, misvotes can change election outcomes. Previous literature on position misvotes 
4:90:6330:28:28:72:544:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:has  predominantly  focused  on  who  gains  from  misvotes.  King  and  Leigh  (2006),  Koppell  and  
4:91:6433:28:27:72:542:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Steen (2004), and Miller and Krosnick (1998) show that candidates gain up to 2% in voteshare if 
4:92:6529:27:28:72:542:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:they are listed near the start of the ballot. However, the gain from being listed near the top of the 
4:93:6631:28:27:72:544:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidate  list  tends  to  be  much  smaller  in  well-publicized  elections  featuring  party  labels,  and  
4:94:6742:27:28:71:543:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:well-known  or  incumbent  candidates  (e.g.,  Ho  and  Imai  2005,  Koppell  and  Steen  2004,  Miller  
4:95:6847:28:27:71:544:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and  Krosnick  1998,  and  Taebel  1975).  Further,  the  bias  caused  by  position  misvotes  can  be  
4:96:6952:27:28:71:543:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:minimized if the list of candidate names is randomized and rotated through voting districts as is 
4:97:7050:28:28:71:543:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:done in states such as California, Ohio, and Kansas. Therefore, what often matters more for the 
4:98:7146:28:27:71:544:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:outcome  of  major  U.S.  elections  is  which  of  the  two  front-runners  systematically  loses  more  
4:99:7252:27:28:71:543:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:votes to misvotes. This point is perhaps best illustrated by the unexpected large number of votes 
4:100:7350:28:27:71:544:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that  Patrick  Buchanan  received  on  the  “butterfly  ballot”  used  in  Palm  Beach  County,  Florida  
4:101:7456:27:0:71:545:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:during  the  2000  U.S.  Presidential  Election.  While  even  Buchanan  himself  acknowledges  that  
5:102:7559:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:most of the 3,407 votes he received in Palm Beach County are due to voter mistakes,3 the bigger 
5:103:7655:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:question is whether these misvotes came sufficiently more from Al Gore than from George Bush 
5:104:7748:28:27:72:543:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:to overturn Bush’s 537 vote margin of victory. Numerous studies using demographic trends and 
5:105:7841:27:28:72:545:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Buchanan’s  performance  in  surrounding  counties  indicate  that  this  was  likely  the  case  (e.g.,  
5:106:7947:28:28:72:246:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Wand et al. 2001, and Smith 2002). 
5:107:7982:28:27:108:546:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:  Unlike  position  misvotes,  adjacency  misvotes  can  offer  insight  into  differences  in  
5:108:8078:27:28:72:546:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:voteshare  lost  by  major  candidates.  Voteshare  gained  by  a  candidate  adjacent  to  a  major  
5:109:8180:28:27:72:544:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidate  is  voteshare  lost  by  the  associated  major  candidate.  We  assess  which  of  the  major  
5:110:8287:27:28:72:544:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidates  disproportionally  loses  votes  to  adjacent  candidates  in  two  ways.  First,  we  examine  
5:111:8395:28:28:72:543:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:whether minor candidates in the vicinity of one major candidate gain as much voteshare as minor 
5:112:8491:28:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidates in the vicinity of another major candidate. Second, we relate the extent of misvoting 
5:113:8588:27:28:72:545:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:in  each  election  precinct  to  precinct  demographic  characteristics  and  estimate  whether  major  
5:114:8693:28:27:72:545:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidates  that  appeal  to  voters  with  certain  demographic  characteristics  lose  more  votes  to  
5:115:8799:27:28:72:544:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adjacent candidates. To our knowledge we are the first study that does this for a major election, 
5:116:8897:28:27:72:543:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and both methods indicate that one of the major candidates disproportionally loses votes due to 
5:117:8993:27:28:71:125:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:misvoting. 
5:118:9004:28:28:107:543:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:We measure adjacency misvoting by exploiting the rotational structure of ballots used in 
5:119:9093:28:27:71:546:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the  2003  California  Recall  Election.  Candidates  in  the  Recall  Election  are  listed  in  order  
5:120:9198:27:28:71:542:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:according to a randomized alphabetization in District 1, and then rotated one position at a time in 
5:121:9298:28:27:71:544:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:subsequent  districts.  Due  to  the  interaction  between  ballot  rotation  and  each  county’s  unique  
5:122:9405:27:28:71:547:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:page  layout,  there  exists  significant  exogenous  variation  in  whether  a  minor  (unpopular)  
5:123:9506:28:20:71:544:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidate’s  name  is  adjacent  to  that  of  a  major  (popular)  candidate.  The  increase  in  voteshare  
5:124:9616:20:8:216:219:109:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:                                                 
5:125:9664:8:16:72:540:101:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:3 In an appearance on the “Today” show on November 9, 2000, Buchanan said, “When I took one look at that ballot 
5:126:9776:16:11:71:535:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:on Election Night ... it’s very easy for me to see how someone could have voted for me in the belief they voted for 
5:127:9892:11:0:71:113:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:Al Gore.” 
6:128:9903:0:27:72:544:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:experienced  by  a  minor  candidate  when  she  is  adjacent  to  a  major  candidate  is  an  estimate  of  
6:129:10013:27:28:72:544:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adjacency  misvoting.  We  then  use  precinct-level  voting  results  and  demographic  data  to  test  if  
6:130:10122:28:27:72:545:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:certain  demographic  groups  are  more  likely  to  cast  misvotes  than  others.  Finally,  we  test  if,  
6:131:10231:27:28:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:controlling for demographic characteristics, certain kinds of voting technologies correspond to a 
6:132:10329:28:28:72:244:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:reduction in the level of misvoting. 
6:133:10366:28:27:108:543:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The Recall Election has several desirable characteristics. First, California contains a large 
6:134:10460:27:28:72:545:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:number  of  counties  and  districts  that  use  a  variety  of  voting  technologies  and  ballot  formats,  
6:135:10570:28:27:72:544:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:allowing  for  maximal  variation  in  whether  a  minor  candidate  is  adjacent  to  a  major  candidate.  
6:136:10679:27:28:72:543:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Second,  California  rotates  the  long  list  of  candidates  (135  in  total)  one  candidate  at  a  time  by  
6:137:10793:28:28:72:543:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:district.  This,  again,  allows  for  greater  variation  in  terms  of  adjacency.  Finally,  a  gubernatorial  
6:138:10907:28:27:72:544:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:election  is  relatively  important  and  well  covered  by  the  media  and  therefore  may  offer  insights  
6:139:11018:27:28:72:293:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that can be extended to other major elections. 
6:140:11065:28:27:108:545:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:We  find  that  the  voteshares  of  minor  candidates  almost  double  when  their  names  are  
6:141:11162:27:28:72:543:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adjacent to the names of major candidates. Misvotes account for at least 0.25 percent of all votes 
6:142:11261:28:27:72:544:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:cast  during  the  Recall  Election.4  We  find  that  the  amount  of  misvoting  depends  on  the  voting  
6:143:11370:27:28:72:543:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:technology  used;  punch  card  technologies  yield  about  twice  the  level  of  misvotes  compared  to  
6:144:11477:28:28:72:543:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:optical scan and touch screen platforms, which confirms findings by Dee (2006). The amount of 
6:145:11571:28:27:72:545:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:misvoting  also  varies  with  voter  characteristics.    Using  precinct-level  voter  registration  and  
6:146:11678:27:28:72:543:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Census data, we find that adjacency misvoting is strongest in precincts with high percentages of 
6:147:11775:28:27:72:545:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Democratic,  Hispanic,  low-income,  non-English  speaking,  poorly  educated,  or  young  voters.  
6:148:11875:27:28:72:545:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:After  controlling  for  the  relative  popularities  of  the  two  major  candidates,  we  find  that  the  
6:149:11984:28:32:72:543:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:voteshare lost by the Democratic frontrunner, Cruz Bustamante exceeds the voteshare lost by his 
6:150:12080:32:7:216:219:97:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:                                                 
6:151:12128:7:16:72:533:90:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:4 This is a lower bound because we only consider votes gained by candidates immediately adjacent to the top three 
6:152:12242:16:0:71:247:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:frontrunners in our calculation of misvotes. 
7:153:12288:0:27:72:544:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Republican rival, Arnold Schwarzenegger, by 63%. While Schwarzenegger beat Bustamante by 
7:154:12377:27:28:72:545:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:a  comfortable  17.0  percentage  points  in  the  Recall  Election,  the  disproportionate  misvoting  
7:155:12481:28:27:72:543:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:would have given Schwarzenegger a 0.06% advantage if both had been tied at 47% of the vote. 
7:156:12573:27:28:72:542:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:This margin is larger than the margins of victory in the 2000 U.S. presidential, 2004 Washington 
7:157:12670:28:28:72:546:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:gubernatorial,  1974  New  Hampshire  senatorial,  and  1985  Indiana  representative  elections.  
7:158:12769:28:27:72:545:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Schwarzenegger’s  advantage  over  Bustamante  is  also  not  much  smaller  than  the  margins  of  
7:159:12870:27:28:72:542:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:victory in several close U.S. elections including the 1880 and 1884 presidential elections and the 
7:160:12969:28:27:72:543:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:2000 Washington and 1998 Nevada senate elections, all of which had margins of victory of less 
7:161:13063:27:28:72:545:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:than  0.1%.5  Further,  our  estimate  of  the  difference  in  voteshare  lost  by  the  major  candidates  
7:162:13172:28:28:72:544:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:underestimates  the  difference  that  might  occur  in  elections  in  which  two  major  candidates  are  
7:163:13280:28:27:72:544:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adjacent to each other, as is the case in many U.S. presidential elections. In such situations, not 
7:164:13380:27:28:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:only  does  one  major  candidate  lose  more  votes  to adjacent candidates, these losses are accrued 
7:165:13483:28:27:72:380:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:by her opponent, thereby exacerbating differences in voteshare. 
7:166:13547:27:28:108:546:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Adjacency  misvotes  pose  a  unique  challenge  to  policy  makers.  While  candidate  list  
7:167:13641:28:27:72:542:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:rotation by district can eliminate the bias posed by positional misvoting, rotation does nothing to 
7:168:13741:27:28:72:544:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:reduce  the  bias  caused  by  adjacency  misvoting.  No  matter  how  a  candidate  list  is  randomized  
7:169:13848:28:28:72:543:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:across districts, major candidates will continue to lose votes to adjacent candidates. Our results 
7:170:13947:28:27:72:546:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:suggest  two  strategies  that  may  reduce  the  level  of  adjacency  misvotes.  First,  some  voting  
7:171:14052:27:28:72:544:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:technologies (electronic voting and certain brands of optical scan ballots) lead to lower levels of 
7:172:14152:28:27:72:544:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:misvoting.  Second,  we  find  that  adjacency  misvotes  are  most  prevalent  when  it  is  difficult  to  
7:173:14261:27:28:72:543:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:discern  which  candidate  selection  box  is  associated with a given candidate name. For example, 
7:174:14361:28:20:72:543:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:on  multi-column  ballots,  a  single  candidate  name  might  be  bordered  by  two  selection  bubbles.  
7:175:14468:20:8:216:219:109:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:                                                 
7:176:14516:8:16:72:538:101:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:5 Of course, adjacency misvoting is also present in elections outside the United States. Differences in voteshare lost 
7:177:14635:16:11:72:533:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:by major candidates could have determined outcomes for close international elections such as the 2006 Italian and 
7:178:14749:11:0:72:457:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:Mexican General Elections, both of which were decided by less than 0.1% of the popular vote.  
8:179:14844:0:27:72:545:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Thus,  clearer  separation  of  the  selection  boxes  corresponding  to  each  candidate’s  name  may  
8:180:14948:27:28:72:267:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:reduce the level of adjacency misvotes.

8:183:15033:28:28:90:543:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A statewide special election was held in California on October 7th 2003 concerning the recall 
8:184:15127:28:27:72:432:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of Governor Gray Davis. Voters were presented with two recall questions: 
8:185:15200:27:14:90:504:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:1.   “Should Gray Davis be recalled (removed) from the office of Governor?” Yes/No 
8:186:15283:14:14:90:508:529:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:2.    Candidates  to  succeed  Gray  Davis  as  Governor  if  he  is  recalled:  Vote  for  one”

8:188:15401:14:13:90:93:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: 
8:189:15401:13:28:72:544:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Voters  were  asked  to  respond  to  the  second  question  regardless  of  their  response  to  the  first  
8:190:15511:28:28:72:543:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:question. If more than 50% answer “Yes” to the first question, the candidate with the plurality of

8:192:15717:27:28:72:544:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(one  needed  only  to  obtain  65  signatures  and  pay  the  $3500  registration  fee),  a  total  of  135  
8:193:15827:28:27:72:545:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidates  ran  to  replace  Governor  Gray  Davis.  The  resulting  candidate  list  was  extremely  
8:194:15930:27:28:72:545:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:diverse  and  included  such  personalities  as  actor  Gary  Coleman,  erotic  actress  Mary  “Mary

8:196:16094:27:28:108:545:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Ballot  format  in  the  Recall  Election  was  also  extremely  diverse.  The  ballot  layout  and  
8:197:16195:28:28:72:543:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:technology  was  determined  at  the  county  level  (58  counties).  The  ballot  ordering  of  candidates  
8:198:16304:28:27:72:544:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:varied  by  assembly  district  (80  districts).  Because  multiple  counties  can  lie  in  the  same  district  
8:199:16418:27:28:72:545:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and  vice  versa,  the  Recall  Election  used  157  different  ballots  (county-district  combinations).  
8:200:16525:28:27:71:566:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Candidates         were         ordered         according         to         a         randomized         alphabet,         
8:201:16649:27:28:71:544:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:“RWQOJMVAHBSGZXNTCIEKUPDYFL”  in  the  first  assembly  district  and  then  rotated  one  
8:202:16740:28:0:71:543:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidate  at  a  time  by  district.  Thus,  in  District  1,  the  order  was  alphabetical  according  to  this  
9:203:16857:0:27:72:544:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:randomly  drawn  alphabet:  Robinson,  Roscoe,  Ramirez,  ...,  Leonard.  In  District  2,  Robinson  
9:204:16959:27:28:72:520:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:becomes last, and all others move up by one. This rotation continued through all 80 districts. 
9:205:17054:28:27:108:544:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Gray  Davis  was  recalled  as  Governor  of  California (55% of voters voted to recall him). 
9:206:17148:27:28:72:544:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Table 1 shows the distribution of voteshares among the candidates running to replace him. The 
9:207:17242:28:28:72:544:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:top  three  candidates  captured  a  total  93.56%  of  the  voteshare,  leaving  an  average  voteshare  of  
9:208:17352:28:27:72:543:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:0.05%  for  the  remaining  132  “minor”  candidates.  For  the  remainder  of  this  paper,  we  consider  
9:209:17460:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the three frontrunners, Arnold Schwarzenegger (R), Cruz Bustamante (D), and Tom McClintock 
9:210:17551:28:27:72:542:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(R) as major candidates. Inclusion of the next most popular candidate, Peter Camejo, as a major 
9:211:17647:27:28:72:544:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidate  does  not  significantly  change  the  baseline  results.  All  candidates  other  than  the  top  
9:212:17757:28:28:72:345:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:three are included in the analysis as minor candidates.6 
9:213:17813:28:27:108:543:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:California uses three types of voting technology platforms: punch card, optical scan, and

9:215:17999:28:27:72:543:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:hole corresponding to the desired candidate. Some forms of punch card technology require that 
9:216:18093:27:28:72:544:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:voters  search  for  the  candidate’s  number  on  a  separate  punch  card  grid  while  others  place  the  
9:217:18203:28:27:72:543:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:pre-scored hole next to the candidate name. Optical scan technology requires that voters fill in an 
9:218:18303:27:28:72:546:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:oval  or  other  marking  to  the  left  or  right  of  each  candidate’s  name.  Finally,  touch  screen  
9:219:18410:28:28:72:542:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:technology requires that voters touch a box on the computer screen in order to select their desired 
9:220:18510:28:27:72:546:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidate.  After  selection,  the  screen  asks  the  voter  to  confirm  her  choice.  Technology  is  
9:221:18615:27:28:72:545:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:determined  at  the  county  level.  Approximately  40  percent  of  all  counties  use  punch  card,  40  
9:222:18722:28:27:72:543:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:percent use optical scan and 20 percent use touch screen technology. Each technology platform 
9:223:18816:27:37:72:506:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:has several technology brands. The distribution of each brand is presented in Appendix 2.

10:229:19359:0:27:108:543:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: We utilize copies of sample ballots mailed to voters for 150 county-district combinations

10:232:19652:27:28:71:540:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Studies (IGS) at the University of California, Berkeley. The statement of vote data has precinct-

10:235:19970:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:group. Because registration data does not include other important demographic variables such as 
10:236:20066:28:27:72:544:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:income  and  education,  we  merge  precinct-level  data  with  U.S.  Census  data  from  2000  at  the

10:241:20345:28:27:108:543:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:In general, it is difficult to measure the level of adjacency misvotes because misvotes are 
10:242:20437:27:28:72:542:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:recorded as valid votes. This may be the reason why previous literature (e.g., Alvarez et al. 2001 
10:243:20536:28:27:71:543:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and Brady et al. 2001) has predominantly focused on the residual vote – votes that are discarded 
10:244:20633:27:28:72:545:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:because  of  hanging  chads  or  other  mismarkings.  To  our  knowledge,  Dee’s  (2006)  innovative  
10:245:20735:28:28:72:544:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:paper  is  the  only  paper  that  analyzes  adjacency  misvotes  directly.  Dee  argues  that  the  positive  
10:246:20846:28:27:72:546:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:correlation  between  the  voteshares  of  a  major  candidate  and  the  voteshares  of  “bookend  
10:247:20946:27:28:72:545:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidates”  –  minor  candidates  listed  immediately  before  or  after  the  major  candidate  –  is  
10:248:21051:28:41:72:542:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:evidence of voting mistakes. Dee shows that voteshares of bookends increase by roughly 1/1000 
10:249:21145:41:7:216:219:143:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:                                                 
10:250:21193:7:16:72:542:136:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:7 The actual ballots used during Election Day are identical in layout to the sample ballots. In the case of touch screen 
10:251:21314:16:12:71:535:120:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:technology, voters viewed electronic screens which displayed candidate names in the same layout as that presented 
10:252:21428:12:11:71:531:108:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:on the sample paper ballots. We have been unable to collect sample ballots from Stanislaus and Imperial Counties 
10:253:21541:11:7:71:224:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:(which account for 1.4% of the vote). 
10:254:21579:7:16:72:515:90:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:8 Precinct-level data from IGS is at present incomplete. Full statement of vote and registration data along with 
10:255:21692:16:0:71:356:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:matching files account for 84% of all votes cast in the Recall Election. 
11:256:21766:0:27:72:545:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of  a  percentage  point  for  every  percentage  point  increase  in  the  adjacent  major  candidate’s  
11:257:21872:27:28:72:544:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:voteshare.  However,  Dee  restricts  his  analysis  to  candidates  who  are  almost  always  adjacent  to  
11:258:21981:28:27:72:543:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:major candidates and therefore cannot test voteshare gains caused by variation in when a minor 
11:259:22076:27:28:72:542:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidate is adjacent to a major candidate. Thus, the critical assumption behind his results is that 
11:260:22177:28:28:72:544:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the  voteshares  of  the  four  bookends  are  not  correlated  with  the  voteshares  of  major  candidates  
11:261:22287:28:27:72:543:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:due to reasons other than misvotes.  However, this assumption may be reasonable in the context 
11:262:22382:27:28:72:545:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of  Dee’s  paper,  which  focuses  on  which  technologies  mitigate  misvoting  rather  than  which  
11:263:22484:28:27:72:550:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:demographic  groups  are  most  prone  to  misvoting  and  how  misvotes  can  affect  elections.    
11:264:22585:27:28:72:543:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Consistent  with  our  findings,  he  finds  that  punch  card  technologies  lead  to  significantly  higher  
11:265:22696:28:28:71:169:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:levels of misvoting. 
11:266:22717:28:27:107:544:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:To  better  capture  variation  in  adjacency,  we  define  an  adjacent  candidate  as  any  minor  
11:267:22818:27:28:72:545:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidate  that  vertically  or  horizontally  borders  a  major  candidate  on  a  particular  ballot  (see  
11:268:22928:28:27:72:544:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:sample  ballots  in  Appendix  1).  We  call  these  adjacent  candidates  north,  south,  east,  and  west  
11:269:23037:27:28:71:544:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adjacent  following  a  standard  compass  diagram.  For  example,  the  candidate  directly  above  a  
11:270:23141:28:27:71:545:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:major  candidate  is  north  adjacent.  Identification  of  adjacency  misvoting  results  from  random  
11:271:23246:27:28:71:546:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:variation  in  when  a  minor  candidate  is  an  adjacent  candidate.  North  and  south  adjacent  
11:272:23347:28:28:71:546:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidates  are  identified  due  to  candidate  name  rotation  through  page  and  column  breaks.  
11:273:23449:28:27:71:546:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Because  north  and  south  adjacent  candidates  are  located  in  the  same  column  as  the  major  
11:274:23552:27:28:72:543:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidate, they are always present and the same unless column and page breaks cause the major 
11:275:23646:28:27:72:544:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidate  to  be  listed  at  the  top  or  bottom  of  a  column.  For  example,  minor  candidates  Burton  
11:276:23757:27:28:71:546:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and  Bly-Chester  are  listed  before  and  after  major  candidate  Bustamante  according  to  the  
11:277:23858:28:28:71:544:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidate  name  list.  They  are  always  north  and  south  adjacent  unless  they  are  separated  from  
11:278:23966:28:0:71:267:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Bustamante by a page or column break.  
12:279:24007:0:27:108:544:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Identification  of  east  and  west  adjacent  candidates  occurs  because  column  length  varies  
12:280:24107:27:28:72:547:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:by  county.  In  the  sixty  percent  of  counties  that  use  multi-column  ballots,  the  candidates  
12:281:24211:28:27:72:547:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:horizontally  adjacent  to  the  major  candidates  depend  on  the  county’s  column  length.  For  
12:282:24312:27:28:72:544:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:example, if Schwarzenegger is listed in the middle column on a three-column ballot, he has east 
12:283:24408:28:28:71:539:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and  west  adjacent  candidates.  If  Schwarzenegger  is  listed  in  the  left-most  column  on  a  two-
12:284:24513:28:27:71:543:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:column ballot, he only has an east adjacent candidate. Further, this east adjacent candidate may 
12:285:24610:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:not be the same east adjacent candidate as in the previous ballot if the two ballots have columns 
12:286:24708:28:27:72:543:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of differing lengths. Statistics describing the identification of each type of adjacent candidate are 
12:287:24810:27:28:72:197:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:available in Appendix 2.9

12:289:24931:28:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:layout, we identify 68 minor candidates that are adjacent to a major candidate in some but not all 
12:290:25030:27:28:72:452:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:county-districts.  We use this variation to answer the following four questions: 
12:291:25111:28:21:108:542:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:1.   Is there evidence of voter irrationality as measured by increased voteshares of minor 
12:292:25202:21:20:126:333:356:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:candidates located in favorable positions? 
12:293:25245:20:21:108:473:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:2.   How does misvoting affect the relative voteshares of major candidates? 
12:294:25321:21:21:108:491:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:3.   What demographic characteristics correlate with the amount of misvoting? 
12:295:25399:21:27:108:498:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:4.   What voting technologies correspond to a reduction in the level of misvotes? 
12:296:25481:27:35:72:451:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:To examine adjacency misvoting, we use the following baseline specification: 
12:297:25558:35:34:72:379:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:( I ) Votesharepdc = β0 + β1×Adjacentpdcm + controls + εpdc ,  
12:298:25621:34:35:108:140:198:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f3:where 
12:299:25626:35:31:108:392:163:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Adjacentpdcm ≡ Idcadjacent × Major Candidate Votesharepdcm

12:301:25733:8:16:72:523:124:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:9 We also identify a special class of adjacent candidates with numbers located in squares adjacent to the number 
12:302:25846:16:11:71:540:108:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:corresponding to the major candidate on a punch card (See Appendix 1). These punch card adjacent candidates only 
12:303:25959:11:12:71:540:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:exist in the 19% of counties that use the Votomatic or Pollstar brands of voting machines. Because column length in 
12:304:26075:12:11:71:525:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:the punch card grid differs from column length in the ballot text, a candidate can be punch card adjacent without 
12:305:26189:11:0:71:278:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:being adjacent on the regular ballot and vice versa.

13:309:26557:34:35:72:544:605:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:county-district d.  We  do  not  use  the  log  of  voteshare  as  the  dependent  variable  because  the  
13:310:26664:35:34:72:543:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:voteshare gained by an adjacent candidate should be a level effect, and should not depend on the

13:312:26863:35:34:72:543:501:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidate c is adjacent to a major candidate in county-district d. In modifications of the baseline 
13:313:26963:34:35:72:547:467:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:regression, Idcadjacent may  represent  specific  types  of  candidate  adjacency  (e.g.,  the  minor  
13:314:27065:35:34:71:543:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidate listed directly above major candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger) or a vector representing 
13:315:27161:34:35:71:544:398:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:several  types  of  candidate  adjacency.  If  minor  candidate  c  is  adjacent  to  a  major  candidate  in  
13:316:27272:35:34:71:545:363:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:precinct p  in  county-district  d,  then  Major  Candidate  Votesharepdcm  equals  the  voteshare  in  
13:317:27376:34:34:72:542:329:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:precinct p  of  the  major  candidate  m  to  whom  the  minor  candidate  is  adjacent.  Adjacentpdcm is 
13:318:27481:34:35:72:544:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:defined  as  the  product  of  Idcadjacent and Major  Candidate  Votesharepdcm. Finally εpdc  is  an  error  
13:319:27589:35:34:71:544:260:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:term  that  we  allow  to  be  clustered  by  county-district-candidate  because  the  primary  right  hand  
13:320:27698:34:71:71:542:226:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:side variable of interest, Idcadjacent, is constant within a county-district for a given minor candidate. 
13:321:27804:71:8:216:219:155:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:                                                 
13:322:27852:8:16:72:519:147:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:10 Weights account for the fact that an observation representing a large precinct is more precise because it is an 
13:323:27967:16:11:71:506:131:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:average taken from a larger sample of voters. Thus, larger precincts should be weighted more heavily in the 
13:324:28075:11:7:71:117:120:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:regression. 
13:325:28087:7:16:72:539:113:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:11 This is verified empirically by a regression of minor candidate voteshare on a dummy variable equaling one if the 
13:326:28204:16:12:72:514:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:minor candidate is adjacent to a major candidate and an interaction term between the dummy variable and the 
13:327:28312:12:11:72:535:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:precinct-level voteshare of the minor candidate. The coefficient on the interaction term is insignificant and close to 
13:328:28431:11:0:72:94:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:zero. 
14:329:28439:0:27:108:545:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:In  the  baseline  specification,  β1  represents  the  gain  in  voteshare  experienced  by  an  
14:330:28537:27:28:71:543:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adjacent minor candidate when the corresponding major candidate’s voteshare increases by one. 
14:331:28631:28:27:71:544:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:In  other  words,  β1  measures  the  percentage  of  voters  originally  intending  to  vote  for  a  major  
14:332:28741:27:28:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidate that end up voting for each adjacent minor candidate. (The total percentage of voters 
14:333:28837:28:28:72:544:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that  misvote  is  not  β1 but  rather  the  product  of  β1 and  the  average  number  of  minor  candidates  
14:334:28946:28:27:71:544:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adjacent  to  major  candidates  per  ballot.) Implicit  in  this  interpretation  of  β1  is  that  adjacency  
14:335:29057:27:28:72:545:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:misvoting  is  a  positive  function  of  the  popularity  of  the  associated  major  candidate;  i.e.  if  
14:336:29166:28:27:72:544:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Schwarzenegger  is  more  popular  in  precinct  A  than in precinct B and Schwarzenegger’s voters 
14:337:29265:27:28:72:544:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:are equally likely to misvote in precincts A and B, then candidates adjacent to Schwarzenegger 
14:338:29360:28:28:72:365:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:should gain more voteshare in precinct A than in precinct B. 
14:339:29421:28:27:108:544:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:  Our  sample  consists  of  observations  at  the  candidate-precinct  level.  There  are  132  data  
14:340:29524:27:28:72:547:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:points  per  precinct,  one  for  each  minor  candidate.  This  results  in  a  total  of  1,817,904  
14:341:29627:28:27:72:488:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:observations, covering 13,772 precincts corresponding to 80 districts and 55 counties. 
14:342:29714:27:28:108:546:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:  We  also  introduce  the  following  set  of  controls  to  the  baseline  regression  and  all  
14:343:29813:28:27:72:545:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:extensions  of  the  baseline  regression:  candidate  ballot  location  controls  (dummy  variables  for  
14:344:29920:27:28:72:545:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:first  and  last  on  the  ballot  overall,  ballot  page,  and  ballot  column),  candidate  fixed  effects,  
14:345:30031:28:28:72:547:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidate  fixed  effects  interacted  with  demographic  controls,  and  candidate  fixed  effects  
14:346:30132:28:27:72:544:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:interacted  with  the  voteshares  of  the  major  candidates.12  Altogether,  2250  control  variables  are  
14:347:30242:27:28:72:523:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:included in our baseline specification to ensure correct identification of adjacency misvoting. 
14:348:30338:28:27:108:546:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:  The  ballot  location  controls  are  county-district-candidate-level  dummy  variables  that  
14:349:30435:27:37:72:543:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:equal one if the minor candidate is located first or last overall, on a page, or in a column on the 
14:350:30535:37:7:216:219:120:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:                                                 
14:351:30583:7:16:72:534:113:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:12 The addition of county-district fixed effect does not significantly change baseline results. They are omitted from 
14:352:30701:16:12:72:537:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:the analysis in order to reduce computational demands on statistical software. Because the dependent variables sum 
14:353:30816:12:11:72:536:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:to the total voteshare of minor candidates, county-district fixed effects only control for the relative popularity of all 
14:354:30938:11:0:72:360:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:minor candidates compared to major candidates in each county-district. 
15:355:31011:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:ballot. These ballot position controls ensure that adjacency misvotes are not incorrectly identified 
15:356:31112:27:28:71:543:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:off of position misvotes. The candidate fixed effects control for differences in the popularity of 
15:357:31211:28:27:71:544:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:minor  candidates  that  could  lead  to  bias  if  relatively  popular  minor  candidates  happen  to  be  
15:358:31319:27:28:71:545:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adjacent  to  major  candidates  on  a  disproportionate  share  of  the  ballots.  We  also  control  for  
15:359:31427:28:28:72:544:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidate  fixed  effects  interacted  with  precinct-level  demographic  characteristics.  This  controls  
15:360:31535:28:27:72:546:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:for  how  precinct-level  demographic  characteristics  influence  the  popularity  of  each  minor  
15:361:31636:27:28:72:547:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidate.  It  ensures  that  adjacency  misvoting  is  not  incorrectly  identified  from  precinct  
15:362:31739:28:27:72:544:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:demographic  characteristics,  which,  by  chance,  might  favor  candidates  that  are  adjacent  in  that  
15:363:31848:27:28:72:545:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:precinct.  Similarly  we  control  for  candidate  fixed  effects  interacted  with  the  precinct-level  
15:364:31954:28:28:72:544:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:voteshare  of  each  major  candidate  to  control  for  the  correlation  between  the  popularity  of  each  
15:365:32065:28:27:72:362:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:minor candidate and the popularity of the major candidates. 
15:366:32125:27:28:108:543:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: In the Results section, we introduce several modifications of the baseline specification to 
15:367:32217:28:27:72:544:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:check  the  robustness  of  the  baseline  results.  We  also  further  explore  adjacency  misvoting  as  it  
15:368:32328:27:28:71:543:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:relates to voteshare lost by the major candidates, precinct-level demographic characteristics, and

15:373:32479:30:28:108:545:197:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:  Regression  (1)  in  Table  2  shows  the  results  of  the  baseline  specification.  It  is  a  least  
15:374:32586:28:27:72:544:169:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:squares  regression  of  precinct-level  voteshares  of  each  minor  candidate  on  Adjacent, a variable 
15:375:32692:27:28:72:544:142:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:equal  to  the  voteshare  of  the  associated  major  candidate  if  the  minor  candidate  is  adjacent  to  a  
15:376:32806:28:28:72:544:114:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:major  candidate  and  zero  otherwise.  Because  voteshares  of  major  candidates  are  expressed  as  
15:377:32911:28:0:72:543:86:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:fractions  and  voteshares  of  minor  candidates  as  percentages,  the  coefficient  on  Adjacent 
16:378:33012:0:27:72:546:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:represents  the  percentage  of  voters  that  misvote  for  each  minor  candidate  adjacent  to  their  
16:379:33118:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:preferred major candidate. Regression (1) reveals that each minor candidate adjacent to a major 
16:380:33214:28:27:72:545:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidate  will  experience  an  increase  in  votes  equal  to  0.104%  of  the  intended  votes  for  that  
16:381:33324:27:28:72:544:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:major  candidate.  This  result  is  significant  at  the  one  percent  level  and  is  clear  evidence  of  the  
16:382:33439:28:28:72:245:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:bounded rationality of some voters. 
16:383:33475:28:27:108:543:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Regression (2) in Table 2 decomposes adjacency misvoting by major candidate. It shows 
16:384:33561:27:28:72:544:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:a  regression  of  minor  candidate  voteshare  on  the  interaction  between  Adjacent  and  a  vector  of  
16:385:33670:28:27:72:543:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:dummy variables representing each major candidate. It shows that Bustamante loses 0.143% of 
16:386:33762:27:28:72:545:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:his  vote  to  each  of  his  adjacent  minor  candidates,  but  that  the  corresponding  figure  is  only  
16:387:33871:28:28:72:545:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:0.088%  for  Schwarzenegger  and  0.107%  for  McClintock.    This  result  is  striking  because  it  
16:388:33974:28:27:72:544:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:implies that Bustamante voters are 63% more likely to misvote than are Schwarzenegger voters. 
16:389:34068:27:28:72:542:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Thus, if Bustamante had received as high a voteshare as Schwarzenegger, Bustamante’s adjacent 
16:390:34162:28:27:72:547:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidates  would  have  gained  63%  more  misvotes  relative  to  Schwarzenegger’s  adjacent  
16:391:34258:27:28:72:545:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidates.    This  result  has  important  consequences  because  voteshare  gained  by  an  adjacent  
16:392:34363:28:27:72:544:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidate  is  voteshare  lost  by  the  associated  major  candidate.  In  later  regressions,  we  present  
16:393:34473:27:28:71:544:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:evidence  that  Bustamante  lost  more  votes  than  the  other  major  candidates  because  he  attracted  
16:394:34581:28:28:71:430:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:voters from demographic groups associated with high levels of misvoting. 
16:395:34654:28:27:107:544:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Regression  (3)  in  Table  1  shows  a  variation  of  the  baseline  regression  in  which  minor  
16:396:34755:27:28:71:545:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidate  voteshare  is  regressed  on  Adjacent  Dummy,  a  dummy  variable  equaling  one  if  a  
16:397:34856:28:27:71:544:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidate  is  adjacent  to  a  major  candidate.  The  coefficient  on  Adjacent  Dummy  represents  the  
16:398:34963:27:28:71:545:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:average  gain  in  voteshare  a  minor  candidate  experiences  when  she  is  adjacent  to  a  major  
16:399:35066:28:28:71:543:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidate. Results show that minor candidates gain 0.037 percentage points in voteshare if they 
16:400:35162:28:0:71:542:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:are adjacent to a major candidate. Given that the average voteshare of minor candidates is 0.05% 
17:401:35261:0:27:72:544:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:percent,  being  adjacent  to  a  major  candidate  nearly  doubles  a  minor  candidate’s  voteshare.  A  
17:402:35368:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:calculation taking into account the magnitude of adjacency misvoting for each type of adjacency 
17:403:35464:28:27:72:544:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(i.e.  north,  south,  east,  and  west),  along  with  the  average  number  of  adjacent  candidates  per  
17:404:35573:27:28:72:544:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:ballot  (see  Appendix  3),  reveals  that  misvotes  accounted  for  at  least  0.25%  (SE=0.03%)  of  all  
17:405:35682:28:28:72:543:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:votes cast in the Recall Election. Further, if Schwarzenegger and Bustamante had received equal 
17:406:35778:28:27:72:550:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:shares   of   the   votes   received   by   the   major   candidates,   misvotes   would   have   given   
17:407:35884:27:28:72:244:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Schwarzenegger an edge of 0.06%. 
17:408:35917:28:27:108:546:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Table  3  presents  a  series  of  regressions  that  support  the  robustness  of  our  primary  
17:409:36015:27:28:72:543:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f3:findings. Regression (1) in Table 3 shows a regression of minor candidate voteshare on Adjacent 
17:410:36111:28:28:72:544:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f1:Dummy,  a  dummy  variable  equaling  one  if  a  minor  candidate  is  adjacent  to  one  of  the  major  
17:411:36218:28:27:72:546:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidates  and  Adjacent,  equal  to  the  product  of  Adjacent  Dummy  and  the  precinct-level  
17:412:36318:27:28:72:547:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:voteshare  of  an  adjacent  candidate’s  associated  major  candidate.  Regression  (1)  tests  our  
17:413:36420:28:27:72:543:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:assumption that adjacent candidates gain voteshare as a positive function of the popularity of the 
17:414:36519:27:28:72:545:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:major  candidate.  Results  suggest  that  our  assumption  is  valid  –  adjacent  candidates  earn  only  
17:415:36627:28:27:72:543:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:0.010 percentage points in voteshare (a result that is not significantly different from zero at the 
17:416:36727:27:28:72:545:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:10%  level)  if  they  are  adjacent  to  a  major  candidate  that  earns  zero  voteshare  in  a  precinct.  
17:417:36838:28:28:72:545:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Further,  adjacent  candidates  gain  an  additional  0.00082  percentage  points  for  each  additional  
17:418:36944:28:27:72:493:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:percentage point gained by a major candidate. This result is significant at the 1% level. 
17:419:37034:27:28:108:543:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Regression (2) in Table 3 tests that our primary results are driven by variation in when a 
17:420:37125:28:27:72:543:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidate is adjacent to a major candidate rather than by variation in the voteshares of associated 
17:421:37225:27:28:72:543:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:major candidates. Instead of regressing minor candidate voteshare on the product of an adjacency 
17:422:37322:28:28:72:543:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:dummy and the precinct-level voteshares of associated major candidates, Regression (2) uses the 
17:423:37418:28:0:72:542:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:product of an adjacency dummy and the statewide voteshares of the associated major candidates 
18:424:37514:0:27:72:539:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:as  the  independent  variable.  By  substituting  statewide  major  candidate  voteshare  for  precinct-
18:425:37619:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:level voteshare, we retain our assumption that adjacent candidates should gain more votes when 
18:426:37714:28:27:72:543:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:they border more popular major candidates. However, now the only variation in the independent 
18:427:37808:27:28:72:544:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:variable is caused by the adjacency of minor candidates to major candidates. The coefficient on 
18:428:37904:28:28:72:543:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f1:Adjacent Dummy×CA Voteshare is 0.112 and significant at the 1% level. More importantly, it is 
18:429:37998:28:27:72:544:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:very  similar  in  magnitude  to  the  coefficient  of  0.104  on  Adjacent  in  Regression  (1)  of  Table  1,  
18:430:38111:27:28:72:528:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:confirming that our results are driven by variation in the adjacency status of minor candidates. 
18:431:38208:28:27:108:545:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Regression  (3)  in  Table  3  decomposes  adjacency  misvoting  by  type  of  adjacency.  We  
18:432:38303:27:28:72:543:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:define a minor candidate to be adjacent if she borders a major candidate to the north, south, east 
18:433:38402:28:28:72:546:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:or  west.  This  regression  shows  that  misvoting  is  strongest  when  a  minor  candidate  is  east  
18:434:38507:28:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adjacent and weakest when a minor candidate is west adjacent; 0.143% of voters misvote for east 
18:435:38603:27:28:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adjacent candidates, only 0.038% of voters misvote for west adjacent candidates, while 0.082% 
18:436:38697:28:27:72:543:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and 0.111% of voters misvote for north and south adjacent candidates respectively. We explore 
18:437:38791:27:28:72:546:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:why  east  adjacent  candidates  gain  more  in  voteshare  than  west  adjacent  candidates  in  our  
18:438:38894:28:27:72:545:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:discussion  of  Regression  (6).  For  now,  we  note  that  Regression  (3)  shows  that  adjacency  
18:439:38996:27:28:72:544:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:misvoting  is  not  driven  merely  by  name  confusion.  One  might  think  that  voters  vote  for  north  
18:440:39105:28:28:72:543:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and south adjacent candidates because candidates are listed in order (according to a randomized 
18:441:39201:28:27:72:543:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:alphabet) down a column. For example, on the majority of ballots, the south adjacent candidate 
18:442:39296:27:28:72:548:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:for   Arnold   Schwarzenegger   is   George   Schwartzman.   Voters   may   mistakenly   vote   for   
18:443:39398:28:27:72:544:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Schwartzman  because  his  last  name  somewhat  resembles  “Schwarzenegger.”  We  use  candidate  
18:444:39497:27:28:72:543:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:fixed effects to control for the direct effect of name confusion, but one might believe that it is the 
18:445:39600:28:28:72:545:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:interaction  between  name  confusion  and  adjacency  that  drives  adjacency  misvotes.  However,  
18:446:39701:28:0:72:543:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:east and west adjacent candidates are one column off from a major candidate and therefore have 
19:447:39798:0:27:72:544:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:last  names  that  are  dissimilar  to  the  names  of  their  associated  major  candidates.  The  fact  that  
19:448:39910:27:28:72:546:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:these  adjacent  candidates  also  gain  voteshare  of  comparable  magnitude  suggests  that  it  is  
19:449:40013:28:27:72:410:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adjacency rather than name confusion that drives adjacency misvotes. 
19:450:40082:27:28:108:543:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Regression (4) in Table 3 explores the voteshare gained by candidates that are diagonally 
19:451:40172:28:28:72:544:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adjacent  to  major  candidates.  Diagonally  adjacent  candidates  are  one  row  and  one  column  off  
19:452:40278:28:27:72:544:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:from their associated major candidate. Regression (4) shows that diagonally adjacent candidates 
19:453:40374:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:earn much less in voteshare than candidates that are horizontally or vertically adjacent. 0.002% 
19:454:40471:28:27:72:543:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of voters misvote for each diagonally adjacent candidate compared to the 0.104% of voters that 
19:455:40566:27:28:72:546:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:misvote  for  each  vertically  or  horizontally  adjacent  candidate.  Further,  the  coefficient  on  
19:456:40670:28:28:72:544:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f1:Diagonally  Adjacent  is  not  significant  at  the  10%  level.  Low  voteshare  gains  for  diagonally  
19:457:40776:28:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adjacent candidates likely occur because voters are less likely to misvote for candidates one row 
19:458:40874:27:28:72:544:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f1:and  one  column  removed  from  their  intended  choices.  Because  diagonally  adjacent  candidates  
19:459:40977:28:27:72:545:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:gain  very  little  in  voteshare,  we  restrict  our  analysis  to  vertically  or  horizontally  adjacent  
19:460:41086:27:28:72:129:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidates. 
19:461:41098:28:27:108:542:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Regressions (5) and (6) offer insight into what causes misvotes. We find that misvotes are 
19:462:41189:27:28:72:543:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:primarily caused by accidental mistakes rather than the increased consideration voters may give 
19:463:41285:28:28:72:544:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:to  candidates  adjacent  to  their  preferred  major  candidates.  Regression  (5)  in  Table  3  explores  
19:464:41394:28:27:72:545:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:misvoting  for  candidates  adjacent  to  major  candidates  on  punch  cards.  Nineteen  percent  of  
19:465:41497:27:28:72:543:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:counties in California used punch card voting machines that require each voter to search for her 
19:466:41594:28:27:72:544:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:desired  candidate  and  that  candidate’s  associated  number  from  a  booklet  of  candidate  names.  
19:467:41699:27:28:72:543:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Each voter then punched out the desired candidate’s number on a separate punch card. A sample 
19:468:41793:28:28:72:543:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:punch card is provided in Appendix 1. Because the length of columns on the punch card differs 
19:469:41887:28:0:72:544:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:from  column  length  in  the  text  ballot,  a  minor  candidate  can  be  punch  card  adjacent  without  
20:470:41997:0:27:72:545:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:being  adjacent  on  a  regular  ballot  and  vice  versa.  The  punch  card  lists  only  numbers,  so  
20:471:42102:27:28:71:546:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:voteshare  gained  by  punch  card  adjacent  candidates  should  represent  gains  due  to  voting  
20:472:42203:28:27:72:546:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:mistakes.  Voters  are  unlikely  to  first  locate  a  preferred  major  candidate  and  then  to  give  
20:473:42309:27:28:72:544:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:increased consideration to numbers adjacent to the major candidate’s number if they do not see 
20:474:42404:28:28:72:546:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:any  names  associated  with  those  numbers.  Regression  (5)  shows  that,  controlling  for  the  
20:475:42505:28:27:72:544:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adjacency  of  minor  candidates  on  the  regular  ballot,  0.030%  of  voters  misvote  for  each  punch  
20:476:42613:27:28:72:544:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:card adjacent candidate. This result is only significant at the ten percent level, perhaps because 
20:477:42712:28:27:72:545:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:our  limited  observations  involving  punch  card  adjacency  do  not  have  enough  power  to  yield  
20:478:42816:27:28:72:544:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:significant  results.  Nevertheless,  this  result  supports  our  hypothesis  that  adjacency  misvotes  do  
20:479:42926:28:28:72:406:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:not derive only from increased consideration of adjacent candidates.  
20:480:42996:28:27:108:543:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Regression (6) in Table 3 presents additional evidence that adjacency misvotes are driven 
20:481:43086:27:28:72:544:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:by  accidental  votes  rather  than  by  increased  consideration  of  adjacent  candidates.  We  regress  
20:482:43193:28:27:72:546:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:minor  candidate  voteshare  on  Adjacent  and  Adjacent×Confusing  Side. Confusing  Side  is  a  
20:483:43291:27:28:72:543:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:dummy variable equaling one if the minor candidate is horizontally adjacent to a major candidate 
20:484:43388:28:27:72:544:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and  listed  in  the  column  with  selection  boxes  closest  to  the  name  of  the  major  candidate.  For  
20:485:43499:27:28:72:544:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:example,  in  a  single  row,  we  might  read  from  left  to  right:  bubble,  minor  candidate,  bubble,  
20:486:43608:28:28:72:544:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:major  candidate,  bubble,  minor  candidate.  See  the  figures  in  Appendix  1  for  examples.  In  this  
20:487:43717:28:27:72:543:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:case, the bubble for the east adjacent candidate is very close to the name of the major candidate 
20:488:43815:27:28:72:544:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and  a  voter  may  accidentally  fill  in  the  east  adjacent  candidate’s  bubble  believing  that  she  has  
20:489:43928:28:27:72:544:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:cast  a  vote  for  the  major  candidate.  Thus,  confusing  side  equals  one  if  a  horizontally  adjacent  
20:490:44040:27:28:72:543:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidate is listed in a position that may be most confusing to the voter. After controlling for the 
20:491:44141:28:28:71:542:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:effects  of  north  and  south  adjacency,  we  find  that  the  coefficient  on  Horizontally  Adjacent  is 
20:492:44250:28:0:71:543:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:0.031 while the coefficient on Horizontally Adjacent×Confusing side is 0.123. This implies that 
21:493:44348:0:27:72:544:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:0.031%  of  voters  misvote  for  each  horizontally  adjacent  candidates  not  on  the  confusing  side  
21:494:44455:27:28:72:544:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:while  0.031%+0.123%=0.154%  of  voters  misvote  for  each  horizontally  adjacent  candidate  on  
21:495:44555:28:27:72:542:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the confusing side. Thus, voters are five times more likely to misvote for candidates listed on the 
21:496:44655:27:28:72:545:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:confusing  side.  This  implies  that  adjacency  misvotes  are,  in  large  part,  driven  by  accidental  
21:497:44763:28:28:72:544:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:voting  mistakes,  because  increased  consideration  should  not  depend  on  how  each  candidate’s  
21:498:44866:28:27:72:545:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:bubble  is  located  relative  to  the  major  candidates.  Regression  (6)  may  also  explain  why  the  
21:499:44973:27:28:72:542:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:coefficient on East Adjacent is stronger than the coefficient on West Adjacent in Regression (3). 
21:500:45071:28:27:71:543:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:For 63% of the multi-column ballots used in the Recall Election, selection boxes were placed to 
21:501:45167:27:28:71:543:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the left of each candidate’s name. Therefore, the selection boxes of east adjacent candidates were 
21:502:45266:28:28:71:327:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:usually closest to the names of the major candidates. 
21:503:45320:28:27:107:543:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Regression (6) also delivers clear policy implications. Adjacency misvoting is extremely 
21:504:45409:27:28:71:543:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:high in cases when it is ambiguous which selection boxes correspond to each candidate’s name. 
21:505:45503:28:27:71:543:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Therefore, adjacency misvoting may be reduced if columns and rows are spaced farther apart, so 
21:506:45598:27:28:71:542:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that there is a clear separation between the each candidate’s selection box and all other selection 
21:507:45698:28:40:71:105:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:boxes. 
21:508:45705:40:30:71:230:282:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:2. Demographic Characteristics 
21:509:45735:30:28:108:543:252:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The cognitive costs of voting, given complex ballot designs and voting technology, may 
21:510:45822:28:27:72:543:224:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:be higher among certain demographic groups than others. This leads to systematic disadvantages 
21:511:45917:27:28:72:542:197:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:for major candidates that attract groups more likely to misvote. Below, we show how the amount 
21:512:46012:28:27:72:544:169:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of  misvoting  varies  with  precinct-level  demographic  characteristics.  We  find  that  voters  from  
21:513:46118:27:28:72:548:142:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:precincts   with   high   misvote   rates   disproportionally   favored   Democratic   candidate   Cruz   
21:514:46224:28:28:72:544:114:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Bustamante and that voter demographics may explain why Bustamante lost a higher proportion 
21:515:46315:28:0:72:440:86:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of his votes to adjacent candidates than did Schwarzenegger or McClintock. 
22:516:46392:0:27:108:543:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A growing literature suggests that the level of residual votes, i.e. votes that are discarded 
22:517:46486:27:28:72:542:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:because voters vote for more than one candidate, leave hanging chads, etc., depends on the racial 
22:518:46584:28:27:72:539:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and socioeconomic composition of each precinct. Tomz and Van Houweling (2003) use precinct-
22:519:46675:27:28:72:544:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:level  data  from  South  Carolina  and  Louisiana’s  2000  Presidential  Election  to  find  that  in  areas  
22:520:46786:28:28:72:544:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:with  punch  card  or  optically  scanned  ballots,  the Black-White gap in residual voteshare ranged 
22:521:46888:28:27:72:543:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:from four to six percentage points. In comparison, lever and touch screen machines cut the gap in 
22:522:46986:27:28:72:545:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:residual  voteshares  by  a  factor  of  ten.  Tomz  and  Van  Houweling  do  not  control  for  income,  
22:523:47092:28:27:72:545:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:education,  and  other  demographic  variables  in  their  analysis.  However,  even  controlling  for  
22:524:47196:27:28:72:545:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:socioeconomic  differences,  the  racial  gap  remains  significant.  Knack  and  Kropf  (2003)  use  
22:525:47298:28:28:72:544:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:county-level  data  from  the  1996  Presidential  Election  to  find  that  counties  with  more  Black  or  
22:526:47408:28:27:72:544:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Hispanic  voters  have  higher  residual  vote  tallies,  controlling  for  income,  education  and  voting  
22:527:47517:27:28:72:131:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:technology. 
22:528:47529:28:27:108:543:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:To our knowledge, no research has yet explored how the prevalence of misvoting varies 
22:529:47615:27:28:72:544:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:by  demographic  characteristics.  To  test  how  misvoting  varies  by  precinct-level  demographic  
22:530:47717:28:27:72:543:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:characteristics, we interact the variable Adjacent with precinct-level demographic characteristics 
22:531:47816:27:28:72:545:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f1:Demopd,  and  add  this  interaction  to  the  baseline  specification.13  If  Demopd  represents  a  single  
22:532:47926:28:28:72:544:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:variable,  then  the  coefficient  on  Adjacent×Demopd  represents  the  additional  gain  in  voteshare  
22:533:48032:28:27:72:545:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:caused  by  adjacency  misvoting  when  Demopd  and  all  other  demographic  variables  positively  
22:534:48133:27:28:72:545:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:correlated  with  Demopd increases.  Meanwhile,  if  Demopd  represents  a  vector  of  demographic  
22:535:48233:28:27:72:543:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:characteristics, the coefficients on Adjacent×Demopd represent the marginal change in the gain in 
22:536:48331:27:28:71:543:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:voteshare  caused  by  adjacency  misvotes  for  an  increase  in  each  demographic  variable,  holding  
22:537:48437:28:32:71:545:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the  other  measured  demographic  variables  constant.  This  distinction  is  important  in  cases  in  
22:538:48543:32:7:216:219:97:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:                                                 
22:539:48591:7:16:72:510:90:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:13 The direct effect of Demopd is absorbed by the Demopd×candidate fixed effects interactions that are already 
22:540:48702:16:0:71:225:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:included in the baseline specification. 
23:541:48744:0:27:72:544:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:which  the  partial  effect  differs  from  the  overall  change.  For  example,  we  find  that  adjacency  
23:542:48853:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:misvoting is stronger in precincts with many registered Democrats. However, this overall effect 
23:543:48949:28:27:72:544:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:is  driven  by  the  fact  that  many  registered  Democrats  have  other  characteristics  (such  as  less  
23:544:49058:27:28:72:544:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:education)  that  may  cause  them  to  make  more  voting  mistakes.  If  we  hold  these  characteristics  
23:545:49167:28:28:72:543:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:constant, we find that the partial effect of a greater percentage of registered Democrats does not 
23:546:49266:28:27:71:167:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:increase misvoting. 
23:547:49286:27:28:107:544:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:  When  exploring  the  impact  of  demographic  characteristics  on  adjacency  misvoting,  we  
23:548:49383:28:27:72:542:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:use  the  same  set  of  controls  as  in  baseline  specification.    In  addition,  we  control  for  Demopd, 
23:549:49495:27:28:71:543:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f1:Techd and Adjacent×Techd where Techd is a vector of technology dummy variables representing 
23:550:49586:28:28:72:543:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the brand of technology used in each county-district. The controls for technology ensure that our 
23:551:49684:28:27:72:544:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:demographic  estimates  are  not  biased  because  of  a  possible  correlation  between  precinct-level  
23:552:49790:27:28:72:529:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:demographic characteristics and the voting technology of the precinct’s corresponding county. 
23:553:49884:28:27:108:547:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:There   are   two   caveats   to   the   demographic   results.   First,   even   if   a   demographic   
23:554:49989:27:28:72:546:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:characteristic  such  as  low  education  is  correlated  with  higher  levels  of  misvoting,  lack  of  
23:555:50095:28:27:72:545:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:education  may  not  be  the  cause  of  adjacency  misvotes.  For  example,  it  is  conceivable  that  
23:556:50200:27:28:72:545:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:education  is  positively  correlated  with  experience  taking  standardized  exams,  and  experience  
23:557:50304:28:28:72:545:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:with  standardized  exams  is  what  truly  reduces  levels  of  misvoting.  Second,  the  ecological  
23:558:50407:28:27:72:543:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:fallacy, as explained by Achen and Shively (1995), states that analysis using precinct-level data 
23:559:50505:27:28:72:543:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:does not necessarily imply direct links between individual demographics characteristics and the 
23:560:50601:28:27:72:543:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:magnitude of adjacency misvoting. For example, a regression might show that a precinct with a 
23:561:50695:27:28:72:543:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:60% Asian and 40% White population casts misvotes at a higher rate than does a precinct with a 
23:562:50790:28:28:72:543:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:10% Asian population and a 90% White population. This does not necessarily imply that Asian 
23:563:50882:28:0:72:544:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:voters  are  more  likely  to  cast  misvotes.  It  could  instead  be  the  case  that  the  White  voters  who  
24:564:50998:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:choose to live in predominantly Asian precincts cast misvotes at a higher rate. Nevertheless, we 
24:565:51095:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:argue that precinct-level demographic data offers important insights. Precinct-level demographic 
24:566:51192:28:27:72:431:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:data reveal which types of precincts exhibit stronger adjacency misvoting. 
24:567:51267:27:28:108:544:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:  Regression  (1)  in  Table  4  shows  that  a  one  percentage  point  increase  in  the  number  of  
24:568:51371:28:28:72:543:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:voters with a high school degree corresponds to a 0.0062 percentage point fall in the percentage 
24:569:51468:28:27:71:543:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of  voters  that  misvote  for  each  adjacent  candidate.  This  result  is  significant  at  the  five  percent  
24:570:51583:27:28:71:547:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:level.  The  coefficient  on  Adjacent×%College  Graduates  is  similar  with  value  of  -0.0056,  
24:571:51683:28:27:71:545:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:suggesting  that,  holding  high  school  education  constant,  college  education  has  no  additional  
24:572:51788:27:28:71:543:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:impact on misvoting. Thus, precincts with high percentages of high school graduates (including 
24:573:51883:28:28:71:542:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:college graduates) cast significantly fewer misvotes. The calculations in the last three columns of 
24:574:51983:28:27:71:543:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Table 4 show the difference in the percentage of voters that vote for each adjacent candidate for 
24:575:52081:27:28:71:542:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:precincts  at  the  5th  percentile  of  a  demographic  variable  compared  to  precincts  at  the  95th 
24:576:52186:28:27:71:543:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:percentile. Holding the fraction with a college education constant, the percentage of voters that 
24:577:52284:27:28:71:542:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:misvote  for  each  adjacent  candidate  is  0.22  percentage  points  lower  in  precincts  at  the  95th 
24:578:52390:28:27:71:545:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:percentile  of  high  school  education  than  in  precincts  at  the  5th  percentile.  This  difference  is  
24:579:52501:27:28:72:544:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:double the average percentage of voters that misvote for each adjacent candidate.  This result is 
24:580:52599:28:28:72:544:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:consistent with evidence from Lusardi and Mitchell (2006) and Benjamin et al. (2006). Lusardi 
24:581:52693:28:27:72:544:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and Mitchell also find that lack of education is a strong predictor of making mistakes, but in the 
24:582:52792:27:28:72:544:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:context  of  simple  questions  about  interest,  inflation  and  risk  diversification.    Benjamin  et  al.  
24:583:52903:28:27:72:543:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:present experimental evidence that lower cognitive ability, rather than lack of schooling per se, is 
24:584:53004:27:28:72:295:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:a powerful predictor of behavioral anomalies. 
24:585:53050:28:28:108:543:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Regression (2) in table 4 shows that, holding the percentage of precinct residents that are 
24:586:53142:28:0:72:544:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Black  and  Asian  constant,  a  one  percentage  point  increase  in  the  number  of  Hispanic  residents  
25:587:53253:0:27:72:544:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:corresponds  to  a  0.0038  percentage  point  increase  in  the  percentage  of  voters  that  misvote  for  
25:588:53363:27:28:72:546:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:each  adjacent  candidate.  This  result  is  significant  at  the  one  percent  level.  Meanwhile,  the  
25:589:53470:28:27:72:545:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:coefficients  on  Adjacent×%Black  and  Adjacent×%Asian  are  small  with  standard  errors  near  
25:590:53569:27:28:71:544:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:zero,  implying  that  precincts  with  high  percentages  of  Black  or  Asian  residents  do  not  behave  
25:591:53678:28:28:71:544:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:significantly  differently  from  precincts  with  high  percentages  of  White  residents  (the  omitted  
25:592:53785:28:27:71:545:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:category).  Holding  the  percentage  of  Black  and  Asian  residents  constant,  the  percentage  of  
25:593:53889:27:28:71:543:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:voters  that  misvote  for  each  adjacent  candidate  is  0.23  percentage  points  higher  in  precincts  at  
25:594:54001:28:27:71:544:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the  95th  percentile  of  percent  Hispanic  than  in  precincts  at  the  5th  percentile.  This  difference  is  
25:595:54117:27:28:72:488:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:also double the average percentage of voters that misvote for each adjacent candidate. 
25:596:54204:28:28:108:543:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Regression (3) in table 4 shows how misvoting varies by the party registration of voters. 
25:597:54294:28:27:72:540:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The  coefficients  on  Adjacent×%Republican and Adjacent×%Independent  are  -0.0025  and  -
25:598:54385:27:28:72:547:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:0.0068,  respectively,  while  the  coefficient  on  Adjacent×%Other  Party  is  not  significantly  
25:599:54486:28:27:72:543:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:different from zero. Since the omitted category is %Democrat, these results show that precincts 
25:600:54582:27:28:72:544:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:with  high  percentages  of  Republican  or  Independent  voters  misvote  at  significantly  lower  rates  
25:601:54690:28:27:72:545:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:than  precincts  with  high  percentages  of  Democratic  or  Other  Party  voters.  A  one  percentage  
25:602:54795:27:28:72:542:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:point increase in the number of registered Republicans corresponds to a 0.0025% point fall in the 
25:603:54893:28:28:72:547:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:percentage  of  voters  that  misvote  for  each  adjacent  candidate.  Holding  the  percentage  of  
25:604:54995:28:27:72:545:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Independent  and  Other  Party  voters  constant,  the  percentage  of  voters  that  misvote  for  each  
25:605:55101:27:28:72:543:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adjacent candidate is 0.128 percentage points lower in precincts at the 95th percentile of percent 
25:606:55200:28:27:72:547:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Republican   than   in   precincts   at   the   5th   percentile.   Similarly,   holding   the   percentage   of   
25:607:55315:27:28:72:545:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Republican  and  Other  Party  constant,  the  percentage  of  voters  that  misvote  for  each  adjacent  
25:608:55422:28:0:72:547:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidate  is  0.170  percentage  points  lower  in  precincts  at  the  95th  percentile  of  percent  
26:609:55528:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Independent than in precincts at the 5th percentile. These differences are greater than the average 
26:610:55628:27:28:71:371:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:percentage of voters that misvote for each adjacent candidate. 
26:611:55691:28:27:107:545:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:  Table  5  presents  regressions  exploring  how  adjacency  misvotes  vary  with  five  other  
26:612:55788:27:28:71:544:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:precinct-level  demographic  variables:  median  household  income  in  thousands  of  U.S.  dollars,  
26:613:55891:28:28:71:544:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:percent living below the Census poverty line, percent lacking English fluency, percent over the 
26:614:55987:28:27:71:544:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:age  of  65,  and  percent  between  the  ages  of  18  and  24.  All  specifications  show  a  significant  
26:615:56096:27:28:71:549:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:coefficient   on   the   interaction   term,   Adjacent×X   where   X   represents   the   demographic   
26:616:56201:28:27:71:547:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:characteristic  of  interest.  These  coefficients  imply  that  precincts  with  high  percentages  of  
26:617:56306:27:28:71:545:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:residents  between  the  ages  of  18  and  24,  living  below  the  poverty  line,  or  lacking  fluency  in  
26:618:56417:28:28:71:543:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:English14 exhibit higher levels of misvoting. Precincts with high percentages of residents above 
26:619:56514:28:27:72:544:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the age of 65 also exhibit higher levels of misvoting, although the effect is smaller than for the 
26:620:56613:27:28:72:544:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:other  characteristics.15  Conversely,  precincts  with  high  median  household  income  exhibit  low  
26:621:56717:28:27:72:543:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:levels of misvoting. Calculations in the last three rows of Table 5 estimate the difference in the 
26:622:56816:27:28:72:543:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:magnitude of adjacency misvoting between precincts at the 5th and 95th percentile in terms of X, 
26:623:56913:28:27:72:546:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the  demographic  variable  of  interest.    These  calculations  reveal  that  differences  in  these  
26:624:57017:27:28:72:547:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:demographic   characteristics   correspond   to   large   changes   in   the   magnitude   of   adjacency   
26:625:57125:28:28:72:543:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:misvoting.    The  results  for  low  income  precincts  are  consistent  with  Madrian  and  Shea  (2001),  
26:626:57234:28:38:72:539:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Choi  et  al.  (2004),  and  Thaler  and  Benartzi  (2004),  who  in  different  settings,  find  that  lower-
26:627:57344:38:8:216:219:201:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:                                                 
26:628:57392:8:16:72:508:193:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:14 We also test how the relationship between the percentage of voters lacking English fluency and adjacency 
26:629:57500:16:11:72:528:177:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:misvoting changes conditional on the availability of foreign language ballots. During the Recall Election, 80% of 
26:630:57614:11:12:72:542:166:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:precincts offered Spanish ballots while 40% of precincts offered ballots in at least one Asian language. Results show 
26:631:57732:12:11:72:527:154:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:that adjacency misvoting is stronger in precincts that offer Spanish ballots. In addition, the availability of foreign 
26:632:57851:11:12:71:526:143:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:language ballots does not significantly change the relationship between English fluency and adjacency misvotes. 
26:633:57963:12:11:71:527:131:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:However, it is difficult to draw causal conclusions from these results because the availability of foreign language 
26:634:58079:11:7:71:281:120:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:ballots is endogenously determined by each county. 
26:635:58130:7:16:72:532:113:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:15 Age 65 was chosen as the cutoff because voter registration data does not distinguish age groups for ages greater 
26:636:58246:16:12:72:510:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:than 65. Voter registration data may provide a better estimate of actual voter demographics than Census data 
26:637:58355:12:11:72:539:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:because a higher percentage of registered voters vote on Election Day. However, results do not significantly change 
26:638:58471:11:0:72:274:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:using older age cutoffs derived from Census data. 
27:639:58523:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:income employees are more likely to conform to the default savings options by their employers, 
27:640:58618:27:28:72:544:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:which  is  likely  because  these  employees  have  a  higher  cognition  cost  of  making  the  optimal  
27:641:58724:28:27:72:162:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:savings decisions. 
27:642:58743:27:28:108:543:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:  Table  6  shows  the  results  of  a  regression of minor candidate voteshare on Adjacent and 
27:643:58839:28:28:72:543:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the  interaction  between  Adjacent  and  a  vector  of  precinct-level  demographics.  The  coefficients  
27:644:58946:28:27:72:546:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:on  the  interaction  terms  are  partial  effects;  they  represent  the  change  in  the  magnitude  of  
27:645:59053:27:28:72:546:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adjacency  misvoting  for  a  change  in  a  single  demographic  characteristic  when  the  other  
27:646:59153:28:27:72:542:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:demographic characteristics are held constant.  We find that the partial effect of the percentage of 
27:647:59254:27:28:72:545:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:registered  Democrats  is  not  significantly  different  from  the  partial  effects  of  other  political  
27:648:59363:28:28:72:544:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:affiliations.16  Altogether,  the  demographic  interactions  show  that  misvoting  increases  with  the  
27:649:59470:28:27:71:544:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:fraction  Hispanic  or  Asian,  the  fraction  elderly  and  the  fraction  in  poverty,  while  it  decreases  
27:650:59582:27:28:71:527:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:with the fraction with at least a high school degree, and the fraction lacking English fluency.17 
27:651:59679:28:27:108:549:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:These   demographic   trends   shed   light   on   why,   relative   to   Schwarzenegger   and   
27:652:59776:27:28:72:543:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:McClintock, Bustamante lost more votes to adjacent candidates. If the three candidates had been 
27:653:59872:28:27:71:544:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:equally  popular,  Bustamante  would  have  lost  63%  more  votes  than  Schwarzenegger  and  34%  
27:654:59972:27:28:71:547:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:more  votes  than  McClintock.  Using  demographic  trends,  we  estimate  how  much  of  the  
27:655:60067:28:28:71:544:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:difference in voteshare lost by each major candidate can be accounted for by differences in the 
27:656:60163:28:38:71:543:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:demographic characteristics of each major candidate’s voting base.18 We find that, compared to 
27:657:60258:38:8:216:219:201:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:                                                 
27:658:60306:8:16:72:524:193:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:16 The percentage of voters registered with the Democratic Party is negatively correlated with median household 
27:659:60418:16:11:72:540:177:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:income and the percentage of residents with high school diplomas, both of which are associated with lower levels of 
27:660:60534:11:12:72:509:166:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:misvoting.  This explains why the percentage of registered democratic voters has a positive overall effect on 
27:661:60644:12:7:72:335:154:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:misvoting (Table 4) but a non-significant partial effect (Table 6). 
27:662:60712:7:16:72:524:147:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:17 The percentage of voters lacking English fluency is negatively correlated with income and education. Further, 
27:663:60825:16:11:72:531:131:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:over 80% of voters had access to foreign language ballots. This may explain why the percentage of voters lacking 
27:664:60938:11:7:72:500:120:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:English fluency has a positive overall effect on misvoting (Table 5) but a negative partial effect (Table 6). 
27:665:61048:7:16:72:536:113:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:18 We first estimate the number of misvotes cast in each precinct using each precinct’s demographic characteristics. 
27:666:61165:16:12:72:534:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:The estimated number of misvotes in each precinct multiplied by each major candidate’s performance in a precinct 
27:667:61278:12:11:72:537:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:(as a fraction of the total votes for the three major candidates) is an estimate of the number of misvotes lost by each 
27:668:61398:11:0:72:519:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:major candidate. After adjusting for the relative popularities of the major candidates, we find that demographic 
28:669:61513:0:27:72:549:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Schwarzenegger   and   McClintock,   Bustamante   attracted   voters   most   likely   to   misvote.   
28:670:61616:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Differences  in  the  observed  demographic  characteristics  of  each  major  candidate’s  voting  base  
28:671:61722:28:27:72:544:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:can  explain  roughly  one  half  of  the  difference  in  voteshare  lost.  Our  calculation  is  actually  a  
28:672:61834:27:28:72:544:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:lower  bound  for  the  explanatory  power  of  demographic  characteristics.  Since  our  data  is  at  the  
28:673:61944:28:28:72:544:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:precinct  level,  we  need  to  assume  that,  within  a  precinct,  Schwarzenegger,  Bustamante,  and  
28:674:62048:28:27:72:543:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:McClintock voters are equally likely to misvote for adjacent candidates. This is likely to be false 
28:675:62148:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:– within a precinct, Bustamante voters are probably more likely to cast misvotes. Therefore, we 
28:676:62244:28:27:72:545:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:underestimate  the  extent  to  which  demographic  characteristics  can  account  for  differences  in  
28:677:62349:27:28:72:267:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:voteshares lost by the major candidates.

28:679:62390:40:30:72:178:420:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:3. Voting Technology 
28:680:62410:30:28:108:543:390:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Numerous studies and policy initiatives have explored the effect of voting technology on 
28:681:62499:28:27:72:544:362:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the  number  of  discarded  ballots,  also  known  as  residual  votes.  These  studies  consistently  find  
28:682:62608:27:28:72:545:335:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that,  relative  to  optical  scan  and  electronic  technology  platforms,  the  punch  card  technology  
28:683:62715:28:27:72:543:307:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:platform is associated with the greatest number of residual votes. Brady et al. (2001) summarizes 
28:684:62813:27:28:72:544:280:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the  current  research  relating  to  voting  technology.  On  average,  residual  votes  account  for  two  
28:685:62922:28:28:72:543:252:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:percent of all votes in presidential races. Using county-level data from the 2000 U.S. Presidential 
28:686:63022:28:27:72:544:224:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Election,  Brady  et  al.  find  that  touch  screen  and  optical  scan  voting  technology  yield  half  the  
28:687:63134:27:28:72:544:197:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:level  of  residual  votes  found  in  elections  using  punch  card  technology.  Alvarez  et  al.  (2001)  
28:688:63243:28:60:72:483:169:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:employ similar methods to find results generally consistent with those of Brady et al. 
28:689:63330:60:12:539:542:109:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:                                                                                                                                                             
28:690:63486:12:12:72:507:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:characteristics predict that Bustamante lost 24% more votes than Schwarzenegger and 19% more votes than 
28:691:63590:12:11:72:511:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:McClintock. Thus demographic characteristics can account for at least 39% of the difference in votes lost by 
28:692:63699:11:0:72:500:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:Bustamante and Schwarzenegger and 57% of the difference in votes lost by Bustamante and McClintock.  
29:693:63802:0:27:108:546:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:While  numerous  studies  have  explored  the  relationship  between  technology  and  the  
29:694:63894:27:28:72:547:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:residual  vote,  much  less  research  has  explored  the  relationship  between  technology  and  
29:695:63993:28:27:72:543:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adjacency misvotes. Dee (2006) finds that punch card technology increases the voteshare gained 
29:696:64088:27:28:72:540:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:by “bookend” candidates, i.e. candidates vertically adjacent to major candidates. Using county-
29:697:64183:28:28:72:543:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:level data from the 2003 California Recall election, Dee shows that, relative to touch screen and 
29:698:64281:28:27:72:545:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:optical  scan  technology,  punch  card  technology  increases  the  voteshare  of  bookends  by  0.04  
29:699:64385:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:percentage  points  on  average,  an  increase  of  more  than  one-third  of  the  mean  voteshare  of  the  
29:700:64495:28:27:72:542:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:bookends. We extend Dee’s analysis to a precinct-level dataset that measures adjacency misvotes 
29:701:64591:27:28:72:545:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:based  upon  variation  in  when  candidates  are  vertically  and  horizontally  adjacent  to  major  
29:702:64694:28:28:72:545:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidates.  We  also  extend  Dee’s  analysis  by  exploring  whether  technology  differences  are  
29:703:64796:28:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:driven by platforms (i.e. punch card) or by individual technology brands. Further, we control for 
29:704:64894:27:28:72:546:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:precinct-level  demographic  characteristics  –  this  will  better  control  for  the  possibility  that  
29:705:65001:28:27:72:475:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:technology is correlated with demographic characteristics that influence misvoting. 
29:706:65085:27:28:108:544:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:To  study  the  relationship  between  technology  and  adjacency  misvoting,  we  interact  the  
29:707:65183:28:27:72:543:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:variable Adjacent with a vector of technology dummies Techd representing technology platforms 
29:708:65277:27:28:71:544:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:or  technology  brands.  We  add  this  interaction  and  Techd  itself  to  the  baseline  specification.  By  
29:709:65389:28:28:72:543:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:platform of technology, we refer to broad categories of technology such as touch screen, punch 
29:710:65484:28:27:72:543:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:card, or optical scan technology. By brands of technology, we refer to specific brands of voting 
29:711:65581:27:28:72:543:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:machines, e.g., the Diebold AccuVote-TS that uses the touch screen technology platform. For a 
29:712:65675:28:27:72:543:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:summary of the availability of each type of technology, see Appendix 1. In addition to the large 
29:713:65772:27:28:72:542:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:set  of  controls  included  in  the  baseline  regression,  we  now  add  controls  for  Adjacent×Demopd, 
29:714:65879:28:0:71:543:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:where Demopd is a vector of precinct-level demographic variables. This specification controls for 
30:715:65979:0:27:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the possibility that voting technology is correlated with precinct-level demographic variables and 
30:716:66078:27:28:71:339:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:separates technology effects from demographic effects. 
30:717:66133:28:27:107:543:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Regression (2) in Table 7 shows the relationship between voting technology platform and 
30:718:66221:27:28:72:544:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adjacency  misvoting.  Our  results  indicate  that  0.197%  of  voters  using  punch  card  technology  
30:719:66326:28:28:72:545:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:misvote  for  each  adjacent  candidate  compared  to  only  0.100%  and  0.065%  of  voters  using  
30:720:66427:28:27:72:551:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:optical    scan    and    touch    screen    technology    respectively.    Further,    the    coefficient    on    
30:721:66543:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f1:Adjacent×Punch Card is significantly different from the coefficients on Adjacent×Optical Scan 
30:722:66636:28:27:72:543:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and Adjacent×Touch Screen at the five percent level. These results suggest that touch screen and 
30:723:66733:27:28:72:543:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:optical  scan  technology  cut  the  prevalence  of  misvoting  roughly  in  half  relative  to  punch  card  
30:724:66843:28:28:71:542:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:technology. This result is consistent with the large literature (e.g., Alvarez et al. 2001 and Brady 
30:725:66944:28:27:72:544:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:et  al.  2001)  arguing  that  punch  card  technology  causes  the  greatest  number  of  residual  votes.  
30:726:67053:27:28:72:544:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:After all, residual votes are examples of detected voting mistakes while adjacency misvotes are 
30:727:67149:28:27:72:245:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:largely undetected voting mistakes. 
30:728:67185:27:28:108:543:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Regression (4) in Table 7 shows the relationship between the brand of voting technology 
30:729:67273:28:27:72:543:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and the magnitude of adjacency misvoting. Eleven brands of voting technology were used during 
30:730:67367:27:28:72:543:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the Recall Election. Each brand corresponded to one of three technology platforms: optical scan, 
30:731:67464:28:28:72:543:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:touch screen, or punch card. Further details concerning the distribution of technology brands are 
30:732:67562:28:27:72:544:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:included  in  Appendix  1.  Results  from  Regression  (2)  reveal  that,  controlling  for  the  impact  of  
30:733:67672:27:28:72:547:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:demographic  characteristics,  brands  tend  to  have  the  same  rate  of  misvoting  within  each  
30:734:67773:28:27:72:544:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:technology  class,  with  three  notable  exceptions:  the  optical  scan  Diebold  Accu-Vote-OS  has  a  
30:735:67879:27:28:72:543:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:level of misvoting that is comparable to typical punch card voting technologies, the punch card 
30:736:67975:28:0:72:543:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Datavote brand has a level of misvoting that is comparable to most optical scan and touch screen 
31:737:68074:0:27:72:544:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:technologies,19 and the touch screen Diebold AccuVote-TS is associated with an insignificantly 
31:738:68169:27:28:72:186:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:low level of misvoting. 
31:739:68193:28:27:108:542:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Results from regressions (2) and (4) are very similar to results from regression (1) and (3) 
31:740:68286:27:28:72:544:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:in which we do not control for precinct demographic characteristics. This supports evidence by 
31:741:68381:28:28:72:543:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Knack and Kropf (2002), Garner and Spalaore (2005), and Card and Moretti (2005) showing that 
31:742:68474:28:27:72:543:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:areas with low levels of education and income, and high levels of Black or Hispanic voters are 
31:743:68569:27:28:72:545:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:not  more  likely  to  have  “inferior”  technologies  such  as  punch  card  voting.  Of  course,  it  is  
31:744:68677:28:27:72:544:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:possible  that  precincts  in  counties  that  choose  to  adopt  each  brand  of  voting  technology  have  
31:745:68786:27:28:72:544:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:other  characteristics  not  already  accounted  for  by  the  demographic  controls  that  influence  the  
31:746:68894:28:28:72:544:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:magnitude of adjacency misvoting. We cannot simply conclude that touch screen technology is 
31:747:68986:28:27:72:548:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:“better”   than   punch   card   technology   because   technology   may   be   endogenously   chosen.   
31:748:69091:27:28:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:However, the technology brand analysis does suggest that a simple switch away from the punch 
31:749:69184:28:27:72:543:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:card  technology  platform  may  not  automatically  reduce  the  level  adjacency  misvoting.  Careful  
31:750:69289:27:28:72:356:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:consideration of inter-brand differences may be necessary.

31:752:69348:40:30:72:223:282:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:4. Applications and Extensions 
31:753:69378:30:28:108:545:252:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:While  the  small  but  significant  loss  of  votes  to  adjacent  candidates  did  not  change  the  
31:754:69481:28:27:72:544:224:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:outcome  of  the  Recall  Election,  it  may  have  important  implications  for  elections  in  general.  
31:755:69588:27:28:72:545:197:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Numerous  presidential,  senatorial,  and  gubernatorial  elections  have  been  determined  by  very  
31:756:69691:28:37:72:543:169:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:slim margins of victory. The margins of victory of the popular vote in the Presidential Elections 
31:757:69789:37:8:216:219:132:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:                                                 
31:758:69837:8:16:72:542:124:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:19 The Datavote punch card brand distinguishes itself from the other two punch card brands in that it allows voters to 
31:759:69956:16:11:72:527:108:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:punch out their selections on the regular ballots (rather than requiring the use of punch card ballots in addition to 
31:760:70074:11:12:72:532:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:regular text ballots). Thus, the low level of misvotes associated with the Datavote machine suggests that the act of 
31:761:70191:12:11:72:532:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:“punching” out pre-scored holes may not be the cause of misvoting. Instead, higher levels of misvoting associated 
31:762:70305:11:0:72:426:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:with punch card technology by may be driven by the use of separate punch card ballots. 
32:763:70394:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of 1880, 1884, 1960, and 2000 were all less than one-quarter of a percent.20 Recently, the 2004 
32:764:70490:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Washington gubernatorial, 2000 Washington senatorial, 1998 Nevada senatorial, and 2002 South 
32:765:70583:28:27:72:544:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Dakota  senatorial  elections  were  determined  by  voteshare  margins  of  less  than  one-tenth  of  a  
32:766:70690:27:28:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:percent.  Major candidates that attract voters that are more likely to cast misvotes would suffer 
32:767:70788:28:28:71:278:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:key disadvantages in these close elections. 
32:768:70832:28:27:107:544:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:  However,  one  may  wonder  if  results  from  California’s  gubernatorial  recall  election  can  
32:769:70933:27:28:71:546:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:be  applied  to  other  major  elections.  The  Recall  Election  was  unique  in  that  it  featured  an  
32:770:71040:28:27:71:543:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:unusually large number of candidates, 135 in total, competing in a single race. The advantage is 
32:771:71137:27:28:71:543:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that the large number of candidates combined with variation in ballot layout and candidate order 
32:772:71234:28:28:71:543:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:provides the best available identification of adjacency misvoting. The disadvantage is that most 
32:773:71331:28:27:72:545:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:major  elections  feature  far  fewer  candidates  competing  in  a  single  race.  For  example,  while  a  
32:774:71440:27:28:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:total of 72 candidates ran for President in at least one state during the 2004 Election, the majority 
32:775:71542:28:27:72:542:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of states listed fewer than ten candidates. Even primary elections, known for their large candidate 
32:776:71642:27:28:72:544:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:pools,  typically  feature  fewer  than  thirty  candidates  per  race.21  This  does  not  imply,  however,  
32:777:71752:28:27:72:545:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that  the  California  Recall  Election  ballots  were  unusually  confusing.  Ballots  used  in  major  
32:778:71857:27:28:72:545:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:elections  contain  numerous  races  (e.g.,  President,  Senate,  House,  assembly  district,  county,  
32:779:71961:28:28:72:543:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:municipality, etc.) and propositions, and thus do not significantly differ in length or complexity 
32:780:72060:28:27:72:544:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:from  Recall  Election  ballots.  However,  adjacency  misvoting  may  depend  on  the  length  of  the  
32:781:72165:27:28:72:542:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidate list for a single race. Therefore, future research may wish to explore whether misvoting 
32:782:72264:28:52:72:400:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:occurs at comparable levels in elections featuring fewer candidates. 
32:783:72333:52:8:216:219:132:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:                                                 
32:784:72381:8:16:72:516:124:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:20 Outcomes of presidential elections are officially determined by the Electoral College. For a majority of U.S. 
32:785:72494:16:11:72:540:108:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:states, the popular vote by state determines how state electoral votes are distributed in the Electoral College. In each 
32:786:72615:11:12:72:527:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:of the presidential elections listed above, the margin of victory was less than a quarter of a percent in the popular 
32:787:72733:12:7:72:451:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:vote of at least one state with enough electoral votes to determine the outcome of the election. 
32:788:72830:7:0:72:420:78:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:21 Data for presidential elections and primaries are drawn from state election websites. 
33:789:72921:0:27:108:538:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Future nationwide studies of adjacency misvoting may be particularly beneficial because 
33:790:73009:27:28:72:533:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adjacency misvoting could have a large impact on major elections outside of California. Unlike 
33:791:73104:28:27:72:502:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:California, many states in the U.S. do not rotate candidate name order on ballots. Rather, 
33:792:73195:27:28:72:516:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:incumbents are listed first, followed by a long list of minor candidates. This implies that the 
33:793:73291:28:28:72:518:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidate adjacent to a major candidate could be another major candidate. If this is the case, 
33:794:73386:28:27:72:523:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:votes lost by one major candidate are systematically accrued by another major candidate. For 
33:795:73479:27:28:72:506:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:example, suppose that, relative to the Republican frontrunner, the Democratic frontrunner 
33:796:73569:28:27:72:542:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:attracts voters that are more likely to cast misvotes. Further suppose that the two frontrunners are 
33:797:73670:27:28:72:534:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adjacent to each other on the ballot. Then the Democratic frontrunner would not only lose more 
33:798:73765:28:28:72:542:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:votes to adjacent candidates. Her loss would actually go to her opponent, thereby magnifying her 
33:799:73862:28:27:72:185:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:electoral disadvantage.

33:802:73899:27:28:108:543:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:This paper tests the hypothesis that minor candidates experience gains in voteshare when 
33:803:73988:28:27:72:543:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:their names are listed near the name of a major candidate on a ballot. We refer to votes for minor 
33:804:74087:27:28:72:545:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:candidates  resulting  from  adjacency  misvoting  as  “misvotes”  because  ballot  layout  should  not  
33:805:74192:28:28:72:466:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:impact the voting choices of fully rational voters with negligible cognition costs.  
33:806:74277:28:27:108:546:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:  We  test  adjacency  misvoting  using  a  unique  dataset  combining  precinct-level  voting  
33:807:74373:27:28:72:543:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:results from the 2003 California Recall Election with precinct-level Census and voter registration 
33:808:74472:28:27:72:543:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:data. Because ballot layout and candidate order are determined at the county-district level, there 
33:809:74571:27:28:72:543:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:exists random variation in when a minor candidate is adjacent to a major candidate. The gain in 
33:810:74667:28:28:72:545:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the  total  voteshares  experienced  by  minor  candidates  that  are  adjacent  is  an  estimate  of  the  
33:811:74775:28:0:72:544:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:number of misvotes. We find that the voteshares of minor candidates almost double when their 
34:812:74870:0:27:72:544:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:names  are  adjacent  to  the  names  of  major  candidates  and  that  misvotes  accounted  for  at  least  
34:813:74979:27:28:72:546:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:0.25%  percent  of  all  votes  cast  during  the  Recall  Election.  Misvotes  are  most  prevalent  in  
34:814:75085:28:27:71:545:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:precincts  with  high  percentages  of  Democratic,  Hispanic,  low-income,  non-English  speaking,  
34:815:75186:27:28:71:542:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:poorly educated, or young voters, suggesting that these groups may face higher cognitive costs of 
34:816:75284:28:28:71:543:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:voting. We also find that, relative to the punch card technology platform, the use of the optical 
34:817:75382:28:27:71:542:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:scan or touch screen technology platforms generally corresponds to a reduction in the number of 
34:818:75478:27:28:71:546:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:misvotes.  However,  even  within  technology  platforms,  there  are  some  notable  performance  
34:819:75577:28:27:71:276:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:differences across voting machine brands. 
34:820:75619:27:28:107:546:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:  Adjacency  misvoting  has  important  electoral  implications  because  votes  gained  by  
34:821:75712:28:28:71:544:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adjacent  candidates  are  votes  lost  by  major  candidates.  A  major  candidate  that  attracts  voters  
34:822:75821:28:27:71:542:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:from precincts that cast high levels of misvotes suffers systematic electoral disadvantages. In the 
34:823:75921:27:28:71:543:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:case of the California Recall Election, precincts that were most affected by adjacency misvoting 
34:824:76018:28:27:71:543:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:also showed the strongest support for Democratic candidate Cruz Bustamante. This may explain 
34:825:76111:27:28:71:542:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:why, relative to Republican candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bustamante lost 63 percent more 
34:826:76204:28:27:71:544:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of  the  votes  intended  for  him  to  his  adjacent  candidates.  Although  this  difference  in  lost  votes  
34:827:76317:27:28:71:545:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:represents  a  small  fraction  of  the  total  voteshare,  the  loss  exceeds  the  margins  of  victory  in  
34:828:76428:28:28:71:547:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:several  recent  elections,  including  the  presidential  election  of  2000  and  the  Washington  
34:829:76529:28:27:71:546:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:gubernatorial  election  of  2004.  Thus,  adjacency  misvoting  is  powerful  enough  to  determine  
34:830:76631:27:0:71:342:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:outcomes in important highly-contested close elections.

42:1031:86476:27:28:71:539:295:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:given precinct, Schwarzenegger either has no north adjacent candidates (if Schwarzenegger is at

42:1034:86768:27:28:71:540:212:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f5:F as correcting for the fact that adjacent candidates exist with unequal frequency. For example, 
42:1035:86865:28:27:71:540:184:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:north  and  south  adjacent  candidates  always  exist  unless  the  major  candidate  is  at  the  top  or 
42:1036:86973:27:28:71:540:157:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:bottom  of  a  column  respectively.  However,  east  and west  adjacent  candidates  only  exist  on 
42:1037:87075:28:0:71:413:129:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:multi-column ballots. See Appendix 2 for detailed frequency statistics.
