2:28:752:16:16:71:526:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:cross-country analysis using data from 142 countries over the period 1970‒2007 documents an 
2:29:844:16:16:71:526:325:144:Times:144:Times:B:inverted U-shaped link between terrain ruggedness and sectoral diversification, which mainly 
2:30:937:16:16:71:528:309:144:Times:144:Times:B:works  through  the  extensive  margin  of  diversification.  A  within-country  analysis  based  on  
2:31:1039:16:16:71:526:293:144:Times:144:Times:B:United States (US)  state-level  data  over the period 1997‒2011 confirms  this  non-monotonic

2:33:1229:15:16:71:526:262:144:Times:144:Times:B:which  terrain  ruggedness  affects  sectoral  diversification is the spat ial  concentration  of 
2:34:1327:16:26:71:471:246:144:Times:144:Times:B:economic activity, as measured by the concentration of satellite-based night lights.

3:38:1552:0:27:72:149:758:144:Times:144:Times:B:1 Introduction 
3:39:1566:27:28:72:525:731:144:Times:144:Times:B:Imbs  and  Wacziarg’s  (2003) deservedly  influential  study  demonstrates  economies  with  low 
3:40:1663:28:27:72:526:703:144:Times:144:Times:B:income levels experience rising levels of sectoral diversification; after reaching a certain level 
3:41:1762:27:28:72:526:676:144:Times:144:Times:B:of  development,  they tend  to  concentrate  (see  also  Koren  and  Tenreyro (2007)).  While  this 
3:42:1863:28:28:72:525:648:144:Times:144:Times:B:curious finding has major implications for key stages of sectoral diversification, most countries 
3:43:1961:28:27:72:526:620:144:Times:144:Times:B:face exogenous  hurdles in  their  sectoral  development  trajectories—chiefly,  non-economic 
3:44:2055:27:28:71:526:593:144:Times:144:Times:B:barriers.  This  study  examines  the manner  in  which  terrain  ruggedness,  a  time-invariant 
3:45:2151:28:27:71:525:565:144:Times:144:Times:B:topographic factor that constitutes a significant obstacle to economic activity, affects the course 
3:46:2251:27:28:71:203:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:of sectoral diversification.  
3:47:2281:28:28:107:525:510:144:Times:144:Times:A:That rugged topography would be a major inhibiting factor for sectoral development is 
3:48:2367:28:27:71:526:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:hardly a novel proposition. However, the ways in which this effect arises remain opaque, and 
3:49:2460:27:28:72:525:455:144:Times:144:Times:B:require detailed examination given the widely held arguments and policy prescriptions around 
3:50:2553:28:27:72:526:427:144:Times:144:Times:B:the world that emphasize the critical role of spreading risks across sectors by diversifying real 
3:51:2651:27:28:72:528:400:144:Times:144:Times:B:economies.  How  could  economies  facing  significant  natural  barriers  adopt  such  prescribed  
3:52:2751:28:28:72:523:372:144:Times:144:Times:B:policies?  We  investigate the topography‒sectoral  diversification  relationship  in both  cross-
3:53:2849:28:27:72:526:344:144:Times:144:Times:B:country  and  single-country settings.  The  main  focus  of our  cross-country  analysis,  which is 
3:54:2950:27:28:72:525:317:144:Times:144:Times:B:based on an annual panel of 142 countries over the  period 1970–2007, is    to unpack whether 
3:55:3044:28:27:72:527:289:144:Times:144:Times:B:topography  affects  sectoral  diversification  through  the  intensive  or extensive  margins  of  the  
3:56:3149:27:28:71:526:262:144:Times:144:Times:B:latter. That is, does topography affect diversification by influencing the sizes of existing sectors 
3:57:3249:28:28:71:526:234:144:Times:144:Times:B:(i.e., intensive  margin  of  sectoral  diversification),  or  by affecting the  introduction  of  newer 
3:58:3353:28:27:71:525:206:144:Times:144:Times:B:sectors and  phasing  out  the  older  sectors  (i.e., extensive  margin  of  sectoral  diversification)? 
3:59:3459:27:28:71:525:179:144:Times:144:Times:B:Despite painting a useful glo bal picture, the cross-country analysis nonetheless has limitat ions 
3:60:3558:28:27:71:525:151:144:Times:144:Times:B:in    terms of explaining the mechanism through which terrain ruggedness might impede or boost 
3:61:3653:27:28:71:525:124:144:Times:144:Times:B:sectoral diversification. The key concern here is that a heterogeneous cross-country setting may 
3:62:3750:28:0:71:526:96:144:Times:144:Times:B:not enable a comparable platform to tease out the mechanism of effect reliably. To address that 
4:63:3847:0:27:72:526:758:144:Times:144:Times:B:gap, we  extend  our  analysis  to  a within-country  context  using United States (US) state-level 
4:64:3946:27:28:71:526:731:144:Times:144:Times:B:data for the period 1997‒2011. The mechanism we conjecture is that rugged topography affects 
4:65:4039:28:27:71:526:703:144:Times:144:Times:B:the spatial distribution  of  economic  activity,  which  in  turn may affect  the  levels  of  sectoral 
4:66:4144:27:28:71:525:676:144:Times:144:Times:B:diversification. In particular, rugged topography may restrict geographic clusters from spatially 
4:67:4242:28:28:71:527:648:144:Times:144:Times:B:(i.e.,  the  extensive  margin  of  spatial  concentration),  given  that  population  growth  requires  
4:68:4347:28:27:71:526:620:144:Times:144:Times:B:residential and entrepreneurial areas to extend over space. Terrain ruggedness may also force 
4:69:4441:27:28:71:526:593:144:Times:144:Times:B:economies to operate within certain spatial clusters characterized by relatively uneven nodal 
4:70:4535:28:27:71:526:565:144:Times:144:Times:B:shares (i.e., intensive margin of spatial concentration). While counter-arguments in both veins 
4:71:4631:27:28:71:526:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:are   possible,   spatial   concentration   induced   by   topographic   barriers,   according   to   our 
4:72:4737:28:28:71:527:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:hypothesis,  is  likely  to  lead  to  sectoral  concentration  caused  by  the  uneven  relative  sizes  of  
4:73:4847:28:27:71:522:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:existing sectors,  or the prevention  of  new  and/or  phasing  out  of  older  sectors.  Our  within-
4:74:4949:27:28:71:526:455:144:Times:144:Times:B:country  analysis  has  its  own  limitation  of  not  enabling  measurement  of  the  intensive  and 
4:75:5050:28:27:71:525:427:144:Times:144:Times:B:extensive margins of sectoral diversification, because no manufacturing sector is introduced or 
4:76:5146:27:28:71:526:400:144:Times:144:Times:B:phased out in the US in our sample period. Consequently, the cross-country and within-country 
4:77:5240:28:28:71:494:372:144:Times:144:Times:B:analyses in this paper are complementary, with one addressing the other’s shortcoming. 
4:78:5326:28:27:107:526:344:144:Times:144:Times:A:To investigate the effect of terrain ruggedness on sectoral diversification, an accurate 
4:79:5415:27:28:71:528:317:144:Times:144:Times:B:quantification  of  topographic  disturbances  is  vital.  Crude  indicators  reflecting  larger  scale  
4:80:5520:28:27:71:525:289:144:Times:144:Times:B:irregularities, such as the percentage of mountains in a country’s surface area, are far from able 
4:81:5619:27:28:71:525:262:144:Times:144:Times:B:to  capture the proximate conditions that affect the sectoral distribution  of  economic activity. 
4:82:5718:28:28:71:525:234:144:Times:144:Times:B:Thus, we adopt the  terrain-ruggedness  index  developed by Nunn and Puga (2012), a precise 
4:83:5810:28:27:71:451:206:144:Times:144:Times:B:metric that quantifies topographic irregularities in 30 arcseconds (926 meters). 
4:84:5891:27:28:107:525:179:144:Times:144:Times:A:To  measure  sectoral  diversification,  we  explo it   the  Theil  index,  particularly  its 
4:85:5985:28:27:71:527:151:144:Times:144:Times:B:decomposability  property  (Cadot  et  al.  2011).  The  Theil  index  is  an  additive  measure  that  
4:86:6089:27:28:71:526:124:144:Times:144:Times:B:usefully decomposes the extensive and intensive margins of the inequalities of sectors’ sizes. 
4:87:6184:28:0:71:532:96:144:Times:144:Times:B:Consequently, in a novel step, we decompose the sectoral diversification into its   extensive and 
5:88:6284:0:27:72:526:758:144:Times:144:Times:B:intensive  margins  (i.e.,  between-  and  within-components,  respectively).  For  cross-country 
5:89:6382:27:28:71:526:731:144:Times:144:Times:B:analysis,  we use two-digit  manufacturing data for 23 sectors of 142 countries obtained  from 
5:90:6476:28:27:71:526:703:144:Times:144:Times:B:the INDSTAT2   (2012) International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) Rev.3 database, 
5:91:6570:27:28:71:526:676:144:Times:144:Times:B:whose emplo yment and value-added data we use to compute the sectoral labor and value-added 
5:92:6662:28:28:71:528:648:144:Times:144:Times:B:shares,  respectively.  Analogously,  the  Theil  index  of  US  states’ sectoral  diversification  is  
5:93:6766:28:27:71:525:620:144:Times:144:Times:B:computed  using two-digit data on  value-added  shares  of 18 manufacturing  sectors  classified 
5:94:6863:27:28:71:526:593:144:Times:144:Times:B:according to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for 50 US states for 
5:95:6955:28:27:71:186:565:144:Times:144:Times:B:the period 1997‒2011.  
5:96:6977:27:28:107:526:538:144:Times:144:Times:A:To measure the spatial concentration of economic activity for the US states, we again 
5:97:7063:28:28:71:526:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:take  advantage  of  the  Theil  index,  but apply it  to 30 arcsecond-gridded satellite night lights 
5:98:7165:28:27:71:527:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:data (see  Henderson,  Storeygard  and  Weil  (2012)). In  contrast  to  most  of  the  earlier  studies  
5:99:7271:27:28:71:526:455:144:Times:144:Times:B:that have used   the night  lights data only as a proxy for income, our approach adopts a more 
5:100:7366:28:27:71:527:427:144:Times:144:Times:B:literal interpretation of the data and uses them as  an  indicator  of  the spat ial concentration  of  
5:101:7470:27:28:71:526:400:144:Times:144:Times:B:economic  activity.  Further,  we  compute  the  spatial  extensive  and  intensive  margins  of  the 
5:102:7571:28:28:71:525:372:144:Times:144:Times:B:distribution of night lights. To the best of our knowledge, no other study has hitherto considered 
5:103:7670:28:27:71:434:344:144:Times:144:Times:B:the spatial extensive and intensive margins of the satellite night lights data. 
5:104:7749:27:28:107:526:317:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our cross-country result s show that terrain ruggedness is    significantly associated with 
5:105:7840:28:27:71:526:289:144:Times:144:Times:B:sectoral diversification in a country, that this effect works through the sectoral diversification’s 
5:106:7940:27:28:71:526:262:144:Times:144:Times:B:extensive margin, and that the effect is inverse U-shaped. The effect’s non-monotonicit y may 
5:107:8034:28:28:71:525:234:144:Times:144:Times:B:arise  given  the  threshold  effects,  owing  to  the  skewed  distribution  of  surface  irregularit ies 
5:108:8141:28:27:71:528:206:144:Times:144:Times:B:across  countries,  and  suggests  that  ruggedness  is  associated  with  higher  (lower)  levels  of  
5:109:8245:27:28:71:528:179:144:Times:144:Times:B:sectoral  diversification  (concentration)  up  to  a  certain  level  of  ruggedness,  after  which  it  is  
5:110:8355:28:27:71:526:151:144:Times:144:Times:B:associated  with  lower  (higher)  sectoral  diversification.  The  within-country evidence also 
5:111:8451:27:28:71:525:124:144:Times:144:Times:B:supports  the  inverted  U-shaped  effect  of terrain ruggedness  on  sectoral  diversification.  In 
5:112:8552:28:0:71:525:96:144:Times:144:Times:B:addit ion, it shows that rugged terrain increases spatial concentration, and this in turn reduces 
6:113:8652:0:27:72:528:758:144:Times:144:Times:B:sectoral diversification.  Further, there  is  some  evidence  that  an  extensive  margin  of  spatial  
6:114:8757:27:28:72:526:731:144:Times:144:Times:B:concentration  (i.e.,  inability  to  extend  the  night  lights  into  previously  dark  areas)  drives  this 
6:115:8868:28:27:71:526:703:144:Times:144:Times:B:spatial  mechanism.  The  intuition  behind  this  finding  is  that  if  geographic  clusters  in  a  state 
6:116:8977:27:28:71:525:676:144:Times:144:Times:B:cannot spatially extend, then they are likely to operate with a handful of sectors. The corollary 
6:117:9075:28:28:71:526:648:144:Times:144:Times:B:is that if geographic decentralization occurs within a state (i.e., new night lights are introduced), 
6:118:9177:28:27:71:526:620:144:Times:144:Times:B:then it is likely that new sectors have also been introduced. Although alternative mechanisms 
6:119:9271:27:28:71:526:593:144:Times:144:Times:B:may not be ruled out, our ordinary least-squares (OLS) results are robust to Hausman–Taylor 
6:120:9363:28:27:71:525:565:144:Times:144:Times:B:(HT) and instrumental variable (IV) estimations, which address the endogeneity in key control 
6:121:9457:27:28:72:297:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:variables, such as income and trade openness.  
6:122:9504:28:28:108:526:510:144:Times:144:Times:A:This  study  thus makes two novel  contributions  to  the  literature  by  addressing 
6:123:9590:28:27:71:525:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:topography’s important role in sectoral diversification. First, in our cross-country analysis, we 
6:124:9688:27:28:71:525:455:144:Times:144:Times:B:investigate not only the effect of terrain ruggedness on overall sectoral diversification, but also 
6:125:9788:28:27:71:526:427:144:Times:144:Times:B:on the latter’s extensive and intensive margins. Second, to investigate the mechanism of effect, 
6:126:9885:27:28:71:529:400:144:Times:144:Times:B:we  exploit  the  satellite  night  lights  data  in  a  single-country  analysis  to  measure  spatial  
6:127:9990:28:28:71:528:372:144:Times:144:Times:B:concentration,  which  is  predicated  on  a  literal  interpretation  of  what  the  night  lights  data  
6:128:10097:28:27:71:526:344:144:Times:144:Times:B:actually display. Moreover, we exploit the intensive and extensive margins of the night lights 
6:129:10192:27:28:71:525:317:144:Times:144:Times:B:data to delve deeper into the geographic concentration mechanism. Overall, our study stands 
6:130:10284:28:27:71:528:289:144:Times:144:Times:B:at  the  crossroad  of  two  strands  of  literature:  one  examining  the  determinants  of  sectoral  
6:131:10388:27:28:71:471:262:144:Times:144:Times:B:diversification, and the other focusing on geography’s effect on the real economy.  
6:132:10471:28:28:107:526:234:144:Times:144:Times:A:The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 provides a brief overview 
6:133:10559:28:27:71:526:206:144:Times:144:Times:B:of topography and diversification relationship, section 3   explains the data used, and section 4 
6:134:10657:27:28:71:526:179:144:Times:144:Times:B:describes the estimation framework. Section 5 presents the results and section 6 concludes the 
6:135:10752:28:27:71:103:151:144:Times:144:Times:B:study.

7:138:10853:27:28:72:129:731:144:Times:144:Times:B:Discussion 
7:139:10863:28:27:72:527:703:144:Times:144:Times:B:In  this  sub-section,  first  we  provide  theoretical  arguments  as  to  how  sectoral  diversification  
7:140:10971:27:28:72:528:676:144:Times:144:Times:B:and  ruggedness  may  be  related.  Then,  we  explain  how  spatial  concentration  can  work  as  a  
7:141:11074:28:27:72:224:648:144:Times:122:g_d0_f6:B:mechanism in this relationship.

7:144:11194:28:27:72:273:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:Margins of Sectoral Economic Activity 
7:145:11231:27:28:72:527:540:144:Times:144:Times:B:Diversification has been at the center of a long-standing debate in  economics. While several 
7:146:11325:28:27:71:527:512:144:Times:144:Times:B:theories, such as the Ricardian and Heckscher-Ohlin theories of international trade, promote 
7:147:11418:27:28:71:526:485:144:Times:144:Times:B:specialization, a number of others emphasize the importance of diversification. For example, 
7:148:11511:28:28:72:529:457:144:Times:144:Times:B:diversification  plays  a  critical  role  in  spreading  risks  across  sectors  in  economies  facing  
7:149:11616:28:27:72:526:429:144:Times:144:Times:B:external shocks and severe vulnerability (Imbs and Wacziarg 2003). Similarly, the International 
7:150:11712:27:28:71:527:402:144:Times:144:Times:B:Monetary Fund (2014) observes that sectoral diversification has a “growth payo ff” as well as 
7:151:11806:28:27:71:526:374:144:Times:144:Times:B:a “stability payo ff.” Therefore, it is no wonder that international institutions such as the World 
7:152:11906:27:28:71:526:347:144:Times:144:Times:B:Bank  run  field  programs  in  developing  countries  to  assist  them  with  their  diversification 
7:153:12008:28:28:71:129:319:144:Times:144:Times:B:objectives.  
7:154:12020:28:27:107:526:291:144:Times:144:Times:A:The effect of physical geography on economic variables is widely acknowledged in the 
7:155:12104:27:28:71:528:264:144:Times:144:Times:B:economic  geography  literature  (see  Malik  and  Temple  (2009);  Gallup,  Sachs  &  Mellinger  
7:156:12202:28:27:71:526:236:144:Times:144:Times:B:(1999)).   The role of terrain ruggedness is well documented, not only in the spat ial concentration 
7:157:12303:27:28:71:525:209:144:Times:144:Times:B:of economic activity (Ramcharan 2009), but also in such diverse factors as exports (Radelet 
7:158:12395:28:28:71:526:181:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Sachs, 1999), economic development (Mellinger, Sachs, and Gallup (2000)) civil conflict 
7:159:12487:28:27:71:523:153:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Shaver, Carter and Shawa (2015)), social trust (Khalifa, (2016)), and state capacity (Jimenez-
7:160:12582:27:0:71:526:126:144:Times:144:Times:B:Ayora and Ulubasoglu (2015)). Nunn and Puga (2012) show that ruggedness was a ‘blessing’ 
8:161:12673:0:27:72:527:758:144:Times:144:Times:B:for African countries in that it protected slave trade, and thus had an indirect bearing on the 
8:162:12769:27:28:72:317:731:144:Times:144:Times:B:economic development of some African countries. 
8:163:12816:28:27:108:526:703:144:Times:144:Times:A:A  priori, the  manner  in  which  physio-geography  influences  sectoral diversification is 
8:164:12909:27:28:72:525:676:144:Times:144:Times:B:ambiguous.  For example,  settlements  lying  in  different  altitudes  within  a  short  distance  are 
8:165:13013:28:28:71:526:648:144:Times:144:Times:B:likely to face non-negligible costs of production. In  addit ion, rugged terrain imposes serious 
8:166:13110:28:27:72:526:620:144:Times:144:Times:B:constraints  on  delivering  infrastructure  and  basic  public  services  to  different  communities.1 
8:167:13213:27:28:72:526:593:144:Times:144:Times:B:Transaction costs due to rugged terrain may thus impede private sector development and limit 
8:168:13305:28:27:72:526:565:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  economy  from  venturing  into  different  sectors,  inducing  sectoral  concentration.  By 
8:169:13402:27:28:71:526:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:contrast, some levels of ruggedness may provide advantages over a smoother terrain (e.g., by 
8:170:13495:28:28:71:526:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:leading to higher productivity in certain industrial crops), or spatial segregation may motivate 
8:171:13592:28:27:71:525:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:cooperation up to some level of topographic difficulty (e.g., building roads, railways, and other 
8:172:13690:27:28:71:457:455:144:Times:144:Times:B:infrastructure for common use),   which may thus lead to sectoral diversification. 
8:173:13772:28:27:107:529:427:144:Times:144:Times:A:It  is  important  to  note  that  negative  consequences  of  rugged  topography  can  be  
8:174:13864:27:28:71:527:400:144:Times:144:Times:B:alleviated,  if  not  reversed,  through  engineering.  One  example  of a  highly  successful  rugged  
8:175:13968:28:28:71:526:372:144:Times:144:Times:B:country that won over its topography is    Switzerland. Though not all rugged-terrain countries 
8:176:14064:28:27:71:528:344:144:Times:144:Times:B:are  as  successful  as  Switzerland,  it  is  reasonable  to  expect  that  an  average  country  would  
8:177:14170:27:28:71:526:317:144:Times:144:Times:B:attempt to overcome certain forms of ruggedness. Nonetheless, an overly rugged terrain would 
8:178:14263:28:27:71:528:289:144:Times:144:Times:B:discourage  investments  into  such  infrastructure  because  of  their  non-negligible  costs  and  
8:179:14364:27:28:71:526:262:144:Times:144:Times:B:uncertain  returns—Nepal  is  a  good  example.  These  arguments  suggest  that  ruggedness  may  
8:180:14463:28:28:71:526:234:144:Times:144:Times:B:initially  assist  sectoral  diversification  such  that  its  adverse  consequences  may  be  observed 
8:181:14566:28:27:71:526:206:144:Times:144:Times:B:beyond  a  certain  point,  but  then  sectoral  concentration  may  win  over.  This  would  mean  an 
8:182:14669:27:82:71:461:179:144:Times:144:Times:B:inverted U-shaped relationship between ruggedness and sectoral diversification.  
8:183:14750:82:8:72:218:97:122:g_d0_f6:122:g_d0_f6:F:                                                             
8:184:14811:8:15:72:525:89:42:Times:102:Times:F:1 Ulubasoglu and Cardak (2007) find that landlocked countries, generally mountainous, exhibit higher inequality 
8:185:14923:15:0:72:507:74:102:Times:102:Times:F:in rural and urban schooling because of the difficulties associated with public service delivery to rural areas. 
9:186:15037:0:27:108:525:758:144:Times:144:Times:A:Whether and how the intensive and extensive margins of sectoral diversification may 
9:187:15121:27:28:71:525:731:144:Times:144:Times:B:be  affected by  terrain  irregularities  constitutes  an  open,  ambiguous,  and  critical empirical 
9:188:15223:28:27:71:526:703:144:Times:144:Times:B:question. In terms of the extensive margin, rugged topography may prevent new sectors from 
9:189:15314:27:28:71:526:676:144:Times:144:Times:B:being  introduced or older ones from being phased out, and may thus result  in  a concentrated 
9:190:15409:28:28:71:525:648:144:Times:144:Times:B:sectoral structure. A counter-argument is that terrain ruggedness may lead to pockets of clusters 
9:191:15507:28:27:71:526:620:144:Times:144:Times:B:that host different sectors, which may underlie diversified sectoral production. Turning to the 
9:192:15603:27:28:71:525:593:144:Times:144:Times:B:intensive  margin,  how  sectoral  shares  in  a  given  topographic  cluster  would be  shaped  is 
9:193:15703:28:27:71:526:565:144:Times:144:Times:B:ambiguous, but, taking a cue from the extensive margin discussion, it is likely that constrained 
9:194:15800:27:28:71:526:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:intersectoral linkages caused by having to operate in a narrow space may give rise to unequal 
9:195:15894:28:28:71:414:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:size distribution for existing sectors, leading to sectoral concentration.  
9:196:15970:28:27:71:293:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:2.2. Spatial Concentration as a Mechanism 
9:197:16011:27:28:71:525:455:144:Times:144:Times:B:Crit ically, the above discussion suggests that spatial (i.e., geographic) concentration within an 
9:198:16110:28:27:71:526:427:144:Times:144:Times:B:observational unit (i.e., state or country) is central to  understanding the relationship between 
9:199:16208:27:28:71:526:400:144:Times:144:Times:B:terrain ruggedness and sectoral diversification. To this end, Ramcharan (2009, 2010) provides 
9:200:16302:28:28:71:526:372:144:Times:144:Times:B:very useful insights. Ramcharan (2010) reviews the road construction literature, and documents 
9:201:16397:28:27:71:527:344:144:Times:144:Times:B:that the terrain grade variat ion—that is, the  rise  and  fall  of  the  surface  area—as  well  as  soil  
9:202:16505:27:28:71:526:317:144:Times:144:Times:B:characteristics can exponentially affect the cost of building roadways and rail lines. This may 
9:203:16601:28:27:71:526:289:144:Times:144:Times:B:result  in  spatial  concentration  and  reduced  sectoral  diversification opportunities,  given the 
9:204:16702:27:28:71:528:262:144:Times:144:Times:B:increased  cost  of  transporting  goods  across  space.  Conversely,  ruggedness-induced  spatial  
9:205:16802:28:28:71:526:234:144:Times:144:Times:B:concentration   may   increase   sectoral   diversification   through   an   agglomeration   effect. 
9:206:16902:28:27:71:526:206:144:Times:144:Times:B:Ruggedness may be responsible for concentrated economic activities in a narrow area, and thus 
9:207:16996:27:28:71:526:179:144:Times:144:Times:B:create opportunities for a larger home market, boosting returns to scale and leading to higher 
9:208:17091:28:27:71:525:151:144:Times:144:Times:B:productivity levels. The expanded domestic demand generated may facilitate scope for sectoral 
9:209:17185:27:0:71:248:124:144:Times:144:Times:B:diversification (Ramcharan (2009)). 
10:210:17223:0:27:108:528:758:144:Times:144:Times:A:As  indicated  above,  we  investigate  the  spatial  concentration  mechanism  as  measured  
10:211:17317:27:28:72:528:731:144:Times:144:Times:B:by  US night  lights  data. To  link the  spatial distribution  of  economic  activity  with  sectoral  
10:212:17421:28:27:71:528:703:144:Times:144:Times:B:diversification,  we  assume  the  following:  if  sectoral  diversification  in  a  state  takes  place  
10:213:17527:27:28:72:526:676:144:Times:144:Times:B:alongside  spatial  diversification,  then  it  is  likely  that  diversification  of  economic  activity  in 
10:214:17637:28:28:72:526:648:144:Times:144:Times:B:space has contributed   to the diversification of economic activity in sectors (or vice versa). This 
10:215:17738:28:27:71:527:620:144:Times:144:Times:B:effect can arise  through  both  the  spatial extensive or spatial  intensive  margins  of  economic  
10:216:17839:27:28:71:528:593:144:Times:144:Times:B:activity.  Considering  the  spatial  extensive  margin,  if  new  areas  are  lit  up,  then  either  new  
10:217:17947:28:27:71:527:565:144:Times:144:Times:B:sectors  are  introduced/older  sectors  are  phased  out, or the  relative  shares  of  existing  sectors  
10:218:18055:27:28:71:526:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:have changed   in a manner resulting in sectoral diversification. Of  these possibilit ies,  we  rule  
10:219:18158:28:28:71:525:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:out the introduction of new or phasing out of o lder sectors in the US, because we do not observe 
10:220:18256:28:27:71:525:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:such  development  in  the  US  manufacturing  data  for  1997‒2011.  We  thus  assume  the  only 
10:221:18354:27:28:72:526:455:144:Times:144:Times:B:remaining  possibility:  that  the  introduction  of  night  lights  into  previously  dark  areas  has 
10:222:18458:28:27:72:532:427:144:Times:144:Times:B:changed the relative shares of existing sectors in a manner that has led   to more even sectoral 
10:223:18555:27:28:72:530:400:144:Times:144:Times:B:shares.  Considering the spatial  intensive  margin,  we  assume  that  if  the  relative  strengths  of  
10:224:18661:28:28:71:526:372:144:Times:144:Times:B:existing night  lights  across  different  nodes  have changed    in  a  way  that  has reduced spatial 
10:225:18765:28:27:72:525:344:144:Times:144:Times:B:concentration,  then  it  is  likely  that  the  relative  shares  of  existing  sectors  have become more 
10:226:18872:27:28:72:526:317:144:Times:144:Times:B:even,  such  that  some sectoral diversification has occurred.  Taken  together,  both of  our 
10:227:18966:28:27:72:526:289:144:Times:144:Times:B:assumptions mean that changes in the extensive and intensive margins of spatial concentration 
10:228:19060:27:28:72:495:262:144:Times:144:Times:B:are likely to affect sectoral structure by changing the relative shares of existing sectors.  
10:229:19154:28:28:108:525:234:144:Times:144:Times:A:The downside of our approach is that we are unable to geocode the new sectors or those 
10:230:19241:28:27:72:531:206:144:Times:144:Times:B:existing   sectors   in   a   manner   that   fully   connects   sectoral   diversification   with   spatial   
10:231:19352:27:28:72:525:179:144:Times:144:Times:B:diversification, hence the above assumptions. Nonetheless, the effect of ruggedness on spatial 
10:232:19447:28:27:72:527:151:144:Times:144:Times:B:concentration,  and  in  turn the  effect  of  spatial  concentration  (through  both  spatial  extensive  
10:233:19554:27:28:72:526:124:144:Times:144:Times:B:and spat ial intensive  margins)  on  sectoral  diversification  based  on  these  assumptions,  are 
10:234:19655:28:0:71:299:96:144:Times:144:Times:B:exactly what we test in our empirical analysis.  
11:235:19707:0:27:72:241:758:144:Times:144:Times:B:3 Data and Descriptive Statistics 
11:236:19739:27:28:72:526:731:144:Times:144:Times:B:In this section, we discuss the construction of the main study variables. Appendix Tables A1 
11:237:19832:28:28:71:376:703:144:Times:144:Times:B:and A2 present a descript ion of all variables used in this study. 
11:238:19898:28:27:71:196:675:144:Times:144:Times:B:3.1 Terrain Ruggedness 
11:239:19919:27:28:71:529:648:144:Times:144:Times:B:Our  terrain-ruggedness  measure,  originally  constructed  by  Riley  et  al.  (1999)  and  later  
11:240:20019:28:27:71:529:620:144:Times:144:Times:B:improved  by  Nunn  and  Puga  (2012),  precisely quantifies  topographic  irregularities  in  a  
11:241:20117:27:28:71:526:593:144:Times:144:Times:B:country’s land area.2 A higher value of the terrain-ruggedness index implies a higher surface

11:243:20306:27:28:72:526:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the world. In our sample, Dominica has the lowest ruggedness, with a value of 0.003, while 
11:244:20400:28:28:72:513:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:Bhutan has the highest, with 6.74, and Barbados has the median ruggedness value of 0.963.

11:247:20677:28:27:72:525:427:144:Times:144:Times:B:Delaware has the least terrain irregularities, with a value of 0.06, while the state of Washington 
11:248:20776:27:28:72:505:400:144:Times:144:Times:B:has the most, with a value of 2.6, and Arkansas has the median ruggedness value of 0.51.  
11:249:20865:28:28:72:274:372:144:Times:144:Times:B:3.2 Measure of Sectoral Diversification 
11:250:20903:28:27:72:527:344:144:Times:144:Times:B:In  a  recent  innovative  contribution,  Cadot  et  al.  (2011,  pp.  594–596)  take  advantage  of  the  
11:251:21010:27:28:72:528:317:144:Times:144:Times:B:Theil  index’s  decomposability  and  compute  the  intensive  and  extensive  margins  of  export  
11:252:21110:28:27:71:526:289:144:Times:144:Times:B:diversification. In particular, they partition export diversification additively into within-group 
11:253:21209:27:28:72:525:262:144:Times:144:Times:B:and between-group (product) components, referring, respectively, to diversification occurring 
11:254:21303:28:28:72:526:234:144:Times:144:Times:B:within existing products, and diversification arising because of new products being introduced 
11:255:21398:28:38:72:251:206:144:Times:144:Times:B:or older products being phased out.3

11:257:21497:9:15:72:525:159:42:g_d0_f6:102:Times:F:2 Based on digital elevation data taken from GTOPO30, a global dataset led by the US Geological Survey Center, 
11:258:21607:15:12:72:527:144:102:Times:102:Times:F:the  terrain-ruggedness  index accurately  measures  the  topographic  characteristics  of  a  country’s  land  surface.  
11:259:21729:12:11:72:526:132:102:Times:102:Times:F:Elevation  observations  in  GTOPO30  are  gridded  at  30  arcseconds  (926  meters)  across  the  entire  surface  of  the  
11:260:21855:11:11:72:525:121:102:Times:102:Times:F:Earth (Nunn & Puga 2012). These grid cells are subsequently averaged to compute the average ruggedness of the 
11:261:21965:11:8:72:220:110:102:Times:102:g_d0_f6:F:counry’s lands that are free of water. 
11:262:22003:8:17:72:525:102:48:Times:102:Times:F:3 They find that most of the variation between export diversification and income per capita is because of intensive 
11:263:22118:17:11:71:526:85:102:Times:102:Times:F:trade margins  (i.e.,  existing  export  products),  but  the  non-monotonic relationship  between  the  two  is  driven  by  
11:264:22244:11:0:71:367:74:102:Times:102:Times:F:extensive margins (new products, or new markets for existing products).  
12:265:22319:0:27:108:526:758:144:Times:144:Times:A:Following  Cadot  et  al.  (2011),  we  decompose  the  Theil  index  of sectoral production 
12:266:22410:27:28:71:526:731:144:Times:144:Times:B:diversification  in  a  country  into  its  within-  and  between-components.  Sectoral production 
12:267:22509:28:27:71:525:703:144:Times:144:Times:B:diversification caused  by  changes  in  the  within-component occurs  because  of  sectoral 
12:268:22602:27:28:71:526:676:144:Times:144:Times:B:emplo yment or value-added shares within existing sectors becoming more even (which might 
12:269:22692:28:28:71:527:648:144:Times:144:Times:B:occur as  a  result  of  reallocation  and/or  movement  of  labor  and  capital  across  the  existing  
12:270:22797:28:27:71:526:620:144:Times:144:Times:B:sectors). Sectoral diversification caused by changes in the between-component occurs because 
12:271:22889:27:28:71:527:593:144:Times:144:Times:B:of  new  sectors  being  introduced or  older  sectors  being  phased  out  (which  might  occur  as  a  
12:272:22994:28:27:71:525:565:144:Times:144:Times:B:result of switching the exising labor and capital to new sectors). A higher value of the overall 
12:273:23091:27:28:71:526:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:Theil  index  for sectoral diversification indicates a lower level of sectoral diversification, or a 
12:274:23192:28:28:71:526:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher level of concentration. In this setting, a higher between-component (extensive margin) 
12:275:23286:28:27:71:526:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the Theil index means a higher concentration caused by the inability to introduce new sectors 
12:276:23382:27:28:71:526:455:144:Times:144:Times:B:or  phase  out  older  sectors,  while  a higher  within-component  (intensive  margin)  indicates  a 
12:277:23483:28:27:71:467:427:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher concentration caused by some sectors dominating the rest in terms of size.  
12:278:23566:27:28:107:525:400:144:Times:144:Times:A:To  calculate  the Theil  index  of  sectoral  diversification  at the  cross-country level,  we 
12:279:23663:28:28:71:526:372:144:Times:144:Times:B:use a panel dataset for the period 1970‒2007. This period is mainly dictated by the availabilit y 
12:280:23761:28:27:71:527:344:144:Times:144:Times:B:of  the  sectoral  size  data.  We  compute  the  index  using  the  INDSTAT2  (2012)  ISIC  Rev.3  
12:281:23861:27:28:71:530:317:144:Times:144:Times:B:database,  which  provides  manufacturing  data  for  23  sectors  at  the  two-digit   level   o f   
12:282:23963:28:27:71:526:289:144:Times:144:Times:B:disaggregation. Our sectoral size measures are employment and value-added shares. Figure A3

14:332:26917:28:27:72:528:703:144:Times:144:Times:B:margin)  of  the  index would  identify  the  changes  in  the  lights’ density  within  a  localized  
14:333:27020:27:28:72:526:676:144:Times:144:Times:B:geographic area, and the between-component (extensive margin) would capture the geographic 
14:334:27111:28:28:71:523:648:144:Times:144:Times:B:areas with lights, or with no lights before (see below). The night lights raw data come with six-

14:365:28343:27:28:72:528:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:concentrated  geographic  structure.  Along  these  lines,  a  higher  between-component  of  this  
14:366:28443:28:28:71:526:197:144:Times:144:Times:B:index means greater geographic concentration caused by the inability  to  extend  spatially  and  
14:367:28541:28:27:71:526:169:144:Times:144:Times:B:to light up new areas, while a higher within-component means a higher concentration caused 
14:368:28632:27:28:71:526:142:144:Times:144:Times:B:by some nodes dominating the geographic (i.e., night lights) distribution within a spatial unit

15:372:28979:0:27:108:525:758:144:Times:144:Times:A:Figure A5   illustrates the between-group (extensive margin) and within-group (intensive 
15:373:29068:27:28:72:526:731:144:Times:144:Times:B:margin) components of spatial concentration, displaying 30-by-30 arcsecond cells, where each 
15:374:29161:28:27:71:527:703:144:Times:144:Times:B:cell is centered  on  a  point  from  the  night  lights  grid. The  solid  black circles represent  the  
15:375:29266:27:28:72:529:676:144:Times:144:Times:B:existing night lights, and the grey circles represent new night lights introduced in  a previously 
15:376:29365:28:28:72:526:648:144:Times:144:Times:B:dark cell. The empty cells show the absence of night lights. The size of a circle portrays the 
15:377:29460:28:27:71:528:620:144:Times:144:Times:B:densit y  o f  night  lights  in  a  given  cell.  Compared with  the  baseline  case  in  5.1,  a  simple  
15:378:29568:27:28:71:526:593:144:Times:144:Times:B:exchange  of  the  circles  across  two  cells  in  5.2 leads  to  no  change  in  spatial  concentration. 
15:379:29675:28:27:71:526:565:144:Times:144:Times:B:However, with the previously smaller black circle becoming as large as the other black circle, 
15:380:29770:27:28:71:525:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:5.3 displays a reduction in spatial concentration caused by a change in the within-component. 
15:381:29864:28:28:72:526:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:Compared with 5.1, 5.4 displays another case of no change in concentration, where the larger 
15:382:29957:28:27:72:526:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:black circle disappears and simply shifts to another cell (with the grey color). Yet 5.5 represents 
15:383:30057:27:28:72:526:455:144:Times:144:Times:B:a decrease in spatial concentration caused by the introduction of a new (grey) night light in a 
15:384:30153:28:27:72:523:427:144:Times:144:Times:B:third  cell,  denoting  geographic  diversification  at  the  spatial  extensive  margin  (between-
15:385:30252:27:28:72:528:400:144:Times:144:Times:B:component);  5.6  represents  a  further  reduction  in  spatial  concentration,  with  the  previously  
15:386:30357:28:28:72:527:372:144:Times:144:Times:B:smaller black circle becoming larger, thus suggesting geographic diversification in the spatial 
15:387:30453:28:27:72:349:344:144:Times:144:Times:B:intensive margin (within-component) compared with 5.5.

15:389:30532:28:27:72:526:289:144:Times:144:Times:B:We present the descriptive statistics of our cross-country panel data in  appendix Table A3. The 
15:390:30628:27:28:72:526:262:144:Times:144:Times:B:Theil index statistics show that variations in sectoral diversification arise from both within- and 
15:391:30728:28:28:72:526:234:144:Times:144:Times:B:between-components.  Figure  1 displays  the  relationship  between  sectoral  diversification 
15:392:30822:28:27:72:526:206:144:Times:144:Times:B:(inversely) measured by the Theil index and terrain ruggedness.5 The relat ionship is evidently 
15:393:30918:27:28:72:528:179:144:Times:144:Times:B:non-mo notonic—that  is,  ruggedness  initially  helps  diversification,  but  at  higher  levels  of  
15:394:31021:28:29:72:526:151:144:Times:144:Times:B:ruggedness, countries tend to concentrate. This evidence supports the argument that the  costs

15:396:31177:9:16:72:526:113:48:Times:102:Times:F:5 On average, across our sample, Slovak Republic, Canada, and the US have the highest sectoral diversification 
15:397:31288:16:12:72:525:97:102:Times:102:Times:F:according to the employment-based metric, while Gambia, the Dominican Republic, and Rwanda have the lowest. 
15:398:31396:12:11:72:525:85:102:Times:102:Times:F:For the value-added-based Theil index, the first three countries with the highest levels of sectoral diversification 
15:399:31513:11:0:72:522:74:102:Times:102:Times:F:are France, the Czech Republic, and Canada, while the last three countries are Gambia, Rwanda, and Botswana. 
16:400:31624:0:27:72:526:758:144:Times:144:Times:B:associated  with  developing railways  and  roads  and  maintaining  transport  networks  grows 
16:401:31720:27:28:71:461:731:144:Times:144:Times:B:exponentially with terrain grade variation, as pointed out by Ramcharan (2010).  
16:402:31800:28:27:107:526:703:144:Times:144:Times:A:Appendix Figure A6 depicts the spat ial distribution of economic activity across the US 
16:403:31888:27:28:71:528:676:144:Times:144:Times:B:states  based  on  2011  satellite  night  lights  data.  According  to  our  metric,  the District  of  
16:404:31993:28:28:71:525:648:144:Times:144:Times:B:Columbia (DC) has the lowest spatial concentration of economic activity, given that almost all 
16:405:32088:28:27:71:526:620:144:Times:144:Times:B:its surface is lit up, while Alaska has the highest concentration, given a handful of nodes with 
16:406:32185:27:28:71:470:593:144:Times:144:Times:B:night light.6 New Jersey fo llows DC in terms of (the lowest) spatial concentration. 
16:407:32269:28:27:108:527:565:144:Times:144:Times:A:Figure 2, constructed  following  Cadot  et  al.  2011,  provides  striking  insights  into  the  
16:408:32367:27:28:72:527:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:within-  and  between-components of nights  lights  as  a  function  of  average  night  lights  for  a  
16:409:32472:28:28:72:527:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:given state. The figure demonstrates that as the average night light intensity increases, overall 
16:410:32570:28:27:72:526:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:spatial inequality decreases, particularly up to the average night light level of 24. Importantly, 
16:411:32669:27:28:72:526:455:144:Times:144:Times:B:the reduction is driven by the between-component up to the level of 15, meaning that new areas 
16:412:32764:28:27:72:526:427:144:Times:144:Times:B:are lit up such that overall spat ial concentration goes down. In our dataset, Indiana, Ohio, and 
16:413:32862:27:28:72:526:400:144:Times:144:Times:B:North Dakota witnessed the highest drops in overall spatial concentration from 1997 to 2011. 
16:414:32955:28:28:72:526:372:144:Times:144:Times:B:North Dakota is an especially instructive case—wit h an average night light value of 1.1 during 
16:415:33051:28:27:72:526:344:144:Times:144:Times:B:1997‒2009, North Dakota attained the night light level of 5.1 in 2013; the between-component 
16:416:33144:27:28:72:526:317:144:Times:144:Times:B:of its    Theil  index dropped from  1.02  in  1997  to  0.81  in  2011.  North  Dakota  experienced 
16:417:33245:28:27:72:526:289:144:Times:144:Times:B:reduced  spatial  concentration  because  of  recently  developed  oil  and  gas  fields  driven  by the 
16:418:33350:27:28:72:526:262:144:Times:144:Times:B:groundbreaking extraction technology known as hydraulic fracturing, or ‘fracking’; see Figure 
16:419:33444:28:28:72:491:234:144:Times:144:Times:B:A7, which marks a patch of night lights that overlayed with the newly opened oil field. 
16:420:33531:28:27:108:526:206:144:Times:144:Times:A:Returning to Figure 2, between the average night light levels of 15 and 24, the decrease 
16:421:33620:27:28:72:529:179:144:Times:144:Times:B:in  spat ial  inequality  is mainly driven  by  the  within-component,  suggesting  that  the  light  
16:422:33722:28:27:72:527:151:144:Times:144:Times:B:densit ies  among  the  existing  lit  nodes  become  relatively  more  equal.  In  this  range  of  night  
16:423:33830:27:38:72:528:124:144:Times:144:Times:B:lights,  Delaware  is  amo ng  the  top  three  (along  with  Ohio  and  Indiana)  that  experienced  
16:424:33932:38:8:72:218:86:122:g_d0_f6:122:g_d0_f6:F:                                                             
16:425:33993:8:0:72:517:78:42:Times:102:Times:F:6 In our analysis, we drop DC given its very small size; it is also an outlier, with an index almost equal to zero. 
17:426:34111:0:27:72:526:758:144:Times:144:Times:B:intensive margin-driven spat ial de-concentration. Its overall Theil index dropped from 0.60 to 
17:427:34207:27:28:72:522:731:144:Times:144:Times:B:0.42 from 1997 to 2011, which is almost wholly driven by the within-component. Such within-
17:428:34298:28:27:72:526:703:144:Times:144:Times:B:component domination of a spatial concentration decrease is depicted in Figure A8, where we 
17:429:34390:27:28:71:526:676:144:Times:144:Times:B:observe no subtle change in the pattern of night lights in Delaware between 2012 and 2016, but 
17:430:34484:28:28:71:526:648:144:Times:144:Times:B:some of the existing locations become more illuminated. This could be caused by the expansion 
17:431:34578:28:27:71:527:620:144:Times:144:Times:B:of already-established corporate  business  in  urban areas,  where  the  financial  services  sector  
17:432:34681:27:28:71:410:593:144:Times:144:Times:B:grew almost 21% between 2002 and 2012 (The News Journal, 2013).  
17:433:34745:28:27:107:527:565:144:Times:144:Times:A:In  Figure  2,  beyond  the  average  night  light  level  of  24,  overall  spatial  concentration  
17:434:34846:27:28:71:525:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:increases again, first by unequal relative shares of night light density among the extant lit nodes, 
17:435:34947:28:28:71:526:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:but then chiefly because of the between-component. Expressed another way, some active night 
17:436:35039:28:27:71:526:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:light nodes are darkened as the average night lights level goes beyond 30 (some  inequalit y is 
17:437:35135:27:28:71:526:455:144:Times:144:Times:B:also contributed by existing nodes that become more unequal). New Jersey serves as an ideal 
17:438:35227:28:27:71:523:427:144:Times:144:Times:B:example  in  this  context:  it  sparks  the  highest  level  of  average  night  lights—32.11 in 1997—
17:439:35330:27:28:71:525:400:144:Times:144:Times:B:among all states (except DC). However, some parts of New Jersey have lo st night lights over 
17:440:35423:28:28:71:526:372:144:Times:144:Times:B:time  because  of  economic  activities  in  the  state  shifting  to  more  vibrant  areas.  Figure A9 
17:441:35526:28:27:71:527:344:144:Times:144:Times:B:compares the night lights in New Jersey between 2012 and 2016—evidently, the  night  lights  
17:442:35619:27:28:71:526:317:144:Times:144:Times:B:in Old Bridge Township of New Jersey (marked in red circles) have faded   away. In Figure 2, 
17:443:35712:28:27:71:523:289:144:Times:144:Times:B:it  is  also  interesting  to  note  that  the  average  night  lights  do  not  correlate  with  the  between-
17:444:35823:27:28:71:526:262:144:Times:144:Times:B:component  except  at  either  end  of  the  spectrum.  This  is  not  surprising,  because introducing 
17:445:35926:28:28:71:526:234:144:Times:144:Times:B:new  lights  and  phasing  out  older  nodes  with  lights  occurs  at  both  ends.  Taken  together, the 
17:446:36031:28:27:71:526:206:144:Times:144:Times:B:spatial distribution of economic activity as measured by satellite night lights seems to provide 
17:447:36127:27:28:71:490:179:144:Times:144:Times:B:rich variation with which to explore the spatial concentration mechanism in this paper. 
17:448:36214:28:27:107:525:151:144:Times:144:Times:A:Table A4  presents  descriptive  statistics  for  all    US  state-level data.  Figure  A10 
17:449:36306:27:28:71:525:124:144:Times:144:Times:B:reinforces that the sectoral diversification‒ruggedness relationship is non-mo notonic within the 
17:450:36404:28:0:71:526:96:144:Times:144:Times:B:US states: at low levels of ruggedness, states are highly diversified (i.e., lower Theil  index), 
18:451:36505:0:27:72:526:758:144:Times:144:Times:B:and  at  higher  levels,  they  tend  to  become  sectorally  concentrated  (i.e.,  higher  Theil  index). 
18:452:36612:27:28:71:526:731:144:Times:144:Times:B:Finally, Figure A11 illustrates the relationship between ruggedness and spatial concentration, 
18:453:36707:28:27:71:525:703:144:Times:144:Times:B:and shows that, on average, states with higher levels of ruggedness tend to exhibit higher spatial 
18:454:36806:27:28:71:526:676:144:Times:144:Times:B:concentration. Unsurprisingly, this implies that entrepreneurial and residential areas are likely 
18:455:36904:28:28:71:244:648:144:Times:144:Times:B:to cluster with more rugged terrain.

18:461:37307:27:28:72:528:476:144:Times:144:Times:B:terrain-ruggedness index and  its  quadratic  form,  respectively.  The  quadratic  specification  
18:462:37406:28:31:72:523:448:144:Times:144:Times:B:captures the possible non-monotonicit y observed in the data presented in Figures 1, 2, and A10.

18:464:37608:29:27:72:525:388:144:Times:144:Times:B:openness. Income level is correlated with diversification as demonstrated in Imbs and Wacziarg 
18:465:37703:27:28:71:527:361:144:Times:144:Times:B:(2003),  and  we  include this in  the  model  along  wit h  its  quadratic.  Populat ion  is  intended  to  
18:466:37812:28:28:71:527:333:144:Times:144:Times:B:control  for  country size,  since  a  small economy  may  not  be  able  to  afford  to  diversify  its  
18:467:37918:28:27:71:526:305:144:Times:144:Times:B:production structure. Trade openness may create more scope for diversification because open 
18:468:38010:27:28:71:526:278:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries are likely to be producing and consuming a variety of goods. Data for these controls 
18:469:38105:28:28:71:526:250:144:Times:144:Times:B:come from the Penn World Tables. Zi includes time-invariant country characteristics, including 
18:470:38199:28:27:71:526:222:144:Times:144:Times:B:dummies for colonial origins and countries’ oil-exporting status. Colonial origin captures the 
18:471:38294:27:32:71:525:195:144:Times:144:Times:B:historical inst itutional factors, while oil exporters may have concentrated production structures.

18:473:38497:28:27:71:526:135:144:Times:144:Times:B:equation (1)   is not feasible because of the time-invariant nature of ruggedness. Therefore, our 
18:474:38595:27:0:71:529:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:benchmark is a pooled panel approach, where standard errors are clustered at the country level.  
19:475:38695:0:27:108:528:758:144:Times:144:Times:A:We  also  subject  our  main  results  to  a  variety  of  estimation  approaches,  including  
19:476:38790:27:28:71:525:731:144:Times:144:Times:B:random  effects,  HT  estimation,  and  the instrumentation  of  log income  per  capita  and  trade 
19:477:38891:28:27:71:525:703:144:Times:144:Times:B:openness in a two-stage least-squares estimation. A country’s income is instrumented with the 
19:478:38985:27:28:72:525:676:144:Times:144:Times:B:trade-weighted  income  of  its  neighbors  (e.g.,  Acemoglu et.  al  (2008)),  while  trade  is 
19:479:39082:28:28:71:525:648:144:Times:144:Times:B:instrumented with the predicted changes in bilateral trade owing to foreign natural disasters, as 
19:480:39180:28:27:71:285:620:144:Times:144:Times:B:adopted by Felbermayr and Groschl (2013). 
19:481:39221:27:28:107:527:593:144:Times:144:Times:A:As  indicated  previously,  cross-country  analysis  is  useful  for  examining  the  intensive  
19:482:39318:28:27:71:526:565:144:Times:144:Times:B:and extensive margins of sectoral diversification wit h a global picture; however, it is limited in 
19:483:39418:27:28:71:527:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:its  ability  to  shed  light  on  the  possible  mechanisms  of  effect,  given  that  a  large  variety  of  
19:484:39529:28:28:71:526:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries is unlikely to form comparable units with which to tease out the mechanism. Hence, 
19:485:39622:28:27:71:526:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:we turn to the single-country case to illuminate the potential channel. Thus, for within-country 
19:486:39719:27:28:71:526:455:144:Times:144:Times:B:analysis, we specify an equation similar to equation (1), where we retain the quadratic form of 
19:487:39815:28:27:71:526:427:144:Times:144:Times:B:ruggedness. The control variables are state size as measured by log population, trade openness 
19:488:39909:27:28:71:526:400:144:Times:144:Times:B:as proxied by export share of gross state product, log per capita gross state product as a measure 
19:489:40008:28:28:71:527:372:144:Times:144:Times:B:of inco me,  and  a  dummy  variable  for  major  oil-producing states.  The  equation  is  estimated  
19:490:40111:28:27:71:526:344:144:Times:144:Times:B:using  OLS  and  by  clustering  standard  errors  at  the  state  level.  As  above,  unobserved state 
19:491:40214:27:28:71:527:317:144:Times:144:Times:B:characteristics may result in omitted variable bias and thus could create a risk of endogeneity. 
19:492:40311:28:27:71:527:289:144:Times:144:Times:B:While  this  is  less  of  a  problem  in  the  single-country  case,  we  nonetheless also estimate  the  
19:493:40418:27:28:71:517:262:144:Times:144:Times:B:equation using the HT estimation method, considering openness and income as endogenous.

19:495:40513:28:27:71:219:206:144:Times:144:Times:B:5.1 Cross-Country Evidence 
19:496:40538:27:28:71:526:179:144:Times:144:Times:B:Table 1   presents the pooled OLS results for the effect of ruggedness on sectoral diversification. 
19:497:40638:28:27:71:526:151:144:Times:144:Times:B:Columns 1 to 6 report the results with emplo yment as the sectoral size measure. Focusing on 
19:498:40730:27:28:71:526:124:144:Times:144:Times:B:the overall Theil index, columns 1   and 2 demonstrate, without and with controls, respectively, 
19:499:40826:28:0:71:526:96:144:Times:144:Times:B:that both ruggedness and its quadratic are statistically significant. Using controls in column 2, 
20:500:40927:0:27:72:526:758:144:Times:144:Times:B:both  coefficients are significant at the 1% and 5% levels, confirming that terrain ruggedness 
20:501:41022:27:28:71:526:731:144:Times:144:Times:B:affects diversification in a non-monotonic fashio n. In particular, terrain ruggedness exhibits a 
20:502:41120:28:27:72:525:703:144:Times:144:Times:B:diversifying effect up to the ruggedness level of 2.06 (which corresponds to the 77th percentile) 
20:503:41218:27:28:72:526:676:144:Times:144:Times:B:and has a concentrating effect beyond this. Conversely, the negative and positive signs of the 
20:504:41313:28:28:72:523:648:144:Times:144:Times:B:coefficients  of  income  and  its  quadratic,  respectively,  confirm  the  well-established  non-
20:505:41412:28:27:72:526:620:144:Times:144:Times:B:monotonic relationship between income and sectoral diversification, as demonstrated by Imbs 
20:506:41504:27:28:72:525:593:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Wacziarg (2003). Economic size,  measured  by  log  population,  is  estimated to  be highly 
20:507:41601:28:27:71:525:565:144:Times:144:Times:B:significant, with the negative coefficient implying that larger countries have a greater scope to 
20:508:41699:27:28:71:128:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:diversify.7  
20:509:41712:28:28:108:525:510:144:Times:144:Times:A:We next focus on the intensive and extensive margins of sectoral diversification, which 
20:510:41800:28:27:72:525:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:is one of our main contributions. Reporting the results for the extensive margin, columns 3 and 
20:511:41896:27:28:71:523:455:144:Times:144:Times:B:4,  both  with  and  without  controls,  respectively,  document  a  statistically  significant  non-
20:512:41997:28:27:71:526:427:144:Times:144:Times:B:mo notonic effect for ruggedness. By contrast, the coefficient estimates in columns 5 and 6 yield 
20:513:42095:27:28:71:526:400:144:Times:144:Times:B:that intensive margins of sectoral diversification do not significantly correlate with a country’s 
20:514:42193:28:28:71:525:372:144:Times:144:Times:B:topographical structure. Thus, a key result here is that the relationship between the overall Theil 
20:515:42293:28:27:71:531:344:144:Times:144:Times:B:index   and   terrain   ruggedness   is   dominated   by   the   between-component   of   sectoral   
20:516:42394:27:28:71:526:317:144:Times:144:Times:B:diversification. Recall that between-component refers to the diversification arising because of 
20:517:42490:28:27:71:526:289:144:Times:144:Times:B:new sectors being introduced or older sectors being phased out.8 The implied turning point for 
20:518:42585:27:28:72:526:262:144:Times:144:Times:B:the   U-shaped   effect   of   ruggedness   on the   between-component   of   the   Theil   index is 
20:519:42686:28:28:72:526:234:144:Times:144:Times:B:approximately 1.7. This evidence offers important insights for economic geography literature, 
20:520:42779:28:27:72:527:206:144:Times:144:Times:B:and  should  be  further elaborated.  It  is  well known that  countries  with  rougher  surfaces  have  
20:521:42884:27:35:72:526:179:144:Times:144:Times:B:less developed road and rail transport networks—for example, Ramcharan (2009) documents 
20:522:42972:35:8:72:218:144:122:g_d0_f6:122:g_d0_f6:F:                                                             
20:523:43033:8:15:72:497:136:42:Times:102:Times:F:7 In unreported regressions, Herfindahl and Gini indices of sectoral diversification yield quite comparable 
20:524:43141:15:9:72:509:121:102:Times:102:Times:F:findings to the overall Theil index regarding the effect of terrain ruggedness (results available upon request). 
20:525:43253:9:15:72:526:112:42:g_d0_f6:102:Times:F:8 The number of new sectors should be interpreted cautiously here, as these new products are not necessarily true 
20:526:43366:15:12:71:525:97:102:Times:102:Times:F:entrepreneurial discoveries. In majority of cases, this corresponds to establishing firms and or producing products 
20:527:43482:12:11:71:527:85:102:Times:102:Times:F:that  already  exist  in  other  countries.  True  product  innovation  could  have  been  measured  at  more  detailed  
20:528:43603:11:0:71:354:74:102:Times:102:g_d0_f6:F:classifications of manufacturing firms; yet such data are not available. 
21:529:43678:0:27:72:526:758:144:Times:144:Times:B:that a 1% increase in surface roughness is associated with an approximately 1% decline in the 
21:530:43772:27:28:71:527:731:144:Times:144:Times:B:number  of  kilometers  of  roadway  within  a  country.  Our  result  suggests  that  rugged  terrain  
21:531:43876:28:27:71:391:703:144:Times:144:Times:B:impedes new sectors beyond a certain level of surface roughness.  
21:532:43942:27:28:107:526:676:144:Times:144:Times:A:For time-varying controls, economic size proxied by the log of population is    strongly 
21:533:44030:28:28:71:526:648:144:Times:144:Times:B:related to both the between-component and within-component of the Theil  index. In contrast 
21:534:44121:28:27:71:526:620:144:Times:144:Times:B:to the case of the overall Theil, income and its quadratic do not always significantly vary wit h 
21:535:44218:27:28:71:514:593:144:Times:144:Times:B:each component of diversification, but retain their negative and positive signs, respectively. 
21:536:44313:28:27:107:526:565:144:Times:144:Times:A:Columns 7 to 12 of Table 1 replicate the results using value-added as the sectoral size 
21:537:44401:27:28:71:525:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:measure. The findings for terrain ruggedness are qualitatively similar, pointing to the extensive 
21:538:44499:28:28:71:523:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:margin as the main driver of variation in sectoral diversification. As  per the income effect—
21:539:44593:28:27:71:527:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:although  the  U-shaped effect is present in  the  overall  Theil  case—only the coefficient of the 
21:540:44693:27:28:71:526:455:144:Times:144:Times:B:linear term is statistically significant. Inability to account for individual country heterogeneity 
21:541:44793:28:27:71:526:427:144:Times:144:Times:B:and the extended timeframe in our analysis (compared with Imbs and Wacziarg (2003)) may 
21:542:44881:27:28:71:526:400:144:Times:144:Times:B:explain the statistical insignificance of the quadratic term. Yet a significant relat ionship exists 
21:543:44982:28:28:71:528:372:144:Times:144:Times:B:between  income  and  the  intensive  margin  of  diversification,  suggesting that  the  level  of  
21:544:45083:28:27:71:521:344:144:Times:144:Times:B:development correlates strongly with variations in the value-added shares of existing sectors. 
21:545:45177:27:28:71:325:317:144:Times:144:Times:B:5.2 Sensitivity Analysis of Cross-Country Results 
21:546:45225:28:27:71:525:289:144:Times:144:Times:B:Thus  far,  we  have  addressed  individual  country  heterogeneity  through  clustered  standard 
21:547:45323:27:28:71:526:262:144:Times:144:Times:B:errors. Income and trade openness have also been assumed to be uncorrelated with the error 
21:548:45414:28:28:71:526:234:144:Times:144:Times:B:term. To improve the econometric inference, we extend the analysis in several directions. First, 
21:549:45511:28:27:71:526:206:144:Times:144:Times:B:we perform  a  random-effects  estimation.  As  reported  in  Table  2,  this method  improves  the 
21:550:45610:27:28:71:526:179:144:Times:144:Times:B:standard errors, but Hausman tests indicate that time-varying controls are correlated with the 
21:551:45705:28:0:71:522:151:144:Times:144:Times:B:error term (see columns 1, 4, and 7). Next, we adopt the HT estimation method, where time-
22:552:45798:0:27:72:526:758:144:Times:144:Times:B:varying controls are instrumented within the HT procedure.9 Baltagi et al.’s (2003) version of 
22:553:45893:27:28:72:525:731:144:Times:144:Times:B:the Hausman test demonstrates that compared with  fixed-effects estimates, the HT estimates 
22:554:45985:28:27:72:527:703:144:Times:144:Times:B:of time-varying controls are “acceptable.” This estimation approach results in better standard 
22:555:46080:27:28:71:523:676:144:Times:144:Times:B:errors  compared with  the benchmark  pooled  OLS  estimation  and  reinforces  the  inverted U-
22:556:46176:28:28:71:525:648:144:Times:144:Times:B:shaped effect of topography on sectoral diversification through its extensive margin (see Table 
22:557:46272:28:27:71:525:620:144:Times:144:Times:B:2,   columns 2, 5, and 8). Coefficients of ruggedness yield similar turning points, as in the pooled 
22:558:46373:27:28:71:525:593:144:Times:144:Times:B:OLS estimation—that is, approximately two in the overall Theil case and approximately 1.7 in 
22:559:46466:28:27:71:526:565:144:Times:144:Times:B:the between-Theil case. Columns 5 and 8 of Table 2 reinforce the key result that the extensive 
22:560:46560:27:28:71:444:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:margin of diversification dominates the variations in the overall Theil index.  
22:561:46640:28:28:107:525:510:144:Times:144:Times:A:Nevertheless,  income  and  trade  openness  may  still  be  correlated  with  the regression 
22:562:46734:28:27:71:526:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:error. We take an IV approach to address this correlation. Following Acemoglu et al. (2008), 
22:563:46827:27:28:71:527:455:144:Times:144:Times:B:we adopt the trade-share-weighted average income of trading partners as  an  instrument  for  a  
22:564:46924:28:27:71:526:427:144:Times:144:Times:B:country’s  own  income.  In  addit io n,  parallel  to  Felbermayr  and  Groschl  (2013),  we  use  the 
22:565:47028:27:28:71:526:400:144:Times:144:Times:B:predicted changes in bilateral trade owing to foreign natural disasters as instruments for trade 
22:566:47125:28:28:71:526:372:144:Times:144:Times:B:openness.   Foreign   natural   disasters   are   clearly   exogenous   to   a   country’s   sectoral 
22:567:47227:28:27:71:526:344:144:Times:144:Times:B:diversification, and are likely to influence diversification through their effects on trade links. 
22:568:47326:27:28:71:526:317:144:Times:144:Times:B:However, it is not immediately clear, as also acknowledged by Acemoglu et al. (2008) in the 
22:569:47418:28:27:71:527:289:144:Times:144:Times:B:context  of  their  study,  whether  the  trade-share-weighted  income  of  trading  partners  can  be  
22:570:47522:27:28:71:525:262:144:Times:144:Times:B:excluded from the diversification equation. It is more reasonable to assume that this instrument 
22:571:47619:28:28:71:526:234:144:Times:144:Times:B:provides only a partial correction to endogenous income, rather than a fully causal relationship. 
22:572:47717:28:27:71:523:206:144:Times:144:Times:B:That said, both IVs have strong explanatory powers in the first stage, as can be seen in the F-
22:573:47812:27:28:71:527:179:144:Times:144:Times:B:statistics from  Table  2 that  are  above  the  rule  of  thumb  10.  Focusing  on  the  sensitivity  of  
22:574:47919:28:54:71:527:151:144:Times:144:Times:B:ruggedness,  the  inefficient  2SLS  estimator,  as  anticipated,  produces higher standard  errors  
22:575:48020:54:8:72:218:97:122:g_d0_f6:122:g_d0_f6:F:                                                             
22:576:48081:8:15:72:525:89:42:Times:102:Times:F:9 Time-invariant controls are not instrumented. It does not appear that strong grounds exist for the endogeneity of 
22:577:48197:15:0:72:286:74:102:Times:102:Times:F:ruggedness, colonial origins, and oil-exporter status.  
23:578:48255:0:27:72:527:758:144:Times:144:Times:B:compared wit h pooled OLS (see Table 2, columns 3, 6, and 9). Yet the results reinforce our 
23:579:48347:27:28:72:526:731:144:Times:144:Times:B:main  finding  that  ruggedness  is  related  to  sectoral diversification in  an  inverted  U-shaped 
23:580:48449:28:27:72:526:703:144:Times:144:Times:B:fashio n  through  its  extensive  margin.  Value-added-based regressions  in  panel  B  of  Table  2 
23:581:48550:27:28:71:457:676:144:Times:144:Times:B:point to analogous variat ions, except that the standard errors are slightly higher. 
23:582:48635:28:28:72:226:648:144:Times:144:Times:B:5.3 Within-Country Evidence 
23:583:48662:28:27:72:526:620:144:Times:144:Times:B:We  now turn  to  the US state-level  data.  We initially  investigate  whether  the  non-monotonic 
23:584:48761:27:28:71:526:593:144:Times:144:Times:B:relat ionship  obtained  fro m  cross-country data also holds for the US. Subsequently, and more 
23:585:48858:28:27:71:525:565:144:Times:144:Times:B:importantly, we analyze the mechanism through which this relationship works. Recall that for 
23:586:48951:27:28:71:531:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:the   US,   we   are   unable   to   compute   the   extensive   and   intensive   margins   of   sectoral   
23:587:49060:28:28:71:526:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:diversification, and hence consider only overall sectoral diversification—however, we are able 
23:588:49155:28:27:72:424:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:to compute the extensive and intensive margins of spatial concentration.  
23:589:49229:27:28:108:529:455:144:Times:144:Times:A:Column  1 in  Table  3,  using  the  size metric  of  value-added to  measure  sectoral  
23:590:49318:28:27:72:531:427:144:Times:144:Times:B:diversification,   displays   the   inverted   U-shaped   link between   ruggedness   and   sectoral   
23:591:49421:27:28:72:526:400:144:Times:144:Times:B:diversification observed at the cross-country level. Although the coefficients of ruggedness and 
23:592:49518:28:28:72:527:372:144:Times:144:Times:B:its quadratic are not significant at conventional levels,  the  t-statist ic  of the non-linear term is 
23:593:49622:28:27:71:527:344:144:Times:144:Times:B:greater than  1.5.  Further,  the  non-linear  term  becomes  significant  at the  5%  level  in  the  full  
23:594:49731:27:28:71:526:317:144:Times:144:Times:B:model with controls (co lumn 2), where the linear ruggedness term is   negative wit h its   t-statistic 
23:595:49834:28:27:71:528:289:144:Times:144:Times:B:greater  than  1.5.  The  HT  estimation  of  the  full  model,  which  accounts  for  the  possible  
23:596:49936:27:28:71:526:262:144:Times:144:Times:B:endogeneity of income and trade openness, also confirms the non-linear relationship between 
23:597:50028:28:28:71:528:234:144:Times:144:Times:B:ruggedness  and  sectoral  diversification,  albeit  with  high  standard  errors.  The  latter  is  most  
23:598:50135:28:27:71:533:206:144:Times:144:Times:B:likely  because  the  HT  is  an  inefficient  IV  estimator.  Among   the  controls,  larger  population  
23:599:50242:27:28:71:525:179:144:Times:144:Times:B:creates more scope for diversification, while income has a concentrating effect.10 There is also 
23:600:50339:28:54:72:393:151:144:Times:144:Times:B:some evidence that major oil-producing states tend to concentrate. 
23:601:50405:54:8:72:218:97:122:g_d0_f6:122:g_d0_f6:F:                                                             
23:602:50466:8:15:72:515:89:42:Times:102:Times:F:10 Quadratic of income is not included in this estimation because unlike cross-country data, income among the 
23:603:50576:15:0:72:201:74:102:Times:102:Times:F:US states is less heterogeneous. 
24:604:50611:0:27:108:525:758:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our  findings  in  Table  4 importantly document  that  the  relationship  between  terrain 
24:605:50703:27:28:72:526:731:144:Times:144:Times:B:ruggedness and spat ial concentration is positive and significant. As the estimates with quadratic 
24:606:50802:28:27:72:525:703:144:Times:144:Times:B:form of ruggedness are consistently insignificant, we surmise that the relationship is linear. The 
24:607:50901:27:28:72:526:676:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates, obtained using pooled OLS with clustered standard errors at the state level, are also 
24:608:50998:28:28:72:525:648:144:Times:144:Times:B:robust to the  HT  estimation.  Table 4   explores  the effect of  ruggedness  on  the  between-  and 
24:609:51100:28:27:72:528:620:144:Times:144:Times:B:within-components  of  the  spatial  Theil  index  in  columns  5  to  12  using both OLS  and  HT  
24:610:51200:27:28:72:522:593:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimations. Columns  11 and 12 suggest  that  ruggedness  contributes  more  to  the  within-
24:611:51294:28:27:72:531:565:144:Times:144:Times:B:component of the spatial concentration,   given   its   statistically  and  economically  more  
24:612:51390:27:28:72:493:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:significant coefficients, than in  the case of the between-component in columns 7 and 8. 
24:613:51479:28:28:107:529:510:144:Times:144:Times:A:We  now  turn  to  the  mechanism through  which  topography may affect  sectoral  
24:614:51562:28:27:71:526:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:diversification. Recall that we measure the geographic concentration of firms and households 
24:615:51654:27:28:71:526:455:144:Times:144:Times:B:by the Theil index of satellite night lights data  along with its within- and between-components. 
24:616:51751:28:27:71:527:427:144:Times:144:Times:B:We  should reiterate here that  the  within-component  refers  to  the  density  of  light  in  a  given  
24:617:51857:27:28:71:525:400:144:Times:144:Times:B:localized  geographical  area. Conversely,  the  between-component  captures  how the spatial 
24:618:51951:28:28:71:526:372:144:Times:144:Times:B:distribution of areas with light evolves over time. An increase in this component would imply 
24:619:52045:28:27:71:526:344:144:Times:144:Times:B:a rise in spatial concentration. Table 5   reports our regression analysis, which includes variables 
24:620:52146:27:28:71:526:317:144:Times:144:Times:B:of overall spat ial Theil  index (columns 1 and 2), spatial between-component (columns 3 and 
24:621:52239:28:27:71:526:289:144:Times:144:Times:B:4),  and spatial wit hin-component  (columns  5  and  6),  with  OLS  and  HT  estimations.  The 
24:622:52336:27:28:71:526:262:144:Times:144:Times:B:following key  findings  stand  out.  First,  the  coefficients  of  the  overall spat ial Theil  index  in 
24:623:52444:28:28:71:526:234:144:Times:144:Times:B:columns 1 and 2 show that sectoral diversification tends to increase on average as economic 
24:624:52536:28:27:71:526:206:144:Times:144:Times:B:activity becomes more spatially concentrated. This result is robust to HT estimation. Second, 
24:625:52630:27:28:71:526:179:144:Times:144:Times:B:both the between-  and  within-components of  the  spatial  Theil  index  (columns  3  and  5)  are 
24:626:52730:28:27:71:527:151:144:Times:144:Times:B:significant  with  OLS,  and  the  between-component  stands  with  a  t-statistic  of  1.56  using  HT  
24:627:52835:27:28:71:526:124:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimation (column 4). This implies that the more new  resident ial  or industrial areas are built 
24:628:52934:28:0:71:526:96:144:Times:144:Times:B:by  extending  the  geographic  areas,  the  higher  the  sectoral diversification  levels.  Third,  with  
25:629:53044:0:27:72:526:758:144:Times:144:Times:B:spatial concentration measures added in the model, the coefficient of ruggedness is moderately 
25:630:53139:27:28:72:526:731:144:Times:144:Times:B:augmented,  especially  when  the between-component  of  (spatial)  Theil  index  is  included 
25:631:53234:28:27:72:527:703:144:Times:144:Times:B:(column  3).  This  provides  evidence  for  the  extensive  margin  of  spatial  concentration  as  the  
25:632:53340:27:28:72:445:676:144:Times:144:Times:B:mechanism of effect for the ruggedness‒sectoral diversification relationship.  
25:633:53419:28:28:108:526:648:144:Times:144:Times:A:The HT estimates in columns 4 and 6 generally support the findings obtained with OLS, 
25:634:53505:28:27:71:526:620:144:Times:144:Times:B:although the standard errors of the between- and within-components tend to be larger. This  is  
25:635:53601:27:28:71:526:593:144:Times:144:Times:B:most probably because of the HT estimator’s inefficiency. Nonetheless, as a word of caution, 
25:636:53694:28:27:72:526:565:144:Times:144:Times:B:the OLS coefficients obtained in columns 1, 3, and 5 are larger than the HT estimates, which 
25:637:53786:27:28:72:474:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:may imply that our OLS coefficients for the Theil indices may be upwardly biased. 
25:638:53867:28:28:108:525:510:144:Times:144:Times:A:Taken together, there is strong evidence that the (adverse) effect of spatial concentration 
25:639:53959:28:27:71:526:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:on  sectoral  diversification  works  through  the  extensive  margin  of  spatial  concentration.  The 
25:640:54063:27:28:71:527:455:144:Times:144:Times:B:broad  conclusion  is  that  rugged  topography  restricts  the  geographic  clusters  from  spat ially  
25:641:54168:28:27:71:525:427:144:Times:144:Times:B:extending; therefore, their sectoral structure remains concentrated. The corollary of this finding 
25:642:54267:27:28:71:526:400:144:Times:144:Times:B:is that if a state extends over space by introducing new lights, it may introduce new sectors. To 
25:643:54365:28:28:71:525:372:144:Times:144:Times:B:exemplify this, consider chemical factories and food factories,  which are unlikely to operate 
25:644:54460:28:27:71:525:344:144:Times:144:Times:B:within proximity. Thus, operating in different (light) clusters would mean that more sectors are 
25:645:54557:27:28:71:526:317:144:Times:144:Times:B:in  operation.  Our  finding  rules  out  the  alternative  hypothesis  that  ruggedness may  enable 
25:646:54658:28:27:71:527:289:144:Times:144:Times:B:opportunities  for  a  larger  home  market  by  facilitating  increasing  returns  to  scale  and  higher  
25:647:54766:27:28:71:526:262:144:Times:144:Times:B:productivity  levels  through  concentrating  economic  activities  in  a  narrow  area, and  thus 
25:648:54865:28:38:71:389:234:144:Times:144:Times:B:generating scope for sectoral diversification (Ramcharan (2009)). 
25:649:54931:38:27:71:141:196:144:Times:144:Times:B:6 Conclusion 
25:650:54942:27:28:71:526:169:144:Times:144:Times:B:This   paper   investigates   the   role   o f   physio-geography in   sectoral   diversification.   Our 
25:651:55047:28:27:71:526:141:144:Times:144:Times:B:investigation takes a two-pronged approach in which we first conduct a cross-country analysis 
25:652:55141:27:28:71:523:114:144:Times:144:Times:B:of  142  countries  over  the  period  1970‒2007, then a  within-country  analysis  using  US  state-
25:653:55242:28:0:71:526:86:144:Times:144:Times:B:level data for the period 1997‒2011. While the cross-country data provide useful insights into 
26:654:55340:0:27:72:526:758:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  global  relationship,  the  within-country  data  overcome  the  drawback  of  the  former  by 
26:655:55440:27:28:72:475:731:144:Times:144:Times:B:offering a homogeneous platform for a meaningful examination of the mechanism.  
26:656:55520:28:27:108:526:703:144:Times:144:Times:A:We present strong evidence for a robust and highly significant non-monotonic effect of 
26:657:55607:27:28:72:529:676:144:Times:144:Times:B:ruggedness in the  cross-country setting.  In  particular,  ruggedness  initially  assists  sectoral  
26:658:55709:28:28:72:530:648:144:Times:144:Times:B:diversification,  but  exhibits  a  concentrating  effect  beyond  a  certain  level.  In  a  unique  
26:659:55811:28:27:72:526:620:144:Times:144:Times:B:contribution,  we next explore the extensive and  intensive margins of sectoral diversification. 
26:660:55907:27:28:72:529:593:144:Times:144:Times:B:We  demonstrate  that  the  relationship  between  terrain  ruggedness  and  patterns  in  the  real  
26:661:56009:28:27:72:525:565:144:Times:144:Times:B:economy mostly works through the extensive margin of sectoral diversification, and, to a lesser 
26:662:56105:27:28:72:254:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:extent, through the intensive margin.  
26:663:56144:28:28:108:523:510:144:Times:144:Times:A:Moving  forward,  we  verify the  aforementioned  non-monotonic  effect  with  US state-
26:664:56232:28:27:72:525:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:level data. Then, we establish that terrain ruggedness increases spatial concentration, which in 
26:665:56329:27:28:72:526:455:144:Times:144:Times:B:turn reduces sectoral diversification. We measure spatial concentration with the satellite night 
26:666:56426:28:27:72:529:427:144:Times:144:Times:B:lights  data of Henderson,  Storeygard,  and  Weil  (2012),  where  we  adopt  a  more  literal  
26:667:56523:27:28:72:526:400:144:Times:144:Times:B:interpretation  of  data to  represent  the  geographic  distribution  of  night  lights.  Thus,  our 
26:668:56625:28:28:72:526:372:144:Times:144:Times:B:approach to using satellite night lights data contrasts with those of most previous studies, which 
26:669:56724:28:27:72:526:344:144:Times:144:Times:B:have used   the data only to proxy income. This approach, quite innovatively, also enables us to 
26:670:56820:27:28:72:526:317:144:Times:144:Times:B:compute the spatial extensive and intensive margins of night lights for the US. In this vein, we 
26:671:56917:28:27:72:525:289:144:Times:144:Times:B:document that as residential or industrial areas extend in space (i.e., spatial extensive margin), 
26:672:57016:27:28:72:525:262:144:Times:144:Times:B:sectoral diversification  tends  to  increase.  This  relationship  is  generally  robust  to  alternative 
26:673:57123:28:28:71:184:234:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimation approaches. 
26:674:57145:28:27:107:526:206:144:Times:144:Times:A:While geography’s role in economic development is widely studied, to the best of our 
26:675:57230:27:28:72:526:179:144:Times:144:Times:B:knowledge, this is the first paper that investigates its role in sectoral diversification, and, more 
26:676:57331:28:27:72:526:151:144:Times:144:Times:B:importantly, in the extensive and intensive margins of the latter. Another novel aspect of this 
26:677:57427:27:28:72:526:124:144:Times:144:Times:B:study is to shed light on the link between physio-geography and spatial concentration, as well 
26:678:57522:28:0:72:526:96:144:Times:144:Times:B:as  the extensive  and  intensive  margins  of spatial  distribution  of  economic  activity.  Taken 
27:679:57626:0:27:72:527:758:144:Times:144:Times:B:together,  our  findings  could  inform  the  global  debate  on  spreading  risks  across  sectors  to  
27:680:57731:27:28:71:530:731:144:Times:144:Times:B:mit igate  the  vulnerability  of  real  economies.  In  particular,  our   results   suggest  that  a  
27:681:57835:28:27:71:526:703:144:Times:144:Times:B:combination of innovative policies that incorporate the efficient use of space, urban planning, 
27:682:57930:27:28:71:526:676:144:Times:144:Times:B:and intersectoral linkages could help alleviate the adverse role of natural barriers that stand in 
27:683:58029:28:28:71:342:648:144:Times:144:Times:B:the way of a healthy trajectory of sectoral development.
