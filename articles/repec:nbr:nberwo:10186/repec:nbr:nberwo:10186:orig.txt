2:33:2047:28:30:273:338:610:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:ABSTRACT
2:34:2055:30:24:72:539:580:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Social  commentators  have  pointed  to  problems  of  women  workers  who  face  “time  stress”  –  an
2:35:2158:24:24:72:540:556:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:absence of sufficient time to accomplish all their tasks. An economic theory views time stress as
2:36:2255:24:24:72:540:532:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:reflecting how tightly the time constraint binds households. Time stress will be more prevalent in
2:37:2353:24:24:72:540:508:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:households with higher incomes and whose members work longer in the market or on “required”
2:38:2444:24:24:72:539:484:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:homework. Evidence from Australia, Canada, Germany, Korea and the United States corroborates
2:39:2536:24:24:72:540:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:this view. Adults in higher-income households perceive more time stress for the same amount of
2:40:2630:24:24:72:540:436:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:time spent in market work and household work. The importance of higher full incomes in generating
2:41:2727:24:24:72:539:412:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:time stress is not small, particularly in North America – much is “yuppie kvetch.” While time stress
2:42:2827:24:24:72:540:388:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:is most prevalent among working wives, a decomposition suggests that women would perceive more
2:43:2921:24:32:72:528:364:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:time stress than men even if both worked the same number of hours in the market and at home.

4:66:3233:0:25:90:165:714:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:I.  Introduction 
4:67:3250:25:26:126:525:689:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Substantial attention has been paid in the popular media and among social commentators 
4:68:3337:26:25:90:525:663:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:(e.g., Hochschild, 1997) to the issue of a “time crunch.”—a “shortage” of time faced by today’s 
4:69:3433:25:25:90:525:638:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:worker/consumers.1    This  issue  generates  much  concern  about  the  problems  of  working  people,  
4:70:3538:25:26:90:525:613:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:and working couples in particular, who have two market jobs and may be unable or unwilling to 
4:71:3632:26:25:90:525:587:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:substitute purchased services for time spent maintaining a household.  It is tied to surprise at the 
4:72:3733:25:25:90:527:562:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:possible  failure  of  annual  market  work  hours  to  decline  (Schor,  1991)  and  at  the  increasing  
4:73:3840:25:26:90:525:537:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:fraction of adults who participate in the labor market (so that market work per adult in the United 
4:74:3940:26:25:90:526:511:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:States  has  probably  risen  since  1950).    The  essence  of  the  problem  was  captured  by  a  young  
4:75:4048:25:25:90:526:486:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:working  mother  of  three  pre-school  children,  “With  the  kids  and  the  house,  I  often  feel  I  have  
4:76:4160:25:25:90:335:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:four hours of tasks and only two hours to do them in.”2 
4:77:4215:25:26:125:525:436:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Economists have not studied this problem at all, other than to observe changing patterns 
4:78:4304:26:25:89:525:410:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:of time use.  There has, however, been some research by social psychologists and sociologists on 
4:79:4401:25:25:89:526:385:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the  subject.    Much  simply  uses  time-budget  surveys  to  identify  demographic  correlates  of  total  
4:80:4510:25:26:89:524:360:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:time spent in market and household production, equating stress (a subjective outcome) with time 
4:81:4606:26:25:89:525:334:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:use  (an  objective  outcome).    A  few  studies  (Lochhead,  2002,  and  Holz,  2002)  have  used  small  
4:82:4714:25:25:89:526:309:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:representative  surveys  (for  Canada  and  Germany  respectively)  to  relate  subjective  feelings  of  
4:83:4820:25:25:89:406:284:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:time stress to demographic characteristics and to hours of market work. 
4:84:4892:25:26:125:525:259:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Time  stress  is  a  problem  analogous  to  poverty:    Both  reflect  the  scarcity  of  resources,  
4:85:4995:26:25:89:524:233:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:time in the former case, goods in the latter.  The only difference is that in a growing economy the 
4:86:5095:25:25:89:526:208:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:goods  constraint  will  relax  over  time,  while  the  time  constraint  cannot.    The  time  crunch  will  
4:87:5206:25:31:89:526:183:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:become  relatively  more  binding  for  more  people.    Once  one  thinks  about  time  stress  in  this

4:89:5371:7:16:90:524:145:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:1Newspaper stories discussed the issue, e.g., http://www.pressdemo.com/outlook98/stories/39353.html, and 
4:90:5476:16:11:89:526:129:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:are  legion  today.    Government  publications  such  as  http://www.ed.gov/pubs/PFIE/constrat.html  became  
4:91:5586:11:12:89:524:118:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:noticeable during the 1990s, although Linder (1970) pointed it out a generation earlier.  That there may be a 
4:92:5696:12:11:89:524:106:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:link to economic variables is suggested by recent publicity for Alain Ducasse’s gourmet lunch boxes, “The 
4:93:5802:11:12:89:524:95:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:big question in our lives is how to be at the same time a hedonist and in a hurry.” (The Economist, August

5:97:5991:0:25:90:527:714:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:economic  way,  the  approach  to  its  study  is  immediately  apparent:    Greater  time  stress  should  
5:98:6099:25:26:90:526:689:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:result  from  an  increasing  relative  abundance  of  goods,  since  time  and  purchased  goods  are  not  
5:99:6208:26:25:90:524:663:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:perfectly substitutable.  It is not only the leisure class that will be “harried” (Linder, 1970):  Any 
5:100:6311:25:25:89:526:638:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:group,  regardless  of  its  hours  of  work,  will  perceive  itself  under  increasing  time  stress  as  its  
5:101:6424:25:26:89:281:613:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:ability to purchase market goods increases. 
5:102:6468:26:25:126:524:587:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:There are two central issues here for economists:  1) Do economists have anything useful 
5:103:6557:25:25:89:525:562:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:to add to the discussion (other than more complex statistical techniques) beyond what scholars in 
5:104:6655:25:26:89:524:537:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:other disciplines have offered?  2) If so, what is our comparative advantage?  The former issue is 
5:105:6754:26:25:89:525:511:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:crucial:  While economists are increasingly engaged in empirical studies of subjective outcomes, 
5:106:6851:25:25:89:526:486:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:in  many  cases  our  research  addresses  questions  that  scholars  in  other  disciplines  have  already  
5:107:6960:25:25:89:524:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:addressed, is not linked to economic theory, and/or uses different data sets but employs methods 
5:108:7057:25:26:89:524:436:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:and approaches used many times before by others.3  On the second question, as in most cases in 
5:109:7152:26:25:89:524:410:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:which economists have successfully addressed areas that had previously been considered outside 
5:110:7247:25:25:89:528:385:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:our   purview   (e.g.,   Becker,   1976),   our   comparative   advantage   surely   lies   in   adducing   a   
5:111:7359:25:26:89:322:360:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:maximizing theory to describe and predict behavior. 
5:112:7411:26:25:126:525:334:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:In  Section  II  we  thus  derive  an  economic  theory  of  time  stress  and  generate  predictions  
5:113:7514:25:25:89:524:309:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:from it.  The essential novelty is to link time stress to the shadow price of time, which allows us 
5:114:7614:25:25:89:526:284:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:to  treat  it  in  the  context  of  a  model  of  the  representative  consumer  who  purchases  goods  and  
5:115:7724:25:26:89:524:259:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:allocates time.  Because the outcome is subjective, it is even more important than usual to test the 
5:116:7825:26:25:89:525:233:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:theory on several data sets and allow for the possibility that the framing of the survey questions 
5:117:7924:25:25:89:526:208:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:might  incorrectly  be  seen  as  supporting  or  refuting  the  theory.      Section  III  thus  discusses  a  
5:118:8036:25:26:89:524:183:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:variety of data sets that are used in the subsequent analyses, which are presented in Section IV for

6:126:8570:0:25:90:280:714:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:II.  An Economic Theory of Time Stress 
6:127:8609:25:26:126:527:689:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:  “Stress”  has  a  large  number  of  dictionary  definitions;  but  the  most  relevant  here  is  
6:128:8710:26:25:89:524:663:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:“physical, mental or emotional strain or tension.” Time stress should thus be interpreted as strain 
6:129:8810:25:25:89:525:638:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:or  tension  that  is  generated  by  feelings  that  the  available  time  is  insufficient  to  accomplish  the  
6:130:8925:25:26:90:525:613:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:desired activities.  Time, like goods, is always insufficient—because time is limited, everyone is 
6:131:9024:26:25:90:203:587:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:to some extent stressed.   
6:132:9051:25:25:126:525:562:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:While some of the predictions derived here could be generated if we define the household 
6:133:9140:25:26:89:525:537:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:as  maximizing  some  utility  function  defined  over  leisure  and  goods  consumption,  the  particular  
6:134:9248:26:25:89:525:511:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:role of a time constraint is clarified if we follow Becker (1965), introduce time explicitly into the 
6:135:9350:25:25:89:525:486:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:model, and view households as producing commodities by combining home time, T-H, and goods 
6:136:9441:25:25:89:458:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f5:X.  Commodities Zi are produced according to the household production functions: 
6:137:9522:25:26:90:231:436:121:g_d0_f5:121:g_d0_f3:(1)        Zi = Zi(Ti , Xi), i = 1, 2. 
6:138:9561:26:25:90:316:410:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:We assume that the household’s utility function is: 
6:139:9613:25:25:90:238:385:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3: U(Z1 , Z2 ) + V(Hm, Hf)  , 
6:140:9640:25:26:90:525:360:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:where  the  subscripts  m  and  f  denote  the  husband  and  wife,  and  the  Hi denote market work. The 
6:141:9746:26:26:89:526:334:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:function  reflects  the  disutility  of  market  work,  with  U  and  V  assumed  additively  separable  for  
6:142:9856:26:27:89:525:308:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:simplicity.      As  usual,  we  assume  that Vj  <  0  and  Vjj  <  0,  Ui>  0  and  Uii  <  0.    Perhaps  most  
6:143:9971:27:25:89:527:281:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:important,  for  now  we  do  not  examine  the  internal  distribution  of  consumption  within  the  
6:144:10074:25:25:89:462:256:121:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:household, implicitly thus assuming a unitary model of household decision-making. 
6:145:10155:25:25:126:525:231:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:As is usual in the time-goods model, let household production functions be characterized 
6:146:10244:25:26:89:185:206:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:by fixed coefficients: 
6:147:10267:26:25:89:278:180:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f5:(2) Ti  = tiZi  and  Xi  = biZi  , i = 1, 2, 
6:148:10312:25:25:90:489:155:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:and let goods prices be pi.    The household’s income, which is entirely spent on the Xi, is: 
6:149:10406:25:26:89:246:130:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:(3) ΣpiXi  = Hmwm + Hfwf + I , 
6:150:10437:26:25:89:526:104:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:where  I  is  unearned  income,  and  the  wj   are  the  spouses’  wage  rates.    The  household  faces  this  
6:151:10550:25:0:90:294:79:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:goods constraint and the total time constraint: 
7:152:10599:0:25:90:206:714:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:(4) ΣTi = T- Hm- Hf  . 
7:153:10622:25:27:90:333:689:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3: The household’s problem is then to maximize:

7:155:10731:18:12:90:93:644:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3: 
7:156:10731:12:26:90:525:632:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:where μ is the Lagrangean multiplier on the goods constraint, and λ is the Lagrangean multiplier 
7:157:10828:26:25:90:526:606:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:on  the  time  constraint.    It  seems  reasonable  to  assume  that  time  stress,  a  subjective  measure,  is  
7:158:10943:25:25:90:525:581:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:positively related to the shadow price of time, λ.  In order to simplify matters we assume that the 
7:159:11043:25:26:90:528:556:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:husband’s  hours  of  market  work  are  fixed,  consistent  with  the  widely  observed  near-zero  
7:160:11144:26:25:90:281:530:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:elasticity of labor supply of married men.   
7:161:11189:25:27:126:268:505:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:One can show that ∂λ/∂I >0 if:

7:165:11461:25:26:89:525:398:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:side stands in the same proportion to the change in the marginal utility of an hour of her time at

8:200:12313:0:25:90:525:714:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:will increase the degree to which the time constraint binds.  Obviously hours in the day are fixed, 
8:201:12413:25:26:90:526:689:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:so  that  the  economic  meaning  of  the  prediction  ∂λ/∂T <  0  cannot  be  about  a  pure  increase  in  
8:202:12521:26:25:90:525:663:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:available  time.    Rather,  anything  that  makes  the  household  more  efficient  in  its  home  activities  
8:203:12633:25:25:90:525:638:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:can be viewed as equivalent to an increase in effective time and should thus reduce the extent to

8:209:13178:25:25:89:526:486:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f3:∂Hm/∂I≤0,  so  that  the  ceteris  paribus  positive  impact  of  increases  in  unearned  income  on  λ  is  
8:210:13288:25:25:89:414:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:attenuated by the changes in husbands’ work hours that they may induce. 
8:211:13360:25:26:89:525:436:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:  We  have  implicitly  treated  the  household  as  being  characterized  by  a  unitary  model  of  
8:212:13462:26:25:89:524:410:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:household decision-making—we have assumed that there is a family utility function.  A massive

8:214:13661:25:26:89:526:360:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:complex  than  this.    So  long  as  we  assume  that  the  household’s  maximization  is  a  two-step

8:216:13868:25:25:89:526:309:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:independent  of  the  sharing  rule—the  basic  predictions  of  the  model  do  not  change  when  we  
8:217:13972:25:25:89:407:284:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:assume a more complex decision-making process within the household.

8:223:14545:25:60:90:525:132:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:for the production of household commodities, such as additional market work, will also increase

8:225:14699:7:0:90:493:65:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:4Theorizing about the determinants of a Lagrangean multiplier is unusual, but see Weinberg (2001). 
9:226:14799:0:25:90:526:714:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:time  stress.    We  are  thus  equating  subjective  time  stress  with  the  unmeasurable,  but  predictable  
9:227:14911:25:26:90:340:689:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:tightness of the time constraint that the household faces. 
9:228:14970:26:25:90:528:663:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:    We  wrote  the  production  functions  Z  as  identical  across  households,  which  much  
9:229:15065:25:25:90:525:638:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:research  has  shown  to  be  incorrect.    Perhaps  the  major  problem  is  the  implicit  assumption  that  
9:230:15176:25:26:90:528:613:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:people are equally efficient in combining goods and time regardless of their other characteristics.  
9:231:15277:26:25:90:526:587:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:An  important  determinant  of  the  productivity  of  time  in  the  household  is  its  members’  health  
9:232:15385:25:25:90:526:562:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:(Grossman,  1972).    Better  health  makes  one  more  efficient  in  producing  commodities  in  the  
9:233:15489:25:26:90:524:537:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:household, effectively raising the productivity of time and thus reducing time stress (and financial 
9:234:15590:26:25:90:525:511:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:stress as well).  Thus for theoretical reasons, and because health is likely to be correlated with the 
9:235:15693:25:25:89:525:486:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:central variables on which we focus, full incomes and hours of work, it is crucial to account for 
9:236:15791:25:25:89:294:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:differences in health in describing time stress. 
9:237:15840:25:26:89:277:436:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:III.  Data Sets for Studying Time Stress 
9:238:15881:26:25:89:529:410:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:   No   large   recent   nationally   random   sample   of   Americans   contains   information   on   
9:239:15984:25:25:89:526:385:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:perceptions  of  time  stress.    Thus  the  predictions  of  Section  II  cannot  be  tested  thoroughly  on  
9:240:16095:25:26:89:524:360:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:current or recent U.S. data.  To compensate for this (ethnocentric) difficulty we use large data sets 
9:241:16197:26:25:89:525:334:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:from  several  different  countries  (and  a  small  data  set  from  the  U.S.).    Because  the  samples  of  
9:242:16309:25:25:89:525:309:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:single  individuals  are  not  very  large,  and  because  the  popular  discussion  of  time  stress  revolves  
9:243:16422:25:25:89:499:284:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:around the behavior of married couples, we restrict the analysis to male-female partnerships.

9:245:16606:26:25:89:526:233:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:information  on  perceived  time  stress  and  standard  household  demographic/economic  variables  
9:246:16707:25:25:89:525:208:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:(Wooden et al, 2002).  Modeled after the U.S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics, the first wave, 
9:247:16801:25:26:89:525:183:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:from  2001,  obtained  responses  from  13,969  members  of  7682  households.    It  addressed  to  each  
9:248:16908:26:25:89:528:157:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:adult respondent a questionnaire including,  “How often do you feel rushed or pressed for time?  
9:249:17005:25:25:89:313:132:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Almost always; often; sometimes; rarely; never.”   
9:250:17056:25:26:90:525:107:100:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3: The German Socio-economic Panel (SOEP) has 19 years of data, with the current sample 
9:251:17141:26:0:89:525:81:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:containing  approximately  12,000  households.  (Wagner  et  al, 1993)  Its sponsors included in the 
10:252:17243:0:25:90:525:714:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:2002 wave a version of the same question on time stress that was contained in the HILDA.  The 
10:253:17337:25:26:90:526:689:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:question  and  possible  responses  are:    “Think  about  the  last  four  weeks.    How  often  during  this  
10:254:17449:26:25:90:526:663:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:period  did  it  happen  that  you  felt  rushed  or  under  time  pressure?  Always;  often;  sometimes;  
10:255:17556:25:25:90:187:638:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:almost never; never.” 
10:256:17578:25:26:126:527:613:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Neither  of  these  data  sets  reports  actual  time  spent  in  market  work  and  on  household  
10:257:17678:26:25:90:525:587:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:tasks.  In both respondents state how many hours per day or per week they usually spend in these 
10:258:17775:25:25:90:525:562:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:activities.  Thus like any retrospective data that are unconstrained by the need to sum to a fixed 
10:259:17874:25:26:90:526:537:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:available  time,  they  are  subject  to  potential  reporting  problems.    Fortunately  the  1999  Korean  
10:260:17983:26:25:90:526:511:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Time  Use  Study  (KTUS)  includes  the  question:    “How  often  do  you  feel  rushed  or  pressed  for  
10:261:18091:25:25:90:524:486:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:time?  Always; often; rarely; never.”  The survey covered 17,000 households, including all adult 
10:262:18188:25:25:90:526:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:members.    It  obtained  time  diaries  for  each  person  for  two  days,  as  well  as  some  demographic  
10:263:18298:25:26:90:526:436:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:data.    Unfortunately  it  lacks  information  on  wages  and  incomes,  which  we  must  impute  using  a  
10:264:18407:26:25:90:362:410:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:large contemporaneous Korean data set covering individuals. 
10:265:18467:25:25:126:526:385:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:In  1998  the  Canadian  General  Social  Survey  included  a  time-diary  component,  so  that  
10:266:18564:25:26:90:526:360:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:like  the  KTUS  the  CGSS  provides  both  actual  and  recall  information  on  time  use.    Moreover,  
10:267:18671:26:25:90:525:334:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:information is available on each respondent’s income and that of her/his spouse.  The drawback is 
10:268:18769:25:25:90:525:309:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:that  it  included  only  one  adult  in  each  household,  so  that  we  cannot  examine  the  time  stress  of  
10:269:18883:25:25:90:525:284:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:spouses jointly.  Also, the question on time stress was somewhat different from that in the other 
10:270:18981:25:26:90:526:259:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:surveys:    “How  often  do  you  feel  rushed?    Would  you  say  it  is  every  day;  a  few  times  a  week;  
10:271:19095:26:25:90:410:233:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:about once a week; about once a month; less than once a month; never.”

10:273:19263:25:26:90:527:183:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:(QAL)  of  1971  and  1978  (Campbell,  Converse  and  Rodgers,  1975;  Campbell  and  Converse,  
10:274:19361:26:25:90:527:157:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:1984)  included  questions  on  time  stress  as  part  of  their  small  samples  of  individuals.    The  
10:275:19469:25:25:90:526:132:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:question  was:    “In  general,  how  do  you  feel  about  your  time—would  you  say  you  always  feel  
10:276:19576:25:26:90:526:107:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:rushed  even  to  do  the  things  you  have  to  do,  only  sometimes  feel  rushed,  or  almost  never  feel  
10:277:19688:26:0:90:525:81:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:rushed?” The QAL contains no information on the time use of respondents’ spouses other than an 
11:278:19784:0:25:90:525:714:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:indicator  of  whether  or  not  the  spouse  works;  and  there  is  no  information  on  the  respondents’  
11:279:19894:25:26:89:524:689:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:allocation of non-market time.  The analysis for the United States is thus based on individuals on 
11:280:19993:26:25:89:383:663:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:whose spouses and on whom there is relatively little information.5

11:282:20096:25:26:90:527:613:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:  Our  purpose  is  to  link  the  data  on  perceived  time  stress  to  measures  of  time  use,  the  
11:283:20201:26:25:90:524:587:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:scarcity of time for household production and the income used to purchase goods to combine with 
11:284:20297:25:25:90:526:562:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:that  time.    We  group  Australia  and  Germany  together  because  of  the  similarity  of  the  questions  
11:285:20408:25:26:90:525:537:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:about time stress and the underlying data on time use, and we group Korea and Canada together 
11:286:20502:26:25:90:525:511:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:for the latter reason.  In each Part we examine the distribution of perceived time stress and how it 
11:287:20603:25:25:90:526:486:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:differs  by  sex.    Each  then  proceeds  to  analyze  the  determinants  of  interpersonal  differences  in  
11:288:20714:25:25:90:524:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:time stress.  We restrict the analyses to couples in which at least one of the partners is working in 
11:289:20816:25:26:90:527:436:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the  labor  market.    We  also  analyze  married  couples  with  both  spouses  working  in  the  labor  
11:290:20922:26:25:90:526:410:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:market—the  archetypal  couple  in  the  social-psychological  “time  crunch”  literature.    Since  the  
11:291:21028:25:25:90:526:385:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:theory  in  Section  II  ignored  corner  solutions  to  the  household’s  maximization  problem,  these  
11:292:21134:25:26:90:282:360:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:latter results are especially worth attention. 
11:293:21181:26:25:90:525:334:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3: In addition to their diversity in the questions about time stress and the data on time use, 
11:294:21273:25:25:90:527:309:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the  data  sets  contain  different  measures  of  incomes  or  earnings.    To  make  the  results  more  
11:295:21380:25:25:90:526:284:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:comparable  across  all  five  data  sets,  we  include  the  single  measure,  total  household  income  (or  
11:296:21491:25:26:90:525:259:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:total household earnings) in the equations describing time stress.  (Since we restrict the analyses 
11:297:21591:26:25:90:525:233:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:to households with at least one working partner, the differences between income and earnings are 
11:298:21688:25:25:90:528:208:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:unlikely  to  be  important.)    By  including  this  measure  and  hours  of  market  work  we  are  
11:299:21790:25:42:90:526:183:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:approximating  as  closely  as  possible  full  income,  the  theoretical  construct  in  Section  II.6  The  
11:300:21900:42:7:90:237:141:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:                                                           
11:301:21958:7:16:90:524:134:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:5Questions similar to those in the QAL were asked of some of the respondents in the 1982 and 1996 U.S. 
11:302:22061:16:12:89:524:118:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:General Social Surveys.  Because these samples are smaller even than the QAL, and because the data may 
11:303:22164:12:11:89:360:106:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:not be entirely comparable, we do not include them in the analysis. 
11:304:22232:11:7:89:94:95:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:  
11:305:22234:7:16:90:525:88:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:6Time  prices—hourly  wage  rates—are  unavailable  in  any  of  the  data  sets;  and  creating  them  by  dividing  
11:306:22352:16:12:89:479:72:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:earnings by hours of market work generates the usual problems of division bias (Borjas, 1980).

12:312:22739:25:26:90:525:613:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:HILDA and the 2002 German SOEP are shown in Table 1, first for partners in all couples with a 
12:313:22833:26:25:90:525:587:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:working  spouse,  then  for  partners  in  two-earner  couples.7    In  all  cases  perceived  time  stress  is  
12:314:22946:25:25:90:527:562:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:greater  among  women  than  men.    The  differences  by  sex  are  slightly  greater  in  two-earner  
12:315:23050:25:26:90:524:537:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:couples, suggesting (since women are less likely to be the worker in one-worker households) that 
12:316:23147:26:25:90:525:511:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:differences  in  the  incidence  of  market  work  are  an  important  determinant  of  differences  in  time  
12:317:23258:25:25:90:525:486:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:stress.  In these data most members of couples that are not entirely out of the labor force perceive 
12:318:23359:25:25:90:525:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:substantial time pressure (perhaps a recognition of the time constraint that everyone faces).  That 
12:319:23459:25:26:90:412:436:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:pressure is somewhat greater when both partners are in the labor market. 
12:320:23532:26:25:126:525:410:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Of particular interest is the relationship between the partners’ stress.  As the chi-squares 
12:321:23625:25:25:90:528:385:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:show,  these  are  not  independent:    Where  one  partner  is  more  stressed  for  time,  so  is  the  other.    
12:322:23741:25:26:90:526:360:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:This  provides  an  empirical  basis  for  the  view  in  Section  II  that  perceived  time  stress  should  be  
12:323:23855:26:25:90:524:334:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:analyzed in the context of the family’s time constraint.  Whether these interactions are determined 
12:324:23955:25:25:90:527:309:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:by  similar  underlying  tastes,  by  objective  unmeasurable  variables,  or  by  the  impacts  of  one  
12:325:24061:25:25:90:516:284:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:partner’s observable activities on the other’s time stress cannot be inferred from this simple test. 
12:326:24162:25:26:126:526:259:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Given  the  wealth  of  information  on  time  use  in  the  HILDA  and  the  SOEP,  it  is  worth  
12:327:24262:26:25:90:525:233:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:examining  some  of  the  crucial  variables.  Table  2  presents  the  means  and  standard  deviations  of  
12:328:24372:25:25:90:525:208:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:these  variables  separately  by  gender  for  the  two  types  of  couples.    (Where  the  definitions  differ  
12:329:24486:25:26:90:526:183:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:between  the  two  countries,  the  categories  in  parentheses  describe  Germany.)    In  both  countries  
12:330:24595:26:39:90:526:157:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:one  set  of  questions  asks  the  respondent  about  his/her  main  job,  both  the  weekly  hours  worked  
12:331:24705:39:7:90:237:118:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:                                                           
12:332:24763:7:16:90:525:111:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:7Throughout  this  Part  we  include  both  married  couples  and  the  substantial  number  of  (typically  younger)  
12:333:24882:16:12:90:527:95:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:couples  who  state  they  are  in  permanent  partnerships.    This  recognizes  the  nature  of  contemporary  
12:334:24995:12:11:90:524:83:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:household relationships in Australia and Germany.  Eleven (12) percent of the couples in the larger sample 
12:335:25102:11:12:90:522:72:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:in Australia (Germany) are partnered rather than married, as are 13 (14) percent of the couples in the two-
12:336:25209:12:0:90:157:60:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:worker sample.  
13:337:25227:0:25:90:526:714:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:and  the  number  of  days  on  which  work  is  performed.8    Another  series  of  questions  asks  how  
13:338:25334:25:26:89:525:689:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:hours in a typical day are distributed across a set of seven categories of activities.  We aggregate 
13:339:25435:26:25:89:527:663:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:those  that  might  be  viewed  as  household  work  or  as  dependent  (child  and  elder)  care  and  
13:340:25539:25:25:89:526:638:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:concentrate  on  those  aspects  of  non-market  work.    We  multiply  these  responses  by  7  to  make  
13:341:25646:25:26:89:365:613:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:them comparable to the data on weekly hours of market work. 
13:342:25706:26:25:126:526:587:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Most  of  the  statistics  seem  quite  reasonable:    Where  both  spouses  work  in  the  market,  
13:343:25807:25:25:89:525:562:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:men’s total hours on all jobs are longer, and they work more days per week. Among two-earner 
13:344:25900:25:26:89:524:537:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:households Australian men’s hours of dependent care and errands/housework are far below those 
13:345:25994:26:25:89:525:511:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:of women, to the point that the total of these and market work hours is somewhat less (62 hours 
13:346:26090:25:25:89:525:486:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:per week) than that of their partners (66 hours per week).  Among two-earner German households 
13:347:26185:25:25:89:524:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the comparable figures are 58 and 69 hours.  The excess of female over male total work hours is 
13:348:26281:25:26:89:524:436:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:about the same among all couples in Australia as it is in two-earner couples, but it is even larger 
13:349:26381:26:25:89:525:410:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:in  the  sample  of  German  couples  with  at  least  one  working  partner.    Unsurprisingly,  given  the  
13:350:26491:25:25:89:525:385:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:relatively  small  dispersion  of  hours  of  market  work  in  Germany  (Hamermesh,  1996,  Ch.  2),  the  
13:351:26599:25:26:89:433:360:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:deviation from a five-day workweek is much smaller in the German sample.   
13:352:26674:26:25:126:525:334:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:The HILDA provides information on each partner’s income, and we use the sum of these 
13:353:26759:25:25:89:526:309:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:throughout  the  analysis.    For  the  SOEP  we  use  twelve  times  the  sum  of  the  partners’  gross  
13:354:26866:25:25:89:527:284:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:monthly  pay,  computed  as  monthly  pay  plus  1/12  of  extra  pay  (13th  and  14th  month  pay,  
13:355:26968:25:26:89:525:259:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Christmas  pay  and  vacation  bonus),  in  recognition  of  German  wage-payment  institutions.    The  
13:356:27073:26:25:89:449:233:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:resulting averages accord with published reports (Borland, 1999; Gerlach, 1987). 
13:357:27154:25:25:125:524:208:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:For Australia we define the person as stressed if he/she responds as being always or often 
13:358:27245:25:26:89:526:183:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:stressed  for  time,  thus  including  about  half  of  the  samples  as  being  stressed.    Aside  from  the  
13:359:27357:26:28:89:526:157:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:central  variables  of  interest,  in  this  and  the  subsequent  Parts  we  also  adjust  for  a  number  of  
13:360:27469:28:7:90:237:129:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:                                                           
13:361:27527:7:16:90:525:122:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:8Data are also available on weekly hours of moonlighting.  Only 6 percent of the men and 5 percent of the 
13:362:27633:16:11:89:525:106:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:women in each country report such other work, with the mean weekly hours on second jobs equaling 12 for 
13:363:27737:11:12:89:524:95:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:men and 10 for women (7 for both sexes in Germany) among those who moonlight.  Since days worked on 
13:364:27837:12:11:89:524:83:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:the second job are not reported, and since the fractions working such jobs and the hours worked on them 
13:365:27941:11:12:89:523:72:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:are quite small, we ignore them in the analysis that we present.  Replacing hours on the main job with hours 
13:366:28050:12:0:89:469:60:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:worked on all jobs has, unsurprisingly, only minute effects on the estimates in Tables 3 and 4. 
14:367:28148:0:25:90:528:714:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:demographic  variables  that  might  affect  perceived  time  stress.    In  Australia  these  include  
14:368:28252:25:26:90:525:689:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:indicators of urban residence, immigrant status and whether the couple is married.  Also included 
14:369:28350:26:25:90:525:663:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:here,  but  not  presented  in  the  tables,  are  indicators  of  the  number  of  pre-school  and  school-age  
14:370:28463:25:25:90:525:638:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:children.  Finally, here and later we also include measures of the partner’s hours of market work 
14:371:28561:25:26:90:370:613:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:and hours spent on each of the aggregates of non-market work. 
14:372:28623:26:25:126:527:587:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Table  3  presents  estimates  of  the  probit  functions  relating  whether  the  respondent  is  
14:373:28722:25:25:90:525:562:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:always  or  often  stressed  for  time  to  the  major  variables  of  interest.    Each  coefficient  shows  the  
14:374:28837:25:26:90:525:537:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:impact on the probability of being stressed of a one-unit increase in the variable.  The estimates 
14:375:28936:26:25:90:522:511:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:are  presented  separately  for  men  and  women,  and  for  all  couples  with  a  worker  and  for  two-
14:376:29042:25:25:90:527:486:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:earner  couples  only.    The  sample  sizes  are  substantially  smaller  than  those  implied  by  the  
14:377:29148:25:25:90:524:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:statistics in Table 1, mainly because data on the broad measure of household incomes are missing 
14:378:29245:25:26:90:240:436:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:in about 20 percent of the cases.   
14:379:29281:26:25:126:527:410:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:The  central  contribution  of  economic  analysis  to  the  discussion  of  time  stress  is  its  
14:380:29381:25:25:90:525:385:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:emphasis on the role of command over market goods in generating stress.  The crucial prediction 
14:381:29477:25:26:89:525:360:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:is that, other things equal, respondents in higher-income households will state that they are more 
14:382:29576:26:25:90:526:334:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:stressed  for  time.    Except  for  men  in  two-worker  households,  where  we  find  no  effect,  the  
14:383:29682:25:25:90:527:309:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:estimates  corroborate  this  prediction:    The  effect  of  additional  household  income,  holding  all  
14:384:29790:25:25:90:521:284:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:other characteristics constant, is positive, and it is statistically significant for Australian women.   
14:385:29895:25:26:126:525:259:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Working the same number of hours per week spread over additional days, has a negative, 
14:386:29982:26:25:90:525:233:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:but  statistically  insignificant  effect  on  perceived  stress.    Additional  housework  has  no  effect  on  
14:387:30095:25:25:90:528:208:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:men’s  perceived  time  stress,  but  it  does  have  a  small  and  statistically  significant  effect  on  
14:388:30204:25:26:90:526:183:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:women’s  stress.    Additional  hours  of  dependent  care  each  week  surprisingly  have  no  impact  on  
14:389:30312:26:25:90:526:157:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:women’s  time  stress,  but  they  do  raise  men’s  perception  of  time  stress.    It  is  worth  noting  (not  
14:390:30427:25:25:90:525:132:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:shown here) that, holding constant weekly hours of dependent care, additional children have little 
14:391:30526:25:0:90:525:107:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:effect on men’s perceived stress.  An additional pre-school child, however, generates a significant 
15:392:30628:0:25:90:524:714:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:increase in a woman’s probability of being stressed for time of 0.09, while each school-age child 
15:393:30726:25:26:90:242:689:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:increases this probability by 0.07. 
15:394:30762:26:25:126:525:663:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:The theory in Section II implied that factors that generate greater efficiency in producing 
15:395:30854:25:25:90:526:638:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:commodities  at  home  are  equivalent  to  increases  in  endowments  of  goods  and  time  and  lead,  
15:396:30959:25:26:90:525:613:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:other things equal, to a reduction in time stress.  The results in Table 3 corroborate this view:  The 
15:397:31062:26:25:90:527:587:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:roughly  60  percent  of  the  sample  that  is  in  excellent  or  very  good  health  is  from  6  to  13  
15:398:31171:25:25:90:529:562:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:percentage  points  less  likely  to  be  stressed  for  time  than  otherwise  comparable  respondents.    
15:399:31279:25:26:90:525:537:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Moving from poor to very good or excellent health has the same effect on perceived time stress as 
15:400:31377:26:25:90:328:511:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:a ten-hour reduction in weekly hours of market work. 
15:401:31430:25:25:90:525:486:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:  To  isolate  the  effects  of  differences  in  income  and  time  use  on  perceived  time  stress  in  
15:402:31537:25:25:90:525:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the  German  data,  we  again  control  for  a  set  of  demographic  and  related  factors.    These  include  
15:403:31649:25:26:90:525:436:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:indicators of residence in the former East Germany, location in a city of at least 100,000 people, 
15:404:31748:26:25:90:525:410:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:presence  of  pre-school  children,  and  a  measure  of  the  number  of  children.  We  capture  potential  
15:405:31858:25:25:90:526:385:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:differences  between  types  of  couples  by  an  indicator  of  whether  the  partners  are  married  and  
15:406:31966:25:26:90:526:360:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:include  measures  of  the  partner’s  hours  of  market  and  homework.    Finally,  since  pressures  on  
15:407:32074:26:25:90:527:334:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:self-employed  workers  may  differ  from  those  on  employees,  an  indicator  of  self-employment  
15:408:32176:25:25:90:192:309:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:status is also included. 
15:409:32201:25:25:90:527:284:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:  As  in  the  Australian  data,  we  capture  perceived  time  stress  in  Table  4  by  estimating  
15:410:32303:25:26:90:525:259:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:probits describing the impacts of these variables on the probability that the person responds that 
15:411:32402:26:25:90:525:233:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:he or she is always or often stressed for time, thus defining between one-third and 40 percent of 
15:412:32500:25:25:90:525:208:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the  partners  as  stressed.    Table  4  lists  the  estimated  derivatives  of  the  probit  functions  and  their  
15:413:32618:25:26:90:526:183:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:standard  errors  for  individuals  in  couples  with  at  least  one  working  partner,  and  for  those  in  
15:414:32729:26:25:90:525:157:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:couples with two working partners. Additional household income generates significant increases 
15:415:32824:25:25:90:526:132:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:in  the  time  stress  perceived  by  men  and  women,  both  in  the  sample  of  all  working  couples  and  
15:416:32935:25:0:90:212:107:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:among two-earner couples. 
16:417:32963:0:25:90:527:714:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:  Hours  of  work  have  significant  and  essentially  identical  positive  effects  on  perceived  
16:418:33064:25:26:90:526:689:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:time  stress  for  both  sexes.    As  in  Australia,  spreading  work  over  additional  days  reduces  time  
16:419:33175:26:25:90:526:663:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:stress,  but  here  some  of  the  estimates  are  statistically  significant.    Among  men  additional  time  
16:420:33287:25:25:90:532:638:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:spent   in   dependent   care   and   cleaning-cooking-shopping   has   little   effect   on   time   stress.      
16:421:33402:25:26:90:526:613:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:(Remember  from  Table  2  that  German  men  devote  almost  no  time  to  these  activities.)    Among  
16:422:33508:26:25:90:526:587:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:women,  however,  additional  time  in  dependent  care  has  a  substantial  and  significant  positive  
16:423:33614:25:25:90:525:562:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:impact on time stress. While the impacts of additional time spent cleaning-cooking-shopping are 
16:424:33710:25:26:90:508:537:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:not statistically significant, they are positive (and larger for women in two-earner households). 
16:425:33808:26:25:126:528:511:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Being  in  at  least  good  (self-reported)  health  has  very  large  negative  effects  on  the  
16:426:33907:25:25:90:522:486:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:probability  of  being  stressed  for  time.    Moving  from  less  than  satisfactory  to  satisfactory  self-
16:427:34018:25:25:90:525:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:assessed  health  has  the  same  impact  on  perceived  stress  as  at  least  a  ten-hour  decline  in  weekly  
16:428:34132:25:26:90:528:436:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:work  hours.  Although  the  variable  is  not  quite  comparable  to  that  defined  for  Australia,  
16:429:34235:26:25:90:521:410:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:redefining it to make it as closely comparable as is possible does not alter the conclusion that self-
16:430:34337:25:25:89:448:385:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:reported good health is very strongly negatively related to perceived time stress.  
16:431:34421:25:26:89:267:360:121:g_d0_f5:121:g_d0_f5: B.  Korea, 1999, Canada, 1998 
16:432:34451:26:25:89:525:334:121:g_d0_f5:121:g_d0_f3: The distributions of the four possible responses to the question, “How often do you feel 
16:433:34540:25:25:89:525:309:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:rushed or pressed for time?” in the Korean Time Use Survey of 1999 are shown in Table 5.  For 
16:434:34634:25:25:89:525:284:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Canada  we  combine  responses  indicating  time  stress  once  a  week  and  once  a  month,  and  those  
16:435:34741:25:26:89:527:259:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:indicating  stress  less  than  once  a  month  or  never,  since  those  individual  responses  were  
16:436:34844:26:25:89:524:233:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:uncommon.  In the KTUS only those couples that filled out time diaries for two days are included 
16:437:34941:25:25:89:526:208:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:in  the  samples  used  here,  and  only  those  for  whom  both  days  were  weekdays.    The  paucity  of  
16:438:35050:25:26:89:524:183:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:respondents in the Canadian GSS and the existence of time diaries for only one day require us to 
16:439:35147:26:25:89:429:157:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:use all respondents, including those who kept time diaries for weekend days. 
16:440:35224:25:25:126:525:132:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Among couples with at least one worker perceived time stress is greater among men than 
16:441:35311:25:26:89:525:107:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:among women in the Korean data.  Even in this group for Canada we find the same result as in 
16:442:35404:26:0:89:524:81:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Table 1 for Australia and Germany—greater time stress among women.  The unusual finding in 
17:443:35497:0:25:90:525:714:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Korea probably stems from the lower female participation rate than in the West, so that a larger 
17:444:35594:25:26:90:526:689:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:fraction  of  couples  in  the  upper  left  part  of  Table  5  contains  only  male  workers.    When  we  
17:445:35703:26:25:90:527:663:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:examine  responses  of  two-earner  couples,  shown  in  the  bottom  of  Table  5,  we  find  for  both  
17:446:35809:25:25:90:525:638:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:countries that time stress is far greater among working wives than among their working husbands, 
17:447:35906:25:26:90:527:613:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:with  the  differences  being  even  larger  than  those  found  in  Australia  and  Germany.    As  in  
17:448:36011:26:25:90:529:587:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Australia   and   Germany,   the   responses   of   the   Korean   spouses   are   not   independent:      A   
17:449:36122:25:25:90:525:562:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:husband/wife  whose  spouse  says  she/he  is  more  stressed  for  time  is  more  likely  to  respond  that  
17:450:36233:25:26:90:209:537:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:he/she is stressed for time. 
17:451:36262:26:25:90:524:511:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3: The main reason for using the KTUS and the Canadian GSS is that, unlike the other data 
17:452:36349:25:25:90:525:486:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:sets used here, they contain information from time diaries.  This departure allows us to examine 
17:453:36446:25:25:90:524:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:whether the measurement error inherent in the CPS-type recall data on work hours used in Part A 
17:454:36542:25:26:90:526:436:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:of  this  Section  might  be  biasing  the  estimated  impacts  of  market  and  other  work  hours  toward  
17:455:36651:26:25:90:526:410:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:zero  and  thus  overstating  the  relative  importance  of  full-income  differences  in  affecting  time  
17:456:36759:25:25:90:526:385:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:stress.    To  reduce  measurement  errors  still  further,  in  the  Korean  data  we  average  the  time-use  
17:457:36871:25:26:90:267:360:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:variables over the two weekday diaries. 
17:458:36911:26:25:90:525:334:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3: Table 6 presents the means and standard deviations of the time-diary measures of market 
17:459:36999:25:25:90:526:309:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:work,  household  care  and  family  care  for  Korea  and  Canada,  along  with  statistics  on  CPS-type  
17:460:37107:25:25:90:525:284:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:(recall) measures of weekly work hours. (Where the definitions differ between the countries, the 
17:461:37204:25:26:90:525:259:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Canadian  definition  is  in  parentheses.)    For  Korea  the  diary  measures  are  daily  hours,  while  for  
17:462:37317:26:25:89:525:233:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Canada,  where  diaries  for  all  7  days  are  used,  we  multiply  daily  hours  by  7.9    Korean  men  do  
17:463:37429:25:25:90:521:208:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:remarkably little at home, much less even than their Australian or German counterparts.  In two-
17:464:37525:25:26:90:527:183:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:worker  households  on  a  typical  workday  the  wife  spends  close  to  two  more  hours  than  her  
17:465:37629:26:62:90:527:157:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:husband  in  market  work,  household  work  and  family  care.    In  Canada  the  time  diaries  also  
17:466:37734:62:7:90:237:95:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:                                                           
17:467:37792:7:16:90:524:88:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:9Rather than use hours of work on the weekend, for the 2/7 of the sample that is surveyed on the weekend 
17:468:37897:16:12:90:428:72:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:we calculate their daily hours of market work as 1/5 of their reported weekly hours. 
17:469:37982:12:0:522:527:60:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:  
18:470:37986:0:25:90:525:714:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:indicate that women do more work than men.  The differences, roughly two hours per week, are 
18:471:38079:25:26:90:428:689:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:remarkably similar to the respondents’ recollections in the Australian data.10 
18:472:38157:26:25:89:527:663:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:  For  Korea  the  bottom  rows  of  each  half  of  Table  6  describe  the  family’s  imputed  
18:473:38254:25:25:89:525:638:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:earnings, imputations that are necessitated by the absence of any earnings or income information 
18:474:38351:25:26:89:525:613:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:in  the  KTUS.    We  took  a  10-percent  random  sub-sample  of  the  1999  Korean  Wage  Structure  
18:475:38454:26:25:89:527:587:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Survey  to  estimate  standard  log-earnings  regressions  separately  by  sex  for  working  married  
18:476:38557:25:25:89:527:562:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:persons,  including  all  the  variables  that  might  affect  wages  and  that  are  common  to  both  
18:477:38661:25:26:89:525:537:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:surveys.11    Using  the  parameter  estimates,  we  imputed  monthly  earnings  for  each  respondent  in  
18:478:38769:26:25:90:527:511:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the  KTUS,  summed  each  spouse’s  imputed  earnings  and  multiplied  by  12  to  obtain  imputed  
18:479:38870:25:25:90:526:486:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:annual  earnings.    The  Canadian  GSS  does  not  provide  earnings  data  but,  like  the  Australian  
18:480:38976:25:25:90:332:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:HILDA, we use information on each spouse’s income. 
18:481:39027:25:26:126:525:436:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:For Korea the totals, roughly 18 and 24 million won (US$15,000 and US$20,000), accord 
18:482:39113:26:25:90:526:410:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:well  with  information  on  household  incomes.12    The  small  standard  deviations,  induced  by  our  
18:483:39220:25:25:90:525:385:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:using  imputations,  underscore  the  point  that  the  absence  of  income  or  earnings  measures  means  
18:484:39328:25:26:90:524:360:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:that we are necessarily introducing errors into the income variables used to predict perceived time 
18:485:39428:26:25:90:525:334:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:stress. Exactly opposite the case of the measures of time use, the income measures contain more 
18:486:39524:25:30:90:527:309:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:measurement  error  than  those  in  the  previous  Part,  so  that  for  Korea  we  will  understate  the  
18:487:39632:30:7:90:237:279:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:                                                           
18:488:39690:7:16:90:525:272:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:10A major reason for using these data sets was to compare the results of basing the estimates on time-diary 
18:489:39798:16:12:89:524:256:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:reports of hours as opposed to the recall data that were available for Australia and Germany.  We know that 
18:490:39906:12:11:89:526:244:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:Koreans  do  not  work  in  the  market  on  Sundays,  and  Saturday  workdays  are  typically  not  so  long  as  
18:491:40021:11:12:89:525:233:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:weekday schedules.  An upper bound for actual weekly work hours in Korea is thus six times average daily 
18:492:40126:12:11:89:525:221:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:hours,  roughly  50  for  men  and  42  for  working  women.    These  estimates  are  far  below  the  CPS-type  
18:493:40240:11:12:89:525:210:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:answers  about  weekly  hours  worked  that  are  included  in  the  data  set  and  whose  means  are  shown  in  the  
18:494:40360:12:11:89:525:198:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:second rows of the left half of Table 6.  For Canada the comparisons are direct, and there too the recall data 
18:495:40471:11:12:89:525:187:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:indicate  far  longer  hours  of  market  work  than  the  diary  data.    These  shortfalls  reproduce  within  data  sets

18:500:40834:16:11:90:526:129:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:includes  quadratics  in  monthly  work  hours  and  age,  and  vectors  of  indicators  of  educational  attainment,

19:509:41548:26:25:90:439:663:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:to the average family income of such households in the 1995 Census, $67,894. 
19:510:41625:25:25:126:525:638:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Table 7 shows the results of estimating probits describing the chance that a respondent in 
19:511:41716:25:26:90:526:613:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the  KTUS  states  that  he/she  is  always  under  time  pressure  (between  26  and  42  percent  of  the  
19:512:41825:26:25:90:525:587:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:samples).    The  estimates  are  presented  in  exactly  the  same  form  as  those  in  Tables  3  and  4.    In  
19:513:41941:25:25:90:525:562:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:these equations we also include indicators of location and metropolitan residence, of the presence

19:515:42148:26:25:90:527:511:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:over  and  measures  of  the  spouse’s  time  use.    The  essential  results  are  remarkably  similar  
19:516:42253:25:25:90:526:486:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:qualitatively  to  those  in  the  first  Part  of  this  section.    Additional  (diary)  hours  of  market  work  
19:517:42369:25:25:90:527:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:have  highly  significant  positive  effects  on  perceived  time  stress.    Household  work  also  has  
19:518:42475:25:26:90:526:436:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:significantly  positive  effects  on  time  stress,  but  additional  time  spent  in  family  care  affects  time  
19:519:42591:26:25:90:494:410:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:stress significantly among women only if we include both one- and two-earner households. 
19:520:42680:25:25:90:526:385:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:  Holding  market  and  non-market  work  hours  constant,  individuals  with  higher  (imputed)  
19:521:42778:25:26:90:527:360:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:household  earnings  are  more  likely  to  respond  that  they  are  always  stressed  for  time.    These  
19:522:42887:26:25:90:527:334:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:results  replicate  perfectly  the  findings  for  Australia  and  Germany—higher  full  income,  like  
19:523:42991:25:25:90:438:309:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:additional market and household work, leads to greater perceived time stress.   
19:524:43071:25:25:90:528:284:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:  The  coefficient  estimates  in  Table  8  are  from  probits  on  the  Canadian  GSS  data  
19:525:43166:25:26:90:525:259:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:indicating whether the respondent states that he/she is always rushed (between 52 and 59 percent 
19:526:43263:26:25:90:525:233:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:of  the  respondents).    The  samples  are  substantially  smaller  than  those  on  which  the  statistics  in  
19:527:43377:25:25:90:524:208:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Tables 5 and 6 are based, because the health measure and information on the spouse’s hours are 
19:528:43472:25:26:90:525:183:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:missing for many respondents.  Despite the fairly small samples, however, the results on hours of 
19:529:43570:26:25:90:525:157:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:market  work  look  very  much  like  those  we  have  generated  for  the  other  countries,  with  highly  
19:530:43679:25:25:90:522:132:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:significant  positive  effects  on  the  probability  of  being  stressed.    Additional  time  spent  on  non-
19:531:43790:25:26:90:525:107:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:market  work  activities  increases  the  probability  that  the  respondents  claim  to  be  rushed,  but  the  
19:532:43903:26:0:90:489:81:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:effects are much less on a per-hour basis than those of additional hours of market work.     
20:533:43998:0:25:90:526:714:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:  Holding  hours  of  market  and  non-market  work  constant,  for  Canada  too  we  find  that  
20:534:44096:25:26:90:528:689:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:additional  income  increases  household  members’  feeling  of  being  rushed.    The  effects  are  
20:535:44198:26:25:90:526:663:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:positive  in  all  four  samples,  significantly  so  for  men.    As  the  discussion  in  Section  II  predicted,  
20:536:44315:25:25:90:525:638:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:and as in Part A, those respondents whose self-assessed health is better (about 40 percent of the 
20:537:44413:25:26:89:508:613:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:samples) are less likely to state that they are rushed, with the effects being substantial for men. 
20:538:44513:26:25:126:525:587:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:The data for these two countries allow us to examine whether using time-diary instead of 
20:539:44602:25:25:90:521:562:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:recall  data  affects  the  results.    For  Korea  we  re-estimated  the  equations  by  replacing  the  time-
20:540:44713:25:26:90:526:537:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:diary  measures  of  market  work  with  the  CPS-type  responses  (since  recall  data  on  non-market  
20:541:44818:26:25:90:527:511:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:work  times  were  not  available).    As  expected,  the  parameter  estimates  were  not  quite  so  
20:542:44921:25:25:90:524:486:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:significantly nonzero, and their implied impacts on time stress were slightly lower.  The Canadian 
20:543:45020:25:25:90:525:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:GSS contains recall data on all non-market work (similar to the HILDA and the SOEP), and we 
20:544:45112:25:26:90:525:436:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:used  recall  measures  for  all  three  time-use  variables.    The  estimates  using  these  recall  measures  
20:545:45225:26:25:90:525:410:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:typically implied larger effects of market work hours on time stress, but the differences were not 
20:546:45324:25:25:90:525:385:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:great.  The estimated coefficients on the income/earnings measures were hardly affected in either 
20:547:45422:25:26:90:526:360:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:country.  Overall these additional results suggest that using CPS-type measures of hours instead 
20:548:45519:26:25:90:417:334:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:of diary measures does not induce large biases in the parameter estimates.

20:550:45626:25:25:90:526:284:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:  The  American  QAL  allowed  only  three  possible  responses  to  the  question  about  time  
20:551:45723:25:26:90:525:259:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:pressure.  Moreover, having fewer respondents, these surveys are less likely to generate the kind 
20:552:45821:26:25:90:525:233:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:of  convincing  results  shown  above  and  should  thus  be  viewed  as  providing  weaker  tests  of  the  
20:553:45930:25:25:90:526:208:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:theory,  and  somewhat  less  information  on  time  stress.    Nonetheless,  because  they  are  the  only  
20:554:46039:25:26:89:527:183:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:large-scale data sets available to analyze this issue for the U.S., it is worth using the information.  
20:555:46143:26:62:89:450:157:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Because the QAL samples are fairly small, we pool the data for 1971 and 1978.13

20:557:46280:7:16:90:525:88:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:13The  1978  QAL  contained  a  longitudinal  component  that  included  some  of  the  respondents  in  the  1971  
20:558:46396:16:12:90:432:72:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:QAL.  We include each such respondent once here, using his/her data for 1978 only.

21:560:46481:0:25:90:525:714:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:  The  distributions  of  perceived  time  stress  across  the  three  possible  responses  are  shown  
21:561:46585:25:26:89:525:689:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:in Table 9.  Even in the sample of people in couples with one or two working spouses, in most of 
21:562:46682:26:25:89:524:663:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:which it was the wife who was not working, women are less likely than men to state that they are 
21:563:46779:25:25:89:527:638:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:sometimes  rushed  or  almost  never  rushed.    When  both  spouses  work  in  the  labor  market,  a  
21:564:46883:25:26:90:526:613:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:substantially  higher  fraction  of  the  women  indicated  that  they  are  always  rushed  for  time,  and  a  
21:565:46996:26:25:90:526:587:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:much  smaller  fraction  indicated  that  they  are  almost  never  rushed.    As  in  the  other  samples,  
21:566:47105:25:25:90:458:562:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:women, especially wives who work in the labor market, are more stressed for time. 
21:567:47187:25:26:90:524:537:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3: Unlike in the previous Parts, in Table 10 we present ordered probits describing the effects 
21:568:47279:26:25:90:525:511:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:of hours of market work, health (no health problems) and annual household income on perceived 
21:569:47373:25:25:90:525:486:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:time  stress.  We  use  ordered  probits  because  the  large  majority  of  respondents  are  in  the  middle  
21:570:47485:25:25:89:525:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:category (rushed sometimes) and because the number of possible categories is small.  We include 
21:571:47581:25:26:90:525:436:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:indicators for geography (location in the South and in an SMSA), for whether the person or one 
21:572:47676:26:25:90:525:410:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:of his/her parents is an immigrant, for self-employment status and for the presence of a preschool 
21:573:47775:25:25:90:428:385:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:child, and a continuous measure of the number of children in the household. 
21:574:47851:25:26:90:525:360:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:  Despite  the  small  samples  and  the  lack  of  detailed  data  on  spouses,  the  results  are  quite  
21:575:47959:26:25:89:527:334:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:similar  to  those  in  the  previous  Parts.    Additional  hours  of  market  work  significantly  shift  
21:576:48067:25:25:89:527:309:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:respondents  to  categories  indicating  more  time  stress.    As  in  the  other  samples  additional  
21:577:48172:25:25:89:524:284:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:household income generates additional perceived time stress.  In both samples the positive effects 
21:578:48271:25:26:89:524:259:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:are statistically significant at least at some low level of confidence.  The health measure does not 
21:579:48372:26:25:89:525:233:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:consistently  produce  the  expected  negative  impact  on  perceived  time  stress  (although  the  only  
21:580:48479:25:25:89:278:208:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:statistically significant effect is negative).

21:582:48581:26:25:126:524:157:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:We have restricted ourselves to specifications that allow the greatest commonality across 
21:583:48671:25:25:89:526:132:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the  many  data  sets  we  have  used  in  order  to  test  the  central  and  surprising  prediction  of  the  
21:584:48783:25:26:89:525:107:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:economic  model—that,  other  things  equal,  people  with  higher  full  incomes  will  feel  more  time  
21:585:48890:26:0:89:526:81:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:stress.    A  large  variety  of  alternative  specifications  suggest  themselves,  and  here  we  examine  
22:586:49001:0:25:90:525:714:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:these  on  the  data  sets  that  allow  the  testing  (in  most  cases  the  HILDA  and  the  SOEP,  the  most  
22:587:49114:25:26:90:271:689:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:extensive of the data sets we have used). 
22:588:49156:26:25:126:525:663:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Perhaps the simplest and potentially most convincing check comes from a unique aspect 
22:589:49242:25:25:90:525:638:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:of  the  German  data:    In  addition  to  the  regular  sample,  a  special  large  sample  of  high-income  
22:590:49353:25:26:90:525:613:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:households  (97th  percentile  or  above)  was  drawn.    Among  married  nonworking  (in  the  market)  
22:591:49458:26:25:89:525:587:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:women  with  working  husbands  in  the  high-income  sample,  18.8  percent  felt  stressed  always  or  
22:592:49564:25:25:89:525:562:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:often, while only 14.2 percent of the married nonworking women with working husbands in the 
22:593:49656:25:26:89:525:537:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:random  sample  did.    Obversely,  only  39.4  percent  of  the  rich  nonworking  wives  felt  never  or  
22:594:49764:26:25:89:528:511:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:almost  never  stressed,  while  49.4  percent  of  average  nonworking  wives  did.    This  stark  
22:595:49865:25:25:89:527:486:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:comparison  suggests  the  role  of  additional  household  income  in  increasing  the  Lagrangean  
22:596:49966:25:25:89:290:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:multiplier in the household’s time constraint. 
22:597:50013:25:26:125:527:436:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:While  we  have  combined  the  earnings/income  measures  for  spouses  into  household  
22:598:50103:26:25:90:528:410:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:earnings/income, the model in Section II suggested that their effects might be expected to differ.  
22:599:50203:25:25:90:529:385:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:We   thus   re-specify   the   probits   for   Australia  and  Germany  to  separate  out  the  partners’  
22:600:50310:25:26:90:526:360:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:earnings/incomes.    In  none  of  the  eight  probits  can  we  reject  the  hypothesis  that  the  effect  of  
22:601:50423:26:25:90:525:334:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:one’s spouse’s full income on one’s perceived time stress is the same as the effect of one’s own 
22:602:50520:25:25:90:527:309:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:full  income.    Implicitly,  at  least  in  terms  of  the  time  stress  that  is  generated  by  household  
22:603:50631:25:25:90:345:284:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:production, an income-pooling model cannot be rejected. 
22:604:50687:25:26:126:525:259:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Among the potential misspecifications of the estimating equations are several that would 
22:605:50776:26:25:90:526:233:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:arise  outside  an  economic  model.    Perhaps  most  important,  what  if  time  stress  is  not  caused  by  
22:606:50888:25:25:90:528:208:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the  rush  to  spend  higher  incomes  in  the  same  amount  of  time,  but  is  instead  linked  to  
22:607:50991:25:26:90:526:183:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:occupation—that  high-pressure  occupations  generate  more  time  stress?    For  Australia  and  the  
22:608:51095:26:25:90:524:157:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:United States we added vectors of one-digit occupational indicators to the estimating equations to 
22:609:51194:25:25:90:526:132:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:examine  this  hypothesis.    In  neither  country  can  we  reject  the  hypothesis  that  this  vector  as  a  
22:610:51307:25:26:90:526:107:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:whole  is  zero,  and  including  it  reduces  only  slightly  the  impacts  of  the  measures  of  household  
22:611:51418:26:0:90:526:81:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:income/earnings  on  perceived  time  stress.    This  re-specification  is  an  especially  stringent  test  of  
23:612:51534:0:25:90:532:714:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the    underlying    hypothesis,    as    the    occupational    indicators    are    related    to    household    
23:613:51650:25:26:90:252:689:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:income/earnings in both countries.14 
23:614:51686:26:25:126:524:663:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Time stress may diminish even for the same hours of market work as individuals become 
23:615:51772:25:25:90:524:638:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:more accustomed to their workplaces and their jobs.  To examine this possibility (which does not 
23:616:51869:25:26:90:525:613:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:stem from the model), we add measures of job tenure to the probits for two-earner households in 
23:617:51965:26:25:90:524:587:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Australia and Germany.  Neither linear nor quadratic versions of this variable have any impact on 
23:618:52063:25:25:90:525:562:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:perceived time stress, and their inclusion does not alter our inferences about the role of household 
23:619:52164:25:26:90:529:537:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:income/earnings.    A  related  argument,  that  perceived  time  stress  is  a  biological  outcome  
23:620:52266:26:25:90:526:511:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:stemming  from  aging,  is  refuted:  Using  the  same  data  sets,  linear  and  quadratic  forms  in  the  
23:621:52375:25:25:90:525:486:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:respondent’s age had no significant impacts on the probability of being stressed for time and did 
23:622:52473:25:25:90:401:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:not qualitatively affect our inferences about the effects of full income. 
23:623:52547:25:26:90:531:436:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:   While   a   measure   of   health—essentially   proxying   the   efficiency   of   household   
23:624:52645:26:25:90:525:410:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:production—is suggested by our model, those we have used have two unavoidable problems:  1) 
23:625:52737:25:25:90:524:385:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:They are inherently subjective, meaning that we are relating a subjective measure (perceived time 
23:626:52835:25:26:90:525:360:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:stress) to another subjective measure (self-reported health)15; 2) They are based on current health, 
23:627:52936:26:25:89:524:334:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:not long-term efficiency in the household.  The former concern cannot be circumvented, but the 
23:628:53031:25:25:89:525:309:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:positive correlation between good health and income suggests that any bias that it may induce in 
23:629:53128:25:25:89:525:284:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the estimated parameters of the crucial income/earnings variables is negative.  In re-estimates of 
23:630:53227:25:26:89:521:259:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the basic model for all countries for which we had health measures this is exactly what we find—
23:631:53323:26:25:89:528:233:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:excluding  measures  of  health  increases  the  estimated impacts of income/earnings on time stress.  
23:632:53426:25:25:89:526:208:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Finally,  if  in  the  longitudinal  SOEP  we  use  last  year’s  perceived  health  instead  of  its  current  
23:633:53538:25:31:89:498:183:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:value, again we find that the estimated effects of household earnings on time stress increase. 
23:634:53633:31:7:90:237:152:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:                                                           
23:635:53691:7:16:90:525:145:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:14We  also  modified  the  model  to  include  quadratics  in  own  hours  of  market  work.    While  the  quadratic  
23:636:53810:16:11:90:521:129:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:terms were sometimes significant statistically, their signs were not uniform across the equations, and the re-
23:637:53920:11:12:90:448:118:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:specifications did not alter our conclusions about the role of household income/earnings. 
23:638:54010:12:7:522:527:106:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:  
23:639:54012:7:16:90:524:99:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:15Some evidence (Butler et al, 1987) suggests that at least for workers objective measures are very highly 
23:640:54119:16:11:90:236:83:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:correlated with self-reported health. 
23:641:54157:11:12:90:93:72:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3: 
23:642:54157:12:0:522:527:60:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:  
24:643:54161:0:25:126:525:714:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Although it is difficult to construct a scenario by which simultaneity between time stress 
24:644:54252:25:26:89:525:689:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:and full income might arise, it is worth trying, within the limits of the available data, to construct 
24:645:54355:26:25:89:525:663:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:an  instrument  for  current  full  income.    The  only  sensible  possibility  is  provided  by  the  SOEP,  
24:646:54466:25:25:89:525:638:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:whose 2001 wave contains each household’s gross annual pay.  We used Year 2001 earnings to 
24:647:54557:25:26:89:525:613:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:re-estimate the probits over all couples that responded to the 2001 and 2002 surveys.  Compared 
24:648:54653:26:25:89:525:587:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:to  the  same  equations  estimated  over  these  (reduced)  samples,  but  with  Year  2002  earnings,  the  
24:649:54763:25:25:89:526:562:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:equations  described  differences  in  time  stress  better:    In  all  cases  the  coefficients  on  household  
24:650:54877:25:26:89:527:537:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:pay  in  Year  2001  exceeded  the  corresponding  coefficient  in  Table  4  (and  also  in  untabled  
24:651:54981:26:25:89:525:511:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:equations  on  these  same  reduced  samples),  and  the  coefficients  were  generally  more  significant  
24:652:55089:25:25:89:526:486:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:statistically  than  those  presented  in  Table  4.    The  estimates  indicate  that  at  least  one  possible,  
24:653:55204:25:25:89:517:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:although seemingly not very plausible concern about simultaneity is not a problem in these data. 
24:654:55301:25:26:89:527:436:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:  The  estimates  exclude  one  possibly  stressful  activity—commuting  time—that  may  be  
24:655:55394:26:25:89:525:410:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:correlated with earnings.  To examine whether this exclusion affects our results, we re-specified 
24:656:55492:25:25:89:526:385:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the  basic  equations  for  Australia  and  Korea,  for  which  data  on  hours  spent  commuting  were  
24:657:55597:25:26:89:524:360:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:available.  For Australia commuting time had positive but insignificant effects on time stress and 
24:658:55696:26:25:89:528:334:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:no  qualitative  impact  on  the  estimated  effects  of  household  income.  In  Korea  increased  
24:659:55796:25:25:89:527:309:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:commuting  time  did  raise  time  stress  significantly,  but  there  too  it  had  no  effects  on  our  
24:660:55903:25:25:89:302:284:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:inferences about the role of additional earnings. 
24:661:55953:25:26:89:525:259:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:  Except  for  the  United  States  the  estimates  are  presented  for  simple  binary  definitions  of  
24:662:56059:26:25:89:526:233:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:stress  in  order  to  aid  in  interpreting  the  results.    We  re-estimated  the  equations  using  ordered  
24:663:56172:25:25:89:525:208:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:probits describing all possible responses to the questions on time stress in each survey.  In nearly 
24:664:56273:25:26:89:526:183:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:all  cases  the  coefficients  on  household  incomes  in  the  ordered  probits  were  more  significant  
24:665:56380:26:25:89:526:157:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:statistically  than  those  in  the  simple  probits.    The  estimates  we  present  in  Parts  A  and  B  thus  
24:666:56494:25:25:89:519:132:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:understate the statistical significance of the effects of differences in household incomes/earnings. 
24:667:56595:25:26:126:527:107:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:In  the  estimation  for  Australia,  Germany  and  Korea  we  have  treated  the  equations  
24:668:56689:26:0:89:525:81:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:describing partners’ perceived time stress as independent, despite the evidence in Tables 1 and 5 
25:669:56789:0:25:90:525:714:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:that they are not.  Additional statistical efficiency can be gained if instead we view each partner’s 
25:670:56891:25:26:90:525:689:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:perceptions as jointly determined and estimate each of the pairs of equations in Tables 3, 4 and 7 
25:671:56990:26:25:90:525:663:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:jointly as a bivariate probit.  The re-estimates never generate changes in the parameter estimates 
25:672:57089:25:25:90:525:638:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:of more than one in the second significant digit, nor do they alter the statistical significance of the 
25:673:57193:25:26:90:525:613:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:parameter estimates.  They do, however, allow us to examine the cross-partner correlations in the 
25:674:57291:26:25:90:526:587:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:errors.    The  estimated  correlation  coefficients  (and  their  t-statistics)  are  0.211  (5.43)  and  0.193  
25:675:57405:25:25:90:527:562:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:(4.07)  in  Australia,  0.307  (9.52)  and  0.357  (8.89)  in  Germany,  and  0.424  (13.16)  and  0.513  
25:676:57511:25:26:90:524:537:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:(12.76) in Korea.  They indicate the clear presence of unobservable characteristics that stress both 
25:677:57612:26:25:90:293:511:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:partners simultaneously in all three countries. 
25:678:57660:25:25:90:524:486:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3: One might argue that all we have shown is that adults in high-income families complain a 
25:679:57749:25:25:90:526:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:lot—higher  income  may  lead  people  to  complain  about  everything  or  may  be  correlated  with  
25:680:57852:25:26:90:526:436:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:complaints  in  a  variety  of  areas.    If  that  is  true,  higher-income  people  will  be  more  likely  to  
25:681:57966:26:25:90:524:410:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:complain about their incomes than other people, other things equal.  Contrariwise, in the theory in 
25:682:58066:25:25:90:526:385:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Section  II  the  Lagrangean  multiplier  μ  on  the  income  constraint  becomes  less  binding  as  full  
25:683:58174:25:26:90:524:360:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:incomes rise.  Following the same argument that linked predictions about impacts on λ to changes 
25:684:58271:26:25:90:526:334:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:in  incomes,  we  can  link  increases  in  incomes  to  effects  on  μ  and  infer  that  they  will  reduce  
25:685:58382:25:25:90:526:309:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:people’s  income  stress.    People  in  households  with  high  incomes  will  perceive  more  time  stress  
25:686:58492:25:25:90:381:284:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:but should be less likely to feel that their incomes are inadequate. 
25:687:58561:25:26:90:526:259:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:  The  Australian  and  German  surveys  ask  respondents,  “How  satisfied  are  you  with  your  
25:688:58660:26:25:90:525:233:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:financial situation [household income];” the Canadian GSS asks, “Please rate your feelings about 
25:689:58757:25:25:90:525:208:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:your  finances.”  We  estimated  ordered  probits  describing  satisfaction  with  income,  including  the  
25:690:58865:25:26:90:527:183:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:same  regressors  as  in  Tables  3,  4  and  8.    They  make  it  clear  that  respondents  with  higher  
25:691:58973:26:25:90:524:157:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:household incomes are more satisfied with their incomes than other people.  Not surprisingly too, 
25:692:59071:25:25:90:527:132:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:members  of  the  higher-income  households  exhibit  greater  satisfaction  with  life,  other  things  
25:693:59176:25:26:90:525:107:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:equal.  A higher full income increases our proxy for the shadow value of time, reduces the proxy 
25:694:59273:26:0:90:478:81:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:for the shadow value of goods, and increases a proxy for the level of the value function. 
26:695:59365:0:25:90:257:714:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f8:V.  Crunch or Kvetch, and Whose? 
26:696:59397:25:26:90:526:689:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:  The  results  make  it  clear  that  additional  hours  of  market  work  increase  perceived  time  
26:697:59500:26:25:90:525:663:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:stress.  They also demonstrate the fundamental economic point that, holding hours of market and 
26:698:59596:25:25:90:525:638:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:household work constant, additional income also leads to greater time stress.  People do perceive 
26:699:59694:25:26:90:525:613:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:themselves as being in a time crunch, but they are kvetching because they have too much money 
26:700:59788:26:25:90:525:587:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:given the time that they have chosen to leave over from market and household work to combine 
26:701:59881:25:25:90:527:562:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:with  their  incomes.    This  kvetching  does  not  mean  that  people  could  enhance  their  utility  by  
26:702:59990:25:26:90:526:537:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:giving  up  income:    We  assume  that  we  are  dealing  with  people  who  are  maximizing  utility  but  
26:703:60099:26:25:90:426:511:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:who are simply unhappy about the exogenous limits on their available time. 
26:704:60174:25:25:90:526:486:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:  The  more  interesting  question  is  the  relative  importance  of  the  effects  of  limits  on  time  
26:705:60281:25:25:90:525:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:and increases in income on perceived time stress.  To examine this question in comparable ways 
26:706:60376:25:26:90:524:436:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:across the data sets we use the results in Tables 3, 4, 7, 8 and 10 along with the order statistics of 
26:707:60479:26:25:89:525:410:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:the underlying variables to estimate the impact of increases in market hours and incomes on the 
26:708:60575:25:28:89:339:385:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:probability of stating one is stressed for time.  Consider: 
26:709:60635:28:29:89:221:357:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:(8) ∆YH = - βY∆Y/βH∆H, 
26:710:60658:29:26:89:525:328:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:where  the β are the estimated probit coefficients (ordered probit in the case of the U.S.), and ∆Y 
26:711:60758:26:25:89:526:302:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:and ∆H  are  changes  along  the  quantiles  of  the  distributions  of  household  income/earnings  and  
26:712:60864:25:25:89:524:277:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:hours.    We  present  calculations  for  movements  from  the  25th  to  the  75th  and  the  10th  to  the  90th 
26:713:60978:25:26:89:528:252:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:percentiles  of  the  underlying  variables.    For  all  countries  except  Korea  this  is  straightforward:    
26:714:61092:26:25:89:526:226:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:We  just  use  the  distributions  for  the  particular  samples  used  in  the  estimation.    Because  we  
26:715:61201:25:25:89:525:201:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:imputed  earnings  in  Korea,  we  assume  that  the  earnings  distribution  in  this  sample  exhibits  the  
26:716:61312:25:26:89:525:176:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:same inequality as in the Korean National Survey of Household Income and Expenditures and use 
26:717:61406:26:25:89:524:150:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:our sample means and the parameters of that distribution to simulate the impact of changes across 
26:718:61504:25:30:89:182:125:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:earnings quantiles.16 
26:719:61525:30:7:90:237:95:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:                                                           
26:720:61583:7:16:90:526:88:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:16Quantile  differences  in  earnings  in  Korea  in  the  late  1980s  look  similar  to  those  in  Western  Europe  
26:721:61702:16:12:90:513:72:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:(Topel, 1999); and the survey data on which we base the simulations look very much like those in Topel. 
26:722:61806:12:0:90:93:60:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3: 
27:723:61808:0:25:90:528:714:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:  Table  11  presents  estimates  of  ∆YH  for  each  of  the  four  samples  in  all  five  countries.    
27:724:61915:25:26:90:526:689:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:They  demonstrate  that  increases  along  the  distribution  of  hours  of  market  work  generate  greater  
27:725:62025:26:25:90:524:663:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:increases in perceived time stress than do increases across the same percentiles of the distribution 
27:726:62126:25:25:90:526:638:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:of  household  income/earnings.    Nonetheless,  increases  in  full  income  do  substantially  increase  
27:727:62233:25:26:90:526:613:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:time  stress.      Because  the  definition  of  time  stress  differs  among  the  five  countries,  as  do  the  
27:728:62348:26:25:90:525:587:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:distributions  of  hours  of  work  and  income,  comparisons across the data sets must be considered 
27:729:62450:25:25:90:526:562:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:highly  tentative.  The  greater  relative  importance  of  income  differences  in  North  America,  and  
27:730:62557:25:26:90:528:537:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:particularly  in  the  United  States,  may,  however,  explain  why  the  notion  of  time  crunch  is  
27:731:62662:26:25:90:217:511:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:discussed more widely here. 
27:732:62690:25:25:90:526:486:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3: Although the comparisons in Table 11 implicitly treat increases in hours of work and in 
27:733:62778:25:25:90:525:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:full incomes as exogenous, the former surely are not.  So long as labor supply curves are upward 
27:734:62875:25:26:90:528:436:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:sloping,  even  these  comparisons  mean  that  we  are  understating  the  relative  importance  of  
27:735:62977:26:25:90:525:410:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:increases  in  full  incomes  in  generating  complaints  about  being  stressed  for  time.    In  the  end  we  
27:736:63091:25:25:90:528:385:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:cannot  really  answer  whether  there  is  a  time  crunch  or  whether  the  complaints  are  yuppie  
27:737:63195:25:26:90:524:360:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:kvetching.  We can be sure, however, that at least some of the complaints result from differences 
27:738:63293:26:25:90:313:334:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:across households in their members’ full incomes. 
27:739:63343:25:25:90:524:309:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3: As Tables 1, 5 and 9 showed, among two-earner couples the probability of stating one is 
27:740:63431:25:25:90:525:284:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:time  stressed  is  greater  among  wives.    Taking  the  couples  from  the  three  countries  whose  data  
27:741:63541:25:26:90:527:259:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:describe  both  partners,  we  can  ask  whether  the  sex  difference  arises  from  differences  in  the  
27:742:63649:26:25:90:528:233:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:responses  to  each  spouse’s  characteristics,  or  from  differences  in  the  characteristics  themselves.    
27:743:63762:25:25:90:527:208:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:We  thus  estimate  a  standard  decomposition,  asking  how  the  predicted  mean  fraction  stressed  
27:744:63866:25:26:90:522:183:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:would differ if the males’ outcome were determined the same way as the females’ and vice-versa. 
27:745:63962:26:25:90:527:157:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:  Table  12  presents  this  decomposition  for  each  of  the  three  countries,  with  the  actual  
27:746:64064:25:26:90:525:132:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:fraction stressed shown in italics on the prime diagonals.17  In both Australia and Germany if the 
27:747:64163:26:7:90:237:106:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:                                                           
27:748:64221:7:16:90:525:99:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:17The fractions are not exactly those listed in Tables 2 and 6, because the probits are nonlinear and because 
27:749:64331:16:11:90:526:83:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:for  Australia  the  samples  used  in  the  probits  differed  very  slightly  from  those  for  which  the  means  are  
27:750:64453:11:12:90:132:72:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:tabulated. 
27:751:64464:12:0:522:525:60:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3: 
28:752:64466:0:25:90:526:714:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:wives  had  their  partners’  characteristics  (same  hours  of  market  and  non-market  work,  and  same  
28:753:64574:25:26:90:525:689:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:health) they would express still greater time stress (lower left in each part); if husbands had their 
28:754:64676:26:25:90:525:663:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:wives’ characteristics, they would express less time stress (upper right).  At least in terms of this 
28:755:64778:25:25:89:524:638:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:standard decomposition it appears that women in two-earner Western households are more likely 
28:756:64872:25:26:89:524:613:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:to complain of being stressed for time at a given amount of market and non-market work than are 
28:757:64968:26:25:89:524:587:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:their partners.  This arises partly because in both countries the biggest measurable determinant of 
28:758:65068:25:25:89:526:562:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:time  stress  is  hours  of  market  work,  and  men  work  more  hours  in  the  market;  partly  too  in  
28:759:65176:25:26:89:525:537:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:Australia it stems from a larger intercept in the probit for wives.  The results differ in Korea:  If 
28:760:65278:26:25:89:373:511:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:husbands or wives switched roles, both would be more stressed. 
28:761:65341:25:25:89:525:486:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3: This decomposition in the two Western economies suggests that working wives complain 
28:762:65426:25:25:90:525:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:more about being rushed for time than would working husbands placed in an observably similar 
28:763:65519:25:26:89:526:436:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:situation,  but  interpreting  this  result  requires  care.    While  we  have  included  measures  of  time  
28:764:65630:26:25:89:526:410:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:spent  in  childcare  and  of  the  number  and  ages  of  children,  we  know  (Gronau  and  Hamermesh,  
28:765:65736:25:25:89:524:385:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:2001) that women do more different things during the day and may spend more time coordinating 
28:766:65830:25:26:89:527:360:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:activities.    It  is  also  possible  that  wives  maintain  general  responsibility  for  the  household’s  
28:767:65940:26:25:89:525:334:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:operation  independent  of  the  number  of  children,  their  ages  and  the  time  spent  caring  for  them  
28:768:66051:25:25:89:528:309:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:and the household.  This managerial effect may generate women’s greater feelings of time stress.  
28:769:66149:25:25:89:525:284:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:It is clear from the decomposition, however, that they are not caused by differences in measured 
28:770:66245:25:26:90:158:259:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:characteristics. 
28:771:66262:26:25:90:170:233:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:VI.  Conclusions 
28:772:66279:25:25:126:526:208:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:We  have  proposed  an  economic  theory  that  yields  specific  predictions  about  the  impact  
28:773:66378:25:26:90:525:183:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:of  additional  income  on  individuals’  perceived  time  stress  and  have  tested  the  model  on  a  large  
28:774:66490:26:25:90:525:157:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:variety of data sets covering five developed economies.  The results are qualitatively remarkably 
28:775:66588:25:25:90:525:132:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:consistent  across  countries:    While  additional  market  work  does  generate  additional  time  stress,  
28:776:66698:25:0:90:525:107:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:additional income, holding hours of market and homework fixed, also increases time stress.  The 
29:777:66796:0:25:90:525:714:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:relative sizes of these effects vary, but the impact of higher full incomes seems greater in North 
29:778:66895:25:26:89:201:689:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:America than elsewhere. 
29:779:66919:26:25:126:528:663:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:The  results  suggest  that  at  least  some  of  the  concern  about  a  time  crunch  may  be  
29:780:67016:25:25:89:525:638:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:misplaced:  Complaints about insufficient time come disproportionately from higher full-income 
29:781:67111:25:26:89:525:613:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:families, partly because their members choose to work more hours, partly too because they have 
29:782:67206:26:25:89:528:587:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:higher  incomes  to  spend  during  each  day.    Whether  one  should  be  concerned  about  these  
29:783:67307:25:25:89:525:562:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:complaints or simply view them as yuppie kvetching is a matter of values.  In a world in which 
29:784:67402:25:26:89:525:537:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:sympathy  is  scarce,  however,  it  seems  reasonable  to  argue  that  the  time  crunch—a  more  tightly  
29:785:67511:26:25:89:525:511:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:binding  time  constraint—may  have  a  smaller  claim  on  public  sympathy  than  poverty—a  more  
29:786:67612:25:25:89:235:486:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:tightly binding goods constraint. 
29:787:67646:25:25:126:526:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:The  theoretical  model  and  most  of  the  empirical  analyses  have  yielded  some  surprising  
29:788:67745:25:26:89:527:436:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:results,  and  also  some  mysteries  that  clearly  call  for  additional  research  that  can  profit  from  
29:789:67856:26:25:89:526:410:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:economic  thinking.    Particularly  interesting  among  the  latter  is  the  stark  gender  difference  in  
29:790:67966:25:25:89:529:385:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:perceived   time   stress,   one   that   cannot   be   explained   at   all   by   differences   in   observable   
29:791:68082:25:26:89:525:360:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:characteristics.  The analysis can also be extended to consider satisfaction with income in a more 
29:792:68181:26:25:89:527:334:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:rigorous  way  than  has  been  seen  in  the  burgeoning  economics  and  immense  psychology  
29:793:68277:25:25:89:525:309:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:literatures.  More important, however, thinking about the predictions for subjective psychological 
29:794:68376:25:25:89:525:284:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:outcomes that result from consumers’ utility maximization is something that should be useful in a 
29:795:68474:25:26:89:528:259:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:variety  of  areas  that  are  widely  discussed  in  the  other  social  sciences,  that  concern  many
