2:30:1457:28:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:This paper examines the implications of alternative allowance allocation designs under a federal cap-and-trade
2:31:1567:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:program to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.  We focus on the impacts on industry profits and
2:32:1664:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:overall economic output, employing a dynamic general equilibrium model of the U.S. economy.  The
2:33:1760:14:28:72:489:532:12:Times:12:Times:model’s unique treatment of capital dynamics permits close attention to profit impacts.
2:34:1847:28:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:We find that the effects on profits depend critically on the method of allowance allocation.  Freely
2:35:1947:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:allocating fewer than 15 percent of the emissions allowances generally suffices to prevent profit losses
2:36:2051:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:among the eight industries that, without free allowances or other compensation, would suffer the largest
2:37:2155:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:percentage losses of profit.  Freely allocating 100 percent of the allowances substantially overcompensates
2:38:2262:14:14:72:415:448:12:Times:12:Times:these industries, in many cases causing more than a doubling of profits.
2:39:2334:14:16:72:75:434:12:Times:12:Times: 
2:40:2334:16:14:72:540:418:12:Times:12:Times:These results indicate that profit preservation is consistent with substantial use of auctioning and the
2:41:2438:14:14:72:540:404:12:Times:12:Times:generation of considerable auction revenue.  GDP costs of cap and trade depend critically on how
2:42:2534:14:14:72:540:390:12:Times:12:Times:such revenues are used.  When these revenues are employed to finance cuts in marginal income tax
2:43:2630:14:14:72:540:376:12:Times:12:Times:rates, the resulting GDP costs are about 33 percent lower than when all allowances are freely allocated
2:44:2733:14:14:72:540:362:12:Times:12:Times:and no auction revenue is generated.  On the other hand, when auction proceeds are returned to the
2:45:2831:14:14:72:540:348:12:Times:12:Times:economy in lump-sum fashion (for example, as rebate checks to households), the potential cost-advantages
2:46:2935:14:14:72:216:334:12:Times:12:Times:of auctioning are not realized.
2:47:2966:14:15:72:75:320:12:Times:12:Times: 
2:48:2966:15:14:72:540:305:12:Times:12:Times:Our results are robust to cap-and-trade policies that differ according to policy stringency, the availability
2:49:3075:14:14:72:464:291:12:Times:12:Times:of offsets, and the extent of opportunities for intertemporal trading of allowances.

3:73:3548:14:14:72:75:680:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: 
3:74:3548:14:14:72:75:666:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: 
3:75:3548:14:14:108:521:652:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: Cap and trade has emerged as the centerpiece of discussions of potential federal-level 
3:76:3635:14:13:72:521:638:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:climate-change policies.  Within discussions of alternative cap-and-trade programs, there has 
3:77:3729:13:14:72:517:625:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:been an intense focus on the issue of how emissions allowances might be allocated and how 
3:78:3819:14:14:72:480:611:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the revenues from an allowance auction (if any) might be used.  What fraction of the 
3:79:3904:14:14:72:522:597:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:allowances should be auctioned out, as opposed to given out free?  How much free allocation 
3:80:3996:14:14:72:505:583:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:would be sufficient to preserve profits in various industries?  What are the economy-wide 
3:81:4086:14:13:72:437:569:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:implications of alternative uses of whatever auction revenues are collected? 
3:82:4163:13:14:72:75:556:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: 
3:83:4163:14:14:108:509:542:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: Despite considerable and sometimes contentious debate on these issues, there have 
3:84:4245:14:14:72:471:528:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:been very few quantitative analyses of industry profit impacts and associated GDP 
3:85:4327:14:14:72:515:514:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:consequences under a range of allocation methods.1  One reason is that many of the leading 
3:86:4418:14:13:72:506:500:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:models employed to investigate cap-and-trade policy, while offering many very important 
3:87:4506:13:14:72:509:487:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and policy-relevant insights, are not well suited to examining potential impacts on profits.  
3:88:4600:14:14:72:506:473:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Some of the models2 assume that physical capital is perfectly mobile across the economy, 
3:89:4689:14:14:72:517:459:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:which means that capital can instantly flow out of one sector and into another in response to 
3:90:4783:14:14:72:499:445:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:a change in economic conditions.  This precludes an assessment of the differential profit 
3:91:4873:14:13:72:502:431:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:impacts across industries, since it eliminates the possibility of stranded assets and instead 
3:92:4967:13:14:72:492:418:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:implies that capital in all sectors instantly reachieves the same productivity following a 
3:93:5058:14:14:72:169:404:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:policy intervention. 
3:94:5079:14:14:72:75:390:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: 
3:95:5079:14:14:108:517:376:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: Other models adopt a “putty-clay” approach to capital dynamics, according to which 
3:96:5162:14:13:72:491:362:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:capital is completely immobile once it is installed.3  This approach may exaggerate the 
3:97:5250:13:14:72:497:349:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:problem of stranded assets, since it does not allow for any removal or sale of previously 
3:98:5340:14:14:72:502:335:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:installed capital; capital stocks can only decline through physical depreciation.  Thus, the 
3:99:5433:14:14:72:487:321:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:coal mining industry, for example, would be prevented from significantly reducing its 
3:100:5519:14:14:72:509:307:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:equipment as part of its effort to respond to reduced coal demand resulting from a cap-and-
3:101:5610:14:13:72:152:293:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:trade program.

3:103:5627:14:14:108:508:266:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: The present study offers results from a numerical general equilibrium model of the 
3:104:5710:14:29:71:495:252:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:U.S. economy that is uniquely well-suited to assessing the profit impacts across various

3:106:5852:7:16:72:523:216:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:1 Burtraw and Palmer (2002) investigated the implications of alternative allocation methods for profits and asset 
3:107:5966:16:11:72:524:200:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:values in the HAIKU model, which focuses on the electricity sector.  Bovenberg and Goulder (2001) and Smith, 
3:108:6075:11:12:72:497:189:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Ross, and Montgomery (2002) considered alternative allocations using general equilibrium models with a 
3:109:6178:12:11:72:524:177:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:relatively primitive treatment of cap and trade, as discussed below.  See Ramseur (2008) for a review of existing 
3:110:6292:11:12:72:340:166:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:studies of the impacts of alternative allowance allocation designs.

3:113:6463:16:11:72:314:131:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Details on this model are contained in Goettle et al. (2007).

3:115:6526:7:16:72:498:113:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:3 The ADAGE model and MIT EPPA model adopt a putty-clay treatment for capital, as does the model of 
3:116:6626:16:12:72:506:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Smith, Ross, and Montgomery (2002).  The ADAGE model is described in Ross (2007); the EPPA model is 
3:117:6726:12:11:72:498:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:documented in Paltsev et al. (2005).  See Smith, Ross, and Montgomery (2002) for details on their model.

4:120:6924:13:14:72:483:695:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:derives both investment and disinvestment behavior from optimizing decisions at the 
4:121:7008:14:14:72:512:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:industry level.  Forward-looking managers in each industry make investment decisions that 
4:122:7098:14:14:72:507:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:take into account the adjustment costs associated with both the installation and removal of 
4:123:7190:14:14:72:170:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:productive capital.

4:125:7212:13:14:108:497:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: This approach permits a close examination of how profits are affected in various 
4:126:7293:14:14:72:504:612:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:industries under a range of allocation approaches.  As discussed below, the impacts differ 
4:127:7384:14:14:72:503:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:dramatically depending on the extent to which auctioning or free allocation is employed.  
4:128:7474:14:14:72:493:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:When a firm must purchase all of its allowances (as is the case when all allowances are 
4:129:7562:14:13:72:493:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:auctioned) the potential policy-generated rents (or, equivalently, the value of emissions 
4:130:7652:13:14:72:486:557:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:allowances) are transferred from the firm to the government.  In contrast, when a firm 
4:131:7739:14:14:72:518:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:receives allowances free, it retains these rents.  This makes an enormous difference.  Indeed, 
4:132:7834:14:14:72:504:529:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:it generally determines whether cap and trade causes a reduction (the 100 percent auction 
4:133:7924:14:14:71:444:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:case) or an increase (the 100 percent free allocation case) in the firm’s profit.

4:136:8092:14:14:71:489:474:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of emissions allowance allocation.  We consider policies that vary in terms of both the 
4:137:8180:14:14:71:483:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:reliance on free versus auctioned allowances and the use of revenues from allowance 
4:138:8264:14:14:71:500:446:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:auctioning (if applicable).  These alternatives are evaluated under programs that differ in 
4:139:8356:14:13:71:505:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:terms of policy stringency (the total number of allowance put in circulation), the points of 
4:140:8449:13:14:71:522:419:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:regulation, the availability of offset programs, and the possibility of intertemporal banking or 
4:141:8546:14:14:71:500:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:borrowing of allowances.  These are central considerations in current policy discussions, 
4:142:8636:14:14:71:515:391:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:including the American Clean Energy and Security (ACES) Act passed recently by the U.S. 
4:143:8724:14:14:71:206:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:House of Representatives.   
4:144:8752:14:13:71:74:363:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: 
4:145:8752:13:14:108:515:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: We find that freely allocating a relatively small fraction of the emissions allowances 
4:146:8839:14:14:71:487:336:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:generally suffices to prevent profit losses among the eight industries that, without free 
4:147:8929:14:14:71:519:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:allowances or other compensation, would suffer the largest relative losses of profit.  Under a 
4:148:9024:14:13:71:486:308:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:wide range of cap-and-trade designs, freely allocating less than 15 percent of the total 
4:149:9113:13:14:71:519:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:allowances prevents profit losses to these eight most vulnerable industries.  Freely allocating 
4:150:9209:14:14:71:518:281:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:100 percent of the allowances substantially overcompensates these industries, in many cases 
4:151:9301:14:14:71:299:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:leading to profit increases of over 100 percent. 
4:152:9350:14:14:71:74:253:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: 
4:153:9350:14:13:107:516:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: These results indicate that profit-preservation is consistent with auctioning the lion’s 
4:154:9439:13:14:71:523:226:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:share of allowances.  One important potential use of auction revenues is to finance reductions 
4:155:9534:14:14:71:508:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:in the marginal tax rates of ordinary, distortionary taxes such as income, sales, and payroll 
4:156:9628:14:14:71:488:198:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:taxes.  This is important for the GDP and efficiency costs of cap and trade.  When just 
4:157:9716:14:14:71:485:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:enough free allocation is offered to compensate (but not overly compensate) the most 
4:158:9801:14:13:71:480:170:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:vulnerable industries, considerable auction revenue is generated, yielding significant 
4:159:9888:13:14:71:514:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:opportunities to avoid distortionary taxation.  Our numerical simulations indicate that when

4:161:10034:7:16:72:486:136:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:4 To our knowledge, the only other multisector general equilibrium U.S. economy model incorporating 
4:162:10134:16:12:72:514:120:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:optimizing investment decisions at the industry level is that described in Bovenberg and Goulder (2001).  The 
4:163:10244:12:11:72:507:108:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:present model extends the earlier model by allowing for a more general treatment of the points of regulation 
4:164:10353:11:12:72:513:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:(the earlier model could only impose emissions limits on the coal and oil&gas industries) and by allowing for 
4:165:10463:12:11:72:518:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:various potential cost-saving provisions such as offsets and allowance banking and borrowing.  It also contains 
4:166:10575:11:0:72:265:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:considerably more disaggregation of industries. 
5:167:10624:0:13:72:496:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:these revenues are used to finance cuts in marginal rates of individual income taxes, the 
5:168:10714:13:14:72:524:695:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:resulting GDP costs are about one third lower than in the case where all allowances are freely 
5:169:10809:14:14:72:520:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:allocated and no auction revenue is generated.  In contrast, the cost-advantages of auctioning 
5:170:10904:14:14:72:512:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:disappear when the auction proceeds are returned to the economy in lump-sum fashion (for 
5:171:10993:14:14:71:281:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:example, as rebate checks to households).

5:174:11127:14:14:71:486:612:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:convey how a firm’s profits under a cap-and-trade program are influenced by the way 
5:175:11211:14:14:71:493:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:allowances are allocated, the emissions-reduction opportunities of the firm, the costs of 
5:176:11301:14:14:71:486:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:adjusting physical capital, and demand for the firm’s product.  Section 3 describes the 
5:177:11389:14:13:71:520:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:numerical model used for the quantitative assessments.  Section 4 discusses the model’s data 
5:178:11482:13:14:71:484:557:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and parameters.  Section 5 describes and interprets the model’s results.  Section 6 is a

5:187:11668:14:14:108:513:428:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: The nature of allowance allocation can make a huge difference to the distribution of 
5:188:11753:14:14:72:487:414:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the burden from regulation, as well as the cost to the overall economy.  Figure 1 helps 
5:189:11841:14:13:72:509:400:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:convey the different impacts.5  Here it is assumed that the points of regulation (the entities 
5:190:11936:13:14:72:453:387:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:that must hold and submit allowances) are firms within a competitive industry. 
5:191:12015:14:14:72:75:373:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: 
5:192:12015:14:14:108:484:359:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: Consider first the market equilibrium in the absence of regulation.  The initial 
5:193:12096:14:14:72:467:345:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:equilibrium price and level of output at the industry level are shown as p0 and X0 , 
5:194:12181:14:13:72:504:331:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:respectively.  These are determined by the equilibrium of the original supply and demand 
5:195:12270:13:14:72:154:318:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:curves S0 and D. 
5:196:12287:14:14:71:74:304:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: 
5:197:12287:14:14:107:521:290:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: Introducing a cap-and-trade system covering emissions from this industry gives firms 
5:198:12372:14:14:71:476:276:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:incentives to reduce emissions.  No matter whether allowances are given out free or 
5:199:12456:14:14:72:501:262:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:auctioned, each additional unit of emissions has an opportunity cost:  either it obliges the 
5:200:12549:14:13:72:521:248:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:firm to purchase an additional allowance, or it reduces the number of surplus allowances that 
5:201:12643:13:14:72:522:235:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the firm can sell.  In general, a firm can accomplish the emissions reductions by changing the 
5:202:12738:14:14:72:495:221:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:input mix (for example, switching to less carbon-intensive fuels), installing end-of-pipe 
5:203:12828:14:14:72:492:207:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:equipment, or reducing its level of output.  In the figure, it is assumed that the first two 
5:204:12921:14:14:72:519:193:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:adjustments raise production costs by  c  per unit of output.  The figure also assumes that the 
5:205:13017:14:13:72:512:179:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:cost per unit of remaining emissions – the allowance price multiplied by emissions per unit 
5:206:13109:13:14:72:512:166:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of output – is r.  Thus, the policy drives a wedge of c+r between the consumer price pC and 
5:207:13201:14:14:72:491:152:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the producer price pS.  This implies the new supply curve S1, which in turn implies that 
5:208:13290:14:14:71:254:138:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:industry output will be reduced to X1.

6:216:13533:14:14:108:487:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: If the allowances are introduced through a competitive auction, the policy will 
6:217:13613:14:14:72:503:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:generate no rents:  they are bid away through competitive bidding for allowances.  In this 
6:218:13704:14:14:71:501:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:case, the loss of producer surplus is shaded trapezoid p0 bdpS, while the loss of consumer 
6:219:13795:14:13:72:486:639:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:surplus is pC abp0.  The shaded rectangular area pC aef  represents the revenue that the 
6:220:13884:13:14:72:475:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:government would receive from the allowance auction.  These revenues can benefit 
6:221:13965:14:14:72:466:612:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:taxpayers to the extent that they reduce the government’s reliance on other taxes.  
6:222:14049:14:14:72:492:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Alternatively, the revenues pC aef  can be used to pay for additional public spending, in

6:228:14250:14:14:108:509:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: If the allowances are introduced through free allocation, the distribution of impacts 
6:229:14336:14:13:72:478:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:between producers and taxpayers is fundamentally different.  In this case the shaded 
6:230:14421:13:14:72:508:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:rectangle  pC aef   represents rents to producers rather than revenues to the government.  In 
6:231:14515:14:14:71:521:474:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the figure, these rents are about three times as large as the gross loss of producer surplus (the 
6:232:14613:14:14:72:491:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:loss before considering the rents) represented by the shaded area p0bdpS .  Thus, in this 
6:233:14703:14:14:72:508:446:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:figure, free allocation would enable the firm to enjoy a higher profit than in the absence of

6:239:14855:14:13:108:517:363:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: Policy choices are not limited to the cases of 100 percent auctioning and 100 percent 
6:240:14941:13:14:72:519:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:free allocation:  another option is combining free allocation and auctioning.  For the industry 
6:241:15037:14:14:72:469:336:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:depicted in the diagram, industry profits would be preserved if about a third of the 
6:242:15122:14:14:71:517:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:allowances were given out free, thus enabling the firm to enjoy about a third of the potential 
6:243:15217:14:13:71:503:308:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:rents.  The rest of the allowances could be auctioned out.  As indicated below, auctioning 
6:244:15308:13:14:72:386:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:confers some potential advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness.

6:246:15374:14:14:108:478:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: The amount of free allocation necessary to compensate firms for the costs of 
6:247:15451:14:14:71:519:253:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:complying with the program depends on the extent to which firms can shift to consumers the 
6:248:15542:14:13:71:522:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:burden of regulation.  This in turn depends on the elasticity of supply relative to the elasticity 
6:249:15641:13:14:71:524:226:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of demand.  A higher relative elasticity of supply implies a larger pass-through of compliance 
6:250:15736:14:14:71:518:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:costs into producer prices and a smaller gross loss of producer surplus.  It also implies larger 
6:251:15833:14:14:71:504:198:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:potential rents relative to the gross loss of producer surplus, which in turn means that less 
6:252:15927:14:14:71:495:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:free allocation (or rents to be retained by firms) is needed to maintain profits.  A second 
6:253:16019:14:13:71:523:170:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:factor is the extent of required abatement:  at low levels of abatement, permit rents pC aef  are 
6:254:16117:13:14:71:518:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:large relative to the gross loss of producer surplus p0bdpS, which suggests that relatively few 
6:255:16213:14:14:72:522:143:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:free allowances will be needed to preserve profit.  On the other hand, low required abatement 
6:256:16307:14:14:72:506:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:generally is associated with lower allowance prices, which means that, other things equal, 
6:257:16398:14:14:72:516:115:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:more allowances must be freely offered to provide sufficient value to preserve profit.  In the

7:264:16660:14:14:107:501:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: Free allocation may have attractions in terms of political feasibility.  By allowing 
7:265:16745:14:13:72:522:639:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:producers to retain the rents created by the cap-and-trade system, free allocation not only can 
7:266:16841:13:14:72:520:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:preserve profits but indeed can cause profits to rise.  This protection of profits can help build 
7:267:16939:14:14:72:310:612:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:political support from energy-related industries.

7:269:16991:14:14:108:516:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: On the other hand, auctioning has a potential advantage over free allocation in terms 
7:270:17077:14:13:72:489:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of cost-effectiveness.  Under auctioning, the public sector avails itself of a particularly 
7:271:17169:13:14:72:524:557:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:efficient source of revenues – the proceeds from the auction.  The base of the auction revenue 
7:272:17264:14:14:72:508:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:is inframarginal – it is economic rent – and carries no direct efficiency cost.  In the case of 
7:273:17360:14:14:72:516:529:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:free allocation, the government forgoes this efficient source of revenue.  Other things equal, 
7:274:17455:14:14:72:500:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the government must instead rely more on ordinary, distortionary taxes (such as income, 
7:275:17543:14:13:72:524:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:sales, or payroll taxes) to meet its expenditures.  Raising such taxes carries an efficiency cost. 
7:276:17642:13:14:71:74:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: 
7:277:17642:14:14:107:483:474:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: This suggests a trade-off between enhancing political feasibility (through free 
7:278:17722:14:14:71:519:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:allocation) and maximizing cost-effectiveness (through auctioning).  The trade-off might not 
7:279:17815:14:14:71:505:446:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:be severe, however.  If (as suggested by the graph) profits can be maintained through free 
7:280:17906:14:13:71:489:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:allocation of a relatively small fraction of the allowances, then a significant amount of 
7:281:17996:13:14:71:496:419:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:auctioning is consistent with profit preservation.  In these circumstances the sacrifice of 
7:282:18088:14:14:71:478:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:potential revenue would be considerably smaller than in the case of 100 percent free 
7:283:18173:14:14:71:499:391:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:allocation, and thus the sacrifice of cost-effectiveness need not be large – if the revenues 
7:284:18266:14:14:71:376:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:from the auction are used to finance cuts in distortionary taxes.

10:457:28305:7:16:72:521:170:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:13 As long as imports are the marginal source of supply to the domestic economy, domestic producers of oil and

10:459:28528:11:12:71:516:143:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:prices stimulate investment in backstop fuels.  Eventually, backstop fuels production plus domestic oil and gas 
10:460:28640:12:11:71:513:131:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:supply together satisfy all domestic demand, and the domestic oil and gas price is determined by the backstop

10:463:28763:7:16:72:509:101:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:14 For convenience, we assume that the accelerated depreciation schedule can be approximated by a schedule 
10:464:28870:16:11:72:302:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:involving a constant rate of exponential tax depreciation.

11:466:28930:0:13:72:512:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:payment.  Therefore the receipt of free allowances does not alter marginal costs or returns.  
11:467:29024:13:14:72:517:695:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Thus, free allowances have no direct effect on a firm’s choices of labor, intermediate inputs,

13:631:35086:14:14:72:510:538:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:model.  In the benchmark year, 2005, the government deficit is 1.9 percent of GDP.  In the 
13:632:35177:14:14:72:503:524:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:reference (status quo) simulation, the deficit-GDP ratio is approximately constant.  In the 
13:633:35269:14:13:71:481:510:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:policy experiments in this paper, we require that the real deficit and real government 
13:634:35356:13:14:71:511:497:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:spending follow the same path as in the reference case.  The government’s real tax receipts 
13:635:35448:14:14:71:510:483:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:under a policy change thus must be the same as in the reference case.  As discussed below,

14:708:39867:7:16:72:513:90:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:19 As indicated in Section 2, the opportunity cost of emissions is the same no matter whether the firm receives 
14:709:39979:16:0:72:287:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:allowances free or must purchase them at an auction.

15:711:40126:20:13:72:524:688:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:taxes on fuel k used by industry j, and dj  is a dummy variable that equals one if industry j is a

15:714:40265:14:14:107:508:647:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:  Allowance Allocation.  The model can consider any combination of auctioning and 
15:715:40347:14:14:71:518:633:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:free allocation of allowances, including the limiting cases of 100 percent auctioning and 100 
15:716:40441:14:13:71:515:619:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:percent free allocation.  In addition, it is flexible as to how the free allowances are allocated 
15:717:40539:13:14:71:201:606:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:across various industries.   
15:718:40568:14:15:71:74:592:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2: 
15:719:40568:15:14:108:468:577:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2: Recall from equation (7) in subsection 3.1 above that αiA is the number of 
15:720:40643:14:13:72:508:563:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:allowances allocated freely to industry i (in a given time period).   Producers can use these 
15:721:40737:13:14:71:518:550:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:emissions allowances themselves or sell them at the market price to other industries covered 
15:722:40830:14:14:71:521:536:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:under the cap.  Equation (7) indicates that from the firm’s point of view, allowances received 
15:723:40925:14:14:71:513:522:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:free are a lump-sum transfer:  they do not affect firms’ marginal costs of production.  Thus, 
15:724:41019:14:14:71:428:508:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:free allocation has no direct effect on firms’ pricing or output decisions.20

15:726:41099:13:14:107:522:481:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2: Banking and Borrowing.  Provisions for banking and borrowing allow firms to equate 
15:727:41182:14:14:71:504:467:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:marginal abatement costs (in present value) over time, which reduces the present value of 
15:728:41272:14:14:71:509:453:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:abatement costs.  Under a system with fully functioning banking and borrowing, in market 
15:729:41361:14:14:71:490:439:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:equilibrium the discounted allowance price will be the same in every period within the 
15:730:41448:14:13:71:511:425:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:interval where banking and borrowing is allowed.  In simulations of cap-and-trade systems 
15:731:41538:13:14:71:498:412:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:involving banking and borrowing, we introduce this condition.  In addition, we relax the 
15:732:41627:14:14:71:469:398:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:condition that in any given period, the initial aggregate supply of allowances must 
15:733:41711:14:14:71:514:384:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:correspond to aggregate emissions.  We replace this condition with the requirement that the 
15:734:41803:14:14:71:510:370:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:cumulative supply of allowances over the interval that allows banking and borrowing must 
15:735:41892:14:14:71:295:356:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:equal cumulative emissions over that interval.

15:743:42045:14:14:72:75:246:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2: 
15:744:42045:14:14:107:416:232:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:(1) the aggregate demand for labor equals the aggregate supply;

15:748:42313:14:14:108:508:177:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:(4) government expenditure must equal tax revenue less the exogenously specified

15:752:42467:8:16:72:516:101:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:20 However, free allocation can affect prices and output by way of impacts on the fiscal system.  These general 
15:753:42579:16:11:72:259:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:equilibrium effects are discussed in Section 5. 
15:754:42627:11:0:72:75:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2: 
16:755:42629:0:13:107:516:708:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2: These conditions are met through adjustments in output prices, in the market interest 
16:756:42715:13:14:72:490:695:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:rate, and in lump-sum taxes or tax rates.21  In simulations of cap-and-trade policies, an 
16:757:42805:14:14:71:481:681:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:additional condition applies in each period if there is no banking and borrowing:  the 
16:758:42892:14:14:71:518:667:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:aggregate demand for allowances (given by aggregate emissions from covered sectors) must 
16:759:42981:14:14:71:519:653:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:equal the aggregate supply.  If banking and borrowing is specified, an intertemporal demand-
16:760:43073:14:13:71:488:639:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:supply requirement replaces this condition:  cumulative demand for allowances over a 
16:761:43158:13:14:71:492:626:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:specified interval must equal the cumulative supply of allowances over that interval, as

16:767:43373:14:14:71:484:543:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:an equilibrium, we apply an algorithm similar to that of Fair and Taylor (1983).  This 
16:768:43460:14:14:71:461:529:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:approach starts with posited values for “dynamic variables” that embody agents’ 
16:769:43540:14:14:71:492:515:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:expectations.  The posited dynamic variables include shadow values for capital in each 
16:770:43627:14:13:71:515:501:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:industry and for human wealth.  We solve the model using the posited dynamic variables as 
16:771:43717:13:14:71:513:488:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:inputs.  We then compare the values of these dynamic variables with the values of dynamic 
16:772:43807:14:14:71:507:474:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:variables that result from the simulation.  If the values do not match, we adjust the posited 
16:773:43901:14:14:71:511:460:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:dynamic variables and solve the model again.   We repeat this process until the posited and 
16:774:43993:14:13:71:507:446:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:derived dynamic variables match, at which point the model has attained perfect foresight.

18:860:48927:13:14:72:75:557:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2: 
18:861:48927:14:14:107:475:543:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2: The cap-and-trade policies focus on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which 
18:862:49001:14:14:71:520:529:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:accounted for 86 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions (in CO2 equivalents) in 2007, the 
18:863:49093:14:14:72:495:515:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:latest year for which public estimates are available.  The other greenhouse gases are not 
18:864:49183:14:13:72:519:501:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:capped.  Figure 2 displays the economy-wide emissions of CO2 that result from the model in 
18:865:49274:13:14:71:486:488:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the reference case and under cap and trade.  The emissions cap requires a reduction in 
18:866:49361:14:14:71:493:474:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:emissions of about three percent from 2005 levels by 2012, 17 percent by 2020, and 42 
18:867:49447:14:14:71:513:460:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:percent by 2030.  This time-profile of the cap matches that proposed in HR 2454 (Waxman-
18:868:49535:14:14:71:487:446:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Markey), which was passed on June 26, 2009 by the U.S. House of Representatives.25

18:873:49640:14:14:108:522:377:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2: The points of regulation represent a key design element of any cap-and-trade system.  
18:874:49726:14:13:72:506:363:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Under a fully upstream policy, the points of regulation are the entry points of CO2 into the 
18:875:49819:13:14:72:521:350:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:economy:  the mine mouth for coal and the wellhead for oil and gas, and the port of entry for 
18:876:49913:14:14:72:499:336:145:g_d0_f2:145:Times:imported fossil fuels.  Most actual policy proposals adopt a different, modified upstream 
18:877:50003:14:14:72:503:322:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:approach, in which the points of regulations are slightly further downstream.  Our central 
18:878:50094:14:13:72:481:308:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:case involves a modified upstream approach.  The points of regulation are electricity 
18:879:50180:13:14:72:502:295:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:generators, petroleum refiners, natural gas pipelines, and some industries that use carbon-
18:880:50271:14:14:72:486:281:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:based fuels intensively (chemical and primary metals manufacturers).26  This roughly 
18:881:50356:14:14:72:517:267:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:corresponds to the industries identified as points of regulation in HR 2454. 27   In subsection

18:887:50610:7:16:72:511:182:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:25 After 2030, we allow the cap to increase at the model’s steady-state growth rate of two percent per year, so 
18:888:50722:16:12:72:518:166:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:that the ratio of emissions to aggregate output becomes constant in the long run and the model attains balanced

19:929:53052:14:13:72:503:264:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:confined to the industries selected as points of regulation.  Generally these industries will 
19:930:53146:13:14:72:520:251:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:shift some of the burden forward to their customers and backward to their suppliers.29  Some

19:933:53428:14:14:72:520:209:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:includes industries that are not points of regulation.  These additional industries benefit from 
19:934:53525:14:13:72:523:195:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the free allowances by selling their allowances to the industries that are points of regulation.

19:938:53785:16:12:71:498:143:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:reductions in profit over the interval 2009-2030.  We exclude the water utilities industry (which otherwise 
19:939:53893:12:11:71:497:131:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:would rank in the top eight) from consideration because of its small size and low emissions relative to the

19:943:54114:16:11:71:519:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:economic theory implies that the distribution of the burden of a cap-and-trade system is entirely independent of

20:965:55214:14:13:107:488:432:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2: Table 2 shows the impacts of the cap-and-trade policy on the profits in various 
20:966:55294:13:14:71:513:419:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:industries for years 2015 and 2020, for the cases involving 100 percent auctioning and 100  
20:967:55386:14:14:71:509:405:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:percent free allocation.  The profit impacts differ dramatically depending on the method of 
20:968:55478:14:14:71:124:391:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:allocation.

20:970:55490:14:13:107:515:363:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2: Under 100 percent auctioning, the carbon-intensive industries experience significant 
20:971:55575:13:14:71:498:350:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:losses of profit.  The magnitudes of these losses are very similar across the two forms of 
20:972:55666:14:14:71:504:336:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:revenue-recycling (personal tax rate cuts and lump-sum rebates).  The method of revenue-
20:973:55754:14:14:71:521:322:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:recycling affects households’ labor supply, saving and investment decisions.  Although these 
20:974:55847:14:13:71:514:308:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:decisions are important for the overall economy, they tend to be spread across all industries 
20:975:55941:13:14:71:490:295:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:rather than be concentrated in the carbon-intensive industries.  Thus, the impact on the 
20:976:56030:14:14:71:517:281:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:carbon-intensive industries is relatively minor, particularly in the short term.31  Coal mining 
20:977:56126:14:14:71:524:267:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:and coal-fired electricity generation endure the largest losses, in keeping with the high carbon 
20:978:56223:14:14:71:525:253:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:intensity of their output (from coal mining) or fuel input (for coal-fired electricity generation.  
20:979:56323:14:13:71:497:239:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Other carbon-intensive industries also experience significant profit losses.  Note that the 
20:980:56415:13:14:71:516:226:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:losses of profit are not confined to the points of regulation (electricity generators, petroleum 
20:981:56512:14:23:71:502:212:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:refiners, chemical and primary metals producers, and natural gas distributors).  Likewise,

20:983:56656:7:16:72:520:182:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:30 The lump-sum tax rebate is set equal to the value of emissions allowances auctioned.  This is in keeping with 
20:984:56769:16:12:71:493:166:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:recent proposals, which specify household rebates and other outlays as percentages of the gross value of  
20:985:56875:12:11:71:521:154:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:auction revenues, rather than as percentages of auction revenue net of the revenue loss from the reduction in the 
20:986:56989:11:12:71:496:143:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:tax base.  To account for tax base impacts and thus achieve overall revenue neutrality, we adjust personal 
20:987:57096:12:11:71:142:131:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:income tax rates.

20:989:57114:7:16:72:488:113:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:31 In the longer term, the choice of recycling method has a more perceptible impact on industry profits.  
20:990:57220:16:12:71:521:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Recycling through cuts in marginal tax rates tends to stimulate investment more than lump-sum recycling does.  
20:991:57331:12:11:71:497:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:As a result, firms tend to enjoy larger profit increases, or suffer smaller losses, under the former recycling

21:993:57453:0:13:72:499:708:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:some of the points of regulation (in particular, non-fossil electricity generators and other 
21:994:57546:13:14:72:504:695:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:fossil generators) experience increased profits under 100 percent auctioning.  Other fossil 
21:995:57638:14:14:71:483:681:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:generators are primarily natural gas combined cycle plants.  The cap and trade policy 
21:996:57724:14:14:71:491:667:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:stimulates substitution away from coal-fired generation (which is exceptionally carbon-
21:997:57811:14:14:71:524:653:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:intensive) toward other forms of electricity generation.  The increased demand for these other 
21:998:57906:14:13:71:402:639:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:generation methods underlies the profit increases in these industries.

21:1001:58067:14:14:71:497:598:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:industries that would suffer the largest percentage losses without free allocation or other 
21:1002:58159:14:14:71:518:584:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:compensation, 100 percent free allocation yields increases – and often very large increases – 
21:1003:58253:14:13:71:518:570:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:in profit.  For coal mining, for example, in 2020 the 35 percent reduction in profit under 100 
21:1004:58348:13:14:71:520:557:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:percent auctioning converts to a 141 percent increase under 100 percent free allocation.  One 
21:1005:58442:14:14:71:498:543:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:hundred percent free allocation overcompensates industries by giving them a quantity of 
21:1006:58530:14:14:71:486:529:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:allowances whose value exceeds the policy-induced gross loss of producer surplus, as 
21:1007:58615:14:14:71:474:515:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:defined in Section 2.  To preserve profits, the government needs only to offer firms 
21:1008:58700:14:13:71:508:501:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:allowances whose value corresponds to the portion of the policy burden that producers are 
21:1009:58790:13:14:71:494:488:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:unable to shift to other industries or to consumers.  One hundred percent free allocation 
21:1010:58880:14:14:71:339:474:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:grants firms considerably more allowances than this..32

21:1026:59917:14:14:72:486:253:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:electricity generators would receive about 24 percent of their needed allowances free.

21:1030:60159:16:11:71:517:200:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:allowances were freely allocated to firms.  Several interested parties have voiced concerns that this might have

21:1037:60753:16:12:71:518:120:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:industries are being offered free allowances. The numbers shown are the required allowances when each of the 
21:1038:60862:12:11:71:510:108:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:eight industries simultaneously receives the needed free allowances.  In other simulations we have calculated 
21:1039:60972:11:12:71:507:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:the required profit-preserving free allocation when free allocation is just offered to one industry.  From such 
21:1040:61084:12:11:71:500:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:simulations the requirements for any industry are very close to those reported for that industry in the table. 
21:1041:61195:11:0:71:74:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2: 
22:1042:61197:0:13:107:468:708:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2: The other vulnerable industries require smaller shares of the system’s total 
22:1043:61274:13:14:72:503:695:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:allowances, and their free allowances represent smaller fractions of their own emissions.  
22:1044:61365:14:14:72:515:681:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Importantly, the allowances needed by these industries together total less than 14 percent of 
22:1045:61459:14:14:72:515:667:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the cap-and-trade systems allowances.  Thus, these simulations suggest that over 86 percent 
22:1046:61551:14:14:72:502:653:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:of the allowances could be auctioned out.34  Table 4 provides a closer look at the relative 
22:1047:61643:14:13:71:496:639:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:contributions to emissions of the various industries to emissions under the cap and trade 
22:1048:61733:13:14:71:522:626:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:policy, and the allowances required for profit-preservation, both in levels and as a percentage 
22:1049:61829:14:14:71:203:612:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:of the economy-wide total.

22:1051:61856:14:14:107:512:584:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2: The fact that profit-preservation is consistent with auctioning over 86 percent of the 
22:1052:61943:14:13:71:525:570:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:allowances has important implications for the overall policy costs.  As discussed in Section 2, 
22:1053:62039:13:14:71:520:557:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:100 percent auctioning has the greatest potential for cost-effectiveness because it enables the 
22:1054:62135:14:14:71:512:543:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:government to make use of a particularly efficient revenue source – auction proceeds – and 
22:1055:62226:14:14:71:511:529:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:thus avoid relying as much on distortionary taxes to meet given expenditure requirements.  
22:1056:62317:14:14:71:505:515:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:To the extent that the government utilizes free allocation, it foregoes the efficient revenue 
22:1057:62411:14:13:71:521:501:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:source and must rely more on distortionary taxes.  In our simulations, 100 percent auctioning 
22:1058:62505:13:14:71:520:488:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:enables the government to simultaneously reduce marginal tax rates on labor income by 0.21 
22:1059:62596:14:14:71:516:474:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:percentage points and on capital income by 0.32 percentage points.  In contrast, 100 percent 
22:1060:62689:14:14:71:496:460:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:free allocation compels the government to raise these marginal rates by 0.64 percentage 
22:1061:62777:14:14:71:311:446:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:points and 0.97 percentage points, respectively.35

22:1063:62827:13:14:107:491:419:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2: The bottom row of Table 3 reveals the significance of the alternative allocation 
22:1064:62908:14:14:71:524:405:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:methods for policy costs, here expressed as the reduction, relative to the reference case, in the 
22:1065:63006:14:14:71:493:391:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:present value of GDP over the interval 2009-2030.  The most cost-effective case is 100 
22:1066:63093:14:14:71:484:377:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:percent auctioning with auction revenues used to finance cuts in the marginal rates of 
22:1067:63180:14:13:71:523:363:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:personal income taxes.  In this case, cap and trade has a GDP cost of about 0.57 percent.  The 
22:1068:63275:13:14:71:510:350:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:least cost-effective cases are those in which no policy-generated revenue is used to finance 
22:1069:63368:14:14:71:519:336:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:cuts in marginal rates of individual income taxes.  These include the case of 100 percent free 
22:1070:63463:14:14:71:518:322:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:allocation and the case of 100 percent auctioning, with revenues recycled through lump-sum 
22:1071:63554:14:13:71:516:308:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:rebates.  In these cases, the GDP costs are very similar – 0.79 and 0.81 percent, respectively 
22:1072:63649:13:14:71:398:295:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:– and about 65 percent higher than in the most cost-effective case.   
22:1073:63719:14:14:71:74:281:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2: 
22:1074:63719:14:14:107:508:267:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2: The table also shows the GDP costs in the case of profit-preserving free allocation, 
22:1075:63804:14:14:71:499:253:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:that is, where just enough allowances (about 14 percent of the total) are given out free to 
22:1076:63896:14:13:72:516:239:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:preserve profits in the eight most vulnerable industries.  Again the GDP costs depend on the 
22:1077:63989:13:14:72:520:226:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:method of revenue recycling.  Importantly, preserving profits need not substantially raise the 
22:1078:64084:14:23:72:486:212:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:GDP costs.  When the revenues from the auction component of this policy are used to

22:1080:64221:7:16:72:513:182:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:34 HR 2454 provides for limited use of auctioning in the early years of the cap-and-trade system, with roughly 
22:1081:64332:16:12:71:521:166:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:80 percent of allowances allocated freely to various stakeholders.  Many of these compensation programs phase 
22:1082:64442:12:11:71:518:154:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:out over 2026-2030, however, with the result that roughly 70 percent of allowances are to be auctioned in 2030 
22:1083:64553:11:12:71:111:143:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:and later.

22:1085:64564:7:16:72:513:124:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:35 Another possible use of auction revenues is to finance additional government spending.  Farrow (1999) and 
22:1086:64673:16:11:71:510:108:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Parry and Oates (2000) offer analyses of the efficiency implications when environmental policy revenues are 
22:1087:64781:11:12:71:487:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:employed in this way.  Even after auctioning becomes the dominant method of allocation, most auction 
22:1088:64882:12:11:71:459:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:revenues are designated for financing lump-sum rebates rather than reductions in marginal rates. 
22:1089:64979:11:0:71:79:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:   
23:1090:64984:0:13:72:493:708:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:finance marginal income tax rate cuts, the GDP costs are increased by just nine percent 
23:1091:65072:13:14:72:523:695:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:relative to the most cost-effective case.  The costs in this case are about a third lower than the 
23:1092:65171:14:14:72:521:681:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:previously mentioned cases involving no marginal rate cuts.  If instead the revenues from the 
23:1093:65265:14:14:72:513:667:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:auction component are recycled through lump-sum rebates, the GDP costs are very close to 
23:1094:65354:14:14:72:351:653:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:those of the other cases involving no marginal rate cuts.36 
23:1095:65413:14:13:71:74:639:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2: 
23:1096:65413:13:14:107:507:626:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2: Two key messages emerge from these results.  First, relatively little free allocation 
23:1097:65499:14:14:71:497:612:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:suffices to prevent profit losses in major carbon-supplying and carbon-using industries.  
23:1098:65589:14:14:72:509:598:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Second, relative to the most cost-effective case involving no profit-preservation, the added 
23:1099:65682:14:14:72:506:584:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:GDP cost of preventing profit losses is small, provided that revenues are recycled through 
23:1100:65773:14:13:72:505:570:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:marginal income tax cuts.  We will see that these results are quite robust to the alternative 
23:1101:65867:13:14:72:235:557:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:policy designs examined below.   
23:1102:65900:14:14:72:75:543:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2: 
23:1103:65900:14:14:108:520:529:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2: The finding that relatively few allowances are needed to preserve profits is consistent 
23:1104:65988:14:14:72:511:515:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:with earlier findings by Bovenberg and Goulder (2001) and Smith and Ross (2002).  These 
23:1105:66076:14:13:72:497:501:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:studies considered only upstream cap-and-trade systems and concentrated on preserving 
23:1106:66162:13:14:72:513:488:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:profits in the coal mining and oil&gas extraction industries.  Bovenberg and Goulder found 
23:1107:66253:14:14:72:516:474:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:that freely allocating about 10 percent of the allowances sufficed to preserve profits in those 
23:1108:66349:14:14:72:500:460:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:industries.  Smith and Ross found that 9-21 percent would be sufficient to preserve these 
23:1109:66439:14:14:72:504:446:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:industries’ profits.   In a subsequent study, Smith, Ross, and Montgomery (2002) claimed 
23:1110:66528:14:13:72:479:432:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:that considerably higher fractions of allowances must be freely allocated to preserve 
23:1111:66614:13:14:72:124:419:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:profits.37   
23:1112:66627:14:21:71:143:405:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:  
23:1113:66629:21:7:216:219:384:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:                                                      
23:1114:66682:7:16:72:495:377:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:36 Employment impacts tend to correlate with the GDP impacts.  In particular, in the cases of 100 percent 
23:1115:66788:16:11:71:498:361:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:auctioning as well as 100 percent free allocation with revenues recycled lump-sum, cap and trade causes a 
23:1116:66894:11:12:71:498:350:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:reduction of 0.1 percent in aggregate employment in 2020.  In contrast, under 100 percent auctioning with 
23:1117:67000:12:11:71:502:338:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:revenues devoted to marginal income tax cuts, there is a slightly positive (0.1 percent) impact on aggregate 
23:1118:67109:11:12:71:126:327:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:employment. 
23:1119:67121:12:7:71:74:315:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2: 
23:1120:67121:7:16:72:508:308:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:37 The authors make two main arguments to support the claim that a larger percentage is needed.  One is that 
23:1121:67230:16:11:72:506:292:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:free allocation must take place over a relatively short period of time, and yet compensate for potential profit 
23:1122:67342:11:12:72:498:281:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:losses over an infinite time horizon.  Clearly the shorter the time-interval for free allocation relative to the 
23:1123:67455:12:11:72:477:269:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:interval over which losses are calculated, the larger the required free allocation.  To us it seems most 
23:1124:67560:11:12:72:522:258:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:informative to use the same interval of time for profit calculations and the free allocation of allowances:  that is, 
23:1125:67678:12:11:72:507:246:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:to consider the profit losses of some given interval of time, and then to determine how much free allocation, 
23:1126:67788:11:12:72:357:235:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:within that same time interval, is needed to prevent those profit losses. 
23:1127:67862:12:11:72:80:223:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:   
23:1128:67865:11:12:72:524:212:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:   A second argument is that more free allocation is needed once one accounts for the heterogeneity of producers 
23:1129:67978:12:11:72:519:200:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:within industries.  Consider the case where the cap-and-trade program would increase the profits of some firms 
23:1130:68089:11:12:72:503:189:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:within an industry that, on average, suffers a profit loss from the policy.  In this case the average loss to the 
23:1131:68203:12:11:72:518:177:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:“losing” firms exceeds the average loss for the industry as a whole.  Hence greater compensation would indeed 
23:1132:68313:11:12:72:517:166:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:be needed than what the industry-average profit loss suggests.  Thus, in our analysis, to the extent that some of 
23:1133:68427:12:11:72:514:154:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:the firms in a losing industry experience profit-increases as a result of cap and trade, our results understate the 
23:1134:68543:11:12:72:518:143:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:amount of free allocation needed to compensate the losing firms.  However, it is hard to imagine that this issue 
23:1135:68656:12:11:72:517:131:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:has much empirical significance.  The claimed bias requires that some of the firms in a losing industry actually 
23:1136:68769:11:12:72:520:120:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:experience profit increases from cap and trade.  Within any of the eight most vulnerable industries we consider, 
23:1137:68882:12:11:72:481:108:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:one might expect some heterogeneity across firms in the magnitude of profit losses under 100 percent 
23:1138:68983:11:12:72:506:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:auctioning.  But it seems highly doubtful that many or indeed any firms within those industries would enjoy 
23:1139:69091:12:11:72:305:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:increased profits as a result of the cap-and-trade program.

24:1172:70131:14:13:72:485:501:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:would have an incentive to bank an allowance (save it for future use) if it expected its

24:1196:71608:16:11:71:508:177:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:allowance prices) will be equated across time.  Hence allowance prices rise at the rate of interest.  We model

24:1200:72056:12:11:71:452:131:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:time interval. The latter condition assures that firms bring their bank balances to zero by 2030.

24:1203:72261:16:12:71:515:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:marginal income tax rates.  In fact the emissions impacts under banking and borrowing are very similar under

25:1239:73630:14:14:72:508:543:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:are reflected in lower GDP costs.  Similarly, in many industries the losses of profit under 1
