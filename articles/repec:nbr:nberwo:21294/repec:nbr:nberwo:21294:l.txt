2:28:1370:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:This paper studies how financial information frictions can generate sentiment-driven fluctuations in
2:29:1470:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:asset prices and self-fulfilling business cycles. In our model economy, exuberant financial market
2:30:1568:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:sentiments of high output and high demand for capital increase the price of capital, which signals strong
2:31:1673:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:fundamentals of the economy to the real side and consequently leads to an actual boom in real output
2:32:1773:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:and employment. The model further derives implications for asymmetric non-linear asset prices and
2:33:1870:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:for economic contagion and co-movement across countries. In the extension to the dynamic OLG setting,
2:34:1971:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:our model demonstrates that sentiment shocks can generate persistent output, employment and business
2:35:2071:14:42:72:504:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:cycle fluctuations, and offers some new implications for asset prices over business cycles.

3:56:2531:0:32:71:175:709:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:1  Introduction
3:57:2546:32:18:71:534:677:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The nancial sector plays a central role in the modern economy, as is evident from the wide and
3:58:2641:18:18:71:535:659:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:deep macroeconomic impact of the recent global nancial crisis in 2007-2009. Thereare at least
3:59:2735:18:18:71:537:641:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:two channels through which the nancial sector can inuence the aggregate real economy (see,
3:60:2827:18:18:71:535:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:e.g., Levine (2005)): 1) the nancing of capital; 2) the production of information about investment
3:61:2926:18:18:71:533:605:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:opportunities.  An exploding nancial accelerator literature has shown, both theoretically and
3:62:3020:18:18:71:539:587:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:empirically, that the nancial sector can inuence business cycles through thenancingchannel.1
3:63:3115:18:18:71:535:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In this paper we explore the feedback e¤ect from the nancial market to the real economy due
3:64:3207:18:18:71:534:551:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to theinformationalrole of nancial prices. Unlike the conventional view that prices can help to
3:65:3303:18:18:72:534:533:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:e¢ciently allocate economic resources in a free market by signaling relevant information to economic
3:66:3403:18:18:72:536:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:actors (Hayek (1945) and Grossman and Stiglitz (1980)), we argue that the informational role of
3:67:3498:18:17:72:536:497:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:nancial markets in allocating resources can be impaired by investors sentiments or sunspots.
3:68:3592:17:18:72:535:480:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The sentiment-driven asset prices in turn may inuence real activities and shape macroeconomic
3:69:3686:18:21:72:128:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:uctuations.
3:70:3698:21:18:88:535:441:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We are motivated by a large empirical nance literature that has documented that investor
3:71:3787:18:18:72:535:423:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sentiment in nancial markets can a¤ect asset prices (see, e.g., the surveys by Hirshleifer (2001)
3:72:3885:18:18:72:535:405:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and Baker and Wurgler (2007)). The aggregate (macro)-level asset prices are in particular sensitive
3:73:3984:18:18:72:533:387:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to investor sentiment, which in turn impacts corporate nancing and investment (Lamont and
3:74:4074:18:18:72:535:369:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Stein (2006)). The recent empirical work of Angeletos, Collard and Dellas(2014) also nds that
3:75:4168:18:18:72:536:351:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:business cycle uctuations can be attributed to sentiments. Levchenko and Pandalai-Nayar (2015)
3:76:4263:18:18:72:535:333:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:identify the sentiment shock as being more important than other factors in explaining business
3:77:4357:18:21:72:298:315:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cycle comovement between the US and Canada.
3:78:4400:21:18:88:534:294:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We formalize our idea in a simple baseline three-periodrational expectations modelconsisting
3:79:4492:18:18:71:534:276:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of a continuum of investors and workers.  The investors live from period 0 to period 1.  They
3:80:4585:18:18:71:536:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are the initial capital owners. The workers live from period 1 to period 2. The only fundamental
3:81:4681:18:17:71:533:240:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:uncertainty in the economy is theaggregatetotal factor productivity (TFP) shock in the last period
3:82:4779:17:18:71:532:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(period 2). We assume, in the baseline case, that only the investors have information about the TFP
3:83:4878:18:18:71:533:205:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:shock. The TFP shock in period 2 directly a¤ects the workers return on capital holdings in period
3:84:4976:18:18:71:534:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:2 (which are their labor income savings from period 1) and hence their incentive to supply labor in
3:85:5075:18:18:71:533:169:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:period 1. As capital and labor are complements in production, the workerslabor supply in period
3:86:5171:18:18:71:534:151:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:1 in turn a¤ects the investors return on capital held from period 0 toperiod 1. In such an economic
3:87:5271:18:18:71:537:133:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:environment, the investors in period 0 will need to forecast the level of aggregate economic activity,
3:88:5373:18:18:71:535:115:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that is, employment and output in period 1. On the other side, formingexpectations about the
3:89:5465:18:16:71:533:97:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:behavior of the investors, the workers can obtain information from the price of capital in period
3:90:5562:16:0:84:456:81:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:A:1See, e.g., the seminal work of Bernanke and Gertler (1989) and Kiyotaki and Moore (1997).
4:91:5653:0:18:71:534:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:0 about the return on their capital savings for period 2. This two-wayinteraction between the
4:92:5746:18:21:71:481:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:nancial market and the real economy is at the heart of our mechanism of sentiments.
4:93:5830:21:18:88:530:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Suppose that somehow exuberant sentiments lead the investors to believe there will be a boom
4:94:5922:18:18:71:533:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in output in period 1. Then they conjecture that the demand for capital and therefore return on
4:95:6017:18:18:71:536:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:capital will be high. Competition in the nancial market will push up the capital price in period 0.
4:96:6117:18:18:71:536:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:However, the workers cannot tell whether the high capital price is due to the investors sentiments
4:97:6216:18:18:71:536:598:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:or their signal of a high TFP in period 2.  After solving a signal extractionproblem, they will
4:98:6311:18:18:71:533:580:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:attribute the high price partially to a high TFP in period 2. Their actual labor supply will indeed
4:99:6410:18:18:71:535:562:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:increase, resulting in an actual boom in output in period 1. So the investors initial belief will be
4:100:6511:18:18:71:536:544:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:conrmed. We show that there exist sentiment-driven equilibria, inwhich the capital price reects
4:101:6608:18:18:71:536:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:both sentiment and TFP shocks. Under these rational expectations equilibria, Bayesian optimal
4:102:6701:18:18:71:536:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:signal extraction will result in an actual labor supply of workers that isalways equal to investors
4:103:6801:18:21:71:188:490:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:conjectured labor supply.
4:104:6826:21:17:88:537:469:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The sentiment-driven uctuation studied in the baseline model links the Keynesian notions of
4:105:6918:17:18:71:533:452:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:beauty contests and animal spirits. What matters to an individual investor is not his own
4:106:7011:18:18:71:534:434:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:assessment of the fundamentals, but his conjecture about the actions of other investors, as in a
4:107:7107:18:18:71:536:416:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:standard beauty contest game. Under the feedback e¤ect, the asset price can inuence real decisions
4:108:7206:18:18:71:533:398:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and generate complementarities between the actions of investors. Thus,the sentiment shocks in
4:109:7299:18:21:71:536:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:nancial markets endogenously drive the fundamentals and generate aggregate output uctuations.
4:110:7394:21:18:88:534:359:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We also derive implications for asymmetric non-linear asset prices andfor economic contagion
4:111:7486:18:18:71:534:341:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and co-movement across countries. First, asset price informativeness istypically asymmetric with
4:112:7582:18:18:71:534:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:respect to fundamentals. Asset price collapses occur sometimes witha small change in economic
4:113:7675:18:18:71:535:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:fundamentals (see, e.g., the evidence documented by Culter, Poterba, and Summers (1989)). Our
4:114:7768:18:18:71:536:287:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sentiment-driven equilibria can generate such asymmetric responses in asset prices. We show that
4:115:7864:18:18:71:535:269:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:our sentiment-driven equilibria can be non-linear: When the fundamental value is higher, the asset
4:116:7962:18:18:71:533:251:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:price only reects fundamentals; when the fundamental value is lower, the asset price is driven
4:117:8057:18:18:71:535:233:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:by both fundamentals and sentiments. In such non-linear equilibria,the price informativeness is
4:118:8152:18:18:71:537:215:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:asymmetric in fundamentals and a large discontinuity can exist in the asset price. Second, empirical
4:119:8252:18:17:71:536:197:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:evidence suggests that asset price contagion cannot be explained by fundamentals.2A prominent
4:120:8345:17:18:71:535:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:feature of the recent Great Recession is that it was global. Perri and Quadrini (2013) document
4:121:8440:18:18:71:536:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that all major industrialized countries experienced extraordinarily large and unprecedentedly syn-
4:122:8538:18:18:71:534:144:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:chronized contractions in output and asset prices during the GreatRecession. Our model is able to
4:123:8635:18:18:71:536:126:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:characterize such synchronization in the sentiment-driven equilibria. Due to the informational feed-
4:124:8735:18:16:71:533:108:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:back between the nancial market and the real economy, investors perception of synchronization
4:125:8830:16:0:84:423:92:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:A:2See, e.g., the ndings of Karolyi and Stultz (1996) and King and Wadhwani (2000).
5:126:8913:0:21:71:313:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:across countries can lead to actual synchronization.
5:127:8965:21:18:88:535:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, we extend our baseline model to a dynamic setting of an overlapping generations (OLG)
5:128:9059:18:18:71:534:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:model.  In the dynamic setting, the current savings of workers become the capital stock in the
5:129:9153:18:18:71:537:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:subsequent period. The capital stock therefore is dynamically linked across periods through savings.
5:130:9253:18:18:71:535:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In the sentiment-driven equilibria, capital accumulation, as well as output and employment, is
5:131:9347:18:18:71:535:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:driven not only by the private future productivity signals received by investors, but also by their
5:132:9446:18:18:71:534:598:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sentiments.  Hence, i.i.d.  sentiment shocks can generate persistent uctuations in output and
5:133:9540:18:18:71:536:580:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:unemployment. As persistence is a dening feature of all business cycles, this extension illustrates
5:134:9640:18:18:71:534:562:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that sentiments also hold the promise of explaining the persistence in real data. While building a
5:135:9738:18:18:71:535:544:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:full DSGE model and confronting it with data is beyond the scope of this paper, the mechanisms
5:136:9832:18:21:71:312:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:developed herein can lay the ground for such work.
5:137:9882:21:18:88:535:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The OLG model also generates a number of predictions about asset prices over the business
5:138:9971:18:18:72:535:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cycle. First, we show, with a closed-form solution, that the risk premium is increasing in sentiment
5:139:10071:18:17:72:533:469:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:volatility.  When the sentiment volatility increases, the asset price contains noisier information
5:140:10169:17:18:72:533:452:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:about future fundamental shocks and hence the investors demand a higherpremium on the risky
5:141:10260:18:18:72:537:434:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:investment. This implies that an economy with higher investor sentimentvolatility in nancial
5:142:10353:18:18:72:535:416:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:markets will have a higher risk premium in asset returns.  Emergingmarkets, for example, are
5:143:10445:18:18:72:533:398:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:more likely to experience higher sentiment volatility because of lower transparency in information
5:144:10543:18:18:72:533:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:disclosure. This may partially explain why these countries typically have larger risk premia than
5:145:10640:18:18:72:535:362:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the developed economies (see Salomons and Grootveld (2003) for the empirical evidence). The same
5:146:10736:18:18:72:535:344:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:argument also implies that as information transparency improves in the same country over time, the
5:147:10834:18:18:72:531:326:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:risk premium will decline. This is consistent with the evidenceshowing that the equity premium
5:148:10928:18:18:72:535:308:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:has declined (Lettau, Ludvigson and Wachter (2008), Fama and French (2002)) after the enactment
5:149:11023:18:18:72:535:290:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of new disclosure requirements in 1980 (Fox et al. (2003)). Second, sentiment-driven equilibria are
5:150:11122:18:18:72:535:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:often asymmetrical, and occur during economic downturns. Our theory therefore suggests that the
5:151:11217:18:18:72:535:254:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:risk premium is countercyclical, consistent with a large recent empirical literature.3Third, our
5:152:11313:18:18:71:536:236:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:model shows that time-varying sentiment volatility yields a time-varying risk premium. Several
5:153:11407:18:18:71:536:218:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:empirical studies have documented that investors sentiment may be a¤ected by the change of
5:154:11498:18:17:71:534:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:seasons.4The seasonal change in the sentiment volatility thus can generate seasonal self-fullling
5:155:11596:17:18:71:534:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:equilibrium uctuations in the risk premium.  Our model hence provides a rational framework
5:156:11687:18:18:71:533:165:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to explain the nancial market seasonality, which is in general regarded as a market anomaly in
5:157:11782:18:16:71:535:147:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the context of the e¢cient market hypothesis.5Interestingly, the seasonality in asset returns is

5:161:12170:11:11:72:535:94:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:Levi (2003) provide further compelling evidence of a link between the seasonal depression due to the seasonal a¤ective
5:162:12288:11:7:72:494:83:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:disorder (SAD, also known as winter blues or winter depression) and seasonal variations in stock returns.

6:164:12476:0:18:71:536:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:primarily a small-rm phenomenon, consistent with our theoretical prediction. Baker and Wurgler
6:165:12571:18:21:71:493:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(2006) document that smaller rms are more likely to be a¤ected by investorsentiments.
6:166:12657:21:18:88:539:670:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f2:A:Related literature.Our paper relates to several strands of literature. First, our paper adds
6:167:12749:18:18:71:536:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to the growing recent literature that studies the feedback e¤ectfrom nancial markets to the real
6:168:12846:18:18:71:534:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:side of the economy due to informational frictions. A number of contributions to this literature use a
6:169:12948:18:18:71:537:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:partial equilibrium model to study one rm or a de-facto-one-rm aggregate economy. For example,
6:170:13044:18:18:71:536:598:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a rm manager obtains information about the return on his own rms investment (typically ex-
6:171:13137:18:18:71:534:580:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ogenously given) from nancial markets. Bond, Edmans and Goldstein (2012) provide an extensive
6:172:13231:18:18:71:534:562:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:survey of this literature.6Luo (2005), Chen et al. (2007), Bakke and Whited (2010), Foucault and
6:173:13327:18:18:71:535:544:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Fresard (2014), among others, provide empirical evidence for the feedback e¤ect. Our work brings
6:174:13423:18:18:71:535:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:this growing micro literature on informational feedback e¤ects to a macroeconomic model. In our
6:175:13518:18:18:71:535:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:model with a general equilibrium framework, agents form expectationsand undertake investments
6:176:13611:18:18:71:536:490:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:based on information from nancial markets about the aggregate state of the economy. A key fea-
6:177:13706:18:18:71:537:472:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ture of our model therefore is that the noisy information and prices are correlated through general
6:178:13805:18:17:71:535:454:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sentiments about the aggregate economy, and can generate non-fundamental rational expectations
6:179:13899:17:18:71:533:437:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:equilibria.7We believe that our study of the feedback e¤ect operating through the macroeconomy
6:180:13993:18:18:71:535:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is important. In fact, when rms decide how much to produce, the market demand for their goods
6:181:14087:18:18:71:534:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:would be heavily inuenced by the level of aggregate demand and the stateof the economy. On the
6:182:14182:18:18:71:533:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:other hand, the nancial price indexes, which reect forward-looking views of most sophisticated
6:183:14278:18:21:71:391:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:investors, are widely seen as a barometer of the aggregate economy.
6:184:14345:21:18:88:536:344:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Our paper is closely related to Angeletos, Lorenzoni and Pavan (2010) and Goldstein, Ozde-
6:185:14435:18:18:71:535:326:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:noren and Yuan (2013). These papers also study the interaction between thereal sector and the
6:186:14528:18:18:71:535:308:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:nancial market. In Angeletos, Lorenzoni and Pavan (2010), information spillover ow from the
6:187:14621:18:18:71:536:290:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:real sector to the nancial sector, which can generate a strategic complementarity in investment,
6:188:14718:18:18:71:537:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:amplify non-fundamental shocks, and create multiple market equilibria under certain conditions.
6:189:14813:18:18:71:536:254:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The non-fundamental shocks in their model come from the correlated errors in information about
6:190:14907:18:18:71:536:236:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the fundamentals. In contrast, the non-fundamental shocks in our model come from investors sen-
6:191:15003:18:18:71:534:218:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:timents. We establish the existence of a continuum of sentiment-driven equilibria and also study
6:192:15099:18:17:71:535:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:nonlinear asymmetric sentiment-driven equilibria. In fact, a long tradition in macroeconomics has
6:193:15196:17:16:71:533:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:resorted to models that feature multiple equilibria to explain non-fundamental uctuations in

6:198:15670:7:15:84:535:123:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:7The multiplicity of equilibria in our model may be understood in terms of the correlated equilibria induced by
6:199:15781:15:11:72:537:108:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:market sentiments. See Aumann (1987), Maskin and Tirole (1987), Aumann, Peck and Shell (1988), Peck and Shell

7:204:16274:18:18:71:537:673:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a novel channel to explain how nancial markets can a¤ect business cycle uctuations.8Goldstein,
7:205:16370:18:18:71:536:655:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Ozdenoren and Yuan (2013) study information spillovers from the nancial market to the real sec-
7:206:16466:18:18:71:535:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tor,9as in our paper. Trading frenzies can arise in their model as the capitalprovider in the
7:207:16561:18:18:71:534:619:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:real sector optimally extracts information about investment returns from the nancial price driven
7:208:16659:18:18:71:536:601:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:by the speculators correlated signals. The key mechanism of their model is that the informational
7:209:16757:18:18:71:536:583:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:feedback between the nancial market and the real sector can generate complementarities in trad-
7:210:16853:18:18:71:535:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ing of speculators, namely, speculators all wish to trade like others. The authors introduce noise
7:211:16951:18:21:71:477:547:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:traders and focus on parameters that give a unique equilibrium, di¤erent from ours.10
7:212:17036:21:18:88:536:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Second, our work is related to a set of papers that emphasize informational frictions in explain-
7:213:17133:18:18:71:534:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ing asset price puzzles. Yuan (2005) and Barlevy and Veronesi (2003) explainthe asymmetric and
7:214:17227:18:18:71:536:490:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:nonlinear response in asset prices in a framework of informational frictions in an exchange economy.
7:215:17327:18:18:71:536:472:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We show that our sentiment-driven equilibria can also generate such asymmetric responses in asset
7:216:17424:18:17:71:537:454:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:prices in a production economy. Gaballo (2013) shows that the introduction of an arbitrarily small
7:217:17522:17:18:71:536:437:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:degree of price dispersion can generate large departures from the perfect-information benchmark.
7:218:17618:18:18:71:535:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Like ours, his model is fully microfounded. His mechanism crucially depends on dispersed informa-
7:219:17715:18:18:71:534:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tion. Equilibrium multiplicity in our model exists even without dispersed information and instead
7:220:17812:18:18:71:534:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:stems from the two-way feedback between the nancial market and the real economy. Benhabib
7:221:17902:18:18:71:536:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and Wang (2013) construct a sequential trading model without noise traders, in which short-
7:222:17993:18:18:71:537:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:term traders condition their trades both on private signals from fundamentals and on sunspots.
7:223:18087:18:18:71:536:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Investors purchase the assets in centralized markets using market prices to form Bayesian expecta-
7:224:18185:18:18:71:536:311:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tions about nal period returns. Benhabib and Wang (2013) show the existence of a continuum of
7:225:18279:18:18:71:533:293:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:non-fundamental sunspot equilibria. Our paper di¤ers from theirs in that the connection between
7:226:18374:18:18:71:535:275:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sentiments and the real economy is absent in their paper and they do not address feedback e¤ects
7:227:18470:18:21:71:462:257:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from the nancial market to the real economy arising from informational frictions.
7:228:18552:21:18:88:536:236:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Third, our paper is related to some other recent work on self-fullling business cycles, which has

8:259:21498:42:31:72:233:377:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:2  The Baseline Model
8:260:21519:31:18:72:536:346:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We start with a three-period baseline model with a nancial sector anda real sector. The nancial
8:261:21616:18:18:72:535:328:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sector consists of a continuum of investors with unit mass. The real sector has a representative
8:262:21712:18:18:72:534:310:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:competitive rm and a continuum of workers with unit mass. The investors live from period0to
8:263:21804:18:18:72:534:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:period1but only consume in period1. Each investor is endowed withK0= 1unit of capital in
8:264:21892:18:18:71:535:274:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:period0. Investors trade their capital in the nancial market with priceP0in period0. Each unit
8:265:21987:18:18:71:539:256:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f6:B:of capital will allow its owner to receiveR1units of dividend (nal goods) in period1, whereR1
8:266:22081:18:18:71:535:238:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:will be endogenized. The workers live from period1to period2but only consume in period2. The
8:267:22173:18:18:71:534:220:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:workers supply labor in periods1and2to the competitive rm. The workers use their wage income
8:268:22266:18:18:71:539:202:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in period1to purchase nal goods to save, thereby becoming the owners of capital in period2.
8:269:22358:18:18:72:535:184:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The competitive rm combines capital and labor to produce nal goods that can be used both for
8:270:22452:18:31:72:399:166:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:consumption and as new capital according to the production function

9:280:23065:18:18:72:534:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:capital is equivalent to trading shares of rms in the nancial market. That is, equivalently, the
9:281:23163:18:17:72:534:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f4:B:representative rm hasK0= 1unit of shares, each of the continuum of investors holdsK0= 1
9:282:23251:17:18:72:539:533:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:unit of shares in period0, and each share receivesR1units of dividend (nal goods) in period1;
9:283:23345:18:18:71:537:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:hence, the capital price can be interpreted as the equity (share) price of the representative rm.

11:360:26258:34:18:88:536:373:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We are now ready to characterize the equilibrium. Noticing that theworkers are homogeneous
11:361:26348:18:18:71:533:355:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and have the same information set, i.e.,\ni1= \n1, we focus on the symmetric equilibrium in which
11:362:26445:18:18:71:530:337:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:B:Ni1=N1.  Finding the equilibrium involves solving for the key endogenousvariableN1from
11:363:26531:18:18:71:535:319:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:equation (7). So we rst solveW1andR2and express them in terms ofN1. The following steps
11:364:26619:18:33:71:171:301:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:solve the equilibrium.
11:365:26641:33:31:85:242:268:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:1. GivenK1= 1andN1, we have
11:366:26668:31:21:226:379:237:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:C:R1=-K--11N1--1=-N1--1;
11:367:26690:21:36:224:414:216:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:C:W1=  (1--)K-1N--1= (1--)N--1.
11:368:26719:36:31:85:476:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:2. The capital in period 2 is given by the labor income in period 1. Hence we have
11:369:26801:31:36:251:387:149:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:A:K2=W1N1= (1--)N1--1.
11:370:26821:36:31:85:269:113:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:3. We then expressR2in terms ofN1:
11:371:26855:31:0:218:326:82:11:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:A:R2=-A2K--12=-A2

12:376:26887:0:32:85:412:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:4. In a symmetric equilibrium whereNi1=N1, equation (7) becomes
12:377:26950:32:35:224:414:677:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:C:N\r+1-(1--)-1= -1-(1--)-E[A2j\n1].
12:378:26983:35:31:85:459:642:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:5. We normalize -1-(1--)-= 1and denote-=1\r+1-(1--)-and thus obtain
12:379:27049:31:31:237:535:611:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:A:N1=fE[A2j\n1]g-=fE[A2jP0]g-.(10)

12:381:27148:25:18:85:533:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:6. Finally, the priceP0should be consistent with the investors rational expectations (equation

12:392:27294:28:18:88:535:491:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Equations (10) and (11) are the two key equations characterizing the equilibrium. Equation (10)
12:393:27389:18:18:71:537:473:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:says that the workers labor supply depends on their expectation of the real aggregate TFP shock,
12:394:27486:18:18:71:535:455:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:B:A2. The nancial market a¤ects the real economy through the information channelas the workers
12:395:27579:18:18:72:535:437:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:try to learnA2from the nancial price. Equation (11) states that the price of capital depends
12:396:27672:18:18:71:534:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on the marginal product of capital, which in turn depends on the real economic activities  the
12:397:27767:18:17:71:535:401:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:B:aggregatelabor supplyN1. The price of capital in the nancial market is higher if the investors
12:398:27862:17:18:71:535:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:expect an increase in the real activities. Such two-way feedback can generate rich complementarities
12:399:27962:18:18:71:534:366:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:between the nancial sector and the real sector and may result in multiple equilibria. Since solving
12:400:28062:18:18:71:533:348:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for other variables such asW1,K2andY2is straightforward via steps 1-4, we will mainly focus on
12:401:28156:18:21:71:486:330:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:solvingN1andP0in what follows. We will show three types of equilibria of the model.

13:405:28439:28:18:71:533:681:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We rst study an equilibrium where the nancial price,P0, fully reveals the fundamental uncertainty
13:406:28538:18:18:71:534:663:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:B:a2. We call this equilibrium the fully-revealing rational expectations equilibrium. We have the
13:407:28633:18:28:71:171:645:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:following proposition.
13:408:28655:28:31:71:383:617:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f3:C:Proposition 1There exists a fully-revealing equilibrium in which
13:409:28719:31:31:239:535:586:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f2:A:logP0= log-+ (1--)-a2,(12)
13:410:28745:31:18:71:83:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:C:and
13:411:28748:18:29:274:535:537:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f2:A:logN1=-a2.(13)
13:412:28762:29:27:71:517:508:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f3:C:Proof.The proof is straightforward. It is easy to see that equations (10) and (11) both hold.
13:413:28855:27:18:88:534:481:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Equation (12) implies that the capital price in period0fully revealsa2. This is a self-fullling
13:414:28951:18:18:71:536:463:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:equilibrium. If all investors believe that the dividendR1in the next period depends ona2, compe-
13:415:29047:18:18:71:537:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tition in period0will result in that in equilibrium the price must fully reveala2. Since the nancial
13:416:29148:18:18:71:539:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:price fully revealsa2, the workers face no uncertainty in deciding their labor supply in period1.
13:417:29245:18:18:71:533:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:As a result, their labor choice isN1= exp(-a2). SinceR1=-N1--1, the capital dividend indeed
13:418:29336:18:18:71:537:391:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:depends ona2and it veries the investors initial beliefs. Hence, (12) and (13) constitute a rational
13:419:29437:18:18:71:535:373:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:expectations equilibrium. In this equilibrium, the nancial market is informationally e¢cient, as
13:420:29534:18:18:71:535:355:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the uninformed workers can learn valuable information from the informed investors through the
13:421:29627:18:21:71:121:337:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:asset price.
13:422:29639:21:31:88:418:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:For the fully-revealing equilibrium, the outputs in periods 1 and 2are

13:424:29737:31:18:71:83:254:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and

13:428:29834:28:18:71:536:148:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:However, there also exists a non-revealing equilibrium where the capital price does not reveal
13:429:29928:18:27:71:517:130:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:information abouta2at all. We characterize such an equilibrium in the following proposition.
13:430:30020:27:32:71:380:103:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f3:C:Proposition 2There exists a non-revealing equilibrium in which

14:432:30095:0:18:71:83:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:C:and
14:433:30098:18:29:279:332:691:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:A:logN1= 0.
14:434:30107:29:33:71:339:662:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f3:C:Proof.The proof is straightforward and hence omitted.
14:435:30160:33:18:88:535:629:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:If investors in period0think that the workers labor supply isN1= 1and hence the dividend per

14:437:30340:18:18:71:535:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:irrelevant. The competition in the nancial market then drivesP0=R1=-N1--1=-. Under
14:438:30423:18:18:71:533:575:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:such a price the workers can learn nothing abouta2from the capital price, and thus by equation
14:439:30517:18:18:71:534:557:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(10) their labor supply is determined by the unconditional mean ofA2, which by our assumption
14:440:30610:18:21:71:519:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is one. Hence,N1= 1orlogN1= 0. Again, the investors initial belief thatN1= 1is veried.
14:441:30698:21:31:88:418:518:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:For the non-revealing equilibrium, the outputs in periods 1 and 2 are

14:443:30788:31:39:71:83:456:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and

14:447:30876:28:18:71:534:328:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We now show that there are other types of equilibria in our model. Wecall them sentiment-driven
14:448:30971:18:18:71:537:310:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:equilibria.  Suppose that the investors in the nancial market also observe a non-fundamental

14:450:31151:18:18:71:539:274:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:B:a2are independent.  That is, the information set in period0becomes\nj0=fP0;a2;zg= \n0.

15:474:31705:33:18:88:537:604:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:When investors perceive thatlogN1=-a2+z, they believe that the dividend per unit capital,
15:475:31794:18:18:71:533:586:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:B:R1, is a¤ected not only by the fundamental shocka2but also by the sentimentz. Competition in
15:476:31886:18:18:71:537:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the nancial market in period 0 will then drive the price toP0=R1=-N1--1. With this price,
15:477:31976:18:18:71:534:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:investors are happy to trade. However, for the workers, the priceP0now only partially reveals the
15:478:32073:18:18:71:539:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:fundamental shocka2. The workers face a signal extraction problem  using the price to forecasta2.
15:479:32171:18:18:71:534:514:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The actual labor supply will then be a function ofP0. The size of the fundamental shock relative to
15:480:32270:18:18:71:535:496:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the sentiment shock has to satisfy some restrictions so that the actual labor supply of the workers
15:481:32369:18:18:71:533:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is exactly the same as investors think it would be. This explains condition (16). When condition
15:482:32465:18:18:71:536:460:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(16) holds, the initial belief of the investors thatlogN1=-a2+zis veried. To see this, by (10),

15:493:32751:13:18:72:536:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Therefore,P0andN1as dened in equations (14) and (15) indeed constitute a rational expectations
15:494:32846:18:20:71:125:388:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:equilibrium.
15:495:32858:20:32:88:486:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:For the sentiment-driven equilibria, the outputs in periods 1 and 2are, respectively,

15:500:33123:18:18:71:534:240:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:beauty contests and animal spirits. What matters to an individual investor is not his own

15:502:33309:17:18:71:535:205:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the actions of other investors, as in a standard beauty contest game. Thiscomes about because
15:503:33402:18:18:71:535:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of the feedback from the rst stage (period 0) to the second stage (period 1), which generates en-
15:504:33500:18:18:71:535:169:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:dogenous complementarities between actions of investors. At the same time, the sentiment shocks

15:506:33692:18:18:71:535:133:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:aggregate output as if they were driven by animal spirits. A long traditionin macroeconomics has
15:507:33790:18:18:71:533:115:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:resorted to models that feature multiple equilibria to explain the observed animal spirits-styled
15:508:33889:18:0:71:535:97:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:uctuations. In our model, sentiment-based asset prices with informational feedback drive multiple

16:510:34005:21:18:88:537:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Three remarks on the sentiment-driven equilibria are in order. First, in our model, the capital
16:511:34100:18:18:71:536:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:priceP0is always equal to the dividendR1in period1(no arbitrage). Nevertheless, sentiment-
16:512:34190:18:18:71:535:652:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:driven equilibria exist because sentiments can endogenously drive the dividendR1in period1.15
16:513:34283:18:18:71:531:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Figure 3 illustrates the continuum of sentiment-driven equilibria. The fully-revealing equilibrium
16:514:34381:18:18:71:537:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and the non-revealing equilibrium analyzed in the previous two subsections are two special cases of
16:515:34480:18:18:71:534:598:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the sentiment-driven equilibria. Note that sentiment-driven equilibria exist for-z2(0;-2-a], which
16:516:34578:18:238:71:419:580:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:means that sentiment-driven equilibria are more likely when-ais higher.

16:528:34932:24:15:80:537:239:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:13In our model setup with asymmetric periods of consumption (of investors and workers), there are two frictions:
16:529:35044:15:11:71:534:224:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:the limited participation friction as in a typical OLG modeland the informational friction. If we focus on the second
16:530:35161:11:11:71:535:213:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:friction only, we are able to prove that the second-best constrained e¢ciency corresponds to the fully-revealing
16:531:35273:11:11:71:536:202:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:equilibrium and the sentiment-driven equilibria are welfare reducing, which gives the welfare implication of the
16:532:35385:11:7:71:188:191:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:sentiment-driven uctuations.
16:533:35414:7:14:80:536:184:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:14In our model with a competitive nancial market, the investors are price-takers and the collusion among them is
16:534:35527:14:11:72:537:170:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:precluded. Empirically, in a large nancial market, collusion may be di¢cult. Nonetheless, for theoretical models of
16:535:35643:11:11:72:535:159:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:collusion in nancial markets on individual stocks, see Allen and Gale (1992) and also Peck (2014). For recent work
16:536:35758:11:11:72:534:148:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:related to ours that also excludes collusion see, for example, Hellwig and Veldkamp (2009), Angeletos, Lorenzoni and
16:537:35874:11:8:72:304:137:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:Pavan (2010) and Goldstein, Ozdenoren and Yuan (2013).
16:538:35928:8:14:80:535:129:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:15Sentiment-driven equilibria would not be possible if the labor supply is assumed to be constant or exogenously
16:539:36040:14:11:71:535:115:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:given. To see this, let us assume thatN1= 1without loss of generality. Equation (11) then immediatelyimplies a
16:540:36150:11:11:71:535:104:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:unique priceP0=-. This di¤ers from Benhabib and Wang (2013), where the sentiment can drive the asset price to
16:541:36259:11:0:71:218:93:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:diverge from its underlying dividend.
17:542:36298:0:18:71:534:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:which is monotonically increasing in-.  Hence, if the continuum of equilibria in Proposition 3
17:543:36392:18:21:71:491:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(Figure 3) are indexed by-2[0;-], we can rank them in terms of price informativeness.
17:544:36477:21:18:88:535:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Third, it is worth noting that trading based on sentiments in our model is di¤erent from noise
17:545:36571:18:18:71:533:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:trading in at least two aspects. i) Noise traders are irrational and unaware of their mistakes. In
17:546:36669:18:18:71:535:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:contrast, the investors in our model are fully rational. Although they are aware that a sentiment
17:547:36766:18:18:71:534:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:shock is non-fundamental, it is optimal for them to trade on the shock if their peers choose to do
17:548:36864:18:18:71:534:598:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:so. ii) Noise trading volatility is exogenous and can be arbitrary. By contrast, sentiment volatility
17:549:36965:18:0:71:341:580:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f7:B:in our model has an endogenous upper limit, i.e.,-2z--

17:553:37023:7:18:353:485:577:8:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:A:aas shown in Proposition 3.
17:554:37050:18:18:88:534:559:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f2:A:Role of the assumptionsHere we discuss two assumptions in our model. First, informed
17:555:37134:18:18:71:535:541:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:investors are short-lived and they have long-lived information. This assumption is made mainly for
17:556:37232:18:18:71:534:523:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the purpose of introducing the OLG model later in a consistent setup.16Allen, Morris and Shin
17:557:37325:18:18:71:536:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(2006) provide detailed explanations and motivation for this assumption. Inthe context of our
17:558:37418:18:18:71:537:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:model, the reason for making this assumption is even stronger. The investors are the initial capital
17:559:37518:18:17:71:536:469:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:holders; naturally they may have some advance information abouta2. More importantly, nancial
17:560:37611:17:18:71:535:452:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:markets can aggregate the dispersed information of investors (Grossman and Stiglitz (1980)). We
17:561:37706:18:18:71:534:434:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:will show in the next section that the investors in our model do not need to have perfect information
17:562:37807:18:18:71:534:416:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:or an information advantage over the workers.  Second, we assume a Cobb-Douglas production

17:566:38102:32:18:71:530:307:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In the baseline model, we assumed a simple information structure tohighlight the core mechanism
17:567:38197:18:18:71:533:289:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of our model. In this section, we generalize our information structure along several dimensions and
17:568:38296:18:14:71:213:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:show that our result is robust.
17:569:38327:14:15:80:535:257:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:16For our baseline model, we can instead assume that investorsare long-lived and their consumption occurs in
17:570:38435:15:11:71:536:242:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:period 2. This would not change the result of our model under the reasonable assumption that limited commitment
17:571:38546:11:11:71:534:231:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:frictions prevent trades between the investors and the workers before workers make their labor decision and obtain
17:572:38660:11:10:71:536:220:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:labor income in period 1. Note that investors capital in period 0 fully depreciates in period 1 and is not carried over
17:573:38780:10:11:71:536:210:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:to period 2. Formally, if investors consume in period 2, an investors optimal capital trading decision in period0is

17:586:39308:14:11:71:535:143:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:It is easy to see that the fully-revealing equilibrium and the non-revealing equilibrium will always exist.  For the
17:587:39424:11:11:71:534:132:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:sentiment-driven equilibria, only the direction might be di¤erent, i.e., the relationship between the asset price and

18:590:39678:28:18:71:534:681:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:So far, we have assumed that investors have perfect information about fundamental shocka2and
18:591:39770:18:18:71:536:663:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sentiment shockz. We now allow for dispersed information. Specically, the information set of
18:592:39863:18:18:71:534:645:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:investorjis assumed to be\nj0=fP0;a2+"j; z+-jg, wherea2+"jis his private signal abouta2and
18:593:39953:18:18:71:536:627:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:B:z+-jis his private signal about sentimentz. It is also assumed that"j-N(0;-2"),-j-N(0;-2-),
18:594:40044:18:21:71:413:609:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:B:cov("j;-j) = 0, and that"jas well as-jis independent across investors.
18:595:40114:21:18:88:535:588:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Under this setup, we can immediately conclude that Propositions 1 and 3 still hold based on the
18:596:40209:18:18:71:534:570:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:concept of rational expectations equilibrium (REE).18In fact, under the e¢cient market price
18:597:40303:18:18:71:535:552:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:given in (14) that already fully reects-a2+z, any noise (i.e.,"jand-j) on top ofa2andzhave

18:599:40485:18:18:71:534:516:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the nancial market, they do not need to condition their decisionson their private information
18:600:40582:18:21:71:438:498:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:as the market price is informative enough compared with their private signal.
18:601:40659:21:18:88:536:477:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The question, however, is where the e¢cient price comes from in the rst place. Such REEs
18:602:40750:18:18:71:536:459:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:raise a natural question about equilibrium implementability (see,e.g., Vives (2014) for more dis-
18:603:40847:18:17:71:535:441:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cussions).  Traders do not condition their demand and supply on their private information, yet
18:604:40941:17:18:71:537:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the market price somehow magically aggregates their private information and becomes e¢cient.
18:605:41033:18:18:71:535:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In what follows, we study the implementation of the sentiment-driven equilibrium as well as the
18:606:41128:18:21:71:392:388:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:fully-revealing equilibrium under dispersed information of investors.
18:607:41197:21:18:88:536:367:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We adopt the approach proposed by Vives (2014) (also used in Benhabib and Wang (2013)).
18:608:41284:18:18:71:534:349:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Unlike in a classic REE trading game where a trader submits his demand conditional on both the
18:609:41378:18:18:71:534:331:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:B:market price and his private signal, in Vives trading game, a trader submitshisdemand function
18:610:41473:18:18:71:533:313:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:B:(schedule)conditional on his private signal only, and then the market auctioneer collects the demand
18:611:41573:18:21:71:397:295:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:schedules from all traders and sets a price that can clear the market.
18:612:41643:21:18:88:534:274:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:To tailor to the setting of private valuations in Vives (2014), we make an additional but weak
18:613:41737:18:18:71:533:256:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:assumption. Beside the dividendR1, a scrap value or private benet in proportion toR1is derived
18:614:41832:18:18:71:537:238:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:when investors hold capital to period 1, in the spirit of Holmstrom and Tirole (1997). Specically,
18:615:41931:18:18:71:539:220:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the gain per unit of capital that investorjobtains by holding that capital to period 1 isR1euj,

19:674:43366:33:18:88:535:309:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The equilibrium outcome in Proposition 4 is essentially the same as that inProposition 3. The
19:675:43459:18:17:71:536:291:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:di¤erence is that now there is an explicit mechanism for aggregating the dispersed information of
19:676:43556:17:18:71:534:274:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:investors into the asset price, which in turn inuences the decision of workers. The equilibria are
19:677:43655:18:18:71:535:256:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:still self-fullling. Depending on investors expectation ofp0(i.e., the extent to which the market

20:736:45841:28:18:88:535:147:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The intuition behind Proposition 5 is similar to that behind Proposition3. When workers decide
20:737:45935:18:18:71:536:129:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on their labor supply, they need to forecasta2=aI2+aH2. They can infera2from three pieces of
20:738:46027:18:18:71:534:111:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:information: nancial priceP0, wageW1and their own signalsi1=aH2+vi. WageW1e¢ciently
20:739:46111:18:20:71:536:93:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:aggregates all private signals,si1, to clear the labor market. This can be understood by noting that

20:745:46250:12:0:279:535:73:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:, which only depends on the wage. The worker labor
21:746:46302:0:18:71:536:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:supply is characterized by some functionNs1such thatNsi1=Ns1(W1;aH2+vi;P0). The market

21:750:46471:18:21:71:427:673:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:functionNs1. Since workers knowP0, they can inferaH2perfectly fromW1.
21:751:46540:21:18:88:535:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We can further generalize the information structure by allowing investors and workers signals
21:752:46635:18:18:71:533:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:aboutA2to be correlated.  In addition, we can allow workers to also receive some information
21:753:46727:18:18:71:536:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:about sunspots and their signals on sunspots to be correlated with thoseof investors.  Speci-

21:797:48378:18:16:71:534:98:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:possibility of asymmetric equilibria, which can be appealing for exampleif prices are generally more

22:800:48611:18:18:71:537:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a small change in economic fundamentals (see, e.g., the evidence documented by Culter, Poterba,
22:801:48706:18:18:71:535:673:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and Summers (1989)). Several studies (e.g., Yuan (2005) and Barlevy and Veronesi (2003)) have
22:802:48799:18:18:71:536:655:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:attempted to explain this asymmetric and nonlinear response in asset prices in a framework of
22:803:48892:18:18:71:534:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:informational frictions in an exchange economy. We now show that our sentiment-driven equilibria
22:804:48988:18:21:71:476:619:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:can also generate such asymmetric responses in asset prices in a production economy.
22:805:49072:21:18:88:530:598:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:To illustrate the intuition, we rst consider a simple case. We conjecture that the equilibrium
22:806:49167:18:39:71:213:580:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:price takes the following form:

22:822:49373:13:17:71:535:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:thatlogP0<log-i¤a2<0.  So, from the pricelogP0given by (24), the workers can infer
22:823:49455:17:18:71:534:461:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:perfectly whethera2<0or not.  We now verify that the price given by (24) indeed forms a
22:824:49542:18:18:71:536:443:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rational expectation equilibrium. After observing the pricelogP0-log-, the workers can infer
22:825:49634:18:18:71:535:425:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:thata2= (logP0-log-)=((1--)-). In this case, the workers face no uncertainty and hence their
22:826:49726:18:18:71:534:407:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:labor supply islogN1=-a2according to equation (10). By (11), the asset price is hence given by
22:827:49820:18:18:71:535:389:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(24). On the other hand, if the workers see that the nancial price is belowlog-, they know for

22:838:50114:18:18:71:535:328:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:By (11), the asset price is hence veried to be (24). To summarize, whena2-0the equilibrium is
22:839:50208:18:21:71:359:310:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:fully revealing; whena2<0the equilibrium is non-revealing.
22:840:50266:21:18:88:533:289:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Despite its simplicity, the above example provides two general insights. First, by construction
22:841:50361:18:18:72:535:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the price is more informative when the fundamentals are strong. Second, the price is discontinuous
22:842:50459:18:18:72:534:253:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the fundamental value measured bya2. There is a discrete jump arounda2= 0. That is, a large
22:843:50553:18:21:71:520:235:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:fall in the asset price occurs with a small decrease ina2arounda2= 0if(1--)-or-ais big.
22:844:50640:21:18:88:534:214:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Now we consider non-linear asymmetric sentiment-driven equilibria. Again,we are interested
22:845:50730:18:22:72:173:196:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in an equilibrium with

22:852:50891:18:18:72:535:125:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:such an equilibrium lies in that both the distribution function ofzand the price functionp(-)have

23:857:51291:18:18:71:533:628:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is impossible to give a complete characterization of all nonlinear asymmetric equilibria. And in
23:858:51387:18:18:71:533:610:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:general, the equilibrium price function will not permit a closed-form solution. Hence, we focus on

24:928:53226:28:18:72:536:499:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:A large empirical literature has documented contagion in asset price movements (see Yuan (2005)
24:929:53321:18:18:72:536:481:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for a discussion of the ndings in the literature). In particular, empirical evidence suggests that con-

24:954:54742:21:18:88:534:144:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We assume that country0(for example, the U.S.) is special in that its nancial price may

26:1035:57071:18:18:71:533:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:With this belief, investors in countryjwill ignore local shocka2`and try to short capital when
26:1036:57165:18:18:71:535:673:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:they see a fall in the asset price in the U.S. caused by idiosyncratic shocka20. They will therefore
26:1037:57265:18:18:71:533:655:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:push down the capital price in countryj, as these investors are afraid that workers in their country
26:1038:57365:18:18:71:533:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:will reduce their labor supply and thus lower the return on capital. When the workers see a fall in

26:1040:57566:18:18:71:535:601:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:B:g, leading them to reduce the actual labor supply. So investors perception of synchronization leads
26:1041:57666:18:21:71:192:583:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to actual synchronization.
26:1042:57692:21:18:88:536:562:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In Appendix B, we also provide an asymmetric sentiment-driven equilibrium that exhibits con-
26:1043:57784:18:41:72:102:544:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tagion.
26:1044:57791:41:32:72:209:503:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:6  The OLG Model
26:1045:57807:32:18:72:535:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In this section, we extend our baseline model to the OLG framework. We show that our sentiment-
26:1046:57902:18:18:72:537:453:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:driven equilibria are robust to a dynamic setting, and we derive additional economic insights.
26:1047:57996:18:18:72:534:435:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:First, the OLG model provides a dynamic equilibrium setting to study the process of saving and
26:1048:58090:18:17:72:535:417:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:capital accumulation. As in the baseline model, we study the sentiment-driven rational expectations
26:1049:58189:17:18:72:535:400:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:equilibria. The di¤erence lies in the dynamic setting where the current savings of workers become
26:1050:58286:18:18:72:534:382:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the capital stock in the subsequent period.  The capital stock therefore is dynamically linked
26:1051:58380:18:18:72:534:364:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:across periods through savings. Its accumulation, as well as output and employment, is therefore
26:1052:58476:18:18:72:535:346:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:driven not only by the private future productivity signals received by investors, but also by their
26:1053:58575:18:18:72:536:328:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sentiments. Second, the OLG model delivers novel implications for asset prices over the business
26:1054:58671:18:21:72:100:310:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cycles.
26:1055:58678:21:33:88:321:289:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f2:A:TimelineIn each periodt, there are ve stages:

26:1059:58999:18:27:99:185:202:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:in the next period.
26:1060:59018:27:18:71:536:175:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f2:B:Stage 2:(Capital trading among capitalists) Capitalists trade capital among themselves in a -

26:1064:59366:27:18:71:535:95:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f2:B:Stage 3:(Production) Based on their capital stock, wageWtand productivityAt, capitalists hire
26:1065:59459:18:0:99:535:77:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:workers and produce. By inferring information aboutAt+1from pricesPtandWt, workers
27:1066:59543:0:27:99:232:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:decide on their labor supply.
27:1067:59572:27:18:71:534:682:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f2:B:Stage 4:(Consumption) Capitalists obtain their production revenue net of labor cost, clear the

27:1070:59840:27:18:71:531:619:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f2:B:Stage 5:(Savings of workers) Workers can save their labor income in bonds or investin capital. A

27:1072:60026:18:18:99:535:583:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:use their labor income to purchase the bond or short the bond. The balance oftheir income
27:1073:60115:18:18:99:534:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:is invested in capital for the next period. The net supply of the bond is0. The economy
27:1074:60202:18:33:99:287:547:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:repeats stages 1 to 5 in the next period.

27:1090:60823:18:18:72:535:335:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Instead, a capitalist (investor) directly hires workers to produce. This is equivalent to the case
27:1091:60921:18:18:72:534:317:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:where each capitalist owns one rm which hires workers to produce. The value of the rm is the

31:1339:67121:21:33:71:179:216:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f3:C:Proof.See Appendix.
31:1340:67140:33:18:88:533:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The intuition behind Proposition 7 is similar to that in our baseline model. Whileat+1directly
31:1341:67234:18:18:71:534:165:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a¤ects the workers return on savings, its e¤ect on existing capitalists (the old generation) is only
31:1342:67335:18:17:71:534:147:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:through an indirect general equilibrium channel. If high sentimentslead capitalists to speculate
31:1343:67431:17:18:71:534:130:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that the output and hence the demand for capital will be high in periodt, competition will drive
31:1344:67527:18:18:72:534:112:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:up the capital pricePt. After observing a high pricePt, the workers in periodtwill need to solve a
31:1345:67625:18:18:71:534:94:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:signal extraction problem, leading them to attribute the high pricePtpartially to high productivity
31:1346:67724:18:0:71:536:76:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the next period. High productivity in the next period increases their incentive to supply labor
32:1347:67824:0:18:71:534:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the current period. So output and the demand for capital will indeed be high in periodt. The
32:1348:67919:18:21:72:355:691:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:initial conjecture of the existing capitalists is thus veried.22
32:1349:67984:21:18:88:535:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Three remarks on the OLG equilibrium are in order. First, if we set-z= 0, then-has two
32:1350:68070:18:18:71:535:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f4:B:solutions,0and^-. It is easy to verify that the fully-revealing equilibrium (corresponding to-z= 0
32:1351:68168:18:18:71:536:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and-=^-) and the non-revealing equilibrium (corresponding to-z= 0and-= 0) are two special
32:1352:68257:18:18:71:534:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cases of the sentiment-driven equilibria in Proposition 7.  Sentiment-driven equilibria are more
32:1353:68353:18:18:71:534:598:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:likely when-2ais higher. Second, the aggregate capital stock,kt, in our model has a stationary
32:1354:68447:18:31:71:322:580:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distribution. In fact, based on Proposition 7, we have
32:1355:68501:31:31:82:529:549:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:C:kt+1= [log(1--) + (1--)nc] + [1 + (1--)']at+ [-+ (1--)-]kt+ (1--) (-at+1+zt).
32:1356:68578:31:18:71:533:518:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We prove that- <1and therefore0< -+(1--)- <1(see the appendix). Third, the assumption
32:1357:68663:18:18:71:535:500:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of the utility function with risk neutrality versus risk aversion(i.e.,-= 1versus- <1) a¤ects the
32:1358:68760:18:18:71:536:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:equilibrium by altering the constant coe¢cientnconly but not the other coe¢cients (',-and-).
32:1359:68852:18:18:71:535:464:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In fact,-appears only in the constant termncin Proposition 7. The most important reason for
32:1360:68943:18:21:71:536:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:introducing the risk-averse utility is to derive the asset pricing implications, to be analyzed below.
32:1361:69045:21:36:88:368:425:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Now we proceed to discuss implications of the OLG model.
32:1362:69101:36:18:71:535:389:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f2:B:Implication 1: Persistence in business cyclesProposition 7 shows that i.i.d.  sentiment
32:1363:69188:18:18:71:535:371:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:shocks can generate persistent uctuations in output and unemployment. Concretely, a sentiment

32:1366:69460:18:18:71:533:317:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:across periods by capital accumulation,ztcan have a persistent e¤ect on asset prices, output and
32:1367:69556:18:36:71:141:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:unemployment.
32:1368:69569:36:18:71:536:263:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f2:B:Implication 2: Asset prices over business cycles (cross section)We derive the risk pre-

33:1398:70271:17:18:71:535:613:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:volatility. Our model hence gives a novel implication of sentiment volatility-driven risk premia, one
33:1399:70372:18:18:71:536:595:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that depends crucially on the mechanism of the feedback between nancial markets and the real
33:1400:70465:18:18:71:535:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:economy. Namely, the sentiments in nancial markets a¤ect the real economyand thus inuence
33:1401:70556:18:18:71:535:559:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:aggregate consumption and asset returns, which in turn impact the risk premium. Corollary 1 gives
33:1402:70653:18:18:71:536:541:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cross-sectional predictions. The model predicts that an economy with higher investor sentiment
33:1403:70747:18:18:71:534:523:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:volatility in nancial markets (i.e., higher-z) will have a higher risk premium in asset returns. The
33:1404:70848:18:18:71:535:505:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f6:B:intuition behind Corollary 1 is as follows. ReturnRt+1in the next periodt+ 1depends onat+1
33:1405:70938:18:18:71:531:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:andnt+1. In periodt, workers can infer information aboutat+1frompt,at,ktand e¤ectively from
33:1406:71029:18:18:71:536:469:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:B:-at+1+ztbut has no information aboutnt+1which is a function of-at+2+zt+1. So the conditional
33:1407:71121:18:18:71:535:451:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:variance ofRt+1depends on conditional varianceV ar([1 + (1--)']at+1j-at+1+zt)and variance

33:1409:71306:18:18:71:536:415:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and hence higher conditional variance ofRt+1, which leads to a bigger gap between the mean of
33:1410:71399:18:36:71:379:397:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:B:Rt+1and its certainty-equivalent value or a higher risk premium.

33:1412:71548:18:17:71:537:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(Proposition 7), the sentiment volatility (-z) and the risk aversion (-) are invariant across time.
33:1413:71647:17:18:71:536:326:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:So the risk premium is constant across time for a given equilibrium path.  A direct time-series
33:1414:71742:18:18:71:535:308:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:implication (based on Corollary 1) is, therefore, that if there is anunexpectedshock to sentiment
33:1415:71839:18:18:71:534:290:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:volatility in the nancial market (i.e., an increase in-z, for example in a nancial crisis), the risk
33:1416:71941:18:21:71:159:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:premium increases.
33:1417:71959:21:18:88:534:251:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Now we extend the OLG model to allow for regime changes and formally model time-varying risk
33:1418:72051:18:18:71:535:233:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:premia. To highlight the mechanism and for tractability, we consider three cases. First, we consider
33:1419:72151:18:18:71:535:215:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a deterministic process of time-varying sentiment volatility. Specically, we assume that sentiment

33:1426:72448:18:18:71:534:161:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:those in other three seasons. A possible reason for the seasonal variation in sentiment volatility
33:1427:72546:18:18:71:536:143:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is seasonal a¤ective disorder (SAD, also known as winter blues or winter depression), which is
33:1428:72640:18:18:71:531:125:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:linked closely with hours of daylight; experimental research in psychology has documented SAD
33:1429:72733:18:18:71:536:107:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:can generate depression. Kamstra, Kramer and Levi (2003) show clear evidence that the seasonal
33:1430:72827:18:18:71:530:89:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:SAD causes stock market seasonality. Under the above setup, we are able to derive closed-form
33:1431:72920:18:0:71:125:71:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:risk premia.

34:1446:73475:18:18:71:535:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Because of the feedback between the nancial market and the real economy,the season with higher

34:1448:73666:18:18:71:536:529:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the current period depends on not only the equilibrium in the current period but also the equi-

35:1499:76779:32:18:88:535:107:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In Corollary 4, it may not be surprising that the risk premium is higher when risk aversion is
35:1500:76873:18:18:71:536:89:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:higher. What we want to emphasize, however, is the amplication e¤ect ofsentiment volatility.

36:1506:77276:31:18:71:533:600:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In this paper, we study how the nancial sector can a¤ect the aggregate realeconomy through

36:1509:77559:18:18:71:537:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:feedback between the nancial sector and the real sector, a small sentiment shock in the nancial

36:1511:77748:18:18:71:536:510:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:equilibria also have implications for non-linear asset prices, discontinuity in asset prices, and cross-
