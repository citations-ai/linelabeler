2:25:726:24:12:76:534:514:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:This research provides a useful framework for identifying a small firms’ propensity to engage in 
2:26:823:12:11:76:535:502:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:entrepreneurial orientation. We examine the impact of the Entrepreneurial Orientation (EO) as a 
2:27:919:11:12:76:534:491:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:main  resource  and  capability  on  small  firm'  growth.  The  growth  seems  to  come  out  as  an 
2:28:1021:12:11:76:534:479:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:important  demonstration  of  the  entrepreneurial  orientation  of  small  firms  (Davidsson,  1989; 
2:29:1123:11:12:76:534:468:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:Green  and  Brown,  1997;  Janney  and  Gregory,  2006).  Thus,  this  research  builds  on  prior 
2:30:1222:12:11:76:535:456:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:conceptual  research  that  suggests  a  positive  integration  between  entrepreneurial  orientation 
2:31:1324:11:11:76:535:445:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:and resource-based view. In the first instance, the research will focus on reviewing literature in 
2:32:1423:11:12:76:534:434:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:the emerging area of entrepreneurial orientation as it applies to growth oriented small firms and 
2:33:1521:12:11:76:534:422:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:resource-based  view  of  the  firm.  Secondly,  an  empirical  study  was  developed  based  on  a 
2:34:1621:11:12:76:535:411:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:stratified  sample  of  small  firms  of  manufacturing  industry.  Data  were  submitted  to  a 
2:35:1718:12:11:76:535:399:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:multivariate statistical analysis and a linear regression model was performed in order to predict 
2:36:1816:11:12:76:534:388:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:the influence of the resources and capabilities on small firms' growth. In this sense, we consider 
2:37:1915:12:11:76:534:376:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:the  construct  growth  as  a  dependent  variable  and  the  ones  relates  with  resources  and 
2:38:2013:11:11:76:535:365:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:capabilities  (entrepreneur  resources,  firm  resources,  networks  and  EO)  as  independent 
2:39:2108:11:25:76:125:354:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:variables. 
2:40:2119:25:12:76:534:329:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:The research results suggest a set of resources and capabilities that promote the growth of the 
2:41:2215:12:11:76:534:317:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:small  firms.  Also,  the  EO  seems  to  have  a  predictive  value  on  growth.  Explaining  variables 
2:42:2320:11:11:76:534:306:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:related with resources and capabilities and  EO were identified as essential in growth oriented 
2:43:2416:11:12:76:534:295:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:small firms. It was still possible to conclude that the entrepreneurial firms which grew seem to 
2:44:2513:12:11:76:534:283:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:have  resources  and  develop  more  capabilities  and  take  advantage  in  the  search  for  those 
2:45:2614:11:25:76:352:272:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:competences. This attitude reflects on the EO of the firm. 
2:46:2673:25:11:76:535:247:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:This  study  has  important  implication  for  both  researchers  and  practitioners.  It  highlights  the 
2:47:2780:11:12:76:534:236:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:necessity  of  firms  to  develop  superior  EO  of  all  their  members  and  also  to  invest  on  better 
2:48:2888:12:11:76:537:224:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:resources and consequently superior capabilities as a way of reaching higher levels of growth. 
2:49:2983:11:11:76:534:213:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:While  previous  authors  have  attempted  to  analyse  certain  aspects  of  this  process  (linkage 
2:50:3085:11:12:76:534:202:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:between  entrepreneurial  orientation  and  growth),  this  research  developed  a  framework  that 
2:51:3185:12:11:76:534:190:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:combines  these  and  others  factors  (resource-based  view)  pertinent  to  growth  oriented  small 
2:52:3287:11:12:76:534:179:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:firms.  The  results  support  the  necessity  to  identify  explicative  variables  of  multiple  levels  to 
2:53:3397:12:11:76:534:167:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:explain  the  growth  of  small  firms.  The  adoption  of an  entrepreneurial  orientation  as  an 
2:54:3497:11:25:76:436:156:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:indispensable variable to the growth oriented small firms seems pertinent.

3:59:3672:11:17:76:535:696:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:Entrepreneurship area deals with an enlarged range of theories and approaches and it has been 
3:60:3766:17:18:76:534:679:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:studied  in  many  different  ways,  with  very  different  purposes.  Researchers  from  all  fields  of 
3:61:3872:18:17:76:535:661:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:social sciences – economics, sociology, anthropology, psychology, history, politics and several 
3:62:3968:17:17:76:535:644:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:branches of enterprising science – have been giving contributions to this area of studies. The 
3:63:4063:17:17:76:534:627:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:research  field  of  entrepreneurship  has  been  considered  to  be  the  target  of  the  most  diverse 
3:64:4169:17:17:76:535:610:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:areas  of  study  and  it  is  developing  very  fast  (Ronen,  1983;  Sexton  and  Bowman,  1987; 
3:65:4268:17:17:76:166:593:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:Davidsson, 1989).

3:67:4286:17:18:76:534:559:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:This research provides a useful framework for identifying a small firms’ propensity to engage in 
3:68:4383:18:17:76:534:541:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:Entrepreneurial Orientation (EO). The objective of this research is to examine the impact of the 
3:69:4480:17:17:76:534:524:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:EO on growth of the small firms. The approach of the current research had its origin in three 
3:70:4574:17:17:76:534:507:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:specific research questions: (1) Is it possible to identify crucial factors which increase or restrain 
3:71:4676:17:17:76:534:490:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:the growth of small firms? If so, which? (2) What is the influence of resources and capabilities in 
3:72:4776:17:17:76:501:473:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:this growing process? (3) What is the connection between EO and growth of small firms? 
3:73:4863:17:17:76:79:456:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B: 
3:74:4863:17:17:76:535:439:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:It seems essential to identify the strategic variables which may reflect the practice, the process, 
3:75:4963:17:18:76:535:422:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:the  organisational  methods  and  the  decision–making style  that  small  firms  use  and  that 
3:76:5061:18:17:76:535:404:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:probably influence their growth. Nevertheless, the strategy presents itself as a broad and large 
3:77:5158:17:17:76:534:387:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:concept and there  are  many different  definitions of  strategy  as well  as  typologies  of  possible 
3:78:5262:17:17:76:534:370:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:strategic  choices  in  small  firms.  To  identify  the  most  important  strategic  dimensions  in  small 
3:79:5370:17:17:76:534:353:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:firms, we may consider, as a starting point, the typologies of firm strategies suggested by the 
3:80:5466:17:17:76:534:336:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:theoretical authors about organisations. A variety of models in the developing of strategy can be 
3:81:5564:17:17:76:535:319:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:found in literature. Well-known models include:  (i) the generic strategies of Porter (1980); (ii) 
3:82:5663:17:18:76:534:302:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:the strategic typology of Miles and Snow (1978); (iii) the VRIO model of Barney (1991); and 
3:83:5755:18:17:76:535:284:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:(iv)  the  EO  of  Lumpkin  and  Dess  (1996).  Each  of  these  models  relates  a  group  of  variables 
3:84:5861:17:17:76:534:267:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:which do not depend on the growth. Besides this the Miles and Snow model (Hambrick, 1983; 
3:85:5951:17:17:76:534:250:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:Zahra and Pearce, 1994; Gimenez, 1999) and also Porter’s one (Miller, 1983) were empirically 
3:86:6044:17:17:76:249:233:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:tested to validate that relationship.  
3:87:6083:17:17:76:79:216:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B: 
3:88:6083:17:17:76:534:199:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:Several authors (Lippman and Rumelt, 1982; Jacobsen, 1988; Day and Wensley, 1988; Grant, 
3:89:6172:17:18:76:534:182:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:1991;  Barney,  1991;  Rumelt,  1991;  Amit  and  Schoemaker,  1993;  Day,  1994;  Finney et al.,

3:91:6363:17:17:76:535:147:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:RBV, they do it more in a strategic context, presenting resources and capabilities as essential to 
3:92:6462:17:17:76:509:130:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:gaining a sustained competitive advantage and, consequently, to a superior performance.

3:95:6646:17:0:76:535:79:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:of view considering a resource as a strength that firms can use to formulate and to implement 
4:96:6741:0:17:76:534:731:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:their  strategies.    The  resources  and  capabilities  of  the  firm  are  the  main  competences  for 
4:97:6846:17:17:76:248:714:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:formulating strategy (Grant, 1991).

4:99:6882:17:17:76:535:680:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:Previous  researches  consider  the  strategy  dimensions  of  great  importance  (Mintzberg,  1973; 
4:100:6983:17:17:76:534:663:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:Miller and Friesen, 1984; Miller, 1987; Lumpkin and Dess, 1996) and besides this they consider 
4:101:7078:17:17:76:534:646:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:that an EO has a great impact in growth. Miller and Friesen, (1982), claim that entrepreneurial 
4:102:7174:17:17:76:535:629:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:firms  innovate  courageously  and  regularly,  while  taking  considerable  risks  in  their 
4:103:7268:17:18:76:535:612:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:product/market  strategies.  Miller  (1983)  identifies  the  initiative  of  a  firm  concerning:  (i) 
4:104:7372:18:17:76:534:594:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:innovation;  (ii)  risk  taking;  and  (iii)  proactiveness,  as  the  essential  dimensions  of 
4:105:7469:17:17:76:534:577:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:entrepreneurship. For Miller (1983) an entrepreneurial firm is the one that commits itself into 
4:106:7565:17:17:76:534:560:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:the innovation of product/market, undertakes actions which are slightly risky and it is the first 
4:107:7663:17:17:76:423:543:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:one to come out with proactive innovation which beats the competitors.  
4:108:7735:17:17:76:79:526:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B: 
4:109:7735:17:17:76:534:509:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:These  three  dimensions,  which  constitute  entrepreneurship,  have  already  been  mentioned  by 
4:110:7835:17:17:76:535:492:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:Miller  and  Friesen  (1982)  as  the  three,  of  a  total of  eleven  dimensions,  of  the  process  of 
4:111:7941:17:18:76:535:475:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:strategic  decision-making which  confirms  that  Miller  conceives  entrepreneurship  from  a 
4:112:8035:18:17:76:534:457:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:strategic  approach.  This  definition,  concerning  the  entrepreneurial  strategy,  focuses  more  on 
4:113:8139:17:17:76:534:440:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:the  entrepreneurship  process,  than  on  the  actor  behind  it  (Wiklund,  1998;  Davidsson  and 
4:114:8239:17:17:76:531:423:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:Delmar, 1999), this is, it emphasises more the entrepreneurial process than the entrepreneur.

4:116:8334:17:17:76:535:389:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:This way, and according to Davidsson and Delmar (1999), the co-relations of entrepreneurship 
4:117:8427:17:18:76:535:372:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:could  be  searched  for  in  a  vaster  field  than  the  one  related  to  the  individual.  This  approach 
4:118:8537:18:17:76:534:354:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:reflects, largely, the traditional definitions at an individual level. An entrepreneur is, frequently, 
4:119:8639:17:17:76:534:337:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:considered as an innovative and creative person, suitable to manage a firm which emphasises 
4:120:8731:17:17:76:468:320:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:innovation (McClelland, 1961; Davidsson, 1989; Miner, 1990; Miner et al., 1994).

4:130:9317:17:17:76:535:149:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:frameworks in the management literature (Beard and Sumner, 2004; Runyan et al., 2006). The 
4:131:9408:17:17:76:535:132:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:foci of RBV are competitive advantages generated by the firm, from its unique set of resources 
4:132:9503:17:18:76:535:115:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:(Wernerfelt,  1984;  Barney,  1986,  1991;  Peteraf,  1993).  Understanding  sources  of  sustained 
4:133:9603:18:17:76:534:97:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:competitive advantage for firms has become a major area of research in the field of strategic 
4:134:9697:17:0:76:534:80:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:management (Wenerfelt, 1984; Porter, 1985; Barney, 1991; Grant, 1991). Since the 1960s a 
5:135:9787:0:17:76:535:731:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:single organising framework has been used to structure much of this research (Andrews, 1971; 
5:136:9880:17:17:76:150:714:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:Ansoff, 1965).

5:138:9896:17:17:76:534:680:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:Most research on sources of sustained competitive advantage has focused either on isolating a 
5:139:9990:17:17:76:534:663:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:firm’s opportunities and threats, describing its strengths and weaknesses (Ansoff, 1965; Porter, 
5:140:10087:17:17:76:534:646:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:1980),  or  analysing  how  these  are  matched  to  choose  strategies  (Penrose,  1959;  Hofer  and 
5:141:10189:17:17:76:534:629:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:Schendel, 1978).There is little doubt that this approach have been very fruitful in clarifying our 
5:142:10288:17:18:76:461:612:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:understanding of the impact of a firm’s environment on growth (Barney, 1991).  
5:143:10367:18:17:76:79:594:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B: 
5:144:10367:17:17:76:534:577:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:According to Barney (1991) Resource-Based View (RBV) to studying a firm’s internal strengths 
5:145:10460:17:17:76:534:560:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:and weaknesses rests on two fundamental assumptions. First, building on Penrose (1959), this 
5:146:10553:17:17:76:535:543:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:work assumes that firms can be thought of as bundles of productive resources and that different 
5:147:10649:17:17:76:534:526:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:firm  possesses  different  bundles  of  these  resources.  This  is  the  assumption  of  firm  resource 
5:148:10755:17:17:76:534:509:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:heterogeneity.  Second,  drawing  from  Selznick  (1957)  and  Ricardo  (1966),  this  approach 
5:149:10851:17:17:76:535:492:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:assumes that some of these resources are either very costly to copy or inelastic in supply. This 
5:150:10948:17:18:76:275:475:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:is the assumption of resource immobility. 
5:151:10990:18:17:76:79:457:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B: 
5:152:10990:17:17:76:534:440:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:The most salient characteristic of the RBV is focus in the internal forces of firm. This approach is 
5:153:11091:17:17:76:535:423:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:rather linked to the pioneering work of Penrose (1959) than any other. Recently there has been 
5:154:11186:17:17:76:535:406:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:a  reinforced  interest  in  role  of  firm  resources  as foundation  for  firm  strategy  (Grant,  1991; 
5:155:11293:17:17:76:535:389:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:Miller  and  Shamsie,  1996).    This  interest  reflects some  dissatisfaction  with  the  static, 
5:156:11393:17:18:76:534:372:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:equilibrium  framework  of  industrial  organisation  economics,  where  the  focus  was  in  the 
5:157:11491:18:17:76:534:354:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:relationship  between  the  strategy  and  the  external environment  (Grant,  1991).  Several 
5:158:11586:17:17:76:535:337:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:advances  have  occurred on different  strategic levels  and  all  of them  contributed to  what  has 
5:159:11688:17:17:76:535:320:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:been termed resource-based view. Basically, RBV descrives a firm in terms of the resources that 
5:160:11784:17:17:76:535:303:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:firm integrates. Penrose (1959) accentuates the condition of a firm not be just an unit, but also 
5:161:11882:17:17:76:534:286:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:a group of resources. Frequently, the term resource is limited to those attributes that enhance 
5:162:11978:17:17:76:534:269:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:efficiency and effectiveness of the firm (Wernerfelt, 1984). Miller and Shamsie (1996) refer that 
5:163:12076:17:17:76:535:252:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:resources  should  have  some  capability  to  generate  profits  or  to  avoid  losses.  A  general 
5:164:12177:17:18:76:534:235:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:resources’ availability it will neutralize the firm’ competitive advantage. Once, for a firm to take 
5:165:12278:18:17:76:534:217:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:high  levels  of  performance  and  a  sustained  competitive  advantage,  it  needs  to  acquire 
5:166:12376:17:17:76:535:200:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:heterogeneous resources that should be difficult to create, to substitute or to imitate by other 
5:167:12473:17:17:76:113:183:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:firms.   
5:168:12482:17:17:76:86:166:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:   
5:169:12485:17:17:76:535:149:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:Resources can be tangible or intangible in nature. Tangible resources include capital, access to 
5:170:12582:17:17:76:534:132:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:capital  and  location  (among  others).  Intangible  resources  consist  of  knowledge,  skills  and 
5:171:12684:17:18:76:534:115:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:reputation, entrepreneurial orientation, among others (Runyan et al., 2006). In this sense, this 
5:172:12781:18:17:76:535:97:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:theory defends that, under imperfection of markets exists a diversity of firms and a variation in 
5:173:12879:17:17:76:534:80:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:the  specialisation  degrees  that  provokes  a  limited transfer  of  resources  which  present  type, 
5:174:12983:17:0:76:535:63:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:magnitude and different nature (Amit and Schoemaker, 1993). Therefore, the main reason for 
6:175:13075:0:17:76:534:731:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:firms grow and have success can be found inside of the firms, that is, firms with resources and 
6:176:13171:17:17:76:535:714:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:superior  capabilities  will  build  up  a  basis  for  gaining  and  sustaining  competitive  advantage 
6:177:13276:17:17:76:162:697:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:(Peteraf, 1993).

6:181:13480:17:17:76:534:629:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:competitive advantage and a high performance well. According to them, this is possible only if 
6:182:13575:17:18:76:535:612:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:the  firms  are  able  to  transform  resources  in  capabilities,  and  consequently  in  a  positive 
6:183:13678:18:17:76:534:594:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:performance  (Mahoney  and  Pandian,  1992).  Penrose  (1959)  refers  that  the  firms  reach  a 
6:184:13776:17:17:76:534:577:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:superior performance, not because only they have more or better resources, but also because 
6:185:13868:17:17:76:534:560:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:of  their  distinctive  competences  (those  activities that  a  particular  firm  does  better  than  any 
6:186:13975:17:17:76:324:543:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:competing firms) allow to do better use of them.

6:193:14531:17:17:76:537:423:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:1997); (7) location resources (Greene et al., 1997); (8) assets (Day, 1994; Barney, 1991; Amit

6:197:14741:18:17:76:534:354:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:Regarding the capabilities, they are considered, for some authors, not only as firm’s resources 
6:198:14837:17:17:76:535:337:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:but also as competences (Penrose, 1959; Hitt and Ireland, 1986; Prahalad and Hamel, 1990; 
6:199:14927:17:17:76:535:320:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:Leonard-Barton,  1992;  Pavitt,  1991)  and  invisible  assets  (Itami,  1987).  The  concept  of 
6:200:15025:17:17:76:535:303:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:capabilities  is  frequently  used  to  define  a  group  of  individual  qualifications,  assets  and 
6:201:15128:17:17:76:535:286:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:accumulated knowledge, exercised through organizational processes allowing reaching a better 
6:202:15221:17:17:76:534:269:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:coordination  of  activities  and  a  better  use  of  resources  (Amit  and  Schoemaker,  1993;  Day, 
6:203:15324:17:17:76:184:252:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:1994, Schulze, 1994).

6:205:15346:18:17:76:534:217:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:There  is  a  key  distinction  between  resources  and  capabilities.  Resources  are  inputs  into  the 
6:206:15452:17:17:76:534:200:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:production  process  –  they  are  the  basic  units  of  analysis  (Grant,  1991;  Beard  and  Sumner, 
6:207:15556:17:17:76:535:183:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:2004).  The  individual  resources  of  the  firm  include  items  of  capital  equipment,  intellectual 
6:208:15661:17:17:76:534:166:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:assets, patents, brand names, and so on. A capability is the capacity for a team of resources to 
6:209:15758:17:17:76:535:149:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:perform some task or activity (Hitt et al., 2003). While resources are the source of the firm’s 
6:210:15854:17:17:76:534:132:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:capabilities, capabilities are the main source of its competitive advantage.  For Barney (1991) 
6:211:15950:17:18:76:425:115:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:these distinctions can be drawn in theory, but quite confused in practice. 
6:212:16025:18:17:76:79:97:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B: 
6:213:16025:17:17:76:534:80:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:The  capabilities  are  many  times  developed  either  in  functional  areas  or  in  combination  of 
6:214:16128:17:0:76:534:63:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:physical,  humans  or  technological  resources,  controlled  by  the  firm  (Amit  and  Schoemaker, 
7:215:16230:0:17:76:535:731:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:1993).  Capabilities  together  with  the  resources  are  the  core  competences  on  firm’s  strategy 
7:216:16334:17:17:76:535:714:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:formulation and therefore constitute the firm’s identity (Grant, 1991).  In fact, as refer Bogaert, 
7:217:16434:17:17:76:534:697:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f8:B:et al. (1994) how more capability is used, more it can be refined and more hard is to copy. This 
7:218:16531:17:17:76:534:680:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:characteristic reflects the dynamic perspective associated to the capabilities (Nelson, 1991). In 
7:219:16629:17:17:76:534:663:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:the dynamic perspective, capabilities approach is a theoretical stream inside  of the RBV. This 
7:220:16725:17:17:76:535:646:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:theory  considers  that,  on  one  side,  the  firms  are  constantly  creating  new  combinations  of 
7:221:16828:17:17:76:534:629:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:capabilities  and,  on  other  hand;  the  market  competitors  are  continually  improving  their 
7:222:16927:17:18:76:534:612:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:competences or imitating the most qualified competences from other firms. This approach puts 
7:223:17020:18:17:76:535:594:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:emphasis on internal processes, assets and market position as restricting factors not only the 
7:224:17115:17:17:76:535:577:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:capability to react but also the management capability to coordinating internal competences of 
7:225:17210:17:17:76:256:560:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:the firms (Teece and Pisano, 1994).   
7:226:17248:17:17:76:86:543:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:   
7:227:17251:17:17:76:534:526:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:In  addition,  some  authors  (Granstrand et  al.,  1997)  give  special  attention  to  technological 
7:228:17354:17:17:76:534:509:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:competences  as  an  important  factor  to  influence,  not  only  the  sales’  growth,  but  also  the 
7:229:17458:17:17:76:534:492:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:businesses’  diversification  and  performance.    According  to  Grant  (1991)  the  managers  must 
7:230:17559:17:18:76:535:475:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:select an appropriate strategy in order to use more effectively the resources and the capabilities 
7:231:17658:18:17:76:141:457:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:of the firms.  
7:232:17673:17:17:76:79:440:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B: 
7:233:17673:17:17:76:535:423:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:In this sense, it is pointed out the following question: what extent the resources and the central 
7:234:17772:17:17:76:541:406:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:capabilities  are  identified  and  applied  in  a  strategic  way  to  create  a  competitive  advantage?   
7:235:17881:17:17:76:534:389:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:Barney (1991) developed the VRIO model structured in a series of four questions to be asked 
7:236:17973:17:18:76:535:372:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:about the business activities a firm engages in: (1) the question of Values; (2) the question of 
7:237:18070:18:17:76:534:354:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:Rarity;  (3)  the  question  of  Imitability;  and  (4)  the  question  of  Organisation.  The  answers  to 
7:238:18178:17:17:76:535:337:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:these  questions  determine  whether  a  particular  firm  resource  or  capability  is  a  strength  or 
7:239:18283:17:17:76:470:320:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:weakness. The VRIO model describes ways that firms can expect to be successful. 
7:240:18363:17:17:76:79:303:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B: 
7:241:18363:17:17:76:534:286:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:Competitive value of the resources can be enhanced or annulled by changes in the technology, 
7:242:18456:17:17:76:535:269:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:by changes in the competitor’s behaviour, or by changes in the buyers' needs. All these aspects 
7:243:18552:17:17:76:535:252:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:would  be  neglectful  whether  the  analysis  focus  was only  centred  in  the  internal  resources 
7:244:18654:17:18:76:534:235:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:(Porter,  1985).  According  to  Chandler  and  Hanks  (1994)  resources  and  capabilities  create  a 
7:245:18757:18:17:76:535:217:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:satisfactory base for formulating competitive strategies. An important factor that assures a long 
7:246:18855:17:17:76:534:200:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:term  competitive  advantage  is  the  sustainability  of  the  firm’s  capabilities  or  their  core 
7:247:18957:17:17:76:535:183:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:competences (Chandler and Hanks, 1994; Aliouat and Masclef, 1999). Sustained capabilities are 
7:248:19051:17:17:76:534:166:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:those that are not easy or quickly reproduced by the competitors and must form the base of 
7:249:19142:17:17:76:534:149:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:firm’s strategy. These resources and capabilities are the key for the achievement of competitive 
7:250:19239:17:17:76:535:132:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:advantage  and  should  be  protected.  Being  so,  they  have  a  critical  role  in  the  competitive 
7:251:19343:17:0:76:165:115:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:strategy of firms.

8:255:19402:11:17:76:534:686:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:It is hard to  imagine a small firm taking advantage  of  opportunity and having a considerable 
8:256:19498:17:18:76:535:669:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:impact in the market without growing.  According to Garnsey et al. (2006) the advantages of 
8:257:19590:18:17:76:534:651:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:early growth are internal (learning effects) and well as external (market position). In this sense, 
8:258:19690:17:17:76:534:634:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:the growth seems to come out as an important demonstration of the entrepreneurial behaviour 
8:259:19782:17:17:76:534:617:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:of small firms (Davidsson, 1989; Green and  Brown, 1997). Firm’s growth  has become a very 
8:260:19873:17:17:76:534:600:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:important  topic  in  the  field  of  strategic  research.  Davidsson et  al.  (2002)  discuss  in  what 
8:261:19978:17:17:76:535:583:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:conditions  the  study  of  the  growth  contributes  effectively  to  the  understanding  of  the 
8:262:20077:17:17:76:535:566:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:entrepreneurship process. According to these authors, to say that entrepreneurship is the same 
8:263:20172:17:17:76:538:549:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:as creation of a new firm is to reduce the field of entrepreneurship, since it does not reflect, in a 
8:264:20274:17:18:76:535:532:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:complete way, its contemporaneous definitions. Then they suggest that the researchers in this 
8:265:20368:18:17:76:516:514:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:field should see the growth of a firm as a complement part of the entrepreneurship process.

8:267:20460:17:17:76:535:480:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:About  the  process  of  growth  in  the  small  firm,  Storey  (1994)  concludes  that  process  results 
8:268:20566:17:17:76:535:463:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:from  a  combination  of  three  basic  components  which are:  (1)  the  characteristics  of  the 
8:269:20665:17:17:76:534:446:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:entrepreneur; (2) the characteristics of the small firm;  (3) the development strategies of the 
8:270:20761:17:17:76:535:429:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:firm. These three components are not mutually exclusive and they influence the growth of small 
8:271:20856:17:17:76:534:412:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:firms  in  a  combined  way.  When  studying  the  strategy  of  small  firms  and  in  particular  the 
8:272:20960:17:18:76:534:395:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:strategic  choices,  which  can  influence  the  growth, it  looks  pertinent  to  discuss  about  the 
8:273:21063:18:17:76:535:377:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:dimensions of EO. Miller (1983: 770) suggests that an entrepreneurial firm is one that “engages 
8:274:21158:17:17:76:538:360:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:in product market innovativeness, undertakes somewhat risky ventures, and first to come  up 
8:275:21250:17:17:76:535:343:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:with proactive innovations, beating competitors to the punch. A non-entrepreneurial firm is one 
8:276:21346:17:17:76:535:326:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:that innovates very little, is highly risk adverse, and imitates the moves of competitors instead 
8:277:21444:17:17:76:174:309:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:of leading the way.” 
8:278:21465:17:17:76:79:292:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B: 
8:279:21465:17:18:76:535:275:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:Miller (1983) developed a measuring instrument to capture the dimensions of EO in empirical 
8:280:21557:18:17:76:534:257:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:research. This measuring instrument has influence the subsequent research. Although the same 
8:281:21650:17:17:76:534:240:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:measuring instrument is used, different designations are used to measure the same dimensions. 
8:282:21744:17:17:76:534:223:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f9:B:Besides, there is little consensus about the type of dimension involved (Wiklund, 1998; Naldi et 
8:283:21841:17:17:76:534:206:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f8:B:al., 2007). Although different interpretations of the measuring instrument have been suggested, 
8:284:21937:17:17:76:534:189:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:that does not prevent it from being a feasible instrument to measure the important aspects of 
8:285:22031:17:17:76:535:172:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:the  entrepreneurial  orientation.  Covin  and  Slevin  (1991)  support  Miller’s  point  of  view  by 
8:286:22134:17:18:76:535:155:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:referring that organisations, and not only individuals, can behave entrepreneurially. They also 
8:287:22230:18:17:76:535:137:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:defend the use of risk taking, innovativeness and proactiveness, as the relevant dimensions of 
8:288:22325:17:17:76:534:120:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:entrepreneurship.  Nevertheless,  they  refer  to  this as  a  type  of  behaviour  labelled  as 
8:289:22422:17:17:76:203:103:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:“entrepreneurial posture”. 
8:290:22449:17:0:76:79:86:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B: 
9:291:22450:0:17:76:534:731:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:Based  on  Miller  (1983),  Colvin  and  Selvin  (1989),  and  Merz et  al.  (1994)  use  the  same 
9:292:22550:17:17:76:534:714:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:measuring  instrument,  but  argue  that such an  instrument  reflects  the strategic  orientation  of 
9:293:22653:17:17:76:534:697:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:the entrepreneur and that it should be considered as a philosophy of entrepreneurial behaviour 
9:294:22748:17:17:76:538:680:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:which  guides  the  firm  as  it  deals  with  the  environment.  Brown  (1996)  suggests  that 
9:295:22844:17:17:76:535:663:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:entrepreneurial orientation is connected with the will that a firm possesses to commit itself into 
9:296:22943:17:17:76:534:646:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:entrepreneurial  behaviour.  Lumpkin  and  Dess  (1996) argue  that  the  essential  act  of 
9:297:23036:17:17:76:534:629:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:entrepreneurship  is  characterised  by  the  new  entry.  This  can  be  achieved  if  there  is  an 
9:298:23138:17:18:76:535:612:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:incorporation to a new or current market with a new or current product, or still, if there is the 
9:299:23236:18:17:76:534:594:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:launching  of  a  new  business.  The  measuring  scales, used  in  every  reviewed  studies  relate 
9:300:23337:17:17:76:534:577:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:themselves  with  self-perception  of  the  people  responsible  for  the  strategy  of  the  firm. 
9:301:23437:17:17:76:534:560:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:Therefore,  the  expression  “strategic  orientation” can  be  understood  as  the  entrepreneurial 
9:302:23536:17:17:76:535:543:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:strategy of the entrepreneur which reflects the intentionality of a firm in committing itself to the 
9:303:23636:17:17:76:534:526:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:entrepreneurial behaviour. EO suggests an independence of action, a willingness to explore new 
9:304:23731:17:17:76:534:509:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:ideas  and  markets  and  attempts  to  destroy  the  market  leader’s  position  by  discovering  new 
9:305:23834:17:17:76:243:492:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:markets (Janney and Dess, 2006).

9:307:23867:18:17:76:535:457:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:In this context, and according to Miller (1983), the concept of EO is seen as a combination of 
9:308:23962:17:17:76:534:440:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:three  dimensions:  (1) innovativeness  –  is  concerned  with  supporting  and  encouraging  new 
9:309:24059:17:17:76:534:423:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:ideas,  experimentation  and  creativity  likely  to  result  in  new  products,  services  or  processes

9:313:24452:18:17:76:538:354:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:share  and  with  a  forward  looking  perspective  reflected  in  action  taken  anticipation  of  future

9:315:24660:17:17:76:328:320:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:discussion, we formulated the following hypothesis:

9:317:24713:17:17:76:430:286:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f8:B:Hypothesis 1: EO is significantly and positively related to the firm growth. 
9:318:24790:17:17:76:79:269:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B: 
9:319:24790:17:17:76:535:252:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:According  to  Wu  (2007)  without  dynamic  capabilities  to  convert  resource  into  advantage, 
9:320:24889:17:18:76:535:235:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:entrepreneurial resources do not translate into performance. This view endorse the RBV on firm 
9:321:24984:18:17:76:534:217:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:performance, namely, entrepreneurial resources (such human and financial capital or access to

9:324:25280:17:17:76:534:166:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:resources  and  capabilities  (Teece  and  Pisano,  1994;  Wu,  2007).  The  entrepreneurial  process 
9:325:25382:17:17:76:534:149:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:involves  the  gathering  of  scarce  resources  from  environment  and  the  resources  are  usually 
9:326:25484:17:17:76:535:132:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:obtained  through  the  entrepreneur’s  network.  Several  studies  (Falemo,  1989;  Johanisson, 
9:327:25581:17:18:76:535:115:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:1990; Birley et al., 1991) have indicated that entrepreneurs often go to considerable effort to 
9:328:25677:18:17:76:534:97:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:involve members of their network in both star-up and the growth of their business. In this sense 
9:329:25774:17:17:76:188:80:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:it is hypothesised that:

10:331:25800:0:17:76:517:731:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f8:B:Hypothesis 2: Entrepreneur resources are significantly and positively related to firm growth.

10:334:25989:17:17:76:535:680:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:As Johanisson (1990) notes some of these resources may provide direct solutions to operational 
10:335:26084:17:17:76:535:663:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:problems while  others  increase the  firm  legitimacy in  the market-place and  indirectly provide 
10:336:26184:17:17:76:534:646:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:access to resources needed for the pursuit of economics goals. Van de Ven et al. (1984) found 
10:337:26278:17:17:76:535:629:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:high performing entrepreneurs to be more externally oriented, involving a broader network of 
10:338:26371:17:18:76:534:612:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:potential customers and professional consultants in the planning and development of market. 
10:339:26463:18:17:76:534:594:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:Falemo (1989) found that managers of  expansive firms identified more external persons who 
10:340:26554:17:17:76:534:577:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:conducted  resources  for  product  development  and  marketing  than  managers  of  regressive 
10:341:26650:17:17:76:535:560:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:firms. According to Fischer and Reuber (2003) external resources providers is a key ingredient 
10:342:26745:17:17:76:386:543:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:for rapid growth. Thus, it is formulated the following hypothesis:

12:434:33006:17:17:76:534:440:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f8:B:(iv)  Entrepreneurial  Orientation  -  EO  was  conceptualised  as  consisting  of  the  variables:  (1) 
12:435:33111:17:17:76:534:423:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:C:innovativeness, the  development  of  new  and unique  products, services  or processes;  (2) risk 
12:436:33210:17:17:76:534:406:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f8:B:taking, a will to pursue risky opportunities, taking the chance of failing; and (3) proactiveness, 
12:437:33309:17:17:76:534:389:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:an emphasis in the persistence and creativity to overcome obstacles, until the innovator concept 
12:438:33406:17:18:76:210:372:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:is completely implemented. 
12:439:33433:18:17:76:79:354:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B: 
12:440:33433:17:17:76:534:337:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:The measure was adapted from the original scale developed by Miller (1983) and used in order 
12:441:33526:17:17:76:534:320:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:to measure the concept of entrepreneurial orientation. This scale includes a total of eight items: 
12:442:33625:17:17:76:535:303:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:(i) two items related to the risk taking; (ii) three items related to proactiveness; and (iii) three 
12:443:33726:17:17:76:534:286:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:items  to  measure  innovativeness.  As  the  items  of  the  scale  centre  themselves  on  several 
12:444:33827:17:17:76:534:269:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:different aspects of strategic position, they were submitted to a factorial analysis so that their 
12:445:33926:17:17:76:525:252:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:dimension or "factorial validity" could be established. As a result, four items were withdrawn.  
12:446:34023:17:18:76:79:235:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B: 
12:447:34023:18:17:76:534:217:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:This way, the reviewed measuring rule of EO is composed by four items (instead of the eight 
12:448:34115:17:17:76:534:200:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:original items), included in one single index, with an Alpha value of 0,68.  The interpretation of 
12:449:34214:17:17:76:535:183:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:the reliability test and the consistency of the factorial analysis support the unidimemsionality of 
12:450:34314:17:17:76:534:166:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:the concept. This is, the entrepreneurial orientation is more a combination of grouped variables 
12:451:34411:17:17:76:534:149:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:than of separate and autonomous variables. This position goes against the results of Lumpkin 
12:452:34504:17:17:76:535:132:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:and Dess (1996), but it agrees with the results of several other researchers (Miller, 1983; Covin 
12:453:34602:17:0:76:276:115:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:and Slevin, 1989; Caruana, et al., 1998).

13:455:34673:17:17:76:534:714:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:Based  on  a  review  of  the  literature  pertinent  to  the  measurement  of  growth,  two  objectives 
13:456:34778:17:17:76:534:697:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:measures of growth were included: (1) the sales growth; and (2) the employment growth. It 
13:457:34868:17:17:76:535:680:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:was calculated based in the change of the number of employees which took place from the year 
13:458:34961:17:17:76:534:663:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:2004 to 2005. The growth variable is made up of four indicators: (i) the change of the number 
13:459:35055:17:17:76:535:646:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:of  employees  from  year  2004  to  2005;  (ii)  the  change  in  the  amount  of  business  from  year 
13:460:35160:17:17:76:535:629:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:2004 to 2005; (iii) the growth of the sales compared to that of the competitors; (iv) and the 
13:461:35254:17:18:76:387:612:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:growth of the market value compared to that of the competitors.

13:463:35318:17:17:76:212:577:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:C:Control Variable: Firm’s age 
13:464:35347:17:17:76:534:560:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:There are  firm specific and external factors  that  may  affect a  firm’s  growth,  regardless of  its 
13:465:35451:17:17:76:538:543:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:entrepreneurial orientation (Lumpkin and Dess, 1996).  We  used as control variable the firm’s 
13:466:35546:17:17:76:535:526:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:age. Firm’s age is normally calculated from of the firm’s years. This variable was used to verify 
13:467:35644:17:17:76:535:509:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:if the firms, as they grow older, become less entrepreneurial, as it is frequently argued, so it is 
13:468:35744:17:17:76:534:492:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:expected that there will be a negative relation between the firm's age and the entrepreneurial 
13:469:35839:17:18:76:134:475:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:orientation.

13:473:35873:17:17:76:534:406:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:The firms of the sample are divided in two groups based on the rates of annual increase of sales 
13:474:35970:17:17:76:535:389:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:and the number of employees in year 2004 to 2005. The firms which present an increase in the 
13:475:36063:17:18:76:535:372:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:employment rate12 bigger than 25% and/or an increase in the sales rate bigger than 25% are 
13:476:36154:18:17:76:534:354:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:identified  as  "high-growth  firms".  Below  these  numbers  the  firms  will  be  identified  as  "low-
13:477:36259:17:17:76:534:337:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:growth firms". According this criterion, we find 90 low-growth firms and 78 high-growth firms. 
13:478:36354:17:17:76:537:320:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:The intention was to get to know the existence (or not) of significant differences between the 
13:479:36449:17:17:76:534:303:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:firms  that  show  a  high  growth  and  the  ones  that  do not.  The  answer  to  this  question  is 
13:480:36552:17:17:76:244:286:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:unquestionably positive (Table 1).

13:499:37233:17:20:76:534:85:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:entrepreneur of the high-growth firms, for example, adapts the products so that they can enter

14:503:37469:17:17:76:534:714:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:growth.  The  entrepreneur  of  the  high-growth  firms  use a  strategy  more directed to  flexibility 
14:504:37573:17:17:76:534:697:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:and to the change. They are more concerned with the new market opportunities and/or have a 
14:505:37664:17:17:76:300:680:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:better capability to react to new opportunities.

14:516:38129:12:17:76:534:514:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:A multiple linear regression was used to estimate how far the growth can be explained by the 
14:517:38222:17:17:76:535:497:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:variables related to resources and capabilities. The aim of the following analysis is to test the 
14:518:38320:17:17:76:534:480:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:validity  of  the  theoretical  assumptions  in  order  to  identify  what  kind  of  resources  and 
14:519:38421:17:17:76:535:463:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:capabilities have influence on the growth. That is, to determine the estimation of the relative 
14:520:38517:17:17:76:534:446:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:importance  of  the  different  resources  and  capabilities  to  explain  the  growth  process  of  small 
14:521:38624:17:17:76:534:429:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:firms.  As so, all the resources and capabilities were included in the linear regression model as

15:566:39889:18:17:76:535:674:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f8:B:networks are also higher. All the other meaningful coefficients present a similar magnitude and 
15:567:39985:17:17:76:534:657:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:it is difficult to establish any definite order of importance among them. Within of the dimensions

15:569:40191:17:17:76:535:623:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:explain  the  growth  of  small  firms,  namely,  age  of  entrepreneur,  gender,  experience  and

15:575:40665:17:17:76:534:520:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:appears as meaningless in the prediction of growth. The control variable (the firm's age) has a 
15:576:40761:17:17:76:535:503:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:negative influence on growth. The negative influence of the firm's age on growth suggests that 
15:577:40856:17:17:76:535:486:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:younger firms grow more than older ones. The analyses performed also allowed to test several 
15:578:40949:17:17:76:534:469:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:of  designed  research  hypotheses. The  association  between  resources  and  capabilities and 
15:579:41044:17:18:76:534:452:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:growth is strong. A particularly consistent result is the positive influence of the entrepreneurial 
15:580:41144:18:17:76:534:434:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:orientation  to  the  growth.  Their  strategies  are  directed  to  proactiveness,  risk  taking  and 
15:581:41247:17:17:76:534:417:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:innovativeness.  The  results  indicate  that  the  firms  which  have  an  entrepreneurial  orientation 
15:582:41352:17:17:76:535:400:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:and show some growth are guided so that they can take opportunities. This fact corresponds to 
15:583:41446:17:17:76:535:383:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:the conceptualisation of other researchers (Lumpkin and Dress, 1996; Smallbone et. al., 1995;

15:586:41631:17:17:76:534:332:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:At a more general theoretical level, it seems that the perception of the environment influences

15:592:41877:11:11:76:79:246:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B: 
15:593:41877:11:18:76:535:235:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:This study makes contribution  to the literature  on entrepreneurship  and  strategy research by 
15:594:41974:18:17:76:535:217:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:investigating the impact of the resources and capabilities and EO of the firms on its growth and 
15:595:42071:17:17:76:534:200:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:by  the  operationalisation  of  the  EO  concept.  To  our  knowledge,  these  impacts  have  not 
15:596:42170:17:17:76:534:183:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:previously been empirically investigated in this way, even though there have been studies on 
15:597:42263:17:17:76:534:166:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:the  relationship  between  EO  and  growth.  In  this  paper  we  have  focused  on  EO  (intangible 
15:598:42365:17:17:76:534:149:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:resource)  as  one  important  dimension  of  RBV  and  its  impact  on  growth  of  small  firms.  We 
15:599:42468:17:17:76:534:132:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:defined  the  constructs  of  EO  as  innovativeness,  risk  taking  and  proactiveness.  Confirmatory 
15:600:42571:17:18:76:535:115:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:factor analysis confirmed that these three constructs were statistically significant indicators of 
15:601:42670:18:17:76:99:97:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:EO.  
15:602:42675:17:0:76:79:80:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B: 
16:603:42677:0:17:76:534:731:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:This research complements existing studies, and the results suggest that the firms which grow 
16:604:42771:17:17:76:535:714:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:more, are those which are entrepreneurially oriented, that detect opportunities and obtain an 
16:605:42864:17:17:76:534:697:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:advantage  when  searching  for  those  opportunities.  However,  not  all  firms  search  for 
16:606:42959:17:17:76:534:680:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:opportunities. A possible explanation could be the entrepreneur's attitudes, this is, the desire to 
16:607:43059:17:17:76:150:663:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:growth or not.  
16:608:43075:17:17:76:79:646:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B: 
16:609:43075:17:17:76:534:629:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:In  what  concerns  the  issue  of  the  influence  of  the EO on  firm’s  growth  it  seems  that  the 
16:610:43178:17:18:76:535:612:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:entrepreneurship has, in fact, an important role as firms which grow better, have the tendency 
16:611:43273:18:17:76:535:594:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:to  develop  an  EO  supported  by  proactiveness,  innovativeness  and  risk  taking.  Based  on  the 
16:612:43376:17:17:76:534:577:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:most  important  and  consistent  results,  it  was  possible  to  identify  the  following  factors  which 
16:613:43484:17:17:76:534:560:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:influence the growth of  the small  firm:  (i) the high-growth firms have a  strategic  orientation 
16:614:43584:17:17:76:535:543:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:that  can  be  classified  as  entrepreneurial;  (ii)  the  entrepreneur  resources,  firm  resources  and 
16:615:43691:17:17:76:534:526:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:entrepreneur’s  networks  have  a  great  importance  to growth;  (iii)  youngest  firms  have  the 
16:616:43791:17:17:76:270:509:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:tendency to grow more than older ones. 
16:617:43830:17:17:76:534:492:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:Results  support  the  need  of  explanatory  variables  of  multiple  levels,  to  explain  growth.  The 
16:618:43936:17:18:76:535:475:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:setting  of  the  EO as  an  indispensable  variable  to  the  growth  of  small  firms  seems  to  be 
16:619:44038:18:30:76:266:457:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:conceptually and empirically pertinent.  
16:620:44079:30:17:76:534:427:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:This study has  important  implications for both researchers and practitioners. It highlights the 
16:621:44177:17:17:76:534:410:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:necessity  of  firms  to  develop  superior  EO  of  all  their  members  and  also  to  invest  on  better 
16:622:44285:17:17:76:537:393:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:resources and consequently superior capabilities as a way of reaching higher levels of growth. 
16:623:44380:17:18:76:537:376:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:We  argue  that  entrepreneurial  orientation,  based  on  proactiveness,  innovativeness  and  risk 
16:624:44481:18:17:76:534:358:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:taking,  have  effect  on  firm’s  growth.  Entrepreneurs  compete  not  only  to  identify  promising 
16:625:44584:17:17:76:534:341:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:opportunities,  but  also  for  the  resources  necessary  to  exploit  those  opportunities.  For 
16:626:44683:17:17:76:534:324:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:researchers this research highlights the need for a greater appreciation of the importance and 
16:627:44778:17:17:76:534:307:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:relevance of EO and RBV and how they can influence and impact on the growth of small firms. 
16:628:44870:17:17:76:535:290:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:For policymakers, this research has implications in terms of affording a means of identifying the 
16:629:44968:17:17:76:535:273:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:contributory resources and capabilities affecting growth of the small firms. Finally, we hope that 
16:630:45067:17:17:76:534:256:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:our study will encourage researchers to further examine the impact of different resources and 
16:631:45161:17:31:76:186:239:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:capabilities on growth. 
16:632:45185:31:17:76:534:208:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:Considering  that  the  approach  chosen  was,  effectively,  a  cross-sectional  research  and 
16:633:45281:17:17:76:535:191:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:quantitative  analysis  methods,  there  are,  consequently,  several  accepted  limitations:  (i)  the 
16:634:45385:17:17:76:534:174:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:sample used in the research it is not representative of the total population of small firms and 
16:635:45481:17:17:76:535:157:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:the sample covers firms in a single country; (ii) the multiple linear regression estimates only the 
16:636:45581:17:17:76:535:140:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:average  and  the  linear  effects,  which  limit  the  conclusions  about  the  relations  of  variables 
16:637:45687:17:18:76:534:123:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:(Mckelvey,  1997;  Miller  and  Friesen,  1984);  and  (iii)  the  period  of  time  considered  in  the 
16:638:45792:18:17:76:535:105:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:collecting  of  information,  serving  as  the  basis  to determine  the  independent  and  dependent 
16:639:45894:17:0:76:214:88:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:variables, is relatively short. 
17:640:45928:0:17:76:534:731:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:The  EO  is  seen,  frequently,  as  something  inherently  good,  something  firms  should  make  an 
17:641:46030:17:17:76:535:714:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:effort  to  achieve  it.  This  vision  is  supported  by  the  results  of  the  research.  However,  it  is 
17:642:46140:17:17:76:534:697:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:essential to examine the relationship between EO and the success of the firms. It would also be 
17:643:46236:17:17:76:535:680:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:fruitful  to  examine  the  relationship  between  EO  and  other  intangible  resources,  such  as 
17:644:46336:17:17:76:534:663:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:organisational  learning  capabilities  and  growth.  We  believe  that  the  integration  of  different 
17:645:46441:17:17:76:414:646:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:B:elements would certainly enhance the theory development in the field.
