2:28:1362:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:Economic demographers have long analyzed fertility cycles. This paper builds a foundation for these
2:29:1461:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:cycles in a model of fertility choice with dynastic altruism and aggregate shocks. It is shown that under
2:30:1566:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:reasonable parameter values, fertility is pro-cyclical and that, following a shock, fertility continues
2:31:1669:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:to cycle endogenously as subsequent cohorts enter retirement. Quantitatively, in the model, the Great
2:32:1770:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:Depression generates a large baby bust -- between 38% and 63% of that seen in the U.S. in the 1930s
2:33:1869:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:-- which is subsequently followed by a baby boom --  between 53% and 92% of that seen in the U.S.
2:34:1966:14:42:72:134:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:in the 1950s.

3:50:2294:0:30:71:207:707:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:C:1  Introduction
3:51:2309:30:18:71:539:677:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Fertility rates in the U.S. varied dramatically over the 20th century. During the first part
3:52:2401:18:18:71:539:659:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of the century, they continued a drop, begun in the mid 19th century, that demographers
3:53:2488:18:18:71:539:641:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:associate with the Demographic Transition. Total Fertility Rates (TFR) fell from 5.7 children
3:54:2581:18:18:71:539:623:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:per woman to 3.0 over the period from 1850 to 1925. In the yearsthat followed there was an
3:55:2671:18:18:71:540:605:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:even more abrupt drop during the years of the Great Depression, from 3.0 to 2.1. Indeed,
3:56:2759:18:18:71:540:587:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:women in their prime fertility years during the Great Depression had, on average, only 2.2
3:57:2849:18:18:71:539:569:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:children in their entire lifetime.  These women, born between 1905 and 1915, had fewer
3:58:2935:18:18:71:539:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:children than any previous cohort (in fact, fertility did not go back down to those levels
3:59:3025:18:17:71:539:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:until the 1970s). Following this, fertility rebounded significantly during the 1950s and early
3:60:3119:17:18:71:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:1960s, the Baby Boom. At its peak, TFR reached 3.6 while Cohort Total Fertility (CTFR)
3:61:3205:18:18:71:322:498:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:showed a similar, but smaller, increase up to 3.2.
3:62:3255:18:18:89:540:480:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:One of the key hypotheses put forward by economic demographers for these large and
3:63:3337:18:18:71:539:462:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:opposite swings is known as the ‘Easterlin hypothesis’, seeEasterlin (1961, 1968, 1978, 1987).
3:64:3431:18:18:71:540:444:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In a nutshell, the idea behind this hypothesis is that fertility was exceptionally low during the
3:65:3528:18:18:71:539:426:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Great Depression because of the large negative shock to incomes. Then, in substantial part,
3:66:3619:18:18:71:539:408:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:due to the fact that fertility had been so low during the 1930s, the Baby Boom occurred. The
3:67:3711:18:18:71:540:390:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mechanism through which low fertility in the past leads to high fertility one generation later
3:68:3805:18:18:71:540:372:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:has usually been attributed to the feedback effects of the resulting unbalanced age-structure
3:69:3898:18:18:71:539:354:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on relative wages of young fertile workers to older workers in combination with differences
3:70:3989:18:18:71:525:336:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:between expected lifetime income relative to ’material aspirations formed in childhood.’1
3:71:4078:18:18:89:540:318:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In this paper, we build a model of fertility choice combiningfeatures of a stochastic growth
3:72:4170:18:18:71:539:300:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model with a model of fertility choice with dynastic altruism `a la Barro-Becker (Becker
3:73:4258:18:17:71:539:282:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and Barro, 1988, and Barro and Becker, 1989).2In addition to the stochastic component,
3:74:4344:17:18:71:539:265:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the model extends existing Barro-Becker type models to include multiple periods in the
3:75:4430:18:18:71:540:247:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:working life. For simplicity, we assume that labor is the only factor of production (except in
3:76:4524:18:18:71:540:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Section 5.3) and that different age-groups are perfect substitutes in production (up to age-
3:77:4616:18:19:71:539:211:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:specific productivity levels). Thus, we abstract from feedback effects of relative cohort sizes
3:78:4711:19:15:85:540:192:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:1The so called ‘Easterlin hypothesis’ has developed over Easterlin’s own work and has been interpreted
3:79:4813:15:12:71:540:177:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:in more than one way by other authors along the way. For an excellent overview until 1998, see Macunovich
3:80:4918:12:12:71:539:165:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:(1998). She ‘focuses just on the fertility aspects of the Easterlin hypothesis’, which is our focus as well. For
3:81:5030:12:9:71:347:153:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:a more general overview, see Macunovich and Easterlin (2008).
3:82:5091:9:15:85:540:144:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:2Some have put forth the idea that the baby boom was a consequence of low fertility during the Great
3:83:5191:15:12:71:539:129:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:Depression – i.e., the baby boom was ‘catching up.’ However,completed fertility (CTFR) was low for both
3:84:5294:12:12:71:540:117:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:the women immediately preceding and immediately followingthe baby boom and hence, this cannot be true
3:85:5395:12:12:71:539:105:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:at the level of the individual mother. It can, in principle, hold across cohorts in a dynastic model. This
3:86:5501:12:0:71:499:93:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:distinction is relevant in our analysis and is one of our motivations for studying a dynastic model.
4:87:5602:0:18:71:540:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on relative wages. In this model, we study, both qualitatively and quantitatively, fluctuations
4:88:5697:18:18:71:540:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in fertility, triggered by (large) income shocks using preference parameter configurations in
4:89:5790:18:18:71:381:671:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:line with the standard growth and business-cycle literatures.
4:90:5851:18:18:89:539:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We show that both of the effects originally discussed by Easterlin, the large reactions
4:91:5938:18:18:71:540:635:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of fertility to large income shocks, and the oscillations thereafter, are present in the model
4:92:6032:18:18:71:539:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(despite the absence of feedback effects through wages). In particular, we find that fertility
4:93:6126:18:18:71:539:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is procyclical as long as most of the costs of children are in terms of goods, or as long as
4:94:6218:18:18:71:539:581:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:there is sufficient curvature in the period utility function.On top of this, the policy function
4:95:6314:18:18:71:539:563:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for current fertility as a function of past fertility that comes out of our model is negatively
4:96:6409:18:18:71:540:545:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sloped around the steady state. We find that that the dynamicsof adjustment following a
4:97:6496:18:18:71:539:527:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:movement off a balanced growth path is one of dampened oscillations. Putting these two
4:98:6582:18:18:71:539:509:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effects together, in the model, a large negative income shockis met with a contemporaneous
4:99:6672:18:17:71:539:491:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reduction in fertility followed by a baby boom a generation later. Thus, in the model the
4:100:6761:17:18:71:529:474:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Great Depression would trigger a baby bust, followed by a baby boom a generation later.
4:101:6848:18:18:89:539:456:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In our model, children are partly a consumption good (Barro-Becker preferences) and
4:102:6931:18:18:71:539:438:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:partly an investment good (future labor force) for the dynasty. Comparing our results with
4:103:7021:18:18:71:539:420:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:those standard in growth models gives substantial intuition. The role of the capital stock(s),
4:104:7115:18:18:71:539:402:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is played by the age distribution of the population, while the number of births plays the role
4:105:7209:18:18:71:539:384:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of investment. Then, as is standard in growth models (for standard consumption smoothing
4:106:7297:18:18:71:540:366:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reasons), periods when productivity is particularly high are times when investment is high.
4:107:7388:18:18:71:540:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Here this translates to: fertility is high during periods ofhigh productivity – an income
4:108:7477:18:18:71:540:330:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:boom generates a baby boom. Correspondingly, an income bustgenerates a baby bust. In
4:109:7561:18:18:71:539:312:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:addition, the larger is the desire to smooth consumption, the larger the elasticity of fertility
4:110:7657:18:18:71:539:294:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to income shocks. There is one subtlety that needs to be addedwith this interpretation.
4:111:7744:18:18:71:539:276:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This is that, when the cost of a new child is primarily in termsof time, good times are both
4:112:7836:18:17:71:539:258:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:good times to save for the future (invest) and times when thatinvestment is most expensive.
4:113:7927:17:18:71:540:241:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:As a result, in this case, fertility is only procyclical whenthere is sufficient desire to smooth
4:114:8024:18:18:71:338:223:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:consumption (i.e., more curvature than log utility).3
4:115:8077:18:18:89:539:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:A similar intuition gives us insight as to why the model exhibits dampened oscillations.
4:116:8165:18:18:71:540:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This has to do with the specification of the implicit depreciation rates of the age-specific
4:117:8257:18:18:71:539:169:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:populations. When the stock is the number of people, the counterpart of depreciation is
4:118:8344:18:19:71:539:151:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:movement out of the work force. Thus, fertility (i.e., investment) will be higher in periods
4:119:8436:19:15:85:540:132:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:3Notice that one important feature here is that income istemporarilyhigh or low,relativeto trend. As
4:120:8536:15:12:72:539:117:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:shown by Jones and Schoonbroodt (2010), apermanentincrease in productivity growth has a permanent
4:121:8633:12:12:72:540:105:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f5:F:negativeeffect on fertility under the parameter values that generatepro-cyclical fertility here. Thus, the
4:122:8739:12:12:72:540:93:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:important distinction between temporary and permanent changes in productivity shocks is just as important
4:123:8844:12:0:72:328:81:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:here as it is in standard growth and business cycle models.
5:124:8904:0:18:71:539:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:when a relatively large share of workers are nearing retirement age. Because of this effect, a
5:125:8998:18:18:71:540:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:baby bust now means that the next generation’s workforce is primarily older workers – more
5:126:9088:18:18:71:540:671:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:workers will be retiring. Consequently, investment will behigher in response – a baby boom
5:127:9178:18:18:71:124:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:will occur.
5:128:9189:18:18:89:539:635:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:On the quantitative side, we use a calibrated version of the model to simulate the size of
5:129:9279:18:18:71:540:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the response of fertility to productivity shocks, both contemporaneous and delayed. After
5:130:9368:18:18:71:539:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:calibrating to U.S. averages, we find that the contemporaneous response to a 1 percent
5:131:9454:18:18:71:540:581:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:deviation in productivity lies in the range of 1 to 1.7 percent depending on the nature of the
5:132:9548:18:18:71:539:563:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:costs of children (generally, responses are smaller when the costs of children are primarily in
5:133:9643:18:18:71:540:545:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:terms of parental time) while the elasticity one period later lies between 0.94 and 1.5. This
5:134:9736:18:18:71:539:527:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:implies that the response of (completed) fertility to a ‘standard recession’ (say, productivity
5:135:9831:18:18:71:540:509:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is 5 percent below trend for 2 years) is relatively small – of the order of 0.02 to 0.04 children
5:136:9928:18:17:71:540:491:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:per woman with a subsequent baby boom of similar size. However, we find that the reduction
5:137:10018:17:18:71:539:474:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in fertility implied by the model as a response to the 12 percent decrease in productivity
5:138:10108:18:18:71:539:456:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:during the Great Depression is between 38 and 63 percent of the observed pre-WWII baby
5:139:10194:18:18:71:539:438:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bust in Total Fertility Rates (TFR). Moreover, the subsequent endogenous fluctuations in
5:140:10282:18:18:71:539:420:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:fertility triggered by this bust, in conjunction with the productivity boom in the 1950s and
5:141:10374:18:18:71:497:402:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:1960s, captures between 53 and 92 percent of the post-WWII baby boom in TFR.4
5:142:10451:18:18:89:539:384:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Since both the Depression and the Baby Boom are phenomena that occurred in many
5:143:10530:18:18:71:540:366:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:different countries, we go on to study one obvious implication of our model. If the mechanisms
5:144:10624:18:18:71:540:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that we study are important, it should be true that countriesthat had deeper depressions in
5:145:10715:18:18:71:539:330:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the 1930s should also have larger baby busts in the 1930s, andthat those with larger baby
5:146:10804:18:18:71:539:312:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:busts should experience larger baby booms in the 1950s. In Section 6, we show that this
5:147:10891:18:18:71:539:294:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is indeed true, conditional on the economic circumstances in the 1950s. These observations
5:148:10981:18:18:71:210:276:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:further support our theory.
5:149:11008:18:17:89:540:258:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Many other demographers and economists have studied fluctuations in fertility but they
5:150:11094:17:18:71:540:241:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:have focused on different channels. First, operationally, the mechanisms that are the driving
5:151:11187:18:18:71:539:223:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:forces behind our results are considerably different than those emphasized by Easterlin in his
5:152:11281:18:18:71:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:work. For example, he emphasizes differences between expected lifetime income relative to
5:153:11370:18:18:71:540:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:’material aspirations formed in childhood.’ Here, the basic mechanisms are best understood
5:154:11460:18:18:71:533:169:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:as variants of standard effects of growth models – the desire to smooth consumption, etc.5
5:155:11550:18:18:89:539:151:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Second, following Easterlin many authors have analyzed thedynamics of age-structured
5:156:11634:18:15:85:540:133:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:4Realistically, it seems unlikely that fertility decisionsare affected by quarter to quarter fluctuations in
5:157:11742:15:12:71:539:118:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:productivity (as addressed in the business cycle literature). This is consistent with our quantitative findings.
5:158:11854:12:9:71:418:106:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:Rather, a prolonged boom or bust is required for the fertility effect to be large.
5:159:11936:9:15:85:540:97:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:5Feichtinger and Dockner (1990) assume a positive relationship between births and the difference between
5:160:12040:15:0:71:469:82:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:actual and expected consumption, which is more in line with Easterlin’s original argument.
6:161:12131:0:18:71:540:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:populations that results when it isassumedthat the relationship between fertility today and
6:162:12222:18:18:72:539:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:past fertility has a negative slope, see Lee (1974) and Samuelson (1976) for early analysis
6:163:12313:18:18:72:539:671:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of dynamic population systems of this kind.6In contrast, we provide a choice-theoretic
6:164:12399:18:18:72:211:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:foundation for these cycles.
6:165:12427:18:18:89:539:635:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Third, we assume that different ages of workers are perfect substitutes in production.
6:166:12513:18:18:72:540:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Nevertheless, fertility cycles are generated through the curvature of preferences. This shows
6:167:12606:18:18:72:539:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that feedback effects from the age-structure on wages are notnecessary to generate popula-
6:168:12696:18:18:72:539:581:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tion cycles. This is an alternative to Easterlin’s feedbackeffect which, as suggested by Lee
6:169:12788:18:18:72:539:563:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(2008), can be generated by using a CES production specification, where different age-groups
6:170:12880:18:18:72:210:545:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are not perfect substitutes.
6:171:12908:18:18:89:539:527:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Further, the mechanisms that we highlight here are also complementary to those explored
6:172:12995:18:18:72:540:509:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in other papers that have used choice-theoretic dynamic macroeconomic models to study
6:173:13080:18:17:72:540:491:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the Baby Boom. Three key examples are Greenwood et al. (2005), Doepke et al. (2007) and
6:174:13167:17:18:72:539:474:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Albanesi and Olivetti (2010). In Greenwood et al. (2005), the channel that is highlighted is
6:175:13259:18:18:72:540:456:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the effects of the drastic improvement in technologies of home production that took place in
6:176:13351:18:18:72:539:438:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the post WWII period. In essence, these improvements temporarily made having children
6:177:13436:18:18:72:539:420:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cheaper generating the boom. In Doepke et al. (2007), they emphasize the relatively high
6:178:13524:18:18:72:540:402:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:female participation rate that took place during WWII. This, because of learning on the job,
6:179:13616:18:18:72:539:384:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:made that specific cohort of women relatively high productivity. Because of this, the cohort
6:180:13708:18:18:72:539:366:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of women entering their 20s in the 1950s faced a relatively tough job market causing them
6:181:13797:18:18:72:540:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to delay entering the workforce and have larger than normal families. Albanesi and Olivetti
6:182:13888:18:18:72:539:330:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(2010) emphasize the decrease in maternal mortality as a cause of the baby boom. This
6:183:13973:18:18:72:540:312:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:decrease in mortality also increased the incentive to invest in human capital, triggering the
6:184:14066:18:18:72:539:294:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:return to low fertility in the 1970s. Thus, the primary channels emphasized in those papers
6:185:14157:18:18:72:539:276:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:differ from ours. One advantage of our approach is that it is also able to capture the sizeable
6:186:14252:18:17:72:398:258:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:downward movement, relative to trend, in fertility in the 1930s.
6:187:14316:17:18:89:539:241:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, our findings can rationalize the observations in Butz and Ward (1979) as follows.
6:188:14406:18:18:72:539:223:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In brief, they find that fertility, while procyclical, has become less responsive to business
6:189:14499:18:18:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cycle frequency fluctuations over time. In our model, this can happen for two reasons. The
6:190:14589:18:18:72:540:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:first comes from the fact that the size of the effects that we findare smaller when the
6:191:14676:18:18:72:539:169:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:costs of children are in terms of time. Since there has been a large increase in labor force
6:192:14768:18:18:72:539:151:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:participation among married women, this causes the time cost of children to be increasingly
6:193:14859:18:18:72:540:133:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:important. Second, due to continuing fluctuations triggered by the Great Depression, the
6:194:14947:18:18:72:540:115:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:fertility response to productivity shocks is mitigated. Inour data analysis, we show that,
6:195:15037:18:0:85:452:97:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:A:6Feichtinger and Sorger (1989) extend Samuelson’s initial model to continuous time.
7:196:15121:0:18:71:540:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:controlling for productivity shocks in the past is crucial to find a positive correlation of
7:197:15213:18:18:71:540:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:fertility with contemporary shocks. It is yet to be seen how large the fertility response to
7:198:15305:18:18:71:539:671:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the most recent recession will be, though it does go in the direction predicted by the theory
7:199:15398:18:18:71:274:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(see, for example, Sobotka et al., 2010).
7:200:15439:18:18:89:539:635:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In Section 2 we review the data for the U.S. since 1900. The model is laid out in Section 3
7:201:15530:18:18:71:539:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and the analytic results are presented. In Section 4, we explore the quantitative implications
7:202:15624:18:18:71:539:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of a calibrated version of the model compared to U.S. data.  InSection 5 we study the
7:203:15709:18:18:71:540:581:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sensitivity of our results to some basic changes in our assumptions.  Finally, we present
7:204:15798:18:35:71:385:563:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:international evidence in Section 6 while Section 7 concludes.
7:205:15860:35:25:71:180:528:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:C:2  U.S. data
7:206:15872:25:18:71:540:503:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In this section, we lay out the basic facts about the time paths of productivity and fertility in
7:207:15969:18:18:71:539:485:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the U.S. over the 20th century. We begin with the facts pertaining to the growth in produc-
7:208:16060:18:18:71:540:467:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tivity using a consistent measure for total factor productivity (TFP) and labor productivity
7:209:16152:18:18:71:539:449:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(LP) from Chari et al. (2007). As most economists know, this period is one of more or less
7:210:16242:18:17:71:539:431:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:continued growth in productivity with a few interruptions.The most significant of these is
7:211:16332:17:18:71:540:414:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the Great Depression. Figure 1 shows the natural logarithmsof TFP and LP over the period
7:212:16420:18:19:71:167:396:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from 1901 to 2000.
7:213:16438:19:23:89:467:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The facts about productivity over this period can be described as follows:
7:214:16512:23:24:86:244:354:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:1. the continual upward trend;
7:215:16542:24:25:86:497:330:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:2. the marked decline below trend that took place in the 1930sand early 1940s;
7:216:16620:25:24:86:297:305:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:3. the return to trend in the early 1950s;
7:217:16662:24:24:86:487:281:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:4. the significant increase above trend that took place in the1950s and 1960s;
7:218:16740:24:31:86:321:257:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:5. the productivity slowdown since the 1970s.
7:219:16785:31:18:89:539:226:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:This timing of the movements of productivity around trend fits well with the movements
7:220:16871:18:18:71:540:208:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in fertility seen in the data. Figure 2 shows the time path of the Total Fertility Rate (TFR)
7:221:16964:18:18:71:539:190:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and Cohort Total Fertility Rates (CTFR) (by birthyear of mother +23 years) over the period
7:222:17054:18:18:71:539:172:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from 1850 to 2000. We have two time series for TFR, which calculates how many children a
7:223:17142:18:18:71:540:154:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:woman would have over her lifetime if current age-specific fertility rates were to prevail in the
7:224:17239:18:18:71:539:136:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:future. The first series is the one prepared by Haines (1994) using Census data and hence is
7:225:17331:18:18:71:540:118:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:available only every 10 years. The second comes from the Natality Statistics Analysis from
7:226:17421:18:18:71:540:100:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:National Center for Health Statistics. It is available at annual frequencies, but only since
7:227:17513:18:0:71:539:82:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:1917. The CTFR series comes from Jones and Tertilt (2008) andcounts how many children

8:241:17836:18:18:71:539:434:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is equivalent to adding age-specific fertility rates pertaining to a particular cohort of women
8:242:17931:18:18:71:326:416:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:over time. Its frequency is five-year birth cohorts.
8:243:17983:18:18:89:540:398:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:At the beginning of the period, fertility is still in the midst of what is known to demog-
8:244:18073:18:18:71:540:380:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:raphers as the demographic transition, the marked fall in fertility (and mortality) that has
8:245:18165:18:18:71:540:362:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:occurred in all developed countries.  This fall acceleratesfrom the late 1920s to the mid
8:246:18254:18:18:71:540:344:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:1930s. Fertility then increases to reach its peak in the babyboom of the 1950s and 1960s.
8:247:18343:18:24:71:300:326:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:It appears that a good description would be:
8:248:18387:24:14:86:539:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:1. high, and fairly constantly decreasing fertility from 1850 until 1925, when it reaches a
8:249:18478:14:24:101:300:288:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:?:TFR of about 3.0 children per woman;
8:250:18514:24:15:86:540:264:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:2. an acceleration of the rate at which fertility is falling between 1925 and 1933 (from

8:252:18622:24:15:86:540:225:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:3. constant, but low, fertility over the period from 1933 to 1940, with the level at about

8:255:18800:25:24:86:403:161:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:5. high, stable fertility from 1957 to 1961 at about TFR=3.6;
8:256:18861:24:24:86:484:137:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:6. a rapid decrease from 1961 to 1976, with TFR going from 3.6 down to 1.7;

9:276:19244:18:18:71:539:434:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:boom and 6 as the baby bust of the 1970s. The exact sizes of these features of the data
9:277:19331:18:18:71:540:416:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:depend on how one treats the trend growth in productivity andtrend decrease in fertility over
9:278:19424:18:18:71:539:398:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the period. For example, was there a common, exogenous growth rate in productivity over
9:279:19511:18:18:71:539:380:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the entire period with higher frequency (albeit highly autocorrelated) fluctuations around
9:280:19601:18:18:71:539:362:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this trend? Or, were there several regimes of growth? For fertility, one can see that while
9:281:19692:18:18:71:539:344:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:TFR decreases smoothly over time, the early CTFR data shows that the largest decrease
9:282:19777:18:18:71:540:326:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:happens for cohorts of women born between 1858 (4.9 childrenper women) and 1878 (3.25
9:283:19862:18:18:71:539:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:children per woman). The fluctuations thereafter, however,look very similar in both series,
9:284:19953:18:17:71:305:290:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:though somewhat larger in TFR than CTFR.
9:285:19993:17:18:89:539:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:For fluctuations, we fit a linear trend to the (ln) TFP and LP series from 1901 to 2000
9:286:20080:18:18:71:540:255:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(lnPt=α0+α1t+-t, whereP={TFP,LP}), and detrend TFR using an HP filter
9:287:20149:18:18:72:540:237:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(smoothing parameter,w= 20,000). We obtain annual percent deviations over this period
9:288:20234:18:18:72:540:219:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:plotted in Figure 3. Several alternative detrending methods were studied with very similar
9:289:20324:18:18:72:108:201:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:results.
9:290:20332:18:18:89:540:183:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Although it is not perfect, there is an impressive coincidence in timing. The coefficient
9:291:20421:18:18:72:540:165:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of correlation between annual TFP and TFR deviations for theyears 1901 to 2000 is 0.4,
9:292:20507:18:18:72:540:147:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with a coefficient of 0.71 from 1901 to 1940 and a correlation of0.2 from 1941 to 2000. This
9:293:20599:18:18:72:540:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:suggests that the U.S. TFR is procyclical during the early time period but the correlation is
9:294:20692:18:18:72:540:111:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:much weaker thereafter (see also Butz and Ward, 1979). As suggested by the model below,
9:295:20779:18:0:72:539:93:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:one reason for the decrease in the correlation may be the increase in female labor supply

10:313:21105:18:18:89:540:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:What our model simulation is also going to capture is the large downward deviation in the
10:314:21194:18:18:71:540:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:1930s due to the large negative shock during the Great Depression and a baby boom following

11:332:22241:25:18:71:540:682:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In this section, we lay out a model of the response of fertility to period by period stochastic
11:333:22336:18:18:71:540:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:movements in productivity. To do this, we use a model of fertility based on that developed
11:334:22426:18:18:71:539:646:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in Becker and Barro (1988) and Barro and Becker (1989) (Barro-Becker henceforth). The
11:335:22511:18:18:71:540:628:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:simplification that we make is to assume that there is no physical (or human) capital in the
11:336:22603:18:18:71:539:610:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model. Thus, the flow of income is solely due to wage income.7On the other hand, we add
11:337:22690:18:29:71:539:592:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a stochastic component as well as an explicit age-structureto the basic Barro-Becker model.
11:338:22781:29:20:71:196:563:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:3.1  Model setup
11:339:22797:20:18:71:540:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:A period is 20 years. Every person lives for four periods, oneas a child andT= 3 periods as
11:340:22888:18:18:72:539:525:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:an adult. There is an initial age distribution of the population given by (N30,N20,N10) where
11:341:22981:18:18:72:539:507:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:N30is the number of initial old (i.e., their age in periodt= 0 isa= 3). We will normalize
11:342:23070:18:18:71:205:489:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by assuming thatN30= 1.
11:343:23093:18:18:89:540:471:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Children (agea= 0) do nothing. At agea= 1, young workers consume, have children
11:344:23172:18:18:71:540:453:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and supply one unit of labor (net of time spent to raise children) to earn a wage,w1t. At age
11:345:23265:18:18:71:539:435:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:a= 2, old workers consume and supply one unit of labor inelastically to earn a wage,w2t,
11:346:23353:18:18:71:539:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:but are no longer fertile. In the last period of their lives, agea= 3, agents are retired and
11:347:23446:18:18:71:143:399:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:only consume.

13:418:26479:18:18:71:103:635:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:below.
13:419:26485:18:18:89:539:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We assume that the cost of children born in periodtis in terms of periodtconsumption

13:421:26659:18:18:72:539:581:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the two most common ways of modeling child costs: goods costs–θt(w1t) =θt– and time

13:432:27021:18:18:89:540:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We assume that wages grow at a constant rate,γ, on average. Moreover, there is an
13:433:27102:18:18:71:540:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:aggregate shock so that the entire age-specific wage profile shifts up and down bystin
13:434:27188:18:28:71:314:411:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:periodt. Thus, in periodt, wages are given by:
13:435:27234:28:28:235:375:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f8:?:(w1t,w2t) = (γtstw1,γtstw2).
13:436:27262:28:18:71:330:355:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We assume thatstis a first-order Markov Process.
13:437:27310:18:18:89:539:337:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To ensure the existence of a balanced growth path, we also assume that the costs of
13:438:27393:18:18:71:539:319:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:children grow at rateγ.That is, we assume that,θ(w1t) =γtθin the goods cost case and

13:440:27512:17:18:89:540:284:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To complete the specification of the model we need to make a decision about which agents
13:441:27600:18:18:72:539:266:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:get to choose what and when. There are many different ways to dothis. A useful benchmark
13:442:27688:18:18:72:539:248:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is a Planner’s problem approach. Accordingly we analyze theproblem that maximizes the
13:443:27773:18:18:72:540:230:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:overall utility of the initial old. This has two advantages as a benchmark. First, this is the
13:444:27867:18:18:72:539:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:only group that cares, either directly or indirectly about all agents in the model. Second,
13:445:27958:18:18:72:539:194:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:it has the feature that the resulting allocation can also be supported dynamically as the
13:446:28047:18:18:72:539:176:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:equilibrium of a game in which in each period, the oldest individuals make choices for all
13:447:28137:18:18:72:260:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:variables for all of their descendants.
13:448:28176:18:0:89:415:140:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Given this, the Planner’s Problem,P(γ,β;{Na0},s0), is to choose

14:456:28498:0:18:89:540:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:As is usually true in models with exogenous, trend growth, solutions can be obtained by
14:457:28585:18:18:71:539:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:solving a related model with no growth and a different discount factor. Thus, the solution
14:458:28675:18:18:71:540:671:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:toP(γ,β;{Na0},s0) can be obtained directly from the solution toP(1,ˆβ;{Na0},s0) – i.e.,
14:459:28762:18:18:72:539:653:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:γ= 1 (no growth) and the discount factor,ˆβ, depends onγ,β,σ,andη. Because of this
14:460:28844:18:18:72:539:635:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:result, we abstract from trend growth through most of the remainder of the paper. In those
14:461:28934:18:18:72:539:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cases where the solution to the model depends on the discountfactor, we will use this result
14:462:29026:18:18:72:434:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to calibrate to the appropriate discount factor in the detrended model.
14:463:29097:18:0:89:405:581:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f9:A:Let us introduce one additional piece of notation. Letnbt≡N

14:491:29733:18:18:89:539:381:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Given any level of aggregate consumption in a period,Ct, the planner will choose a

14:497:29900:15:18:71:539:345:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this is done by equating the marginal utility of a unit of aggregate consumption across the
14:498:29991:18:17:71:142:327:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:different ages.
14:499:30006:17:25:89:461:310:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To gain more intuition, consider the Planner’s objective within a period:

14:505:30109:31:18:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:As can be seen, the marginal utility ofCatis affected by three things. First, isgincreasing

14:507:30276:18:0:89:434:195:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f8:A:For example, supposeφ= 1. In this case, the ageaterm isg(Nat)u

14:512:30346:13:18:464:539:195:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:. If population
14:513:30361:18:18:71:539:177:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is growing (the case typically of empirical interest), thenNatis decreasing ina– there are less
14:514:30456:18:18:71:539:159:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:people in older generations. Thus, ifgis increasing (decreasing) inN,g(Nat) is decreasing
14:515:30545:18:18:71:540:141:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(increasing) ina. Thus, other things equal, the marginal value of an increasein per capita
14:516:30635:18:17:72:540:123:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:consumption within a period is decreasing (increasing) in age. On the other hand, in this
14:517:30724:17:18:72:540:106:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:case a given level of aggregate consumption in a cohort is split across fewer people in older
14:518:30817:18:0:72:460:88:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:groups increasing per capita consumption. This leads to a lower value ofu′.
15:519:30894:0:18:89:539:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Thus ifgis increasing inN, whether the Planner will want consumption to be increasing
15:520:30979:18:18:72:539:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:or decreasing in age within a particular period will depend on which of these two effects
15:521:31068:18:18:72:539:671:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is larger.  Ifgis decreasing inN, then if population is growing, per capita consumption
15:522:31155:18:18:72:539:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f8:B:is increasing inafor sure. For example, specializing further to the case whereη= 1−σ
15:523:31239:18:20:72:446:635:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(allowed under both configurations), andφ= 1, periodtutility becomes:

15:529:31323:36:0:89:536:564:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f9:A:Thus, aggregate consumption of all age groups within a period will be equalized,Ca=Ca

15:537:31600:21:18:72:539:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In this section we study the properties of the solution to thePlanner’s Problem outlined
15:538:31688:18:18:72:539:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:above. In particular, we characterize how the policy functions from this problem depend on
15:539:31778:18:18:72:297:442:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:both the current shock and the initial state.
15:540:31823:18:18:89:539:424:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To gain some intuition about the working of the model, noticethat ifη= 1−σ, then
15:541:31903:18:18:71:540:406:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:Ndoes not enter the period utility function except in aggregate consumption, and hence, if
15:542:31993:18:17:71:540:388:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:people are productive for only one period (wa= 0,a6= 1),Nplays exactly the same role in
15:543:32080:17:18:71:540:371:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this model askdoes in a stochasticAkmodel.9Similar toAkmodels, without exogenous
15:544:32160:18:18:71:540:353:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:growth (i.e.,γ= 1), aggregate consumption,C, grows at the same rate asN. However, in
15:545:32244:18:18:72:540:335:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the absence of shocks, per capita consumption is constant. There is one important twist to
15:546:32334:18:18:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:theAk-analogy. This is that, at least in the case where child-rearing is modeled as a time
15:547:32424:18:18:72:539:299:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cost, the cost of the investment good is also stochastic. In that case, sinceθt=bw1t, periods
15:548:32517:18:18:72:540:281:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:when productivity is high are also periods when children – the analog of the investment good
15:549:32609:18:18:72:464:263:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in theAkmodel – are expensive. Other than that, the analogy is very close.
15:550:32683:18:18:89:539:245:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We now derive comparative statics of current fertility withrespect to productivity shocks
15:551:32772:18:18:72:540:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and last period’s fertility. To do this, we first simplify theproblem to one with only one
15:552:32862:18:18:72:539:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:state variable. We then take first-order conditions and analyze comparative statics across
15:553:32952:18:18:72:303:191:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:steady states/balanced growth paths therein.
15:554:32996:18:18:89:546:173:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Denote byV(N1,N2,N3;s) the maximized value obtained in the problemP(1,̂β;{Na0},s0)

16:622:34516:41:18:71:539:277:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:LHS(n′) is increasing inn′, withLHS(0) = 0 ifEˆV1(0,s) =∞. Also,RHS(n′) is decreasing
16:623:34601:18:18:72:448:259:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:inn′with a positive intercept atn′= 0. Thus, there is a unique solution.
16:624:34673:18:18:89:539:241:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To see the behavior ofn′as a function of the shock, we consider the two extreme cases,
16:625:34759:18:18:72:539:223:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:F:θ(s) =θ, a goods cost, and a time cost,θ(s) =bsw1. In the first case,θ(s) =θ,RHS
16:626:34839:18:18:72:539:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:shifts up whensgoes up whileLHSis unchanged. Thus,n′is increasing ins– fertility is
16:627:34922:18:18:72:539:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:procyclical. This is a pure income effect which is larger, thelargerσ, i.e. the desire to smooth
16:628:35018:18:18:72:539:169:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f8:B:consumption. Also, it follows thatn′is linear ins. On the other hand, whenθ(s) =bsw1,
16:629:35103:18:17:72:539:151:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bothLHSandRHSshift up whensincreases. The effect onRHSis still the pure income
16:630:35181:17:18:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effect, which tends to increase fertility and is increasing inσ,sσ. The effect onLHSis
16:631:35267:18:18:72:539:116:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the substitution effect because whensis high, fertility is temporarily more expensive which
16:632:35358:18:18:72:539:98:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tends to decrease fertility. This effect is linear ins. Ifσ >1, the income effect dominates, i.e.
16:633:35455:18:0:72:540:80:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:RHSshifts up by more thanLHS. Thus, againn′is increasing ins– fertility is procyclical.
17:634:35544:0:18:71:433:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:If,σ <1 the substitution effect dominates – fertility is countercyclical.
17:635:35617:18:18:89:539:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To see how current fertility (per young adult),n′, depends on past fertility,n, notice that
17:636:35708:18:18:71:539:671:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:RHSshifts down when the current state,n, increases whileLHSis independent ofn. Thus
17:637:35791:18:18:71:540:653:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:n′decreases whennincreases, generating cycles. This crucially depends onw2>0. If there
17:638:35877:18:18:72:539:635:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:is only one period of working life (as in standard Barro-Becker models), this effect is zero.10
17:639:35972:18:28:89:379:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We summarize these results in the following proposition:
17:640:36028:28:24:72:301:589:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f7:C:Proposition 1.Current fertility,n′(n,s), is
17:641:36071:24:18:85:395:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:1. a. procyclical ifθ(w1) =θ, or ifθ(w1) =bsw1andσ >1;
17:642:36125:18:21:101:331:547:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f2:?:b. countercyclical ifθ(w1) =bsw1andσ <1;
17:643:36165:21:17:85:368:526:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f2:A:2. a. independent of last period’s fertility,n, ifw2= 0;
17:644:36221:17:24:101:361:509:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:C:b. decreasing in last period’s fertility,n, ifw2>0.
17:645:36272:24:28:89:539:485:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Thus, ifw2>0the model generates endogenous cycles, triggered by productivity shocks.
17:646:36356:28:18:89:540:457:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The intuition for why fertility is procyclical in this modelis similar to that in many growth
17:647:36449:18:18:72:539:439:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:models.  Here, fertility plays the role of an investment goodand the usual consumption
17:648:36535:18:18:72:539:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:smoothing logic implies that when the shock is high, investment should be high so as to
17:649:36622:18:18:72:539:403:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:offset the effects of future shocks on consumption. This argument is direct when the cost of
17:650:36714:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:children is a goods cost. It is tempered when the cost is a timecost by a second effect. This
17:651:36807:18:18:72:539:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is that the cost of the investment good is also higher than average when the shock is high.
17:652:36898:18:18:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Thus, whether or not it is a good idea to invest in those periods depends on how strong the
17:653:36989:18:18:72:539:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:desire is to smooth consumption. When this force is strong –σis large – the consumption
17:654:37076:18:18:72:539:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:smoothing effect is large relative to the cost effect and fertility is procyclical. Thus, the more
17:655:37174:18:18:72:539:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:important the time cost in raising children, the more procyclical is the cost of children itself.
17:656:37271:18:17:72:539:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:That is, whenever productivity is high, the cost of childrenis also high and vice versa. This
17:657:37364:17:18:72:540:260:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dampens the procyclicality of fertility and, indeed, when the desire to smooth consumption
17:658:37454:18:18:72:310:242:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is very low, fertility actually is countercyclical.
17:659:37505:18:18:89:540:224:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Some intuition for the fertility cycles in point 2 of the proposition can also be obtained
17:660:37595:18:18:72:539:206:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by analogy with growth models. Here, what we find is a source ofendogenous cycles. The
17:661:37681:18:18:72:539:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:relevant analogy from capital theory here is to consider a model in which depreciation is not
17:662:37774:18:18:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:constant. Here, we have an extreme version. Capital (i.e., people) that is built in periodt−1
17:663:37867:18:18:72:539:152:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:has full productive capacity in periodtand periodt+ 1 – there is no depreciation between
17:664:37955:18:18:72:539:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:periodstandt+ 1 – but has zero productive capacity in periodt+ 2. Thus, age-specific
17:665:38039:18:18:71:539:116:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:depreciation rates here would beδ1= 0 andδ2= 1 – no depreciation after one period,
17:666:38121:18:15:81:540:98:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:10Note that since the number of birthsper woman(CTFR) isnb=n/0.5, all these comparative statics go
17:667:38219:15:0:72:179:83:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:through without change.
18:668:38244:0:18:71:539:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:full depreciation after two. In a situation like this, whenn=N1/N2is higher than usual,
18:669:38331:18:18:71:540:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the planner expects next periods depreciation rate to be lower than usual (becauseN2is
18:670:38417:18:18:71:539:671:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:relatively low). Because of this, to smooth consumption, current investment –n′=Nb/N1
18:671:38502:18:18:71:539:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:– will be relatively low. Thus,n′is low whennis high. When there is only one period of
18:672:38588:18:18:71:539:635:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:working life, the depreciation rate is always 100 percent and hence this effect is not present.
18:673:38683:18:18:71:540:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Because of this, fertility is independent of last period’s fertility.  The example with one
18:674:38774:18:18:71:540:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:period working life,w2t= 0, is interesting because it corresponds most closely to that of the
18:675:38867:18:18:72:540:581:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:original Barro-Becker model while the model with more than one period productive life is
18:676:38955:18:18:72:152:563:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:more realistic.11
18:677:38972:18:18:89:540:545:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Thus, according to our theory, while the baby bust in the 1930s may be explained by
18:678:39055:18:18:72:539:527:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the Great Depression, the baby boom in the 1950s is first and foremost a response to low
18:679:39143:18:35:72:172:509:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:fertility in the past.
18:680:39165:35:25:72:270:474:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:C:4  Quantitative results
18:681:39188:25:18:72:539:449:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In this section, we use the facts about the time paths of productivity and fertility in the
18:682:39279:18:17:72:540:431:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:U.S. over the 20th century laid out in Section 2 to perform quantitative experiments on
18:683:39366:17:18:72:539:414:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the model. To do this, we calibrate parameters to selected moments of our data. We then
18:684:39453:18:18:72:540:396:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:use this model to explore two kinds of questions.  First, whatdoes the calibrated model
18:685:39540:18:18:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:say about the size of responses to shocks to productivity – e.g., what is the elasticity of
18:686:39631:18:18:72:539:360:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:fertility with respect to a productivity shock? In keeping with the theoretical results of the
18:687:39725:18:18:72:539:342:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:previous section we study both the current response to a shock and also the lagged response
18:688:39816:18:18:72:540:324:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:one generation later due to the misalignment of the age structure of the workforce. Second,
18:689:39907:18:18:72:540:306:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:based on the estimated policy functions from the calibratedmodel we study the predicted
18:690:39994:18:18:72:538:288:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:response to a productivity shock like those seen in US history – e.g., the Great Depression.
18:691:40086:18:18:89:540:270:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We find that the answers to these quantitative questions alsodepends on the nature of
18:692:40171:18:18:72:539:252:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the costs of children. Because of this, we give results for two alternative specifications. These
18:693:40268:18:18:72:539:234:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are: (1) all costs are time costs (θ(s) =bw1s); (2) all costs of raising children are goods costs
18:694:40365:18:18:71:539:216:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(θ(s) =θ). As noted above, these two specifications are qualitatively different in that with
18:695:40457:18:17:71:540:198:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a time cost, the costs of children are higher in productivitybooms than in busts. Reality
18:696:40546:17:18:71:388:181:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:probably lies somewhere inbetween these two extreme cases.12
18:697:40606:18:18:89:540:163:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We find that the quantitative responses in the model are economically significant in all
18:698:40694:18:16:81:540:145:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:11In Section 5.4 we add a third period of working life to show that results, though qualitatively more
18:699:40796:16:8:71:263:129:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:complicated, are very similar quantitatively.
18:700:40841:8:16:81:539:121:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:12Indeed, the time cost may have become more relevant over timeas women entered the labor force. Since
18:701:40943:16:12:71:539:105:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:women tend to be the parent taking care of children, the relevant opportunity cost is only procyclical if the
18:702:41052:12:0:71:384:93:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:latter are actually working whenever they are not busy raising children.
19:703:41126:0:18:71:540:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cases. For example, the elasticity of fertility to a contemporaneous productivity shocks lies
19:704:41219:18:18:71:539:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:between 1 and 1.7,13while the elasticity one period later lies between 0.94 and 1.5. Standard
19:705:41312:18:18:71:539:671:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:recessions will have rather modest effects on fertility, however. Large recessions, such as the
19:706:41407:18:18:71:469:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Great Depression, on the other hand, have important and longlasting effects.
19:707:41483:18:18:89:539:635:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We therefore turn to the historical record of the United States and study the predicted
19:708:41570:18:18:71:539:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:response of fertility to the productivity booms and busts over the 20th century. To do this,
19:709:41662:18:18:71:539:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we must first construct a series of shocks to feed into the model. It is not obvious how to do
19:710:41756:18:18:71:540:581:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this realistically. On the one hand, in the model, it is assumed that the shock for the current
19:711:41851:18:18:71:539:563:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:period is realized at the beginning of the period. Effectively, this means that individuals
19:712:41942:18:18:71:539:545:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:know, at the beginning of the period, what the sequence of annual shocks will be over the
19:713:42031:18:18:71:540:527:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:next 20 years.  Even with highly correlated shocks at annual frequency, this assumption
19:714:42118:18:18:71:539:509:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:seems extreme at best.  Another alternative is to decrease the length of a period.  This
19:715:42206:18:17:71:540:491:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:necessarily increases the size of the state space. For example, even decreasing the period
19:716:42296:17:18:71:539:474:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:length to 10 years and maintaining thei.i.d.assumption increases the size of the state space
19:717:42388:18:18:72:539:456:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from 2 dimensional to 5.14Relaxing thei.i.d.assumption which might be required for 10-
19:718:42474:18:18:72:540:438:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:as opposed to 20-year periods, adds another state variable.In addition, one would have
19:719:42560:18:18:72:539:420:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to address timing of births (between age 20-30 versus 30-40)more seriously.  This is not
19:720:42648:18:18:72:540:402:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:an easy problem (see Caucutt et al. (2002), Doepke et al. (2007) and Sommer (2010) for
19:721:42734:18:18:72:540:384:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:examples). Thus, there are technical difficulties with following the strategy of decreasing the
19:722:42829:18:18:72:143:366:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:period length.
19:723:42843:18:18:89:539:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Because of this, we present results for several alternativemethods for constructing the
19:724:42930:18:18:72:540:330:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:relevant series of productivity shocks for TFP and LP. First, since the data shows that over
19:725:43022:18:18:72:539:312:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the period 1940 to 1980 at least 60 percent of all births are towomen age 20 to 30,15we assume
19:726:43116:18:18:72:540:294:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that women have all their children between age 21 and 30. As our baseline experiment, we
19:727:43204:18:18:72:539:276:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:therefore assume that the relevant productivity shock for them is the average one in the data
19:728:43297:18:17:72:540:258:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for that 10 year period. We conduct sensitivity analysis on this specification in Section 5.1.
19:729:43391:17:18:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We also have to choose which productivity measure to use, total factor productivity (TFP)
19:730:43480:18:18:72:539:223:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:or labor productivity (LP). We use TFP in our baseline case and discuss LP in Section 5.2.
19:731:43570:18:18:89:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In our baseline experiment, a shock to productivity (or labor income) the size of the Great
19:732:43661:18:18:72:539:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Depression gives rise to a contemporary baby bust that accounts for 64 to 103 percent of the
19:733:43753:18:16:81:539:169:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:13As will be seen below, the model response to a shock is smallerwhen the cost is in terms of time than
19:734:43856:16:12:71:539:153:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:when it is in terms of goods. Thus, ’between 1 and 1.7’ corresponds to 1 with a time cost and 1.7 with a
19:735:43960:12:8:71:119:141:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:goods cost.
19:736:43971:8:16:81:539:133:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:14The state space is three-dimensional in our problem:N1, N2ands. Using the homogeneity results,
19:737:44067:16:11:71:540:117:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:this can be reduced to two state variables,N=N1/N2ands. With 10-year periods (and age-groups) the
19:738:44164:11:12:71:539:106:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:problem becomes six-dimensional:N2b, N1,1, N1,2, N2,1, N2,2ands, which using the same methods can be
19:739:44264:12:9:71:240:94:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:reduced to a five-dimensional problem.
19:740:44302:9:0:81:313:85:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:A:15See Vital Statistics of the United States, Table 1-7.
20:741:44359:0:18:71:540:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reduction in CTFR and 39 to 63 percent of the reduction in TFR seen in the data. Further,
20:742:44448:18:18:71:540:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the model prediction of the lagged response to such a shock isa baby boom. Combined
20:743:44531:18:18:71:540:671:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with the productivity boom in the 1950s and 1960s, the predicted size of the baby boom lies
20:744:44622:18:18:71:540:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:between 84 and 150 percent of the actual size of the baby boom observed in the CTFR data
20:745:44710:18:29:71:373:635:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and 53 to 92 percent of the one observed in the TFR data.

20:747:44788:21:18:71:540:585:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:B:Preference Parameters:Throughout, we assume thatη= 1−σand setσ= 3 following
20:748:44863:18:18:72:539:567:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Jones and Schoonbroodt (2010) among others.16The discount factor is set toβ= 0.9620to
20:749:44948:18:18:72:325:549:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:match an annual interest rate of about 4 percent.
20:750:44997:18:17:72:539:531:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:B:Wage and Productivity Parameters:From the model, wages are given bywat=stγtwa,

20:753:45250:18:18:72:539:478:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:i.i.d.over time.17Further, for computational reasons, it is convenient to assume a functional
20:754:45343:18:18:72:539:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:form for the distribution of productivity shocks,st. We assume that ln ˆst∼N(0,σ2s) where
20:755:45432:18:0:72:116:442:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f9:B:ˆst=steσ

20:757:45444:7:18:132:539:442:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:soE(st) = 1. Thus, the parameter values to be determined arew1,w2,γandσs.
20:758:45517:18:18:89:540:424:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We normalizew1= 1 and choosew2= 1.25.  This is in line with life-cycle earnings
20:759:45596:18:18:72:540:406:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:profiles from Hansen (1993) and Huggett (1996). The growth rate of productivity,γ, and
20:760:45682:18:18:71:539:388:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the standard deviation of productivity shocks,σs, are calculated from the TFP series plotted
20:761:45774:18:18:71:539:370:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in Figure 1. First, we compute the linear trend in productivity by running the following
20:762:45862:18:33:71:321:352:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ordinary least-squares regression on annual data:
20:763:45911:33:32:71:368:319:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f8:B:(10)lnTFPt=α0+α1t+-t.
20:764:45932:32:18:71:539:287:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We find thatα1= 0.0159 and therefore setγ= (eα1)20= 1.016120. That is, productivity
20:765:46015:18:18:71:423:269:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:grows at an average of 1.61 percent per year over the 20th century.18
20:766:46084:18:18:89:539:251:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To pin down the value ofσsseveral steps are required. First, in our baseline experiment,
20:767:46172:18:18:72:540:233:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we use the 10 most fertile years of each cohort within a dynasty, namely age 20 to 30, to
20:768:46261:18:18:72:540:215:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:determine the productivity shock this cohort’s fertility choice is affected by. Thus, the shock
20:769:46356:18:0:72:234:197:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we are interested in is ln ˆst= ln

20:775:46442:24:12:81:458:177:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:A:16e.g., Mateos-Planas (2002) and Scholz and Seshadri (2009) also use a value ofσ= 3.
20:776:46526:12:15:81:540:165:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:17This is a reasonable approximation for long movements in labor productivity across generations, which
20:777:46629:15:9:72:230:150:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:within a dynasty are 20 years apart.
20:778:46665:9:15:81:539:141:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:18An alternative detrending method would be to use a Hodrick-Prescott filter, instead. However, it is
20:779:46766:15:12:72:540:126:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:not clear what value to use for the smoothing parameter sincewe are interested in long fluctuations, rather
20:780:46873:12:12:72:539:114:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:than quarter-to-quarter or annual deviations from trend. In any case, for low enough smoothing parameter
20:781:46977:12:12:72:539:102:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:resulting productivity shocks would typically be smaller.Assuming that the growth rate of productivity is
20:782:47082:12:12:72:539:90:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:constant in the model but using HP productivity shocks wouldresult in smaller fertility responses in the
20:783:47186:12:0:72:298:78:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:experiments at the end of this and the next section.
21:784:47240:0:33:71:493:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:its standard deviation,σs, we assume that-tfollows an AR1 process and estimate

21:787:47421:18:18:72:540:623:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:its standard deviation to getσs= 0.07. Of course, the series, lnst, so constructed is not
21:788:47510:18:18:72:540:605:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:exactly normally distributed.  However, for all simulations, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
21:789:47598:18:18:72:539:587:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:produces ap-value of about 0.4. This means that, at any reasonable significance level, the
21:790:47688:18:18:72:540:569:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:test would accept the null hypothesis that the distributionof lnstis normal and hence this
21:791:47778:18:17:72:266:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:should provide a good approximation.

21:794:47992:18:0:72:446:498:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f9:B:1994, Table 1).  In the model, population growth correspondstoNb+N

21:797:48082:14:18:71:539:480:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:state with no uncertainty, this is given by the level of fertility choice (per person),nss,

21:800:48345:18:18:71:539:426:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:θ= 0.1932, while with time costs we findb= 0.1927. Since the wage for young workers is
21:801:48431:18:18:71:540:408:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:normalized to 1, these costs imply that it takes about 20 percent of a young worker’s income
21:802:48523:18:18:71:540:390:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:or time to produce a child. This means that a two person household can at most have ten

21:810:48825:21:18:71:539:163:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Given the parameter values from the previous section we calculate the decision rules from the

22:826:49818:56:18:89:539:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:As can be seen from this table, in the goods cost case the fertility response to a 1-percent
22:827:49910:18:18:71:539:422:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:productivity shock generates a 1.74 percent contemporaneous increase in fertility (column
22:828:49999:18:18:71:539:404:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(a)) with a lagged decrease of 1.56 percent one period later (column (b)). In the time cost
22:829:50090:18:18:71:539:386:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:case, the corresponding percentage changes are a 1.04 percent contemporaneous increase and
22:830:50180:18:18:71:236:368:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a 0.94 decrease one period later.
22:831:50213:18:18:89:539:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:These magnitudes can be compared to the regression results shown in Table 1. In par-
22:832:50297:18:18:71:540:332:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ticular, column (a) is to be compared withλ1and column (b) withλ2. Thus, if the model
22:833:50382:18:18:72:540:314:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:fit the data perfectly we should see 0.83 in column (a), and -0.84 in column (b). Although
22:834:50472:18:18:72:493:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the model quantities are higher, they are remarkably similar in the time cost case.
22:835:50555:18:18:89:540:278:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Comparing the two cases, the initial effect is 70 percent larger in the goods cost case
22:836:50642:18:18:72:540:260:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:than it is in the time cost case. The reason for this differenceis that when child costs are
22:837:50734:18:18:72:540:242:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:primarily in terms of time there are two offsetting effects. First, when times are good there
22:838:50827:18:18:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is a natural tendency to save for the future to equalize marginal utilities. Here, the only way
22:839:50922:18:18:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to do this is by increasing family size. On the other hand, since the cost of raising children is
22:840:51019:18:17:72:539:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:positively related to the wage, when times are good, children are relatively more expensive
22:841:51110:17:18:72:540:171:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:– a force in the opposite direction. When the costs of children are in terms of goods, this
22:842:51201:18:18:72:539:153:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:second effect is not at work and hence, the overall effect is larger in this case. As can be seen
22:843:51298:18:18:72:539:135:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the table, as the theory predicts, the first effect dominates if the intertemporal elasticity
22:844:51394:18:18:72:360:117:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of substitution is low enough (σ >1, see Proposition 1).
22:845:51450:18:18:89:539:99:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Further, since in both cases, the ratio of the initial response to the lagged response is
22:846:51539:18:0:71:540:81:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:about -90 percent, the half-life (in absolute value) of the effect is 7 periods (or generations)
23:847:51637:0:18:71:539:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in both cases. In particular, the effect 7 periods later is a decrease in fertility of 0.8 percent
23:848:51735:18:18:71:539:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the goods cost case and 0.5 percent in the time cost case (i.e., half of the initial responses).
23:849:51834:18:18:89:539:671:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To get a sense about the size of these effects note that a one-percent decrease in produc-
23:850:51924:18:18:71:540:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tivity for a 10-year period roughly corresponds to a recession where GDP is 5 percent below
23:851:52015:18:18:71:539:635:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trend for two years. This would decrease fertility by about 0.02 to 0.04 children per woman
23:852:52106:18:18:71:539:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with a subsequent baby boom of similar size. Thus, the quantitative effects on (completed)
23:853:52196:18:18:71:539:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:fertility of a normal sized recession would be quite modest.As we shall see below, the model
23:854:52288:18:29:71:517:581:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:predicts that a recession the size of the Great Depression gives a much larger response.
23:855:52376:29:21:71:446:552:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:4.3  A historical episode: the U.S. Great Depression
23:856:52428:21:17:71:539:531:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In this section we use the historical record of the actual series of productivity shocks in the
23:857:52523:17:18:71:540:514:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:U.S. to study the predicted response of fertility to the productivity busts and booms that
23:858:52613:18:18:71:264:496:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:have occurred over the last 100 years.
23:859:52651:18:18:89:540:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We first focus on the dynasty most affected by the Great Depression, i.e., the cohort
23:860:52736:18:18:71:539:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:making fertility decisions in the 1930s (followed by the 1950s cohort, the 1970s cohort and
23:861:52827:18:18:71:163:442:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the 1990s cohort).
23:862:52845:18:18:89:540:424:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Second, we consider other dynasties also affected by the Great Depression but less so.
23:863:52931:18:18:71:540:406:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:That is, those making fertility choices either in the late 1920s and early 1930s (i.e., between
23:864:53026:18:18:71:539:388:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:1926 and 1935, etc.) or in the late 1930s and early 1940s (between 1936 and 1945, etc.).
23:865:53114:18:18:71:540:370:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Finally, we consider the dynasty making fertility choices in the 1920s (between 1921 and
23:866:53202:18:18:71:540:352:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:1930, etc). By construction, the Great Depression has no effect on the fertility choices of
23:867:53293:18:18:71:539:334:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this last dynasty. Thus, we simplify by assuming that there is no connection or opportunity
23:868:53384:18:18:71:540:316:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for trade between the four dynasties.  Cohorts within these dynasties make overlapping
23:869:53470:18:17:71:161:298:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:fertility decisions.
23:870:53490:17:18:89:540:281:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, the measure of fertility constructed in this way – using different shocks for dif-
23:871:53581:18:18:71:540:263:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ferent cohorts – corresponds to CTFR since it represents completed fertility for each cohort.
23:872:53674:18:18:71:539:245:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We also construct an analog for TFR, i.e., period fertility,by averaging over the two cohorts
23:873:53767:18:18:71:540:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:making their fertility decisions in any five-year period. Indoing this, we solve the model
23:874:53857:18:25:71:364:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:separately for the different dynasties and then aggregate.

23:876:53958:21:17:71:539:163:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:First, to focus on the effects of the Great Depression, we start with the dynasty making
23:877:54046:17:18:71:539:146:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:fertility decisions in the 1910s, 1930s, 1950s, 1970s and 1990s. This dynasty is the most
23:878:54135:18:18:71:539:128:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:affected by the Great Depression. As a benchmark, we assume that the initial state of the
23:879:54224:18:18:71:539:110:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dynasty is at its steady state age-distribution. In other words, the dynasty has been facing
23:880:54316:18:0:71:517:92:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:average shocks (s= 1) for a long time so that its current age-distribution is stationary.
24:881:54407:0:18:89:540:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:For this dynasty, the relevant series of productivity shocks,st, is shown in Table 4.
24:882:54492:18:18:71:539:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The results are shown in Figure 4. With a goods cost, the modelpredicts that fertility is
24:883:54581:18:18:71:540:671:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:19.1 percent below trend during the 1930s; with a time cost the prediction is 11.8 percent
24:884:54671:18:18:71:539:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:below trend. In the data, CTFR actually fell by 18.5 percent.Thus, the model captures
24:885:54756:18:18:71:539:635:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a significant fraction of this movement in either case. This is primarily due to the large,
24:886:54847:18:18:71:539:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:negative shock of 12.4 percent during the Great Depression of the 1930s – the dynasty’s
24:887:54934:18:18:71:539:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:young-to-old worker ratio is initially almost at its steadystate value and hence effects from
24:888:55027:18:33:71:158:581:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this are minimal.

24:911:55575:18:17:71:539:149:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This implies, a baby boom for the next cohort in this dynasty which takes place in the
24:912:55661:17:18:71:539:132:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:1950s. With a goods cost, the model prediction is an increasein fertility above trend of 34.9

25:916:56020:0:18:71:539:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the 1950s. For the purposes of comparison, the peak of the baby boom in the CTFR data
25:917:56108:18:18:71:204:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is 23 percent above trend.
25:918:56134:18:18:89:539:671:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In the model, the Great Depression has continuing impacts onthe fertility choices in this
25:919:56223:18:18:71:539:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dynasty – there are continued fluctuations with a decrease of11 to 18 percent below trend
25:920:56312:18:18:71:540:635:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the 1970s (due to the lagged response to the baby boom but dampened by the 3.9 percent
25:921:56401:18:18:71:539:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:upward fluctuation in TFP in the 1970s); this is followed by anincrease of 2.7 to 4.2 percent
25:922:56494:18:18:71:539:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:above trend in the 1990s – again a response to the low young-to-old worker ratio dampened
25:923:56583:18:18:71:407:581:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by the negative productivity shock of 8 percent during the 1990s.
25:924:56648:18:18:89:539:563:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:This is an extreme version of the baby bust and boom in the model because it is con-
25:925:56732:18:18:71:539:545:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:structed so that the cohort’s entire fertile period falls during the Great Depression. For other
25:926:56828:18:18:71:539:527:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cohorts or dynasties, the effects are mitigated because at least part of their fertile period
25:927:56921:18:18:71:539:509:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is unaffected by the Great Depression. This is also true for the baby boom: the dynasty
25:928:57008:18:17:71:539:491:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:considered here is most affected by the low young-to-old worker ratio and has a large positive
25:929:57102:17:25:71:288:474:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:productivity shock in the post-war period.

25:931:57182:21:18:71:539:428:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Table 5 shows how we construct our four dynasties. It illustrates the state variables and
25:932:57271:18:18:71:539:410:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:shocks for each cohort.  For each dynasty, we assume that the initial value of the state
25:933:57359:18:18:71:539:392:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:variable isn=nss,the balanced growth level of fertility. The first dynasty (d1) starts with
25:934:57450:18:18:72:540:374:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:women born between 1876-1880 (labeled 1880), cohort 1 (c1).  They face a productivity
25:935:57535:18:17:71:539:356:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:shock,s1,averaging over the period 1901-1910 when they are roughly age 20 to 30. Their

25:937:57706:18:18:71:539:321:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:years later, between 1881-1885 (labeled 1885), cohort 2 (c2). Their first productivity shock,
25:938:57799:18:18:71:539:303:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:s2,is obtained by averaging over 1906-15. Their fertility choice isnc2=n′(nss,s2).The
25:939:57884:18:18:71:540:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:third dynasty (d3) starts with women born between 1886-1890 (labeled 1890), cohort 3 (c3).
25:940:57974:18:18:71:540:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This is the most affected dynasty described above.  The fourthdynasty (d4) starts with
25:941:58060:18:18:71:539:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:women born between 1891-1895 (labeled 1895), cohort 4 (c4). Their first productivity shock
25:942:58150:18:18:71:540:231:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:s4,comes from averaging over the period 1916-1925.  Cohort 5, born between 1896-1900
25:943:58234:18:18:71:540:213:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(labeled 1900) are the next generation ind1. Their initial productivity shocks5,comes from
25:944:58324:18:18:71:539:195:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f8:B:averaging over the period 1921-30. Thus, their fertility choice is given bync5=n′(nc1,s5).
25:945:58414:18:18:71:540:177:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Proceeding further in this fashion leads to Cohort 9, born between 1916-1920 (labeled 1920),
25:946:58506:18:18:71:539:159:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the third generation in dynasty 1 making fertility decisions  between 1941 and 1950. The
25:947:58594:18:18:71:540:141:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:shock that this cohort faces is not affected by the Great Depression at all. We expand this
25:948:58685:18:17:71:539:123:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:series to Cohort 20, born between 1971-1975 (labeled 1975),the third generation in dynasty

27:996:60630:18:25:71:532:398:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is some effect – there are smaller deviations from trend both down and up, 20 years later.

27:1006:61274:18:18:71:540:245:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:have data until 2000, while for completed fertility the lastcohort in Jones and Tertilt (2008)
27:1007:61368:18:18:71:262:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:makes fertility decisions in the 1980s.
27:1008:61407:18:18:89:539:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The results are shown in Figure 6. Since deviations in TFR in the data are larger than
27:1009:61493:18:18:71:539:191:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:deviations in CTFR and since we are averaging over less affected cohorts, the model accounts
27:1010:61585:18:18:71:280:173:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for a smaller fraction of these deviations.
27:1011:61628:18:17:89:539:155:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:With a goods cost, the model predicts that TFR would be 12.7 percent below trend in

28:1033:62246:189:18:71:539:453:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:fertility decision during this period. In the data, the peakof the baby boom occurs in the
28:1034:62336:18:18:71:539:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:late 1950s when fertility is 31 percent above trend. With a goods cost, the model predicts
28:1035:62426:18:18:71:539:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:TFR will be 28.5 percent above trend while with a time cost, the prediction is 16.4 percent.
28:1036:62518:18:18:71:539:399:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Again, this result is a combination of the fertility response to the low young-to-old worker
28:1037:62610:18:17:71:539:381:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ratio due to the baby bust and the productivity boom in the 1950s and early 1960s. Hence,
28:1038:62699:17:18:71:540:364:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the model accounts for 38.5 to 62.6 percent of the baby bust and for 53 to 92 percent of the
28:1039:62791:18:18:71:174:346:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:baby boom in TFR.
28:1040:62808:18:18:89:540:328:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In subsequent periods, TFR in the model keeps fluctuating – 11.9 to 18.9 percent below
28:1041:62894:18:18:71:539:310:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trend in the late 1970s (due to the prior baby boom but dampened by the 3.9 percent increase
28:1042:62986:18:18:71:539:292:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in TFP). The corresponding movements in the data on TFR is 20.7 percent below trend.
28:1043:63070:18:18:71:540:274:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The increase in fertility in the 1990s of 7.1 percent above trend in the data is also partly
28:1044:63162:18:35:71:416:256:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:captured by the model which predicts a 2.8 to 4.7 percent increase.
28:1045:63229:35:25:71:189:221:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:C:5  Sensitivity
28:1046:63243:25:18:71:540:196:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In this section, we discuss the sensitivity of our results two types of changes.  The first
28:1047:63334:18:18:71:540:178:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:type take the parameters in Table 2 as given but change the wayproductivity shocks in
28:1048:63419:18:18:71:539:160:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Section 4.3 are computed. Here, we explore (1) changes in theage range used to assign TFP
28:1049:63508:18:18:71:539:142:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:shocks to different cohorts, and (2) the effects of using laborproductivity (LP) instead of
28:1050:63599:18:18:71:539:124:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:TFP. Given the nature of these experiments, elasticities and impulse responses remain the
28:1051:63688:18:18:71:539:106:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:same but the size of shocks differs. Results are reported in Figure 7. Increasing the age
28:1052:63777:18:0:71:540:88:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:range tends to decrease the effect of the Great Depression on fertility because it is diluted
29:1053:63872:0:18:71:539:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:across more cohorts.  Therefore, the predicted size of the baby boom is also smaller.  It
29:1054:63961:18:18:71:540:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:also affects the timing of the baby bust and boom. The results using labor productivity
29:1055:64048:18:18:71:540:671:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are very similar to the baseline, except for the cohort making fertility decisions in the 1910s
29:1056:64143:18:18:71:540:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:who experience a productivity boom and those making fertility decisions in the 1920s who
29:1057:64231:18:18:71:539:635:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:experience a significant negative shock. Due to endogenous fluctuations, these changes work
29:1058:64322:18:18:71:418:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:themselves through the fertility fluctuations later on in the century.
29:1059:64392:18:18:89:539:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The second type of change that we explore involves altering some of the basic features of
29:1060:64481:18:18:71:540:581:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the model. Here we study the robustness of our results both toincluding capital and having
29:1061:64571:18:18:71:540:563:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:more (i.e., shorter) time periods and hence, more active generations. We find that our basic
29:1062:64663:18:29:71:401:545:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:results are robust to these two qualitative changes to the model.
29:1063:64728:29:20:71:342:516:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:5.1  Age range of productivity shocks
29:1064:64765:20:18:71:539:496:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:One problem with the assumption that the only relevant shockfor the dynasty is when their
29:1065:64854:18:18:71:539:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:youngest cohort is age 20 to 30 is that it implicitly assumes that the shock lasts for the entire
29:1066:64951:18:18:71:539:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:period of 20 years. In this section, we describe model results when the shock is set to the
29:1067:65042:18:18:71:463:442:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:average productivity shock over the period where the cohortis age 20 to 40.
29:1068:65117:18:18:89:539:424:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 7(a), shows cohort productivity shocks for this experiment compared to the base-
29:1069:65204:18:18:71:539:406:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:line. Overall shocks are smoother and smaller because some busts and booms are smoothed
29:1070:65291:18:18:71:539:388:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:out due to the longer time period. Also, Cohortc5making part of their fertility decisions in
29:1071:65383:18:18:72:539:370:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the 1920s faces a relatively large negative shock due to the Great Depression in the 1930s
29:1072:65473:18:18:72:539:352:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:whenc5is age 30 to 40. Therefore, the baby bust starts earlier and issmaller than in the
29:1073:65561:18:18:72:540:334:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:baseline model as can be seen in Figure 7(b). Because of the smaller baby bust in the 1930s
29:1074:65652:18:18:72:511:316:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and smaller shocks, the baby boom is also smaller and so are subsequent fluctuations.
29:1075:65737:18:17:89:540:298:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The problem with this alternative is that it implicitly assumes that fertility is uniform
29:1076:65826:17:18:72:540:281:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:between age 20 and 40. Hence, the fertility decision of womenborn at the beginning of the
29:1077:65915:18:18:72:540:263:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:century is heavily affected by the Great Depression in this experiment when in reality most
29:1078:66006:18:18:72:329:245:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of them had completed their fertility in the 1920s.
29:1079:66057:18:18:89:539:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Since this alternative is at the opposite extreme of the baseline, the two experiments
29:1080:66143:18:18:72:539:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:together should give us reasonable bounds on how much of the fluctuations in fertility over
29:1081:66234:18:29:72:365:191:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:the 20th century in the U.S. the model can account for.20
29:1082:66291:29:21:72:469:162:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:5.2  Labor productivity versus total factor productivity
29:1083:66347:21:18:72:539:141:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Since there is no capital in our model, it is not clear wether we should use labor productivity
29:1084:66442:18:18:72:539:123:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(LP) or total factor productivity (TFP) to infer productivity shocks. The argument for using
29:1085:66534:18:16:81:539:105:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:20In Appendix A.2 we perform an experiment where TFP shocks areweighted by average age-specific
29:1086:66629:16:0:71:477:89:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:fertility rates. This is an intermediate case between the baseline and the present experiment.

30:1139:67360:9:34:71:166:302:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:compared to the baseline.
30:1140:67385:34:18:71:540:268:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:TFP is that if capital were included in the model, fertility would respond to TFP alongside
30:1141:67476:18:18:71:539:250:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:investment. The argument for using LP is that most people don’t own much capital (besides
30:1142:67565:18:18:71:469:232:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:durable goods and houses) so that their fertility response is to changes in LP.
30:1143:67644:18:17:89:539:214:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Here we perform the same experiment as in the main text but usedeviations from trend
30:1144:67728:17:18:71:539:197:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in LP instead of TFP. Again, we fit a linear trend through the LPdata.  The resulting
30:1145:67813:18:18:71:539:179:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:productivity shocks for each cohort are compared to the baseline in Figure 7(c). As can be
30:1146:67903:18:18:71:539:161:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:seen in the figure, there are two main differences between the LP compared to the TFP series
30:1147:67995:18:18:71:540:143:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of shocks. The very first cohort making fertility decisions in the early 1900s experience a

30:1149:68176:18:18:71:539:107:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:significant negative shock. Therefore, as shown in Figure 7(d), the baby bust is already well
30:1150:68269:18:0:71:539:89:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:underway at this time. Despite the similar size of the shock in the 1930s, fertility decreases
31:1151:68365:0:18:71:540:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:less in the LP case than in the TFP case. This is because of the mitigating effect of the low
31:1152:68458:18:18:71:539:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:young-to-old worker ration due to low fertility in the 1910s. Subsequently, the baby boom
31:1153:68547:18:18:71:539:671:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:starts earlier but is of similar size as the baseline due to the larger LP shock in the 1950s
31:1154:68640:18:18:71:460:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and 1960s compared to TFP. Overall, however, the results arequite similar.
31:1155:68714:18:18:89:539:635:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Note that the growth rate of LP in the data is 2.23 percent per year on average, while
31:1156:68800:18:18:71:539:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:it is only 1.61 percent per year for TFP. Also, the estimated standard deviation of shocks
31:1157:68890:18:18:71:539:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is 0.08 in most simulations while it is only 0.07 for TFP. In the experiment above, we held
31:1158:68981:18:18:71:539:581:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:these two parameters constant so that we perform only one change at a time and this may
31:1159:69068:18:29:71:245:563:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:have some effect on the outcomes.

31:1161:69147:20:18:71:539:514:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In this section we show that including physical capital as analternative investment into the
31:1162:69239:18:18:71:540:496:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model does not change the contemporaneous elasticity to productivity shocks for reasonable
31:1163:69329:18:18:71:539:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:calibrations. To do this while keeping the size of the parameter space small, we consider
31:1164:69418:18:18:71:539:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the special case wherew2= 0 andθ(st) =θ(i.e. the goods cost case) and compare two

32:1231:70718:18:18:89:539:550:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Some useful intuition can be gained by examining the case where capital fully depreciates

32:1240:70975:36:18:72:539:443:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:as above. Thus, the elasticity of fertility with respect to aproductivity shocks is the same
32:1241:71067:18:18:72:167:425:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the two models.
32:1242:71085:18:18:89:539:407:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Ifδ <1, this is not the case, but under realistic assumptions about the annual rate of
32:1243:71171:18:18:72:539:389:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:depreciation the effects are quantitatively similar. To seethis, we use the same parameters
32:1244:71262:18:17:72:540:371:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:as in the baseline, exceptw2= 0. Further, we follow Jones and Schoonbroodt (2010) and
32:1245:71347:17:18:72:540:354:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:setα= 0.33 andδ= 1−(1−0.088)20. Finally, we calibrateθ= 0.0214 to get an annual
32:1246:71426:18:18:72:539:336:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:population growth rate of 0.65. The wage,w1, is not fixed in this model but moves with the
32:1247:71516:18:18:72:540:318:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:marginal product of labor. Therefore, the relevant magnitude to be compared toθ= 0.19 in
32:1248:71604:18:18:72:540:300:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the baseline model, wherew1was normalized tow1= 1, is the cost of children as a fraction
32:1249:71692:18:18:72:271:282:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of one person’s income,θ/w1= 0.1609.
32:1250:71728:18:18:89:540:264:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We find that, with these parameters, the fertility response to a 1 percent deviation in
32:1251:71815:18:18:72:539:246:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:productivity decreases from 1.0 to 0.9938. Hence, introducing capital into the model with
32:1252:71904:18:29:72:538:228:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:one period working life tends to dampen the effects of productivity shocks ever so slightly.21

32:1254:72035:21:17:72:539:178:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:While the initial fertility response to productivity shocks is very similar whetherw2>0 or
32:1255:72125:17:18:72:540:161:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:w2= 0, dampened oscillations only occur whenw2>0. Since this property of the model
32:1256:72207:18:16:81:539:143:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:21One can show show that in a model with stochastic ageing (useful to obtain reasonable working life
32:1257:72307:16:12:71:540:127:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:lengths while keeping the state space small), the elasticity is larger (smaller) than 1 if the adult survival
32:1258:72416:12:12:71:540:115:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:rate is larger (smaller) than (1−δ).  Since in the present model, survival in the workforce is zero, this
32:1259:72521:12:12:71:540:103:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:is an extreme special case. Thus, introducing capital in general does not change the fertility response to
32:1260:72627:12:0:71:207:91:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:productivity shocks very much.
33:1261:72659:0:18:71:539:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is important both qualitatively and quantitatively, in this subsection we study whether this

33:1263:72840:18:18:71:540:671:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of working life and show that similar dampened oscillationsoccur in this case. Thus, we
33:1264:72927:18:18:71:539:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:assume thatw3>0. Since this increases the number of state variables by one,we abstract
33:1265:73013:18:18:72:539:635:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from productivity shocks thereby reducing the size of the state-space back to two. In the
33:1266:73102:18:18:72:540:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:experiments, we take the initial fertility deviation in andaround the 1930s as given and
33:1267:73190:18:18:72:256:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:evaluate the oscillations that follow.

33:1306:73645:18:18:72:517:319:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is decreasing inn′with a positive intercept atn′= 0. Thus, there is a unique solution.

33:1309:73896:18:18:72:539:265:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:whenn−increases and hence, there will necessarily be some oscillatory behavior. This is
33:1310:73983:18:18:72:539:247:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:complicated however sinceLHSdepends onn. Which wayLHSshifts following an increase

33:1312:74149:18:18:72:540:211:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ifV13>0 thenLHSshifts up whennincreases and, hence,n′unambiguously decreases.
33:1313:74226:18:18:72:539:193:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:However, ifV13<0, thenLHSshifts down whennincreases and, hence, the overall effect

33:1315:74325:18:17:89:539:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In what follows, we compare simulations of this model to simulations in the baseline

34:1337:74932:189:18:89:539:453:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We assume the model period is 15 years. Thus, people work fromage 15 to age 60. Hence,
34:1338:75018:18:18:71:540:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we will have three, instead of four dynasties, five years apart from each other. We keep all
34:1339:75110:18:18:71:540:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the parameters the same as in the baseline, except forw3and the cost of children,θ. We

34:1341:75285:18:17:71:540:381:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Calibrated costs don’t change much from the baseline (θ= 0.1932 orb= 0.1927). Here, we
34:1342:75371:17:18:71:539:364:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:findθ= 0.1946 to match the steady state population growth rate of 0.65percent per year as
34:1343:75460:18:18:71:540:346:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:before. In the intermediate deterministic version withw3= 0,θ= 0.1901. Incidentally, note
34:1344:75549:18:18:71:539:328:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that in all these simulationsV13<0 so that the effects of last period’s fertility on current
34:1345:75641:18:18:71:190:310:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:fertility are ambiguous.
34:1346:75665:18:18:89:539:292:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The simulation consists of off balanced growth path dynamicstaking the fertility devia-
34:1347:75752:18:18:71:539:274:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tion in and around the 1930s from the baseline as given. That is, everything plotted until
34:1348:75842:18:18:71:539:256:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:1940 is exogenous here and we are interested in the baby boom and the potential for damp-
34:1349:75931:18:18:71:539:238:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ened oscillations thereafter. Note that in the deterministic version of the model, whether
34:1350:76021:18:18:71:539:220:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:costs are in terms of time or goods is irrelevant – the only reason why the two cases would
34:1351:76112:18:18:71:534:202:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:differ here is that we use different baby busts from the baseline results as initial conditions.
34:1352:76208:18:18:89:539:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 8 showsCTFRfor all cohorts for goods costs. As can be seen, magnitudes don’t
34:1353:76291:18:18:71:539:166:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:differ much between the deterministic model with two versus three periods of working life.
34:1354:76381:18:18:71:540:148:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Hence, most of the difference to the baseline results are due to the lack of additional pro-
34:1355:76473:18:17:71:539:130:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ductivity shocks, reinforcing the baby boom (and hence subsequent fluctuations). However,
34:1356:76562:17:18:71:539:113:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the baby boom happens slightly earlier. This is less of an issue of length of the period as
34:1357:76653:18:0:71:540:95:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:it is one of length of generations. In the three period model,parents and children are 15,
35:1358:76745:0:18:71:540:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:instead of 20 years apart. The analogous results forCTFRwith a time cost andTFRwith
35:1359:76828:18:18:72:410:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:both goods and time costs are similar and hence are not included.
35:1360:76893:18:18:89:540:671:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In sum, the dampened oscillations we find in the baseline model are not just an artifact
35:1361:76981:18:35:72:249:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of having two periods working life.
35:1362:77016:35:25:72:294:618:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:C:6  International Evidence
35:1363:77041:25:18:72:539:593:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In this section, we show that countries with a smaller Depression in the 1930s also tend
35:1364:77129:18:18:72:540:575:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to have smaller baby busts and that those with smaller baby busts tend to have smaller
35:1365:77215:18:18:72:539:557:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:baby booms in the 1950s, conditional on the economic circumstances in the 1950s. Before
35:1366:77302:18:18:72:540:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we start, several data related issues should be addressed. These relate to data availability,
35:1367:77395:18:18:72:330:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:detrending methods and dealing with war periods.
35:1368:77443:18:18:89:539:503:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Ideally, we would like to use the same measures of fertility and productivity as we do for
35:1369:77533:18:18:72:539:485:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the U.S.. However, for the 20th century complete TFR series and consistent TFP measures
35:1370:77620:18:18:72:540:467:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are only available for few countries (see e.g., Chesnais (1992) for TFR and Cette et al. (2009)
35:1371:77715:18:18:72:540:449:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for TFP). We therefore use Crude Birth Rates (CBR) mostly from Mitchell (1998) and GDP
35:1372:77801:18:17:72:540:431:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:per capita from Barro and Ursua (2008), instead.22This gives us 17 countries for which we
35:1373:77890:17:18:72:242:414:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:have data from 1900 until 1993.23
35:1374:77923:18:18:89:540:396:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:As to detrending, for CBR, we use the same detrending method as we did for TFR in the
35:1375:78008:18:18:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:U.S., namely a Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter. While for the U.S. a linear detrending method
35:1376:78098:18:18:72:540:360:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for log-TFP poses few problems, this is not true for all countries we consider. In particular,
35:1377:78192:18:18:72:539:342:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:if one uses linear detrending, countries such as Portugal orJapan show a permanent negative
35:1378:78283:18:18:72:539:324:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:deviation in GDP early in the century and a permanent positive one later on. Besides the

35:1380:78446:18:18:89:539:288:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Furthermore, the two world wars affected fertility levels inseveral ways that are unrelated
35:1381:78537:18:18:72:539:270:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to our mechanism. For example, men being away to fight prevents some women from having
35:1382:78623:18:18:72:540:252:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:children. Typically, there is rapid catching up as soon as the men return, if they do (e.g.,
35:1383:78715:18:18:72:539:234:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:see the period 1943-1946 in U.S. data shown in Figure 3). The longer the war involvement
35:1384:78803:18:18:72:540:216:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and the larger the death rate of soldiers, the more unpredictable this effect on fertility rates
35:1385:78899:18:17:72:539:198:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:becomes.  Similar issues emerge for GDP data during war periods. For example, a large
35:1386:78984:17:16:81:540:181:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:22CBR data form 1900 to 1993 are obtained from Mitchell (1998) for all countries, except Germany.
35:1387:79081:16:12:71:540:165:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:German data was combined using Chesnais (1992, Appendix A1)for the 1900 to 1943 period and Statistisches
35:1388:79185:12:12:71:540:153:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:Bundesamt (2007) for 1946 to 1993, linearly interpolating 1944 and 1945. All GDP per capita data comes
35:1389:79287:12:8:71:462:141:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:from Barro and Ursua (2008) and is in millions 1990 International Geary-Khamis dollars.
35:1390:79374:8:16:81:539:133:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:23The main issues are. CBR as opposed to TFR is sensitive to mortality in certain groups of the population
35:1391:79480:16:12:71:539:117:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:such as wars which affect total population but not the number of fertile women. GDP per capita as opposed
35:1392:79585:12:12:71:539:105:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:to TFP or LP is only an indirect measure of the productivity ofthe labor force and therefore corresponds
35:1393:79689:12:0:71:169:93:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:less well to our model.
36:1394:79714:0:18:71:539:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:part of the increase in output in Germany during the war was not for private consumption
36:1395:79802:18:18:71:540:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:but rather war related. We therefore also use dummies for warand immediately after war
36:1396:79888:18:18:71:540:671:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:periods to adjust our measures of deviations in CBR and GDP incomparison to deviations
36:1397:79974:18:18:71:356:653:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:resulting from a simple linear trend and the HP filter.24
36:1398:80031:18:18:89:539:635:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Given these provisos, we are now ready to analyze sizes of depressions, baby busts and
36:1399:80117:18:18:71:539:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:baby booms. First, we aim to determine the correlation between the size of the Depression
36:1400:80206:18:18:71:540:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the 1930s and the size of the baby bust at the time across countries. Since the timing of
36:1401:80298:18:18:71:540:581:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the Depression was different across countries, we divide the1930s into two periods: 1930 to
36:1402:80389:18:18:71:539:563:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:1934 and 1935 to 1939. We then run eight cross-country OLS regressions, one for each time
36:1403:80478:18:18:71:539:545:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:period combined with one of four detrending methods. Let̂Xitdenote the percent deviation

36:1416:81084:18:18:89:539:372:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Second, we aim to determine whether a larger baby bust in the 1930s implies a larger

38:1484:83911:25:18:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In this paper, we have studied the properties of models of fertility choice with dynastic al-

38:1486:84093:18:18:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that in simple versions of this class of models, fertility isprocyclical and has dampened

38:1488:84271:18:18:72:540:480:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:titatively significant. In calibrated simulations of the model, we find that in response to a

38:1490:84456:18:17:72:540:444:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:between 40 and 70 percent of the decline actually seen in the data. Moreover, because of a
38:1491:84546:17:18:72:539:427:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(mild) productivity boom in the 1950s and early 1960s in conjunction with the oscillatory
38:1492:84635:18:18:72:539:409:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effects discussed above, the model accounts for between 60 and 90 percent of the Baby Boom.

45:1656:93218:0:26:71:433:707:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:A.2  Additional experiment relating to Section 5.1
45:1657:93268:26:18:71:540:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:A second alternative is to use the average productivity shock ages 15 to 45, weighted by the
45:1658:93360:18:18:71:539:663:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:percentage of all births born to the particular age-groups.This takes the typical timing of
45:1659:93451:18:18:71:539:645:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:births into account. In addition, even if the shock we attribute to any individual cohort does
45:1660:93545:18:18:71:540:627:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:not correspond to the actual 20 year shock they experienced,it leaves the aggregate shock
45:1661:93634:18:18:71:540:609:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in any five year period at its correct level (since different dynasties receive a fraction of it).
45:1662:93732:18:35:71:540:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:To see this, consider Table A.4. Now, consider a cohort that is age 15-19 in 1901-05. The

45:1666:94015:57:18:71:539:458:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:seven relevant shocks are from 1901-05 to 1931-35. However,the weight of the shock in the
45:1667:94104:18:18:71:539:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:beginning of the Great Depression, 1931-35, will only receive weight 0.0018. The next cohort
45:1668:94196:18:18:71:539:422:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of women, age 15-19 in 1906-10 will receive a weight of 0.0239for the same shock and so on.
45:1669:94287:18:18:71:540:404:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Finally, the cohort age 15-19 in 1931-35 will receive a weight 0.1245 for this shock. Hence,
45:1670:94379:18:18:71:539:386:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:100 percent of the Great Depression shock will be accounted for as part of 7 distinct cohort
45:1671:94471:18:18:71:540:368:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:shocks. The results from this experiment can be seen in Figure A.1. The results are quite
45:1672:94560:18:17:71:522:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:similar, albeit smoother and somewhat smaller, to the baseline described in Section 4.3.
45:1673:94648:17:18:89:540:333:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Note, however, that this alternative does not allow our cohorts to adjust their timing
45:1674:94734:18:18:71:539:315:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of births to shocks experienced at different ages while fertile. As shown in Doepke et al.
45:1675:94824:18:18:71:540:297:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(2007), timing of births for any given cohort did change during the bust-boom-bust episode,
45:1676:94915:18:18:71:539:279:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:albeit to a limited extent. As mentioned before, decreasingthe length of the period in order
45:1677:95007:18:18:71:540:261:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to start addressing this issue would significantly increasethe state space. In addition, it
45:1678:95098:18:18:71:539:243:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:would to require a bulk of additional assumptions and complicate the theoretical results.
45:1679:95187:18:18:71:539:225:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We therefore chose to concentrate on the two simple mechanisms from Proposition 1 in the

47:1746:97149:0:26:71:428:707:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:A.3.1  Observations about Cross-Country Busts and Booms
47:1747:97204:26:18:71:539:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:From Tables A.5 and A.6 we make the following observations. Countries that, similar to
47:1748:97290:18:18:71:539:663:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the U.S., have large depressions and large baby busts throughout the 1930s are Canada,
47:1749:97376:18:18:71:540:645:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Australia and New Zealand.  Countries with slightly smallerdepressions and baby busts
47:1750:97461:18:18:71:540:627:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are Germany, the U.K. and France.  Note that France has a late depression (late 1930s)
47:1751:97547:18:18:71:539:609:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and correspondingly, a late baby bust while Germany and the U.K. have large depressions
47:1752:97634:18:18:71:540:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the early 1930s and correspondingly large baby busts early on.  For the Netherlands,
47:1753:97721:18:17:71:540:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Belgium and Switzerland, the depression is noticeable onlyif the effects of wars are taken
47:1754:97811:17:18:71:540:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:into account when detrending (Table A.6). For Southern European countries, Italy, Portugal
47:1755:97901:18:18:71:539:538:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and Spain, both the depression as well as the baby bust are small or non-existent, depending
47:1756:97993:18:18:71:539:520:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on detrending method. For Northern European countries, Denmark, Norway and Sweden,
47:1757:98075:18:18:71:539:502:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:large baby busts can be observed, despite the fact that the depression is small or non-existent
47:1758:98170:18:18:71:500:484:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:depending on detrending method. These observations rationalize results in Table 6.
47:1759:98252:18:15:89:539:466:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Because of the last observation, when analyzing baby booms in the main text, we use
47:1760:98335:15:21:74:539:451:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f2:B:̂CBR1930srather than̂GDP1930sas the independent variable. This allows us to determine
47:1761:98420:21:18:71:539:430:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:whether baby busts are correlated with subsequent baby booms, independently of their cause.
47:1762:98511:18:18:89:540:412:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Indeed, from Tables A.7 and A.8, all three Northern countries display substantial baby
47:1763:98597:18:18:71:540:394:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:booms in the 1950s, though potentially mitigated by a recession in the 1950s. Similarly,
47:1764:98685:18:18:71:540:376:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Central European and Southern European countries, all havesmall baby booms in the late
47:1765:98771:18:18:71:539:358:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:1950s with GDP significantly below trend for most detrendingmethods. Southern European
47:1766:98857:18:17:71:540:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:countries have somewhat of a baby boom. The largest baby booms are to be observed in
47:1767:98941:17:18:71:539:323:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand where the baby bust was particularly large.
47:1768:99028:18:35:71:380:305:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:These observations rationalize the weaker results in Table7.
47:1769:99088:35:26:71:368:270:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:A.4  Sensitivity to changes in parameters
47:1770:99129:26:18:71:539:244:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we compute how elasticities and fertility levels change when we change parameter values
47:1771:99216:18:18:71:540:226:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in Table 2. Results are reported in Table A.9. For each parameter change, we report two
47:1772:99303:18:18:71:539:208:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cases.  First, we give results in the case where costs of children remain at their baseline
47:1773:99394:18:17:71:539:190:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:value, which leads to varying fertility levels in steady state. Second, we recalibrate to the
47:1774:99487:17:18:71:539:173:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:target population growth by adjusting costs of children accordingly.  Results show that
47:1775:99574:18:18:71:540:155:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:within a reasonable range of parameter values, the elasticity of contemporaneous fertility to
47:1776:99667:18:18:71:539:137:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:productivity shocks ranges from 1.6 to 1.9 in the goods cost case and 0.95 to 1.2 for the time
47:1777:99761:18:18:71:539:119:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cost case, while the elasticity of lagged fertility ranges from -1.25 to -1.9 in the goods cost
47:1778:99856:18:18:71:539:101:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:case and -0.7 to -1.2 for the time cost case, whether we recalibrate or not. Thus, the results
47:1779:99950:18:0:71:342:83:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:don’t seem to be very sensitive to parameter choices.
