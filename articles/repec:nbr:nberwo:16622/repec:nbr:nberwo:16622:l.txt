2:31:1608:28:28:273:338:616:12:Times:12:Times:C:ABSTRACT
2:32:1616:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:We study the implications of hedging for firm financing and investment. We do so using an extensive,
2:33:1716:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:hand-collected dataset on corporate hedging activities. Hedging can lower the odds of negative firm
2:34:1815:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:realizations, reducing the expected costs of financial distress. In theory, this should ease a firm's access
2:35:1923:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:to credit. Using a tax-based instrumental variable approach, we find that hedgers pay lower interest
2:36:2023:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:spreads and are less likely to have capital expenditure restrictions in their loan agreements. These favorable
2:37:2133:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:financing terms, in turn, allow hedgers to invest more. Our tests characterize two exact channels (cost
2:38:2236:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:of borrowing and investment restrictions) through which hedging affects corporate outcomes. The
2:39:2331:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:analysis we present shows that hedging has a first-order effect on firm financing and investment, and
2:40:2432:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:provides new insights into how hedging affects corporate wealth. More broadly, our study contributes
2:41:2532:14:42:72:385:462:12:Times:12:Times:C:novel evidence on the real consequences of financial contracting.

3:65:3026:0:19:85:547:716:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Active corporate risk management would be irrelevant in a Modigliani-Miller world of perfect
3:66:3118:19:18:68:547:697:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:capital markets. Yet, risk management through Önancial hedging has become increasingly important
3:67:3214:18:19:68:547:679:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in recent years. According to BIS, at the end of December 2009, the notional value of outstanding
3:68:3311:19:18:68:547:660:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:interest rate (IR) and foreign exchange (FX) derivatives held by non-Önancial customers was $35.6
3:69:3408:18:18:68:547:642:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:trillion and $8.8 trillion, respectively. By comparison, at the end of 2000 those numbers were only $6.1
3:70:3512:18:19:68:547:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:trillion and $3.3 trillion. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) reports that
3:71:3611:19:18:68:547:605:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:virtually all of the worldís largest companies use derivatives to hedge their business and Önancial risks.
3:72:3717:18:19:85:547:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Despite their widespread use, there is limited evidence on the real and Önancial implications of
3:73:3813:19:18:68:547:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:derivatives hedging.1Starting with Nance et al. (1993), Tufano (1996), and GÈczy et al. (1997), most
3:74:3913:18:19:68:547:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:prior studies investigate variables that explain cross-sectional variation in the use of derivatives by
3:75:4016:19:18:68:547:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Örms (hedging determinants). More recent papers look at the relation between hedging and corporate
3:76:4114:18:18:68:547:513:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:valuation. Allayannis and Weston (2001) and Carter et al. (2006), for example, Önd that hedging is
3:77:4212:18:19:68:547:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:associated with some 5% to 10% increase in Örm value. Other studies, however, report more mixed
3:78:4307:19:18:68:547:476:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:results (see Jin and Jorion (2006)). Examining the relation between hedging and Örm value is an
3:79:4402:18:19:68:547:458:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:intuitive way of gauging the welfare implications of hedging. Estimates of that relation, however, do
3:80:4503:19:18:68:298:439:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:not showhowhedging a§ects corporate welfare.
3:81:4547:18:19:85:547:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:This study identiÖes precise mechanisms through which hedging a§ects real and Önancial corporate
3:82:4643:19:18:68:547:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:outcomes.  It does so by examining the impact of hedging on Örmsí external Önancing costs and
3:83:4736:18:18:68:550:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:investment spending.  Theory proposes a straightforward connection between hedging and Örmsí
3:84:4828:18:19:68:547:366:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ability to raise funds: hedging reduces the probability of lower-tail realizations, reducing the expected
3:85:4933:19:18:68:546:347:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:costs associated with Önancial distress and bankruptcy (Smith and Stulz (1985) and Stulz (1996)).2
3:86:5031:18:19:68:547:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In theory, hedging commits Örms to meeting obligations in states of the world in which they would fail
3:87:5133:19:18:68:547:310:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(Bessembinder (1991)) and makes it more di¢ cult for managers to engage in risk-shifting (Campbell
3:88:5231:18:19:68:547:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and Kracaw (1990)). Both of these e§ects should improve the contract terms Örms obtain from their
3:89:5328:19:18:68:547:273:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:lenders, including credit facilities that carry lower interest rates and have fewer investment restrictions.
3:90:5436:18:18:85:547:255:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:It is possible, however, for Örms to unwind their hedging positions after signing contracts with
3:91:5532:18:19:68:547:237:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:their lenders. After loans are granted, for example, managers may buy new instruments that o§set
3:92:5628:19:18:68:547:218:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:their previous positions, or may cancel their hedging programs altogether. Contrary to this notion,
3:93:5727:18:19:68:547:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Purnanandam (2008) presents a theory showing that it is optimal for managers facing distress to keep
3:94:5827:19:18:68:547:181:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:their hedges after issuing debt. In addition, reputational concerns may prevent Örms from deceiving
3:95:5926:18:19:68:547:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:banks with ex-post changes in their hedging programs. Yet another safeguard against opportunistic
3:96:6023:19:18:68:547:144:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:behavior by Örms is the use of ìperformance pricingî in loan agreements, which allows banks to
3:97:6117:18:16:68:547:126:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:increase interest spreads after loans are granted. If hedging programs are often reversed in the post-

3:99:6335:11:15:80:546:99:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:2These costs include direct bankruptcy costs (e.g., lawyersícharges and administrative fees) as well as indirect costs
3:100:6453:15:0:68:547:84:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:due to the potential loss of customers, suppliers, and growth opportunities (Bris et al. (2006) and Purnanandam (2008)).
4:101:6574:0:19:68:522:716:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:loan period, one should not observe hedgers obtaining better contract terms with their lenders.
4:102:6669:19:18:85:547:697:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:To investigate the ultimate e§ect of hedging on Örm outcomes, we use a new, hand-collected
4:103:6759:18:19:68:547:679:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:dataset on derivatives contracts. For each Örm in our dataset, we also gather detailed information on
4:104:6860:19:18:68:547:660:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:private credit agreements. These matched data allow us to identify links between hedging activity,
4:105:6958:18:18:68:547:642:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:external Önancing costs, and investment restrictions. While we describe the data gathering process
4:106:7056:18:19:68:547:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:below, it is worth highlighting the key features of our approach. We focus on private credit agree-
4:107:7155:19:18:68:547:605:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ments in the syndicated loan market because this market has become the largest source of corporate
4:108:7253:18:19:68:547:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:funding in the last two decades.3Importantly, our investigation requires Önely-deÖned data, and
4:109:7348:19:18:68:547:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:bank loans contain covenants that are more detailed, comprehensive, and tightly set than other credit
4:110:7449:18:19:68:547:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:instruments. With these considerations in mind, our data gathering process starts from a sample
4:111:7544:19:18:68:547:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of loans collected from various sources. We then hand collect information on borrowersíderivatives
4:112:7642:18:18:68:547:513:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:usage from their SEC Ölings. This yields a dataset of over one thousand individual Örms for which we
4:113:7742:18:19:68:547:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:obtain additional information on characteristics, such as size, proÖtability, and investment spending
4:114:7843:19:18:68:155:476:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:over several years.
4:115:7862:18:19:85:547:458:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Our evidence suggests that hedging reduces the cost of external Önancing and eases the Örmís
4:116:7954:19:18:68:547:439:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:investment process. The results we Önd are economically and statistically signiÖcant. For example, a
4:117:8054:18:19:68:547:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:one-standard deviation increase in hedging intensity (the amount of interest rate and currency hedg-
4:118:8154:19:18:68:547:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ing over total assets) is associated with a reduction of about 54 basis points in loan spreads. This is a
4:119:8259:18:18:68:547:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:signiÖcant number when compared to the average loan spread of 189 basis points (a 29% reduction).
4:120:8356:18:19:68:547:366:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We also estimate that a one-standard deviation increase in hedging intensity reduces by 20% the odds
4:121:8456:19:18:68:547:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of having an investment restriction covenant in a loan contract. Our tests further characterize the
4:122:8555:18:19:68:547:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:direct, positive impact of hedging intensity on investment spending. In all, the estimates we present
4:123:8656:19:18:68:481:310:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are new to the literature and highlight the economic signiÖcance of corporate hedging.
4:124:8742:18:19:85:547:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Simultaneity is a source of concern for any study dealing with Önancial decision-making, including
4:125:8840:19:18:68:547:273:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:corporate risk management. Relative to other studies, this issue is minimized in our tests because
4:126:8938:18:18:68:547:255:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:loan spreads and capital expenditure restrictions are set by the Örmsícreditors and by competitive
4:127:9036:18:19:68:547:237:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:forces in the market for loanable funds (i.e., observed outcomes are not Örm-choice variables). More-
4:128:9137:19:18:68:547:218:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:over, as we discuss below, there is an ìinstitutional mismatchîbetween providers of loan and hedging
4:129:9237:18:19:68:547:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:contracts (outcomes and treatment status are not jointly set by the Örmís creditors).  Yet, Örms
4:130:9333:19:18:68:547:181:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:choose to accept the contracts that are observed by the econometrician. Accordingly, our inferences
4:131:9432:18:19:68:547:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:could be biased in case Örmsíchoices are confounded with factors that ináuence observed outcomes
4:132:9528:19:18:68:547:144:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and that are not accounted for in our baseline model. To alleviate this problem, we need to Önd a
4:133:9625:18:18:68:547:126:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:variable (or instrument) that is related to Örmsíhedging policies, but that is not directly related to
4:134:9727:18:16:68:475:108:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:their creditorsídecisions regarding interest rates and capital expenditure restrictions.
4:135:9815:16:15:80:546:92:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:3Syndicated loan issuance grew from approximately $150 billion in 1987 to $1.7 trillion in 2007, surpassing corporate
4:136:9932:15:0:68:367:77:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:bond issuance to become the most important corporate Önancing channel.
5:137:10003:0:19:85:547:716:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The literature does not provide much guidance on this estimation issue and we fail to identify
5:138:10097:19:18:68:547:697:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:events that could work as surrogates for ìnatural experiments in hedging.î However, we identify a
5:139:10194:18:19:68:547:679:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:plausible instrumental approach that arises from institutional features of the U.S. tax system. When
5:140:10294:19:18:68:547:660:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:their relevant tax schedule is convex, Örms can reduce their expected tax liabilities by hedging in
5:141:10393:18:18:68:547:642:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:order to minimize income volatility (see, e.g., Smith and Stulz (1985), Graham and Smith (1999),
5:142:10489:18:19:68:547:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and Petersen and Thiagarajan (2000)). The convexity of statutory tax rates thus provides Örms with
5:143:10587:19:18:68:547:605:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:incentives to hedge (inclusion restriction). At the same time, tax convexityper seis unlikely to exert a
5:144:10691:18:19:68:547:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:direct, Örst-order e§ect on the terms creditors include in their Önancing agreements (exclusion restric-
5:145:10795:19:18:68:546:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tion).4With these restrictions in place, we implement an instrumental variableñÖxed e§ects estimator
5:146:10895:18:19:68:529:550:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:that deals with endogeneity by exploiting tax-related non-linearities in the demand for hedging.5
5:147:10992:19:18:85:547:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Our baseline results conform to a theory in which hedging eases Örm Önancing by reducing the
5:148:11084:18:18:68:547:513:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:likelihood of states in which costs of Önancial distress are high and the Örm engages in risk shifting.
5:149:11187:18:19:68:547:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Those results, however, may not show direct evidence of these dynamics. To substantiate our infer-
5:150:11285:19:18:68:547:476:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ences, we then examine whether variables that capture the potential for Önancial distress and asset
5:151:11384:18:19:68:547:458:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:substitution modulate the relation between hedging and loan contracts in tandem with our central
5:152:11480:19:18:68:121:439:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:hypothesis.
5:153:11491:18:19:85:547:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:As a Örst check, we include Altmanís Z-score and its interaction with hedging in our baseline
5:154:11584:19:18:68:547:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:model. We would expect Z-score to have a negative impact on loan spreads since riskier Örms (those
5:155:11682:18:18:68:547:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with lower Z-scores) should be charged higher interest. This is exactly what we Önd. More interesting,
5:156:11784:18:19:68:547:366:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:however, is the coe¢ cient attracted by the hedgingñZ-score interaction term. This term returns a
5:157:11881:19:18:68:547:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:positive, statistically signiÖcant coe¢ cient, implying a pronounced dampening of the negative asso-
5:158:11981:18:19:68:547:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ciation between Z-scores and loan spreads for Örms that hedge more.6Simply put, our estimations
5:159:12076:19:18:68:529:310:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:imply that hedging is more valuable for borrowers facing a higher likelihood of Önancial distress.
5:160:12174:18:19:85:547:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Examining whether asset substitution also changes the relation between hedging and loan spreads
5:161:12269:19:18:68:547:273:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is more challenging. To capture that e§ect, we use a surrogate proxy that reáects a Örmís investment
5:162:12369:18:18:68:547:255:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:growth options; namely, the ratio of market-to-book value of assets (M/B). The premise behind this
5:163:12467:18:19:68:547:237:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:strategy is that Örms with more growth options should have greater latitude in shifting their invest-
5:164:12568:19:18:68:547:218:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ments towards riskier assets (see related approaches in Johnson (2003) and Eisdorfer (2008)). We
5:165:12664:18:19:68:547:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:interact that proxy with hedging, similarly to what we do with Z-scores above. Our tests return a
5:166:12761:19:18:68:547:181:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:negative coe¢ cient on the hedgingñM/B interaction, suggesting that the negative e§ect of hedging
5:167:12858:18:16:68:547:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on loan spreads is greater for Örms whose investment opportunity set is likely to allow for greater risk
5:168:12962:16:15:80:546:147:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:4Notice that this is an idiosyncratic, time-varying e§ect that is di¢ cult to measure and price in a loan. At a more
5:169:13078:15:11:68:547:132:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:practical level, the loan o¢ cers we consulted say they do not consider subtle tax issues (such as convexity) in their loan
5:170:13201:11:7:68:360:121:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:pricing schemes because their claims on Örmsíincome are gross of taxes.
5:171:13272:7:15:80:546:114:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:5We show in Section II.B that identiÖcation does not come from Örm income level, which would ináuence loan
5:172:13378:15:7:68:547:99:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:spreads, but from well-identiÖed non-linearities (e.g., kinks) in the tax schedules (after controlling for Örm income level).
5:173:13503:7:15:80:546:92:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:6As shown below, we reach similar conclusions when we study the interplay between Önancial distress and hedging
5:174:13614:15:0:68:212:77:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:using a ìdistance-to-defaultîproxy.
6:175:13650:0:19:68:536:716:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:taking. In other words, hedging is more valuable for those Örms with a higher ability to risk-shift.
6:176:13750:19:18:85:547:697:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Our base tests show that hedging reduces promised, contractual rates in loan contracts. Naturally,
6:177:13848:18:19:68:547:679:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the Örmís observed loan spread includes a portion compensating investors for the expected default loss
6:178:13950:19:18:68:547:660:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:due to idiosyncratic risks and a portion compensating investors for the undiversiÖable risks of debt.
6:179:14051:18:18:68:547:642:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Accordingly, the observed drop in spreads is a necessary but not a su¢ cient condition for the cost of
6:180:14153:18:19:68:547:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:capital to be reduced, since it could be caused by a drop in the expected default risk premium, rather
6:181:14255:19:18:68:547:605:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:than a drop in the (true) cost of debt. To better understand these e§ects, we decompose the promised
6:182:14355:18:19:68:547:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:interest rate into expected default risk premium and true cost of debt, and examine how hedging a§ects
6:183:14457:19:18:68:547:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the true cost of debt. We Önd that hedging helps lower the true cost of debt, and the e§ect of hedging
6:184:14559:18:19:68:499:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is stronger in Örms that are near distress or that are more likely to engage in risk shifting.
6:185:14653:19:18:85:547:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We then turn our attention to the real-side implications of hedging. We do this by looking at
6:186:14746:18:18:68:547:513:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the covenants associated with loan contracts, in particular those explicitly constraining investment.
6:187:14847:18:19:68:547:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We Önd that hedging signiÖcantly reduces the likelihood of capital expenditure restrictions in loan
6:188:14946:19:18:68:547:476:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:agreements. SpeciÖcally, our tests suggest that the average IR/FX hedger is 20% less likely to have
6:189:15045:18:19:68:547:458:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:clauses restricting capital expenditures in its future credit agreements. Similarly, and also in line with
6:190:15151:19:18:68:547:439:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:our previous Öndings on the cost of borrowing, we Önd that hedging alters the link between measures
6:191:15250:18:19:68:452:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of Örm risk (e.g., Z-scores) and the likelihood of capital expenditure restrictions.
6:192:15334:19:18:85:547:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:To gain further insight on the hedgingñinvestment relation, we also examine the direct impact of
6:193:15430:18:18:68:547:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:hedging on capital spending. Relative to a non-hedger counterfactual, we Önd that the average IR/FX
6:194:15529:18:19:68:547:366:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:hedger is able to increase investment spending by about 13% of the sample mean level of investment.
6:195:15628:19:18:68:547:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We also examine how heterogeneity in Örm Önancial conditions shapes the relation between hedging
6:196:15724:18:19:68:547:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and investment. We Önd, for example, that hedging ameliorates the strong, negative relation between
6:197:15823:19:18:68:247:310:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Önancial distress risk and investment.
6:198:15861:18:19:85:547:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Our paper contributes to various literatures. Our primary contribution to the hedging literature
6:199:15957:19:18:68:547:273:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is to show that hedging has aÖrst-ordere§ect on Örm Önancing and investment. To our knowledge,
6:200:16051:18:18:68:547:255:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:we are the Örst to simultaneously investigate the impact of hedging on the cost of debt, the likelihood
6:201:16154:18:19:68:547:237:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of capital expenditure restrictions, and investment. We show two precise mechanisms ó cost of debt
6:202:16252:19:18:68:547:218:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Önancing and investment restrictions ó through which hedging a§ects corporate outcomes. Impor-
6:203:16346:18:19:68:547:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tantly, our Öndings on the negative relation between hedging and loan spreads provide new insights
6:204:16444:19:18:68:546:181:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:intohowhedging a§ects corporate wealth. Unlike other papers, we focus on creditorsíevaluation of
6:205:16540:18:19:68:547:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:corporate hedging ó prior studies examine hedging from shareholdersíperspective. In this regard,
6:206:16636:19:18:68:547:144:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:our paper adds to the loan literature by showing that corporate hedging is an important determinant
6:207:16735:18:18:68:547:126:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of loan contract terms. Finally, by explicitly connecting hedging and investment spending, our study
6:208:16835:18:19:68:547:108:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:adds to a new line of research on the real implications of Önancial contracting (e.g., Almeida et al.
6:209:16936:19:0:68:547:89:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(2009)). This line of inquiry is likely to o§er important insights about the role of Önancial contracting
7:210:17042:0:19:68:335:716:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the economy for policymakers and future researchers.
7:211:17097:19:18:85:547:697:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section describes the sample selection

7:213:17296:19:18:68:547:660:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:interplay between hedging, loan spreads, and Örm investment. Section 5 presents robustness checks.

7:217:17561:26:18:68:547:557:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:To gauge the impact of hedging on Örmsíaccess to credit, we need detailed information on contract
7:218:17658:18:18:68:547:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:terms. Importantly, the Önancing instruments examined need to be economically relevant and widely
7:219:17755:18:19:68:547:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:used by Örms. Private loan agreements have become the most important mode of external Önancing
7:220:17849:19:18:68:547:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:by Örms in the last two decades and Örms report detailed information on the terms governing these
7:221:17946:18:19:68:547:484:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:agreements. We begin our sampling with the dataset used in Nini et al. (2009) (hereafter referred to
7:222:18046:19:18:68:547:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:as the NSS sample), which contains information on various dimensions of loan agreements between
7:223:18141:18:19:68:547:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Önancial institutions and Örms.7The NSS sample contains unique information on investment restric-
7:224:18238:19:18:68:547:428:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tions in loan covenants. This information enables us to examine whether hedging improves corporate
7:225:18336:18:18:68:547:410:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:investment by relaxing capital investment restrictions ó evidence hitherto not reported in the litera-
7:226:18438:18:19:68:547:392:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ture. Notably, a sizeable window of the NSS sample coincides with a period in which rules governing
7:227:18537:19:18:68:547:373:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the disclosure of derivatives usage allow for more precise measurement of hedging activities by Örms.
7:228:18638:18:19:85:547:355:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:For each loan contract in the NSS sample, we collect the borrowerís hedging information from the
7:229:18734:19:18:68:547:336:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:10-K Öled in the previous year. This lag is meant to ensure that hedging information can be assumed
7:230:18833:18:19:68:547:318:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to be pre-determined. Our sample starts in 1996, the Örst year in the NSS dataset, and ends in 2002,
7:231:18933:19:18:68:547:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:when FASB SFAS 133 became e§ective. SFAS 133 requires Örms to disclose the ìfair market valuesîof

7:241:19727:11:15:80:546:105:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:8SFAS 119 requires Örms to disclose detailed derivatives information including the notional values, purpose, nature,
7:242:19843:15:0:68:490:90:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:and terms of their derivatives contracts. Some of this information is no longer required under SFAS 133.
8:243:19948:0:19:68:547:716:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the following keywords to locate information used in our data coding: "derivative", "hedg", "Önan-
8:244:20046:19:18:68:547:697:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cial instrument", "swap", "market risk", "expos", "futures", "forward contract", "forward exchange",
8:245:20146:18:19:68:547:679:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:"option contract", "risk management", and "notional". When a keyword is found, we read the sur-
8:246:20241:19:18:68:547:660:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rounding text and hand-code the hedging variables. As in prior derivatives studies (e.g., Allayannis
8:247:20341:18:18:68:547:642:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and Weston (2001) and Graham and Rogers (2002)), we focus on the use of interest rate (IR) and
8:248:20435:18:19:68:547:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:foreign exchange (FX) derivatives for non-trading purposes. If a Örm-yearís 10-K has no reference of

8:250:20633:18:19:68:547:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:use derivatives, we treat that Örm-year as non-user. We record a Örmís notional value of derivatives
8:251:20733:19:18:68:485:568:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:contracts as well as the information on a Örmís long and short positions in derivatives.9
8:252:20822:18:19:85:547:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:One must recognize that a Örm might not use derivatives because it has no relevant IR or FX
8:253:20913:19:18:68:547:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:exposure. To better understand the use of derivatives, we need to check whether the Örm-years we
8:254:21009:18:18:68:547:513:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:classify as non-users are ex-ante exposed to áuctuations in IR and FX prices, or are otherwise taking
8:255:21110:18:19:68:547:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:speculative positions. We determine whether Örms in our sample are ex-ante exposed to those market
8:256:21208:19:18:68:547:476:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:prices in two ways. First, we include keywords "expos" and "market risk" in our program search and
8:257:21306:18:19:68:547:458:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:we make a note if a Örm explicitly states that it has IR and/or FX exposures when we read its 10-K
8:258:21404:19:18:68:547:439:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Öling. Second, we follow the procedure laid out in Graham and Rogers (2002, p.824) for identifying
8:259:21502:18:19:68:547:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ex-ante IR and FX exposures. We infer that a Örm has no ex-ante exposure if it meets the following
8:260:21600:19:18:68:547:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:three conditions: (1) it does not use any IR or FX derivatives; (2) it does not state in its 10-K that
8:261:21702:18:18:68:547:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:it has ex-ante IR or FX exposures; and (3) the Graham and Rogersíprocedure implies that the Örm
8:262:21797:18:19:68:547:366:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:has no ex-ante exposures. A total of 73 Örms fall into this category. We exclude these Örms from the
8:263:21897:19:18:68:547:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:non-user category because they are not suitable counterfactuals to those Örms that are exposed to IR
8:264:21997:18:19:68:321:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and FX prices and use hedging for risk management.
8:265:22047:19:18:85:547:310:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, we match the sample of loan contracts with LPCís DealScan. This allows us to obtain
8:266:22139:18:19:68:547:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:additional characteristics on loan contracts (such as loan size and maturity). We then gather ad-
8:267:22236:19:18:68:547:273:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ditional Örm characteristics from COMPUSTAT. These include, among others, information on Örm
8:268:22328:18:18:68:547:255:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:size, proÖtability, credit ratings, market valuation, asset tangibility, and cash áow volatility. Our Önal
8:269:22434:18:29:68:449:237:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sample contains a total of 2,718 loan contracts signed by 1,185 individual Örms.

8:271:22547:26:18:68:547:182:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The majority of papers using derivatives data (e.g., GÈczy et al.  (1997), Allayannis and Weston
8:272:22643:18:19:68:547:164:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(2001), and Purnanandam (2008))) measure hedging activity with a hedging dummy and/or a con-

8:274:22842:18:17:68:547:127:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We follow this general approach and use multiple proxies for corporate hedging: (1) a dummy variable
8:275:22942:17:14:80:546:110:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:9We use the deÖnitions of long and short positions proposed by Graham and Rogers (2002). SpeciÖcally, a long (short)
8:276:23058:14:11:68:547:96:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:position is a contract that beneÖts from rising (declining) interest rates or the appreciation (depreciation) of a foreign
8:277:23180:11:0:68:547:85:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:currency. Net position is missing when information is insu¢ cient for us to judge if a derivatives position is long or short.

9:284:23836:19:18:85:547:605:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Panel A of Table I shows the summary statistics for our hedging variables. About 35.6% and
9:285:23926:18:19:68:547:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:27.3% of the sample Örm-years use IR and FX derivatives, respectively. Some 50.1% of the sample
9:286:24021:19:18:68:547:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Örm-years use IR and/or FX derivatives. These proportions are somewhat higher than the corre-
9:287:24114:18:19:68:547:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sponding Ögures reported in Graham and Rogers (2002), who examine a random sample of 469 Örms
9:288:24207:19:18:68:547:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(their corresponding Ögures are 25.0%, 24.2%, and 35.7%) for the Öscal year 1995-6. Regarding the
9:289:24304:18:18:68:547:513:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:intensity of derivatives use by our sample Örms, the total notional value of derivatives contracts for
9:290:24406:18:19:68:547:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:derivatives users is about 13.8%, 7.5%, and 14.0% of total assets for IR hedging, FX hedging, and
9:291:24503:19:18:68:547:476:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:IR/FX hedging, respectively.  These Ögures are similar to those reported in Graham and Rogers
9:292:24596:18:30:68:282:458:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(2002), which equal 11.1%, 8.1%, and 13.2%.

9:294:24658:29:19:85:547:399:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Panel A also reports summary statistics on loan characteristics. The average loan size is about
9:295:24753:19:18:68:547:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:291.6 million dollars, the average loan spread (based on DealScanís all-in-spread drawn) is 188.6 basis
9:296:24856:18:18:68:547:362:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:points over LIBOR, and the average loan maturity is 1,345 days (about 45 months). In addition,
9:297:24950:18:19:68:547:344:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:73.1% of loan contracts have contingent performance-based pricing terms and 37.3% of the loans con-
9:298:25049:19:18:68:547:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tain an explicit restriction on capital expenditures. Finally, about 38.1% of the credit facilities in the
9:299:25155:18:19:68:547:307:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sample are term-loans, whereas the remainder can be classiÖed as revolving and other loans. These
9:300:25252:19:18:68:547:288:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:spread and maturity Ögures are higher than those found in related studies such as Chava et al. (2008)
9:301:25353:18:19:68:547:270:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and Ivashina (2009), who report spreads that average around 117 to 140 basis points over LIBOR
9:302:25447:19:18:68:547:251:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and maturity that averages about 39 months.  The panel also reports summary statistics on Örm
9:303:25540:18:18:68:547:233:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:characteristics such as Örm size (the natural log of book value of total assets), asset tangibility (net
9:304:25644:18:19:68:547:215:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:PP&E over total assets), proÖtability (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
9:305:25743:19:18:68:547:196:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:over total assets), cash áow volatility (the standard deviation of quarterly cash áows from operations

9:308:26036:16:15:77:546:143:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:10Graham and Rogers (2002) is the only study using a net notional value (by o§setting long and short positions).
9:309:26148:15:7:68:442:128:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:We experiment with the use of net notional value as a robustness check for our main results.
9:310:26240:7:15:77:546:121:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:11It is useful to brieáy contrast the characteristics of the Örms in our sample with those in the COMPUSTAT universe.
9:311:26357:15:11:68:547:106:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:Standard mean-di§erence tests suggest that our Örms are somewhat larger. At the same time, Örms in our sample and
9:312:26470:11:11:68:547:95:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:those in COMPUSTAT have similar levels of tangibility, market-to-book ratio, and leverage. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests
9:313:26585:11:0:68:533:84:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:suggest that the industry composition (distribution) of our sample is indistinguishable from that of COMPUSTAT.
10:314:26697:0:19:85:547:716:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In Panel B, we compare the characteristics of Örms with and without hedging contracts in place
10:315:26791:19:18:68:547:697:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(hedgers versus non-hedgers). We Önd that hedgers are larger, more leveraged, and exhibit lower cash
10:316:26891:18:19:68:547:679:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:áow and asset volatility, as well as a lower default risk (as measured by Z-score). We also Önd that
10:317:26991:19:18:68:547:660:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:hedgers tend to have higher asset tangibility, although the di§erence is not statistically signiÖcant
10:318:27092:18:18:68:547:642:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:at the 5% test level. These results are largely consistent with the previous Öndings documented in
10:319:27190:18:19:68:547:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the literature (e.g., Nance et al. (1993) and GÈczy et al. (1997)). More importantly, hedgers are
10:320:27287:19:18:68:547:605:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:signiÖcantly di§erent from non-hedgers with respect to loan characteristics and investment spending.
10:321:27387:18:19:68:547:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Hedgers tend to access larger loans at lower loan spreads. Simple mean comparison between hedgers
10:322:27484:19:18:68:547:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and non-hedgers indicates a 31 basis points di§erence in spreads, which is about 15% of the sample
10:323:27582:18:19:68:547:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:average spread for non-hedgers. We also Önd that hedgers, on average, are 20% less likely to have
10:324:27679:19:18:68:547:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:capital expenditures restrictions in their loan agreements, and they tend to invest roughly 10% more
10:325:27779:18:18:68:547:513:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:than non-hedgers.  These univariate results provide preliminary support for our main hypotheses.
10:326:27875:18:35:68:414:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We, however, shall perform more rigorous tests in the following sections.

10:336:28649:21:29:220:547:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:A:Macroeconomic Variables, Idiosyncratic Fixed E§ects)(1)
10:337:28704:29:19:85:547:238:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:As in Graham et al. (2008), we take the natural logarithm of loan spread to mitigate the e§ect of
10:338:28801:19:18:68:547:219:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:skewness in data. Importantly, the model controls for Örm and loan characteristics that may a§ect
10:339:28898:18:19:68:547:201:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:loan spreads. For instance, prior literature has hypothesized that when a borrower has dealt with
10:340:28995:19:18:68:547:182:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the current lender in the past, there are fewer information asymmetries (e.g., Chava and Roberts
10:341:29091:18:19:68:547:164:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(2008)). We include the natural logarithm of (1 + the number of previous loans with the current
10:342:29186:19:18:68:547:145:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:lender) as a proxy for the depth of the relationship between the borrower and lender, expecting it
10:343:29284:18:18:68:547:127:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to be negatively related to loan spreads. In addition, we expect Örms with higher credit ratings to
10:344:29383:18:19:68:547:109:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:obtain more favorable loan terms (e.g., a lower interest rate) than Örms with lower or without ratings.
10:345:29486:19:0:68:547:90:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Accordingly, we include dummies for the borrowerís S&P ratings categories in the model. About 26%
11:346:29584:0:19:68:547:716:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of observations in our sample do not have a credit rating. To avoid loss of data, we assign a dummy
11:347:29683:19:18:68:326:697:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:variable that equals one when credit rating is missing.
11:348:29738:18:19:85:547:679:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Our Örm-level controls include Örm size, proÖtability, asset tangibility, M/B, cash áow volatility,
11:349:29837:19:18:68:546:660:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and leverage.12We also include asset volatility in the model. In the presence of basis (unhedgeable)
11:350:29937:18:18:68:547:642:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:risk, a higher degree of asset volatility typically means less hedging (see Haushalter (2000) and Brown
11:351:30040:18:19:68:547:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and Toft (2002)). To help assure that hedging is not simply capturing this e§ect, one must control
11:352:30138:19:18:68:547:605:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for asset volatility.13We expect a positive link between asset volatility and loan spread. Finally,
11:353:30237:18:19:68:547:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the modiÖed Altmanís (1968) Z-score is included to further control for default risk. A higher Z-score
11:354:30338:19:18:68:547:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:indicates better Önancial health and thus a lower default risk. We compute each of these proxies in
11:355:30437:18:19:68:547:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:standard ways. To save space we describe the details of their calculations in Appendix II. The model
11:356:30537:19:18:68:474:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:controls for industry-Öxed e§ects by including industry dummies (2-digit SIC codes).
11:357:30621:18:18:85:547:513:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Importantly, all Örm variables enter our models with a one-year lag from the loan origination.
11:358:30715:18:19:68:547:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In other words, we work withpre-determinedvalues of those variables. So, for example, whether
11:359:30808:19:18:68:547:476:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the Örm has a hedging policy in place is determined at least one year before the Örm arranges the
11:360:30905:18:19:68:547:458:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:loan contract whose characteristics we consider. Our tests correct the error structure for within-Örm
11:361:31006:19:18:68:468:439:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:correlation (clustering) and heteroskedasticity using the White-Huberís estimator.14
11:362:31090:18:19:85:547:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Following Graham et al. (2008), we also control for loan characteristics that might a§ect spreads.
11:363:31188:19:18:68:547:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We include the natural log of loan size in the model to capture the potential economies of scale in bank
11:364:31292:18:18:68:547:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:lending, which might result in a lower spread. Furthermore, we control for loan maturity (deÖned as
11:365:31391:18:19:68:547:366:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the natural log of maturity in days) because banks often require a liquidity premium for long-term
11:366:31489:19:18:68:547:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:debt and the premium will translate into a higher spread. We also include a dummy variable for
11:367:31583:18:19:68:547:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:performance pricing. We further control for the e§ects of loan type and loan purpose. Loans can be
11:368:31681:19:18:68:547:310:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of di§erent types, such as term loans, revolvers longer than one year, revolvers shorter than one year,
11:369:31784:18:19:68:547:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and 364-day loans. Chava et al. (2008) report that the pricing of term loans can be very di§erent from
11:370:31886:19:18:68:547:273:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that of revolving loans, thus we include dummy variables for each loan type. Likewise, we classify loans
11:371:31990:18:18:68:547:255:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in ìloan purposeîcategories: working capital or general corporate purpose, reÖnancing, acquisition,
11:372:32089:18:19:68:547:237:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:commercial paper backup, and others. For brevity, the coe¢ cients of these dummies are not reported.
11:373:32189:19:18:85:547:218:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Macroeconomic conditions might also a§ect loan pricing Graham et al. (2008). Relatedly, re-
11:374:32280:18:17:68:547:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cent literature (see Faulkender (2005) and Chernenko and Faulkender (2010)) shows that Örms may
11:375:32375:17:15:77:546:183:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:12We include leverage in our speciÖcation to conform to the existing literature (e.g., Graham et al.  (2008) and
11:376:32487:15:11:68:547:168:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:Ivashina (2009)).  While we are concerned about biases that could arise from the inclusion of this variable, we
11:377:32598:11:11:68:547:157:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:alternatively (1) use long lags of industry-level leverage as instruments for lagged Örm-level leverage and (2) drop
11:378:32714:11:7:68:459:146:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:leverage altogether from our speciÖcations. Our inferences are robust to any of these treatments.
11:379:32811:7:14:77:546:139:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:13We compute asset volatility through the estimation of distance-to-default (DTD) using Mertonís (1974) model.
11:380:32921:14:8:68:456:125:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:The details are presented in Apendix II. We thank an anoymous referee for suggesting this idea.
11:381:33016:8:14:77:546:117:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:14We do not include Örm-Öxed e§ects in our baseline estimations (in Table II) because 426 Örms have just one loan
11:382:33129:14:11:68:547:103:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:over the sample period that will be dropped from the Örm-Öxed e§ects estimation.  In our robustness checks with
11:383:33240:11:0:68:325:92:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:Örm-Öxed e§ects (see Table V), our inferences remain the same.
12:384:33303:0:19:68:547:716:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:selectively hedge their interest rate risks and time the use of derivatives based on macroeconomic
12:385:33401:19:18:68:547:697:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:conditions. It is thus possible that Örms may time loans in a way that is correlated with aggregate
12:386:33500:18:19:68:547:679:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:conditions and hedging. To avoid this source of omitted variable bias, we follow this literature and
12:387:33600:19:18:68:547:660:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:include credit spread and term spread as controls in our model. Credit spread is computed as the
12:388:33696:18:18:68:547:642:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:di§erence between the yields of BAA and AAA corporate bonds, and term spread is the di§erence
12:389:33789:18:19:68:547:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:between the yield of 10-year and 1-year Treasury bonds. The literature suggests that term spread
12:390:33885:19:18:68:547:605:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tends to widen in economic expansions and shrink in recessions. In contrast, the credit spread tends
12:391:33985:18:19:68:547:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to widen in recessions and shrink in expansions (see Graham et al.). We thus expect a positive link
12:392:34084:19:18:68:532:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:between credit spread and loan spread and a negative link between term spread and loan spread.
12:393:34178:18:19:85:547:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In addition to the contract ìtiming mismatchî(imposed lag structure) described above, we high-
12:394:34272:19:18:68:547:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:light the ìinstitutional mismatchîbetween providers of hedging and loan contracts. In the U.S., only
12:395:34372:18:18:68:547:513:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a few, large Önancial institutions ó many of which are nonbank Örms ó o§er hedging contracts. In
12:396:34468:18:19:68:547:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:particular, according to 2002 statistics from the Fedís regulatory dataset, the top 5 (10) providers
12:397:34568:19:18:68:547:476:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:concentrated over 85% (95%) of the FX and IR hedging contracts outstanding.  In contrast, the
12:398:34661:18:19:68:547:458:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:loan contracts we examine come from a large spectrum of commercial banks (there are nearly 1,500
12:399:34757:19:18:68:547:439:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:di§erent banks in our sample).  Very rarely the same Önancial institution would provide the two
12:400:34852:18:19:68:547:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:contracts examined in our tests. Indeed, we spot-checked the 10-Ks of a random sample of Örms in
12:401:34948:19:18:68:547:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:2002 and found no match between the providers of hedging and loan contracts. We also veriÖed that
12:402:35045:18:18:68:547:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the largest 10 derivative providers lead only about 4% of the loans in our sample, and that our results
12:403:35148:18:30:68:314:366:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are insensitive to the deletion of these observations.

12:405:35236:25:19:68:547:311:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Although we have taken precautions to address the issue of biases arising from reverse-causality and
12:406:35336:19:18:68:547:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:omitted variables, endogeneity remains as a concern in our estimations. In this section, we develop
12:407:35435:18:18:68:518:274:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:an instrumental variable approach to more explicitly handle concerns about estimation biases.
12:408:35528:18:19:85:547:256:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We identify a candidate instrument for hedging that arises from a salient feature of the rules gov-
12:409:35627:19:18:68:547:237:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:erning corporate taxes; namely, tax convexity. The risk management literature has long argued that
12:410:35725:18:19:68:547:219:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:hedging can lower the volatility of future taxable income, thus lowering expected tax liabilities for
12:411:35826:19:18:68:547:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Örms facing convex tax schedules (e.g., Smith and Stulz (1985) and Graham and Smith (1999)). Green
12:412:35924:18:19:68:547:182:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and Talmor (1985), for example, show that in the presence of asymmetric tax treatment of positive
12:413:36021:19:18:68:547:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and negative incomes, the tax liability of a Örm can be thought of as a government-written call option
12:414:36123:18:18:68:547:145:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on future income streams, with the strike price equal to the value of allowable deductions on taxable
12:415:36224:18:19:68:547:127:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:earnings. Accordingly, as the volatility of pre-tax earnings declines, the value of the call option ó the
12:416:36329:19:18:68:547:108:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:amount of the tax liabilities ó drops. This gives Örms an incentive to hedge. Graham and Smith fur-
12:417:36428:18:0:68:547:90:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ther report that roughly 50% of the Örms in COMPUSTAT face e§ective tax functions that are convex.
13:418:36528:0:19:85:547:716:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In the U.S., tax convexity is a function of the non-linear treatment assigned to corporate earnings
13:419:36627:19:18:68:546:697:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:in the tax code (tax brackets), the existence of net operating loss carryforwards and carrybacks,15
13:420:36726:18:19:68:547:679:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:investment tax credits, and the alternative minimum tax. The tax convexity estimation of Graham
13:421:36821:19:18:68:547:660:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and Smith (1999) captures all of the aforementioned features of the tax code and measures the ex-
13:422:36918:18:18:68:547:642:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:pected tax savings from hedging. Notably, not all Örms face the same tax convexities, nor would they
13:423:37018:18:19:68:547:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:beneÖt the same by hedging their income for tax reasons. Our instrumental approach builds on this

13:438:38312:18:19:68:546:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:comes from thenon-linear formof the income taxation function, rather than the income level itself
13:439:38409:19:18:68:542:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(which is already included in Eq. (1)). Indeed,Convexityis a highly non-linear function of income.
13:440:38507:18:19:85:547:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:For our purposes, the key observation is that tax convexity provides incentives for Örms to hedge
13:441:38604:19:18:68:547:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(instrument inclusion restriction), but a priori, there is no reason to expect it to directly a§ect the
13:442:38707:18:18:68:547:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:terms of bank loans (exclusion restriction). Under this premise, tax convexity is a plausible instrument
13:443:38811:18:19:68:547:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for hedging in a loan spread regression. Indeed, using the Graham-Smith tax-convexity construct,
13:444:38907:19:18:68:547:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:prior papers have found support for the hypothesis that Örms hedge with the goal of minimizing
13:445:39001:18:19:68:547:192:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:taxes (e.g., Dionne and Garand (2003), Dionne and Triki (2005), and Lin et al. (2008)). Others,
13:446:39096:19:18:68:547:173:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:however, Önd only weak evidence of this e§ect (e.g., Graham and Rogers (2002)). Accordingly, we
13:447:39191:18:19:68:547:155:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:need to verify that our approach is robust to alternative assumptions about what is included in the
13:448:39290:19:18:68:547:136:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:instrument set. This set must also have good statistical properties (pass validity and relevance tests).
13:449:39394:18:16:68:546:118:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:The various tests reported below focus on demonstrating that our instrumental approach is sound.16
13:450:39492:16:15:77:546:102:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:15Carryforwards and carrybacks tend to reduce the most extreme tax schedule curvatures, but they spread the
13:451:39599:15:7:68:329:87:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:progressivity of taxes over a broader range of corporate incomes.
13:452:39664:7:0:77:546:80:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:16For example, one potential concern with our instrument is that it is simply a proxy for asset or cash áow volatility.
14:453:39785:0:19:85:547:716:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Our instrumental variable estimations are performed in two stages. In the Örst stage, hedging
14:454:39878:19:18:68:546:697:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:intensity is regressed on the lagged excluded instrument (Convexity) and all of the independent vari-
14:455:39979:18:19:68:547:679:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ables in the loan spread model (Eq. (1)). The ìpredicted hedgingîfrom the Örst stage is then used
14:456:40076:19:18:68:547:660:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the second-stage loan spread model. The Örst-stage regression results are not reported in full to
14:457:40176:18:18:68:547:642:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:save space; instead, the relevant test statistics are reported in all of our tables. In all cases, the tax
14:458:40282:18:19:68:547:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:convexity variable is found to have a positive and statistically signiÖcant e§ect on hedging. Accord-
14:459:40383:19:18:68:546:605:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ingly, as reported, theF-tests of the signiÖcance of the instrument in the Örst-stage model are always
14:460:40485:18:19:68:547:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:highly signiÖcant (p-values lower than 0.001). More illustrative than these exclusionF-tests, however,
14:461:40587:19:18:68:546:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are the Sheaís (1997)R2ís from the Örst-stage regressions (also reported in all tables). TheseR2ís
14:462:40685:18:19:68:547:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:all exceed the suggested (ìrule of thumbî) hurdle of 10%. These various statistics suggest that our
14:463:40784:19:29:68:539:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:instrument is relevant in explaining the variation of our modelsípotentially endogenous regressors.

14:466:40930:26:18:68:547:456:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:To gauge the direct e§ect of hedging on loan spreads, we study, separately, an IR hedging dummy
14:467:41025:18:19:68:547:438:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for whether the Örm has IR derivatives contracts in place; a continuous IR intensity hedging measure
14:468:41125:19:18:68:547:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(i.e., total notional value of IR derivatives contracts scaled by the Örmís total assets); a FX hedging
14:469:41228:18:19:68:547:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:dummy; a continuous FX hedging intensity measure (total notional value of FX derivatives scaled
14:470:41323:19:18:68:547:382:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:by total assets); an IR/FX hedging dummy combining the IR and FX dummies; and a continuous
14:471:41413:18:18:68:547:364:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:IR/FX intensity measure (total notional value of IR and FX derivatives scaled by total assets). Our
14:472:41512:18:19:68:547:346:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:inferences are similar for each one of these hedging proxies. To avoid redundancy, however, we only
14:473:41611:19:18:68:394:327:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:discuss the results based on the IR/FX hedging intensity measure.17
14:474:41678:18:19:85:547:309:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Table II presents the results from estimating Eq. (1). Column (1) reports the coe¢ cients ob-
14:475:41771:19:18:68:547:290:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tained from a standard OLS model. The sample size drops slightly due to missing values on hedging
14:476:41868:18:19:68:547:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:intensity. Column (2) reports estimates obtained from the IV approach. The results are qualitatively
14:477:41968:19:18:68:547:253:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:similar, and we focus on the latter approach to save space. The estimates in column (2) deliver a very
14:478:42070:18:18:68:547:235:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:signiÖcant result. They imply that hedgers with average usage of IR/FX derivatives are charged loan
14:479:42169:18:19:68:547:217:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:spreads that are 28% lower than non-hedgers (=-2:021-0:140, where 0.140 is the mean of IR/FX
14:480:42261:19:18:68:547:198:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:hedging-to-asset ratio reported in Table I). Relative to the average loan spread of 189 basis points,
14:481:42362:18:19:68:547:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:this represents a reduction of about 53 basis points. To present these e§ects in an alternative way,
14:482:42462:19:18:68:547:161:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a one-standard deviation increase in hedging intensity at the average level of hedging leads to a 29%
14:483:42563:18:20:68:456:143:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:reduction in spreads. Hedging has a strong, sizeable impact on the cost of credit.
14:484:42645:20:11:68:547:123:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:To ameliorate this concern, we expunge from the calculation ofConvexitythose ìsuspiciousîcomponents proxying for
14:485:42757:11:11:68:547:112:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:volatility (e.g.,T IV ol). The results (available from the authors) are consistent with our the results presented below,
14:486:42877:11:7:68:461:101:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:suggesting again that we do obtain independent variation coming from the tax-based instrument.
14:487:42971:7:0:77:480:94:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:17Key results based on IR/FX hedging dummy can be found in the Internet Appendix of the paper.
15:488:43067:0:19:85:547:716:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Regarding the control variables, each of the Örm characteristics we use attracts the expected coef-
15:489:43166:19:18:68:547:697:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Öcient. For example, Örms that have more established relations with their banks, are larger, are more
15:490:43267:18:19:68:547:679:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:proÖtable, have more tangible assets, are less leveraged, and have higher Z-scores all pay lower loan
15:491:43368:19:18:68:547:660:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:spreads for the funds received under private agreements. These results resemble those of Graham
15:492:43463:18:18:68:547:642:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:et al. (2008). Like those authors, we also obtain a negative relation between market-to-book ratios
15:493:43562:18:19:68:547:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and loan spreads. Loan characteristics such as loan size and maturity also conform to our priors.
15:494:43659:19:18:68:547:605:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The results for the macro variables, too, agree with our priors. Recall, our regressions, also include
15:495:43761:18:19:68:547:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a performance pricing dummy, loan type and purpose dummies, and credit ratings dummies; their
15:496:43854:19:18:68:345:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:coe¢ cients are largely signiÖcant, but omitted for brevity.
15:497:43914:18:19:85:547:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:To our knowledge, this is the Örst study in the literature to show that corporate hedging is as-
15:498:44010:19:18:68:547:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sociated with lower loan interest rates. These initial results complement and extend the Önding of
15:499:44108:18:18:68:547:513:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Graham and Rogers (2002) that hedging increases a Örmís debt capacity. Both studies are consistent
15:500:44206:18:19:68:547:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with the notion that creditors value positively a Örmís decision to hedge, and they provide more
15:501:44302:19:18:68:547:476:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:favorable credit terms to Örms that hedge. Our results on the e§ect of hedging on loan pricing are
15:502:44400:18:19:68:547:458:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:also consistent with Petersen and Thiagarajanís (2000) Öndings on the moderating e§ect of hedging
15:503:44497:19:18:68:547:439:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on the cost of equity. Together with these pieces of evidence, our results more broadly imply that
15:504:44595:18:30:68:300:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:hedging eases Örmsíaccess to external Önancing.

15:507:44700:26:18:68:547:337:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:To better characterize our story, we examine in more detail factors underlying the negative associa-
15:508:44800:18:19:68:547:319:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tion between hedging and loan spreads that we have uncovered. Smith and Stulz (1985) argue that if
15:509:44898:19:18:68:547:300:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Önancial distress is costly, hedging can ease external funding by lowering income volatility. According
15:510:45001:18:19:68:547:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to their theory, hedging may be particularly more valuable for Örms with a higher probability of
15:511:45097:19:18:68:547:263:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Önancial distress. In contrast, the beneÖts of hedging for Önancially strong borrowers may be more
15:512:45195:18:18:68:547:245:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:marginal. In what follows, we explore cross-sectional variation in ÖrmsíÖnancial positions to verify
15:513:45295:18:19:68:461:227:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:whether our baseline results can indeed be attributed to existing hedging theories.
15:514:45378:19:18:85:547:208:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We examine the Önancial distress argument by including Altmanís Z-score and its interaction
15:515:45469:18:19:68:547:190:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with hedging in our baseline model. The result from this test is reported in column (3) of Table II.
15:516:45569:19:18:68:547:171:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We expect the uninteracted Z-score to have a negative impact on loan spreads since, all else equal,
15:517:45668:18:19:68:547:153:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:healthier Örms should be charged lower spreads. This is exactly what we Önd, with a high degree of
15:518:45766:19:18:68:547:134:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:statistical signiÖcance. More interesting, however, is the coe¢ cient of the hedgingñZ-score interaction
15:519:45870:18:18:68:547:116:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:term. This term returns a positive, statistically signiÖcant coe¢ cient, implying a weakening of the
15:520:45970:18:19:68:547:98:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:negative association between Z-score and loan spreads for Örms that hedge. Put di§erently, consis-
15:521:46068:19:0:68:547:79:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tent with the theory, hedging is particularly more valuable for borrowers with a higher likelihood of
16:522:46171:0:19:68:547:716:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Önancial distress. It is interesting to gauge the economic signiÖcance of our results. The estimates
16:523:46271:19:18:68:547:697:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in column (3) imply that a one-standard deviation decline in Z-score increases the loan spread of an
16:524:46371:18:19:68:492:679:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:average hedger by 16 basis pointslessthan a similar decline in Z-score for a non-hedger.
16:525:46459:19:18:85:547:660:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In addition to ameliorating Önancial distress risk, theory suggests that hedging may be beneÖcial
16:526:46556:18:18:68:547:642:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for creditors by limiting Örmsíscope for substitution towards riskier investments (risk-shifting). It
16:527:46657:18:19:68:547:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is thus interesting to examine if the dynamics of our hedgingñloan spreads results are modulated by
16:528:46756:19:18:68:547:605:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the degree to which Örms might be able to engage in asset substitution. While it is di¢ cult to gauge
16:529:46857:18:19:68:547:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:directly a Örmís ability to risk-shift, standard Önance theory suggests that Örms with more growth
16:530:46955:19:18:68:547:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:opportunities tend to be riskier than Örms with fewer growth opportunities (see, e.g., Jensen and
16:531:47052:18:19:68:547:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Meckling (1976)). Under this conjecture, we would expect that the e§ect of hedging in lowering loan
16:532:47151:19:18:68:547:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:spreads to be greater for Örms with more growth opportunities. To test this idea, we interact M/B
16:533:47248:18:18:68:547:513:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with hedging in the loan spread model. The results are reported in column (4) of Table II. Our tests
16:534:47348:18:19:68:547:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:show that the coe¢ cients of the hedgingñM/B interaction term are always negative and statistically
16:535:47447:19:18:68:547:476:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:signiÖcant. Accordingly, the estimates we report suggest that the negative e§ect of hedging on loan
16:536:47546:18:19:68:547:458:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:spreads is greater ó i.e., hedging is more valuable ó for Örms whose investment opportunity set
16:537:47641:19:18:68:547:439:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is more likely to allow for risk-shifting. Another way to interpret the coe¢ cients in the table is to
16:538:47743:18:19:68:547:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:recognize the beneÖts of hedging through the e§ect it has on the cost of funds of growth Örms. Using

16:543:48127:29:18:68:547:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:One way in which the beneÖts of hedging may manifest relates to the contractual restrictions creditors
16:544:48229:18:19:68:547:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:impose on Örms that hedge. In particular, together with lower interest rates, it is likely that creditors
16:545:48334:19:18:68:547:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:will impose fewer contractual restrictions on Örmsíspending when ìhedging insuranceîis in place (see
16:546:48434:18:19:68:547:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Bessembinder (1991)). Naturally, the relevant question is whether hedging ultimately shapes the Örmís
16:547:48535:19:18:68:547:228:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:investment process. These important questions on the real-side implications of Önancial decisions have
16:548:48637:18:29:68:514:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:been largely ignored in the hedging literature. This section examines both of these questions.

16:550:48764:26:18:68:547:155:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We Örst examine whether hedging has a direct impact on investment restrictions in loan agreements.
16:551:48862:18:19:68:547:137:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Research suggests that investment restriction clauses in bank loans are particularly interesting because
16:552:48966:19:18:68:547:118:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:these clauses are tailored according to the particular characteristics of each borrower, di§erently from
16:553:49070:18:19:68:547:100:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the ìgenerally-wordedîindentures of public bonds. Accordingly, the choice of including capital expen-

17:556:49284:19:18:85:547:697:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We examine this hypothesis by regressing a dummy variable denoting the existence of capital

17:558:49475:19:18:68:547:660:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:istics. The controls used in these estimations are similar to those in Eq. (1). All models are estimated

17:561:49613:25:19:85:547:599:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Our results are reported in Table III. To ease the exposition, the coe¢ cient estimates are trans-
17:562:49711:19:18:68:547:580:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:formed to represent the marginal e§ects evaluated at the means of the independent variables from the

17:564:49914:19:18:68:547:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to those observed in the loan spreads of Table II (the same economic intuition applies, which we omit
17:565:50015:18:18:68:126:525:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for brevity).
17:566:50028:18:19:85:547:507:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:More important for our purposes are the coe¢ cients associated with hedging. The estimates show
17:567:50123:19:18:68:547:488:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a negative, statistically signiÖcant relation between hedging and the odds of having capital expen-
17:568:50222:18:19:68:547:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:diture restrictions in loan agreements.  SpeciÖcally, results from column (1), imply that being an
17:569:50320:19:18:68:547:451:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:average IR/FX hedger decreases the probability of having an expenditure restriction by about 20%.
17:570:50417:18:19:68:547:433:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:This number is quite signiÖcant. Relative to the sample mean, it represents a 54% decline in the odds
17:571:50518:19:18:68:272:414:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of having a capital expenditure restriction.
17:572:50562:18:18:85:547:396:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The evidence in Table III suggests a new channel through which hedging improves corporate
17:573:50651:18:19:68:547:378:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:outcomes: it reduces the odds that creditors will impose constraints on Örmsíinvestment decisions.
17:574:50749:19:18:68:547:359:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We believe our evidence is important in áashing out precise mechanisms that underlie links between
17:575:50847:18:19:68:547:341:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Önancial and investment decisions inside the Örm. While there is evidence that these decisions move
17:576:50946:19:18:68:546:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:together (see Stein (2003) for a review), we still know very little abouthowthey are connected. The
17:577:51045:18:19:68:451:304:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:evidence introduced by this paper helps us better understand these connections.
17:578:51124:19:18:85:547:285:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, we have shown that Önancial distress and risk-shifting proxies modulate the e§ect of
17:579:51217:18:19:68:547:267:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:hedging on the cost of external funding. The same rationale used in the tests of Section C.2 applies
17:580:51317:19:18:68:547:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:when examining the impact of hedging on the investment covenants: higher Önancial distress risk and
17:581:51416:18:18:68:547:230:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:higher potential for asset substitution should make hedging particularly more desirable for creditors,
17:582:51518:18:19:68:473:212:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:leading to a relaxation on investment covenants. We verify these hypotheses in turn.
17:583:51602:19:18:85:547:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We augment the capital restriction covenants of column (1) with the inclusion of an interaction
17:584:51697:18:19:68:547:175:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:term for hedging and Z-score (similar to the approach of Table II). The results are reported in column
17:585:51799:19:18:68:547:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(2). The estimates show that Örms with a higher chance of Önancial distress (as denoted by a low Z-
17:586:51898:18:19:68:547:138:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:score) are more likely to be imposed capital expenditure restrictions. At the same time, given an hypo-
17:587:52001:19:18:68:547:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:thetical one-standard deviation drop in Z-score, a non-hedger will see a 15.5% increase in the likelihood
17:588:52106:18:18:68:547:101:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that its lender will impose a capital expenditure restriction, while for a counterfactual hedger Örm the
17:589:52210:18:0:68:547:83:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:increase in the likelihood of a restriction is only one third of that, or a statistically insigniÖcant 5.2%.
18:590:52320:0:19:85:550:716:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In column (3) we interact M/B with hedging intensity. The coe¢ cient returned for the hedgingñ
18:591:52414:19:18:68:547:697:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:M/B interaction term is negative and statistically signiÖcant. The estimation suggests that growth
18:592:52512:18:29:68:495:679:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Örms that hedge have lower odds of having capital expenditure restrictions in their loans.

18:594:52647:26:18:68:547:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Our Öndings suggest that hedging reduces the incidence of investment restrictions in loan agreements.
18:595:52748:18:19:68:547:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:This should give Örms greater áexibility in their investment decisions. Since we also Önd that hedgers
18:596:52850:19:18:68:547:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:raise funds at lower costs, it would be natural to investigate whether Önancial hedging programs
18:597:52946:18:18:68:547:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ultimately shape Örmsí investment spending (see also Petersen and Thiagarajan (2000)).  In this
18:598:53041:18:19:68:547:551:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:section, we estimate empirical investment models in which a Örmís asset-scaled capital expenditures
18:599:53140:19:18:68:547:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are regressed on a large set of variables containing information on Örm and loan characteristics, as
18:600:53240:18:19:68:547:514:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:well as on hedging. This set of variables, which come from Eq. (1), encompasses those commonly
18:601:53334:19:18:68:477:495:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:found in the corporate investment literature (see, e.g., Kaplan and Zingales (1997)).18
18:602:53421:18:19:85:547:477:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The results from the IV estimations of our investment model are in Table IV. All of our estimations
18:603:53520:19:18:68:547:458:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:return a positive, statistically signiÖcant coe¢ cient for hedging, suggesting that hedgers are able to
18:604:53623:18:18:68:547:440:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:invest more than non-hedgers. The results under column (1), for example, suggest that being an av-

18:606:53818:19:18:68:547:403:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:level of annual investment (= 0:071-0:14=0:077). Other regressors in the model obtain expected
18:607:53912:18:19:68:547:385:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:coe¢ cients. For example, investment is positively related to greater access to loans (as indicated by
18:608:54014:19:18:68:547:366:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:having prior relations with the current lender, larger loan size, and longer loan maturity) and higher
18:609:54116:18:28:68:406:348:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Z-scores. Investment also responds positively to M/B and proÖtability.

18:611:54205:29:18:85:547:291:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We also interact hedging with Z-score and M/B. We do so because we expect the impact of hedg-

18:613:54395:19:18:68:547:254:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:investment choice sets. Results under column (2) of Table IV show that the coe¢ cient on the inter-
18:614:54494:18:19:68:547:236:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:action term between hedging and Z-score is negative and signiÖcant, implying that hedging relaxes
18:615:54591:19:18:68:547:217:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the link between Z-score and investment. In particular, they imply that low Z-score Örms that hedge
18:616:54690:18:18:68:547:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:invest more than low Z-score Örms that do not hedge. To use a concrete example, consider again a
18:617:54786:18:19:68:547:181:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:one-standard deviation drop in Z-score. For a Örm that does not hedge that decline will lead to a
18:618:54883:19:18:68:547:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:drop in investment of about 9.5% of the average sample investment rate. For an average hedger, the
18:619:54981:18:19:68:547:144:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:same drop in Z-score would imply an equivalent drop in investment of only 4.6% of the sample mean.
18:620:55079:19:18:85:547:125:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Column (3) reports results from a model in which we interact hedging and M/B. The hedgingñM/B

19:624:55434:0:19:68:547:716:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with greater growth options to invest more. For example, increasing M/B by one unit boosts annual
19:625:55531:19:18:68:538:697:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:investment rate by 3% for average hedgers, which is about 39% of the sample mean of investment.
19:626:55626:18:19:85:547:679:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The Öndings of this section complement and extend the existing evidence on Önancing frictions and
19:627:55723:19:18:68:547:660:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:investment. Chava and Roberts (2008) Önd that a borrowerís capital expenditures decline by about
19:628:55819:18:18:68:547:642:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:13% in response to a Önancial covenant violation. Nini et al. (2009) further document that capital
19:629:55917:18:19:68:547:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:expenditure restrictions are common, and borrowing Örmsíinvestment rate fall by 15% (relative to the
19:630:56017:19:18:68:547:605:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sample mean) after an investment restriction is imposed on their loans. In contrast, we Önd that being
19:631:56119:18:19:68:547:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:an average IR/FX hedger reduces the chance of having a capital expenditure restriction by about
19:632:56214:19:18:68:547:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:20%, and that engaging in hedging activities increases a Örmís annual investment rate by about 13%
19:633:56312:18:19:68:547:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(relative to sample mean). Further analyses that we conduct considering Önancial distress risk and
19:634:56410:19:34:68:547:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:growth opportunities provide additional insights about the impact of hedging on investment spending.

19:636:56531:29:19:68:547:468:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In this section, we test the robustness of our inferences to the use of alternative hedging measures and
19:637:56635:19:18:68:547:449:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimation methods. We do so perturbing the estimation that produces our weakest results (under col-
19:638:56735:18:18:68:546:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:umn (1) of Table II). First, Graham and Rogers (2002) argue that thenetnotional value of derivatives
19:639:56835:18:19:68:547:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:might be a better measure of a Örmís hedging position than thetotalnotional value. As a robustness
19:640:56933:19:18:68:547:394:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:check, in column (1) of Table V we measure the extent of hedging as the net notional value of deriv-
19:641:57033:18:19:68:547:376:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:atives contracts scaled by total assets. As some Örms are vague in reporting the direction of hedging
19:642:57134:19:18:68:547:357:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:positions in their SEC Ölings, we follow Graham and Rogers and exclude these ìunsure casesîfrom
19:643:57229:18:19:68:547:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the analysis.  Still, the estimated hedging ìpremiumî (reduction in loan spreads) associated with
19:644:57326:19:18:68:547:320:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a one-standard deviation increase in hedging remains economically signiÖcant, equal to 23%. The
19:645:57421:18:29:68:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:conclusion that hedging lowers loan spread is robust to the use of net notional value of derivatives.

19:647:57540:30:18:85:547:243:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Second, we experiment with proxies for the likelihood of future default in our baseline model.
19:648:57634:18:19:68:547:225:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Recent research has proposed the use of ìdistance-to-defaultî (DTD) as a plausible candidate. In
19:649:57730:19:18:68:547:206:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the bank loan literature, Drucker and Puri (2009) use this measure to assess whether a borrower may
19:650:57829:18:19:68:547:188:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:default in the future, which a§ects the expected length of the relationship with its lender. Follow-
19:651:57929:19:18:68:547:169:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ing Drucker and Puri, we implement the DTD measure that is operationalized in Crosbie and Bohn
19:652:58023:18:18:68:547:151:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(2003). In column (2) of Table V, we use this proxy in lieu of Z-score. The DTD proxy attracts the
19:653:58121:18:19:68:547:133:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:expected negative coe¢ cient, but this brings no signiÖcant changes to the coe¢ cient of the IR/FX
19:654:58219:19:18:68:547:114:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:hedging-to-asset variable. Although not reported in the table, we reestimate all our hedgingñZ-score
19:655:58319:18:19:68:547:96:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:interactive models replacing Z-score with DTD. Our conclusions about the interplay between distress
19:656:58418:19:0:68:212:77:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and hedging remain the same.
20:657:58448:0:19:85:547:716:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:About 60% of our sample Örms have more than one loan in the 1996ñ2002 period. We exploit the
20:658:58540:19:18:68:547:697:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:panel data structure of part of our sample to check whether our results are robust to the inclusion
20:659:58639:18:19:68:547:679:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of controls for time-invariant Örm characteristics. In column (3) of Table V, we estimate a Örm-Öxed
20:660:58739:19:18:68:547:660:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:e§ects regression. Naturally, the Örms that have just one loan in our sample period are dropped from
20:661:58839:18:18:68:547:642:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the estimation. Yet, the reduced sample provides an opportunity to gauge the tenor of our results.
20:662:58937:18:19:68:529:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We Önd that the IR/FX hedging proxy still attracts a negative and highly signiÖcant coe¢ cient.
20:663:59032:19:18:85:547:605:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:While the statistics reported in Table I suggest little evidence of gross outliers in loan spreads,
20:664:59131:18:19:68:547:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:we estimate a median regression as an additional check. The result on the IR/FX hedging ratio in
20:665:59227:19:18:68:449:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:column (4) of Table V is qualitatively similar to that of our baseline regressions
20:666:59309:18:19:85:547:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, note that our analysis is conducted at the loan level. However, as discussed in Graham et
20:667:59407:19:18:68:547:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:al. (2008), individual loans are often part of a multiple-loan deals, and their terms may simply reáect
20:668:59510:18:18:68:547:513:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the deal-level negotiation (i.e., they are not completely independent observations). Treating these
20:669:59609:18:19:68:547:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:loans as independent credit facilities could ináate the statistical signiÖcance of our results. To check
20:670:59713:19:18:68:547:476:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:whether this is an issue, we follow Graham et al. and aggregate loans into ìdealsî using loan-size
20:671:59811:18:19:68:547:458:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:weighted averages of the relevant loan terms. The slope estimate for the IR/FX hedging variable in
20:672:59909:19:18:68:483:439:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:column (5) of Table V indicates the deal-level bias story does not a§ect our inferences.
20:673:59997:18:19:85:547:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We also perform robustness checks for our regression models on the probability of having a capital
20:674:60095:19:18:68:547:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:expenditure restriction in a loan contract. These checks (available upon request) indicate that our
20:675:60194:18:18:68:547:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:inferences about investment restrictions are equally robust to changes in model speciÖcation, sample
20:676:60294:18:35:68:336:366:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:selection, and use of alternative econometric techniques.
20:677:60351:35:29:68:402:331:14:g_d0_f4:14:g_d0_f4:C:V  The Economic Value of Corporate Hedging
20:678:60393:29:18:68:547:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Our analysis shows evidence that hedging reduces interest rate spreads and the incidence of invest-
20:679:60492:18:19:68:547:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ment restrictions in loan agreements, which in turn result in higher investment rates. These Öndings
20:680:60592:19:18:68:547:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are consistent with existing evidence on the valuation gains associated with hedging (e.g., Allayannis
20:681:60694:18:19:68:547:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and Weston (2001)). It is therefore natural that we dig deeper into the economic value of corporate
20:682:60793:19:18:68:547:228:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:hedging. In this section, we Örst study the relation between hedging and the true cost of corporate
20:683:60892:18:19:68:547:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:debt; i.e., we go beyond the analysis of loan spreads. We then look at the value implication of in-
20:684:60991:19:18:68:547:191:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:vestment increases that come from hedging. While the tests performed here are more tentative, they
20:685:61089:18:29:68:475:173:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:provide a step forward in our understanding of the economic implications of hedging.

20:687:61207:26:18:68:547:118:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Our tests show that hedging lowers contractual loan spreads. These results are interesting in their
20:688:61306:18:19:68:499:100:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:own right, however, they need not imply that hedging reduces the Örmís true cost of debt.
20:689:61395:19:0:85:547:81:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The Örmís observed debt spread includes a portion compensating investors for the expected default
21:690:61494:0:19:68:547:716:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:loss and a portion compensating investors for the undiversiÖable risk of debt (i.e., the expected return
21:691:61598:19:29:68:537:697:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:premium or ìtrueîcost of debt).19More precisely, the contractual debt yield can be expressed as:
21:692:61694:29:29:110:547:668:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f2:A:Promised Debt Yield=Cost of Debt + Yield Equivalent of Expected Default Loss.(3)
21:693:61774:29:19:68:547:639:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In our case, the observed drop in the loan spread (promised debt yield) for hedgers could be caused
21:694:61873:19:18:68:547:620:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:by a drop in the expected default risk premium, rather than a drop in the (true) cost of debt, as a
21:695:61972:18:19:68:547:602:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:result of hedging. This distinction is important in that only the latter e§ect is a su¢ cient condition
21:696:62075:19:18:68:328:583:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:for hedging to increase Örm value via debt Önancing.20
21:697:62129:18:19:85:547:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In this section, we examine how hedging a§ects the cost of debt. Our analysis builds on recent
21:698:62223:19:18:68:547:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:empirical studies decomposing promised interest rates into expected default risk premia and underly-
21:699:62323:18:18:68:547:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ing debt costs (e.g., Elton et al. (2001) and Cooper and Davydenko (2007)). We leave the details of
21:700:62422:18:19:68:547:510:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the computation of these di§erent components to Appendix I. Here, we are interested in testing the
21:701:62520:19:18:68:387:491:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:empirical relation between the computed cost of debt and hedging.
21:702:62585:18:19:85:547:473:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Table I shows that the mean cost of debt in our sample is132basis points, roughly 70% of the
21:703:62677:19:18:68:547:454:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mean promised loan spread. This relative ratio is very similar to the 66% Ögure reported in Elton et
21:704:62777:18:19:68:546:436:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:al. (2001).21Table VI presents results from regressing the log of true cost of debt on Örm hedging.
21:705:62876:19:18:68:546:417:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The estimated models are similar to Eq.  (1), except that the dependent variable (Cost of Debt)
21:706:62971:18:19:68:547:399:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is computed as Eq. (5) in Appendix I. The results in the table show a negative and statistically
21:707:63067:19:18:68:546:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:signiÖcant relation between hedging intensity andCost of Debt, suggesting that hedging helps lower
21:708:63165:18:18:68:547:362:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:not only the promised loan spreads (as in Table II), but also the true cost of debt. When we include
21:709:63265:18:19:68:547:344:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the interaction between hedging and Z-score or the interaction between M/B ratio and hedging, we
21:710:63361:19:18:68:547:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:obtain results that, again, resemble those of Table II. That is, hedging has a particularly strong e§ect
21:711:63465:18:30:68:528:307:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on the true cost of debt of those Örms that are near distress or that are more likely to risk-shift.

21:714:63657:25:19:68:547:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:A natural and interesting question is whether hedging adds value by boosting a Örmís real-side activi-
21:715:63759:19:18:68:547:204:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ties. In our context, a Örm may beneÖt from the additional investment that is made possible as a result
21:716:63862:18:19:68:547:186:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of hedging. Hedging programs, however, are not cost-free. Bearing in mind the limitations of the data,
21:717:63964:19:18:68:547:167:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:we try to provide a rough estimation of thenetgains from hedging for the average Örm in our sample.
21:718:64063:18:18:85:547:149:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:A:BeneÖts.The proportional change in loan spreads that is brought about by hedging can be cal-
21:719:64155:18:17:68:547:131:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:culated by multiplying the regression coe¢ cient in column (2) of Table II (=-2:02) by the Örmís

21:722:64399:11:15:77:546:92:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:21Estimates for comparable subsamples in Cooper and Davydenko (2007) range from 74% to 85%. The sample size
21:723:64506:15:0:68:385:77:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:drops due to missing values of variables used to estimate the true cost of debt.
22:724:64588:0:19:68:547:716:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:hedging amount (IR/FX hedging). The annual interest rate saving can be then estimated by multi-

22:726:64779:18:19:68:547:679:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:additional investment can be computed as follows: regression coe¢ cient in column (1) of Table IV

22:728:64955:18:18:85:547:642:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:A:Costs.The Örm needs to pay a bid-ask spread when entering an IR/FX derivatives contract, and
22:729:65047:18:19:68:547:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:it also needs to pay a premium for buying an option contract. Costs arising from bid-ask spreads in
22:730:65146:19:18:68:547:605:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:forward and swap contracts are calculated at 1.5 basis points of the notional value of those derivatives
22:731:65250:18:19:68:547:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(cf. Hull (2008)). The costs associated with the options contract is calculated at 1.5 basis points
22:732:65349:19:18:68:547:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of the notional value (estimated from Brown (2001)). Option premium may vary according to the
22:733:65442:18:19:68:547:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:underlying security, time to maturity, and other factors. While information on premiums for over-the-
22:734:65543:19:18:68:547:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:counter option contracts is not available, we use the average 1% premium rate for an at-the-money
22:735:65640:18:18:68:547:513:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:option traded at the Philadelphia Stock Exchange as a proxy.  Annual cost of running a hedging
22:736:65734:18:19:68:426:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:program is estimated at 1.5 basis point of annual sales (see Brown (2001)).
22:737:65809:19:18:85:547:476:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We then compute the di§erence between the above beneÖts and costs. Finally, after applying
22:738:65899:18:19:68:547:458:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a Örmís simulated marginal tax rate to the computed net gain, we compare it to the Örmís income
22:739:65994:19:18:68:547:439:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:before extraordinary items.22We Önd that the average Örm in our sample has an annual net gain
22:740:66087:18:19:68:547:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from hedging of about 4.7% of its annual income. It is worth noting, however, that our estimate is
22:741:66185:19:18:68:547:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:likely to be a conservative Ögure. First, we do not consider many other beneÖts of hedging in the
22:742:66282:18:18:68:547:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:analysis (e.g., improved contract terms when dealing with stakeholders such as suppliers and employ-
22:743:66382:18:19:68:547:366:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ees). Second, our calculation is likely to overstate the cost of hedging. For example, Örms engaging in
22:744:66485:19:18:68:547:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the use of options may buy and sell options simultaneously (e.g., using a collar strategy) in order to
22:745:66587:18:19:68:547:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:lower the cost of derivatives hedging. Indeed, the Örm analyzed in Brown (2001) reports a negative
22:746:66685:19:18:68:443:310:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:option premium, suggesting that the Örm sells more options than that it buys.

22:753:67188:29:19:68:547:155:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:While research on corporate risk management has long focused on the determinants of corporate
22:754:67281:19:18:68:547:136:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:hedging, recent studies investigate the value implications of hedging. This paper advances the re-
22:755:67379:18:19:68:547:118:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:search in the area by examining the e§ects of hedging policies on Örmsíaccess to capital (the price
22:756:67478:19:16:68:547:99:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of bank loans) and on their ability to invest (contractual restrictions on investment spending). We
22:757:67577:16:0:77:386:83:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:22We thank John Graham for providing us the simulated marginal tax rates.
23:758:67652:0:19:68:547:716:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:present evidence that Örms pay lower interest rate spreads and are less likely to have covenants re-
23:759:67752:19:18:68:547:697:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:stricting their investment in private credit agreements after hedging programs are put in place. The
23:760:67852:18:19:68:547:679:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:results we Önd are consistent with theories proposing that hedging works as a commitment mecha-
23:761:67947:19:18:68:547:660:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:nism that limits the set of possible cash áow realizations, which in turn eases Örmsíaccess to external
23:762:68050:18:18:68:547:642:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:funding. ConÖrming the logic of our base results, we Önd that the e§ects of hedging on loan prices
23:763:68148:18:19:68:547:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and covenants are modulated by proxies associated with Örm risk. For example, Örms with higher
23:764:68242:19:18:68:547:605:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Önancial distress costs pay lower interest rates on their loans when they have hedging policies put in
23:765:68344:18:19:68:286:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:place prior to signing their credit agreements.
23:766:68391:19:18:85:547:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Our paper provides new insights into the importance of corporate hedging, characterizing the
23:767:68483:18:19:68:547:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:channels through which hedging a§ects corporate outcomes ó e§ects that are likely to be reáected
23:768:68579:19:18:68:547:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in Örm valuation.  For example, the negative relation between hedging and loan spreads that we

23:771:68864:19:18:68:364:476:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Önancial contracting a§ects investment and corporate welfare.
23:772:68925:18:19:85:547:458:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Taken altogether, our Öndings provide additional rationales for hedging showing that these policies
23:773:69024:19:18:68:547:439:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are positively valued by creditors and might ultimately translate into gains for all corporate stake-
23:774:69125:18:19:68:547:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:holders by facilitating the investment. These insights might help us better understand the role of
23:775:69223:19:0:68:547:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:corporate hedging and may help delineate the size and scope of the market for derivatives instruments.

24:777:69376:39:18:85:547:677:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We follow the procedure suggested by Cooper and Davydenko (2007) to decompose the loan spread
24:778:69469:18:18:68:547:659:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:into the cost of debt and the expected default loss on the outstanding debt. First, we solve for asset
24:779:69571:18:19:68:547:641:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:volatility (-) and maturity of debt (T) from the two simultaneous equations in the risky debt pricing

24:787:69925:18:19:85:546:567:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Second, we estimate the cost of equity (rE) based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model using the
24:788:70019:19:18:68:547:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:market risk premium calculated as the average annual premium of the CRSP value-weighted index

24:790:70209:18:19:68:333:512:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:assets as-= (rE-r)-/-E, whereris risk-free rate.
24:791:70257:19:29:85:358:493:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Third, we estimate the expected default loss on the debt:

24:797:70378:30:29:85:271:434:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, the cost of debt is obtained as:
