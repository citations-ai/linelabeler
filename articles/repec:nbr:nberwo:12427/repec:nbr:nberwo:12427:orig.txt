2:30:1685:42:14:107:539:581:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:As  the  Japanese  population  structure  changes,  health  care  and  long-term  care  costs  will
2:31:1784:14:15:71:539:567:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:steadily increase. The current style of financing (pay-as-you-go) will create a large increase in future
2:32:1888:15:14:71:539:552:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:burden of these costs. This paper studies an alternative policy that prefunds the social insurance
2:33:1986:14:14:71:182:538:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:benefits for the elderly.
2:34:2011:14:14:107:539:524:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:During a transition process, the proposed scheme maintains a higher contribution rate in
2:35:2099:14:14:71:539:510:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:order to accumulate sufficient funds. Under our baseline scenario, the sum of the contribution rates
2:36:2199:14:14:71:539:496:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:toward health insurance and long-term care insurance increases from 5.06 percent of earnings to
2:37:2294:14:15:71:539:482:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:12.41 percent of the same. The rate of increase in overall burdens, including taxes and subsidies, is
2:38:2395:15:14:71:124:467:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:63 percent.
2:39:2406:14:14:107:539:453:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Our sensitivity analysis has shown that the quantitative implications of the increase in total
2:40:2500:14:14:71:539:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:burdens depend on social cost scenarios, the labor force, and the interest rate. However, labor force
2:41:2601:14:14:71:539:425:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:scenarios do not have a considerable impact on the rate of burden. As against this, the setting of
2:42:2699:14:14:71:306:411:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:social costs has a significant impact on the same.
2:43:2749:14:14:107:539:397:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Even under the most optimistic scenario, the rate of increase in total burden is 34 percent.
2:44:2841:14:15:71:539:383:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Even though we cannot predict the exact amount of the necessary contribution rate that is capable
2:45:2938:15:14:71:539:368:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:enough  to  transfer  the  funded  system,  what  we  are  sure  of  is  that  a  significant  increase  in  the
2:46:3050:14:42:71:215:354:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:contribution rate is inevitable.

3:62:3341:0:19:105:180:701:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:1. Introduction 
3:63:3357:19:20:105:108:682:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3: 
3:64:3357:20:19:134:508:662:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The  2003  annual  report  on  the  Japanese  Economy  and  Public  Finance  (released 
3:65:3444:19:20:105:508:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:by the Japanese Cabinet Office) stated “the sustainability of the present fiscal and social 
3:66:3536:20:19:105:508:623:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:security systems is uncertain and hence, an early commitment toward bold institutional 
3:67:3623:19:19:105:508:604:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:reforms  is  required.”  The  annual  report  listed  for  the  first  time  social  security  reforms 
3:68:3726:19:20:105:508:585:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with  regard  to  the  aging  population,  and  presented  these  reforms  not  in  the  form  of  a 
3:69:3827:20:19:105:444:565:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:problem to be dealt with in the future but as an issue of urgent importance. 
3:70:3904:19:20:134:508:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In   the   public   pension   reforms   of   2004,   Japan   cut   future   pension   benefits 
3:71:3999:20:19:105:508:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:substantially.  Since  the  ratio  of  the  aggregate  pension  benefits  to  the  national  income 
3:72:4099:19:20:105:508:507:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(NI) is designed to be stable in the future, the financial problems associated with public 
3:73:4190:20:19:105:508:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:pension   have   been   resolved   to   some   extent.   Failure   to   reduce   intergenerational 
3:74:4289:19:20:105:508:468:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:inequality  is  a  persistent  problem  in  the  public  pension  program;  this  is  because  the 
3:75:4388:20:19:105:508:448:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:primary  aim  of  the  reforms  was  to  reduce  the  pension  benefits  and  contributions  of 
3:76:4484:19:19:105:198:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:future generations.   
3:77:4506:19:20:134:508:410:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The expenditure incurred on health insurance and long-term care insurance is also 
3:78:4588:20:19:105:508:390:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:expected to increase. It is not easy however to reduce these benefits as pension benefits 
3:79:4678:19:20:105:508:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:because  health  care  and  long-term  care  services  are  essential  for  human  welfare. 
3:80:4770:20:19:105:508:351:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Bradford and Max (1997) and Cutler and Sheiner (2000) have shown that an unfunded 
3:81:4852:19:20:105:508:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:health  insurance  creates  considerable  intergenerational  income  redistribution.  If  these 
3:82:4948:20:19:105:508:312:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:health   insurance   costs   are   financed   using   the   current   scheme   (essentially,   a 
3:83:5045:19:20:105:508:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:pay-as-you-go system), a large increase in the future burden of these costs will become 
3:84:5133:20:19:105:508:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:inevitable, thus creating an intergenerational imbalance of burden. One way of restoring 
3:85:5222:19:20:105:508:254:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:intergenerational  equity  is  for  social  insurance  programs  to  prefund  the  expected 
3:86:5314:20:19:105:508:234:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:increase  in  future  costs.  In  this  paper,  we  consider  the  effects  of  introducing  a 
3:87:5409:19:19:105:508:215:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:prefunding  scheme  on  the  intergenerational  distribution  of  burdens.  Based  on  the 
3:88:5500:19:20:105:508:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:following  three  points,  this  paper  gives  new  insights  into  the  future  financial  problems 
3:89:5601:20:19:105:241:176:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of social insurance programs. 
3:90:5631:19:20:134:508:157:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:First, this paper examines both health care and long-term care programs. Feldstein 
3:91:5714:20:19:105:508:137:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(1999)  proposed  prefunding  of  the  Medicare  program,  and  Suzuki  (2000)  conducted  a 
3:92:5807:19:20:105:508:118:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:simulation study of the prefunding of the Japanese health insurance program. This paper 
3:93:5895:20:43:105:508:98:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:also  explores  the  concept  of  prefunding  long-term  care  insurance.  Annual  spending  on 
4:94:5991:43:0:297:315:55:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:- 2 - 
4:95:5997:0:19:105:508:701:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:long-term care services is smaller than the expenditure incurred on health care services; 
4:96:6087:19:20:105:508:682:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:however,   long-term   care   costs   are   concentrated   heavily   on   the   aged   population. 
4:97:6186:20:19:105:508:662:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Therefore, prefunding the cost associated with long-term care requires a large amount of 
4:98:6275:19:20:105:508:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:saving.  It is  necessary  to take into account both  health and  long-term care insurance in 
4:99:6369:20:19:105:508:623:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:order  to  be  able  to  comprehend  the  financial  problems  faced  by  social  insurance 
4:100:6461:19:19:105:217:604:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:programs in the future.   
4:101:6487:19:20:134:508:585:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Our analysis of the intergenerational inequity of burdens is along the lines of the 
4:102:6571:20:19:105:508:565:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:generational  accounting  pioneered  by  Auerbach,  Gokhale,  and  Kotlikoff  (1991).  Since 
4:103:6664:19:20:105:508:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:we have focused on the ways in which health and long-term care costs may be financed, 
4:104:6750:20:19:105:508:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the   analytical   framework   adopted   is   somewhat   different   from   that   used   in   the 
4:105:6849:19:20:105:508:507:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:generational  accounting  approach.  We  specify  future  policy  variables  and  calculate  the 
4:106:6946:20:19:105:508:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cost burdens with regard to the specified policy scenario. Our focus is confined only to 
4:107:7035:19:20:105:508:468:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:health   and   long-term   care   insurances,   while   the   generational   accounting   model 
4:108:7131:20:19:105:508:448:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:considers a wider range of governmental programs. We have instead provided a detailed 
4:109:7217:19:19:105:247:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:discussion of these programs.   
4:110:7249:19:20:134:508:410:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Second,  our  simulation  has  a  long  time  horizon  until  the  fiscal  year  (FY)  2100, 
4:111:7342:20:19:105:508:390:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:while  the  government  has  projected  social  security  costs  for  health  care  and  long-term 
4:112:7441:19:20:105:508:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:care  until  FY  2025.  Government  projections  with  regard  to  social  security  costs  were 
4:113:7538:20:19:105:508:351:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:only until FY 2025 since the aging process was expected to reach its peak at this point 
4:114:7626:19:20:105:508:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with  most  baby  boomers  approaching  the  end  of  their  lifetime.  Due  to  a  decline  in

4:116:7812:19:20:105:508:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:much longer time horizon is required  in order to examine the effects of a demographic

4:118:7934:19:20:134:508:254:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Third,  the  validity  of  future  projections  is  examined.  The  main  alternative 
4:119:8020:20:19:105:508:234:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:scenario  here  assumes  that  with  the  exception  of  population  structure,  all  the  present 
4:120:8119:19:19:105:508:215:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:factors will be sustained in the future. This projection procedure is applied mechanically 
4:121:8210:19:20:105:508:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to  the  labor  force,   health  care  expenditure,  and  long-term  care  costs  instead  of 
4:122:8304:20:19:105:508:176:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:constructing  a  sophisticated  forecasting  model.  A  virtue  of  the  mechanical  projection 
4:123:8400:19:20:105:508:157:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:model  is  that  relationships  between  the  variables  under  consideration  can  be  easily 
4:124:8495:20:19:105:508:137:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:established. Comparing the projected values with the government’s forecasts can clarify 
4:125:8583:19:20:105:469:118:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the manner in which projections are influenced by the government assumptions. 
4:126:8661:20:43:134:508:98:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The  organization  of  this  paper  is  as  follows.  Section  2  describes  the  current

5:128:8757:0:19:105:508:701:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:problems  in  the  budget  of  the  Japanese  social  security  programs. We  point  out  that  the 
5:129:8857:19:20:105:508:682:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:growth   of  health  and  long-term  care   costs  is  the  most  serious  problem  for  the 
5:130:8950:20:19:105:296:662:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sustainability of the government budget.   
5:131:8993:19:20:134:508:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Section 3 focuses on the projections of labor force participation. The government 
5:132:9075:20:19:105:508:623:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:projection  is  optimistic  because  it  assumes  that  a  greater  number  of  women  and  the 
5:133:9171:19:19:105:508:604:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:elderly  will  participate  in  the  labor  market.  We  provide  an  alternative  projection  in 
5:134:9269:19:20:105:508:585:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:which increasing labor force participation is not expected. Although the estimated labor 
5:135:9358:20:19:105:508:565:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:force depends on the assumptions of labor supply behavior, the trend decline in the total 
5:136:9448:19:20:105:321:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:labor force will be significant in any scenario.   
5:137:9499:20:19:134:508:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Section 4 focuses on health care expenditure and long-term care service costs. We 
5:138:9581:19:20:105:508:507:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:project  these  costs  until  FY  2100  with  regard  to  three  scenarios.  Even  under  the  most 
5:139:9681:20:19:105:508:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:optimistic  scenario  that  assumes  stagnation  in  the  growth  of  per  capita  cost,  the 
5:140:9775:19:20:105:432:468:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:abovementioned costs to income will steadily increase until the 2060s.   
5:141:9848:20:19:134:508:448:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Section  5 explains some policy simulations that deal with the financing of future 
5:142:9931:19:19:105:508:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:health  and  long-term  care  costs  until  FY  2100.  It  is  shown  that  the  balanced  budget 
5:143:10029:19:20:105:508:410:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:operation of health and long-term care insurances will create a large inequity of burden 
5:144:10118:20:19:105:508:390:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:across generations. Raising the premium immediately and prefunding rising future costs 
5:145:10205:19:20:105:508:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:will help to equate the burden across generations. However, with regard to our baseline 
5:146:10293:20:19:105:490:351:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:scenario, the total burden must be raised immediately by approximately 60 percent.   
5:147:10378:19:20:134:371:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We present some concluding remarks in Section 6.

6:182:12103:18:13:105:508:122:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:fluctuation when the VAT tax rate changes. The Japanese government had begun to use

7:187:12404:0:19:110:507:701:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:was achieved by the pension reform of 2004. Prior to this reform, the contribution rate 
7:188:12492:19:20:110:507:682:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for  private  employees  toward  the  pension  program  was  planned  to  increase  gradually 
7:189:12586:20:19:110:507:662:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from 13.58 percent of total earnings to 23.1 percent of the same in FY 2020. Since this 
7:190:12674:19:20:110:507:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:figure  appeared  to  be  unacceptable,  controlling  the  contribution  rate  became  the 
7:191:12765:20:19:110:507:623:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:primary focus of this reform. The final contribution rate was reduced to 18.3 percent of 
7:192:12854:19:19:110:507:604:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:total  earnings,  and  a  significant  reduction  in  benefits  for  the  future  was  implemented. 
7:193:12954:19:20:110:507:585:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:However,  this  reform  does  not  resolve  all  of  the  major  problems.  As  explained  by 
7:194:13048:20:19:110:507:565:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Maekawa  (2004),  since  benefits  are  gradually  reduced,  the  reform  fails  to  correct  the 
7:195:13146:19:20:110:507:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:inequity  in  net  benefits  among  generations.  An  immediate  reduction  in  benefits 
7:196:13235:20:19:110:507:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:accompanied  by  an  increase  in  the  contribution  rate  is  necessary  to  reduce  the 
7:197:13326:19:20:110:237:507:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:intergenerational inequity.

7:201:13645:19:19:110:507:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:percentage points during the same period. The  big question that needs to be answered 
7:202:13731:19:20:110:355:410:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:by the policy makers is: How to finance these costs?

7:205:13965:20:19:110:507:351:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:imbalance  of  burdens.  Prefunding  future  social  security  costs  will  help  to  reduce  this 
7:206:14064:19:20:110:507:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:imbalance  by  forcing  the  present  generations  to  pay  more,  thereby  reducing  the  extra 
7:207:14161:20:19:110:507:312:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:burden on future generations. The financial condition of a prefunding system relies on

7:209:14337:20:19:110:507:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:change  in  medicine.  Since  the  reliability  of  a  future  projection  is  a  crucial  factor  in 
7:210:14439:19:20:110:507:254:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:determining the success of a prefunding schemes, we shall examine how a prefunding

10:334:20863:13:13:105:508:161:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimates made in academic studies that also incorporated behavioral changes. This can 
10:335:20950:13:13:105:508:148:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:be  attributed  to  the  fact  that  there  is  no  scope  for  drastic  changes  in  the  labor  force 
10:336:21054:13:13:105:508:135:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:participation rates of working-age populations. In addition, although the trend regarding 
10:337:21144:13:13:105:508:122:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:birth   rates   in   the   future   is   uncertain,   future   population   can   be   predicted   with 
10:338:21248:13:8:105:203:109:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:considerable surety.   
10:339:21271:8:18:105:508:101:8:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:3  The Population Census recorded the labor force in 2000 to be 66.1 million. According 
10:340:21359:18:28:105:330:83:11:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:to the Labor Force Survey, it was 67.66 million.

12:342:22559:0:19:134:508:701:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The  MHLW  2004  projection  regarded  the  labor  force  as  a  labor  input.  Since  the 
12:343:22650:19:20:105:508:682:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:efficiency of labor varies with age, the overall values of labor force and labor input may 
12:344:22741:20:19:105:508:662:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:fluctuate  differently.  However,  the  procedure  followed  in  the  MHLW  2004  projection 
12:345:22834:19:20:105:508:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:can  be  refined.  We  estimated  an  efficiency  unit  of  labor  implied  by  the  two  MHLW 
12:346:22929:20:19:105:508:623:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:projections,  assuming  that  efficiency  is  directly  proportional  to  wage.  The  age-wage 
12:347:23024:19:19:105:508:604:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:profile by age group and sex was collected from the published cross-tables of the 2003 
12:348:23111:19:20:105:507:585:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Basic  Survey  on  Wage  Structure  (Chingin  Kozo  Kihon  Chosa,  MHLW).  For  each  age 
12:349:23201:20:19:105:508:565:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the  efficiency  unit  of  labor  input  is  calculated  as  the  product  of  the  total  wage  per 
12:350:23302:19:20:105:508:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:worker and the projected labor force. We rescaled the aggregated efficiency unit of labor 
12:351:23392:20:19:105:508:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in  2004  so  that  it  equalled  the  total  labor  force  in  that  year.  We  considered  three 
12:352:23491:19:20:105:508:507:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:scenarios:   our   mechanical   projection   (pessimistic),   the   MHLW   2004   projection 
12:353:23584:20:19:105:400:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(optimistic), and the MHLW 2002 projection (more optimistic).   
12:354:23648:19:20:134:508:468:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure  1  depicts  the  three  scenarios  regarding  labor  input.  According  to  our 
12:355:23736:20:19:105:508:448:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:abovementioned  normalization,  the  MHLW  2002  labor  force  projection  estimated  the 
12:356:23826:19:19:105:508:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:labor  input  in  2025  to  be  63.02  million.  The  2004  counterpart  of  our  mechanical 
12:357:23919:19:20:105:508:410:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:projection is estimated to be 59.03 million. The MHLW 2004 projection underlying the 
12:358:24004:20:19:105:508:390:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:social  security  cost  projection  lies  between  these  two  values.  While  the  difference 
12:359:24099:19:20:105:508:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:between these projections is significant, all of them project a further decline in the value 
12:360:24192:20:19:105:508:351:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of  labor  input  after  2025.  In  2100,  the  value  of  labor  input  is  estimated  to  be  30.08 
12:361:24294:19:20:105:508:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:million in the most optimistic case as against 28.08 million in the most pessimistic one. 
12:362:24384:20:19:105:508:312:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The  bottom  line  is  that  even  in  the  most  optimistic  scenario,  the  large  decline  in  the 
12:363:24486:19:20:105:323:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:availability of labor force will be unavoidable.

14:368:24808:19:20:105:108:682:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3: 
14:369:24808:20:19:134:508:662:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The  MHLW  projection  assumes  that  the  costs  incurred  by  health  care  and 
14:370:24890:19:20:105:508:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:long-term  care  will  grow  more  rapidly  as  compared  to  income.  If  our  mechanical 
14:371:24981:20:19:105:508:623:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:projection  procedure  is  applied  to  both  these  costs,  the  estimates  will  be  smaller  than 
14:372:25082:19:19:105:508:604:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:those estimated by official projections. To clarify the meaning of the official projections, 
14:373:25175:19:20:105:508:585:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:this  section  describes  a  sensitivity  analysis  employing  alternative  settings  for  the  key 
14:374:25275:20:19:105:508:565:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:variables. Combining the two scenarios of health and long-term care costs with the three 
14:375:25364:19:20:105:508:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:projection  scenarios  of  labor  forces,  we  apply  six  cases  of  projections.  The  following 
14:376:25463:20:19:105:508:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:two subsections describe a procedure used for projecting the two costs. We then present 
14:377:25551:19:20:105:325:507:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the results obtained for the sensitivity analysis.

14:380:25625:19:19:105:508:448:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Table  4  compares  five  recent  projections  about  health  care  and  long-term  care  costs. 
14:381:25722:19:19:105:508:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Since projections in different years assume different inflation rates, comparing nominal 
14:382:25811:19:20:105:508:410:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:variables  is  misleading.  When  we  look  at  the  ratios  of  social  security  benefits  to  NI, 
14:383:25912:20:19:105:508:390:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:projected health expenditures differ mildly. The real growth of health care costs appears 
14:384:26002:19:20:105:356:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to be more stable than the nominal growth of the same.

16:387:27030:0:19:134:508:701:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Future  health  expenditures  are  projected  by  extrapolating  the  most  recent  actual 
16:388:27121:19:20:105:508:682:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:values  of  nominal  health  expenditure;  these  do  not  correspond  with  the  values  of 
16:389:27214:20:19:105:508:662:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:inflation rate and economic growth rate. For example, the May 2004 projection assumes 
16:390:27300:19:20:105:508:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that the per capita nominal health care cost for the nonelderly (individuals under the age 
16:391:27391:20:19:105:508:623:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of  69) will  grow at 2.1 percent and that for the elderly aged 70 and above will grow at 
16:392:27481:19:19:105:508:604:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:3.2  percent.  These  growth  rates  are  based  on  the  historical  averages  recorded  during 
16:393:27578:19:20:105:508:585:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1995  and  1999.4  The  extrapolation  of  nominal  health  expenditure  without  taking  into 
16:394:27673:20:19:105:508:565:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:account  the  effects  of  inflation  can  be  problematic  from  the  viewpoint  of  economic 
16:395:27768:19:20:105:508:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:theory.   Economists   generally   make   projections   based   on   real   values,   and   the 
16:396:27864:20:19:105:508:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:methodologies adopted by them belong to a family of mechanical projections. Iwamoto 
16:397:27948:19:20:105:508:507:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(2004) analyzed several projections made in existing studies such as  Ogura and Irifune 
16:398:28036:20:19:105:508:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(1990), Ogura (1994), Niki (1995), Iwamoto, Takeshita, and Bessho (1997), Nishimura 
16:399:28120:19:20:105:508:468:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(1997),  and  Tokita  et  al.  (1997).  He  concluded  that  in  the  following  30  years,  the 
16:400:28217:20:19:105:508:448:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:national  health  expenditure  would  increase  by  about  1.4  times  compared  to  its  level  in 
16:401:28317:19:19:105:508:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:2000.  Our  mechanical  projection  follows  a  method  established  by  existing  studies  and 
16:402:28413:19:20:105:508:410:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:assumes  that  per  capita  health  expenditure  by  age  group  reported  in  the  National 
16:403:28506:20:19:105:508:390:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Medical Expenditure (MHLW, shown in Table 5) will be sustained in the future. For the 
16:404:28592:19:20:105:456:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:future population data, we use the medium variant of the official projection.   
16:405:28672:20:19:134:508:351:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Although the above projection assumes no real growth of health care cost, it can 
16:406:28753:19:20:105:508:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:be  easily  extended  to  cases  in  which  the  health  care  cost  grows.  When  the  economy 
16:407:28849:20:19:105:508:312:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:grows,  we  focus  on  the  ratio  of  health  care  cost  to  income.  When  the  health  care  cost 
16:408:28951:19:20:105:508:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and  income  grow  at  the  same  rate,  the  ratio  will  not  change.  In  such  a  scenario,  our 
16:409:29052:20:19:105:508:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:mechanical  projection  estimates  can  be  considered  as  this  ratio.  In  the  alternative 
16:410:29147:19:20:105:508:254:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:framework  described  in  the  next  section,  we  will  concern  ourselves  only  with  the 
16:411:29240:20:19:105:508:234:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:difference in growth rates between costs and income and not with the absolute levels of 
16:412:29328:19:19:105:186:215:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:each growth rate.

16:415:29394:14:18:105:508:127:8:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:4  The  MHLW  provides  an  estimation  of  the  growth  rate  in  medical  expenditure  after 
16:416:29489:18:13:105:508:109:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:adjusting for the effects of population aging since 1980. Overall, the per capita medical 
16:417:29579:13:13:105:508:96:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:expenditure  had  grown  less  than  per  capita  GDP;  however,  this  correspondence  was

18:468:31247:20:19:105:508:662:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:converted so that they were in concordance with the income level of FY 2004. First, per 
18:469:31335:19:20:105:508:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:capita  health  care  cost  by  age  group  was  proportionally  adjusted  so  that  the  national 
18:470:31434:20:19:105:508:623:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:aggregate of the same matches the figures reported in the Medical Information Analysis 
18:471:31521:19:19:105:508:604:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:System (MEDIAS), which reports the health care costs paid by public health insurance. 
18:472:31607:19:20:105:508:585:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The national aggregate of health  care costs was calculated as the product of population 
18:473:31696:20:19:105:508:565:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and  per  capita  cost  by  age  group.  The  rescaled  age-cost  profile  was  used  to  project 
18:474:31794:19:20:105:215:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:future health care costs. 
18:475:31820:20:19:134:508:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Further,  we  decomposed  the  total  cost  toward  social  insurance  payment  and 
18:476:31904:19:20:105:508:507:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:out-of-pocket  expenses.  Unfortunately,  MEDIAS  does  not  provide  this  decomposition. 
18:477:31995:20:19:105:508:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We  obtained   the  figures  for   social  security  payment  from   the   National  Medical 
18:478:32088:19:20:105:507:468:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Expenditure  survey  (Kokumin  Iryohi).5  While  allocating  social  insurance  payment 
18:479:32176:20:19:105:508:448:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:across  generations,  we  used  the  statutory  coinsurance  rates  of  2004  and  assumed  that 
18:480:32273:19:19:105:508:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:they  will  be  sustained  in  the  future.  Since  April  2003,  the  coinsurance  rate  for  the  age 
18:481:32377:19:20:105:508:410:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:group  0–2  years  has  been  20  percent,  whereas  for  the  age  group  3–69,  it  has  been  30 
18:482:32477:20:19:105:508:390:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:percent.  For  individuals  aged  70  years  and  above,  the  rate  in  principle  has  been  10 
18:483:32575:19:20:105:508:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:percent  (a  rate  of  20  percent  is  applied  to  high-income  earners).  Due  to  the  lack  of 
18:484:32675:20:19:105:508:351:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:available data, we assume that a rate of 10 percent is applied to all individuals aged 70 
18:485:32765:19:20:105:508:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and  above.  However,  the  actual  out-of-pocket  payments  are  less  than  the  statutory 
18:486:32858:20:19:105:508:312:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:coinsurance  rate  because  of  stop-loss  rules  and  other  schemes  to  reduce  out-of-pocket 
18:487:32955:19:20:105:508:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:expenses. We proportionally scaled the statutory coinsurance rates so that the sum of the 
18:488:33045:20:19:105:508:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimated   social   insurance   payments   matched   the   aggregate   values   reported   by 
18:489:33140:19:20:105:191:254:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:MEDIAS in 2004. 
18:490:33156:20:19:134:508:234:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Since  the  available  data  on  health  expenditure  does  not  separately  report  the 
18:491:33245:19:19:105:508:215:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:expenditure  incurred  for  the  age  groups  0–2  and  3–4,  we  assumed  that  the  health 
18:492:33338:19:29:105:508:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:expenditure  per  capita  will  be  uniform  in  these  age  groups;  we  then  calculated  the 
18:493:33434:29:14:105:244:167:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:                                                 
18:494:33482:14:18:105:508:153:8:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:5  The  National  Medical  Expenditure  (NME)  lags  one  year  behind  MEDIAS  in  the 
18:495:33570:18:13:105:508:135:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:release of data. We first estimated the 2004 NME data by multiplying the growth rate of 
18:496:33658:13:13:105:508:122:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a  comparable  MEDIAS  variable  between  2003  and  2004  with  the  2003  NME  data. 
18:497:33745:13:13:105:508:109:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Since  out-of-pocket  expenses  for  NME  also  include  payments  of  medical  treatments 
18:498:33836:13:13:105:508:96:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that  are  not  covered  by  the  social  security  programs,  we  estimated  the  out-of-pocket 
18:499:33933:13:28:105:322:83:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:payments as a residual of the overall payments. 
19:500:33981:28:0:295:318:55:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:- 17 - 
19:501:33988:0:19:105:508:701:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:average  coinsurance  rate.  Since  actual  costs  are  concentrated  on  newborn  babies,  this 
19:502:34085:19:20:105:508:682:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:procedure may slightly overestimate the true social security payment value. However, at 
19:503:34173:20:19:105:508:662:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the  same  time,  many  municipal  governments  offer  extra  benefits  toward  the  health 
19:504:34265:19:20:105:508:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:expenditure  of  infants  from  their  general  budget.  Since  we  do  not  incorporate  these 
19:505:34361:20:19:105:508:623:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:subsidies  into  our  estimation  process,  it  results  in  an  underestimation  of  the  social 
19:506:34459:19:19:105:508:604:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:security  benefits  granted  to  these  age  groups.  However,  the  overall  impact  of  these 
19:507:34555:19:20:105:318:585:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:subsidies on our estimation bias is ambiguous. 
19:508:34602:20:19:134:508:565:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We  then  reproduced  the  MHLW  2004  projection  of  the  future  health  insurance 
19:509:34688:19:20:105:508:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:benefits. The MHLW 2004 projection assumes that the nominal wage growth rate is 2.1 
19:510:34772:20:19:105:508:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:percent per annum. Therefore, per capita health care costs for the nonelderly will grow 
19:511:34860:19:20:105:508:507:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:simultaneously  with  the  growth  rate  of  wage.  As  against  this,  the  growth  rate  of  per 
19:512:34959:20:19:105:508:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:capita  costs  for  the  elderly  will  exceed  that  for  wage  by  1.1  percentage  points.  The 
19:513:35058:19:20:105:508:468:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:projection  with  regard  to  the  nonelderly  is  the  same  as  our  mechanical  projection.  For 
19:514:35158:20:19:105:508:448:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:costs beyond 2025, we need to first specify the growth rate of wage for the same. If the 
19:515:35247:19:19:105:508:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:growth  rate  of  health  care  costs  continuously  exceeds  that  of  wage,  it  will  ultimately 
19:516:35347:19:20:105:508:410:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:exhaust  all  the  resources  available  to  consumers.  We  thus  need  to  assume  that  the 
19:517:35442:20:19:105:508:390:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:growth  in  health  care  costs  will  cease  sometime  in  the  future.  Hence,  we  consider  two 
19:518:35542:19:20:105:508:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cases  in  which  a  faster  growth  in  health  care  costs  will  eventually  stop  in  FY  2025  or 
19:519:35645:20:19:105:508:351:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:FY 2100. In the former case, the per capita health care cost for the elderly is 5.56 times 
19:520:35736:19:20:105:508:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:greater than that for the nonelderly. The counterpart in FY2004 is 4.3. In the latter case, 
19:521:35828:20:19:105:508:312:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:an extreme increase occurs in the growth of health care cost for the elderly; the ratio in 
19:522:35919:19:20:105:215:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:FY2100 will be 13.09.   
19:523:35943:20:19:134:508:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:As a measure of financial burden, we focus on the ratio of social security benefits 
19:524:36027:19:20:105:508:254:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to the compensation of employees and the mixed income in terms of national accounts. 
19:525:36112:20:19:105:508:234:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The denominator of the ratio is assumed to be proportional to the amount of labor input. 
19:526:36201:19:19:105:508:215:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Changes  in  future  health  care  costs  can  be  described  by  the  following  three  scenarios: 
19:527:36301:19:20:105:508:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the  per  capita  health  care  cost  for  the  elderly  will  (1)  grow  at  the  same  rate  as  that  of 
19:528:36409:20:19:105:508:176:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:wage growth (optimistic), (2) will exceed the wage growth rate by 1.1 percentage points 
19:529:36497:19:20:105:508:157:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:until  FY  2025  (pessimistic),  or  (3)  will exceed the  wage  growth  rate  by  1.1  percentage 
19:530:36596:20:19:105:508:137:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:points  until  FY  2100  (very  pessimistic).  Combining  these  three  scenarios  with  future 
19:531:36692:19:20:105:508:118:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:changes in labor input yields nine different cases of future projection. The upper section 
19:532:36783:20:43:105:255:98:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of Table 6 presents these ratios.

20:565:38138:12:11:114:155:294:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:be constant.

20:569:38266:19:20:134:508:232:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The MHLW 2004 projection indicates that the ratio of health expenditure to labor 
20:570:38347:20:19:105:508:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:input  in  FY  2025  will  exceed  its  value  in  FY  2004  by  1.58.  This  scenario  was 
20:571:38439:19:20:105:508:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:reproduced  in  our  social  cost  pessimistic  and  labor  force  optimistic  scenarios;  this 
20:572:38535:20:19:105:508:173:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:indicates that the ratio will grow by a factor of 1.56 between FY 2004 and FY 2025. On 
20:573:38622:19:20:105:508:154:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the other hand, same ratio under the mechanical projection will grow by a factor of 1.38 
20:574:38711:20:19:105:508:134:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:during the same period. Therefore, the MHLW 2004 projection is more pessimistic with 
20:575:38796:19:20:105:508:115:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:regard  to  a  future  increase  in  health  expenditure  as  compared  to  our  mechanical 
20:576:38888:20:40:105:508:95:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:projection.  However,  the  most  pessimistic  scenario  is  a  combination  of  an  extremely

21:579:39090:19:20:105:508:682:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:labor force in the future. In this case, the ratio of health expenditure to labor input in FY 
21:580:39184:20:19:105:325:662:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:2025 will exceed its value in FY 2004 by 1.63.   
21:581:39233:19:20:134:508:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A  noticeable  point  is  that  this  ratio  will  keep  increasing,  and  its  value  in  2050 
21:582:39329:20:19:105:508:623:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:under  the  setting  employed  by  the  governmental  projection  will  be  1.98  times  greater 
21:583:39426:19:19:105:508:604:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:than its value in FY 2004.  In other words, FY 2025 cannot be regarded as the terminal 
21:584:39513:19:20:105:424:585:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:point for examining the sustainability of the health insurance system.6

21:587:39609:19:19:134:508:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The  government  anticipates  that  long-term  care  costs  will  grow  more  rapidly  as 
21:588:39699:19:20:105:508:507:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:compared to health care costs. According to the MHLW 2004 projection given in Table 
21:589:39783:20:19:105:508:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:4, the long-term care insurance benefits in FY 2025 (the ratio of long-term care benefits 
21:590:39873:19:20:105:508:468:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to NI) will be 2.7 times greater than its value in FY 2004. The growth rate of per capita 
21:591:39963:20:19:105:508:448:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:long-term  care  costs  is  set  to  be  higher  than  the  wage  growth  rate  although  detailed 
21:592:40062:19:19:105:341:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:assumptions have not been explicitly documented.

21:595:40293:19:20:105:508:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Demand  for  Long-term  Care  (Kaigo  Sahbisuryou  tou  no  Mitooshi,  June  2002)  was 
21:596:40381:20:19:105:508:351:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:provided  by  the  MHLW;  it  expected  an  increased  demand  for  long-term  care  in  the 
21:597:40474:19:20:105:508:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:following  five  years.  For  example,  the  provisional  nationwide  sum  of  the  usage  of 
21:598:40568:20:41:105:508:312:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:home-visit  services  will increase  by  39.3  percent from  FY  2003  (142,194  visits)  to  FY 
21:599:40665:41:14:105:244:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:                                                 
21:600:40713:14:18:105:508:257:8:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:6  We  should  note  that  our  projections  may  be  biased  in  an  upward  direction  because 
21:601:40810:18:13:105:508:239:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:they  do  not  take  into  account  the  effects  of  aging  on  terminal  care  expenses.  In  Japan, 
21:602:40913:13:13:105:508:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Ohkusa (2002) and Suzuki and Suzuki (2003) provided a modified projection that took 
21:603:40997:13:13:105:508:213:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:into  account  this  aspect.  Since  terminal  care  expenses  for  the  more  aged  tend  to 
21:604:41091:13:13:105:508:200:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:decrease, a longer longevity will increase the average age of death; hence, future health 
21:605:41181:13:13:105:508:187:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:expenditure  by  age  group  is  expected  to  be  lower  than  its  present  level.  Taking  this 
21:606:41280:13:13:105:508:174:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:effect into consideration, the abovementioned studies pointed out that the MHLW 2004 
21:607:41365:13:13:105:508:161:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:projection  overestimated  the  future  health  expenditure.  Suzuki  and  Suzuki  (2003) 
21:608:41455:13:13:105:508:148:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:reported  this  overestimation  amounted  to  approximately  4.4  percent  of  the  total  health 
21:609:41553:13:13:105:508:135:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:expenditures  for  the  elderly.  On  the  other  hand,  Ohkusa  (2002)  concluded  that  the 
21:610:41647:13:13:105:508:122:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:overestimation  reached  a  level  of  approximately  15  to  30  percent  of  the  total  health 
21:611:41745:13:13:105:508:109:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:expenditures.  The  divergence  in  their  estimates  is  quite  large  because  data  limitations 
21:612:41844:13:13:105:508:96:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:made it difficult to separate the medical expenditures of the survivors from the medical 
21:613:41933:13:28:105:277:83:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:expenses incurred by those who died.

22:616:42073:19:20:105:508:682:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:long-term care costs. We calculated the sum of these provisions weighted by their actual 
22:617:42162:20:19:105:508:662:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:costs in FY 2003 and the resulting growth during FY 2003–2007 that amounted to 26.4 
22:618:42246:19:20:105:144:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:percent. 
22:619:42255:20:19:134:508:623:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We   projected   the   future   long-term   care   insurance   benefits   by   adopting   a 
22:620:42347:19:19:105:508:604:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:methodology similar to that used for the projections of health insurance.8  At the time of 
22:621:42438:19:20:105:508:585:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:writing this paper, most recent data for annual spending by age group was available for 
22:622:42526:20:19:105:508:565:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:FY  2002;  hence,  we  estimated  annual  spending  on  the  basis  of  monthly  data.  The 
22:623:42618:19:20:105:508:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:long-term  care  expenditure  by  age  group  in  October  2004  was  calculated  from  the 
22:624:42710:20:19:105:507:526:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:Monthly Report of Long-term Care Benefits Survey (Kaigo Kyufuhi Jittai Chosa Geppo) 
22:625:42794:19:20:105:507:507:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:conducted  by  the  MHLW.9  We  then  calculated  annual  spending  by  multiplying  the 
22:626:42883:20:19:105:508:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:monthly  data  with  12  and  reported  it  in  the  right  column  of  Table  5.  The  future 
22:627:42978:19:20:105:508:468:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:long-term  care  expenditure  was  then  projected  under  the  following  three  settings.  The 
22:628:43075:20:19:105:508:448:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:first  one  (optimistic)  assumed  that  the  age-expenditure  profile  would  not  change  and 
22:629:43171:19:19:105:508:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that  only  the  population  structure  would  change.  We  then  decomposed  the  total 
22:630:43260:19:20:105:508:410:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:spending  into  social  security  benefits  and  out-of-pocket  expenses  by  assuming  that  the 
22:631:43358:20:19:105:508:390:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ratio  of  out-of-pocket  payments  to  total  costs  in  FY  2002  (8.99  percent10)  would  be 
22:632:43455:19:20:105:158:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sustained.   
22:633:43468:20:19:134:508:351:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We  then  analyzed  the  following  three  scenarios  of  long-term  care  costs:  (1)  the 
22:634:43560:19:20:105:508:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:per  capita  cost  of  each  age  group  will  grow  at  the  wage  growth  rate  (optimistic);  (2) 
22:635:43661:20:19:105:508:312:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:until 2025, the rate of growth in per capita cost will exceed the wage growth rate by 1.2 
22:636:43751:19:20:105:508:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:percentage  points  and  as  a  result,  the  total  cost  per  income  well  approximated  the 
22:637:43847:20:15:105:508:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:MHLW  2004  projection (pessimistic); and  (3)  until  2100,  the  per  capita cost  will  grow 
22:638:43943:15:14:105:244:258:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:                                                 
22:639:43991:14:18:105:508:244:8:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:7  This projection presumed that the number of individuals certified as requiring care in

22:641:44175:13:8:105:257:213:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:2,983,000 at the end of FY 2003.

22:643:44298:18:8:105:435:187:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Suzuki (2002) are involved in projecting the future long-term care costs. 
22:644:44372:8:18:105:508:179:8:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:9  The data source does not directly report cost by age group. The available cross tables 
22:645:44462:18:13:105:508:161:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:indicate   (1)   the   cost   by   the   severity   of   disability   and   (2)   the   total   number   of 
22:646:44570:13:13:105:508:148:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:beneficiaries  by  the  severity  of  disability  and  age  group.  Assuming  that  the  long-term 
22:647:44669:13:13:105:508:135:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:care  cost  of  each  level  of  disability  was  the  same  across  all  age  groups  that  were 
22:648:44767:13:8:105:489:122:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:considered, we estimated the total cost by age group by using these two cross tables. 
22:649:44853:8:18:105:508:114:8:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:10  It is slightly lower than the statutory coinsurance rate (10 percent) because there are 
22:650:44945:18:13:105:407:96:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:some measures that lighten the burden of out-of-pocket payments.

24:666:45871:19:20:134:508:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This  section  deals  with  the  simulation  of  policies  that  finance  future  health  and 
24:667:45965:20:19:105:508:623:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:long-term  care  insurance  benefits,  the  projections  of  which  were  described  in  the 
24:668:46058:19:19:105:508:604:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:previous  section.  This  section  focuses  on  the effect  of  these  policies  on fiscal  balances 
24:669:46159:19:20:105:257:585:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and burdens across generations.   
24:670:46193:20:19:134:508:565:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Since we regard the benefits derived from these insurances as necessary services 
24:671:46274:19:20:105:508:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:when  a  person  becomes  sick  or  disabled,  it  is  not  very  meaningful  to  discuss  the

24:673:46467:19:20:105:252:507:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the financing of these benefits.   
24:674:46502:20:19:134:508:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:From  October  2007,  half  of  the  benefits  derived  from  the  health  insurance  of 
24:675:46591:19:20:105:508:468:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:those  aged  75  and  above  will  be  financed  with  government  subsidies  that  are  in  turn 
24:676:46689:20:19:105:508:448:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:financed by general tax revenues. Until October 2002, only 30 percent of these benefits 
24:677:46777:19:19:105:508:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for  those  aged  70  and  above  were  financed  with  government  subsidies.  From  2002  to 
24:678:46872:19:20:105:508:410:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:2007, a transition process gradually raised the eligible age and the share of government 
24:679:46961:20:19:105:508:390:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:subsidies.  Half  of  the  long-term  care  insurance  benefit  is  financed  with  government 
24:680:47056:19:20:105:508:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:subsidies.  The  other  major  subsidies  granted  by  the  government  are  50  percent  of  the 
24:681:47154:20:19:105:507:351:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:benefits   of   National   Health   Insurance   schemes   (Kokuho)  and   13   percent   of   the

24:683:47320:20:19:134:508:312:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We assume that social insurance premiums and taxes for social insurance benefits 
24:684:47401:19:20:105:508:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are  paid  from  the  same  income  base,  which  is  the  compensation  of  employees  and  the 
24:685:47498:20:19:105:508:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:mixed  income  in  terms  of  national  accounts.  For  simplicity,  we  further  assume  that

25:708:48872:20:19:105:508:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:government  subsidies  financed  by  taxes)  to  90  percent  of  the  sum  of  compensation  of 
25:709:48969:19:20:105:508:468:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:employees and the mixed income. We aimed to calibrate the statutory premium rate by 
25:710:49053:20:19:105:510:448:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rescaling the sum of the compensation received by the employees and the mixed income.

25:713:49326:20:19:105:508:390:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to  be  8.21  percent.  The  actual  health  insurance  premium  for  the  enrollees  of  the

25:715:49513:20:19:105:508:351:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Since  the  enrollees  of  the  Government-managed  Health  Insurance  for  Employees  are

25:717:49699:20:19:105:508:312:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:workers.  Since  government  subsidies  aim  to  offset  the  earnings  difference,  we  tried  to 
25:718:49798:19:20:105:508:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:calibrate the statutory insurance premium. With regard to long-term care insurance, the 
25:719:49886:20:19:105:508:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:simulated  premium  rate  for  FY  2004  is  1.11  percent;  this  matches  the  actual  insurance

25:721:50072:20:19:105:508:234:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Employees. Under the balanced budget, the burden is equal to social insurance benefits 
25:722:50159:19:19:105:508:215:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(excluding  out-of-pocket  payment).  Therefore,  we  calculated  the  ratio  of  benefits  to

25:727:50532:19:20:105:508:118:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:health  care  continues  to  increase  until  FY  2059  when  it  touches  19.94  percent.  As 
25:728:50627:20:43:105:508:98:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:against  this,  the  burden  rate  for  long-term  care  will  touch  10.97  percent  in  FY  2066.

26:732:50921:20:19:105:508:662:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is low. The burden rate for long-term care grows much more rapidly than that for health 
26:733:51009:19:20:105:508:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:care because compared to health care benefits, long-term care benefits are concentrated 
26:734:51097:20:19:105:508:623:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to a greater extent on the aged population. For the same reason, a peak representing the 
26:735:51186:19:19:105:508:604:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:burden rate for long-term care will follow a peak of the burden rate for health care. The 
26:736:51276:19:20:105:508:585:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:total burden rate of both the insurances reaches a peak that is 30.65 percent in FY 2064. 
26:737:51366:20:19:105:473:565:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The ratio of total burden to GDP then amounts to 15.63 percent in the same year.

26:739:51541:20:19:105:508:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:governmental projection. It is defined as the ratio of lifetime burden to lifetime income. 
26:740:51632:19:20:105:508:507:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The lifetime variable is the sum of the present discounted values of the reported annual

26:742:51809:19:20:105:508:468:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:process. Therefore, the burden rate is the prospective lifetime burden for the generation

26:744:51998:19:19:105:508:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:which was used to calculate the labor input in Section 3. The interest rate is assumed to 
26:745:52088:19:20:105:359:410:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:be 1 percentage point higher than the wage growth rate.

26:747:52239:19:20:105:508:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:curve  representing  the  lifetime  burden  rates  are  not  smooth  for  early  generations, 
26:748:52333:20:19:105:508:351:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:possibly  because  our  prospective  calculation  covers  only  a  short  period  for  these 
26:749:52426:19:20:105:508:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:generations.  Figure  3  indicates  that  a  balanced  budget  system  will  impose  heavier 
26:750:52519:20:19:105:508:312:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:burdens on the younger generations. The inequality of burdens is particularly severe for 
26:751:52608:19:20:105:508:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the current working-age generation. The lifetime burden rate for those who were born in 
26:752:52696:20:19:105:508:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:2001  is  estimated  to  be  26.2  percent  while  the  same  for  those  born  in  1945  is  14.8

29:757:53289:20:19:105:508:662:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:circumvented  by  implementing  a  policy  that  levies  a  constant  burden  rate  over  time. 
29:758:53385:19:20:105:508:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Such a policy aims at charging a high burden rate in advance so that sufficient funds can 
29:759:53475:20:19:105:508:623:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:be  accumulated  in  order  to  prepare  for  increasing  costs  in  the  future.  Feldstein  (1999) 
29:760:53576:19:19:105:508:604:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:advocated the idea of prefunding Medicare, which is the US public health insurance for 
29:761:53663:19:20:105:164:585:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the elderly.   
29:762:53678:20:19:134:508:565:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:As an example of the prefunding of health and long-term care costs, we consider 
29:763:53758:19:20:105:508:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the following policy. With regard to health insurance, a portion of the prefunding would 
29:764:53847:20:19:105:508:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:be channelized in order to finance the insurance payments dealing with health care costs 
29:765:53936:19:20:105:508:507:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with regard to the elderly (age 65 and over). Workers who are aged 15 and above make 
29:766:54021:20:19:105:508:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:payments  in  the  form  of premiums.  The  health care costs for those aged  64  and  below 
29:767:54114:19:20:105:508:468:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and  government  subsidies  in  the  form  of  benefits  to  the  elderly  are  financed  by  a 
29:768:54210:20:19:105:508:448:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:pay-as-you-go  system.  Long-term  care  insurance  employs  a  prefunding  scheme,  while 
29:769:54301:19:19:105:508:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:government  subsidies  are  financed  by  a  pay-as-you-go  system.  Since  the  enrollees  of 
29:770:54396:19:20:105:508:410:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the current system are those who are aged 40 and above, we assume that workers falling 
29:771:54483:20:19:105:294:390:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:into this age group pay these premiums.   
29:772:54525:19:20:134:508:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The setting of the interest rate is a key factor in determining the performance of a 
29:773:54610:20:19:105:508:351:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:prefunding scheme. When we focus on the proportion of burdens to income, it is not the 
29:774:54697:19:20:105:508:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:absolute levels but the difference between the interest rate and the wage growth rate that 
29:775:54788:20:19:105:508:312:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:matters.  The  MHLW  projection  on  public  pension  finance  in  May  2004  assumed  that 
29:776:54880:19:20:105:508:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the nominal interest rate would be 3.2 percent and that the growth rate of nominal wage 
29:777:54968:20:19:105:508:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:would be 2.1 percent. Our baseline case sets a 1 percentage point difference between the 
29:778:55057:19:20:105:508:254:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:interest rate and the growth rate of wage. As an alternative scenario, the difference is set 
29:779:55150:20:28:105:258:234:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:either as 0 percent or 2 percent.12

29:782:55325:18:13:105:508:174:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:security program assumed that the real rate of return is 9 percent, which is considerably 
29:783:55415:13:13:105:508:161:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:higher as compared to ours. Their following researches (Feldstein and  Samwick, 1998) 
29:784:55501:13:13:105:508:148:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:used  5.5  percent  as  the  rate  of  return,  which  is  still  higher  as  compared  to  ours.  We 
29:785:55603:13:13:105:508:135:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:employed lower interest rates due to  the following reasons. Firstly, their rates of return 
29:786:55695:13:13:105:508:122:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are based on risky capital; however, we considered the risk-free rate of return. We think 
29:787:55785:13:13:105:508:109:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that  the  investment  strategies  pertaining  to  funded  health  care  and  long-term  care 
29:788:55879:13:13:105:508:96:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:insurance  should  be  conservative  because  these  insurances  aim  to  finance  a  strictly 
29:789:55974:13:28:105:508:83:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:targeted  consumption  item  that  cannot  be  easily  substituted.  Secondly,  our  simulation

30:792:56167:19:20:105:508:682:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:pay-as-you-go  framework,  a  transition  to  a  funded  system  should  be  designed.  With 
30:793:56260:20:19:105:508:662:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:regard  to  health  care  costs,  we  first  calculate  the  contribution  rate  that  is  sufficient  for 
30:794:56367:19:20:105:508:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the entire cohort  born in FY 2001 to finance the expected  value of their lifetime health 
30:795:56458:20:19:105:508:623:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:insurance benefits beyond the age of 65 years. This rate is estimated to be 4.96 percent 
30:796:56547:19:19:105:508:604:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:under  the  governmental  projection  and  the  baseline  scenario  of  the  interest  rate.  If  the 
30:797:56649:19:20:105:508:585:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cohorts born after FY 2001 pay the premium at this rate, the total accumulated funds in 
30:798:56737:20:19:105:508:565:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:FY  2100  would  amount  to  111.11  percent  of  the  GDP.  Hence,  the  transition  process  is 
30:799:56835:19:20:105:508:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:designed  in  such  a  manner  that  it  accumulates  this  level  of  funds  with  a  constant 
30:800:56931:20:19:105:508:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:premium  rate  until  FY  2100.  Since  the current  generations  did  not  prefund  their  health 
30:801:57030:19:20:105:508:507:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:care  costs,  4.96  percent  of  the  premium  rate  is  not  sufficient  to  meet  the  target  in  FY 
30:802:57134:20:19:105:508:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:2100. It is therefore concluded that a contribution rate of 8.52 percent will successfully 
30:803:57225:19:20:105:247:468:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:accumulate the required funds.

30:808:57631:19:20:105:508:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:individuals aged 64 and below is 4.32 percent and for  those aged 65 and above is 3.89 
30:809:57718:20:19:105:508:351:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:percent.  When  a  transition  toward  a  prefunding  scheme  begins  in  FY  2005,  the 
30:810:57807:19:20:105:508:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:contribution  rate  for  the  elderly  increases  to  8.52  percent  under  the  governmental 
30:811:57901:20:19:105:508:312:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:projection  and  maintains  this  value  until  FY  2100.  Beyond  FY  2100,  the  contribution 
30:812:57997:19:20:105:508:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rate for the elderly will shrink to  4.96 percent. As against this, the contribution rate for 
30:813:58091:20:19:105:508:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the  health  care  costs  of  the  aged  below  64  is  almost  stable.  It  ranges  between  3.97

30:818:58357:19:13:105:508:148:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:process  does  not  incorporate  the  general  equilibrium  effect,  in  which  an  accumulated 
30:819:58453:13:13:105:508:135:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:social  insurance  fund  tends  to  lower  the  interest  rate  of  a  large  open  economy.  We 
30:820:58550:13:13:105:508:122:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:therefore, attempt to infer the consequences of this effect by looking at a particular case

31:845:59939:20:19:105:508:325:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:by  a  contribution  rate  of  3.95  percent  during  the  transition  process.  When  long-term 
31:846:60036:19:19:105:508:306:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:care costs (excluding government subsidies) are financed by a pay-as-you-go scheme in 
31:847:60122:19:20:105:508:287:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:FY 2004, the contribution rate is estimated to be 1.11 percent. When a transition toward 
31:848:60211:20:19:105:508:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a prefunding scheme begins in FY 2005, the contribution rate increases to 3.95 percent, 
31:849:60299:19:20:105:508:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and  maintains  this  value  until  FY  2100.  Beyond  FY  2100,  the  contribution  rate  will 
31:850:60395:20:19:105:209:228:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:shrink to 2.17 percent. 
31:851:60419:19:20:134:508:209:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:For  the  calibrated  value  in  FY  2004,  the  health  insurance  payments  for  the 
31:852:60506:20:19:105:508:189:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:nonelderly is estimated to be 4.32 percent of the total earnings and those for the elderly 
31:853:60597:19:20:105:508:170:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is estimated to be 3.89 percent of the total earnings, with the long-term care costs being 
31:854:60688:20:19:105:508:150:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimated  as  1.11  percent.  When  social  insurance  premiums  and  government  subsidies 
31:855:60781:19:20:105:508:131:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are combined, the overall burden rate becomes 12.01 percent. Under the pay-as-you-go 
31:856:60866:20:19:105:508:111:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:system, the social costs for the elderly will grow steadily. The total burden ratio will go 
31:857:60958:19:37:105:508:92:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:up to 28.12 percent of the total earnings. The burden rate of health insurance payments

32:859:61053:0:19:105:508:701:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:will go up to 9.08 percent. The growth of government subsidies however, is more rapid, 
32:860:61140:19:20:105:338:682:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the highest level attained by it being 10.07 percent. 
32:861:61194:20:19:134:508:662:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Under  the  prefunding  scheme,  it  is  estimated  that  the  burden  rate  will  increase 
32:862:61286:19:20:105:508:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from 12.01 percent in FY 2004 to 19.62 percent in FY 2005. The rate of change in total 
32:863:61373:20:19:105:508:623:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:burdens at the initial point is 63 percent. Since government subsidies are bound to grow, 
32:864:61463:19:19:105:508:604:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as in the case of the pay-as-you-go system, the highest level attained by the total burden 
32:865:61554:19:20:105:285:585:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rate will be 26.70 percent in FY 2064.   
32:866:61595:20:19:134:508:565:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 4 compares the lifetime burden rates between the balanced budget and the 
32:867:61675:19:20:105:508:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:prefunding schemes.  We should note that the burden rates for those born after 2001 do 
32:868:61762:20:19:105:508:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:not cover their whole lifetime because the simulation terminates in FY 2100. When the 
32:869:61848:19:20:105:508:507:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:system  is  changed  from  a  balanced  budget  to  a  prefunding  one,  generations  who  are 
32:870:61943:20:19:105:508:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:born  prior  to  1997  will  face  a  higher  lifetime  burden,  and  younger  generations  will 
32:871:62040:19:20:105:508:468:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:benefit from a lower lifetime burden. The curve representing lifetime burden in Figure 4 
32:872:62129:20:19:105:508:448:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:becomes flatter. Hence, a prefunding scheme helps  to reduce the inequality of burdens. 
32:873:62217:19:19:105:508:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This  will  be  made  possible  only  if  the  current  generation  agrees  to  share  burdens  with 
32:874:62318:19:20:105:193:410:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:future generations. 
32:875:62338:20:19:134:508:390:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Suzuki  (2000)  conducted  a  similar  study  dealing  with  the  calculation  of  the 
32:876:62425:19:20:105:508:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:transition  to  a  fully-funded  health  insurance  system.  While  our  calculation  unites  the 
32:877:62523:20:19:105:508:351:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:whole sector of health insurance, his calculation was based on the decomposition of the 
32:878:62611:19:20:105:508:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:same  into  subsidiary  systems  of  insurance.  The  transition  was  assumed  to  begin  in  FY 
32:879:62709:20:19:105:508:312:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1995  and  attain  the  state  of  a  fully-funded  scheme  by  FY  2100.  With  regard  to  the 
32:880:62806:19:20:105:508:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Society-managed  Health  Insurance  for  Employees  (Kumiai  Kenpo),  the  contribution 
32:881:62894:20:19:105:383:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rate is estimated to increase from 7.8 percent to 9.8 percent.   
32:882:62959:19:20:134:508:254:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:According   to   Suziki’s   specification,   a   fully-funded   scheme   finances   an 
32:883:63046:20:19:105:508:234:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:individual’s   lifetime   health   care   costs.   Before   individuals   begin   to   work,   their 
32:884:63147:19:19:105:508:215:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:pre-funding account has to borrow money. This account needs to borrow money during 
32:885:63230:19:20:105:508:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the early  stages  of an  individual’s  life. The  resulting  number  of aggregate  funds  would 
32:886:63327:20:19:105:508:176:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:still be lower than the number involved in our scheme. This is primarily the reason why 
32:887:63415:19:20:105:508:157:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:we  reported a much larger hike in the contribution rate during the transition process as 
32:888:63505:20:82:105:306:137:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:compared to that reported in Suzuki (2000).

34:891:63804:19:20:134:508:682:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Table  8  represents  the  contribution  rates  of  the  prefunding  scheme   in  FY 
34:892:63889:20:19:105:508:662:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:2005–2100 and beyond FY 2100 under 27 diverse scenarios. The assumption of a labor 
34:893:63972:19:20:105:508:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:force participation does not affect the contribution rate to a large extent. The difference 
34:894:64064:20:19:105:508:623:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in  the  health  insurance  contribution  rate  between  a  pessimistic  scenario  and  the  most 
34:895:64162:19:19:105:508:604:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:optimistic scenario is 0.36 to 0.92 percentage points. The gap between the two is large, 
34:896:64251:19:20:105:508:585:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:when  the  projection  of  social  costs  is  pessimistic.  This  reflects  the  fact  that  a  funding 
34:897:64355:20:19:105:508:565:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:scheme is not influenced by a demographic change. On the other hand, the interest rate 
34:898:64442:19:20:105:508:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:affects the contribution rate. Under the optimistic scenario (in which the interest rate is 
34:899:64534:20:19:105:508:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:2  percentage  points  higher  than  the  wage  growth  rate),  the  contribution  rate  is  1.5  to 
34:900:64635:19:20:105:508:507:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:4.68  percentage  points  lower  than  that  under  the  pessimistic  scenario.  The  setting  of 
34:901:64733:20:19:105:508:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:social  costs  has  an  even  larger  impact  on  the  contribution  rate,  as  compared  to  the 
34:902:64831:19:20:105:508:468:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:impact  of  interest  rate  on  the  same.  The  difference  in  the  contribution  rates  during  a 
34:903:64932:20:19:105:508:448:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:transition  period  between  a  pessimistic  scenario  and  an  optimistic  scenario  is  3.13  to 
34:904:65031:19:19:105:213:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:6.33 percentage points. 
34:905:65055:19:20:134:508:410:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The  above  findings  can  also  be  applied  to  the  case  of  long-term  care  insurance. 
34:906:65148:20:19:105:508:390:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The effect of interest rate is relatively large as compared to the size of the benefits. The 
34:907:65241:19:20:105:508:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:difference  in  the  contribution  rate  between  the  optimistic  and  the  pessimistic  scenario 
34:908:65340:20:19:105:325:351:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ranges between 1.08 to 3.41 percentage points.   
34:909:65389:19:20:134:508:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Even  under  the  most  optimistic  scenario,  the  burden  rate  associated  with  health 
34:910:65480:20:19:105:508:312:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:care  and  long-term  care  costs  increases  at  a  rate  of  16.05  percentage  points  from  the 
34:911:65580:19:20:105:508:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:starting  point.  The  rate  of  change  in  the  total  value  of  the  burden  rate  is  34  percent, 
34:912:65684:20:19:105:508:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:which  is  smaller  than  the  governmental  projection,  but  is  still  quite  significant.  Under 
34:913:65785:19:20:105:508:254:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the  most  pessimistic  scenario,  the  rate  of  change  is  85  percent.  Although  quantitative 
34:914:65884:20:19:105:508:234:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:implications  depend  on  the  individual  settings  associated  with  each  of  the  programs,  a

36:968:67807:20:19:105:508:662:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:baseline scenario and six alternative scenarios which in turn take an alternative scenario 
36:969:67898:19:20:105:508:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with  one  variable  among  the  three  availables.  Since  the  baseline  scenario  takes  into 
36:970:67995:20:19:105:508:623:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:account   an   intermediate   assumption   regarding   the   three   variables,   it   takes   the 
36:971:68094:19:19:105:508:604:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:centermost line of all the seven lines. The line at the highest level represents the case of 
36:972:68187:19:20:105:508:585:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the most pessimistic social cost scenario. Since the growth of social costs is assumed to 
36:973:68277:20:19:105:508:565:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:continue till the end of this century, the burden rate for future generations is far larger in 
36:974:68372:19:20:105:508:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:this scenario as compared to that in other scenarios. The lowest line represents the case 
36:975:68462:20:19:105:508:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the most optimistic social cost scenario. Social costs have the most significant impact 
36:976:68553:19:20:105:508:507:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on  the burden rate. The impact of labor force on the burden rate is the least among the 
36:977:68642:20:19:105:508:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:three  variables  considered  so  far.  Higher  interest  rates  can  reduce  the  burden  rates 
36:978:68739:19:20:105:508:468:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:considerably. For the generation born in 2001, the lifetime burden rate is estimated to be 
36:979:68830:20:19:105:508:448:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:25.62 percent under the baseline scenario and 20.15 percent under the scenario with an 
36:980:68917:19:374:105:296:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:interest rate higher by 1 percentage point.

38:984:69335:20:19:134:508:662:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:As  the  Japanese  population  structure  changes,  the  current  approach  of  financing 
38:985:69425:19:20:105:508:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(pay-as-you-go)  the  social  costs  will  create  a  large  increase  in  the  magnitude  of  future 
38:986:69527:20:19:105:508:623:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:burdens.  It  will  also  create  an  intergenerational  inequity  of  burdens.  We  analyzed  an 
38:987:69625:19:19:105:508:604:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:alternative  policy  that  prefunds  the  benefits  for  the  elderly  aged  65  and  above. 
38:988:69718:19:20:105:508:585:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Prefunding  is  not  very  popular  in  Japan.  Our  analysis  aims  at  providing  real  life 
38:989:69813:20:19:105:461:565:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:scenarios with regard to this policy option and to stimulate policy discussions. 
38:990:69894:19:20:134:508:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:During  the  transition  process  until  FY  2100,  the  scheme  maintains  a  higher 
38:991:69980:20:19:105:508:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:contribution rate in order to accumulate sufficient funds. With respect to the parameters 
38:992:70070:19:20:105:508:507:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:implied by the governmental projection, the sum of the contribution rates with regard to 
38:993:70159:20:19:105:508:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:health  insurance  and  long-term  care  insurance  increases  from  5.00  percent  of  the  total 
38:994:70258:19:20:105:508:468:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:earnings  to  12.47  percent  of  the  same.  The  rate  of  increase  in  total  burdens  including 
38:995:70359:20:19:105:260:448:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:taxes for subsidies is 63 percent.   
38:996:70396:19:19:134:508:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Our sensitivity analysis has indicated that quantitative implications depend on the 
38:997:70480:19:20:105:508:410:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:settings  of  the  social  costs,  the  labor  force,  and  the  interest  rate.  However,  labor  force 
38:998:70585:20:19:105:508:390:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:scenarios  do  not  have  a  considerable  impact  on  the  rate  of  burden.  As  against  this,  the 
38:999:70688:19:20:105:508:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:setting  of  social  costs  has  a  significant  impact.  Although  we  cannot  predict  the  exact 
38:1000:70788:20:19:105:508:351:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:amount of the necessary contribution rate that would be sufficient to transfer the funded 
38:1001:70878:19:20:105:508:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:system, it is certain that a significant increase in the contribution rate is inevitable. Even 
38:1002:70973:20:19:105:508:312:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:under the most optimistic scenario  of the 27 possible scenarios, a necessary increase in 
38:1003:71063:19:20:105:508:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the contribution rates of the two social insurances is 3.91 percentage points. The rate of 
38:1004:71154:20:19:105:352:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:increase in the total amount of burdens is 34 percent.   
38:1005:71211:19:20:134:508:254:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Implementing  a  prefunding  social  cost  program  may  be  a  challenge  because  the 
38:1006:71299:20:19:105:508:234:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:initial   increase   in   burdens   is   politically   unfavorable.   However,   the   cost   of   not 
38:1007:71402:19:19:105:508:215:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:introducing  this  scheme  implies  a  heavier  burden  on  future  generations.  Raising  the 
38:1008:71497:19:20:105:508:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:contribution  rate  in  an  aggressive  manner  will  help  to  reduce  the  intergenerational
