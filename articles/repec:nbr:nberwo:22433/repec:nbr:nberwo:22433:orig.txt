2:31:1689:28:14:72:543:588:12:Times:12:Times:We  document  how  demand  shocks  in  export  markets  lead  French  multi-product  exporters  to  re-
2:32:1792:14:14:72:545:574:12:Times:12:Times:allocate the  mix  of  products  sold  in  those  destinations.  In  response  to  positive  demand  shocks, 
2:33:1900:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:those  French firms  skew  their  export  sales  towards  their  best  performing  products;  and  also 
2:34:2003:14:14:71:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:extend the range of products sold to that market. We develop a theoretical model of multi-product 
2:35:2100:14:14:71:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:firms   and   derive   the specific   demand   conditions   needed   to   generate   these   product-mix 
2:36:2204:14:14:71:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:reallocations.  These  demand  conditions are  associated  with  endogenous  price  elasticities  that 
2:37:2306:14:14:72:546:504:12:Times:12:Times:satisfy  Marshall's  Second  Law  of  Demand  (the price  elasticity  of  demand  decreases  with 
2:38:2403:14:14:71:545:490:12:Times:12:Times:consumption).   Under   these   demand   conditions,   our   theoretical model   highlights   how   the 
2:39:2506:14:14:71:545:476:12:Times:12:Times:increased  competition  from  demand  shocks  in  export  markets  –  and  the  induced product  mix 
2:40:2606:14:14:71:545:462:12:Times:12:Times:reallocations  –  induce  productivity  changes  within  the  firm.  We  then  empirically  test for  this 
2:41:2712:14:14:71:545:448:12:Times:12:Times:connection between the demand shocks and the productivity of multi-product firms exporting to 
2:42:2805:14:14:72:545:434:12:Times:12:g_d0_f1:those destinations. We find that the effect of those demand shocks on productivity are substantial 
2:43:2903:14:28:72:542:420:12:Times:12:Times:– and explain an important share of aggregate productivity fluctuations for French manufacturing.

3:68:3462:0:32:72:166:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:1  Introduction
3:69:3477:32:20:72:540:677:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Recent studies using detailed micro-level datasets on firms, plants, and the products they produce
3:70:3575:20:20:72:540:657:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:have documented vast differences in all measurable performance metrics across those different units.
3:71:3675:20:21:72:540:637:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Those studies have also documented that these performance differences are systematically related to
3:72:3774:21:20:72:540:616:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:participation in international markets (see, e.g., Bernard, Jensen, Redding and Schott (2007, 2012)
3:73:3873:20:20:72:540:596:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:for the U.S., and Mayer and Ottaviano (2008) for Europe):  Exporting firms and plants are bigger,
3:74:3970:20:21:72:540:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:more productive, more profitable, and less likely to exit than non-exporters.  And better performing
3:75:4070:21:20:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:firms and plants export a larger number of products to a larger number of destinations.  Exporters
3:76:4168:20:20:72:540:535:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:are larger in terms of employment, output, revenue and profit.  Similar patterns also emerge across
3:77:4267:20:20:72:540:515:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the set of products sold by multi-product firms.  There is a stable performance ranking for firms
3:78:4364:20:21:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:based  on  the  products’  performance  in  any  given  market,  or  in  worldwide  sales.   Thus,  better
3:79:4470:21:20:72:540:474:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:performing products in one market are most likely to be the better performing products in any
3:80:4563:20:20:72:540:454:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:other market (including the global export market).  This also applies to the products’ selection into
3:81:4664:20:21:72:492:434:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:a destination, so better performing products are also sold in a larger set of destinations.
3:82:4755:21:20:88:539:413:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Given  this  heterogeneity,  trade  shocks  induce  many  different  reallocations  across  firms  and
3:83:4857:20:20:72:540:393:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:products. Some of these reallocations are driven by ‘selection effects’ that determine which products
3:84:4958:20:21:72:540:373:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:are sold where (across domestic and export markets), along with firm entry/exit decisions (into/out
3:85:5057:21:20:72:540:352:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of any given export market, or overall entry/exit of the firm).  Other reallocations are driven by
3:86:5155:20:20:72:540:332:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:‘skewness effects’ whereby – conditional on selection (a given set of products sold in a given market)
3:87:5257:20:21:72:540:312:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:– trade affects the relative market shares of those products.  Both types of reallocations generate
3:88:5356:21:20:72:540:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(endogenous) productivity changes that are independent of ‘technology’ (the production function
3:89:5451:20:20:72:512:271:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:at the product-level).  This creates an additional channel for the aggregate gains from trade.
3:90:5545:20:21:88:539:251:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Unfortunately,  measuring  the  direct  impact  of  trade  on  those  reallocations  across  firms  is  a
3:91:5650:21:20:72:540:230:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:very  hard  task.   On  one  hand,  shocks  that  affect  trade  are  also  likely  to  affect  the  distribution
3:92:5763:20:20:72:540:210:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of  market  shares  across  firms.   On  the  other  hand,  changes  in  market  shares  across  firms  likely
3:93:5873:20:21:72:540:190:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:reflect  many  technological  factors  (not  related  to  reallocations).   Looking  at  reallocations  across
3:94:5983:21:20:72:540:169:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:products within firms obviates many of these problems.  Recent theoretical models of multi-product
3:95:6081:20:20:72:540:149:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:firms highlight how trade induces a similar pattern of reallocations within firms as it does across
3:96:6180:20:21:72:540:129:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:firms.   And  measuring  reallocations  within  multi-product  firms  has  several  advantages:   Trade
3:97:6283:21:20:72:540:108:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:shocks that are exogenous to individual firms can be identified much more easily than at a higher
3:98:6380:20:0:72:540:88:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:level of aggregation;  Controls for any technology changes at the firm-level are also possible;  and
4:99:6481:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:reallocations  can  be  measured  for  the  same  set  of  narrowly  defined  products  sold  by  the  same
4:100:6588:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:firm across destinations or over time.  In addition, impediments to factor reallocations are likely
4:101:6687:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to be substantially higher across firms than across product lines within firms.  Moreover,  multi-
4:102:6785:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:product  firms  dominate  world  production  and  trade  flows.   Hence,  reallocations  within  multi-
4:103:6888:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:product firms have the potential to generate large changes in aggregate productivity.  Empirically,
4:104:6987:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:we find very strong evidence for the effects of trade shocks on those reallocations, and ultimately
4:105:7086:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:on the productivity of multi-product firms.  The overall impact on aggregate French manufacturing
4:106:7183:21:20:72:200:566:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:productivity is substantial.
4:107:7211:20:20:88:539:546:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The  rest  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows.   Section  2  briefly  surveys  the  recent  empirical
4:108:7320:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:literature  on  trade-induced  reallocations.   Section  3  introduces  our  dataset  on  French  exporters
4:109:7427:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and provides novel evidence on such reallocations with a special emphasis on skewness effects.  It
4:110:7525:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:shows  that  positive  demand  shocks  in  any  given  destination  market  induce  French  exporters  to
4:111:7630:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:skew their product level export sales to that destination towards their best performing products.
4:112:7727:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:These  demand  shocks  also  lead  to  strong  positive  responses  in  both  the  intensive  and  extensive
4:113:7835:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:margins of export sales to that destination.  Section 4 introduces a flexible theoretical framework
4:114:7934:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:with multi-product firms to rationalize all this empirical evidence.  Our framework highlights how
4:115:8032:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:certain properties of demand – which relate to the curvature of the demand and marginal revenue
4:116:8127:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:curves – are crucial in generating predictions for reallocations that are consistent with the data.
4:117:8226:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:In particular, these empirically relevant properties rule out the case of constant elasticity demand.
4:118:8327:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:They also imply that positive demand shocks engender increases in multi-product firm productivity
4:119:8424:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:since  those  shocks  induce  firms  to  produce  relatively  more  of  their  better  performing  products
4:120:8531:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(the  skewness  effect).   Sections  5  and  6  take  these  predictions  to  the  data  and  measure  large
4:121:8639:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:responses in multi-product firm productivity to demand shocks in export markets.  We find that
4:122:8733:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:these productivity responses explain an important share of aggregate productivity fluctuations for
4:123:8831:20:37:72:180:221:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:French manufacturing.

4:125:8903:31:21:72:540:153:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:In a previous paper, Mayer, Melitz and Ottaviano (2014), we investigated, both theoretically and
4:126:8999:21:20:72:540:132:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:empirically, the mechanics of product reallocations within multi-product firms across export desti-
4:127:9098:20:20:72:540:112:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:nation markets. We used comprehensive firm-level data on annual shipments by all French exporters
4:128:9195:20:20:72:540:92:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to all countries in the world (not including the French domestic market) for a set of more than
4:129:9290:20:0:72:540:72:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:10,000 goods.  Firm-level exports are collected by French customs and include export sales for each
5:130:9390:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:8-digit (combined nomenclature or NC8) product by destination country.  Our focus then was on
5:131:9483:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the cross-section of firm-product exports across destinations (for a single year, 2003).  We presented
5:132:9585:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:evidence that French multi-product firms indeed exhibit a stable ranking of products in terms of
5:133:9681:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:their shares of export sales across export destinations with ‘core’ products being sold in a larger
5:134:9780:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:number of destinations (and commanding larger market shares across destinations).  We used the
5:135:9874:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:term ‘skewness’ to refer to the concentration of these export market shares in any destination and
5:136:9972:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:showed  that  this  skewness  consistently  varied  with  destination  characteristics  such  as  GDP  and
5:137:10078:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:geography:  French  firms  sold  relatively  more  of  their  best  performing  products  in  bigger,  more
5:138:10185:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:centrally-located destinations (where competition from other exporters and domestic producers is
5:139:10281:20:21:72:116:526:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:tougher).
5:140:10290:21:20:88:539:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Other  research  has  also  documented  similar  patterns  of  product  reallocations  (within  multi-
5:141:10392:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:product firms) over time following trade liberalization.  For the case of CUSFTA/NAFTA, Baldwin
5:142:10487:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and Gu (2009), Bernard, Redding and Schott (2011), and Iacovone and Javorcik (2010) all report
5:143:10581:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:that Canadian, U.S., and Mexican multi-product firms reduced the number of products they pro-
5:144:10674:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:duce during these trade-liberalization episodes.  Baldwin and Gu (2009) and Bernard, Redding and
5:145:10770:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Schott (2011) further report that CUSFTA induced a significant increase in the skewness of pro-
5:146:10865:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:duction across products.  Iacovone and Javorcik (2010) separately measure the skewness of Mexican
5:147:10962:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:firms’ export sales to the US. They report an increase in this skewness following NAFTA: They
5:148:11055:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:show that Mexican firms expanded their exports of their better performing products (higher mar-
5:149:11150:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:ket shares) significantly more than those for their worse performing exported products during the
5:150:11247:20:20:72:283:302:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:period of trade expansion from 1994−2003.
5:151:11288:20:21:88:539:282:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:As prices are rarely observed, there is little direct evidence on how markups, prices and costs
5:152:11383:21:20:71:539:261:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:are  related  across  products  supplied  with  different  productivity,  and  how  they  respond  to  trade
5:153:11491:20:20:71:539:241:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:liberalization.1A  notable  exception  is  the  recent  paper  by  De  Loecker,  Goldberg,  Pavcnik  and
5:154:11595:20:21:71:539:221:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Khandelwal (2016) who exploit unique information on the prices and quantities of Indian firms’
5:155:11689:21:20:71:539:200:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:products over India’s trade liberalization period from 1989−2003.  They also document that better
5:156:11786:20:20:71:539:180:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:performing firms (higher sales and productivity) produce more products,  before focusing on the
5:157:11881:20:21:71:539:160:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:evidence for firm and product level markups.  Across firms, they show that those better performing
5:158:11979:21:20:71:539:139:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:firms also set higher markups.  They also document a similar pattern across the products produced
5:159:12076:20:16:71:539:119:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:by  a  given  multi-product  firm,  which  sets  relatively  higher  markups  on  their  better  performing
5:160:12183:16:0:84:539:103:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:1Prices are typically backed-out as unit values based on reported quantity information, which is extremely noisy.
6:161:12297:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:products (lower marginal cost and higher market shares).2In addition, they show strong evidence
6:162:12392:21:20:71:539:688:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:for endogenous markup adjustments via imperfect pass-through from products’ marginal costs to
6:163:12485:20:20:71:539:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:their prices:  Only a portion of marginal cost decreases are passed on to consumers in the form of
6:164:12583:20:21:71:539:648:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:lower prices, while the remaining portion goes to higher markups.  This is consistent with recent
6:165:12680:21:20:71:539:627:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:firm-level evidence on exchange rate pass-through.  Berman, Martin and Mayer (2012) analyze the
6:166:12775:20:20:71:539:607:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:heterogeneous reaction of French exporters to real exchange rate changes across destinations over
6:167:12872:20:21:71:539:587:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:a decade (1995−2005).  They find that on average firms react to depreciation by increasing their
6:168:12968:21:20:71:539:566:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:markup.  They also find that high-performance firms increases their markup significantly more –
6:169:13063:20:20:71:478:546:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:implying that the pass-through rate is significantly lower for better performing firms.
6:170:13150:20:21:88:539:526:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Berman, Martin and Mayer (2012) also find very strong evidence that this pass-through rate
6:171:13240:21:20:71:539:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(the elasticity of price with respect to the exchange rate) is heterogeneous across firms:  it sharply
6:172:13342:20:20:71:539:485:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:decreases with firm performance (better performing firms adjust their markups substantially more
6:173:13438:20:21:71:539:465:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:than worse performing firms in response to the same exchange rate shock).  Li, Ma and Xu (2015)
6:174:13533:21:20:71:539:444:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:confirm this result of decreasing pass-through (with firm performance) for Chinese exporters. Amiti,
6:175:13633:20:20:71:539:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Itskoki, and Konings (2014) also find a very similar result for Belgian firms, whereby pass-through
6:176:13732:20:21:71:539:404:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:is strongly decreasing with the Belgian firms’ export market share.  Chatterjee, Dix-Carneiro, and
6:177:13830:21:20:71:539:383:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Vichyanond (2013) also show this pattern for Brazilian exporters.  In addition, they find that this
6:178:13929:20:20:71:539:363:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:property of decreasing pass-through also holds within multi-product Brazilian firms across their set
6:179:14029:20:21:71:539:343:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of exported products.  That is, they find substantially lower pass-through rates for a firm’s better
6:180:14129:21:20:71:356:322:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:performing products (with relatively higher market shares).
6:181:14188:20:20:88:539:302:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:This evidence on prices, markups, and pass-through is directly related to properties of demand
6:182:14282:20:21:71:539:282:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(such as its elasticity).  We review those connections when we introduce our theoretical model and
6:183:14380:21:20:71:539:261:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:its demand properties.  We will then show that the same demand properties are required to generate
6:184:14478:20:20:71:539:241:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the product reallocations that we document in the following section.  This provides an independent
6:185:14576:20:38:71:402:221:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:source of confirmation for the evidence based on product-level prices.
6:186:14646:38:31:71:237:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:3  Reallocations Over Time
6:187:14672:31:20:71:540:152:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We now document how changeswithina destination market over time induce a similar pattern of
6:188:14763:20:20:71:539:132:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:reallocations as the ones we previously described (holding across destinations).  More specifically,
6:189:14863:20:16:71:539:112:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:we show that demand shocks in any given destination market induce firms to skew their product
6:190:14956:16:15:84:539:96:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:2Using product-level prices for multi-product firms, Dhyne et al (2016) also document a strong correlation between
6:191:15070:15:0:72:246:81:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:a product’s sales rank and its productivity.
7:192:15115:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:level  export  sales  to  that  destination  towards  their  best  performing  products.   In  terms  of  first
7:193:15226:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:moments,  we  show  that  these  demand  shocks  also  lead  to  strong  positive  responses  in  both  the
7:194:15333:20:36:72:392:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:intensive and extensive margins of export sales to that destination.
7:195:15401:36:27:72:127:632:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:3.1  Data
7:196:15410:27:20:72:540:605:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We  use  the  same  data  source  for  firm  exports  (described  in  Section  2)  as  Mayer,  Melitz  and
7:197:15516:20:21:72:540:585:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Ottaviano  (2014),  extended  to  cover  multiple  years  from  1995-2005.   All  firms  operating  in  the
7:198:15623:21:20:72:540:564:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:French  metropolitan  territory  must  report  their  export  sales  according  to  the  following  criteria:
7:199:15732:20:20:72:539:544:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Exports to each EU destination whenever within-EU exports exceeds 100,000 Euros;3and exports
7:200:15824:20:21:72:540:524:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to non-EU country whenever exports to that destination exceeds 1,000 Euros or a ton.  Despite
7:201:15917:21:20:72:540:503:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:these limitations, the database is nearly comprehensive.  For instance, in 2005, 103,220 firms report
7:202:16018:20:20:72:540:483:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:exports across 234 destination countries (or territories) for 9873 products.  This represents data on
7:203:16119:20:21:72:200:463:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:over 2.2 million shipments.
7:204:16146:21:20:88:539:442:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We restrict our analysis to firms whose main activity is classified as manufacturing to ensure
7:205:16240:20:20:72:540:422:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:that firms take part in the production of the goods they export.4This leaves us with data covering
7:206:16338:20:21:72:423:402:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f6:more than a million shipments by firms across all manufacturing sectors.5
7:207:16411:21:20:88:539:381:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Matched balance-sheet data provide us with information on variables that are needed to assess
7:208:16504:20:20:71:539:361:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:firm productivity such as turnover,  value added,  employment,  investment,  raw material use and
7:209:16601:20:21:71:539:341:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:capital.  However, we can only measure product reallocations in terms of sales in export markets
7:210:16697:21:20:71:539:320:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:as  the  breakdown  of  sales  across  products  for  the  domestic  market  is  not  available  to  us.   We
7:211:16806:20:20:71:539:300:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:will have to take this into account in designing our estimation strategy.  The balance-sheet data
7:212:16903:20:21:71:539:280:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:we  have  access  to  comes  in  two  sources  where  the  official  identification  number  of  the  firm  can
7:213:17014:21:20:71:539:259:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:be  matched  with  customs  information.   The  first  source  is  the  EAE,  produced  by  the  national
7:214:17119:20:20:71:539:239:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:statistical institute, and exhaustive for manufacturing firms with size exceeding 20 employees.  The
7:215:17219:20:21:71:539:219:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:second is BRN, which comes from tax authorities, and includes a broader coverage of firms, since it
7:216:17318:21:15:71:539:198:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:is based on the firm’s legal tax regime and a relatively low sales threshold.  Whenever firm data is
7:217:17418:15:15:84:539:183:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:3If this threshold is not met,  firms can choose to report under a simplified scheme without supplying separate
7:218:17529:15:11:72:540:168:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:EU export destinations.  However, in practice, many firms under the threshold report their exports by destination.
7:219:17643:11:11:72:540:157:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:During our sample period, the threshold increased from 38,050 Euros (250,000 French Francs) to 100,000 Euros in
7:220:17754:11:11:72:540:146:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:2001.  We have checked that all our results are robust to using only the 1996-2001 subsample (a sample period that
7:221:17868:11:7:72:428:135:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:also features a more stable product classification schedule; See Pierce and Schott, 2012).
7:222:17958:7:11:84:530:128:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:4Some large distributors such as Carrefour account for a disproportionate number of annual export shipments.
7:223:18066:11:15:84:539:117:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:5In a robustness check, we also drop observations for firms that report an affiliate abroad.  This avoids the issue
7:224:18181:15:11:72:540:102:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:that multinational firms may substitute exports of some of their best performing products with affiliate production in
7:225:18299:11:11:72:540:91:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:the destination country (affecting our measurement of product reallocations).  Results are quantitatively very similar
7:226:18417:11:0:72:141:80:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:in all regressions.
8:227:18437:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:available from both sources, we give precedence to the EAE data (which is more closely monitored
8:228:18533:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:by the statistical authorities).6Table 1 provides some descriptive statistics relevant to the match
8:229:18632:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:between customs and balance sheet data.  The overall match is not perfect but covers between 88
8:230:18727:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and 95 percent of the total value of French exports.  The match with firms declaring manufacturing
8:231:18825:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:as their main activity is still very good although there is a clear trend of declining quality of match,
8:232:18929:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:particularly after 2000.  This is also visible in the aggregate growth rate of exports in our sample
8:233:19029:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(column 5) that overall provide a quite good match of the overall exports growth rate in column
8:234:19124:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(4), but deteriorating over time.  Our investigations suggest that the increasing propensity of large

9:268:21492:20:37:72:353:580:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:shipment data to construct a firmi-specific demand shock:

9:272:21825:21:20:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:aggregation is the HS-6 level (from UN-COMTRADE and CEPII-BACI)8, which is more aggregated
9:273:21915:20:20:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:than our NC8 classification for French exports (roughly 5,300 HS products per year versus 10,000
9:274:22011:20:21:72:540:425:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:NC8 products per year).  The construction of the last trade shock is very similar to the one for

9:277:22299:20:21:71:539:364:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:firm, we use the set of products exported by the firm in its first export year in our sample (1995,
9:278:22398:21:20:71:539:343:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:or later if the firm starts exporting later on in our sample), and then exclude this year from our
9:279:22496:20:20:71:539:323:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:subsequent analysis.  Note that we use an un-weighted average so that the shocks for all exported
9:280:22593:20:21:71:396:303:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f6:productss(within an industryI) are represented proportionately.10
9:281:22658:21:20:88:540:282:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:For all of these demand shocksXt= GDPd,t,MId,t,Msd,t, we compute the first difference as the
9:282:22750:20:20:71:539:262:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Davis-Haltiwanger growth rate: ̃∆Xt≡(Xt−Xt−1)/(.5Xt+.5Xt−1).  This measure of the first
9:283:22837:20:21:71:539:242:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:difference preserves observations when the shock switches from 0 to a positive number, and has a
9:284:22933:21:20:71:540:221:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:maximum growth rate of−2 or 2.  This is mostly relevant for our measure of the firm-specific trade
9:285:23031:20:20:71:540:201:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:shock, where the product-level imports intod,Msd,tcan often switch between 0 and positive values.

9:287:23217:16:11:84:218:165:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:8See Gaulier and Zignago (2010).
9:288:23249:11:15:84:539:154:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:9There is a one-to-many matching between the NC8 and HS6 product classifications,  so every NC8 product is
9:289:23355:15:11:72:540:139:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:assigned  a  unique  HS6  classification.   We  use  the  sameMsd,tdata  for  any  NC8  productswithin  the  same  HS6

9:291:23488:7:15:80:539:121:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:10Thus,  positive  idiosyncratic  demand  shocks  to  high  market-share  products  (which  mechanically  contribute  to
9:292:23608:15:11:71:539:106:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:increase  the skewness of  product  sales)  are given  the  same  weight as  positive  idiosyncratic  shocks  to low  market-
9:293:23733:11:11:71:539:95:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:share products (which mechanically contribute to decrease the skewness of product sales); and vice-versa for negative
9:294:23850:11:0:71:100:84:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:shocks.
10:295:23858:0:18:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:rates (|∆ logXt|<2).11We thus obtain our three measures of demand shocks in first differences:
10:296:23952:18:23:73:539:691:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4: ̃∆GDPd,t, ̃∆MId,t, ̃∆Msd,t.  From here on out, we refer to these three shocks, respectively, as GDP
10:297:24052:23:20:71:539:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:shock, trade shock – ISIC, and trade shock.  Note that this last firm-level shock, ̃∆Msd,t, represents
10:298:24154:20:36:72:503:648:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the un-weighted average of the growth rates for all products exported by the firm int−1.

10:300:24304:27:21:72:540:585:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Before focusing on the effects of the demand shocks on the skewness of export sales, we first show

10:302:24498:20:20:72:540:544:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:moments of the distribution of product export sales).  Table 2 reports how our three demand shocks
10:303:24596:20:21:72:540:524:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(in first differences) affect changes in firm exports to destinationdin ISICI(so each observation
10:304:24693:21:20:72:540:503:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:represents a firm-destination-ISIC combination).  We decompose the firm’s export response to each
10:305:24790:20:20:72:540:483:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:shock into an intensive margin (average exports per product) and an extensive margin (number of
10:306:24885:20:21:72:540:463:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:exported products).  We clearly see how all three demand shocks induce very strong (and highly
10:307:24979:21:20:72:540:442:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:significant) positive responses for both margins.  This confirms that our demand shocks capture
10:308:25074:20:32:72:396:422:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f6:important changes in the local demand faced by French exporters.12

10:323:25836:15:7:72:337:151:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:trade shock average) does not materially affect any of our results.
10:324:25903:7:15:80:539:144:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:12Specifications using the log levels of the shocks and firm-destination-ISIC fixed-effects yield similar results.  Other
10:325:26024:15:11:72:540:129:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:specifications  including  the  three  covariates  show  that  those  demand  shocks  are  different  enough  to  be  estimated
10:326:26151:11:11:72:540:118:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:jointly while each keeping its positive sign and statistical significance.  We also have experimented with the addition
10:327:26270:11:11:72:540:107:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:of a control for a worldwide shock (aggregated from the destination-specific shocks using the firm’s prior year export
10:328:26388:11:11:72:540:96:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:shares).  The effect of this additional control on the destination-specific coefficient is negligible, thus confirming that
10:329:26511:11:0:72:359:85:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:worldwide shocks do not influence the coefficients presented in Table 2.
11:330:26584:0:21:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We now investigate the consequences of those demand shocks for the skewness of export sales
11:331:26675:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(independent of the level of product sales).  In Mayer, Melitz and Ottaviano (2014), we focused on
11:332:26773:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:those effects in the cross-section across destinations.  Here, we examine the response of skewness
11:333:26871:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:within a destination over time using our new demand shocks.  We rely on the Theil index as our

11:363:27951:21:20:71:539:390:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:rate in our demand shocks over time.  Across all three specifications, we see that positive demand
11:364:28049:20:20:71:539:370:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:shocks induce a highly significant increase in the skewness of firm export sales to a destination.

11:366:28250:21:20:71:539:329:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:most-demanding FD-FE specification.  To highlight this effect, we re-run our FD-FE specification

11:368:28455:20:21:71:539:289:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:4.  Each row is the result of that independent regression with each shock.  In this case, even the

14:468:33038:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:from Table 4 on the restricted subset of products that are exported in botht−1 andt(denoted

14:470:33226:21:20:71:539:627:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:in the first 4 columns of Table 5.  In column 5,  we introduce one last skewness measure for the

14:472:33433:20:21:71:539:587:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(in terms of global export sales).  The effect of our firm-level trade shock is significant across all
14:473:33535:21:20:71:539:566:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:these specifications (and significant well beyond the 1% level for all the distribution wide skewness

14:476:33816:38:31:71:228:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:4  Theoretical Framework
14:477:33840:31:20:71:539:457:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:In the previous section we documented the pattern of product reallocations in response to demand
14:478:33936:20:21:71:539:437:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:shocks in export markets. We now develop a theoretical model of multi-product firms that highlights
14:479:34035:21:20:71:539:416:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the  specific  demand  conditions  needed  to  generate  this  pattern.   We  show  that  these  demand
14:480:34138:20:20:71:539:396:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:conditions  are  consistent  with  all  of  the  micro-level  evidence  on  firm/product  selections,  prices,
14:481:34248:20:20:71:539:376:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and markups presented in section 2.  In particular, those demand conditions highlight how demand
14:482:34344:20:21:71:539:356:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:shocks lead to changes in competition for exporters in those markets (which lead to the observed
14:483:34440:21:20:71:539:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:reallocations).   Those  reallocations,  in  turn,  generate  changes  in  firm  productivity.   We  directly
14:484:34549:20:20:71:539:315:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:investigate  the  empirical  connection  between  demand  shocks  and  productivity  in  the  following
14:485:34652:20:21:71:111:295:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:sections.
14:486:34661:21:20:88:539:274:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Our theoretical model contributes to the growing literature emphasizing demand systems with
14:487:34752:20:20:71:539:254:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:variable price elasticities for models of trade.15Our main point of departure relative to those papers
14:488:34854:20:21:71:539:234:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:is that we seek to connect the demand conditions on variable elasticities (and further properties
14:489:34951:21:20:71:539:213:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of  demand)  directly  to  the  evidence  on  the  product  reallocations  that  we  document;  and  our
14:490:35055:20:20:71:539:193:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:additional goal of empirically connecting those to firm-level productivity.  In this spirit, our paper
14:491:35157:20:21:71:539:173:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:is most closely related to Arkolakis et al (2015) and Asplund and Nocke (2006), who also directly
14:492:35254:21:20:71:539:152:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:connect their theoretical modeling of endogenous markups with empirical moments:  Arkolakis et
14:493:35348:20:20:71:539:132:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:al (2015) focus on the implications for the welfare gains from trade; and Asplund and Nocke (2006)
14:494:35446:20:16:71:379:112:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:focus on the implications for firm turnover in a dynamic setting.

15:498:35689:28:20:72:540:681:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:To better highlight the role played by the properties of the demand system, we initially start with
15:499:35788:20:20:72:540:661:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:a  closed  economy  and  analyze  the  impact  of  demand  shocks  on  product  reallocations.   We  then
15:500:35893:20:21:72:540:641:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:develop an open economy version of our model that meshes more closely with our empirical setup.
15:501:35988:21:20:72:540:620:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We show how demand shocks in an export market induce very similar product reallocations as in
15:502:36081:20:20:72:540:600:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the  closed  economy  (but  for  exporters  to  that  market).   We  develop  both  a  general  equilibrium
15:503:36188:20:21:72:540:580:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(with a single differentiated good sector for the whole economy) and a partial equilibrium version
15:504:36286:21:20:72:540:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:focusing on a single sector among many in the economy.  In the latter, we also introduce a short-run
15:505:36386:20:20:72:540:539:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:version where entry is restricted general equilibrium is inherently a long-run scenario).  We show
15:506:36484:20:21:72:540:519:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:how demand shocks induce the same skewness pattern in all of these modeling alternatives.  This
15:507:36579:21:35:72:493:498:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:highlights the critical role of the demand system in shaping the pattern of reallocations.

15:509:36725:28:20:72:540:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We  consider  a  sector  with  a  single  productive  factor,  labor.   We  will  distinguish  between  two
15:510:36832:20:20:72:540:415:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:scenarios.   The  first  is  the  standard  general  equilibrium  (GE)  setup  with  a  single  sector.   The
15:511:36941:20:21:72:540:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:exogenous labor endowmentLindexes both the number of workersLw(with inelastic supply) and
15:512:37030:21:20:72:540:374:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:consumersLc.   We  choose  the  endogenous  wage  as  thenumeraire.   Aggregate  expenditures  are
15:513:37128:20:20:72:540:354:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:then given by the exogenous labor endowment.  In our partial equilibrium (PE) scenario, we focus
15:514:37224:20:21:72:539:334:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:on  the  sector  as  a  small  part  of  the  economy.   We  take  the  number  of  consumersLcas  well  as
15:515:37331:21:20:71:539:313:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:their  individual  expenditures  on  the  sector’s  output  as  exogenously  given.   The  supply  of  labor
15:516:37439:20:20:71:540:293:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f4:Lwto  the  sector  is  perfectly  elastic  at  an  exogenous  economy-wide  wage.   We  choose  units  so
15:517:37544:20:21:71:539:273:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:that both this wage and the exogenous expenditure per-consumer is equal to 1.  This involves a

15:519:37729:20:20:72:540:232:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:accounting then implies that this normalized number of consumersLcrepresents a fraction of the
15:520:37823:20:21:72:539:212:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:labor endowmentL.16In both scenarios, we model a demand shock as an increase in the number of
15:521:37916:21:20:72:539:191:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:consumersLc.  This increases aggregate expenditures one-for-one, given our assumptions of unitary
15:522:38013:20:16:72:540:171:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:consumer income.  In our GE scenario, this increase is associated with a proportional increase in
15:523:38110:16:15:80:539:155:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:16As  we  will  restrict  our  analysis  to  additively  separable  preferences  –  which  are  non-homothetic  –  changes  in
15:524:38236:15:11:72:540:140:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:consumer income will have different effects than changes in the number of consumersLc.  We focus on this functional
15:525:38351:11:11:72:540:129:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:form  for  tractability  and  do  not  wish  to  emphasize  its  properties  for  income  elasticities.   As  first  highlighted  by
15:526:38483:11:10:72:540:118:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:Deaton and Muellbauer (1980), additively separable preference imply a specific relationship between price and income
15:527:38599:10:11:72:540:108:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:elasticities.   We  emphasize  the  properties  of  demand  for  those  price  elasticities.   Thus,  we  analyze  changes  in  the
15:528:38730:11:11:72:539:97:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:number of consumersLcholding their income fixed.  This is akin to indexing the preferences to a given reference

16:530:38856:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:labor suppliedLw.  In our PE scenario, the labor supply response is left unrestricted, isolating the

16:532:38976:20:20:88:539:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:In both scenarios each consumer’s utility is assumed to be additively separable over a continuum

17:601:43272:7:15:80:540:102:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:19As we have assumed that any firm’s set of product is of measure zero relative to the set of available productsM,

20:706:47342:35:28:71:165:592:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:Short-Run Scenario
20:707:47360:28:17:71:539:564:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We now consider an alternative short-run situation in which the number of incumbents is fixed at

20:709:47552:23:21:71:539:524:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:case, free entry (12) no longer holds:  firms with core competencies below the profit cutoff in (11)

20:711:47750:20:20:71:539:483:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the  exogenous  number  of  incumbents ̄Nnow  replacing  the  endogenous  number  of  entrantsNe.
20:712:47847:20:21:71:539:463:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Together with the zero cutoff profit (11), those two conditions jointly determine the endogenous

20:714:47980:20:20:88:540:422:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:As was the case in the long-run scenarios with free-entry, an increase in demandLcmust lead
20:715:48071:20:21:71:540:402:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to  an  increase  in  competitionλ.22However,  the  response  of  the  cutoffs  is  now  unambiguous:
20:716:48172:21:20:71:539:381:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the  increase  in  demand  must  raise  profits  for  all  products  (given  their  costv)  since  there  is  no
20:717:48284:20:20:71:539:361:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:induced response in entry; leading to an increase in the cutoffs ˆv= ˆc.23In this short-run scenario,
20:718:48385:20:21:71:539:341:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:it is the production of these new varieties (previously unprofitable) that generates the increased
20:719:48483:21:20:71:539:320:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:competition.  In the long run, the increased competition is driven by the entry of new firms (and
20:720:48580:20:16:71:202:300:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the varieties they produce).
20:721:48608:16:15:80:539:284:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:20This sector-level adjustment for labor supply is very similar to the case of C.E.S. product differentiation within
20:722:48724:15:11:72:540:269:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:sectors and Cobb-Douglas preferences across sectors.  In the latter case, the sector’s labor supply adjusts so that it
20:723:48842:11:11:72:540:258:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:is equal (as a fraction of the aggregate labor endowment) to the exogenous Cobb-Douglas expenditure share for the
20:724:48955:11:7:72:464:247:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:sector.  See Melitz & Redding (2014) for an example of those preferences with firm heterogeneity.
20:725:49052:7:15:80:539:240:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:21Competitionλmust strictly increase for the free entry condition to hold.  Ifλdecreased (even weakly), then net

20:727:49272:11:11:72:540:214:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:then strictly increase (given 11);  along with the average firm profit (the left-hand-side) in the free-entry condition
20:728:49391:11:7:72:329:203:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:(12).  Thus, this condition could not hold ifλweakly decreased.
20:729:49454:7:15:80:540:196:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:22Competitionλmust  strictly  increase  in  order  to  satisfy  the  budget  constraint  (13)  with  a  fixed  number  of
20:730:49575:15:11:72:539:181:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:incumbents.   As  we  argued  in  a  previous  footnote  (21),λweakly  decreasing  would  imply  a  strict  increase  in  the
20:731:49700:11:11:72:540:170:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:cutoffs ˆv= ˆc.  This would entail both a strict increase in the number of products consumed as well as a weak increase
20:732:49819:11:11:72:540:159:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:in  expenditures  per-productr(v,λ)  for  each  consumer  (recall  thatεr,λ<0).   This  would  necessarily  violate  the
20:733:49939:11:7:72:193:148:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:consumer’s budget constraint.
20:734:49968:7:15:80:539:141:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:23Note  that  with  a  fixed  number  of  incumbents,  the  budget  constraint  (13)  implies  an  increasing  relationship
20:735:50091:15:0:72:533:126:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:between the cutoff ˆcand the level of competitionλ(which reduces product-level revenuesr(v,λ) for all products).

21:737:50224:28:20:72:540:681:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Up to now, we have placed very few restrictions on the shape of the residual demand curves that the
21:738:50323:20:20:72:540:661:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:firms face, other than the conditions (A1)-(A3) needed to ensure a unique monopolistic competition
21:739:50421:20:21:72:540:641:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:equilibrium.  In particular, the rates of change of the elasticities of residual demand and marginal
21:740:50521:21:20:72:539:620:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:revenue (the signs ofε′p(qi) andε′φ(qi)) were left unrestricted.  We now show how further restrictions
21:741:50623:20:20:71:539:600:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:on  those  rates  of  change  (or  alternatively  the  curvature  of  demand  and  marginal  revenue)  are
21:742:50729:20:21:71:539:580:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:intrinsically tied to product-level reallocations – in addition to their better known consequences
21:743:50827:21:20:71:539:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:for prices, markups and pass-through.  After we develop the open economy version of our model in
21:744:50923:20:20:71:539:539:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the next section, we highlight the reverse connection from the pattern of product reallocations we
21:745:51021:20:21:71:539:519:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:documented in Section 3 back to their necessary conditions for demand.  Throughout, we assume
21:746:51114:21:20:71:539:498:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f9:that  conditions  (A1)-(A3)  hold  in  our  monopolistic  competition  equilibrium.   Thus,  anecessary
21:747:51217:20:20:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:condition  for  an  empirical  pattern  is  anadditionalcondition  that  must  hold  (to  generate  that
21:748:51321:20:21:72:368:458:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:empirical prediction)conditionalon those initial assumptions.
21:749:51382:21:36:88:450:437:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The further restrictions on the shapes of demand and marginal revenue are:

21:754:51611:20:20:71:539:293:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:those  restrictions.   Under  (B1)  demand  becomes  more  inelastic  with  consumption.   This  is  also
21:755:51716:20:21:71:539:273:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:known as Marshall’s Second Law of Demand.24It is a necessary and sufficient condition for better
21:756:51812:21:20:71:540:252:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:performing products (lowerv) to have higher markups and for tougher competition (higherλ) to
21:757:51904:20:16:72:540:232:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:lower markups for any given product (given a costv).25Thus, the evidence discussed in Section
21:758:51997:16:15:80:539:216:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:24We  thank  Peter  Neary  for  bringing  this  reference  to  our  attention.   (B1)  is  equivalent  to  the  assumption  by
21:759:52123:15:11:72:540:201:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:Arkolakis et al (2015) that the demand function of any product is log-concave in log-prices.  In the terminology of
21:760:52238:11:11:72:540:190:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:Neary and Mrazova (2014) it defines the “sub-convex” case, with “sub-convexity” of an inverse demand function at
21:761:52350:11:11:72:540:179:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:an  arbitrary  point  being  equivalent  to  the  function  being  less  convex  at  that  point  than  a  CES  demand  function
21:762:52478:11:11:72:540:168:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:with the same elasticity.  In the terminology of Zhelobodko et al (2012), this class of preferences exhibits increasing
21:763:52597:11:11:72:540:157:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:“relative love of variety” (RLV) as consumers care more about variety when their consumption level is higher.  In the
21:764:52714:11:11:72:540:146:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:terminology of Kimball (1995), this class of preferences exhibits a positive superelasticity of demand.  Bertoletti and
21:765:52833:11:11:72:540:135:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:Epifani (2014) refer to this case as “decreasing elasticity of substitution”.  The “Adjustable pass-through” (APT) class
21:766:52953:11:11:72:540:124:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:of demand functions proposed by Fabinger and Weyl (2012) also satisfies (B1).  Lastly, condition (B1) is sufficient
21:767:53068:11:11:72:540:113:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:for the induced maximized profit function to exhibit all the properties postulated by Asplund and Nocke (2006) in
21:768:53181:11:11:72:540:102:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:order to explain the empirical relationship between market size and firm turnover that they document (in a dynamic
21:769:53295:11:7:72:105:91:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:setting).
21:770:53304:7:0:80:434:84:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:25Since both higher costvand higherλis associated with lower outputq(v,λ); See (8).
22:771:53389:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:2, linking better product and firm performance to higher markups implies that (B1) must hold.  It
22:772:53486:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:is also consistent with the estimates of Arkolakis et al (2015) for bilateral trade demand.  In our
22:773:53585:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:model with monopolistic competition, (B1) is also equivalent to an alternate condition that the pass-
22:774:53686:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:through elasticity from marginal cost to priceθ≡∂lnp(q(v,λ))/∂lnv=εp/εφis less than 1 (see
22:775:53776:21:20:71:539:627:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:appendix for proof).  Thus, the vast empirical evidence on incomplete pass-through (see the survey
22:776:53874:20:20:71:539:607:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:by Burstein and Gopinath, 2014) also requires demand condition (B1).  Most importantly, we will
22:777:53969:20:21:71:539:587:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:show that (B1) is a necessary condition for the evidence we documented on product reallocations
22:778:54064:21:20:71:539:566:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:for French exporters.  This provides an independent confirmation for this demand condition that
22:779:54159:20:20:71:539:546:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:does not rely on the (very noisy) measurement of product prices and the estimation of markups
22:780:54252:20:31:71:228:526:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(or alternatively marginal costs).

22:785:54365:31:21:88:539:260:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Assumption (B1’) is more restrictive than (B1):  in the appendix, we show how (B1’) implies

22:788:54661:20:21:72:539:199:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:have  to  be  everywhere  steeper  than  log  demand:εφ(qi)> εp(qi)  for  allqi≥0  (see  appendix).
22:789:54760:21:20:72:540:178:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f9:Whereas (B1) entails an increasing relationship between output and markup (and hence thelevel

23:795:55345:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the evidence on such pass-through differences that we previously discussed (for French,  Belgian,
23:796:55442:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Brazilian, and Chinese firms/products).  In the following section, we show that (B1’) is a sufficient
23:797:55543:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:condition for the product reallocations we previously described for French exporters, in addition to
23:798:55643:20:21:72:473:648:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f6:all the evidence from the existing literature on prices, markups, and pass-through.26
23:799:55728:21:20:88:539:627:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Lastly we note that conditions (B1) and (B1’) exclude the C.E.S. case, where the derivative of

23:809:56526:20:20:88:540:402:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:First,  we  note  that  the  increase  in  competitionλinduces  a  downward  shift  in  output  sales

23:813:56926:20:21:71:539:321:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:then determine the changes in the elasticities of output, sales, and profit with respect to marginal

23:822:57705:16:15:80:539:119:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:26We  will  also  show  how  the  necessary  condition  for  the  French  exporters  evidence  on  product  reallocations  is

24:831:58405:21:32:72:258:615:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:is that[1−εp(qi)]/εφ(qi)is decreasing.

24:834:58611:21:20:88:539:542:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We have derived these reallocations using the per-consumer measures of performance, but since
24:835:58704:20:20:72:540:522:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:they are all evaluated as ratios, multiplying those by the number of consumersLcwould lead to
24:836:58797:20:21:72:540:502:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:identical outcomes (even thoughLcis changing).  Thus, we see that (B1’) is a sufficient condition
24:837:58894:21:20:72:540:481:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:for all performance measures (profit, output, revenue) to be reallocated toward better performing
24:838:58991:20:20:72:539:461:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:products.  In this case, an increase in competition (higherλ) induces a steeper relationship between
24:839:59091:20:21:72:539:441:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:a product’s costvand its profit, output, and revenue outcome (higher elasticities|επ,v|,|εq,v|,|εr,v|).
24:840:59194:21:20:72:540:420:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A given percentage reduction in costvthen translates into a higher percentage increase in those
24:841:59289:20:20:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:performance outcomes.  In the case of C.E.S. preferences, all those performance elasticities would
24:842:59387:20:21:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:be constant, and hence changes in demand (and corresponding changes in competitionλ) would
24:843:59477:21:20:72:535:359:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:have no effect on the relative performance of products (conditional on selection into production).
24:844:59575:20:20:88:539:339:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The reallocation of output towards better performing products has a direct consequence for firm

24:850:60003:27:20:72:540:195:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:In the short-run, we have already discussed how an increase in demandLcand the corresponding

24:855:60482:17:15:80:539:97:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:28Bertoletti and Epifani (2014) derive a similar expression for the reallocation of revenue.  However, they do not
24:856:60596:15:0:72:407:82:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:show how that condition is implied by assumption (B1’) and requires (B1) to hold.
25:857:60679:0:21:72:539:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:then implies that the profits for the better performing products (with lower costv) increase dispro-
25:858:60779:21:20:71:539:688:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:portionately relative to the high cost products.  Thus, net operating profit per-product increases
25:859:60877:20:20:71:147:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:for all products.
25:860:60894:20:21:88:539:648:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:In the long-run, we mentioned that the change in the cutoffs in response to an increase in demand
25:861:60991:21:20:71:539:627:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:could not be determined without making additional assumptions on demand.  Under (B1), such a
25:862:61083:20:20:71:539:607:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:demand increase induces a disproportionate increase in operating profits for the best performing
25:863:61179:20:21:71:539:587:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:products;  thus,  total  firm  profit  Π(c,λ)  becomes  steeper  (as  a  function  of  firm  competencyc).
25:864:61285:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The free entry condition (12) then requires a single crossing of the new steeper total firm profit

25:866:61486:20:21:72:539:526:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:constant entry costfe).  This crossing defines a new profitability cutoff  ̃cwhereby better performing

25:868:61684:20:20:71:539:485:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:loss.  Hence, the zero profit cutoff ˆc(and the associated product-level cutoff ˆv) decreases, leading
25:869:61786:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to the exit of the worse performing firms (and the worse performing products for all firms).  The

25:871:61976:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:fashion to the firm-level profit curve:  profits for the best performing products increase while they
25:872:62077:20:21:72:539:404:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:decrease for the worse performing products.  For those high performing products with low costv,
25:873:62172:21:20:71:539:383:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the increase in demandLcdominates the effect of tougher competition (higherλ) on per-consumer

25:875:62339:20:21:88:539:343:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We  further  note  that  (B1)  is  also  a  necessary  condition  for  this  selection  effect  in  the  long

25:877:62547:20:20:71:539:302:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(increasing) profits for the best (worst) performing firms and products.  This would result in an

28:972:68845:27:21:71:539:517:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Using the same reasoning as previously developed for the closed economy case, we can show that

28:979:69418:27:20:72:540:352:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Again using a similar reasoning to our analysis of the closed economy case, demand condition (B1)
28:980:69515:20:21:72:540:332:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:is sufficient for the demand shock to increase the net profit for the sales of the best performing

28:984:69900:21:20:71:539:250:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f11:that an increase in demand leads to a fall in the export cutoffs  ˆvHD:  Existing exporters fromH

29:1002:71417:20:21:72:540:519:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:weaker version (B1) are also directly connected to the empirical evidence on firm/product markups
29:1003:71514:21:20:72:540:498:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and  pass-through.   In  the  limiting  case  of  C.E.S.  preferences,  demand  shocks  in  export  market
29:1004:71620:20:20:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:would have no impact on the skewness of export sales; markups are constant across products; and
29:1005:71715:20:21:72:330:458:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:pass-through is complete (equal to 1) for all products.
29:1006:71770:21:20:88:539:437:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:On its own, the evidence on the positive relationship between demand shocks and export skew-
29:1007:71862:20:20:72:539:417:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:ness  requires  that  [1−εp(qi)]/εφ(qi)  is  decreasing  over  the  range  of  exported  outputqithat  we
29:1008:71967:20:21:72:539:397:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:observe.  We have pointed out that condition (B1’) (εφ(qi) increasing) is sufficient for this outcome.
29:1009:72069:21:20:72:540:376:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:However, since it is not a necessary condition, our evidence for the skewness of exports does not
29:1010:72166:20:20:72:540:356:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:imply that (B1’) must hold.  On the other hand, we show in the appendix that the weaker condition
29:1011:72263:20:21:72:539:336:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(B1) (Marshall’s Second Law of Demand,εφ(qi) increasing) must nevertheless hold.  In particular,
29:1012:72359:21:20:72:539:315:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:we show that even if (B1) were violated over a portion of the relevant demand curve (εp(qi) de-
29:1013:72454:20:20:72:540:295:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:creasing over some range), then this would result in a reverse prediction for export skewness over
29:1014:72552:20:21:72:540:275:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:this portion of the demand curve.  This result also fits with what we know about the limiting case
29:1015:72650:21:20:72:513:254:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of C.E.S. preferences, where demand shocks have no impact on the skewness of export sales.
29:1016:72740:20:20:88:539:234:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Thus, our empirical evidence on the impact of demand shocks for export skewness provides an
29:1017:72831:20:21:72:540:214:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:independent confirmation for the empirical relevance of this critical property of demand – without
29:1018:72929:21:16:72:317:193:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:relying on the measurement of prices and markups.
29:1019:72978:16:11:80:516:177:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:31We document the strong empirical connection between demand shocks and firm productivity in Section 6.
29:1020:73081:11:14:80:539:166:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:32We  showed  how  the  ratio  of  export  sales  for  any  two  products  (with  the  better  performing  product  in  the
29:1021:73204:14:11:72:540:152:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:numerator)  increases  in  response  to  a  demand  shock.   This  clearly  increases  the  skewness  of  export  sales.   In  a
29:1022:73332:11:11:72:540:141:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:separate appendix, we confirm that such an increase in skewness is reflected in the Theil and Atkinson indices that
29:1023:73447:11:0:72:191:130:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:we use in our empirical work.

30:1025:73542:32:20:72:540:677:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Our theoretical model highlights how our measured demand shocks induce increases in competi-
30:1026:73634:20:20:72:540:657:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:tion  for  exporters  to  those  destinations;  and  how  the  increased  competition  generates  increases

30:1028:73844:21:20:72:540:616:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We seek to directly measure this connection between demand shocks and productivity.  Since we
30:1029:73937:20:20:72:540:596:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:cannot measure the productivity associated with products sold to a particular destination, we need
30:1030:74035:20:21:72:540:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to show that the connection between demand shocks and product reallocations aggregates to the
30:1031:74128:21:20:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:firm-level – before examining the link with firm-level productivity changes (which we can directly
30:1032:74226:20:20:72:540:535:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:measure).  Our results in section 3 highlighted how demand shocks lead to reallocations towards
30:1033:74321:20:20:72:540:515:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:better  performing  products  at  the  destination-industry  level.   In  this  section,  we  show  how  the
30:1034:74429:20:21:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:destination-industry demand shocks can be aggregated to the firm-level – and this firm-level de-

30:1036:74628:20:20:72:539:454:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:market shares) at thefirm-level; that is, changes in skewness to the firm’s global product mix (the
30:1037:74727:20:21:71:321:434:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:distribution of product sales across all destinations).
30:1038:74782:21:20:88:539:413:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Intuitively,  since  there  is  a  stable  ranking  of  products  at  the  firm  level  (better  performing
30:1039:74889:20:20:71:539:393:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:products in one market are most likely to be the better performing products in other markets – as
30:1040:74986:20:21:71:539:373:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:we previously discussed), then reallocations towards better performing products within destinations
30:1041:75085:21:20:71:539:352:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:should also be reflected in the reallocations of global sales/production towards better performing
30:1042:75183:20:20:71:539:332:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:products; and the strength of this link between the skewness of sales at the destination and global
30:1043:75282:20:21:71:539:312:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:levels should depend on the importance of the destination in the firm’s global sales.  Our chosen
30:1044:75379:21:20:71:539:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:measure  of  skewness,  the  Theil  index,  makes  this  intuition  precise.   It  is  the  only  measure  of
30:1045:75488:20:20:71:539:271:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:skewness that exhibits a stable decomposition from the skewness of global sales into the skewness
30:1046:75585:20:21:71:539:251:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of  destination-level  sales  (see  Jost  2007).33Specifically,  letTi,tbe  firmi’s  Theil  index  for  the

30:1056:76225:11:7:72:492:145:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:product sales) is split into “destinations” and the global measure reflects the sum across “destinations”.

31:1096:77485:20:20:71:539:450:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:positive and converges to zero as the distributions of product market shares in different destination
31:1097:77586:20:21:71:205:430:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:become increasingly similar.
31:1098:77614:21:20:88:539:409:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:To better understand the logic behind (17), note that it implies that the average of the within-
31:1099:77710:20:20:71:539:389:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:destination  Theil  indices  can  be  decomposed  into  the  sum  of  two  positive  elements:  the  global
31:1100:77817:20:21:71:539:369:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Theil index, and the between-destination Theil index.  This decomposition can be interpreted as
31:1101:77912:21:20:71:539:348:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:a decomposition of variance/dispersion.  The dispersion observed in the destination level product
31:1102:78009:20:20:71:539:328:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:exports must be explained either by dispersion in global product exports (global Theil index), or
31:1103:78106:20:21:71:539:308:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:by the fact that the distribution of product sales varies across destinations (between-destination
31:1104:78204:21:20:71:133:287:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Theil index).
31:1105:78217:20:20:88:539:267:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A simple example helps to clarify this point.  Take a firm with 2 products and 2 destinations.
31:1106:78311:20:21:71:539:247:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:In each destination, exports of one product arex, and exports of the other product are 2x.  This
31:1107:78407:21:20:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:leads to the same value for the within-destination Theil indices of (1/3) ln (1/3) + (2/3) ln(2/3),
31:1108:78506:20:20:72:540:206:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and  hence  the  same  value  for  the  average  within-destination  Theil  index.   Hence,  if  the  same
31:1109:78612:20:20:72:540:186:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:product is the better performing product in each market (with 2xexports), then the distributions

31:1111:78808:21:20:72:540:145:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:dispersion is explained by the global Theil index, whose value is equal to the common value of the
31:1112:78906:20:20:72:540:125:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:two within-destination Theil indices.  On the other hand, if the opposite products perform better
31:1113:79003:20:16:72:539:105:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:in each market, global sales are 3xfor each product.  There is thus no variation in global product
31:1114:79101:16:15:80:539:89:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:35For simplicity, we omit the industry referencingIfor the destination Theils.  The decomposition across industries
31:1115:79216:15:0:72:172:74:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:follows a similar pattern.
32:1116:79244:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:sales, and the global Theil index is zero.  Accordingly, all of the variation in the within-destination
32:1117:79347:21:20:72:356:688:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Theil indices is explained by the between-destination Theil.
32:1118:79407:20:20:88:539:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The theoretical model of Bernard, Redding and Schott (2011) with CES demand predicts that
32:1119:79496:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the  between-destination  Theil  index  would  be  exactly  zero  when  measured  on  a  common  set  of
32:1120:79600:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:exported products across destinations.  With linear demand, Mayer, Melitz and Ottaviano (2014)
32:1121:79694:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:show (theoretically and empirically) that this between-destination index would deviate from zero
32:1122:79790:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:because  skewness  varies  across  destinations.   We  have  shown  earlier  that  this  result  holds  for
32:1123:79897:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:a  larger  class  of  demand  systems  such  that  the  elasticity  and  the  convexity  of  inverse  demand
32:1124:80005:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:increase with consumption.  Yet, even in these cases, the between-destination Theil is predicted to
32:1125:80104:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:be small because the ranking of the product sales is very stable across destinations.  This leads to
32:1126:80204:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:a prediction that the market-share weighted average of the destination Theils should be strongly
32:1127:80300:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:correlated with the firm’s global Theil.  Empirically, this prediction is strongly confirmed as shown
32:1128:80401:20:244:72:349:465:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:in the firm-level scatter plot (across all years) in Figure 2.

32:1130:80536:32:20:88:539:189:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:This  high  correlation  between  destination  and  global  skewness  of  product  sales  enables  us
32:1131:80637:20:20:72:540:169:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to  move  from  our  previous  predictions  for  the  effects  of  the  demand  shocks  on  skewness  at  the
32:1132:80746:20:21:72:540:149:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:destination-level to a new prediction at the firm-level.  To do this, we aggregate our destination-

32:1134:80942:20:0:72:540:108:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:export shares across destinations.  We thus obtain our firm-level demand shock in (log) levels and

33:1158:81833:20:21:88:539:487:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:By construction, our firm-level demand shocks will predict changes in the weighted average of

33:1164:82420:20:21:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:substantially weaker than the firm-level trade shock in the destination-level regressions – is no longer
33:1165:82524:21:20:72:540:344:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:significant at the firm level.  The GDP shock is not significant in the (log) levels regressions, but is
33:1166:82628:20:20:72:392:324:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:very strong and significant in the two first-difference specifications.

33:1169:82899:20:20:72:540:263:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:That is because we cannot measure the breakdown of product-level sales on the French domestic
33:1170:82992:20:21:72:540:243:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:market.   Ultimately,  it  is  the  distribution  of  labor  allocation  across  products  (and  the  induced
33:1171:83101:21:20:72:540:222:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:distribution of production levels) that determines a firm’s labor productivity – conditional on its
33:1172:83200:20:20:72:540:202:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:technology (the production functions for each individual product). As highlighted by our theoretical
33:1173:83300:20:21:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:model, the export market demand shocks generate two different types of reallocations that both
33:1174:83394:21:20:72:540:161:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:contribute to an increased skewness of production levels for the firm:  reallocations within the set of
33:1175:83497:20:20:72:540:141:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:exported products, which generate the increased skewness of global exports that we just discussed;
33:1176:83595:20:16:72:540:121:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:but also reallocations from non-exported products towards the better performing exported products

34:1199:84725:20:20:72:540:327:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:statistic  that  reflects  this  reallocation  from  non-exported  to  exported  goods:   the  firm’s  export

34:1204:85237:21:20:72:540:225:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:industry-level trade shock remains insignificant.  Thus, our firm-level trade shock and GDP shock
34:1205:85334:20:20:72:540:205:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:both predict the two types of reallocations towards better performing products that we highlighted

34:1207:85516:17:15:80:539:168:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:37Since the export intensity is a ratio, we do not apply a log-transformation to that variable. However, specifications

35:1248:87964:20:20:71:539:152:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Consequently, we run all of our specifications with sector-time (2 digit NACE) fixed effects, thus

35:1250:88168:16:15:80:539:116:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:38At the firm-level, an increase in markups across all products will be picked-up in our firm productivity measure
35:1251:88282:15:11:72:540:101:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:– even though this does not reflect a welfare-relevant increase in output.  But if this is the case, then this firm’s labor
35:1252:88405:11:7:72:438:90:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:share will decrease, and its productivity will carry a smaller weight in the aggregate index.
35:1253:88498:7:0:80:539:83:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:39We have also experimented with an alternative procedure using deflated value-added per worker (the value added
36:1254:88612:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:results therefore capture within-sector effects of the demand shocks, over-and-above any contribu-

36:1256:88806:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:welfare-relevant aggregate productivity change by aggregating our firm-level productivity changes
36:1257:88903:20:21:72:278:648:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:using the observed changes in labor shares.
36:1258:88946:21:20:88:539:627:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Our  firm-level  demand  shocks  only  aggregate  across  export  destinations.   They  therefore  do
36:1259:89047:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:not incorporate a firm’s exposure to demand shocks in its domestic (French) market.  This is not
36:1260:89143:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:possible  for  two  reasons:   most  importantly,  we  do  not  observe  the  product-level  breakdown  of
36:1261:89249:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the  firms’  sales  in  the  French  market  (we  only  observe  total  domestic  sales  across  products);  in
36:1262:89360:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:addition,  world  exports  into  France  would  not  be  exogenous  to  firm-level  technology  changes  in
36:1263:89467:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:France.   Therefore,  we  need  to  adjust  our  export-specific  demand  shock  using  the  firm’s  export
36:1264:89574:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:intensity to obtain an overall firm-level demand shock relevant for overall production and hence

36:1279:90306:28:20:72:540:267:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:In this section, we investigate the direct link between this firm-level demand shock and firm produc-
36:1280:90407:20:20:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:tivity.  Here, we focus exclusively on our firm-specific demand shock from (1).  Most importantly,
36:1281:90505:20:21:72:539:227:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:this is our only demand shock that exhibits variation across firms within destinations.41In addition,
36:1282:90606:21:20:72:540:206:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:this is the demand shock that induced the strongest and most robust response in the skewness of
36:1283:90701:20:20:72:540:186:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the intensive margin of product exports.  Our measure of productivity is the log of value-added per
36:1284:90800:20:11:72:540:166:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:deflator  coming  from  EUKLEMS  dataset  for  France)  and  year  fixed-effects  (dropping  the  industry-year  combined
36:1285:90921:11:7:72:305:155:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:fixed effects).  The differences in the results are negligible.
36:1286:90984:7:15:80:540:148:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:40Sincexi,F,tis only available in the firm balance sheet data (and not in the customs data), we use the reported firm
36:1287:91101:15:11:72:540:133:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:total export figurexi,tfrom the same balance sheet data to compute this ratio. This ensures a consistent measurement
36:1288:91217:11:11:72:540:122:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:for the firm’s export intensity.  The correlation between this firm total export figure and the one reported by customs
36:1289:91336:11:7:72:410:111:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:is .95 (very high, though exhibiting some differences between the two data sources).
36:1290:91420:7:15:80:539:104:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:41As a robustness check reported in appendix C, we purge the trade shock of any industry-destination-year effect
36:1291:91532:15:11:72:540:89:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:in order to eliminate any correlation between destination characteristics and unobserved firm attributes associated
36:1292:91647:11:0:72:486:78:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:with higher productivity growth.  This approach precludes using the GDP and ISIC level trade shocks.
37:1293:91749:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:worker.  All regressions include industry-year fixed effects, that will capture in particular different
37:1294:91852:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:evolutions of price indexes across industries.  In order to control for changes in capital intensity,
37:1295:91953:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:we use the log of capital per worker.  We also control for unobserved changes in labor utilization
37:1296:92051:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and returns to scale by using the log of raw materials (including energy use).  Then, increases in
37:1297:92149:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:worker effort or higher returns to scale will be reflected in the impact of raw materials use on labor
37:1298:92251:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:productivity.  As there is no issue with zeros for all these firm-level variables, we directly measure
37:1299:92353:20:21:72:447:587:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the growth rate of those variable using simple first differences of the log levels.
37:1300:92436:21:20:88:539:566:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We  begin  with  a  graphical  representation  of  the  strong  positive  relationship  between  firm-

37:1306:93048:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:dummies.  Those figures clearly highlight the very strong positive response of the large exporters’
37:1307:93147:20:33:72:537:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:productivity to changes in trade competition in export markets (captured by the demand shock).

37:1320:94036:21:0:72:540:84:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:productivity responds to the demand shock via its effect on competition and product reallocations
38:1321:94135:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:in the firm’s export markets.  Thus, we assumed that the firm’s technology at the product level (the
38:1322:94235:21:20:72:539:688:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:marginal costv(m,c) for each productm) was exogenous (in particular, with respect to demand
38:1323:94326:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:fluctuations  in  export  markets).   However,  there  is  a  substantial  literature  examining  how  this
38:1324:94433:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:technology  responds  to  export  market  conditions  via  various  forms  of  innovation  or  investment
38:1325:94538:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:choices made by the firm.  We feel that the timing dimension of our first difference specifications –
38:1326:94639:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:especially our FD-FE specifications which nets out any firm-level growth trends – eliminates this
38:1327:94736:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:technology response channel:  It is highly unlikely that a firm’s innovation or investment response

38:1330:95035:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:However, we will also show some additional robustness checks that address this potential technology
38:1331:95134:21:20:72:115:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:response.
38:1332:95143:20:20:88:539:485:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The first three columns of Table 7 show that,  across our three timing specifications,  there is
38:1333:95239:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:a  stable  and  very  strong  response  of  firm  productivity  to  the  trade  shock.   Since  our  measure
38:1334:95347:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of  productivity  as  value  added  per  worker  incorporates  neither  the  impact  of  changes  in  input
38:1335:95454:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:intensities  nor  the  effects  of  non-constant  returns  to  scale,  we  directly  control  for  these  effects
38:1336:95567:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:in the next set of regressions.  In the last 3 columns of Table 7,  we add controls for capital per
38:1337:95666:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:worker and raw material use (including energy).  Both of these controls are highly significant:  not
38:1338:95766:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:surprisingly,  increases  in  capital  intensity  are  reflected  in  labor  productivity;  and  we  find  that
38:1339:95877:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:increases in raw materials use are also associated with higher labor productivity.  This would be
38:1340:95974:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the case if there are increasing returns to scale in the value-added production function, or if labor
38:1341:96075:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:utilization/effort increases with scale (in the short-run).  However,  even when these controls are
38:1342:96174:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:added,  the  very  strong  effect  of  the  trade  shock  on  firm  productivity  remains  highly  significant
38:1343:96284:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:well beyond the 1% significance level (from here on out, we will keep those controls in all of our
38:1344:96382:20:20:72:241:241:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:firm-level productivity regressions).
38:1345:96419:20:21:88:539:221:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Although  our  trade  shock  variable  exhibits  variation  within  destinations  it  nevertheless  also
38:1346:96523:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:reflects  the  impact  of  aggregate  destination  shocks.   This  could  potentially  generate  a  selection
38:1347:96632:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:bias if firms with unobserved characteristics leading to higher productivity growth self-select into
38:1348:96732:20:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:destinations with positive aggregate destination shocks (or vice-versa).  In order to eliminate this
38:1349:96832:21:20:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:possibility, we generate a version of our trade shock that is purged (demeaned) of any industry-

41:1445:102265:20:20:71:539:228:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:tests.   Our  first  test  highlights  that  the  link  between  productivity  and  the  trade  shocks  is  only
41:1446:102377:20:21:71:539:208:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:operative  for  multi-product  firms.   Table  11  reports  the  same  regression  (with  controls)  as  our
41:1447:102485:21:20:71:539:187:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:baseline results from Table 7, but only for single-product exporters.  This new table clearly shows
41:1448:102584:20:20:71:539:167:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:that  this  there  is  no  evidence  of  this  link  among  this  subset  of  firms.   Next,  we  show  that  this
41:1449:102698:20:21:71:539:147:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:productivity-trade link is only operative for firms with a substantial exposure to export markets
41:1450:102795:21:20:71:539:126:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(measured by export intensity).  Similarly to single-product firms, we would not expect to find a
41:1451:102892:20:20:71:539:106:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:significant productivity-trade link among firms with very low export intensity.  This is indeed the
41:1452:102991:20:0:71:539:86:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:case.  In Table 12, we re-run our baseline specification using the trade shock before it is interacted
42:1453:103095:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:with export intensity.  The first three columns report the results for the quartile of firms with the
42:1454:103196:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:lowest export intensity, and highlight that there is no evidence of the productivity-trade link for
42:1455:103295:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:those firms.  On the other hand, we clearly see from the last three columns that this effect is very
42:1456:103395:20:21:72:453:648:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f6:strong and powerful for the quartile of firms with the highest export intensity.43
42:1457:103477:21:20:88:539:627:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:When we focus on this top quartile for export intensity, we are restricting our sample to sub-
42:1458:103571:20:20:71:539:607:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:stantially larger exporters.  If a French exporter is dominant in some of its export destinations, then
42:1459:103674:20:21:71:539:587:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:our exogeneity assumption for rest-of-world exports to those destinations may be violated.  In this
42:1460:103773:21:20:71:539:566:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:situation where a French firm has a substantial market share for some destination-product market,
42:1461:103870:20:20:71:539:546:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:it  is  possible  for  the  rest-of-the-world  exports  to  respond  to  that  firm’s  change  in  productivity.
42:1462:103982:20:21:71:539:526:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:First, we note that this would likely bias our coefficient downwards, as a French firm’s productiv-
42:1463:104081:21:20:71:539:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:ity increase would induce other exporters to reduce their shipments in their competing markets.
42:1464:104176:20:20:71:539:485:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We can nevertheless address this potential endogeneity directly by dropping any firm that could
42:1465:104271:20:21:71:539:465:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:hypothetically impact rest-of-world exports.  We have experimented with several different market
42:1466:104367:21:20:71:539:444:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:thresholds, and have found that exclusions of those firms either leave those key coefficients on the
42:1467:104467:20:20:71:317:424:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f6:trade shock unaffected, or sometimes raises them.44
42:1468:104518:20:21:88:539:404:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The firms with high export intensity therefore have a response of productivity to trade shocks
42:1469:104612:21:20:71:539:383:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:estimated around 10% (columns 5 and 6 of Table 12).  How should we interpret this number in
42:1470:104703:20:20:71:539:363:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:terms of the impact of our mechanism on the productivity of the French economy as a whole?  As we
42:1471:104800:20:21:71:539:343:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:previously discussed, our firm-level measure of productivity does not correspond directly to physical
42:1472:104901:21:20:71:539:322:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:productivity since we cannot adjust for changes in firm-product prices and qualities.  However, as
42:1473:104999:20:20:71:539:302:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:we pointed out (see equation 18), this firm-level productivity measure can be aggregated up to a
42:1474:105095:20:21:71:539:282:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:sector level measure of physical productivity using the firms’ labor shares.  Side-stepping the issues
42:1475:105197:21:20:71:539:261:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of measurement for the sector price indexPI, we can directly measure the separate contribution of
42:1476:105294:20:20:71:263:241:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the trade shock to sectoral productivity.
42:1477:105335:20:21:88:539:221:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We start with the coefficient on the trade shock for the high export-intensity quartileβq4for the
42:1478:105432:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:specifications in first differences.  This gives us the percentage productivity response to a 1% trade
42:1479:105534:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:shock for the firms in the fourth quartile. We assume that there is no response of productivity for the
42:1480:105637:20:16:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:firms in the remaining 3 quartiles.  We can then use each firm’s measured trade shock to calculate an
42:1481:105738:16:15:80:539:144:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:43Since the trade shock as not been interacted with export intensity, the coefficients for this top quartile represent
42:1482:105856:15:11:72:540:129:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:significantly higher magnitudes than the average coefficients across the whole sample reported in Table 7 (since export
42:1483:105975:11:11:72:540:118:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:intensity is always below 1).  This is also confirmed by a specification with the interacted trade shock restricted to
42:1484:106093:11:7:72:197:107:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:this same top quartile of firms.
42:1485:106125:7:15:80:539:100:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:44For  example,  one  of  our  more  aggressive  thresholds  was  the  exclusion  of  any  firm  with  an  average  product-
42:1486:106249:15:11:72:540:85:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:destination market share (for any year) exceeding 10%.  In this case, the coefficients for the trade shock corresponding

44:1542:109544:20:20:71:539:323:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:productivity changes range from an average annual impact of 3.4 % for wearing apparel, to a small

44:1544:109739:21:20:71:539:282:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the trade shocks is substantial – accounting for a 1.2% average productivity growth rate for the

44:1546:109931:20:20:71:539:242:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:with the highest export intensities).  This amounts to a 12% productivity gain over our ten year
44:1547:110027:20:21:71:539:222:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:sample period from 1995-2005.  Taking the ratio of the annual 1.2% productivity gain to the 6.2%
44:1548:110123:21:20:71:539:201:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:trade shock change,  we see that the .092 firm-level elasticity obtained in Table 12 is doubled to
44:1549:110221:20:20:71:539:181:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:.193 for aggregate productivity.  This reflects the contribution of labor share reallocations towards

45:1581:111712:21:20:72:540:290:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:that  demand  shocks  generate  an  endogenous  increase  in  local  competition  that  induces  firms  to
45:1582:111818:20:20:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:skew their sales towards their better performing products – generating increases in productivity.
45:1583:111915:20:21:72:540:250:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Empirically, our data matches individual export flows by French firms to each country in the world
45:1584:112013:21:20:72:540:229:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:with balance sheet data needed to evaluate the impact of demand shocks on productivity and to
45:1585:112106:20:20:72:540:209:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:control for confounding factors.  The strategy is therefore to look at product mix changes inside the
45:1586:112207:20:21:72:540:189:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:firm, rather than reallocations of market shares across firms.  We can therefore control for many
45:1587:112304:21:20:72:540:168:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:alternative  explanations  that  might  be  correlated  with  foreign  demand  shocks  –  a  strategy  that
45:1588:112411:20:20:72:372:148:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:would not be possible when evaluating the effectsacrossfirms.
45:1589:112472:20:21:88:539:128:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Our baseline results shows that the elasticity of labor productivity to trade shocks is between
45:1590:112567:21:20:72:540:107:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:5 and 11 %.  This order of magnitude is very robust to controls for short-run investment by the
45:1591:112662:20:0:72:540:87:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:firm,  scale  effects,  and  possibly  correlated  import  shocks.   Our  measured  productivity  effect  for
46:1592:112773:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:single product firms is nil, further highlighting the importance of changes in product mix for multi-
46:1593:112874:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:product firms.  We also show that this productivity response is concentrated within the quartile of
46:1594:112973:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:exporters with the highest export intensities.  Taking into account the weight of those firms in the
46:1595:113073:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:whole economy, we calculate that the average annual increase in French manufacturing productivity

49:1687:119657:20:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:further imply that 0≤εp(qi)<1 andεφ(qi)>0.  Thus, we see thatεp(qi) is increasing (decreasing)

49:1689:119850:21:20:72:540:507:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:if and only if the pass-though elasticityθ≡∂lnp(q(v,λ)/∂lnv=εp/εφis less than 1 (pass-through

49:1693:120148:20:20:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of demand atqi= 0: limqi→0ε′p(qi)qi≥0.  This just rules out an extreme form of demand convexity

49:1699:120565:27:21:72:539:282:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Assume (B1’) holds:ε′φ(qi)>0.  Given (19),ε′p(qi)≤0 impliesεp(qi)≥εφ(qi) over that range for

49:1701:120748:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:below (or atqi= 0).  This in turn would imply thatεp(qi) is strictly increasing at the intersection

49:1703:120945:20:21:72:539:201:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:be strictly belowεφ(qi) for allqi>0.Given (19), this entailsε′p(qi)≥0 with the inequality strict
49:1704:121041:21:35:72:315:180:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:forqi>0.  Thus,εp(qi) must be strictly increasing.
