2:36:2107:28:28:273:338:616:12:Times:12:Times:C:ABSTRACT
2:37:2115:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:We estimate the effect of information and expertise on consumers’ willingness to pay for national
2:38:2212:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:brands in physically homogeneous product categories. In a detailed case study of headache remedies
2:39:2310:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:we find that more informed or expert consumers are less likely to pay extra to buy national brands,
2:40:2409:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:with pharmacists choosing them over store brands only 9 percent of the time, compared to 26 percent
2:41:2508:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:of the time for the average consumer. In a similar case study of pantry staples such as salt and sugar,
2:42:2611:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:we show that chefs devote 12 percentage points less of their purchases to national brands than demographically
2:43:2721:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:similar non-chefs. We extend our analysis to cover 50 retail health categories and 241 food and drink
2:44:2822:14:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:categories. The results suggest that misinformation and related consumer mistakes explain a sizable
2:45:2921:14:14:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:share of the brand premium for health products, and a much smaller share for most food and drink
2:46:3017:14:42:72:485:462:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:products. We tie our estimates together using a stylized model of demand and pricing.

3:76:3686:0:32:72:171:709:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:1    Introduction
3:77:3703:32:20:72:540:677:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:A 100-tablet package of 325mg Bayer Aspirin costs $6.29 at cvs.com.   A 100-tablet package of 325mg
3:78:3802:20:21:72:540:657:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:CVS store-brand aspirin costs $1.99 (CVS 2013).  The two brands share the same dosage, directions, and
3:79:3904:21:20:72:540:636:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:active ingredient. Aspirin has been sold in the United States for more than 100 years, CVS explicitly directs
3:80:4013:20:20:72:540:616:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consumers to compare Bayer to the CVS alternative, and CVS is one of the the largest pharmacy chains in
3:81:4116:20:21:72:540:596:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the country, with presumably little incentive to sell a faulty product.  Yet the prevailing prices are evidence
3:82:4227:21:20:72:403:575:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:that some consumers are willing to pay a three-fold premium to buy Bayer.1
3:83:4301:20:20:88:539:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:This is not an isolated case. In our data (described in more detail below), we find that consumers would
3:84:4405:20:21:71:539:535:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:spend $44 billion less per year on consumer packaged goods (CPG) if they switched from a national brand to
3:85:4511:21:20:71:539:514:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a store-brand alternative whenever possible. Prior work documents substantial brand price premia in a wide
3:86:4617:20:20:71:539:494:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:range of non-CPG categories, such as automobiles (Sullivan 1998), index funds (Hortaçsu and Syverson
3:87:4717:20:21:71:317:474:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:2004), and online books (Smith and Brynjolfsson 2001).
3:88:4771:21:20:88:539:453:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Economists have long debated the origins of brand premia. On the one hand, national brands may offer
3:89:4871:20:20:71:539:433:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:superior quality or reliability,2or may deliver direct utility benefits (Becker and Murphy 1993). On the other
3:90:4981:20:21:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:hand, consumers may be willing to pay a premium for brands because they overestimate the benefits of the
3:91:5085:21:20:72:539:392:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:brand, or are otherwise confused or misled.3Determining which story holds is important for evaluating the
3:92:5190:20:20:72:540:372:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:efficiency of consumer goods markets and the welfare effects of advertising, and may be relevant to policy
3:93:5296:20:21:72:284:352:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:decisions in consumer protection and regulation.
3:94:5344:21:20:88:539:331:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In this paper, we seek to separate these stories by asking how the propensity to buy CPG brands varies
3:95:5446:20:20:72:540:311:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:with consumer information and expertise. We introduce a novel database that matches household purchase
3:96:5548:20:21:72:540:291:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:data from the 2004-2011 Nielsen Homescan panel to a new survey containing direct measures of consumer
3:97:5649:21:30:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:product knowledge, as well as three broader proxies: completed schooling, college major, and occupation.
3:98:5753:30:14:87:539:240:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:1Indeed, in our data (described in more detail below), 25 percent of aspirin sales by volume (and 60 percent by expenditure)
3:99:5877:14:8:72:182:226:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:are to national-brand products.
3:100:5908:8:15:87:539:218:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:2In one instance, the FDA determined that a generic antidepressant performed less well than its branded counterpart, likely due
3:101:6035:15:11:72:540:203:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:to differences in their “extended release” coatings (Thomas 2012). A widely publicized recall of store-brand acetaminophen in 2006
3:102:6165:11:11:72:540:192:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:resulted from the discovery that some pills could contain metal fragments (Associated Press 2006); such risks could conceivably
3:103:6292:11:11:72:540:181:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:be lower for national brands. Hortaçsu and Syverson (2004) conclude that purchases of high-cost “brand name” index funds partly
3:104:6419:11:11:72:540:170:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:reflect willingness to pay for non-financial objective attributes such as tax exposure and the number of other funds in the same
3:105:6547:11:8:72:97:159:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:family.
3:106:6554:8:14:87:539:151:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:3Braithwaite (1928) writes that advertisements “exaggerate the uses and merits” of national brands, citing aspirin and soap
3:107:6677:14:11:72:540:137:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:flakes as examples.  Simons (1948) advocates government regulation of advertising to help mitigate “the uninformed consumer’s
3:108:6802:11:11:72:540:126:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:rational disposition to ‘play safe’ by buying recognized, national brands” (p.  247).  Scherer (1970) discusses premium prices for
3:109:6932:11:11:72:540:115:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:national-brand drugs and bleach,  and writes that “it is hard to avoid concluding that if the housewife-consumer were informed
3:110:7058:11:11:72:540:104:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:about the merits of alternative products by some medium more objective than advertising and other image-enhancing devices, her
3:111:7184:11:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:readiness to pay price premiums as large as those observed here would be attenuated” (pp.  329-332).  More recently, a growing
3:112:7310:11:10:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:body of theoretical work considers markets with uninformed or manipulable consumers (Gabaix and Laibson 2006; Ellison and
3:113:7431:10:0:72:233:72:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:Wolitzky 2012; Piccione and Spiegler 2012).
4:114:7475:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The  database  includes  purchases  made  by  domain  experts:  pharmacists,  physicians,  or  other  healthcare
4:115:7587:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:workers in the context of health products, and chefs or other food preparers in the context of food products.
4:116:7696:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Our measures of consumer knowledge capture both knowledge of facts in the narrow sense, and broader
4:117:7795:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sophistication and expertise that allows consumers to translate such knowledge into optimal decisions. For
4:118:7901:21:20:72:530:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:simplicity of exposition, we will refer to all of these aspects of decision-making simply as “information.”
4:119:8008:20:20:88:539:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We entertain throughout the possibility that brands really do deliver more utility,  even in physically
4:120:8111:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:homogenous categories such as painkillers.  Bayer aspirin might be better for consumers due to non-active
4:121:8216:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ingredients, reliability, safety, packaging, or psychic utility such as comfort or familiarity associated with
4:122:8326:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the brand itself. The extent to which this is the case is not something we take a stand ona priori, but rather
4:123:8436:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the empirical object of interest.  Our key assumption is that this true utility is the same for informed and
4:124:8544:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:uninformed consumers—in other words, that all consumers would be better off if they weighed the relative
4:125:8648:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:merits of brands and non-brands in the same way as an informed expert. Under this assumption, comparing
4:126:8751:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the choices of informed and uninformed consumers lets us infer the extent to which the latter misestimate
4:127:8856:21:20:72:168:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the benefits of brands.
4:128:8879:20:20:88:539:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We frame our descriptive analysis with a stylized model that makes this interpretation explicit.  In the
4:129:8983:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:model,  households choose between a national brand and a store brand.   The national brand may deliver
4:130:9085:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:greater benefits to the household, whether psychic or instrumental.  Households choose brands according
4:131:9188:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to their perceptions of these benefits.  Households may misperceive the benefits of brands, but there is a
4:132:9294:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:set of households whose perceptions are known to be accurate.  To fix ideas we think of this latter group
4:133:9399:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of households as “informed,” and refer to the source of errors by other consumers as “misinformation,” but
4:134:9505:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the model is general enough to allow for non-informational frictions in choice, such as decision errors or
4:135:9611:20:21:72:117:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:heuristics.
4:136:9622:21:20:88:539:261:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The model shows that identification requires us to hold constant both the choice environment and the
4:137:9722:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:true preferences of the households when comparing the behavior of the informed to that of the uninformed.
4:138:9827:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:To limit confounding variation in the choice environment, we compare informed and uninformed consumers
4:139:9929:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:who shop in the same chain, market, and time period.4To limit confounding variation in preferences, we
4:140:10031:20:20:71:539:180:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:focus our analysis on choices between store and national brands that are matched on all physical attributes
4:141:10138:20:21:71:539:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:measured by Nielsen.   This matching does not guarantee that the products are of identical quality (and,
4:142:10242:21:20:71:539:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:indeed, that is what we seek to learn from the behavior of experts), but it eliminates variation in important
4:143:10351:20:33:71:539:119:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:horizontal attributes (e.g., active ingredient) that might lead to large differences in preferences between the
4:144:10462:33:14:87:539:86:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:4We address confounds related to workplace purchases (e.g., pharmacists receiving free samples or discounts that affect their
4:145:10587:14:0:72:540:72:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:purchasing behavior) by studying experts who are no longer employed at their specialty, and by studying the effect of college major.
5:146:10720:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:informed and the uninformed.  We further include detailed controls for income and other demographics,
5:147:10821:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and  compare  occupations  (e.g.,  physicians  and  lawyers)  with  similar  socioeconomic  status  but  different
5:148:10935:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:levels of product-specific expertise.  We show that, conditional on income and other demographics, well-
5:149:11039:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:informed consumers look similar to other consumers in their preferences for measured product attributes,
5:150:11143:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:making it more plausible that they are similar in their preferences for unmeasured attributes.   We argue
5:151:11248:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that whatever unmeasured preference heterogeneity remains would likely lead us to understate the extent of
5:152:11354:20:21:72:142:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:misinformation.
5:153:11369:21:20:88:539:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We begin the descriptive portion of our empirical analysis with a detailed case study of headache reme-
5:154:11472:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:dies. For these products, we measure information directly through a survey of a subset of Nielsen panelists
5:155:11579:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in which we ask the panelists to name the active ingredient in various national-brand headache remedies.
5:156:11683:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:This direct measure of information is highly correlated with our indirect proxy measures.  The average re-
5:157:11789:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:spondent answers 59 percent of our active ingredient questions correctly.   For the college-educated,  this
5:158:11896:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:fraction rises to 62 percent.  For those whose major was science or health, it is 73 percent.  For registered
5:159:12005:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:nurses it is 85 percent, for pharmacists it is 89 percent, and for physicians and surgeons it is 90 percent.
5:160:12113:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Occupational specialty is important enough to outweigh large differences in general human capital.  For
5:161:12216:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:example, registered nurses are far better informed about headache remedies than lawyers, despite having
5:162:12319:21:20:72:393:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:completed less schooling and earning less in the labor market on average.
5:163:12392:20:20:88:539:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We find that more informed households are consistently more likely to buy store-brand headache reme-
5:164:12492:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:dies. The average household devotes 74 percent of headache remedy purchases to store brands. Controlling
5:165:12596:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for household income, other demographics, and interacted fixed effects for the market, chain, and quarter in
5:166:12704:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:which the purchase is made, a household whose primary shopper correctly identifies all active ingredients is
5:167:12812:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:19 percentage points more likely to purchase a store brand than a shopper who identifies none. A household
5:168:12918:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:whose primary shopper believes that store brands are “just as safe” as national brands is 21 percentage points
5:169:13028:20:20:72:461:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:more likely to purchase a store brand than a shopper who does not believe that statement.
5:170:13117:20:21:88:539:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:A similar pattern emerges when we proxy for information with the schooling and occupation of the
5:171:13213:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:primary shopper.  Having a college-educated primary shopper predicts an increase of 4 percentage points,
5:172:13317:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:having a primary shopper with a healthcare occupation other than pharmacist or physician predicts an in-
5:173:13421:20:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:crease of 8 percentage points, and having a primary shopper who is a pharmacist or physician predicts an
5:174:13525:21:20:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:increase of 15 percentage points,  with pharmacists buying store brands 91 percent of the time.  Primary
5:175:13629:20:20:72:540:119:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:shoppers with science majors buy more store brands than those with other college degrees, and the effect of
5:176:13736:20:20:72:352:99:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:occupation is sizable among consumers not currently employed.
5:177:13797:20:0:88:539:79:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We find evidence that education and occupation capture similar variation to our more direct measures of
6:178:13901:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:information. When we restrict attention to households whose primary shopper correctly identifies all active
6:179:14008:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ingredients and believes that store brands are just as safe as national brands, the estimated effect of college
6:180:14119:20:20:72:438:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:education and occupation become economically small and statistically insignificant.
6:181:14202:20:21:88:539:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In a second case study of pantry staples (salt,  sugar,  and baking soda),  we find that chefs devote 77
6:182:14306:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:percent of their purchases to store brands, as compared to 60 percent for the average consumer.  The effect
6:183:14413:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of being a chef is large and highly significant after including our detailed vector of controls for income,
6:184:14520:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:demographics, and the choice environment.  Food preparers who are not chefs are also significantly more
6:185:14623:21:20:72:382:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:likely to buy store brands than others who are demographically similar.
6:186:14694:20:20:88:539:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We find that the effects of consumer information are largely domain-specific.  Neither knowledge of
6:187:14793:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:headache remedy active ingredients nor working in a healthcare occupation predicts store-brand purchases
6:188:14897:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in pantry staple categories. Similarly, working in a food preparer occupation other than chef does not predict
6:189:15007:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:store-brand headache remedy purchases.  We do find that chefs buy more store-brand headache remedies,
6:190:15108:20:21:72:405:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:suggesting that some of their knowledge may be transferred across domains.
6:191:15182:21:20:88:539:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We extend the approach from our two case studies to the full set of products in which there is a compara-
6:192:15287:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ble store-brand alternative to national brands and sufficient purchase volume to perform a reliable analysis.
6:193:15396:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Among 50 health-related categories, the effects of knowledge of headache remedy active ingredients, work-
6:194:15501:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ing in a healthcare occupation other than pharmacist or physician, and working as a pharmacist or physician
6:195:15608:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are positive for 43, 43, and 34 categories respectively. A substantial number of these positive coefficients—
6:196:15717:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:including a large share of those for over-the-counter medications—are both economically and statistically
6:197:15822:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:significant. On average across these categories, working as a pharmacist or physician reduces the probabil-
6:198:15929:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ity of buying the national brand by roughly a fourth.  Results are less consistent for the 241 food and drink
6:199:16038:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:categories that we study, with the effect of being a chef positive for 148 categories and negative for 93. Sev-
6:200:16149:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:eral of the positive coefficients are economically and statistically significant—including a number of pantry
6:201:16258:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:staples and other products such as baking mixes and dried fruit—but a large majority are not individually
6:202:16363:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:distinguishable from zero.  The average effect of working as a chef is to reduce the probability of buying a
6:203:16471:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:national brand by 2 percent. For health products, we find some suggestive evidence that the effect of infor-
6:204:16579:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:mation on the propensity to buy the store brand is greater in categories with higher advertising intensity and
6:205:16689:20:21:72:530:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in categories with more agreement among experts regarding the equivalence of store and national brands.
6:206:16792:21:20:88:539:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Taken together, our estimates suggest that misinformation explains a sizable portion of the brand pre-
6:207:16894:20:20:72:540:119:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:mium in many health categories, as well as in certain food categories (such as pantry staples) with little
6:208:17000:20:20:72:540:99:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:physical variation across brands. At the same time, our results suggest a smaller role for information in the
6:209:17109:20:0:72:540:79:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:many categories—including the majority of foods and beverages—in which even experts are willing to pay
7:210:17212:0:21:72:221:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a premium to buy national brands.
7:211:17245:21:20:88:539:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To sharpen these conclusions, in the final section of the paper we add structure to our stylized model of
7:212:17350:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:choice to allow us to make quantitative statements about the effect of consumer information on welfare and
7:213:17456:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:pricing.  We impose a set of assumptions on the pricing conduct of retailers and manufacturers and make
7:214:17559:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:functional form assumptions about the distribution of consumer preferences over brands and retailers.  We
7:215:17664:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:choose the parameters of the distribution of preference heterogeneity to match the market shares and price-
7:216:17771:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cost margins of store- and national-brand goods.  We choose a parameter that governs the gap in perceived
7:217:17876:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:brand value between informed and uninformed shoppers to match our descriptive estimates of the effect of
7:218:17980:20:20:72:302:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:information on the propensity to buy the store brand.
7:219:18033:20:21:88:539:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The estimated model implies that consumer information greatly affects the distribution of surplus in
7:220:18133:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:health categories.  Making all consumers as informed as a pharmacist or physician, while holding prices
7:221:18236:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:constant at current levels, would reduce the variable profits of the national headache remedy brands by half,
7:222:18345:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:equivalent to 19 percent of total expenditure.  The profits of store brands would increase by 5 percent of
7:223:18451:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:expenditure, and consumer surplus would increase by 4 percent of expenditure.  If prices were to adjust to
7:224:18557:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:reflect the change in consumer demand, the consumer surplus gains would be even greater.  In health cate-
7:225:18662:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:gories other than headache remedies, the effects are smaller though still economically significant.  In food
7:226:18770:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and drink categories, by contrast, information effects are quantitatively small, with effects on profits and
7:227:18878:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consumer surplus of a few percent in pantry staples and less than one percent in other food and drink prod-
7:228:18985:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ucts. Although these conclusions are contingent on the functional form and other assumptions embedded in
7:229:19089:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the model, together with the coefficient estimates they paint a consistent picture of the relative importance
7:230:19198:20:20:72:272:302:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of information in different product categories.
7:231:19245:20:21:88:539:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We stress three caveats to our welfare conclusions.  First, we consider the effect of consumer informa-
7:232:19348:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tion only on consumer choice and product pricing.  In the longer run, if consumers were to become better
7:233:19452:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:informed,  firms  would  adjust  their  advertising  expenditures  and  product  offerings,  leading  to  additional
7:234:19568:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:welfare effects.  Second, our model assumes that information per se does not affect the utility a consumer
7:235:19674:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:receives from a product.  If, for example, believing that national-brand aspirin works better actually makes
7:236:19782:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:national-brand aspirin more effective at reducing headaches, then informing consumers could actually make
7:237:19887:20:21:72:539:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:them worse off.5Third, while we refer to the welfare effects we calculate as effects of information, in fact
7:238:19995:21:20:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:they incorporate all of the ways in which experts make decisions differently from non-experts. A pharmacist
7:239:20102:20:33:72:540:119:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:differs from a non-pharmacist not only in knowing more facts about medications, but also in knowing which
7:240:20207:33:14:87:539:86:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:5This is a limitation of any revealed-preference evidence on the effect of information, but it is especially salient here as drugs
7:241:20337:14:0:72:443:72:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:are known to have brand-related placebo effects (Branthwaite and Cooper 1981; Kamenica et al. 2013).
8:242:20438:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:facts are relevant to a given situation, and in knowing what process to use to make good decisions about
8:243:20542:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:medication.  Our analysis is silent on which of these differences is the most important in driving shopping
8:244:20649:20:20:72:112:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:behavior.
8:245:20658:20:21:88:539:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The  primary  substantive  contribution  of  this  study  is  to  use  novel  data  and  methods  to  quantify  the
8:246:20773:21:20:72:539:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:importance  of  information  in  consumer  choice  in  an  important  real-world  market.6We  add  to  existing
8:247:20884:20:20:72:539:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:survey and experimental evidence7by exploiting multiple sources of variation in consumer information,
8:248:20985:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:including occupational expertise.8Our work complements concurrent research by Carrera and Villas-Boas
8:249:21086:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(2013), who use a field experiment to assess the impact of informative product labels on the propensity to
8:250:21192:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:purchase store-brand headache remedies. Although we focus on over-the-counter products, our findings are
8:251:21296:20:21:72:510:526:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:relevant to policy debates about substitution between branded and generic prescription medications.9
8:252:21396:21:20:88:539:505:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Methodologically, the approach of comparing the choices of demographically similar households with
8:253:21494:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:different levels of product information parallels that of Bartels’ (1996) study of the role of information in
8:254:21603:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:voting, and is close in spirit to recent work in economics by Levitt and Syverson (2008), Handel and Kolstad
8:255:21711:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(2014), and Johnson and Rehavi (2013).10Our model-based extrapolation of changes in prices and welfare
8:256:21813:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in a world of perfect consumer information builds on recent work that uses an equilibrium framework to
8:257:21915:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:evaluate the size and determinants of brand premia (Goldfarb et al.  2009) and relates to recent empirical
8:258:22021:21:20:72:513:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:work that studies equilibrium consequences of consumer misinformation (Grubb and Osborne 2015).
8:259:22116:20:20:88:539:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.  Section 2 describes our data.  Section 3 lays out
8:260:22218:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:our empirical strategy.  Section 4 presents our results for headache remedies and pantry staples.  Section 5
8:261:22326:21:16:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:presents our results for other health and food categories.  Section 6 presents evidence on aggregate effects
8:262:22434:16:14:87:539:306:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:6A sizable literature examines the demographic and attitudinal correlates of purchasing store-brand consumer packaged goods
8:263:22557:14:11:72:540:292:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:(e.g., Dick et al.  1995;  Richardson et al.  1996;  Burton et al.  1998;  Sethuraman and Cole 1999;  Kumar and Steenkamp 2007;
8:264:22684:11:11:72:540:281:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:Bergès et al. 2009; Steenkamp et al. 2010) and generic prescription drugs (e.g., Shrank et al. 2009). A literature on blind taste tests
8:265:22819:11:11:72:540:270:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:finds that consumers cannot distinguish among national brands (Husband and Godfrey 1934; Allison and Uhl 1964) or between
8:266:22940:11:11:72:540:259:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:national-brand and store-brand goods (Pronko and Bowles 1949), though there are exceptions (Mason and Batch 2009). Wills and
8:267:23064:11:11:72:540:248:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:Mueller (1989) and Caves and Greene (1996) use aggregate data to estimate the role of advertising and quality in brand premia.
8:268:23190:11:11:72:540:237:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:Sethuraman and Cole (1999) analyze the drivers of willingness to pay for national brands using hypothetical choices reported on a
8:269:23319:11:8:72:97:226:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:survey.
8:270:23326:8:14:87:539:218:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:7Existing evidence indicates that perceptions of similarity between national- and store-brand painkillers are correlated with
8:271:23451:14:11:72:540:204:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:stated purchase intentions (Cox et al.   1983;  Sullivan et al.   1994).   Cox et al.   (1983) find that informing consumers of active
8:272:23585:11:8:72:352:193:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:ingredient similarity does not have a discernible effect on purchase selections.
8:273:23665:8:14:87:539:185:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:8We are not aware of other research on the brand preferences of healthcare professionals.  An existing literature examines the
8:274:23791:14:11:72:540:171:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:health behaviors of doctors (Glanz et al.  1982), including their propensities to use certain categories of medications like sleeping
8:275:23924:11:11:72:540:160:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:pills (Domenighetti et al. 1991). Most studies of the relationship between occupation and store-brand purchases code occupation at
8:276:24054:11:11:72:540:149:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:a high level of aggregation (white collar, blue collar, etc.)  without reference to specific expertise (see Szymanski and Busch 1987
8:277:24186:11:11:72:540:138:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:for a review). An exception is Darden and Howell (1987), who study the effect of retail work experience on elements of “shopping
8:278:24314:11:8:72:250:127:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:orientation,” such as attitudes toward store clerks.
8:279:24366:8:14:87:539:119:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:9Purchases of branded prescription drugs with available generic alternatives are a significant component of health costs (Haas
8:280:24492:14:11:72:540:105:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:et al. 2005). A range of policies including mandatory substitution (NIHCM 2002) and financial incentives for physicians (Endsley
8:281:24620:11:8:72:446:94:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:et al. 2006) and patients (Huskamp et al. 2003) have been used in an effort to increase the generic share.
8:282:24726:8:15:84:539:86:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:10At a broader level, our approach also relates to recent efforts to develop modes of welfare analysis that do not assume rational
8:283:24856:15:0:72:395:71:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:consumers (e.g., Bernheim and Rangel 2009; Green and Hojman 2007; Spinnewijn 2013).
9:284:24940:0:45:72:219:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and welfare. Section 7 concludes.

9:286:24982:31:20:72:540:633:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The backbone of our data is the Nielsen Homescan Panel, which includes purchasing behavior for a panel
9:287:25084:20:21:72:540:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of households from 2004 to 2011.  To this we add data on occupation and product knowledge from two
9:288:25182:21:20:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:custom surveys administered to Nielsen Homescan panelists in September 2008 and October 2011.   We
9:289:25280:20:20:72:540:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:classify products using product-level information supplied by Nielsen.  We measure prices and aggregate
9:290:25383:20:21:72:540:552:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:expenditures using store-level data from 2008, also supplied by Nielsen.  Finally, we measure wholesale
9:291:25486:21:20:72:540:531:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:prices using data from National Promotion Reports’ PRICE-TRAK database. We now discuss each dataset
9:292:25585:20:37:72:104:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in turn.

9:294:25626:28:20:72:540:446:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We obtained data from the Nielsen Homescan Panel through a partnership between the Nielsen Company
9:295:25724:20:20:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and the James M. Kilts Center for Marketing at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.11The
9:296:25827:20:21:72:539:406:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:data include purchases made on more than 77 million shopping trips by 125,114 households from 2004 to
9:297:25928:21:20:72:540:385:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:2011.  Panelist households are given optical scanners and are asked to scan the barcodes of all consumer
9:298:26032:20:20:72:371:365:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:packaged goods they purchase, regardless of outlet or store format.12
9:299:26101:20:21:88:539:345:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:For each purchase, we observe the date, the universal product classification (UPC) code, the transaction
9:300:26205:21:20:72:540:324:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:price, an identifier for the store chain in which the purchase was made, and the size of the item, which we
9:301:26312:20:20:72:540:304:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:convert to equivalent units specific to a given product category (e.g., pill counts for headache remedies or
9:302:26420:20:21:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:pounds for salt). We compute the share of purchases going to store brand or national brand products as the
9:303:26526:21:20:72:328:263:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:share weighted by equivalent units unless otherwise noted.
9:304:26584:20:20:88:539:243:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Nielsen supplies household demographic characteristics including the education of the household head,
9:305:26685:20:21:72:540:223:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a categorical measure of household income,  number of adults,  race,  age,  household composition,  home

9:311:27298:8:14:84:539:119:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:12The data include purchases from supermarkets, convenience stores, mass merchandisers, club stores, drug stores, and other

10:320:28177:21:20:88:540:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:A variety of studies have considered the representativeness of the Homescan panel.14Aguiar and Hurst
10:321:28277:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(2007) find that Homescan panelists in Denver, CO are similar to a comparable sample of the Panel Study
10:322:28380:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of Income Dynamics.  Harding et al.  (2012) find that the demographic characteristics of cigarette smokers
10:323:28486:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in Homescan are similar to those in datasets such as the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System or the
10:324:28592:20:20:72:539:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.15Lusk and Brooks (2011) find that, relative to a random
10:325:28697:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:digit dial sample, Homescan panelists are older, more educated, and more likely to be white, and that, even
10:326:28804:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:after controlling for demographics, Homescan panelists are more price-sensitive in a hypothetical choice
10:327:28908:20:20:72:539:485:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:experiment.16Consistent  with  these  findings,  we  show  in  the  online  appendix  that  Homescan  panelists
10:328:29019:20:21:72:403:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:purchase more store-brand products than others who shop in the same store.
10:329:29093:21:20:88:539:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In light of the selection of the Homescan panel there are two reasonable ways to interpret our estimates.
10:330:29198:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:First, we may think of the estimates as internally valid for the sample of Homescan panelists, or the popula-
10:331:29307:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tion that they represent.  Second, we may think of the estimates as valid for the entire population under the
10:332:29416:21:37:72:356:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:strong assumption that the effect of information is homogeneous.

10:334:29505:27:21:72:540:319:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We conducted two surveys of Homescan panelists as part of Nielsen’s monthly PanelViews survey. The first
10:335:29609:21:20:72:539:298:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:survey was sent electronically to 75,221 households in September of 2008 with the request that each adult in
10:336:29717:20:20:72:540:278:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the household complete the survey separately. In total, 80,077 individuals in 48,951 households responded
10:337:29822:20:20:72:539:258:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to the survey for a household response rate of 65.1 percent.  The second survey was sent electronically to
10:338:29928:20:21:72:540:238:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:90,393 households in October 2011 with the request that each adult in the household complete the survey
10:339:30031:21:20:72:539:217:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:separately.   In  total,  80,205  individuals  in  56,258  households  responded  to  the  survey  for  a  household
10:340:30147:20:23:71:539:197:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:response  rate  of  62.2  percent.   We  show  in  the  online  appendix  that  the  administration  of  the  survey  is
10:341:30267:23:14:84:539:174:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:14See also Zhen et al.  (2009) for a comparison of expenditure data between the Consumer Expenditure Survey and the Home-
10:342:30388:14:11:72:540:160:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:scan panel.  Einav et al.  (2010) find that Homescan panelists are more accurate in recording quantities than in recording prices.
10:343:30518:11:8:72:522:149:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:Accordingly, we draw on the store-level data described below for much of the pricing information that we use in our analysis.

10:346:30799:8:15:84:539:119:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:16Nielsen provides projection factors to aggregate their panelists into a representative population.  These projection factors are
10:347:30929:15:11:72:540:104:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:designed to match the sample frequencies of nine demographic characteristics to the corresponding population frequencies.  Muth
10:348:31056:11:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:et al.  (2007) provide more detail on the construction of the projection factors.  As the projection factors are not designed for the
10:349:31189:11:10:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:subpopulations that we study, we do not use them in our main analysis. In appendix table 1 we show our core results in specifications
10:350:31322:10:0:72:204:72:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:that weight by the projection factors.
11:351:31361:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:not associated with any changes in the likelihood of purchasing the store brand.  The online appendix also
11:352:31467:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:compares  the  demographics  of  respondents  to  non-respondents.   Notably,  we  find  that,  relative  to  non-
11:353:31581:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:responding households, households that responded to the survey tend to be smaller, higher-income, more
11:354:31683:20:21:72:239:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:educated, and more likely to be white.
11:355:31721:21:20:88:539:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Both surveys asked for the respondent’s current or most recent occupation, classified according to the
11:356:31823:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:2002 Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) codes (BLS 2002).17We match these to data on the median earnings
11:357:31925:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of full-time full-year workers in each occupation in 1999 from the US Census (2000). We group occupations
11:358:32030:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:into categories (healthcare, food preparer) using a combination of BLS-provided hierarchies and subjective
11:359:32136:20:20:72:386:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:judgment. The online appendix lists the occupations in these groupings.
11:360:32207:20:21:88:539:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The first survey included a set of additional questions relating to household migration patterns.  These
11:361:32311:21:20:72:530:505:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:questions were used in the analysis of Bronnenberg et al. (2012). We ignore them in the present analysis.
11:362:32416:20:20:88:539:485:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The second survey, designed for this study, included a series of questions about households’ knowledge
11:363:32518:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and attitudes toward various products.  In particular, for each of five national brands of headache remedy
11:364:32624:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(Advil, Aleve, Bayer, Excedrin, Tylenol), we asked each respondent who indicated familiarity with a na-
11:365:32727:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tional brand to identify its active ingredient from a list of six possible choices, or state “don’t know / not
11:366:32837:20:21:72:539:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sure.”18For each respondent we calculate the number of correct responses, treating “don’t know” as in-
11:367:32939:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:correct. We also asked respondents whether they agreed or disagreed with a series of statements, including
11:368:33045:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:“Store-brand products for headache remedies / pain relievers are just as safe as the brand name products,”
11:369:33151:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:with responses on a 1 (agree) to 7 (disagree) scale. For each respondent, we construct an indicator equal to
11:370:33259:21:20:72:424:322:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:one if the respondent chose the strongest possible agreement and zero otherwise.
11:371:33339:20:20:88:539:302:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The  second  survey  also  asked  respondents  about  their  college  major  using  codes  from  the  National
11:372:33449:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Center  for  Education  Statistics  (U.S.  Department  of  Education  2012).   We  define  two  groups  of  majors
11:373:33563:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for analysis:  health majors, which includes all majors with the word “health” in their description,19and
11:374:33668:20:20:72:476:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:non-health science majors, which includes all majors in the physical and biological sciences.
11:375:33761:20:21:88:539:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Both surveys asked respondents to indicate whether they are their household’s “primary shopper” and
11:376:33860:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:whether they are the “head of the household.”  For each household we identify a single primary shopper
11:377:33962:20:28:72:539:180:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:whose characteristics we use in the analysis,  following the criteria used in Bronnenberg et al.  (2012).20
11:378:34069:28:14:84:539:152:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:17In the small number of cases where an individual provided conflicting responses to the occupation question across the two
11:379:34192:14:8:72:248:138:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:surveys we use the value from the second survey.
11:380:34240:8:14:84:539:130:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:18The correct active ingredients are ibuprofen (Advil), naproxen (Aleve), aspirin (Bayer), aspirin-acetaminophen-caffeine (Ex-
11:381:34366:14:11:72:540:116:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:cedrin),  and acetaminophen (Tylenol).   In each case,  the six possible answers were the five correct active ingredients plus the
11:382:34496:11:8:72:157:105:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:analgesic hydrocodone.
11:383:34518:8:11:84:384:97:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:19Examples include “Health: medicine,” “Health: nursing,” and “Health: dentistry.”
11:384:34600:11:14:84:539:86:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:20We start with all individuals within a household who respond to the survey.  We then apply the following criteria in order,
11:385:34725:14:0:72:540:72:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:stopping at the point when only a single individual is left: (i) keep only self-reported primary shopper(s) if at least one exists; (ii)
12:386:34863:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In appendix table 1 and the online appendix,  we show that our findings go largely unchanged when we
12:387:34963:21:20:72:415:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:incorporate data on the characteristics of secondary shoppers into our analysis.
12:388:35043:20:20:88:539:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Throughout the paper, we restrict attention to households in which at least one member answered the
12:389:35142:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:occupation question in one or both of our PanelViews surveys.  The online appendix reports the number of
12:390:35246:21:37:72:471:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:households whose primary shopper works in each healthcare and food preparer occupation.
12:391:35333:37:27:72:211:590:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:2.3    Product Classification
12:392:35362:27:21:72:540:563:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Nielsen provides a set of attribute variables for each UPC code purchased by a Homescan panelist.  Some
12:393:35465:21:20:72:540:542:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of these, such as size, are available for all categories.  Others are category-specific.  For example the data
12:394:35575:20:20:72:540:522:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:include a variable that encodes the active ingredient for each headache remedy in the data.   We harmo-
12:395:35678:20:21:72:540:502:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:nize the codes for essentially identical descriptors (e.g., “ACET” and “ACETAMINOPHEN” both become
12:396:35776:21:20:72:180:481:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:“ACETAMINOPHEN”).
12:397:35793:20:20:88:539:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We  use  these  descriptors  to  aggregate  UPCs  intoproducts.   A  product  is  a  group  of  UPCs  that  are
12:398:35904:20:21:72:540:441:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:identical on all non-size attributes provided by Nielsen.  For instance, in the case of headache remedies, a
12:399:36012:21:20:72:540:420:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:product is a combination of an active ingredient (e.g., aspirin, naproxen), form (e.g., tablet, gelcap), formula
12:400:36124:20:20:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(e.g., regular strength, extra strength), and brand (e.g., Bayer, Aleve, store brand).  We classify products as
12:401:36235:20:21:72:434:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:store brands using Nielsen-provided codes, supplemented with manual corrections.
12:402:36315:21:20:88:540:359:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To compare store brands and national brands we aggregate products intocomparable product groups,
12:403:36411:20:20:72:539:339:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:which are sets of products that are identical on all product attributes except for brand and item size.21We
12:404:36518:20:21:72:531:319:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:will use the abbreviated termcomparableto stand in forcomparable product groupthroughout the paper.
12:405:36617:21:20:88:539:298:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We  restrict  attention  to  comparables  in  which  we  observe  at  least  500  average  annual  purchases  in
12:406:36729:20:20:71:539:278:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Homescan,  with  at  least  some  purchases  going  to  both  store-brand  and  national-brand  products.22We
12:407:36838:20:20:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:eliminate  categories  in  which  the  available  attribute  descriptors  do  not  provide  sufficient  information  to
12:408:36957:20:21:72:540:238:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:identify comparable products.23We also eliminate categories in which the average retail price per equivalent
12:409:37065:21:20:72:540:217:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:unit for national-brand products is lower than store-brand products.24This leaves us with a universe of 420
12:410:37172:20:20:72:130:197:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:comparables.
12:411:37184:20:28:88:539:177:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We analyze headache remedies and pantry staples in detail.  We chose these two case studies because
12:412:37283:28:10:72:540:149:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:keep only household head(s) if at least one exists; (iii) keep only the female household head if both a female and a male head exist;
12:413:37416:10:11:72:540:139:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:(iv) keep the oldest individual;  (v) drop responses that appear to be duplicate responses by the same individual;  (vi) select one
12:414:37547:11:8:72:150:128:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:respondent randomly.
12:415:37567:8:12:84:421:120:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:21In appendix table 1 we show the robustness of our main results to conditioning on item size.
12:416:37661:12:14:84:539:108:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:22We further eliminate comparable product groups in which fewer than 50 retail chains ever sell a store brand according to the
12:417:37787:14:8:72:254:94:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:retail scanner data we discuss in section 2.4 below.
12:418:37839:8:11:84:498:86:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:23These are: deli products, fresh produce, nutritional supplements, miscellaneous vitamins, and anti-sleep products.
12:419:37955:11:0:84:539:75:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:24Retail prices are from retail scanner data we discuss in section 2.4 below. We exclude 34 comparables based on this condition.
13:420:38085:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:they have both sufficient purchase volume and a sufficient number of expert households (healthcare workers
13:421:38191:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and  food  preparers)  to  permit  reliable  analysis,  and  because  our  prior  was  that  the  scope  for  horizontal
13:422:38311:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:differentiation between national and store brands in these categories would be especially small. Our universe
13:423:38420:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of headache remedies consists of the comparables classified by Nielsen as adult,  non-migraine,  daytime
13:424:38524:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:headache remedies. Our universe of pantry staples consists of the comparables classified by Nielsen as table
13:425:38632:20:20:72:188:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:salt, sugar, or baking soda.
13:426:38660:20:21:88:539:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We restrict our sample to transactions such that at least one comparable national-brand purchase and
13:427:38760:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:at least one comparable store-brand purchase are observed in the Homescan data in the same retail chain

13:429:38973:20:21:72:388:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:purchased because no store-brand alternative is available (or vice versa).

14:465:42123:32:20:71:539:385:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In this section we lay out a stylized model of choice by uninformed and informed households.  The model
14:466:42226:20:37:71:530:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:clarifies the assumptions necessary to identify the effect of information on household choice and welfare.
14:467:42332:37:28:71:267:328:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:3.1    Choice Model and Interpretation
14:468:42370:28:20:71:539:300:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Let there be a set of households indexed byi. Each household must choose between a national brand and a
14:469:42473:20:20:71:540:280:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:store brand of some product. At the store where householdishops, the national brand costs∆pi>0 dollars
14:470:42575:20:20:72:186:260:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:more than the store brand.
14:471:42601:20:21:88:540:240:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Householdibelieves that the national brand delivers∆vi≥0 more money-metric utility than the store
14:472:42698:21:20:71:539:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:brand, but the true difference is∆ ̃vi≥0, which may be greater or lesser than∆vi.  The household buys the
14:473:42803:20:20:71:540:199:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:national brand if and only if∆vi≥∆pi.  We refer to the counterfactual in which the household buys the
14:474:42904:20:21:71:327:179:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f4:B:national brand if and only if∆ ̃vi≥∆piasinformed choice.
14:475:42960:21:20:88:539:158:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:If∆vi,∆ ̃vi≥∆pior∆pi>∆vi,∆ ̃vithen the household’s decision is identical under informed choice so
14:476:43057:20:52:71:540:138:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:its welfare does not change.  If∆vi≥∆pi>∆ ̃vithen under informed choice the household switches from
14:477:43156:52:14:84:539:86:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:26We compute the median rather than the mean retail margin to avoid the influence of outlier observations that arise due to

15:479:43307:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the national brand to the store brand and gains∆pi−∆ ̃vi. If∆ ̃vi≥∆pi>∆vithen under informed choice the
15:480:43410:21:20:71:432:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:household switches from the store brand to the national brand and gains∆ ̃vi−∆pi.
15:481:43491:20:20:88:539:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The model does not specify why there is a gap between true and perceived brand utility.  However it is
15:482:43593:20:30:71:405:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:general enough to be consistent with several intuitive reasons for such a gap:
15:483:43671:30:20:85:539:618:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:1.Perceptions of quality.   Let∆qibe the perceived quality difference between the two products and
15:484:43769:20:20:99:540:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:let∆ ̃qibe  the  true  difference  in  quality  (say,  clinically  efficacy  for  a  medication).   Letmibe  the
15:485:43881:20:21:99:539:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f8:A:household’s marginal utility of money in units of quality. Then we can write∆vi=∆qi/miand∆ ̃vi=
15:486:43976:21:29:99:133:557:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f3:A:∆ ̃qi/mi.
15:487:43985:29:20:85:539:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:2.Perceptions of failure risk.The product may succeed, delivering valuev, or it may fail, delivering
15:488:44085:20:21:99:540:508:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:valuev. These values are the same for the national and store brands but the risk of failure is different.
15:489:44190:21:20:99:539:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:A household perceives that the national brand’s risk of failure is lower by∆ribut in fact it is lower by
15:490:44294:20:29:99:312:467:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f3:A:∆ ̃ri. Then∆vi=∆ri(v−v)and∆ ̃vi=∆ ̃ri(v−v).
15:491:44337:29:21:85:540:438:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:3.Attention to irrelevant factors.  The national and store brand differ by amounts∆x1and∆x2in each
15:492:44435:21:20:99:540:417:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:of two dimensions (say, taste and packaging).  Utility is a weighted average of the two dimensions.
15:493:44534:20:20:99:539:397:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f8:A:Householdiattaches weightωito the second dimension but the correct weight is 0.   Then∆vi=
15:494:44624:20:30:99:257:377:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f3:A:(1−ωi)∆x1+ωi∆x2and∆ ̃vi=∆x1.
15:495:44652:30:20:72:540:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Different microfoundations may be appropriate for different product categories.   For example,  we might
15:496:44756:20:20:72:540:327:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:expect that perceptions of failure risk are especially important for medications, whereas attention to factors
15:497:44866:20:20:72:327:307:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:like packaging is especially important for food and drinks.
15:498:44925:20:21:88:539:287:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Note that, while our framework accommodates many reasons for a departure between true and perceived
15:499:45024:21:20:72:540:266:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:brand utility, it cannot accommodate cases in which information affects utility directly. Suppose, for exam-
15:500:45132:20:20:72:540:246:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ple, that the true utility informed consumers receive from the national brand and the store brand is the same.
15:501:45242:20:21:72:539:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Denote this∆ ̃vin f ormedi=0.  Uninformed consumers receive the same true utility from the store brand, but
15:502:45349:21:20:72:540:205:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:they receive an additional placebo benefit from the national brand,  so∆ ̃vunin f ormedi>∆pi>0.   For both
15:503:45455:20:20:72:539:185:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:types, perceived and true utility are equal. In this case, providing information to a consumeriwould cause
15:504:45561:20:21:72:540:165:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:her to lose the value of the placebo effect, and she would suffer a welfarelossof∆ ̃vunin f ormedi−∆piinstead
15:505:45670:21:37:72:214:144:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of reaping a welfare gain of∆pi.

15:507:45759:27:0:72:520:80:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We now consider how to recover the effect of informed choice on the aggregate welfare of households.
16:508:45861:0:21:88:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Begin with the special case in which∆ ̃vi=0 for alli.  This would be an appropriate assumption if we
16:509:45961:21:20:71:539:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:knew that national and store brands were identical in all respects except for the brand itself, and if we were
16:510:46071:20:20:71:539:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:prepared to assume away any psychic benefit of brands. In this case any household buying the national brand
16:511:46178:20:21:71:540:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:would switch to the store brand under informed choice, gaining welfare∆pi. We can compute the aggregate
16:512:46281:21:20:71:539:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:gain in household welfare from informed choice by aggregating the price premia paid by all households who
16:513:46386:20:20:71:171:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:buy the national brand.
16:514:46409:20:21:88:540:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Identification is more difficult in the more general case in which∆ ̃viis not known. Because choices are
16:515:46513:21:20:71:539:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:based on perceived utility∆vi, we cannot use price variation to recover true utility∆ ̃vi. Our approach in this
16:516:46624:20:20:72:539:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:paper is to parametrize the relationship between∆ ̃viand∆viby assuming that more informed households
16:517:46724:20:21:72:383:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:act according to∆ ̃viand less informed households act according to∆vi.
16:518:46794:21:20:88:539:505:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f8:A:Letφi∈[0,1]be an index of householdi’s information.  Suppose that, for alli,∆ ̃vi=∆ ̃vand∆vi=
16:519:46887:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f3:B:φi∆ ̃v+ (1−φi)∆v, where∆ ̃v≥0 and∆v≥0 are constants representing perceived utility from the national
16:520:46987:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:brand for perfectly informed and perfectly uninformed households, respectively.  Suppose further that all
16:521:47092:21:20:72:457:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:households shop in the same store, so that, for alli,∆pi=∆pfor some constant∆p>0.

16:528:47695:20:20:88:539:302:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:From  the  sign  of  the  cross-sectional  relationship  betweenyiandφi,  it  is  therefore  possible  to  learn
16:529:47807:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:whether households as a whole are buying too much of the national brand, too much of the store brand,
16:530:47908:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:or the right brand.  This argument motivates our descriptive analysis of the relationship between household
16:531:48015:20:20:72:391:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:information and the propensity to buy the store brand in sections 4 and 5.
16:532:48089:20:21:88:540:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Notice that the cross-sectional relationship betweenyiandφidoes not tell us how much households
16:533:48184:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:would gain from informed choice.  To recover that quantity, suppose that we observe choices by a large
16:534:48286:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:number of households in whichφi=1 and that we can vary the prices paid∆p.  Then we can learn∆ ̃vby
16:535:48384:20:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:finding the price gap at which informed households switch brands.  Once we know∆ ̃v, we can compute
16:536:48483:21:20:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the aggregate welfare gain from informed choice at current prices by aggregating the welfare gains across
16:537:48588:20:20:72:540:119:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:all  households  that  buy  a  different  brand  from  the  one  chosen  by  informed  households.   This  argument
16:538:48703:20:20:72:540:99:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:motivates the structural analysis in section 6, in which we use a combination of functional form and conduct
16:539:48811:20:0:72:289:79:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:assumptions to recover the necessary magnitudes.
17:540:48861:0:28:72:262:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:3.3    Estimation and Implementation
17:541:48897:28:20:72:540:681:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Here we flesh out the practical implications of the preceding discussion for our descriptive analysis of the
17:542:49005:20:21:72:490:661:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:effect of information on brand choice. We defer details of our structural exercise until section 6.
17:543:49104:21:20:88:498:640:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To execute the cross-sectional test that we describe above, we need to ensure three conditions.
17:544:49199:20:20:88:540:620:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:First, we need to observe variation in household informationφi.  We form a vectorKiof proxies forφi,
17:545:49299:20:21:72:539:600:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:including knowledge of active ingredients, completed schooling, college major, and occupation.27These
17:546:49400:21:20:71:539:579:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:measures are proxies in the sense that we do not know how the units ofKimap toφi.   We cannot say,
17:547:49498:20:20:71:539:559:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for example, that completing college closes the gap between true and perceived preferences by some given
17:548:49602:20:21:71:540:539:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:number of percentage points, as we could if we measuredφidirectly.  These measures are also proxies in
17:549:49704:21:20:72:539:518:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the sense that the correlation of an element ofKiwith choiceyireflects both a direct causal effect (e.g.,
17:550:49809:20:20:72:540:498:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:knowing that Tylenol’s active ingredient is acetaminophen directly affects choice) and an indirect effect of
17:551:49917:20:21:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:information correlated withKi(e.g., consumers who know Tylenol’s active ingredient also tend to be well
17:552:50020:21:20:72:333:457:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:informed about other characteristics of headache remedies).
17:553:50079:20:20:88:540:437:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Second, we need to compare more to less informed households while holding constant prices∆piand
17:554:50174:20:21:71:539:417:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:any other contextual drivers of choice (e.g., in-store displays or shelf position). We do this by assuming that
17:555:50285:21:20:71:539:396:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:all such drivers are a function of observable store and time characteristicsZi. In our preferred specifications,
17:556:50397:20:20:71:539:376:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:B:Ziwill include interacted indicators for market, chain, and calendar quarter.  In appendix table 1, we show
17:557:50504:20:21:71:439:356:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that our results survive even richer controls for the timing and location of purchases.
17:558:50591:21:20:88:539:335:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Third, we need to compare more and less informed households with identical true preferences∆ ̃vi. This
17:559:50693:20:20:72:540:315:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consideration means we need to exclude cases in which the national and store brand differ on horizontal
17:560:50796:20:21:72:540:295:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:attributes (e.g., cherry vs.  orange flavor) over which households may have different preference orderings.
17:561:50903:21:20:72:540:274:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We therefore focus on brand choice within comparable product groups that are homogeneous on measured
17:562:51003:20:20:72:540:254:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:attributes.   We show empirically that preferences for measured attributes (e.g.,  tablet vs.   caplet) do not
17:563:51113:20:21:72:539:234:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:correlate with our information proxiesKi, which supports our assumption that preferences for unmeasured
17:564:51216:21:20:72:275:213:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:horizontal attributes are not correlated withKi.
17:565:51264:20:20:88:539:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:This consideration also means we need to hold constant households’ willingness to pay for quality. In-
17:566:51366:20:21:71:539:173:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:come is the most obvious source of heterogeneity in willingness-to-pay for quality.  We control for income
17:567:51472:21:33:71:539:152:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in our analysis and we find that doing so often strengthens our results.  We also show that a relationship
17:568:51578:33:15:84:539:119:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:27Past purchase experience may also serve as a proxy for a household’s knowledge of the category.   As past purchases are
17:569:51699:15:11:72:540:104:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:endogenous both to preferences and to the choice environment, we do not include this proxy in our main analysis. In appendix table
17:570:51829:11:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:1 we show that our core findings are unchanged if we estimate specifications that control for average annual purchase volume.  In
17:571:51958:11:11:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:these specifications, higher purchase volume is consistently associated with a statistically significant increase in the propensity to
17:572:52092:11:0:72:130:71:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:buy store brand.
18:573:52110:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:between information and choice is present even among occupational groups that are similar in socioeco-
18:574:52212:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:nomic status (e.g., lawyers and physicians).  We further control for a range of demographic characteristics
18:575:52319:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(e.g., age and household composition).  We expect that any remaining preference heterogeneity will work
18:576:52422:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:against our main findings:  if national brands are of higher quality and more informed households have a
18:577:52526:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:stronger preference for quality (physicians have if anything a greater taste for high-quality medicine, and
18:578:52633:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:chefs have if anything a greater taste for high-quality food), our estimates will tend to understate the effect
18:579:52744:20:21:72:183:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of information on choice.
18:580:52769:21:20:88:539:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To describe the relationships among choiceyi, informationKi, household characteristicsXiand choice
18:581:52867:20:37:72:427:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:environmentZi, we will estimate linear probability models of the following form:
18:582:52947:37:37:210:540:509:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Pr(yi=1|Ki,Xi,Zi) =α+Kiβ+Xiγ+Ziρ,(1)
18:583:52983:37:20:72:539:472:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:whereα,β,γ, andρare vectors of parameters.28Although for notational ease we have written the model
18:584:53081:20:20:72:540:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:at the level of the household, a given household can make multiple purchases.  We therefore estimate the
18:585:53185:20:21:72:540:432:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:model at the level of the purchase occasion, reporting standard errors that allow for correlation at the level
18:586:53295:21:20:72:540:411:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the household, and weighting transactions by purchase volume.  Appendix table 1 shows that our main
18:587:53397:20:44:72:500:391:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:conclusions are unaffected if we estimate binary logit models instead of linear probability models.
18:588:53496:44:32:72:171:347:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:4    Case Studies
18:589:53513:32:28:72:201:315:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:4.1    Headache Remedies
18:590:53537:28:20:72:540:287:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We  begin  our  analysis  with  a  case  study  of  adult,  non-migraine,  daytime  headache  remedies.   The  first
18:591:53653:20:20:72:540:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rows of table 1 show summary statistics for the six comparables in this category. These products span four
18:592:53759:20:21:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:active ingredients, each associated with a familiar national brand: aspirin (Bayer), acetaminophen (Tylenol),
18:593:53868:21:20:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ibuprofen (Advil), and naproxen (Aleve). We estimate total annual expenditure on these comparables to be
18:594:53972:20:20:72:513:206:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:$2.88 billion. Store-brand purchases account for 74 percent of pills and 53 percent of expenditures.29
18:595:54074:20:21:88:539:186:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:On average, the per-pill price of a store brand is 40 percent of the price of a comparable national brand.
18:596:54180:21:20:72:540:165:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:For aspirin, a mature product that has been off patent since 1917, the per-pill price of store brands is 22
18:597:54287:20:20:72:540:145:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:percent of the national-brand price. These price differences are not due to differences in where these products
18:598:54398:20:28:72:540:125:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are sold or to volume discounts: among cases in our panel in which we observe at least one national-brand
18:599:54503:28:11:84:462:97:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:28When we pool data across multiple comparables, we will allow the interceptαto differ by comparable.
18:600:54604:11:14:84:539:86:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:29Among households with multiple headache remedy purchases, 31 percent bought only store brands and 16 percent bought
18:601:54721:14:0:72:408:72:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:only national brands. The remaining 52 percent bought both store brands and national brands.
19:602:54815:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and one store-brand purchase for the same active ingredient and package size in the same market, chain, and
19:603:54922:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:week, the per-pill price paid for store brands is on average 26 percent of the price of an equivalent national
19:604:55032:20:20:72:498:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:brand. The median gap is 31 percent, and the national brand is cheaper in only 5 percent of cases.
19:605:55130:20:21:88:539:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Store-brand alternatives for national-brand headache remedies are widely available.  Using our store-
19:606:55231:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:level data, we estimate that 82 percent of national-brand headache remedy purchase volume is purchased
19:607:55333:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:when a store brand with the same active ingredient and form and at least as many pills is sold in the same
19:608:55439:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:store and quarter at a lower price.30In our PanelViews survey data, only 3.6 percent of households report
19:609:55544:21:20:72:359:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that no store-brand alternative was available at their last purchase.
19:610:55613:20:20:88:539:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In figure 1 we look at the relationship between knowledge of active ingredients and our indirect knowl-
19:611:55716:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:edge  proxies—completed  schooling,  occupation,  and  college  major.   The  relationships  are  as  expected.
19:612:55827:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Panel A shows that shoppers with a college education correctly identify the active ingredient in 62 percent
19:613:55934:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of cases, as against 52 percent for those with a high school degree or less.  Panel B shows that nurses cor-
19:614:56042:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rectly identify the active ingredient in 85 percent of cases, pharmacists in 89 percent, and physicians and
19:615:56149:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:surgeons in 90 percent.  Panel C shows that shoppers whose college major is health or science related are
19:616:56254:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:more informed than other shoppers.  In the online appendix, we confirm these relationships in a regression
19:617:56360:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:framework, showing that they remain strong even after controlling for a rich set of household characteristics,
19:618:56470:21:20:72:151:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:including income.
19:619:56487:20:20:88:539:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Having validated our proxies, we turn to our main question of interest:  the impact of information on
19:620:56588:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the share of purchases that go to store brands.  Figure 2 shows that greater knowledge of active ingredients
19:621:56696:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:predicts more purchases of store brands. Those who can name no active ingredients buy just over 60 percent
19:622:56802:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:store brands.  Those who can name all five active ingredients buy nearly 85 percent store brands.  Though
19:623:56907:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:these differences are large, they could be due to reverse causality: those interested in saving money buy store
19:624:57018:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:brands and also take the time to read ingredient labels. By contrast, while demographic characteristics like
19:625:57126:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:completed schooling may be correlated with unobserved product preferences, such characteristics are most
19:626:57230:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:likely not determined by households’ preferences for store-brand vs. national-brand products. We therefore
19:627:57336:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:turn next to examining variation in information induced by completed schooling, occupation, and college
19:628:57439:20:20:72:100:180:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:major.
19:629:57445:20:21:88:539:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Figure 3 shows the relationship between store-brand share and completed schooling.  With no controls,
19:630:57546:21:31:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:we see that those with education beyond high school buy more store brands than those with a high school
19:631:57649:31:15:84:539:108:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:30The analogous estimates at the store-month and store-week level are 77 percent and 62 percent, respectively. These statistics
19:632:57776:15:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:can underestimate the availability of store-brand alternatives because a store-brand can be available but not purchased in a given
19:633:57906:11:11:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:time period (Handbury and Weinstein 2015). These statistics can also overstate availability because a product can be purchased but
19:634:58036:11:0:72:399:71:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:not available throughout the entire time period, for example due to stockouts (Matsa 2011).

20:636:58236:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:more than a college degree. The main confound here is income, which is strongly negatively correlated with
20:637:58342:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:store-brand purchases.31This is consistent with the “perceptions of quality” example in section 3, in which
20:638:58449:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:households differ in both the marginal utility of money and in the perceived quality gain from the national
20:639:58556:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:brand. After controlling for income, we find a monotonic positive relationship between completed schooling
20:640:58662:20:20:72:169:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and store-brand share.

20:642:58795:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:relationship between store-brand share and median occupational income among non-healthcare occupations.
20:643:58898:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Households whose primary shopper is a healthcare professional buy far more store brands than others of
20:644:59000:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:similar income.  Pharmacists, physicians, and nurses buy more store brands than lawyers, who have high
20:645:59102:21:20:72:314:505:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:levels of schooling but different occupational expertise.
20:646:59159:20:20:88:539:485:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Pharmacists,  who stand out in the survey data in figure 1 as among the most informed about active
20:647:59257:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ingredients,  also  stand  out  for  having  the  largest  store-brand  share  among  large  healthcare  occupations.
20:648:59374:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Only 8.5 percent of volume bought by pharmacists are national-brand headache remedies, an amount small
20:649:59476:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:enough to be explained by the occasional stock outs of store brands, and the fact that some purchases are
20:650:59581:20:21:72:369:404:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:made by the non-pharmacist member of a pharmacist’s household.32

20:657:60278:32:14:84:539:250:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:31The online appendix presents a plot of a household’s store-brand share of purchases against annual household income and
20:658:60399:14:8:72:213:236:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:confirms a strong negative relationship.
20:659:60439:8:14:84:539:228:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:32The fact that 8.5 percent of purchases by households whose primary shopper is a pharmacist are to national-brand goods
20:660:60559:14:11:72:522:214:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:suggests at first that 8.5 percent of the time a pharmacist is willing to pay a significant price premium to buy a national brand.
20:661:60689:11:11:80:308:203:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:There are three main reasons to interpret the finding differently.
20:662:60755:11:11:80:539:192:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:First, the primary shopper need not be the only shopper in the household.  In the small number of cases (12 households, 37
20:663:60877:11:11:72:540:181:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:transactions) in which a household with both a primary shopper and a secondary shopper who are pharmacists buy a headache
20:664:60998:11:11:72:539:170:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:remedy, only 1.6 percent of purchases are to national brands. In the case of single-person households in which the only person is a
20:665:61129:11:11:72:419:159:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:pharmacist (22 households, 109 transactions), only 5 percent of purchases are to national brands.
20:666:61226:11:11:80:539:148:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:Second, although we have focused on transactions in retailers who stock both national brands and store brands, some stockouts
20:667:61351:11:11:72:540:137:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:may nevertheless occur.  Matsa (2011) estimates the stockout rate for over-the-counter drugs to be 2.8 percent.  In the face of a
20:668:61480:11:11:72:518:126:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:stockout of the store brand, pharmacists who are unable to delay their purchase may switch to buying a national-brand good.
20:669:61603:11:11:80:539:115:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:Third, although the average price premium for national brands is very large in this category, there is some price variation, and
20:670:61731:11:11:72:540:104:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:pharmacists may be buying when the price difference is unusually small.  In the Homescan data, we find that, for purchases made
20:671:61858:11:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:by households in which the primary shopper is a pharmacist, the ratio of the average store-brand price to the average national-brand
20:672:61990:11:11:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:price is 6 percent greater than for the average purchase. For purchases made by households in which the only person is a pharmacist,
20:673:62122:11:0:72:307:71:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:the price ratio is 14 percent greater than for the average purchase.

21:676:62350:20:20:88:539:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Column (2) shows that a 10 percent increase in household income reduces the propensity to purchase
21:677:62448:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the store-brand by 0.3 percentage points.  Because income and education are positively correlated but have
21:678:62554:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:opposite effects on store-brand purchasing,  the effect of education gets larger when income controls are
21:679:62659:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:added.  In the preferred specification, column (4), college education increases the propensity to buy store
21:680:62766:20:21:72:539:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:brand by 2.6 percentage points. The effect of knowledge of active ingredients is fairly stable across specifi-
21:681:62876:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cations; column (4) shows that going from knowledge of no active ingredients to knowledge of all increases
21:682:62982:20:20:72:273:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the store-brand share by 19 percentage points.
21:683:63028:20:21:88:540:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Column (5) of table 2 augments the specification in column (4) by adding toKian indicator for whether
21:684:63129:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the shopper reports that store brands are “just as safe” as national brands. This is a less convincing measure
21:685:63239:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of information than active ingredient knowledge, as the correct answer is arguably unclear. Still, it is worth
21:686:63349:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:noting that it is a very strong correlate of brand choice:  believing store brands are just as safe as national
21:687:63460:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:brands has an additional effect of 21 percentage points over and above the effect of active ingredient knowl-
21:688:63569:20:20:72:539:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:edge. The effect of having this beliefandbeing able to name all active ingredients correctly is 35 percentage

21:693:64007:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and an indicator for being in a healthcare occupation other than pharmacist or physician.  The estimated
21:694:64111:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:occupation effects remain stable as we add controls. In the preferred specification of column (3) we find that
21:695:64221:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:being a pharmacist or physician increases the propensity to buy store brands by 15 percentage points; being
21:696:64328:21:20:72:426:261:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in another healthcare occupation increases the propensity by 8 percentage points.
21:697:64409:20:20:88:539:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Column (4) of table 3 presents evidence on the role of college major. We restrict the sample to respon-

21:699:64616:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:science majors are 5 percentage points more likely to buy store brand. Column (5) of table 3 presents occu-

21:701:64828:20:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The online appendix shows that these households’ primary shoppers are less likely to be prime working age,

21:703:65037:20:22:72:540:119:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:who are currently employed for pay.  The coefficients on the occupation indicators remain large in magni-

22:708:65510:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Taken together, columns (4) and (5) suggest our results are unlikely to be driven by factors specific to current
22:709:65622:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:employment in a healthcare profession, such as the availability of employee discounts or free samples.  As
22:710:65728:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:further evidence, in the online appendix we use data on occupational knowledge requirements to show that
22:711:65832:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the propensity to buy store brand is greater among shoppers whose occupations require medical knowledge.
22:712:65936:20:20:72:527:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:This holds true even if we exclude shoppers who we have classified as having occupations in healthcare.
22:713:66039:20:21:88:539:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Column (6) of table 3 presents evidence on the extent to which our direct and indirect knowledge mea-

22:718:66567:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:from zero.  These findings are consistent with the interpretation that all of our measures capture variation
22:719:66675:20:21:72:349:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:along a common dimension, which we interpret as information.
22:720:66735:21:20:88:539:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:As further support for our identifying assumptions, appendix figure 1 shows that healthcare professionals

22:725:67109:28:20:72:540:319:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We now turn to the analysis of food purchases.  Here our proxies for knowledge are indicators for whether
22:726:67214:20:20:72:540:299:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the primary shopper is a chef (“chef or head cook”) or other food preparer.35We begin with a case study of
22:727:67320:20:21:72:540:279:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:pantry staples: salt, sugar, and baking soda. We choose these products because they are uniform in chemical
22:728:67427:21:20:72:515:258:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:composition and purpose, and thus analogous to headache remedies in being relatively homogeneous.

22:730:67626:20:21:72:540:218:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:staples: baking soda; regular iodized and plain salt (sold in boxes); and regular granulated, light brown, and
22:731:67736:21:20:72:539:197:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:powdered sugar (sold in bags).  Collectively, these comparables account for $1.81 billion of expenditure.
22:732:67841:20:20:72:540:177:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Store-brand purchases account for 60 percent of volume and 57 percent of expenditure.  On average, the

22:734:68018:16:14:84:539:141:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:34Imposing this restriction requires us to use only the sample of households that responded to the second survey wave. We show
22:735:68144:14:8:72:444:127:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:in the online appendix that the results from our baseline specification are comparable in this subsample.
22:736:68249:8:15:84:539:119:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:35Our second survey wave asked respondents to identify the most common additive to table salt (iodine), the scientific name for
22:737:68376:15:11:72:540:104:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), and the most common ingredient of granulated sugar (sucrose).  The share of these questions
22:738:68501:11:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:answered correctly is positively correlated with working as a chef but not with being a non-chef food preparer, and is positively

22:740:68764:11:0:72:240:71:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:measures are presented in the online appendix.
23:741:68812:0:21:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Figure 5 shows the relationship between store-brand share and occupation. As with headache remedies,
23:742:68912:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:there is a strong negative relationship between store-brand share and median occupational income.  House-
23:743:69017:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:holds whose primary shopper is a food preparer or food service manager buy more store brands than others
23:744:69121:20:21:72:539:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of similar occupational income. Chefs—the occupational group we would have expectedex anteto be most
23:745:69221:21:20:71:539:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:informed about the quality of food products—buy more than 77 percent store brands in these categories,
23:746:69323:20:20:71:296:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:more than any other occupation of meaningful size.
23:747:69373:20:21:88:539:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Table 4 shows the relationship with occupation in a regression framework. The specifications in the five
23:748:69477:21:20:71:539:566:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:columns are the same as in the analogous columns of table 3, with the information proxies of interestKi
23:749:69580:20:20:71:539:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:now consisting of an indicator for college education, an indicator for being a chef, and an indicator for being
23:750:69691:20:21:71:539:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a food preparer but not a chef.  In our preferred specification of column (3), we estimate that being a chef
23:751:69799:21:20:71:539:505:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:increases the probability of buying store brands by 12 percentage points, and working in a non-chef food
23:752:69903:20:20:71:539:485:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:preparation occupation increases this probability by 2 percentage points. These effects are somewhat smaller
23:753:70011:20:21:71:539:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in magnitude than those we estimate when we do not include our preferred set of controls.  In contrast to
23:754:70116:21:20:71:539:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:headache remedies, we do not find any clear effect of college education. Column (4) shows that non-health
23:755:70221:20:20:71:539:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:science majors and health majors are not statistically different from other college graduates.  Column (5)
23:756:70327:20:21:71:539:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:shows that the coefficient on being a chef goes largely unchanged when we focus on shoppers who are
23:757:70426:21:20:71:539:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:not currently employed.  The coefficient on being a non-chef food preparer falls and becomes statistically
23:758:70532:20:20:71:539:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:insignificant, but its confidence interval includes the magnitude of our preferred estimate.  These findings
23:759:70640:20:37:71:539:343:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:suggest that the effects we estimate are not driven by mechanical effects of employment in the food industry.
23:760:70749:37:28:71:259:306:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:4.3    Evidence on Domain Specificity
23:761:70786:28:20:71:539:278:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We find that health experts purchase more store-brand health products and that food experts purchase more
23:762:70891:20:20:71:539:258:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:store-brand food products. A natural follow-up question is whether experts’ knowledge is transferable out-
23:763:70997:20:21:71:539:238:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:side of their domain of expertise. Perhaps pharmacists’ understanding of the equivalence of national-brand
23:764:71103:21:20:71:539:217:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and store-brand headache remedies leads them to also recognize the likely equivalence of national-brand
23:765:71206:20:20:71:539:197:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and store-brand baking soda.  Or perhaps their understanding does not translate beyond the categories with
23:766:71312:20:21:71:210:177:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:which they are directly familiar.
23:767:71345:21:20:88:539:156:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Table 5 presents evidence on domain specificity.  The first two columns look at the effect of healthcare
23:768:71449:20:20:71:539:136:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:expertise on pantry staple purchases.  Column (1) shows that the share of headache remedy active ingre-
23:769:71552:20:21:71:539:116:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:dients known has no significant effect on the probability of purchasing store-brand pantry staples, with a
23:770:71658:21:20:71:540:95:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:confidence interval that rules out effects greater than 1.2 percentage points. Column (2) shows that pharma-
23:771:71766:20:0:71:539:75:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cists, physicians, and other healthcare professionals are also not significantly more likely to buy store-brand
24:772:71879:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:pantry staples. The confidence intervals on the pharmacist-physician and other healthcare occupation coef-
24:773:71985:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ficients rule out effects greater than 5.2 percentage points and 2.2 percentage points respectively.  We can
24:774:72093:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:confidently reject the hypothesis that these effects are as large as the effects we estimate for headache rem-
24:775:72203:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:edy purchases.  The evidence thus suggests that healthcare expertise does not translate to behavior outside
24:776:72310:21:20:72:537:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the health domain, consistent with past evidence on the domain specificity of expertise (Levitt et al. 2010).
24:777:72419:20:20:88:539:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The final column of table 5 looks at the effect of food preparation expertise on headache remedy pur-
24:778:72520:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:chases.  Here, we do see some evidence of transferability:  controlling for income and other demographics,
24:779:72626:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:chefs are a statistically significant 11 percentage points more likely to buy store-brand headache remedies
24:780:72733:20:44:72:453:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:than other consumers. There is no significant effect for food preparers other than chefs.

24:783:72875:28:20:72:540:442:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We turn next to analyzing a broad set of health products. We restrict attention to the 6 headache remedy com-
24:784:72984:20:21:72:539:422:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:parables that we study above, and 44 additional comparables for which we observe at least 5,000 purchases
24:785:73089:21:20:72:540:401:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by households with non-missing values of our demographic controls. These include other medications such

24:787:73296:20:21:72:539:361:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:contact lens solution.  Non-painkiller health categories account for $8.94 billion of expenditure per year.
24:788:73403:21:20:72:540:340:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Store-brand  purchases  account  for  57  percent  of  volume.   Store-brand  prices  are  half  of  national-brand
24:789:73518:20:20:72:151:320:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:prices on average.
24:790:73536:20:21:88:539:300:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:For each comparable, we run one regression to estimate the effect of knowing headache remedy active

24:794:73976:21:20:72:540:218:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:coefficients on college education and other healthcare occupation in the online appendix.  In order to test
24:795:74083:20:20:72:540:198:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:joint hypotheses about the coefficients in these plots, we estimate our full set of regression models on 20
24:796:74190:20:21:72:540:178:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:bootstrap replicates.  In each replicate we draw a random subset of households with replacement.  For the
24:797:74295:21:20:72:441:157:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:remainder of the paper, all bootstrap inference will be based on these 20 replicates.36
24:798:74382:20:20:88:539:137:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Figure 6 shows that the coefficient on active ingredient knowledge is positive in 43 out of 50 cases. The
24:799:74487:20:20:72:540:117:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:share of coefficient estimates that are positive is thus 0.86, which has a bootstrap standard error of 0.05,
24:800:74595:20:15:84:539:97:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:36We use 20 replicates instead of a larger number due to computational costs. The online appendix compares the standard errors
24:801:74721:15:11:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:on our key regression coefficients from our 20 replicates to those obtained from a more intensive bootstrap with 200 replicates, for

25:804:75002:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:positive). Consistent with the evidence on domain specificity that we present above, if we estimate analogous
25:805:75111:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:models for non-health comparables, the coefficient on active ingredient knowledge is positive in only 168
25:806:75216:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:out of 282 cases, which is much closer to the null hypothesis and highly statistically distinguishable from the
25:807:75327:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:number for health categories. Figure 8 illustrates the contrast visually, plotting the distribution oft-statistics
25:808:75441:20:20:72:290:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:separately for health and non-health comparables.
25:809:75490:20:21:88:539:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The differences among the coefficients in figure 6 are instructive. The coefficients tend to be larger and
25:810:75596:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:more significant for medications and relatively smaller for first aid and eye care products, suggesting that
25:811:75704:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the latter group informed shoppers perceive true quality differences.  Indeed, contact lens solutions are
25:812:75812:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the only healthcare product we have identified where some medical professionals recommend patients buy
25:813:75914:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:national brands due to quality concerns with store brands (Secor 2002). In the online appendix, we show that
25:814:76022:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the estimated effects of most information proxies tend to be larger (though not statistically significantly so)
25:815:76133:20:21:72:539:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in comparables in whichConsumer Reportsconsiders store brands and national brands to be equivalent. We
25:816:76235:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:also examine whether the effect of information is greater in the comparables for which the price gap between
25:817:76343:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:national and store brands is greatest, and find only a weak association.  Finally, we show that the effect of
25:818:76452:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:information  tends  to  be  greater  in  more  advertising-intensive  comparables,  consistent  with  the  idea  that
25:819:76569:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:perceptions of product quality by the uninformed may be driven by advertising on the part of national-brand
25:820:76676:20:20:72:137:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:manufacturers.
25:821:76690:20:21:88:539:343:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Figure 7 presents estimates of the effect of being a pharmacist or physician; estimates of the effect of

25:823:76902:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to the coefficients on active ingredient knowledge, though with somewhat less precision. The effect of being
25:824:77010:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a pharmacist or physician is positive in share 0.68 of cases (bootstrap standard error = 0.05), and the effect
25:825:77120:21:20:72:539:261:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of being in another healthcare occupation is positive in share 0.86 of cases (bootstrap standard error = 0.04).
25:826:77231:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In the online appendix we present plots analogous to figure 8 for the coefficients on the pharmacist/physician

25:828:77397:21:20:88:539:200:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:It is important to stress that figure 6 shows the relationship between store-brand purchase and knowledge

25:830:77601:20:21:71:539:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:remedy comparables. We might therefore expect this knowledge proxy to be most strongly related to store-
25:831:77705:21:20:71:539:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:brand purchases in headache remedies and similar categories, even if the true effects of information are no
25:832:77812:20:20:71:539:119:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:greater in such categories.  Our cross-category analysis of occupational effects in figure 7 and the online
25:833:77919:20:0:71:481:99:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:appendix is useful in part because the effects of occupation are not subject to this type of bias.

26:836:78157:20:21:72:540:661:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:staples that we study above, plus 235 additional comparables for which we observe at least 5,000 purchases
26:837:78263:21:20:72:540:640:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by households with non-missing values of our demographic controls. These comprise a broad cross-section
26:838:78366:20:20:72:540:620:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of supermarket products, from milk and eggs, to carbonated beverages, to ready-to-eat cereal.  Excluding
26:839:78470:20:21:72:540:600:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:pantry staples, these categories account for $123 billion of expenditure.  Store-brand purchases account for
26:840:78578:21:20:72:540:579:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:43 percent of volume. On average, the price-per-equivalent-volume for store brands is 70 percent of that for
26:841:78686:20:20:72:142:559:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:national brands.
26:842:78702:20:21:88:539:539:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:For each comparable, we run a separate regression to estimate the effect of working as a chef or other

26:846:79129:21:20:72:540:457:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:groups,” weighting the individual comparables by precision and computing the aggregate confidence inter-
26:847:79233:20:20:72:540:437:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:val as if the individual coefficients are statistically independent.  Thus, for example, the comparables for
26:848:79341:20:21:72:540:417:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cola,  diet cola,  lemon-lime soda,  and so forth are combined into the Nielsen product group “carbonated
26:849:79446:21:20:72:122:396:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:beverages.”
26:850:79457:20:20:88:539:376:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The estimated effects of knowledge on store-brand purchases in these categories are weaker than what
26:851:79557:20:21:72:540:356:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:we saw for health products.  The coefficients on working as a chef are positive for 148 comparables and
26:852:79660:21:20:72:539:335:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:negative for 93.  The share of coefficient estimates that are positive is thus 0.61, with a bootstrap standard
26:853:79770:20:20:72:540:315:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:error of 0.04.  The coefficients that are individually statistically significant are generally small in magni-
26:854:79880:20:21:72:540:295:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tude. The pantry staples categories stand out as having among the most positive and significant coefficients:
26:855:79989:21:20:72:540:274:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:granulated sugar has the third largest coefficient in the figure, and three of the top six coefficients are pantry
26:856:80103:20:20:72:540:254:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:staples. In the online appendix we present plots analogous to figure 9 for working in other food preparation
26:857:80211:20:44:72:280:234:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:occupations and for having a college education.
26:858:80258:44:32:72:363:190:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:6    Aggregate Effects of Consumer Information
26:859:80304:32:20:72:540:158:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In this section we add structure to the stylized model in section 3. We estimate the model using a combination
26:860:80414:20:21:72:540:138:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the coefficients from the preceding analysis and additional data moments.  We then compute the effect
26:861:80518:21:20:72:540:117:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of consumer information on the distribution of consumer and producer surplus, and on prices and market
26:862:80620:20:20:72:102:97:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:shares.
26:863:80627:20:0:88:539:77:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The purpose of this analysis is twofold. First, we wish to aggregate the coefficients estimated in section
27:864:80735:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:5 to learn how expenditures, market shares, and profits would change in the drug store and the grocery store
27:865:80843:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:if all households behaved like expert shoppers.  This aggregation does not rely on details of the model:  it
27:866:80951:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:amounts to an expenditure-weighted aggregation of the coefficients from our linear probability models (e.g.,
27:867:81059:20:21:72:432:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:those presented in figure 7), along with information on retail and wholesale prices.
27:868:81143:21:20:88:539:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Second, we wish to predict how consumer welfare and firm pricing would change in a world of informed
27:869:81243:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:shoppers. Our predictions are contingent on a set of strong parametric, symmetry, and conduct assumptions.
27:870:81349:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:These assumptions allow us to solve the model in closed form for a large set of product categories, and
27:871:81452:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to show transparently how the various empirical moments determine our estimates.  Because the resulting
27:872:81555:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:model is highly stylized, our welfare and pricing results should be taken more as suggestive illustrations of
27:873:81664:20:37:72:364:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the economic forces at work than as realistic empirical predictions.
27:874:81732:37:28:72:131:489:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:6.1    Model
27:875:81744:28:20:72:540:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:For each comparable, consider a market withRretailers indexed byrand households indexed byi.  Each
27:876:81842:20:21:72:540:441:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:retailer sells a store brand with pricep(0,r)and a national brand with pricep(1,r).  Each household must
27:877:81946:21:20:72:539:420:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:make a single purchase from the choice set{0,1}×{1,...,R}.  Both the store brand and the national brand
27:878:82049:20:20:72:269:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are manufactured at constant marginal costc.
27:879:82093:20:21:88:539:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Each retailer sets the price of, and captures all profits from, its own store brand. A single manufacturer
27:880:82199:21:20:72:540:359:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:captures all profits from the sale of the national brand and sets the price of this brand at each retailer.  The
27:881:82311:20:20:72:540:339:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:assumption that the manufacturer sets the final retail price means that our model does not exhibit double-
27:882:82417:20:21:72:540:319:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:marginalization effects. We view this as an approximation to a setting in which the manufacturer has a rich
27:883:82524:21:20:72:540:298:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:set of instruments (wholesale prices, slotting fees, promotional allowances, resale price maintenance, etc.)
27:884:82632:20:20:72:540:278:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:with which to influence both the final price and the distribution of profits between the manufacturer and the
27:885:82741:20:20:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:retailer.37We treat advertising and other marketing costs incurred by the manufacturer as a sunk cost in the
27:886:82849:20:21:72:540:238:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sense of Shaked and Sutton (1987) and Sutton (1989), and we assume these costs are chosen at a prior stage
27:887:82955:21:20:72:167:217:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that we do not model.
27:888:82976:20:20:88:539:197:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The market consists of a large number of uninformed households—which we define as consumers who
27:889:83071:20:21:72:540:177:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are not pharmacists or physicians for health products and consumers who are not chefs for food products—
27:890:83175:21:20:72:540:156:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:as well as a small number of informed households.  We assume the latter are few enough that firms ignore
27:891:83279:20:61:72:465:136:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:them in making pricing decisions, and we do not include them in our welfare calculations.
27:892:83368:61:0:84:406:75:7:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:37See the discussion of vertical control in O’Brien and Shaffer (1992) and Shaffer (1991).
28:893:83460:0:37:88:310:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Each household maximizes utilityui(b,r)given by

28:895:83538:37:20:72:540:635:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:whereb∈{0,1}is an indicator for purchasing the national brand,vi(b)is an idiosyncratic perceived brand
28:896:83640:20:21:72:540:615:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:preference, andτi(r)is an idiosyncratic travel cost distributed standard type-I extreme value up to a scale
28:897:83747:21:20:72:339:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:parameter. Each household has a true brand preference   ̃vi(b).
28:898:83810:20:20:88:539:574:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We specify brand preferences as follows.  We normalizevi(0) = ̃vi(0) =0.  For each household, we let
28:899:83910:20:21:73:539:554:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B: ̃vi(1) =λ ξiwhereλis a parameter andξiis a preference shock distributed i.i.d. logistic across households.
28:900:84017:21:20:72:422:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:For uninformed households,vi(1) =ξi; for informed households,vi(1) = ̃vi(1).
28:901:84093:20:20:88:540:513:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The parameterλ≥0 indicates the similarity between true and perceived brand preference for unin-
28:902:84188:20:21:72:540:493:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:formed households.  Whenλ=1, perceived and true brand preference agree;  whenλ=0, national and
28:903:84282:21:20:72:345:472:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:store brand are truly identical but are perceived to be different.
28:904:84348:20:20:88:539:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Throughout our analysis, we define consumer welfare with respect to true brand preference. That is, we
28:905:84450:20:21:72:539:432:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:define the consumer surplus of a household that buys brandbat retailerras   ̃vi(b)−p(b,r)−τi(r).  We
28:906:84550:21:20:72:540:411:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:define total consumer surplus as the sum of consumer surplus across all households, and we define total
28:907:84653:20:20:72:538:391:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:surplus as the sum of total consumer surplus and the total variable profits of the manufacturer and retailers.
28:908:84763:20:21:88:539:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The game proceeds in three stages.  First, the manufacturer and retailers simultaneously announce all
28:909:84864:21:20:72:540:350:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:pricesp(b,r).   Second,  each household learns its travel costτi(r)and chooses which retailerrto visit.
28:910:84967:20:20:72:539:330:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Third, each household learns its perceived brand preferencevi(b)and chooses which brandbto purchase.
28:911:85067:20:20:72:539:310:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We restrict our attention to a symmetric equilibrium in whichp(0,r) =p(0), and hencep(1,r) =p(1), for
28:912:85168:20:37:72:135:290:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:each retailerr.
28:913:85183:37:28:72:155:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:6.2    Estimation
28:914:85200:28:20:72:509:225:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Estimation is in closed form. Here we outline the key steps; an appendix provides additional details.
28:915:85301:20:21:88:540:205:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We matchp(0)andp(1)to the average store-brand and national-brand prices,  respectively,  and we
28:916:85396:21:20:72:539:184:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:choosecto match the median retail margin of store brands.   We choose the scale ofτi(r)to match the
28:917:85495:20:20:72:540:164:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:retailer’s markup on the store brand:  greater dispersion inτi(r)implies less competition among retailers
28:918:85600:20:21:72:540:144:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and hence greater retail margins.  Similarly, we choose the scale ofξito match the manufacturer’s markup
28:919:85704:21:20:72:539:123:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on the national brand.  Given scale parameters, we can then choose the location ofξito match the overall
28:920:85808:20:20:72:540:103:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:market share of the national brand: a high market share for the national brand implies a high mean value of
28:921:85915:20:0:72:83:83:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f3:B:ξi.
29:922:85920:0:21:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Having pinned down the preferences of the uninformed, we chooseλto match the difference in store-
29:923:86017:21:20:71:539:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:brand purchase probability between informed and uninformed consumers shown in figures 7 and 9.  When
29:924:86117:20:20:71:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:informed households purchase more store brand than uninformed households,λ<1. When informed house-
29:925:86215:20:21:71:388:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:hold purchase more national brands than uninformed households,λ>1.
29:926:86281:21:20:88:539:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The online appendix presents point estimates for all parameters for all comparables, with bootstrapped
29:927:86383:20:37:71:139:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:standard errors.
29:928:86399:37:28:71:135:570:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:6.3    Results
29:929:86413:28:20:71:539:542:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Tables 6 and 7 present summaries of our findings, aggregated across groups of comparables, for health and
29:930:86518:20:20:71:539:522:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:food products, respectively.  For each set of products we present the change relative to baseline from two
29:931:86624:20:21:71:539:502:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:counterfactuals in which households choose according to true rather than perceived brand preference.  In
29:932:86728:21:20:71:539:481:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the first counterfactual, prices are held constant at observed levels; in the second, prices adjust to reflect the
29:933:86842:20:20:71:539:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:change in consumer demand.  We measure changes in consumer expenditure and surplus, and changes in
29:934:86940:20:21:71:539:441:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:retailer and manufacturer profit, relative to baseline expenditure levels.  Tables 6 and 7 use our estimated
29:935:87048:21:20:71:539:420:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:parameter values.   As a benchmark,  the online appendix presents analogous results in which we impose
29:936:87150:20:20:71:230:400:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f3:B:λ=0 regardless of the estimatedλ.
29:937:87183:20:21:88:539:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The left panel of table 6 presents results for headache remedies.  Holding prices constant at baseline
29:938:87285:21:20:71:539:359:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:levels, if all consumers became as informed as pharmacists or physicians, the market share of national-brand
29:939:87393:20:20:71:539:339:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:headache remedies would fall by half, total expenditure on headache remedies would fall by 14 percent,
29:940:87495:20:21:71:539:319:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and consumer surplus would increase by 4 percent relative to baseline expenditure.   The national-brand
29:941:87598:21:20:71:539:298:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:manufacturer would lose profits equivalent to 19 percent of baseline expenditure, and retailers would gain
29:942:87704:20:20:71:539:278:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:profits equivalent to 5 percent. Note that total surplus falls even though we evaluate consumer welfare with
29:943:87812:20:20:71:539:258:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:respect to true preferences.  The reason is that while manufacturing costs are equal across brands, prices
29:944:87918:20:21:71:539:238:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are not.  Because even experts perceive some small differences among brands(λ>0), shifting purchases
29:945:88018:21:20:71:539:217:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:towards store-brands entails some loss of social efficiency.  To illustrate this intuition, the online appendix
29:946:88129:20:20:71:523:197:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:shows that the change in total surplus gets smaller as national-brand prices approach store-brand prices.
29:947:88234:20:21:88:539:177:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Allowing prices to adjust softens the blow for the national-brand manufacturer by allowing the manu-
29:948:88334:21:20:71:539:156:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:facturer to lower the relative price of the national brand.  This harms retailers but increases the gains to the
29:949:88446:20:20:71:539:136:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consumer. Because prices come to better reflect manufacturing costs, total surplus rises relative to the case
29:950:88555:20:21:71:539:116:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in which prices are held constant, and there is no aggregate efficiency loss relative to baseline. In addition,
29:951:88666:21:20:71:539:95:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:calculations not reported in the table show that informed households benefit from making all households
29:952:88769:20:0:71:403:75:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:informed, because prices fall for both national-brand and store-brand goods.
30:953:88847:0:21:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The right panel of table 6 shows that for other health categories we find effects that are similar direction-

30:955:89063:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:price adjustment, consumers would gain surplus equivalent to 4 percent of baseline expenditure in health cat-

30:957:89278:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:results  presented  in  the  online  appendix  show  that  much  of  this  gain  would  come  from  (non-headache-
30:958:89392:20:20:72:209:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:remedy) medication categories.
30:959:89422:20:21:88:539:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Table 7 examines food and drink categories. Here, the small price differences between national and store
30:960:89526:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:brands and the relatively modest effects of information combine to imply fairly small impacts. The greatest
30:961:89633:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:effect is found in pantry staples, where allowing for both price adjustment and greater consumer information
30:962:89741:20:21:72:468:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:would improve consumer welfare by an amount equal to 3 percent of baseline expenditure.
30:963:89828:21:20:88:540:505:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The calculations in tables 6 and 7 imply that, at current prices, the average household would gain $7.92
30:964:89932:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:per year in consumer surplus from being as informed as a pharmacist or physician when making health-
30:965:90032:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:related purchases and as informed as a chef when making food purchases.  Put differently, if information
30:966:90136:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is costly to acquire, households would optimally choose to be as informed as an expert if the cost of doing
30:967:90243:20:20:72:539:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:so were less than $7.92 and to remain uninformed if the cost were greater than $7.92.  Of course, these
30:968:90346:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:calculations consider only the benefits to information in the comparables that we study; there may well be
30:969:90452:21:44:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:benefits to expert information in other consumer domains (e.g., decisions about elective surgical procedures).
30:970:90562:44:31:72:168:339:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:7    Conclusions
30:971:90578:31:21:72:540:308:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Across a range of products we find strong evidence that more informed shoppers buy more store brands and
30:972:90682:21:20:72:540:287:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:fewer national brands. Consumer information plays a large quantitative role in health categories, where our
30:973:90789:20:20:72:540:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:estimates imply that expenditures and market shares would change significantly if all households behaved
30:974:90893:20:21:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:like expert shoppers. By contrast, the role of consumer information is smaller in food and drink categories,
30:975:91001:21:20:72:502:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:where our estimates suggest much smaller gaps between expert and non-expert shopping behavior.
30:976:91095:20:20:88:539:206:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We do not perform any quantitative policy evaluation in the paper.   However,  we think our findings
30:977:91195:20:21:72:540:186:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and methods may be relevant to several active policy areas.  One such area is the regulation of “copycat”
30:978:91300:21:20:72:540:165:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:products that are designed to look like other brands.  Regulators, especially in Europe, have considered the
30:979:91408:20:20:72:540:145:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:possibility that store-brand products with such “copycat packaging” might “lead consumers to think that the
30:980:91515:20:21:72:539:125:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:[store-brand] product is...of similar quality” to the national brand (UK Competition Commission 2008).38
30:981:91619:21:29:71:539:104:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Our findings imply that, at least in some product categories, consumers exhibit the opposite bias, believing

31:983:91847:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that national brands are better than store brands when in fact they are not.  In those categories, “copycat”
31:984:91955:21:20:72:491:688:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:packaging could raise consumer welfare by signaling that different brands are of similar quality.
31:985:92052:20:20:88:539:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:A second area of potential policy relevance is the regulation of deceptive advertising. The Federal Trade
31:986:92157:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Commission evaluates claims of deceptive advertising on whether the advertising is indeed deceptive and on
31:987:92263:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:whether the deception is “material,” for example to the consumer’s purchase decision. A common method-
31:988:92365:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ology for establishing deceptiveness is a “copy test,” in which consumers are shown the advertisements in
31:989:92470:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:question and asked to interpret them (see, e.g., Federal Trade Commission 1999). A common methodology
31:990:92571:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for establishing materiality is to survey consumers to ask what factors influence their decisions (Richards
31:991:92678:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and Preston 1992).  Our paper suggests comparing the behavioral response of experts and non-experts as a
31:992:92782:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:possible choice-based approach to quantifying the harm from a potentially deceptive advertising claim or
31:993:92886:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:campaign.  If experts respond differently than non-experts, that may be taken as consistent with misinfor-
31:994:92992:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:mation;  our model suggests one way in which to quantify the costs of that misinformation to non-expert
31:995:93095:20:21:72:121:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consumers.
31:996:93105:21:20:88:539:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In considering these and other policy implications it is worth stressing that our study is limited to ex-
31:997:93210:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:amining the effects of information on quantities and prices.  If consumers were to become more informed,
31:998:93314:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:markets would adjust on other margins as well.  In particular, a more informed population of consumers
31:999:93416:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:might change whether and how much firms choose to advertise their products, as well as which products
31:1000:93517:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are introduced to the market.  Taking account of these forms of dynamic adjustment, and examining their
31:1001:93620:20:0:72:355:343:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:implications for welfare, is an important priority for future work.
