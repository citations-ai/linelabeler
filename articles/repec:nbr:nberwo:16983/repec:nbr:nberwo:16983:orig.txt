2:26:1271:28:28:306:339:616:12:Times:12:Times:ABSTRACT
2:27:1279:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:The Plant Patent Act of 1930 was the first step towards creating property rights for biological innovation:
2:28:1386:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:it introduced patent rights for asexually-propagated plants.  This paper uses data on plant patents and
2:29:1489:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:registrations of new varieties to examine whether the Act encouraged innovation.  Nearly half of all
2:30:1589:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:plant patents between 1931 and 1970 were for roses.  Large commercial nurseries, which began to
2:31:1684:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:build mass hybridization programs in the 1940s, accounted for most of these patents, suggesting that
2:32:1784:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:the new intellectual property rights may have helped to encourage the development of a commercial
2:33:1881:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:rose breeding industry.  Data on registrations of newly-created roses, however, yield no evidence of
2:34:1981:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:an increase in innovation:  less than 20 percent of new roses were patented, European breeders continued
2:35:2085:14:42:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:to create most new roses, and there was no increase in the number of new varieties per year after 1931.

3:51:2438:0:27:72:508:708:144:Times:144:Times:In 1930, the US Congress established the first intellectual property rights (IPRs) for living 
3:52:2532:27:28:72:535:681:144:Times:144:Times:organisms.  With the Plant Patent Act (PPA) it created patent rights to prevent the replication of 
3:53:2631:28:27:72:521:653:144:Times:144:Times:genetic materials through roots and cuttings (rather than seeds).  Breeders of such “asexually-
3:54:2726:27:28:72:539:626:144:Times:144:Times:propagated” plants, including fruit trees and roses, argued that they needed IPRs to recover large 
3:55:2825:28:28:72:503:598:144:Times:144:Times:development costs.  By creating IPRs, the U.S. government hoped to encourage domestic 
3:56:2910:28:37:72:420:570:144:Times:144:Times:innovation and the development of a domestic plant breeding industry.   
3:57:2981:37:28:108:519:533:144:Times:144:Times: This chapter uses historical data on patents and registrations of new plant varieties to 
3:58:3070:28:27:72:542:505:144:Times:144:Times:examine the effects of the Plant Patent Act on biological innovation.  Evidence on a later Act, the 
3:59:3170:27:28:71:532:478:144:Times:144:Times:Plant Variety Protection Act (PVPA) of 1970, is mixed.  The PVPA complemented the PPA by 
3:60:3259:28:28:71:525:450:144:Times:144:Times:extending IPRs to plants that reproduce “sexually” through seeds, such as wheat, soybeans, or 
3:61:3353:28:27:71:513:422:144:Times:144:Times:cotton.  Survey results suggest that it encouraged research expenditures and “stimulated the 
3:62:3446:27:28:71:493:395:144:Times:144:Times:development of new varieties of wheat and soybeans" (Butler and Marion 1985, Perrin, 
3:63:3531:28:27:71:521:367:144:Times:144:Times:Kunnings, and Ihnen 1983).  Most of these increases in research investments, however, came 
3:64:3622:27:28:71:531:340:144:Times:144:Times:from the public sector, and there is little evidence that crops, and specifically wheat, performed 
3:65:3721:28:28:71:530:312:144:Times:144:Times:better after 1970 (Alston and Venner 2002).2  For cotton, on the other hand, changes in acreage 
3:66:3817:28:27:72:507:284:144:Times:144:Times:and in the variety of cotton crops suggest a positive effect of IPRs (Naseem, Oehmke, and 
3:67:3907:27:38:72:200:257:144:Times:144:Times:Schimmelpfennig, 2005).  
3:68:3932:38:27:108:541:219:144:Times:144:Times: The small number of patents for crop plants, such as fruit trees and vines, suggest that the 
3:69:4025:27:49:72:537:192:144:Times:144:Times:effects of the Act on commercial agriculture were limited: “The great hopes for agriculture have 
3:70:4122:49:7:216:219:143:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:                                           
3:71:4164:7:16:72:539:136:42:Times:99:Times:2 Instead of arguing that IPRs failed to encourage innovation, Alston and Venner (2002) conclude that an exemption 
3:72:4279:16:12:72:529:120:99:Times:99:Times:of the PVPA, which allows farmers to copy seeds for their own use, weakened breeders’ ability to appropriate the 
3:73:4392:12:11:72:542:108:99:Times:99:Times:returns of R&D.  Another factor is that IPRs may have limited effects on crops that can be protected through secrecy 
3:74:4508:11:12:72:503:97:99:Times:99:Times:(e.g., Moser 2010).  Secrecy is particularly effective to protect innovations in hybrid seeds whose desirable 
3:75:4618:12:11:72:521:85:99:Times:99:Times:characteristics cannot be replicated by replanting the improved seeds.   Analyses of certificate data indicate that 
3:76:4734:11:0:72:466:74:99:Times:99:Times:breeders of hybrid corn were reluctant to use IPRs (Janis and Kesan 2002; Dhar and Foltz 2007).   
4:77:4832:0:27:72:532:708:144:Times:144:Times:not been realized... (Daus 1967, p. 394).”  For the rose industry, however, observers noted that 
4:78:4929:27:38:72:434:681:144:Times:144:Times:“the Plant Patent Act cannot be deemed unsuccessful (Daus 1967, p.389).   
4:79:5002:38:27:108:537:643:144:Times:144:Times:Nearly half of 3,010 plant patents granted between 1931 and 1970 were for roses.  Large 
4:80:5090:27:28:72:515:616:144:Times:144:Times:commercial nurseries, which began to operate extensive mass hybridization programs in the 
4:81:5180:28:28:72:538:588:144:Times:144:Times:1940s and 1950s, account for most of the plant patents, suggesting that the creation of IPRs may 
4:82:5277:28:27:72:526:560:144:Times:144:Times:have helped to encourage the creation of a domestic U.S. rose industry (e.g.. Harkness 1985).  
4:83:5372:27:28:72:518:533:144:Times:144:Times:Industry experts, however, cautioned that “Patented roses have not lived up to expectations” 
4:84:5465:28:27:72:531:505:144:Times:144:Times:(Swecker 1944, p. 120).  A potential explanation for the discrepancy between the large number 
4:85:5559:27:28:72:509:478:144:Times:144:Times:of rose patents and the disappointment about the PPA is that breeders may have used plant 
4:86:5649:28:28:72:524:450:144:Times:144:Times:patents strategically to protect themselves from litigation (e.g. Kile 1934), so that increases in 
4:87:5748:28:27:72:536:422:144:Times:144:Times:patenting do not reflect increases in innovation.  To separate changes in strategic patenting from 
4:88:5847:27:28:72:518:395:144:Times:144:Times:changes in innovation, we collect data on registrations of new rose varieties as an alternative 
4:89:5943:28:37:72:219:367:144:Times:144:Times:measure of innovation.    
4:90:5968:37:28:108:496:330:144:Times:144:Times:Registration data show that U.S. breeders created fewer new varieties after 1930 
4:91:6049:28:28:72:527:302:144:Times:144:Times:compared with before.  European breeders continued to create most roses after 1930, and only 
4:92:6142:28:27:72:538:274:144:Times:144:Times:one American breeder was among the ten breeders with the largest number of registrations.  The 
4:93:6237:27:28:72:526:247:144:Times:144:Times:data also show that only a small share of newly-developed roses – less than one in five – were 
4:94:6332:28:37:72:134:219:144:Times:144:Times:patented.      
4:95:6347:37:28:108:538:182:144:Times:144:Times:Notably, some of the most prominent American roses were based on European roses that 
4:96:6432:28:28:72:516:154:144:Times:144:Times:U.S. nurseries had begun to license and propagate during the Second World War.  At a time 
4:97:6522:28:0:72:536:126:144:Times:144:Times:when plant patents strengthened incentives to invest in R&D, U.S. nurseries also benefited from 
5:98:6619:0:27:72:525:708:144:Times:144:Times:demand shock as a result of World War II when supplies from European markets were cut off 
5:99:6709:27:38:72:480:681:144:Times:144:Times:and U.S. breeders began to grow and improve roses that had been developed abroad.

5:101:6790:37:38:222:392:606:144:Times:144:Times:I. THE PLANT PATENT ACT OF 1930 
5:102:6821:38:28:107:538:568:144:Times:144:Times: Although Congress had discussed IPRs for plants as early as 1885, it took food shortages 
5:103:6910:28:27:71:523:540:144:Times:144:Times:during World War I and demands from the farm bloc states to “place agriculture on a basis of 
5:104:7003:27:28:71:542:513:144:Times:144:Times:economic equality with industry” to create sufficient pressure for legislative action (Kloppenburg 
5:105:7102:28:27:71:531:485:144:Times:144:Times:2004, p. 132; US House 1906, pp. 6-7; Olmstead and Rhode 2000).  Breeders of roses and fruit 
5:106:7195:27:28:71:504:458:144:Times:144:Times:trees, such as Paul Stark of Stark Brothers Nursery, were the driving force behind the Act 
5:107:7286:28:28:71:530:430:144:Times:144:Times:(Fowler 2000, pp. 628- 635; Kevles 2008, pp. 210-212, Terry 1966, pp. 30-34).  In the absence 
5:108:7380:28:27:71:534:402:144:Times:144:Times:of IPRs, Stark Brothers had taken desperate measures to protect agricultural innovations.  In the 
5:109:7478:27:28:71:538:375:144:Times:144:Times:mid-1910s it built a large cage, armed with a burglar alarm, to prevent competitors from stealing 
5:110:7576:28:27:71:525:347:144:Times:144:Times:cuttings of the first Golden Delicious apple tree (Figure 1; Rossman 1930, pp. 394-395; Terry 
5:111:7670:27:28:71:525:320:144:Times:144:Times:1966, p. 48).  Another large nursery, Jackson and Perkins, advised Congress in May 1930 that 
5:112:7763:28:28:71:520:292:144:Times:144:Times:the plant patent legislation was “of very great importance to the agricultural and horticultural 
5:113:7860:28:27:71:535:264:144:Times:144:Times:interests of the United States” and would provide “wonderful stimulus” (Congressional Record, 
5:114:7954:27:38:71:300:237:144:Times:144:Times:71st Cong., 2nd Sess. May 12, 1930, p. 8751).3   
5:115:8003:38:37:107:475:199:144:Times:144:Times: Thomas A. Edison (1847-1931) supported the Act in congressional debates: 
5:116:8076:37:14:86:526:162:144:Times:144:Times:Nothing that Congress could do to help farming would be of greater value and permanence 
5:117:8164:14:14:86:531:148:144:Times:144:Times:than to give the plant breeder the same status as the mechanical and chemical inventors now 
5:118:8256:14:37:86:355:134:144:Times:144:Times:have through the patent law.  (US House 1930, pp. 2-3)

5:120:8353:7:16:72:541:90:42:Times:99:Times:3 In the 1950s and 1960s roses accounted for 15 to 20 percent of U.S. nursery sales, which includes other ornamental 
5:121:8470:16:0:71:160:74:99:Times:99:Times:plants and fruit trees.  
6:122:8495:0:27:72:525:708:144:Times:144:Times:Edison had been a close friend of Luther Burbank (1849-1926) an American breeder who had 
6:123:8584:27:28:72:541:681:144:Times:144:Times:developed more than new 800 plant varieties (Smith 2009, pp. 308-309).  Edison observed that at 
6:124:8680:28:27:72:522:653:144:Times:144:Times:present “there are but few plant breeders” and that patents would “give us many Burbanks.”4  
6:125:8773:27:28:71:503:626:144:Times:144:Times:When Fiorello (“Little Flower”) LaGuardia remarked that “Luther Burbank did very well 
6:126:8859:28:28:71:492:598:144:Times:144:Times:without protection” (Congressional Record, 71st Cong., 2nd Sess. May 5 1930, p. 8391) 
6:127:8945:28:37:71:399:570:144:Times:144:Times:supporters of the Act presented a letter from Burbank to Paul Stark: 
6:128:9013:37:14:86:526:533:144:Times:144:Times:A man can patent a mousetrap or copyright a nasty song, but if he gives to the world a new 
6:129:9104:14:14:86:527:519:144:Times:144:Times:fruit that will add millions to the value of earth’s annual harvest he will be fortunate if he is 
6:130:9202:14:24:86:539:505:144:Times:144:Times:rewarded by so much as having his name connected with the result (US House 1930, p. 11).    
6:131:9293:24:27:71:521:481:144:Times:144:Times:The Plant Patent Act passed in the House on May 13, and President Herbert Hoover signed it 
6:132:9384:27:28:71:529:454:144:Times:144:Times:into law on May 23 (Allyn 1944. p. 13, Appendix A).  In its final report, Congress emphasized 
6:133:9478:28:32:71:496:426:144:Times:144:Times:the importance of intellectual property rights in the absence of alternative mechanisms:

6:149:10711:7:16:72:530:124:42:Times:99:Times:4 Edison had entered the field of experimental plant breeding when he was trying to increase the rubber content of 
6:150:10826:16:11:72:524:108:99:Times:99:Times:goldenrod, a golden yellow American flower.  Edison’s experiments produced a 12-foot tall plant that yielded as 
6:151:10938:11:12:72:517:97:99:Times:99:Times:much as 12 percent of especially resilient and long-lasting rubber, which Edison used to build tires for his own 
6:152:11051:12:11:72:526:85:99:Times:99:Times:Model T.  Although Edison had turned his research over to the U.S. government in 1930, goldenrod rubber never 
6:153:11161:11:0:72:341:74:99:Times:99:Times:went beyond the experimental stage (Rossman 1930, pp. 394-395.) 
7:154:11225:0:27:108:537:708:144:Times:144:Times:To protect the property rights of private investors, the PPA granted 17 years of exclusive 
7:155:11316:27:28:72:542:681:144:Times:144:Times:rights for new varieties of asexually propagated plants – plants that reproduce by roots, shoots, or 
7:156:11417:28:27:72:541:653:144:Times:144:Times:buds.  Sexually propagated plants were excluded after plant scientists of the American Society of 
7:157:11514:27:28:72:528:626:144:Times:144:Times:Horticultural Sciences argued that the characteristics of new varieties would not be genetically 
7:158:11611:28:28:72:529:598:144:Times:144:Times:stable.  Paul Stark of Stark Brothers’ Nursery recalled that “it was clearly evident that no Plant 
7:159:11710:28:27:72:538:570:144:Times:144:Times:Patent bill could be passed that included sexually propagated plants” (US Senate 1968, p. 863).5  
7:160:11808:27:28:72:530:543:144:Times:144:Times:The Act also excluded edible tubers – such as potatoes - possibly to prevent private firms from 
7:161:11904:28:37:72:408:515:144:Times:144:Times:holding monopoly rights over U.S. food supplies (Allyn 1946, p.34).6 
7:162:11972:37:28:107:526:478:144:Times:144:Times:Compared with other types of patents, plant patents are narrower in scope (Daus 1967, 
7:163:12058:28:28:71:539:450:144:Times:144:Times:p.392).  Similar to drug patents that cover a single molecule, plant patents cover only the asexual 
7:164:12158:28:27:71:532:422:144:Times:144:Times:reproduction of an individual plant grown in cultivation; they do not cover the seeds of the new 
7:165:12255:27:28:71:528:395:144:Times:144:Times:plant, or other plants with the same characteristics. Grant rates, measured as patent grants over 
7:166:12353:28:27:71:503:367:144:Times:144:Times:publications are higher for plant patents than for other types of IPRs.  Thus, 92 percent of 
7:167:12446:27:28:71:497:340:144:Times:144:Times:applications between 1961 and 1965 were accepted by the USPTO (576 grants over 628 
7:168:12529:28:28:71:515:312:144:Times:144:Times:applications), compared with 59 percent for utility patents and 55 percent for design patents 
7:169:12623:28:37:71:546:284:144:Times:144:Times:(Daus 1967, p. 392).  Plants did not have to be “useful” to be patentable (Allyn 1944, pp. 13-14).   
7:170:12724:37:28:107:526:247:144:Times:144:Times:In principle, asexually-propagated plants have to be new, distinct, and not found in the 
7:171:12813:28:53:71:540:219:144:Times:144:Times:wild to be patentable; in practice, however, sports – random bud variations that can be found in a

7:173:12954:7:16:72:537:159:42:Times:99:Times:5 Although the American Seed Trade Association wanted IPRs, Stark convinced them that the time was not ripe: “It 
7:174:13067:16:12:72:534:143:99:Times:99:Times:seemed to be the wise thing to get established the principle that Congress recognized the rights of the plant breeder 
7:175:13185:12:11:72:521:131:99:Times:99:Times:and originators. Then, in the light of experience, effort could be made to get protection also for seed propagated 
7:176:13300:11:12:72:538:120:99:Times:99:Times:plants which would be much easier after this fundamental principle was established” (Fowler 1994, pp. 82-84 citing 
7:177:13415:12:11:72:510:108:99:Times:99:Times:the American Seed Trade Association, 1930 Proceedings, p. 66).  Stark’s lobbying efforts cost the American 
7:178:13522:11:7:72:516:97:99:Times:99:Times:Association of Nurserymen about $12,000 in 1930 ($130, 000 in 2009 purchasing power, White 1975, p. 132). 
7:179:13627:7:16:72:533:90:42:Times:99:Times:6 Another argument against patents for tubers was that infringements are difficult to prove for tubers, so that patent 
7:180:13746:16:0:72:319:74:99:Times:99:Times:rights would be difficult to enforce (US Senate 1968, p. 863). 
8:181:13809:0:27:72:528:708:144:Times:144:Times:nursery, a garden, or in the wild – were frequently patented.7  The Briarcliff rose, for example, 
8:182:13907:27:28:72:517:681:144:Times:144:Times:which was not patented, yielded 7 sports that were patented; Talisman yielded 14 sports that 
8:183:14000:28:27:72:532:653:144:Times:144:Times:were patented.8  Two sports of Talisman, Souvenir (PP 25) and Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt (PP 
8:184:14093:27:28:72:534:626:144:Times:144:Times:80) produced six sports, and every one of them was patented.  A sport of Briarcliff called Better 
8:185:14191:28:28:72:524:598:144:Times:144:Times:Times (PP23) yielded 13 sports; the USPTO patented all of them.  At least one of these sports 
8:186:14285:28:27:72:517:570:144:Times:144:Times:(PP452) yielded yet another generation of patented roses (Allyn 1944, p. 31, 50; and Fowler 
8:187:14377:27:33:72:164:543:144:Times:144:Times:1994, pp. 86-88).   
8:188:14397:33:27:108:536:510:144:Times:144:Times:In 1954 the USPTO ruled that “mere fortuitous finds” such as mutant seedlings were not 
8:189:14484:27:28:72:508:483:144:Times:144:Times:patentable, but Congress quickly amended the law to include “chance seedlings producing 
8:190:14572:28:28:72:522:455:144:Times:144:Times:distinct new plants, whether found in cultivated or uncultivated states” (White 1975, pp. 133,

8:192:14739:32:28:108:527:395:144:Times:144:Times:The PPA also excluded plants that had been introduced or sold to the public more than 
8:193:14825:28:27:72:536:367:144:Times:144:Times:two years before the patent application, but most of the plants patented by 1934 were developed 
8:194:14921:27:28:72:540:340:144:Times:144:Times:before 1930.9  In 1944, the patent attorney Robert Starr Allyn observed that “many of the patents 
8:195:15019:28:28:71:518:312:144:Times:144:Times:thus far issued appear to be invalid” and at least 61 of 610 plant patents granted by 1943 had 
8:196:15114:28:27:71:531:284:144:Times:144:Times:been developed before 1930 (Allyn 1944, p.57).  Most notably, nursery stock was exempt from 
8:197:15206:27:38:71:178:257:144:Times:144:Times:the rule of prior use.   
8:198:15231:38:27:107:538:219:144:Times:144:Times:Patent examiners were especially lenient in granting patents for nursery stock that Luther 
8:199:15322:27:23:71:501:192:144:Times:144:Times:Burbank had developed with financing from Stark Brothers and that was owned by Stark

8:201:15449:7:16:72:535:162:42:Times:99:Times:7 Even though the USPTO was officially in charge of determining whether a plant was “new and distinct,”,the PPA 
8:202:15561:16:7:71:377:146:99:Times:99:Times:allowed it to seek advice from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).   
8:203:15634:7:18:72:536:139:42:Times:99:Times:8 Talisman was the offspring of Ophelia, introduced in 1912, which was prone to mutation and produced more than 
8:204:15744:18:8:71:242:121:99:Times:144:Times:20 sports (McFarland 1947, pp, 191-192). 
8:205:15784:8:16:72:537:113:42:Times:99:Times:9 Allyn 1944, p. 55.  The principle of excluding plants that had been introduced before the Act was affirmed in Cole 
8:206:15901:16:12:72:527:97:99:Times:99:Times:Nursery Co. vs. Youdath Perennial Garden (1936) over a potential infringement of PP 110, the Horvath Barberry 
8:207:16010:12:11:72:534:85:99:Times:99:Times:plant.  Judge Paul Jones invalidated PP110 because the Horvath plant had been produced in the winter of 1923/24.  
8:208:16124:11:0:72:321:74:99:Times:99:Times:By 1943, the exclusion period had been reduced to one year.

9:210:16281:27:28:72:490:681:144:Times:144:Times:Burbank’s estate, including two for roses (PP65 and 66, Burbank’s Apple Blossom and 
9:211:16365:28:27:72:525:653:144:Times:144:Times:Burbank’s Golden Sunset) four for plums, two for peaches (PP12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 18), and 
9:212:16458:27:28:72:528:626:144:Times:144:Times:one for a new variety of cherry (PP41).  As late as 1937 and 1938, the USPTO granted PP 235 
9:213:16550:28:28:72:520:598:144:Times:144:Times:for Burbank’s Golden Comet (in 1937) and PP266, PP267, and PP269 for Burbank’s Copper

9:215:16725:27:38:72:478:543:144:Times:144:Times:posthumously patented roses, however, became a commercial success (Terry 1966).

9:218:16843:38:28:108:522:430:144:Times:144:Times:On August 31, 1931, the Patent Office granted the first plant patent (PP1) to Henry F. 
9:219:16930:28:27:72:511:402:144:Times:144:Times:Bosenberg, a New Jersey gardener (Figure 2) for New Dawn, a continuously blooming bud 
9:220:17016:27:28:72:534:375:144:Times:144:Times:variant of a disease-free and vigorous climbing rose that he selected and propagated (Journal of

9:222:17211:27:28:72:351:320:144:Times:144:Times:for a dewberry, and one for a new variety of carnation.11   
9:223:17271:28:28:108:532:292:144:Times:144:Times: Between August 1931 and April 1, 2009, a total of 19,973 plant patents were granted in 
9:224:17358:28:27:72:531:264:144:Times:144:Times:the United States.  From 1931 to 1940 the number of plant patents per year increased from 5 to 
9:225:17453:27:60:72:518:237:144:Times:144:Times:nearly 90 (Figure 3); with the advent of World War II, patents per year fell to less than 20 in

9:227:17591:7:16:72:525:170:42:Times:99:Times:10 New Dawn was nearly identical to a climbing rose that Van Fleet had discovered in his work at the USDA, but 
9:228:17701:16:11:71:509:154:99:Times:99:Times:this older rose bloomed once a year (a dominant trait caused by a single gene) while Bosenberg’s New Dawn 
9:229:17806:11:7:71:460:143:99:Times:99:Times:bloomed continuously throughout the year (following the recessive trait, Kile 1934, pp. 59-61).   
9:230:17903:7:16:72:533:136:42:Times:99:Times:11 Throughout the 1930s the average lag between application and grant was 321 days (calculated from data in “Die 
9:231:18016:16:12:71:508:120:99:Times:99:Times:amerikanischen Pflanzenpatente,” Wirtschaftlicher Teil, 1931-39).  More generally, the lag between a patent 
9:232:18124:12:11:71:524:108:99:Times:99:Times:application and a patent grant varies with the complexity of the patent and the workload of the examiners (Popp, 
9:233:18237:11:12:71:538:97:99:Times:99:Times:Juhl, and Johnson 1994).  For utility patents in the chemical industry in the 1930s, the lag between patent grants and 
9:234:18356:12:11:71:534:85:99:Times:99:Times:patent applications was between two and three years (Moser and Voena, forthcoming); for utility patents of sewing 
9:235:18470:11:0:71:358:74:99:Times:99:Times:machines in the 1870s, the lag was 140 days (Lampe and Moser 2010). 
10:236:18538:0:27:72:541:708:144:Times:144:Times:1945; after the war, plant patents recovered to 120 in 1957.  By 1970, the annual number of plant 
10:237:18636:27:28:72:204:681:144:Times:144:Times:patents declined to 52.        
10:238:18667:28:27:108:532:653:144:Times:144:Times: Nearly 45 percent of all patent grants between 1931 and 1970 were for roses.  The share 
10:239:18754:27:28:71:530:626:144:Times:144:Times:of rose patents was highest in the 1930s and 1940s; 295 of 592 plant patents between 1930 and 
10:240:18848:28:28:71:532:598:144:Times:144:Times:December 8, 1941, were for roses (Figure 3).  During the war, rose patents declined, reaching a 
10:241:18944:28:27:71:533:570:144:Times:144:Times:low of 4 patents in 1945.  After the war, rose patents they recovered, reaching nearly 70 patents 
10:242:19042:27:28:71:527:543:144:Times:144:Times:in 1955.  After 1955, the number of rose patents per year began to decline gradually, while the 
10:243:19138:28:37:71:335:515:144:Times:64:Times:number of other plant patents stayed roughly constant. 
10:244:19192:37:28:108:537:478:144:Times:144:Times:Information on the names of patentees (“originators”) from the patent documents reveals 
10:245:19280:28:28:72:512:450:144:Times:144:Times:that all of the top ten patentees were connected with major companies (Table 1).  Eugene S 
10:246:19371:28:27:72:537:422:144:Times:144:Times:Boerner (No. 1) was the single originator on 170 patents between 1940 and 1970; he worked for 
10:247:19465:27:28:72:514:395:144:Times:144:Times:Jackson and Perkins (J&P) for his entire career from 1920 to 1973 and assigned most of his 
10:248:19556:28:27:72:522:367:144:Times:144:Times:patents to J&P.  Herbert C. Swim (No. 2), whom his colleagues called “the best hybridizer of

11:264:20893:28:27:72:510:540:144:Times:144:Times:patents to large nursery firms.  For the late 19th-century, such assignments, which typically 
11:265:20987:27:28:71:542:513:144:Times:144:Times:transfer patent rights from the inventor to a firm that markets the invention, have been interpreted 
11:266:21088:28:27:71:532:485:144:Times:144:Times:as a sign of improvements in the markets for patented inventions (e.g. Lamoreaux and Sokoloff 
11:267:21182:27:28:71:540:458:144:Times:144:Times:1999).  In the 20th-century, however, U.S. laws effectively forced employees to assign inventions 
11:268:21280:28:28:72:533:430:144:Times:144:Times:to their firm (Fisk 1998, 2001), so that assignments are a more accurate measure of the share of 
11:269:21377:28:37:72:245:402:144:Times:144:Times:inventions that occurs within firms.

11:272:21599:27:28:72:531:310:144:Times:144:Times:compared with 58 percent of other plant patents.12  For example, Bosenberg assigned the rights 
11:273:21694:28:28:72:521:282:144:Times:144:Times:to PP1 for New Dawn to Louis Schubert, who began to market the rose through the Somerset 
11:274:21783:28:27:72:527:254:144:Times:144:Times:Rose Nursery.  Similarly, Robert L. Catron assigned the rights to PP 23 for Better Times to his 
11:275:21879:27:28:72:539:227:144:Times:144:Times:employer, the Joseph H. Hill Company, which developed Better Times to become “the backbone

12:289:22936:27:28:108:473:523:144:Times:144:Times: The importance of patents for commercial rose breeding may be due to two 
12:290:23009:28:27:72:524:495:144:Times:144:Times:characteristics that rose breeding shares with pharmaceuticals:  in both industries, the costs of 
12:291:23107:27:28:72:530:468:144:Times:144:Times:developing new products are high relative to the costs of imitation, and only a small number of 
12:292:23203:28:28:72:309:440:144:Times:144:Times:new products become commercially successful.   
12:293:23249:28:27:108:516:412:144:Times:144:Times:The origins of commercial rose breeding date back to early nineteenth century when 
12:294:23332:27:28:72:530:385:144:Times:144:Times:European merchants brought back Chinese “tea roses” from Asia.  European breeders began to 
12:295:23423:28:27:72:541:357:144:Times:144:Times:cross winter-hardy European roses, which produced clustered short-bloomed pink or red flowers, 
12:296:23518:27:28:72:538:330:144:Times:144:Times:with Chinese tea roses, which produced stems with one large bloom in white, pink, red and even 
12:297:23613:28:28:72:508:302:144:Times:144:Times:the rare yellow for several months (Steward 2007, p. 128).  By the 1840s, French breeders 
12:298:23703:28:27:72:532:274:144:Times:144:Times:succeeded in creating roses that bloomed repeatedly through the summer and fall (Zlesak 2007, 
12:299:23797:27:28:72:521:247:144:Times:144:Times:pp.  271-72).  In 1867, Jean-Baptiste Guillot of Lyon, France, introduced La France, the first 
12:300:23892:28:27:72:497:219:144:Times:144:Times:modern “hybrid tea rose” – a plant with a tall stature and only one large bloom per stem 
12:301:23981:27:28:72:515:192:144:Times:144:Times:(Harkness 1985, pp. 11-20; Zlesak 2007, p. 697).  Breeders relied on pollination by wind or 
12:302:24073:28:28:72:415:164:144:Times:144:Times:insects, and many new varieties originated from self-pollinating roses.  
12:303:24146:28:27:108:516:136:144:Times:144:Times: Scientific methods of rose breeding began in Stapleford, England, in 1868, when the 
12:304:24230:27:28:72:506:109:144:Times:144:Times:cattle farmer Henry Bennett took pollen from one rose to fertilize the stamens of another.  
12:305:24322:28:0:72:527:81:144:Times:144:Times:Bennett set up a scientific breeding station in a heated green house.  Similar to Stark Brothers, 
13:306:24422:0:27:72:528:708:144:Times:144:Times:Bennett relied on secrecy to protect his work: “self-interest compels me for the present to keep 
13:307:24519:27:28:71:534:681:144:Times:144:Times:secret” this “entirely new mode of culture'’ (Harkness 1985, pp.24-25).  Borrowing a term from 
13:308:24614:28:27:71:541:653:144:Times:144:Times:cattle breeding, Bennett promoted his roses as “pedigree” hybrids of the tea rose (Harkness 1985, 
13:309:24712:27:28:71:513:626:144:Times:144:Times:p. 27).  In 1884 he sold the red “William Francis Bennett” for the equivalent of $109,000.13 
13:310:24804:28:28:108:541:598:144:Times:144:Times: Using Bennett’s methods, 20th-century breeders created polyantha, short plants with large 
13:311:24894:28:27:71:529:570:144:Times:144:Times:sprays of small blooms, floribunda, medium stature plants with large clusters of medium-sized 
13:312:24988:27:28:71:500:543:144:Times:144:Times:blooms, and grandiflora, tall plants with small clusters of medium to large-sized blooms

13:314:25168:27:28:71:532:488:144:Times:144:Times:business, while roses of all types (hybrid teas, polyantha, floribunda, grandiflora, climbers and

13:318:25388:38:28:108:516:374:144:Times:144:Times:Prior to 1930, hobbyists and public sector researchers created a large number of new 
13:319:25473:28:27:72:510:346:144:Times:144:Times:varieties in the United States.  Walter Van Fleet (1857-1922), for example, improved Rosa 
13:320:25563:27:28:72:527:319:144:Times:144:Times:Rugosa and other wild roses to create hardy climbing roses that could withstand the climate of

13:322:25754:27:28:72:494:264:144:Times:144:Times:hybridizer for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).  In 1919 the Massachusetts 
13:323:25839:28:28:72:533:236:144:Times:144:Times:Horticultural Society honored him with the George Robert White Medal of Honor “for advance 
13:324:25930:28:27:72:485:208:144:Times:144:Times:in the hybridization of garden plants, especially of the rose;" the name "’Van Fleet’ is

14:331:26468:28:27:72:543:653:144:Times:144:Times:Rugosa magnifica, for example, is rated 9.0 out of 10 by members of the American Rose Society, 
14:332:26563:27:28:72:536:626:144:Times:144:Times:placing it in the top percentile.  Van Fleet’s rose Silver Moon is rated 7.8 (in the upper range “of 
14:333:26664:28:28:72:541:598:144:Times:144:Times:a very good to solid rose,” compared with an average of 6).14  Bosenberg’s New Dawn was based 
14:334:26758:28:27:71:509:570:144:Times:144:Times:on a sport of a Van Fleet rose; it is rated 8.5 (“a very good to excellent rose, recommended 
14:335:26851:27:33:71:343:543:144:Times:42:Times:without hesitation” (American Rose Society, 1999, p.3). 
14:336:26906:33:27:108:542:510:144:Times:144:Times:Van Fleet and other public sector hybridizers helped to spread scientific knowledge about 
14:337:26996:27:28:72:542:483:144:Times:144:Times:rose breeding among hobbyists.  Van Fleet published his “Rose Breeding Notes” in the American 
14:338:27090:28:28:72:538:455:144:Times:144:Times:Rose Annual between 1916 and 1922.  George C. Thomas, of the Society in Southern California, 
14:339:27183:28:27:72:510:427:144:Times:144:Times:argued that any serious rose gardener should try to hybridize roses: “No other form of rose-
14:340:27275:27:28:72:524:400:144:Times:144:Times:culture is so intriguing as breeding new varieties.  It involves but little expenses, and no more 
14:341:27373:28:28:72:534:372:144:Times:144:Times:than reasonable effort...Anyone who has the smallest of greenhouses is foolish not to hybridize 
14:342:27469:28:32:72:274:344:144:Times:144:Times:roses inside” (Thomas 1931, pp. 33-38).   
14:343:27511:32:28:108:520:312:144:Times:144:Times:Hobbyist rose breeders shared their advances freely “over the fence” (Ross 1994).  In 
14:344:27597:28:27:72:541:284:144:Times:144:Times:fact, one of the main goals of the American Rose Society (ARS) was to encourage the diffusion of 
14:345:27694:27:28:72:516:257:144:Times:144:Times:new roses.  In the 1920s, for example, ARS began to encourage the diffusion of Van Fleet’s

16:379:30407:27:28:72:539:681:144:Times:144:Times:p. 131).  Current methods of commercial rose breeding apply Bennett’s process: breeders extract 
16:380:30503:28:27:72:535:653:144:Times:144:Times:pollen from one flower to fertilize another and create a hybrid seed (de Vries and Dubous 1996, 
16:381:30599:27:28:72:540:626:144:Times:144:Times:p. 241); after that, they propagate seedlings by budding or cuttings to create thousands of plants.  
16:382:30700:28:28:72:538:598:144:Times:144:Times:Breeders, then, select plants with desirable characteristics, such as an intense color or smell, or a 
16:383:30802:28:39:72:428:570:144:Times:144:Times:specific shape, and propagate them to create the next generation of roses.  
16:384:30877:39:28:108:538:531:144:Times:144:Times:This process favors large commercial nurseries that can grow many seedlings at a time.17 
16:385:30965:28:27:71:534:503:144:Times:144:Times:Boerner, for example, created more than 250,000 crosses per year in the 1940s and 1950s as the 
16:386:31060:27:28:71:529:476:144:Times:144:Times:chief breeder for J&P (Harkness 1979, p. 117; Harkness 1985, p. 74; Beales 1998, p. 677).  By 
16:387:31154:28:28:71:489:448:144:Times:144:Times:1945, “all the large rose producers have their own research departments with a staff of 
16:388:31242:28:39:71:351:420:144:Times:121:Times:scientifically trained personnel” (Sinnock 1945, p. 96).18   
16:389:31303:39:28:108:519:381:144:Times:144:Times:Large producers, such as J&P, Conard-Pyle, Stark Brothers, DeVor, Weeks, and Hill

16:393:31654:28:35:72:177:270:144:Times:144:Times:are the leading firms.

16:395:31719:7:16:72:539:228:42:Times:99:Times:17 Selecting new plants from random bud variations would be less costly but sports with desirable properties are rare 
16:396:31837:16:7:71:521:212:99:Times:144:g_d0_f1:and must be noticed, selected, and systematically propagated to become commercially viable (Terry 1966, p.1). 
16:397:31946:7:16:72:527:205:42:Times:99:Times:18 Within these research departments, star breeders play an important role.  For example, Armstrong Nursery was 
16:398:32058:16:12:71:535:189:99:Times:99:Times:unable to develop the nursery stock of Herbert Swim after he left (Zlesak 2007, p. 712; McGredy and Jennett 1971, 
16:399:32172:12:11:71:540:177:99:Times:99:Times:pp. 65-66).  The rose breeding industry is also geographically concentrated, allowing firms to access a larger pool of 
16:400:32291:11:12:71:520:166:99:Times:99:Times:qualified labor.  In 1966 Armstrong Nurseries moved to Wasco, California, a city of 21,000 in the southern San 
16:401:32402:12:11:71:527:154:99:Times:99:Times:Joaquin Valley.  J&P moved its operations to Wasco when it merged with Armstrong in 1968.  Over the next two 
16:402:32511:11:12:71:535:143:99:Times:99:Times:decades, DeVor, Weeks, and other nurseries followed to take advantage of the 280-day growing season, sandy soil, 
16:403:32624:12:11:71:540:131:99:Times:99:Times:inexpensive land, and a growing pool of workers skilled in budding roses.  Today, more than half of all domestically 
16:404:32741:11:12:71:532:120:99:Times:99:Times:produced roses originate from Waco and the surrounding area (Clark 1993, p. 22).  In the 1970s, the cut flower (as 
16:405:32856:12:11:71:532:108:99:Times:99:Times:opposed to garden plants) business began to be dominated by Colombia, Ecuador and other tropical countries with 
16:406:32968:11:12:71:518:97:99:Times:99:Times:long growing seasons, cheap labor, and little regulation (Järvesoo 1983, pp. 323-324).  In 2006, domestic firms 
16:407:33080:12:11:71:530:85:99:Times:99:Times:made up less than 10 percent of the value and less than 5 percent of the volume of U.S. sales (USDA, Floriculture

17:411:33274:38:27:108:537:633:144:Times:144:Times:In contrast to the costly development process, replication is quick and easy.  Bennett had 
17:412:33365:27:28:72:511:606:144:Times:144:Times:already noted in the 1880s that the outcome of his scientific methods of breeding would be 
17:413:33456:28:28:72:519:578:144:Times:144:Times:vulnerable to imitation and he relied on secrecy to protect his inventions.  If discovered, new 
17:414:33552:28:27:72:506:550:144:Times:144:Times:roses could quickly be replicated by repeated grafting; a plant would produce 10 grafts by 
17:415:33643:27:28:72:535:523:144:Times:144:Times:January, which could be used to make 100 by March, and these could be used to make 1,000 by 
17:416:33735:28:27:72:538:495:144:Times:144:Times:May (Harkness 1985, p. 25).  As a result, the price of new roses fell quickly: this was equivalent 
17:417:33834:27:28:72:530:468:144:Times:144:Times:to more than a 90 percent decrease in the first year.  Once discovered, “a new variety would be 
17:418:33930:28:28:72:533:440:144:Times:144:Times:placed upon the market and within a year or so it would be listed in nearly all nursery catalogs”

17:420:34052:27:14:86:520:385:144:Times:144:Times:The only way a grower could make a profit on a new rose before 1930 was to build up, as

17:422:34238:14:14:86:518:357:144:Times:144:Times:top prices people would pay.  In a year or so, competitors would be building up their own

17:424:34420:23:28:71:524:320:144:Times:144:Times:For example, the U.S. firm Conard & Jones invested two years to develop Rosa Hugonis (aka

17:426:34603:28:27:71:526:264:144:Times:144:Times:propagated the rose and were able to capitalize on Conard’s advertising efforts, while offering

18:442:35702:28:28:71:531:499:144:Times:144:Times:began to weaken prior to the Act.  Between 1930 and 1932, the number of rose plants imported

18:444:35890:27:28:71:511:444:144:Times:144:Times:1932 (Figure 4).  This decline was too early and too large to be due to three roses that were 
18:445:35984:28:27:71:541:416:144:Times:144:Times:patented in 1931.  A more plausible explanation is that the Great Depression reduced the demand

19:483:38717:28:0:72:448:110:144:Times:144:Times:protection encouraged the creation of mass hybridization in the United States: 
20:484:38797:0:13:86:529:708:144:Times:144:Times:The Americans were the first to have plant patents and that fact encouraged the rise of mass

20:486:38985:14:24:86:260:681:144:Times:144:Times:(McGredy and Jennett 1971, p. 51). 
20:487:39020:24:28:71:492:657:144:Times:144:Times:Many of J&P’s most successful products, however, were based on European roses, and 
20:488:39103:28:27:71:536:629:144:Times:144:Times:especially Kordes roses, which J&P began to propagate after the onset of the war.  In 1939, J&P 
20:489:39199:27:28:71:508:602:144:Times:144:Times:licensed Kordes’ World’s Fair, which won one of the first four AARS awards in 1940 and 
20:490:39286:28:27:71:535:574:144:Times:144:Times:became a great commercial success in the US.  Its popularity allowed the J&P to capture a large 
20:491:39382:27:38:71:528:547:144:Times:144:Times:market share and eliminate the middlemen by becoming a major mail order retail company.21   
20:492:39474:38:28:108:520:509:144:Times:144:Times:In 1942, J&P introduced Pinocchio, which Kordes had developed in 1940 and named 
20:493:39554:28:27:72:534:481:144:Times:144:Times:after the Disney movie of the same year (Cunningham 2005).  Boerner used Pinocchio to create 
20:494:39647:27:28:72:515:454:144:Times:144:Times:Masquerade, of which Harkness (1985, pp. 75-76) says: “no rose of that kind had ever been 
20:495:39737:28:27:72:537:426:144:Times:144:Times:seen.  The nearest to it was an old China rose, Mutabalis, a shrub which proceeded from buds of 
20:496:39833:27:28:72:528:399:144:Times:144:Times:saffron to magenta in its old age."  Fashion, one of the first coral-colored American roses, was 
20:497:39930:28:28:72:521:371:144:Times:144:Times:Boerner’s second triumph derived from Pinocchio (Harkness 1985, pp. 75-76).  Boerner also 
20:498:40020:28:27:72:536:343:144:Times:144:Times:used Pinocchio to create Lavender Pinocchio (PP947), which continues to be prominent today.   
20:499:40114:27:28:72:513:316:144:Times:144:Times:He used Crimson Glory, developed by Wilhelm Kordes in 1935, to create Diamond Jubilee 
20:500:40200:28:37:72:186:288:144:Times:144:Times:(registered in 1947).22   
20:501:40226:37:28:107:521:251:144:Times:144:Times:During World War I, the ability to access foreign-owned patents and produce foreign-
20:502:40310:28:28:71:527:223:144:Times:144:Times:owned inventions had encouraged domestic invention in organic chemicals (Moser and Voena 
20:503:40399:28:27:71:528:195:144:Times:144:Times:2010).  World War II may have had a similar effect on U.S. roses.  Under the Trading with the 
20:504:40493:27:15:71:518:168:144:Times:144:Times:Enemy Act (TWEA), domestic producers were not required to pay license fees for roses that

20:508:40831:16:11:71:528:108:99:Times:99:Times:argue that the introduction of plant patents lowered the prices that nurseries charged to consumers.  Kneen (1948, 
20:509:40946:11:12:72:530:97:99:Times:99:Times:p.363), for example, observed that the thorn-less Festival rose, which was introduced in 1940, sold for “much less 
20:510:41061:12:11:71:537:85:99:Times:99:Times:than fancy new roses brought in pre-patent days” and that “Today buyers no longer have to pay $5 or $10 for a new 
20:511:41175:11:0:71:338:74:99:Times:99:Times:rose, $10 for a new iris or gladiolus bulb, $20 for a fancy dahlia.”  
21:512:41246:0:27:72:542:708:144:Times:144:Times:German or French firms like Kordes, Tantau, and Meilland had patented in the United States (US 
21:513:41341:27:28:72:512:681:144:Times:144:Times:Office of the Alien Property Custodian 1946, p. 202).  Boerner kept royalties for Kordes in 
21:514:41433:28:27:72:527:653:144:Times:144:Times:escrow and repaid Kordes after the war to help rebuild their firm (Cunningham 2005), but it is 
21:515:41528:27:28:72:527:626:144:Times:144:Times:unlikely that he could fully compensate the Kordes firm for the profits that it lost as a result of 
21:516:41628:28:38:71:162:598:144:Times:144:Times:U.S. competition.  
21:517:41647:38:27:107:520:560:144:Times:144:Times:Boerner’s floribunda were also based on European roses; he created them by refining 
21:518:41731:27:28:71:511:533:144:Times:144:Times:small-flowered polyantha rose that the Danish nursery Poulsen had developed in the 1920s 
21:519:41820:28:27:71:526:505:144:Times:144:Times:(McGredy and Jennett 1971, pp. 60-61; Harkness 1985, p. 92).  Thus, Boerner’s case suggests 
21:520:41912:27:28:71:518:478:144:Times:144:Times:that access to European roses was at least as important as patents to the development of U.S.

21:524:42057:31:28:108:519:344:144:Times:144:Times:Why did rose patents increase so quickly after the creation of IPRs?  Contemporaries 
21:525:42142:28:27:72:539:316:144:Times:144:Times:observed that nurseries that marketed new varieties without patents risked “having someone turn 
21:526:42238:27:28:72:523:289:144:Times:144:Times:up a little later with a patent” threatening to sue for infringement (Kile 1934, pp. 61-62).  The 
21:527:42336:28:27:72:532:261:144:Times:144:Times:“Plant Patent Act makes it almost a necessity to take out patents on all valuable new varieties”; 
21:528:42434:27:28:72:496:234:144:Times:144:Times:growers would soon learn “the necessity of handling only such new plants as have been 
21:529:42520:28:28:72:541:206:144:Times:144:Times:patented” (Kile 1934, pp. 61-62).  Large nurseries, which drove the increase in rose patents, were 
21:530:42619:28:27:72:506:178:144:Times:144:Times:more likely to be sued and may have used patents strategically to protect themselves from 
21:531:42709:27:38:72:121:151:144:Times:144:Times:litigation. 
21:532:42721:38:27:108:507:113:144:Times:144:Times:To separate increases in strategic patents from changes in innovation, we create an 
21:533:42805:27:0:72:523:86:144:Times:144:Times:alternative measure of innovation.  This measure is based on the number of new varieties that 
22:534:42901:0:27:72:508:708:144:Times:144:Times:were registered with the American Rose Society (ARS) between 1916 and 1970.23  Unlike 
22:535:42987:27:28:72:534:681:144:Times:144:Times:patenting, registering a new plant does not create property rights that could be enforced in court 
22:536:43086:28:27:72:530:653:144:Times:144:Times:(Loscher 1986, pp. 59-62), so that registrations cannot be used strategically in the same way as 
22:537:43183:27:28:72:533:626:144:Times:144:Times:patents.  Breeders register the name of new varieties for the simple purpose of naming the plant 
22:538:43280:28:38:72:406:598:144:Times:144:Times:and for the prestige that it brings to them and the namesake of a rose. 
22:539:43351:38:27:108:519:560:144:Times:144:Times: Registration data include unique names for U.S. and foreign roses.24  An entry in the 
22:540:43437:27:28:72:539:533:144:Times:144:Times:American Rose Annual of 1926 (p. 188), for example, includes the name of the rose, the name of 
22:541:43532:28:38:72:292:505:144:Times:121:Times:its originator, and the date of the registration:

22:543:43651:37:28:108:536:430:144:Times:144:Times:Matching rose patents with registrations makes it possible to estimate the share of newly-
22:544:43741:28:28:72:530:402:144:Times:144:Times:created roses that were patented.  One difficulty with this process is that plant patents typically 
22:545:43841:28:27:72:521:374:144:Times:144:Times:do not list the name of a rose.  To address this problem, we first appended common names to 
22:546:43933:27:55:72:527:347:144:Times:144:Times:patent records, using a publication of the American Association of Nurserymen (Plant Patents

22:548:44068:7:16:72:535:285:42:Times:99:Times:23 ARS was originally established in 1892, 16 years after the Royal National Rose Society in Britain was formed in 
22:549:44183:16:11:71:540:269:99:Times:99:Times:1876.  Although European horticulturalists had begun to discuss the establishment of an international rose register in 
22:550:44302:11:12:71:524:258:99:Times:99:Times:the 1910s, World War I disrupted their efforts.  ARS, however, pushed ahead and became an early leader in rose 
22:551:44413:12:11:71:531:246:99:Times:99:Times:registration. It was a “welcome candidate” in 1955 to become the International Cultivar Registration Authority (or 
22:552:44528:11:12:71:536:235:99:Times:99:Times:ICRA) for the Genus, Rosa L. (Vrugtman 1986, pp. 225-228), assuming global responsibility to register new roses.  
22:553:44642:12:11:71:516:223:99:Times:99:Times:Rose societies in Australia, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Africa, 
22:554:44753:11:12:71:509:212:99:Times:99:Times:Switzerland, and the United Kingdom serve as “regional representatives.” ARS is one of 70 ICRAs currently 
22:555:44859:12:11:71:525:200:99:Times:99:Times:operating under the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (ICNCP), charged with registering 
22:556:44970:11:12:71:521:189:99:Times:99:Times:names for different groups of plants.  Systems of biological registration date back to Aristotle’s classification of 
22:557:45087:12:11:71:526:177:99:Times:99:Times:animals and the Inquiry in Plants by his student, Theophrastus. The Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) 
22:558:45198:11:7:71:323:166:99:Times:99:Times:extended these lists to create the modern taxonomy of plants.   
22:559:45261:7:16:72:537:159:42:Times:99:Times:24 Commercial breeders typically employ different trade names in different countries.  For example, the French rose 
22:560:45377:16:12:71:541:143:99:Times:99:Times:Madame Ferdinand Jamin was marketed as American Beauty in the United States.  To create unique identifiers, rose 
22:561:45490:12:11:71:541:131:99:Times:99:Times:breeders developed a parallel system of code names, which consist of a three-letter prefix that designates the breeder 
22:562:45609:11:12:71:529:120:99:Times:99:Times:followed by letters or numbers that denote the specific variety. The competing systems led to disputes in the early 
22:563:45725:12:7:71:442:108:99:Times:99:Times:1980s, which ARS resolved by adjusting its classification system (Gioia 1986, pp. 265-71).  
22:564:45816:7:16:72:537:101:42:Times:99:Times:25 In 1930, J. Horace McFarland, the Annual’s long-time editor, combined this information with material on foreign 
22:565:45931:16:11:71:526:85:99:Times:99:Times:roses into the first edition of Modern Roses.  We use the 12th edition of Modern Roses (Young, Schorr and Baer, 
22:566:46043:11:0:71:102:74:99:Times:99:Times:2007).

23:568:46144:27:28:71:486:681:144:Times:144:Times:matched with common names.  We then use the variety’s name, its originator, and the 
23:569:46228:28:37:71:462:653:144:Times:144:Times:originator’s location to match patents with registrations.  For example, we match 
23:570:46309:37:24:86:331:616:144:Times:144:Times:‘Polar Bear’, registered in 1934 by ‘Nicolas’ with

23:574:46523:27:28:71:512:517:144:Times:144:Times:registration.  Some patents are matched with more than one registration because alternative 
23:575:46615:28:28:71:540:489:144:Times:144:Times:spellings or abbreviations are recorded to create a complete record of names.  For example, Irene 
23:576:46713:28:27:71:530:461:144:Times:144:Times:of Denmark is also registered as Irene von Dänemark and Doctor F. Debat is also registered as 
23:577:46807:27:28:71:514:434:144:Times:144:Times:Dr. F. Debat.  Duplicates of this type account for 17 percent of registrations, but there is no 
23:578:46903:28:27:71:505:406:144:Times:144:Times:evidence of systematic variation.  To be conservative, we repeat all tests with and without 
23:579:46995:27:38:71:126:379:144:Times:121:Times:duplicates.

23:582:47056:37:28:108:532:266:144:Times:144:Times:Registration data indicate that only a minority of new varieties was patented.  Including 
23:583:47146:28:27:72:518:238:144:Times:144:Times:duplicates, only 18 percent of new varieties between 1931 and 1970 were patented (1,341 of 
23:584:47237:27:28:72:507:211:144:Times:144:Times:7,436, Figure 5).  Excluding duplicates, only 16 percent of new roses were patented.  Low 
23:585:47327:28:28:72:520:183:144:Times:144:Times:patenting rates are consistent with results in other data sets that capture innovations with and 
23:586:47424:28:35:72:517:155:144:Times:144:Times:without patents.  For example, roughly 20 percent of machinery innovations exhibited at the

23:588:47558:7:16:72:516:113:42:Times:99:Times:26 The American Association of Nurserymen was formed in 1876 and is now called the American Nursery and 
23:589:47662:16:12:71:531:97:99:Times:99:Times:Landscape Association. It has administered the National Association of Plant Patent Owners (NAPPO) which was 
23:590:47771:12:11:71:528:85:99:Times:99:Times:organized in 1939 to address the “gross misunderstanding within the trade and in the minds of the public as to the 
23:591:47886:11:0:71:289:74:99:Times:99:Times:whole concept of plant patents” (White 1975, p. 254). 
24:592:47941:0:27:72:520:708:144:Times:144:Times:Crystal Palace World Fair of 1851 were patented.  Similar to breeders of fruit and roses, 19th-
24:593:48036:27:28:72:538:681:144:Times:144:Times:century inventors of machinery could not depend on secrecy to protect their innovations because 
24:594:48132:28:27:72:506:653:144:Times:144:Times:new machines (unlike dyes or other types of chemical innovations) could be easily copied 
24:595:48220:27:38:72:150:626:144:Times:144:Times:(Moser 2010).   
24:596:48236:38:28:108:540:588:144:Times:144:Times:The share of patented varieties increased as breeders learned to use the patent system and 
24:597:48327:28:27:72:539:560:144:Times:144:Times:became concerned about litigation.  In 1932, 11 percent of new varieties were patented; by 1954, 
24:598:48424:27:28:72:540:533:144:Times:144:Times:26 percent of new varieties were patented (Figure 5, excluding duplicates).  Patenting rates spike 
24:599:48523:28:27:72:488:505:144:Times:144:Times:briefly to 31 and 33 percent in 1942 and 1952, possibly due to changes in the speed of

24:601:48703:28:38:72:273:450:144:Times:144:Times:percent of new varieties were patented.27  
24:602:48746:38:27:107:508:412:144:Times:144:Times: Changes in the number of new varieties per year closely track the conditions of the 
24:603:48830:27:28:71:521:385:144:Times:144:Times:European rose breeding industry.  From 1900 to 1920, registrations per year stayed relatively 
24:604:48924:28:27:71:526:357:144:Times:144:Times:constant around 100, with a significant dip during World War I (Figure 6).  From the 1920s to 
24:605:49018:27:28:71:517:330:144:Times:144:Times:the late 1930s, rose registrations increased to above 200 per year, with a dip during the early 
24:606:49114:28:28:71:544:302:144:Times:144:Times:years of the Great Depression, when demand for roses decreased in the United States and abroad.  
24:607:49211:28:27:71:524:274:144:Times:144:Times:As World War I devastated the European rose industry, registrations declined to less than 100

24:613:49516:7:18:72:525:103:42:Times:99:Times:27 This decline cannot be due to truncation:  Our data continue until 1978, and roses that were registered by 1970 
24:614:49631:18:0:71:305:85:99:Times:99:Times:were patented within two years of their registration date.   
25:615:49693:0:27:108:510:708:144:Times:144:Times:Data on the national origins of breeders reveal that European breeders continued to 
25:616:49777:27:28:72:531:681:144:Times:144:Times:account for the majority of new varieties.  Consistent with historical accounts, the data indicate 
25:617:49876:28:27:72:527:653:144:Times:144:Times:that, until the turn of the 20th century, nearly all new roses were created by European breeders. 
25:618:49974:27:28:72:529:626:144:Times:144:Times:Moreover, all except two of the top ten breeders in terms of new varieties are European (Table 
25:619:50069:28:28:72:528:598:144:Times:144:Times:2).  Wilhelm Kordes Söhne leads the list with 259 registrations. Including 133 registrations by 
25:620:50165:28:27:72:535:570:144:Times:144:Times:the younger Reimer Kordes (No.10) increases the number of Kordes registrations to nearly 400, 
25:621:50259:27:28:72:512:543:144:Times:144:Times:double the number of registrations of the French nursery Gaujard (with 201 registrations).   
25:622:50351:28:27:108:498:515:144:Times:144:Times:Eugene Boerner is the only American in the list of the top ten breeders, with 198 
25:623:50433:27:28:72:518:488:144:Times:144:Times:registrations (No. 3).  Francis Meilland of the French family firm Meilland follows with 178 
25:624:50526:28:28:72:520:460:144:Times:144:Times:registrations (No. 4), then the German breeder Mathias Tantau (No. 5, 172 registrations), the 
25:625:50620:28:27:72:526:432:144:Times:144:Times:Spanish breeder Pedro Dot (no. 6, 154 registrations), the French breeder C. Mallerin (a retired 
25:626:50716:27:28:72:522:405:144:Times:144:Times:railway worker who acted as a mentor to the Meillands, No.7, 153 registrations) and Delbard-
25:627:50808:28:27:72:503:377:144:Times:144:Times:Chabert (No. 8, 145 registrations).  Sam McGredy, the Irishman who immigrated to New 
25:628:50893:27:28:72:271:350:144:Times:144:Times:Zealand, is No. 9, with 135 registrations. 
25:629:50936:28:28:108:531:322:144:Times:144:Times:Most strikingly, the data indicate that U.S. breeders contributed fewer varieties after the 
25:630:51028:28:27:72:529:294:144:Times:144:Times:creation of patents in 1930.  In the early decades of the 20th-century, when Van Fleet and other 
25:631:51125:27:28:71:516:267:144:Times:144:Times:public sector breeders and hobbyists were active, registrations by U.S. breeders increased to 
25:632:51219:28:27:71:517:239:144:Times:144:Times:account for 39 percent of all new varieties between 1900 and 1930.  After the passage of the 
25:633:51312:27:28:71:530:212:144:Times:144:Times:Plant Patent Act, registrations by U.S. breeders declined to 21 percent between 1931 and 1970, 
25:634:51406:28:28:71:418:184:144:Times:144:Times:when the next Act extended patent rights to sexually-propagated plants.

25:636:51478:23:0:271:343:133:144:Times:144:Times:CONCLUSIONS 
26:637:51491:0:27:108:499:708:144:Times:144:Times:Did the Plant Patent Act of 1930 help create the modern American rose breeding 
26:638:51570:27:28:72:539:681:144:Times:144:Times:industry?  Using plant patents as the sole indicator of innovation suggests that the answer is yes:  
26:639:51671:28:27:72:531:653:144:Times:144:Times:large-scale breeding efforts of American firms, such as Jackson & Perkins, Armstrong, Weeks, 
26:640:51764:27:28:72:521:626:144:Times:144:Times:and Conard-Pyle contribute a staggering share of U.S. plant patents grants between 1930 and 
26:641:51856:28:33:72:453:598:144:Times:144:Times:1970, and large commercial breeders dominate the list of the top ten patentees. 
26:642:51936:33:27:108:523:565:144:Times:144:Times:A closer look, however, suggests that patents played at best a secondary role, and that 
26:643:52024:27:28:72:524:538:144:Times:144:Times:U.S. breeders mostly used patents strategically to protect themselves from litigation.  Data on 
26:644:52120:28:27:72:541:510:144:Times:144:Times:registrations of new varieties reveal that only a small share of new varieties, less than 20 percent, 
26:645:52222:27:28:72:528:483:144:Times:144:Times:was patented.  Moreover, European breeders continued to contribute the large majority of new 
26:646:52315:28:28:72:541:455:144:Times:144:Times:varieties, and only one U.S. breeder, J&P’s Gene Boerner, is among the top ten breeders in terms 
26:647:52412:28:27:72:526:427:144:Times:144:Times:of new varieties.  In fact, the share of new varieties created by U.S. breeders dropped after the 
26:648:52510:27:28:72:528:400:144:Times:144:Times:creation of plant patents, from nearly 40 percent from 1900 to 1930 to slightly over 20 percent 
26:649:52606:28:32:72:174:372:144:Times:144:Times:from 1900 to 1970.   
26:650:52627:32:28:108:514:340:144:Times:144:Times:Notably, some of the most successful American roses, including Walter Van Fleet’s 
26:651:52709:28:28:72:527:312:144:Times:144:Times:hardy American climbers, were creations of the pre-patent period.  Other prominent American 
26:652:52801:28:27:72:535:284:144:Times:144:Times:roses such as Conard-Pyle’s Peace rose, or J&P’s Pinnocchio were originally bred by European 
26:653:52894:27:28:72:503:257:144:Times:144:Times:firms.  American nurseries began to propagate these roses when World War II suspended 
26:654:52980:28:27:72:526:229:144:Times:144:Times:European imports and talented breeders like Gene Boerner improved European roses to create 
26:655:53071:27:0:72:169:202:144:Times:144:Times:the American rose.
