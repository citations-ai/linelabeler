2:40:2570:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:I  study  the  impact  of  transportation  on  health  in  the  rural  US,  1820–1847.  Measuring  health  by 
2:41:2680:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:average stature and using within-county panel analysis and a straight-line instrument, I find that 
2:42:2778:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:greater  transportation linkage,  as  measured  by  market  access,  in  a  cohort's  county-year  of  birth 
2:43:2886:14:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:had an adverse impact on its health. A one-standard deviation increase in market access reduced 
2:44:2981:14:14:72:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:average  stature  by  0.10  to  0.29 inches.  These  results  explain  26  to  65  percent  of  the  decline  in 
2:45:3093:14:14:72:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:average  stature  in  the  study  period. I  find  evidence  that  transportation  affected  health  by

3:54:3406:0:30:72:182:710:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:1  Introduction
3:55:3421:30:20:72:539:680:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:In the four decades prior to the Civil War, the United States experienced a “transportation revolution”
3:56:3524:20:20:72:540:660:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:(Taylor 1951) that was in part responsible for the prodigious growth of the antebellum American economy
3:57:3627:20:20:72:540:640:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:(e.g., Atack et al. 2010).  This experience is often cited as evidence that transportation improvements
3:58:3730:20:20:72:540:620:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:are crucial to spurring and supporting economic growth in modern developing countries (e.g., Banerjee,
3:59:3832:20:20:72:540:600:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Duflo, and Qian 2012)—a view that has inspired massive investment in transportation infrastructure in the
3:60:3937:20:20:72:460:580:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:developing world (World Bank 2007) with largely positive impacts (see Donaldson 2015).
3:61:4023:20:20:86:539:560:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Despite the well known benefits of economic growth, transportation projects that induce it may not be
3:62:4124:20:20:72:540:540:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:unambiguously welfare-improving. In the antebellum United States the early phases of modern economic
3:63:4224:20:20:72:540:520:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:growth were accompanied by declining health as measured by life expectancy and average stature (Floud et
3:64:4328:20:20:72:540:500:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:al. 2011). Similar patterns have been documented in nineteenth-century England and in modern developing
3:65:4431:20:19:72:540:480:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:countries such as China and India (Deaton 2007; Floud et al. 2011; Floud, Wachter, and Gregory 1990;
3:66:4531:19:20:72:539:461:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Jayachandran and Pande 2017; Trivedi 2017),1all of which have experienced transportation revolutions of
3:67:4634:20:20:71:539:441:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:their own. If transportation improvements were in any way responsible for these deteriorations in health, then
3:68:4744:20:20:71:539:421:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:this impact must be weighed against the benefits of growth in assessing the welfare effects of infrastructure
3:69:4853:20:20:71:539:401:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:development. Little empirical evidence exists, however, on whether and how transportation improvements
3:70:4955:20:20:71:448:381:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:affect health, and economic theory shows that the impact may be positive or negative.
3:71:5040:20:20:86:539:361:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:In this paper, I provide such evidence by studying the effect of transportation improvements on health in
3:72:5145:20:20:71:539:341:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the rural United States in the period 1820–1847. Besides being of interest for its own sake, the antebellum
3:73:5252:20:20:71:539:321:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:United States is a particularly good setting in which to study this relationship. The transportation improve-
3:74:5361:20:20:71:539:301:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:ments of this period—consisting mostly of canal construction and improvements in river navigability—were
3:75:5465:20:20:71:539:281:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:transformative of the American continent and economy, involving the expansion of transportation infras-
3:76:5568:20:20:71:539:261:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:tructure into large areas that were previously isolated and undeveloped. Moreover, the time horizon of data
3:77:5675:20:20:71:528:241:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:available due to the historical setting permits the observation of permanent and long-term health effects.
3:78:5781:20:20:86:539:221:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:My analysis is based on two main data sources.  To describe the development of the transportation
3:79:5878:20:19:71:539:201:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:network in the antebellum United States, I use GIS shape files that have recently been made available by
3:80:5982:19:20:71:539:182:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Atack (2015, 2016, 2017). This source provides the location and opening date of all canals, railroads, and
3:81:6088:20:20:71:539:162:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:navigable waterways in the antebellum United States. I use these data to compute Donaldson and Hornbeck’s
3:82:6193:20:28:71:539:142:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:(2016) market access statistic, which is my main measure of transportation linkage, for all counties east of
3:83:6301:28:13:85:539:114:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:1This does not refer to the commonly cited counter-cyclicality of health (e.g., Ruhm 2000). Unlike this cyclical relationship,
3:84:6427:13:0:72:401:101:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:I am referring to a relationship between economic growth and health over a few decades.
4:85:6515:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the Mississippi River for each year 1820-1847. As is common in studying developing and historical contexts, I
4:86:6624:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:measure health by average stature, which reflects net nutritional status in childhood and adolescence (Floud
4:87:6732:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:et al. 2011; Steckel 1995). I use stature data from the records of enlisters in the Union Army (Records of the
4:88:6842:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Adjutant General’s Office 1861–1865), providing data on the heights, counties of birth, and birth cohorts of
4:89:6950:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:25,567 native-born white men in the birth cohorts of 1820–1847 in the Northeast and Midwest regions of the
4:90:7056:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:United States. I limit the study period to 1820–1847 because these birth cohorts are the only ones (in the
4:91:7162:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:antebellum period) for which there exists a sample of health data that is reasonably representative of the
4:92:7268:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:population (Zimran 2018). The combination of data from these sources enables the construction of a panel
4:93:7372:20:20:72:346:550:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:data set of county average stature and transportation linkage.2
4:94:7435:20:20:86:539:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:The main empirical challenge of this paper is to determine the impact of transportation improvements
4:95:7535:20:20:71:539:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:on health while addressing the possibility that any correlation between the two might be driven by omitted
4:96:7641:20:20:71:539:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and potentially unobservable variables.  For instance, local characteristics might spur economic growth,
4:97:7745:20:20:71:539:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:attracting transportation, affecting health, and creating a spurious relationship between the two. To address
4:98:7854:20:19:71:539:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:this possibility, I use two empirical approaches. First, I exploit the panel structure of the data to estimate
4:99:7964:19:20:71:539:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:specifications that include county fixed effects. Second, I use an instrumental variables approach. I construct
4:100:8075:20:20:71:539:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:an instrumental variable based on the principle that transportation improvements were intended to connect
4:101:8180:20:20:71:539:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:major watersheds (i.e., the Mississippi, Great Lakes, and Atlantic) to one another and to major cities.
4:102:8283:20:20:71:539:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:In particular, I augment the 1820 transportation network with the shortest straight lines creating these
4:103:8387:20:20:71:539:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:connections, and treat these lines as canals built incrementally over a period of 15 years. I then compute
4:104:8493:20:20:71:539:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:market access based only on the 1820 network and these straight-line connections, and use this alternative
4:105:8599:20:20:71:539:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:measure as the instrument for market access. This instrument builds on and shares an interpretation with
4:106:8703:20:20:71:539:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the straight-line instruments commonly used in the literature on the effects of transportation (e.g., Atack
4:107:8810:20:20:71:539:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:et al. 2010; Banerjee, Duflo, and Qian 2012; Chandra and Thompson 2000; Ghani, Goswami, and Kerr 2016).
4:108:8913:20:20:71:539:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:It also adds to this set of instruments by introducing a temporal component to them (see also Hornung 2015).
4:109:9021:20:20:86:539:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Using each of these identification strategies, I find a negative relationship between transportation linkage
4:110:9129:20:20:71:539:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:as measured by market access and health as measured by average stature. The magnitude of this relationship
4:111:9235:20:20:71:539:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:is large. According to my estimates, a one-standard deviation increase in market access was associated with
4:112:9342:20:19:71:539:171:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:a 0.10 to 0.25 inch decline in average stature, depending on the identification strategy. To put this figure
4:113:9450:19:20:71:539:152:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:in perspective, Zimran (2018) estimates that urbanites during this period suffered a height penalty of 0.29
4:114:9557:20:18:71:539:132:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:inches relative to ruralists, and Deaton and Arora (2009) estimate that college graduates enjoy a 0.7 inch
4:115:9663:18:13:85:539:114:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:2In practice, I do not use the average observed stature.  Instead, I use the individual observations of stature linked to
4:116:9784:13:0:72:330:101:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:individuals’ birth years, clustering standard errors by county of birth.
5:117:9857:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:height premium over high school graduates in the modern United States. This negative relationship is robust
5:118:9964:20:20:72:361:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:to the inclusion of numerous controls and a variety of time trends.
5:119:10031:20:20:86:539:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:I also investigate the hypothesis that improved market access reduced health by generating increases

5:121:10237:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:antebellum period, such concentration of population would have made previously undeveloped locations
5:122:10337:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:less healthy (Costa 1993; Floud et al. 2011; Steckel 1995). In support of this mechanism and consistent

5:124:10550:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:2010), I find evidence of rising population density in a county in response to increases in market access. I also
5:125:10663:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:find that the effects of market access on increasing population density were stronger in counties where the

5:127:10875:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:2002), and that the negative impact of market access on stature was stronger in these same counties. That
5:128:10980:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:is, counties where population density increased the most in response to rising market access were those where

5:131:11252:19:20:72:540:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:oration in health experienced in the United States at the onset of modern economic growth—a phenomenon
5:132:11354:20:20:72:540:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:known as the “Antebellum Puzzle.” This pattern is a fundamental stylized fact of American economic history

5:134:11569:20:20:72:540:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:has remained poorly understood due to a lack of well identified empirical investigations. In this paper, I
5:135:11675:20:20:72:540:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:provide perhaps the first piece of direct and plausibly causal evidence as to a potential explanation for this

5:137:11888:20:20:72:540:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:access over the antebellum period, can explain up to 65 percent of the decline in stature. Also in the spe-

6:157:13846:27:19:72:540:525:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Economic theory proposes a number of mechanisms by which transportation might impact health. The most
6:158:13947:19:20:72:540:506:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:direct are its potential epidemiological effects. For instance, transportation can carry disease along with
6:159:14054:20:20:72:540:486:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:freight and passengers, and might bring infection to places that it had once been unable to reach (e.g., Tang
6:160:14163:20:20:72:540:466:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:2017). In the antebellum United States in particular, this mechanism might have acted by linking relatively
6:161:14270:20:20:72:540:446:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:healthy rural areas to urban areas, where disease was prevalent, and carrying this disease from the latter to
6:162:14379:20:20:72:540:426:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the former (Floud et al. 2011). Conversely, transportation linkages might provide previously isolated areas
6:163:14486:20:20:72:540:406:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:with better health care by reducing pecuniary and non-pecuniary access costs, though this mechanism is
6:164:14588:20:20:72:540:386:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:unlikely to apply to the antebellum United States, in which the available health care was primitive at best.
6:165:14696:20:20:86:539:366:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Transportation can also affect health indirectly through its effects on income and development. Trans-
6:166:14798:20:20:72:540:346:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:portation linkages are often found to increase economic activity in newly linked areas (e.g., Duranton and
6:167:14904:20:20:72:540:326:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Turner 2012; Ghani, Goswami, and Kerr 2016), and the antebellum period is no exception (Atack et al.
6:168:15004:20:20:72:540:306:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:2010). The resulting rise in income would lead to improved health through consumption of more and better
6:169:15108:20:20:72:540:286:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:health-improving goods, such as food and medicine (Emran and Hou 2013; Fogel 2004). This growth can also
6:170:15212:20:20:72:540:266:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:generate increases in population density or urbanization in newly linked areas. This effect has the potential
6:171:15321:20:19:72:540:246:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:to harm health by increasing exposure to disease, both through increased contact between individuals and
6:172:15425:19:20:72:540:227:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:through the sanitation consequences of greater concentrations of population (Costa 1993; Steckel 1995). This
6:173:15533:20:20:72:540:207:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:mechanism is particularly relevant in the antebellum American context given the lack of adequate sanitation
6:174:15640:20:20:72:540:187:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:infrastructure and technology and absence of public health projects. Besides its impact on the level of in-
6:175:15747:20:20:72:540:167:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:come, transportation integrates newly linked areas to the larger economy, potentially affecting the volatility
6:176:15857:20:20:72:467:147:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of income, with theoretically ambiguous impacts on health (Burgess and Donaldson 2012).
6:177:15944:20:20:86:539:127:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Finally, transportation can affect health through its impact on relative prices. In the antebellum United
6:178:16049:20:0:72:540:107:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:States, the areas being linked to the transportation network were largely food-producing. Transportation
7:179:16154:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:linkages in this setting would tend to increase the relative farm-gate price of food: access to larger markets
7:180:16264:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:would increase the price that farmers could command for their output, while linkage to manufacturing centers
7:181:16372:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:in urban areas would reduce the price of manufactures produced there (Komlos 1987; Komlos and Coclanis
7:182:16474:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:1997). On the other hand, rising relative food prices would bolster the incomes of food producers. If the
7:183:16579:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:net effect of these changing relative prices was to reduce the consumption of health-improving goods, then
7:184:16685:20:20:72:259:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:health could have deteriorated in response.
7:185:16728:20:20:86:539:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Combining all of these theoretical mechanisms, the bottom-line prediction of the impact of transportation
7:186:16833:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:on health is ambiguous in sign, and is thus an empirical question. Yet there is relatively little empirical
7:187:16940:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:work to enlighten this theoretical puzzle. A considerable fraction of the work that does exist focuses on the
7:188:17049:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:antebellum United States as part of efforts to understand the progress of health during industrialization. Cuff

7:190:17268:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:or with better market access due to relative proximity to cities had worse health, as measured by average
7:191:17373:20:20:72:539:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:stature and death rates, than other areas.4However, limited information on the historical transportation
7:192:17477:20:19:72:540:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:network available at the time that these studies were conducted (Atack 2013), together with limited methods
7:193:17584:19:20:72:540:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:available to quantify transportation linkages, constrained these authors to describing correlations, often with
7:194:17695:20:20:72:540:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:only a single year of observation of transportation presence. Thus, these results are at best suggestive of the
7:195:17806:20:20:72:256:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:causal impact of transportation on health.

7:198:18054:20:20:72:540:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:are also largely suggestive, as they either are correlational, report effects on indices including health but not
7:199:18167:20:20:72:539:311:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:on health separately, study very small regions, or focus on inputs to health rather than on health outcomes.5
7:200:18276:20:20:72:484:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:These studies are also often constrained to study only the short-term effects of transportation.

7:202:18474:20:20:72:540:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:tructure on health. Tang (2017) studies the mortality effects of the construction of the railroad network in
7:203:18582:20:20:72:540:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:late-nineteenth century Japan. His difference-in-differences approach reveals an increase in mortality coming
7:204:18691:20:20:72:540:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:from new rail linkage that is generated by the spread of communicable diseases. Burgess and Donaldson
7:205:18792:20:21:72:540:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:(2012) give causal evidence of beneficial impacts of transportation on health by showing that transportation
7:206:18900:21:12:85:539:170:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:4Yoo’s (2012) result is more subtle, showing a positive effect of transportation in the Northeast and a negative effect in
7:207:19022:12:9:72:540:158:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:the Midwest. His analysis, however, does not exclude urban areas and is based on only a single year of observation of the
7:208:19143:9:7:72:160:149:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:transportation network.
7:209:19166:7:12:85:539:142:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:5It is particularly important not to consider an improvement in health inputs, such as improved consumption or access to
7:210:19286:12:10:72:540:130:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:health care, as necessarily generating improvements in health outcomes. In the antebellum United States in particular, and
7:211:19408:10:9:72:540:120:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:also in many developing contexts, apparent improvements in health inputs (such as greater income and consumption) are in
7:212:19528:9:10:72:540:111:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:fact accompanied by declining health. It is thus important to study health outcomes in order to determine the true net effect
7:213:19653:10:0:72:109:101:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:on health.
8:214:19664:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:improvements in colonial India reduced the increases in mortality in response to negative agricultural yield

8:216:19879:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:mains limited, in part because these studies find opposing effects and in part because of the limited number
8:217:19987:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of case studies. Additional studies are necessary to better understand these impacts and the mechanisms
8:218:20090:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:that generate them, especially given the potential value to policy makers in determining the welfare effects

8:221:20293:27:20:72:540:546:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:The quintessential transportation improvement of the antebellum United States was the railroad.  As a
8:222:20394:20:20:72:540:526:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:result, the impacts of this mode of transportation have been the subject of considerable and notable scrutiny
8:223:20503:20:19:72:540:506:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:(e.g., Atack et al. 2010; Donaldson and Hornbeck 2016; Fishlow 1965; Fogel 1964).  Although some rail
8:224:20604:19:20:72:540:487:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:construction occurred in the 1830s and 1840s, the bulk of antebellum railroad construction did not occur
8:225:20708:20:20:72:540:467:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:until the 1850s (especially in the Midwest)—after the study period for this paper. Instead, the improvement
8:226:20815:20:20:72:540:447:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of water transportation was the key component of the transportation revolution in the period on which
8:227:20916:20:20:72:540:427:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:this paper focuses. This included the construction of the canal network in the Northeast and Midwest. It

8:232:21429:20:20:72:540:327:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:attributes considerable economic benefits to canal construction, all of which are likely to have contributed
8:233:21537:20:20:72:540:307:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:to the ultimate health impacts of these transportation improvements on health. The most notable success
8:234:21640:20:20:72:540:287:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:stories were the Erie Canal (Segal 1961) and the Ohio and Erie Canal (Ransom 1970). Despite the notable
8:235:21743:20:20:72:540:267:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:financial failure of the latter, these canals contributed considerably to economic growth and development
8:236:21848:20:20:72:540:247:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:in the areas through which they passed, to the development of manufacturing and commerce in these same
8:237:21950:20:37:72:505:227:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:areas, and to the broader economic development of the Midwest (Niemi 1970; Ransom 1967, 1971).
8:238:22044:37:26:72:242:190:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:2.3  The Antebellum Puzzle
8:239:22070:26:20:72:539:164:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Any study of health in the antebellum United States is inextricably linked to the “Antebellum Puzzle.”
8:240:22172:20:20:72:540:144:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Despite an improvement in the standard of living according to conventional economic measures, such as
8:241:22273:20:20:72:540:124:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:income per capita and real wages (Costa and Steckel 1997), the antebellum period was characterized by a
8:242:22376:20:33:85:430:104:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:6The geographical development of all of these systems is described graphically in Figure A.1.

9:244:22470:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:precipitous decline in health. Between the first and second quarters of the nineteenth century, life expectancy
9:245:22581:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:at age 10 for males declined by about 3 years (Fogel 1986). Moreover, the average height of native-born
9:246:22684:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:white males in the United States—the tallest in the world at the start of the 19th century (Steckel 1995,
9:247:22789:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:p. 1920)—declined by between 0.65 and 1.25 inches (depending on the estimate) between the birth cohorts
9:248:22892:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of 1830 and 1860 (A’Hearn 1998; Floud et al. 2011; Komlos 1987; Zimran 2018). It was not until nearly the
9:249:22997:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:birth cohort of 1900 that average stature would begin to rise again (Fogel 1986; Steckel 1995; Zehetmayer
9:250:23102:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:2011). This pattern is generally interpreted as indicating that the early stages of modern economic growth
9:251:23208:20:20:72:353:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:in the United States were not unambiguously welfare-improving.
9:252:23270:20:20:86:539:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Despite a large body of research devoted to describing the decline in health during the antebellum period,
9:253:23376:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:a definitive explanation has not been identified. Recent scholarship favors a combination of two mechanisms
9:254:23483:20:20:72:539:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:(Floud et al. 2011).7One, thedisease explanation, holds that a variety of forces led to an increased exposure
9:255:23592:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f8:to disease during the antebellum period (Costa 1993; Fogel 1986; Steckel 1995). The second, thefood price
9:256:23697:20:20:72:539:470:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f3:explanation, holds that the decline in height was the result of a rise in the relative price of food that led
9:257:23806:20:19:72:540:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:individuals to substitute away from food consumption towards the consumption of manufactures (Komlos and
9:258:23910:19:20:72:540:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Coclanis 1997). Although these explanations hypothesize that forces beyond the expansion of transportation
9:259:24016:20:20:72:540:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:infrastructure in the period played a role in spreading disease and changing relative prices, both also posit
9:260:24125:20:20:72:487:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:a strong role for transportation, which, as discussed in section 2.1 above, can have such effects.
9:261:24223:20:20:86:539:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:The empirical evidence underlying both of these explanations is limited, largely due to limited data
9:262:24323:20:20:72:540:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:availability in this period. Like the evidence described above on the relationship between transportation and
9:263:24432:20:20:72:540:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:health in this period, much of the evidence that has been marshaled in support of either or both of these
9:264:24537:20:20:72:540:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:explanations is suggestive, based either on cross-sectional correlations or on national time series. To my
9:265:24643:20:20:72:540:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:knowledge, there does not exist any work that shows directly that any particular force caused declines in
9:266:24748:20:20:72:540:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:height.8This paper, building on recent improvements in data availability and in methodological approaches
9:267:24853:20:20:72:540:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:to studying transportation, contributes to addressing this limitation by showing that the antebellum decline
9:268:24961:20:20:72:540:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:in health may be in part the product of the adverse consequences of transportation improvements. This
9:269:25062:20:20:72:540:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:result alone cannot distinguish between the food price and disease explanations, but it does make progress
9:270:25168:20:20:72:540:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:towards understanding the phenomenon, and can shed light on these two canonical explanations through
9:271:25268:20:38:72:383:171:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:investigation of the mechanism by which transportation acts on health.
9:272:25338:38:13:85:539:133:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:7In fact, there are at least fifteen distinct explanations, some of which are summarized by Bodenhorn, Guinnane, and Mroz
9:273:25459:13:9:72:89:120:8:g_d0_f6:6:g_d0_f5:(2017, p. 175). Almost all, however, can be grouped into one of these two larger categories.8

10:279:25782:26:36:72:514:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:The basic specification that I use to investigate the relationship between transportation and health is

10:285:26324:20:20:71:539:497:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Because the outcome of interest is observed at the individual level but the regressor of interest is observed
10:286:26433:20:20:71:539:477:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:only at the county level, I cluster standard errors throughout the analysis at the county level. My initial
10:287:26540:20:20:71:539:457:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:analysis estimates this equation by ordinary least squares. This specification is comparable to that used by
10:288:26648:20:19:71:539:437:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:prior studies of the transportation-health relationship in the antebellum United States, especially Haines,
10:289:26755:19:20:71:178:418:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Craig, and Weiss (2003).
10:290:26779:20:20:86:539:398:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:This framework assumes that the effect of transportation on height is described fully by the relation-
10:291:26881:20:20:71:539:378:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:ship of terminal height with transportation linkage in the birth year. While previous studies suggest that
10:292:26987:20:20:71:539:358:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:transportation in the birth year is likely to be more important than in any other year of life (e.g., Steckel
10:293:27096:20:20:71:539:338:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:1995; Woitek 2003), it is possible to determine the consequences of relaxing this assumption. I do this in
10:294:27202:20:20:71:539:318:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Appendix B, where I find that transportation linkage around the year of birth is more strongly associated
10:295:27307:20:20:71:397:298:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:with terminal stature than is transportation linkage in other phases of life.
10:296:27384:20:20:86:539:278:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A key concern with specification (1) is that any relationship that it uncovers between transportation
10:297:27485:20:20:71:539:258:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and height may be spurious. For instance, a particular county may have been densely populated or highly
10:298:27588:20:20:71:539:238:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:urbanized for some reason besides transportation linkage, such as a favorable geographic location. When
10:299:27691:20:20:71:539:218:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:transportation infrastructure was constructed, the fact that this county was already developed would make
10:300:27796:20:20:71:539:198:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:it more likely to become linked to the network. Moreover, the sanitation consequences of population con-
10:301:27900:20:26:71:539:178:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:centration might make this area unhealthy. This hypothetical relationship would produce a negativeβin
10:302:28001:26:13:85:539:152:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:9I do not include individual-level controls (e.g., occupation) for two reasons. First, the Union Army data, which are my
10:303:28121:13:9:72:540:139:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:source of all individual-level information, suffer from a large degree of missing data. Limiting the sample to observations with
10:304:28249:9:10:72:540:130:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:data on all fields of interest would have serious implications for statistical power. This limitation is exacerbated by the fact
10:305:28377:10:9:72:540:120:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:that successful census linkage is required to observe many variables of interest, and requiring such linkage would further reduce
10:306:28506:9:10:72:540:111:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:sample size. Second, any individual-specific variables are more properly considered outcomes of the presence of transportation
10:307:28632:10:0:72:192:101:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:and are therefore “bad controls.”
11:308:28666:0:20:72:275:710:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:specification (1) even if the trueβwere zero.10
11:309:28713:20:20:86:539:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:One approach that I take to address such concerns is to augment specification (1) with the addition of
11:310:28815:20:37:71:505:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:county fixed effectsαj(requiring the omission of the county-specific controlszj) so that it becomes
11:311:28914:37:36:234:540:633:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f3:hijt=αj+γt+δa+βTjt+εijt.(2)
11:312:28941:36:20:72:540:597:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:This specification captures time-invariant county characteristics and exploits the panel structure of the data.
11:313:29052:20:20:72:540:577:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:It also improves on studies of the transportation-health relationship in the antebellum United States, in
11:314:29157:20:20:72:302:557:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:which panel data have not previously been available.
11:315:29209:20:20:86:539:537:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A concern that remains in equation (2) is that faster economic growth in a county-year driven by a force
11:316:29313:20:20:72:540:517:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:other than transportation might both affect health and attract transportation. The concern is similar to
11:317:29417:20:20:72:540:497:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:that expressed above, except that it applies to a county over only part of the sample period rather than
11:318:29521:20:20:72:539:477:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the whole, and would thus not be captured by the county fixed effectsαj. One approach that I will use to
11:319:29625:20:36:72:510:457:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:address this concern is to include county-decade fixed effects rather than simply county fixed effects.
11:320:29728:36:27:72:315:421:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:3.2  Measures of Transportation Linkage
11:321:29767:27:20:72:540:394:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:I use two measures of transportation linkage in the empirical analysis. The first is a simple measure that
11:322:29873:20:19:72:540:374:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:takes a value of one in years in which a county was linked to water or rail transportation, and a zero
11:323:29975:19:20:72:540:355:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:otherwise. While it is a straightforward measure, it faces some important drawbacks. First, it does not
11:324:30078:20:20:72:540:335:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:capture the impacts of new forms of transportation entering already linked areas. This is exacerbated by
11:325:30182:20:20:72:540:315:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the fact that all coastal counties are defined as having always been linked to the transportation network.
11:326:30288:20:20:72:540:295:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Moreover, this binary measure does not capture changes in the transportation network that affect a county
11:327:30393:20:20:72:540:275:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:but take place far away from it in the network. Perhaps the most important such change in the study period
11:328:30499:20:20:72:540:255:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:is the construction of the Erie Canal, which had profound effects on the Midwest’s ability to access markets
11:329:30607:20:20:72:341:235:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:despite all of the construction being located in the Northeast.
11:330:30670:20:20:86:539:215:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:To address these shortcomings, I use Donaldson and Hornbeck’s (2016) market access measure. Following
11:331:30771:20:20:72:539:195:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:an algorithm described in Appendix C, I compute approximate iceberg transportation costs,τijt≥1, between
11:332:30875:20:36:72:539:175:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:each county pairijin each yeart∈{1820,...,1847}. Market access in countyifor yeartis then defined as

11:337:30992:25:13:82:539:114:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:10Not all confounds must be in this direction. For instance, if better agricultural land attracted transport construction and
11:338:31117:13:0:72:297:101:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:raised incomes and health, a spurious positiveβwould arise.
12:339:31177:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f9:wherepjis the population of countyjin 1820.  The choice to use 1820 population rather than yeart
12:340:31273:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:population is a is made because allowing population to change over time would cause market access to
12:341:31373:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:capture both improvements in transportation linkage and population growth, which would have its own
12:342:31472:20:20:72:160:650:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:impacts on health.11
12:343:31492:20:20:86:539:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:There are two issues that must be addressed before the market access measure can be used. The first
12:344:31591:20:20:72:539:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:concerns the choice ofθ. In choosing the value of this parameter, I follow the example of Donaldson and
12:345:31694:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Hornbeck (2016) and estimate equation (2) by nonlinear least squares, taking the logarithm of market access
12:346:31801:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:as defined in expression (3) as the variableTjt. This estimation gives an estimate ofˆθ=−3.82(s.e.= 0.48),
12:347:31907:20:20:72:238:550:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:which I use throughout the analysis.12
12:348:31945:20:20:86:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:The second issue concerns the interpretation of the coefficientβwhenTjtis the logarithm of market
12:349:32042:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:access. Interpreting specific changes in this regressor (e.g., a ten percent increase in the logarithm of market
12:350:32154:20:20:72:539:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:access) is not informative, as the range of market access is affected by the choice ofθ, which in turn impacts
12:351:32264:20:20:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the estimate ofβ. Instead, the parametersβandθmust be interpreted jointly. I focus on the impact of a
12:352:32365:20:37:72:362:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:one-standard deviation increase in market access (0.30 log points).
12:353:32432:37:26:72:237:413:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:3.3  Instrumental Variables
12:354:32459:26:20:72:540:387:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:As an alternative identification strategy, I develop an instrument for market access that builds on the
12:355:32562:20:20:72:540:367:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:straight-line instruments commonly used in studying the economic impacts of transportation improvements
12:356:32665:20:20:72:539:347:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:(e.g., Atack et al. 2010; Banerjee, Duflo, and Qian 2012; Ghani, Goswami, and Kerr 2016; Hornung 2015).13
12:357:32770:20:20:72:540:327:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:It is based on the principle that antebellum internal improvements were intended to link major watersheds
12:358:32875:20:20:72:509:307:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:(the Atlantic, Great Lakes, and Mississippi) to one another and to major cities (Taylor 1951, p. 37).
12:359:32976:20:20:86:539:287:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Specifically, I draw a series of straight lines, depicted in Figure 1.  The first set of lines, depicted in
12:360:33083:20:20:72:540:267:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:panel 1(a), are the shortest connections between the major watersheds, based on the steamboat-navigability
12:361:33189:20:20:72:540:247:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of rivers in 1820.14The next set of lines, depicted in panels 1(b)–1(d), identifies the 25 largest cities over
12:362:33299:20:12:82:540:227:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:11I have repeated the analysis with population fixed at 1840 and with yeartpopulation. Results in each case are similar to
12:363:33421:12:7:72:405:215:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:those using 1820 population, though the interpretation is different with yeartpopulation.
12:364:33510:7:12:82:539:208:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:12Ultimately, the choice ofθis not very important. Any change in the value ofθused will be largely offset by changes in
12:365:33629:12:9:71:539:196:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:the estimated value ofβ(Donaldson and Hornbeck 2016, pp. 831–832). Indeed, whenθis set to−1, the estimates ofβare
12:366:33742:9:7:72:458:187:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:qualitatively almost identical: the numerical estimates differ, but their interpretation is nearly identical.
12:367:33851:7:12:82:539:180:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:13The precise methods generated in previous studies are not suitable for use in the context of the antebellum United States
12:368:33974:12:10:72:540:168:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:prior to the construction of railroads. For example, a Euclidean network of the type used by Banerjee, Duflo, and Qian (2012)
12:369:34099:10:9:72:540:158:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:is based on the existence of major cities that must be linked by transportation. However, in the United States, the major
12:370:34220:9:10:72:540:149:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:cities were all on the East Coast while construction of transportation was designed to link the East to the West. Similarly,
12:371:34344:10:9:72:540:139:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:Atack et al.’s (2010) survey cities instrument is better suited to the denser rail construction of the 1850s than to the earlier,
12:372:34473:9:7:72:292:130:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:geographically dispersed canal construction of earlier years.
12:373:34534:7:12:82:539:123:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:14I group rivers with the major body of water that they flow into. For instance, the Hudson River is part of the Atlantic
12:374:34655:12:10:72:540:111:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:watershed and the Ohio River is part of the Mississippi watershed. Panel 1(a) treats Lake Ontario as a separate watershed, as
12:375:34780:10:30:72:379:101:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:it was not connected to the other Great Lakes by a navigable waterway until 1829.
12:376:34861:30:0:301:311:71:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:10
13:377:34863:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:10,000 population in each census year 1820–1840 (though it was not until 1840 that there were at least 25
13:378:34968:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:such cities) and draws the shortest lines between these cities and the three major watersheds (Atlantic, Great
13:379:35078:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Lakes, and Mississippi), provided that these lines are not more than 300 miles in length nor originate in the
13:380:35187:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:South (except for Virginia, Maryland or Washington, DC).15The repetition of lines between panels 1(b),
13:381:35289:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:1(c), and 1(d) is not concerning, as the construction of a second line overlapping a first will have no impact.
13:382:35400:20:20:86:539:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:I then compute market access as above and in Appendix C, with the following changes: (1) I begin
13:383:35496:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:with the transportation network in its 1820 state; (2) I treat the lines of Figure 1 as canals; (3) I augment
13:384:35605:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the 1820 network by letting each line develop—beginning in 1820 for the lines in panel (a) of Figure 1 and
13:385:35711:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:from the decadal year for those in other panels—over a period of 15 years in equal increments, beginning
13:386:35815:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:at the originating city or at the easternmost watershed.16This alternative measure of market access is the
13:387:35921:20:20:72:484:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:instrumental variable, which I use to estimate equations (1) and (2) by instrumental variables.
13:388:36016:20:20:86:539:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:As with any candidate instrument, the key concerns are relevance and excludability. Relevance will be
13:389:36117:20:20:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:formally established in estimation of the first-stage equations but is already suggested by Figures 1 and 2(a).
13:390:36228:20:19:72:540:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Figure 1 (and comparison to Figure A.1) reveals that the location of these lines is a good approximation of
13:391:36335:19:20:72:540:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:actual construction. For instance, the line linking the Atlantic and Great Lakes watersheds in panel 1(a)
13:392:36440:20:20:72:540:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:is close to the Erie Canal; the lines in Pennsylvania in panel 1(b) closely approximate the construction of
13:393:36547:20:20:72:540:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Pennsylvania’s Main Line; and the lines in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois in panels 1(a), 1(c), and 1(d) are
13:394:36652:20:20:72:540:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:also close approximations to actual construction. Because these lines are used to compute an alternative
13:395:36756:20:20:72:540:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:measure of market access, they also affect counties away from where they are constructed, as the Erie Canal
13:396:36863:20:20:72:540:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:did. Moreover, as shown in Figure 2(a) for the whole sample and in Figure 2(b) for the specific case of
13:397:36966:20:20:72:540:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Montgomery County, Ohio (an arbitrary example), the temporal development of the market access implied
13:398:37067:20:20:72:344:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:by the instrument tracks well with that of the actual measure.
13:399:37129:20:20:86:539:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Excludability of the instrument requires the following assumptions. In the cross-section, the identification
13:400:37237:20:20:72:540:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:assumption is comparable to that of other straight-line instruments. It is that, after excluding counties from
13:401:37347:20:20:72:540:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:which the lines in panels 1(b)–1(d) originate, counties on or near the straight lines of Figure 1 are similar
13:402:37456:20:20:72:540:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:to those further from the lines except in their likelihood to receive beneficial surges in market access. The
13:403:37565:20:21:72:539:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:identification assumption in the second dimension—the time series—has fewer analogs in the literature.17It
13:404:37671:21:12:82:539:170:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:15These are actually based on the urban population of counties, rather than city populations. Southern cities are excluded
13:405:37793:12:9:72:89:158:8:g_d0_f6:6:g_d0_f5:to better capture the true lack of internal improvements there.16
13:406:37858:9:10:89:539:149:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:An example of the evolution of one such line is shown in Figure A.2. I have also used a 10 year development period,
13:407:37973:10:9:72:540:139:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:but the variable generated in this way does not satisfy the relevance condition for instrumental variables, whereas the variable
13:408:38101:9:7:72:261:130:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:generated with a 15 year development period does.
13:409:38150:7:12:82:539:123:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:17An exception is Hornung (2015), who creates a dynamic straight-line instrument based on the principle that future con-
13:410:38270:12:10:72:540:111:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:struction is likely to link ends of existing lines to target destinations along the shortest possible route. My approach differs
13:411:38398:10:0:72:267:101:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:from this by not being based on actual construction.

15:440:39532:33:19:72:540:462:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:is that counties closer to the origin of a straight line in Figure 1 are not fundamentally different from those
15:441:39643:19:20:72:540:443:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:further from the origins, except that they are likely to be linked to the transportation network sooner. A
15:442:39749:20:20:72:540:423:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:clear concern is that the origins of the lines represent points of interest, such as cities; but given the high
15:443:39860:20:20:72:540:403:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:costs of wagon transportation, excluding the terminus counties should render the remaining counties equally
15:444:39967:20:20:72:446:383:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:isolated.18I provide some empirical support for these assumptions in section 5 below.
15:445:40052:20:20:86:539:363:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:One concern with this instrument can be easily dismissed. Although the evolution of the straight lines
15:446:40154:20:20:71:539:343:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:is based on a fixed annual expansion, the instrument is not a time trend (indeed, year-specific indicators
15:447:40260:20:20:71:539:323:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:are included in all specifications).  Instead, the instrument, like the measure of market access, evolves
15:448:40365:20:20:71:539:303:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:discontinuously in response to a new transport link. An example of the evolution of the instrument and of
15:449:40470:20:20:71:539:283:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:market access in a single county in shown in Figure 2(b), which describes the experience of Montgomery
15:450:40572:20:20:71:539:263:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:County, Ohio. The rapid increases in market access in the 1820s come from the construction of the Miami
15:451:40675:20:20:71:539:243:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and Erie Canal, which passed through the county and linked it to the Ohio River. The rapid increase in the
15:452:40781:20:20:71:539:223:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:instrument in the 1830s comes from the passage of the straight line linking Hamilton County, Ohio to the
15:453:40885:20:20:71:539:203:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Great Lakes through the county linking it to the Ohio River. The smaller increase in the 1840s comes from
15:454:40990:20:41:71:409:183:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the completion of that line, completing the hypothetical linkage to Lake Erie.
15:455:41068:41:12:82:539:142:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:18This view is supported by Donaldson and Hornbeck’s (2016) finding that Fogel’s (1964) proposed canals were not good
15:456:41185:12:10:72:540:130:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:substitutes for railroads because of the value of railroads in reducing wagon haul distances. This implies that the reduction
15:457:41310:10:9:72:540:120:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:of wagon haul distances necessary to reach transportation infrastructure is particularly important, and supports the notion
15:458:41433:9:10:72:540:111:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:that areas even a short wagon haul away from a city would be relatively isolated—a view supported by the poor roads of the
15:459:41555:10:0:72:142:101:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:antebellum period.
16:460:41575:0:34:72:130:710:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:4  Data
16:461:41582:34:26:72:147:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:4.1  Sources
16:462:41594:26:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Information on transportation infrastructure is given by GIS shape files produced by Atack (2015, 2016,
16:463:41697:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:2017). These files, which also form the basis for Donaldson and Hornbeck’s (2016) market access calculations,
16:464:41806:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:provide the location of all steamboat-navigable rivers, canals, and railroads in the continental United States
16:465:41916:20:20:72:539:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:constructed or opened prior to 1914.19These files do not provide information on the location of turnpikes, but
16:466:42026:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:this omission is unlikely to have a major effect on results because of the high costs of wagon transportation
16:467:42135:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:(Donaldson and Hornbeck 2016; Taylor 1951). Until 1850, these shape files also provide the year in which any
16:468:42243:20:19:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:particular form of transportation first became operational (or navigable); after 1850, these are known yearly
16:469:42352:19:20:72:540:511:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:for water transportation, but only every two years for railroads until 1860. Together with the categorization
16:470:42461:20:20:72:540:491:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of all coastal counties (either on the Atlantic, the Gulf, or the Great Lakes) as having always had access to
16:471:42570:20:20:72:540:471:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:water transport, it is thus possible to determine whether a particular county was linked to the transportation
16:472:42680:20:20:72:540:451:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:network in any year in the sample period (1820–1847),20and to perform the cost calculations necessary for
16:473:42785:20:20:71:342:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the market access measure for each year in the sample period.
16:474:42846:20:20:86:539:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:The information on transportation that this source provides improves on that available in prior studies of
16:475:42952:20:20:71:539:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the transportation-health relationship in the antebellum United States. As discussed by Atack (2013), earlier
16:476:43061:20:20:71:539:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:studies of this period relied on potentially inaccurate information on the location of transport infrastructure
16:477:43172:20:20:71:539:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and did not have information on the opening dates of this infrastructure.  For this reason, the measure
16:478:43275:20:20:71:539:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of transport linkage used by Haines, Craig, and Weiss (2003) and Yoo (2012) was an indicator for having
16:479:43378:20:20:71:539:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:water transport in 1840. The new shape files of Atack (2015, 2016, 2017) enable me to improve on this
16:480:43479:20:20:71:539:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:measure, both through the improved accuracy of the locations of infrastructure and by providing a temporal
16:481:43585:20:20:71:304:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:component to the evolution of the transport network.
16:482:43637:20:19:86:539:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:I measure health using adult height. This measure, which is commonly used as an indicator of health
16:483:43736:19:20:71:539:232:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:in historical and developing contexts (e.g., Deaton 2007; Floud et al. 2011), is unique in the antebellum
16:484:43841:20:20:71:539:212:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:United States in that it is perhaps the only measure of health that can provide insights into health for the
16:485:43949:20:20:71:540:192:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:bulk of the population for a number of years.21Average stature is increased by greater calorie consumption
16:486:44055:20:20:71:539:172:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and a better sanitary environment, while strenuous physical labor, malnutrition, and chronic disease tend to
16:487:44163:20:10:82:481:152:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:19I have supplemented these files with the canals and rivers of the St. Lawrence and Champlain waterways.
16:488:44268:10:12:82:539:142:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:20The “year of transportation arrival” refers to the year in which non-wagon transportation first became possible.  The
16:489:44387:12:7:72:397:130:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:development of the transportation network divided by mode is presented in Figure A.1.
16:490:44472:7:12:82:539:123:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:21An alternative measure, the crude death rate, is available in the antebellum period, but only for a single year (1850). It is
16:491:44599:12:10:72:540:111:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:therefore not possible to exploit changes over time in the transport network, as I do below in studying the impacts on height.
16:492:44725:10:0:72:434:101:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:Time series of life expectancy are also available, but cover only specific subsets of the population.
17:493:44828:0:20:72:393:710:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:decrease average stature (Deaton 2007; Floud et al. 2011; Steckel 1995).22
17:494:44902:20:20:86:539:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Data on the heights of men born in the United States in the years 1820–1847 are available from the
17:495:45000:20:20:71:539:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:records of enlistments in the Union Army during the Civil War (Records of the Adjutant General’s Office
17:496:45103:20:20:71:539:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:1861–1865). This widely used source is informative of height, place of birth, age, year of enlistment, and place
17:497:45215:20:20:71:539:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of enlistment. I combine three random samples of this source. The first comes from the Union Army Project
17:498:45320:20:20:71:539:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:(Fogel et al. 2000), which provides information on a random sample of approximately 40,000 individual
17:499:45421:20:20:71:539:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:observations from the original records. The second is provided by Cuff (2005), yielding approximately 12,000
17:500:45529:20:20:71:539:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:additional observations of men born in the state of Pennsylvania and serving in Pennsylvania regiments.
17:501:45632:20:20:71:521:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Finally, I collected and digitized approximately 3,000 additional observations from the original records.
17:502:45737:20:20:86:539:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:As is standard in uses of these data, I restrict the sample to white men born in the Northeast or the
17:503:45838:20:20:71:539:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Midwest. I also exclude individuals measured before age 18, which, due to the timing of the Civil War,
17:504:45940:20:20:71:539:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:implies that the youngest birth cohort that is systematically observed is that of 1847, as this cohort would
17:505:46048:20:20:71:539:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:have turned 18 in 1865, the last year of the Civil War. I also exclude birth cohorts older than 1820 because
17:506:46156:20:19:71:539:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of the relative lack of representation of these older cohorts in the military. Finally, I limit the sample to those
17:507:46271:19:20:71:539:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:for whom county of birth could be determined and for whom height, birth year, and age of measurement
17:508:46371:20:20:71:539:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:are known.23After imposing these restrictions, 31,403 observations remained for all counties (rural and
17:509:46474:20:20:71:497:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:otherwise). For a subset of these observations, the county of enlistment could also be determined.
17:510:46572:20:20:86:539:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:For two reasons I restrict attention to individuals born in counties that had no urban population in
17:511:46672:20:20:71:539:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:1820, which reduces the sample to 25,567 individuals.24First, there is little variation over time in the
17:512:46776:20:20:72:540:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:transportation linkage of the excluded counties, as they are nearly all on major transport routes in 1820.
17:513:46882:20:20:72:540:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Second, there are many forces that may have affected health in cities that would be difficult to disentangle.
17:514:46991:20:20:86:539:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A key question regarding the enlistment data is whether they are representative of the broader population
17:515:47096:20:15:72:540:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of interest—native-born white males in the birth cohorts of 1820–1847. The over-sampling of Pennsylvanians
17:516:47202:15:13:82:539:256:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:22Although declining height is generally understood to imply deteriorating health in historical contexts (e.g., Fogel 1986;
17:517:47325:13:9:72:540:243:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:Steckel 1995), it is also possible that declining height might be an indication of a shift from selection to scarring.  That
17:518:47449:9:10:72:540:234:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:is, declining average height might actually indicate better health if it allowed individuals who would have died in infancy to
17:519:47575:10:9:72:540:224:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:survive but to reach shorter average terminal height than those who would have survived to adulthood in the absence of improved
17:520:47702:9:9:72:540:215:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:health (Deaton 2007). Unfortunately, the data necessary to determine whether changing height is the result of selection or
17:521:47824:9:10:72:540:206:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:scarring in the context of this paper are not available. There exist data on mortality (Haines, Craig, and Weiss 2003), but
17:522:47947:10:9:72:540:196:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:these are available only for 1850 and thus do not permit the same panel analysis as do the height data. As a result, I rely on
17:523:48073:9:10:72:540:187:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:the standard interpretation of the historical heights literature, on the negative correlation between terminal height and those
17:524:48200:10:9:72:540:177:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:mortality rates that are observed in this period (e.g., Floud et al. 2011; Fogel 1986; Haines, Craig, and Weiss 2003; Steckel
17:525:48325:9:10:72:540:168:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:1995), and on the results presented in Table A.1 showing that death rates were greater in counties with greater market access,
17:526:48451:10:9:72:89:158:8:g_d0_f6:6:g_d0_f5:to interpret declines in average stature as deteriorations in health, and vice versa.23
17:527:48538:9:10:89:539:149:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:In most cases, a county of birth is directly reported, and the individual is assigned to that county. In some cases, a city or
17:528:48664:10:9:72:540:139:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:town of birth was reported instead. These were manually assigned to the appropriate county. In cases where a state of birth
17:529:48787:9:10:72:540:130:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:is reported but no county is reported, and in which the individual was linked to a census in 1850 or 1860 (linkage was only
17:530:48910:10:9:72:540:120:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:performed for observations collected by Fogel et al. 2000), the individual is assigned to his county of residence in the first census
17:531:49043:9:7:72:160:111:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:in which he is observed.
17:532:49067:7:33:82:379:104:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:24Figure A.3 indicates the counties removed from the sample by this restriction.
17:533:49147:33:0:301:311:71:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:15
18:534:49149:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:is one obvious concern, which I address by re-weighting so that the distribution of states of residence matches
18:535:49260:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:that of the 1860 census. A more nuanced concern is that selection into military service was non-random
18:536:49362:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:(Bodenhorn, Guinnane, and Mroz 2017). While this is theoretically a valid concern, its potential severity is
18:537:49470:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:mitigated by the fact that nearly half of the population at risk for observation and military service enlisted
18:538:49580:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:(Zimran 2018). For this reason, the Union Army data are considered to be representative of the white male
18:539:49685:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:population of the Northern states (Fogel et al. 2000). This view is reinforced by Zimran’s (2018) formal
18:540:49789:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:investigation of bias in historical height data sources, which finds that the height data provided by the
18:541:49894:20:20:72:309:570:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:Union Army records suffer from relatively little bias.25
18:542:49950:20:20:86:539:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Another concern is that entrance into the Union Army was subject to a minimum height requirement.
18:543:50047:20:20:71:539:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Although this requirement was not stringently enforced, the left tail of the height distribution was under-
18:544:50154:20:20:71:539:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:represented.26The common approach in the historical heights literature is to use a reduced-sample maximum
18:545:50259:20:20:71:539:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:likelihood estimator that omits any observations below the cutoff point and assumes normality of the stature
18:546:50367:20:20:71:539:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:distribution (A’Hearn 1998). In the present context, however, the omission of data is undesirable because
18:547:50472:20:19:71:539:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of the considerable loss of degrees of freedom through the inclusion of county fixed effects in the main
18:548:50576:19:20:71:539:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:specifications and because of the subsequent introduction of instrumental variables. As a result, the results
18:549:50685:20:20:71:356:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:reported below do not use such a truncation-corrected regression.
18:550:50750:20:20:86:539:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Finally, I gather county-level data from the decennial United States censuses of 1820–1850 (Manson et al.
18:551:50855:20:20:71:539:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:2017). This source provides county-level population, urban population (which, following the standard census
18:552:50962:20:20:71:539:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:definition, is the number of people living in places of population 2,500 or greater), and data on agricultural
18:553:51072:20:20:71:539:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and manufacturing production and employment. I supplement these data with Craig, Copland, and Weiss’s
18:554:51173:20:20:71:539:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:(2012) data on the nutritional value of agricultural production for 1840 and 1850 and with data on suitability
18:555:51283:20:20:71:436:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:for wheat and corn production from the Food and Agriculture Organization (2002).
18:556:51363:20:20:86:539:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:I standardize all data—including the transportation linkage indicator, market access computations, as-
18:557:51465:20:20:71:539:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:signment of counties of birth, and the county-specific data described above—to 1860 county boundaries. I
18:558:51569:20:20:71:539:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:focus on 1860 counties because the counties of birth of enlisters are reported in the years 1861–1865, and
18:559:51675:20:20:71:539:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:enlisters are likely to have reported their place of birth based on the boundaries existing at the time of the
18:560:51785:20:49:71:539:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:report. Where necessary, I standardize variables to 1860 county boundaries using Hornbeck’s (2010) method.
18:561:51891:49:12:82:539:142:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:25The issues of selection bias also inform my choice to focus on the birth cohorts of 1820–1847.  While height data are
18:562:52010:12:10:72:540:130:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:available from military records for cohorts throughout the later antebellum period and nineteenth century, Zimran (2018) shows
18:563:52136:10:9:72:540:120:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:that combining data from the Civil War and from later periods can lead to strong selection bias, generated in part by the fact
18:564:52262:9:7:72:534:111:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:that after the end of the Civil War, only a small fraction of the population entered the military and had its height observed.
18:565:52388:7:33:82:194:104:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:26This is shown in Figure A.4.

19:568:52443:27:20:72:540:683:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Using the sources described above, I create and merge two data sets. The first is a panel data set with
19:569:52546:20:20:72:540:663:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:observations at the county-year level on transportation linkage and market access.  The second provides
19:570:52649:20:20:72:540:643:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:individual-level data from the Union Army on native-born white males with known height, county of birth,
19:571:52753:20:20:72:540:623:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:year of birth, and age of measurement, born between 1820 and 1847. Merging these two data sets links each
19:572:52858:20:19:72:485:603:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:individual in Union Army data to the characteristics of his county of birth in his year of birth.
19:573:52955:19:20:86:539:584:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Table 1 summarizes the county-level measures of transportation linkage, divided by region and decadal
19:574:53056:20:20:72:540:564:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:year, and weighted by population.  There is a clear pattern of growth over time in the fraction of the
19:575:53158:20:20:72:540:544:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:population living in a county linked to the transportation network. In the entire sample region, less than 40
19:576:53267:20:20:72:540:524:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:percent of the population lived in a county that was linked to the transportation network in 1820. By 1850,
19:577:53374:20:20:72:540:504:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:this fraction had risen to over 80 percent. The Northeast and the Midwest viewed separately exhibit similar
19:578:53481:20:22:72:539:484:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:patterns, although the population of the Northeast is consistently more linked than is that of the Midwest.

19:590:54475:31:20:86:539:314:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Figure3 provides a graphical summary of the spread of transportation linkage over this period. Panel
19:591:54575:20:20:72:540:294:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:3(a) shows that the transportation network gradually spread inland during this period. The sample period
19:592:54679:20:20:72:540:274:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:began with only the coasts and the counties bordering the major internal waterways being linked to the
19:593:54781:20:20:72:540:254:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:network, and concluded with much of the interior being linked. However, as discussed in section 3.2 above,
19:594:54887:20:20:72:540:234:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:this binary measure is problematic. Beyond the conceptual difficulties that it poses, there simply are not
19:595:54993:20:20:72:540:214:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:many observations of height data in counties experiencing changes in transport linkage. This is shown in
19:596:55097:20:19:72:540:194:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:panel 3(b), which isolates the counties in which there was a change in transportation linkage between the
19:597:55202:19:20:72:540:175:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:years 1820 and 1847 and divides them into three groups. The first (shaded in the lightest color), which
19:598:55305:20:20:72:540:155:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:represents many of the counties in the South or westernmost Midwest are not represented by any individual
19:599:55410:20:20:72:540:135:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:height observations, or all the representation comes from before or after the change in transportation linkage.
19:600:55521:20:0:72:540:115:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:The second group (shaded somewhat darker) has individual height observations from both before and after
20:601:55626:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the change in linkage, but has only a small number of observations of stature in at least one of these groups.
20:602:55736:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Only the third group (the darkest shade, besides the black background), consisting of 31 counties, mostly
20:603:55841:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:in Pennsylvania, has at least 25 observations of individual heights both before and after the change in
20:604:55944:20:22:72:171:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:transportation linkage.

20:607:56071:17:9:72:540:311:8:g_d0_f20:8:g_d0_f6:Note:Panel 3(a) presents the year in which each county received a transport link, treating coastal counties and counties with
20:608:56196:9:10:72:540:302:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:an always navigable river as being linked in 1787. Panel 3(b) marks counties experiencing a change in transport linkage in
20:609:56318:10:9:72:540:292:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:1820–1847. Counties in black experienced no change in transportation linkage between 1820 and 1847. The lightest colored
20:610:56438:9:10:72:540:283:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:counties experienced a change in transportation linkage in this period, but have no observations either before or after the
20:611:56561:10:9:72:540:273:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:change. The darker counties have observations both before and after the transportation change, but only the darkest counties
20:612:56685:9:33:72:471:264:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:have at least 25 observations both before and after the change. Sample region indicated by thick boundary.
20:613:56791:33:20:86:539:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Fortunately, the market access measure helps to address this concern. In particular, it generates variation
20:614:56898:20:20:72:540:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:in the magnitude of transportation linkages and allows new linkages to affect counties other than only those
20:615:57006:20:20:72:540:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:through which the infrastructure passes. The set of “treated” counties can thus be considered larger and
20:616:57110:20:20:72:540:171:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:there is more variation in the treatment. This measure is also summarized in Table 1. As with the linkage
20:617:57215:20:20:72:540:151:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:measure, this measure shows patterns of growth over the study period, and of greater market access in the
20:618:57320:20:20:72:540:131:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Northeast than in the Midwest. Directly interpreting the magnitude of the market access measure is not
20:619:57422:20:0:72:540:111:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:possible given the discussion of section 3.2 above, but it is still possible to compare the changes over time
21:620:57533:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and differences over regions in other terms. For instance, the increase between 1820 and 1850 is equal to
21:621:57638:20:20:72:357:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:about two and a half standard deviations of the measure in 1850.
21:622:57702:20:20:86:539:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:The development of the market access measure over time is described graphically in Figure 4.  This
21:623:57800:20:20:72:539:650:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:Figure depicts the change in market access in each decade, shading counties with greater increases darker.27
21:624:57908:20:20:71:539:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:It shows that market access captures changes that transportation linkage does not. For instance, the counties
21:625:58017:20:20:71:539:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:in the sample region with greatest increase in market access between 1820 and 1830 are those bordering the
21:626:58123:20:20:71:539:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:upper Mississippi and the Great Lakes, as well as those in western New York. These changes reflect the
21:627:58225:20:20:71:539:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:opening of the Erie Canal and of the upper Mississippi. Between 1830 and 1840, large increases are observed
21:628:58332:20:20:71:539:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:in central Pennsylvania and in Indiana and Ohio, reflecting canal construction. Finally, between 1840 and
21:629:58437:20:20:71:487:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:1850, large increases are again observed in Indiana and Ohio, also reflecting canal construction.
21:630:58534:20:20:86:539:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Table 2 provides summary statistics at the individual level for heights and for other variables for the
21:631:58637:20:20:71:539:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:complete sample and for various subsamples. Column (1) represents the benchmark sample of analysis—
21:632:58736:20:20:71:539:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:native-born white males whose counties of birth had no urban population in 1820. Columns (2) and (3)
21:633:58836:20:19:71:539:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:divide the sample by region, and columns (4) and (5) divide the sample by whether the individual’s county
21:634:58941:19:20:71:481:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of birth was linked or unlinked to the transportation network in the individual’s year of birth.
21:635:59037:20:20:86:547:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A majority of the sample was born in the Northeast (even after adjusting for the Pennsylvania oversample)—
21:636:59143:20:20:71:539:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:a mechanical consequence of weighting the data to reflect state population in 1860. Figure 5 delves into the
21:637:59251:20:20:71:539:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:geographic distribution of data in further detail. It presents the number of individual height observations
21:638:59358:20:20:71:539:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:by county, separating Pennsylvania from the rest of the country as a result of its over-representation in the
21:639:59467:20:20:71:539:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:sample. On the whole, the sample tends to draw from the more populous areas of the country. Importantly,
21:640:59571:20:20:71:363:311:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:it includes almost all counties in the Northeast and the Midwest.28
21:641:59638:20:20:86:539:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Table 2 also shows that the benchmark sample was 68.1 inches tall on average, and columns (2) and (3)
21:642:59739:20:20:71:539:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:reveal that the Northeast suffered a height disadvantage of about half an inch relative to the Midwest. A
21:643:59844:20:20:71:509:251:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:height disadvantage of about 0.4 inches is present for those born in transportation-linked counties.29
21:644:59946:20:20:86:539:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:There are also differences between regions and between linked and unlinked counties in measures of
21:645:60044:20:20:71:539:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:population concentration. Consistent with the expected effects of transportation linkage (and with a variety
21:646:60152:20:21:71:539:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of endogeneity concerns), there is a considerable advantage in urbanization and population density at birth
21:647:60259:21:12:82:539:170:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:27The scale in each panel is different, dividing counties by deciles of the increase in market access. The levels of market
21:648:60382:12:9:72:89:158:8:g_d0_f6:6:g_d0_f5:access in each year are presented in Figure A.5.28
21:649:60432:9:10:89:539:149:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:The number of observations by birth cohort is given in Figure A.6. The number of observations is increasing in the birth
21:650:60552:10:9:72:540:139:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:cohorts from 1820 to the early 1840s, consistent with the idea that younger individuals would be more likely to join the military.

24:721:65169:26:20:72:540:232:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:I begin the analysis by estimating equation (1) by ordinary least squares using the binary indicator of
24:722:65272:20:20:72:539:212:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:transportation linkage as the explanatory variable of interestTjt. Results of this estimation are presented
24:723:65379:20:20:72:540:192:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:in columns (1)–(5) of Table 3. The regression of column (1), which includes only birth year indicators, age-
24:724:65487:20:20:72:540:172:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of-measurement indicators, and no other controls, yields a negative and statistically significant relationship
24:725:65597:20:20:72:540:152:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:between transportation presence in the birth year and average stature. This relationship is robust to the
24:726:65702:20:31:72:540:132:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:inclusion of state-specific fixed effects in column (2), though this addition reduces the magnitude of the

25:728:65902:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:estimated coefficient by about half. This latter estimate indicates that individuals whose counties of birth
25:729:66010:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:had some sort of transportation linkage in their birth year were 0.17 inches shorter than those whose counties
25:730:66120:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of birth were unlinked in their year of birth. This magnitude is large compared to the contemporaneous urban
25:731:66228:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:height penalty of 0.29 inches (Zimran 2018). It is also roughly comparable in magnitude to the estimates
25:732:66332:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of Haines, Craig, and Weiss (2003), whose benchmark results indicate that transportation linkage in the
25:733:66435:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:county of birth (though not necessarily in the year of birth) was associated with a height penalty of about
25:734:66542:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:0.25 inches.32This similarity of results is not trivial, as my transportation measure, due to the availability
25:735:66652:20:23:71:380:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of Atack’s (2015, 2016, 2017) data, is more refined, as discussed above.

25:757:68246:20:20:72:540:230:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of these variables are included in log form and I also include the log of population in 1840 and 1850 in
25:758:68350:20:20:72:540:210:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:order to make the other measures effectively per-capita.  I also include third-degree polynomials in the
25:759:68454:20:20:72:540:190:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:logarithm of distance from New York and Cincinnati. These controls are intended to capture a variety of
25:760:68557:20:20:72:540:170:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:county characteristics, such as agricultural productivity, density, and geography, that might generate health
25:761:68666:20:20:72:540:150:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:differences even in the absence of a transport link. The post-1820 values are included with full recognition
25:762:68774:20:26:72:540:130:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:that their 1820 values would be preferable (later values may be “bad controls”). However, due to the limited
25:763:68882:26:33:82:447:104:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:32Haines, Craig, and Weiss (2003) also do not limit the sample to only rural areas, as I have done.

26:765:68983:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:data availability of the antebellum period the inclusion of data on, (for example) agricultural production is
26:766:69092:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:not possible prior to 1840, and I err on the side of controlling for the features that these measures capture
26:767:69201:20:20:72:182:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:rather than not doing so.
26:768:69226:20:20:86:539:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:The inclusion of these controls in column (3) reduces the magnitude of the estimated coefficient on
26:769:69325:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:transportation linkage and renders the estimated coefficient statistically insignificant. While the magnitude
26:770:69434:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of the resultant coefficient is non-negligible, it is considerably smaller than the estimates of columns (1) and
26:771:69546:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:(2). This indicates that the relationship in columns (1) and (2) may be the product of omitted variables
26:772:69650:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:bias. The addition in column (4) of interactions of birth year and region fixed effects, or of the interaction
26:773:69760:20:20:72:439:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of state and birth year fixed effects in column (5) has little impact on the estimates.

26:777:70154:20:20:72:539:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:measure of linkage with the logarithm of market access as the explanatory variable of interestTjt. Columns
26:778:70260:20:19:72:540:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:(6) and (7) estimate equation (1) without the additional county-level controls, without and with the inclusion
26:779:70370:19:20:72:540:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of state fixed effects, respectively. As was the case with the binary measure of transportation linkage, a large,
26:780:70483:20:20:72:540:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:negative, and statistically significant coefficient is present on the measure of transportation linkage, and is
26:781:70594:20:20:72:540:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:nearly halved (but is otherwise robust) when state fixed effects are included. In particular, the estimates of
26:782:70704:20:20:72:540:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:column (7), which include the state fixed effects, indicate that a one-standard deviation increase in market
26:783:70812:20:20:72:540:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:access (0.30 log points, as shown in Table 2) is associated with a reduction in average height of 0.17 inches.
26:784:70922:20:20:86:539:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Columns (8)–(10) repeat this estimation, including the various county-level control variables, and the
26:785:71024:20:20:72:540:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:region-by-birth year or state-by-birth year indicators. Unlike their analogs in columns (3)–(5), the addition
26:786:71133:20:20:72:540:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of these controls to regressions of height on market access does not eliminate the statistical significance of
26:787:71243:20:20:72:540:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the negative relationship between market access and height. Moreover, the impact of the inclusion of the
26:788:71347:20:20:72:540:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:controls on the magnitude of the coefficient is smaller than it was for the transport indicator. In particular,
26:789:71458:20:20:72:540:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the estimates of column (10), which includes the state-by-birth year indicators, imply that a one-standard
26:790:71564:20:20:72:540:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:deviation increase in market access is associated with a decline in average stature of 0.11 inches, or about
26:791:71672:20:20:72:430:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:1.6 times the implied impact of a transportation linkage in its analog, column (5).
26:792:71755:20:19:86:539:171:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:On the whole, these estimates suggest that there is a negative correlation between transportation linkage
26:793:71860:19:20:72:540:152:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and health as implied by average stature, and that the elimination of this relationship in columns (3)–(5) of
26:794:71969:20:0:72:513:132:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Table 3 is the product of deficiencies of the transport indicator rather than of omitted variables bias.

27:796:72101:27:20:72:540:683:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Like the conclusions of existing work on health in the antebellum United States, the estimates of Table 3
27:797:72206:20:20:72:540:663:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:do not address concerns of endogeneity such as those discussed in section 3 above. Indeed, these are merely
27:798:72313:20:20:72:540:643:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:correlations, and may be driven by transportation construction in areas that were unhealthy for reasons
27:799:72416:20:20:72:540:623:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:unrelated to transportation. The structure of my data, in particular the ability to describe the evolution
27:800:72522:20:19:72:540:603:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of the transportation network over time, enables the estimation of equation (2) to partially address these
27:801:72628:19:20:72:540:584:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:concerns.33Results of this estimation are presented in columns (1)–(5) of Table 4. I begin in column (1)
27:802:72732:20:20:72:540:564:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:by estimating specification (2) with the transport linkage indicator as the regressor of interest. Given the
27:803:72840:20:20:72:540:544:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:binary regressor, this coefficient can be interpreted as a generalized difference-in-differences coefficient. The
27:804:72953:20:20:72:540:524:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:estimated coefficient is -0.037, which is smaller than the estimates including controls in Table 3, and is
27:805:73059:20:20:72:540:504:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:statistically insignificant. Given the limitations of the transport linkage indicator, as discussed above, the
27:806:73169:20:21:72:469:484:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:absence of a meaningful transport-health relationship using this regressor is not surprising.

27:824:74075:20:20:72:540:227:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:interest. Unlike specification (1), this estimation approach relates within-county changes in market access to
27:825:74185:20:20:72:540:207:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:within-county changes in average stature, making no cross-county comparisons. This column reveals that the
27:826:74291:20:20:72:540:187:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:negative and statistically significant relationship between market access and height is robust to the inclusion
27:827:74402:20:20:72:540:167:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of the fixed effects, and thus to the concerns that they address over endogeneity. Moreover, at -0.519, the
27:828:74509:20:13:72:387:147:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:magnitude of the coefficient is comparable to the estimates of Table 3.34
27:829:74582:13:13:82:539:134:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:33The county-fixed effects approach has the added benefit of not requiring the inclusion of potentially endogenous controls
27:830:74705:13:9:72:540:121:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:such as the 1840 and 1850 controls above. Instead, the county-specific characteristics that these are meant to capture will be
27:831:74831:9:8:72:179:112:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:captured by the fixed effects.
27:832:74861:8:0:82:539:104:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:34The specification of column (2) is the one estimated by nonlinear least squares. The estimates areˆβ=−0.519(s.e.= 0.201)

28:835:75203:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:that may be time variant. Columns (4) and (5) supplement the county fixed effects with region- and state-
28:836:75308:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:by-birth year indicators, respectively. While the inclusion of these indicators reduces the magnitude of the
28:837:75416:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:estimated coefficients, and in the case of column (5) it is reduced to the point of statistical insignificance
28:838:75526:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:(p=  0.138), the rough magnitude and sign of the coefficient is retained, supporting the conclusion that

28:864:77384:20:20:72:540:182:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:for being on one of the lines presented in Figure 1.  This regression includes state fixed effects and the
28:865:77490:20:32:72:540:162:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:same functions of distance from New York and Cincinnati as included above. The resulting coefficient is
28:866:77593:32:10:72:539:130:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:andˆθ=−3.822(s.e.= 0.476). The estimatedD-statistic is 1.410 (s.e.= 0.727). The standard error forˆβis larger than the
28:867:77711:10:9:72:89:120:8:g_d0_f6:6:g_d0_f5:one in Table 4 because of the additional uncertainty coming from the need to jointly estimateθ.35
28:868:77808:9:10:89:539:111:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:The measures of agricultural suitability are not from 1820, but are innate, and so can be considered representative of the

29:871:77951:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:statistically insignificant and small, indicating that it is not possible to reject the null hypothesis that counties
29:872:78068:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:on the lines were ex ante different from others. The regression in column (2) of corn suitability shows similar
29:873:78179:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:results. In both of these cases, even if the coefficients were of larger magnitude and statistically significant,
29:874:78292:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the bias induced by the positive coefficients would tend to mute the negative relationships of the transport-
29:875:78401:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:health relationship that I have found.  Construction targeting more potentially agriculturally productive
29:876:78506:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:areas would tend to be associated with greater average height if agricultural suitability supported better
29:877:78612:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:health. The regression in column (3) of the logarithm of population density on the same regressor (limiting
29:878:78719:20:20:72:493:570:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:the sample to counties that had achieved their 1860 boundaries by 1820) shows similar results.36
29:879:78815:20:20:86:539:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Columns (4)–(6) repeat the same estimation with the value of the instrument in 1850 (approximately the
29:880:78917:20:20:72:539:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:end of the study period) as the regressor. This is the value of the instrument generated by the “construction”
29:881:79027:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of the hypothetical links. In these regressions I also control for the level of the instrument in 1820 in order to
29:882:79141:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:isolate the effects on the instrument of the addition of lines. These regressions yield similar results. Finally,
29:883:79254:20:20:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:in columns (7)–(9), I regress the same outcomes on the year in which the lines of instrumentation reach a
29:884:79359:20:19:72:540:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:particular county, restricting to counties through which a line passes. Little relationship if any is found.
29:885:79467:19:20:72:540:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Thus, these results support the identification assumptions that counties on and off of the lines are ex ante
29:886:79575:20:20:72:471:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:similar, and that counties closer and farther from the origins of the line are ex ante similar.
29:887:79670:20:20:86:539:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Table 6 presents the coefficient from the estimation of equation (1) by instrumental variables with state-
29:888:79776:20:20:72:540:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:specific indicators and no other controls; it is analogous to column (7) of Table 3. The first feature of note in
29:889:79889:20:20:72:540:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:this column is that the first-stage estimation—that is, the estimation of specification (1) with the logarithm
29:890:79999:20:20:72:540:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of market access as the dependent variable and the logarithm of the instrumental variables-implied market
29:891:80104:20:20:72:540:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:access as the regressor of interest—shows a positive and strongly statistically significant relationship between
29:892:80216:20:20:72:540:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the instrument and the potentially endogenous regressor of interest, indicating that the instrument satisfies
29:893:80325:20:20:72:540:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the relevance condition. This satisfaction of the relevance criterion remains robust throughout the various
29:894:80432:20:20:72:191:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:specifications in this Table.

29:896:80563:20:20:72:540:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:in column (1) is negative and statistically significant.37Its magnitude is comparable to the ordinary least
29:897:80670:20:20:72:540:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:squares estimate of Table 3 and to the fixed effects estimates of columns (2)–(5) of Table 4. Column (2) of
29:898:80777:20:19:72:540:171:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Table 6 adds the county-specific controls discussed above. Unlike the ordinary least squares regressions of
29:899:80884:19:19:72:540:152:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Table 3, the introduction of these controls increases rather than decreases the magnitude of the coefficient,
29:900:80993:19:10:82:512:133:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:36This sample limitation is made in order to avoid changes in population density coming from changing boundaries.
29:901:81106:10:12:82:539:123:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:37The results of Table 6 include individuals born in counties that have no urban population in 1820 but that are origin points

30:926:82593:20:20:72:540:415:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:controls. The negative and statistically significant coefficient is robust to these controls (though the statistical
30:927:82709:20:20:72:528:395:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:significance is marginal, withpvalues of 0.075 and 0.066, respectively), as is its approximate magnitude.
30:928:82814:20:19:86:539:375:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:That the instrumental variables estimate is more negative than the analogous ordinary least squares
30:929:82913:19:20:72:540:356:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:estimate suggests that, in fact, the direction of the bias addressed by the instrumental variables approach
30:930:83020:20:20:72:540:336:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:is the opposite of the bias hypothesized in section 3 above. This pattern is consistent with transportation
30:931:83127:20:20:72:540:316:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:being constructed towards areas with agricultural potential, which would have improved health, all else
30:932:83230:20:20:72:540:296:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:equal. However, this conclusion must be taken carefully given the presence of local average treatment effects
30:933:83339:20:20:72:256:276:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and the possibility of measurement errors.
30:934:83381:20:20:86:539:256:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Finally, column (5) combines the two empirical approaches by estimating equation (2) by instrumental
30:935:83481:20:20:72:540:236:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:variables. The first stage estimate is strong, indicating that prior first-stage estimates are robust to the
30:936:83589:20:20:72:540:216:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:inclusion of county fixed effects. The second-stage coefficient of interest remains negative, and the magnitude
30:937:83700:20:20:72:539:196:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:is comparable to estimates of Tables 4 and 6.38However, the standard error of this coefficient is more than
30:938:83807:20:20:71:539:176:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:doubled by the demands of this estimation (relative to the non-instrumental variables analog), making it
30:939:83911:20:20:71:296:156:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:impossible to reject the null hypothesis of no effect.
30:940:83965:20:22:86:539:136:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Overall, based on the results of Tables 4 and 6, I conclude that the data provide strong and robust
30:941:84064:22:13:82:539:114:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:38The difference between the estimates with and without instrumental variables, though small, tends to support transporta-

31:944:84327:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:estimates are consistent with previous descriptions of correlations in the antebellum United States, though
31:945:84434:20:38:72:369:670:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:unlike those estimates, these can plausibly be interpreted causally.40

31:947:84526:26:20:72:540:606:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Table 7 presents a variety of robustness checks of the main results presented above. Columns (1)–(3) verify
31:948:84633:20:20:72:540:586:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the robustness of the results of the county-fixed effects regressions of column (2) of Table 4. Column (1) adds
31:949:84744:20:20:72:540:566:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the transport indicator into this regression, which already includes market access. This approach, developed
31:950:84852:20:20:72:540:546:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:by Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016), has the benefit of identifying the impacts of market access while holding
31:951:84959:20:20:72:540:526:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:constant a county’s transportation linkage. Identification is then based on construction elsewhere in the
31:952:85064:20:19:72:540:506:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:transportation network. Concerns that transportation construction targeted areas that were more or less
31:953:85167:19:20:72:540:487:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:healthy are thus reduced.41Column (1) reveals that the negative and statistically significant coefficient
31:954:85272:20:20:72:540:467:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:on market access is robust to this alternate source of identification. Column (2) generalizes this approach
31:955:85379:20:20:72:540:447:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:by controlling separately for railroad, canal, and river linkages, with similar results. Finally, column (3)
31:956:85487:20:20:72:540:427:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:includes year-specific quadratic functions in latitude and longitude. Although the coefficient is less precisely
31:957:85599:20:23:72:414:407:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:estimated (p= 0.159), it retains its negative sign and approximate magnitude.

31:972:86593:20:21:72:540:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of Table 6.  Column (4) controls for the level of market access in a county in 1820, in order to more
31:973:86694:21:12:82:539:170:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:39In Table A.1, I use the single year of data on death rates (1850) to study the relationship between transportation linkage
31:974:86818:12:9:72:540:158:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:as measured by market access and health as measured by death rates. In general, the results of this Table are supportive of the
31:975:86945:9:7:72:387:149:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:conclusion that there was a negative relationship between transportation and health.
31:976:87029:7:12:82:539:142:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:40One potential concern is that migration out of the county of birth in response to transportation linkage might be responsible
31:977:87156:12:10:72:540:130:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:for the reduction in stature, rather than any effect within the county of birth. This concern is addressed in Table A.2, where I
31:978:87284:10:9:72:89:120:8:g_d0_f6:6:g_d0_f5:show that migration patterns in response to market access are of the opposite sign to be consistent with this concern.41
31:979:87404:9:10:89:539:111:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:The concerns are not totally alleviated, however, as construction might take place away from a county in order to increase
31:980:87526:10:0:72:331:101:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:its market access. The Erie Canal is an example of such construction.
32:981:87597:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:effectively isolate changes over time in market access, rather than its level, which may be endogenous even
32:982:87704:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:after instrumentation because the instrument is based on the (potentially endogenous) 1820 network. The
32:983:87807:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:negative and statistically significant coefficient of market access is robust to this control, and its magnitude
32:984:87919:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:is increased. Finally, column (5) includes year-specific quadratics in latitude and longitude, and the result
32:985:88028:20:37:72:139:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:is again robust.
32:986:88044:37:27:72:296:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:5.5  The Local Development Channel
32:987:88078:27:20:72:540:566:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Understanding the channel through which transportation operates on health is important for at least two
32:988:88181:20:20:72:540:546:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:reasons. First, understanding the mechanism of the effect would help to understand whether these results
32:989:88285:20:20:72:540:526:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:apply in other settings, such as in modern developing countries. Second, a negative effect of market access
32:990:88392:20:19:72:540:506:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:on stature is consistent with both explanations for the Antebellum Puzzle, as discussed in section 2 above.
32:991:88499:19:20:72:540:487:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Investigation of the channel through which the effect operates can help to better understand this phenomenon
32:992:88607:20:20:72:344:467:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and potentially to distinguish between these two explanations.
32:993:88669:20:20:86:539:447:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Given the limited data availability for this period, it is not possible to evaluate all of the mechanisms
32:994:88774:20:20:72:540:427:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:described in section 2. Instead, I focus on determining whether there is empirical support for the disease
32:995:88880:20:20:72:540:407:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:explanation. I concentrate specifically on the part of this explanation that claims that transportation im-
32:996:88987:20:20:72:540:387:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:provements generated a worse epidemiological environment by creating growth in newly linked areas, which
32:997:89091:20:20:72:345:367:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:generated worse sanitation conditions and thus worse health.42
32:998:89153:20:20:86:539:347:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:I begin by testing whether the arrival of transportation infrastructure generated local development in the
32:999:89259:20:36:72:358:327:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:form of greater population density by estimating the specification

32:1001:89356:37:20:72:540:254:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:for census years 1820–1850, wheredjtis population density and MAjtis market access.  I estimate this
32:1002:89456:20:20:72:540:234:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:equation by ordinary least squares and by instrumental variables, presenting the results in column (1) of
32:1003:89561:20:20:72:540:214:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Table 8. Following Atack et al. (2010), I limit the sample to county-years in which counties had already
32:1004:89665:20:20:72:540:194:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:achieved their 1860 boundaries so that results are not driven by, for instance, changes in population density
32:1005:89774:20:20:72:540:174:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:caused by changes in county boundaries. Although the magnitude of the estimated relationship between
32:1006:89874:20:20:72:540:154:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:market access and population density is impacted by whether or not an instrumental variables method is
32:1007:89976:20:30:72:540:134:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:used, the general qualitative result is not.  In particular, column (1) of Table 8 shows a large, positive,
32:1008:90083:30:33:82:396:104:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:42Unfortunately, a paucity of data prevent an effective test of the other mechanisms.

33:1010:90170:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and statistically significant impact of market access on population density. The estimated coefficients imply
33:1011:90279:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:that a one-standard deviation increase in market access (0.407 in the data set with counties as the unit of
33:1012:90386:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:observation, as shown in Table 1) is associated with a 0.181 log point increase in population density according
33:1013:90497:20:23:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:to the fixed effects estimates, or a 0.431 log point increase according to the instrumental variables estimates.

33:1044:92134:20:20:72:540:289:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:density varies by a county’s potential agricultural productivity. I interact market access with the log of a
33:1045:92242:20:20:72:540:269:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:measure of a county’s average suitability for wheat or corn production. The results of this estimation reveal
33:1046:92351:20:20:72:540:249:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:that the effects of market access on increasing population density were stronger in counties with greater
33:1047:92456:20:20:72:540:229:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:agricultural suitability. I demean the measures of suitability so that, for example, the fixed effects estimates
33:1048:92568:20:20:72:540:209:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of column (2) can be interpreted as implying that a county with average wheat suitability experienced an
33:1049:92672:20:20:72:540:189:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:increase in population density of 0.470 percent in response to a one percent increase in market access, and
33:1050:92779:20:20:72:540:169:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:that a county with wheat suitability one percent above the mean had a 0.649 percentage point stronger
33:1051:92880:20:19:72:540:149:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:reaction. Similar results are evident for corn suitability, and comparable results (though with less precision
33:1052:92990:19:20:72:540:130:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and larger coefficients) are found when using instrumental variables. Thus, counties with greater agricultural
33:1053:93100:20:0:72:540:110:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:suitability tended to experience greater increases in population density in response to the same improvements
34:1054:93211:0:20:72:539:710:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:in transport linkages, likely reflecting immigration from other areas of individuals seeking to establish farms.43
34:1055:93325:20:20:86:539:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Given the difference in the unit of observation available for the analysis of population density on the one
34:1056:93432:20:20:71:539:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:hand (one observation per county-decade) and transportation and height on the other (annual county-level
34:1057:93536:20:20:71:539:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:observations), it is not possible to directly relate changing population density to changing stature. Instead,
34:1058:93646:20:20:71:539:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:to determine whether there was a relationship between growth in population density and declines in average
34:1059:93752:20:20:71:539:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:stature, I investigate whether the responsiveness of height to changes in market access also differed by crop
34:1060:93861:20:20:71:539:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:suitability. To this end, I repeat the interaction approach in estimating equation (2) in columns (4) and
34:1061:93966:20:20:71:539:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:(5), with height as the dependent variable. When estimating by ordinary least squares (with county fixed
34:1062:94070:20:20:71:539:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:effects) in Panel A, I find that the negative relationship of market access with stature is stronger in the
34:1063:94177:20:20:71:539:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:more agriculturally suitable counties, though the interaction coefficients are only marginally statistically
34:1064:94285:20:20:71:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:significant (p=  0.076for wheat suitability andp=  0.137for corn suitability).  The magnitudes of the
34:1065:94386:20:20:71:539:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:estimated interaction coefficients are large.  When these estimates are repeated with the combination of
34:1066:94490:20:20:71:539:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:instrumental variables and county fixed effects, as in column (5) of Table 6, results of the same sign are
34:1067:94596:20:19:71:490:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:found, but as with column (5) of Table 6, the coefficients are smaller and imprecisely estimated.
34:1068:94693:19:20:86:539:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Together, these results indicate that, in the counties where agricultural productivity caused population
34:1069:94797:20:20:71:539:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:density to grow more in response to rises in market access, the effects of market access on reducing height
34:1070:94904:20:20:71:539:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:were stronger.  This is consistent with the contention that the effect of transportation on market access
34:1071:95009:20:45:71:528:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:passed through the channel of increasing local development that worsened the local disease environment.

34:1079:95777:20:19:71:539:176:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:in height over time to change in local circumstances (by virtue of the county fixed effects estimation). In
34:1080:95884:19:20:71:539:157:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:this section, I use the results presented in section 5 above to determine how much of the deterioration in
34:1081:95990:20:23:71:501:137:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:average stature can be attributed to the growing transportation network of the antebellum period.
34:1082:96087:23:13:82:539:114:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:43This view is further supported by the results of Table A.3, which shows an increase in the acreage devoted to farming in
34:1083:96209:13:0:72:193:101:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:response to rising market access.
35:1084:96244:0:20:86:539:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:The empirical pattern to be explained is a 0.82 inch decline in average stature that is present in the
35:1085:96346:20:20:72:539:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:benchmark sample.44To determine the fraction of this decline that is attributable to rising market access,
35:1086:96452:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:I determine the estimated impact of the rise in market access over the study period on health as implied
35:1087:96556:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:by the estimates above. Table 1 shows that the logarithm of market access increased by 0.645 from 1820 to
35:1088:96661:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:1850. Thus, the largest coefficient in Tables 4 and 6, -0.832, can explain a decline in stature of 0.54 inches,
35:1089:96772:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:or about 65 percent of the total decline of 0.82 inches. As a lower bound, the coefficient of -0.323 can explain
35:1090:96884:20:20:72:398:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:a decline in stature of 0.21 inches, or about 26 percent of the total decline.
35:1091:96962:20:20:86:539:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:The finding that transportation was responsible for a large fraction of the decline in stature of the ante-
35:1092:97069:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:bellum period is important in documenting a definitive cause for the decline in health, which has heretofore
35:1093:97177:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:eluded researchers. It is not, however, helpful on its own in choosing between the disease and the food price
35:1094:97286:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:explanations. Discriminating between these explanations is important to understanding the potential im-
35:1095:97389:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:pacts of economic growth beyond that induced by transportation expansions, and in determining whether,
35:1096:97491:20:20:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:as Komlos (1987) has argued, that the decline in stature is not indicative of a negative impact of indus-
35:1097:97596:20:19:72:540:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:trialization because it was the product of utility-maximizing choice. In demonstrating that the increased
35:1098:97701:19:20:72:540:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:concentration generated by transportation was in part responsible for the negative impact of transportation,
35:1099:97809:20:45:72:443:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:this paper also contributes by providing evidence supporting the disease explanation.
35:1100:97894:45:30:72:171:366:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:7  Conclusion
35:1101:97907:30:20:72:540:336:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:The beneficial effects of transportation improvements for economic development are well known (Donaldson
35:1102:98011:20:20:72:540:316:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:2015). Less is known, however, about the impact of transportation on health, where the theoretical impact
35:1103:98116:20:20:72:540:296:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:is ambiguous and only a small number of empirical investigations exist to study this impact in specific
35:1104:98219:20:20:72:540:276:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:settings (Burgess and Donaldson 2012; Tang 2017). In this paper, I study the impacts on health of the
35:1105:98320:20:20:72:540:256:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:internal improvements made in the antebellum United States, focusing specifically on the impacts on the
35:1106:98423:20:19:72:540:236:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:average stature of the birth cohorts of 1820–1847. Besides being important for its own sake, this setting
35:1107:98528:19:20:72:540:217:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:enables the study of the impact of the construction of large infrastructure projects in previously unlinked
35:1108:98635:20:20:72:540:197:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and undeveloped areas with long-term outcomes. It also provides valuable insights for the possible cause
35:1109:98739:20:20:72:540:177:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:or causes of one of the fundamental and least understood stylized facts in American economic history—the
35:1110:98843:20:15:72:540:157:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:decline in health during early modern growth known as the Antebellum Puzzle. Existing evidence (Haines,
35:1111:98946:15:12:82:539:142:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:44This is calculated by regressing heights on birth year and measurement age indicators and then using a local polynomial
35:1112:99067:12:10:72:540:130:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:regression to smooth the estimated coefficients on the birth year indicators. Reassuringly, this decline is comparable to other
35:1113:99194:10:9:72:540:120:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:estimates of the decline in the period, many of which are based on the same or similar data (A’Hearn 1998; Floud et al.
35:1114:99313:9:10:72:540:111:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:2011; Fogel 1986; Steckel 1995). This includes Zimran’s (2018) calculation of a 0.94 inch decline that adjusts for potential
35:1115:99437:10:0:72:483:101:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:representativeness issues in the sample, but which is not limited to counties with no urban population in 1820.
36:1116:99550:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Craig, and Weiss 2003) reveals a negative correlation between transport and health in this period, but does
36:1117:99657:20:20:72:352:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:not address the possibility that the correlation may be spurious.
36:1118:99722:20:20:86:539:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:I study this relationship using data on stature from the records of enlistments in the Union Army (Records
36:1119:99828:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of the Adjutant General’s Office 1861–1865) combined with GIS data on the development of the antebellum
36:1120:99931:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:transportation network (Atack 2015, 2016, 2017).  Using a within-county fixed effects approach and an
36:1121:100032:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:instrumental variables approach based on straight lines connecting major watersheds to one another and to
36:1122:100137:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:major cities, I find evidence of a negative effect of market access on average stature. The estimated effect
36:1123:100245:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:is large enough to explain up to 65 percent of the decline in average stature behind the Antebellum Puzzle.
36:1124:100352:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Moreover, I find evidence consistent with the effect operating through a channel in which transportation leads
36:1125:100462:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:to increased population density, which in turn led to worse health in a period of poor sanitation technology.
36:1126:100571:20:20:86:539:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:These results provide an interesting and important warning.  The Antebellum Puzzle cautions that
36:1127:100667:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:economic growth may not be unambiguously welfare-improving. The results of this paper show that infras-
36:1128:100770:20:20:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:tructure improvements with well known economic benefits may also have had an unintended negative impact
36:1129:100873:20:32:72:493:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:on at least some aspect of welfare and therefore were also not unambiguously welfare-improving.

46:1384:117815:22:12:72:540:688:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:In this appendix, I determine whether there are impacts of market access or transportation linkage in years
46:1385:117922:12:12:72:540:676:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:other than the birth year on terminal height. This relaxes the restriction in the main text that the impact
46:1386:118029:12:12:72:529:664:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of transportation linkage on health comes from the state of the transportation network in the birth year.
46:1387:118134:12:12:86:539:652:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:One strategy is to simply repeat the analysis of the main text, but to include the measures of transporta-
46:1388:118240:12:12:72:540:640:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:tion linkage in years other than the year of birth in the regressions. However, the resultant loss of power
46:1389:118347:12:12:72:540:628:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:from this approach would be too severe to yield any meaningful results. I therefore use the more restrictive

46:1396:118843:12:12:72:540:512:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:respectively, with the substitution of the four explanatory variables of interest for the one. The four divisions
46:1397:118956:12:12:72:539:500:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:in equations (B.4) and (B.5) are intended to denote the period before conception, thein uteroand infancy
46:1398:119060:12:12:72:282:488:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:period, childhood, and adolescence, respectively.
46:1399:119109:12:12:86:539:476:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Results of estimation of equations (B.4) and (B.5) are presented in Figure B.1.  The results of four
46:1400:119209:12:12:72:540:464:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:specifications are presented—with and without county fixed effects and with and without region-specific
46:1401:119312:12:12:72:540:452:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:birth year fixed effects. The results of all four specifications are similar. In all four cases, estimates ofβ1,β3,
46:1402:119427:12:12:72:540:440:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:andβ4—that is, of the coefficients on market access in years other than infancy and thein uteroperiod—
46:1403:119529:12:12:72:540:428:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:are statistically insignificant and in most cases effectively zero.46Onlyβ2—the coefficient on the average
46:1404:119635:12:12:72:540:416:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of market access for ages -1–3—is consistently of one sign and nearly statistically significant. This result
46:1405:119743:12:11:72:540:404:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:suggests that the previous analyses’ focus on market access in the year of birth did not overlook important
46:1406:119850:11:12:72:102:393:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:effects.
46:1407:119858:12:12:86:539:381:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:The absence of an effect of market access on height outside of the years surrounding the birth year need
46:1408:119962:12:12:72:540:369:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:not indicate that this is the only point in the life cycle in which there is an effect, as I interpret it above.
46:1409:120074:12:12:72:540:357:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Instead, it could be the case that migration in later life could generate measurement error for the later-in-life
46:1410:120187:12:12:72:189:345:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:measures of market access.
46:1411:120213:12:12:86:539:333:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:An alternative approach is to relate terminal stature to the number of years to which an individual was
46:1412:120316:12:22:72:432:321:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:linked to the transportation network. Table B.1 presents estimates of the equation

46:1415:120521:12:12:72:540:265:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:as above.  Exposure time is computed as follows: for those who are born into a county that is already
46:1416:120622:12:12:72:540:253:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:transportation-linked, the exposure time is set to 23 years; for individuals for whom transportation arrives

46:1418:120829:12:12:72:540:229:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:fixed effects in columns (5)–(7). In no case is a statistically significant relationship between stature and
46:1419:120937:12:75:72:347:217:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:exposure time present, and in all cases the estimates are small.
46:1420:121001:75:12:82:539:142:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:45I compute market access for years 1810–1860. This implies that for the later cohorts, ̄X[12,18]jtmay be the average of a
46:1421:121123:12:10:71:539:130:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:shorter span of ages. For instance, for the 1847 cohort, it is only the average for ages 12 and 13. The lower frequency of rail
46:1422:121250:10:9:71:89:120:8:g_d0_f6:6:g_d0_f5:information in the 1850s also reduces its accuracy.46
46:1423:121303:9:10:89:540:111:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:The fixed effects estimates ofβ4are positive, but they are not statistically significant and are inconsistent with the OLS

48:1460:123487:22:12:72:540:688:10:g_d0_f30:10:g_d0_f3:Procedure C.1.The procedure for computation of transportation costs in a particular yeartis as follows.
48:1461:123590:12:20:71:365:676:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:This approach is based on that of Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016).
48:1462:123654:20:12:84:540:656:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:1. A map of US counties with 1860 boundaries and of all transportation infrastructure present in year
48:1463:123755:12:12:96:540:644:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f3:twere loaded. The transportation infrastructure includes Donaldson and Hornbeck’s (2016) maps of
48:1464:123851:12:12:96:539:632:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:seas, lakes, and the intercoastal waterway linking the Atlantic and Pacific, revised to accurately reflect
48:1465:123957:12:20:96:443:620:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the state of linkages between the various Great Lakes in the antebellum period.
48:1466:124036:20:12:84:540:600:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:2. For each mode, linkages are made between county centroids and the several nearest forms of trans-
48:1467:124136:12:12:96:539:588:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:portation of each mode. In addition, direct linkages between county centroids within 300 kilometers
48:1468:124235:12:12:96:539:576:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:are made. For linkages of county centroids to modes in another county, distance is taken as geographic
48:1469:124337:12:12:96:539:564:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:distance. For linkages between a county centroid and modes within the county, linkages are given the
48:1470:124437:12:12:96:539:552:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:distance of an average of the distances of 200 randomly selected points within the county to that mode,
48:1471:124540:12:20:96:263:540:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:as in Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016).
48:1472:124576:20:20:84:386:520:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:3. Transshipment links are created between modes of transportation.
48:1473:124643:20:12:84:540:500:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:4. Transportation rates are assigned using Taylor’s (1951) rates, as reported in Atack and Passell (1994).
48:1474:124749:12:11:96:539:488:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:These are as reported in Table C.1. Transshipment is assigned a cost of 50 cents per ton per trans-

48:1476:124857:20:12:84:539:457:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:5. An origin-destination cost matrix calculation is performed, computing transport costscijtbetween

48:1494:125297:11:7:195:418:233:5:g_d0_f20:5:g_d0_f6:Notes:Rates per ton mile are taken from Taylor (1951), as reported by
48:1495:125366:7:8:193:418:226:5:g_d0_f6:5:g_d0_f6:Atack and Passell (1994). Transshipment is assigned a cost of 50 cents per
48:1496:125440:8:85:193:261:218:5:g_d0_f6:5:g_d0_f6:ton per transshipment.
48:1497:125462:85:13:82:539:133:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:47Given that the trans-shipment cost and the value of goods are taken from Fogel (1964), they may not “match” with the
48:1498:125580:13:9:72:540:120:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:freight rates taken from Taylor (1951), as the former are for the postbellum period and the latter are for the antebellum period.
48:1499:125709:9:10:72:540:111:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:However, given that transportation linkage is the single strongest factor affecting market access, the impacts of changing these
