2:36:2278:28:14:72:540:588:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:In this paper we present  a comprehensive  comparison  of IPO placement methods in over 50  countries.  
2:37:2382:14:14:72:540:574:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:We find that out of the three primary methods, fixed price public offers,  auctions,  and book building, 
2:38:2487:14:14:72:540:560:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:auctions  are  least popular with  issuers.  Since auctions  allow for price  discovery  while avoiding the 
2:39:2595:14:14:71:539:546:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:potential conflict of interest between issuer and underwriter, this is a surprising finding that is   not adequately 
2:40:2711:14:14:72:539:532:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:explained in the existing literature.  We propose  a new explanation: namely, that participating in auctions 
2:41:2820:14:14:72:538:518:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:is  substantially more difficult for investors  compared to the  other methods,  and that this  complexity  
2:42:2928:14:14:72:538:504:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:can lead to investor behavior that is undesirable for the  issuer.  We  suggest that this  effect  could be

3:80:4751:21:12:79:530:399:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Bringing an initial public offering (IPO) to market requires a process that would determine who would be the
3:81:4859:12:12:64:530:387:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:initial investors1,  how many shares each of them would obtain,  and what price they would pay.   The possibilities
3:82:4974:12:12:64:440:375:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:include book building, fixed price public offers, and auctions, as well as their various hybrids2.
3:83:5072:12:12:79:530:363:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:In the United States, the primary method is book building, which gives the underwriter substantial discretion over
3:84:5186:12:12:64:530:351:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:allocations.  However, when agents are given discretion, there is always the potential for abuse, and the numerous
3:85:5300:12:12:64:424:339:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:scandals following the internet bubble suggest that such abuses have occurred in practice3.
3:86:5391:12:12:79:530:327:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:In comparison, sealed bid auctions are relatively more transparent, giving little discretion to the auction admin-
3:87:5505:12:12:64:530:315:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:istrator, and are consequently less subject to manipulation and abuse.  Moreover, the auction method is old and well
3:88:5621:12:12:64:530:303:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:established, and has been particularly successful for US Treasury securities and other government debt instruments.
3:89:5736:12:30:64:530:291:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Not surprisingly, it is often suggested that auctions are a superior method of IPO placement4. Nevertheless, to this day

4:108:7984:12:12:79:530:696:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:In order to explain this phenomenon, a number of explanations have been proposed in the the academic literature.
4:109:8096:12:12:64:530:684:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:For example, Sherman and Titman(2002) andSherman(2005) argue that the greater control and flexibility of the book

4:111:8326:11:12:64:530:661:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:issuers who are interested in choosing a particular level of underpricing to induce the desired amount of information

4:114:8687:12:12:64:530:625:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:considerations would be less important in cases when rewarding price discovery is particularly costly.   Thus,  the
4:115:8802:12:12:64:530:613:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:low  popularity  of  auctions  in  the  US  is  somewhat  of  a  puzzle.   Unfortunately,  the  rarity  of  the  US  IPO  auctions
4:116:8932:12:12:64:530:601:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:makes this puzzle difficult to investigate. In addition, it is unclear if the US situation is a result of some unique local
4:117:9055:12:12:64:246:589:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:circumstances, or is prevalent across markets.
4:118:9101:12:12:79:530:577:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:In this paper we provide a comparative review of international IPO practices, and the factors that influence the
4:119:9213:12:12:64:527:565:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:choice of the IPO mechanism from the three most common types of IPOs. In Section2 we offer evidence on overall
4:120:9323:12:12:64:530:553:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:usage patterns – first listing the many countries that have tried and abandoned the auction method, and then examining
4:121:9441:12:12:64:530:541:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:IPO auction outcomes in more detail. We find that, when standard auctions have had to compete with another method
4:122:9554:12:12:64:530:529:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:– either with fixed price public offers or with book building – auctions have lost out.  Of the 50 countries that we
4:123:9670:12:12:64:530:517:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:examine, more than half have used the auction method at some point, yet IPO auctions are still in use only in the US,
4:124:9787:12:12:64:530:505:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:where usage has been sporadic and relatively rare, and in Vietnam, India and Israel, where there are (or until recently
4:125:9906:12:12:64:300:493:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:have been) restrictions preventing the use of book building.
4:126:9966:12:12:79:527:481:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:In Section3 we argue that issuers’ preferences for price discovery are not sufficient to explain this apparent lack
4:127:10081:12:12:64:530:469:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:of popularity of auctions. We also present empirical evidence suggesting that it is not explained either by the lack of
4:128:10200:12:12:64:531:457:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:familiarity among investors, or by differences in underwriting fees.  For example, auctions have initially been quite
4:129:10317:12:12:64:531:445:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:popular in many countries, and the fees for fixed price public offers in most of them have been the same as those for
4:130:10434:12:12:64:530:433:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:auctions, leaving investment banks with no incentive to favor one method over the other based on fees. In spite of that,
4:131:10554:12:12:64:530:421:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:when issuers have been allowed to choose between fixed price public offers and auctions, the former method generally
4:132:10670:12:11:64:530:409:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:prevailed. The fixed price public offer method in turn lost market share when it faced competition from book building.
4:133:10788:11:12:64:530:398:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Our findings refute the view that, but for the investment banks’ market power, standard auctions would have replaced
4:134:10904:12:12:64:347:386:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:the book building method for bringing new equity issues to the market.
4:135:10974:12:12:79:530:374:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Our explanation for the popularity of the book building method relies on the observation that each underwriter
4:136:11084:12:12:64:530:362:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:of an IPO has a network ofregularinvestors.  Because of the long-term enduring nature of the underwriter-regular
4:137:11196:12:12:64:531:350:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:investor relationship6, the underwriter is able to provide the necessary incentives to all investors participating in the
4:138:11317:12:12:64:530:338:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:book building process to truthfully reveal their views regarding what they think the issue is worth to them and how
4:139:11432:12:12:64:531:326:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:many shares they are willing to buy at various possible offering prices. Therefore book building can be thought of as
4:140:11549:12:12:64:530:314:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:being closer to a “direct” mechanism7that requires little sophistication on the part of participants. In contrast, bidding
4:141:11671:12:12:64:530:302:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:in IPO auctions requires a high degree of sophistication on the part of all the participating investors.  In addition to
4:142:11791:12:12:64:530:290:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:valuing the shares being issued, each bidder must assess how many other bidders there will be, how much information
4:143:11906:12:12:64:530:278:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:they have, and what bidding strategies they will use, while at the same time accounting for the mistakes those other
4:144:12022:12:12:64:531:266:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:bidders may be potentially making – and all that makes bidding in an IPO auction a demanding task8.  Much of the
4:145:12134:12:12:64:530:254:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:theoretical literature ignores how investors actually make decisions.  In particular, they ignore the heterogeneity in
4:146:12252:12:12:64:530:242:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:investors’ levels of sophistication and ability to analyze IPO firms’ prospects, and hence their ability to participate
4:147:12371:12:12:64:530:230:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:in various mechanisms.  When this heterogeneity is taken into account, it becomes apparent that standard sealed bid
4:148:12486:12:30:64:524:218:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:uniform-price auctions can be risky for both investors as well as issuing firms. We discuss these issues in Section4.

4:151:12887:9:7:64:236:169:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:been tried in, for example, Japan, Israel, and Vietnam.

4:156:13270:10:12:75:530:123:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:8Nonequilibrium bidding, and its effects such as a persistent winner’s curse, has received high-profile attention in recent auctions research, e.g.
4:157:13417:12:0:64:249:111:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:Eyster and Rabin(2005) andCrawford and Iriberri(2007)
5:158:13471:0:12:79:530:720:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:In Section 5 we show how these issues played a role in the failure of some IPO auctions.  We provide additional
5:159:13582:12:12:64:530:708:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:anecdotal evidence for the lack of popularity of IPO auctions, and investigate in greater detail IPO auctions in Sin-

5:161:13811:12:12:64:530:684:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:have been successful. We believe that the evidence we present makes the lack of popularity of IPO auctions less of a
5:162:13927:12:29:64:200:672:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:puzzle. We conclude in Section 6.

5:164:14020:21:12:79:530:622:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:When Margaret Thatcher, Prime Minister of the UK, began privatizing British companies in the early 1980s, she
5:165:14129:12:12:64:530:610:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:set offmajor changes around the world in government, in industries and in IPO methods. Before then, the IPO method
5:166:14243:12:12:64:530:598:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:in most countries outside the US was fixed price public offer (a.k.a. open offer, universal offer or often simply called
5:167:14363:12:12:64:530:586:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:“the IPO method”). The trend towards floating extremely large public companies forced countries to try new methods
5:168:14477:12:12:64:530:574:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:and to coordinate IPOs across borders, since many privatizations were too big to be absorbed entirely by the local
5:169:14591:12:12:64:530:562:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:market.  The wave of privatizations led to experimentation first with auctions and then with the US book building
5:170:14704:12:12:64:96:550:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:method.
5:171:14711:12:12:79:530:538:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Before  we  proceed  with  our  investigation  of  international  IPO  experience,  we  will  first  describe  the  existing
5:172:14835:12:24:64:207:526:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:methods and their defining features.
5:173:14871:24:15:64:380:502:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:2.1.  IPO Mechanisms: Fixed Price Public Offers, Book Building, and Auctions
5:174:14947:15:11:79:530:487:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Infixed price public offers, the price and allocation rules are set before information on demand is received, and
5:175:15060:11:12:64:530:476:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:shares are allocated according to the rules announced earlier.  This method may offer some flexibility in allocating
5:176:15176:12:12:64:530:464:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:shares across groups (for example, favoring small orders over large orders, as is done in many countries), but we do
5:177:15292:12:12:64:530:452:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:not classify offerings as being fixed price public offers unless the underwriters and issuers have little or no discretion
5:178:15414:12:12:64:179:440:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:in terms of share allocations.
5:179:15444:12:12:79:530:428:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Withbook building, the underwriter typically arranges for investors to attend a road show and then collects indica-
5:180:15559:12:12:64:531:416:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:tions of interest, which are used to build the order book. The offer price is set only after the order book is full, giving
5:181:15682:12:12:64:530:404:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:the underwriter some idea of demand, and the issue size may also be adjusted based on demand.  In the definitions
5:182:15795:12:12:64:530:392:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:we used to categorize offers, the key distinguishing feature of book building is that the underwriter has substantial
5:183:15912:12:12:64:219:380:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:discretion over allocations and pricing.
5:184:15952:12:12:79:531:368:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:Auctionsfor IPOs have taken several forms.  Uniform price auctions are multi-unit sealed bid auctions in which
5:185:16062:12:12:64:530:356:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:all winning bidders pay the same price. The price paid may be the market-clearing price (the highest price that allows
5:186:16180:12:12:64:530:344:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:all shares to be sold), or it may be below the clearing price, leading to increased rationing. A ”dirty” IPO auction was
5:187:16300:12:12:64:530:332:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:traditionally defined as a uniform price auction where they ”leave something on the table” by pricing below market-
5:188:16415:12:12:64:530:320:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:clearing, and this is how we use the term in this paper, although some people now use the term a dirty auction to also
5:189:16533:12:12:64:530:308:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:incorporate practices such as giving some bidders information about the bids of others during the bidding period, as
5:190:16649:12:12:64:530:296:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:has been done in some U.S. IPO auctions9.  In a discriminatory or pay-what-you-bid auction, each winning bidder
5:191:16760:12:12:64:530:284:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:pays his or her own bid.  While some auctions restrict entry, historically most IPO auctions have been of an open
5:192:16873:12:12:64:530:272:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:public nature.  The auction price is based on investor bids, but unlike book building, auction allocations are usually
5:193:16991:12:12:64:530:260:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:determined by rules that are set, and publicly announced, prior to bidding, thus eliminating underwriter discretion
5:194:17106:12:12:64:171:248:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:with respect to allocations.
5:195:17134:12:12:79:530:236:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:With either fixed price public offers or sealed bid auctions, underwriters may, and sometimes do, hold road shows
5:196:17247:12:11:64:530:224:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:before the offer price is set. As in book building, they are allowed to ask for feedback that may influence the offering
5:197:17367:11:12:64:530:213:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:price in the case of the fixed price public offer or the reservation price in the case of auctions.  However, without
5:198:17484:12:12:64:530:201:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:control over allocations, underwriters may not be able to offer enough of an incentive for investors to produce and
5:199:17599:12:12:64:137:189:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:share information.
5:200:17617:12:12:79:530:177:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Many countries have used hybrids – combinations of any two of the three methods.   There have been hybrid
5:201:17722:12:12:64:531:165:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:auction/public offer and auction/book building IPOs, but the most common combination is book building/public offer.
5:202:17837:12:30:64:530:153:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:For most hybrids, book building (or sometimes an auction) is used to set the price and to allocate shares to institutional
5:203:17959:30:12:75:531:123:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:9Biais  and  Faugeron-Crouzet(2002)  show  that  pricing  below  market-clearing  can  encourage  the  revelation  of  endowed  information  from
5:204:18104:12:0:64:89:111:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:bidders.
6:205:18113:0:12:64:531:720:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:and foreign investors, while a fixed price public offer tranche is reserved for local retail investors that do not participate
6:206:18239:12:12:64:530:708:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:in the price-setting process. There are two types of hybrids: simultaneous and sequential. With sequential hybrids, the
6:207:18358:12:12:64:530:696:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:price-setting tranche is completed first, so that the price from that tranche can be used for the subsequent fixed price
6:208:18478:12:12:64:531:684:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:public offer. Simultaneous hybrids are often called ’open pricing’, since investors have to place orders while the offer
6:209:18598:12:11:64:530:672:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:price is still ’open’ (before the final price is set). This allows both tranches to run at the same time, thus allowing the
6:210:18721:11:12:64:217:661:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:offer price to be set as late as possible.
6:211:18763:12:12:79:531:649:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:As  mentioned  earlier,  we  will  refer  to  commonly  used  uniform-price  and  discriminatory  auctions  asindirect
6:212:18881:12:12:64:530:637:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:mechanisms, where every participant will have to factor in what other participants know and how they will bid before
6:213:18997:12:12:64:530:625:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:submitting  their  own  bids.   In  contrast,  indirectmechanisms  the  incentives  are  such  that  all  bidders  report  their
6:214:19125:12:12:64:530:613:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:valuations truthfully to the auctioneer (underwriter).  Book building may come closer to a direct mechanism, with
6:215:19238:12:12:64:530:601:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:bidders privately communicating their valuations to the underwriter, and the underwriter setting prices and allocations
6:216:19357:12:12:64:315:589:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:in a way that provides them with sufficient incentives to report.
6:217:19422:12:12:79:530:577:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:It  is  well  known  that  for  a  large  set  of  mechanisms,  the  Revelation  Principle  (Myerson,1981)  states  that  for
6:218:19547:12:12:64:530:565:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:any indirect mechanism, there exists a direct one that generates identical outcomes in model economies.  However,
6:219:19660:12:12:64:530:553:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:outcomes of theoretically equivalent direct and indirect mechanisms often differ in laboratory experiments10. Whether
6:220:19777:12:12:64:530:541:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:this is an important enough issue in the case of IPOs can only be discerned based on the historical experience of
6:221:19890:12:23:64:373:529:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:countries that have experimented with several different mechanisms for IPOs.
6:222:19966:23:13:64:218:506:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:2.2.  International Historical Evidence
6:223:20005:13:12:79:530:493:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:We conduct an extensive study of IPO placement practices in 50 countries.  Unfortunately there is no standard
6:224:20114:12:12:64:531:481:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:reliable source of international data on IPO placement methods11. Table1 summarizes the IPO methods used in each
6:225:20226:12:12:64:530:469:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:country, with more detailed information given in TableC.1.  As one can see in these tables, most countries allow the
6:226:20342:12:12:64:530:457:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:use of many methods.  We do not know of any country that had formerly allowed auctions and then changed their
6:227:20451:12:12:64:530:445:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:regulations to prohibit or limit them, or of any country that has forced issuers to use book building – the general trend
6:228:20572:12:12:64:346:433:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:in the last two decades has been to allow greater choice among issuers.
6:229:20643:12:12:79:530:421:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:There are two notable patterns. First, the book building method was once rare outside the US but is now common.
6:230:20754:12:12:64:373:409:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Second, auctions have been tried in more than 25 countries but are rare today.
6:231:20832:12:12:79:531:397:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Table1 shows that the traditional method (in other words, the first and for many years the only method) in most
6:232:20943:12:12:64:530:385:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:countries is fixed price public offer. It also shows that nearly all countries except the United States are still using fixed
6:233:21068:12:12:64:530:373:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:price public offer in some form, either alone or as part of a book building hybrid. As a rough generalization, Table1
6:234:21185:12:12:64:530:361:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:shows that experimentation with auctions began in the 1980s or earlier in Europe, and in the 1990s or later in Asia and
6:235:21304:12:12:64:530:349:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:the Americas, but the auction method generally was dropped within a few years. Experimentation with book building
6:236:21417:12:12:64:530:337:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:exploded in the mid-1990s, and the method seems to have ’stuck’ in most countries, again as a hybrid with fixed price
6:237:21534:12:12:64:530:325:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:public offer.  Auctions usually were abandoned before book building was introduced, so that there have only been a
6:238:21648:12:12:64:336:313:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:few countries in which both methods were in use at the same time12.
6:239:21715:12:12:79:530:301:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Although auctions have been used in more than half of the 50 countries listed in Table1, the method seems to have
6:240:21828:12:12:64:530:289:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:been entirely abandoned in all but three or four of them, and usage is rare even in those few remaining countries. As
6:241:21945:12:12:64:530:277:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:can be seen in TableC.1, auctions are used sporadically in the US, at a rate of less than 2 per year (22 from 1999 to
6:242:22062:12:11:64:530:265:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:2012). They are the only method allowed in Vietnam, and a restricted type of auction is used in India, which prohibits
6:243:22180:11:12:64:530:254:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:book building.  They have been frequently used in the past in Israel, where auctions were the only allowed method
6:244:22293:12:12:64:530:242:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:for a decade. Book building has been allowed in Israel since mid-2007, but the market has not been active since that
6:245:22409:12:12:64:433:230:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:regulatory change, so it is too early to tell how the choice of issue methods will evolve there.
6:246:22505:12:12:79:530:218:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:In India,  book building was first allowed in the 1990s but was not popular for many years.   Eventually,  after
6:247:22617:12:25:64:530:206:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:regulatory changes, book building became more popular there, but in 2005 the Indian regulator13began mandating

6:250:22906:13:9:64:530:158:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:unfortunately these are missing for a large part of the dataset, and worse, are rather unreliable in terms of describing the actual process: e.g. auctions
6:251:23060:9:9:64:530:149:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:in Taiwan, Singapore and France are inconsistently classified as either fixed price or book building; on the other hand, many book built issues in
6:252:23206:9:7:64:204:140:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:US and UK are classified as fixed price, etc.

8:317:26240:12:12:64:530:708:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:price band for the issue, and investors have to submit bids with prices falling within that price band. Interestingly, in
8:318:26361:12:12:64:530:696:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:76% of the 309 Indian IPOs during the period January 2000 to December 2010 that used the book building method,
8:319:26471:12:12:64:531:684:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:the offer prices were set at the maximum of the price range. In 13% of the IPOs the offer prices were at the floor, and
8:320:26590:12:11:64:530:672:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:the rest had the offer prices at the mid point. Indian IPOs therefore resemble a modified version of a fixed price public
8:321:26711:11:12:64:302:661:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:offer rather than book building or a uniform price auction14.
8:322:26772:12:12:79:530:649:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Auctions are being used in Vietnam, but issuers there are allowed no choice of methods. Vietnam is still developing
8:323:26887:12:12:64:419:637:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:its markets in its transition away from central planning, and most IPOs are privatizations.
8:324:26978:12:12:79:530:625:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:In France, auctions were popular in the first half of the 1990s.  On the regulated exchanges, they gradually lost
8:325:27091:12:12:64:530:613:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:market share to sequential hybrid book building over several years, then dried up quickly in 1999 when simultaneous
8:326:27206:12:12:64:530:601:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:hybrid book building was allowed.  Auctions continued to be used on the unregulated over-the-counter market (the

8:328:27430:12:12:64:530:577:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:There were, however, two IPO auctions in France in early 200515, which came after there had been no auctions on
8:329:27541:12:12:64:247:565:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:regulated French exchanges for half a decade.
8:330:27586:12:12:79:530:553:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Auctions were the only method allowed in Israel for a decade.  The law requiring their use expired in December,
8:331:27697:12:12:64:530:541:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:2003, after which issuers were allowed to effectively choose a fixed price public offer by setting a maximum price
8:332:27811:12:12:64:530:529:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:for the auction. Many of the IPOs between 2004 and mid-2007 chose to set a relatively low maximum price for their
8:333:27924:12:12:64:530:517:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:offerings, thus effectively choosing fixed price over auction16.  In July 2007, a long-debated change went into effect,
8:334:28043:12:12:64:530:505:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:allowing book building for the first time.  It is too soon at this point to tell how auctions will compete with book
8:335:28159:12:12:64:182:493:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:building in the Israeli market.
8:336:28190:12:12:79:530:481:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Auctions were the only method allowed in Japan from 1989 through 1997.  Discriminatory (pay-what-you-bid)
8:337:28295:12:12:64:530:469:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:hybrids were required, with the fixed price public offer tranche paying the weighted average winning bid price from
8:338:28410:12:12:64:530:457:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:the auction.  Due to perceived problems with auction overpricing, the rules were changed in 1992 to require more of
8:339:28525:12:12:64:530:445:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:the shares to be auctioned (at least 50%) and to allow the fixed price public offer tranche to be priced strictly below
8:340:28644:12:12:64:530:433:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:the weighted average winning bid price from the auction. Maximum order size in the public offer tranche was limited,
8:341:28760:12:12:64:530:421:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:inducing institutional investors to participate primarily through the auction, and in some cases minimum bid sizes
8:342:28874:12:11:64:530:409:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:were used in the auctions to try to discourage small bidders from participating. When issuers were allowed to choose
8:343:28990:11:12:64:443:398:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:between auctions and book building beginning in 1997, auctions vanished within one quarter17.
8:344:29083:12:12:79:530:386:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Since 1995, Taiwan has allowed both auctions and book building, in addition to the traditional fixed price public
8:345:29196:12:12:64:530:374:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:offers. Taiwan’s auctions are similar to those that were originally required in Japan – discriminatory hybrids. Auctions
8:346:29316:12:12:64:530:362:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:were initially popular but lost market share over time, with more and more issuers returning to pure fixed price public
8:347:29435:12:12:64:530:350:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:offers. Book building was originally allowed only in certain restrictive circumstances but has gained popularity in the
8:348:29554:12:12:64:121:338:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:last few years.
8:349:29569:12:12:79:530:326:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:In Latin America, auctions have been used in Argentina, Brazil and Peru in the past.  Latin American markets
8:350:29677:12:12:64:530:314:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:were quiet for many years, with delistings outnumbering listings in Brazil, Argentina and Chile18.  Thus it was hard
8:351:29793:12:12:64:530:302:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:to predict if auctions were gone completely.  However, Brazilian, Chilean and later Argentinean IPO markets began
8:352:29906:12:12:64:530:290:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:picking up in 2004-2005, with even stronger activity in 2006, and book building has been the dominant method, with
8:353:30020:12:12:64:260:278:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:no auctions that we know of over the last decade.
8:354:30069:12:12:79:530:266:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:In the US, the investment bank WR Hambrecht has been encouraging issuers to use auctions since mid-1999.
8:355:30173:12:26:64:530:254:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:The method got much publicity when Google, a popular search engine company, chose to use the auction method

8:357:30319:10:12:72:530:218:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:15The two 2005 auctions were for Cafom, on the Second Marche in January and for MG International, on Alternext in June. There have been no
8:358:30457:12:7:64:197:206:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:further auctions in France as of late 2012.
8:359:30500:7:12:72:530:199:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:16The law for one decade had forbidden the use of a maximum price. Technically, Israel was using auctions even before this, but it had become
8:360:30641:12:10:64:530:187:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:standard to set the maximum price so low that it was virtually sure to be hit, thus effectively making the method a fixed price method.  In 2007,
8:361:30786:10:9:64:530:177:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:Itamar Medical, Maayan Ventures, Clal Finance and Brainsway all set maximum prices for their IPOs, and all ended up being priced at those
8:362:30923:9:7:64:406:168:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:maximums, but we have not yet been able to verify what proportion of all TASE IPOs set maximum prices.
8:363:31025:7:12:72:530:161:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:17Japan’s IPO auctions included many large privatizations.  The largest IPO auction that we know of was for Japan Tobacco, with proceeds
8:364:31161:12:10:64:530:149:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:(converted to US$ but not adjusted for inflation) of $5.8billion,  while the second-largest that we know of,  the 1994 IPO auction of Singapore
8:365:31304:10:9:64:530:139:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:Telecom, raised only $2.7 billion.  Japan Tobacco originally expected to raise $9.8billion, but the auction tranche price was perceived to be so
8:366:31448:9:10:64:530:130:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:excessive that individuals withdrew their previously-placed orders for the fixed price public offer tranche, so that only 42% of the retail tranche
8:367:31595:10:9:64:78:120:8:g_d0_f4:6:g_d0_f4:shares were sold.18
8:368:31614:9:0:78:410:111:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:For example, Chile had no IPOs at all from 1998 to 2001 and only one each in the years 2002 and 2003.
9:369:31716:0:12:64:530:720:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:for its August, 2004 IPO, but still the auction method is not popular in the US. As of 2012, there have been 22 US
9:370:31830:12:12:64:530:708:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:IPO auctions, 19 of them lead-underwritten by WR Hambrecht through its OpenIPO method. Of the other 3 US IPO
9:371:31938:12:12:64:530:696:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:auctions, the lead underwriters were: Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley for Google in 2004; Credit Suisse for Netsuite
9:372:32055:12:12:64:530:684:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:in 2007; and Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch for Rackspace in 2008.  US auctions have had some
9:373:32164:12:11:64:339:672:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:unusual features (see the “United States” column of Table C.1, p.41).
9:374:32233:11:12:79:530:661:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Several types of IPO auctions have been used. Brazil, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and the
9:375:32346:12:12:64:530:649:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:UK have used discriminatory auctions, while Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Finland, France, India, Israel, Malaysia,
9:376:32461:12:12:64:530:637:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Portugal, Singapore, Turkey, the UK, the US and Vietnam have used
9:377:32570:12:12:64:530:625:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:uniform price auctions. ”Dirty Dutch” (priced below market clearing) auctions have been used in Australia, Belgium,
9:378:32685:12:12:64:454:613:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Finland, France, Hungary, India, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, Turkey, the UK, and the US.
9:379:32779:12:12:79:530:601:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Thus out of 50 countries, auctions have been tried in at least half, and yet all except India, Israel, the US and
9:380:32892:12:12:64:530:589:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Vietnam seem to have abandoned them entirely.   Auctions are rare even in these last few countries,  although the
9:381:33005:12:12:64:530:577:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:choice  of  non-auction  methods  is  restricted  in  two  of  the  four  (India  and  Vietnam).   Book  building  is  gaining  in
9:382:33135:12:12:64:530:565:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:popularity or is already the dominant method in more than 40 of the countries. Fixed price public offer is still used in
9:383:33255:12:12:64:492:553:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:smaller countries and for smaller offerings, and is used for the retail tranche of hybrids, which are standard.
9:384:33366:12:12:79:530:541:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:The popularity of fixed price public offers in less active markets is to be expected if, as we conjecture, the reason
9:385:33483:12:12:64:530:529:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:for book building’s dominance is that it is a “direct” mechanism. As we shall see below, implementing a mechanism
9:386:33596:12:12:64:530:517:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:such as book building requires an established, trusted and sophisticated underwriter, communicating with investors
9:387:33710:12:12:64:530:505:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:who have sufficient capacity to collect and process information.  Lacking these conditions, the potential benefits of
9:388:33827:12:12:64:531:493:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:book building disappear and simple fixed price public offers become more attractive due to their simplicity: they rely
9:389:33945:12:12:64:530:481:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:much less on the reputation of the underwriter compared to book building, and require much less sophistication on the
9:390:34062:12:12:64:530:469:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:part of investors compared to auctions. Hybrids can be fine-tuned to specific requirements and are therefore observed
9:391:34179:12:30:64:172:457:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:in a wide range of markets.
9:392:34206:30:21:64:274:427:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:3. Rarity of IPO Auctions: Popular Explanations
9:393:34253:21:11:79:530:406:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:In what follows we discuss several commonly offered explanations for the lack of popularity of IPO auctions, and
9:394:34365:11:24:64:342:395:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:argue that they are not fully consistent with observed global evidence.
9:395:34436:24:15:64:249:371:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:3.1.  Heterogeneity in issuing firms’ objectives
9:396:34484:15:12:79:530:356:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:One of the explanations advanced in the literature for the popularity of the book building method is the flexibility
9:397:34600:12:12:64:531:344:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:it offers the issuing firm relative to auctions when it comes to the tradeoffbetween minimizing underpricing and
9:398:34712:12:12:64:530:332:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:promoting information gathering by investors.  Indeed,  there are several reasons to believe that issuers care about
9:399:34828:12:12:64:530:320:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:other aspects of the process beyond just the magnitude of underpricing as evidenced by initial returns.  For example,
9:400:34945:12:12:64:530:308:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:one reason to go public is to give current stockholders such as the founders, venture capitalists and angel investors a
9:401:35064:12:12:64:530:296:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:chance to diversify by liquidating at least part of their holdings. Such investors usually cannot sell until the end of the
9:402:35187:12:12:64:530:284:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:lock up period and thus care about the eventual stock price as well as the offer price and first day’s trading price.  If
9:403:35308:12:12:64:530:272:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:a deep, liquid market is not established, those investors may be unable to sell their shares at a reasonable price, even
9:404:35428:12:12:64:530:260:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:after the time and expense of an IPO. Companies that go public but do not attract an institutional investor following
9:405:35545:12:12:64:530:248:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:may end up as ”Orphans”, not covered by analysts or otherwise monitored closely enough to be accurately priced.
9:406:35656:12:12:64:530:236:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:This means that they will be unable to do follow-on equity offerings and will tend to trade at a substantial discount,
9:407:35774:12:12:64:530:224:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:due to their illiquidity and added risk.  In order to minimize this possibility, firms may be willing to pay, through
9:408:35891:12:12:64:531:212:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:underpricing, to attract the attention of serious investors in the IPO19. This may explain the importance of analyst
9:409:36007:12:30:64:531:200:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:coverage found inLoughran and Ritter(2004),Cliffand Denis(2004) andMola et al.(Forthcoming).  In the words
9:410:36113:30:12:72:530:170:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:19Underpricing as a way of inducing costly evaluation has been modeled inSherman(1992),Chemmanur(1993),Booth and Chua(1996),
9:411:36237:12:10:64:530:158:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:Sherman(2000),Sherman and Titman(2002) andBusaba and Chang(2003).Yung(2005) models costly evaluation by both investors and the
9:412:36363:10:9:64:530:148:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:underwriter.Cornelli and Goldreich(2001),Jenkinson and Jones(2004)) andCornelli and Goldreich(2003) offer evidence on whether or not
9:413:36495:9:10:64:530:139:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:book building performs this role in practice. SeeSherman and Titman(2002) for a list of additional reasons why issuers may prefer more accurate
9:414:36638:10:0:64:89:129:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:pricing.

10:416:36760:12:12:64:440:708:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:only do it once and you need it to be done very, very well. It is not a decision driven by price.”
10:417:36858:12:12:79:530:696:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:This brings up the question of what objective function issuers are maximizing when choosing an IPO method.
10:418:36964:12:12:64:530:684:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Loughran and Ritter (2004);Sherman and Titman(2002);Sherman(2005),Chemmanur and Liu(2003) andLiu and
10:419:37064:12:11:64:530:672:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Ritter(2011) offer alternative objective functions that consider more than just maximizing proceeds. The appropriate
10:420:37180:11:12:64:530:661:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:objective function for IPO issuers is a subject in itself, and one worthy of future research.  In this paper, we simply
10:421:37299:12:12:64:530:649:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:note that the evidence indicates that issuers care about more than just maximizing the expected proceeds from the
10:422:37412:12:12:64:83:637:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:IPO.
10:423:37416:12:12:79:530:625:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Sherman(2005) compares open uniform-price and discriminatory auctions to the results of a mechanism-design
10:424:37522:12:12:64:530:613:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:approach in which the underwriter invites investors to participate and has discretion over both pricing and allocations.
10:425:37642:12:12:64:530:601:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:This optimal mechanism is termed “book building”, because book building, from a regulatory standpoint, allows the
10:426:37755:12:12:64:210:589:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:issuer to chose price and allocations.
10:427:37793:12:12:79:530:577:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:She considers the possibility that an issuer’s utility may depend on both expected proceeds and pricing accuracy21,
10:428:37908:12:12:64:530:565:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:and shows that the ability to control allocations offers additional flexibility, allowing the underwriter to decide on the
10:429:38030:12:12:64:530:553:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:tradeoffbetween the two objectives. However, asSherman(2005) demonstrates, auction outcomes can sometimes be
10:430:38138:12:12:64:530:541:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:close to those of the optimal mechanism, as we can see from her example in which issuers who place a high value
10:431:38249:12:12:64:531:529:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:on pricing accuracy can do well with a discriminatory auction22.  The key disadvantage of the sealed bid auctions
10:432:38362:12:12:64:530:517:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:that Sherman models is largely due to the “open public” (i.e.  every investor has the option to participate) setting,
10:433:38479:12:12:64:530:505:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:rather than of the auction method itself.  A private (“by invitation only”) auction would not have this disadvantage.
10:434:38596:12:12:64:530:493:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Moreover, the comparison inSherman(2005) does not account for the lack of transparency and resulting potential
10:435:38706:12:12:64:530:481:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:for abuse that occurs with book building, because of the agency problem between the issuer and underwriter. One of
10:436:38820:12:12:64:530:469:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:the few papers that has modeled this agency problem isBiais et al.(2002), for the French regulatory regime.  Thus,
10:437:38934:12:12:64:530:457:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:at least under certain conditions, auctions may have an advantage over book building because of their transparency.
10:438:39049:12:12:64:530:445:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Hence, it would be difficult to explain the extent to which book building has come to be the dominant IPO mechanism
10:439:39164:12:23:64:452:433:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:in practice based only on the reasons that have been advanced in the theoretical finance literature.
10:440:39264:23:15:64:227:410:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:3.2.  Unwillingness to try a new method?
10:441:39304:15:12:79:530:395:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Another possible explanation for the low numbers of IPO auctions in the US is that the auction method is simply
10:442:39415:12:12:64:530:383:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:too new and experimental, and that issuers are afraid to try an unproven method.  This is plausible, since an IPO is a
10:443:39533:12:12:64:530:371:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:very expensive, very public step for a company, so issuers may not be anxious to experiment. However, this ‘lack of
10:444:39648:12:12:64:530:359:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:familiarity’ argument cannot explain the overall low market share of the auction method around the world. First, the
10:445:39764:12:12:64:530:347:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:mere fact that IPO auctions have been used in at least half the countries for which we have information implies that
10:446:39880:12:12:64:530:335:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:quite a few issuers have been willing to experiment. More importantly, if we look at relative usage patterns over time,
10:447:39999:12:12:64:530:323:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:issuers have been most enthusiastic about IPO auctions when the method was new, and they generally became less
10:448:40109:12:12:64:344:311:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:willing to use it after they had become more familiar with the method.
10:449:40179:12:12:79:530:299:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Figure1 shows the relative auction usage patterns over time in four countries. For Singapore, Taiwan and Turkey,
10:450:40291:12:12:64:531:287:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:the main alternative method was fixed price public offers, which had been the traditional method in those countries.
10:451:40407:12:12:64:530:275:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Auctions were first allowed in 1993 in Singapore23and Turkey, and in 1995 in Taiwan. In France, both auctions and
10:452:40520:12:12:64:530:263:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:fixed price public offers had been used for decades, but sequential hybrid book building was first introduced in the
10:453:40636:12:12:64:358:251:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:1990s, while standard book building was only allowed beginning in 1999.
10:454:40707:12:12:79:530:239:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:As can be seen from Figure1 for the three countries in which the open IPO auction method was newly introduced,
10:455:40817:12:12:64:530:227:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:auctions captured their greatest market share early on, with two-thirds or more of issuers choosing to use auctions
10:456:40932:12:12:64:530:215:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:when they were relatively new.  As issuers became more familiar with the method over time, a lower proportion of
10:457:41044:12:12:64:530:203:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:them chose to use the auction method.  Hence, it is hard to argue that, in these countries, the disappearance of IPO
10:458:41160:12:29:64:432:191:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:auctions was due to lack of familiarity or to an unwillingness of issuers to try a new method.
10:459:41254:29:13:72:530:162:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:20Alibris held an IPO auction through WR Hambrecht in May, 2004, but canceled it after observing the bids. See Mr. Manley’s blog, Jam Side

12:471:42389:0:12:79:531:720:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Of the four countries whose usage patterns are shown in Figure1, France differs from the others in several ways.
12:472:42501:12:12:64:530:708:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:First, the auction method had been allowed for several decades in France.  Second, a form of book building was in
12:473:42614:12:12:64:530:696:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:use during the period shown, in addition to auctions and fixed price.  Last, the disappearance of auctions from the
12:474:42729:12:12:64:447:684:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:regulated exchanges seems to have been driven by a regulatory shift that allowed greater choice.
12:475:42825:12:11:79:531:672:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Derrien and Womack(2003) found that sequential hybrid book building was less efficient than auctions in France
12:476:42935:11:12:64:530:661:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:due to the requirement that the price be set too far in advance.  Before 1999, the only form of hybrid book building
12:477:43051:12:12:64:530:649:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:that was allowed in France was a sequential hybrid, where the price must be set in advance to allow time for the public
12:478:43170:12:12:64:531:637:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:to place their orders. As the modeling inChowdhry and Sherman(1996a) demonstrates, setting prices too early adds
12:479:43282:12:12:64:530:625:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:risk, leading to higher levels of underpricing. Once the more modern, simultaneous hybrid book building method was
12:480:43396:12:12:64:530:613:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:allowed in France in 1999, auctions quickly vanished from the regulated exchanges24.  The 1999 regulatory change
12:481:43508:12:12:64:530:601:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:seems to explain the timing of auctions drying up on the French regulated exchanges, although it does not explain
12:482:43621:12:12:64:530:589:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:why they were still used for several more years on the unregulated over-the-counter Free Market (Marche Libr ́e).
12:483:43734:12:12:64:407:577:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Eventually, as shown in Figure 1 (Panel E), auctions also dried up on the Free Market.
12:484:43820:12:12:79:530:565:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:One  obvious  question  is  whether  issuers  in  these  countries  were  truly  allowed  to  choose  freely  between  IPO
12:485:43942:12:12:64:530:553:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:methods. Although there were no regulatory restrictions that prevented issuers from using auctions, strong differences
12:486:44060:12:12:64:530:541:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:between the groups of issuers using different methods might imply some other sort of barrier, such as underwriter
12:487:44173:12:12:64:530:529:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:reluctance to underwrite auctions for some issuers. Therefore, in unreported analysis, we compare fixed price public
12:488:44289:12:12:64:530:517:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:offers and auctions in Singapore, Turkey and on the French Free Market based on both industry and amount of funds
12:489:44402:12:12:64:515:505:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:raised25. We did not find substantial differences in the size or industry patterns of auction and non-auction issues.
12:490:44519:12:12:79:530:493:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Thus it is clear, in all four of the countries shown in Figure1, that the disappearance of auctions was not due to
12:491:44633:12:12:64:530:481:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:issuers’ lack of familiarity with the auction method. Similarly in Japan, issuers were forced to use auctions from 1989
12:492:44752:12:12:64:530:469:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:to 1997. In spite of the long period during which IPOs in Japan were accomplished exclusively through auctions, the
12:493:44867:12:12:64:445:457:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:method was abandoned as soon as issuers were given the option of instead using book building.
12:494:44960:12:12:79:530:445:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:There is not enough evidence to conclusively reject the ‘lack of familiarity’ argument for all countries.  It may
12:495:45073:12:12:64:530:433:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:explain why auctions have not caught on in countries with limited usage, such as Germany, Australia or the US, or
12:496:45186:12:12:64:530:421:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:in countries that have never tried auctions at all.  It may also explain why open public auctions for corporate debt
12:497:45302:12:11:64:530:409:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:and seasoned equity never caught on26, even though there was a race between three investment banks to introduce
12:498:45413:11:12:64:530:398:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:online  corporate  bond  auction  platforms  in  200027,  and  WR  Hambrecht  offers  an  online  seasoned  equity  auction
12:499:45536:12:12:64:531:386:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:method known as OpenFollowOn28. But the overall IPO evidence is that issuers in many countries have been willing
12:500:45648:12:12:64:530:374:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:to experiment with both auctions and book building, and that issuers became less likely to choose auctions as they
12:501:45762:12:24:64:205:362:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:gained familiarity with the method.

12:503:45858:15:12:79:531:323:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Another explanation for the failure of issuers to use IPO auctions is that investment banks have sufficient market
12:504:45972:12:12:64:530:311:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:power to negotiate the use of book building rather than auctions because the fees, and hence profits, are higher for
12:505:46088:12:12:64:530:299:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:book building.  This argument is somewhat incomplete.  While market power can explain the high fees, it can not by
12:506:46202:12:12:64:530:287:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:itself explain the choice of the issuing method:  if underwriters have sufficient market power to keep book building
12:507:46318:12:30:64:530:275:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:fees artificially high, and sufficient market power to influence the offering method chosen by the issuers, they would
12:508:46436:30:10:72:350:245:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:24With the exception of the two IPO auctions in 2005 that were mentioned in Section I.
12:509:46522:10:12:72:530:235:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:25Comparisons of French Second and Nouveau offerings can be found inDerrien and Womack(2003) andDegeorge, Derrien and Womack
12:510:46646:12:7:64:270:223:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:(2007).Hsu and Hung(2005) compare Taiwan IPOs by method.
12:511:46702:7:13:72:531:216:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:26Bortolotti et al.(2006) show that auctions, in the form of block trades, have increased dramatically in the last decade and have become quite
12:512:46845:13:9:64:530:203:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:common around the world for seasoned equity offerings.  The success of these SEO auctions fits well with our findings for IPOs, since the block
12:513:46988:9:9:64:530:194:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:trade auctions are single-unit auctions among a small group of sophisticated buyers – investment banks. The investment bank that wins the auction
12:514:47133:9:10:64:530:185:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:buys all of the shares at the winning bid price and then resells them on the market. With only one buyer, there is no room for free riders. Because
12:515:47280:10:9:64:530:175:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:the shares are relatively easy to value (since they are already trading) and the number of potential bidders is relatively small, these auctions are
12:516:47428:9:7:64:350:166:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:closer to Treasury bill auctions than to the types of auctions that have been used for IPOs.
12:517:47520:7:13:72:530:159:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:27On  August  10  2000,  Deutsche  Bank  and  Bear  Stearns  each  auctioned  offtheir  own  debt  on  their  newly-developed  platforms,  while  WR
12:518:47668:13:9:64:530:146:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:Hambrecht held its first OpenBook debt auction, for Dow, on August 15, 2000.  WR Hambrecht handled a second OpenBook auction, for Ford
12:519:47802:9:7:64:523:137:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:Motor Credit, in March, 2001. It reportedly also attempted an auction for Dayton Hudson, but the bid-taking system crashed during the auction.
12:520:47944:7:12:72:530:130:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:28Overstock, a company that also went public through an OpenIPO, used the OpenFollowon method in May of 2004 but chose a traditional
12:521:48076:12:0:64:255:118:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:marketed offering for its next follow-on in November, 2004.
13:522:48137:0:12:64:531:720:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:presumably also have sufficient market power to negotiate high fees for auctions29. In fact, auctions have usually been
13:523:48256:12:12:64:530:708:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:replaced by fixed price public offers, and public offer fees are typically as low as, or even lower than, the fees for
13:524:48374:12:12:64:508:696:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:auctions. Underwriters with market power would have preferred auctions if fees were the only consideration30..
13:525:48484:12:12:79:530:684:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Another  version  of  the  market  power  argument  takes  into  account  hidden  indirect  compensation  from  having
13:526:48602:12:11:64:530:672:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:discretion over allocations: Underwriters may have an incentive to pressure issuers to use methods that lead to higher
13:527:48720:11:12:64:530:661:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:initial returns, so that the underwriters can allocate the underpriced shares to their favored clients, possibly in exchange
13:528:48844:12:12:64:530:649:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:for soft dollar payments. However, that cannot explain the choice between auctions and fixed price public offers, since
13:529:48963:12:12:64:530:637:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:neither method allows the underwriter to control allocations, and as mentioned earlier auctions were associated with
13:530:49079:12:29:64:117:625:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:higher fees31.
13:531:49093:29:20:64:215:596:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:4. Why Do Issuers Avoid Auctions?
13:532:49126:20:12:79:530:576:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:In this section, we argue in favor of a different reason for the apparent lack of popularity of IPO auctions.  In
13:533:49239:12:12:64:530:564:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:particular, most auction models abstract away from the actual decision-making process of the agents, assuming instead
13:534:49356:12:12:64:530:552:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:that, whatever the process is, it is consistent with the game-theoretical equilibrium. However, this assumption is often
13:535:49476:12:12:64:530:540:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:in disagreement with evidence, as indicated by the existence of the winner’s curse in many experimental and real-
13:536:49589:12:12:64:530:528:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:world situations.  In order to reconcile this evidence with theory, a number of alternative equilibrium specifications
13:537:49707:12:12:64:530:516:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:have been proposed, such as level-kbidding (Crawford and Iriberri,2007), “cursed equilibrium” (Eyster and Rabin,
13:538:49819:12:12:64:531:504:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:2005),  or quantal response equilibrium (McKelvey and Palfrey,1995).   The common feature of these methods is
13:539:49928:12:12:64:530:492:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:that they allow agents to deviate from traditional expected utility maximization under Bayesian beliefs and allow for
13:540:50045:12:12:64:530:480:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:some form of bounded rationality. Allowing for such alternative behavior by agents may be relevant when modeling
13:541:50157:12:11:64:511:468:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:investors who participate in IPOs given the difficulties involved in valuing IPOs even for sophisticated investors.
13:542:50272:11:12:79:530:457:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Sherman(2005) models participation swings in sealed bid auctions, resulting in increased uncertainty over out-
13:543:50382:12:12:64:530:445:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:comes, in an equilibrium with rational, informed bidders32. As we discuss below, bounded rationality, when combined
13:544:50497:12:12:64:530:433:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:with fixed costs of participation and dynamic updating of beliefs, can amplify this uncertainty, which can deter ratio-
13:545:50616:12:12:64:530:421:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:nal sophisticated investors from participating, and lead to an increased probability of either low proceeds or even an
13:546:50734:12:12:64:231:409:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:outright placement failure for the issuer33.
13:547:50778:12:12:79:530:397:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:To make our discussion more specific, consider a “baseline” auction model based onMilgrom(1981) (fully de-
13:548:50884:12:12:64:531:385:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:scribed inAppendix  A). Notably, its equilibrium is characterized by fairly low discounts (compared to those often
13:549:50998:12:12:64:530:373:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:observed in real-life IPOs) even with a modest number of participants (Figure5), and in presence of risk aversion
13:550:51111:12:12:64:221:361:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:(Figure3) and noisy signals (Figure4).
13:551:51149:12:12:79:530:349:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:To see what may be going wrong with auctions in practice, it is important to note two somewhat related issues:
13:552:51259:12:12:64:530:337:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:(i) the prevalence of the winner’s curse in many real-life auctions, and (ii) the relationship between the number of
13:553:51375:12:12:64:479:325:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:participants and the discount, particularly in a setting when the number of participants can be stochastic.
13:554:51482:12:12:79:530:313:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:In what follows, we provide a brief review of the properties of uniform price auctions before illustrating the high
13:555:51597:12:26:64:438:301:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:level of sophistication that is required to avoid the “winner’s curse” while bidding in auctions.
13:556:51694:26:12:72:530:275:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:29A related argument is given byDegeorge et al.(2007), who show a correlation in France between greater publicity/analyst attention for IPOs
13:557:51834:12:9:64:531:263:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:and the use of book building rather than an auction (they do not analyze the fixed price public offers in their sample). They argue that underwriters
13:558:51983:9:10:64:530:254:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:induced issuers to use book building by convincing them of the value of other services (more analyst attention).  However, the question why such
13:559:52127:10:7:64:453:244:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:services would be bundled only with book building, rather than with all three methods in use at the time remains a puzzle.
13:560:52249:7:12:72:530:237:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:30Ljungqvist et al.(2003) show that average fees tend to be quite low for fixed price public offers across most countries, substantially below
13:561:52391:12:9:64:530:225:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:those for book building.Chahine(2001), examining French data from 1996 to 2000, found that the mean, median and standard deviation of gross
13:562:52530:9:10:64:530:216:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:spreads were slightly lower for fixed price than for auctions. In most countries, when auctions were first used, the fees were the same for auctions
13:563:52678:10:7:64:161:206:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:as for fixed price public offers.
13:564:52711:7:12:72:531:199:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:31Many countries allow orders in fixed price public offers to be favored on the basis of order size, but this usually involves favoring small over
13:565:52857:12:10:64:531:187:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:large orders.Chowdhry and Sherman(1996b) show that favoring small orders may reduce theRock(1986) winner’s curse.Parlour and Rajan
13:566:52987:10:9:64:78:177:8:g_d0_f4:6:g_d0_f4:(2005) also examine rationing in IPOs.32

13:568:53128:7:13:72:530:161:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:33Of course, sealed bid auctions are not the only IPO method that may experience participation swings.  However, as we discuss briefly at the
13:569:53269:13:9:64:530:148:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:end of this section, the other two methods are less vulnerable to such swings. For fixed price public offers, participation variations do not affect the
13:570:53421:9:9:64:530:139:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:offer price; while for book buidling, the underwriter observes the total number of orders before setting either the price or allocations, and thus can
13:571:53571:9:10:64:530:130:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:adjust for such variations.  InJagannathan et al.(2010) we show that an optimal truth-telling IPO auction mechanism would be characterized by
13:572:53712:10:9:64:530:120:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:many features that are commonly associated with book building, which simplifies the agents’ problem by transferring the “computational burden”
13:573:53854:9:0:64:459:111:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:to the underwriter, who has immediate interest in making sure that the process stays attractive for both issuers and investors.
14:574:53983:0:12:79:530:720:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Figure 2 shows equilibrium bidding functions (showing an equilibrium bid as a function of an investor’s signal),
14:575:54095:12:12:64:530:708:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:depending on the number of participants in an auction. Note that whenN=2K, so that the number of winners is equal
14:576:54208:12:12:64:530:696:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:to the number of losers, bids are very close to the signals, i.e., little correction for the winner’s curse is necessary.
14:577:54329:12:12:64:530:684:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:However, as the number of participants grows, so does the strength of the negative signal associated with winning
14:578:54442:12:11:64:530:672:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:the auction:  it now implies that the original bidders’ signal likely was in the right tail of the distribution and was
14:579:54561:11:12:64:530:661:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:overstating the underlying share value (“Winner’s Curse”).  Consequently,  bidders shave their bids.  On the other
14:580:54675:12:12:64:531:649:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:hand, whenN<2Kso that there are more winners than losers,losingthe auction is an indication of the signal biased
14:581:54787:12:12:64:372:637:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:downwards (“Loser’s Curse”), and bidders adjust their bids upwards instead.
14:582:54862:12:12:79:530:625:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Note that if bidders underestimate the number of bidders or under-react to an increase in the number of bidders,
14:583:54974:12:12:64:530:613:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:they would insufficiently shave their bids, resulting in overbidding. Below we argue that this type of an under-reaction
14:584:55094:12:12:64:530:601:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:is a likely explanation for the large fluctuations in participation, followed by abandonment of auctions by issuing firms
14:585:55215:12:21:64:144:589:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:in several countries.

14:587:55284:12:12:79:530:556:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:As we saw above, the required bid-shaving to avoid the winner’s curse depends on the number of other participants
14:588:55397:12:12:64:530:544:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:in the auction. When there is uncertainty about the number of other bidders, coming up with the correct bidding strat-
14:589:55515:12:12:64:531:532:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:egy can be difficult and even apparently sophisticated investors may find it difficult to avoid the winner’s curse34.  In
14:590:55636:12:12:64:530:520:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:what follows we illustrate the difficulties associated with bidding in an auction with an example somewhat resembling
14:591:55753:12:12:64:236:508:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:a popular TV game “Let’s Make a Deal”35:
14:592:55793:12:12:79:530:496:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Consider an auction similar to the one analyzed in the previous section, whereK=15 lots of shares are auctioned,
14:593:55905:12:12:64:530:484:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:and the number of participants,N, will be 20 or 150 with equal probability, and each bidder is allowed to bid only for
14:594:56023:12:12:64:530:472:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:one lot. For expositional convenience assume that all the bidders follow the strategy such that, conditional on winning
14:595:56142:12:12:64:530:460:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:and getting an allocation, the expected profit will be $0.50 when the number of biddersN=20, and $-1.00 when
14:596:56250:12:12:64:100:448:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:N=150.
14:597:56256:12:12:79:530:436:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:An apparently sophisticated investor may calculate the expected profits to bidding as follows:  The probability
14:598:56367:12:12:64:531:424:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:of winning is 15/20=0.75 whenN=20 and 15/150=0.10 whenN=150.  Therefore the expected profit to
14:599:56461:12:12:64:530:412:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:participating is $0.50×0.75=$0.375 when 20 bidders participate; and $−1.00×0.10=$−0.10 when 150 bidders
14:600:56564:12:12:64:530:400:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:participate.  SinceN=20 andN=150 are equally likely, it appears reasonable to calculate the expected profit to

14:627:56875:25:12:64:530:290:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:In other words, while each bidder expects an average profit of $0.1375 from participating in the auction, collectively

14:629:57110:12:12:64:530:266:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:above. The mistake is that the bidder did not correctly take into account the fact that whenever she herself participates,
14:630:57232:12:12:64:530:254:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:it is more likely that others are participating as well, or in other words when she participatesN=150 is more likely
14:631:57348:12:12:64:530:242:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:thanN=20.  The conditional probabilities of participating are not identical, as is implicitly assumed in the earlier

15:659:58238:25:10:66:530:672:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:Allocations and discounts in simulated uniform-price unit-demand auctions. Unless otherwise specified, the log of the value of a share and the log
15:660:58384:10:9:64:531:662:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:of each signal about the value of the share are jointly normally distributed withσV=σS=0.3 andEV=ES=10. There areNparticipants, each
15:661:58516:9:10:64:479:653:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:bidding for at most one lot of 100,000 shares, with the total ofK=15 lots offered. Except in Figure3, all bidders are risk-neutral.
15:662:58647:10:9:64:530:643:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:Even with zero information, transaction and opportunity costs, an open auction does not completely eliminate underpricing.  It occurs due to the
15:663:58791:9:10:64:530:634:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:finite number of participants, and becomes larger when bidders are risk-averse. The auction discount, depending on the number of participants and
15:664:58936:10:9:64:530:624:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:their degree of risk aversion, is shown in Figure3. Note that, in this example, even when the number of participants is relatively small, the auction
15:665:59085:9:10:64:531:615:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:discount is low when bidders are risk neutral (between 1% and 2% in the twice-subscribed case ofN=30).The discount can go up substantially
15:666:59223:10:9:64:251:605:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:when bidders are sufficiently risk averse and ill diversified.
15:667:59285:9:9:64:530:596:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:Aggregate uncertainty, which enters this model due to imperfect revelation of the true underlying value through a limited number of noisy signals,
15:668:59431:9:10:64:530:587:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:increases the expected discounts, as one can see from Figure4. For example, when the standard deviation of the signal doubles, the underpricing in
15:669:59577:10:9:64:530:577:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:the twice-oversubscribed auction also doubles.  As the number of participants grows, price discovery improves, and both mean expected discount
15:670:59719:9:19:64:196:568:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:and their variance are reduced (Figure5).

16:748:60792:14:12:79:530:670:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Now, consider an economy populated byM potential“naive” investors. Each periodt, each investorifaces a fixed
16:749:60900:12:12:64:531:658:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:cost of participating in an auctionci, and receives a private signalsiabout the true value. These investors are “naive”
16:750:61019:12:12:64:530:646:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:in the sense that if they choose to participate, they simply bid their valuation, or follow another bidding strategy, such
16:751:61141:12:12:64:530:634:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:as shaving their bids by a fixed amount, that does not change from auction to auction, and only depends on the private
16:752:61259:12:12:64:97:622:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:signal36.
16:753:61268:12:12:79:530:610:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:They decide whether to participate based on their expectation of return in the auction, minus the fixed cost. Their
16:754:61383:12:12:64:530:598:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:expectations of return to participation is adaptive, and is equal to a weighted average of the return on all past auctions
16:755:61505:12:12:64:443:586:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:that they know about, and their own return on the auctions they have personally participated in.
16:756:61601:12:12:79:530:574:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Now, individual participation and observed returns to investors in these auctions will vary. Due to the bias inherent
16:757:61718:12:12:64:530:562:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:in the “let’s make a deal” example, however, any investors who have not yet participated in an auction will overestimate
16:758:61838:12:12:64:530:550:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:their returns to participation, and after a short initial period of higher discounts and lower participation, there will be a
16:759:61963:12:12:64:530:538:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:period of negative returns and high oversubscription. This period will continue until either (i) sufficiently long “bad”
16:760:62083:12:12:64:530:526:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:history is established,  or (ii) sufficiently many investors learn not to participate based on their own experience,  at
16:761:62203:12:12:64:530:514:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:which time they will stay away, and only a similarly long history of positive returns could induce them to participate
16:762:62321:12:12:64:88:502:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:again.
16:763:62327:12:12:79:530:490:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:However, since the issuers are highly averse to a risk of auction failure, and since at this point auctions would
16:764:62440:12:12:64:530:478:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:(again) have low subscription and high discounts, they offer no advantages to issuers over either fixed price or book
16:765:62557:12:12:64:531:466:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:building offers, and thus issuers would prefer other methods, and such a positive history would never be established.
16:766:62674:12:12:64:247:454:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:This is observed in practice as auction failure.
16:767:62722:12:12:79:531:442:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:There is,  however,  a possible compensating effect:  the above reasoning relies upon assumption of “naive” in-
16:768:62833:12:12:64:530:430:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:vestors; perhaps more sophisticated investors could step in and provide the demand when naive investors decide to
16:769:62946:12:23:64:342:418:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:stay out? In what follows, we argue that it is unlikely to be the case37.
16:770:63019:23:15:64:210:395:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:4.3.  Structural Risk in IPO Auctions
16:771:63056:15:12:79:530:380:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:The folk wisdom is that wider participation IPO auctions must necessarily be in the interest of the issuer, due to
16:772:63170:12:12:64:530:368:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:better price discovery, increasing proceeds and decreasing risk.  However, in practice imprecise valuation is not the
16:773:63287:12:12:64:530:356:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:only source of aggregate risk in IPO auctions. Much of it comes from the features of the bidding environment itself,
16:774:63403:12:12:64:514:344:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:such as the variation in the number and strategies of other bidders. This variation has historically been very high.
16:775:63519:12:12:79:531:332:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:For example, when Japan auctioned offparts of its railway system, the 1993 auction of Japan Railway (JR) East
16:776:63628:12:12:64:530:320:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:drew 18,670 bidders,  while the 1996 auction of JR West drew only 3,395 bidders,  a decrease of more than 80%.
16:777:63738:12:12:64:530:308:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:335,000 JR West shares (20%) were left unsold. When Argentina auctioned offits first telecommunications company,
16:778:63850:12:12:64:530:296:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Telefonica, in December, 1991, it hoped for at least 80,000 bids from local investors but received more than 100,000.
16:779:63967:12:12:64:530:284:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:When it auctioned offits other telecommunications company, Telecom, just a few months later, the auction drew more

16:784:64471:12:12:64:531:224:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:also evidence of variation in the demand for Singapore auctions39. Subscription levels ranged from the Vickers Ballas
16:785:64588:12:12:64:530:212:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:auction, which was 1,300% oversubscribed (at the minimum bid), to Sunright, which was 82% undersubscribed. The
16:786:64698:12:30:64:530:200:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:number of bids ranged from 1,128 for Eng Wah to 162,492 for Singapore Telecom. In the same month that Singapore
16:787:64809:30:10:72:453:170:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:36Kagel et al.(1995) found that in an experimental setting “bidders fail to respond in the right direction to more rivals”.
16:788:64932:10:12:72:530:160:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:37Munger mentions in Poor Charlie’s Almanack (2006, page 18) that he avoids auctions since “The problem with closed bid auctions is that they
16:789:65073:12:7:64:522:148:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:are frequently won by people making a technical mistake, as in the case with Shell paying double for Belridge Oil.” See alsoDyer et al.(1989).
16:790:65215:7:10:72:389:141:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:38Multiple orders were allowed, so the number of orders might overestimate the number of bidders.

17:792:65341:0:12:64:530:720:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Telecom’s auction was heavily oversubscribed,the auction of another well-respected Asian telecommunications com-
17:793:65453:12:12:64:530:708:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:pany, Korea Telecom, was 90% undersubscribed (i.e.  received orders for only 10% of the available shares).  While
17:794:65566:12:12:64:523:696:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:some of these variations in participation levels would have been anticipated, there would have been some surprises.

17:815:66137:161:12:79:530:429:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Figure 6 gives the expected discount when the probability ofN1=150 varies from 0 to 1 for different values of risk
17:816:66251:12:12:64:530:417:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:aversion of bidders. The expected discount is small when there is no uncertainty about the number of bidders. However
17:817:66368:12:12:64:530:405:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:when the bidders face additional risk from underestimating the competition (i.e.,  there is a positive probability of
17:818:66485:12:12:64:530:393:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:N=150,) the expected discount increases. It is highest when the uncertainty about the number of bidders is high, and
17:819:66601:12:12:64:530:381:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:the risk aversion of the bidders is also high.  Restricting the number of participants to 20 bidders in this case would
17:820:66720:12:12:64:530:369:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:result in an outcome clearly superior for the issuer – even though it means abandoning openness, which is lauded as
17:821:66835:12:12:64:172:357:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:one of benefits of auctions.
17:822:66863:12:12:79:530:345:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:In addition to high discounts, randomness in participation greatly increases the variance of outcomes.  To fully
17:823:66975:12:12:64:530:333:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:appreciate the risk faced by investors, consider the case where the probability ofN=150 is 50%, and the coefficient
17:824:67090:12:12:64:530:321:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:of risk aversion A=2.  In this case, the return to a winning bidder is positive about half of the time, mostly when
17:825:67205:12:12:64:530:309:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:the number of bidders is below average. In the low-participation auctions, winners have an expected rate of return of
17:826:67322:12:12:64:530:297:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:66.6%, with 75% of such auctions returning at least 56.1% and 25% returning 76.1% to the winning bidders, while in
17:827:67436:12:12:64:530:285:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:the high-participation auctions the situation is very different: the winners take losses in 97.3% of the auctions, with an
17:828:67558:12:12:64:530:273:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:average return of -7.4%. In 75% of the high-participation auctions, winners lose more than 4.8%, with a 25% chance
17:829:67672:12:12:64:530:261:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:of losing 10.0% or more.  Thus, although the return is positive for winning bidders on average, there is substantial
17:830:67788:12:12:64:81:249:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:risk.
17:831:67793:12:12:79:530:237:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:It is necessary to note that there are ways of designing auctions in order to control this risk: for example, requiring
17:832:67912:12:11:64:530:225:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:bidders to indicate their intention to bid before starting an auction, with a subsequent revelation of the number of
17:833:68028:11:12:64:530:214:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:participants prior to bidding, would reduce both the risk the bidders would face and the return they would demand.
17:834:68142:12:12:64:531:202:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:However, such practices so far have not been used for auctions of IPOs40. Giving bidders guidance regarding the bid-
17:835:68258:12:12:64:530:190:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:ding trends of others also reduces bidder uncertainty, although at the expense of less transparency and more potential
17:836:68376:12:12:64:530:178:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:abuse by the underwriter/auctioneer. This essentially moves IPO auctions closer to book building as it has traditionally
17:837:68496:12:12:64:530:166:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:been practiced.  Other forms of auctions, including ascending price auctions, and auctions where the highest bidders
17:838:68612:12:30:64:385:154:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:do not necessarily get larger allocations, may also lead to more robust outcomes.
17:839:68693:30:13:72:530:124:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:40The Google, Netsuite, and Rackspace IPO auctions in the U.S. required bidders to acquire unique bidder IDs before the auction began, but the
17:840:68835:13:0:64:244:111:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:total number of unique IDs awarded was not announced.
18:841:68890:0:12:79:530:720:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Auctions are not the only IPO method for which there have been fluctuations in the number of participants, of
18:842:68999:12:12:64:531:708:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:course. However, the timing of sealed bid auctions and their method for determining the offer price make unanticipated
18:843:69117:12:12:64:530:696:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:variations in subscription levels more problematic than for the other two main IPO methods.  With fixed price public
18:844:69233:12:12:64:530:684:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:offers,  the subscription level affects a person’s chance of getting shares but not her return,  conditional on getting
18:845:69352:12:11:64:530:672:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:shares, since the subscription level does not affect the offer price.  With book building, the underwriter observes the
18:846:69471:11:12:64:490:661:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:subscription level as well as the ‘bids’ and can then set the price, taking the subscription level into account.
18:847:69583:12:12:79:530:649:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:In addition to uncertainty about the number of bidders, disruption can result when some bidders place noncom-
18:848:69692:12:12:64:530:637:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:petitive (i.e. arbitrarily high-priced) bids. In a uniform price auction, such “free riding” places the bidder first in line
18:849:69816:12:12:64:531:625:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:for shares but may have little effect on the clearing price. However, each such bid reduces the pool of shares available
18:850:69936:12:12:64:530:613:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:to investors who actively participate in price discovery.  In our earlier example where there is a 50% probability of
18:851:70053:12:12:64:530:601:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:20 sophisticated bidders and a 50% probability of 150 sophisticated bidders, suppose there is also a chance that five
18:852:70170:12:12:64:530:589:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:uninformed free riders may unexpectedly enter, bidding a sufficiently high price to be sure of getting shares.  If the
18:853:70288:12:12:64:530:577:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:auction turns out to have a low participation level of only 20 sophisticated bidders, the expected return to a winning
18:854:70406:12:12:64:530:565:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:bid is 66% with no free riders but only 36% with 5 unexpected free riders.  If it is a high participation auction, the
18:855:70524:12:12:64:530:553:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:expected return to winning bidders is -7% without free riders and falls to -13% with 5 unexpected free riders.  The
18:856:70639:12:12:64:530:541:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:problem is that, with 5 free riders, sophisticated bidders think that they are bidding for 15 units when in fact they are
18:857:70760:12:12:64:386:529:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:competing for 15 - 5=10 units, and hence are not shaving their bids sufficiently.
18:858:70841:12:12:79:530:517:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Thus, if the other bidders do not anticipate the free riders and adjust their bids accordingly, their expected return
18:859:70958:12:12:64:530:505:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:will be lowered. If other bidders have rational expectations regarding the distribution from which the number of free
18:860:71075:12:12:64:530:493:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:riders comes, they will shave their bids accordingly, lowering the expected proceeds to the issuer. As with uncertainty
18:861:71194:12:12:64:530:481:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:over the total number of bidders, uncertainty over the number of free riders increases risk for both issuers and investors,
18:862:71317:12:12:64:530:469:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:even in an equilibrium in which everyone’s expectations are correct on average. Thus we argue that uncertainty over
18:863:71432:12:12:64:530:457:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:the number of bidders, their information sets or their bidding strategies can lead to more underpricing, more risk and
18:864:71550:12:24:64:148:445:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:less accurate pricing.
18:865:71572:24:15:64:122:421:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:4.4.  Summary
18:866:71585:15:11:79:530:406:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:In this section, we first modeled auctions in a frictionless environment in which all eligible bidders are endowed
18:867:71699:11:12:64:530:395:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:with valuable private signals and bid in every auction.  In this case auctions are underpriced on average, but not by
18:868:71816:12:12:64:530:383:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:much when bidders are risk neutral and there are sufficiently large numbers of bidders.  Risk aversion on the part of
18:869:71933:12:12:64:530:371:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:bidders increases the average underpricing, but auction discounts are still relatively low. This is the oft-cited auction
18:870:72054:12:12:64:530:359:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:solution in which more bidders leads to a more efficient result, with underpricing largely vanishing once sufficient
18:871:72170:12:12:64:530:347:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:numbers of investors bid. Hence, in a frictionless world with no information generation costs, auctions lead to highly
18:872:72288:12:12:64:435:335:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:efficient pricing as long as they are open to large numbers of informed, sophisticated bidders.
18:873:72383:12:12:79:530:323:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:We next examined some more realistic settings, beginning with one in which there is uncertainty over the number
18:874:72494:12:12:64:531:311:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:of bidders.  Bidding becomes difficult when there is uncertainty about the number of bidders, how much they know
18:875:72606:12:12:64:530:299:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:and what strategies they will follow, leading to more risk, more underpricing and less efficient price discovery.  Free
18:876:72725:12:12:64:530:287:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:riders (those who choose to bid very high to be first in line, without investing in information generation) add risk
18:877:72841:12:12:64:530:275:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:for other bidders and for the issuer, with the issuer ultimately having to underprice more because of the presence of
18:878:72958:12:12:64:530:263:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:potential free riders.  That suggests a role for monitoring bidders and limiting their access to reduce the free riding
18:879:73077:12:12:64:100:251:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:problem.
18:880:73085:12:12:79:530:239:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Last, we showed that it is not easy to bid in auctions, and that even sophisticated bidders can make mistakes. When
18:881:73200:12:12:64:530:227:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:investors make bidding errors, or when they follow suboptimal strategies such as return-chasing, costs are imposed
18:882:73314:12:12:64:530:215:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:not only on those bidders themselves but on all auction participants and ultimately on issuers. The bidding errors and
18:883:73432:12:12:64:530:203:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:problems that we have shown in this section appear to match the problems that have occurred in practice in many
18:884:73543:12:30:64:381:191:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:auctions around the world, as we will explore in more detail in the next section.

19:892:74193:12:12:64:530:684:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:returns. One example is the 1993 auction of Japan Railway East, which was in such strong demand that it was heavily
19:893:74308:12:12:64:530:672:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:oversubscribed and yet traded as high as 70% above the auction clearing price on its first day.  In contrast, the later
19:894:74427:12:12:64:530:660:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:auction of Japan Railway West attracted only about one-fifth as many bidders and was 20% undersubscribed.  When
19:895:74538:12:12:64:530:648:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:El Al, the Israeli Airline, was auctioned offin 2003, the IPO was widely considered a hot offering. However, demand
19:896:74653:12:12:64:530:636:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:was so unexpectedly low that orders barely covered the minimum number of shares.   Within days,  the stock was
19:897:74763:12:12:64:530:624:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:trading for more than double the auction price (a 112% increase) on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, and investors were
19:898:74878:12:12:64:530:612:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:complaining that the process had been unfair,because more people would have bid if they had known that the auction
19:899:74992:12:12:64:530:600:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:price would be so low.  However, by the very nature of sealed bid auctions, no one knows how many others have
19:900:75101:12:12:64:392:588:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:placed bids until after the bidding period has closed, when it is too late to respond.
19:901:75187:12:12:79:530:576:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Argentina offers an example of how success with one auction can lead to problems with the next. Argentina began
19:902:75298:12:12:64:530:564:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:a massive privatization program with the auction of shares in Telefonica de Argentina in December, 1991. Institutional
19:903:75416:12:12:64:530:552:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:demand was lower than expected, since many professional investors thought that the minimum bid price was too high.
19:904:75530:12:12:64:530:540:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:However, massive interest by retail investors drove the auction clearing price to 45% above the minimum bid.  The
19:905:75643:12:12:64:530:528:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:stock rose another 20% during aftermarket trading, and the auction was described as a ”smashing success”. The next
19:906:75757:12:12:64:530:516:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:privatization, for Argentina Telecom, came less than four months later. Because the Telefonica auction had been such
19:907:75873:12:12:64:530:504:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:a success,  many were eager to cash in on the Telecom auction.   Bids totaled almost 6 billion pesos,  although the
19:908:75988:12:11:64:530:492:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:government had only hoped to raise 1 billion pesos.  The auction price was bid up to almost twice the reservation
19:909:76101:11:12:64:530:481:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:price, due to the strong demand from local investors.  The initial return on Telecom’s IPO (based on the first day’s
19:910:76217:12:12:64:530:469:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:closing price) was 3.6%, which means that the stock would be considered fairly accurately priced in most academic
19:911:76330:12:12:64:94:457:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:studies.
19:912:76338:12:12:79:530:445:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:But the auction price was unsustainable.  Many investors had funded their purchase with 90 day margin loans,
19:913:76446:12:12:64:530:433:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:and by the time those loans were due, the stock price had fallen far enough that many discouraged investors chose
19:914:76559:12:12:64:530:421:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:not to meet margin calls on their Telecom shares, while others sold other shares to meet their Telecom margin calls.
19:915:76675:12:12:64:530:409:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Brokerages had to dump more and more shares onto the market because of missed margin calls, causing a general
19:916:76784:12:12:64:530:397:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:market  crash  and  the  cancellation  of  up  to  20  other  planned  IPOs  in  Argentina.   Telecom  was  later  described  as
19:917:76912:12:12:64:530:385:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:”viciously overpriced” because, according to a banker at Banco de Galicia, ”Everyone had seen how well Telefonica
19:918:77025:12:12:64:530:373:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:(the other telephone privatization) had gone, and their total analysis was ’if Telefonica was a sell-out then Telecom
19:919:77142:12:12:64:530:361:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:will be too’.  What happened was that the Dutch-auction system exacerbated things because people pushed up their
19:920:77254:12:12:64:242:349:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f4:price to make sure they would get shares.”41
19:921:77298:12:12:79:530:337:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Thus, there are many examples of extreme initial returns resulting from IPO auctions.  These do not prove that
19:922:77408:12:12:64:530:325:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:auctions are inferior to other issue methods, since other methods have also led to large positive or negative initial
19:923:77525:12:12:64:530:313:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:returns. Nevertheless, these examples show that the pricing accuracy of the sealed bid IPO auction method should not
19:924:77641:12:12:64:530:301:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:be taken for granted. Regarding the question of whether auctions lead to less underpricing, relative to book building,
19:925:77759:12:12:64:530:289:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:the  overall  evidence  is  surprisingly  weak,  since  there  is  little  data  that  allows  a  direct  comparison.   The  relevant
19:926:77892:12:17:64:301:277:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:comparisons that have been made to date are the following:
19:927:77950:17:12:79:530:260:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f4:•France:  Auctions co-existed with a restricted, sub-optimal form of book building (a sequential hybrid, rather
19:928:78061:12:12:89:530:248:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:than ‘open pricing’ which is a simultaneous hybrid) until 1999, when more standard book building was allowed
19:929:78169:12:11:89:530:236:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:and auctions were quickly abandoned.Derrien and Womack(2003) found that the differences in underpricing
19:930:78272:11:12:89:530:225:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:between auctions and book building were “small and statistically insignificant when examined unconditionally”
19:931:78381:12:12:89:530:213:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:(page 47), but that auctions were better than the sequential hybrid book builds in their “ability to incorporate
19:932:78493:12:12:89:530:201:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:more information from recent market conditions into the IPO price” (abstract), thus confirming that the differ-
19:933:78604:12:19:89:442:189:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:ences were due to the regulatory restrictions on book building that were later eliminated.
19:934:78694:19:12:79:530:170:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f4:•Japan: Auctions were required for many years but vanished quickly in 1997, once book building was allowed.
19:935:78801:12:12:89:530:158:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Thus, the two methods did not overlap but were used in close succession.Kutsuna and Smith(2004) found
19:936:78902:12:12:89:530:146:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:a small but statistically significant increase in initial returns under book building, and also found that a wider
19:937:79016:12:20:89:461:134:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:range of companies, including younger start-ups, were able to go public under book building.

20:939:79216:0:12:79:530:720:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f4:•India:  Regulations were changed in 2005 to prohibit book building,  replacing it with auctions.   Bubna and
20:940:79325:12:20:89:428:708:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Prabhala (2009) find that auctions led to more underpricing, relative to book buildng.
20:941:79411:20:12:79:530:688:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:The evidence is inconclusive, since auctions have led to less underpricing in Japan, more underpricing in India
20:942:79522:12:23:64:380:676:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:and to no statistically significant difference in France, relative to book building.
20:943:79606:23:15:64:191:653:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:5.2.  IPO Auctions in Singapore
20:944:79637:15:12:79:530:638:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:The available data on auctions is sparse and not easily amenable to rigorous quantitative analysis using statistical
20:945:79753:12:12:64:530:626:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:methods, since most countries that have tried IPO auctions gave up on them after a few years, leading to small samples.
20:946:79872:12:12:64:530:614:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:For example, the influentialKandel, Sarig and Wohl(1999) paper is based on only 28 IPO auctions in Israel, while
20:947:79984:12:12:64:530:602:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Degeorge, Derrien and Womack(2007) examine only 19 auctions in the U.S. Moreover, data on participation levels
20:948:80094:12:12:64:150:590:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:are often unavailable.
20:949:80116:12:12:79:530:578:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Singapore’s IPO auctions during 1993-1994 present an interesting natural experiment and an illustration of some
20:950:80227:12:12:64:530:566:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:of the potential issues that we believe is of general relevance. We have data on the full sample of all 20 uniform price
20:951:80347:12:12:64:468:554:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:IPO auctions in Singapore, and will attempt a quantitative characterization of that data in this section.
20:952:80452:12:12:79:530:542:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:The lessons from the Singapore experience are relevant for several reasons.  First, Singapore is a sophisticated
20:953:80564:12:12:64:530:530:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:financial center whose banking and security markets are well regulated. One example of its technological sophistica-
20:954:80680:12:12:64:530:518:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:tion is the fact that IPO auction bidders beginning in 1993 could place their bids through automated teller machines
20:955:80796:12:12:64:530:506:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:(ATMs), thus making those auctions as widely accessible as online internet auctions are today.  The Singapore stock
20:956:80911:12:12:64:530:494:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:market in 1993 was fairly well developed and active, with two active exchanges, 241 public companies traded, and
20:957:81023:12:12:64:298:482:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:S$280 billion of average daily dollar transaction volume42.
20:958:81082:12:12:79:530:470:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Singapore’s uniform price auctions were hybrids and thus were well suited to reduce the impact of free riders,
20:959:81192:12:12:64:530:458:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:since uninformed investors could also participate, without specifying a price, through the simultaneous fixed price
20:960:81307:12:12:64:530:446:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:tranche.  Therefore, if there is evidence of free riders including return chasers becoming an issue in hybrid uniform
20:961:81424:12:24:64:425:434:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:price auctions, they are likely to be even more of an issue in ‘pure’ uniform price auctions.
20:962:81517:24:12:64:129:410:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:5.2.1.  The Data

23:1107:84902:17:9:64:530:698:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:All 1993-1994 auctions are ordered by date.  One month raw returns are the returns to winning bidders that held their shares for 30 days in the
23:1108:85045:9:10:64:530:689:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:aftermarket.  The 4-IPO moving average is the average return on the last 4 offers (or all previous, if less than 4).  The oversubscription rate is in
23:1109:85194:10:274:64:384:679:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:percent – an offering that was 60% oversubscribed received orders for 1.6 times the shares available.

23:1111:85334:13:12:79:530:392:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:The hybrid auction scheme was first introduced as an option for Singapore on July 29, 1991, when companies
23:1112:85440:12:12:64:530:380:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:were  allowed  to  offer  part  of  the  issue  in  a  “Dutch”  (discriminatory)  auction.   It,  however,  has  not  gained  much
23:1113:85570:12:11:64:530:368:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:popularity, with only one Dutch tender IPO (Singapore Computer Systems) in 1991, and one more (Keppel Integrated
23:1114:85682:11:12:64:530:357:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Engineering) in 199244.  No other IPO auctions took place in Singapore until February 1993, when an alternative
23:1115:85793:12:12:64:292:345:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:uniform price (“French”) auction system was introduced.
23:1116:85848:12:12:79:530:333:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A timeline showing Singapore IPO auctions’ size, 1-year returns and subscription levels in 1993-1994 is shown in
23:1117:85960:12:12:64:148:321:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Figure8 and Table2.
23:1118:85979:12:12:79:530:309:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Figure9 provides visual evidence of how Singapore’s auctions evolved over time by plotting one month returns
23:1119:86087:12:12:64:530:297:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:and subscription levels for all of Singapore’s auctions, ordered chronologically.  Although there were variations, the
23:1120:86205:12:12:64:530:285:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:returns and participation levels for IPO auctions fell over time. Investors would have made money on five of the first
23:1121:86323:12:12:64:530:273:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:seven uniform price auctions (known as tenders) in Singapore, if they had bought at the auction strike price and sold
23:1122:86440:12:12:64:530:261:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:after the shares had traded for one month.  The average raw return on the first seven offerings was 11.7%, for this
23:1123:86555:12:12:64:530:249:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:holding period, and the average oversubscription ratio was 4.2 (420% oversubscribed).  However, the returns were
23:1124:86667:12:12:64:530:237:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:negative for seven of the last eight auctions done in Singapore, with an average one-month return of -5.1% for these

23:1129:87071:10:12:72:531:170:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:45A similar pattern occurred for the 19 U.S. IPO auctions that have been lead-managed by WR Hambrecht from 1999-2007 analyzed inDegeorge
23:1130:87207:12:10:64:530:158:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:et al.(Forthcoming).   For the first 9 IPOs,  from 1999-2003,  the mean initial return is 29.1% with a standard deviation of 84.3%.   Excluding
23:1131:87350:10:9:64:530:148:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:Andover.net, which is arguably an outlier, the mean and standard deviation are 1.3% and 11.5%.  For the next 10 IPO auctions from 2004-2007,
23:1132:87490:9:9:64:530:139:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:the mean initial return is -0.1% with a standard deviation of 5.3%. This less attractive performance, from the standpoint of investors, in the second

24:1138:88173:10:9:64:530:561:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:of the subscription period. The raw returns are total returns to a bidder who purchased a share at the auction clearing price and sold at the close of
24:1139:88323:9:10:64:530:552:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:the corresponding period. Adjusted returns are defined as the difference between raw and market returns (as measured by the Straits Times Index)
24:1140:88467:10:25:64:301:542:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:in the corresponding period. All market returns are adjusted for dividends.

25:1171:90441:12:12:79:530:708:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:While  the  oversubscription  level  for  the  last  eight  auctions  was  0.7,  which  means  that  offerings  were  still  on

25:1173:90682:12:12:64:530:684:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:auctions. Two of the last five auctions were undersubscribed, including the last auction, for Sunright, which received
25:1174:90800:12:11:64:530:672:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:bids for only 18% of the shares available.  The average number of bidders per auction was 48,095 for the first seven

25:1176:91047:12:12:64:530:649:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:relative to the Straits Times Index (blue chips) or Sesdaq Index (smaller, younger companies), or if we use two month
25:1177:91164:12:12:64:530:637:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:returns.  It would appear that for investors who were learning and updating their priors over time, auctions became
25:1178:91279:12:12:64:121:625:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:less attractive.
25:1179:91295:12:12:79:531:613:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:We argued in Section4.3that a large number of unanticipated bids will result in the auction clearing price being
25:1180:91407:12:12:64:530:601:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:too  high,  whereas  a  surprisingly  low  subscription  rate  will  lead  to  large  underpricing.   We  further  observed  that
25:1181:91536:12:12:64:530:589:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:unanticipated free riders, including return-chasers, may make auctions less attractive for sophisticated investors.  We
25:1182:91655:12:24:64:398:577:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:examine the data in three steps to see whether there is support for these conjectures.

25:1184:91784:13:12:79:531:540:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Here we investigate what factors affect popularity of a particular IPO auction and whether there is evidence of

25:1186:91919:12:12:79:530:516:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:First, we check whether high returns to participating in the preceding auction leads to a higher participation rate

25:1195:92462:20:12:79:530:359:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Since in Singapore the auction and fixed price tranches occurred simultaneously (as opposed to countries like
25:1196:92571:12:12:64:530:347:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Taiwan where tranches took place sequentially,) fixed price tranche demand is a good proxy of overall demand at the
25:1197:92686:12:12:64:141:335:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:time of the auction.

26:1213:93936:12:12:64:530:696:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:bidders are significantly positively related to our proxy for overall demand, as expected.  And, after controlling for
26:1214:94054:12:12:64:530:684:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:demand, the subscription rate or number of bidders is significantly positively related to the return on the second-to-last
26:1215:94176:12:29:64:452:672:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:auction, which is a sign of return-chasing. TheR2is 60% for Equation1 and 39% for Equation2.

26:1238:95244:21:12:79:530:402:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Thus, both higher underlying demand and a higher return to participating in a recent auction lead to higher partic-

26:1240:95390:12:12:79:530:378:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:It is also of interest how much of the variation in demand could be explained by the factors that were observable
26:1241:95503:12:12:64:530:366:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:by the participants in real time, i.e.  before the subscription date.  Therefore in the following specification we replace

26:1250:96170:20:12:79:530:214:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f7:It is easy to see that these real-time variables explain somewhat over half of the variation in participation (R2=
26:1251:96284:12:12:64:530:202:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:56%), again suggesting that return-chasing was taking place. Again, the coefficient on recent auction return is positive
26:1252:96404:12:12:64:186:190:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:and significant at the 1% level.
26:1253:96436:12:11:79:530:178:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:While a higher participation rate in the auction is positively related to a higher auction clearing price, the higher
26:1254:96553:11:31:64:530:167:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:price may be “rational”, reflecting a higher intrinsic value of the issue over and above that reflected in the fixed price

27:1259:97028:12:12:64:531:708:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:intrinsic value of the offering is higher, both the auction clearing price and the initial return to winning bidders will be
27:1260:97152:12:22:64:509:696:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:higher. It is therefore important to further investigate whether noise bidders adversely affected the environment.
27:1261:97266:22:13:64:236:674:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:5.2.4.  Bid Distribution and Future Returns
27:1262:97309:13:12:79:530:661:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:One reason for a high clearing price is naturally a high realization of the share value. Another possible reason for
27:1263:97425:12:12:64:530:649:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:such results may be the presence of free-riders: bidders who do not engage in price discovery but instead name a very
27:1264:97542:12:12:64:530:637:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:high price in order to obtain an allocation.  In an asymmetric equilibrium with such free-riders (whether anticipated
27:1265:97659:12:12:64:530:625:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:or unanticipated) the distribution of bids will be mixed:  the free-riders would bid high regardless of the underlying
27:1266:97777:12:12:64:322:613:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:value, and the other bidders would bid according to their signals.
27:1267:97843:12:12:79:530:601:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Cornelli et al. (2006) note that “in the case of IPOs,  Ritter and Welch(2002) conjecture that overenthusiasm
27:1268:97952:12:12:64:530:589:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:among retail investors may explain high first-day returns and low long-run returns. However, the extent to which the
27:1269:98068:12:12:64:530:577:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:presence of irrational investors (motivated by “investor sentiment”) can account for these phenomena is controversial,
27:1270:98186:12:12:64:531:565:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:not least because of the difficulty in empirically identifying the demand curves of different investor groups”.  This
27:1271:98303:12:12:64:530:553:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:difficulty presents a problem for us as well, since due to the multiple censoring of our dataset it is not possible for
27:1272:98422:12:12:64:530:541:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:us to directly observe individual bids.  However in what follows we present several quantitative results that seem to
27:1273:98539:12:12:64:225:529:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:confirm the presence of naive investors’.
27:1274:98580:12:12:79:530:517:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:The number of bid ranges in our bid data and their breakpoints are auction-specific and do not allow for direct
27:1275:98691:12:12:64:530:505:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:comparison between auctions.  However, in presence of free-riders there should be aggregate effects:  namely, their
27:1276:98806:12:12:64:422:493:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:presence should increase the variance of the bid distribution and create positive skewness.
27:1277:98897:12:11:79:530:481:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:On the other hand, a high mean bid can be a signal of either high underlying value, or free-rider presence, or both.
27:1278:99013:11:12:64:530:470:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Therefore, controlling for the mean, we would expect free-riders to drive up auction prices relative to the underlying
27:1279:99131:12:12:64:530:458:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:value, and potentially cause future negative returns. In line with prior reasoning, we would also expect free-riders to
27:1280:99250:12:12:64:281:446:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:be more prevalent among smaller individual bidders52.
27:1281:99303:12:12:79:530:434:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:We use a two-step estimation procedure:  first, we approximate the bid distribution in each auction by a separate
27:1282:99416:12:12:64:530:422:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:lognormal distribution. This distribution choice allows us to capture changes both in the mean (potentially attributed
27:1283:99534:12:12:64:530:410:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:to higher underlying value and overall, rational or irrational, level of excitement about the issue ) and in the skewness
27:1284:99655:12:12:64:530:398:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:and variance (which both positively depend on the same parameterσ).  In addition, these parameters, unlike range
27:1285:99767:12:12:64:236:386:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:statistics, can be compared across auctions.
27:1286:99811:12:31:79:367:374:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:We use maximum likelihood to estimate the bid distribution parameters:

27:1296:100106:12:11:64:530:291:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:sufficient data53. As one can see, most losses characterize auctions with either a highμ, or a highσ, or both, which is
27:1297:100225:11:12:64:510:280:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:a picture that one would observe in presence of a large number of bidders who do not engage in price discovery.

27:1299:100449:12:12:64:530:256:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:returns.  Given the small sample size, a robust version of the estimation is presented in Table4, Panel B, showing
27:1300:100563:12:12:64:531:244:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:similar results.  We can see from these tables that either a highμ, or a highσ, or both, are significantly negatively
27:1301:100680:12:12:64:530:232:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:related to one year returns on the offerings, as one would expect if the auction price and initial demand are influenced
27:1302:100800:12:12:64:332:220:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:by a large number of bidders who do not engage in price discovery.
27:1303:100866:12:12:79:530:208:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:One last piece of evidence of the presence of free riders in our data is the analysis of the very highest bids.  If
27:1304:100981:12:25:64:530:196:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:a bid is so high that it seems implausible as a genuine result of careful analysis, the more likely explanation is free
27:1305:101100:25:13:72:531:171:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:52For IPO auctions in Taiwan, Chiang et al.(2009a) find that institutional investors are informed and bidding optimally, but that retail investors
27:1306:101246:13:9:64:531:158:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:are return-chasing and following suboptimal bidding strategies.Chiang et al.(2009b) find further evidence that retail (but not institutional) investors

27:1309:101594:7:12:72:530:132:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:53Since two auctions were undersubscribed, we are not able to estimate the bid distribution shape there.  However we note that both of these
27:1310:101734:12:9:64:530:120:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:auctions produced positive returns (48.3% in case of Sunright and 6.4% for LiangHuat Aluminum), and their undersubscription implies either a
27:1311:101874:9:0:64:287:111:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:lowμ, or lowσ, or both, so we consider our results to be conservative

29:1393:104117:0:12:64:530:720:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:riding, and thus we look for excessively high bids in our data.  In four of our twenty auctions, the highest bids were
29:1394:104235:12:12:64:530:708:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:more than 1,000% of the reservation price.  The highest bid was 1,153% (817%) of the reservation price (clearing
29:1395:104347:12:12:64:530:696:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:price) for STIC, 1,200% (1,182%) for Eng Wah, 1,700% (1,000%) for Hwa Tat Lee Holdings and 5,000% (2,778%)
29:1396:104453:12:12:64:530:684:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:for Singapore Telecom.  In the case of Singapore Telecom, the reservation price of $2.00 translated to a prospective
29:1397:104569:12:11:64:530:672:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:price-earnings (PE) multiple of 27 times. The highest bid was 50 times this, implying a PE of 1,350 times for a mature
29:1398:104687:11:12:64:530:661:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:company in an established industry. This is clear evidence of the presence of at least some free riders, while our earlier
29:1399:104809:12:24:64:447:649:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:analysis indicates that there were sufficient numbers of such investors to affect the auction price.
29:1400:104909:24:15:64:211:625:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:5.3.  Lessons from Treasury Auctions
29:1401:104945:15:12:79:530:610:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:The auction method is old and well established, and has been particularly successful for the largest security issue
29:1402:105060:12:12:64:530:598:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:markets – those for government debt, particularly US Treasury securities. Auctions have been frequently used for new
29:1403:105176:12:12:64:530:586:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:preferred stock issues in the United Kingdom, particularly for government-owned utilities54. Key differences between
29:1404:105292:12:12:64:530:574:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:government debt and IPOs make auctions theoretically more likely to work for these high grade debt auctions. First,
29:1405:105407:12:12:64:531:562:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Treasury auctions are held frequently at regular time intervals, with a core of regular participants.Fleming(2007)
29:1406:105521:12:12:64:530:550:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:shows that,  for 903 US Treasury security auctions between July 30,  2001 and December 28,  2005,  75.4% of the
29:1407:105632:12:12:64:530:538:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:securities were purchased by dealers and brokers. Although there are more than 800 financial institutions set up to bid
29:1408:105751:12:12:64:530:526:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:directly in Treasury auctions, they accounted for only 0.5% of the allocations, with individuals accounting for another
29:1409:105870:12:12:64:530:514:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:0.5%.   Thus,  Treasury auctions have a stable set of regular bidders – the 22 primary dealers that are expected to
29:1410:105985:12:12:64:530:502:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:participate regularly. Moreover, close substitutes to the extremely high grade debt securities being issued are already
29:1411:106104:12:12:64:530:490:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:trading actively in the market (on the when issued market, through the offthe run securities, etc.), making valuation
29:1412:106221:12:12:64:172:478:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:relatively easy and precise.
29:1413:106249:12:12:79:530:466:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:In  spite  of  these  advantages  it  took  several  decades  for  auctions  to  replace  the  fixed  price  method  for  selling
29:1414:106378:12:12:64:531:454:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Treasury bonds,  even after auctions had been adopted for US Treasury bills.Garbade(2004) provides a detailed
29:1415:106487:12:12:64:530:442:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:analysis of this process,  noting in particular how back in 1959 the Secretary of the Treasury Robert Anderson in
29:1416:106600:12:12:64:530:430:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:his testimony before the Joint Economic Committee defended the fixed price method, stating that “many of the small
29:1417:106714:12:12:64:530:418:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:banks, corporations, and individuals... did not have the professional capacity to bid in an auction. Lacking professional
29:1418:106835:12:11:64:530:406:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:expertise, they were liable to either bid too high and pay too much or bid too low and be shut out, and therefore were
29:1419:106953:11:12:64:530:395:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:likely to avoid note and bond auctions altogether”.Garbade(2004) further demonstrates that these worries were quite
29:1420:107068:12:12:64:530:383:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:well-founded, given that the US Treasury failed in its first two attempts, in 1935 and 1963, to establish auctions for
29:1421:107186:12:12:64:530:371:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:long term bond sales.  The third attempt, in the early 1970s, succeeded due to the Treasury’s combined “familiarity,
29:1422:107302:12:12:64:235:359:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:gradualism, and willingness to improvise”.
29:1423:107344:12:12:79:530:347:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Fleming and Garbade (2002, Table 2) show that even now, of the four main securities lending facilities in the
29:1424:107453:12:12:64:530:335:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:US  and  UK,  two  of  the  four  use  fixed  price  public  offers  rather  than  auctions.   One  reason  for  this  can  be  that
29:1425:107585:12:12:64:531:323:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:bidding is difficult even for today’s sophisticated institutional investors.  For example,Fleming and Garbade(2007)
29:1426:107700:12:12:64:530:311:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:offer evidence that dealers frequently fail to shave their bids sufficiently in certain types of US Treasury auctions,
29:1427:107818:12:12:64:530:299:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:passing up “true arbitrage opportunities” in these auctions.Fleming et al.(2005) show that they also fail to exploit
29:1428:107934:12:12:64:531:287:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:certain simple mechanical profit opportunities55. On the other hand,Goldreich(2007) shows that both discriminatory
29:1429:108048:12:12:64:530:275:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:and uniform price Treasury auctions lead to underpricing.  Thus,  even in cases when some of the easiest-to-value
29:1430:108161:12:12:64:530:263:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:securities are sold to a regular set of sophisticated investors, there is evidence that the auction method has not always
29:1431:108282:12:12:64:530:251:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:been preferred over fixed price methods, and that these regular bidders sometimes lack the sophistication to place
29:1432:108396:12:12:64:531:239:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:optimal bids.  In contrast, IPOs occur less frequently, at sporadic intervals, and their value is much more difficult to
29:1433:108516:12:12:64:531:227:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:determine.  Each issue is different and may attract a different set of participants, many of whom have little relevant
29:1434:108634:12:12:64:530:215:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:experience. Thus, the apparent relative success of contemporary auctions for government debt does not guarantee that
29:1435:108750:12:12:64:267:203:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:the auction method will also be preferred for IPOs.
29:1436:108801:12:12:79:530:191:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:As we can see,  even in Treasury auctions,  it took a while to make things work.  The key feature is the stable
29:1437:108912:12:30:64:510:179:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:number of sophisticated bidders, coupled with a noncompetitive tranche to accomodate unsophisticated bidders.
29:1438:109021:30:12:72:531:149:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:54In the six month period from Oct. 1, 1974 to March 31, 1975, all seven preferred stock issues in the UK used ”Offers for Sale by Tender”, i.e.
29:1439:109165:12:7:64:281:137:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:auctions. The issuers were all local waterworks or water companies.
29:1440:109232:7:12:72:530:130:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:55Due to the specific price rounding scheme used in Treasury bill auctions, some bids offer strictly inferior expected profits;  however many
29:1441:109373:12:0:64:212:118:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:participants still bid at those suboptimal levels
30:1442:109424:0:21:64:124:720:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:6. Conclusion
30:1443:109437:21:12:79:530:699:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:In this paper, we first established a surprising empirical regularity - that IPO auctions have been tried in at least 25
30:1444:109557:12:12:64:530:687:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:countries, and have generally been rejected in favor of other methods for bringing new equity issues to the market. IPO
30:1445:109676:12:11:64:530:675:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:auctions have been used for issues of all sizes, from very small to very large. The auction methods used have varied,
30:1446:109793:11:12:64:530:664:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:yet the outcomes have been surprisingly consistent:  When issuers have been given a choice,  they have generally
30:1447:109905:12:12:64:530:652:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:chosen not to use auctions once they became familiar with the method. In this sense, IPO auctions have consistently
30:1448:110020:12:12:64:150:640:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:failed the market test.
30:1449:110043:12:12:79:530:628:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:We did not find support for the common explanations offered for the unpopularity of IPO auctions in the US - that
30:1450:110156:12:12:64:530:616:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:issuers were reluctant to use a new, experimental method, or that underwriters pressured issuers to use a method for
30:1451:110272:12:12:64:530:604:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:which they charged higher fees or were able to allocate underpriced shares.  We did not find that issuers consistently
30:1452:110390:12:12:64:530:592:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:preferred the method that led to the lowest initial returns.  Moreover, there is little support for the popular view that
30:1453:110511:12:12:64:444:580:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:auctions lead to highly accurate pricing and hence to a low mean and variance of initial returns.
30:1454:110608:12:12:79:530:568:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:In order to explain these regularities,  we examined the issue of complexity.  While indirect mechanisms,  such
30:1455:110719:12:12:64:530:556:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:as auctions, may have simple rules, this does not imply that the investors’ task is in any way simple:  for example,
30:1456:110835:12:12:64:530:544:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:bidders must place their bids before knowing how many others will enter the auction, and those who invest time and

30:1459:111134:12:12:79:530:508:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:The optimal bid for any one participant depends on the number of other bidders, their information sets and their
30:1460:111246:12:12:64:530:496:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:bidding strategies, but none of this is known at the time that bids are placed in a sealed bid auction – presenting a
30:1461:111363:12:12:64:530:484:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:structural risk, which can easily exceed the uncertainty about valuation of the company itself. In other words, optimal
30:1462:111482:12:12:64:530:472:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:auction bidding strategies are complicated, requiring sophistication and discipline, and mistakes by some impose costs
30:1463:111600:12:12:64:530:460:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:on all bidders.  Without some way to screen out “free riders” and ensure the participation of sophisticated, long term
30:1464:111718:12:12:64:336:448:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:investors, IPO auctions are highly risky for both issuers and bidders.
30:1465:111788:12:12:79:530:436:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Book building, on the other hand, requires less bidder sophistication.  With book building the underwriter can
30:1466:111898:12:12:64:530:424:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:act as a gatekeeper,  coordinating the number and type of entrants,  and setting the price and allocations only after
30:1467:112015:12:11:64:530:412:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:observing all orders.   At the same time,  book building gives enormous discretion to the mechanism administrator
30:1468:112128:11:12:64:530:401:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:(i.e.  underwriter), whereas auctions are transparent with little discretion.  Book building is thus vulnerable to abuse
30:1469:112248:12:12:64:530:389:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:by underwriters, at the expense of issuers56.  Jagannathan and Sherman (2005) propose ways to make book building
30:1470:112360:12:12:64:531:377:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:more transparent and thus, effectively, closer to auctions in that sense.  The optimal placement method is likely to be
30:1471:112479:12:12:64:531:365:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:different from both traditional book builds, with their lack of transparency and resulting opportunities for potential
30:1472:112597:12:12:64:423:353:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:abuse, and standard sealed bid auctions, with their high risk for both investors and issuers.
30:1473:112690:12:12:79:530:341:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Standard sealed bid auctions have rigid, automatic pricing and allocation rules that do not appear to satisfy the
30:1474:112803:12:12:64:530:329:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:many goals that issuers have for IPOs, based on the market test. However this does not mean that optimal auctions –
30:1475:112918:12:12:64:530:317:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:or more generally, transparent placement methods – cannot be designed.57One simple change which might improve
30:1476:113027:12:12:64:531:305:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:auction outcomes is to use hybrids,  with retail investors allowed to participate only in the fixed price public offer
30:1477:113145:12:12:64:530:293:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:tranche.  This is a somewhat crude but simple and cheap way to try to limit auction participants to a relatively small,
30:1478:113264:12:12:64:530:281:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:predictable number of sophisticated bidders. Retail investors would still be able to participate in hybrid IPOs through
30:1479:113383:12:12:64:384:269:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:the retail tranche, but they would not be able to disrupt the price-setting process.
30:1480:113467:12:12:79:530:257:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Although the outcomes in various countries have been surprisingly consistent in terms of which issue methods
30:1481:113575:12:12:64:530:245:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:have been chosen by issuers,  it is important to offer a menu of alternatives to issuers,  since the best method may
30:1482:113691:12:12:64:530:233:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:depend on conditions and may change over time.  For example, uniform price auctions may be a better method in
30:1483:113800:12:12:64:531:221:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:exuberant times, when accurate evaluation is difficult and thus not the main driver of pricing, such as with dot.coms
30:1484:113917:12:12:64:530:209:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:during the internet bubble. At that time dot com stock valuations were probably driven mostly by animal spirits. The
30:1485:114033:12:12:64:530:197:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:use of uniform price auctions would have allowed the offer prices to be driven up until the shares were overpriced
30:1486:114147:12:12:64:530:185:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:by most estimations, leading to aftermarket price drops that would have popped the bubble earlier.  Since each issue
30:1487:114263:12:30:64:530:173:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:method has advantages and neither clearly dominates, only the market can tell whether there is a place for both or only
30:1488:114382:30:12:72:530:143:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:56Moreover, the Facebook IPO in 2012 shows that book building does not guarantee predictable outcomes. IPO investors face risk under any of
30:1489:114521:12:7:64:156:131:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:the current offering methods.
30:1490:114550:7:12:72:530:124:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:57For example,  the optimal auction inSpatt and Srivastava(1991) incorporates both pre-play communication and participation restrictions.
30:1491:114687:12:0:64:480:112:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:Similarly, a dynamic auction such as that suggested byAusubel(2002) might work better than what has been tried so far for IPOs.
31:1492:114816:0:12:64:530:720:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:one of them. Having competing mechanisms available to issuers at any given point in time will be to the advantage of
31:1493:114932:12:12:64:197:708:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:investors as well as issuing firms.
31:1494:114967:12:12:79:531:696:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:In summary, there have been many experiments with IPO auctions across different countries, cultures and market
31:1495:115077:12:12:64:531:684:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:conditions over the last several decades.  However, auctions have failed to capture sufficient market share.  We offer
31:1496:115195:12:11:64:530:672:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:an explanation for this, based on the complexity of optimal bidding strategies and the vulnerability of each bidder
31:1497:115310:11:12:64:530:661:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:to mistakes by others.  Suitably designed auctions that overcome these limitations may well be preferred over book

31:1499:115492:30:21:64:226:619:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Appendix A. Baseline Auction Model
31:1500:115526:21:12:79:530:598:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:Consider a simple uniform-price auction:  There areKlots of IPO shares offered for sale.  Each lot consists ofn
31:1501:115637:12:11:64:530:586:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:shares, where all shares have the same random, ex ante unknown value ofVto everyone, with a common knowledge
31:1502:115745:11:12:64:530:575:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:priorG(V), with EV<∞, which is assumed to have a positive density everywhere on a compact supportΩV⊆R+.
31:1503:115848:12:12:64:530:563:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:There areNidentical bidders who compete for the allocations.  Utility of a bidder who receives an allocation ofx
31:1504:115960:12:12:64:531:551:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:shares at a pricepis given byu(c0+(V−p)x), whereuis a strictly increasing, concave function, andc0is his initial
31:1505:116072:12:12:64:530:539:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:capital. Without loss of generality, we normalizeu(c0)=0. The expected value of shares and expected utility are both
31:1506:116188:12:12:64:362:527:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:assumed to be finite: EV<∞, Eu(c0+(V−p)x)<∞∀p∈ΩV,0≤x≤1.
31:1507:116243:12:12:79:531:515:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:For  expositional  convenience  we  consider  a  unit-demand  auction,  where  allK=15  winning  bidders  receive
31:1508:116356:12:12:64:467:503:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:identical allocations of one lot of shares each, and allN−Klosing bidders receive an allocation of 0.
31:1509:116457:12:12:79:531:491:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:We first consider the case with zero information and transaction costs.  Every bidderi,i=1...Nreceives condi-

31:1512:116658:18:12:64:531:437:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:whereF(si|V) is assumed to have a finite expectation and a strictly positive density over a compact supportΩ. Without
31:1513:116775:12:12:64:281:425:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:loss of generality, we impose a normalization Esi=V.
31:1514:116827:12:12:79:530:413:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:After observing their signalssi, the agents submit their bidsbifor one lot each.  The agents’ strategy (orbidding
31:1515:116940:12:12:64:381:401:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:function)B(s) is the correspondence between their signals and bids:bi=Bi(si).
31:1516:117017:12:12:79:531:389:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:The auctioneer collects bidsb={b1...bN}, determines the clearing price and allocates one (and only one) lot of
31:1517:117127:12:12:64:530:377:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:shares to every bidder whose bid is above the clearing price. An allocation without preferences and rationing implies
31:1518:117244:12:12:64:530:365:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:that the auction clearing pricep∈[b(K+1),b(K)] – i.e.plies between the bids ofK’th and (K+1)’st agents58. For the
31:1519:117357:12:12:64:531:353:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:sake of argument, letp=b(K+1). Ties are broken at random (note that when the unconditional signal distribution has
31:1520:117471:12:12:64:510:341:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:no mass points and all bidders’ strategies are strictly increasing in their signals, a tie is a probability zero event).
31:1521:117591:12:12:79:530:329:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:An equilibrium allocation is such that for each bidderihis strategyBiis the optimal response to the collection of

32:1564:120188:12:12:64:530:481:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:symmetric case,  and its suitably adjusted modifications in the other cases.   The lognormal signal distribution was
32:1565:120304:12:12:64:530:469:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:approximated with a truncated lognormal on a range [S,S]=eμ−10σ,eμ+10σ]. Monte-Carlo integration with 100,000

32:1567:120527:12:12:64:531:445:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:abilities and avoid underflow we used importance sampling60.  In risk-neutral cases such as (A.3) the optimal bids
32:1568:120641:12:12:64:530:433:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:were computed directly; in the general case, a two-step procedure was used:  in the first step, a Monte-Carlo sam-
32:1569:120755:12:12:64:531:421:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:ple was generated; in the second, an iterative zero-finding algorithm61was used to find the optimal bidding function
32:1570:120871:12:12:64:530:409:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:conditional on the sample. We found that the solution is very robust with respect to the Monte-Carlo sample selection.
32:1571:120989:12:12:79:530:397:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:In order to improve computational performance, integration was used to evaluate the bidding functions on a grid
32:1572:121100:12:12:64:530:385:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:of values spanning [S,S], with piecewise cubic Hermite polynomials62used to interpolate the functions between the
32:1573:121213:12:12:64:109:373:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:grid points.
32:1574:121225:12:12:79:530:361:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Given bidding functions computed as above, various outcomes such as expected profits were also computed using
32:1575:121334:12:29:64:265:349:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Monte-Carlo simulation with 1,000,000 iterations.

32:1578:121470:14:12:79:531:285:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f4:•Tenaga Nasional, Malaysia, May 1992, 34%: Malaysia’s first auction was a hybrid discriminatory auction/public
32:1579:121580:12:12:89:530:273:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:offer.  Initial returns for winning bids ranged from 23% to 34%, even though the market-clearing price in the
32:1580:121689:12:20:89:530:261:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:auction was almost 46% above the 4.50 ringgit reservation price. The initial return for the public offer was 94%.
32:1581:121802:20:12:79:531:241:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f4:•DDI (an affiliate of Kyocera), Japan, September 1993, 49%: Bids went as high as ¥6.02 million/share. The offer
32:1582:121913:12:12:89:530:229:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:price was set at ¥3.7 million, because most successful bids were concentrated at that price. The first day’s close
32:1583:122027:12:19:89:168:217:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:was at ¥5.5 million.

33:1592:122650:12:12:89:530:708:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:price was 63% above the lowest winning bid, 23% above even the highest bid, 39% above the highest foreign
33:1593:122755:12:20:89:458:696:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:bid and 136% above the reservation price. The fixed price tranche drew 459,133 subscribers.

33:1595:122953:11:12:89:530:665:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:$24, reportedly to avoid any delay.  The first day’s closing price was 164% above even the auction clearing
