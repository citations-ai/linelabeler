2:37:2008:28:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:Combining administrative data from the U.S. Army, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the
2:38:2101:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:U.S. Social Security Administration, we analyze the effect of the VA’s Disability Compensation (DC)
2:39:2200:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:program on veterans’ labor force participation and earnings. The largely unstudied Disability Compensation
2:40:2306:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:program currently provides income and health insurance to almost four million veterans of military
2:41:2404:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:service who suffer service-connected disabilities. We study a unique policy change, the 2001 Agent
2:42:2502:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:Orange decision, which expanded DC eligibility for Vietnam veterans who had served in-theatre to
2:43:2598:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:a broader set of conditions such as type 2 diabetes. Exploiting the fact that the Agent Orange policy
2:44:2699:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:excluded Vietnam era veterans who did not serve in-theatre, we assess the causal effects of DC eligibility
2:45:2805:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:by contrasting the outcomes of these two Vietnam-era veteran groups. The Agent Orange policy catalyzed
2:46:2907:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:a sharp increase in DC enrollment among veterans who served in-theatre, raising the share receiving
2:47:3006:14:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:benefits by five percentage points over five years. Disability ratings and payments rose rapidly among
2:48:3108:14:14:72:540:420:12:Times:12:Times:those newly enrolled, with average annual non-taxed federal transfer payments increasing to $17K
2:49:3204:14:14:72:540:406:12:Times:12:Times:within five years. We estimate that benefits receipt reduced labor force participation by 18 percentage
2:50:3307:14:14:72:540:392:12:Times:12:Times:points among veterans enrolled due to the policy, though measured income net of transfer benefits
2:51:3404:14:14:72:540:378:12:Times:12:Times:rose on average. Consistent with the relatively advanced age and diminished health of Vietnam era
2:52:3501:14:14:72:540:364:12:Times:12:Times:veterans in this period, we estimate labor force participation elasticities that are somewhat higher than
2:53:3606:14:42:72:218:350:12:Times:12:Times:among the general population.

3:79:4072:25:25:90:514:666:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:This paper investigates the effect of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA’s) Disability 
3:80:4167:25:25:72:527:641:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Compensation (DC) program on the labor supply of military veterans. Since the ratification of the U.S. 
3:81:4269:25:25:72:535:616:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Constitution in 1789, the federal government has provided cash benefits to disabled veterans. During the 
3:82:4374:25:26:72:542:591:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Civil War, the benefit was revised from a flat payment scheme to a graduated schedule based on disability 
3:83:4478:26:25:72:542:565:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:severity. Multiple governmental agencies administered Veterans’ benefits until the summer of 1930, when 
3:84:4582:25:25:72:469:540:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:they were consolidated under a new federal agency called the Veterans’ Administration.1  
3:85:4669:25:26:90:500:515:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:We focus on a major legislative change that took effect in 2001, which generated a plausibly 
3:86:4762:26:25:72:536:489:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:exogenous increase in the generosity of disability benefits for one group of Vietnam Era veterans but not 
3:87:4867:25:25:72:522:464:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:another.2 Motivated by an Institute of Medicine study that linked exposure to Agent Orange and other 
3:88:4967:25:25:72:526:439:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:herbicides used by the U.S. military during the Vietnam War to the onset of type 2 diabetes, the VA in 
3:89:5068:25:26:72:507:414:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:July of 2001 expanded the medical eligibility criteria for Vietnam veterans to include diabetes as a 
3:90:5168:26:25:72:517:388:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:covered condition. This coverage expansion applied to veterans who served “in-theatre” in Vietnam, 
3:91:5266:25:25:72:524:363:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Cambodia, or Laos during the 1964 to 1975 period. It did not, however, apply to the approximately 55 
3:92:5366:25:26:72:410:338:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:percent of Vietnam era veterans who did not serve in theatre during the war. 
3:93:5441:26:25:90:533:312:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:The 2001 policy change coincided with a sharp acceleration in the number of veterans receiving DC 
3:94:5538:25:25:72:534:287:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:benefits, documented in Figure 1. Some of this overall increase was attributable to a much higher rate of 
3:95:5644:25:26:72:541:262:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:DC enrollment among veterans serving in the 1990s and 2000s than among their counterparts from earlier 
3:96:5747:26:25:72:524:236:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:service eras.3 But much of it was driven by the rise in DC enrollment among Vietnam era veterans. As 
3:97:5847:25:50:72:513:211:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:shown in Figure 2, the fraction of Vietnam era veterans receiving DC benefits had been trending up 
3:98:5946:50:13:216:219:161:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:                                                        
3:99:6001:13:17:72:341:148:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:1 This was changed to the Department of Veterans Affairs in 1989. 
3:100:6065:17:17:72:539:131:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:2 See Gruber (2000) for an analysis of a reform to the federal government’s disability program in all parts of Canada 
3:101:6182:17:12:72:335:114:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:except for Quebec that is estimated to have reduced labor supply. 
3:102:6247:12:17:72:534:102:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:3 Veterans from the Gulf War and Global War on Terror are 2-3 times more likely than veterans from WWII or the 
3:103:6357:17:11:72:530:85:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:Korean War era to receive DC benefits. Shifts in the composition of veterans (as those from older eras die and the 
3:104:6472:11:0:72:438:74:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:recent era join the ranks) have contributed to a substantial increase in total DC enrollment.  
4:105:6567:0:25:72:536:709:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:gradually prior to the 2001 policy change so that 9 percent of Vietnam-era veterans received DC benefits 
4:106:6671:25:25:72:509:684:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:in that year. But there was a significant break in that trend after 2001 so that by 2013 more than 17 
4:107:6772:25:25:72:494:659:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:percent of Vietnam era veterans were receiving DC benefits. No similar changes in rates of DC 
4:108:6866:25:26:72:337:634:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:enrollment occurred for veterans from earlier service eras.4  
4:109:6925:26:25:90:501:608:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:The policy-induced increase in DC enrollment provides an unusual opportunity to study how 
4:110:7015:25:25:72:541:583:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:disability benefits affect the labor supply of near elderly male veterans. Adopting the terminology used by 
4:111:7120:25:26:72:519:558:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:the military, we distinguish among ‘boots on the ground’ (BOG) Vietnam era veterans—the veterans 
4:112:7217:26:25:72:532:532:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:directly affected by the Agent Orange policy—with ‘not on ground’ (NOG) veterans, whose DC benefit 
4:113:7315:25:25:72:534:507:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:eligibility was not expanded. We analyze unique administrative data for a sample of more than 4 million 
4:114:7419:25:26:72:525:482:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:U.S. Army veterans to compare the evolution of labor market outcomes among BOG veterans to other 
4:115:7516:26:25:72:529:456:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Vietnam era veterans who did not serve in the Vietnam theatre during the conflict there. By using other 
4:116:7619:25:25:72:527:431:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Vietnam era veterans as our comparison group, we account for the possibility that veterans would have 
4:117:7720:25:25:72:531:406:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:retired sooner (or later) than non-veterans for reasons unrelated to the DC program. And given the large 
4:118:7825:25:26:72:527:381:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:number of years of pre-2001 data included in our research data, we can control for possible differential 
4:119:7928:26:25:72:254:355:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:trends between BOG and NOG veterans.

4:122:8156:26:25:72:532:279:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program, with early studies considering the effects on labor 
4:123:8260:25:25:72:525:254:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:force participation (Parsons, 1980; Bound, 1989; Bound and Waidmann, 1992) and subsequent studies 
4:124:8358:25:25:72:533:229:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:exploring the sensitivity of the program to economic conditions (Black et al, 2002) and the labor market 
4:125:8463:25:26:72:530:204:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:effects of changes in the program’s medical eligibility criteria and in effective replacement rates (Autor 
4:126:8570:26:28:72:530:178:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:and Duggan, 2003).6 One challenge for this research is that, because SSDI is a federal program, there is 
4:127:8673:28:13:216:219:150:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:                                                        
4:128:8728:13:18:72:485:137:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:4 See Duggan, Rosenheck, and Singleton (2010) for a comparison to veterans from earlier service eras. 
4:129:8828:18:17:72:374:119:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:5 See for example the Handbook chapter by Bound and Burkhauser (1999). 
4:130:8897:17:17:72:518:102:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:6 The labor supply consequences of the federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program are rarely studied 
4:131:9005:17:11:72:518:85:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:because SSI largely serves individuals with extremely limited prior work histories (those with significant work 
4:132:9117:11:0:72:223:74:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:histories normally qualify for SSDI).  
5:133:9156:0:25:72:531:709:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:no natural comparison group against which to estimate the effects of the program. To address this issue, 
5:134:9259:25:25:72:535:684:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:more recent research has estimated the effect of SSDI on the labor supply of applicants and beneficiaries 
5:135:9365:25:25:72:541:659:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:by using variation in the propensity to award disability benefits across disability examiners (Maestas et al,

5:137:9578:26:25:72:534:608:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:studies, which utilize large-scale administrative data sets on both SSDI enrollment and earnings, suggest 
5:138:9684:25:25:72:514:583:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:that labor force participation among marginal applicants—that is, those who would receive an SSDI 
5:139:9782:25:26:72:530:558:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:award from a lenient judge or examiner but not from a stricter one—declines by about thirty percentage

5:141:9931:25:25:90:541:507:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:There has been much less research on the VA’s Disability Compensation program. Autor and Duggan 
5:142:10027:25:26:72:530:482:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:(2007), Autor et al (2011), and Coile et al (2015) use data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) to 
5:143:10127:26:25:72:527:456:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:explore how labor force participation changed for male Vietnam-era veterans relative to similarly aged 
5:144:10230:25:25:72:511:431:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:non-veteran males after the 2001 policy change. All three studies demonstrate a significantly larger 
5:145:10330:25:25:72:520:406:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:decline in labor force participation among Vietnam-era veterans in the post-2001 period, though their 
5:146:10431:25:26:72:540:381:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:confidence intervals are compatible with a wide range of effect sizes. A concern with this body of work is 
5:147:10537:26:25:72:530:355:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:that veterans might retire sooner than non-veterans for reasons unrelated to the DC program.8 Using the 
5:148:10640:25:25:72:542:330:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Vietnam-era draft lottery as an instrumental variable for Vietnam-era military service, Angrist et al (2010) 
5:149:10749:25:26:72:533:305:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:estimate that employment was lower and transfer income receipt was higher among low skilled veterans 
5:150:10849:26:25:72:531:279:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:than among low-skilled non-veterans. They hypothesize that the lower employment rate of Vietnam-era 
5:151:10949:25:25:72:526:254:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:veterans is due to the availability of Veterans Disability Compensation benefits. In related work on the 
5:152:11053:25:28:72:531:229:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:labor supply of veterans, Boyle and Lahey (2010) study the expansion of the Veterans Health Insurance

5:154:11210:13:16:72:521:188:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:7 Using an approach similar to Bound (1989), Chen and van der Klauuw (2008) estimate even smaller effects of 
5:155:11318:16:12:72:518:172:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:SSDI enrollment, with an upper bound of a 20 percent reduction in labor force participation. Results from Von 
5:156:11428:12:11:72:530:160:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:Wachter et al (2011) suggest labor supply effects may be larger for younger SSDI recipients. While SSDI reduces 
5:157:11539:11:12:72:514:149:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:the incentive to work among recipients, the results of a recent policy change in Norway suggest that disability 
5:158:11651:12:12:72:513:137:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:insurance recipients are responsive to changes in the magnitude of this incentive (Kostøl and Mogstad, 2014). 
5:159:11759:12:17:72:514:125:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:8 Duggan et al (2010) use five years of data (odd-numbered years between 1997 and 2005) from the Veterans’

5:161:11972:11:12:72:519:97:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:theatre and other Vietnam era veterans. Given the small sample size, their estimates are very imprecise, as their 
5:162:12086:12:11:72:526:85:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:confidence interval includes the full range of possible effect sizes (zero effect or a one-for-one reduction in labor 
5:163:12204:11:0:72:153:74:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:force participation). 
6:164:12226:0:25:72:505:709:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:program to non-disabled veterans in the mid-1990s to analyze changes in labor force participation 
6:165:12324:25:25:72:374:684:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:stemming from increased real incomes and reductions in “job lock.” 
6:166:12389:25:25:90:519:659:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Using individual-level data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, we document that DC 
6:167:12483:25:26:72:536:634:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:receipt and enrollment growth were higher among BOG than NOG veterans prior to 2001, but these gaps 
6:168:12582:26:25:72:528:608:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:were relatively stable. After 2001, however, the rate of DC enrollment grew much more rapidly among 
6:169:12681:25:25:72:510:583:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:BOG veterans, as shown in Figure 3. Between 2000 and 2006, the ratio of DC receipt among BOG 
6:170:12774:25:26:72:529:558:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:relative to NOG veterans rose from approximately two-to-one to three-to-one: almost one-in-four BOG 
6:171:12872:26:25:72:539:532:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:veterans in our analysis sample received DC benefits in 2006 versus one-in-twelve among veterans in our 
6:172:12975:25:25:72:539:507:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:NOG sample. This trend break was driven primarily by a sharp increase in the number of diabetes awards 
6:173:13078:25:26:72:539:482:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:to BOG veterans as shown in Figure 4. DC enrollment growth among BOG veterans shows essentially no 
6:174:13176:26:25:72:538:456:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:break in trend when one excludes DC recipients with a diabetes diagnosis (Figure 5). Using matched data 
6:175:13277:25:25:72:522:431:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:from the Social Security Administration, we also document a differential increase in SSDI enrollment 
6:176:13375:25:25:72:534:406:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:after 2001 among BOG veterans. A plausible channel for this effect, which is about one-tenth as large as 
6:177:13477:25:26:72:531:381:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:the corresponding change in DC enrollment, is that receipt of veterans disability benefits eases financial 
6:178:13583:26:25:72:532:355:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:constraints associated with exiting the labor force and applying for SSDI benefits. Moreover, since SSA 
6:179:13682:25:25:72:533:330:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:regulations require disability adjudicators to consider disability decisions of other federal agencies (U.S. 
6:180:13790:25:26:72:535:305:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:General Accounting Office, 2009), a veteran’s enrollment in DC may also increase the likelihood that he 
6:181:13892:26:25:72:412:279:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:or she applies for and ultimately receives Social Security disability benefits.  
6:182:13968:25:25:90:509:254:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:By generating a sharp differential increase in DC enrollment among BOG veterans for reasons 
6:183:14060:25:25:72:530:229:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:unrelated to changing health, the Agent Orange policy change permits causal estimation of the effect of 
6:184:14164:25:26:72:525:204:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:DC program participation on the labor supply of near-elderly Vietnam veterans. Analyzing this policy-
6:185:14265:26:25:72:528:178:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:induced variation, we find that labor force participation, defined as having strictly positive earnings for 
6:186:14372:25:25:72:537:153:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:the year in our administrative data, declined sharply among BOG relative to NOG veterans soon after the 
6:187:14474:25:26:72:543:128:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:2001 policy change. The results are similar for younger (born 1949-51) and older (born 1946-48) Vietnam 
6:188:14578:26:25:72:528:102:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:veterans in our analysis sample, suggesting that this pattern reflects an effect of the policy rather than a 
6:189:14685:25:0:72:530:77:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:tendency of BOG veterans to retire sooner than their NOG counterparts for reasons unrelated to the DC 
7:190:14788:0:25:72:518:709:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:program. For every 100 individuals who entered the DC program as a result of the policy change, we 
7:191:14885:25:25:72:529:684:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:estimate that 18 drop out of the labor force. The magnitude of this decline reflects in part the size of the 
7:192:14992:25:25:72:524:659:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:cash transfers that DC beneficiaries receive. Among veterans who entered the DC program after 2001, 
7:193:15090:25:26:72:525:634:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:annual benefits averaged $10K in the first year of enrollment and $17K in the fifth year of enrollment. 
7:194:15194:26:25:72:514:608:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Since DC benefits are not subject to state or federal taxation, their after tax value is 30 to 40 percent 
7:195:15297:25:25:72:532:583:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:greater than nominally equivalent labor income. Indeed, the increase in disability benefit income among 
7:196:15399:25:26:72:521:558:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:BOG veterans more than offset (on average) their reduction in earnings among BOG veterans, so that 
7:197:15497:26:25:72:396:532:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:total incomes of BOG relative to NOG veterans rose steadily after 2001.  
7:198:15566:25:25:90:531:507:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Combining our labor force participation and benefit receipt estimates, we obtain a non-participation 
7:199:15666:25:26:72:532:482:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:elasticity of 0.50. This estimate is larger than the figure of 0.16 reported by Coile and Gruber (2007) for 
7:200:15772:26:25:72:516:456:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:the elasticity of retirement of near-elderly adults with respect to Social Security and other retirement 
7:201:15877:25:25:72:522:431:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:wealth.9 Our estimates are highly consistent with the participation elasticities calculated by Boyle and 
7:202:15977:25:25:72:539:406:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Lahey (2010), however, who studied labor supply of older non-disabled veterans ages 55 through 64 who 
7:203:16074:25:26:72:350:381:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:were granted access to VA health insurance in the mid-1990s.  
7:204:16135:26:25:90:511:355:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Distinct from the SSDI program, which provides income replacement for beneficiaries who are 
7:205:16225:25:25:72:536:330:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:unable to work due to disability, DC benefits are awarded as compensation for service-related reductions 
7:206:16330:25:26:72:522:305:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:in health and thus, for the most part, are not contingent on veterans’ past or present employment. This 
7:207:16432:26:25:72:506:279:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:observation would suggest that any DC-induced reduction in labor supply that we detect would be 
7:208:16527:25:25:72:520:254:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:attributable to a non-incentive income effect. However, nearly 14 percent of BOG veterans who were 
7:209:16625:25:25:72:532:229:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:receiving DC by the end of our sample window were receiving maximum DC benefits of approximately 
7:210:16721:25:26:72:528:204:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:$2,900 monthly because they were deemed unable to work (‘Individually Unemployable’ or IU) due to 
7:211:16818:26:25:72:539:178:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:their disability. For veterans receiving the IU benefit and those seeking it, the labor supply effects that we 
7:212:16928:25:39:72:374:153:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:estimate are likely to encompass both income and incentive effects.  
7:213:16996:39:12:216:219:114:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:                                                        
7:214:17051:12:17:72:542:102:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:9 A venerable literature estimates labor supply elasticites, including Frisch (1959), Ashenfelter and Heckman (1974), 
7:215:17168:17:11:72:542:85:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:Abbott and Ashenfelter (1976), and Chetty (2012) among many key contributions. Very few studies estimate income 
7:216:17280:11:0:72:438:74:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:elasticites of participation, however. McClelland and Mok (2012) provide a recent review.  
8:217:17371:0:25:90:532:709:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:The labor supply effects that we document acquire added significance in light of the rapid growth in 
8:218:17468:25:25:72:502:684:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Disability Compensation enrollment, with annual benefit payments of $49.2 billion in 2013 (U.S. 
8:219:17559:25:25:72:506:659:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Veterans Benefits Administration, 2014). Today’s veterans are substantially more likely than U.S. 
8:220:17657:25:26:72:535:634:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:veterans of earlier cohorts to obtain DC benefits; indeed, veterans who have exited military service since 
8:221:17761:26:25:72:537:608:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:2001 are more than three times as likely as were Vietnam era veterans to receive disability compensation 
8:222:17864:25:25:72:537:583:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:benefits soon after the completion of service. This cross-cohort contrast suggests that Veterans Disability 
8:223:17970:25:26:72:520:558:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Compensation program costs may rise substantially beyond what would be predicted based on earlier 
8:224:18067:26:25:72:413:532:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:generations of veterans, a concern highlighted by Bilmes and Stiglitz (2008). 
8:225:18142:25:25:97:518:507:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:The analysis proceeds as follows. Section I discusses the financial and labor force participation 
8:226:18240:25:26:72:540:482:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:incentives created by the Veterans Disability Compensation program. Section II describes the 2001 Agent 
8:227:18344:26:25:72:530:456:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Orange decision that made type 2 diabetes a service-connected disability for veterans who served in the 
8:228:18447:25:25:72:527:431:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Vietnam theatre. Section III details the construction of our data, which we use in Section IV to analyze 
8:229:18552:25:25:72:511:406:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:the impact of the Agent Orange decision on veterans’ enrollment in DC and their receipt of transfer 
8:230:18650:25:26:72:519:381:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:income from DC and two other federal disability programs, SSDI and Supplemental Security Income 
8:231:18746:26:25:72:540:355:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:(SSI). Section V presents reduced form estimates of the impact of the Agent Orange policy on labor force 
8:232:18851:25:25:72:503:330:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:participation and total labor earnings. Section VI combines these margins to provide instrumental 
8:233:18949:25:26:72:531:305:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:variables estimates of the impact of DC enrollment and total disability benefits payments on labor force

8:237:19345:25:25:90:538:185:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:The DC program pays cash benefits and provides prioritized access to VA health facilities to military 
8:238:19445:25:26:72:534:160:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:veterans with service-connected medical conditions, meaning that they are caused or aggravated by their 
8:239:19549:26:25:72:539:134:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:military service. Unlike SSDI and SSI, federal programs that classify disability using a categorical (all-or-
8:240:19655:25:25:72:541:109:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:nothing) determination, the DC program rates disability on a discrete scale with eleven gradations ranging 
8:241:19760:25:0:72:506:84:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:from zero to 100 percent in ten percent increments. Ratings depend on the type and severity of the 
9:242:19857:0:25:72:521:709:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:disability, with more severe conditions receiving a higher rating.10 If the recipient receives ratings for 
9:243:19963:25:25:72:541:684:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:multiple disabilities, the recipient’s Combined Disability Rating (CDR) is an increasing, concave function 
9:244:20070:25:32:72:527:659:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:of the individual ratings, where concavity prevents the combined rating from exceeding 100 percent.11  
9:245:20171:32:24:72:193:627:117:Times:117:Times:A.  Eligibility and benefits 
9:246:20199:24:26:90:482:603:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Veterans seeking DC benefits apply to one of 56 regional offices of the Veterans Benefit 
9:247:20286:26:25:72:526:577:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Administration (VBA), which collects necessary information and forwards the information to a Rating 
9:248:20385:25:25:72:506:552:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Board. For each disability claimed, the Rating Board determines whether the disability is verified, 
9:249:20483:25:26:72:537:527:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:whether it is service connected, and if so, what rating it merits. During the 2000 fiscal year, more than 70 
9:250:20589:26:25:72:520:501:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:percent of those applying for DC sought benefits for more than one medical condition (U.S. Veterans 
9:251:20687:25:25:72:523:476:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Benefits Administration, 2001). Applicants face one of three possible outcomes: outright rejection, an 
9:252:20787:25:25:72:527:451:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:award for some but not all conditions, or an award for all conditions. In 2006, current DC beneficiaries 
9:253:20891:25:26:72:542:426:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:averaged 2.97 disabilities per recipient, with the highest number of disabilities per capita among Gulf War 
9:254:20999:26:25:72:504:400:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:and Vietnam Era veterans, and the lowest number among WWII veterans (U.S. Veterans Benefits 
9:255:21090:25:25:72:175:375:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Administration, 2007). 
9:256:21112:25:26:90:521:350:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Monthly benefits awarded by DC are an increasing and convex function of the veteran’s CDR. In 
9:257:21206:26:25:72:531:324:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:2014, a 10 percent award provided a monthly payment of $131 whereas a 100 percent award provided a 
9:258:21304:25:46:72:532:299:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:monthly payment of $2,858.12 Veterans receiving a CDR of 30 percent or higher and who have spouses,

9:260:21458:13:16:72:535:240:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:10 The range of possible ratings differs among disabilities. For example, type 2 diabetes can have a rating of 10, 20, 
9:261:21576:16:12:72:534:224:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:40, 60, or 100 percent. Arthritis can be assigned a rating of 10 or 20 percent. For a list of conditions and ratings see 
9:262:21697:12:11:72:537:212:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:http://www.warms.vba.va.gov/bookc.html. A disability with a 0 percent rating would not increase the monthly cash 
9:263:21810:11:13:72:502:201:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:benefit but would entitle the veteran to priority for health care through the Veterans Health Administration. 
9:264:21919:13:16:72:525:188:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:11 If a claimant has multiple disabilities, only the claimant's ‘residual ability’ is considered when determining the 
9:265:22036:16:12:72:538:172:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:effect of each additional disability on the CDR. For example, if a veteran has two disabilities rated at 50%, his CDR 
9:266:22154:12:11:72:534:160:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:would be he equal to the sum of 50% for the first disability and 50% of his residual capacity of 50% for the second 
9:267:22270:11:12:72:542:149:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:disability, all rounded to the nearest increment of 10%. Thus, two disabilities rated at 50% results in a CDR of [0.5 + 
9:268:22390:12:12:72:303:137:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:(1 – 0.5) * 0.5] = 0.75, which is then rounded up to 0.80.  
9:269:22447:12:17:72:539:125:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:12 The stated policy of the VBA that the DC benefits schedule reflects the average reduction in earnings capacity for 
9:270:22564:17:11:72:521:108:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:each value of the CDR. Since benefits determination depends only on CDR and family status, it is clear that the 
9:271:22676:11:12:72:540:97:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:benefit payment will exceed the earnings loss for some veterans and fail to meet the earnings loss of others. In 2014, 
9:272:22795:12:11:72:516:85:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:the monthly benefit schedule (by CDR) was: $131 (10%), $259 (20%), $401 (30%), $578 (40%), $822 (50%), 
9:273:22898:11:0:72:393:74:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:$1,041 (60%), $1,312 (70%), $1,526 (80%), $1,714 (90%), and $2,858 (100%). 
10:274:22973:0:25:72:539:709:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:dependent children, or surviving parents also receive modest additional benefits. The VBA also considers 
10:275:23078:25:25:72:538:684:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:employment capability for veterans with severe disabilities. Veterans who have single disabilities rated at 
10:276:23185:25:25:72:530:659:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:60 percent or above or a combined disability rating of at least 70 and one disability rated at least 40 can 
10:277:23291:25:26:72:541:634:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:qualify for the Individual Unemployability (IU) designation if VBA determines that they are unable to “to 
10:278:23394:26:25:72:536:608:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disability.” Veterans 
10:279:23500:25:25:72:536:583:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:receiving the IU designation are provided cash payments at the 100 percent CDR level even if their CDR 
10:280:23601:25:26:72:183:558:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:is less than 100 percent.  
10:281:23627:26:25:90:522:532:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Veterans Disability Compensation benefits typically have longer award durations and fewer work 
10:282:23721:25:25:72:522:507:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:restrictions than other federal disability benefits. DC benefits are also not subject to federal income or 
10:283:23828:25:26:72:507:482:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:payroll tax; hence, a dollar in DC income is roughly equivalent to $1.30 to $1.50 in pre-tax earned 
10:284:23928:26:25:72:537:456:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:income, depending upon the recipient’s marginal tax rate. DC benefits generally do not offset and are not 
10:285:24033:25:25:72:525:431:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:offset by other federal transfer benefits, and, once awarded, are rarely retracted.13 Unlike federal SSDI 
10:286:24137:25:25:72:507:406:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:benefits, DC benefits do not terminate when a recipient reaches retirement age, even for recipients 
10:287:24236:25:26:72:539:381:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:receiving the IU benefit. Moreover, a veteran’s ongoing receipt of DC benefits is neither work-contingent 
10:288:24339:26:25:72:517:355:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:nor income-contingent, except for veterans who have received the IU rating.14 Thus, DC benefits are 
10:289:24437:25:25:72:517:330:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:roughly akin to an inflation-indexed annuity that provides monthly payments for as long as a veteran 
10:290:24537:25:26:72:139:305:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:remains alive.  
10:291:24552:26:25:90:536:279:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Appendix Table 1 summarizes DC cash benefits paid in fiscal year 2006, the final year for which we 
10:292:24650:25:25:72:515:254:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:have individual-level DC data in the analyses below. The first three columns enumerate the count of 
10:293:24748:25:25:72:537:229:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:recipients, the total dollars paid, and the average annual benefit in each CDR category at the end of fiscal 
10:294:24856:25:49:72:525:204:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:year 2006. The average annual payment to the 2.73 million DC recipients in this year was $10,862 per 
10:295:24955:49:13:216:219:155:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:                                                        
10:296:25010:13:16:72:515:142:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:13 A Veteran may receive both DC and SSDI payments without any reduction in benefits from either program, 
10:297:25114:16:13:72:393:126:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:though SSI payments will generally be reduced or eliminated by DC payments.  
10:298:25190:13:16:72:530:113:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:14 A veteran can lose the IU rating if his annual labor market earnings (measured by SSA earnings data) exceeds a 
10:299:25303:16:12:72:526:97:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:threshold amount, which was equal to $6,000 in 2004 and 2005. The General Accounting Office notes, however, 
10:300:25411:12:11:72:516:85:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:that “this process relies on old data, outdated and time-consuming procedures, insufficient guidance, and weak 
10:301:25521:11:0:72:231:74:97:g_d0_f1:97:Times:eligibility criteria” (GAO 2006, p. 23).  
11:302:25563:0:25:72:533:709:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:capita, totaling approximately $29.6 billion for the year. Veterans with ratings between 0 and 20 percent 
11:303:25669:25:25:72:533:684:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:accounted for 44 percent of recipients but just 8 percent of dollars paid. Those with ratings at 70 percent 
11:304:25777:25:25:72:516:659:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:or above comprised 21 percent of the population and received 62 percent of the benefits payments.15 
11:305:25876:25:26:90:513:634:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Total DC benefits payments rose from $20.8 billion to $49.1 billion between 2001 and 2013 (in 
11:306:25968:26:25:72:527:608:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:constant 2013 dollars). Simultaneously, the estimated veteran population declined from 26.1 million to 
11:307:26069:25:25:72:536:583:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:22.1 million (VBA, 2002 and 2014). As a result of these changes, real annual DC expenditures per living 
11:308:26171:25:32:72:325:558:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:veteran increased by 180 percent (from $798 to $2,234).  
11:309:26226:32:25:72:210:526:117:Times:117:Times:B.  Work Incentives under DC 
11:310:26254:25:25:90:526:501:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:The graduated scale of DC disability ratings creates a complex set of incentives. Though disability 
11:311:26353:25:25:72:542:476:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:ratings for DC recipients notionally depend exclusively on medical criteria rather than employment status, 
11:312:26460:25:25:72:505:451:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:veterans may nevertheless perceive that their disabilities will receive higher ratings if they are not 
11:313:26563:25:26:72:517:426:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:employed when applying to obtain or increase benefits. Veterans also face an incentive to repeatedly 
11:314:26663:26:25:72:513:400:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:reapply to increase their Combined Disability Ratings—and therefore their benefits—as their health 
11:315:26762:25:25:72:537:375:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:conditions evolve.16 One consequence is that veterans’ CDRs and benefit levels tend to rise steeply in the 
11:316:26867:25:26:72:528:350:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:years following enrollment, as shown in panels A and B of Table 1.17 This pattern of rapidly escalating 
11:317:26970:26:25:72:525:324:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:benefits following enrollment suggests that policies that induce veterans to obtain an initial DC award, 
11:318:27074:25:25:72:520:299:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:even at a low CDR, may lead to substantially larger claims over the longer term and discourage labor 
11:319:27174:25:26:72:158:274:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:force participation. 
11:320:27194:26:25:90:535:248:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:The availability of the Individual IU designation is likely to amplify these incentives. The IU benefit 
11:321:27297:25:27:72:532:223:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:has significant monetary value: a 2006 General Accounting Office report found that the average present 
11:322:27398:27:14:216:219:196:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:                                                        
11:323:27453:14:16:72:510:182:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:15 The average monthly benefit amounts for those with ratings between 0 and 20 percent are very close to the 
11:324:27561:16:11:72:531:166:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:baseline amounts because veterans with these ratings are not eligible for dependent benefits. The average amounts 
11:325:27675:11:12:72:538:155:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:paid for those rated 60 percent and higher are substantially greater than the baseline amounts because many of these 
11:326:27792:12:12:72:479:143:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:recipients are eligible for the 100 percent payment amount because they are receiving the IU benefit.  
11:327:27893:12:17:72:522:131:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:16 In fact, we observe very few reductions in CDRs in our data, and it is possible that those few that exist reflect 
11:328:28009:17:12:72:440:114:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:coding errors. Veterans face little risk of having their CDRs reduced after the initial award.  
11:329:28104:12:17:72:523:102:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:17 We describe the sample used to construct Table 1 in Section III below. Although our data codes DC receipt in 
11:330:28215:17:11:72:531:85:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:each year from 1998 through 2006, we can only determine what year DC was awarded if a veteran is observed not 
11:331:28324:11:0:72:521:74:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:receiving DC in a prior year. We can thus identify DC enrollment cohorts from 1999 forward, but not for 1998.  
12:332:28436:0:25:72:542:709:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:discounted incremental value of receiving an IU award in 2005 was approximately $300 to $460 thousand 
12:333:28538:25:25:72:520:684:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:for veterans age 20 (net of existing benefits), and was $89 to $142 thousand for veterans age 75 (U.S. 
12:334:28640:25:25:72:511:659:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:GAO, 2006).18 The availability of this benefit appears likely to induce at least some subset of work-
12:335:28740:25:26:72:509:634:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:capable veterans to curtail labor force participation to qualify. Once the IU designation is awarded, 
12:336:28842:26:25:72:542:608:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:veterans face an incentive to maintain low earnings since the benefit is technically only available for those 
12:337:28950:25:25:72:518:583:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:with labor market earnings at or below the poverty level for a single individual (U.S. GAO, 2006).19  
12:338:29050:25:26:90:528:558:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:The DC program may also alter work incentives through its interactions with other federal benefits 
12:339:29144:26:25:72:512:532:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:programs, SSDI in particular. Though the DC and SSDI programs have distinct disability screening 
12:340:29238:25:25:72:519:507:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:criteria, the medical information generated by the DC award may alert some veterans that they suffer 
12:341:29339:25:26:72:520:482:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:from impairments that could merit an SSDI award (and vice versa).  Receipt of DC benefits may also 
12:342:29437:26:25:72:527:456:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:render the SSDI application process less financially onerous, since SSDI applicants must remain out of 
12:343:29540:25:25:72:524:431:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:the labor force for at least five months before receiving SSDI benefits. Because cash benefits from the 
12:344:29641:25:25:72:521:406:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:two programs are additive rather than offsetting, it is plausible that a veteran’s receipt of either DC or 
12:345:29747:25:45:72:344:381:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:SSDI benefits increases his odds of applying for the other.20   
12:346:29807:45:25:72:473:336:144:Times:117:Times:II.  The 2001 Agent Orange Decision, Type 2 Diabetes and ‘Service-Connectedness’ 
12:347:29886:25:25:90:537:311:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:For a disability to be classified as service-connected, it must be “a result of disease or injury incurred 
12:348:29990:25:25:72:516:286:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:or aggravated during active military service.” This criterion makes it straightforward for a veteran to 
12:349:30092:25:31:72:509:261:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:obtain compensation for a tangible injury that occurs during military service but significantly more 
12:350:30190:31:13:216:219:230:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:                                                        
12:351:30245:13:16:72:532:217:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:18 Among veterans in our sample who received benefits at the 100 percent disability level in 2006, about half were 
12:352:30359:16:12:72:527:201:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:designated as IU. We henceforth do not distinguish between the IU benefit and 100 percent disability since many 
12:353:30471:12:13:72:515:189:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:DC recipients with 100 percent disability may have previously qualified for the IU benefit with a lower CDR.  
12:354:30580:13:16:72:540:176:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:19 The fact that only veterans with severe disabilities (a CDR of 60 or higher) are eligible for the IU benefit might be 
12:355:30700:16:11:72:524:160:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:expected to deter all but the most disabled veterans. But the data in Table 1 indicate that very high CDRs are not 
12:356:30815:11:12:72:539:149:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:uncommon, even for veterans that initially enter with low or moderate CDRs. Among veterans awarded DC benefits 
12:357:30926:12:11:72:533:137:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:in 1999, only 15 percent qualified for either the IU benefit or 100 percent disability (panel C). Seven years later, in 
12:358:31046:11:12:72:535:126:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:2006, three times that number (45 percent) of the 1999 DC enrollment cohort was either receiving the IU benefit or 
12:359:31161:12:12:72:177:114:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:was 100 percent disabled. 
12:360:31186:12:17:72:536:102:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:20 The combination of VA health benefits and Medicare benefits from SSDI may also be more attractive than either 
12:361:31297:17:11:72:535:85:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:individually since VA and Medicare differ in ailments covered, rapidity of access to treatment, size of co-pays, and 
12:362:31412:11:0:72:198:74:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:coverage of prescription drugs. 
13:363:31445:0:25:72:528:709:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:difficult to obtain compensation for a disease that develops later in life, such as cancer or heart disease. 
13:364:31553:25:25:72:507:684:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Thus in 2006, the five most prevalent service-connected disabilities were primarily battle traumas: 
13:365:31652:25:25:72:509:659:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:hearing defects, tinnitus, general musculoskeletal disorders, arthritis due to trauma, and scars (U.S. 
13:366:31754:25:26:72:539:634:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Veterans Benefits Administration, 2006). Nevertheless, disabilities that typically develop post-service are 
13:367:31862:26:25:72:513:608:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:also prevalent: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and hypertensive vascular disease (high blood 
13:368:31959:25:25:72:465:583:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:pressure) were the sixth and ninth most prevalent service-connected disabilities in 2006.  
13:369:32047:25:26:90:507:558:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:In November of 2000, type 2 diabetes was added to the list of compensable and presumptively 
13:370:32139:26:25:72:517:532:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:service-connected impairments for Vietnam veterans who had served in theatre due to their potential 
13:371:32239:25:25:72:520:507:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:exposure to the herbicide Agent Orange. This policy change substantially weakened the link between 
13:372:32338:25:26:72:529:482:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:service-connectedness and DC benefits for eligible veterans. The Agent Orange policy was years in the 
13:373:32437:26:25:72:521:456:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:making. The U.S. military applied more than 19 million gallons of herbicides to defoliate Vietnamese 
13:374:32538:25:25:72:500:431:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:jungle areas between 1962 and 1971, a quantity of defoliant sufficient to cover 8.5 percent of the 
13:375:32637:25:25:72:524:406:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:country’s land area (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2003).21 After the war ended, concern grew 
13:376:32736:25:26:72:503:381:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:among veterans that their exposure to the dioxins in Agent Orange would have long-term adverse 
13:377:32827:26:25:72:536:355:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:consequences. The VA responded by establishing the Agent Orange Registry in 1978. In 1991, Congress 
13:378:32927:25:25:72:531:330:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:enacted the Agent Orange Act, which charged the National Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Medicine 
13:379:33027:25:26:72:517:305:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:(IOM) with reviewing the evidence for a link between Agent Orange exposure and the prevalence of 
13:380:33123:26:25:72:196:279:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:certain medical conditions.  
13:381:33150:25:25:90:536:254:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:In a series of reports, the IOM found insufficient evidence to establish an association between dioxin 
13:382:33252:25:25:72:539:229:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:exposure and diabetes. But the publication of two new studies in 1999 and 2000 that found an association 
13:383:33353:25:26:72:536:204:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:between dioxin exposure and diabetes turned the tide against this longstanding consensus (Calvert et. al., 
13:384:33460:26:25:72:481:178:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:1999; Air Force Health Study, 2000). In October of 2000, the IOM concluded that there was 
13:385:33550:25:61:72:538:153:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:“limited/suggestive evidence of an association between exposure to the herbicides used in Vietnam or the

13:387:33710:14:0:72:459:78:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:21 Agent Orange accounted for more than 80 percent of the total amount of herbicide dispensed.

14:389:33906:25:25:72:429:684:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Affairs’ decision to classify type 2 diabetes as presumptively service connected.  
14:390:33986:25:25:90:530:659:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:The VA’s adoption of the Agent Orange policy offers an unusual opportunity: almost three decades 
14:391:34082:25:26:72:537:634:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:after the end of the Vietnam War, veterans who served in theatre were unexpectedly granted presumptive 
14:392:34185:26:25:72:530:608:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:eligibility for financially significant Disability Compensation benefits without a precipitating change in 
14:393:34292:25:25:72:517:583:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:health. This paper exploits the contrast in expanded benefits eligibility between in-theatre and not-in-
14:394:34393:25:26:72:531:558:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:theatre veterans—whom we refer to as ‘boots on ground’ (BOG) and ‘not on ground’ (NOG) veterans—
14:395:34488:26:44:72:358:532:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:to study the impact of benefits receipt on veterans’ labor supply. 
14:396:34554:44:25:72:223:488:144:Times:117:Times:III.  Data and Analytic Sample 
14:397:34583:25:25:90:538:463:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Our research draws on a unique set of linked administrative data sources. The first is a near census of 
14:398:34685:25:25:72:536:438:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:approximately four million veterans who left the Army between 1968 and 1985. The U.S. Army’s Office 
14:399:34784:25:26:72:541:413:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:of Economic and Manpower Analysis (OEMA) constructed this database by combining two files from the 
14:400:34883:26:25:72:535:387:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC): the first DMDC file enumerates essentially every person who 
14:401:34979:25:25:72:518:362:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:left the Army between 1968 and 1985 (designated as the service member’s “loss year”); OEMA then 
14:402:35074:25:26:72:523:337:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:merged this “loss year” file with DMDC’s Vietnam file, which identifies the vast majority of veterans 
14:403:35175:26:25:72:528:311:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:who served in the Vietnam theatre.23 Approximately 36 percent of this sample served with boots on the 
14:404:35276:25:25:72:533:286:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:ground in Vietnam, Cambodia, or Laos during the Vietnam War era, and is therefore potentially directly 
14:405:35379:25:26:72:535:261:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:affected by the 2001 expansion of the DC program’s medical eligibility criteria. More than 35 percent of 
14:406:35483:26:28:72:524:235:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:the NOG sample had a start year of 1976 or later and thus did not serve during the Vietnam War era.24 
14:407:35584:28:13:216:219:207:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:                                                        
14:408:35639:13:16:72:530:194:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:22 The same 2000 report by the National Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Medicine explained that any increased 
14:409:35749:16:12:72:528:178:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:risk of Type 2 diabetes due to Agent Orange appeared to be small and that family history, physical inactivity, and 
14:410:35864:12:13:72:315:166:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:obesity were far greater predictors of diabetes (IOM, 2000).  
14:411:35925:13:16:72:522:153:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:23 The file does not include the comparatively small number of Army service members who died during service. 
14:412:36033:16:12:72:485:137:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:U.S. government archives record 38,224 Army service members who were killed in action in Vietnam. 
14:413:36129:12:17:72:539:125:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:24 Veterans who were in the “loss year” file and the Vietnam file are in the BOG sample while veterans who were in 
14:414:36243:17:11:72:513:108:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:the “loss year” file but not the Vietnam file are part of the NOG sample. The Vietnam file contained loss year 
14:415:36354:11:12:72:540:97:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:information for approximately 25 percent of veterans, which explains why a small fraction of the BOG sample has a 
14:416:36468:12:11:72:541:85:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:loss year before 1968 or after 1985. Our final analysis sample, described below, excludes all veterans with loss years 
14:417:36587:11:0:72:529:74:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:before 1968 or after 1985, but does contain a few veterans who were in the Vietnam file but not in the “loss year” 
15:418:36704:0:25:72:528:709:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Appendix Table 2 and Table 2 show summary statistics on the distribution of loss years, years-of-birth, 
15:419:36806:25:25:72:228:684:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:and start years for military service. 
15:420:36842:25:25:90:533:659:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:We use three additional data sources to measure mortality, employment, and disability outcomes for 
15:421:36940:25:26:72:542:634:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Vietnam era veterans. To measure DC participation, OEMA obtained from VA detailed information about 
15:422:37039:26:25:72:533:608:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:veterans’ enrollment and DC benefits received from VA programs in September of each year from 1998 
15:423:37138:25:25:72:531:583:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:through 2006. To account for mortality, OEMA merged their data to the Social Security Administration 
15:424:37239:25:26:72:522:558:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Death Master File (DMF), which includes the year of death for any individual in the sample who died 
15:425:37339:26:25:72:518:532:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:prior to 2008. According to DMF data, approximately 13 percent of the 4.1 million individuals in the 
15:426:37438:25:25:72:235:507:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:sample were deceased by late 2007.  
15:427:37473:25:26:90:539:482:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:To collect employment, earnings, SSDI, and SSI information, OEMA contracted with the U.S. Social 
15:428:37569:26:25:72:534:456:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Security Administration (SSA) to match veterans in the OEMA data set to enumerate wage earnings and 
15:429:37667:25:25:72:527:431:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Social Security benefits in each year from 1976 through 2007.25 This resulted in a successful match for 
15:430:37769:25:25:72:534:406:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:3.8 of the 4.1 million veterans in the full data set, with overall match rates exceeding 90 percent for both 
15:431:37874:25:26:72:331:381:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:BOG and NOG samples, as detailed in Appendix Table 3.  
15:432:37927:26:25:90:531:355:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Confidentiality rules prevent SSA from disclosing individual earnings or benefits data. SSA instead 
15:433:38027:25:25:72:517:330:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:provided statistics on earnings and benefits for cells containing five to nine veterans. These statistics 
15:434:38132:25:26:72:537:305:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:include the number of cell members with zero earnings, mean labor earnings, the number receiving SSDI 
15:435:38233:26:25:72:520:279:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:and SSI, and mean SSDI and SSI benefit amounts. In constructing cells, we grouped individuals with 
15:436:38331:25:25:72:532:254:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:similar background characteristics, including gender, race, BOG and NOG status, and year of birth. Our 
15:437:38432:25:25:72:538:229:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:final analysis sample consists of veterans who joined the military between 1966 and 1971, and were born 
15:438:38536:25:26:72:538:204:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:between 1946 and 1951 (see Table 2). See the data appendix for more details on the cell construction and 
15:439:38640:26:25:72:150:178:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:sample selection. 
15:440:38657:25:39:90:526:153:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Panel A of Table 3 compares the BOG and NOG samples. The fraction nonwhite is approximately 
15:441:38745:39:11:216:219:114:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:                                                        
15:442:38800:11:12:72:543:103:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:file. This group comprises only 1.25 percent of our final sample and our results are nearly identical when we exclude 
15:443:38918:12:13:72:171:91:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:them from our analysis.  
15:444:38941:13:0:72:536:78:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:25 SSA required a match on social security number, last name, and date of birth of each individual to make a match. 
16:445:39054:0:25:72:533:709:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:equal in the two samples (11.3 and 11.8 percent, respectively) as is the fraction with positive earnings in 
16:446:39160:25:25:72:526:684:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:1998 (84.4 and 85.1 percent). Among those with a non-missing Armed Forces Qualification Test score 
16:447:39258:25:25:72:525:659:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:(AFQT), the average scores are also relatively close (52.1 and 53.4). And by construction, the average 
16:448:39361:25:26:72:518:634:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:year-of-birth and the average start year are comparable in the two groups. There are clear differences 
16:449:39462:26:25:72:507:608:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:between the BOG and NOG samples as well. BOG veterans are more than twice as likely as NOG 
16:450:39550:25:25:72:510:583:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:veterans to be receiving DC benefits in 2000 (14.3 versus 6.5 percent), just prior to the 2001 policy 
16:451:39649:25:26:72:512:558:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:change described above. This in part reflects the greater toll that military service took on those who 
16:452:39751:26:25:72:217:532:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:served in the Vietnam theatre.26  
16:453:39783:25:25:90:531:507:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:An examination of trends in key outcome variables in the BOG and NOG samples prior to the 2001 
16:454:39877:25:26:72:532:482:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:policy change reveals many similarities: the fraction with zero earnings increased by similar, though not 
16:455:39983:26:25:72:516:456:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:identical, amounts for both samples between 1998 to 2000 (by 1.5 and 1.0 points for BOG and NOG 
16:456:40077:25:25:72:536:431:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:samples, respectively), as did the fraction receiving SSDI benefits (1.2 and 0.9 points for BOG and NOG 
16:457:40179:25:25:72:541:406:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:samples). Our analysis will control for any differential trends in outcome variables that precede the policy 
16:458:40288:25:26:72:111:381:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:change.  
16:459:40296:26:25:90:542:355:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:A remaining concern with the primary analytic sample is that individuals who are matched in the SSA 
16:460:40394:25:25:72:530:330:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:data may systematically differ from those who are not. This is especially an issue for veterans who died 
16:461:40496:25:26:72:516:305:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:prior to 1997. As shown in columns 3 and 4 of panel B in Table 3, the fraction of veterans in the full 
16:462:40598:26:25:72:521:279:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:sample who were deceased as of 1997 was 6.2 and 6.1 percent in the full BOG and NOG samples but 
16:463:40690:25:25:72:537:254:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:only 4.8 and 2.9 percent in the SSA verified samples—though, notably, the fraction of veterans who died 
16:464:40792:25:25:72:534:229:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:between 1997 and 2007 in the BOG and NOG samples is closely comparable in both the full sample and 
16:465:40890:25:26:72:528:204:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:the SSA verified sample.27 The lower SSA match rate for deceased veterans is a consequence of SSA’s 
16:466:40989:26:46:72:534:178:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:record matching criteria, which require a match on subjects’ full names as well as SSN and date of birth. 
16:467:41095:46:13:216:219:132:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:                                                        
16:468:41150:13:16:72:539:119:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:26 Additionally, members of the NOG sample are more likely to have missing data on education and less likely to be 
16:469:41263:16:13:72:181:103:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:missing AFQT score data.  
16:470:41287:13:16:72:528:90:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:27 We constructed the sample summarized in panel B of Table 3 in the same manner as the sample summarized in 
16:471:41395:16:0:72:475:74:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:panel A, except that we did not exclude veterans who did not match with SSA earnings information. 
17:472:41494:0:25:72:536:709:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Due to poor optical character recognition, the NOG data contained a relatively high frequency of garbled 
17:473:41599:25:25:72:512:684:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:names. We worked with the credit information provider TransUnion to obtain names for those with 
17:474:41691:25:25:72:502:659:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:incomplete information.28 Due to limited availability of archival credit information prior to 1997, 
17:475:41790:25:26:72:532:634:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:TransUnion could not provide names for most veterans who passed away before that same year, leading 
17:476:41890:26:25:72:536:608:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:to a low overall match rate for NOG soldiers who died prior to 1997. Differential mortality match for the 
17:477:41996:25:25:72:524:583:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:BOG and NOG samples is not a major threat to the validity of our research design, however, since our 
17:478:42097:25:26:72:511:558:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:primary focus is on outcomes from 1998 forward. Thus, soldiers who were deceased as of 1997 are 
17:479:42192:26:25:72:195:532:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:excluded from the analysis. 
17:480:42219:25:25:90:521:507:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:To benchmark the representativeness of the sample, we compare the OEMA data with a similarly 
17:481:42309:25:26:72:537:482:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:drawn group of males from the 2000 IPUMS Census file. Using the 5 percent Census IPUMS extract, we 
17:482:42408:26:25:72:522:456:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:draw a group of all males born between 1946 and 1951, and further limit the sample to (self-reported) 
17:483:42510:25:25:72:525:431:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Vietnam-era veterans.29 Appendix Table 4 provides a side-by-side comparison of age, race, schooling, 
17:484:42607:25:25:72:520:406:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:annual earnings, and share with non-zero earnings in the OEMA and Census samples. Race and labor 
17:485:42703:25:26:72:520:381:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:force participation rates are closely comparable: the fractions of the OEMA and Census samples with 
17:486:42800:26:25:72:524:355:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:non-zero earnings are 84.1 percent and 82.2 percent, respectively, while the percent nonwhite are 11.3 
17:487:42899:25:25:72:531:330:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:and 13.3. Reflecting the fact that OEMA data code education at the time of military enlistment (average 
17:488:43003:25:26:72:542:305:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:age of 20) while the Census data code educational attainment in late adulthood, the OEMA sample reports 
17:489:43106:26:25:72:513:279:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:considerably lower educational attainment than the Census sample. Average earnings in the OEMA 
17:490:43198:25:25:72:500:254:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:sample are also about 10 percent lower than in the Census sample. This gap may reflect earnings 
17:491:43294:25:25:72:537:229:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:differences between Army veterans and those of other branches of the military. SSA data may also fail to 
17:492:43398:25:49:72:493:204:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:capture some earnings sources, including self-employment and non-covered work. Overall, our 
17:493:43490:49:13:216:219:155:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:                                                        
17:494:43545:13:16:72:516:142:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:28 TransUnion performed this work pro bono. Our original sample had 1.7 million observations with a missing 
17:495:43652:16:12:72:529:126:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:name. TransUnion was able to provide names for 1.5 million of these observations upon confirming a match with 
17:496:43762:12:12:72:235:114:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:date of birth and social security number. 
17:497:43803:12:17:72:530:102:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:29 The Census data do not allow us to distinguish among veterans according to their branch of military service. To 
17:498:43917:17:11:72:540:85:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:the extent that Army veterans are different from their counterparts serving in the Navy, Air Force, Marines, or Coast 
17:499:44035:11:0:72:410:74:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:Guard, we would expect some differences between the Census and OEMA samples. 
18:500:44113:0:25:72:538:709:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:comparison of OEMA and Census data provides some assurance that the OEMA sample is representative 
18:501:44211:25:25:72:507:684:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:of the target population of Vietnam era Army veterans, measured in terms of age, race, labor force 
18:502:44310:25:44:72:194:659:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:participation and earnings.

18:504:44414:25:26:90:509:590:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:The Agent Orange policy spurred a steep rise in Disability Compensation enrollment, and may 
18:505:44506:26:25:72:541:564:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:potentially have had spillover effects on enrollment in other federal disability programs as well. We begin 
18:506:44614:25:25:72:537:539:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:by estimating impacts on DC enrollment, followed by SSDI and SSI enrollment, and finally, total federal

18:509:44787:25:25:90:524:457:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Figure 3 plots the fraction of BOG and NOG veterans receiving DC benefits in September of each 
18:510:44879:25:25:72:513:432:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:year from 1998 through 2006. Prior to the Agent Orange change in 2001, DC enrollment was rising 
18:511:44972:25:25:72:512:407:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:somewhat more rapidly among BOG than NOG veterans. But DC enrollment among BOG veterans 
18:512:45060:25:26:72:519:382:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:accelerated substantially after 2001. Column 2 of panel A in Table 4 shows that BOG DC enrollment 
18:513:45157:26:25:72:536:356:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:increased by 0.4 percentage points per year  between 1998 and 2000 (13.5 to 14.3) and by 1.6 percentage 
18:514:45256:25:25:72:526:331:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:points annually between 2001 and 2006 (15.0 to 23.0). In contrast, DC enrollment growth rates among 
18:515:45356:25:26:72:512:306:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:NOG veterans remained small and relatively steady, increasing from 0.1 percentage points per year 
18:516:45453:26:25:72:516:280:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:between 1998 and 2000 (6.3 to 6.5) to 0.2 percentage points per year between 2001 and 2006 (6.6 to 
18:517:45552:25:25:72:532:255:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:7.6).30 Data from the National Health Interview Survey (Schiller et al, 2010) indicate that the fraction of 
18:518:45656:25:26:72:530:230:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:individuals with diabetes varies substantially by race, with rates among blacks substantially higher than 
18:519:45762:26:25:72:540:204:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:among whites. Consistent with this fact, an examination of the trends in DC enrollment in Table 4 reveals 
18:520:45865:25:25:72:538:179:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:substantial differences by race in the BOG sample, with DC enrollment increasing about 40 percent more 
18:521:45965:25:40:72:517:154:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:among BOG nonwhites (19.3 to 30.2, 10.9 percentage points) than among BOG whites from 2001 to 
18:522:46056:40:12:216:219:114:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:                                                        
18:523:46111:12:17:72:535:102:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:30 The policy change took effect in July of 2001 and we measure DC enrollment in September. Thus, our 2001 data 
18:524:46222:17:11:72:539:85:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:is arguably more “pre” than “post,” though it’s likely that the policy change did contribute to DC enrollment growth 
18:525:46339:11:0:72:307:74:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:between September 2000 and September 2001 in our data. 
19:526:46394:0:25:72:261:709:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:2006 (14.4 to 22.1, 7.7 percentage points). 
19:527:46436:25:25:90:501:684:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:These raw differences in DC enrollment trends between BOG and NOG veterans may reflect 
19:528:46522:25:25:72:542:659:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:differences in veteran characteristics in addition to any impact of the Agent Orange policy. To account for 
19:529:46628:25:26:72:522:634:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:these factors, we estimate a set of OLS models that regress DC enrollment on a full set of controls for 
19:530:46730:26:25:72:534:608:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:veterans’ year-of-birth, race, and AFQT score quintile.31 For consistency with the subsequent analysis of 
19:531:46832:25:25:72:542:583:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:labor market outcomes, our DC variables are calculated as means over five to nine veterans grouped at the 
19:532:46937:25:26:72:540:558:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:level of SSA reporting cells.32 We estimate the following equation for 1998 through 2006, weighting each 
19:533:47039:26:25:72:292:532:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:cell-year by the number of individuals in the cell:

19:543:47906:13:16:72:518:263:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:31 Veterans with low AFQT scores are more likely to enroll in DC (Autor et al 2011), and average scores differ 
19:544:48016:16:13:72:245:247:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:slightly between BOG and NOG veterans.

19:546:48172:16:12:72:536:218:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:we apply OLS models to cell means and weight by the number of individual observations in each cell, the cell level 
19:547:48287:12:11:72:491:206:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:estimates will be in most cases algebraically identical to those that we would obtain if cells were instead 
19:548:48393:11:12:72:538:195:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:disaggregated to individual level rows. The one exception to this dictum arises from the fact that ten percent of cells 
19:549:48513:12:11:72:539:183:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:in have more than one AFQT quintile represented within the cell. We assign the cell to the AFQT quintile nearest to 
19:550:48629:11:12:72:507:172:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:the cell’s mean AFQT quintile in these cases, meaning that the cell-level and corresponding individual level 
19:551:48738:12:13:72:196:160:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:regressions will differ slightly. 
19:552:48771:13:16:72:531:147:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:33 In our sample there are six possible values of YOB (1946 through 1951), two possible values of race (white and 
19:553:48884:16:11:72:534:131:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:nonwhite), and six possible values of AFQT quintiles (we group those with a missing AFQT into a sixth category). 
19:554:48997:11:12:72:531:120:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:Given there are nine years of data used in these estimates, we are including 126 interactions. Veterans within each

19:556:49228:11:12:72:539:97:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:Data for each veteran is included in each of these nine years unless the veteran dies at some point between 1998 and

19:558:49461:11:0:72:262:74:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:the cells, so typically the entire cell is dropped.

20:560:49613:25:26:72:531:684:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:year of 1998, while the coefficient vector 훾# estimates the difference in this gap in each subsequent year

20:564:49973:25:25:72:529:582:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:after controlling for race, year-of-birth, and AFQT quintile, quite similar to the unconditional estimated 
20:565:50080:25:26:72:525:557:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:difference of 7.2 percentage points in columns 1 and 2 of Table 4 (13.5 for BOG versus 6.3 for NOG).

20:568:50381:25:25:72:514:480:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:enrollment was increasing more rapidly (by 0.3 percentage points annually) for the BOG than NOG 
20:569:50475:25:26:72:507:455:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:sample prior to the 2001 policy change. Beginning in 2001, these coefficients increase much more 
20:570:50571:26:25:72:527:429:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:rapidly, by about 1.4 percentage points per year, and reach a cumulative differential of 7.98 percentage 
20:571:50671:25:26:72:517:404:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:points by September of 2006. As shown in panels B and C of Table 5, the point estimates differ only 
20:572:50766:26:25:72:504:378:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:modestly by birth cohort (1946-48 and 1949-51), with slightly larger effects for the older than the

20:582:51654:26:25:72:540:122:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:from September 2000 to September 2001 occurred before the policy took effect in July 2001. To interpret

21:584:51858:0:25:72:525:709:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:pre-existing trend in the difference in DC enrollment between the BOG and NOG samples would have 
21:585:51955:25:25:72:168:684:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:continued after 2001. 
21:586:51976:25:25:90:541:659:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:The estimates in the even-numbered columns of Table 5 highlight the significant trend increase in DC

21:588:52171:26:26:72:521:608:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:2001 as a pure pre-policy year, the estimate of 훿( in each case is slightly larger and the estimate of 훿/ 
21:589:52274:26:25:72:515:582:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:slightly smaller than is suggested by the year-by-year estimates. The magnitude of the trend break is 
21:590:52375:25:25:72:527:557:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:similar between the two birth cohort groups (1946-48 and 1949-51). In panel A of Table 6, we split the 
21:591:52476:25:25:72:542:532:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:sample by race (white/nonwhite) and by AFQT score. The acceleration in DC enrollment is largest among 
21:592:52576:25:26:72:536:507:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:BOG veterans who are nonwhite and have relatively low (below the 40th percentile in the sample) AFQT 
21:593:52675:26:25:72:115:481:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:scores.34  
21:594:52684:25:25:90:541:456:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Figures 4 and 5 relate these enrollment trends to the Agent Orange policy. Figure 4 documents a steep 
21:595:52783:25:26:72:527:431:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:increase in the likelihood that BOG (but not NOG) veterans receive compensation for diabetes, both in 
21:596:52885:26:25:72:517:405:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:the year of current DC receipt and in the year of initial DC enrollment. As documented in Panel C of 
21:597:52985:25:25:72:533:380:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Table 4, the fraction of DC beneficiaries receiving compensation for diabetes among BOG veterans rose 
21:598:53086:25:25:72:517:355:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:from 2.4 to 28.1 percent (25.7 points) between 2001 and 2006 versus 1.6 to 6.4 percent among NOG 
21:599:53183:25:26:72:517:330:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:veterans (4.8 points).35 Yet, as shown in Figure 5, there was only a modest increase in the fraction of 
21:600:53286:26:25:72:540:304:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:veterans receiving DC benefits absent a diabetes award. Thus, the rapid growth in DC enrollment appears 
21:601:53389:25:25:72:538:279:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:substantially accounted for by an influx of new diabetes awards. Figure 6 underscores that the increase in 
21:602:53495:25:26:72:528:254:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:DC enrollment was similarly rapid among older (YOB 1946-48) and younger (YOB 1949-51) Vietnam 
21:603:53589:26:38:72:403:228:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:veterans in our sample, as indicated by the regression estimates in Table 5. 
21:604:53665:38:14:216:219:190:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:                                                        
21:605:53720:14:17:72:345:176:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:34 We drop cells with missing AFQT scores for these specifications. 
21:606:53786:17:16:72:508:159:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:35 There are three likely reasons that DC receipt for diabetes increased in the NOG. One is that our data only 
21:607:53896:16:12:72:538:143:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:imperfectly classify BOG and NOG veterans; some veterans categorized as NOG may in fact have served in theatre 
21:608:54007:12:11:72:510:131:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:and hence presumptively qualified for service-connectedness for their type 2 diabetes. A second cause is that 
21:609:54117:11:12:72:524:120:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:administration of DC benefits appears to be somewhat discretionary. Even prior to the Agent Orange decision in 
21:610:54228:12:11:72:500:108:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:2000, 1.4 percent of BOG and 0.7 percent of NOG DC recipients were receiving compensation for service-
21:611:54330:11:12:72:529:97:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:connected diabetes (panel C of Table 4). Finally, some NOG veterans may have served in Korea in 1968 or 1969. 
21:612:54440:12:11:72:538:85:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:This source of slippage does not invalidate our identification strategy provided that the post-2001 trend break in DC 
21:613:54558:11:0:72:533:74:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:receipt in BOG versus NOG veterans is induced by the Agent Orange Policy change, which seems quite plausible.  
22:614:54670:0:25:90:498:709:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:The estimates so far capture the extensive margin impact of the Agent Orange policy on DC 
22:615:54758:25:25:72:524:684:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:participation. Panels B and C of Table 6 consider outcome measures that combine responses along the 
22:616:54855:25:25:72:532:659:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:extensive (enrollment) and intensive (rated severity) margins: Combined Disability Ratings (CDRs) and 
22:617:54956:25:26:72:535:634:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:annual benefits payments, both of which are continuous measures of DC participation.36 Both CDRs and 
22:618:55055:26:25:72:536:608:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:annual benefit payments rose significantly more rapidly for BOG than NOG veterans after 2001. Panel B 
22:619:55157:25:25:72:536:583:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:of Table 6 shows that prior to the Agent Orange policy, average CDRs of BOG relative to NOG veterans 
22:620:55258:25:26:72:541:558:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:were rising at 0.34 percentage points annually; after 2001, this differential trend tripled to 1.00 percentage 
22:621:55368:26:25:72:541:532:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:points annually (0.34 + 0.66). Similarly, panel C indicates that the year-over-year increase in annual mean 
22:622:55475:25:25:72:538:507:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:DC benefits paid to BOG relative to NOG veterans rose from $113 prior to the policy change to $305 per 
22:623:55578:25:26:72:538:482:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:year after 2001 ($113 + $192). Consistent with the estimates for DC enrollment by race and AFQT score, 
22:624:55680:26:25:72:532:456:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:the remaining columns of panels B and C demonstrate that CDRs and benefits payments increased more 
22:625:55778:25:25:72:538:431:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:rapidly among nonwhite than white BOG veterans, and more rapidly among low-AFQT than high-AFQT

22:628:55935:24:26:90:514:350:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:A significant constraint that some workers face when applying for SSDI benefits is that they are 
22:629:56032:26:25:72:525:324:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:unlikely to qualify for an award if they participate gainfully in the labor force while their case is being 
22:630:56140:25:25:72:535:299:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:decided (Autor et al., 2014). Knowledge of this fact may deter workers with residual work capacity from 
22:631:56244:25:26:72:539:274:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:applying for benefits since they would have to forfeit potential earnings in pursuit of an uncertain benefit. 
22:632:56354:26:25:72:522:248:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Since, as we document below, many veterans did leave the labor force after becoming eligible for DC 
22:633:56452:25:25:72:536:223:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:benefits, it is plausible that a subset that would otherwise have been deterred from seeking SSDI benefits 
22:634:56559:25:43:72:498:198:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:would choose to pursue these benefits as an indirect consequence of the Agent Orange policy.37

22:636:56708:13:16:72:514:142:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:36 Veterans receiving the IU rating are coded with a CDR of 100 since they receive benefits at the 100 percent 
22:637:56818:16:13:72:135:126:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:disability level. 
22:638:56835:13:16:72:519:113:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:37 Borghans et al (2014) find related evidence of program spillovers in disability receipt. On average, Dutch DI 
22:639:56946:16:12:72:521:97:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:recipients offset a €1.00 loss in DI benefits with a €0.30 increase in other social support programs. Duggan et al 
22:640:57061:12:11:72:513:85:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:(2007) find evidence that reductions in Social Security retirement benefits stemming from the rising U.S. Full 
22:641:57170:11:0:72:523:74:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:Retirement Age have lead to an increase in SSDI enrollment among cohorts facing a higher full retirement age.   
23:642:57281:0:25:90:509:709:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:To examine these potential spillovers, we estimate models analogous to equation (2) where the 
23:643:57374:25:25:72:528:684:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:outcome variable is the probability of SSDI receipt among BOG and NOG veterans (again measured at 
23:644:57472:25:25:72:532:659:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:the level of SSA reporting cells). Reflecting the longer sample window available for the SSA outcomes, 
23:645:57575:25:26:72:525:634:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:these models include two additional “pre” years, 1996 and 1997, and one additional “post” year, 2007. 
23:646:57677:26:25:72:540:608:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Panel A of Table 7 shows that, like DC enrollment, SSDI receipt was trending upward faster among BOG 
23:647:57776:25:25:72:519:583:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:than NOG veterans by 0.13 percentage points per year prior to the 2001 policy change. But this trend 
23:648:57877:25:26:72:496:558:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:accelerated after 2001, increasing to 0.25 percentage points (0.13 + 0.12) annually. Notably, the 
23:649:57972:26:25:72:541:532:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:magnitude of the estimated effect on SSDI is only about 10 percent as large as the corresponding estimate 
23:650:58078:25:25:72:538:507:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:for DC enrollment (compare column 1, panel A of Tables 5 and 6).38 These results suggest that the Agent 
23:651:58180:25:26:72:500:482:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Orange policy likely spurred additional SSDI enrollment, which may in turn have magnified any 
23:652:58272:26:25:72:347:456:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:reduction in labor force participation among eligible veterans. 
23:653:58335:25:25:90:540:431:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:In panel B of Table 7, we estimate models for receipt of SSI. Here, the estimates point in the opposite 
23:654:58439:25:25:72:519:406:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:direction: SSI enrollment was growing more rapidly among NOG than among BOG veterans prior to 
23:655:58533:25:26:72:526:381:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:2001, and this trend accelerated after 2001, in all likelihood because the additional DC transfer income 
23:656:58638:26:25:72:523:355:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:made some veterans ineligible for means-tested SSI benefits. The magnitude of the estimated break in 
23:657:58737:25:25:72:466:330:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:trend for SSI is only one-tenth as large as the corresponding estimate for SSDI, however. 
23:658:58826:25:26:90:533:305:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:The final panel of Table 7 estimates equation (2) for disability income combining benefits payments 
23:659:58925:26:25:72:524:279:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:from all three federal disability programs: DC, SSDI, and SSI. These estimates only include data from 
23:660:59026:25:25:72:528:254:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:1998 through 2006 since we do not have DC data for 1996, 1997, and 2007. Inclusion of SSDI and SSI 
23:661:59125:25:25:72:529:229:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:benefits with DC benefits raises the differential trend increase in benefits payments for BOG relative to 
23:662:59231:25:26:72:531:204:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:NOG veterans by approximately an additional 15 to 20 percent (compare to panel C of Table 6). Across 
23:663:59331:26:25:72:507:178:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:all veterans in our sample, combined disability benefits were rising by $128 annually among BOG 
23:664:59427:25:25:72:512:153:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:relative to NOG veterans prior to the 2002 Agent Orange policy change. Commencing in 2002, this 
23:665:59523:25:36:72:505:128:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:differential trend rose to $354 ($128 + $226). This average masks considerable heterogeneity. For

23:667:59675:14:0:72:537:78:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:38 In estimates not displayed, we find impacts on SSDI receipt that are similar for the 1946-48 and 1949-51 cohorts. 
24:668:59791:0:25:72:541:709:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:veterans with high CDRs, DC benefits payments substantially exceed SSDI benefits for all but the highest 
24:669:59896:25:25:72:528:684:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:(pre-disability) earners; moreover, DC benefits are not subject to federal taxation. Thus, the bulk of the 
24:670:60003:25:44:72:508:659:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:impact of the Agent Orange policy on veterans’ transfer income accrues through the DC program.

24:672:60143:25:26:90:534:590:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:We now consider impacts of the Agent Orange policy on veterans’ employment and earnings. Using 
24:673:60238:26:25:72:526:564:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:models analogous (1) and (2), we test whether the fraction of BOG veterans in the labor force declined 
24:674:60339:25:25:72:523:539:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:differentially relative to NOG veterans following the 2001 policy change. We again include data from 
24:675:60439:25:32:72:470:514:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:1996, 1997, and 2007 because of the longer sample window available for SSA outcomes.  
24:676:60523:32:25:72:253:482:117:Times:117:Times:A.  Impacts on labor force participation 
24:677:60563:25:25:90:541:457:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Table 8 considers the impact of the Agent Orange policy on labor force participation, measured as the 
24:678:60665:25:25:72:538:432:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:percentage of living veterans in an SSA reporting cell who have positive labor earnings. The first column 
24:679:60770:25:25:72:531:407:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:finds that labor force participation among BOG veterans in the baseline year of 1996 was slightly lower 
24:680:60871:25:26:72:527:382:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:(by 0.32 points) among BOG than NOG veterans. This participation gap was modestly expanding (i.e., 
24:681:60965:26:25:72:512:356:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:becoming more negative) in the early part of our sample period, falling by an additional 0.81 points 
24:682:61065:25:25:72:518:331:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:between 1996 and 2001. This expansion accelerated after 2000, with the BOG relative to NOG labor 
24:683:61162:25:26:72:541:306:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:force participation rate falling by an additional 2.02 percentage points between 2001 and 2007. Column 2, 
24:684:61266:26:25:72:539:280:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:which fits the parameterized model in equation (2), shows the rate of divergence between BOG and NOG 
24:685:61364:25:25:72:530:255:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:veterans roughly doubled after the Agent Orange decision, from 0.15 percentage points per year to 0.33 
24:686:61464:25:26:72:306:230:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:percentage points (0.15 + 0.18) annually after 2001.  
24:687:61514:26:25:90:512:204:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Coupled with the evidence in Table 5 on DC enrollments, the results in Table 8 suggest that the 
24:688:61607:25:25:72:533:179:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:differential increase in DC enrollment among BOG veterans spurred a reduction in their labor supply. A 
24:689:61708:25:25:72:499:154:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:natural alternative interpretation, however, is that BOG veterans were in worse health than NOG 
24:690:61802:25:26:72:510:129:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:veterans—perhaps due to the rigors of in-theatre military service—leading to comparatively earlier 
24:691:61901:26:25:72:537:103:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:retirements in the 2000s for reasons unrelated to the 2001 policy change. If so, the accelerating decline in 
24:692:62008:25:0:72:536:78:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:LFP among BOG veterans after 2001 should primarily impact the oldest Vietnam veterans, with younger 
25:693:62110:0:25:72:504:709:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:veteran cohorts exhibiting a similar LFP falloff as they approached these early retirement years in 
25:694:62208:25:25:72:534:684:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:subsequent years. Figure 7 and the remaining two panels of Table 8 explore these competing hypotheses 
25:695:62308:25:25:72:535:659:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:by again subdividing the sample into two birth cohorts of average ages 54 and 51 years at the time of the 
25:696:62410:25:26:72:536:634:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:policy change. Both the figure and the table reveal that labor force participation of BOG relative to NOG 
25:697:62516:26:25:72:530:608:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:veterans for both sets of birth cohorts dropped sharply soon after the policy change. The year-over-year 
25:698:62620:25:25:72:536:583:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:decline in BOG LFP relative to NOG LFP doubled after 2001 for both older (born 1946-48) and younger 
25:699:62719:25:26:72:519:558:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:(born 1949-1951) cohorts, rising from 0.17 to 0.36 percentage points (0.17 + 0.19) among the former 
25:700:62814:26:25:72:532:532:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:group, and from 0.14 to 0.32 percentage points (0.14 + 0.18) among the latter group. This trend break in 
25:701:62915:25:25:72:531:507:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:BOG relative to NOG labor force participation occurring simultaneously across birth cohorts after 2001 
25:702:63015:25:26:72:537:482:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:suggests that benefits expansion rather than early retirements explains the sharp drop in BOG labor force 
25:703:63121:26:25:72:301:456:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:participation following the Agent Orange decision.  
25:704:63172:25:25:90:504:431:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:The upper panel of Table 9 explores these employment patterns by race and AFQT subgroup. 
25:705:63260:25:25:72:532:406:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Declines in LFP generally mirror uptake of DC across demographic groups. Consistent with the Table 6 
25:706:63361:25:26:72:531:381:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:findings for DC enrollment, the fall in labor force participation among nonwhite and among low-AFQT 
25:707:63461:26:25:72:533:355:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:BOG relative to NOG veterans following the 2001 policy change is more pronounced than among white 
25:708:63557:25:32:72:529:330:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:and higher-AFQT veterans. These differences across groups are not statistically significant, however.    
25:709:63660:32:24:72:242:298:117:Times:117:Times:B.  Impacts on labor market earnings 
25:710:63696:24:26:90:538:274:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Alongside its extensive margin impact, receipt of DC benefits may spur veterans to reduce their work 
25:711:63795:26:25:72:506:248:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:hours or switch from full to part-time employment, thus reducing earnings conditional on ongoing 
25:712:63891:25:25:72:542:223:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:employment. We explore the effect of the Agent Orange policy on total labor force earnings by estimating 
25:713:63993:25:25:72:514:198:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:equation (2) for the log of mean cell earnings, excluding (of necessity) cells where all veterans have 
25:714:64094:25:47:72:513:173:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:exited the labor force.39 Panel B of Table 9 shows that earnings averaged about 2.6 log points lower 
25:715:64189:47:13:216:219:126:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:                                                        
25:716:64244:13:16:72:530:113:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:39 We use the log of the mean rather than the mean of the log because of the cell-level aggregation of our earnings 
25:717:64359:16:12:72:539:97:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:data. We do not, however, adjust cell means for non-participation; if a cell contains five veterans each earning $25K 
25:718:64477:12:11:72:537:85:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:annually and one leaves the labor force, mean cell earnings falls to $20K. Thus, this measure incorporates intensive 
25:719:64594:11:0:72:217:74:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:and extensive margin adjustments.   
26:720:64631:0:25:72:538:709:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:among BOG than NOG veterans in our baseline year, and this gap was expanding by about 0.2 log points 
26:721:64730:25:25:72:507:684:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:per year through 2001. The earnings gap grew significantly more rapidly—by about 0.7 log points 
26:722:64822:25:25:72:542:659:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:annually (0.23 + 0.45)—following the 2001 policy change. Once again, the effects are larger for nonwhite 
26:723:64925:25:26:72:187:634:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:and low-AFQT veterans.  
26:724:64948:26:25:90:521:608:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Since these total earnings impacts combine extensive margin (participation) and intensive margin 
26:725:65045:25:25:72:519:583:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:(hours and wage) responses, we cannot directly infer whether they reflect changes in earnings among 
26:726:65143:25:26:72:538:558:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:incumbents or merely a reduction in the number of veterans working. The evidence in panel A of Table 9 
26:727:65245:26:25:72:530:532:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:suggests, however, that minority and low-AFQT veterans were particularly likely to exit the labor force 
26:728:65349:25:25:72:538:507:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:upon receiving DC benefits. If we hypothesize more generally that veterans with lower potential earnings 
26:729:65454:25:26:72:538:482:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:are most likely to exit the labor force in response to increased transfer income, we can compare extensive 
26:730:65560:26:25:72:508:456:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:margin and total earnings responses to assess evidence for intensive margin responses. Concretely, 
26:731:65659:25:25:72:521:431:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:suppose that earnings among those dropping out of the labor force are below the average of those still 
26:732:65762:25:25:72:516:406:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:working within the cell—that is, income effects are larger for low earnings workers. In this case, the 
26:733:65864:25:26:72:492:381:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:decline in log cell earnings will be smaller than the decline in log cell labor force participation. 
26:734:65964:26:25:72:531:355:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Conversely, if the decline in log cell earnings exceeds the decline in log cell participation, this indicates 
26:735:66074:25:25:72:532:330:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:that either earnings is also falling on the intensive margin or, contrary to our assumption, higher earning 
26:736:66182:25:26:72:306:305:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:workers are exiting employment disproportionately.  
26:737:66233:26:25:90:531:279:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:To facilitate earnings and employment comparisons, panel C of Table 9 reports estimates where the 
26:738:66330:25:25:72:497:254:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:dependent variable is the log of the fraction of veterans in a cell working (rather than simply the 
26:739:66429:25:25:72:534:229:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:percentage working, as in panel A). Comparing across panels B and C reveals that the decline in relative 
26:740:66532:25:26:72:509:204:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:earnings of BOG versus NOG veterans after 2001 is, in most cases, slightly larger than the relative 
26:741:66631:26:25:72:539:178:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:decline in labor force participation. In column 1, for example, the relative decline in log earnings of BOG 
26:742:66739:25:25:72:528:153:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:relative to NOG veterans expands by 0.45 log points per year after 2001 whereas the relative decline in 
26:743:66842:25:26:72:529:128:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:log LFP increases by only 0.36 log points per year. This pattern also holds for black and white veterans 
26:744:66946:26:25:72:520:102:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:considered separately, though it does not hold for lower and higher-AFQT veterans. We infer that the 
26:745:67045:25:0:72:498:77:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Agent Orange policy likely induced a mixture of labor force exit and earnings reductions among 
27:746:67140:0:25:72:412:709:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:beneficiaries, though the evidence on the latter margin is far from clear cut.

27:749:67304:25:26:90:516:628:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Motivated by the evidence that the Agent Orange policy both raised DC enrollment and lowered 
27:750:67391:26:25:72:525:602:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:earnings among eligible veterans, we now use the Agent Orange policy as an instrumental variable for 
27:751:67491:25:25:72:539:577:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:receipt of DC benefits. This instrumental variables approach provides a valid estimate of the causal effect 
27:752:67596:25:26:72:492:552:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:of DC benefits on labor supply under the assumption that the Agent Orange policy only affects 
27:753:67688:26:25:72:542:526:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:employment and earnings through its impact on benefits enrollment and transfer payments. This exclusion 
27:754:67792:25:25:72:525:501:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:restriction is untestable of course, but the panoply of findings above confer credibility: we find a sharp 
27:755:67896:25:26:72:513:476:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:rise in DC receipt, DC payments, and total disability income among BOG relative to NOG veterans 
27:756:67992:26:25:72:520:450:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:following adoption of the Agent Orange policy; the rise in take-up was equally steep and pronounced 
27:757:68091:25:25:72:538:425:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:among younger and older veterans, and was greatest among nonwhite and low-AFQT veterans; and in all 
27:758:68190:25:25:72:511:400:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:cases, take-up responses are paralleled by differential employment and earnings drops among BOG 
27:759:68286:25:26:72:537:375:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:relative to NOG veterans that occur among both older and younger veterans, and which are slightly more 
27:760:68389:26:25:72:299:349:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:pronounced among nonwhite and low-AFQT vets.  
27:761:68434:25:25:90:530:324:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Table 10 presents instrumental variables of equation (2) for the impact of DC participation on labor 
27:762:68535:25:26:72:539:299:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:force participation, where the endogenous variable in panel A is the percentage of a cell enrolled in DC.40 
27:763:68642:26:25:72:534:273:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:The 2SLS estimate in column (1) finds that each percentage point increase in DC enrollment reduces the 
27:764:68745:25:25:72:530:248:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:fraction of veterans working by 0.18 points—that is, approximately one veteran exits the labor force for 
27:765:68849:25:25:72:521:223:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:every five veterans newly awarded DC benefits. Comparing across rows of this table, we find slightly 
27:766:68950:25:26:72:500:198:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:larger employment effects for nonwhite and low-AFQT veterans, consistent with our maintained 
27:767:69043:26:25:72:505:172:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:hypothesis that participation among these groups is more elastic. Notably, the (scaled) labor force 
27:768:69143:25:31:72:522:147:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:participation impact is estimated to be slightly (though not significantly) larger for younger than older 
27:769:69248:31:13:216:219:116:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:                                                        
27:770:69303:13:16:72:533:103:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:40 We limit the sample to the years 1998 through 2006 for which DC measures are available, rather than the longer 
27:771:69416:16:12:72:536:87:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:sample window of 1996 through 2007 for which SSA earnings data are available. The instrumental variable for DC 
27:772:69527:12:0:72:266:75:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:enrollment is 퐵푂퐺"×푡−2001×1푡≥2002. 
28:773:69563:0:25:72:541:709:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:veterans, again underscoring that the results are unlikely to be simply driven by differential trends in early 
28:774:69673:25:25:72:297:684:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:retirement among BOG relative to NOG veterans.  
28:775:69719:25:25:90:539:659:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:By specifying DC participation as the endogenous variable, the panel A estimate does not account for 
28:776:69818:25:26:72:535:634:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:policy-induced increases in DC benefits along the intensive margin—higher benefits among incumbents, 
28:777:69919:26:25:72:525:608:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:and greater potential benefits among new enrollees. We relax this restriction in panel B by making our 
28:778:70022:25:25:72:525:583:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:endogenous variable the sum of disability income (DC, SSDI and SSI benefits). This variable captures 
28:779:70123:25:26:72:523:558:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:changes in transfer payments among both new enrollees and incumbents.41 The panel B estimates find 
28:780:70221:26:25:72:534:532:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:that each thousand dollars in disability benefits payment reduces the probability of a veteran working by 
28:781:70326:25:25:72:540:507:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:approximately 0.80 percentage points, with slightly larger impacts among nonwhite veterans (0.97 points) 
28:782:70429:25:26:72:538:482:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:and slightly smaller impacts among older veterans (0.70 points). Scaling these estimates by the mean rate 
28:783:70532:26:25:72:516:456:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:of labor force participation (84.7 points) and mean year 2000 earnings (in constant $2013 dollars) of 
28:784:70633:25:25:72:537:431:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:$52.5K (Appendix Table 4) implies an extensive margin labor force participation elasticity of -0.50. This 
28:785:70737:25:25:72:535:406:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:is similar in magnitude to the estimates reported by Boyle and Lahey (2010), who study the labor supply 
28:786:70839:25:26:72:536:381:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:of a relatively comparable set of veterans who were nearing retirement in the mid-1990s. We also cannot 
28:787:70943:26:25:72:529:355:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:rule out that the participation elasticity we obtain incorporates both pure (non-incentive) income effects 
28:788:71050:25:25:72:532:330:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:from increased transfer income and additional incentive effects stemming from the potential availability 
28:789:71155:25:26:72:522:305:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:of IU and SSDI benefits. Fully distinguishing these incentive and non-incentive effects remains a ripe 
28:790:71256:26:25:72:172:279:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:topic for future work.  
28:791:71279:25:25:90:533:254:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:To what degree is this causal effect driven by changes in labor force participation among incumbent 
28:792:71378:25:25:72:531:229:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:DC recipients—many of whom received a higher combined disability ratings and corresponding benefit 
28:793:71477:25:26:72:528:204:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:increases as a consequence of the Agent Orange policy—rather than by changes in participation among 
28:794:71577:26:25:72:512:178:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:new enrollees? Appendix Table 5 probes this question by comparing the evolution of CDRs among 
28:795:71671:25:50:72:523:153:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:veterans according to DC enrollment status as of 1998 (the earliest year for which we have enrollment 
28:796:71773:50:13:216:219:103:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:                                                        
28:797:71828:13:16:72:527:90:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:41 Because cells receive no disability payments in a given year, we specify the disability payment measure in real 
28:798:71940:16:0:72:235:74:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:dollars rather than taking the logarithm.  
29:799:71984:0:25:72:529:709:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:data). Column 1 reports estimates of equation (2) for all veterans in our sample where the left hand side 
29:800:72090:25:25:72:524:684:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:variable is a veteran’s combined disability rating. Column 2 includes only veterans enrolled in the DC 
29:801:72193:25:25:72:520:659:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:program as of 1998, while column 3 excludes veterans not enrolled in DC as of 1998. Comparing the 
29:802:72290:25:26:72:533:634:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:column 2 and 3 estimates reveals that CDRs were increasing more rapidly among 1998 BOG incumbent 
29:803:72386:26:25:72:516:608:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:DC recipients than among their NOG counterparts prior to the policy change, but that there is only a 
29:804:72486:25:25:72:535:583:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:modest acceleration in this trend after 2001. Specifically, CDRs were increasing by about 0.8 percentage 
29:805:72591:25:26:72:524:558:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:points more annually among the BOG incumbents than the NOG incumbents between 1998 and 2001, 
29:806:72678:26:25:72:540:532:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:and this differential increased only modestly to 1.1 percentage points annually from 2002 forward (0.84 + 
29:807:72780:25:25:72:508:507:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:0.26). In contrast, the acceleration among new BOG entrants after 2001 (column 2) is much larger, 
29:808:72878:25:26:72:520:482:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:increasing from 0.20 to about 1.0 percentage points annually after 2001(0.22 + 0.73). Thus the Agent 
29:809:72975:26:25:72:522:456:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Orange policy change generated a much larger impact on the DC status of BOG veterans who had not 
29:810:73072:25:25:72:519:431:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:already enrolled in DC prior to the policy change than it did on incumbent recipients, suggesting that 
29:811:73175:25:25:72:381:406:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:labor supply impacts are likely driven primarily by new DC entrants.  
29:812:73244:25:26:90:516:381:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Panel B of Appendix Table 5 complements this evidence by comparing labor force participation 
29:813:73336:26:25:72:492:355:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:trends between cells with a high density of DC incumbents and those with a low density of DC

29:815:73532:25:26:72:542:305:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:restricts our sample to cells where at least one third of veterans (“high density”) were enrolled in DC as of 
29:816:73642:26:25:72:542:279:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:1998 and column 3 restricts our sample to cells where less than one third of veterans (“low density”) were 
29:817:73749:25:25:72:511:254:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:enrolled in DC as of 1998.43 Following the 2001 policy change, the rate of divergence among BOG 
29:818:73844:25:25:72:525:229:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:relative to NOG veterans actually attenuated slightly for cells with a high density of incumbents (from 
29:819:73948:25:26:72:528:204:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:0.35 to 0.29 points per year), but nearly tripled for cells with a low density of incumbents (from 0.11 to 
29:820:74055:26:13:216:219:178:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:                                                        
29:821:74110:13:16:72:530:165:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:42 While the SSA outcome cells never combine BOG and NOG veterans, they often combine a mixture of DC and 
29:822:74215:16:12:72:541:149:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:non-DC enrollees, and this fraction changes over time as enrollment evolves. It would have been invalid to construct 
29:823:74332:12:12:72:479:137:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:cells based on eventual DC enrollment, of course, since DC enrollment is an outcome of the analysis. 
29:824:74432:12:17:72:531:125:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:43 We cannot fully distinguish labor force participation effects for incumbents and potential entrants because labor 
29:825:74548:17:11:72:536:108:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:force participation rates are determined at the cell level and cells are not stratified on DC enrollment.  For example, 
29:826:74668:11:12:72:532:97:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:consider a cell with two veterans who were enrolled in DC as of 1998 and three veterans who were not enrolled as 
29:827:74781:12:11:72:526:85:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:of 1998.  If all five veterans had positive earnings in 1998, but only four had positive earnings as of 2006, we are 
29:828:74898:11:0:72:531:74:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:unable to determine whether the veteran who dropped out of the labor force was enrolled in DC as of 1998 or not.  
30:829:75013:0:25:72:532:709:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:0.32 points per year). This pattern again suggests that the differential decline in labor force participation 
30:830:75123:25:25:72:536:684:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:among BOG relative to NOG veterans after 2001 is driven primarily by veterans induced to enroll in DC 
30:831:75224:25:25:72:501:659:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:by the Agent Orange policy rather than by policy-induced changes in behavior among incumbent

30:834:75359:25:25:90:526:564:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Since the Agent Orange policy precipitated a rise in transfer payments and fall in employment and 
30:835:75457:25:25:72:498:539:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:earnings among eligible veterans, its net impact on incomes of BOG relative to NOG veterans is 
30:836:75552:25:26:72:526:514:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:ambiguous. We compare trends in total measured income (earnings plus the sum of DC, SSDI and SSI 
30:837:75648:26:25:72:526:488:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:benefits) between BOG and NOG veterans in Table 11, again limiting to the years 1998 through 2006, 
30:838:75747:25:25:72:510:463:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:where we have all earnings and benefits variables available. Since we have already established that 
30:839:75846:25:25:72:538:438:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:employment and earnings respond endogenously to policy-induced shifts in disability transfer income (as 
30:840:75950:25:26:72:537:413:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:theory would predict), the current exercise should be viewed as descriptive rather than inferential; the net 
30:841:76057:26:25:72:500:387:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:impact of the Agent Orange policy on veterans’ income combines exogenous policy impacts and 
30:842:76149:25:25:72:227:362:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:endogenous behavioral responses.  
30:843:76182:25:26:90:533:337:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:The first column of Table 11 (panel A) shows that, at the start of sample window in 1998, measured 
30:844:76280:26:25:72:530:311:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:incomes of BOG veterans were slightly lower than those of NOG veterans, with gaps of 0.75 log points 
30:845:76379:25:25:72:525:286:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:overall, 0.80 log points among nonwhites, and 0.70 log points among whites.44 Notably, incomes were 
30:846:76475:25:26:72:532:261:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:significantly higher (by 3.7 log points) among low-AFQT BOG veterans and significantly lower (by 2.5 
30:847:76575:26:25:72:538:235:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:log points) among high-AFQT BOG veterans (relative to their NOG counterparts). Recall, we saw earlier 
30:848:76677:25:25:72:539:210:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:in panel B of Table 9 that labor earnings of BOG veterans averaged up to 5 log points below that of NOG 
30:849:76779:25:25:72:522:185:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:veterans. Thus, comparing Tables 9 and 11 reveals that disability transfer income largely made up the 
30:850:76880:25:26:72:531:160:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:difference between BOG and NOG veterans, and resulted in substantially higher income for low-AFQT 
30:851:76977:26:31:72:530:134:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:BOG veterans relative to low-AFQT NOG veterans, consistent with the findings of Angrist et al (2010) 
30:852:77076:31:13:216:219:103:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:                                                        
30:853:77131:13:16:72:520:90:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:44 These reported earnings are covariate adjusted since they derive from the Table 11 regression estimates. Raw 
30:854:77241:16:0:72:341:74:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:differences are similar, however, as may be inferred from Table 3.  
31:855:77310:0:25:72:198:709:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:for low-education veterans.  
31:856:77338:25:25:90:542:684:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:The second and third rows of Table 11 summarize the evolution of the BOG/NOG income differential 
31:857:77434:25:25:72:523:659:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:before and after the Agent Orange policy. Prior to the policy change, BOG veterans were on a slightly 
31:858:77534:25:26:72:517:634:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:more positive total income trend than NOG veterans, with average annual incomes in the full sample 
31:859:77633:26:25:72:502:608:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:rising by 0.20 log points annually in relative terms. This differential trend steepened significantly 
31:860:77733:25:25:72:535:583:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:following the policy change, jumping from 0.20 to 0.71 log points (0.20 + 0.51) annually. For nonwhites 
31:861:77837:25:26:72:521:558:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:and low-AFQT veterans, the increase in the trajectory was steeper, rising from 0.27 to 1.31 log points 
31:862:77939:26:25:72:523:532:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:annually for the former group, and from 0.33 to 1.19 log points for the latter. While the Agent Orange 
31:863:78041:25:25:72:530:507:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:policy sharply reduced employment and earnings among eligible veterans, the Table 11 estimates make 
31:864:78141:25:26:72:493:482:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:clear that the policy-induced rise in transfer income more than offset these earnings reductions. 
31:865:78236:26:25:90:519:456:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:As a final characterization of these net policy and behavioral effects, the lower panel of Table 11 
31:866:78335:25:25:72:542:431:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:summarizes the net impact of DC enrollment on total earnings, where DC enrollment is instrumented with 
31:867:78438:25:25:72:524:406:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:the Agent Orange policy. The outcome variable for these estimates is cell total income—earnings plus 
31:868:78538:25:26:72:532:381:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:disability benefits—and the endogenous variable is again DC enrollment. The point estimate of 0.52 for 
31:869:78641:26:25:72:529:355:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:the full sample implies that - if a cell increased from 0 to 20 percent enrolled in DC - then average total 
31:870:78746:25:25:72:533:330:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:veteran income in the cell would increase by about 10.4 percent. In interpreting this sizable impact, note 
31:871:78852:25:26:72:540:305:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:that we found above that only one in five (18 percent of) newly enrolled veterans exited the labor force as 
31:872:78960:26:25:72:541:279:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:a consequence of the Agent Orange policy. For the remaining four-fifths, enrollment in DC raised transfer 
31:873:79066:25:25:72:537:254:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:income while generating only minimal offsetting reductions in labor income, thus unambiguously raising 
31:874:79169:25:25:72:524:229:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:total income. Of course, average incomes of Vietnam era veterans were modest in the early 2000s and 
31:875:79268:25:26:72:527:204:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:remained modest net of transfer benefits following the Agent Orange policy change. Nevertheless, this 
31:876:79370:26:25:72:540:178:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:policy had the unusual effect of increasing average veteran incomes, inclusive of the foregone earnings of 
31:877:79476:25:44:72:476:153:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:the approximately one in five newly enrolled DC recipients induced to exit the labor force.

31:879:79582:25:0:90:526:84:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:This paper provides evidence that the policy-induced increase in enrollment in the VA’s Disability 
32:880:79681:0:25:72:538:709:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Compensation program had a significant effect on the labor supply of Vietnam-era veterans. We estimate 
32:881:79783:25:25:72:526:684:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:that 18 percent of individuals who became eligible for the DC program as a result of the policy change 
32:882:79885:25:25:72:494:659:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:dropped out of the labor force. Analyses that explore the effect on average earnings support the 
32:883:79982:25:26:72:515:634:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:conclusion that DC enrollment substantially lowered labor supply among Vietnam-era veterans who 
32:884:80078:26:25:72:530:608:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:served in the Vietnam theatre during the conflict there. These effects appear to be driven by those made 
32:885:80182:25:25:72:520:583:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:newly eligible for DC benefits rather than by increases in benefits among those already receiving DC 
32:886:80283:25:26:72:507:558:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:prior to the 2001 policy change. The increase in transfer income more than offsets the reduction in 
32:887:80383:26:25:72:526:532:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:earnings, so that average income among BOG veterans increased relative to their counterparts who did 
32:888:80483:25:25:72:537:507:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:not serve in theatre. Combining policy-induced increases in transfer income and reductions in labor force 
32:889:80588:25:26:72:536:482:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:participation, we estimate an extensive margin labor supply elasticities of -.50, which is somewhat larger 
32:890:80692:26:25:72:539:456:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:than consensus estimates, though not implausible for this near-elderly population of Vietnam era veterans 
32:891:80796:25:25:72:170:431:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:in diminished health.  
32:892:80818:25:25:90:542:406:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:It is also likely that the income effect of DC income on employment and earnings is augmented by the 
32:893:80918:25:26:72:538:381:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:interaction between DC enrollment and veterans’ potential eligibility for Individual Unemployability and 
32:894:81023:26:25:72:496:355:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:SSDI benefits, both of which provide strong incentives against gainful labor force participation. 
32:895:81121:25:25:72:535:330:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that the Agent Orange decision affected enrollment in two other 
32:896:81225:25:26:72:515:305:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:federal disability programs, raising enrollment in SSDI by approximately one recipient for every ten 
32:897:81325:26:25:72:540:279:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:veterans newly enrolled in DC, and slightly reducing enrollment in the means-tested SSI program (though 
32:898:81427:25:25:72:541:254:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:the estimated effects are an order of magnitude smaller than for SSDI). In addition, 14 percent of Vietnam 
32:899:81533:25:25:72:536:229:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:era veterans within our sample received IU status by 2006. Among veterans who enrolled in DC the year 
32:900:81635:25:26:72:539:204:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:after the Agent Orange policy change, fully one-third received IU status or a CDR of 100 by 2006 . Since 
32:901:81738:26:25:72:518:178:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:IU benefits are only available to veterans with earnings at or below the poverty threshold for a single 
32:902:81841:25:25:72:531:153:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:individual, the rapid growth of IU designations among newly enrolled DC beneficiaries underscores the 
32:903:81942:25:26:72:531:128:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:potential for the graduated DC benefit program to generate unintended labor supply impacts. Analyzing 
32:904:82042:26:25:72:533:102:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:the dynamic interaction between these incentive and non-incentive effects of disability benefit programs 
32:905:82146:25:0:72:232:77:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:is a worthy goal for future research.

33:909:82256:13:12:72:514:658:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:To construct cells for matching individuals in the BOG and NOG samples with SSA data, we group 
33:910:82351:12:13:72:534:646:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:individuals based on their values of certain background characteristics, including their gender, race, year

33:912:82566:13:12:72:179:620:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:occurred, is as follows:

33:925:82900:12:13:72:537:456:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Before forming cells, we determined which individuals could be verified upon matching to the SSA data. 
33:926:83003:13:12:72:526:443:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:A match would be verified if the social security number, date of birth, and at least six letters of the last 
33:927:83111:12:13:72:539:431:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:name could be matched in the two data sets. We construct cells from the verified BOG and NOG samples 
33:928:83211:13:13:72:529:418:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:so that there are between five and nine individuals in each cell. Each cell consists only of individuals in 
33:929:83315:13:12:72:525:405:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:the BOG or in the NOG. The number of variables used in the grouping varies across cells. This occurs 
33:930:83416:12:13:72:535:393:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:because in some cases, a cell reaches a size of five to nine after grouping on a relatively small number of 
33:931:83522:13:13:72:534:380:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:variables. If a cell is between 10 and 29 individuals, we do not split further, but instead split the cell into 
33:932:83634:13:12:72:506:367:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:the maximum number of cells with size five or more after sorting on the next matching variable to 
33:933:83731:12:13:72:534:355:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:maximize similarity within the cells. If a cell has fewer than five individuals then we re-merge it with an 
33:934:83838:13:13:72:534:342:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:adjacent cell. If a cell with fewer than five individuals is merged with an adjacent cell to form a new cell 
33:935:83946:13:12:72:356:329:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:with more than nine individuals, the merged cell is split in two.

34:976:84798:12:13:72:525:457:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Appendix Figure 1A diagrams the construction of the sample used in our analysis. The “loss year” file 
34:977:84899:13:12:72:537:444:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:and the Vietnam file combine to form our baseline OEMA sample of 4.1 million veterans. After merging 
34:978:85000:12:13:72:533:432:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:the OEMA sample to VA disability data, the SSA Death Master File, and SSA earnings information, we 
34:979:85099:13:13:72:513:419:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:restrict our sample to 3.8 million veterans who had valid SSA earnings data. As seen in Table 2, the 
34:980:85200:13:12:72:523:406:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:number of BOG veterans in our database is largest in the 1966 through 1971 start years; veterans who 
34:981:85301:12:13:72:540:394:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:began their service after 1971 tended not to serve in the Vietnam theatre while those entering before 1966 
34:982:85408:13:13:72:521:381:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:are much less likely to be included in our sample since many in the latter group left the Army prior to 
34:983:85512:13:12:72:511:368:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:1968, the first year of our “loss year” file. We therefore restrict both the BOG and NOG samples to 
34:984:85612:12:13:72:540:356:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:veterans who have a start year between 1966 and 1971 inclusive, which reduces our sample to 1.9 million 
34:985:85714:13:13:72:524:343:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:veterans.45 We further restrict attention to individuals born between 1946 and 1951 inclusive, with 1.5 
34:986:85816:13:12:72:518:330:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:million veterans remaining. We next exclude approximately 150,000 veterans who have missing loss 
34:987:85913:12:13:72:534:318:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:years, loss years before 1968, or loss years after 1985. We finally drop an additional 8,000 veterans who 
34:988:86019:13:13:72:538:305:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:are in SSA cells where not all veterans have the same birth year, at least one veteran in the cell has a start 
34:989:86130:13:12:72:541:292:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:year before 1966 or after 1971, or at least one veteran in the cell has a loss year before 1968 or after 1985. 
34:990:86240:12:13:72:539:280:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:Our final sample includes 1.351 million veterans of the U.S. Army who began their service between 1966 
34:991:86342:13:13:72:531:267:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:and 1971 and were born between 1946 and 1951. For the analysis, we converted this final sample into a 
34:992:86444:13:12:72:496:254:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:1996-2007 panel of 15.2 million (year) x (individual) observations, or 2.9 million (year) x (cell) 
34:993:86543:12:13:72:299:242:117:g_d0_f1:117:g_d0_f1:observations, as depicted in Appendix Figure 1B.46

34:996:86648:14:16:72:524:153:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:45 For the nearly 200,000 veterans with missing start years, we imputed their start year based on the median start 
34:997:86762:16:11:72:539:137:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:year for other veterans in the sample with the same date of birth. This has little bearing on our final sample as nearly 
34:998:86883:11:13:72:497:126:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:all veterans with missing start years have missing loss years and are therefore excluded from our analysis. 
34:999:86990:13:16:72:527:113:42:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:46 A veteran who dies in year t is dropped from the analysis sample in year t and in all subsequent years. Because 
34:1000:87102:16:12:72:525:97:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:year-of-death is one of the variables used when constructing cells, typically all members of a cell die in the same 
34:1001:87218:12:11:72:530:85:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:year (if any die). The number of surviving cells falls by approximately 4.8 percent from 1996 to 2007. We restrict 
34:1002:87333:11:0:72:488:74:97:g_d0_f1:97:g_d0_f1:our panel to 1998 through 2006 for all specifications where the outcome is based on VA disability data.
