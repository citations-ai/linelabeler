2:32:1717:28:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:This paper documents the presence of non-economic career motivations in the U.S. labor market, explores
2:33:1820:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:reasons why such motivations could arise, and provides an explanation for why they might have persisted
2:34:1923:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:across many generations. The analysis links ethnic (migrant) labor market networks in the American
2:35:2021:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:Midwest when it was first being settled, the local identity or attachment to place that emerged endogenously
2:36:2129:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:to maintain the integrity of these networks, and occupational choice today. While fractionalization
2:37:2228:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:may adversely affect the performance of secular institutions, ethnic competition in the labor market
2:38:2328:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:could at the same time have strengthened within-group loyalty and parochial institutions. These values
2:39:2430:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:and their complementary institutions, notably the church, could have mutually reinforced each other
2:40:2529:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:over many overlapping generations, long after the networks themselves had ceased to be salient. Counties
2:41:2633:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:with greater ethnic fractionalization in 1860 are indeed associated with steadily increasing participation
2:42:2739:14:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:in select religious denominations historically dominated by the migrants all the way through the twentieth
2:43:2845:14:14:72:540:420:12:Times:12:Times:century. Complementing this result, individuals born in high fractionalization counties are significantly
2:44:2950:14:14:72:540:406:12:Times:12:Times:less likely to select into geographically mobile professional occupations and, hence, to migrate out
2:45:3050:14:14:72:540:392:12:Times:12:Times:of their county of birth, despite the fact that these counties are indistinguishable from low fractionalization
2:46:3161:14:42:72:443:378:12:Times:12:Times:counties in terms of local public good provision and economic activity today.

3:58:3424:0:31:57:170:700:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:1  Introduction
3:59:3439:31:20:57:542:669:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The  textbook  economic  model  assigns  individuals  to  occupations  on  the  basis  of  their  ability,  the
3:60:3550:20:21:57:542:649:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:opportunities they have to invest in human capital, and the types of jobs that are subsequently made
3:61:3650:21:20:57:542:628:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:available to them in the labor market.  Outside of economics, social scientists have long argued that
3:62:3751:20:20:57:542:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:non-economic  factors  can  also  determine  career  choices.   Weber’s  (1930)  writings  on  the  Protestant
3:63:3861:20:21:57:542:588:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ethos are the classic reference in this literature.  Contemporary sociologists have also described,  for
3:64:3965:21:20:57:542:567:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:example, how working class communities instill values in their members that shape their aspirations and
3:65:4068:20:20:57:542:547:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:restrict occupational mobility (Gans 1962).  Our objective in this paper is to document the presence of
3:66:4171:20:21:57:542:527:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:such non-economic motivations in the U.S. labor market, to explore the reasons why such motivations
3:67:4270:21:20:57:439:506:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:could arise, and to understand why they might persist across many generations.
3:68:4348:20:20:74:542:486:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We start with the idea that social groups can endogenously instill values in their members that
3:69:4443:20:21:57:542:466:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:increase  loyalty  and  reduce  the  propensity  to  exit,  particularly  when  they  are  vulnerable  to  accul-
3:70:4556:21:20:57:542:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:turation (Bisin and Verdier 2000) or in competition with other groups (Sumner 1906).  The negative
3:71:4654:20:20:57:542:425:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:consequences of population heterogeneity,  typically measured by fractionalization along various eco-
3:72:4755:20:21:57:542:405:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:nomic and social dimensions, are well documented in the economics literature.1While ethnic or racial
3:73:4855:21:20:57:542:384:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:fractionalization may adversely affect the performance ofsecularinstitutions, we argue that such frac-
3:74:4957:20:20:57:542:364:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tionalization can at the same time strengthen within-group loyalty andparochialinstitutions.  These
3:75:5056:20:21:57:542:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:values and their complementary institutions tend to be persistent and can shape career choices long
3:76:5155:21:20:57:410:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:after the economic forces that gave rise to them have ceased to be salient.
3:77:5230:20:20:74:542:303:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In  the  setting  that  we  consider  –  the  American  Midwest  –  the  labor  market  was  the  primary
3:78:5335:20:21:57:542:283:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:domain  in  which  ethnic  groups  interacted.   Migrant  workers  had  to  bear  most  of  the  fluctuations
3:79:5444:21:20:57:542:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in labor demand in the early stages of industrialization in the United States (Hoerder 1991).  This is
3:80:5546:20:20:57:542:242:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:precisely the situation in which labor market networks are most useful and there is a wealth of historical
3:81:5652:20:21:57:542:222:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:evidence documenting the role played by ethnic migrant networks in finding jobs for their members at
3:82:5752:21:20:57:542:201:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:this time.  With the arrival of the railroads around 1850, the Midwest in particular witnessed a large
3:83:5854:20:20:57:542:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:influx of European migrants in response to the new occupational opportunities that became available.
3:84:5954:20:21:57:542:161:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Historians describe the efforts made by migrant communities to establish “occupational beachheads”
3:85:6052:21:20:57:542:140:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and “toe-holds” in new locations, and to subsequently work hard to maintain these coveted positions
3:86:6151:20:16:57:542:120:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:once  they  were  established.   We  will  show  that  the  cost  to  the  network  from  the  exit  of  one  of  its
3:87:6268:16:15:70:542:104:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:1Alesina, Baqir, and Easterly (1999), for example, document the negative relationship between racial fractionalization
3:88:6386:15:0:57:249:89:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:and public good provision in the United States.
4:89:6434:0:20:57:542:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:members  and,  hence,  efforts  to  instill  a  sense  of  loyalty  to  the  local  community  would  have  been
4:90:6546:20:21:57:542:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:greatest in fractionalized labor markets with many ethnic networks competing for coveted permanent
4:91:6644:21:20:57:79:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:jobs.
4:92:6649:20:20:74:542:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The migrant church was historically central to the maintenance of the ethnic network, providing
4:93:6744:20:21:57:542:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a domain in which information could flow, commitments could be enforced, and loyalty to the local
4:94:6841:21:20:57:542:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:community could be instilled (Gjerde 1991).  Outside of the labor market, the church provided other
4:95:6940:20:20:57:542:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:services to its members as well, including social activity and support when they were sick or infirm.
4:96:7041:20:21:57:542:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Labor market networks and civic institutions based on a common European ancestry are largely irrel-
4:97:7140:21:20:57:542:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:evant in the Midwest today (Gans 1979, Alba 1990).  However, it would be incorrect to assume that
4:98:7237:20:20:57:542:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:these ethnic institutions disappeared without a trace.  While the labor market networks might have
4:99:7335:20:21:57:542:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:disappeared, the church continues to provide important forms of mutual assistance, which require, in
4:100:7435:21:20:57:542:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:turn,  a  relatively  high  level  of  commitment  in  terms  of  time  and  effort  from  the  congregation.   We
4:101:7549:20:20:57:542:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:expect churches to have made a particular effort to instill a sense of group-loyalty among their mem-
4:102:7650:20:21:57:542:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:bers in fractionalized markets with competing ethnic groups at the time of initial settlement.  Such
4:103:7750:21:20:57:542:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:loyalty and commitment to the local community would have led, in turn, to well functioning churches.
4:104:7850:20:20:57:542:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:If members’ inputs in the church are complements, as suggested by Iannaccone (1998), and if there is
4:105:7950:20:20:57:542:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sufficient overlap across generations, then the incumbent members of these well functioning churches
4:106:8050:20:21:57:542:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:would have had a greater incentive to instill an identity that discouraged geographical mobility in the
4:107:8153:21:20:57:542:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:generation that followed.  This process would have repeated itself from one generation to the next, in
4:108:8255:20:20:57:542:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the church and in other institutions that formed around it, linking initial settlement patterns to local
4:109:8359:20:21:57:380:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:identity or a loyalty to place that is independent of ethnicity today.
4:110:8429:21:20:74:542:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Loyalty to place or local identity (Hunter 1975, Guerson, Stueve and Fischer 1977, Hummon 1990)
4:111:8524:20:20:57:542:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is well described by the following quote from a resident of Bloomington, Indiana who moved to that
4:112:8622:20:21:57:542:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:city to live with his wife who was born nearby, “...  my chief ambition, I discovered during our early
4:113:8724:21:20:57:542:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:years in Bloomington, was not to make a good career but to make a good life.  And such a life as I
4:114:8822:20:20:57:542:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:came to understand it, meant being a husband and a father first, and an employee second; it meant
4:115:8919:20:21:57:542:172:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:belonging to a place rather than to a profession ...  So as I came to recognize my children’s need and
4:116:9021:21:20:57:542:151:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:my own need for a firm home place, I came to understand my community’s need for citizens who stay
4:117:9118:20:20:57:542:131:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:put.  Most of what I valued in Bloomington was the result of efforts by people who loved the place,
4:118:9217:20:21:57:542:111:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:either because they grew up here and chose to stay, or because they landed here and chose to remain”
4:119:9317:21:0:57:164:90:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(Sanders 2007:  67-68).
5:120:9341:0:20:74:542:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Two aspects of local identity emerge from the preceding quote.  First, local identity is associated
5:121:9440:20:21:57:542:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with values that stress loyalty to a specific place.  As in Akerlof and Kranton (2000), we expect that
5:122:9542:21:20:57:542:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:individuals  born  and  socialized  in  communities  with  a  strong  local  identity  will  incur  a  utility  cost
5:123:9658:20:20:57:542:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:when they deviate from prescribed behavior and leave their communities.  In the U.S. labor market,
5:124:9756:20:21:57:542:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:this implies that individuals endowed with a strong sense of local identity will be less likely to choose
5:125:9861:21:20:57:542:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:professional occupations, which are associated with significantly greater work-related moves than non-
5:126:9963:20:20:57:542:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:professional occupations.  Second, we see that the core value associated with local identity, notably a
5:127:10066:20:21:57:542:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:commitment to stay, complements local institutions.  Strong identity and well functioning institutions
5:128:10168:21:20:57:542:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are mutually reinforcing and, as discussed above, one cannot persist without the other (B ́enabou and
5:129:10269:20:20:57:542:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Tirole  [2006]  make  the  same  argument  to  explain  the  persistence  of  mutually  reinforcing  collective
5:130:10380:20:21:57:206:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:beliefs and political equilibria).
5:131:10414:21:20:74:542:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The homogenization of production that is characteristic of the Midwest only began around 1880.
5:132:10508:20:20:57:542:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Thus, between 1850 and 1880 there was a window of time during which this region was rapidly settled
5:133:10607:20:21:57:542:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and during which there was substantial fluctuation in labor market conditions and, hence, ethnic rivalry
5:134:10711:21:20:57:542:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:across local areas.  These initial conditions are crucial because once local institutions and a level of
5:135:10815:20:20:57:542:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:individual  commitment  were  established,  these  mutually  reinforcing  effects  would  have  remained  in
5:136:10923:20:20:57:542:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f5:place over many generations in the future. We consequently exploit variation in initial conditionswithin
5:137:11027:20:21:57:542:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the Midwest to identify the effect of historical networks, and the identity and parochial institutions
5:138:11129:21:20:57:542:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:they engendered, on occupational choice and geographical mobility long after the networks themselves
5:139:11229:20:20:57:542:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:had  disappeared.   The  framework  we  have  outlined  generates  two  testable  predictions.   The  first
5:140:11336:20:21:57:542:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:prediction is that areas with greater ethnic rivalry at the time of settlement should be associated with
5:141:11440:21:20:57:542:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:stronger local identity, which implies that individuals born (and socialized) in those areas should be
5:142:11542:20:20:57:542:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:less likely to enter a more mobile professional career today.  The second prediction is that greater ethnic
5:143:11649:20:21:57:542:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rivalry should also have given rise to better functioningmigrantchurches and, hence, greater religious
5:144:11751:21:20:57:542:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:participation in select denominations historically dominated by the migrants, over many generations
5:145:11850:20:20:57:120:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the future.
5:146:11864:20:21:74:542:172:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To test the first prediction we combine data from the U.S. census and the National Longitudinal
5:147:11959:21:20:57:542:151:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79).  A major advantage of situating the analysis in the Midwest is that
5:148:12057:20:20:57:542:131:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:individual  level  data  on  occupations  and  ethnicity  can  be  obtained  from  the  census  going  back  to
5:149:12168:20:21:57:542:111:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the time when this region was starting to develop.  We focus on the 1860 census when rapid growth
5:150:12265:21:0:57:542:90:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:was just commencing and construct a measure of ethnic fractionalization, one minus the Herfindahl
6:151:12363:0:20:57:542:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:concentration index, within each broad occupational category in each county in that census year.  Aver-
6:152:12466:20:21:57:542:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:aging over all occupational categories in each county we arrive at a measure of ethnic fractionalization
6:153:12570:21:20:57:542:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in 1860 that we expect is positively correlated with ethnic rivalry in the labor market at that time
6:154:12670:20:20:57:542:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and,  hence,  with the strength of local identity in the county as it subsequently emerged.  Matching
6:155:12771:20:21:57:542:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the county-level measure of ethnic fractionalization with individual data from the NLSY79,  we find
6:156:12870:21:20:57:542:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that individuals born in high fractionalization counties are significantlylesslikely to be employed in
6:157:12972:20:20:57:542:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:professional occupations and are significantlylesslikely to have migrated out of their birth county in
6:158:13074:20:21:57:82:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:2000.
6:159:13079:21:20:74:542:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The values that we believe are responsible for the career choices described above could not have
6:160:13175:20:20:57:542:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:persisted in a local community over so many generations without institutional support.  The second
6:161:13273:20:21:57:542:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:prediction of our framework is that high fractionalization counties should have been associated with
6:162:13373:21:20:57:542:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:better functioning migrant churches and related parochial institutions.  If these institutional features
6:163:13477:20:20:57:542:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:persisted over time,  supporting and being supported by local identity,  then we would expect to see
6:164:13577:20:21:57:542:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:greater participation in religious denominations that were historically dominated by migrants, notably
6:165:13679:21:20:57:542:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the Lutherans and the Catholics, today.  Using data from the Census of Religious Bodies, available at
6:166:13780:20:20:57:542:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:roughly ten-year intervals from 1860 to 2000, we successfully verify this important prediction. The share
6:167:13885:20:20:57:542:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of Lutherans and Catholics in the population is significantly larger in high fractionalization counties
6:168:13988:20:21:57:542:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:by 1870 and, most importantly, this gap grows steadily wider over the course of the twentieth century.
6:169:14090:21:20:57:542:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In  contrast,  participation  in  other  denominations  is  significantlylowerin  the  high  fractionalization
6:170:14200:20:20:57:205:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:counties over the entire period.
6:171:14232:20:21:74:542:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Our  interpretation  of  these  striking  results  is  that  local  institutions  and  individual  values,  de-
6:172:14343:21:20:57:542:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:termined endogenously by the labor market when the Midwest was first being settled in 1860, have
6:173:14439:20:20:57:542:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:subsequently persisted over time and continue to shape occupational choices in the county one hundred
6:174:14540:20:21:57:542:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and forty years later.  Alternative explanations assume that the ability endowment in the population,
6:175:14641:21:20:57:542:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:investments in human capital, or access to particular types of jobs today vary with fractionalization
6:176:14742:20:20:57:542:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in  1860.   For  example,  although  ethnic  networks  and  European  ancestry  are  no  longer  directly  rel-
6:177:14853:20:21:57:542:172:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:evant in the Midwest economy,  ethnic fractionalization in 1860 could potentially be correlated with
6:178:14953:21:20:57:542:151:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:particular features of the economy at that time, which had persistent effects and are correlated with
6:179:15054:20:20:57:542:131:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:thedemandfor professional labor today.  Similarly, the well documented negative correlation between
6:180:15153:20:21:57:542:111:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:fractionalization and public good provision could have given rise to poorly functioning schools in high
6:181:15256:21:0:57:180:90:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:fractionalization counties.
7:182:15284:0:20:74:542:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:If identity is salient and the current demand for professional labor is uncorrelated with historical
7:183:15384:20:21:57:542:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f5:fractionalization, then we show that there will be a mismatch in the labor market as long as there isex
7:184:15487:21:20:57:542:659:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:anteuncertainty in the demand for different types of jobs.  High fractionalization counties will supply
7:185:15590:20:20:57:542:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:too few professionals and too many non-professionals.  Professional labor must move into these counties
7:186:15693:20:21:57:542:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and non-professional labor must move out of themex postin competitive equilibrium.  It follows that
7:187:15792:21:20:57:542:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:individualsresidingin high fractionalization counties will be just as likely to hold professional jobs as
7:188:15897:20:20:57:542:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:individuals residing in low fractionalization counties, once the labor market clears. It is only individuals
7:189:16005:20:21:57:542:558:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:bornin high fractionalization counties who should be less likely to be professionals.  The alternative
7:190:16107:21:20:57:542:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:hypothesis,  based  on  differences  in  the  demand  for  professional  labor  across  counties,  predicts  that
7:191:16220:20:20:57:542:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:individualsborn and residingin high fractionalization counties should be less likely to be professionals.
7:192:16325:20:21:57:542:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We  will  later  verify  that  labor  flows  systematically  with  the  level  of  historical  fractionalization  as
7:193:16441:21:20:57:542:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:described above and, more importantly, that there is no correlation between occupational choice and
7:194:16540:20:20:57:542:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the historical level of ethnic fractionalization in the county of residence, ruling out the most obvious
7:195:16644:20:21:57:241:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:alternative explanation for our results.
7:196:16684:21:20:74:542:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Our results could also be obtained if the incoming migrants in the high fractionalization counties
7:197:16782:20:20:57:542:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:had lower ability, and this ability differential persisted across generations.  Human capital transmission
7:198:16888:20:20:57:542:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is  less  of  a  concern  with  our  analysis  since  we  are  going  back  at  least  five  generations;  even  if  the
7:199:17008:20:21:57:542:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ability distribution of the incoming migrants varied systematically with fractionalization in 1860, this
7:200:17112:21:20:57:542:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:heterogeneity would have long since disappeared, given the high rates of inter-county migration (close
7:201:17214:20:20:57:542:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to 60 percent on average) that we document below.2Moreover, given the dynamic nature of the local
7:202:17311:20:21:57:542:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:economy  at  the  time  of  initial  settlement,  fractionalization  was  not  very  persistent;  the  correlation
7:203:17425:21:20:57:542:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:between 1860 and 1870 fractionalization is just 0.3 and the correlation between 1860 and 1900 frac-
7:204:17524:20:20:57:542:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tionalization is just 0.16.  We thus do not expect to find a strong association between our measure of
7:205:17626:20:21:57:542:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:fractionalization in 1860 and the local heterogeneity that could have determined formative investments
7:206:17728:21:16:57:542:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the school system many decades later in the twentieth century, as documented by Goldin and Katz
7:207:17826:16:14:70:542:196:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:2The empirical strategy that we employ is related to the strategy adopted by Fernandez and Fogli (2007) in a very
7:208:17939:14:11:57:542:182:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:interesting recent paper.  Fernandez and Fogli establish that female labor force participation in the origin country affects
7:209:18063:11:11:57:542:171:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:labor force participation and fertility rates among second-generation female migrants in the United States.  They rely
7:210:18181:11:11:57:542:160:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:on  the  assumption  that  cultural  traits  will  be  transmitted  across  space  and  so  cultural  heterogeneity  will  continue  to
7:211:18316:11:11:57:542:149:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:manifest itself in an economic environment – the U.S. labor market – that does not distinguish between social groups.
7:212:18433:11:11:57:542:138:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:The obvious alternative explanation, which they take care to rule out, is that human capital rather than culture is being
7:213:18554:11:11:57:542:127:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:transmitted across generations.  With our strategy, the chief concern is that there is something about theplace, other
7:214:18672:11:11:57:542:116:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:than identity and its complementary institutions, that has persisted over time, which the preceding test on the county of
7:215:18793:11:0:57:288:105:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:residence, rather than the county of birth, helps rule out.
8:216:18853:0:20:57:542:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(1999).  The NLSY provides information on AFQT scores and educational attainment.  Information
8:217:18947:20:21:57:542:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on local public good provision, including education expenditures, can also be obtained at the county
8:218:19047:21:20:57:542:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:level  in  1990.   As  expected,  we  find  no  relationship  between  historical  fractionalization  and  current
8:219:19161:20:20:57:304:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:investments in schooling or educational attainment.
8:220:19212:20:21:74:542:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Complementing recent studies that investigate the relationship between culture and growth (Barro
8:221:19308:21:20:57:542:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and  McCleary  2003,  Tabellini  2005,  Fernandez  and  Fogli  2007),  we  find  that  local  identity  and  its
8:222:19420:20:20:57:542:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:accompanying institutions,  notably the church,  have an important effect on occupational choice.  A
8:223:19520:20:21:57:542:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:one standard deviation decline in 1860 fractionalization would increase the proportion of individuals
8:224:19621:21:20:57:542:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:holding  professional  jobs  in  2000  from  9  percent  to  15  percent.   Internal  migration  clears  the  labor
8:225:19736:20:20:57:542:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:market  in  our  U.S.  setting  and  so  we  do  not  expect  identity  to  have  a  substantial  effect  on  local
8:226:19851:20:21:57:542:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:growth rates.  Nevertheless, the fact that non-economic factors have such a large and persistent effect
8:227:19954:21:20:57:542:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on  important  economic  choices  in  a  region  as  homogenous  as  the  American  Midwest  suggests  that
8:228:20061:20:34:57:450:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cultural effects may be even stronger across countries with very different histories.

8:231:20206:27:21:57:542:370:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The Midwest first began to be settled in the early nineteenth century with the expansion of the national
8:232:20310:21:20:57:542:349:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:canal system.  The Erie Canal linking the Hudson to Lake Erie was completed in 1825 and numerous
8:233:20406:20:20:57:542:329:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:inter-regional and intra-regional canals were built over the next two decades (Fishlow 2000).  However,

8:236:20707:20:20:57:196:268:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:added by 1857 (Meyer 1989).
8:237:20734:20:21:74:542:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Improved rail transportation stimulated industrialization and the Midwest’s share of national man-
8:238:20832:21:20:57:542:227:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ufacturing increased rapidly between 1860 and 1920, with almost half of this increase occurring in the
8:239:20934:20:20:57:542:207:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1860’s (Meyer 1989).  This increase in economic activity led, in turn, to an increase in the demand for
8:240:21037:20:21:57:542:187:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:labor.  In 1810, approximately 6 percent of the labor force (outside the southern states) resided in the
8:241:21141:21:20:57:542:166:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Midwest.  My 1860, this share had increased to 41 percent, with a further increase to 51 percent by
8:242:21240:20:20:57:452:146:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1880, after which regional growth converged to the national average (Margo 1999).
8:243:21321:20:21:74:542:126:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In this paper, the Midwest is comprised of the states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota,
8:244:21423:21:0:57:542:105:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Ohio, and Wisconsin (Missouri, the only pre-Civil War slave state in the Midwest, is excluded from the
9:245:21526:0:20:57:542:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:analysis).  Using county-level census data we see that the number of incorporated counties increases
9:246:21626:20:21:57:542:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sharply  from  1850  to  1860  and  then  flattens  out  by  1880  in  Figure  1.   Information  on  railroads,
9:247:21737:21:20:57:542:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:obtained from the Historical Map Archive at the University of Alabama, indicates that the number of
9:248:21836:20:20:57:542:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:these counties with a railroad also increases steeply over the 1850-1870 period, growing thereafter at a
9:249:21940:20:21:57:542:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:slower rate.3The rapid expansion of the railroad system and the economic activity that accompanied
9:250:22038:21:20:57:542:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:it led to a steep increase in the population of the Midwest as well as an influx of foreign migrants.
9:251:22139:20:20:57:542:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Using county-level census statistics,  the total population in our seven Midwestern states grew from
9:252:22239:20:21:57:542:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:less than 5 million in 1850 to 20 million in 1900.  The number of foreign-born migrants nearly tripled
9:253:22341:21:20:57:396:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:between 1850 and 1860, reaching close to 20 percent of the population.
9:254:22411:20:20:74:542:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Where did these migrants come from?  Individual-level data, including characteristics such as age,
9:255:22509:20:21:57:542:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sex, occupation, and country of birth, are publicly available from the Population Census each decade
9:256:22609:21:20:57:542:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from 1850 to 1930.  We use the 1-in-100 sample from the 1860-1900 IPUMS to study changes in the
9:257:22704:20:20:57:542:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:migrant population in these critical early decades in Table 1.  The English (13 percent), the Irish (25
9:258:22807:20:21:57:542:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:percent), and the Germans (32 percent), dominated the migrant population in the Midwest in 1860,
9:259:22903:21:20:57:542:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:just after the first wave of migration described above, with no other ethnic group accounting for more
9:260:23005:20:20:57:542:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:than  a  3  percent  share  of  the  migrants  in  that  year.   Subsequently,  the  English  and  the  Irish  were
9:261:23120:20:20:57:542:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:displaced by the Germans and the Scandinavians over the 1860-1900 period.  Notice that the Italians,
9:262:23220:20:21:57:542:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Poles, and Slavs continue to be insignificant in 1900, although they would display a substantial presence
9:263:23325:21:20:57:542:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in Midwestern cities such as Cleveland, Chicago, and Pittsburgh by the first quarter of the twentieth
9:264:23426:20:20:57:95:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:century.
9:265:23434:20:21:74:542:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:What jobs did the migrants occupy?  Table 2 reports the occupational distribution of the migrants
9:266:23531:21:20:57:542:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from the IPUMS sample in 1860, 1880, and 1900.  Although agriculture was the dominant sector in
9:267:23626:20:20:57:542:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:this period, the share of farm employment declines from 62 percent in 1860 to 48 percent in 1900, with
9:268:23728:20:21:57:542:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:manufacturing operatives and laborers accounting for much of the increase in non-farm employment.
9:269:23825:21:20:57:542:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:These trends are consistent with the growth of the manufacturing sector described above and they are
9:270:23925:20:20:57:419:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:similar for the foreign-born migrants and the native workers (not reported).
9:271:24001:20:21:74:542:172:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The apparent similarity in the occupational distribution for migrants and natives masks differences
9:272:24100:21:20:57:542:151:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the type of jobs they had access to within each occupational category.  Labor markets in the nine-
9:273:24201:20:16:57:542:131:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:teenth century could be divided into three segments: a stable segment with permanent employment, an
9:274:24300:16:15:70:542:115:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:3Railroad maps were used to construct a county-level binary variable indicating whether any part of a railroad ran
9:275:24414:15:11:57:542:100:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:through the county in a given year.  Railroad maps were unavailable in some census years in which case we used maps
9:276:24529:11:0:57:441:89:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:that were closest in vintage to those census years (the discrepancy never exceeded three years).
10:277:24626:0:20:57:542:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:unstable segment with periodic short-term unemployment, and a marginal but highly flexible segment
10:278:24724:20:21:57:542:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:characterized by spells of long-term and short-term employment (Gordon, Edwards, Reich 1982).  Mi-
10:279:24822:21:20:57:542:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:grants being newcomers to the U.S. market typically ended up in the unstable and marginal segments,
10:280:24921:20:20:57:542:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:where the uncertain labor demand naturally provided an impetus for the formation of ethnic networks
10:281:25020:20:21:57:542:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that helped their members find jobs (Hoerder 1991).  We would expect these networks to have been
10:282:25116:21:20:57:542:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:particularly important during the rapid expansion phase around 1860, with the influx of migrants and
10:283:25216:20:20:57:542:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the opening up of new labor markets in both agriculture and manufacturing.  The initial conditions
10:284:25314:20:21:57:542:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the empirical analysis, measuring ethnic rivalry in the labor market at the time of settlement, will
10:285:25417:21:29:57:338:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:consequently be measured using data at this point in time.

10:287:25516:27:20:57:542:481:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Accounts  by  contemporary  observers  and  a  rich  social  history  literature  indicate  that  friends  and
10:288:25626:20:21:57:542:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:kin from the origin community in Europe played an important role in securing jobs for migrants in
10:289:25723:21:20:57:542:440:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the Midwest in the nineteenth century and the first quarter of the twentieth century.  Early historical
10:290:25826:20:20:57:542:420:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:studies used census data, which provides fairly detailed occupational and ethnic information, to identify
10:291:25931:20:21:57:542:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ethnic clusters in particular locations and occupations.  Gordon, Edwards, and Reich (1982) note that
10:292:26032:21:20:57:542:379:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:although foreign-born workers comprised just over 20 percent of the labor force in 1870, they accounted
10:293:26135:20:20:57:542:359:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for 43 percent of the iron and steel operatives, 43 percent of the woolen mill workers, and 63 percent
10:294:26237:20:21:57:542:339:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the miners.  Nearly a quarter of railroad workers were Irish, a third of the miners were British, and
10:295:26341:21:20:57:542:318:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:about half the workers in the baking and confectionary business were German.  While such clustering
10:296:26440:20:20:57:542:298:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:suggests that underlying ethnic networks were channelling their members into particular occupations,
10:297:26540:20:21:57:542:278:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:it could simply reflect the fact that migrants arrived with specific skills.  Hutchinson’s (1956) analysis
10:298:26646:21:20:57:542:257:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of 1950 census data, however, indicates that clustering continued even among the migrants’ children,
10:299:26746:20:20:57:542:237:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with the concentration of particular ethnic groups in some industries actually increasing from the first
10:300:26850:20:21:57:177:217:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to the second generation.
10:301:26875:21:20:74:542:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Although census data are a useful source of information, they do not provide details of the migration

10:303:27080:20:21:57:542:156:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:social historians have linked parish registers and county data in specific European sending communities
10:304:27183:21:20:57:542:135:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to census and church records in the United States to construct the entire chain of migration from those
10:305:27286:20:20:57:542:115:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:communities as it unfolded over time.  This remarkable research effort has documented the formation
10:306:27385:20:0:57:542:95:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of  new  settlements  in  the  Midwest  by  pioneering  migrants,  the  subsequent  channelling  of  migrants
11:307:27495:0:20:57:542:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from the origin community in Europe to these settlements, as well as the movement of groups from the
11:308:27595:20:21:57:542:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:original settlement to new satellite colonies elsewhere in the United States. As with the census data, this
11:309:27702:21:20:57:542:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:research identifies occupational and geographic clustering, but at a dissagregate level.  Over 45 percent
11:310:27807:20:20:57:542:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of  the  Swedish  emigrants  from  the  parish  of  R ̈atvik  eventually  settled  in  Isanti  County,  Minnesota
11:311:27920:20:21:57:542:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(Ostergren 1976).  Two-thirds of the emigrants from Balestrand located in Norway Grove, Wisconsin
11:312:28017:21:20:57:542:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the first decade of migration from that Norwegian community (Gjerde 1985).  And one-third to one-
11:313:28117:20:20:57:542:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:half of the German emigrants from Westerkappeln settled in Duden County, Missouri (Kamphoefner
11:314:28211:20:21:57:542:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1987).  Although less detailed origin-country information is available for southern European migrants,
11:315:28313:21:20:57:542:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:similar  ethnic  clustering  in  particular  neighborhoods  of  Midwestern  cities  has  been  documented  for
11:316:28423:20:20:57:542:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Polish, Italian, and Slovak immigrants from specific sending regions (Alexander 1991, Bodnar, Simon,
11:317:28523:20:21:57:142:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and Weber 1982).
11:318:28539:21:20:74:542:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A possibly stronger indicator of the importance of migrant networks is the maintenance of ethnic

11:320:28743:20:21:57:542:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:“Italian Hill” in St.  Louis when coal mining operations were reduced in the 1920’s and Slavs moved
11:321:28842:21:20:57:542:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from  mines  in  Western  Pennsylvania  to  Detroit’s  growing  automobile  industry  in  the  same  decade
11:322:28949:20:20:57:542:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(Bodnar 1985).  Norwegians from Balestrand initially settled in Norway Grove, Wisconsin, but over
11:323:29046:20:20:57:542:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:time they established six satellite settlements in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, and Illinois (Gjerde 1985).
11:324:29152:20:21:57:542:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A similar pattern has been documented for Norwegians immigrants from Fortun, who initially settled
11:325:29250:21:20:57:542:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in  Vernon  and  Crawford  Counties,  Missouri,  but  later  established  satellite  communities  throughout

11:327:29384:20:21:74:542:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:While the preceding descriptions of ethnic clustering are informative, ethnic concentration within
11:328:29482:21:20:57:542:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:specific departments or firms in a local industry provides possibly the strongest evidence that labor
11:329:29583:20:20:57:542:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:networks were active. Nearly all three thousand employees of the Peninsular Gas Company in Detroit in
11:330:29684:20:21:57:542:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1900 were Polish, and Croatians held only three jobs in Indiana’s oil refineries: stillman helper, fireman,
11:331:29791:21:20:57:542:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and still cleaner (Bodnar 1985).  Italians in Pittsburgh’s steel industry dominated the carpentry, repair,
11:332:29897:20:20:57:542:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and rail shops.  And, relying on friends and relatives, Poles established occupational niches at the Jones
11:333:30003:20:21:57:542:172:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and Laughlin and Oliver Mills on Pittsburgh’s Southside, Heppenstalls and the Pennsylvania Railroad
11:334:30102:21:20:57:542:151:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in Lawrenceville, and at the Armstrong Cork Company and the H.J. Heinz Plant.  As John K. a Polish

11:337:30347:21:0:74:542:90:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:What kept ethnic networks in place so far from their origin locations?  It has been argued that

12:340:30645:21:20:57:542:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:building of a church was one of the first organized actions in the migrant community once it arrived in
12:341:30748:20:20:57:542:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:an area (Barton 1975, Bodnar, Simon, and Weber 1982).  Churches provided both economic and social
12:342:30845:20:21:57:542:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:support to their members.  Information about jobs and potential land transactions flowed within the
12:343:30944:21:20:57:542:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:congregation and the church also served as a public arena in which members who had reneged on their
12:344:31043:20:20:57:210:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:obligations could be sanctioned.
12:345:31075:20:21:74:542:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Given  the  variety  of  economic  opportunities  in  the  United  States,  individuals  and  small  groups
12:346:31182:21:20:57:542:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:drawn from the same origin community in Europe often had an incentive to move and seek employment
12:347:31279:20:20:57:542:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:elsewhere.  The stability of thelocalcommunity in the United States was thus essential for the viability
12:348:31383:20:21:57:542:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the labor market network.  One strategy to maintain stability would have been to instill a sense
12:349:31482:21:20:57:542:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of loyalty to this community.  The discussion that follows will discuss how efforts to engender a sense
12:350:31585:20:20:57:542:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of local identity by the church and the institutions that formed around it might have varied across

12:362:32612:21:20:57:542:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a network had established a presence in the labor market, it was essential tomaintainthat presence.

13:412:34041:20:20:57:542:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is associated with a greater marginal cost of exit regardless of whether the returns to network size are

13:414:34244:21:20:57:542:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with greater ethnic competition should have invested more in instilling a sense of local identity and in
13:415:34348:20:20:57:283:343:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:building well functioning parochial institutions.
13:416:34397:20:20:74:542:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To measure ethnic competition we assume that networks were most active in the migrant population
13:417:34493:20:21:57:542:303:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and that they were organized on the basis of the country of origin.  Recall that the migrant church
13:418:34592:21:20:57:542:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:brought individuals from different communities in the origin country together into a large and stable
13:419:34693:20:20:57:542:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:network.  Numerous accounts of occupational mobility in the nineteenth century indicate that although
13:420:34794:20:21:57:542:242:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:networks supported the movement of their members across establishments and even across industries,
13:421:34892:21:20:57:542:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:migrants  could rarely  change  the  type  or  skill-level  of their  jobs.  Competition  between networks  is
13:422:35002:20:20:57:501:201:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:consequently assumed to occur within the broad occupational categories specified in Table 2.
13:423:35094:20:21:74:542:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Because networks vary in size in practice, we use a standard measure of fractionalization, defined
13:424:35192:21:14:57:542:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as  one  minus  the  Herfindahl  index  of  ethnic  concentration,  to  measure  competition.5The  IPUMS
13:425:35296:14:15:70:542:146:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:4Tullock’s  specification  is  identical  to  the  equation  above  except  that  the  number  of  workers  is  replaced  by  the
13:426:35425:15:7:57:165:131:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:investment in rent seeking.
13:427:35452:7:15:70:542:124:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:5The Herfindahl index of ethnic concentration is computed as the sum of the squared share of each ethnicity in the
13:428:35566:15:11:57:542:109:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:occupational  category.   It  is  easy  to  verify  that  for  the  special  case  with  networks  of  equal  size,  the  fractionalization
13:429:35705:11:11:57:542:98:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:measure  is  equal  to  1−N2/M,  which  is  increasing  in  the  number  of  communitiesM,  for  a  given  number  of  migrant

14:432:35953:20:21:57:542:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:these data, we compute ethnic fractionalization in each occupational category in each Midwest county

14:434:36158:20:20:57:542:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:share of migrants in the occupation, then provides us with an overall measure of ethnic fractionalization
14:435:36263:20:21:57:542:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the county.  Figure 2 plots the fractionalization measure, which has a mean of 0.5 and a standard
14:436:36363:21:20:57:542:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:deviation  of  0.2,  across  the  seven  Midwest  states.   Counties  that  were  not  incorporated  and  those
14:437:36474:20:20:57:542:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:without  foreign-born  migrants  in  1860  are  unshaded  in  the  Figure.   Although  there  is  substantial
14:438:36583:20:21:57:542:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:variation in the fractionalization measure, which is useful for the statistical tests that follow, no spatial
14:439:36692:21:20:57:212:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:clustering is evident in Figure 2.
14:440:36726:20:20:74:542:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:While we focus on the effect of ethnic fractionalization in strengthening within-group solidarity,
14:441:36824:20:21:57:542:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:fractionalization could at the same time undermine the functioning of secular institutions.  Public ser-
14:442:36928:21:20:57:542:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:vices were provided at a rudimentary level in 1860 and the first investments in secondary schooling,
14:443:37028:20:20:57:542:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for example, occurred more than 50 years later (Goldin and Katz 1999).  Given the weak serial corre-
14:444:37128:20:21:57:542:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:lation in the fractionalization variable, we do not expect 1860 fractionalization to have been strongly
14:445:37231:21:20:57:542:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:correlated with heterogeneity in the community many decades later, when it may have mattered for

14:455:38146:21:20:57:542:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:expenditures on local public goods in 1990 once a few important characteristics of the 1860 economy
14:456:38245:20:20:57:542:176:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are controlled for.  More stringent tests ruling out a link between 1860 fractionalization and current
14:457:38347:20:21:57:282:156:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:economic conditions are discussed in Section 5.
14:458:38394:21:20:74:542:135:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Ethnic labor networks are no longer active in the American Midwest. Nevertheless, fractionalization
14:459:38493:20:20:57:542:115:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in  1860  could  have  been  correlated  with  particular  features  of  the  economy  at  the  time  of  initial
14:460:38606:20:0:57:542:95:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:settlement  that  had  persistent  effects.   To  explore  this  possibility,  we  proceed  to  understand  what
15:461:38720:0:20:57:542:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:determined  fractionalization  in  the  first  place.   In  a  rapidly  expanding  Midwest  economy,  some  of
15:462:38830:20:21:57:542:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the  variation  in  fractionalization  across  counties  was  no  doubt  a  consequence  of  accidental  initial
15:463:38942:21:20:57:542:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:settlement  by  ethnic  groups  in  particular  locations,  which  fueled  the  arrival  of  more  migrants  as
15:464:39053:20:20:57:542:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:networks crystallized.  At the same time, fractionalization would have been determined by the demand
15:465:39153:20:21:57:542:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for  labor,  with  more  ethnic  groups  attracted  to  rapidly  growing  areas.   We  have  already  discussed
15:466:39264:21:20:57:542:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the importance of transportation links in the development of the Midwest and Table 3 consequently
15:467:39361:20:20:57:542:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:investigates the effect of railroads and distance to canals and a Great Lakes harbor on fractionalization
15:468:39466:20:21:57:542:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in 1860.6Counties with a railroad running through them and counties that are closer to a canal or
15:469:39563:21:20:57:542:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:harbor have significantly higher fractionalization in Table 3, Column 1.  Counties close to a harbor had
15:470:39667:20:20:57:542:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a greater proportion of the workforce engaged in manufacturing and a smaller proportion in agriculture
15:471:39769:20:21:57:542:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in 1860 in Table 3, Columns 2-3.  Improved transportation, more generally, is associated with a larger
15:472:39871:21:20:57:212:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:population in 1860 in Column 4.
15:473:39902:20:20:74:542:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Notice that the pattern of coefficients in Table 3, Column 1 with fractionalization as the dependent
15:474:40002:20:21:57:542:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:variable matches perfectly with the corresponding pattern in Column 4 with county population as the
15:475:40101:21:20:57:542:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:dependent variable.  Counties with superior transportation infrastructure, which were more populated
15:476:40201:20:20:57:542:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and presumably growing more rapidly, were more fractionalized in 1860.  The population of the county
15:477:40301:20:20:57:542:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in 1860 could have determined subsequent agglomeration in economic activity, with long-term implica-
15:478:40401:20:21:57:542:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tions for the growth of the local economy.  Not surprisingly, we see in Table 4, Columns 1-3 that while
15:479:40504:21:20:57:542:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1860 fractionalization has an insignificant effect on 1990 agriculture share and manufacturing share, it
15:480:40608:20:20:57:542:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is significantly and positively associated with current county population as well as population density
15:481:40711:20:21:57:542:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(not reported).  More urban counties will be more racially and ethnically diverse, and it follows that
15:482:40813:21:20:57:542:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1860 fractionalization is significantly and positively correlated with racial fractionalization in 1990 in
15:483:40919:20:20:57:111:253:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:Column 5.7
15:484:40929:20:21:74:542:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We expect the fractionalization effect to disappear once important features of the local economy
15:485:41025:21:16:57:542:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that would directly determine economic activity today, such as manufacturing share, agriculture share,
15:486:41127:16:14:70:542:196:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:6Data on the distance to the nearest canal (or navigable river) and the nearest Great Lakes harbor is obtained from
15:487:41242:14:11:57:542:182:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:Jordan Rappaport’s website at the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank.  The distance is computed in each case from the
15:488:41357:11:8:57:122:171:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:county centroid.
15:489:41373:8:14:70:542:163:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:7The manufacturing share in 1990 is defined as the share of the civilian labor force employed in manufacturing in that
15:490:41491:14:11:57:542:149:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:year.  The agriculture share in 1990 is computed using the farm population and the total population in the county in that
15:491:41612:11:11:57:542:138:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:year.  All these statistics, as well as the area of each county used to compute the population density, are obtained from
15:492:41733:11:11:57:542:127:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:the 1994 County Data Book, compiled by the U.S. Bureau of the Census.  Racial fractionalization is computed from the
15:493:41849:11:11:57:542:116:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:1990 IPUMS as one minus the Herfindahl index of racial concentration, using the same five racial groups as in Alesina,
15:494:41967:11:11:57:542:105:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:Baqir, and Hoxby (2004).  Ethnic fractionalization is computed from the 1990 IPUMS as one minus the Herfindahl index
15:495:42083:11:0:57:441:94:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:of racial concentration, using the same 16 white ethnic groups as in Alesina, Baqir, and Hoxby.
16:496:42180:0:20:57:542:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and particularly population in 1860, are accounted for.  The fractionalization coefficient is indeed small
16:497:42286:20:21:57:542:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and  insignificant  in  Columns  7-11  of  Table  4,  once  the  county  controls  are  included.   In  contrast,
16:498:42399:21:20:57:542:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:agricultural counties in 1860 continue to be agricultural in 1990 and more populated counties in 1860
16:499:42500:20:20:57:542:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:remain larger in 1990.  Notice, however, that manufacturing in 1860 does not have a persistent effect.
16:500:42602:20:21:57:542:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Although  the  factory  system  began  to  replace  artisan  shops  by  1820,  production  continued  to  be
16:501:42710:21:20:57:542:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:largely  organized  in  workshops  managed  by  labor  contractors  who  hired  their  own  employees  until
16:502:42818:20:20:57:542:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1870 (Gordon, Edwards, and Reich 1982).  The heavy manufacturing that characterized the Midwest
16:503:42913:20:21:57:542:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:economy in the twentieth century, with its emphasis on the iron and steel industry, only came at the
16:504:43013:21:20:57:542:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:turn of the century (Meyer 1989).  Recently it has been argued that the surge of foreign immigration
16:505:43113:20:20:57:542:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in  the  second  half  of  the  nineteenth  century  provided  the  impetus  for  the  factory  system  and  the
16:506:43225:20:21:57:542:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:subsequent industrialization of the Midwest (Kim 2007).  Whatever the explanation,  it is clear that
16:507:43325:21:20:57:542:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the pattern of manufacturing around 1860, spread throughout the Midwest in small towns, had little
16:508:43423:20:20:57:542:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:connection with the heavy manufacturing, concentrated in large cities, that followed in the twentieth
16:509:43524:20:21:57:542:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:century.  This is presumably why 1860 characteristics have such little power in predicting the share of
16:510:43627:21:20:57:234:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:manufacturing in the county in 1990.
16:511:43663:20:20:74:542:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:For our purpose,  what is important is that once we control for a few features of the nineteenth
16:512:43759:20:20:57:542:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:century economy, fractionalization in 1860 has no effect on characteristics of the economy today, such as
16:513:43864:20:21:57:542:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the share of manufacturing and urbanization (measured by total population or by population density),
16:514:43964:21:20:57:542:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that  are  associated  with  the  demand  for  professional  labor.   All  of  the  regressions  that  follow  will
16:515:44079:20:20:57:542:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:consequently  include  these  important  features  of  the  1860  economy  as  controls.   Notice,  however,
16:516:44187:20:21:57:542:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that more ethnically fractionalized counties in 1860 have significantlylowerreligious fractionalization
16:517:44290:21:20:57:542:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in  1990,  with  and  without  the  controls  in  Column  6  and  Column  12.8This  result,  which  stands
16:518:44396:20:20:57:542:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:conspicuously apart from the other regressions reported in Table 4 will be clarified in the discussion
16:519:44498:20:21:57:393:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on the church and the persistence of identity that follows in Section 3.
16:520:44570:21:20:74:542:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We complete this section by describing the relationship between local public good provision in 1990
16:521:44669:20:20:57:542:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and ethnic fractionalization in 1860 in Table 5.  Local government expenditures per capita in 1990 are
16:522:44771:20:21:57:542:172:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:regressed on ethnic fractionalization, manufacturing share, agriculture share, and county population
16:523:44871:21:20:57:542:151:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in  1860  in  Column  1.   Retaining  the  same  set  of  regressors,  the  dependent  variable  is  the  share  of
16:524:44986:20:16:57:542:131:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:expenditure allocated to education, health, police, roads, and welfare in Columns 2-6.9The expenditure
16:525:45088:16:15:70:542:115:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:8Religious fractionalization is computed from the 1990 Census of Religious Bodies as one minus the Herfindahl index
16:526:45203:15:7:57:497:100:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:of religious concentration, using the same 18 religious denominations as in Alesina, Baqir, and Hoxby (2004).
16:527:45312:7:0:70:542:93:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:9These data are obtained from the Annual Survey of Governments, 1990.  Alesina, Baqir, and Easterly (1999) use data
17:528:45429:0:20:57:542:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:shares for these five public goods add up to 0.79, with the education share being as large as 0.6.  The
17:529:45532:20:21:57:542:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:other shares range from 0.03 to 0.07.  Given that the standard deviation of the fractionalization variable
17:530:45638:21:20:57:542:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is 0.2, it is evident from the point estimates that 1860 fractionalization has a negligible effect on public
17:531:45746:20:20:57:542:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:good provision today.  Using the same shares, Alesina, Baqir, and Easterly (1999) document a negative
17:532:45847:20:21:57:542:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and  significant  relationship  between  contemporaneous  racial  fractionalization  and  the  allocation  of
17:533:45956:21:20:57:542:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:resources to certain public goods, particularly education, roads, and welfare.  We have already shown
17:534:46057:20:20:57:542:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that  1860  ethnic  fractionalization  is  uncorrelated  with  1990  racial  fractionalization  in  Table  4,  and
17:535:46171:20:21:57:542:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:not surprisingly we see in Table 5 that historical ethnic fractionalization has no effect on current local
17:536:46277:21:33:57:327:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:public good provision, including education expenditures.
17:537:46333:33:32:57:389:504:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:3  The Church and the Persistence of Identity
17:538:46378:32:20:57:542:472:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In a recent paper, Akerlof and Kranton (2005) describe how firms and other economic organizations
17:539:46475:20:20:57:542:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:can instill a sense of identity or loyalty among their workers to solve agency problems.  In our setting,
17:540:46580:20:21:57:542:432:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the natural organization to instill loyalty in the community would have been the local church.  The
17:541:46679:21:20:57:542:411:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:church was among the first institutions to be established when immigrants arrived in an area (Hoerder
17:542:46780:20:20:57:542:391:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1991, Barton 1975, Bodnar, Simon, and Weber 1982).  The church congregation provided many forms
17:543:46875:20:20:57:542:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of mutual assistance including credit, insurance, job referrals, business information, and social support
17:544:46980:20:21:57:542:351:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(Gjerde  1985,  1997,  Alexander  1991).   Indeed,  it  has  been  argued  that  immigrants  participated  in
17:545:47089:21:20:57:542:330:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:church communities to benefit from these economic and social services, instead of being drawn to the
17:546:47189:20:20:57:324:310:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:church by a particular belief or ideology (Bodnar 1985).
17:547:47245:20:21:74:542:290:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Despite these material attractions, exit from the church and the local labor market was always a
17:548:47341:21:20:57:542:269:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:threat in nineteenth century America, especially in areas that had been recently settled.  There was a
17:549:47443:20:20:57:542:249:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tension between a “folk society” centered around the church parish and a competitive “individualistic
17:550:47544:20:21:57:542:229:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:society” with its many opportunities (Ostergren 1976).  In addition, migration to the United States,
17:551:47644:21:20:57:542:208:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and subsequent internal migration, was often organized under the auspices of relatively small commu-
17:552:47744:20:20:57:542:188:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:nities from the origin country.  These migrant networks were too small to maintain a viable church
17:553:47842:20:21:57:542:168:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:congregation  and  labor  network  when  they  first  arrived  in  an  area  and  so  churches  in  the  Midwest
17:554:47954:21:20:57:542:147:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:typically brought together many regional groups with the same national origin.  Inter-regional conflict
17:555:48057:20:20:57:542:127:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:was common, and there was always the possibility that groups within the church would move again
17:556:48152:20:20:57:542:107:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to take advantage of new opportunities that became available elsewhere (Gjerde 1997).  Under these

18:558:48279:0:20:57:542:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:circumstances, the church had to make a special (costly) effort to instill a sense of loyalty to the local
18:559:48385:20:21:57:485:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:community among its members that transcended individual, kin, and regional affiliations.
18:560:48473:21:20:74:542:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:If  local  identity  played  a  role  in  reducing  exit  in  the  nineteenth  century,  how  and  why  did  it
18:561:48584:20:20:57:542:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:persist long after the ethnic labor networks it supported ceased to be salient?  Our explanation for this
18:562:48689:20:21:57:542:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:persistence is based on the observation that churches continue to provide important forms of social
18:563:48788:21:20:57:542:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:support to their members.  Church activities include Sunday school service, youth groups, pot-lucks,
18:564:48888:20:20:57:542:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:informal home parties, and food, visits, and other forms of support when members of the congregation
18:565:48988:20:21:57:542:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are ailing or infirm.  The church also lies at the center of a cluster of inter-linked civic institutions,
18:566:49094:21:20:57:542:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:including the school and various voluntary organizations. Life in a Midwest community revolves around
18:567:49195:20:20:57:542:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:these  institutions,  which  bring  families  and  multiple  generations  together  on  a  regular  basis  (Elder
18:568:49308:20:21:57:542:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and Conger 2000).  We focus on the church in the analysis that follows with the understanding that
18:569:49406:21:20:57:542:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:individuals  participate  in  and  benefit  from  a  wider  range  of  related  institutions;  well  functioning
18:570:49518:20:20:57:463:456:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:churches will in general be associated with tight-knit well functioning communities.10
18:571:49604:20:21:74:542:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:There are complementarities associated with church inputs; if the rest of the congregation commits
18:572:49702:21:20:57:542:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:time  and  effort  to  the  church,  then  the  returns  to  the  individual’s  inputs  would  increase  as  well
18:573:49815:20:20:57:542:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(Iannaccone  1998).   The  presence  of  these  complementarities  introduces  two  problems.   First,  self-
18:574:49924:20:20:57:542:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:interested individuals will devote a level of inputs that is sub-optimal because they do not internalize
18:575:50028:20:21:57:542:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the  benefits  that  the  rest  of  the  congregation  derives  from  their  actions.   Second,  a  coordination
18:576:50140:21:20:57:542:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:problem can arise since individuals will only make career choices that are associated with a high level
18:577:50243:20:20:57:542:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of commitment to the church if they expect other members of their generation, who are simultaneously
18:578:50343:20:21:57:542:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:making these choices, to do likewise.  A strong sense of local identity reduces each of these problems,
18:579:50446:21:20:57:542:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:serving as a commitment device and increasing the level of church inputs in equilibrium.  Given that
18:580:50546:20:20:57:542:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:church  inputs  are  complements,  it  is  easy  to  verify  that  the  older  generation  in  a  church  with  a
18:581:50659:20:21:57:542:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:committed  congregation  will  be  more  willing  to  bear  the  cost  of  instilling  a  strong  sense  of  local
18:582:50773:21:20:57:542:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:identity in the generation that follows, resulting in a higher level of inputs.  Local identity and church
18:583:50879:20:16:57:441:192:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:inputs can reinforce each other in this way over many overlapping generations.11
18:584:50959:16:15:66:542:176:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:10The number of civic and social associations in the county and the corresponding number of religious organizations
18:585:51074:15:11:57:542:161:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:can  be  obtained  from  the  County  Business  Patterns,  1990.   The  number  of  not-for-profit  organizations  in  the  county
18:586:51204:11:11:57:542:150:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:can be obtained from National Center for Charitable Statistics Core Files, 1990.  Controlling for manufacturing share,
18:587:51322:11:11:57:542:139:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:agriculture  share,  and  county  population  in  1860,  ethnic  fractionalization  in  that  year  has  no  effect  on  any  of  these
18:588:51457:11:11:57:542:128:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:variables.  Note, however, that these statistics are based on thenumberof organizations, whereas what we require are
18:589:51573:11:11:57:542:117:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:measures ofparticipation.  For example, we will see below that 1860 fractionalization has a significant and positive effect
18:590:51696:11:7:57:524:106:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:on religious participation in 1990 despite the fact that it is uncorrelated with the number of religious organizations.
18:591:51815:7:0:66:542:99:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:11The persistence in local identity that we describe is related to a paper by B ́enabou and Tirole (2006) linking invest-
19:592:51938:0:20:74:542:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Local identity and church inputs cannot be observed directly.  However, we do observe the num-
19:593:52032:20:21:57:542:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ber of church participants across counties and over time.  Assuming heterogeneity in the payoff from
19:594:52132:21:20:57:542:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:non-participation in the population, it follows that well functioning churches will have larger congre-
19:595:52235:20:20:57:542:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:gations.  The testable prediction from the preceding discussion is that high fractionalization counties
19:596:52338:20:21:57:542:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:should begin with stronger local identity, a higher level of church inputs and, hence, greater church
19:597:52439:21:20:57:542:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:participation  at  the  time  of  settlement.   More  importantly,  the  effect  of  fractionalization  on  church
19:598:52553:20:20:57:542:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:participation should grow over time, reflecting the underlying divergence in church performance that is
19:599:52656:20:21:57:542:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:necessary to sustain differences in local identity.  This prediction distinguished our model, with identity
19:600:52763:21:20:57:542:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as a commitment device,  from the model of religious cults proposed by Iannaccone (1992) in which
19:601:52860:20:20:57:542:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:self-sacrifice and strict norms of behavior are used to screen out free-riders and ensure higher levels of
19:602:52966:20:21:57:542:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:participation among those that remain.  While this alternative mechanism may induce high levels of
19:603:53064:21:20:57:525:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:participation at the intensive margin, it results in small congregations and is typically short-lived.
19:604:53166:20:20:74:542:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Up to this point we have not distinguished between different religious denominations.  Based on
19:605:53261:20:21:57:542:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the  country  of  origin  of  the  incoming  migrants,  reported  in  Table  1,  most  of  the  migrant  churches
19:606:53374:21:20:57:542:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:would have been Lutheran or Catholic.  Regressing the population-share of different denominations,
19:607:53472:20:20:57:542:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:computed with data from the Census of Religious Bodies in 1860,  on the share of migrants in that
19:608:53569:20:20:57:542:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:year, counties with a greater share of migrants are indeed disproportionately Lutheran and Catholic.  A
19:609:53672:20:21:57:542:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:strong test of our framework, which relies on the role of migrant churches in shaping and maintaining
19:610:53773:21:20:57:542:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:local identity, is that the predictions derived above should apply to those migrant denominations only.
19:611:53876:20:20:57:542:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In particular, higher fractionalization counties should be associated with a greater share of Lutherans
19:612:53979:20:21:57:542:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and Catholics in the population around the time of initial settlement and this effect of fractionalization
19:613:54085:21:20:57:542:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:should grow stronger over time.  In contrast, the model has no prediction for the relationship between
19:614:54187:20:20:57:542:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:fractionalization  and  participation  in  other  denominations,  providing  us  with  a  useful  falsification
19:615:54298:20:18:57:86:233:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:test.12
19:616:54305:18:11:57:542:215:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:ments in human capital at the household level with the political equilibrium at the macro level.  In their model, children
19:617:54427:11:11:57:542:204:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:choose a level of effort (schooling) based on their belief about the returns to this effort.  If a sufficiently large number
19:618:54551:11:11:57:542:193:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:of households invest in effort, they will form a pivotal voting block and set a low tax rate, generating, in turn, a high
19:619:54672:11:11:57:542:182:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:return to effort that reinforces the initial beliefs.  Thus, two political equilibria can arise; a low-effort equilibrium with
19:620:54798:11:11:57:542:171:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:substantial redistribution (high taxes) and a high-effort equilibrium with little redistribution (low taxes).  B ́enabou and
19:621:54922:11:11:57:542:160:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:Tirole fix the equilibrium by assuming that children have imperfect willpower and so will underinvest in effort if left to
19:622:55044:11:11:57:542:149:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:themselves.  Their parents, who provide them with information about the returns to effort, will consequently systemati-
19:623:55163:11:11:57:542:138:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:cally inflate these returns.  This “ideological” position leads parents in the high-effort equilibrium to (optimally) ignore
19:624:55287:11:11:57:542:127:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:negative signals about the returns to effort, allowing particular equilibria and the collective beliefs that support them to
19:625:55411:11:11:57:542:116:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:persist over many generations.  In this paper we use local identity rather than ideology to fix the level of church inputs
19:626:55533:11:7:57:281:105:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:and sustain a social equilibrium over many generations.
19:627:55588:7:0:66:542:98:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:12The implicit assumption underlying these predictions is that the mapping from church inputs to participation should
20:628:55707:0:20:74:542:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The relationship between ethnic fractionalization and religious participation can be tested with data
20:629:55808:20:21:57:542:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from the Census of Religious Bodies (CRB), which has been conducted at roughly ten-year intervals
20:630:55905:21:20:57:542:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from 1860 to 2000.  This census was conducted as part of the population census from 1860 to 1890,
20:631:56002:20:20:57:542:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with census enumerators collecting information from individual churches in each county.  Subsequently,
20:632:56104:20:21:57:542:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the  U.S.  Bureau  of  the  Census  conducted  the  CRB  separately  from  the  population  census  in  1906,
20:633:56213:21:20:57:542:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1916, 1926, and 1936.  Starting from 1952, the National Council of Churches of Christ undertook the
20:634:56312:20:20:57:533:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:responsibility of conducting the CRB, with subsequent census rounds in 1972, 1980, 1990 and 2000.
20:635:56409:20:21:74:542:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The 1860-1890 census rounds collected information on the number of church seats by denomination
20:636:56504:21:20:57:542:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in each county.  From 1890 onwards,  information was collected on the number of members directly,
20:637:56601:20:20:57:542:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and from 1972 onwards the number of adherents was collected as well.  Despite these changes in the
20:638:56699:20:21:57:542:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:management of the CRB and the measure of religious participation, we uncover clear changes in the
20:639:56796:21:20:57:542:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:mix of denominations as well as the effect of 1860 fractionalization on religious participation over time.
20:640:56902:20:20:74:542:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Table 6 reports changes in the mix of denominations and overall participation rates in our Midwest-
20:641:57001:20:21:57:542:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ern counties over the 1860-2000 period.  To take account of the fact that the measure of participation
20:642:57103:21:20:57:542:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:was changing over time, we report statistics in the first and the last census-year that each measure was
20:643:57207:20:20:57:542:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:used.  Thus, participation is measured by the number of church seats from 1860 to 1890, by the number
20:644:57308:20:20:57:542:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of members from 1890 to 1952, and by the number of adherents from 1972 to 2000.13The participation
20:645:57406:20:21:57:542:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rate is then computed as the number of participants divided by the contemporaneous population in the
20:646:57506:21:20:57:542:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:county.  Five denominations – Baptist, Catholic, Lutheran, Methodist, and Presbyterian – account for
20:647:57606:20:20:57:542:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:roughly 80 percent of church participants over the 1860-2000 period.  Among these denominations, the
20:648:57706:20:21:57:542:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Lutherans grow rapidly in popularity over the 1860-1890 period and the 1890-1952 period, remaining
20:649:57804:21:20:57:542:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:stable thereafter.  In contrast, the Methodists and the Presbyterians decline steadily over time.  There
20:650:57908:20:20:57:323:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is no clear trend among the Baptists and the Catholics.
20:651:57963:20:21:74:542:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The inability of the Baptist church to increase its share of church participants contrasts with the
20:652:58062:21:20:57:542:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:surge  in  popularity  of  this  denomination  elsewhere  in  the  United  States,  as  documented  by  Finke
20:653:58171:20:20:57:542:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and Stark (1992).  The Midwest stands apart from the rest of the country in that the “traditional”
20:654:58269:20:11:57:542:172:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:not  vary  with  fractionalization.   Fractionalization  in  1860  was  correlated  with  characteristics  of  the  local  economy  at
20:655:58403:11:11:57:542:161:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:that time and,  hence,  with the characteristics of the incoming migrants,  potentially violating this assumption.  Given
20:656:58524:11:11:57:542:150:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:the dynamic nature of the economy at the time of initial settlement,  however,  1860 fractionalization would soon have
20:657:58642:11:11:57:542:139:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:been uncorrelated with population characteristics and we expect the predictions for participation to hold up within a few
20:658:58763:11:7:57:122:128:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:decades of 1860.
20:659:58779:7:15:66:542:121:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:13Although the number of members was also collected in the 1972-2000 census rounds, this statistic is not available for
20:660:58898:15:0:57:372:106:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:Catholics, a major denomination in our Midwestern counties, in these rounds.
21:661:58976:0:20:57:542:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:denominations, particularly the Catholics and the Lutherans, continue to dominate and we will connect
21:662:59077:20:21:57:542:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:this observation to the link between migrants churches, local identity, and religious participation below.
21:663:59183:21:20:57:542:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Even without the Baptist surge, religious participation increased steadily over time in the Midwest,
21:664:59283:20:20:57:542:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rising over the 1860-1890 and 1890-1952 periods.  Based on the statistics in the most recent 1972-2000
21:665:59385:20:21:57:483:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:period, 55-60 percent of the population in our Midwestern counties are church adherents.
21:666:59473:21:20:74:542:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We now proceed to estimate the relationship between ethnic fractionalization in 1860 and religious
21:667:59571:20:20:57:542:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:participation in the county in each round of the CRB. The religious participation regression includes the
21:668:59676:20:21:57:542:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:same set of county-level controls as the regressions in Table 4, Columns 7-12 and Table 5.  Because the
21:669:59779:21:20:57:542:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:regression is estimated over many census years, we simply report the 1860 fractionalization coefficient,
21:670:59883:20:20:57:542:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:together with the 95 percent confidence band, in each census year in Figure 3.  This coefficient is less
21:671:59987:20:21:57:542:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:precisely estimated in the early census years, but grows steadily larger, while remaining statistically
21:672:60090:21:20:57:256:476:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:significant, all the way through to 2000.14
21:673:60133:20:20:74:542:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A  stronger  test  of  our  framework  is  that  its  predictions  should  only  apply  to  participation  in
21:674:60242:20:21:57:542:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:migrant denominations.  We consequently proceed to estimate two separate regressions in each census
21:675:60341:21:20:57:542:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:year; the first regression has the share of Lutherans and Catholics in the population as the dependent
21:676:60443:20:20:57:542:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:variable and the second regression has the share of all other denominations as the dependent variable.
21:677:60545:20:20:57:542:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The 1860 fractionalization coefficient, with the corresponding 95 percent confidence band, is reported
21:678:60647:20:21:57:542:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for  each  regression  in  each  census  year  in  Figure  4.   We  now  see  that  the  share  of  Lutherans  and
21:679:60761:21:20:57:542:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Catholics in the population is significantly greater in high fractionalization counties by 1870 and that
21:680:60865:20:20:57:542:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the  fractionalization  effect  gets  steadily  larger  over  time,  as  predicted.   Although  we  do  not  report
21:681:60980:20:21:57:542:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:results separately by denomination, this pattern is obtained for both the Catholics and the Lutherans.
21:682:61082:21:20:57:542:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A  one  standard  deviation  decline  in  1860  fractionalization  would  increase  the  population  share  of
21:683:61192:20:20:57:542:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Lutherans and Catholics in the county by four percentage points (22 percent) in 2000.  In contrast,
21:684:61291:20:21:57:542:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the fractionalization coefficient isnegativeand significant, and very stable over time, in the companion
21:685:61395:21:16:57:542:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:regression.   These  results,  taken  together,  provide  a  simple  explanation  for  the  negative  correlation
21:686:61508:16:14:66:542:196:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:14The 1860 fractionalization coefficient with standard error in parentheses is -0.66(0.39).  This outlying coefficient is
21:687:61629:14:11:57:542:182:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:omitted  from  Figure  3  and  Figure  4  that  follows  to  clarify  changes  in  the  fractionalization  coefficient  over  time.   As
21:688:61765:11:11:57:542:171:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:noted, church seats and the number of members are both available in the 1890 CRB. We use the first statistic to measure
21:689:61884:11:11:57:542:160:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:church participation in Figure 3 and Figure 4 because it is more in line with trends in the fractionalization coefficient
21:690:62005:11:11:57:542:149:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:over time.  Although not reported, the coefficient on 1860 agriculture share is also positive and significant in the religious
21:691:62131:11:11:57:542:138:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:participation regressions and grows larger over time.  Unlike ethnic fractionalization,  which soon ceased to be directly
21:692:62252:11:11:57:542:127:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:relevant,  recall from Table 4 that agricultural counties in 1860 remained disproportionately agricultural in 1990.  It is
21:693:62374:11:11:57:542:116:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:well known that farming communities tend to be more religious and community-oriented and so the persistent effect of
21:694:62490:11:0:57:516:105:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:the 1860 agriculture share may simply reflect the persistence of agricultural activity in particular areas over time.
22:695:62609:0:20:57:542:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:between  ethnic  fractionalization  in  1860  and  religious  fractionalization  in  1990  that  we  reported  in
22:696:62722:20:21:57:95:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Table 4.
22:697:62730:21:20:74:542:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Our  explanation  for  the  pattern  in  Figure  4  for  the  migrant  denominations  is  that  the  gap  in
22:698:62838:20:20:57:542:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:church inputs between low and high fractionalization counties is widening over time, giving rise to an
22:699:62940:20:21:57:542:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:accompanying increase in the participation-gap.  An alternative explanation for this pattern is that
22:700:63040:21:20:57:542:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:there are increasing returns to scale in church performance; Lutheran and Catholic churches were large
22:701:63142:20:20:57:542:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to begin with in the high fractionalization counties and grew larger over time.  The time-trend in the
22:702:63244:20:21:57:542:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:fractionalization coefficient for the migrant and non-migrant denominations in Figure 4 would appear
22:703:63344:21:20:57:542:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to  rule  out  this  explanation;  we  should  otherwise  have  observed  a  (symmetric)  declining  trend  for
22:704:63455:20:20:57:542:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the  non-migrant  denominations.   Nevertheless,  we  experimented  with  augmented  specifications  that
22:705:63560:20:21:57:542:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:included (i) the share of Lutherans and Catholics, and (ii) a full set of 32 ethnic shares (which sum
22:706:63661:21:20:57:542:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:up to the share of migrants in the population), in 1860 by county, as regressors.  The initial share of
22:707:63764:20:20:57:542:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Lutherans  and  Catholics,  as  well  as  some  of  the  ethnic  shares  do  have  persistent  effects.   However,
22:708:63878:20:21:57:542:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the fractionalization coefficient remains stable over the course of the twentieth century with both the
22:709:63981:21:20:57:542:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:augmented specifications.  The strong and persistent relationship between 1860 fractionalization and
22:710:64081:20:20:57:542:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:church  participation  contrasts  with  the  absence  of  any  effect  of  this  variable  on  current  economic
22:711:64193:20:20:57:541:375:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:conditions in Table 4 and Table 5, once particular features of the local economy are controlled for.15
22:712:64295:20:21:57:542:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We cannot observe local identity, but to the extent that well functioning churches require committed
22:713:64395:21:20:57:542:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:congregations, this result sets the stage for the analysis of occupational choice with local identity that
22:714:64501:20:34:57:92:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:follows.
22:715:64509:34:32:57:368:280:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:4  Occupational Choice with Local Identity
22:716:64551:32:20:57:542:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:If local identity shapes occupational choice and fractionalization is uncorrelated with the demand for
22:717:64653:20:20:57:542:228:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:professional labor, then individuals born in high fractionalization counties should be less likely to choose
22:718:64761:20:21:57:542:208:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:professional careers but individuals subsequently residing in those countries should be as likely to be
22:719:64864:21:20:57:542:187:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:professionals once the market clears.  The model developed in this section and described in greater
22:720:64963:20:20:57:542:167:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:detail in the Appendix derives this joint hypothesis more formally.  It also explains why individuals
22:721:65064:20:21:57:542:147:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:born in high fractionalization counties would shade their choices towards less mobile non-professional
22:722:65166:21:16:57:542:126:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:occupations, giving rise to a surplus of non-professional labor in those counties on average, even though
22:723:65271:16:14:66:542:110:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:15The pattern of coefficients reported in Figure 4 would also be obtained if the county controls were omitted from the
22:724:65389:14:0:57:425:96:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:participation regression, although the point estimates would actually be somewhat smaller.
23:725:65481:0:20:57:542:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the labor market must ultimately clear.  The key insight is that this result will be obtained as long as
23:726:65585:20:21:57:466:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:there isex anteuncertainty in the demand for different types of jobs across locations.
23:727:65671:21:20:74:542:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The  model  is  set  up  so  that  two  types  of  jobs  are  available:  professional  and  non-professional.
23:728:65781:20:20:57:542:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Individuals who areex anteidentical live for two periods, working in the second period of their lives.
23:729:65883:20:21:57:542:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Those individuals who choose to occupy more productive professional jobs must invest in training in
23:730:65982:21:20:57:542:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the first period of their lives.  Individuals who expect to end up in non-professional jobs incur no such
23:731:66087:20:20:57:542:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cost.  There are two locations in this economy withNindividuals born in each location in each period.

23:733:66280:21:20:57:542:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in each period.  However,  these locations also face positive and negative demand shocks with equal
23:734:66379:20:20:57:542:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:probability, which separately shift the demand for professional and non-professional labor by-sNand

23:737:66633:20:20:74:542:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Once demand shocks are introduced, labor must flow across locations at the beginning of each period
23:738:66732:20:21:57:542:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to clear the market. In addition, we assume that professional jobs have an individual-specific component
23:739:66836:21:20:57:542:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to them.  The opportunity to enhance overall productivity by switching a professional working in a
23:740:66934:20:20:57:542:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:particular location with a professional working in the other location arrives with probabilityPin each
23:741:67036:20:20:57:542:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:period.  This additional dimension of mobility in professional occupations is based on the idea that
23:742:67136:20:21:57:542:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the labor market for a school teacher or a secretary tends to be local.  In contrast, professionals such
23:743:67240:21:20:57:542:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as university professors or management consultants are continually re-sorting across local and regional
23:744:67343:20:20:57:542:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:labor markets as new opportunities arise and fresh cohorts of workers enter.  A professional can advance
23:745:67447:20:21:57:542:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:her career considerably with such a move if it becomes available and we will later see that professionals
23:746:67552:21:20:57:375:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are indeed much more likely to migrate from their county of birth.
23:747:67618:20:20:74:542:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Individuals dislike moving, particularly those with a strong local identity.  Let the cost of moving be
23:748:67721:20:21:57:542:233:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f3:C1for individuals born in location 1 andC2< C1for individuals born in location 2 with weaker local
23:749:67819:21:20:57:542:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:identity.  This is the only difference between workers in the two locations.  We assume that all workers
23:750:67923:20:20:57:542:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are employed and that professional workers always take advantage of the productivity enhancing career
23:751:68024:20:21:57:542:172:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:opportunities when they arise, in which case total output in this economy remains constant across all
23:752:68125:21:20:57:542:151:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:states  of  the  world.   Although  wages  for  professionals  and  non-professionals  will  adjust  across  the
23:753:68237:20:16:57:542:131:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:two locations to clear the labor market in practice, the competitive labor allocation can in that case

23:755:68459:15:11:57:542:100:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:We could also allow the size of the shocks to vary,-for the professionals and-for the non-professionals, without changing
23:756:68580:11:0:57:165:89:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:the results reported below.
24:757:68609:0:20:57:542:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:be conveniently derived as the solution to the Central Planner’s problem of minimizing training and
24:758:68708:20:21:57:225:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:moving costs across both locations.
24:759:68743:21:20:74:542:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Let the supply of professional labor in location 1 bex1.  We show in the Appendix that expected
24:760:68838:20:20:57:541:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f9:cost is a piece-wise linear function ofx1, as described in Figure 5, which is minimized atx∗1=sN−-sN
24:761:68938:20:21:57:542:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:forP <1/2(C1+C2)/(C1−C2) and atx∗∗1=sN−-sN−-N(1−2s) forP >1/2(C1+C2)/(C1−C2).
24:762:69015:21:20:57:542:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The equilibrium supply of professional labor in location 1, with stronger local identity, falls short of
24:763:69119:20:20:57:542:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the expected demandsNfor all values ofP.  Moreover, the share of professionals supplied by location
24:764:69218:20:21:57:349:558:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:1 is strictly less than the corresponding share in location 2.17
24:765:69282:21:20:74:542:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The  intuition  for  this  result  is  that  as  long  as  there  isex anteuncertainty  in  the  type  of  jobs
24:766:69393:20:20:57:542:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:demanded, some individuals will have to move in both locations with positive probability to clear the
24:767:69494:20:21:57:542:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:market.  By allocating a surplus of non-professionals to location 1, the Central Planner increases the
24:768:69596:21:20:57:542:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:probability of such moves, but trades this off against the lower probability of having individuals born
24:769:69699:20:20:57:542:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in location 1 moveex poston the job.18We show in the Appendix that the supply of professionals
24:770:69793:20:21:57:542:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f9:in  location  1  could  also  fall  short  of  the  expected  demand  without  uncertainty,  but  only  ifP >

24:772:69918:20:20:74:542:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In our set up, individualsbornin location 1 are less likely to be professionals because they incur
24:773:70016:20:20:57:541:375:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:a greater cost when they move (C1> C2).  However,  this result could also be obtained ifC1=C2
24:774:70109:20:21:57:542:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and the demand for professional labor is lower in location 1,s1N < s2N.  The second prediction of
24:775:70206:21:20:57:542:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the model, which allows us to rule out this alternative demand-side explanation, is that once the labor
24:776:70309:20:20:57:543:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:market has cleared, the share of professionalsresidingin the two locations should on average be the
24:777:70408:20:21:57:543:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:same (sN).  In contrast, if the demand for professional labor is lower in location 1, then individuals
24:778:70510:21:34:57:477:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:born and subsequently residing in that location should be less likely to be professionals.

24:781:70641:27:21:57:542:187:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To test the predictions from the previous section we need information on the individual’s career choice,

24:785:71027:7:15:66:542:128:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:18The Central Planner could make adjustments on other dimensions as well, by allowing for some level of unemployment
24:786:71143:15:11:57:542:113:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:or by letting professionals born in location 1 forego career opportunities with finite probability.  Theex antecareer choices
24:787:71268:11:0:57:483:102:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:that we are interested in would nevertheless continue to vary systematically across locations as described.
25:788:71377:0:20:57:542:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Youth 1979 (NLSY79) is the only large-scale data set that we are aware of that includes this informa-
25:789:71478:20:21:57:542:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tion.  The NLSY consists of a nationally representative sample of American high school seniors in 1979
25:790:71580:21:20:57:542:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:who were subsequently interviewed annually from 1979 to 1994 and biennially thereafter.  The survey
25:791:71679:20:20:57:542:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:collects basic information on the respondent’s age, gender, race and, most importantly, county of birth.
25:792:71783:20:21:57:542:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT), which is designed to provide an unbiased measure of
25:793:71878:21:20:57:542:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the individual’s intelligence, was administered to all respondents in 1979.  Subsequent survey rounds
25:794:71979:20:20:57:542:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:collected contemporaneous information on educational attainment, employment, occupation, income,
25:795:72075:20:21:57:542:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and county of residence.  We will study occupational choice and other outcomes related to that eco-
25:796:72174:21:20:57:542:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:nomic decision at two points in time – 1994 and 2000 – when the respondents were old enough to be
25:797:72271:20:20:57:542:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:settled in their careers and to have made some job-related moves.  Occupational choices from the NLSY
25:798:72372:20:21:57:542:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in these years will be matched to census data on historical fractionalization, both in the individual’s
25:799:72475:21:20:57:528:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:county of birth and the contemporaneous county of residence, to test the predictions of the model.
25:800:72573:20:20:74:542:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Table 7 reports descriptive statistics for the individuals in our sample, who were on average 18 years
25:801:72675:20:21:57:542:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:old in 1979 and so around 33 years old in 1994 and 39 years old in 2000.  Occupational categories in the
25:802:72779:21:20:57:542:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:NLSY (up to the 2000 round) are based on the 1970 codes from the census.  Professional occupations
25:803:72877:20:20:57:542:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are defined to include relevant codes listed under the Professional,  Technical,  and Kindred Workers
25:804:72978:20:20:57:542:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:category [1-196].  Job-related geographical mobility is the chief property that distinguishes professional
25:805:73084:20:21:57:542:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and non-professional occupations in our model.  We consequently exclude technical occupations and
25:806:73181:21:20:57:478:334:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:other occupations where career moves are unlikely to be important from this category.19
25:807:73268:20:20:74:542:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Based on this occupational classification, 9 percent of the respondents hold professional jobs, with
25:808:73368:20:21:57:542:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:little change from 1994 to 2000.  56 percent of all respondents had migrated out of their birth-county
25:809:73470:21:20:57:542:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:by 1994,  with an increase to 59 percent by 2000.  Consistent with the assumption that professional
25:810:73569:20:20:57:542:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:occupations are associated with greater mobility, 75 percent of the professionals and 53 percent of the
25:811:73672:20:21:57:542:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:non-professionals had migrated out of their birth-county by 1994 (these differences are significant at
25:812:73774:21:20:57:294:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the 5 percent level and similar in 1994 and 2000).
25:813:73824:20:20:74:542:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Individuals in the sample are 33 years old by 1994 and should be established in the labor market.
25:814:73921:20:21:57:542:172:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Nevertheless, employment levels continue to increase over time, from 81 percent in 1994 to 92 percent in
25:815:74025:21:20:57:542:151:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:2000.  Conditional on being employed, annual income (in 2000 dollars) also increases from 28 thousand
25:816:74126:20:16:57:542:131:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in 1994 to 33 thousand in 2000.  These changes in employment and income are presumably life-cycle
25:817:74223:16:15:66:542:115:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:19These  occupations  include  Nurses,  dieticians,  and  therapists  [74-76],  Religious  workers  [86,90],  Social  and  recre-
25:818:74352:15:11:57:542:100:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:ation  workers  [100,101],  Teachers,  except  college  and  university  [141-145],  Technicians  [150-174],  Writers,  artists,  and
25:819:74485:11:0:57:146:89:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:entertainers [175-196].
26:820:74510:0:20:57:542:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:effects,  but they could,  in principle,  be due to selective attrition since this is a longitudinal survey.
26:821:74618:20:21:57:542:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Notice, however, that racial composition and the proportion of women in the sample are very stable
26:822:74716:21:20:57:542:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:over the 1994-2000 period.  Thus, we do not observe selective attrition from the sample, at least with
26:823:74818:20:29:57:542:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:respect to two important demographic characteristics that are associated with income and employment.
26:824:74918:29:28:57:475:610:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:5.2  Fractionalization in the County of Birth and Occupational Choice
26:825:74987:28:20:57:542:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The first prediction from the model of occupational choice incorporating local identity is that indi-
26:826:75088:20:20:57:542:562:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:viduals  born  in  counties  with  greater  ethnic  fractionalization  in  1860  should  be  less  likely  to  hold
26:827:75203:20:20:57:542:542:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:professional  jobs.   Including  race,  gender,  and  age  as  regressors  (although  their  omission  would  not
26:828:75316:20:21:57:542:522:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:affect the results) we see in Table 8, Columns 1-2 that individuals born in high fractionalization coun-
26:829:75420:21:20:57:542:501:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ties  are  indeed  less  likely  to  hold  professional  jobs  in  the  1994  and  2000  rounds  of  the  NLSY.  The
26:830:75536:20:20:57:542:481:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:individuals  in  our  sample  are  drawn  from  150  of  the  approximately  400  Midwestern  counties  that
26:831:75644:20:21:57:542:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:were incorporated and had attracted foreign migrants by 1860.  While it thus seems unlikely that a
26:832:75742:21:20:57:542:440:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:few outlying counties are driving the results,  we nevertheless report nonparametric estimates of the
26:833:75843:20:20:57:542:420:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:relationship between occupational choice and historical fractionalization in Figure 6.  We see that the
26:834:75946:20:21:57:542:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:probability that the individual is a professional declines steadily with fractionalization, both in 1994
26:835:76050:21:20:57:311:379:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:and in 2000, verifying the robustness of our results.20
26:836:76105:20:20:74:542:359:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Our test of the hypothesis that identity shapes occupational choice relies on the assumption that
26:837:76202:20:21:57:542:339:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:fractionalization is uncorrelated with the demand for professional workers in the county. Recall from Ta-
26:838:76307:21:20:57:542:318:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ble 4, however, that historical fractionalization had a positive and significant effect on current economic
26:839:76414:20:20:57:542:298:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:characteristics,  measured by population in the county as well as racial and ethnic fractionalization,
26:840:76516:20:21:57:542:278:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:but that this effect disappeared once important characteristics of the 1860 economy were included as
26:841:76616:21:20:57:542:257:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:regressors.  More urban counties will have a greater demand for professional workers, shiftingupthe
26:842:76715:20:20:57:542:237:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:coefficient on the fractionalization variable in Table 8, Columns 1-2.  The regressions that follow will
26:843:76819:20:21:57:542:217:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:thus include the same 1860 characteristics as in Tables 4 and 5 – population, manufacturing share and
26:844:76920:21:20:57:525:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:agriculture share – to control for variation in thedemandfor professional workers across counties.
26:845:77018:20:20:74:542:176:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The prediction that high fractionalization counties should supply fewer professional workers is de-
26:846:77117:20:16:57:542:156:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rived conditional on the totalsurplusthat was historically available to migrants in the labor market
26:847:77217:16:15:66:542:140:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:20The nonparametric regressions are estimated using the Epanechnikov kernel smoothing function.  Less than 5 percent
26:848:77333:15:11:57:542:125:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:of the observations in Table 8, Columns 1-2 are drawn from counties with fractionalization below 0.45 and so too much
26:849:77450:11:11:57:542:114:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:weight should not be placed on the extremely steep initial decline in Figure 6.  Although all the parametric regressions
26:850:77570:11:11:57:542:103:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:that follow will use the full set of counties, we verified that the fractionalization coefficient is unchanged when the sample
26:851:77696:11:0:57:336:92:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:is restricted to individuals drawn from counties in the 0.45-0.8 range.
27:852:77769:0:20:57:542:700:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f3:Rand the total number of migrant workersN.  Everything else equal, an increase inRwould increase
27:853:77865:20:21:57:542:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the  cost  of  exit  at  the  margin,  encouraging  efforts  to  instill  local  identity  historically  and  lowering
27:854:77983:21:20:57:542:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the propensity to enter professional occupations today.  Superior transportation infrastructure in 1860
27:855:78086:20:20:57:542:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:was associated with high fractionalization and a larger county population in Table 3 and so we expect
27:856:78187:20:21:57:542:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:fractionalization to be positively correlated withR.  It follows that exclusion ofRfrom the occupa-
27:857:78286:21:20:57:542:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tion choice regression in Table 8, Columns 1-2 would have shifted the coefficient on fractionalization
27:858:78388:20:20:57:542:578:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:down.  The same 1860 characteristics that we described above could be used to control forR, but since
27:859:78489:20:21:57:542:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the professional demand effect and the surplus effect work in opposite directions,  the effect of their
27:860:78592:21:20:57:542:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:inclusion on the fractionalization coefficient would now be ambiguous.  By the same argument, we can
27:861:78692:20:20:57:542:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:no  longer  predict  the  sign  of  the  coefficients  on  the  1860  characteristics  when  they  are  included  in
27:862:78808:20:21:57:542:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the occupation choice regression.  For example, larger 1860 population is associated with urbanization
27:863:78910:21:20:57:542:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:today and, hence, an increased demand for professional jobs.  At the same time, a larger 1860 pop-
27:864:79008:20:20:57:542:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ulation is associated with a largerR,  stronger identity and,  hence,  a reduced supply of professional
27:865:79111:20:21:57:542:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:workers.  Finally, we would want to account for the number of migrantsNwhen estimating the effect of
27:866:79211:21:20:57:542:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:fractionalization on occupational choice.  This variable is highly correlated with county population (the
27:867:79316:20:20:57:542:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:correlation is 0.9) and so will be omitted from the regressions that follow.  1860 population captures
27:868:79418:20:20:57:503:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the professional demand effect, the surplus effect, and the effect ofNon occupational choice.
27:869:79511:20:21:74:542:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We see in Table 8, Columns 3-4 that the coefficient on 1860 fractionalization becomes more neg-
27:870:79606:21:20:57:542:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ative  and  is  more  precisely  estimated  once  the  additional  county-level  controls  are  included  in  the
27:871:79719:20:20:57:542:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:occupational  choice  regressions.   To  allow  for  the  possibility  that  individuals  with  particular  ethnic
27:872:79833:20:21:57:542:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ancestry continue to be concentrated in specific occupations today, we include the population share
27:873:79932:21:20:57:542:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of  each  ethnicity  in  the  1860  census,  computed  at  the  level  of  the  county,  in  Columns  5-6.   Given
27:874:80046:20:20:57:542:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the  high  rate  of  inter-county  migration,  we  do  not  expect  the  ethnic  shares  in  1860  to  be  relevant
27:875:80161:20:21:57:542:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:today and not surprisingly the fractionalization coefficient is hardly affected by the inclusion of these
27:876:80266:21:20:57:542:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:additional regressors.  Based on the estimates in Column 4, a one standard deviation decline in ethnic
27:877:80368:20:20:57:542:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:fractionalization would increase the probability of holding a professional job from 9 percent to as much
27:878:80472:20:21:57:542:172:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as  15  percent.   Individuals  born  in  counties  with  a  greater  share  of  manufacturing  and  agricultural
27:879:80585:21:20:57:542:151:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:jobs in 1860 are also less likely to hold professional jobs.  Population in 1860, in contrast, has no effect
27:880:80693:20:20:57:542:131:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on  occupational  choice  in  both  the  1994  and  the  2000  rounds.   Finally,  women  and  non-whites  are
27:881:80803:20:21:57:362:111:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:significantly less likely to hold professional jobs in Columns 1-6.
27:882:80870:21:0:74:542:90:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We  complete  the  description  of  the  occupational  choice  regressions  by  discussing  a  number  of
28:883:80977:0:20:57:542:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:robustness tests (not reported).  First, we computed ethnic fractionalization in 1860 with men only.
28:884:81077:20:21:57:542:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Both men and women participated in the workforce in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, with
28:885:81179:21:20:57:542:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ethnic networks channeling women into jobs as well.  Bodnar (1980), for example, cites a 1930 study of
28:886:81281:20:20:57:542:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:two thousand foreign-born women, most of whom reported that they had secured their first job through
28:887:81381:20:21:57:542:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:social connections.  Nevertheless, we might expect labor networks to have been organized along gender
28:888:81482:21:20:57:542:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:lines within ethnic groups, with male networks occupying a dominant position in the labor market and
28:889:81582:20:20:57:542:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the communities they were drawn from.  The coefficient on the alternative fractionalization measure
28:890:81684:20:21:57:542:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(computed using men alone) continues to be negative and significant, both in 1994 and 2000, although
28:891:81784:21:20:57:149:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:it is smaller in size.
28:892:81806:20:20:74:542:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Inspection of the occupation categories in Table 2 indicates that farmers made up 50 percent of
28:893:81901:20:21:57:542:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the  workforce  in  1860.   Ethnic  competition  may  have  been  less  relevant  in  this  category  and  so  we
28:894:82014:21:20:57:542:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:recomputed the county-level fractionalization statistic placing zero weight on fractionalization among
28:895:82116:20:20:57:542:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the farmers as a second robustness test.21The fractionalization coefficient becomes slightly larger in
28:896:82218:20:21:57:542:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:absolute magnitude and is more precisely estimated, both with and without the 1860 controls.  In a
28:897:82316:21:20:57:542:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:related exercise, we explored the possibility that ethnic competition occurred outside the labor market
28:898:82419:20:20:57:542:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:entirely by computing fractionalization without regard to occupational category or occupational status.
28:899:82522:20:20:57:542:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This alternative measure of fractionalization, in contrast, had an insignificant effect on occupational
28:900:82625:20:21:57:89:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:choice.
28:901:82632:21:20:74:542:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:As a third test, we separately replaced 1860 characteristics with 1850 and 1870 characteristics to
28:902:82730:20:20:57:542:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:assess  the  stability  of  the  results  in  other  census  years  around  the  time  of  initial  settlement.   The
28:903:82847:20:21:57:542:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:coefficient  on  1850  fractionalization  is  negative  and  significant,  albeit  smaller  in  magnitude.   The
28:904:82959:21:20:57:542:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:coefficient on 1870 fractionalization is also negative, but not significant at conventional levels. Although
28:905:83067:20:20:57:542:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:we focus on economic characteristics at the time of initial settlement in this paper, we do not rule out
28:906:83171:20:21:57:542:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the possibility that relevant measures of population heterogeneity and other economic characteristics
28:907:83272:21:20:57:542:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:later on had persistent effects as well.  All that we require is that 1860 fractionalization should have
28:908:83376:20:16:57:542:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a direct and independent effect on identity and church inputs today.  The clean trend in the church
28:909:83475:16:15:66:542:176:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:21We include all individuals who report being employed, regardless of their age, when computing the fractionalization
28:910:83592:15:11:57:542:161:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:statistic since there were no age restrictions on employment at that time.  Apart from the 11 broad occupational categories
28:911:83715:11:11:57:542:150:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:in  Table  2,  some  individuals  in  the  census  were  also  assigned  to  an  undefined  occupational  category.   Women  were
28:912:83844:11:11:57:542:139:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:disproportionately represented in this category, which presumably covers home production and other informal activities.
28:913:83963:11:11:57:542:128:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:As with the farmers, we assume that networks were less relevant in this category and assign it zero weight when computing
28:914:84084:11:11:57:542:117:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:ethnic fractionalization in all the regressions that we report.  Nevertheless,  we verified that assigning a weight to this
28:915:84207:11:11:57:542:106:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:category  based  on  its  share  of  the  migrant  workforce  in  the  county  had  no  effect  on  the  estimated  fractionalization
28:916:84340:11:0:57:250:95:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:coefficient in the occupational choice regression.
29:917:84392:0:20:57:542:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:participation regressions reported in Figure 4, starting from 1870 and stretching uninterrupted all the
29:918:84495:20:21:57:346:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:way through to 2000, provides strong support for this claim.
29:919:84555:21:20:74:542:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Fourth, we replaced total population with the migrant population and, separately, with the work-
29:920:84651:20:20:57:542:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:force, in the occupational choice regression.  These variables are all highly correlated, and not surpris-
29:921:84757:20:21:57:542:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ingly the results were unchanged.  Fifth, we included the share of migrants in the workforce, and the
29:922:84858:21:20:57:542:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:interaction of this variable with ethnic fractionalization,  as additional regressors.  This specification
29:923:84964:20:20:57:542:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:allows for the possibility that ethnic fractionalization had a larger effect in counties where migrants
29:924:85067:20:21:57:542:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:made up a larger share of the total population.  However,  both these variables had an insignificant
29:925:85167:21:20:57:513:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:effect on occupational choice, leaving the (uninteracted) fractionalization coefficient unchanged.
29:926:85265:20:20:74:542:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Sixth,  we  expanded  the  set  of  professional  occupations  by  including  individuals  assigned  to  the
29:927:85373:20:21:57:542:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:“managers and administrators” code [245] within the broader Managers and Administrators, except
29:928:85468:21:20:57:542:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Farm category [201-245].  Most of the specific occupations listed in this broad category do not conform
29:929:85571:20:20:57:542:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to our definition of a professional occupation and the “managers and administrators” classification does
29:930:85675:20:21:57:542:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:not provide much information on the actual nature of jobs that it covers.  However, 74.7 percent of the
29:931:85778:21:20:57:542:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:individuals assigned to that category migrated out of the county of their birth, which is close to the
29:932:85880:20:20:57:542:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:level of migration for the other occupations that we include in the professional category.  Inclusion of
29:933:85984:20:20:57:542:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the managers and administrators in the professional classification increased the share of professionals
29:934:86087:20:21:57:542:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the sample to 17.7 percent.  Although these results need to to interpreted with caution since the
29:935:86187:21:20:57:542:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:additional professional occupations are selected on the basis of an outcome (migration) rather than
29:936:86286:20:20:57:542:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:their fundamental characteristics, we nevertheless verified that the fractionalization coefficient in the
29:937:86391:20:21:57:542:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:occupational choice regression with this expanded definition of professional activity remained negative
29:938:86494:21:20:57:542:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and significant.  Finally, we ran the occupational choice regression in other years – 1993, 1996, 1998
29:939:86596:20:20:57:542:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:– generating a pattern of fractionalization coefficients very similar to the point estimates obtained in
29:940:86700:20:30:57:129:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1994 and 2000.
29:941:86714:30:27:57:466:203:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:5.3  Fractionalization and Outcomes Related to Occupational Choice
29:942:86780:27:20:57:542:176:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:An individual born in a county with higher ethnic fractionalization in 1860 is less likely to select into a
29:943:86887:20:21:57:542:156:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:professional occupation in 1994 and 2000.  Our interpretation of this result is that individuals born in
29:944:86991:21:20:57:542:135:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:high fractionalization counties identify strongly with their local communities and so wish to avoid the
29:945:87094:20:20:57:542:115:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:spatial mobility that comes with professional occupations.  The regression results reported in Table 9,
29:946:87197:20:0:57:542:95:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Columns 1-2 indicate that individuals from high fractionalization counties are indeed significantly less
30:947:87303:0:20:57:542:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:likely to migrate from the county of their birth.  On average, around 58 percent of the individuals in the
30:948:87409:20:21:57:542:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sample migrate from the county of birth.  The point estimates indicate that a one standard deviation
30:949:87509:21:20:57:542:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:increase in fractionalization reduces migration by 8 percentage points (a 14 percent decline).  Among
30:950:87610:20:20:57:542:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the other regressors, none of the 1860 county-level controls significantly affect migration, but Whites
30:951:87713:20:21:57:541:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are significantly more likely to move.  Age is also (mechanically) positively associated with migration.
30:952:87817:21:20:74:542:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Does the effect of fractionalization on occupational choice and migration that we have just described
30:953:87918:20:20:57:542:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:have economic consequences?  The results in Table 9, Columns 3-4 indicate that while individuals born
30:954:88019:20:21:57:542:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in counties with a greater share of manufacturing and agriculture in 1860 are significantly more likely
30:955:88122:21:20:57:542:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to hold a job by 2000, employment levels do not vary significantly with ethnic fractionalization in 1994
30:956:88226:20:20:57:542:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:or 2000.22Whites and males are, not surprisingly, significantly more likely to be employed, although
30:957:88326:20:21:57:384:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the importance of these individual characteristics declines over time.
30:958:88396:21:20:74:542:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In  contrast  with  the  results  for  employment,  the  income  regressions  reported  next  in  Table  9,
30:959:88503:20:20:57:542:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Columns 5-6 indicate that high fractionalization is associated with significantly lower income (in 2000),
30:960:88608:20:21:57:542:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:conditional on being employed.  Average annual income in 2000 was 33,000 dollars, and so our estimates
30:961:88710:21:20:57:542:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:indicate that a one standard deviation increase in fractionalization would have reduced income by 2,300
30:962:88813:20:20:57:542:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:dollars (a 7 percent decrease).23A greater share of manufacturing and agriculture in 1860 is associated
30:963:88916:20:29:57:513:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with lower income in 2000, with Whites and males earning significantly more in 1994 and 2000.
30:964:89009:29:28:57:502:346:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:5.4  Fractionalization in the County of Residence and Occupational Choice
30:965:89082:28:20:57:542:318:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The second prediction of the model is that historical fractionalization in the county of residence should
30:966:89187:20:20:57:542:298:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:have  no  effect  on  occupational  choice.   This  implies  that  non-professional  workers  must  flow  out  of
30:967:89300:20:21:57:542:278:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the high fractionalization counties, while professional workers flow in to clear the labor market.  This
30:968:89404:21:20:57:542:257:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:prediction rules out the possibility that differences in the demand for professional labor across counties
30:969:89510:20:20:57:166:237:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are driving our results.
30:970:89534:20:21:74:542:217:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To test the prediction that non-professional workers flow out of the high fractionalization counties
30:971:89634:21:16:57:542:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:we  divide  the  sample  into  individuals  who  stay  and  individuals  who  out-migrate  from  their  county
30:972:89744:16:14:66:542:180:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:22Although we focus onex antecareer choices, we noted in Section 3 that the Central Planner could also reduce move-

30:974:89974:11:11:57:542:155:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:with strong local identity.  We see no evidence of such adjustments in employment.  Restricting the sample to profes-
30:975:90091:11:11:57:542:144:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:sionals, we do find that individuals born in high fractionalization counties are less likely to migrate, but once again the
30:976:90214:11:7:57:318:133:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:fractionalization coefficient is insignificant at conventional levels.
30:977:90284:7:15:66:542:126:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:23This result rules out an alternative explanation for the excess supply of non-professionals in high fractionalization
30:978:90403:15:11:57:542:111:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:counties based on the idea that labor networks in those counties generate disproportionately high wages in non-professional
30:979:90526:11:11:57:542:100:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:occupations.  As an additional check, we restricted the sample to individuals in non-professional occupations and verified
30:980:90648:11:0:57:447:89:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:that individuals born in high fractionalization counties did not earn significantly higher incomes.
31:981:90749:0:20:57:542:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of  birth  (by  1994  and  2000)  in  Table  10,  Columns  1-4.   Matching  the  results  in  Table  8  with  the
31:982:90862:20:21:57:542:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:full sample, fractionalization in the county of birth lowers the probability that the individual will be
31:983:90966:21:20:57:542:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:employed in a professional occupation for both stayers and out-migrants in Table 10,  Columns 1-4.
31:984:91064:20:20:57:542:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:While  the  coefficient  for  the  two  groups  is  comparable  in  1994,  it  is  substantially  larger  –  roughly
31:985:91180:20:21:57:542:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:twice as large – for the out-migrants in 2000.  Some of the excess supply of non-professional labor in
31:986:91282:21:20:57:542:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the high fractionalization counties is evidently reduced through the selective out-migration of workers
31:987:91385:20:20:57:542:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from  those  counties.   To  test  the  accompanying  prediction  that  professional  workers  will  flow  into
31:988:91496:20:21:57:542:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the high fractionalization counties, we restrict the sample to individuals who move into our Midwest
31:989:91596:21:20:57:542:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:counties from anywhere in the United States.  Regressing occupational choice on the county of residence
31:990:91699:20:20:57:542:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the in-migrants in Table 10, Columns 5-6 we see that although the fractionalization coefficient is
31:991:91800:20:21:57:391:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:insignificant in 1994, it is positive and significant in 2000 as expected.
31:992:91874:21:20:74:542:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The labor flows that we have described all work towards reducing the mismatch between the supply
31:993:91970:20:20:57:542:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and  the  demand  for  professional  and  non-professional  labor  across  counties.   Measuring  historical
31:994:92078:20:21:57:542:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:fractionalization in the county of residence in Table 10, Columns 7-8 we see that the fractionalization
31:995:92181:21:20:57:542:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:coefficient is no longer significant and actually switches signs in 2000.  It is only individuals born in
31:996:92286:20:20:57:542:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:high fractionalization counties who are less likely to be professionals.  Once the market has cleared,
31:997:92388:20:20:57:542:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:individuals residing in those counties are just as likely to hold professional jobs, as predicted by the
31:998:92492:20:21:57:97:355:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:model.24
31:999:92500:21:20:74:542:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:One remaining concern is that the mismatch between the supply and the demand for professional
31:1000:92593:20:20:57:542:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:labor in the high fractionalization counties could have been driven by unexpected changes in the demand
31:1001:92696:20:21:57:542:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for professionals in those counties rather than a strong local identity.  Suppose, for example, that the
31:1002:92800:21:20:57:542:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:demand for professionals was systematically lower in high fractionalization counties historically and
31:1003:92901:20:20:57:542:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:then increased in the 1980’s, with the restructuring of the U.S. economy, after our NLSY cohort had
31:1004:93000:20:21:57:542:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:made their career choices.  To rule out this possibility, we regressed manufacturing share, agriculture
31:1005:93103:21:20:57:542:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:share, and county population in 1970, obtained from the 1972 County Data Book, on the same 1860
31:1006:93198:20:20:57:542:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:characteristics as in Table 4, Columns 7-9.  1860 fractionalization has no effect on economic conditions
31:1007:93302:20:16:57:364:172:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in 1970, just as we saw earlier with the same conditions in 1990.
31:1008:93367:16:15:66:542:156:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:24The  second  prediction  of  the  model  that  fractionalization  in  the  county  of  residence  should  be  uncorrelated  with
31:1009:93497:15:11:57:542:141:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:occupational  choice  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  entire  labor  market  can  clear.   The  test  that  we  implement,
31:1010:93630:11:11:57:542:130:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:instead,  is  based  on  a  restricted  NLSY  cohort.   Note,  however,  that  labor  supply  and  demand  should  match  in  each
31:1011:93760:11:0:57:196:119:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:cohort in steady-state equilibrium.
32:1012:93797:0:27:57:321:700:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:5.5  Fractionalization and Individual Ability
32:1013:93842:27:21:57:542:673:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Although individuals are assumed to beex anteidentical in the model of occupational choice, we could
32:1014:93942:21:20:57:542:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:easily  allow  for  heterogeneity  in  ability  within  each  location.   If  the  cost  of  training  is  declining  in
32:1015:94062:20:20:57:542:632:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ability, then individuals above an ability-threshold would select into the professional occupation, with
32:1016:94166:20:21:57:542:612:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a higher threshold in location 1 with stronger local identity.  Suppose, instead, that identity is irrelevant
32:1017:94275:21:20:57:542:591:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and the ability distribution in location 2 dominates the corresponding distribution in location 1.  The
32:1018:94378:20:20:57:542:571:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:number of professionals supplied by location 2 would still exceed the number of professionals supplied
32:1019:94480:20:21:57:485:551:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:by location 1, and this alternative explanation would match all the results in Tables 8-10.
32:1020:94571:21:20:74:542:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We have already ruled out variation in the demand for professional jobs as an alternative explana-
32:1021:94669:20:20:57:542:510:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tion, but could variation in individual ability across counties as described above have generated these
32:1022:94772:20:21:57:542:490:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:results instead?  Variation in ability could arise due to differences in innate talent or the quality of
32:1023:94876:21:20:57:542:469:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the school system.  High fractionalization counties had superior transportation infrastructure in 1860
32:1024:94978:20:20:57:542:449:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and so were most likely growing relatively rapidly at that time.  It is entirely possible that particular
32:1025:95083:20:21:57:542:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:types of migrants were attracted to those counties, although we would expect migrants drawn to areas
32:1026:95183:21:20:57:542:408:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with many competing ethnic groups to have been positively selected on innate talent.  Given the high
32:1027:95283:20:20:57:542:388:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rates of inter-county migration, even in the Midwest, we would in any case expect few families to have
32:1028:95385:20:21:57:542:368:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:maintained an unbroken line of descent to the present day in the same county.  Moreover, we noted
32:1029:95482:21:20:57:542:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in Table 5 that 1860 fractionalization was uncorrelated with education expenditures in 1990.  Given
32:1030:95581:20:20:57:542:327:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the weak serial correlation in our fractionalization measure, it is unlikely that it was correlated with
32:1031:95685:20:20:57:542:307:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:relevant measures of heterogeneity early in the twentieth century when important public investments
32:1032:95784:20:21:57:542:287:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:were being made.  Consistent with this view, we see in Table 11, Columns 1-3 that fractionalization,
32:1033:95884:21:20:57:542:266:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and all the 1860 variables for that matter, have no effect on AFQT scores, high school completion, and
32:1034:95986:20:20:57:542:246:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:college completion.25In contrast, individual characteristics have a strong effect on AFQT scores and
32:1035:96086:20:21:57:147:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:college completion.
32:1036:96105:21:20:74:542:205:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Even if innate talent and the quality of the school system do not vary systematically with frac-
32:1037:96201:20:20:57:542:185:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tionalization, we might still expect individuals from high fractionalization counties to invest less in the
32:1038:96308:20:21:57:542:165:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:college education that is necessary to obtain a professional job.  One reason why we do not see this
32:1039:96408:21:16:57:542:144:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:effect  in  Column  3  may  be  that  there  is  consumption  value  to  higher  education.   Ideally,  we  would
32:1040:96521:16:14:66:542:128:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:25The fact that fractionalization is uncorrelated with education also shuts down an alternative channel through which
32:1041:96638:14:11:57:542:114:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:fractionalization  could  affect  religious  participation  (see  Sacerdote  and  Glaeser  [2001]  for  an  analysis  of  the  complex
32:1042:96772:11:0:57:297:103:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:relationship between education and religious participation).
33:1043:96834:0:20:57:542:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:want to estimate the effect of fractionalization on the choice of college major, but this information is
33:1044:96938:20:21:57:542:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:unavailable in the NLSY. Nevertheless, notice that individuals born in high fractionalization counties
33:1045:97040:21:20:57:542:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are  less  likely  to  have  attended  college  out  of  state  (conditional  on  having  attended)  in  Column  4,
33:1046:97155:20:20:57:542:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:although this effect misses being significant at conventional levels.  This result may reflect a preference
33:1047:97262:20:21:57:542:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for being close to home or a recognition that the quality of the education these individuals receive is
33:1048:97365:21:20:57:542:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:less  relevant  for  their  future  careers.   Collecting  the  results  with  education  expenditures  in  Table  5
33:1049:97481:20:20:57:542:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and test scores and educational attainment in Table 11, there is no indication that individuals born in
33:1050:97584:20:21:57:542:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:high fractionalization counties are less capable or less prepared to invest in the human capital that is
33:1051:97688:21:34:57:233:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:necessary to secure professional jobs.

33:1053:97739:31:20:57:542:472:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This paper draws a connection between ethnic labor networks in the American Midwest when it was
33:1054:97834:20:21:57:542:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:first being settled, the local identity that emerged endogenously to support these networks and then
33:1055:97934:21:20:57:542:431:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:persisted  over  many  generations,  and  occupational  choice  today.   Individuals  born  in  counties  with
33:1056:98044:20:20:57:542:411:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:greater ethnic fractionalization in 1860, which we expect to be associated with stronger local identity
33:1057:98147:20:21:57:542:391:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and better functioning parochial institutions, are significantly less likely to hold professional jobs, which
33:1058:98256:21:20:57:293:370:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:come with greater geographical mobility, in 2000.
33:1059:98305:20:20:74:542:350:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The results in this paper are relevant to the ongoing debate on “economic institutions” (Acemoglu,
33:1060:98403:20:21:57:542:330:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Johnson and Robinson [2001, 2002]) versus “culture” (Barro and McCleary 2003, Tabellini 2005, Fer-
33:1061:98501:21:20:57:542:309:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:nandez and Fogli 2007) as determinants of growth. We find that local cultural traits generate significant
33:1062:98606:20:20:57:542:289:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:variation in occupational choice across what appears to be a relatively homogenous region – the Amer-
33:1063:98707:20:21:57:542:269:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ican Midwest – and we conjecture that these cultural effects might be even larger across countries with
33:1064:98810:21:20:57:542:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:very different histories.  At the same time, culture cannot be sustained without institutional support.
33:1065:98913:20:20:57:542:228:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Social institutions such as the church and the family help sustain cultural traits, which in turn keep
33:1066:99015:20:21:57:542:208:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:these institutions alive.  As long as these institutions continue to be useful, cultural traits can persist
33:1067:99122:21:20:57:542:187:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:long after the economic circumstances that gave rise to them have ceased to be relevant.  The eco-
33:1068:99220:20:20:57:542:167:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:nomics literature has focussed much of its attention on economic and political institutions.  Our results
33:1069:99325:20:21:57:542:147:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:suggest that social institutions, with their complementary cultural traits, might have important effects
33:1070:99429:21:0:57:144:126:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on growth as well.

34:1103:101920:16:15:66:542:112:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:26Specifically,  we  allowed  shocks  to  be  perfectly  negatively  correlated  for  professional  and  non-professional  workers

35:1107:102301:21:20:57:542:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:then follows that the supply of professional labor in location 2 will be 2sN−x1and that the supply

35:1110:102595:21:20:57:542:591:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and so it will be convenient to solve what is essentially a linear programming problem in three regimes:

35:1133:103987:17:15:66:542:132:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:27To generate a positive labor flow we requires≤1/2.  This is a reasonable assumption since just a small fraction of

36:1136:104285:0:20:74:542:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We now reduce the supply of non-professional labor in location 2, but at most to the point where
