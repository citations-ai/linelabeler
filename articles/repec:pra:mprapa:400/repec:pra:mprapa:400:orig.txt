3:55:1309:27:28:275:323:676:144:Times:144:Times:Abstract 
3:56:1318:28:14:73:526:648:144:Times:144:Times:Instead  of  merely  setting  a  lower  bound  on  the  wages  of  formal  sector  workers,  minimum  
3:57:1420:14:14:73:525:634:144:Times:144:Times:wages  serve  as  a  norm  for  wage  setting  more  generally  throughout  the  Mexican  economy.  
3:58:1520:14:13:73:524:620:144:Times:144:Times:Our results suggest that wages are commonly set at multiples of the minimum wage, and that 
3:59:1611:13:14:73:526:607:144:Times:144:Times:changes  in  minimum  wages  influence  wage  changes  across  the  occupational  distribution.  
3:60:1708:14:14:73:525:593:144:Times:144:Times:Moreover, our findings suggest that these normative features of minimum wages have their 
3:61:1797:14:14:73:526:579:144:Times:144:Times:greatest  impact  on  the  mid-to-lower  tail  of  the  wage  distribution,  including  the  informal  
3:62:1900:14:14:73:528:565:144:Times:144:Times:sector  of  the  economy.  Thus,  the  results  lend  support  to  the  view  that  declining  real  
3:63:2001:14:13:73:524:551:144:Times:144:Times:minimum wages and stabilization programs that strengthened the link between wage levels, 
3:64:2090:13:14:73:527:538:144:Times:144:Times:wage  changes,  and  minimum  wages,  might  account  for  a  portion  of  the  growing  wage  
3:65:2185:14:14:73:420:524:144:Times:144:Times:inequality in Mexico over the period of the late 1980s and early 1990s.

4:71:2358:0:20:73:160:758:144:Times:144:Times:1. Introduction 
4:72:2373:20:21:109:524:738:144:Times:144:Times:Research on the impact of minimum wage policies in Mexico has typically concluded 
4:73:2455:21:21:73:487:717:144:Times:144:Times:that they have little if any effect on the structure of wages.  The informal sector of the 
4:74:2546:21:20:73:522:696:144:Times:144:Times:economy is thought to be mostly immune to government regulations of this sort.  Whereas in 
4:75:2637:20:21:73:491:676:144:Times:144:Times:the formal sector, where mandated wage minimums are expected to have their greatest 
4:76:2721:21:21:73:508:655:144:Times:144:Times:impact, research suggests that wage levels tend to be well above the minimum, there is no 
4:77:2811:21:20:73:510:634:144:Times:144:Times:significant spike or clustering in the distribution around the minimum, and the variation in 
4:78:2904:20:21:73:516:614:144:Times:144:Times:minimum wages over time accounts for none of the inter-temporal variation in either wages 
4:79:2994:21:21:73:211:593:144:Times:64:Times:or employment (Bell 1997).1
4:80:3021:21:21:109:483:572:144:Times:144:Times:Our data confirm many of these empirical regularities regarding labor market 
4:81:3098:21:20:73:521:551:144:Times:144:Times:outcomes in Mexico.  For example, in our data only 5% of formal sector workers earned less 
4:82:3189:20:21:73:504:531:144:Times:144:Times:than the minimum wage in 1984, and only 2.5% earned less than the minimum in 1992.2  
4:83:3274:21:21:73:500:510:144:Times:144:Times:Moreover, we find little evidence of a sizeable spike or clustering of workers around the 
4:84:3364:21:20:73:508:489:144:Times:144:Times:minimum wage in the formal sector.  However, our empirical results are not supportive of 
4:85:3453:20:21:73:503:469:144:Times:144:Times:the view that minimum wages have no impact on the wage structure in Mexico.  We find 
4:86:3538:21:21:73:516:448:144:Times:144:Times:strong evidence of clustering around multiples of the minimum wage, and some evidence to 
4:87:3627:21:20:73:514:427:144:Times:144:Times:suggest that wage increases over time for certain occupations follow stipulated increases in 
4:88:3720:20:21:73:498:407:144:Times:144:Times:the minimum wage.  Indeed, there is much anecdotal evidence to suggest that minimum 
4:89:3803:21:21:73:474:386:144:Times:144:Times:wages play precisely this kind of normative role in overall wage setting in Mexico. 
4:90:3887:21:20:109:490:365:144:Times:144:Times:We are unaware of any existing empirical analyses that formally link observed 
4:91:3965:20:21:73:523:345:144:Times:144:Times:clustering in wage distributions to minimum wage multiples in Mexico.  Maloney and Nuñez 
4:92:4054:21:21:73:486:324:144:Times:144:Times:(2003) offer evidence of clustering in the wage distributions of many Latin American 
4:93:4139:21:21:73:504:303:144:Times:144:Times:countries, and suggest that this clustering may be explained by the fact that the minimum 
4:94:4228:21:20:73:494:282:144:Times:144:Times:wage serves as a “numeraire” for wage and price setting more generally throughout the 
4:95:4314:20:21:73:517:262:144:Times:144:Times:economies of this region.  However, they do not establish an empirical relationship between 
4:96:4406:21:21:73:518:241:144:Times:144:Times:the observed clustering and minimum wage multiples.  In an in-depth analysis of the impact 
4:97:4497:21:43:73:515:220:144:Times:144:Times:of the minimum wage on the wage distribution in Columbia, the authors find that minimum 
4:98:4585:43:7:73:220:177:100:Times:100:Times:                                                           
4:99:4643:7:16:73:487:170:42:Times:100:Times:1 Bell’s analysis utilizes panel data on a select set of formal sector firms.  A similar analysis, but with a 
4:100:4753:16:11:73:496:154:100:Times:100:Times:different, less-privileged set of formal sector firms, finds evidence of a significant employment impact of 
4:101:4861:11:12:73:518:143:100:Times:100:Times:minimum wages (Feliciano 1998).  And, indeed, Bell’s own analysis suggests that, although few formal sector 
4:102:4969:12:11:73:514:131:100:Times:100:Times:firms possess average wages that are less than the minimum wage, there is a significant number of workers in 
4:103:5078:11:12:73:518:120:100:Times:100:Times:the formal sector who earn less than the minimum.  While Bell views this as an indication that minimum wage 
4:104:5186:12:11:73:511:108:100:Times:100:Times:policies might affect formal sector wages, others see this as evidence that minimum wage regulations are not 
4:105:5295:11:7:73:328:97:100:Times:100:Times:well enforced even in the formal sector (Bravo and Vial 1997). 
4:106:5358:7:16:73:514:90:42:Times:100:Times:2 By way of comparison, the corresponding figures for the U.S. are 11% for 1984 and 7.7% for 1992 (Source: 
4:107:5465:16:0:73:295:74:100:Times:100:Times:U.S. Census Bureau, Minimum Wage 2004, Table 10). 
5:108:5516:0:20:73:508:758:144:Times:144:Times:wage changes affect a significant range of the lower tail of the wage distribution, which is 
5:109:5609:20:21:73:460:738:144:Times:64:Times:suggestive of “numeraire” effects and not mere general equilibrium adjustment.3
5:110:5688:21:21:109:524:717:144:Times:144:Times:Our results, for Mexico, also suggest that the normative impact of the minimum wage 
5:111:5772:21:20:73:472:696:144:Times:144:Times:is most significant for the lower tail of the wage distribution.  The lower tail of the 
5:112:5860:20:21:73:490:676:144:Times:144:Times:distribution appears to be directly linked to multiples of the minimum wage, and wage 
5:113:5946:21:21:73:485:655:144:Times:144:Times:changes for occupations in this tail of the distribution follow more closely changes in 
5:114:6034:21:20:73:513:634:144:Times:144:Times:minimum wages.  This linkage suggests that the declining real value of the minimum wage 
5:115:6122:20:21:73:487:614:144:Times:144:Times:in Mexico over the past two decades might account for a portion of the growing wage 
5:116:6206:21:21:73:310:593:144:Times:144:Times:inequality in that country over the same period.4  
5:117:6257:21:21:109:495:572:144:Times:144:Times:The outline of the paper is as follows.  In the next section, we discuss anecdotal 
5:118:6340:21:20:73:511:551:144:Times:144:Times:evidence suggesting that minimum wages serve a normative role in overall wage setting in 
5:119:6429:20:21:73:479:531:144:Times:144:Times:Mexico.  In section 3, we offer an empirical exploration of this normative feature of 
5:120:6515:21:21:73:481:510:144:Times:144:Times:minimum wages.  There we present evidence to suggest that wages are indeed set as 
5:121:6597:21:20:73:480:489:144:Times:144:Times:multiples of the minimum wage, especially for workers in the lower tail of the wage 
5:122:6681:20:21:73:521:469:144:Times:144:Times:distribution.  While our data do not allow great insight into the relationship between changes 
5:123:6776:21:21:73:500:448:144:Times:144:Times:in wages and changes in minimum wages over time, some evidence on this aspect of the 
5:124:6861:21:20:73:517:427:144:Times:144:Times:normative role of minimum wages in Mexico is offered in section 4 of the paper.  In section 
5:125:6953:20:21:73:522:407:144:Times:144:Times:5 we offer suggestive evidence of the link between changing wage inequality over the period 
5:126:7045:21:21:73:475:386:144:Times:144:Times:of the 1980s and early 1990s and the normative role of minimum wages.  Section 6 
5:127:7126:21:20:73:174:365:144:Times:144:Times:concludes the paper.

5:129:7147:21:21:73:302:324:144:Times:144:Times:2. The Normative Role of Minimum Wages 
5:130:7185:21:21:109:518:303:144:Times:144:Times:The minimum wage in Mexico is intended to be the wage that would be sufficient to 
5:131:7267:21:20:73:502:282:144:Times:144:Times:support a worker and his or her family for a day.  Minimum wage levels are currently set 
5:132:7356:20:21:73:484:262:144:Times:144:Times:once a year by a tripartite commission (the Comisión Nacional de Salarios Mínimos) 
5:133:7439:21:21:73:504:241:144:Times:144:Times:representing the interests of labor, employers and the state.  Due to substantive economic 
5:134:7530:21:20:73:524:220:144:Times:144:Times:differences across regions in Mexico, minimum wages have been traditionally set at different 
5:135:7623:20:23:73:471:200:144:Times:144:Times:levels for different regions.  Recently, the number of regions has been streamlined 
5:136:7707:23:7:73:220:177:100:Times:100:Times:                                                           
5:137:7765:7:16:73:487:170:42:Times:100:Times:3 A minimum wage increase may elicit general equilibrium effects on wages both above and below the 
5:138:7864:16:11:73:510:154:100:Times:100:Times:minimum as workers who are displaced from the covered sector seek work and thereby depress wages in the 
5:139:7968:11:12:73:501:143:100:Times:100:Times:uncovered sector, or as firms substitute for higher-skilled labor and thereby raise the wages of higher-paid

5:142:8218:16:11:73:499:108:100:Times:100:Times:for this growth, see Alarcón and McKinley (1997), Fairris (2003) and the references cited therein.  Cortez 
5:143:8325:11:12:73:513:97:100:Times:100:Times:(2001) offers evidence that declining minimum wages explain part of the growing wage inequality in Mexico 
5:144:8431:12:11:73:516:85:100:Times:100:Times:over the period of the 1980s and 1990s, but does not consider the normative aspect of minimum wages, which 
5:145:8538:11:0:73:176:74:100:Times:100:Times:is the focus of this paper. 
6:146:8567:0:20:73:496:758:144:Times:144:Times:significantly.  Minimum wages are also established for trades and types of occupations, 
6:147:8655:20:21:73:483:738:144:Times:144:Times:including construction workers, cashiers, truck drivers, operators of pressure melting 
6:148:8742:21:21:73:275:717:144:Times:144:Times:machinery, and attendants at gas stations. 
6:149:8785:21:20:109:491:696:144:Times:144:Times:There is much institutional evidence to suggest that minimum wages serve as a 
6:150:8863:20:21:73:502:676:144:Times:144:Times:norm for wage setting at both the micro and macro levels in Mexico.  At the micro level, 
6:151:8952:21:21:73:496:655:144:Times:144:Times:many prices are fixed as multiples or fractions of the minimum wage.  Moreover, fines, 
6:152:9038:21:20:73:505:634:144:Times:144:Times:bails, income brackets for income tax rates, eligibility for certain social services (housing 
6:153:9132:20:21:73:484:614:144:Times:144:Times:credits, for example), bonuses as part of fringe benefits, and productivity bonuses for 
6:154:9220:21:21:73:510:593:144:Times:144:Times:teachers and university professors are tied to multiples of the minimum wage.  In fact, it is 
6:155:9314:21:21:73:506:572:144:Times:144:Times:fairly common in Mexico to hear workers and employers report wages in multiples of the 
6:156:9401:21:20:73:511:551:144:Times:144:Times:local wage minimum.  Bair and Gereffi’s (2001) study of jean production in Torreon notes 
6:157:9490:20:21:73:475:531:144:Times:144:Times:that many employers offer pay in multiples of the minimum wage.  Base pay in the 
6:158:9571:21:21:73:506:510:144:Times:144:Times:companies they interviewed ranged between 1.25 and 1.5 multiples of the local minimum 
6:159:9656:21:20:73:481:489:144:Times:144:Times:wage (p. 1898).  Thus, it would not be surprising to see wage levels, both above and 
6:160:9741:20:21:73:487:469:144:Times:144:Times:perhaps even below the minimum, set at multiples or fractions of the minimum wage. 
6:161:9824:21:21:109:516:448:144:Times:144:Times:Tying wages to multiples of the minimum wage probably began as a mechanism for 
6:162:9903:21:20:73:514:427:144:Times:144:Times:indexing wages to changes in the cost of living.  Over time, however, the established levels 
6:163:9996:20:21:73:510:407:144:Times:144:Times:may have come to be viewed as norms of fairness in relative pay across occupations in the 
6:164:10086:21:21:73:480:386:144:Times:144:Times:workplace, and thus agreed to by workers because they are perceived as fair, and by 
6:165:10170:21:20:73:512:365:144:Times:144:Times:employers because they maintain work norms which are premised on workers’ perceptions 
6:166:10256:20:21:73:163:345:144:Times:64:Times:of fairness in pay.5
6:167:10276:21:21:109:500:324:144:Times:144:Times:At a macro level, these normative dynamics can be related in part to the role that 
6:168:10359:21:21:73:499:303:144:Times:144:Times:minimum wages have played in stabilization policies (in 1977, 1983, 1985-86, 1987-89, 
6:169:10445:21:20:73:489:282:144:Times:144:Times:and 1995-97).  Throughout the decades of the 1980s and 1990s the Mexican economy 
6:170:10526:20:21:73:500:262:144:Times:144:Times:suffered high volatility in inflation and GDP growth rates, and stabilization polices were 
6:171:10617:21:21:73:483:241:144:Times:144:Times:the government’s response.   In the wake of the 1982 debt crisis restrictive fiscal and 
6:172:10705:21:20:73:499:220:144:Times:144:Times:monetary polices were followed, but inflation persisted and GDP growth rates remained 
6:173:10791:20:21:73:500:200:144:Times:144:Times:low.  In December 1987 the government began exchange rate management (the nominal 
6:174:10873:21:21:73:476:179:144:Times:144:Times:peso-dollar exchange rate was fixed), increased the pace of trade liberalization, and 
6:175:10959:21:27:73:508:158:144:Times:144:Times:initiated incomes policies taking the form of wage and price controls (Messmacher 2002). 
6:176:11048:27:7:73:220:131:100:Times:100:Times:                                                           
6:177:11106:7:16:73:494:124:42:Times:100:Times:5 Wages being determined by “norms” is a well established concept in economics.  A classic reference is 
6:178:11210:16:11:73:503:108:100:Times:100:Times:Akerlof (1982).  Levin-Waldman (2002) makes a case for minimum wages serving as a reference point for 
6:179:11312:11:12:73:519:97:100:Times:100:Times:firms’ internal wage structures in the U.S..  Living wage advocates have also made reference to ‘social norms’, 
6:180:11424:12:11:73:497:85:100:Times:100:Times:‘fairness’ and ‘ethics’ as important determinants in the wage setting process (Robinson, 2004; Prasch and 
6:181:11530:11:0:73:223:74:100:Times:100:Times:Sheth, 1999; Pollin and Luce, 1998). 
7:182:11568:0:20:109:515:758:144:Times:144:Times:Under these incomes policies, changes in minimum wages have been systematically 
7:183:11648:20:21:73:508:738:144:Times:144:Times:used as signals to indicate acceptable changes in wages more generally (Woodruff 1999).  
7:184:11737:21:21:73:503:717:144:Times:144:Times:Policy makers were interested in directly controlling wage increases as a way of quelling 
7:185:11827:21:20:73:504:696:144:Times:144:Times:increases in commodity and service prices and as a tool to avoid increases in government 
7:186:11916:20:21:73:479:676:144:Times:144:Times:payroll expenses.  As part of these stabilization programs, minimum wages were set 
7:187:11999:21:21:73:477:655:144:Times:144:Times:according to carefully calculated desired changes in prices and subject to budgetary 
7:188:12084:21:20:73:510:634:144:Times:144:Times:adjustments.  The negotiated increases in minimum wage levels were then supposed guide 
7:189:12171:20:21:73:511:614:144:Times:144:Times:wage negotiations throughout the economy.  The objective was to break ‘inertial inflation’ 
7:190:12262:21:21:73:499:593:144:Times:144:Times:(Lustig, 1998) – that is, to reduce ‘inflation expectations’.  These measures are typically 
7:191:12354:21:21:73:502:572:144:Times:144:Times:part of an overall social agreement involving workers and business representatives along 
7:192:12443:21:20:73:509:551:144:Times:144:Times:with government officials at the highest rank.  The best known of such agreements are the 
7:193:12533:20:21:73:310:531:144:Times:64:Times:various ‘Pactos de Solidaridad’ of 1987 to 1994.6
7:194:12582:21:21:109:474:510:144:Times:144:Times:Setting wages at minimum wage multiples is arguably more acceptable and 
7:195:12654:21:20:73:512:489:144:Times:144:Times:meaningful for low-skill workers than for high-skill workers.  Enforcement of stabilization 
7:196:12746:20:21:73:515:469:144:Times:144:Times:policies is also arguably easier for low-skill workers than for high-skill workers.  Woodruff 
7:197:12840:21:21:73:500:448:144:Times:144:Times:(1999) finds, for example, that wage drift away from stabilization targets in Mexico was 
7:198:12929:21:20:73:500:427:144:Times:144:Times:much greater for white-collar workers than for blue-collar workers during the late 1980s 
7:199:13018:20:21:73:517:407:144:Times:144:Times:and early 1990s.  This suggests that we might expect the influence of the minimum wage as 
7:200:13108:21:21:73:460:386:144:Times:144:Times:a reference price for labor to diminish in the upper tail of the wage distribution.

7:204:13223:21:21:109:487:303:144:Times:144:Times:The data used for the empirical analysis come from the Comisión Nacional de 
7:205:13299:21:20:73:496:282:144:Times:144:Times:Salarios Mínimos and from the Encuesta Nacional de Ingresos y Gastos de los Hogares 
7:206:13383:20:21:73:522:262:144:Times:144:Times:(ENIGH) for the years 1984, 1989, and 1992.  We focus specifically on the period of the late 
7:207:13476:21:21:73:498:241:144:Times:144:Times:1980s and the early 1990s because this was one of dramatic reductions in real minimum 
7:208:13562:21:20:73:477:220:144:Times:144:Times:wage levels in Mexico (Feliciano 1998).7  Stabilization polices were also especially 
7:209:13647:20:34:73:481:200:144:Times:64:Times:prominent in Mexico during the late 1980s and the early 1990s (Messmacher 2002).8

7:211:13786:7:16:73:485:159:42:Times:100:Times:6 Freeman (1993) cites the need for further research on the impact of stabilization policies on wages in 
7:212:13891:16:7:73:162:143:100:Times:100:Times:developing countries. 
7:213:13913:7:16:73:522:136:42:Times:100:Times:7 From the mid 1980s to the mid 1990s the real value of the minimum wage in Mexico declined by 54%, but by 
7:214:14019:16:12:73:496:120:100:Times:100:Times:only about 2% thereafter until 1999 (Source: Table 20, The Mexican Economy 1996 and 1999, Banco de 
7:215:14118:12:7:73:113:108:100:Times:100:Times:Mexico). 
7:216:14127:7:16:73:520:101:42:Times:100:Times:8 Castellanos et al. (2004) in their paper on nominal wage rigidities in Mexico conclude that the wage rigidities 
7:217:14241:16:11:73:497:85:100:Times:100:Times:and the effects of minimum wage were most prominent in the country during the late 1980s and the early 
7:218:14344:11:0:73:102:74:100:Times:100:Times:1990s. 
8:219:14352:0:20:73:521:758:144:Times:144:Times:The ENIGH is a national household survey of similar format for the years 1984, 1989, 1992, 
8:220:14443:20:21:73:515:738:144:Times:144:Times:and every two years thereafter.  Each survey is a stratified sample based on city size, with a 
8:221:14538:21:21:73:489:717:144:Times:144:Times:similar sampling distribution across the survey years, and with weights that render the 
8:222:14626:21:20:73:310:696:144:Times:144:Times:sample representative of the national experience. 
8:223:14676:20:21:109:524:676:144:Times:144:Times:The sample utilized in this analysis is of working individuals who are sixteen years of 
8:224:14764:21:21:73:489:655:144:Times:144:Times:age or older.  The earnings variable is the hourly wage and is computed from reported 
8:225:14850:21:20:73:522:634:144:Times:144:Times:earnings during the month before the survey and reported hours worked in the last week.  No 
8:226:14942:20:21:73:512:614:144:Times:144:Times:fringe benefits, tips, bonuses or commissions are included in the wage measure.  To ensure 
8:227:15033:21:21:73:507:593:144:Times:144:Times:an accurate measure of the wage, all those who are self-employed or working without pay 
8:228:15121:21:21:73:511:572:144:Times:144:Times:are excluded from the sample.  We also exclude from the analysis all those who hold more 
8:229:15210:21:20:73:138:551:144:Times:144:Times:than one job. 
8:230:15224:20:21:109:506:531:144:Times:144:Times:The data for daily minimum wages come from the Comisión Nacional de Salarios 
8:231:15301:21:21:73:508:510:144:Times:144:Times:Mínimos.  For each year of our survey we pick the minimum wage level corresponding to 
8:232:15387:21:20:73:524:489:144:Times:144:Times:the timing of the ENIGH survey.  For example, the 1984 ENIGH survey was conducted from 
8:233:15473:20:21:73:450:469:144:Times:144:Times:July to December and so we use the minimum wage level adopted on July 11. 
8:234:15547:21:21:109:523:448:144:Times:144:Times:Over the years of our analysis, the country was divided into different economic zones 
8:235:15633:21:20:73:519:427:144:Times:144:Times:and a minimum wage was set for each economic zone.  In 1984 there were eleven economic 
8:236:15720:20:21:73:502:407:144:Times:144:Times:zones, and by 1992 there were only three.  Some states in Mexico possess more than one 
8:237:15807:21:21:73:515:386:144:Times:144:Times:economic zone.  This presents a problem for our analysis because the ENIGH data allow us 
8:238:15896:21:20:73:523:365:144:Times:144:Times:to locate only the state of residence of respondents.  We are thus unable to associate a unique 
8:239:15992:20:21:73:513:345:144:Times:144:Times:minimum wage to every individual in our sample.  The analyzed sample therefore contains 
8:240:16080:21:21:73:522:324:144:Times:144:Times:only people for whom we can assign a unique minimum wage.  Using this selection criterion 
8:241:16170:21:21:73:518:303:144:Times:144:Times:we have individuals from thirteen states,9 encompassing three economic zones in 1984.  For 
8:242:16261:21:20:73:498:282:144:Times:144:Times:1992, we have individuals from twenty-five states (this includes all the thirteen states of 
8:243:16353:20:21:73:510:262:144:Times:144:Times:1984),10 encompassing two economic zones.  We have defined the zones consistently over 
8:244:16440:21:21:73:515:241:144:Times:144:Times:the two years; however two of the economic zones from 1984 were collapsed into one zone 
8:245:16528:21:31:73:493:220:144:Times:64:Times:in 1992 due to further reductions in the number of minimum wage regions in Mexico.11

8:251:17021:7:16:73:478:136:42:Times:100:Times:11 In 1984, our Zone A includes the states of Campeche and Zacatecas; Zone B includes the states of

8:253:17229:12:11:73:513:108:100:Times:100:Times:the states of Baja California Norte, Baja California Sur, and the Distrito Federal.  In 1992, the states from our 
8:254:17343:11:12:73:513:97:100:Times:100:Times:1984 Zone A and B are combined along with the states of Coahuila, Chiapas, Durango, Guanajuato, Hidalgo,

9:303:18596:44:21:109:517:409:144:Times:144:Times:The cumulative wage distributions for 1984 and 1992 are presented in Figures 1 and 
9:304:18679:21:20:73:494:388:144:Times:144:Times:2 respectively.  The most notable characteristic of these distributions with regard to the 
9:305:18770:20:21:73:487:368:144:Times:144:Times:subject of this paper is the existence of significant clustering at certain intervals in the 
9:306:18863:21:21:73:486:347:144:Times:144:Times:distributions.13  In Figures 3 through 7 we present the cumulative distributions for the 
9:307:18952:21:20:73:479:326:144:Times:144:Times:separate economic zones in 1984 and 1992, with 0.25 multiples of the zone-specific 
9:308:19035:20:21:73:475:306:144:Times:144:Times:minimum wages as overlays.  Given the various forms of measurement error in our 
9:309:19115:21:21:73:511:285:144:Times:144:Times:computation of both the hourly wage (which is derived from information on monthly labor 
9:310:19203:21:20:73:523:264:144:Times:144:Times:income and hours worked in the previous week) and the hourly minimum wage (which is the 
9:311:19291:20:21:73:505:244:144:Times:144:Times:official daily minimum divided by eight), even if minimum wage policies account for the 
9:312:19379:21:21:73:524:223:144:Times:144:Times:wage clusters, it is reasonable to expect the wage clusters and minimum wage multiples to be 
9:313:19472:21:21:73:199:202:144:Times:144:Times:less than perfect matches. 
9:314:19499:21:20:109:513:181:144:Times:144:Times:In our view, the matches are surprising for both their extent and accuracy.  In 1984, 
9:315:19585:20:21:73:517:161:144:Times:144:Times:for example, the largest clusters in the wage distributions match up perfectly with minimum 
9:316:19677:21:32:73:518:140:144:Times:144:Times:wage multiples, except in Figure 5 where the “matches” are close but not exact.  The graphs 
9:317:19769:32:7:217:220:108:100:Times:100:Times: 
9:318:19769:7:11:73:517:101:42:Times:100:Times:12 For details on how the nonparametric kernel density is estimated refer to Pagan and Ullah (1999, chapter 2). 
9:319:19881:11:16:73:523:90:42:Times:100:Times:13 The clustering we observe is not due to rounding in either reported monthly income or hours worked.  Within 
9:320:19992:16:0:73:463:74:100:Times:100:Times:a given hourly wage cluster we observe numerous values for monthly income and hours worked. 
10:321:20085:0:20:73:511:758:144:Times:144:Times:reveal some clustering around the minimum wage, but these are far from the most sizeable 
10:322:20174:20:21:73:516:738:144:Times:144:Times:clusters in the graphs.  Moreover, matches exist both above and below the wage minimum.  
10:323:20263:21:21:73:518:717:144:Times:144:Times:Finally, and somewhat more speculatively, it appears that the extent of matching diminishes 
10:324:20355:21:20:73:396:696:144:Times:144:Times:as one moves out towards the upper tails of the wage distributions. 
10:325:20423:20:21:109:498:676:144:Times:144:Times:The evidence is very similar for the 1992 distributions in Figures 6 and 7, with a 
10:326:20506:21:21:73:506:655:144:Times:144:Times:couple of important exceptions.  First, it appears as though the extent of matching is even 
10:327:20598:21:20:73:515:634:144:Times:144:Times:greater for this year than for 1984.  This may be related to the highly significant and widely 
10:328:20693:20:21:73:506:614:144:Times:144:Times:publicized stabilization agreements of the late 1980s, which may have served to reinforce 
10:329:20783:21:21:73:517:593:144:Times:144:Times:minimum wage multiples as wage norms.  Second, there are fewer clusters, and virtually no 
10:330:20873:21:21:73:514:572:144:Times:144:Times:matches between clusters and minimum wage multiples, in the wage distribution below the 
10:331:20961:21:20:73:524:551:144:Times:144:Times:minimum wage.  This is presumably an indication of just how far minimum wages had fallen 
10:332:21050:20:21:73:509:531:144:Times:144:Times:in the intervening period.  The absence of matches among the first few intervals above the 
10:333:21141:21:21:73:285:510:144:Times:144:Times:wage minimums is another such indication. 
10:334:21183:21:20:109:492:489:144:Times:144:Times:Some of the matching we observe between minimum wage multiples and wage 
10:335:21255:20:21:73:512:469:144:Times:144:Times:clusters may be due to occupational minimum wages, a portion of which are set at exact or 
10:336:21345:21:21:73:464:448:144:Times:144:Times:near multiples of the general minimum wage.  In 1993, for example, 45 of the 88 
10:337:21425:21:20:73:495:427:144:Times:144:Times:occupational minimum wages in Zone C fell within a 5% range around multiples of the 
10:338:21509:20:21:73:487:407:144:Times:144:Times:minimum wage.14  This is yet another example of how the minimum wage serves as a 
10:339:21590:21:21:73:330:386:144:Times:144:Times:reference price for wage setting above the minimum. 
10:340:21642:21:20:109:505:365:144:Times:144:Times:Our data lack occupational categories at the level of detail for which occupational 
10:341:21726:20:21:73:483:345:144:Times:144:Times:minimum wages are defined, and so we cannot say to what extent these occupational 
10:342:21808:21:21:73:511:324:144:Times:144:Times:minimum wages are binding for relevant groups of workers.  If the occupational minimum 
10:343:21894:21:21:73:499:303:144:Times:144:Times:wages were primarily responsible for the matching we observe between multiples of the 
10:344:21980:21:20:73:523:282:144:Times:144:Times:minimum wage and wage clusters in the figures, our contention that general minimum wages 
10:345:22069:20:21:73:493:262:144:Times:144:Times:serve as a norm for wage setting above the minimum would be undercut.  The matches 
10:346:22152:21:21:73:507:241:144:Times:144:Times:would be explained by occupational minimum wage requirements, not formal or informal 
10:347:22237:21:20:73:514:220:144:Times:144:Times:wage setting norms.  It is clear from the figures, however, that this is not the case.  None of 
10:348:22332:20:21:73:520:200:144:Times:144:Times:the occupational minimum wages exceeds two times the minimum wage, and the matches at 
10:349:22418:21:21:73:492:179:144:Times:144:Times:two times the minimum wage or lower are by no means the dominant matches in these 
10:350:22500:21:20:73:509:158:144:Times:144:Times:figures.  In fact, the most significant matches, in terms of both numbers and the size of the 
10:351:22594:20:21:73:521:138:144:Times:144:Times:wage cluster, occur in the mid-to-lower range of the distribution – above two and below four 
10:352:22687:21:20:73:204:117:144:Times:144:Times:times the minimum wage.  
10:353:22712:20:7:73:220:97:100:Times:100:Times:                                                           
10:354:22770:7:16:73:511:90:42:Times:100:Times:14 Of these 45, 17 were within 5% of 1.25 times the minimum wage, 24 within 5% of 1.5 times the minimum 
10:355:22874:16:0:73:457:74:100:Times:100:Times:wage, 2 within 5% of 1.75 times the minimum, and 2 within 5% of 2 times the minimum wage. 
11:356:22965:0:20:109:501:758:144:Times:144:Times:The graphs give a visual depiction of the amount of clustering in the data and the 
11:357:23048:20:21:73:517:738:144:Times:144:Times:extent to which multiples of minimum wages match up with these clusters.  Table 2 offers a 
11:358:23139:21:21:73:515:717:144:Times:144:Times:numerical depiction of the extent of matching between multiples of the minimum wage and 
11:359:23227:21:20:73:502:696:144:Times:144:Times:wages.  It does so under three different assumptions regarding errors in measurement.  If 
11:360:23317:20:21:73:521:676:144:Times:144:Times:there were no errors in measuring either hourly minimum wages or hourly wages, the hourly 
11:361:23407:21:21:73:514:655:144:Times:144:Times:wage would have to be exactly equal to a multiple of the hourly minimum wage in order to 
11:362:23496:21:20:73:486:634:144:Times:144:Times:be legitimately labeled a match.  The numbers in column (1) invoke this assumption.  
11:363:23581:20:21:73:522:614:144:Times:144:Times:However, given that both hourly minimum wages and hourly wages are measured with some 
11:364:23667:21:21:73:524:593:144:Times:144:Times:imprecision, we might also label as a match those instances in which the two are equal to one 
11:365:23761:21:21:73:289:572:144:Times:144:Times:another but within some fixed band of error. 
11:366:23806:21:21:109:497:551:144:Times:144:Times:In columns (2) and (3), we allow for fixed bands of error of 025.0± and  
11:367:23878:21:0:73:436:530:144:Times:144:Times:respectively.  In constructing the bands, we have done the following: Let W
11:368:23953:0:22:480:469:551:150:Times:150:g_d0_f10:05.0±
11:369:23958:22:19:436:514:529:64:Times:144:Times:i be the wage of 
11:370:23974:19:21:73:482:510:144:Times:144:Times:individual i in any one of the economic zones and MW be the minimum wage of that 
11:371:24055:21:21:73:515:489:144:Times:144:Times:economic zone.  We define Di = Wi / MW.  If Di = 0.25 then Wi is an exact 0.25 multiple of 
11:372:24144:21:20:73:520:468:144:Times:144:Times:the MW.  However because of potential measurement error in the data we consider instances 
11:373:24234:20:22:73:511:448:144:Times:144:Times:where the matches are not exact, but rather exist within fixed bands of error.  For example, 
11:374:24327:22:24:73:516:426:144:Times:144:Times:the  band means that if  then we consider W05.0±)3.0,2.0(∈iDi as a 0.25 multiple of the 
11:375:24415:24:21:73:99:402:144:Times:144:Times:MW. 
11:376:24419:21:20:109:495:381:144:Times:144:Times:A cluster is defined as a grouping of workers earning the same hourly wage and 
11:377:24498:20:22:73:504:361:144:Times:144:Times:composing at least 2% of the sample.  We chose the 2% threshold by invoking a series of 
11:378:24586:22:25:73:521:339:144:Times:144:Times:proportions tests.  Suppose that at wage  there are  number of people, or  proportion 
11:379:24672:25:25:73:521:314:144:Times:144:Times:of the sample, where  and n is the sample size.  The first proportions test involves 
11:380:24757:25:25:73:521:289:144:Times:144:Times:a test of the statistical significance of the max  against all the other ’s in the sample.  If 
11:381:24852:25:24:73:501:264:144:Times:144:Times:max  is statistically significantly different from all other proportions, then we say that 
11:382:24942:24:20:73:509:240:144:Times:144:Times:there is a statistically significant cluster of people at that particular wage.  We do the same 
11:383:25038:20:21:73:524:220:144:Times:144:Times:for the next largest proportion in the sample, and if that is also significantly different from all 
11:384:25138:21:21:73:490:199:144:Times:144:Times:the remaining proportions in the sample then we call that a cluster as well.  This test is 
11:385:25229:21:21:73:516:178:144:Times:144:Times:repeated recursively until we arrive at a cluster that is not statistically significantly different 
11:386:25329:21:20:73:518:157:144:Times:144:Times:from all remaining clusters in the sample.  Utilizing this test, the 2% threshold is if anything 
11:387:25426:20:0:73:137:137:144:Times:144:Times:conservative.

11:394:25518:7:16:73:515:101:42:Times:100:Times:15 According to the statistical procedure, the 2% threshold is just about right for the 1984 data, but it is far too 
11:395:25635:16:11:73:490:85:100:Times:100:Times:conservative for the 1992 data, where a much lower threshold for defining a cluster would pass a test of 
11:396:25740:11:0:73:167:74:100:Times:100:Times:statistical significance. 
12:397:25767:0:20:109:513:758:144:Times:144:Times:Using the above definition of a cluster, there are 18 clusters in 1984 and 13 clusters 
12:398:25854:20:21:73:502:738:144:Times:144:Times:in 1992.  The column (1) results show that 17% of these clusters match 0.25 multiples of 
12:399:25943:21:21:73:508:717:144:Times:144:Times:minimum wages in 1984, but that there are no exact matches in 1992.  However, allowing 
12:400:26030:21:21:73:514:696:144:Times:144:Times:for a fixed band of error in the matching process, the percentage of matches rises to 44% in 
12:401:26123:21:21:73:518:675:144:Times:144:Times:1984 and 69% in 1992 using a  band, and to 72% and 77% in respective years using 
12:402:26204:21:0:73:147:654:144:Times:144:Times:a  band.

12:405:26224:21:20:109:524:633:144:Times:144:Times:In the final three rows of results for each year we give the incidence of matches in the 
12:406:26313:20:21:73:490:613:144:Times:144:Times:sample, whether part of a cluster or not, and the percentage of the entire sample that is 
12:407:26402:21:21:73:511:592:144:Times:144:Times:matched (the proportion of the sample earning the minimum wage or some multiple of it).  
12:408:26491:21:20:73:515:571:144:Times:144:Times:Here, we ignore the issue of clusters and inquire about the extent of matching in the overall 
12:409:26585:20:21:73:477:551:144:Times:144:Times:sample.  Once again, we do this under different assumptions regarding the extent of 
12:410:26669:21:21:73:514:530:144:Times:144:Times:measurement error in the data.  About 3% of the sample in 1984 has a wage that is an exact 
12:411:26760:21:21:73:511:509:144:Times:144:Times:multiple of the minimum wage, while for 1992 there are no exact matches.  Allowing for a 
12:412:26849:21:21:73:519:488:144:Times:144:Times:fixed band of error of 025.0± yields an increase in the percentage of the sample matched to 
12:413:26941:21:21:73:510:467:144:Times:144:Times:24% and 30% in respective years.  And finally, for the larger fixed band of , almost 
12:414:27026:21:21:73:513:446:144:Times:144:Times:44 % of the sample in 1984 and 45% of the sample in 1992 has a wage that is a multiple of 
12:415:27116:21:0:73:172:425:144:Times:144:Times:the minimum wage.

12:417:27139:62:21:109:475:405:144:Times:144:Times:The visual depictions and descriptive statistics lend support to the view that 
12:418:27218:21:21:73:501:384:144:Times:144:Times:minimum wages act as a reference price for labor in Mexico in that there appears to be a 
12:419:27307:21:20:73:514:363:144:Times:144:Times:significant amount of matching between minimum wage multiples and wages.  However, it 
12:420:27393:20:21:73:494:343:144:Times:144:Times:is also important to ask whether these matches are significant in a statistical sense.  We 
12:421:27484:21:21:73:498:322:144:Times:144:Times:indicate with an asterisk in Table 2 those instances in which statistical tests revealed the 
12:422:27577:21:20:73:515:301:144:Times:144:Times:matches to be significantly different from zero.  The proportion of clusters matched and the 
12:423:27670:20:21:73:502:281:144:Times:144:Times:proportion of samples matched in Table 2 were significantly different from zero in every 
12:424:27759:21:21:73:428:260:144:Times:144:Times:instance in which we allow for a margin of error in the matching process. 
12:425:27833:21:21:109:510:239:144:Times:144:Times:A visual inspection of the graphs reveals not only that hourly wages cluster around 
12:426:27917:21:20:73:491:218:144:Times:144:Times:multiples of the minimum wage, but that this matching of clusters and minimum wage 
12:427:28000:20:21:73:496:198:144:Times:144:Times:multiples exists both above and below the stipulated minimum.  Because so few formal 
12:428:28085:21:21:73:522:177:144:Times:144:Times:sector workers receive wages below the minimum wage, this raises an issue of the normative 
12:429:28176:21:20:73:520:156:144:Times:144:Times:influence of minimum wages on pay in the informal sector, which, in the conventional view, 
12:430:28267:20:0:73:483:136:144:Times:144:Times:is presumed to be immune to minimum wage policies.  We replicated the graphs and 
13:431:28350:0:20:73:518:758:144:Times:144:Times:descriptive statistics presented above for the formal and informal sectors separately.16  They 
13:432:28445:20:21:73:523:738:144:Times:144:Times:reveal that the normative impact of minimum wages on the wage structure is as significant in 
13:433:28538:21:21:73:300:717:144:Times:144:Times:the informal sector as it is in the formal sector. 
13:434:28589:21:20:109:522:696:144:Times:144:Times:The cumulative wage distributions for the formal and informal sectors suggest just as 
13:435:28675:20:21:73:498:676:144:Times:144:Times:much clustering and matching of clusters with minimum wage multiples in the informal 
13:436:28760:21:21:73:515:655:144:Times:144:Times:sector as in the formal sector.  This is confirmed in the descriptive statistics shown in Table 
13:437:28856:21:20:73:512:634:144:Times:144:Times:3, where, in the informal sector for the year 1984, the number of clusters, the proportion of 
13:438:28950:20:21:73:519:614:144:Times:144:Times:matched clusters and the proportion of matches in the overall sample generally exceed those 
13:439:29042:21:21:73:509:593:144:Times:144:Times:in the formal sector.  In 1992, while the number of clusters is larger in the informal sector, 
13:440:29137:21:21:73:508:572:144:Times:144:Times:the proportion of matched clusters and the proportion of matches in the overall sample are 
13:441:29228:21:20:73:256:551:144:Times:144:Times:generally greater in the formal sector. 
13:442:29268:20:21:109:521:531:144:Times:144:Times:A final, and somewhat more speculative, conclusion one might draw from the graphs 
13:443:29350:21:21:73:498:510:144:Times:144:Times:of cumulative wage distributions in Figures 3-7 is that the matching between wages and 
13:444:29437:21:20:73:516:489:144:Times:144:Times:minimum wage multiples is more pronounced in the mid-to-lower tails of the distributions.  
13:445:29528:20:21:73:486:469:144:Times:144:Times:If true, this would indicate that the normative role of minimum wages in the Mexican 
13:446:29613:21:21:73:486:448:144:Times:144:Times:economy has a greater impact on low-wage workers than on high-wage workers, and, 
13:447:29694:21:20:73:518:427:144:Times:144:Times:somewhat more speculatively, that changes in minimum wage policies might therefore have 
13:448:29782:20:21:73:268:407:144:Times:144:Times:a significant impact on wage inequality. 
13:449:29823:21:21:109:500:386:144:Times:144:Times:One way to subject this issue to the rigors of statistical testing is by investigating 
13:450:29910:21:20:73:504:365:144:Times:144:Times:statistical correlation.  Suppose we utilize the data on the wages of individuals to create a 
13:451:30004:20:21:73:518:345:144:Times:144:Times:dichotomous variable that equals 1 if the individual is paid a multiple of the minimum wage 
13:452:30096:21:21:73:507:324:144:Times:144:Times:and 0 if not.17  We can then ask whether there is any correlation between this variable and 
13:453:30188:21:21:73:521:303:144:Times:144:Times:the wages of individuals.  A negative and significant correlation would indicate that matches 
13:454:30282:21:20:73:487:282:144:Times:144:Times:are statistically more likely to be found among low-wage workers.  The results of this 
13:455:30369:20:21:73:522:262:144:Times:144:Times:analysis reveal a negative and statistically significant relationship (at the .05 level, one-tailed 
13:456:30469:21:21:73:495:241:144:Times:144:Times:test) between wages and being paid a multiple of the minimum wage for both 1984 and 
13:457:30553:21:20:73:497:220:144:Times:144:Times:1992.  These findings thus suggest that the pay of low-skill workers is more likely to be 
13:458:30643:20:21:73:432:200:144:Times:144:Times:influenced by minimum wage norms than is the pay of high-skill workers.

13:461:30772:7:16:73:516:102:42:Times:100:Times:16 We define formal sector workers as those who qualify for certain state-provided social benefits, the costs of 
13:462:30884:16:7:73:286:86:100:Times:100:Times:which are partially paid for by registered employers. 
13:463:30938:7:0:73:135:79:42:Times:88:g_d0_f10:17 We use the  band of error in labeling the wage and multiples of the minimum wage a “match.” 05.0±
14:464:31040:0:20:73:379:758:144:Times:144:Times:4. Changing Minimum Wage Levels and Changing Wages 
14:465:31090:20:21:109:500:738:144:Times:144:Times:There is a second way in which minimum wages might serve as a norm for wage 
14:466:31166:21:21:73:514:717:144:Times:144:Times:setting in Mexico – annual changes in minimum wage levels might form the basis for wage 
14:467:31254:21:20:73:504:696:144:Times:144:Times:changes more generally throughout the economy.  Indeed, this was an explicit goal of the 
14:468:31343:20:21:73:515:676:144:Times:144:Times:various stabilization programs Mexico undertook during the late 1980s to quell inflationary 
14:469:31435:21:21:73:478:655:144:Times:144:Times:pressures.  Obviously, if informal wage norms tie wages to specific multiples of the 
14:470:31520:21:20:73:519:634:144:Times:144:Times:minimum wage, as we argue above, and this multiple remains constant over time, then some 
14:471:31609:20:21:73:514:614:144:Times:144:Times:wage changes will indeed accord precisely with minimum wage changes.  Moreover, given 
14:472:31695:21:21:73:482:593:144:Times:144:Times:evidence that this normative effect has a greater impact on the lower tail of the wage 
14:473:31782:21:21:73:514:572:144:Times:144:Times:distribution, the declining real value of the minimum wage in Mexico might be expected to 
14:474:31872:21:20:73:453:551:144:Times:144:Times:account for some of the growing wage inequality we observe over this period.  
14:475:31950:20:21:109:500:531:144:Times:144:Times:However, wages do not seem to be tied to unchanging multiples of the minimum 
14:476:32027:21:21:73:519:510:144:Times:144:Times:wage during these years.  The modal minimum wage multiple in 1984 was 1.25, whereas by 
14:477:32114:21:20:73:476:489:144:Times:144:Times:1992 it had risen to 1.75.  We believe the reason for this is that the real value of the 
14:478:32203:20:21:73:506:469:144:Times:144:Times:minimum wage declined so dramatically over these years that, to maintain adequate labor 
14:479:32291:21:21:73:508:448:144:Times:144:Times:supply and a basic standard of living for low-skill workers, employers had to either adjust 
14:480:32383:21:20:73:498:427:144:Times:144:Times:upward the multiples of the minimum wage to which they adhered or abandon the norm 
14:481:32465:20:21:73:517:407:144:Times:144:Times:altogether.  The results in Table 2 suggest that employers did not entirely abandon the norm 
14:482:32557:21:21:73:524:386:144:Times:144:Times:in the later period.  The rising modal minimum wage multiple cited above suggests that some 
14:483:32649:21:20:73:515:365:144:Times:144:Times:merely adjusted upward the normative multiple.  Because stabilization policies were also in 
14:484:32741:20:21:73:481:345:144:Times:144:Times:effect over this period, linking changes in the minimum wage to wage changes more 
14:485:32823:21:21:73:517:324:144:Times:144:Times:generally throughout the wage distribution, there remains the question of whether minimum 
14:486:32913:21:21:73:451:303:144:Times:144:Times:wage changes had a greater impact on the lower tail of the wage distribution.   
14:487:32993:21:20:109:520:282:144:Times:144:Times:Preliminary evidence on this second normative role of minimum wages can be found 
14:488:33074:20:21:73:464:262:144:Times:144:Times:in an across-zone comparison of changes over time in minimum wage levels and 
14:489:33151:21:21:73:522:241:144:Times:144:Times:accompanying changes in the average wages of particular groups of workers.  We are able to 
14:490:33242:21:20:73:499:220:144:Times:144:Times:compute average wage changes for various groups of workers – for union and nonunion 
14:491:33326:20:21:73:503:200:144:Times:144:Times:workers, formal and informal sector workers, and for certain occupational categories, for 
14:492:33416:21:21:73:524:179:144:Times:144:Times:instance – with the 1984, 1989, and 1992 survey data.  How do changes in average wages for 
14:493:33507:21:20:73:424:158:144:Times:144:Times:these worker groups accord with changes over time in minimum wages? 
14:494:33574:20:21:109:516:138:144:Times:144:Times:An important channel through which minimum wages might influence wages is that 
14:495:33653:21:21:73:511:117:144:Times:144:Times:the percentage change agreed to in minimum wage agreements becomes the benchmark, if 
14:496:33738:21:21:73:507:96:144:Times:144:Times:not the rule, for collective bargaining outcomes in the union sector.  Labor negotiations in 
14:497:33831:21:0:73:515:75:144:Times:144:Times:unionized labor markets are subject to approval by government arbitration boards, allowing 
15:498:33924:0:20:73:482:758:144:Times:144:Times:for greater enforcement of stabilization policies limiting wage increases to stipulated 
15:499:34012:20:21:73:497:738:144:Times:144:Times:increases in the wage minimum in this sector as compared, say, to the nonunion sector.  
15:500:34100:21:21:73:476:717:144:Times:144:Times:Greater enforcement might also be expected in the formal sector of the economy as 
15:501:34182:21:20:73:244:696:144:Times:144:Times:compared with the informal sector. 
15:502:34217:20:21:109:519:676:144:Times:144:Times:When we conduct this exercise for both union and nonunion workers and formal and 
15:503:34298:21:21:73:508:655:144:Times:144:Times:informal sector workers, nothing very striking emerges.  In Table 4A, the economic zones 
15:504:34387:21:20:73:507:634:144:Times:144:Times:are ranked from 1 to 3 according to the extent of increase in minimum wages (1 being the 
15:505:34476:20:21:73:499:614:144:Times:144:Times:largest), and these various worker groups are similarly ranked according to the extent of 
15:506:34566:21:21:73:520:593:144:Times:144:Times:wage increase for each group across zones.  If the wages of union and formal sector workers 
15:507:34658:21:21:73:524:572:144:Times:144:Times:follow more closely changes in minimum wages than do the wages of nonunion and informal 
15:508:34746:21:20:73:519:551:144:Times:144:Times:sector workers, then the ranking of wage changes for the former groups should more closely 
15:509:34837:20:21:73:431:531:144:Times:144:Times:approximate the ranking of minimum wage changes.  This is not the case. 
15:510:34909:21:21:109:497:510:144:Times:144:Times:However, stabilization programs in Mexico during this period date from the late 
15:511:34989:21:20:73:513:489:144:Times:144:Times:1980s to the early 1990s.  Are our results altered if we limit the analysis to the period 1989 
15:512:35084:20:21:73:511:469:144:Times:144:Times:to 1992?  The results are shown in Table 4B.  Over this more restricted time period, wages 
15:513:35175:21:21:73:502:448:144:Times:144:Times:do appear to follow more closely changes in minimum wage levels across zones for both 
15:514:35261:21:20:73:491:427:144:Times:144:Times:union and formal sector workers.  However, this is true for nonunion workers as well.  
15:515:35348:20:21:73:514:407:144:Times:144:Times:Indeed, the only sector whose wage increases are not linked with increases in the minimum 
15:516:35438:21:21:73:517:386:144:Times:144:Times:wage is the informal sector of the economy.  These findings give suggestive evidence to the 
15:517:35530:21:20:73:518:365:144:Times:144:Times:claim that stabilization programs were successful in restraining wage increases in all but the 
15:518:35625:20:21:73:513:345:144:Times:144:Times:informal sector during the period of the late 1980s and early 1990s.  They also suggest that 
15:519:35718:21:21:73:516:324:144:Times:144:Times:the second normative role of minimum wages operates through government enforcement of 
15:520:35804:21:21:73:505:303:144:Times:144:Times:policy measures as well as through informal norms hammered out by firms and workers.  
15:521:35890:21:20:109:515:282:144:Times:144:Times:The above exercise makes use of very few observations, thereby limiting our ability 
15:522:35974:20:21:73:498:262:144:Times:144:Times:to draw strong conclusions.  The number of observations can be increased substantially, 
15:523:36062:21:21:73:518:241:144:Times:144:Times:however, if we focus on occupational categories.  In Table 5, we rank on a scale from 1 to 3 
15:524:36155:21:20:73:511:220:144:Times:144:Times:the changes in minimum wage levels across the three economic zones (1 being the largest) 
15:525:36244:20:21:73:518:200:144:Times:144:Times:and the corresponding ranking of changes in average occupational wages across these zones 
15:526:36334:21:21:73:513:179:144:Times:144:Times:for the eleven 2-digit occupational codes for which we have information from the surveys.  
15:527:36425:21:20:73:519:158:144:Times:144:Times:Note that if minimum wage changes across economic zones reflected only differences in the 
15:528:36515:20:21:73:514:138:144:Times:144:Times:increased cost-of-living, we would expect the rankings of all occupational wage changes to 
15:529:36606:21:21:73:500:117:144:Times:144:Times:be similar to the rankings of minimum wage changes.  They are not, which suggests that 
15:530:36693:21:21:73:517:96:144:Times:144:Times:minimum wage changes may serve as a norm for wage changes across occupational groups, 
15:531:36779:21:0:73:489:75:144:Times:144:Times:and do so with differential impact across the occupational, and thus wage distribution. 
16:532:36869:0:20:109:524:758:144:Times:144:Times:Among the four occupational groups whose ranking of wage changes match perfectly 
16:533:36950:20:21:73:491:738:144:Times:144:Times:the ranking of minimum wage changes across zones are agricultural workers, personal 
16:534:37034:21:21:73:516:717:144:Times:144:Times:service workers, and transportation workers. Workers in these three occupational categories 
16:535:37126:21:20:73:496:696:144:Times:144:Times:fall disproportionately into the mid-to-lower tail of the overall wage distribution.  Thus, 
16:536:37218:20:21:73:492:676:144:Times:144:Times:these results offer suggestive evidence that minimum wage changes have their greatest 
16:537:37304:21:21:73:283:655:144:Times:144:Times:impact on low-skill and low-paid workers.  
16:538:37347:21:20:109:506:634:144:Times:144:Times:In Tables 6A and B, we explore this aspect a bit further.  Suppose we rank, within 
16:539:37430:20:21:73:512:614:144:Times:144:Times:each zone, the occupations from lowest to highest (1 being lowest and 11 being highest) in 
16:540:37521:21:21:73:514:593:144:Times:144:Times:terms of hourly pay in 1984.18  And suppose we assign, within each zone, a value from 1 to 
16:541:37612:21:21:73:504:572:144:Times:144:Times:11 to each of these occupational categories, reflecting the proximity – furthest equaling 1 
16:542:37704:21:20:73:503:551:144:Times:144:Times:and closest equaling 11 – of the wage change for that occupation to the actual percentage 
16:543:37794:20:21:73:484:531:144:Times:144:Times:change in the minimum wage level for that zone.  Finally, suppose we then add these 
16:544:37878:21:21:73:520:510:144:Times:144:Times:numbers across the zones for each occupational ranking.  If minimum wage changes act as a 
16:545:37968:21:20:73:516:489:144:Times:144:Times:norm for wage changes, and they do so more for the lower tail of the wage distribution than 
16:546:38060:20:21:73:494:469:144:Times:144:Times:the upper tail, then the sums should be higher for the lowest paid occupational groups.  
16:547:38149:21:21:109:512:448:144:Times:144:Times:The pattern we observe in the final columns of Tables 6A and B is reflective of just 
16:548:38234:21:20:73:523:427:144:Times:144:Times:such an effect.  The simple correlation between the rankings in the first column and the sums 
16:549:38328:20:21:73:524:407:144:Times:144:Times:in the last column is – 0.42 for the period 1984 to 1992, and –0.56 for the stabilization period 
16:550:38425:21:21:73:508:386:144:Times:144:Times:of the late 1980s and early 1990s (both statistically significant at the 0.10 level, one-tailed 
16:551:38521:21:20:73:516:365:144:Times:144:Times:test).  This suggests that wage changes are more closely aligned to changes in the minimum 
16:552:38611:20:21:73:518:345:144:Times:144:Times:wage for low-skill workers.  Focusing on the specific patterns in the last columns, it appears 
16:553:38706:21:21:73:516:324:144:Times:144:Times:that the normative impact is most prominent in the mid-to-lower tail of the pay distribution.

16:555:38800:21:20:73:379:282:144:Times:144:Times:5. Minimum Wage Norms and Changing Wage Inequality 
16:556:38850:20:21:109:522:262:144:Times:144:Times:Evidence suggests that the declining real value of the U.S. minimum wage during the 
16:557:38934:21:21:73:492:241:144:Times:144:Times:1980s accounts for a significant portion of the growing wage inequality in this country 
16:558:39021:21:20:73:499:220:144:Times:144:Times:(DiNardo et al. 1996; Fortin and Lemieux 1997).  The argument for the U.S. however is 
16:559:39107:20:21:73:520:200:144:Times:144:Times:typically one of general equilibrium adjustment (Grossman 1983; Card and Krueger 1995) – 
16:560:39196:21:21:73:502:179:144:Times:144:Times:the minimum wage is binding for low-wage workers, and changes in the minimum wage 
16:561:39278:21:20:73:507:158:144:Times:144:Times:primarily affect this group of workers and perhaps a small number of other workers in the 
16:562:39368:20:30:73:514:138:144:Times:144:Times:lower tail of the wage distribution through labor substitution effects.  Our analysis suggests 
16:563:39463:30:7:73:220:108:100:Times:100:Times:                                                           
16:564:39521:7:16:73:510:101:42:Times:100:Times:18 The rankings of occupations are not exactly the same across zones, although they are roughly similar.  For 
16:565:39630:16:11:73:507:85:100:Times:100:Times:example, the lowest paid occupation is the same across all three zones, as is the highest paid occupation.  In 
16:566:39740:11:0:73:378:74:100:Times:100:Times:between, the ordering follows a general pattern, but is not exactly the same. 
17:567:39820:0:20:73:522:758:144:Times:144:Times:that in Mexico, by contrast, while the minimum wage is not especially binding at the level of 
17:568:39914:20:21:73:475:738:144:Times:144:Times:the minimum, it serves as a powerful norm for wage setting beyond the level of the 
17:569:39997:21:21:73:499:717:144:Times:144:Times:minimum.  Thus, when real minimum wages decline, in the US it is the workers earning 
17:570:40082:21:20:73:511:696:144:Times:144:Times:around the minimum wage who suffer a wage loss, whereas in Mexico wages decline for a 
17:571:40168:20:21:73:506:676:144:Times:144:Times:much larger portion of the lower tail of the wage distribution – i.e., that portion for which 
17:572:40262:21:21:73:305:655:144:Times:64:Times:minimum wages serve as a wage setting norm.19
17:573:40307:21:20:109:506:634:144:Times:144:Times:In this section we offer further evidence on the effect of minimum wage norms on 
17:574:40388:20:21:73:524:614:144:Times:144:Times:changing wage inequality in Mexico over the period of the 1980s and 1990s.  Figure 8 shows 
17:575:40479:21:21:73:492:593:144:Times:144:Times:the trajectory of the real value of the minimum wage and the coefficient of variation (a 
17:576:40568:21:21:73:512:572:144:Times:144:Times:common measure of wage dispersion)20 over these years.  The results are suggestive: wage 
17:577:40657:21:20:73:516:551:144:Times:144:Times:dispersion rises significantly when the real value of the minimum wage is falling, but levels 
17:578:40751:20:21:73:515:531:144:Times:144:Times:off in the mid-1990s, just as the decline in minimum wages is abated.  There are alternative 
17:579:40844:21:21:73:479:510:144:Times:144:Times:explanations for the observed trajectory in wage inequality over this period (see, for 
17:580:40931:21:20:73:515:489:144:Times:144:Times:example, Fairris 2003 and Behrman et al. 2000) but its synchronization with changes in the 
17:581:41022:20:21:73:285:469:144:Times:144:Times:real value of the minimum wage is telling.   
17:582:41067:21:21:109:512:448:144:Times:144:Times:Although the household survey data are not ideally suited for a careful examination 
17:583:41151:21:20:73:507:427:144:Times:144:Times:of the link between minimum wage norms and changing wage inequality over this period, 
17:584:41237:20:21:73:524:407:144:Times:144:Times:they do allow a few further insights into the possibility of such a link.  We established results 
17:585:41335:21:21:73:515:386:144:Times:144:Times:earlier in the paper that minimum wage norms have their impact on the mid-to-lower tail of 
17:586:41426:21:20:73:483:365:144:Times:144:Times:the wage distribution.  This suggests a hypothesis about the nature of changing wage 
17:587:41511:20:21:73:505:345:144:Times:144:Times:inequality over the period.  If the link between minimum wage norms and changing wage 
17:588:41597:21:21:73:501:324:144:Times:144:Times:inequality has validity, wage inequality should evolve in the following manner: (a) there 
17:589:41687:21:21:73:508:303:144:Times:144:Times:should be relative stasis in wage dispersion for that portion of the wage distribution that is 
17:590:41782:21:20:73:519:282:144:Times:144:Times:affected by minimum wage norms and rising dispersion among the unaffected portion of the 
17:591:41871:20:21:73:485:262:144:Times:144:Times:distribution, and (b) there should be declining real wages for that portion of the wage 
17:592:41959:21:21:73:517:241:144:Times:144:Times:distribution affected by minimum wage norms and perhaps steady or even rising real wages 
17:593:42048:21:20:73:380:220:144:Times:144:Times:for the unaffected portion.  These hypotheses are tested below.  
17:594:42113:20:21:109:518:200:144:Times:144:Times:We begin by apportioning workers in each of the two minimum wage zones existing 
17:595:42193:21:21:73:515:179:144:Times:144:Times:in 1992 into “affected” and “unaffected” groups for the years 1984 and 1992.  In each case, 
17:596:42285:21:27:73:509:158:144:Times:144:Times:the affected group is composed of those workers who earn a wage less than or equal to the 
17:597:42375:27:7:73:220:131:100:Times:100:Times:                                                           
17:598:42433:7:16:73:506:124:42:Times:100:Times:19 This is not to say that spillover effects are nonexistent in the U.S., but rather that they are generally much 
17:599:42547:16:11:73:501:108:100:Times:100:Times:smaller (Brown 1999), limited to those at or near the minimum wage with little effect as one moves up the 
17:600:42653:11:7:73:465:97:100:Times:100:Times:wage distribution (Neumark et al. 2004)  and are normatively unrelated to minimum wage levels. 
17:601:42748:7:16:73:501:90:42:Times:100:Times:20 The results of this analysis and those that follow in this section are unchanged if, instead, either the Gini 
17:602:42861:16:0:73:443:74:100:Times:100:Times:coefficient or the standard deviation of the log of wages is used as a measure of dispersion.  
18:603:42958:0:20:73:470:758:144:Times:144:Times:highest multiple of the minimum wage for which our earlier analysis established a 
18:604:43040:20:21:73:523:738:144:Times:144:Times:significant clustering of wage observations and a match between that wage observation and a 
18:605:43132:21:21:73:504:717:144:Times:144:Times:minimum wage multiple.  For both zones in both years, we apportion in this way first the 
18:606:43221:21:20:73:508:696:144:Times:144:Times:employed labor force as a whole and then the formal sector labor force, and then compare 
18:607:43310:20:21:73:487:676:144:Times:144:Times:changes in wage dispersion and average wages across affected and unaffected worker 
18:608:43393:21:21:73:320:655:144:Times:144:Times:groups.21  The results are shown in Tables 7 and 8. 
18:609:43445:21:20:109:488:634:144:Times:144:Times:Table 7 reveals that wage dispersion grew much more significantly among the 
18:610:43521:20:21:73:518:614:144:Times:144:Times:unaffected portion of the wage distribution than among workers affected by minimum wage 
18:611:43609:21:21:73:513:593:144:Times:144:Times:norms over this period.  Indeed, the results are rather striking: in both zones the percentage 
18:612:43704:21:21:73:523:572:144:Times:144:Times:change in dispersion in the unaffected group is at least three times that of the affected group.  
18:613:43802:21:20:73:492:551:144:Times:144:Times:This is precisely what we would expect to find if the wage distribution among affected 
18:614:43889:20:21:73:326:531:144:Times:144:Times:workers is normatively shaped by minimum wages.  
18:615:43938:21:21:109:520:510:144:Times:144:Times:A second prediction is that the average real wage of affected workers should decline, 
18:616:44024:21:20:73:496:489:144:Times:144:Times:perhaps absolutely as did minimum wages, but certainly relative to the average wage of 
18:617:44111:20:21:73:514:469:144:Times:144:Times:workers in the unaffected group.  The results in Table 8 reveal this to be the case.  Affected 
18:618:44206:21:21:73:499:448:144:Times:144:Times:workers’ wages declined in every case, both in real terms and in relation to the wages of 
18:619:44296:21:20:73:512:427:144:Times:144:Times:unaffected workers.  Once again, the results are striking: among formal sector workers, the 
18:620:44388:20:21:73:515:407:144:Times:144:Times:average real wage of affected workers declined 10-20% across zones, whereas the wages of 
18:621:44477:21:21:73:256:386:144:Times:144:Times:unaffected workers rose by 20-50%.   
18:622:44514:21:20:109:486:365:144:Times:144:Times:While not definitive, the results of this analysis offer suggestive evidence that 
18:623:44596:20:21:73:505:345:144:Times:144:Times:minimum wage norms do indeed account for some of the rise in wage inequality over the 
18:624:44682:21:21:73:488:324:144:Times:144:Times:period of the 1980s and early 1990s.  Part of the increased inequality is attributable to 
18:625:44772:21:21:73:506:303:144:Times:144:Times:increased dispersion among workers unaffected by minimum wage norms and part, to the 
18:626:44857:21:20:73:459:282:144:Times:144:Times:growing separation between the real wages of affected and unaffected workers.

18:628:44936:21:21:73:151:241:144:Times:144:Times:6. Conclusion 
18:629:44949:21:20:109:521:220:144:Times:144:Times:This paper presents a different view of the relationship between minimum wages and 
18:630:45032:20:21:73:508:200:144:Times:144:Times:the wage structure in Mexico than is common in the literature.  Instead of merely setting a 
18:631:45124:21:21:73:504:179:144:Times:144:Times:lower bound on the wages of formal sector workers, minimum wages serve as a norm for 
18:632:45209:21:20:73:508:158:144:Times:144:Times:wage setting both above and below the level of the minimum.  In particular, our empirical 
18:633:45299:20:21:73:490:138:144:Times:144:Times:evidence suggests that wages are often set at multiples of the minimum wage, and that 
18:634:45385:21:20:73:482:117:144:Times:144:Times:minimum wage changes affect occupational wages unevenly across the occupational 
18:635:45465:20:7:73:220:97:100:Times:100:Times:                                                           
18:636:45523:7:16:73:524:90:42:Times:100:Times:21 Unaffected workers make up a very small segment of the informal sector workforce.  In the formal sector, the 
18:637:45635:16:0:73:476:74:100:Times:100:Times:unaffected segment represents roughly 25% of the upper tail of the wage distribution in both zones.  
19:638:45738:0:20:73:518:758:144:Times:144:Times:distribution.  Indeed, the findings suggest that these two normative roles of minimum wages 
19:639:45830:20:21:73:507:738:144:Times:144:Times:have their greatest impact on the mid-to-lower tail of the wage distribution.  These results 
19:640:45923:21:21:73:516:717:144:Times:144:Times:lend support to the view that declining real minimum wages and stabilization programs that 
19:641:46014:21:20:73:492:696:144:Times:144:Times:strengthened the link between wage levels, wage changes, and minimum wages, might 
19:642:46096:20:21:73:508:676:144:Times:144:Times:account for a portion of the growing wage inequality in Mexico over the period of the late 
19:643:46187:21:21:73:187:655:144:Times:144:Times:1980s and early 1990s.
