2:17:563:14:15:70:526:704:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Abstract: This  study  explores  the  association  between  stock  prices,  metal  prices  and 
2:18:658:15:16:70:524:689:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economic activity, i.e. industrial production, for the Turkish economy for the period 1896M1-
2:19:749:16:16:70:526:673:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2016M12.  The  linear  and  non-linear  analysis  is  conducted  by  applying  the  autoregressive 
2:20:848:16:16:70:526:657:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:distributed  lag  (ARDL)  and  non-linear  autoregressive  distributed  lag  (NARDL)  approaches. 
2:21:946:16:16:70:527:641:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The combined  cointegration  approach  is  applied  to  test  the  robustness  of the ARDL  and 
2:22:1040:16:16:70:527:625:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:NARDL  approaches.  The  FMOLS,  DOLS  and  CCR  regressions  are  applied  to  examine the 
2:23:1132:16:16:70:527:609:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:long-run  effect  of  stock  prices  and  metal  prices  on  economic  activity.  The  empirical  results 
2:24:1238:16:15:70:527:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reveal  that  metal  and  stock  prices  have  a  positive  impact  on  economic  activity.  Metal prices 
2:25:1343:15:16:70:526:578:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:have   a   negative   impact   and   economic   activity   has   positive   effects   on   stock   prices. 
2:26:1450:16:16:70:527:562:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Furthermore,  the  NARDL model  corroborates  the  findings  obtained  from  the  ARDL  model. 
2:27:1544:16:16:70:527:546:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:This paper presents policy guidelines to utilise metals as an economic tool to boost economic 
2:28:1637:16:26:70:193:530:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:activity and stock prices.

2:30:1734:26:14:70:149:478:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:I. Introduction 
2:31:1749:14:13:70:527:464:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Like all other prices, commodity prices also are showing changes in value. Furthermore, it is 
2:32:1841:13:14:70:527:451:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:normal  to  believe that  those  price1 changes  are  affecting  the  macroeconomic  factors that 
2:33:1936:14:14:70:527:437:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:represent  economic activity,  i.e.  industrial  production  in  a  country. To  investigate  the 
2:34:2034:14:14:70:527:423:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:connection between  stock prices and  economic  activity,  Tursoy  and  Faisal  (2016)  analysed 
2:35:2128:14:14:70:526:409:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  association  between  stock  prices and  economic  activity, and  found  that  there  is  a  robust 
2:36:2231:14:13:70:527:395:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:long-run  relationship  between  stock  prices and economic  growth.  Also, there  are  significant 
2:37:2330:13:14:70:527:382:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:studies that have investigated the prices’ disequilibrium adjustment to the macroeconomic and 
2:38:2422:14:14:70:527:368:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:local  disturbances,  such  as  the  study  by  Holly  et  al.  (2011).  Not  only is  the connection  with 
2:39:2530:14:14:70:527:354:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:macroeconomic  factors essential  in  the economic  environment,  but the  interaction  between 
2:40:2625:14:14:70:527:340:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:financial  markets  and economic  issues are  also  discussed.  For  instance, the  paper  by Holly 
2:41:2723:14:13:70:526:326:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and Jones (1997) studied the effects of factors on prices in the concepts of cointegration and 
2:42:2818:13:14:70:527:313:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:asymmetries. The study  adopted linear and nonlinear/asymmetries together to investigate the 
2:43:2910:14:14:70:527:299:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:relationship between the economic theory in order to observe the effects of cointegration and 
2:44:3004:14:14:70:527:285:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economic modelling. Likewise, the current study will examine the relationship between metal 
2:45:3092:14:14:70:527:271:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:prices which  its decided  as  a critical  component  for  the  production  and connection  with 
2:46:3186:14:13:70:527:257:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economic activity. Lastly, the financial market interaction is added in this connection in order 
2:47:3279:13:14:70:527:244:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to  also  observe  the role of  finance  in  cointegration  and  asymmetries.  Financial markets such 
2:48:3379:14:14:70:527:230:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:as stock  market are  crucial  in  this  context for  the  reason  that  most  of  the  companies  in the 
2:49:3483:14:14:70:527:216:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economic  environment  are corporations and  publicly  listed  companies.  Therefore,  all  those 
2:50:3581:14:14:70:527:202:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:activities  which  improve  the  production  in  the  manner  of  economic  growth will also have 
2:51:3677:14:13:70:526:188:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:effects on stock prices. Combining economic environment events with financial markets also 
2:52:3767:13:14:70:527:175:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:creates   the motivation   to   drive   the   importance   of   financial   markets   into   economic 
2:53:3868:14:14:70:527:161:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:development. The most crucial concept in every country is to have prosperity with industrial 
2:54:3959:14:14:70:527:147:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:production. Although only improving the stock market may increase the wealth in the nation, 
2:55:4045:14:25:70:527:133:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:connecting the  available  funds  in the financial  market  to  the  most  profitable  projects  in  the 
2:56:4147:25:8:70:216:108:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:F:                                                           
2:57:4205:8:16:70:527:100:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:1The  paper  by Dees,  Holly,  Pesaran  and  Smith  (2007)  focused  on  testing  the  long-run  macreeconomic 
2:58:4315:16:11:70:339:84:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:relationship between prices within a model of the global economy. 
2:59:4380:11:0:70:72:73:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F: 
3:60:4381:0:14:70:527:760:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economy could  lead  to  economic growth. In  this  connected, metals  are  also  included  to 
3:61:4474:14:14:70:527:746:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:analyse the  effects  of metal price  movements  on  that  activity.  Meanwhile, one  of  the  most 
3:62:4572:14:14:70:527:732:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:discussed concepts in economic development these days is the industrial revolution; therefore, 
3:63:4661:14:13:70:527:718:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:including and examining metal prices, which is a critical component for industrial production, 
3:64:4752:13:14:70:527:705:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  also  its  price  movements  are essential  indicators for  the  market  participants and will 
3:65:4850:14:14:70:527:691:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:therefore be  an  important contribution  to the existing literature. For  instance, Pindyck  and 
3:66:4945:14:14:70:527:677:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Rotemberg (1990) confirmed the existence of a puzzling phenomenon, which is that the prices 
3:67:5035:14:14:70:526:663:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of raw commodities have a persistent tendency to move together. They concluded that prices 
3:68:5125:14:13:70:526:649:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:are  showing  co-movements, and  it  is  therefore  crucial  to account  for  the  effects  of  any 
3:69:5224:13:14:70:526:636:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:common  macroeconomic  shocks.  Pindyck  and  Rotemberg  (1990)  stated  that  all  the  current 
3:70:5321:14:14:70:527:622:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  expected  future  values  of  economic  variables  (i.e., industrial  production)  affect  current 
3:71:5424:14:14:70:527:608:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and expected future demands of all commodities and their prices. This is the main rational for 
3:72:5519:14:14:70:527:594:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:researchers to connect industrial output and metal prices together to investigate the effects of 
3:73:5613:14:13:70:261:580:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:co-movements along with stock prices. 
3:74:5649:13:14:70:73:567:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
3:75:5649:14:14:70:527:553:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Moreover, Hammoudeh et al. (2008) explained that some commodities are related in the sense 
3:76:5740:14:14:70:526:539:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that  they  are  complements  or  substitutes  in  consumption,  and  inputs  in  the  production  of 
3:77:5842:14:14:70:527:525:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:others. As previously explained, examples of these commodities are oil and metals. Oil, gold 
3:78:5935:14:13:70:527:511:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  stock  prices  which are some complement  and  substitutes  in  consumption  and  input  in 
3:79:6032:13:14:70:527:498:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:production, coordinately  investigate by Tursoy  and Faisal (2017). Although with those study 
3:80:6125:14:14:70:527:484:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:showed  above,  some  of  the  commodities  such  as  oil,  gold  and stock  prices significantly 
3:81:6222:14:14:70:527:470:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:investigated, while this  paper  innovatively  examines the  input  metals (iron  ore,  aluminium 
3:82:6318:14:14:70:527:456:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  copper),  economic  activity  and  stock  prices for  Turkish economy. Over  the last  decade, 
3:83:6415:14:13:70:526:442:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Turkey has  been  one  of  the emerging  economies  that  has  demonstrated  steady  growth.  To 
3:84:6511:13:14:70:526:429:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:achieve economic growth, economies generally require resources. One of the most important 
3:85:6601:14:14:70:526:415:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:resources  is  the  metals  utilised  in the industrial  sector. The  foreign  trade  statistical  data  for 
3:86:6710:14:14:70:527:401:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2016 produced by the Turkish Statistical Institute indicates that manufacturing sector exports 
3:87:6805:14:14:70:527:387:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:accounted  for  94%  of  total  exports  in  Turkey  and,  more  importantly,  the  second2 largest 
3:88:6904:14:13:70:527:373:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:export products in manufacturing were metals (13%). Therefore, based on the fact that metals 
3:89:6997:13:14:70:526:360:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:B:account for a significant amount of exports in Turkey’s overall trade, this study uses various 
3:90:7091:14:14:70:526:346:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:important  global  metal  prices  (iron  ore,  aluminium  and  copper)  to  create  a  composite  index 
3:91:7195:14:14:70:527:332:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:for metal prices to investigate the impact of  global metal prices as an exogenous variable on 
3:92:7289:14:14:70:332:318:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the stock market and industrial production in Turkey.

3:94:7343:13:14:70:527:291:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:This study contributes to the existing literature in three important dimensions: (i), This paper 
3:95:7440:14:14:70:527:277:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:examines the association between  metal  prices,  stock prices and economic  activity, i.e. 
3:96:7530:14:14:70:527:263:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:industrial production in  Turkey; (ii), In doing so, linear  and non-linear  analysis is conducted 
3:97:7628:14:14:70:526:249:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:by applying the ARDL and NARDL approaches; (iii) The robustness of ARDL cointegration 
3:98:7713:14:13:70:527:235:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:is tested by applying the combined cointegration approach developed by Bayer-Hanck (2013) 
3:99:7801:13:14:70:527:222:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(iv)  FMOLS,  DOLS  and  CCR  regressions are  employed to  examine  the  long-run  impact  of 
3:100:7896:14:14:70:527:208:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:metal prices on economic activity and stock prices. The empirical findings show the presence 
3:101:7988:14:14:70:527:194:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of  cointegration  between  metals  prices,  stock  prices  and  economic  activity, i.e.  industrial 
3:102:8089:14:14:70:527:180:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:production.   Furthermore,   metal   prices   and   stock   prices   stimulate   economic   activity. 
3:103:8190:14:13:70:527:166:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Conversely, metal prices are negatively linked with stock prices, but economic activity has a 
3:104:8282:13:14:70:527:153:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:positive relationship. The empirical results reveal that metal and stock prices have a positive 
3:105:8377:14:14:70:527:139:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:impact on economic activity. Metal prices have a negative impact and economic activity has a 
3:106:8469:14:14:70:220:125:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:positive effect on stock prices.

4:117:8998:14:14:70:527:677:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:There are important studies in the literature that have connected the prices of precious metals 
4:118:9092:14:14:70:527:663:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and stock markets, such as the study by Apergis et al. (2014). This paper found that developed 
4:119:9186:14:13:70:527:649:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:countries have usually used gold and silver as the basis to investigate the interaction between 
4:120:9282:13:14:70:526:636:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:metal  prices  and  stock  prices.  Contrary  to  the  existing  literature,  there  are  few  studies  that 
4:121:9391:14:14:70:526:622:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:have used different metals in the investigation of the relationship between metal prices, stock 
4:122:9487:14:14:70:527:608:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:prices, and the economy. For instance, Zevallos and Carpio (2015) and Kim and Ando (2012) 
4:123:9577:14:14:70:526:594:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:used different metal prices (aluminium, iron ore,  copper, tin, nickel, zinc,  lead and uranium) 
4:124:9674:14:13:70:527:580:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to  investigate  the  interaction  between the stock  market  and  the  economy.  Moreover,  another 
4:125:9775:13:14:70:527:567:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:study by Panas (2001) investigated price behaviour in the London Metal Exchange market for 
4:126:9865:14:14:70:527:553:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:metals, including  aluminium,  copper,  lead,  tin,  nickel  and  zinc.  Panas  (2001)  stated  that 
4:127:9964:14:14:70:527:539:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:financial  time  series  exhibits irregular  behaviour  and  the  economic  theory  suggests  that this 
4:128:10067:14:14:70:526:525:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:irregular  behaviour  could  be  due  to  the  existence  of  nonlinear  dependence  in  the  market.  In 
4:129:10173:14:13:70:526:511:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:C:summary, this study’s results showed that metal prices’ series contain nonlinear dynamics. 
4:130:10264:13:14:70:527:498:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Johnson and Soenen (2009) provided an explanation detailing that the significant importance 
4:131:10355:14:14:70:526:484:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of commodities compared to manufactured goods trade cannot be ignored in South American 
4:132:10443:14:14:70:526:470:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:countries  and  they  stated  that  stock  markets  reflect  the  current  and  anticipated  state  of  the 
4:133:10551:14:14:70:527:456:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economy.  Johnson  and  Soenen  (2009)  tested  the  effect  of  world  commodity  prices  on  stock 
4:134:10652:14:13:70:526:442:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:market  returns. Baffes  and  Savescu  (2014)  tested  the  relationship  between  nominal  price  of 
4:135:10754:13:14:70:526:429:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:metals  (aluminium,  copper,  lead,  nickel,  tin  and  zinc),  interest  rates,  industrial  production, 
4:136:10860:14:14:70:527:415:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:B:stock  level  of  metal,  price  index of manufacturing goods and exchange rates. This study’s 
4:137:10955:14:14:70:526:401:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:results  provided  evidence  for  strong  cointegration,  which  demonstrated  the  presence  of  a 
4:138:11055:14:14:70:527:387:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:long-run relationship between fundamentals and metal prices. Furthermore, a study by Tursoy 
4:139:11147:14:13:70:527:373:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and Faisal (2016) analysed the relationship between the stock market and economic growth in 
4:140:11238:13:14:70:526:360:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Turkey  by  using  quarterly  data  on  stock  prices and  GDP  with  the  ARDL  framework  and 
4:141:11333:14:14:70:526:346:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:ECM. The results from this study revealed that there is a strong positive relationship between 
4:142:11428:14:14:70:526:332:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:stock   prices   and   economic   growth. Also,   Tursoy   and   Faisal   (2017)   investigated   the 
4:143:11530:14:14:70:527:318:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:relationship  between  oil  prices and  gold  prices with  stock  markets.  Their empirical findings 
4:144:11628:14:13:70:527:304:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:confirmed the relationship between the variables; gold prices affect stock markets negatively 
4:145:11719:13:14:70:194:291:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and oil prices positively.  
4:146:11745:14:14:70:73:277:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
4:147:11745:14:14:70:527:263:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Moreover,  Sadorsky  (2014)  discussed the  prominent  concept  of  financial  integration  across 
4:148:11843:14:14:70:527:249:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:nations and also the financialization of commodity markets that provides investors a new way 
4:149:11934:14:13:70:527:235:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of diversifying  their  portfolios. Based  on  the  above  explanation,  this  paper  investigates  the 
4:150:12038:13:14:70:526:222:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economic  models    (volatilities  and  conditional  correlations)  for  the  prices  of  stocks,  metals 
4:151:12144:14:14:70:527:208:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:such  as  copper,  oil  and  wheat.  This  study  explains  that  there are  more  studies  that  have 
4:152:12247:14:14:70:527:194:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:examined the dynamics between equities and commodities like gold, oil and stocks than have 
4:153:12337:14:14:70:526:180:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:investigated   the relationship   between   emerging   market   stock   prices   and   commodities. 
4:154:12436:14:13:70:527:166:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Moreover,  few  have  conducted significant  analyses  to  examine  the  relationship  between 
4:155:12530:13:14:70:527:153:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:stocks  and  commodities  in  the  concept  of  portfolio  diversification.  For instance, Erb  and 
4:156:12630:14:14:70:526:139:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Harvey  (2006)  showed  evidence  that  a  portfolio  with  stocks  and  commodities  could  have 
4:157:12728:14:14:70:527:125:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:higher returns and lower risks in the concept of choosing the commodities for investing some 
4:158:12820:14:14:70:527:111:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:part  of  your  wealth  in  your  portfolio  to  have better  diversification and  hedging against the 
4:159:12920:14:13:70:527:97:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:risk. Allocating  a  certain  portion  of  the investment  with  commodities  is seen  as  a  way  of 
4:160:13019:13:0:70:527:84:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:diversifying  a portfolio in  order  to  reduce  risks Idzorect  (2006) found  that investing 
5:161:13111:0:14:70:527:760:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:commodities  in  portfolio  opportunity  sets  resulted  in an  increasingly  efficient  frontier.  All 
5:162:13214:14:14:70:526:746:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:those  studies  showed  that  commodities  have  important  effects  on  portfolio  diversification; 
5:163:13315:14:14:70:527:732:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:therefore, including  and  pursuing  the  commodities  prices  like  metals  have  a  significant 
5:164:13412:14:13:70:527:718:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:contribution to diversification.  Although studies  in  the  literature  have investigated  precious 
5:165:13511:13:14:70:527:705:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:metals  and their connections  with  the  necessary  components,  few  studies have included 
5:166:13602:14:14:70:527:691:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:minerals  like  iron  ore,  aluminium  and  copper, which  are  important  metals  for  both  industry 
5:167:13704:14:14:70:527:677:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and investment. Not only oil, but gold and silver are critical components that are followed by 
5:168:13794:14:14:70:526:663:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:investors  for  their  investment  decision  revisions;  also,  there  are  essential  metals  that  market 
5:169:13902:14:13:70:527:649:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:consciously  monitors. Therefore,  this  article  will  also  add  the prices  composite  index to 
5:170:14000:13:14:70:527:636:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:investigate  the  connection  between the economy  and the market. The contribution  from 
5:171:14089:14:14:70:526:622:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Idzorek (2007) showed that proponents of investing in commodities claim that including these 
5:172:14182:14:14:70:527:608:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:should   have   better   diversification   properties   than   a   similar   portfolio   which   excludes 
5:173:14288:14:14:70:138:594:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:commodities. 
5:174:14300:14:13:70:73:580:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
5:175:14300:13:14:70:527:567:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Elder et  al. (2012)  used the intra-day  data  for  the  period  2002  through  2008  to  examine  the 
5:176:14402:14:14:70:526:553:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:intensity,  direction,  and  speed  of  impact  of  US  macroeconomic  news  announcements  on  the 
5:177:14502:14:14:70:527:539:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:return,  volatility  and  trading  volume  of  crucial  commodities  futures.  They  found that  metal 
5:178:14605:14:14:70:527:525:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:futures responded to economic news. Therefore, this study confirmed that metals instruments 
5:179:14695:14:13:70:526:511:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:are  responding  to  the  macroeconomic  events  in  the  US.  More  importantly,  the  relationship 
5:180:14796:13:14:70:527:498:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:between   information   and the perception of   the   investors’  revising portfolio has   been 
5:181:14890:14:14:70:527:484:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:investigated  by  Fama  (1970)  to  explain  the  return  structure  of  the assets.  Starting  with 
5:182:14991:14:14:70:526:470:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Markowitz  (1952),  modern  portfolio  theory  and  others3 provide  the  necessary  models  to 
5:183:15086:14:14:70:527:456:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:explain  the  portfolio  selection,  and  the  efficient  diversification  even  also  explain the  factors 
5:184:15193:14:13:70:527:442:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:are  determining  the  expected  return  of  an  asset  or  portfolio. To  explain  the  expected  return, 
5:185:15299:13:14:70:527:429:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Sharpe  (1964)  with a single-factor  model  and  Roll and Ross  (1980)  and  Chen et  al. (1986) 
5:186:15395:14:14:70:527:415:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:with  multi-factor  models, proposed  and verified  the relationship  between  macroeconomic 
5:187:15487:14:14:70:527:401:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:factors  and  asset  prices. In  particular,  Chen et  al. (1986)  provided macroeconomic  factors 
5:188:15584:14:14:70:349:387:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:such as industrial production to explain the asset returns.

5:190:15644:13:14:70:527:360:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:B:Past  studies  have  investigated Turkey’s stock market in the framework of Arbitrage Pricing 
5:191:15737:14:14:70:527:346:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Theory, such as Tursoy et al. (2008), who connected certain commodities - oil and gold - with 
5:192:15825:14:14:70:527:332:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the portfolio returns.  Also, Rjoub et  al.’s (2009)  paper investigated the confirmation of  APT 
5:193:15920:14:14:70:527:318:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in the framework of Chen et al. (1986) for the Turkish market. Moreover, Soytac et al. (2009) 
5:194:16012:14:13:70:527:304:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:investigated  the  precious  metals  and  oil  on  the  connection  between the macroeconomy  and 
5:195:16108:13:14:70:163:291:12:Times New Roman:11:g_d0_f6:B:markets in Turkey.

5:199:16183:14:13:70:524:235:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:In order to determine the correct order of integration of the variables, the Augmented Dickey-
5:200:16277:13:14:70:527:222:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Fuller  test  created  by  Dickey  and  Fuller  (1979,  1981)  is  applied.  Furthermore,  in  order  to 
5:201:16382:14:14:70:527:208:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:examine the robustness of the unit root analysis, the KPSS and ERS unit root tests developed 
5:202:16473:14:14:70:527:194:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:by Kwiatkowski  et  al. (1992)  and  Elliott,  Rothenberg,  and  Stock  (1996) are  applied. These 
5:203:16569:14:14:70:424:180:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:unit root tests determine the correct order of integration for the variables.

5:206:16692:13:14:70:526:139:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:This study utilises the ARDL bounds testing approach developed by Pesaran et  al. (2001) to 
5:207:16784:14:14:70:527:125:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:investigate  the  relationship  between  metals prices,  equity prices and  industrial  production. 
5:208:16883:14:26:70:527:111:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The  ARDL  bounds  testing  approach  is  more  flexible  compared  to  traditional  cointegration

6:211:17138:0:14:70:526:760:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:methods.  This  approach  can  be  applied  to  any  series  that  has  a  mixed  order  of  integration. 
6:212:17244:14:14:70:527:746:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:However, it must be ensured that none of the variables is I(2) and the dependent variable must 
6:213:17338:14:14:70:527:732:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:be I(1). This  cointegration  approach provides  a short-run  and  long-run  relationship  between 
6:214:17436:14:13:70:527:718:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  variables  without  affecting the long-run  association  between  the  variables. The  ARDL

6:244:17970:13:14:70:527:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:operator. The existence of cointegration between the variables will be determined by using the 
6:245:18064:14:14:70:524:508:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:bounds test of cointegration. The bounds test of cointegration, which depends on the Joint F-
6:246:18154:14:15:70:527:494:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:statistic  test, is  applied  to  investigate  the  null  hypothesis  of  no  cointegration,  H0 휕푡=0, 
6:247:18254:15:13:70:527:479:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:against  the  alternative  hypothesis  H1: 휕푡≠0   where t = 1,  2,  3...  If  there is more  than  one 
6:248:18351:13:14:70:526:466:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:short-run coefficient of the same variable, then in this case, the Wald test is applied to check 
6:249:18448:14:14:70:527:452:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  joint  significance  of  the  short-run  coefficients.  For  this  reason, the F-statistic  obtained 
6:250:18554:14:14:70:524:438:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:from  the  estimation  is  compared  with  the  lower  and  upper  bounds  critical  values.  If  the  F-
6:251:18659:14:13:70:527:424:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:statistic value lies  above  the  upper  bounds  critical  values,  then  the  null  hypothesis  of  no 
6:252:18761:13:14:70:527:411:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:cointegration  is  rejected.  This  further  implies  the  evidence  of  cointegration between  the 
6:253:18860:14:14:70:527:397:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:variables. However, if the F-statistic value lies in between the upper and lower bounds critical 
6:254:18953:14:14:70:526:383:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:values, then the result regarding the cointegration is indecisive. However, if the F-statistic lies 
6:255:19052:14:14:70:527:369:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:below  the  lower  critical  bounds  values,  then  it  implies that  the null  hypothesis  of  no 
6:256:19150:14:13:70:526:355:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:cointegration is  accepted.  This  further  implies  the  evidence  of  no  cointegration  among  the 
6:257:19251:13:14:70:527:342:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:selected  variables  in  the  model.  Once  the  cointegration  is  confirmed between the  variables,

7:292:20276:14:14:70:527:746:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:To analyse the robustness of the ARDL bounds test of cointegration, this study further applies 
7:293:20370:14:14:70:526:732:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  recently  developed  Bayer  and  Hanck  (2013)  combined  cointegration  method.  Engle  and 
7:294:20468:14:13:70:527:718:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Granger (1987) identified a residual based cointegration method that detects the presence of a 
7:295:20561:13:14:70:527:705:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:long-run relationship between the variables. This method can only be applied to the series that 
7:296:20655:14:14:70:526:691:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:have  a  similar  order  of  integration.  However,  this  method  has  a  problem  of  low  explanatory 
7:297:20760:14:14:70:527:677:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:power,  which  can  lead  to  biased  results  being  produced. Subsequently,  Johansen  (1988) 
7:298:20856:14:14:70:527:663:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:presented  the maximum  Eigen-value  test that is  capable  of identifying more  than  one 
7:299:20945:14:13:70:527:649:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:cointegrating  relationship  among  the  series.  Phillips  and  Ouliaris  (1990), after  Johansen 
7:300:21043:13:14:70:527:636:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(1988), outlined  a  new  approach  for  examining  the  cointegration  among  the  estimated 
7:301:21136:14:14:70:473:622:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:variables, which was earlier known as the Phillips and Ouliaris cointegration test.

7:303:21221:14:14:70:527:594:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Boswijk  (1994)  introduced  the  ECM  model  based  on the F-Statistic,  and  Banerjee  et  al. 
7:304:21318:14:13:70:527:580:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(1998) developed  the  ECM  model  based on  t-test.  In  order  to  overcome  some  of  the 
7:305:21409:13:14:70:527:567:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:weaknesses as   outlined   in   the   previous   cointegrating   methods, including the ARDL 
7:306:21500:14:14:70:526:553:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:cointegration method, this study applied the Bayer and Hanck (2013) combined cointegration 
7:307:21591:14:14:70:526:539:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:method. Similar  to  earlier  methods  of cointegration,  this  method also  requires  the  series  to 
7:308:21692:14:14:70:526:525:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:have  a unique order of cointegration. However, the advantage of this method is that the null 
7:309:21786:14:13:70:527:511:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:hypothesis  of  no  cointegration  in  Bayer-Hanck  combined  cointegration  is  based  on the 
7:310:21879:13:14:70:527:498:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Banerjee et al. tests (BDM, 1998), Boswijk (BO, 1994), Johansen (JOH, 1988), and Engle and 
7:311:21970:14:14:70:526:484:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Granger  (EG,  1987),  which  produces  more  consistent  and  reliable  results.  The  Bayer  and 
7:312:22069:14:14:70:526:470:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Hanck  (2013)  combined  cointegration  is  based  on  Fisher's  formulas.  This  test  also  gives  the

7:322:22711:14:14:70:527:339:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that the null hypothesis is rejected. The critical values have been obtained from the Bayer and

7:327:22968:14:14:70:527:270:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:estimating  a  single cointegrating  vector.  However,  many  techniques  can  be  utilised  in  this 
7:328:23070:14:14:70:527:256:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regard for estimating  the  long-run  relationship.  Therefore,  in  this study,  the  long-run  impact 
7:329:23173:14:14:70:527:242:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:can  be analysed using  Fully  Modified  OLS  (FMOLS), as  proposed  by  Phillips  and  Hansen 
7:330:23266:14:13:70:527:228:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(1990). This technique has the advantage of achieving asymptotic efficiency by consideration 
7:331:23358:13:14:70:526:215:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the   serial   correlation   that   arises   and   eliminating   the   endogeneity   problem   among   the 
7:332:23465:14:14:70:527:201:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:explanatory  variables.  Additionally,  the  robustness  of  the  FMOLS  will  be  analysed  using 
7:333:23564:14:14:70:527:187:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Dynamic  OLS  (DOLS)  techniques, as  suggested  by  Stock  and  Watson  (1993), as  well  as 
7:334:23655:14:14:70:526:173:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Canonical  Cointegrating  Regression  (CCR).  The  DOLS  technique  also  has  the  advantage  of 
7:335:23753:14:13:70:527:159:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:avoiding  the  possible  consequence  of  the  endogeneity  of  the  regressors  that may  arise.  The 
7:336:23856:13:14:70:526:146:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:single  cointegrating  equations  can  be  applied  to  the  unique  order  of  series  provided  that  the 
7:337:23964:14:14:70:527:132:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:long-run  relationship  is  confirmed  among  the  estimated  variables.  Therefore,  this  study  will 
7:338:24068:14:14:70:407:118:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:utilise FMOLS, DOLS, and CCR to estimate the long-run elasticities.

8:341:24193:0:14:70:527:760:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Many studies in the literature have applied the linear models such as ARDL to investigate the 
8:342:24287:14:14:70:527:746:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:linear  relationship  among  the  variables.  However,  Faisal et  al. (2018)  argued  in  their  study 
8:343:24388:14:14:70:527:732:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that  the  linear  ARDL does  not take  into  account the non-linear  relationship  between  the 
8:344:24484:14:13:70:527:718:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:variables. Since,  the  non-linear  relationship  takes  into  the  account  of  positive  and  negative

8:346:24684:14:14:70:527:691:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:negative events (bad news) in comparison to positive shocks (positive news). Therefore, this 
8:347:24773:14:14:70:526:677:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:study  also  applies  the  NARDL  approach  to  cointegration  in  addition  to  the  ARDL  to

8:350:25055:13:14:70:527:636:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:ability  to  identify  the  asymmetric  cointegration  and  non-linear  relationship  between  the 
8:351:25154:14:14:70:527:622:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:variables.  The  NARDL  model  allows  simultaneous  distinction  between  the  short-term  and 
8:352:25250:14:14:70:527:608:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:long-term  effects  of  the  independent  variables  on  the  dependent  variables.  The  NARDL

8:381:25829:14:14:70:526:431:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:estimating the long-run coefficients is to analyse the response time and the speed with which

8:408:26851:14:14:70:527:204:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:To investigate the evidence of the long-run asymmetric cointegrating relationship, the bounds 
8:409:26944:14:14:70:527:190:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:test  was  proposed  by  Shin  et  al.  (2014)  to  analyse  the  joint  significance  of  the  short-run 
8:410:27050:14:14:70:526:176:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:lagged  coefficient  of  regressors.  In  this  regard,  two  tests  were  introduced  that  are  used  to 
8:411:27157:14:14:70:527:162:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:investigate  this  long-run  relationship:  F-Statistic  by  Pesaran  et  al.  (2001)  and  t-statistics  by 
8:412:27266:14:14:70:527:148:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Banerjee et al. (1998). The F-statistics tests the null hypothesis (∅+=∅−=∅=0), while the 
8:413:27356:14:13:70:527:134:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:t-statistics  tests  the  null  hypothesis  of ∅=0 against  the  alternative  hypothesis  of   ∅<0. 
8:414:27455:13:14:70:527:121:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:These  two  tests  are  utilised  to  determine  possible  evidence  of  cointegration.  If  both  the  tests 
8:415:27565:14:14:70:527:107:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reject  the  null  hypothesis  of  no  cointegration,  this  implies that  a long-run  association  exists

9:420:27892:14:14:70:527:732:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:coefficients  that  are  obtained  from  the  previous  formulas  are  the  long-run  asymmetric 
9:421:27989:14:14:70:527:718:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:coefficients. The long-run coefficients of the independent variables are generated with respect 
9:422:28085:14:14:70:527:704:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to  positive  and  negative  changes,  which  analyse  the  long-run  association between  the 
9:423:28179:14:13:70:526:690:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:variables.  In  order  to  measure  the  asymmetric  dynamic  multiplier  effect,  the  following

9:467:30039:14:14:70:527:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:standard  variance.  It  can  be seen  that the 1st  principal  component  is  better  than  the  other 
9:468:30142:14:14:70:527:275:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:indicators  of  metals  because  a  high  level  of  variance  is  described  by the 1st  principal 
9:469:30240:14:14:70:527:261:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:component.  Hence,  we  utilise  the  values  of the 1st  eigenvector  as  a  weight  to  construct  an 
9:470:30344:14:13:70:527:247:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:index of metals, which is represented by Mt. All the variables are transformed into natural-log

10:491:30837:14:14:70:527:674:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Before  proceeding to the cointegration  approach  for  examining the long-run cointegration 
10:492:30928:14:13:70:527:660:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:association between the variables, it is necessary to test the integration order of the variables. 
10:493:31026:13:14:70:527:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:In  doing  so,  we  have  applied the ADF  unit  root  test  and the results  are  shown  in  Table-1. 
10:494:31125:14:14:70:527:633:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Economic activity, metals prices and stock prices are found to be non-stationary at level using 
10:495:31220:14:14:70:526:619:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:intercept and trend. The results indicate that all the variables are stationary at first difference. 
10:496:31321:14:14:70:527:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:This  implies  that  economic  activity,  metals  prices  and stock prices  have a unique  order  of 
10:497:31421:14:13:70:526:591:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:integration. We have applied the KPSS and ERS unit root tests to examine the robustness of 
10:498:31512:13:14:70:527:578:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the unit root analysis. It is found that the KPSS and ERS unit root tests confirm the empirical 
10:499:31605:14:14:70:309:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:findings reported by the ADF test (see Table-2)4.

10:512:32060:14:14:70:527:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:This implies the robustness of the unit root analysis. The order of integration is important for 
10:513:32157:14:14:70:527:343:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the ARDL approach in order to identify that none of the selected variables is I(2). This further 
10:514:32254:14:13:70:526:329:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:implies that all unit root tests suggest that the estimated variables are integrated of order 1 and 
10:515:32354:13:14:70:527:316:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:none  of  the  variables  is I(2). This  shows  the possibility  for proceeding to  the  ARDL  bounds

11:550:33498:16:16:70:527:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The  unique  order  of  integration  of  variables  leads  us to  apply  the ARDL  bounds  testing

11:552:33696:16:16:70:527:552:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:ARDL-F statistic is sensitive to lag length selection. In doing so, we choose lag length of the

11:556:34076:16:16:70:526:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the null hypothesis of no cointegration is rejected as we treated economic activity and equity

11:558:34274:16:16:70:527:457:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:cointegration  vectors,  thus validating that  cointegration  is  present  between  the  variables  for

11:562:34528:15:16:70:527:394:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Hanck  combined  cointegration approach  to  examine the cointegration  between  economic

11:564:34716:16:16:70:527:362:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:cointegration are reported in Table-4. The empirical analysis indicates that Fisher statistics for 
11:565:34813:16:16:70:527:346:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:ENG&GRA and ENG&GRA–JOHAN–BOS–BDM are greater than the critical value at 5% and 
11:566:34891:16:16:70:527:330:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:10%.  This rejects the  null  hypothesis  of  no  cointegration  for  all  three  models.  The  results 
11:567:34994:16:16:70:526:314:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:therefore  show  evidence  of  cointegration  in  both  cases.  This  suggests  that  the  estimated 
11:568:35095:16:15:70:527:298:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:variables are cointegrated. This further implies that economic activity, stock prices and metals 
11:569:35192:15:16:70:527:283:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:prices are cointegrated for the long-run  relationship. This  confirms  the  reliability  and

12:599:35791:14:14:70:527:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:After  the  confirmation  of  cointegration, the short-run  coefficients  are  estimated  under  the 
12:600:35892:14:13:70:527:662:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:ARDL framework. The short-run results are shown in Table-5, in which economic activity is 
12:601:35981:13:14:70:527:649:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:taken as the dependent variable. A positive and significant effect of stock prices on economic 
12:602:36076:14:14:70:527:635:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:activity is noted. Likewise, metals prices also have a positive impact on economic activity in 
12:603:36169:14:14:70:527:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the short  run.  This  implies  that  if stock prices and  metal  prices  rise  by  1%,  then economic 
12:604:36272:14:14:70:527:607:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:activity will increase by 0.0047% and 0.0269%, respectively. Since, the error correction term 
12:605:36364:14:13:70:527:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:is negative and statistically significant, this implies that economic activity converges back to 
12:606:36460:13:14:70:527:580:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:its  original  position  by  6.73%  speed  of  adjustment  using  the  channel  of stock prices and 
12:607:36560:14:14:70:527:566:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:metals prices. This indicates the stability of the system after a short-run shock. Table-5 shows 
12:608:36655:14:14:70:526:552:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that DW  is  1.99,  indicating  that  there  is  no  problem  of  autocorrelation,  with  the  statistically 
12:609:36763:14:14:70:460:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:significant F-statistics value proving the overall good fit of the short-run model.

13:651:37878:16:16:70:531:599:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:ARDL  framework.  For  the  purposes  of  convenience,  Panel-A  represents  the  model  where 
13:652:37973:16:16:70:532:583:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economic activity is taken as the endogenous variable. In Panel-B, stock prices are taken as the 
13:653:38069:16:16:70:532:567:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:endogenous  variable.  There  are  no  problems  of  serial  correlation  in either model, except  for 
13:654:38170:16:16:70:531:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:heteroscedasticity  in  Panel-B,  as  shown  by  the  White  test  for  heteroscedasticity. The  Ramsey 
13:655:38273:16:15:70:531:535:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:RESET  test  suggests  that  both  the  models  are  well-specified  and  implies  the stability  of  the 
13:656:38379:15:16:70:531:520:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:model. Furthermore, the robustness of the stability of the model for Panel-A was conducted by 
13:657:38473:16:16:70:532:504:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:using CUSUM and CUSUMsq, as suggested by Brown et al. (1975). Figure-1 shows the plots 
13:658:38560:16:16:70:532:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of  CUSUM  and  CUSUMsq.  This  indicates  that  both  the  CUSUM  and  CUSUMsq lie  in 
13:659:38646:16:16:70:348:472:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:between the two red bonded lines at 5% significant level. 
13:660:38703:16:16:70:73:456:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
13:661:38703:16:13:70:526:440:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Since  the  cointegration  vectors  were  identified  among  the  variables  in  both  the  models,  the 
13:662:38808:13:14:70:527:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:long-run  elasticity  can  be  derived  from  the  estimated  variables.  In  this  regard,  the  FMOLS 
13:663:38912:14:14:70:527:413:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:will  be  applied  to  investigate  the  long-run  relationship  between  the  estimated  variable,  as 
13:664:39015:14:14:70:526:399:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:discussed  in  the  previous  section.  The  DOLS  and  CCR  will  be  applied  to  analyse  the 
13:665:39112:14:14:70:527:385:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:robustness  of  the  FMOLS.  The  results  of  the  FMOLS,  DOLS  and  CCR  tests are  shown  in 
13:666:39208:14:13:70:524:371:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Tables-7 and 8. The long-run models are differentiated from each other on the basis of Panel-
13:667:39300:13:14:70:527:358:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:A  (Table-7),  Panel-B  (Table-9)  and  diagnostic  analysis.  In  Panel-A,  economic  activity  is 
13:668:39400:14:14:70:527:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:taken as the regressand, while metal prices and stock prices have been taken as the regressors. 
13:669:39496:14:14:70:527:330:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:A 1%  rise  in  metal  prices  will  cause  economic  activity  to  increase  by  0.072%.  There  is  a 
13:670:39599:14:14:70:527:316:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:positive and statistically significant relationship between metals prices and economic activity 
13:671:39694:14:13:70:527:302:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:for  the  case  of  Turkey.  Likewise,  in  the  case  of stock prices,  a  1%  increase  will  cause 
13:672:39796:13:14:70:527:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economic activity to rise by 0.076%. The positive sign of stock prices with economic activity 
13:673:39890:14:14:70:527:275:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:is  in  line  with  the  existing  literature. Furthermore,  this  finding  is  in  concordance  with the 
13:674:39996:14:14:70:526:261:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:study of Tursoy and Faisal (2016) for Turkey. This further suggests that stock prices play an 
13:675:40089:14:14:70:527:247:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:important  role  in  determining  economic  activity  for  the  case  of  Turkey. Moreover,  the 
13:676:40185:14:13:70:527:233:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:coefficients of stock prices and metals prices are very similar. This further implies that equity 
13:677:40280:13:14:70:527:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:prices  and  metals prices  are  important  factors  for  strengthening  the  Turkish  economy.  The 
13:678:40380:14:14:70:527:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:DOLS and CCR Regressions showed similar results to FMOLS. The Adjusted R2 is sufficient 
13:679:40467:14:14:70:524:192:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that stock prices and metals prices jointly explain the change in economic activity by 92.61%.

14:745:41381:14:14:70:527:494:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:However, today, there is increasing popularity for measuring the non-linear relationship, since 
14:746:41477:14:14:70:527:480:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  relationship  between  the  variables  is  not  always  linear.  In  this  regard,  this  study applied 
14:747:41586:14:14:70:526:466:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  non-linear  asymmetric  cointegration  test  (NARDL) developed by  Shin  et  al.  (2014).  The 
14:748:41684:14:13:70:527:452:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:results  of  NARDL  are  shown  in Table-9.  First,  it is noted  that  metal prices and stock prices 
14:749:41784:13:14:70:527:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:explain  93%  (Adjusted  R2 = 93.4%),  which  only  takes the significant  coefficients  into 
14:750:41876:14:14:70:527:425:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:account, while  disregarding  the  insignificant  ones.  This  suggests  that stock prices and  metal 
14:751:41977:14:14:70:526:411:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:prices explain  93.4%  of economic  activity (which  is  taken  as  a  proxy  to  measure  economic 
14:752:42076:14:14:70:527:397:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:growth), while 6.6% of the variations in economic activity is explained by the error term. The 
14:753:42170:14:13:70:527:383:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:NARDL   model   is   free   from   the   heteroscedasticity   problem   and   the   residuals   are 
14:754:42270:13:14:70:526:370:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:homoscedastic.  The  functional  form  of  the  model  is  confirmed  by  the  Ramset  RESET  test. 
14:755:42370:14:14:70:526:356:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:This  diagnostic  test  further  implies  the  stability,  validity  and  reliability  of  the  estimated 
14:756:42476:14:14:70:527:342:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:results.  It  was  noted  that  the  estimated  F-statistic  lies  above  the  upper  bounds  critical  value, 
14:757:42587:14:14:70:526:328:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:which  indicates  the  presence  of  cointegration  among  the  estimated  variables.  This  further 
14:758:42688:14:13:70:527:314:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:confirms   that   metals prices, stock   prices and   industrial   production   are   in   a   long-run 
14:759:42791:13:14:70:527:301:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:relationship  with  each  other.  The  Wald  test  further  identifies  the  asymmetry  in the short run 
14:760:42895:14:14:70:527:287:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and long run as well by analysing their corresponding p-values. This suggests that asymmetry 
14:761:42987:14:14:70:527:273:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  non-linearity  must  be taken  into  the  account  when  analysing  the  relationship  between 
14:762:43086:14:14:70:527:259:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:metals prices, stock prices and economic  activity.  The  t-statistics  (TBDM),  developed  by 
14:763:43180:14:13:70:527:245:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Banerjee  et  al. (1998)  and  FPSS statistics  is  from  Pesaran  et  al. (2001)  bounds  test  values  are 
14:764:43287:13:14:70:527:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:upper critical bounds,  even  at  1%. This  confirms  the  evidence  of  asymmetric  cointegration 
14:765:43385:14:14:70:527:218:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:among  the  estimated  variables,  which  implies  that  metals prices, stock prices and economic 
14:766:43482:14:14:70:527:204:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:activity are in a long-run asymmetric cointegrating relationship in the Turkish economy. The 
14:767:43573:14:14:70:526:190:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:empirical analysis confirms the significance of considering not only the linear relationship but 
14:768:43669:14:14:70:527:176:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:also  the asymmetric relationship  among  these  variables.  It  is  necessary  to  mention  here  that 
14:769:43772:14:13:70:527:162:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:B:the authors’ previous estimation  under  the  ARDL  framework  approach  failed  to  predict  this

15:793:44484:14:14:70:527:468:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Once  the  cointegration  has  been  confirmed,  the  long-run  coefficients  will  be  analysed  to 
15:794:44585:14:14:70:526:454:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:predict its effect. As far as the long-run coefficients are concerned, a positive and a negative 
15:795:44682:14:13:70:527:440:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:shock to stock prices have a positive and significant effect on economic activity. This implies 
15:796:44778:13:14:70:527:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that both positive and negative shocks on stock prices cause economic growth in the long-run, 
15:797:44872:14:14:70:527:413:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:which is expected. These findings in terms of stock prices are in line with the findings from 
15:798:44966:14:14:70:527:399:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  ARDL  model.  This  suggests  that the stock market  has  a  positive  impact  on  economic 
15:799:45062:14:14:70:527:385:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:growth in the long-run, which is a positive sign for a healthy economy. This also implies that 
15:800:45157:14:13:70:527:371:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:investors can invest in new projects producing more wealth and they are relatively optimistic 
15:801:45250:13:14:70:526:358:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:about  future  activities.  These  findings  are  concordant  with  the  recent  study  conducted  by 
15:802:45352:14:14:70:527:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Tursoy  and  Faisal  (2016)  for  Turkey.  Similarly,  when  analysing  the  long-run  coefficient  of 
15:803:45455:14:14:70:527:330:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:metals prices,  it  was  found  that  positive  and  negative  shocks  applied  to  metals prices also 
15:804:45556:14:14:70:527:316:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:affected economic  activity positively  and  significantly.  This  suggests  that  the  importance  of 
15:805:45658:14:13:70:527:302:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:metals prices in  the  development  of  the  Turkish  cannot  be  ignored  in  the  long-run.  As  such, 
15:806:45763:13:14:70:527:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:policymakers  should  consider  the  role  and  importance  of  metals prices in  the  Turkish 
15:807:45858:14:14:70:527:275:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economy, which should be efficiently managed in the long run. Furthermore, a negative shock 
15:808:45948:14:14:70:527:261:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to  metals prices (0.0602,  0.0196)  has  a  positive  and  significant  impact  in both the  previous 
15:809:46050:14:14:70:198:247:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:period and current period. 
15:810:46076:14:13:70:73:233:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
15:811:46076:13:14:70:527:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:In  the  short run,  it  is  noted  that stock prices (positive  shock) are positively  linked  with 
15:812:46175:14:14:70:527:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economic  activity;  however,  a  positive  shock on stock prices (at  lag  1)  has  a  negative  and 
15:813:46276:14:14:70:527:192:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:significant effect on economic activity. This finding suggests that any positive shock on stock 
15:814:46372:14:14:70:526:178:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:prices in  the  previous  period  has  a  negative  impact  in  the  following  period.  However,  a 
15:815:46473:14:13:70:527:164:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:negative  shock  to stock prices (0.0943,  0.0028)  has  a  positive  and  significant  impact  on 
15:816:46572:13:14:70:526:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:current and previous periods (lag 1). Similarly, a positive shock to metals prices has a positive 
15:817:46670:14:14:70:527:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and significant impact on economic activity, although this impact (-0.0179) is negative in the 
15:818:46765:14:14:70:526:123:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:previous period  at lag 1. Therefore, in summary,  it has been  concluded that stock prices and 
15:819:46861:14:14:70:527:109:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:metals prices have  a  positive  and  significant  impact  on economic  activity,  which  is  in  line 
15:820:46964:14:13:70:312:95:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:with the findings derived from the ARDL model.

16:848:47739:14:14:70:527:391:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The empirical results of the long-run coefficients and asymmetry tests are shown in Table-10. 
16:849:47833:14:14:70:527:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The long-run coefficients on LEQ+ and LEQ- are 0.046 and -0.080, respectively, and are also 
16:850:47923:14:14:70:527:363:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:statistically  significant.  This  implies  that  if stock prices  rise  by  1%,  this  increases  the 
16:851:48026:14:13:70:526:349:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economic  activity by  0.046%.  However,  a  decline  of  1%  in stock prices  would  cause 
16:852:48117:13:14:70:527:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economic  activity to  decrease  by  0.080%.  Similar  findings  were  also  confirmed  for  metals 
16:853:48215:14:14:70:527:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:prices.  The  long-run  coefficient  on  metals prices LM+ and  LM- are  0.094  and -0.055, 
16:854:48303:14:14:70:526:308:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:respectively. It was further noted that stock prices and metals prices (composite index) adjust 
16:855:48399:14:14:70:527:294:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:asymmetrically  in the long-run  and  short-run  under  the  framework  of  the  asymmetric  test. 
16:856:48498:14:13:70:527:280:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Finally,  multiple  dynamic  adjustments are  also applied. The empirical results  for the 
16:857:48588:13:14:70:527:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:cumulative   dynamic   multiplier   have   been   shown   in Figure-2.   The   plot   identifies   the 
16:858:48691:14:14:70:527:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:adjustment  of economic  activity to  the  new  equilibrium  position  following  a  negative  or 
16:859:48788:14:14:70:526:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:positive  shock  in stock prices and  metals prices,  respectively.  The  plots  of  the  dynamic 
16:860:48885:14:14:70:527:225:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:multiplier  are  estimated  on  the  basis  of  NARDL  model using  the  AIC  criterion.  The  green

17:871:49609:14:13:70:527:560:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Figure-2 confirms  the  overall  existence  of  a  positive  relationship  between economic  activity 
17:872:49709:13:14:70:527:547:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and stock prices. The effect of a positive shock in stock prices is dominant over the negative 
17:873:49804:14:14:70:527:533:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:shock.  Furthermore,  an  asymmetric  reaction  to stock prices is  also  observed.  Additionally, a 
17:874:49905:14:14:70:527:519:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:positive  relationship  between  metal prices and economic  activity was  found,  because the 
17:875:49997:14:14:70:527:505:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:negative shocks in the metal prices have a positive effect on economic activity as the positive 
17:876:50091:14:13:70:527:491:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:shock  is  dominant  over  the  negative  shock.  This  implies  that  metal prices positively  affect 
17:877:50193:13:14:70:527:478:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economic  activity.  These  findings  also  corroborate  the  findings obtained  from the ARDL 
17:878:50288:14:14:70:109:464:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:model.

17:884:50331:14:14:70:527:381:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:This study analyses the long-run and short-run relationship between stock prices, metal prices 
17:885:50426:14:14:70:527:367:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and economic activity in Turkey. The study utilises monthly data and covers the period from 
17:886:50517:14:13:70:527:353:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:January  1986  until  December  2016.  The  linear  long-run  relationship  was  analysed  using  the 
17:887:50619:13:14:70:527:340:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:ARDL  bounds  test,  while  the  robustness  of the ARDL  bounds  test  was verified by applying 
17:888:50714:14:14:70:527:326:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the Bayer-Hanck combined cointegration test. These cointegration tests confirmed the strong 
17:889:50806:14:14:70:526:312:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:evidence  of  cointegration between  the variables.  The  empirical  results  of  FMOLS  indicated 
17:890:50905:14:14:70:527:298:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that  metals prices and  equity prices have  a  positive  relationship  with economic  activity.  The 
17:891:51007:14:13:70:526:284:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:robustness  of  FMOLS  was  performed  using  DOLS  and  CCR.  Furthermore,  the  asymmetric 
17:892:51100:13:14:70:527:271:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:relationship  between  metals prices, stock prices and economic  activity was  investigated 
17:893:51190:14:14:70:526:257:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:further using the non-linear asymmetric ARDL cointegration developed by Shin et al. (2014). 
17:894:51281:14:14:70:526:243:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:This  approach  can  assist  with  the  identification  of  the  impact  of  the  positive  and  negative 
17:895:51387:14:14:70:527:229:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:shocks  on economic  activity  of stock prices and  metals prices. It  was  observed  that  a  strong 
17:896:51488:14:13:70:527:215:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:asymmetric  cointegration  exists  among the  examined  variables.  A  positive  and  statistically 
17:897:51587:13:14:70:527:202:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:significant  impact  of stock prices and  metals prices on economic  activity was  observed. 
17:898:51679:14:14:70:527:188:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Positive  and  negative  shocks  in stock prices and  metals prices have  a  positive  impact  on 
17:899:51777:14:14:70:527:174:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economic activity, which corroborates the findings obtained from FMOLS, DOLS, and CCR. 
17:900:51864:14:14:70:527:160:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Finally, diagnostic analysis suggests the validity and reliability of the empirical findings. The 
17:901:51961:14:13:70:527:146:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:dynamic multiplier also implies the overall existence of a positive impact of stock prices and 
17:902:52056:13:14:70:246:133:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:metals prices on economic activity.  
17:903:52092:14:14:70:73:119:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
17:904:52092:14:16:70:527:105:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Therefore,  with  the  empirical  analysis,  we  can  conclude  that  all  the variables  anyhow  is 
17:905:52192:16:16:70:527:89:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:affecting the each other. The most important aspect of the findings is that metals prices affect 
17:906:52284:16:0:70:527:73:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:industrial  production  and stock prices. The empirical  evidence  supports the  view  that  metals

18:917:52724:0:16:70:527:760:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:prices  positively  effect economic  activity. The  industrial  sector  represents  the production  of 
18:918:52826:16:16:70:527:744:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  economy  and  the  economic  activity that  directly  affects output.  In  the  beginning,  we 
18:919:52924:16:16:70:527:728:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:assumed  that  metals  are  the  most  critical  component  for  the  production;  therefore, we  can 
18:920:53026:16:16:70:526:712:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:conclude  that  metal  prices  as  an  indicator, adding  a  positive  impact  of  final  output  of  the 
18:921:53131:16:16:70:527:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economy. This shows  the importance  of  metal  prices that  needed  to  follow  by  the market 
18:922:53224:16:16:70:527:680:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:B:participant  to  having  information  about  countries’  production  level.  Consequently,  metals 
18:923:53323:16:15:70:526:664:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:prices are a significant indicator for market participants and the firms that are engaged in the 
18:924:53420:15:16:70:527:649:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:production  of  the  economy.  For  the  market  participants, metal  prices  also provide  relevant 
18:925:53519:16:16:70:527:633:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:information  for  the  decision-making  process. With  the  industrial  revolution,  metals  prices 
18:926:53619:16:16:70:527:617:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:kept significant share into the global trade competition to produce more innovative products. 
18:927:53712:16:16:70:527:601:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Moreover,  to  following  any  kind  of  prices  are more  important  for  the  market  participants  to 
18:928:53817:16:16:70:527:585:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:giving proper decisions. Meanwhile, there is a negative relationship between stock prices and 
18:929:53909:16:16:70:527:569:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:metals   prices for   the   studied   period   in Turkey. From   the   perspective   of   the market 
18:930:54009:16:16:70:527:553:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:participants, equity  and  metals  price  move in opposite  directions. Investment  activities,  in 
18:931:54105:16:15:70:526:537:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:general,  are  based  on  information.  All  these  indices  which  are  followed  by  the  market 
18:932:54204:15:16:70:527:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:participants  provide  critical  information  for them  to make proper  decisions about  their 
18:933:54297:16:16:70:527:506:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:investments. In  particular,  investment  activities  are  defined  by  information-based  decision 
18:934:54397:16:16:70:527:490:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:making, and these are connected to the Efficient Market Hypothesis. Therefore, to investigate 
18:935:54491:16:16:70:526:474:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  market  prices  and  provide  new  empirical  evidence  are  important  to  guide  the  market 
18:936:54591:16:26:70:441:458:12:Times New Roman:11:g_d0_f6:B:participants to give a proper decision about their investments and portfolios.
