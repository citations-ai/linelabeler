2:34:2029:28:28:273:338:616:12:Times:12:Times:C:ABSTRACT
2:35:2037:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:Among  stock  market  entrants,  more  firms  over  time  are  R&D–intensive  with  initially  lower 
2:36:2138:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:profitability but higher growth potential. This sample-selection effect determines the secular trend 
2:37:2238:14:14:72:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:in  U.S.  public firms’  cash  holdings.  A  stylized  firm  industry  model  allows  us  to  analyze  two 
2:38:2344:14:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:competing  changes to  the  selection  mechanism:  a  change  in  industry  composition  and  a  shift 
2:39:2446:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:toward  less  profitable  R&D–firms. The  latter  is  key  to  generating  higher  cash  ratios  at  IPO, 
2:40:2551:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:necessary for the secular increase, whereas the former mechanism amplifies this effect. The data 
2:41:2647:14:42:72:497:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:confirm the prominent role played by selection, and corroborate the model’s predictions.

3:52:2892:0:36:72:208:721:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:1    Introduction
3:53:2909:36:24:89:539:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:TheaverageU.S. public firm has changed its characteristics over the last 35 years.  The
3:54:2996:24:24:72:540:661:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:disappearance  of  dividends  (Fama  and  French  (2001)),  the  decline  in  profitability  (Fama
3:55:3094:24:24:72:540:637:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  French  (2004)),  the  increase  in  cash  holdings  (Bates  et  al.  (2009))  and  firm-specific
3:56:3196:24:23:72:540:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:risk measures (Davis et al. (2007) and Brown and Kapadia (2007)) are phenomena of this
3:57:3282:23:24:72:540:590:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:period.  A change in the behavior of the average public firm could be caused by a change in
3:58:3373:24:24:72:540:566:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the behavior of incumbent firms as well as by the selection of a different type of firm into
3:59:3465:24:24:72:421:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the stock market that gradually replaces incumbent firms over time.
3:60:3532:24:24:89:539:518:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This  paper  studies  and  quantifies  the  role  of  sample  selection  for  the  secular  increase
3:61:3632:24:24:72:539:494:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the average cash–to–assets ratio of U.S. public companies over the last 35 years.1The
3:62:3720:24:24:72:540:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:following facts motivate our research.  Since the beginning of the 1980s, firms went public
3:63:3811:24:24:72:540:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with progressively higher cash–to–assets ratios, but they reduced their cash ratios gradually
3:64:3904:24:24:72:540:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:afterward (see Figure 1).2This feature of the data is indicative of a sample-selection mecha-
3:65:3997:24:24:72:540:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nism, namely, a change in the conditions that determine which firms choose to enter the stock
3:66:4090:24:24:72:539:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:market.  Figure 2shows that at least two features of entering cohorts have changed over time,
3:67:4183:24:23:72:540:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pointing to two different selection mechanisms.  First, the share of R&D–intensive firms in
3:68:4274:23:24:72:540:327:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:U.S. public markets has increased substantially due to a growing fraction of R&D–intensive
3:69:4364:24:24:72:540:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:newly listed firms (left panel).  Second, R&D–intensive firms have entered with progressively
3:70:4457:24:24:72:540:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:higher cash balances (right panel), suggesting a change in the type of R&D–intensive stock
3:71:4547:24:24:72:157:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:market entrants.
3:72:4563:24:24:89:539:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The compositional change of U.S. public companies corresponds to a shift in the com-
3:73:4647:24:24:72:540:207:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:position  of  the  overall  U.S.  economy  toward  R&D–intensive  firms.3For  example,Halti-
3:74:4739:24:18:72:539:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wanger,  Hathaway,  and Miranda(2014) document a significant increase in the number of
3:75:4825:18:16:85:539:165:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:1We  report  the  evolution  of  the  average  cash–to–assets  ratio  of  U.S.  listed  firms  during  the  period
3:76:4939:16:8:72:187:149:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:1958–2014 in AppendixB.
3:77:4962:8:16:85:539:141:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:2Figure1  presents  the  cash–to–assets  ratio  dynamics  at  the  cohort  level  starting  with  the  1959-1963
3:78:5074:16:12:71:539:125:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:cohort.  The red dot marks the average cash holdings at entry for each cohort.  The straight blue line links
3:79:5182:12:12:71:539:113:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:the initial average cash holdings upon entry to the average cash holdings of the cohort in 2013.  A negative
3:80:5290:12:12:71:539:101:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:(positive) slope means the average cash holdings at the cohort level decline (increase).  The first observation
3:81:5401:12:8:71:343:89:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:is the average cash–to–assets ratio of incumbent firms in 1958.
3:82:5464:8:16:85:539:81:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:3This fact has been widely documented by the literature on the structural change of the U.S. economy
3:83:5564:16:0:71:401:65:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:after World War II (e.g.Buera and Kaboski(2012) and references therein).

4:124:6840:11:12:72:539:105:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:firm belongs to an industry (three-level digitSICcode) whose average R&D investment amounts to at least
4:125:6943:12:11:71:539:93:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:2% of assets over the sample period.  We group firms into cohorts of five years starting from 1959.  We define

5:129:7337:24:24:72:327:673:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:IPO by R&D–intensive firms, all else being equal.

5:132:7576:23:24:72:540:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are  smaller,  less  profitable,  and  appear  to  exhibit  higher  cash-flow  volatility  compared  to
5:133:7679:24:24:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:previous cohorts.  In the spirit ofFama and French(2004), the selection of a different type
5:134:7770:24:24:72:540:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of firm could be driven by more favorable IPO conditions that have allowedweakerfirms to
5:135:7858:24:24:72:539:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:go public (i.e.,“a downward shift in the supply curve for new list equity funding” Fama and

5:137:8037:24:24:72:540:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the Employment Retirement Income Security Act’s (ERISA) “Prudent Man” Rule passed by
5:138:8121:24:24:72:540:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Congress in 1979 that induced pension funds to invest in riskier (i.e., smaller, less profitable,
5:139:8218:24:24:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and higher growth option) ventures.4The ensuing improvement in IPO conditions for risky
5:140:8305:24:24:72:516:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms might have particularly benefited R&D–intensive firms, as indicated by Figure2.
5:141:8390:24:24:89:539:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the first part of this paper, we build a stylized firm industry model with endogenous
5:142:8478:24:23:72:540:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:entry to gain insights into how these two selection mechanisms can shape the secular increase
5:143:8571:23:24:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in cash holdings. The benefit of a model is that we can isolate confounding effects and develop
5:144:8666:24:24:72:540:315:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:testable predictions.  In the second part of the paper, we test whether the data corroborate
5:145:8758:24:24:72:194:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the model’s predictions.
5:146:8782:24:24:89:539:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our firm industry model assumes firms belong to two sectors that share the same pro-
5:147:8866:24:24:72:540:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:duction  technology  and  financing  opportunities.   We  interpret  old-economy  firms  as  non-
5:148:8963:24:24:72:540:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:R&D–intensive and new-economy firms as R&D–intensive.  Guided by the evidence in Fig-
5:149:9048:24:18:72:540:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ure2, we assume that only firms in the new-economy sector experience an improvement in
5:150:9134:18:15:85:540:177:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f9:F:4As noted inLongstreth(1987, page 101)“The Venture Capital and Innovation Study prepared in 1984
5:151:9230:15:12:71:539:162:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:for  the  Joint  Economic  Committee  of  the  Congress  reports  that  63.5  percent  of  the  venture  capital  firms
5:152:9349:12:12:71:539:150:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:consulted believed there was a bias among institutional investors against investing in small businesses, with
5:153:9458:12:12:71:539:138:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:the leading causes being a lack of institutional expertise in small business investing and the ”excessive risk-
5:154:9569:12:12:71:539:126:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:adverse behavior of institutional investors.” While perhaps itself biased, this view lends some support to the
5:155:9679:12:12:71:539:114:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:idea that the prudent man rule exerts a restraining influence.  More tel ling was the study’s findings (a) that
5:156:9790:12:12:71:539:102:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:the liberalizing regulations issued by the Labor Department in June 1979 were a ”major factor” in the surge
5:157:9897:12:12:71:539:90:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:of  pension  fund  investment  in  venture  capital  after  that  date,  and  (b)  that  the  uncertainties  of  the  federal

5:159:10138:12:12:71:539:66:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:may  have  contributed  to  a  shift  toward  greater  risk  aversion  by  pension  fund  fiduciaries  from  1974,  when
5:160:10258:12:0:71:354:54:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:ERISA was enacted, until the interpretative regulations of 1979.”
6:161:10324:0:24:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the conditions that influence their entry decisions.  A reduction in entry costs causes firms
6:162:10417:24:24:72:540:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with lower idiosyncratic productivity (i.e., less profitable firms with high growth potential)
6:163:10511:24:24:72:540:673:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to go public.  The assumed mean reversion in the productivity process implies these firms
6:164:10600:24:24:72:540:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have higher funding needs and choose higher cash balances at entry to save up for future
6:165:10688:24:23:72:540:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investment opportunities in order to avoid equity issuance costs.  As these firms grow, they
6:166:10780:23:24:72:540:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reduce their cash holdings given that they can rely more on internal funds, thus making the
6:167:10871:24:24:72:315:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model consistent with the evidence in Figure 1.
6:168:10918:24:24:89:539:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The model predicts that the first selection mechanism, a change in the industry compo-
6:169:11004:24:24:72:540:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sition at entry (across-industryselection),  plays no role in shaping the secular increase in
6:170:11097:24:24:72:540:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cash.  However,  it provides an important amplification mechanism when coupled with the
6:171:11184:24:24:72:539:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:entry of less-profitable, high-growth-potential new-economy firms (intra-industryselection).
6:172:11276:24:24:72:540:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This second selection effect is necessary to generate increasing cash holdings at entry over
6:173:11368:24:24:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time that, in turn, lead to a steady increase in the average cash–to–assets ratio in the cross
6:174:11462:24:24:72:540:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:section.  In addition, the model suggests the turnover ratio plays a major role in determining
6:175:11556:24:24:72:540:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  cash  holdings  of  entering  firms  given  its  tight  connection  with  firm-level  profitability
6:176:11660:24:23:72:502:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:since the ratio of sales over total assets is proportional to profitability in the model.
6:177:11749:23:24:89:539:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the second part of the paper, we measure the importance of sample selection in de-
6:178:11834:24:24:72:540:315:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:termining  the  secular  increase  in  cash,  and  test  the  model’s  predictions  in  the  data.   We
6:179:11937:24:24:72:540:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:first show that sample selection is a major cause for the secular increase in cash holdings.
6:180:12029:24:24:72:540:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Our evidence is straightforward.  On average,  firms deplete their cash holdings over time,
6:181:12120:24:24:72:540:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as measured by a negative time trend within firms.  Yet,  on average,  firms’ cash holdings
6:182:12211:24:24:72:540:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have increased.  Thus, the increase in cash holdings is a consequence of newly listed firms
6:183:12302:24:24:72:540:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increasing  their  cash  holdings  at  entry  faster  than  the  rate  at  which  incumbents  deplete
6:184:12403:24:24:72:540:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:theirs.  Using a simple accounting identity, we decompose the change in the average cash-to-
6:185:12495:24:24:72:540:147:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assets ratio over the period 1979–2013 (0.151) in the contribution due to the entry margin
6:186:12585:24:24:72:540:123:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(sample-selection effect) and the contribution due to incumbent firms (within effect).  We
6:187:12675:24:23:72:540:99:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:show  that  sample  selection  accounts  for  more  than  200%  of  the  secular  increase  in  cash
6:188:12775:23:24:72:535:76:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:holdings (0.329), whereas the contribution of the within change is actually -117% (-0.178).
6:189:12866:24:0:89:539:52:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Next, we present evidence for the two selection mechanisms our model highlights.  To this
7:190:12956:0:24:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:end, we construct random subsamples from the data that control for both selection effects
7:191:13045:24:24:72:540:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:so that (1) R&D–intensive entrants in the stock market have an average cash–to–assets ratio
7:192:13136:24:24:72:540:673:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as  in  1974-1978  (pre-secular  increase),  and  (2)  the  proportion  of  R&D–intensive  entrants
7:193:13235:24:24:72:540:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is the same as in 1974-1978.  When both restrictions are imposed, we can hardly generate
7:194:13323:24:23:72:540:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a positive trend in average cash holdings.  At the same time,  R&D–intensive entrants are
7:195:13412:23:24:72:540:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relatively  larger  and  more  efficient  (i.e.,  higher  turnover  ratio)  compared  to  the  data,  as
7:196:13516:24:24:72:539:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:predicted  by  the  model.   Allowing  for  anacross-industryselection  mechanism  by  lifting
7:197:13610:24:24:72:540:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:restriction (2) results in a small increase in average cash holdings that is not large enough
7:198:13703:24:24:72:540:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to fit the data.  Moreover,  R&D–intensive entrants are larger and exhibit higher turnover
7:199:13793:24:24:72:540:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ratios compared to the actual sample.  Lifting only restriction (1), that is, allowing for an
7:200:13886:24:24:72:540:482:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:B:intra-industryselection, results in R&D–intensive entrants whose evolution of characteristics
7:201:13979:24:24:71:539:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in terms of size and turnover ratios are in line with the data.  As predicted by the model,
7:202:14070:24:24:71:539:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:average cash holdings increase, but not by as much as to match the data.  For this to happen,
7:203:14163:24:24:71:539:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we need to lift both restrictions so that theacross-industryselection mechanism amplifies
7:204:14252:24:24:72:342:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the effects of theintra-industryselection mechanism.
7:205:14304:24:23:89:539:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In our model, the turnover ratio is proportional to firm-level productivity and, as such, is
7:206:14396:23:24:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an important determinant for cash holdings at entry.  We conclude the empirical analysis by
7:207:14487:24:24:72:540:315:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assessing the explanatory power of the latter variable.  We find the turnover ratio is indeed
7:208:14580:24:24:72:540:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an important predictor of cash holdings at entry, and its dominant explanatory power is not
7:209:14671:24:24:72:540:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:subdued when we include a set of important determinants of corporate cash holdings that

7:214:15093:15:12:72:540:162:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:motive for holding cash is transaction costs (e.g., Baumol (1952), Tobin(1956),Miller and Orr(1966), and
7:215:15197:12:12:72:539:150:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:Vogel and Maddala(1967)).  Other motives include taxes (e.g.,Foley, Hartzell, Titman, and Twite(2007)),
7:216:15300:12:12:72:540:138:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:precautionary savings (e.g.,Froot, Scharfstein, and Stein(1993),Kim et al.(1998)), and agency costs (e.g.,

7:218:15504:12:12:72:540:114:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:an extensive test of these different motives.  In the last decade,  the secular increase in cash holdings has
7:219:15613:12:12:72:540:102:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:received much attention and spurred many explanations that are not based on sample selection, for example,

8:229:16518:23:24:72:540:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:our knowledge, our stylized model provides one of the first dynamic corporate finance models

8:231:16702:24:24:72:411:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consistent with the stylized facts we document in Figures1 and2.

8:234:16940:24:24:71:539:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:entry of less profitable firms over time is sufficient to generate higher cash–to–assets ratios and
8:235:17039:24:24:71:539:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:higher sales-growth volatility.  Empirical estimates that do not control for sample selection
8:236:17132:24:24:71:539:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:may incorrectly infer that the underlying cash–flow process has become more volatile.  Put
8:237:17222:24:24:71:539:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:differently, those estimates could assign too much importance to increased uncertainty when
8:238:17313:24:24:71:539:386:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:in fact selection contributed to the rise in measured cash-flow volatility and cash holdings.6
8:239:17407:24:23:89:539:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In this paper, we argue that selection is a key driver for the secular increase in the cash-
8:240:17499:23:24:71:539:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to-assets ratio.  We are not the first to point out that newly listed firms in R&D–intensive
8:241:17591:24:24:71:539:315:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:industries appear to play a role.7Bates, Kahle, and Stulz(2009) find that high–tech, non-
8:242:17680:24:24:71:539:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dividend payers and recently listed firms have successively higher cash ratios, but they also
8:243:17773:24:24:71:539:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:find an increase in the non-high–tech sectors.8Booth and Zhou(2013) present evidence that
8:244:17862:24:24:71:539:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  increase  in  the  average  cash–to–assets  ratio  is  due  to  changing  firm  characteristics  of
8:245:17966:24:24:71:540:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:high-tech firms that went public after 1980.  In concurrent work,Graham and Leary(2016)
8:246:18053:24:24:71:539:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:study  the  determinants  of  cash  policies  using  data  from  the  1920s  onward  to  investigate
8:247:18153:24:24:71:539:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:what factors were most important for cash holdings over different periods.  Related to the
8:248:18243:24:18:71:539:147:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:period we study, they also find that average cash holdings began to rise in about 1980 even
8:249:18334:18:15:85:539:129:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:6Roberts  and  Whited  (2013)  provide  a  survey  of  potential  endogeneity  issues  in  empirical  corporate
8:250:18445:15:8:72:105:114:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:finance.
8:251:18453:8:16:85:540:106:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:7Several papers find a positive relationship between cash and R&D expenditures (e.g.,Opler and Titman
8:252:18554:16:12:72:539:90:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:(1994),Opler, Pinkowitz, Stulz, and Williamson(1999),Brown and Petersen(2011),Falato and Sim(2014),

8:254:18749:8:0:85:299:70:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:8We discuss this difference in section3.2and3.3.
9:255:18798:0:24:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:though within-firm cash balances declined over this period.  They also attribute the post-

9:257:18977:24:24:72:378:673:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:tech NASDAQ firms going public with large cash balances.9
9:258:19034:24:24:89:539:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We expand on these insights by (1) proposing an empirical measure of the selection effect,

9:260:19213:23:24:72:540:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(3)  highlighting  the  importance  of  the  turnover  ratio  (sales  over  assets)  as  an  important
9:261:19315:24:24:72:529:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:determinant of cash holdings at entry and therefore the secular increase in cash holdings.
9:262:19405:24:24:89:539:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The paper is organized as follows.  We present the model in Section 2.  The results of the
9:263:19495:24:24:72:539:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:empirical analysis are in Section3.  We first empirically assess the contribution of sample
9:264:19586:24:24:72:539:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:selection to the secular increase in cash holdings.  Then, in Section3.4, we explicitly study
9:265:19679:24:24:72:540:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the impact of different selection mechanisms.  We conclude in Section3.5by comparing the
9:266:19767:24:24:72:540:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:explanatory power of the turnover ratio with other important determinants of corporate cash

9:269:19925:36:36:101:271:344:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:firm industry model
9:270:19944:36:24:89:539:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In this section, we develop a stylized heterogeneous firm industry model to illustrate how
9:271:20034:24:24:72:540:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:changes in the selection process can be a major driver of the average cash-to-assets ratio over
9:272:20129:24:24:72:540:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time.  We assume firms belong to one of two sectors labeled as the new-economy sector and
9:273:20218:24:24:72:540:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:old-economy sector.  We set up the firm problem similarly toRiddick and Whited(2009).
9:274:20303:24:24:72:540:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:That is,  firms use a decreasing returns-to-scale technology with capital as the only input.
9:275:20395:24:24:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Firms can finance themselves with equity or with internal funds.  We assume a time-invariant
9:276:20487:24:23:72:540:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mass of potential firms exists that endogenously decides to become public (i.e., entry in the
9:277:20580:23:24:72:515:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stock market).  These potential entrants are either new-economy or old-economy firms.
9:278:20665:24:24:89:539:117:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To highlight the effect of the entry margin, both firm types are modeled identically.  That
9:279:20756:24:18:72:540:93:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is, we assume firms in both sectors share the same production technology and have the same

9:281:20942:16:0:72:294:59:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:listed on the NYSE, and the remainder on AMEX.
10:282:20989:0:24:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:financing opportunities.  The only difference between these sectors is that, contrary to old-
10:283:21082:24:24:72:540:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:economy firms, new-economy firms experience a change in the conditions that influence their

12:365:24731:31:24:89:539:537:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This  section  describes  the  tight  link  between  the  cash–to–assets  ratio  of  entrants  and
12:366:24829:24:24:72:540:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their productivity state.  Before we go into more detail on this link, we first briefly sketch
12:367:24923:24:24:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:out the model parametrization.  The firm industry equilibrium and the solution method are
12:368:25012:24:24:72:540:465:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:described in the appendix (Section A.1).  We parametrize the model at an annual frequency
12:369:25101:24:24:72:540:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:using calibrated values that match key features of U.S. public firms.  The calibration strategy
12:370:25196:24:24:72:539:417:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is  laid  out  in  detail  in  SectionA.2.   To  highlight  the  role  of  selection,  we  calibrate  the
12:371:25301:24:24:72:539:393:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parameters listed in Table1 using the period 1959-1979, that is, before a marked increase
12:372:25390:24:24:72:540:369:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the cash–to-assets ratio.  Panel A lists standard parameters that we borrowed from the
12:373:25479:24:23:72:540:345:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:literature.  Panel B reports the calibrated parameters, their value, the targeted data moment,
12:374:25573:23:24:72:540:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the equivalent model moments.  Finally, Panel C reports the calibration target for the
12:375:25663:24:24:72:540:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:exit-rate parameterλthat has been chosen to map the age distribution in the model as close
12:376:25753:24:24:72:309:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as possible to the age distribution in the data.
12:377:25801:24:24:89:539:250:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The  policy  functions  (SectionA.3)  are  fairly  standard.   The  key  insights  from  those
12:378:25895:24:24:72:540:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:policy functions is the importance of precautionary financing for small firms.  Large firms
12:379:25986:24:24:72:540:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have a smaller precautionary savings motive because they rely on larger expected cash flows,
12:380:26078:24:24:72:540:178:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and for this  reason,  they need to retain less  cash  when  financing constraints are binding.
12:381:26173:24:24:72:540:154:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Conversely, small firms engage in larger precautionary savings, and in doing, so they deliver
12:382:26266:24:24:72:216:130:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a larger cash-to-assets ratio.
12:383:26296:24:17:89:539:106:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This paper stresses the importance of the entry margin, i.e.  the selection process.  The
12:384:26385:17:16:81:539:89:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:11We  follow  a  reduced-form  approach  to  model  the  going-public  decision  and  choose  not  to  model  the
12:385:26498:16:12:72:540:73:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:problem of the private firm.  The selection mechanisms that drive our results will also operate in a more

14:461:29963:24:23:72:540:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ratio.  Less profitable firms with low current productivity expect high growth and therefore
14:462:30055:23:24:72:540:204:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have a higher demand for investment in the long run.  To avoid tapping into costly external

14:467:30456:24:0:72:540:54:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms) shape the average cash holdings’ dynamics.  The starting point is the steady state of
15:468:30550:0:24:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the benchmark model calibrated to data from the 1959-1979 period, where the economy is
15:469:30636:24:24:72:219:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:populated by identical firms.
15:470:30665:24:24:89:539:673:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The first experiment is designed to explore the effect of a structural change in the com-

15:476:31195:24:24:71:539:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the average cash holdings of publicly traded firms.  The solid blue lines in the bottom
15:477:31285:24:24:71:539:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:panels of Figure4 show the increase in average cash holdings for new-economy firms (bottom
15:478:31375:24:24:72:540:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:left panel) is due to the increase in the proportion of young firms (bottom right panel).  Given
15:479:31471:24:24:72:540:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that exit is i.i.d., a progressively larger fraction of new-economy entrants leads to an increase
15:480:31568:24:24:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the proportion of young new-economy firms.  These firms are smaller and have, on average,
15:481:31660:24:24:72:432:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:larger cash-to-assets ratios relative to their more mature counterparts.
15:482:31732:24:24:89:539:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This  positive  effect  on  average  cash  holdings  is  counterbalanced  by  the  dynamics  of
15:483:31827:24:23:72:540:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cash holdings for old-economy firms,  as illustrated by the dashed red lines in the bottom
15:484:31917:23:24:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:panels of Figure4.  Because old economy firms enter in a smaller number, their composition
15:485:32007:24:24:72:540:315:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shifts  toward  more  mature  firms  that  have,  on  average,  lower  cash-to-assets  ratios.   This
15:486:32108:24:24:72:540:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effects leads to an initial decrease of average cash holdings.  It follows that the cash-holdings
15:487:32205:24:24:72:540:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dynamics in the two sectors offset each other, thus leaving the overall cash-to-assets ratio
15:488:32297:24:24:72:540:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unchanged over time, as described by the top left panel of Figure4.  Without a change in
15:489:32385:24:24:72:540:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the characteristics at entry of new-economy firms, the model cannot generate an increase in
15:490:32476:24:24:72:186:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:average cash holdings.
15:491:32498:24:24:89:539:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our second experiment investigates how a change in the characteristics of new-economy

17:506:33899:0:24:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:introduction, we study the response of the model to a reduction in the value of staying private
17:507:33994:24:24:72:540:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for new-economy firms.  We assume a reduction inVpover 35 years to mimic the dynamics
17:508:34079:24:24:71:539:673:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  the  relative  size  of  entering  firms.13Figure  5  shows  this  change  reduces  the  threshold
17:509:34181:24:24:71:539:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:productivity level for entry.  That is, even small (top right panel) and less productive firms
17:510:34275:24:23:71:539:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(i.e.,  low-profitability  firms  with  higher  growth  potential)  choose  to  go  public.   Because
17:511:34376:23:24:71:539:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the shocks are mean reverting, lower-productivity firms anticipate higher productivity in the
17:512:34469:24:24:71:539:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:future and raise more cash relative to their assets at the IPO stage (bottom right panel). This
17:513:34564:24:24:71:539:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:behavior is a natural consequence of the entrants’ policy function discussed in section2.3.
17:514:34655:24:24:71:539:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This selection mechanism only affects the average cash-to-assets ratio of new-economy firms
17:515:34746:24:24:71:540:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(bottom left panel),  thus replicating the empirical evidence in Figure2 of R&D–intensive
17:516:34835:24:24:71:539:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms entering with progressively higher cash balances.  The model can explain around 26%
17:517:34924:24:24:71:265:458:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:of the total change in cash holdings.14
17:518:34963:24:24:89:539:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:On its own, neither selection mechanism is quantitatively strong enough to explain the
17:519:35049:24:24:71:539:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:secular trend in cash holdings. However, the combination of theintra-industryselection effect
17:520:35142:24:24:71:539:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with theacross-industryselection effect - a purely selection-based mechanism - explains 46%
17:521:35233:24:23:71:135:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the trend.
17:522:35246:23:24:89:539:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Figure6 compares the data (dashed red lines) with the data generated by a model that
17:523:35330:24:24:71:539:315:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:considers both selection mechanisms (solid blue lines).  Adding a change in composition on
17:524:35420:24:24:71:539:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:top of a reduction in the value of staying private for new-economy firms helps  the model
17:525:35509:24:24:71:539:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:along two dimensions.  The model generates both a secular increase in cash holdings for new
17:526:35600:24:24:71:539:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:economy firms at entry (top right panel) and a shift in the composition toward new-economy

17:528:35785:24:24:71:539:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:number of new economy entrants that are smaller in the cross section, thus amplifying their
17:529:35876:24:18:71:539:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effect  on  the  average  cash-to-assets  ratio.   This  amplification  channel  leads  to  a  steeper
17:530:35978:18:15:81:539:153:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:13We calculate the relative size using median values of size at entry for the seven cohorts during the period

17:533:36297:12:12:72:539:114:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f7:F:t= 1,...,35.  We picka1anda2to minimize the distance between the relative size at entry generated by the
17:534:36401:12:8:72:248:102:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:model and the one observed in the data.
17:535:36440:8:16:81:539:94:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:14The increase in the average cash-to-assets ratio for new-economy firms leads to an overall increase from
17:536:36546:16:12:72:540:78:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:a steady-state value of 0.093 to a value of 0.133 (top left panel).  In the data, the average cash-to-assets ratio
17:537:36660:12:12:72:540:66:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:increases from a value of 0.081 in 1979 to a value of 0.235 in 2013.  Thus, the model explains around 26% of
17:538:36768:12:0:72:474:54:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:the total change in cash holdings documented in the data (i.e., (0.133-0.093)/(0.235-0.081)).

18:545:37350:24:24:72:540:306:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:78% increase (top left panel).  This purely selection-based model generates 46% (i.e., (0.166-

19:571:38880:24:23:72:540:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model.  As discussed above (section2.4), we target the size of new-economy firms relative to
19:572:38972:23:24:72:539:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:old-economy firms at entry to discipline the reduction inVP(outside option).  The model

19:574:39132:24:24:89:539:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:First, the model predicts new-economy entrants have not only become relatively smaller

20:597:40871:24:24:72:540:465:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:turnover ratio is a proxy for firm-level productivity and profitability.  Because of this link,
20:598:40966:24:23:72:540:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the turnover ratio should be an important empirical determinant of the cash-to-assets ratio
20:599:41057:23:24:72:540:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at the firm level.15These predictions are consistent with the findings in Fama and French
20:600:41146:24:24:72:540:394:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(2004), who document a steady decrease in size and profitability during the 1980–2001 period,

20:602:41278:24:24:89:539:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Second, the two selection mechanisms, in addition to generating a steady increase in the

20:606:41635:24:24:72:540:250:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model,  theintra-industryselection mechanism allows smaller firms to go public.  Because
20:607:41723:24:24:72:540:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of decreasing returns to scale,  smaller firms are characterized by higher and more volatile
20:608:41815:24:24:72:540:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:growth rates.  This feature is responsible for the steady increase in the dispersion of sales’
20:609:41909:24:23:72:540:178:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:growth  rates,  which  is  entirely  driven  by  sales  of  new  economy  firms  becoming  relatively

20:611:42038:19:12:81:438:136:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:15Notice that, given the stylized nature of the model, sales and profit do coincide.
20:612:42122:12:12:81:296:124:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:16The sales growth rate is defined in SectionA.2.

21:617:42555:0:24:89:539:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To sum up, our model suggests that any data analysis should pay attention to entry de-
21:618:42641:24:24:72:540:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cisions of firms, particularly when a specific firm type (here R&D–intensive firms) becomes
21:619:42732:24:24:72:540:673:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increasingly dominant in the sample.  Inference based on exogenous changes in deep param-
21:620:42821:24:24:72:540:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:eters (e.g., an increase in the cash–flow volatility parameter over time) can be confounded
21:621:42912:24:23:72:540:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with factors that are outside the firm’s optimization problem, but are due to changes in the
21:622:43004:23:24:72:540:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:selection process into the stock market.  For example, empirical estimates could assign too
21:623:43095:24:24:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:much importance to increased uncertainty when in fact selection contributes to the rise in

21:626:43279:35:24:89:539:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In  this  section,  we  explore  the  model’s  predictions  by  studying  how  sample  selection
21:627:43375:24:24:72:540:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:affects  the  secular  increase  in  the  cash–to–assets  ratio.   The  data  corroborate  what  the
21:628:43475:24:24:72:540:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model suggests:  most of the action for the change in the cash–to–assets ratio is at the entry
21:629:43569:24:24:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:margin and is driven by an increasing share of smaller and less profitable R&D–intensive
21:630:43657:24:24:72:483:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms with higher cash-to-assets ratios that went public during the last 35 years.
21:631:43739:24:24:89:539:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We first describe the data set and definitions.  Then we show a negative time trend exists

21:633:43922:24:24:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time trend.  A negative firm-level trend together with a positive trend in the cross-section
21:634:44014:24:23:72:540:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:suggests the secular increase in cash is mainly a byproduct of sample selection. We isolate the
21:635:44109:23:24:72:540:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effect of sample selection on the positive time trend using a simple accounting decomposition
21:636:44202:24:24:72:540:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and show that newly listed R&D–intensive firms are responsible for the bulk in the increase
21:637:44293:24:24:72:540:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  the  average  cash-to-assets  ratio.18We  conclude  our  analysis  by  providing  evidence  for
21:638:44392:24:24:72:540:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the two selection mechanisms discussed in the model and by studying the determinants of

21:640:44536:18:16:81:539:135:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:18We rule out firm exit as a driver of the secular increase in the cash–to–assets ratio (see figure12in the
21:641:44643:16:11:71:539:119:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:appendix).   We  find  the  average  cash–to–assets  ratio  at  exit  is  close  to  the  cross-sectional  average  of  the
21:642:44766:11:0:71:373:108:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:cash–to–assets ratio.  This behavior is consistent with exit being i.i.d.

24:674:49506:32:23:89:539:689:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The model presented in Section 2 is able to generate a positive trend in cash holdings
24:675:49592:23:24:72:540:666:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:despite the mean-reverting nature of the cash-to-assets ratio at the firm level, which means
24:676:49684:24:24:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that new entrants deplete cash at a lower rate than the rate at which they increase cash at
24:677:49775:24:24:72:539:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:entry, as illustrated in Figure7.  In this section, we provide evidence for this selection-based
24:678:49871:24:24:72:135:594:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:explanation.
24:679:49883:24:24:89:539:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We first estimate the time trend in the cash–to–assets ratio using all firms over the period
24:680:49975:24:24:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1979–2013.  The resulting trend is positive:  cash holdings represented around 11% of total
24:681:50066:24:24:72:540:522:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assets  for  the  typical  firm  in  1979,  and  they  have  increased  by  14%  over  the  subsequent
24:682:50168:24:24:72:540:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:35  years  (column  I  of  Table3).   Column  II  of  Table3  shows  the  differences  in  the  time
24:683:50268:24:24:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:trend across sectors by including a dummy variable that takes a value of zero if a firm is
24:684:50358:24:24:72:540:450:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:non-R&D–intensive, and 1 otherwise.  The estimated slope for the R&D sector is one order
24:685:50446:24:23:72:540:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of magnitude larger than the estimated slope for the non-R&D sector (66 b.p.  vs.  5.5 b.p.).
24:686:50539:23:24:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The implied increase in cash holdings for the non–R&D sector over the 35-year period is very
24:687:50631:24:24:72:540:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:small (around 2%), while cash holdings in the R&D sector surged from an average value of
24:688:50719:24:24:72:540:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:14% in 1979 to an average value of 35% in 2013.  The secular increase in the cash-to-assets
24:689:50810:24:24:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ratio appears to be a phenomenon that pertains almost exclusively to the R&D–intensive
24:690:50896:24:24:72:105:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sector.
24:691:50903:24:24:89:539:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Pooled OLS regressions allow us to identify R&D–intensive firms as the driver of the sec-
24:692:50992:24:24:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ular increase in cash holdings.  However, the cash–to–assets ratio is fairly persistent (see also
24:693:51089:24:24:72:539:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Figure13andLemmon et al.(2008)), and pooled OLS regressions are not conclusive with
24:694:51172:24:24:71:539:211:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:regard to each firm’s individual cash–to–assets evolution.  In fact, incumbent R&D–intensive
24:695:51264:24:24:71:539:187:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms  could  have  indeed  increased  their  cash–to–assets  ratios  over  time.   To  address  the
24:696:51364:24:23:71:539:163:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:persistence issue, we perform firm–by–firm regressions and report average values of the esti-
24:697:51457:23:24:71:539:140:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mated coefficients.  We set the time variable equal to zero the first year the firm appears in
24:698:51551:24:24:71:539:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the sample.  In this way, we control for the cash holdings at entry at the firm level.  The re-
24:699:51646:24:24:71:539:92:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sults show a negative change in average cash holdings for incumbents.  The estimated yearly
24:700:51737:24:0:71:539:68:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:within-firm change in average cash holdings over 35 years is -50 b.p.  (column III). Column
25:701:51830:0:24:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:IV shows that R&D–intensive firms start with much larger cash balances and deplete cash
25:702:51917:24:24:72:264:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:faster than non-R&D–intensive firms.
25:703:51953:24:24:89:539:673:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The estimates in columns III and IV represent the trend for an average public firm during

25:706:52220:23:24:72:540:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:IPO. In particular,  we defineyoung  firmsas firms that have been public for at most five

25:709:52490:24:24:72:540:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:V-VIII  show  that  (i)  both  young  and  mature  firms  deplete  cash  after  an  IPO,  (ii)  young
25:710:52591:24:24:72:540:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms deplete cash faster than mature firms, and (iii) the estimated slope for R&D–intensive
25:711:52683:24:24:72:540:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms is twice as large as the estimated slope for non–R&D–intensive firms.  No significant

25:713:52863:24:24:72:105:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sector.
25:714:52870:24:24:89:539:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The data show that a positive time trend in average cash holdings exists despite a negative

25:719:53231:31:24:89:539:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In this section, we directly measure the contribution of sample selection to the secular
25:720:53319:24:24:72:540:237:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increase in average cash holdings. Using a simple accounting decomposition, we find selection

25:722:53502:24:24:72:158:189:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a negative 120%.
25:723:53518:24:24:89:539:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The accounting decomposition allows us to isolate the part of the change in the average

26:780:54771:23:24:72:539:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:contribution of thewithin changeis actually -117% (-0.178).  These quantities are consistent
26:781:54863:24:24:72:335:337:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:with the results presented in the previous section.25

26:785:55175:24:19:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:737).   On  their  own,  they  explain  around  50%  of  the  overall  selection  effect,  whereas  the

26:803:56120:12:16:81:539:103:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:25The estimated change (within change) in average cash over 35 years implied by column III of Table 3
26:804:56221:16:12:71:539:87:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:is  -0.175.   The  contribution  of  selection  to  the  secular  increase  in  cash  holdings  can  be  calculated  as  the
26:805:56345:12:12:71:540:75:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:difference between the estimated change using pooled OLS (0.147, from column I of Table3 ) and the one

27:822:56833:11:12:72:540:417:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:three components:  the cumulative change due to incumbents (labeled “within”), the cumulative change due

27:829:57452:32:23:89:539:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:So far, our empirical evidence shows the importance of newly listed firms for the secular

28:867:59228:24:24:72:540:334:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to generate increasing cash holdings at entry over time that leads to a steady increase in

28:869:59421:23:24:72:540:287:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mechanisms by assuming that over the period 1979-2013, (1) R&D–intensive entrants in the
28:870:59509:24:24:72:540:263:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stock market have an average cash-to-asset ratio as in 1974-1978 and (2) the proportion of
28:871:59599:24:24:72:540:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:R&D–intensive  entrants  is  the  same  as  in  1974-1978.   According  to  the  model  (see  Table
28:872:59698:24:24:72:540:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2),  imposing  (1)  is  sufficient  to  shut  down  the  secular  increase  in  cash  holdings  and  the
28:873:59802:24:24:72:540:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:associated increase in sales’ growth rate dispersion.  In addition, we should observe relatively
28:874:59898:24:24:72:540:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:larger and more efficient R&D–intensive entrants only when the first mechanism is in place,
28:875:59989:24:24:72:540:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:whereas the change in composition has no role other than amplifying the effect of a change
28:876:60079:24:24:72:337:119:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the type of R&D–intensive firm that goes public.
28:877:60130:24:24:89:540:95:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Table5 reports our empirical results.  We start by analyzing the full sample of firms in
28:878:60218:24:0:72:540:71:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Panel A. The data show how the secular increase in the cash–to–assets ratio is connected
29:879:60308:0:24:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to a positive trend in sales’ dispersion and to a relative decrease both in size and efficiency
29:880:60403:24:24:72:540:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of R&D–intensive entrants,  indicative of a change in the type of R&D firms that became
29:881:60490:24:24:72:106:673:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:public.
29:882:60497:24:24:89:539:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In Panel B, we study how this link changes after controlling for selection.  The data for
29:883:60586:24:23:72:540:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Panel B are a random sample of the full dataset under the two restrictions discussed above.
29:884:60677:23:24:72:540:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We repeat the exercise 500 times and report average values across simulations.  Moreover,
29:885:60766:24:24:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we  ensure  the  fraction  of  entrants  since  1979  corresponds  to  the  one  in  the  data.   This
29:886:60868:24:24:72:540:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:exercise shows that without the help of selection, the increase in the cash-to-assets ratio is
29:887:60962:24:24:72:540:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:negligible  and  fluctuates  around  11%  for  the  first  four  sub-samples  and  slightly  increases
29:888:61064:24:24:72:540:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for the last three (column I). At the same time,  the increase in sales’ dispersion virtually
29:889:61157:24:24:72:540:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:disappears (column II) because R&D–intensive firms do not experience an increase in relative
29:890:61249:24:24:72:540:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dispersion (column III). Panel B shows that selection at entry is a key driver for the secular
29:891:61343:24:24:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:trends in cash holdings and firm-level volatility.  When we restrict R&D–intensive firms to
29:892:61434:24:24:72:540:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:enter with the same cash–to–assets ratio (columns V and VI) and in the same proportion
29:893:61520:24:24:72:540:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(column VII), R&D–intensive entrants are relatively larger (column VIII) and more efficient
29:894:61611:24:23:72:138:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(column IX).
29:895:61623:23:24:89:539:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In Panel C, we analyze the importance of the across-industry selection mechanism.  To
29:896:61708:24:24:72:540:315:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this end, we randomly sample the data but only place restriction (1);  that is, we shut off
29:897:61799:24:24:72:540:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the within-industry selection effect.  A change in the composition of R&D–intensive entrants
29:898:61891:24:24:72:540:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:alone contributes very little to the secular increase in cash holdings, as the model predicts.
29:899:61985:24:24:72:540:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Similar to the results in Panel B, when we control for within-industry selection alone, the
29:900:62076:24:24:72:540:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sample exhibits R&D–intensive entrants that are relatively larger and more profitable (i.e.,
29:901:62168:24:24:72:540:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:larger turnover ratio) compared to the actual data (see Panel A). The data thus support the
29:902:62259:24:24:72:540:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prediction that generating a positive trend in cash holdings without the entry of smaller and
29:903:62352:24:0:72:230:147:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:less profitable firms is difficult.

31:954:65667:0:24:89:539:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In Panel D, we shut off the across-industry selection mechanism and turn on the intra-

31:958:66038:24:23:72:540:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:falling, as the model predicts.  At the same time, without the amplification effect provided

31:962:66323:31:24:89:539:500:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The  results  in  the  previous  section  highlight  a  tight  connection  between  the  cash-to-

31:964:66516:24:24:72:540:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:turnover  ratio).   In  this  section,  we  compare  the  explanatory  power  of  the  latter  variable
31:965:66619:24:24:72:392:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with other important determinants of corporate cash holdings.
31:966:66680:24:24:89:539:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:First we show in Figure9 firms’ average cash holdings for each cohort of entrants around
31:967:66768:24:24:72:540:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the IPO year. For both sectors, average cash holdings are smaller before the IPO year and de-

31:969:66951:24:24:71:539:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sector (left panel) shows a secular trend in average cash holdings before the IPO year, a phe-
31:970:67045:24:24:71:469:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nomenon that clearly does not depend on a higher retention of IPO proceeds.
31:971:67120:24:23:89:540:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Table6 studies what determines the cash–to–assets ratio entry by focusing on quantities

31:973:67296:24:24:72:539:237:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the cash holding literature (e.g.,Azar et al.(2016) andBates et al.(2009)) and include the
31:974:67386:24:24:71:539:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:turnover ratio as a proxy for the underlying total revenue productivity shock, as suggested
31:975:67477:24:24:71:539:189:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by the model.  In column I, we consider all variables.  Only the T-bill rate does not enter
31:976:67568:24:24:71:539:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:significantly.27In column II, we report the Shapley-Owen’s R-square decomposition (Israeli

31:978:67744:19:15:81:539:122:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:26We can perform these calculations because Compustat reports up to three years of firms’ accounting
31:979:67844:15:8:72:176:107:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:data prior to their IPO.
31:980:67868:8:16:81:539:99:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:27Following Azar et al.(2016), we include the T-bill as a main predictor of corporate cash holdings.  Unlike

35:1074:73473:36:24:89:539:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This paper finds that sample selection has been a key driver of the increase in the average
35:1075:73564:24:24:72:540:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cash–to–assets ratio for U.S. public companies over the last 35 years.  While new entrants to
35:1076:73657:24:24:72:540:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the stock market have increased their cash–to–assets ratios, the typical U.S. public company
35:1077:73749:24:24:72:540:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:experiences a decline in cash holdings over time.  The selection effect is powerful enough to
35:1078:73842:24:23:72:446:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reverse the negative within-firm effect and to generate a secular increase.

35:1083:74277:24:24:72:540:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:up  by the  data  as we  show with bootstrap  sampling  techniques.  The data also  show the

43:1286:86909:24:24:89:539:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We calibrate the remaining parameters to match key moments, using data from the period
43:1287:86995:24:24:71:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1959–1979.  The proportion of potential entrants of type old (ω) is set to 0.668.  This value
43:1288:87088:24:24:71:539:450:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:allows us to replicate the composition of publicly traded firms during the period 1959-1979.
43:1289:87180:24:23:71:540:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We set the persistence parameter equal to 0.90 – a value within the estimates provided by
43:1290:87269:23:24:71:539:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Hennessy and Whited(2007) – to match the standard deviation of the sales’ growth rate
43:1291:87354:24:24:71:494:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:during the period 1959-1979.  We define the latter quantity as ∆yt=yt−yt−10.5yt−1+0.5yt−1.
43:1292:87444:24:24:89:539:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Then we calibrate a set of parameters to replicate key cash holdings moments for publicly
43:1293:87533:24:24:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:traded firms in 1979.  First, we calibrate the cost of carrying cash inside the firm,ν, to match
43:1294:87629:24:24:72:540:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the average cash–to–assets ratio.  Second, we choose a number for the value of staying private
43:1295:87723:24:24:72:540:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to match the average cash–to–assets ratio at entry.  The proportional equity issuance cost
43:1296:87813:24:24:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(κ) is set to match the average equity-to-assets ratio over the period 1959-1979.  We define
43:1297:87905:24:24:72:540:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the cash–to–assets ratio in the model as cash holdings divided by the beginning of the period
43:1298:87998:24:24:72:540:211:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:capital plus cash holdings, whereas the equity–to–assets ratio as equity issuance divided by
43:1299:88090:24:24:72:351:187:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the beginning of the period capital plus cash holdings.
43:1300:88145:24:23:89:542:163:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The parameter that governs the investment adjustment cost is set to deliver an investment-

43:1302:88322:24:24:89:539:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The parameter that governs the shape of the Pareto distribution,ξ, over the set of signals
43:1303:88412:24:18:72:540:92:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is chosen to match the size of entrants relative to the size of incumbents of age 5.  We measure
43:1304:88508:18:16:81:540:74:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:28We measure the investment rate in the data as capital expenditures (Compustat itemcapx) divided by
43:1305:88608:16:0:72:411:58:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:the previous period value of net property, plant, and equipment (itemppent).

44:1307:88777:24:24:72:213:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their empirical counterpart.
44:1308:88805:24:24:89:539:673:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To  conclude,  we  set  the  exogenous  exit  rate  (λ)  to  7%,  a  value  that  delivers  an  age
44:1309:88904:24:24:72:540:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(i.e.,  years  since  entry)  distribution  close  to  the  age  distribution  in  Compustat  over  the
44:1310:89007:24:23:72:539:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:period 1979-2013 (Panel C of Table1).  In our model (as in the data), the years since entry
44:1311:89098:23:24:72:540:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:distribution matters because firms that recently IPOed tend to be smaller and have larger
44:1312:89187:24:24:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cash–to–assets ratios.  For this reason, we choose an exit rate that delivers an age distribution
44:1313:89284:24:47:72:233:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as close as possible to the data.

44:1315:89325:31:24:89:539:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We solve the incumbent problem by value function iteration.  We discretize the firm-level
44:1316:89414:24:24:72:540:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shock with 35 grid points using the method inRouwenhorst(1995).  We discretize the capital
44:1317:89504:24:24:72:540:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:grid using 200 grid points, the net leverage grid for old-economy firms using 100 grid points,
44:1318:89598:24:24:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the cash grid for new-economy firms using 100 grid points.  We also scale the revenue
44:1319:89687:24:24:72:364:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:function so that the capital choice is between zero and 1.
44:1320:89745:24:24:89:539:356:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We also solve the entrant problem by value function iteration.  We discretize the signal
44:1321:89833:24:24:72:540:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:space using 100 grid points.  The lower (upper) bound of the signal grid coincides with the
44:1322:89924:24:24:72:540:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lower (upper) bound of the firm-level shock grid.  We use a discrete version of the Pareto
44:1323:90014:24:46:72:460:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:distribution to allocate the mass of potential entrants over the signal space.

44:1330:90621:24:18:72:540:87:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shock, both firms have the same investment and financing policies.  In particular, when the

45:1388:91179:159:11:72:540:354:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:The figure reports the policy functions as a function of the firm-level shock for a new-economy firm.  The left
45:1389:91290:11:12:72:540:343:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:panels depict the optimal capital choice, the middle panels depict the distributed dividends, and the right
45:1390:91397:12:12:72:540:331:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:panels depict the optimal saving policy.  The top panels report the policies for a high-cash firm (red line) and
45:1391:91509:12:11:72:540:319:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:a low-cash firm (blue line), while considering the same level of beginning-of-the-period capital stock.  The
45:1392:91617:11:12:72:540:308:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:bottom panels report the policies for a low-capital firm (red line) and a high-capital firm (blue line), while
45:1393:91727:12:53:72:327:296:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:considering the same level of beginning-of-the-period cash.
45:1394:91786:53:24:72:540:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:productivity shock is very low,  both firms find it more convenient to distribute dividends
45:1395:91877:24:24:72:540:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rather than to invest.  As the productivity increases (i.e., the shock becomes larger), in order
45:1396:91973:24:24:72:540:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to take advantage of a good state, both firms decide to reduce their dividend distributions
45:1397:92064:24:24:72:540:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and to invest more.  If the shock becomes large enough, firms save precautionarily.  Because
45:1398:92156:24:24:72:540:147:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:issuing equity is costly, firms save internal resources to avoid equity issues in the near future;
45:1399:92254:24:24:72:540:123:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that is,  they seek a reduction in their external financing costs.  If the shock is very large,
45:1400:92349:24:24:72:540:99:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:it  becomes  optimal  to  stop  saving  and  to  issue  equity  to  finance  a  larger  investment.   In
45:1401:92453:24:24:72:540:75:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the latter case, both firms have similar investment policies, but the firm with less cash has
45:1402:92546:24:0:72:540:51:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to issue more costly equity and invest slightly less compared to the firm with larger cash
46:1403:92638:0:24:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:holdings.  The difference in equity issuance is exactly equal to the cash balance differential
46:1404:92732:24:24:72:540:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:multiplied by 1 +κ(i.e.  1+ equity issuance cost).  To summarize, the three panels show that
46:1405:92824:24:24:72:540:673:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cash-rich firms have a larger amount of internal resources that allows them to (i) distribute
46:1406:92917:24:24:72:540:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more dividends when they are financially unconstrained, (ii) invest more and save more when

46:1408:93100:23:24:72:434:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:invest in excess of their internal resources, everything else being equal.
46:1409:93174:24:24:89:539:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Capital is an endogenous state variable because of capital adjustment costs.  The bottom
46:1410:93262:24:24:72:540:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:panels  of  Figure  10  show  the  policies  for  two  firms  that  only  differ  in  their  beginning-of-
46:1411:93368:24:24:72:540:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:period capital stock (i.e., size). The patterns of the investment and financing policies are very
46:1412:93465:24:24:72:540:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:similar to the ones in the top panels.  What emerges from these patterns is the importance
46:1413:93555:24:24:72:540:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of precautionary financing for small firms.  The bottom panels show that large firms have
46:1414:93644:24:24:72:540:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a  smaller  precautionary  savings  motive  because  they  rely  on  larger  expected  cash  flows,
46:1415:93743:24:24:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  for  this  reason  they  need  to  retain  less  cash  when  financing  constraints  are  binding.
46:1416:93846:24:24:72:540:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Conversely, small firms engage in larger precautionary savings, and in doing so they deliver
46:1417:93938:24:24:72:540:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a larger cash-to-assets ratio given (i) their larger amount of savings and (ii) their smaller
46:1418:94031:24:46:72:233:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:beginning-of-the-period capital.

46:1420:94073:32:23:89:539:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We simulate a panel of 40,000 firms for 300 periods to let the economy settle in the ergodic
46:1421:94165:23:24:72:540:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:state.  At each timet, a fractionλof firms exits the economy.  These firms are replaced by
46:1422:94255:24:24:72:540:237:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an equal mass of entrants in each period.  We discard the first 100 periods and calibrate the
46:1423:94348:24:24:72:233:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model using the remaining 200.

46:1426:94562:24:0:72:244:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:values across the 200 simulations.

47:1431:94888:24:24:72:540:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:B:public companies over the period 1958–2013.  What has been dubbed asthe secular increase

47:1433:95071:24:41:72:270:549:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:goes from 0.08 in 1979 to 0.25 in 2013.

47:1435:95187:24:24:72:539:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:balances documented in Table3, we followBrown and Kapadia(2007) and estimate a model
47:1436:95271:24:23:72:540:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that includes a cohort fixed effect using firms that become public from 1959 onward.  The
47:1437:95360:23:24:72:230:437:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:results are reported in Table9.
47:1438:95391:24:24:89:539:413:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:When we include cohort fixed effects, the positive trend in column I becomes not signifi-
47:1439:95480:24:24:72:540:389:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cant.  In column II, the estimates of the cohort fixed effects are differences from the excluded
47:1440:95576:24:24:72:540:365:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cohort (1974–1978), whose estimated value is given by the intercept.  Column II makes clear
47:1441:95667:24:24:72:540:341:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that no differences exist in cohort fixed effects prior to the 1979-1983 cohort, whereas starting
47:1442:95764:24:24:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with the latter cohort, the fixed effect becomes significantly bigger and its evolution mimics
47:1443:95858:24:24:72:540:293:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the evolution of the average cash holdings at entry depicted in Figure1.  In columns III and
47:1444:95950:24:24:72:540:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:IV, we separately estimate cohort fixed effects for R&D–intensive and non–R&D–intensive
47:1445:96037:24:24:72:540:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms. In both cases, no significant differences exist in cohort fixed effects among the first four
47:1446:96136:24:24:72:540:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cohorts, thus supporting the evidence in Figure2 that places the beginning of the secular
47:1447:96225:24:23:72:341:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increase in cash holdings with the 1979–1983 cohort.
47:1448:96277:23:24:89:539:174:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:By contrast, starting with the excluded cohort, the cohort fixed effects are always sig-
47:1449:96365:24:24:72:540:150:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nificantly different from the excluded cohort (the intercept) for the R&D–intensive sector.
47:1450:96456:24:24:72:540:126:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In addition, starting with the 1984-1988 cohort and up to 1999-2003 cohort the fixed effect
47:1451:96547:24:24:72:540:102:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:becomes  significantly  larger  (i.e.,  the  difference  in  the  fixed  effect  between  two  successive
47:1452:96652:24:24:72:358:78:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cohorts is positive and significantly different from zero).
47:1453:96711:24:0:89:539:54:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:On the other hand, the cohort fixed effects for the non–R&D–intensive sector (column
48:1454:96797:0:24:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:II) are significantly different from the 1974-1978 cohort only for the 1999–2003 cohort.30Dif-
48:1455:96891:24:24:71:539:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ferently from the R&D–intensive sector, only the 1984-1988 cohort fixed effect (significantly
48:1456:96984:24:24:71:539:673:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:smaller) and 1999–2003 cohort fixed effect (significantly larger) are statistically different from
48:1457:97082:24:24:71:539:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the 1979-1983 cohort fixed effect.  In addition, the magnitude of the cohort fixed effects is
48:1458:97175:24:23:71:539:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:always much smaller for the non–R&D–intensive sector, furthering the evidence of a minor
48:1459:97263:23:41:71:471:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:role played by this sector in determining the secular increase in cash holdings.

48:1464:97694:24:24:71:539:465:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:holdings due to the selection effect.  The latter quantity is split between the selection effect
48:1465:97790:24:24:71:539:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:generated by R&D–intensive firms and the selection effect generated by non-R&D–intensive

48:1494:99002:8:0:81:435:93:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:31Table11below shows the results are even robust to value-weighted cash ratios.

49:1501:99618:24:24:71:540:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of total liabilities (Compustat itemLT) and market value of equity, which is calculated as
49:1502:99708:24:24:71:540:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the product of the number of shares outstanding (Compustat itemCSHO) times the price

49:1504:99825:24:24:89:539:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:As in the equally weighted case, R&D–intensive entrants play a key role in shaping the
49:1505:99911:24:24:72:540:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time-series evolution of the value-weighted cash–to–assets ratio.  However, value weighting
49:1506:100002:24:24:72:540:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sheds a different light on the phenomenon itself. When we consider all the firms in the sample,
49:1507:100097:24:24:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the within effect and the selection effect due to R&D–intensive entrants have roughly the
49:1508:100186:24:24:72:540:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:same importance in explaining how the value-weighted cash-to-assets ratio evolves over time.
49:1509:100278:24:24:72:540:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:However, it is enough to eliminate the top 1% of the size distribution from the sample to
49:1510:100367:24:23:72:540:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:make the selection effect due to R&D–intensive entrants the most important driving force.
