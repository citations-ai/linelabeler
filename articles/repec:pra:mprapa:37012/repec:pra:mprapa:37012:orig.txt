4:72:1165:14:13:70:520:437:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Flexicurity is at the heart of European policy debates. Its aim is to overcome the tensions be-
4:73:1260:13:13:70:520:424:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:tween labour market flexibility on the one hand, and the provision of social security for work-
4:74:1355:13:13:70:524:411:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ers on the other hand. To date, there is little insight into whether flexicurity policies have 
4:75:1450:13:14:70:523:398:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:been adopted across the European Union. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to analyse to 
4:76:1540:14:13:70:520:384:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:what extent labour market policies have been reformed along the lines of the flexicurity con-
4:77:1633:13:13:70:524:371:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:cept across 18 European countries over the period 1985-2008. Focusing on the main axes of 
4:78:1723:13:14:70:524:358:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:the flexicurity concept, new datasets are used to examine changes in employment protection 
4:79:1814:14:13:70:524:344:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:legislation, unemployment benefits and active labour market policies. Data on the strictness 
4:80:1907:13:13:70:520:331:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:of employment regulation indicate that reforms have been influenced by labour market insid-
4:81:1998:13:13:70:519:318:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ers, since the level of flexibility has been increased more for temporary employment, the la-
4:82:2091:13:14:70:520:305:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:bour market outsiders, than for regular employment, the insiders. Although gross unemploy-
4:83:2181:14:13:70:524:291:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ment replacement rates suggest that unemployment benefits have become more generous, 
4:84:2266:13:13:70:527:278:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:net replacement rates indicate that the level of income security from benefits actually has 
4:85:2358:13:13:70:524:265:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:been decreased. Moreover, data illustrate that larger shares of European labour forces have 
4:86:2450:13:14:70:524:252:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:temporary contracts. As such, the gap between insiders and outsiders on the labour market 
4:87:2540:14:13:70:516:238:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:has been increased. This development is contrary to the goals of the European Commission.

6:110:3471:14:13:70:524:734:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:The flexicurity strategy is at the heart of the European debate about reforming social security. 
6:111:3568:13:13:70:524:721:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:At the European Union (EU) level, the concept is integrated in the European Employment 
6:112:3655:13:13:70:519:708:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Strategy, which is aimed at increasing employment and reducing unemployment in EU coun-
6:113:3742:13:14:70:524:695:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:tries. The European Employment Guidelines of 2001 already stated that flexibility and security 
6:114:3837:14:13:70:519:681:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:should be raised simultaneously, and flexicurity was put explicitly on the agenda of the Euro-
6:115:3931:13:13:70:520:668:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:pean Council in Brussels in 2006. In line with the Lisbon agenda, flexicurity has been pro-
6:116:4022:13:14:70:520:655:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:posed as a promising reform concept for enhancing Europe’s economic growth and social co-
6:117:4111:14:13:70:524:641:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:hesion (e.g. EC, 2006; EC, 2007a; EC, 2007b; Boeri e.a., 2007). On the one hand, more 
6:118:4197:13:13:70:524:628:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:flexible labour markets would reduce the costs of firms to adjust to the dynamics of the highly 
6:119:4293:13:13:70:524:615:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:integrated global economy, improving Europe’s competitiveness. On the other hand, increased 
6:120:4385:13:14:70:519:602:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:labour participation and higher income security would contribute to higher levels of social in-
6:121:4480:14:13:70:524:588:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:clusion. As such, flexicurity is also explicitly integrated in the Europe 2020 strategy and it is 
6:122:4578:13:13:70:520:575:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:expected to contribute to the achievement of its objectives (EC, 2010). Moreover, the flexicu-
6:123:4672:13:13:70:524:562:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:rity strategy is aimed at diminishing the segmentation of labour markets, where relatively 
6:124:4763:13:14:70:298:549:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:protected and unprotected employees coexist.  
6:125:4809:14:13:70:524:535:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Following the significant attention for flexicurity in policy debates, the amount of academic 
6:126:4903:13:13:70:524:522:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:work on this theme has also started to grow (Wilthagen and Tros, 2004; Boeri e.a., 2006; 
6:127:4992:13:14:70:524:509:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Schmid, 2006; Viebrock and Clasen, 2009). In the initial phase, the literature on flexicurity 
6:128:5086:14:13:70:523:495:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:has been mainly conceptually and theoretically oriented. Remarkably, there is relatively little 
6:129:5182:13:13:70:523:482:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:empirical research on flexicurity. Only recently, the first case studies on the adoption of 
6:130:5274:13:13:70:524:469:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:flexicurity policies have been published (e.g. Bonoli and Emmenegger, 2010). Still, besides 
6:131:5366:13:14:70:524:456:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:the typical examples of Denmark and the Netherlands, which have been extensively discussed 
6:132:5457:14:13:70:524:442:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:in the policy documents and the conceptual literature, there is little insight into what extent 
6:133:5553:13:13:70:400:429:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:flexicurity policies have been adopted in other European countries.   
6:134:5623:13:13:70:524:416:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Therefore, the aim of this paper is to analyse to what extent labour market policies in EU 
6:135:5714:13:14:70:524:403:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:countries have been reformed along the lines of the flexicurity concept. There is no universal 
6:136:5809:14:13:70:523:389:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:definition of flexicurity (Viebrock and Clasen, 2009), but two central elements of the concept 
6:137:5904:13:13:70:523:376:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:can be distilled. First, flexicurity refers to a configuration of labour market policies that aims 
6:138:6003:13:14:70:524:363:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:to complement labour market flexibility with economic security. This static conceptualisation 
6:139:6097:14:13:70:524:349:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:of flexicurity, as a state of the labour market, is discussed in section 2. Second, flexicurity 
6:140:6193:13:13:70:524:336:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:refers to a strategy to reform labour market policies. Employees with permanent contracts are 
6:141:6287:13:13:70:524:323:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:usually more protected and better organized than employees with temporary contracts. 
6:142:6372:13:14:70:520:310:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Therefore, the first group of employees, who are called insiders in the political economy litera-
6:143:6469:14:13:70:519:296:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ture, is better able to influence labour market policy reforms than the latter group, the out-
6:144:6563:13:13:70:519:283:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:siders. Since flexicurity concerns a package of policy reforms rather than a single labour mar-
6:145:6658:13:14:70:524:270:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ket policy, it is proposed to overcome opposition from insiders in policy reform processes. This 
6:146:6755:14:13:70:524:256:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:dynamic element of flexicurity will be conceptualized in section 3. In the empirical part of the 
6:147:6852:13:13:70:524:243:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:paper, section 4, labour market policies will be compared across countries and over time. The 
6:148:6946:13:13:70:524:230:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:recent publication of new data on labour market policies by the OECD (2012) and by Van Vliet 
6:149:7039:13:14:70:520:217:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:and Caminada (2012) enables us to examine whether countries have started to adopt flexicu-
6:150:7129:14:13:70:523:203:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:rity policies since the beginning of the 21st century. Building on the comparative political 
6:151:7222:13:13:70:524:190:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:economy literature on labour market policy reform, the differences in labour market policies 
6:152:7315:13:14:70:524:177:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:concerning insiders and outsiders are analysed. Many of the labour market arrangements that 
6:153:7407:14:13:70:524:163:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:are relevant for the flexicurity concept are regulated by sector specific collective agreements 
6:154:7503:13:13:70:524:150:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:(Houwing, 2010). However, because the availability of data on decentralized labour market 
6:155:7593:13:13:70:524:137:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:arrangements is too limited for the empirical approach of the paper, a comparison of 18 EU 
6:156:7684:13:14:70:524:124:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:countries for the period 1985-2008, the analysis is focused on labour market institutions 
6:157:7774:14:13:70:424:110:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:which are measured at the country level. Section 5 concludes the paper.

7:161:7917:13:14:70:73:748:9:g_d0_f18:9:g_d0_f18: 
7:162:7917:14:13:70:524:734:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:The main characteristic of flexicurity is that it is intended to overcome the tensions between 
7:163:8012:13:13:70:524:721:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:labour market flexibility on the one hand, and the provision of social security for workers on 
7:164:8107:13:13:70:524:708:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:the other hand (Viebrock and Clasen, 2009). Flexible labour markets can be seen as beneficial 
7:165:8201:13:14:70:520:695:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:for job creation, especially during periods of recovery after recessions, but they generally im-
7:166:8297:14:13:70:524:681:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ply lower levels of economic security. Welfare state programmes provide economic security, 
7:167:8388:13:13:70:524:668:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:but they can have adverse effects, such as longer unemployment spells and therefore higher 
7:168:8479:13:14:70:524:655:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:public expenditure and less mobility on the labour market. In the flexicurity concept, flexibility 
7:169:8578:14:13:70:289:641:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:and security are viewed as complementary.   
7:170:8622:13:13:70:524:628:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:In the literature, the term ‘flexicurity’ has been used to refer to different configurations of 
7:171:8718:13:13:70:524:615:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:labour market policies, in which several types and degrees of flexibility (external-numerical 
7:172:8812:13:14:70:520:602:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:and internal-numerical flexibility, functional and wage flexibility) and security (job, employ-
7:173:8907:14:13:70:524:588:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ment and income security) have been stressed (Wilthagen and Tros, 2004; Madsen, 2007; 
7:174:8993:13:13:70:524:575:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Viebrock and Clasen, 2009). This ambiguous nature of the concept has also been a source of 
7:175:9084:13:13:70:524:562:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:criticism, as different interpretations and views on labour market policies are ranked under 
7:176:9177:13:14:70:524:549:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:the concept of flexicurity (Burroni and Keune, 2011). In the often-mentioned textbook cases 
7:177:9269:14:13:70:524:535:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:of flexicurity policies, namely those in Denmark and the Netherlands, there is variation too. 
7:178:9363:13:13:70:524:522:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:The Danish model of flexicurity builds on the combination of flexible labour markets, generous 
7:179:9458:13:14:70:524:509:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:unemployment benefits and a strong emphasis on activation. This combination is known as 
7:180:9546:14:13:70:524:495:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:the ‘golden triangle’. The Dutch flexicurity model is more centred on combining non-standard 
7:181:9639:13:13:70:524:482:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:work, such as temporary agency work and part-time work, with regular social security rights 
7:182:9731:13:13:70:520:469:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:(Viebrock and Clasen, 2009). Because the Danish model is the most common example to il-
7:183:9818:13:14:70:524:456:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:lustrate the concept of flexicurity in the literature and in EU employment guidelines and policy 
7:184:9915:14:13:70:524:442:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:documents (e.g. European Commission, 2006) we focus on the labour market policies of the 
7:185:10004:13:13:70:200:429:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Danish type of flexicurity.  
7:186:10033:13:13:70:524:416:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:The Danish model is a combination of three types of labour market policies. First, employment 
7:187:10127:13:14:70:524:403:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:protection legislation (EPL) that is relatively loose provides flexibility for firms in terms of the 
7:188:10228:14:13:70:524:389:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:hiring and firing of workers. This is compensated by a rather generous social safety net for 
7:189:10321:13:13:70:520:376:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:the unemployed through unemployment benefits, which is the second element, income secu-
7:190:10408:13:14:70:524:363:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:rity. Indeed, the exchange between employment protection legislation and unemployment 
7:191:10494:14:13:70:524:349:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:benefits can be regarded as the main axis of flexicurity. Economists usually concentrate on 
7:192:10586:13:13:70:520:336:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:the trade-off between unemployment benefits and employment protection since unemploy-
7:193:10671:13:13:70:524:323:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ment benefits and employment protection could be considered as substitutes (see e.g. 
7:194:10756:13:14:70:524:310:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Blanchard and Tirole, 2004; Blanchard and Tirole, 2008; Boeri et al., 2006).1 Third, flexicurity 
7:195:10853:14:13:70:524:296:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:involves strong efforts on active labour market policies (ALMP). These policies are aimed at 
7:196:10946:13:13:70:524:283:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:increasing labour market participation through programmes such as labour market training, 
7:197:11036:13:14:70:520:270:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:services of employment agencies and subsidised employment. When low employment protec-
7:198:11122:14:13:70:523:256:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:tion leads to more dismissals, the mobility on the labour market will be greater when the 
7:199:11212:13:13:70:519:243:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:skills of the unemployed are improved by labour market training. Thus, transitions from un-
7:200:11303:13:13:70:524:230:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:employment to employment can be made easier, leading to more employment security. As a 
7:201:11390:13:14:70:524:217:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:result, job security is replaced by employment security, which is a central feature of the 
7:202:11481:14:13:70:167:203:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:flexicurity concept.  
7:203:11503:13:13:70:524:190:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Flexicurity policies are expected to improve the functioning of European labour markets, but 
7:204:11596:13:14:70:524:177:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:the effects of less employment protection, more generous unemployment benefits and higher 
7:205:11686:14:13:70:523:163:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:expenditure on ALMPs are not clear. Although high levels of employment protection lead to 
7:206:11776:13:13:70:524:150:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:slower job creation owing to higher labour costs and therefore to longer unemployment spells, 
7:207:11870:13:13:70:524:137:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:loosening employment protection may also have some drawbacks. An economic advantage of 
7:208:11957:13:14:70:524:124:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:employment protection is for instance that investments in firm-specific human capital are 
7:209:12047:14:17:70:520:110:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:higher. Another advantage is that firms internalise to some extent the external effects of un-

7:211:12189:8:13:70:524:85:5:g_d0_f19:8:g_d0_f12:1   In theory, unemployment insurance and employment protection could be considered as substitutes. We 
7:212:12292:13:31:88:470:72:8:g_d0_f12:8:g_d0_f12:realize that there are considerable differences in conditions, design and incentives in practice.

8:214:12395:0:13:70:524:761:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:employment benefits. Hence, making firing more costly to employers reduces the layoff rate 
8:215:12486:13:14:70:524:748:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:and unemployment incidence. Similarly, increases in the generosity of unemployment benefits 
8:216:12578:14:13:70:520:734:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:may also have contradictory effects (Baily, 1978). On the one hand, more generous unem-
8:217:12665:13:13:70:524:721:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ployment benefits reduce the incentive to search for new jobs and therefore lead to higher 
8:218:12756:13:13:70:524:708:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:unemployment levels. On the other hand, longer job searches may lead to better matches on 
8:219:12846:13:14:70:524:695:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:the labour market and therefore to more productive economies. With respect to ALMP, there 
8:220:12936:14:13:70:524:681:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:is a lively debate going on about the effectiveness of those programmes (Kluve, 2010; Card 
8:221:13027:13:13:70:524:668:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:et al, 2010). Positive effects on transitions from unemployment to work have been found for 
8:222:13119:13:14:70:524:655:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:employment services and private sector incentive programmes. However, even if ALMPs are 
8:223:13207:14:13:70:519:641:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:effective, it is questionable whether the benefits offset the costs, such as displacement ef-
8:224:13300:13:13:70:268:628:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:fects, lock-in effects and the tax burden.

8:230:13489:13:14:70:524:549:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:tion can be understood with the insider–outsider approach (Lindbeck and Snower, 2001), that 
8:231:13581:14:13:70:519:535:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:has gained importance in the political economy literature. In this view, a labour market con-
8:232:13674:13:13:70:524:522:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:sists of two segments. The core segment consists of insiders who are defined as incumbent 
8:233:13764:13:14:70:524:509:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:workers who enjoy more privileges than the outsiders at the margin, the rest of the labour 
8:234:13855:14:13:70:524:495:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:force. Although insiders can differ from outsiders in many ways, insiders can generally be 
8:235:13946:13:13:70:524:482:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:conceptualised as employees with permanent contracts who are labour union members, 
8:236:14029:13:13:70:524:469:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:whereas outsiders are workers with fixed-term contracts who are not represented by labour 
8:237:14119:13:14:70:519:456:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:unions.2 This disparity between insiders and outsiders exists because firms incur labour turn-
8:238:14213:14:13:70:524:442:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:over costs. These costs are the costs of hiring, firing and providing firm-specific training. It 
8:239:14310:13:13:70:524:429:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:should be noted that the firing costs are largely determined by the rigidity of the EPL. Because 
8:240:14407:13:13:70:524:416:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:of the labour turnover costs, employers give the insiders market power, that the insiders use 
8:241:14501:13:14:70:439:403:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:to get wages above the market-clearing level (Lindbeck and Snower, 2001). 
8:242:14574:14:13:70:519:389:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Insiders can be expected to object to reductions of employment protection on regular con-
8:243:14663:13:13:70:519:376:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:tracts, because that would lead to less job security for themselves. Moreover, less employ-
8:244:14754:13:14:70:520:363:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ment protection could also imply that insiders have to accept lower wages owing to less bar-
8:245:14846:14:13:70:524:349:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:gaining power in wage negotiations (Lindbeck and Snower, 2001). Hence, it could be argued 
8:246:14936:13:13:70:524:336:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:that trade unions will challenge reform proposals targeted at permanent contracts and that 
8:247:15027:13:13:70:524:323:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:they will agree with policy-makers upon making temporary contracts more flexible instead. 
8:248:15117:13:14:70:524:310:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:However, deregulation of the hiring of non-standard workers gives them a stronger position 
8:249:15208:14:13:70:524:296:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:relative to standard workers in the competition for jobs. This tends to undermine insiders’ 
8:250:15300:13:13:70:524:283:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:privileged position in terms of wages and working conditions in the long run (Eichhorst and 
8:251:15392:13:14:70:519:270:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Marx, 2011). Therefore, trade unions have a motivation to object to reforms of EPL concern-
8:252:15483:14:13:70:523:256:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ing both permanent and temporary contracts, whilst they would still prefer marginal over 
8:253:15572:13:13:70:316:243:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:general flexibilisation (Eichhorst and Marx, 2011).  
8:254:15625:13:13:70:519:230:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Empirical evidence from Allan and Scruggs (2004) indicates that corporatism is positively as-
8:255:15718:13:14:70:524:217:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:sociated with the levels of unemployment benefits. Swank (2011) examines the impact of 
8:256:15805:14:13:70:520:203:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:corporatism on the spending on unemployment benefits as well as on unemployment re-
8:257:15888:13:13:70:524:190:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:placement rates and he finds for both measures a positive impact of corporatism. Regarding 
8:258:15979:13:14:70:519:177:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ALMPs, Swank (2011) finds that political-economic institutions of (sector-) coordinated capi-
8:259:16072:14:13:70:523:163:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:talism are positively related to ALMP expenditure. In line with these results, Van Vliet and 
8:260:16165:13:13:70:524:150:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Koster (2011) find a positive effect of the presence of tripartite councils on spending on 
8:261:16256:13:25:70:524:137:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ALMPs. With respect to EPL, Emmenegger (2011) finds that a strong labour movement is a

8:263:16391:7:14:70:520:105:5:g_d0_f19:8:g_d0_f12:2   Within the group of insiders there is variation too. Pfann and Palm (1993) found that non-production work-
8:264:16501:14:9:88:524:91:8:g_d0_f12:8:g_d0_f12:ers  face  better  protection  than  production  workers  owing  to  higher  hiring  and  firing  costs  for  non-
8:265:16615:9:10:88:523:82:8:g_d0_f12:8:g_d0_f12:production workers. Pfann (2006) shows for the Netherlands that older employees with longer tenures and 
8:266:16719:10:31:88:393:72:8:g_d0_f12:8:g_d0_f12:higher wages enjoy better employment protection than other employees.

9:268:16796:0:13:70:524:761:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:determinant of high levels of EPL.3 It is not clear, however, whether this effect stems from 
9:269:16889:13:14:70:523:748:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:labour unions or from left-wing political parties, since the employed index comprises both. 
9:270:16981:14:13:70:524:734:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Rueda (2007) examined the variation in job security regulation across countries and over 
9:271:17070:13:13:70:519:721:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:time, but he did not report a clear effect of corporatism. One explanation for these mixed re-
9:272:17164:13:13:70:520:708:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:sults from an empirical viewpoint could be that these studies did not account for the differ-
9:273:17257:13:14:70:524:695:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ences in EPL regarding workers with permanent or temporary contracts. It has been well 
9:274:17344:14:13:70:524:681:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:documented that reforms aimed at flexibilisation have regularly resulted in two-tier reforms, 
9:275:17438:13:13:70:520:668:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:in which the employment protection for temporary contracts has been reduced, while the em-
9:276:17528:13:14:70:524:655:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ployment protection for permanent contracts has remained unchanged (Saint-Paul, 2004; 
9:277:17614:14:13:70:524:641:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Boeri and Garibaldi, 2007; Ochel, 2008). Since insiders are organised in trade unions that 
9:278:17705:13:13:70:523:628:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:have direct access to political decision making, for instance in bi- or tripartite councils, they 
9:279:17803:13:13:70:524:615:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:can challenge reform proposals. As a consequence, policy makers have opted for reforms of 
9:280:17893:13:14:70:301:602:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:the least organised part of the labour markets.  
9:281:17942:14:13:70:519:588:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:In contrast, flexicurity conceptualised as a strategy to reform labour market policies is sup-
9:282:18036:13:13:70:524:575:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:posed to provide a package of policy reforms for the labour market as a whole instead of only 
9:283:18130:13:13:70:524:562:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:targeted at the margin. Because the package consists of increasing flexibility and security 
9:284:18222:13:14:70:524:549:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:simultaneously, lower levels of employment protection for insiders can be compensated with 
9:285:18313:14:13:70:524:535:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:more generous unemployment benefits and higher expenditures on ALMP (EC, 2006; EC, 
9:286:18396:13:13:70:524:522:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:2007a; EC, 2007b; Boeri e.a., 2007; Wilthagen and Tros, 2004; Madsen, 2007). A reform 
9:287:18482:13:14:70:524:509:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:proposal that concerns a package of policy reforms rather than an isolated policy reform can 
9:288:18575:14:13:70:524:495:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:be expected to overcome opposition from employees in reform processes (Eichhorst and 
9:289:18660:13:13:70:520:482:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Konle-Seidl, 2005). Therefore, it can be expected that if governments have adopted the flex-
9:290:18752:13:13:70:524:469:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:icurity strategy, the strictness of the dismissal protection has been reduced, unemployment 
9:291:18844:13:14:70:520:456:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:benefits have become more generous and expenditures on ALMP have been increased. Fur-
9:292:18929:14:13:70:519:442:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:thermore, if labour market insiders have been compensated with more generous unemploy-
9:293:19015:13:13:70:524:429:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ment benefits, not only the employment protection on temporary employment but also on 
9:294:19101:13:13:70:308:416:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:regular contracts should have become less strict.

9:299:19306:13:31:88:335:72:8:g_d0_f12:8:g_d0_f12:that a strong labour movement is not a necessary condition.

10:305:19541:13:13:70:524:708:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:policies in line with the flexicurity concept. Since flexicurity is a policy concept of the EU, this 
10:306:19642:13:14:70:524:695:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:study is focused on EU member states. Subsequently, the selection of countries and years is 
10:307:19734:14:13:70:524:681:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:guided by the availability of data. Hence, the study includes 18 member states of the EU for 
10:308:19827:13:13:70:185:668:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:the period 1985-2008.  
10:309:19850:13:14:70:520:655:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:For the flexibility dimension of flexicurity, the study focuses on employment protection legisla-
10:310:19947:14:13:70:524:641:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:tion (EPL). To compare the strictness of EPL across countries and over time, the study relies 
10:311:20041:13:13:70:519:628:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:on an EPL strictness indicator that is provided by the OECD (2009). The EPL indicator is avail-
10:312:20136:13:13:70:524:615:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:able for different types of employment. Here, we use the EPL indicator for employees with a 
10:313:20228:13:14:70:524:602:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:regular contract to measure the employment protection of insiders, while the EPL indicator for 
10:314:20323:14:13:70:488:588:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:employees with a temporary contract is used to measure the protection of outsiders.4  
10:315:20409:13:13:70:524:575:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:The EPL indicator for regular contracts is an index that is calculated as a weighted average of 
10:316:20505:13:13:70:524:562:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:sub-indicators of employment regulation. The indicator covers three main areas. The first one 
10:317:20599:13:14:70:524:549:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:is the difficulty of dismissal, referring to the legislative provisions setting conditions under 
10:318:20696:14:13:70:523:535:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:which a dismissal is justified. The second area includes procedural inconveniences that an 
10:319:20787:13:13:70:519:522:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:employer may face during a dismissal process. The third category includes notice and sever-
10:320:20878:13:14:70:519:509:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ance pay provisions. The index is normalized to a scale from 0 to 6 where a higher score indi-
10:321:20972:14:13:70:519:495:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:cates stricter employment regulation. As such, the index is a comprehensive measure for in-
10:322:21063:13:13:70:524:482:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ternational comparative studies. A limitation of this indicator is that some characteristics of 
10:323:21159:13:13:70:524:469:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:EPL may be not fully reflected. For instance, since notice periods and severance pay are not 
10:324:21252:13:14:70:520:456:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:legally regulated in some countries, they might be provided by collective agreements or con-
10:325:21344:14:13:70:519:442:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:tractual extensions. Because there is no detailed information about such contractual provi-
10:326:21435:13:13:70:527:429:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:sions, the EPL index often relies on minimal requirements as provided by labour law. Another 
10:327:21528:13:13:70:524:416:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:disadvantage is the lack of incorporation of judicial practices deviating from the minimal legal 
10:328:21625:13:14:70:524:403:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:requirements (OECD, 2004). Despite these limitations, the index is a conventional summary 
10:329:21715:14:13:70:458:389:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:measure to analyse a relatively large number of countries over a longer period.  
10:330:21796:13:13:70:524:376:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Table 1 presents the index for the strictness of EPL with regard to regular employment for 18 
10:331:21890:13:14:70:524:363:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:EU countries for the period 1985-2008. In the 14 old member states of the EU, the average 
10:332:21980:14:13:70:523:349:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:strictness of employment protection slightly declined between 1985 and 2008. Germany is the 
10:333:22072:13:13:70:524:336:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:only country in which the strictness of EPL has been increased. In some countries, such as 
10:334:22163:13:13:70:524:323:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:France and Italy, EPL has not changed at all. Only five countries, namely Austria, Finland, the 
10:335:22259:13:14:70:520:310:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Netherlands, Portugal and Spain, reduced the strictness of employment protection substan-
10:336:22348:14:13:70:524:296:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:tially. However, in all of them but Finland, the level of EPL still lies above average in 2008. In 
10:337:22447:13:13:70:524:283:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:the countries that acceded the EU in 2004, the level of employment protection has not been 
10:338:22538:13:14:70:520:270:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:changed. Interestingly, the level of employment protection in the new member states is com-
10:339:22629:14:13:70:293:256:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:parable to the level in the old member states.

10:344:22936:10:10:88:524:111:8:g_d0_f12:8:g_d0_f12:missals. However, the measure with regard to collective dismissals does not reflect the overall strictness of 
10:345:23046:10:10:88:520:101:8:g_d0_f12:8:g_d0_f12:regulation applicable to collective dismissals, but refers to additional delays and procedures which go be-
10:346:23153:10:9:88:520:91:8:g_d0_f12:8:g_d0_f12:yond those applicable for individual dismissal. Hence, the measure for collective dismissals cannot be con-

11:391:25064:14:13:70:520:271:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:The strictness of EPL for temporary employment is the second indicator to measure the flexi-
11:392:25156:13:13:70:519:258:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:bility dimension of flexicurity. This indicator measures the restrictions on the hiring of tempo-
11:393:25253:13:14:70:524:245:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:rary employment by firms. It builds on a number of sub-measures (see the note under Table 
11:394:25343:14:13:70:524:231:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:2) with respect to the regulation on fixed-term contracts and temporary work agencies. Again, 
11:395:25437:13:13:70:524:218:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:the index is normalised to a scale from 0 to 6 and a higher score indicates stricter regulation. 
11:396:25534:13:13:70:524:205:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:The developments in the strictness of EPL on temporary employment are reported in Table 2. 
11:397:25625:13:14:70:524:192:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:These data indicate that the average level of EPL stringency declined relatively sharply in the 
11:398:25721:14:13:70:524:178:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:period 1985-2008 in the old EU member states, especially since the beginning of the 1990s. 
11:399:25812:13:13:70:524:165:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:In contrast to the trends in the strictness of EPL on regular employment as presented above, 
11:400:25905:13:13:70:524:152:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:most countries have reduced the strictness of EPL on temporary employment. This indicates 
11:401:25995:13:14:70:524:139:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:that governments have mainly opted for changes at the margins of the labour market in order 
11:402:26087:14:13:70:523:125:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:to increase flexibility. The sharpest decline in the strictness of the regulation of temporary 
11:403:26182:13:13:70:524:112:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:employment can be observed in Italy, indicating the deregulation of part-time employment 
11:404:26271:13:14:70:524:99:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:and the introduction of a new type of fixed-term contracts (OECD, 2004). The sharp decline in 
11:405:26365:14:44:70:524:85:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:the indicator for the Netherlands reflects the adoption of the ‘flexibility and security’ law that 
12:406:26464:44:0:288:309:41:8:g_d0_f12:8:g_d0_f12:- 7 - 
12:407:26469:0:13:70:520:761:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:increased the maximum number of successive fixed-term contracts and lengthened the maxi-
12:408:26557:13:14:70:520:748:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:mum total duration of contracts with temporary work agencies (OECD, 2004). Another inter-
12:409:26646:14:13:70:524:734:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:esting case is France. Although the French level of EPL on temporary employment was already 
12:410:26738:13:13:70:524:721:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:above average in 1985, it has been increased even further in the following years. This implies 
12:411:26833:13:13:70:524:708:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:that the French labour market policies have not become more flexible at all, since the EPL on 
12:412:26927:13:14:70:519:695:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:regular employment remained constant. Remarkably, the level of EPL on temporary employ-
12:413:27014:14:13:70:524:681:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ment has increased in three of the four new member states included. It only declined in the 
12:414:27106:13:13:70:524:668:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Slovak Republic. The average level is lower in the new member states than in the old member 
12:415:27198:13:14:70:524:655:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:states, which implies that there seems to be some convergence between the old and new 
12:416:27284:14:13:70:149:641:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:member states.

12:464:29222:14:36:70:523:77:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:income security. Naturally, not only the level, but also the duration of entitlement rights is

13:466:29322:0:13:70:520:761:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:relevant to indicate the generosity of unemployment benefits. However, because of the lim-
13:467:29412:13:14:70:524:748:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ited data availability, the duration is not included in this study. Earlier research shows that 
13:468:29508:14:13:70:524:734:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:most countries had not changed the duration of entitlement rights in the period 1995-2002 
13:469:29598:13:13:70:524:721:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:(Van Vliet, 2010). For gross unemployment replacement rates the study relies on OECD 
13:470:29683:13:13:70:524:708:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:(2010b) data. This measure indicates the level of gross unemployment benefits as percentage 
13:471:29775:13:14:70:524:695:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:of previous gross income from work. The replacement rate is calculated as an unweighted

13:473:29953:13:13:70:179:668:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:and household types.  
13:474:29975:13:14:70:524:655:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Table 3 shows that gross unemployment benefits increased on average by 2.9 percentage 
13:475:30061:14:13:70:524:641:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:points in the 14 old member states of the EU between 1985 and 2007. The increase was even 
13:476:30151:13:13:70:524:628:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:larger in the first half of this period, but some countries reduced the benefit level after 2001. 
13:477:30249:13:13:70:520:615:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:The generosity of replacement rates in the new member sates is lower than in the old mem-
13:478:30338:13:14:70:520:602:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ber states. This partly causes the decline in the mean of the 18 EU countries from 2001 on-
13:479:30429:14:13:70:520:588:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:wards. The increase in the benefit level in the old member states indicates that income secu-
13:480:30522:13:13:70:519:575:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:rity has increased, which is in line with the concept of flexicurity. Especially the Southern wel-
13:481:30620:13:13:70:523:562:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:fare states Greece, Italy and Portugal, with rather low levels of replacement rates in 1985, 
13:482:30713:13:14:70:527:549:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:caught up rapidly. As was the case with EPL for temporary employment, France shows a 
13:483:30798:14:13:70:524:535:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:strong increase in the level of unemployment benefits. The sharpest decline in the level of 
13:484:30890:13:13:70:519:522:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:unemployment benefits was in the Netherlands, owing to reforms of the unemployment bene-

14:525:32978:0:13:70:524:761:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Despite the fact that the gross unemployment replacement is a conventional measure in the 
14:526:33068:13:14:70:520:748:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:comparative welfare state literature, it can only be seen as a limited indicator of the generos-
14:527:33164:14:13:70:524:734:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ity of benefit systems for unemployed people (Whiteford, 1995). First, because of differences 
14:528:33258:13:13:70:524:721:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:in taxation of unemployment benefits, gross replacement rates are difficult to compare across 
14:529:33352:13:13:70:524:708:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:countries. Second, gross replacement rates only represent unemployment benefits instead of 
14:530:33443:13:14:70:524:695:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:all the benefits unemployed people are entitled to, such as family benefits. Therefore, we also 
14:531:33539:14:13:70:519:681:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:use an indicator that takes these shortcomings into account: the net unemployment replace-
14:532:33629:13:13:70:524:668:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ment rate, taken from Van Vliet and Caminada (2012) who updated Scruggs’ (2005) Welfare 
14:533:33717:13:14:70:523:655:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:State Entitlements Data Set. The net unemployment replacement rate is the ratio of the net 
14:534:33808:14:13:70:524:641:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:income from unemployment benefits to the net income from work. The measure indicates the 
14:535:33897:13:13:70:524:628:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:generosity of unemployment benefits in the initial phase of unemployment and it is based on 
14:536:33989:13:13:70:523:615:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:the wage level of an average production worker.5 Here, we employ the unweighted average of 
14:537:34080:13:14:70:524:602:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:the replacement rates of two household situations, namely single persons and one earner 
14:538:34168:14:13:70:201:588:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:couples with two children.  
14:539:34196:13:13:70:524:575:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Net unemployment replacement rates are presented in Table 4. These data indicate that the 
14:540:34286:13:13:70:524:562:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:net level of unemployment benefits has been decreased in most of the European countries. 
14:541:34375:13:14:70:519:549:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Interestingly, this trend is neither in line with the increase of the generosity of the gross un-
14:542:34472:14:13:70:524:535:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:employment benefits, nor with the concept of flexicurity. Only in Italy the net replacement 
14:543:34564:13:13:70:524:522:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:rates increased substantially. In line with the stricter EPL and the higher gross benefits, also 
14:544:34661:13:14:70:524:509:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:the net benefit level has been increased in France. In Ireland, the net replacement rate is 
14:545:34753:14:13:70:509:495:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:lower in 2008 than in 1985, but from 2000 onwards, the benefit level has been increased.  
14:546:34843:13:13:70:524:482:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Furthermore, the levels of the net replacement rates are obviously higher than the levels of 
14:547:34936:13:13:70:524:469:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:the gross replacement rates, which indicates that income taxes are lower and other social 
14:548:35026:13:14:70:520:456:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:benefits are more generous for the unemployed. However, it should be noted that the differ-
14:549:35117:14:13:70:524:442:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ence between gross and net can also be partly explained by the fact that the net replacement 
14:550:35210:13:13:70:524:429:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:rates only refer to the first year of unemployment, whereas the gross replacement rates refer 
14:551:35304:13:13:70:527:416:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:to a five year unemployment spell. In most countries, the level of unemployment benefits 
14:552:35393:13:242:70:310:403:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:decreases when unemployment spells are longer.

14:554:35488:8:13:70:524:153:5:g_d0_f19:8:g_d0_f12:5   The OECD has made a fundamental change in the approach of the average wages. The classical approach 
14:555:35592:13:10:88:520:140:8:g_d0_f12:8:g_d0_f12:of calculating the average wage was based on the average wage of a production worker (APW), which re-
14:556:35693:10:9:88:523:130:8:g_d0_f12:8:g_d0_f12:fers to the wage level in the manufacturing industry. The new concept for the average wage refers to the 
14:557:35798:9:10:88:524:121:8:g_d0_f12:8:g_d0_f12:average worker wage (AW), which includes much more sectors. The differences in the levels of the APW

17:685:43592:0:13:70:524:761:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:gross unemployment benefits and ALMP expenditure. However, the net replacement rates 
17:686:43677:13:14:70:524:748:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:indicate that the unemployment benefits have in fact become less generous. This raises the 
17:687:43768:14:13:70:524:734:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:question why the reform of the Austrian EPL has actually been successful, since it is unlikely 
17:688:43863:13:13:70:524:721:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:that employees accept lower unemployment benefits and more flexible EPL in exchange for 
17:689:43951:13:13:70:519:708:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:higher ALMP expenditure. In 2002, a new severance pay law was adopted. The new law re-
17:690:44037:13:14:70:524:695:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:placed a conventional severance payments system with an individual and portable savings 
17:691:44125:14:13:70:519:681:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:accounts system that is funded by employers via a monthly payment. In the case of dis-
17:692:44211:13:13:70:524:668:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:missal, an employee has the choice of either receiving severance payment drawn from his 
17:693:44299:13:14:70:520:655:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:savings account or taking his accumulated balance to the next job. At retirement, the em-
17:694:44388:14:13:70:524:641:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ployee can get a cash payment or convert his entitlements into an annuity (Hofer, 2007: 41). 
17:695:44481:13:13:70:520:628:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:The reform is based on a compromise between the social partners. For employers the advan-
17:696:44570:13:13:70:524:615:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:tage of the new system is that there is no uncertainty regarding the costs of dismissal, which 
17:697:44665:13:14:70:520:602:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:are lower than in the old system, because they are known at the time of hiring. For employ-
17:698:44756:14:13:70:524:588:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ees, job mobility costs are lower because they do not lose their entitlement to severance 
17:699:44846:13:13:70:519:575:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:payment when quitting a job, as was the case in the old system (Hofer, 2007: 46). Interest-
17:700:44937:13:13:70:524:562:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ingly, by reforming EPL rather than plainly reducing dismissal protection, the social partners 
17:701:45032:13:14:70:523:549:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:were able to come up with a proposal to enhance external flexibility that was acceptable for 
17:702:45125:14:13:70:142:535:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:the insiders.    
17:703:45142:13:13:70:519:522:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:The Danish policies are interesting as well, since these are often mentioned as a typical ex-
17:704:45235:13:14:70:524:509:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ample of flexicurity. Indeed, the strictness of EPL on regular employment has been below the 
17:705:45328:14:13:70:523:495:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:mean level during the whole period and the unemployment benefits system is one of the most 
17:706:45419:13:13:70:524:482:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:generous systems in the EU. However, this configuration of complementary labour market 
17:707:45506:13:13:70:524:469:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:policies has emerged in the course of quite a long period, rather than being the result of an 
17:708:45600:13:14:70:524:456:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:explicit reform strategy to increase flexibility and security simultaneously that was designed 
17:709:45695:14:13:70:524:442:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:on the drawing board (Burroni and Keune, 2011). Moreover, as the data show, the direction 
17:710:45785:13:13:70:519:429:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:of the policy changes is not in line with the principles of the flexicurity concept, as the unem-
17:711:45882:13:13:70:523:416:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ployment benefits have become less generous and the flexibility of the labour market was 
17:712:45971:13:14:70:524:403:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:only slightly extended, holding the protection of regular employment unchanged. However, 
17:713:46060:14:13:70:523:389:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:the efforts on active labour market policies have actually been increased in Denmark, which is 
17:714:46155:13:13:70:242:376:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:in line with the flexicurity concept.  
17:715:46194:13:14:70:524:363:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Interestingly, the results indicate further that most countries have opted for a reduction of the 
17:716:46292:14:13:70:524:349:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:EPL on temporary employment instead of changing the protection of regular employment. In 
17:717:46381:13:13:70:527:336:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:seven countries – Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands and Sweden – 
17:718:46466:13:13:70:524:323:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:employment protection has been reduced for temporary workers, while it remained constant 
17:719:46555:13:14:70:528:310:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:for regular workers. In Germany, the employment protection for regular workers has even 
17:720:46643:14:13:70:519:296:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:increased. This disparity between the reforms of regulation of regular and temporary em-
17:721:46731:13:13:70:524:283:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ployment contracts indicates that governments have applied two tier reforms rather than the 
17:722:46823:13:14:70:524:270:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:flexicurity strategy, which may be owing to the influence of insiders. In Italy for instance, 
17:723:46917:14:13:70:524:256:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:labour law reforms included the deregulation of part-time employment and the introduction of 
17:724:47010:13:13:70:524:243:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:project-based contracts, a new type of fixed-term contracts. These changes at the margins of 
17:725:47103:13:13:70:524:230:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:the labour market are the result of the fact that the trade unions have successfully challenged 
17:726:47199:13:14:70:523:217:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:attempts to introduce more flexibility for insiders, whereas outsiders were not represented in 
17:727:47294:14:13:70:498:203:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:the negotiations between employers and trade unions (Bonoli and Emmenegger, 2010).

17:731:47498:13:13:70:523:150:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ular and temporary employment has been increased in Europe. However, the magnitude of

17:733:47674:13:14:70:520:124:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:protection also depends on the relative size of the group of employees with temporary con-
17:734:47764:14:13:70:524:110:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:tracts. When more and more employees have a regular open-ended contract, deregulation of 
17:735:47853:13:13:70:524:97:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:temporary employment would not necessarily imply more inequality on the labour market as 
17:736:47942:13:43:70:523:84:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:a whole. Table 6 presents the development of the number of employees with a temporary

18:739:48126:13:14:70:519:748:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:vey (Eurostat 2010). There is considerable variation across the countries. In 2008, for in-
18:740:48217:14:13:70:524:734:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:stance, 29.3 percent of the Spanish employees worked on a temporary contract, while this 
18:741:48306:13:13:70:523:721:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:was only 4.5 percent in the United Kingdom. In three of the four new member states, the 
18:742:48394:13:13:70:524:708:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:share of temporary employees is lower than the average level of the old member states. The 
18:743:48485:13:14:70:524:695:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:exception is Poland, that is with 26.9 percent the second highest of the whole country group. 
18:744:48579:14:13:70:524:681:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:More important, the table shows that the share of temporary employees has increased in the 
18:745:48670:13:13:70:524:668:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:EU countries. Among the old member states, the sharpest increase can be observed in the 
18:746:48758:13:14:70:524:655:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Netherlands, from 10.8 percent in 1995 to 17.9 percent in 2008. This is probably partly due 
18:747:48850:14:13:70:523:641:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:to the fact that the EPL on temporary contracts has been reduced more than the EPL on open-
18:748:48941:13:13:70:520:628:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ended contracts. On average, the share of temporary employees rose by almost two percent-
18:749:49030:13:13:70:520:615:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:age points in the old member states between 1995 (the first data year for which the observa-

18:751:49214:14:13:70:524:588:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:above presented trend in the EPL on temporary employment, there are more employees with 
18:752:49302:13:13:70:295:575:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:a temporary contract enjoying less protection.

19:791:50805:0:13:70:232:761:9:g_d0_f18:9:g_d0_f18:5. Discussion and conclusions 
19:792:50835:13:14:70:73:748:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16: 
19:793:50835:14:13:70:524:734:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:The concept of flexicurity has gained importance in the European policy debates since the 
19:794:50925:13:13:70:524:721:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:beginning of the twenty-first century. In contrast, the presented data show that the labour 
19:795:51017:13:13:70:519:708:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:market policies across the EU have not been reformed along the lines of the flexicurity con-
19:796:51109:13:14:70:524:695:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:cept. The strictness of employment protection has been decreased on average between 1985 
19:797:51198:14:13:70:523:681:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:and 2008, but the disparity between insiders and outsiders has actually become larger. The 
19:798:51289:13:13:70:519:668:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:data show that most countries have increased labour market flexibility by reducing employ-
19:799:51379:13:14:70:524:655:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ment protection on temporary employment more than employment protection on regular 
19:800:51462:14:13:70:519:641:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:open-ended contracts. In addition, since firms have hired relatively more temporary employ-
19:801:51553:13:13:70:519:628:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:ees, larger shares of European labour forces have a temporary contract. The inequality be-
19:802:51643:13:13:70:524:615:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:tween insiders and outsiders on the labour market has been illustrated by the consequences 
19:803:51734:13:14:70:524:602:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:of the financial crisis around 2009. When firms started to reduce their production capacity in 
19:804:51829:14:13:70:520:588:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:reaction to the recession, the temporary employees were the first to be dismissed. As a re-
19:805:51920:13:13:70:524:575:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:sult, the rising unemployment figures across the EU are overrepresented by former temporary 
19:806:52012:13:13:70:207:562:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:employees (OECD, 2010a).  
19:807:52038:13:14:70:524:549:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Furthermore, whereas most of the existing literature on labour market institutions is mainly 
19:808:52131:14:13:70:524:535:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:focused on West European countries, this study also includes a number of Central and East 
19:809:52221:13:13:70:524:522:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:European countries. Interestingly, the levels of protection on regular employment in the new 
19:810:52314:13:14:70:524:509:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:EU member states are comparable to the protection levels in the old member states. This is 
19:811:52405:14:13:70:524:495:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:remarkable, since labour market and social policies in the new member states usually differ 
19:812:52497:13:13:70:520:482:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:strongly from the old member states (Draxler and Van Vliet, 2010). Naturally, these observa-
19:813:52589:13:13:70:508:469:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:tions should be interpreted with caution, since only four new member states are included.  
19:814:52680:13:14:70:520:456:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:The differences in the reforms of employment protection on temporary and permanent con-
19:815:52767:14:13:70:524:442:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:tracts are probably owing to the role of insiders in policy making processes. Responding to 
19:816:52859:13:13:70:519:429:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:pressure from internationalisation and labour market performance, governments have at-
19:817:52945:13:13:70:524:416:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:tempted to introduce elements of flexibility. Since trade unions have successfully challenged 
19:818:53039:13:14:70:524:403:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:such attempts, governments have opted for reforms at the margins of the labour market. Yet, 
19:819:53131:14:13:70:520:389:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:the flexicurity strategy is aimed at providing reform packages that could compensate the re-
19:820:53223:13:13:70:524:376:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:duced employment protection of insiders. A tentative explanation for the limited success of 
19:821:53315:13:14:70:519:363:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:this strategy is that the second element of the flexicurity concept, an increase in income secu-
19:822:53411:14:13:70:520:349:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:rity, has not been implemented either. The developments in the gross unemployment re-
19:823:53496:13:13:70:524:336:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:placement rates suggest that unemployment benefits have become more generous, whilst the 
19:824:53585:13:13:70:519:323:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:net replacement rates indicate that when taxes and other benefit schemes are taken into ac-
19:825:53676:13:14:70:524:310:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:count, the income security for the unemployed has actually been decreased. Consequently, 
19:826:53765:14:13:70:524:296:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:insiders have not been compensated sufficiently for reductions in dismissal protection, even 
19:827:53858:13:13:70:345:283:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:though the expenditures on ALMPs have been increased. 
19:828:53912:13:14:70:524:270:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Hitherto, flexicurity has not been a very effective strategy to reform labour market policies. 
19:829:54007:14:13:70:524:256:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:However, it looks as if other reform trajectories are taking place instead. They proceed mostly 
19:830:54103:13:13:70:524:243:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:incrementally and they may vary across countries, but in the end, the outcomes could be 
19:831:54191:13:13:70:523:230:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:comparable to the aims of the flexicurity strategy. When asymmetrical labour market reforms 
19:832:54283:13:14:70:524:217:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:lead to the situation that the share of temporary employees grows because they become 
19:833:54369:14:13:70:524:203:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:more attractive for firms, the position of insiders tends to be undermined. Hence, reforms at 
19:834:54463:13:13:70:524:190:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:the margin could trigger wage competition between labour market segments, resulting in 
19:835:54550:13:14:70:524:177:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:greater general flexibility. In Germany for example, trade unions responded to the threat of 
19:836:54643:14:13:70:524:163:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:being crowded out by advocating more internal flexibility (Eichhorst and Marx, 2011: 85). 
19:837:54733:13:13:70:524:150:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Another result of the growth of non-standard jobs could be that outsiders get better organized 
19:838:54828:13:13:70:523:137:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:in new labour unions. These unions will claim stronger positions in central confederations and 
19:839:54923:13:14:70:523:124:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:in tripartite institutions. New constellations in the industrial relations lead to other labour 
19:840:55019:14:13:70:524:110:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:market policy reforms, resulting in smaller differences in employment protection between 
19:841:55108:13:13:70:524:97:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:regular and temporary employment. In addition, larger fractions of the workforce consisting of 
19:842:55203:13:43:70:524:84:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:temporary employees may also have political consequences. When the composition of the

20:844:55295:0:13:70:520:761:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:electorate changes, the attitude of the electorate towards more flexible employment regula-
20:845:55386:13:14:70:524:748:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:tion may become more positive which makes it more likely that politicians will adopt reforms 
20:846:55479:14:13:70:519:734:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:(Saint-Paul, 2004). Political support for reforming EPL on permanent contracts could be ex-
20:847:55570:13:13:70:450:721:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:pected in countries with many temporary contracts, such as Spain and Poland. 
20:848:55647:13:13:70:519:708:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:In summary, European labour market policy reforms are generally not in line with the flexicu-
20:849:55740:13:14:70:524:695:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:rity concept but haven been focused at the margins. These two-tier reforms and the growing 
20:850:55831:14:13:70:524:681:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:number of temporary employees could enhance more general labour market flexibility in the 
20:851:55921:13:13:70:524:668:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:long run, but they imply larger gaps between insiders and outsiders in the short run. This 
20:852:56012:13:14:70:524:655:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:increased inequality between insiders and outsiders is contrary to the goals of the European 
20:853:56105:14:13:70:524:641:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:Commission. Yet, the Austrian case illustrates that attempts to introduce more flexibility 
20:854:56196:13:13:70:524:628:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:which entail reforming rather than simply reducing employment protection can be successful 
20:855:56287:13:574:70:170:615:9:g_d0_f16:9:g_d0_f16:in the short run too.
