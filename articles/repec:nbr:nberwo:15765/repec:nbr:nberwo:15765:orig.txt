2:25:1002:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:This paper uses data from the Mexican Family Life Survey (MxFLS) to examine the patterns of selection
2:26:1103:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:of male, Mexican migrants to the United States. We confirm previous findings that Mexican migrants
2:27:1201:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:are selected from the middle of the education distribution, but show that there is no evidence for selection
2:28:1309:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:of migrants on cognitive ability. We demonstrate that migrants are also selected from the middle of
2:29:1408:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:the observed skill distribution, as measured by predicted wages. However, controlling for proxies of
2:30:1508:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:the costs of migration, we find substantially less evidence of "intermediate selection" on observed
2:31:1607:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:skill. We find little evidence for selection on unobserved skill, with or without controls for the costs
2:32:1711:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:of migration. Finally, we show directly that the decision to migrate is highly correlated with differential
2:33:1818:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:returns to observable skill and the costs of migration. Overall, these findings are consistent with the
2:34:1921:14:42:72:304:462:12:Times:12:Times:predictions of the canonical model of migration.

3:49:2263:0:35:72:185:709:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:1  Introduction
3:50:2278:35:24:72:540:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Mexican immigrants account for a third of all foreign born residents in the United States and are the
3:51:2379:24:23:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:fastest growing immigrant group. In 2008, it is estimated that 12.7 million Mexican immigrants lived
3:52:2479:23:24:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the U.S. and this Ögure represents approximately 4 percent of the U.S. population and 11 percent
3:53:2578:24:24:72:540:603:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of Mexicoís population.1Understanding the pattern of self-selection among Mexican immigrants
3:54:2670:24:24:71:539:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to the United States is relevant for both research and policy.  Given the magnitudes involved,
3:55:2764:24:23:71:539:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:selective migration out of Mexico may have large e§ects on the Mexican labor force. If migrants
3:56:2859:23:24:71:539:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are negatively selected on skills (i.e., come from the lower end of the skill distribution), then this
3:57:2961:24:24:71:539:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:will tend to reduce the relative scarcity of high skilled labor and reduce earnings disparities between
3:58:3064:24:23:71:539:484:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:high and low-skilled workers in Mexico. Positive selection of migrants would have opposite e§ects.
3:59:3162:23:24:71:539:461:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The skill-composition of Mexican immigrants in the United States also has important implications
3:60:3258:24:24:71:539:437:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for U.S. labor market and immigration policy. Negative selection of Mexican immigrants will tend
3:61:3354:24:24:71:539:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to reduce the wages of low-skilled native-born persons and exacerbate earnings inequality, although
3:62:3453:24:23:71:539:389:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the evidence in support of this hypothesis remains controversial (Borjas, Katz and Freeman, 1996;
3:63:3550:23:24:71:539:366:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Lalonde and Topel, 1997; Borjas, 2003; Card, 2005). Finally, studying the pattern of self-selection
3:64:3649:24:24:71:539:342:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:from Mexico can serve as a useful test of Borjasís (1987) canonical model of migration.  Given
3:65:3743:24:23:71:539:318:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the documented higher returns to schooling and greater dispersion of wages in Mexico than in
3:66:3835:23:24:71:539:295:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the United States, Borjasítheory predicts that Mexican migrants to the United States would be
3:67:3928:24:24:71:539:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:less-skilled than their counterparts who remain in Mexico. However, this prediction has not always
3:68:4026:24:23:71:346:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:been supported by empirical evidence in previous studies.
3:69:4083:23:24:88:539:224:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This paper uses data from the Mexican Family Life Survey (MxFLS) to examine the nature
3:70:4169:24:24:71:539:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of selection of Mexican migrants to the United States.  The MxFLS is ideally suited to study
3:71:4261:24:24:71:539:176:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the pattern of selection of migrants. The 2002 baseline survey of the MxFLS contains detailed,
3:72:4355:24:23:71:539:152:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:individual-level information on education, labor market participation and earnings, past migration
3:73:4453:23:26:71:539:129:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:experience, migration networks, credit availability, assets, and cognitive ability for a nationally

4:76:4728:0:24:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:representative sample of Mexicans. Most important, there is information about whether individuals
4:77:4825:24:24:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:migrated to the United States by the time of the second round survey in 2006. Thus, we observe
4:78:4919:24:24:72:540:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings, education, and other components of labor market skills for both migrants and non-
4:79:5010:24:23:72:540:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:migrants prior to their migration from Mexico to the United States. Using the MxFLS enables us
4:80:5104:23:24:72:540:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to address many of the data limitations that have plagued earlier studies. For example, studies that
4:81:5204:24:24:72:540:590:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:used the U.S. Census may miss many Mexican migrants because of the undercounting of immigrants,
4:82:5299:24:23:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and these studies may overstate the education of migrants if immigrants obtain additional schooling
4:83:5398:23:24:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:after arrival in the U.S. Other studies that have used Mexican surveys generally miss individuals
4:84:5495:24:24:72:540:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in households in which all members have migrated to the United States. Furthermore, the MxFLS
4:85:5588:24:24:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:provides information on aspects of skills such as cognitive ability that are usually unmeasured, as
4:86:5687:24:23:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:well as a rich set of individual and household characteristics that can help control for other potential
4:87:5791:23:24:72:346:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:costs and beneÖts associated with the migration decision.
4:88:5848:24:24:88:539:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We Önd, in line with the previous literature, that Mexican migrants are selected from the middle
4:89:5944:24:23:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the education distribution, or what has been referred to as ìintermediateîselection. However,
4:90:6040:23:24:72:540:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:there is no evidence for selection on another dimension of skill, namely cognitive ability. We also
4:91:6139:24:24:72:540:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:demonstrate that migrants are selected from the middle of the distribution of observed skills, as
4:92:6236:24:24:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:measured by predicted wages. In contrast, we Önd little consistent evidence of selection of migrants
4:93:6336:24:23:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on unobserved skill. Our Öndings are quite di§erent once we control for proxy variables for the
4:94:6431:23:24:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:costs of migration. In this case, estimates suggest no signiÖcant selection of migrants on observed
4:95:6530:24:24:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:skill, although estimates are somewhat imprecise. The substantial change in the pattern of selection
4:96:6630:24:23:72:540:234:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:when these controls for the costs of migration are included raises the possibility that analyses with
4:97:6731:23:24:72:540:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:more complete controls would yield evidence of negative selection. With respect to unobserved
4:98:6824:24:24:72:540:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:skill, adding controls for the costs of migration has little e§ect on estimates, and estimates suggest
4:99:6926:24:24:72:278:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:essentially no selection on unobserved skill.
4:100:6971:24:23:88:539:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Finally, we present direct evidence to support the canonical model of migration (Borjas, 1987).
4:101:7066:23:24:72:540:116:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We Önd that Mexican males are more likely to migrate to the U.S. when the return to observed
4:102:7158:24:0:72:540:92:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:skill is larger in the U.S. than in Mexico in ways consistent with theory. In addition, we show that
5:103:7259:0:24:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:proxy variables for the cost of migration are strongly correlated with the probability of migrating
5:104:7358:24:24:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and correlated with observed skill; controlling for these costs diminishes, even eliminates, evidence
5:105:7459:24:24:72:367:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of selection from the middle of the observed skill distribution.
5:106:7523:24:23:88:539:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the related literature on the self-selection
5:107:7620:23:24:72:540:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of Mexican migrants. Section 3 outlines a simple model of migration in which mobility costs are
5:108:7715:24:24:72:540:590:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:allowed to vary with schooling and with unobserved skills. Section 4 describes the data from the
5:109:7811:24:23:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Mexican Family Life Survey and the empirical strategy. Section 5 presents our Öndings on the
5:110:7903:23:24:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:selection of migrants by observed and unobserved skills. Section 6 discusses these results in light
5:111:8002:24:48:72:290:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of previous research, and Section 7 concludes.
5:112:8048:48:34:72:227:471:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:2  Related Literature
5:113:8069:34:24:72:540:437:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:There are only a few papers that have examined the pattern of selection on skills among Mexican
5:114:8164:24:24:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:immigrants to the United States. Chiquiar and Hanson (2005) used the 1990 and 2000 Mexican
5:115:8254:24:24:72:540:389:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and U.S. Censuses to evaluate the selection of Mexican immigrants in terms of observable skills and
5:116:8353:24:23:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:found evidence of ìintermediateîselection, which is inconsistent with Borjasís model given what is
5:117:8451:23:24:72:540:342:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:known about the returns to education in Mexico and the U.S.2Chiquiar and Hanson (2005) Örst

5:119:8636:24:23:71:539:294:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Census, and showed that Mexican immigrants in the United States are drawn from the middle of
5:120:8728:23:24:71:539:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the Mexican education distribution. Next, they compared the (predicted) wage distribution for
5:121:8821:24:24:71:539:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:residents of Mexico with the (predicted) wage distribution of Mexican immigrants in the United
5:122:8915:24:24:71:539:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:States had they been paid according to the skills prices in Mexico. Wages were predicted using
5:123:9009:24:23:71:539:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:age, education, and marital status and used as a proxies for observed skill. As with education,
5:124:9104:23:24:71:539:176:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:they found that migrants are concentrated in the middle of Mexicoís (predicted) observed skill
5:125:9198:24:24:71:130:152:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:distribution.

5:129:9525:11:0:72:540:77:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:1970, 1990, 2000). Feliciano only examined mean di§erences and not di§erences in the entire education distribution.
6:130:9641:0:24:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Hanson (2005): the likely undercount of immigrants in the U.S. Census; the possibility that Mexican
6:131:9740:24:24:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:immigrants can obtain additional schooling after arriving in the United States; return migration;
6:132:9837:24:24:72:540:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and the likelihood that unobservable characteristics are correlated with education. Results remained
6:133:9937:24:23:72:540:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:relatively unchanged after addressing these potential problems, but despite their comprehensive
6:134:10032:23:24:72:361:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:assessments, these concerns cannot be completely alleviated.
6:135:10092:24:24:88:539:590:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Ibarraran and Lubotsky (2007) used the 2000 Mexican Census to estimate di§erences in the
6:136:10180:24:23:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:educational attainment between migrants and non-migrants. They replicated Chiquiar and Han-
6:137:10271:23:24:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sonís (2005) Önding that Mexican immigrants in the 2000 U.S. Census have more education (and
6:138:10363:24:24:72:540:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are older) than non-migrants in the Mexican Census. However, they further investigated potential
6:139:10459:24:24:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:over-reporting of education by migrants and undercounting of younger migrants in the U.S. Census.
6:140:10556:24:23:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Ibarraran and Lubotsky (2007) exploited the fact that, in the Mexican Census, heads of households
6:141:10653:23:24:72:540:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:were asked to list current or past household members who had lived abroad during the preceding
6:142:10747:24:24:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Öve years. Unfortunately, the heads of household only reported a limited set of individual charac-
6:143:10845:24:23:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:teristics: age, gender, Mexican state of origin, and migration patterns. Since no information about
6:144:10944:23:24:72:540:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:educational attainment of migrants was available, the authors used measured characteristics to
6:145:11038:24:24:72:540:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:predict educational attainment. In contrast to Chiquiar and Hanson (2005), they found evidence
6:146:11132:24:24:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of negative selection on education; low-educated Mexicans were more likely than high-educated
6:147:11225:24:23:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Mexicans to migrate to the United States, and the degree of negative selection was larger in regions
6:148:11325:23:24:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with higher returns to schooling. However, this approach is based on the assumption that there
6:149:11419:24:24:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are no di§erences between migrants and non-migrants beyond those measured by the limited set of
6:150:11514:24:23:72:268:234:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:characteristics used to predict education.
6:151:11556:23:24:88:539:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Fern·ndez-Huertas Moraga (2008) used data from the Encuesta Nacional de Empleo Trimestral
6:152:11645:24:24:72:540:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(ENET) survey to overcome some of the limitations associated with using Census data. The ENET
6:153:11738:24:24:72:540:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:survey follows households for Öve consecutive quarters and includes reports on whether any house-
6:154:11835:24:23:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:hold member has left for the United States. Consequently, it is possible to examine the selectivity of
6:155:11937:23:24:72:540:116:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:migrants on their education attainment and actual earnings prior to migration. Fern·ndez-Huertas
6:156:12033:24:0:72:540:92:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Moraga found negative selection on wages and ìintermediate to negative selectionî on education
7:157:12128:0:24:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for men aged 16 to 65. The ENET is not subject to the problems of undercounting of migrants
7:158:12219:24:24:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and over-reporting of migrant educational attainment that are present in U.S. Census. However,
7:159:12313:24:24:72:540:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:this approach misses persons in households in which all members have migrated to the United
7:160:12404:24:23:72:539:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:States.3Furthermore, as we discuss later, the inclusion of younger men aged 16 to 20 is potentially
7:161:12503:23:24:72:536:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:problematic given their low rates of labor market participation and lack of information on wages.
7:162:12600:24:24:88:539:590:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Orrenius and Zavodny (2005) used data from the Mexican Migration Project (MMP) to examine
7:163:12689:24:23:72:539:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:how various factors ináuence the selectivity of undocumented migrants over time.4They found that
7:164:12785:23:24:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:migrants were drawn from the middle of the education distribution. They did not examine other
7:165:12878:24:24:72:540:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:measures of skill.  While the MMP includes both migrants and non-migrants living in Mexico,
7:166:12969:24:24:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:it does not include Mexican-born household heads who have migrated to the U.S. permanently.
7:167:13060:24:23:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Furthermore, the data from the MMP are collected retrospectively, which may result in recall bias.
7:168:13158:23:24:88:539:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Finally, McKenzie and Rapoport (2007) used data from the 1997 Encuesta Nacional de la
7:169:13243:24:24:72:539:424:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:Din·mica Demogr·Öca (ENADID) survey to examine selection of Mexican migrants on education.5
7:170:13334:24:23:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The survey has information on migrants in the U.S. who have a (coresident) family member living
7:171:13429:23:24:72:540:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in Mexico but misses migrants who have permanently left Mexico and who do not have family
7:172:13518:24:24:72:540:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:member that remained in Mexico. The main contribution of McKenzie and Rapoport (2007) was
7:173:13607:24:24:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:incorporating the migration history of the community, as a measure of the cost of migration, into
7:174:13704:24:23:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the analysis. McKenzie and Rapoport (2007) reported that migrants are negatively selected on
7:175:13796:23:24:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:education in communities that have a high proportion of persons who migrated, but that selection
7:176:13892:24:24:72:460:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on education is positive in communities that do not have high rates of migration.
7:177:13973:24:23:88:539:234:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This brief review of the literature highlights the signiÖcant data limitations associated with
7:178:14067:23:24:72:540:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:previous research on the pattern of selection of Mexican migrants to the U.S. All the papers re-
7:179:14163:24:26:72:540:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:viewed above have developed novel and innovative uses of data to address the question of migrant
7:180:14259:26:15:84:539:161:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:3As noted by Fern·ndez-Huertas Moraga (2008), individuals moving to the US with their entire household are
7:181:14365:15:7:72:436:146:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:more likely to have higher education and wages creating a bias towards negative selection.
7:182:14455:7:15:84:539:139:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:4Munshi (2003) also uses the MMP to show that Mexican migrants are more likely to be employed and hold a
7:183:14559:15:7:72:346:124:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:higher paying job when their network in the United States is larger.
7:184:14627:7:15:84:539:117:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:5Durand et. al. (2001) also use the ENADID survey to show that Mexican migrants have become more negatively
7:185:14734:15:11:72:540:102:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:selected over time after controlling for cohort e§ects (though still predominantly drawn from the middle of the
7:186:14845:11:0:72:167:91:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:education distribution).
8:187:14870:0:24:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:self selection, but ultimately, these studies are subject to legitimate criticism related to problems
8:188:14971:24:24:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of measurement and data availability.  In this paper, we add to this literature by studying the
8:189:15066:24:24:72:540:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:question of immigrant selection using arguably the most appropriate data available.6As noted
8:190:15158:24:23:72:540:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earlier, the MxFLS is not subject to some of the potentially serious problems that have a§ected
8:191:15253:23:24:72:540:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:previous work. SpeciÖcally, the MxFLS allows us to identify all migrants, even those that have
8:192:15347:24:24:72:540:590:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:permanently moved to the U.S. Studies that use the Mexican Census (Ibarraran and Lubotsky
8:193:15436:24:23:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2007), the MMP (Orrenius and Zavodny 2005), the ENADID (McKenzie and Rapoport 2007),
8:194:15520:23:24:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:or the ENET (Fern·ndez-Huertas Moraga, 2008) do not observe most permanent migrants. The
8:195:15608:24:24:72:540:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:MxFLS also avoids the potential undercount of Mexican migrants in the U.S. Census, which is the
8:196:15703:24:24:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:data source used by Chiquiar and Hanson (2005). Further, the MxFLS does not depend on recall to
8:197:15798:24:23:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:identify migrants and time of migration like the MMP. Perhaps most importantly, the MxFLS has
8:198:15891:23:24:72:540:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:information on earnings of migrants before they have left Mexico, as well as proxies for the costs
8:199:15989:24:24:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of migration. Thus, we can examine selection on both observed and unobserved skills of Mexican
8:200:16083:24:23:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:migrants while attempting to control for the costs of migration, something which has not been done
8:201:16181:23:48:72:170:377:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:by previous studies.7
8:202:16202:48:35:71:146:329:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:3  Theory
8:203:16211:35:23:71:539:294:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In order to motivate the empirical analysis, this section presents a model of migration based on
8:204:16307:23:24:71:539:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Borjas (1987, 1991).8In our version of the model, mobility costs are allowed to vary with schooling
8:205:16406:24:26:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and with unobserved skills.9Individuals from Mexico, indexed by 0, choose whether or not to
8:206:16497:26:15:84:539:221:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:6Rubalcava, et al. (2008) use these same data to examine the health selectivity of migrants to the US. They also
8:207:16609:15:11:72:540:206:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:report the absence of any di§erential selection on education when measured as a linear function of years of schooling.
8:208:16727:11:11:72:540:195:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:This is consistent with our Öndings since the pattern of intermediate selection is only apparent when allowing for a
8:209:16843:11:7:72:205:184:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:non-linear functions of schooling.
8:210:16877:7:15:84:539:177:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:7Gould and Moav (2008) examine selection on both observed and unobserved skills for Israeli migrants. They Önd
8:211:16987:15:11:72:540:162:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:positive selection on education and intermediate selection on residual wages. However, it is important to note that
8:212:17102:11:11:72:540:151:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:the relative returns to education and unobserved skills are very di§erent between the United States and Israel, as
8:213:17216:11:7:72:284:140:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:compared to between Mexico and the United States.
8:214:17265:7:15:84:539:133:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:8Grogger and Hanson (2008) provide an alternative model of immigration where the decision to migrate is based
8:215:17374:15:10:72:540:118:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:on a linear (utility) function of wages rather than log (utility) function of wages. The key di§erence between their
8:216:17490:10:11:72:540:108:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:model and the model presented in this paper is that migration decisions depend on di§erences in wage levels between
8:217:17605:11:8:72:540:97:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:source and destination country in addition to di§erences in the return to skill in the source and destination country.
8:218:17723:8:0:84:533:89:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:9See McKenzie and Rapoport (2007) for a similar model that allows migration costs to be correlated with skill.
9:219:17834:0:24:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:migrate to the United States, indexed by 1, on the basis of their potential earnings net of moving
9:220:17932:24:24:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:costs. For simplicity, we treat this as a one-time decision. Residents of Mexico earn a wage given

9:226:18329:24:47:72:304:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:United States, they would earn a wage given by:

9:233:18850:24:47:72:353:330:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:distribution of the population of Mexico can be written as:

10:265:20825:24:0:72:539:75:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:(-1--0)<0because these highly educated individuals would earn more by remaining in Mexico.
11:266:20916:0:24:72:539:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:However, if migration costs are inversely related to schooling, such that--<0, we may observe

11:268:21105:24:24:72:540:661:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f2:E(sj-; I >0), we return to the case where the degree of selection depends only on the relative

11:291:22077:24:23:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:should observe positive selection in unobserved skill when there is greater inequality of the returns
11:292:22178:23:24:72:540:342:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to unobserved skill in the United States than in Mexico, and negative selection when there is greater
11:293:22279:24:24:72:463:318:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:inequality of the return to unobserved skill in Mexico than in the United States.10
11:294:22362:24:24:88:539:294:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:However, if migration costs are correlated with unobserved skill, then the type of selection
11:295:22454:24:23:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:generated may be in either direction. A positive correlation between migration costs and unobserved
11:296:22553:23:24:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:skills increases the likelihood of negative selection whereas a negative correlation between migration
11:297:22655:24:24:72:540:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:costs and unobserved skill increases the likelihood of positive selection. Note, once more, that by

11:299:22847:23:24:72:540:176:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:selection depends only on whether the dispersion in the return to unobserved skill in the United
11:300:22943:24:24:72:539:152:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:States is greater than the dispersion in the return to unobserved skill in Mexico,-0=-1, and the
11:301:23039:24:26:72:436:128:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:correlation between the returns to skills in the United States and Mexico,-.
11:302:23115:26:15:80:539:102:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:10Note that a small or negative value for-implies that migrants will have below-average earnings in Mexico but
11:303:23225:15:0:72:436:87:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:above-average earnings in the United States (what Borjas refers to as ìrefugee selectionî).
12:304:23318:0:24:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:To summarize, this simple model based on Borjas (1987) has a few, well-known empirical
12:305:23404:24:24:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:implications. First, the nature of the selection of Mexican migrants on observed skills depends on
12:306:23502:24:24:72:540:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the di§erence in the return to skill (e.g., education) in the U.S. and Mexico, and the correlation
12:307:23600:24:23:72:540:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:between the costs of migration and observed skill. Consider the case in which skill is measured
12:308:23695:23:24:72:540:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by education. Previous studies, and our own estimates, from the Mexican and U.S. Censuses have
12:309:23789:24:24:72:540:590:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:documented that the return to education is higher in Mexico than in the U.S. Thus, holding costs of
12:310:23888:24:23:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:migration constant, theory predicts that Mexican migrants will be negatively selected on education.
12:311:23987:23:24:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:However, if costs of migration are not held constant, then Mexican migrants may be negatively or
12:312:24083:24:24:72:540:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:positively selected on education (or selected from the middle of the education distribution). Similar
12:313:24184:24:24:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:arguments apply to more multi-dimensioned measures of skill such as those that also include age
12:314:24279:24:23:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and, in our case, cognitive ability. The other prediction from the model is that, holding costs of
12:315:24377:23:24:72:540:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:migration constant, selection on unobserved skill depends on the relative dispersion of the returns to
12:316:24479:24:24:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:unobserved skills in the U.S. and Mexico. Again, allowing costs of migration to di§er by skill makes
12:317:24579:24:23:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the prediction ambiguous. The following section describes the data and the empirical strategy used

12:321:24735:31:24:72:540:263:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The Mexican Family Life Survey is a longitudinal household survey that is representative at the
12:322:24830:24:24:72:540:239:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:national, urban-rural and regional level. The Örst round of the survey was conducted from April
12:323:24925:24:23:72:540:215:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to July 2002 and collected information from a sample of approximately 8,400 households or 35,000
12:324:25021:23:24:72:540:192:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:individuals across 150 di§erent communities in 16 of Mexicoís 32 states.11The baseline survey
12:325:25114:24:24:72:540:168:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:included both household information and individual-level information for all members living in the
12:326:25212:24:23:72:540:144:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:household. The survey covered many areas: educational attainment, labor market participation and
12:327:25308:23:26:72:540:121:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings, past migration experiences, assets, credit availability, and cognitive ability. The second

13:330:25554:24:24:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rate. Those who had migrated to the United States were contacted at a rate of over 91 percent.
13:331:25648:24:24:72:540:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Although information from the second round interviews of migrants to the United States has not yet
13:332:25746:24:23:72:540:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:been released, an indicator for whether the individual has moved to the United States is available
13:333:25844:23:24:72:540:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the public-use data; note that all migrants should be identiÖed even if they could not be found
13:334:25942:24:24:72:177:590:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:in the second round.12
13:335:25964:24:23:88:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We restrict the sample to males aged 21 to 65 in the Örst round of the MxFLS.13Table 1
13:336:26050:23:24:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:presents unweighted summary statistics for this sample. Panel A indicates that the fraction who
13:337:26145:24:24:72:540:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:migrated to the United States over the three year period prior to the second round of the MxFLS
13:338:26240:24:24:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is 3.63 percent, or 295 out of 8,116 men.14This rate of migration is consistent with other sources.
13:339:26339:24:23:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Hanson and McIntosh (2010) used consecutive Mexican Censuses to estimate migration rates and
13:340:26431:23:24:72:540:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reported 10-year migration rates of approximately 12-14 percent for young men in their 20s and
13:341:26525:24:24:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:5-10 percent for men in their 30s.  In our sample, the 3-year migration rates for men in their
13:342:26619:24:23:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:20s and 30s are 5.6 percent and 3.3 percent respectively, and are therefore consistent with those
13:343:26716:23:24:72:540:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reported by Hanson and McIntosh (2010). Passel and Cohn (2009) used CPS data to estimate
13:344:26804:24:24:72:540:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that approximately 550,000 Mexican immigrants arrived in the US each year between 2003 and
13:345:26894:24:24:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2006. This Ögure represents about 1.1 percent of the non-elderly adult population of Mexico. In
13:346:26989:24:23:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the MxFLS, approximately 2.8 percent of the baseline adult (male and female) sample migrated
13:347:27081:23:24:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:between 2002 and 2005, which is roughly equivalent to the annual rate reported by Passel and
13:348:27173:24:24:72:100:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Cohn.
13:349:27178:24:23:88:539:234:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The variables in Panels B and C are from the Örst round of the MxFLS in 2002, reported by the
13:350:27271:23:26:72:540:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:head of household (or other knowledge person in the household) and the individual, respectively.
13:351:27367:26:15:80:539:185:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:12In cases where entire households were no longer present at the original address, the interviewers searched for the
13:352:27483:15:11:72:540:170:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:Önal destination of that particular household. This was aided by information collected in the Örst round of the survey
13:353:27601:11:11:72:540:159:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:where in the case of the household were to move, the address and telephone number of close relatives (including those
13:354:27718:11:7:72:411:148:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:living in the United States) could assist in providing current household information.
13:355:27803:7:15:80:539:141:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:13An analysis of female migration is complicated by the fact that the migration decision is more likely to be tied to
13:356:27920:15:11:72:540:126:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:spouse and labor market participation is substantially lower making it more di¢ cult to compare wages. This latter
13:357:28034:11:7:72:465:115:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:point also applies to the analysis of men younger than 21 years of age (as shown in Appendix B).
13:358:28130:7:15:80:539:108:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:14This includes 217 men who were residing in the United States and 78 men who moved to the United States
13:359:28234:15:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:but returned to Mexico by time of the second round. We do not exclude return migrants because they migrated
13:360:28341:11:11:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:subsequent to the baseline survey and their decision to return to Mexico is likely to be based partly on ex-post
13:361:28453:11:0:72:286:71:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:realizations of their experiences in the United States.
14:362:28510:0:24:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The main variables from Panel B used in the empirical analysis are age, marital status, and the
14:363:28605:24:24:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:total value of household assets. But we also show that average years of schooling and the proportion
14:364:28705:24:24:72:540:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:working in the sample, as reported by the head of household, are very similar to reports by the
14:365:28800:24:23:72:540:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:individuals themselves.  The proportion of our sample living in rural areas is about 50 percent
14:366:28895:23:24:72:540:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:which is somewhat higher than the 41 percent of an analogous sample in the 2000 Mexican Census.
14:367:28990:24:24:72:540:590:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:However, the average years of schooling in our sample is almost identical to the 7.27 years of
14:368:29084:24:23:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:schooling reported for a similar sample of men aged 21 to 65 in 2000 Mexican Census. The MxFLS
14:369:29178:23:24:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:also provides information on cognitive ability, a dimension of skill that is usually unmeasured in
14:370:29276:24:24:72:540:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:most data sets. Cognitive ability is measured as the number of correct responses to 12 multiple-
14:371:29372:24:24:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:choice questions of a Ravenís (1983) Progressive Matrices test. In addition, the MxFLS contains
14:372:29467:24:23:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:unique information on plausible proxies for the costs of migration (presence of relatives in the US,
14:373:29567:23:24:72:540:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:past migration experience, US documentation) and credit constraints (household assets, individual
14:374:29664:24:24:72:237:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:savings, and availability of credit).
14:375:29701:24:23:88:539:400:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We focus on individual reports of annual earnings because these include several important
14:376:29790:23:24:72:540:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:categories, such as proÖt-sharing and Christmas bonuses, which are omitted in individual reports
14:377:29886:24:24:72:539:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of monthly earnings.15Moreover, since all of the individual interviews were conducted between
14:378:29979:24:24:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:April and July, monthly earnings may be subject to seasonal variation. We include earnings in
14:379:30072:24:23:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the main job as well as any earnings received from a secondary job, and use proxy reports to
14:380:30164:23:24:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:complete any missing information.16Nevertheless, we will assess the sensitivity of our Öndings to
14:381:30261:24:24:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:excluding proxy reports, excluding imputed values, and calculating earnings and wages on the basis
14:382:30359:24:23:72:540:234:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of monthly earnings. We also calculate hourly wages based on the total number of hours worked
14:383:30452:23:24:72:540:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:throughout the year (as number of weeks worked during the year multiplied by the usual hours
14:384:30544:24:27:72:540:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:worked per week).17The average hourly wage based on annual earnings for our sample is about
14:385:30635:27:14:80:539:160:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:15Federal law requires Örms to participate in a proÖt sharing program in which employees receive 10 percent of
14:386:30745:14:11:72:540:146:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:the Örmís annual proÖts. Firms are also required to pay a year-end Christmas bonus (Aguinaldo) to all employees
14:387:30856:11:7:72:219:135:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:equivalent to at least two-weeks pay.
14:388:30893:7:15:80:539:128:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:16Proxy reports account for approximately 10-15 percent of observations for most variables. For individuals who
14:389:31004:15:11:72:540:113:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:are working but do not report positive earnings, we impute earnings based on age, years schooling, marital status,
14:390:31118:11:7:72:458:102:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:urban status, state Öxed e§ects and earnings information as reported by the head of household.
14:391:31212:7:15:80:539:95:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:17We drop outliers that appear to be data errors. SpeciÖcally, we trim individuals with hourly wages less than 0.1
14:392:31326:15:0:72:430:80:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:and greater than 1000 pesos. This accounts for approximately 0.5 percent of the sample.
15:393:31415:0:24:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:17 pesos which is similar to the 18 pesos an hour based on monthly earnings in the 2000 Mexican
15:394:31510:24:40:72:526:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Census. Appendix A describes the construction of all the variables in Table 1 in greater detail.
15:395:31606:40:31:72:214:645:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:4.2  Empirical Strategy
15:396:31629:31:23:72:540:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The MxFLS data is ideally suited to test the predictions of the Borjas (1987, 1991) model in the
15:397:31725:23:24:72:540:591:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:context of Mexican migration to the United States. To do so, we Örst describe the nature of se-
15:398:31820:24:24:72:540:567:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:lection of migrants separately for three observed measures of skills: education, age and cognitive
15:399:31918:24:23:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ability. In particular, we examine the proportion of migrants from di§erent parts of the educa-
15:400:32013:23:24:72:540:520:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tion distribution, age distribution, and cognitive ability distribution. We also compare the wage
15:401:32110:24:24:72:540:496:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:distributions of migrants and non-migrants. This exercise essentially replicates earlier studies ex-
15:402:32210:24:24:72:540:472:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:amining the observable characteristics of Mexican migrants to the U.S., but takes advantage of a
15:403:32306:24:23:72:467:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:representative survey that does not undercount certain types of Mexican migrants.
15:404:32387:23:24:88:539:425:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The preceding analysis considers each observable skill separately and ignores the price of these
15:405:32483:24:24:72:540:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:skills in the labor market. We therefore proceed to price out observed skills and analyze the nature
15:406:32583:24:23:72:540:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of selection using an index of observed skills, as measured by predicted wages. Predicted wages
15:407:32678:23:24:72:540:354:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are obtained using various combinations of observed skills, beginning with just education, adding
15:408:32775:24:24:72:540:330:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:age, and Önally introducing a measure of cognitive ability. The wage models are estimated using a
15:409:32872:24:24:72:540:306:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:saturated model that include all interactions between the di§erent aspects of observed skill. The
15:410:32969:24:23:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:di§erence between migrants and non-migrants in observed skill are assessed using the following
15:411:33063:23:48:72:154:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:regression model:
15:412:33080:48:35:234:540:211:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:Pr (mi= 1) =-0+-1Oi+-i;(9)

15:414:33195:23:24:72:540:153:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of observed skills. We carry out this analysis by collapsing our measures of education, age, and
15:415:33291:24:24:72:540:129:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:cognitive ability into di§erent categories. For example, we construct the index of observable skill
15:416:33390:24:24:72:540:105:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:based on education, age, and cognitive ability by regressing wages on the full set of interactions

16:427:33791:24:23:71:539:602:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:coe¢ cient on our index of observable skills would be negative indicating that migrants are over-
16:428:33888:23:24:71:539:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:represented among Mexicans with below-average skills and underrepresented among the Mexicans
16:429:33980:24:24:71:540:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with above-average skills. In fact, we consider áexible speciÖcations ofOiby including indicator
16:430:34076:24:23:72:540:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:variables for di§erent quantiles of the predicted wage distribution that allow us to pick up non-linear
16:431:34179:23:24:72:171:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:patterns of selection.
16:432:34201:24:24:88:539:484:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We then conduct a similar analysis of the selection of migrants by unobserved skill by estimating
16:433:34298:24:47:72:220:460:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:an analogous regression model:
16:434:34328:47:35:235:539:413:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:Pr (mi= 1) =\f0+\f1Ui+-i;(11)

16:436:34450:24:24:71:539:354:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:observable skills. Again, we consider áexible speciÖcations ofUiby including indicator variables
16:437:34546:24:24:71:539:330:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for di§erent quintiles of the residual wage distribution that allow us to pick up non-linear patterns
16:438:34647:24:23:71:540:306:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of selection.18Note that it is only because the MxFLS has earnings information for migrants while
16:439:34744:23:24:71:497:283:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:they are still in Mexico that we can conduct the analysis of selection on unobserved skill.
16:440:34835:24:24:88:539:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Finally, we re-assess the nature of selection on observed and unobserved skills with additional
16:441:34930:24:23:71:539:235:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:controls for the costs of migration, the availability of credit, as well as community Öxed e§ects.
16:442:35028:23:24:71:539:212:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:According to the theory, we expect to see greater evidence of negative selection when migration
16:443:35123:24:24:71:539:188:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:costs are included than when they are not included. To the extent that some individuals face binding
16:444:35223:24:23:71:539:164:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:liquidity constraints, adding measures of credit availability may also a§ect the nature of selection.
16:445:35324:23:24:71:539:141:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Community Öxed e§ects should capture any di§erences across communities that may be correlated
16:446:35417:24:26:71:539:117:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with migration decisions.  While certain communities may be associated with di§erent costs of
16:447:35510:26:15:80:539:91:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:18For simplicity, we estimate equations 9 and 11 using a linear probability model but our results are robust to
16:448:35621:15:0:72:194:76:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:probit and logit speciÖcations.
17:449:35654:0:24:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:migration, there are likely to be important di§erences in terms of relative returns to observed and
17:450:35753:24:47:72:495:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:unobserved skills across communities (as documented by Ibarraran and Lubotsky, 2007).

17:452:35848:36:30:72:473:602:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:5.1  Selection of Migrants on Age, Education, Ability and Earnings
17:453:35914:30:24:72:540:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We begin by describing the nature of selection of migrants by education, age, cognitive ability
17:454:36009:24:24:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and earnings. Table 2 shows the proportion of migrants and non-migrants across Öve education
17:455:36101:24:24:72:540:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:categories, Öve age categories, four categories of cognitive ability, as well as earnings and wage
17:456:36199:24:23:72:540:500:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:quintiles. On average, migrants are younger than non-migrants, and there is a steep gradient in
17:457:36294:23:24:72:540:477:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the likelihood of migrating by age.  Compared to non-migrants, migrants are signiÖcantly over
17:458:36387:24:24:72:540:453:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:represented among those aged 21 to 29, and signiÖcantly under represented among those aged 48
17:459:36480:24:23:72:540:429:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to 65. For example, 44 percent of all migrants are aged 21 to 29 as compared to 28 percent of

17:461:36586:24:24:88:539:382:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:With respect to education, Table 2 indicates that migrants are signiÖcantly over represented in
17:462:36681:24:24:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the middle of the education distribution, similar to the Öndings in Chiquiar and Hanson (2005) and
17:463:36779:24:23:72:540:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Orrenius and Zavodny (2005). Among migrants, 32 percent have seven to nine years of schooling
17:464:36872:23:24:72:540:311:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:compared to 25 percent of non-migrants. Panel A of Figure 1 shows the probability of migrat-
17:465:36964:24:24:72:540:287:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ing disaggregated by each year of schooling, with the solid line depicting a quadratic Öt to the
17:466:37060:24:23:72:540:263:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:probability of migrating (estimated at the individual level). The general pattern of results is the

17:468:37253:24:24:72:540:216:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:than those at either the top or bottom of the distributionó but there is somewhat less uniformity
17:469:37350:24:24:72:339:192:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:to the pattern than suggested by estimates in Table 2.19
17:470:37406:24:23:88:539:168:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In contrast to age and education, migrants di§er very little from non-migrants on cognitive
17:471:37497:23:24:71:539:145:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ability. Table 2 reveals that the proportions of migrant and non-migrants are virtually identical
17:472:37594:24:24:71:539:121:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:across di§erent categories of cognitive ability. Panel B of Figure 1 illustrates the probability of

17:474:37805:15:10:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:and about equal to the probability of migration among those with six, eight and nine years of schooling, and greater
17:475:37921:10:0:72:445:72:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:than the probability of migrating among those with ten, twelve and more years of schooling.

18:477:38115:24:24:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the quadratic Öt to the proportion of migrants by cognitive ability score). The absence of any dif-
18:478:38214:24:24:72:540:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ference between migrants and non-migrants with respect to cognitive test scores is surprising given
18:479:38313:24:23:72:540:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the Öndings for education and the relatively high positive correlation between years of schooling
18:480:38410:23:24:72:232:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and cognitive test score (r=0.49).
18:481:38444:24:24:88:539:590:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Migrants are most heavily represented in the second quintile of the earnings distribution re-
18:482:38537:24:23:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:gardless of whether earnings are measured on an annual or hourly basis. According to Table 2,
18:483:38630:23:24:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:approximately 25 percent of migrants are in the second quintile compared to 19 percent of non-
18:484:38724:24:24:72:540:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:migrants. Migrants are also signiÖcantly less likely than non-migrants to be found in the top quintile
18:485:38826:24:24:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of annual earnings. Panels A and B of Figure 2 show the distribution of (log) earnings for migrants
18:486:38925:24:23:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and non-migrants on an annual and hourly basis respectively.20Both panels show that migrants
18:487:39017:23:24:72:540:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are more likely to be found in the middle of the earnings distributions than non-migrants. Panels
18:488:39114:24:24:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:C and D plot the di§erence in the migrant and non-migrant distributions for (log) earnings and
18:489:39208:24:23:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(log) hourly wages, respectively. This Önding is similar to that of education, and is consistent with
18:490:39309:23:24:72:540:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the strong ináuence of education on earnings, even though wages include other components of skill.
18:491:39407:24:24:72:540:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Note that there are no signiÖcant di§erences in the probability of working between migrants and
18:492:39502:24:24:72:138:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:non-migrants.
18:493:39515:24:23:88:539:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:To summarize, estimates in Table 2, and the relationships presented in Figures 1 and 2, show
18:494:39607:23:24:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that Mexican migrants di§er from non-migrants along observable dimensions of skill, and that
18:495:39699:24:24:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:migrants tend to be overrepresented in the middle of the education and earnings distributions.
18:496:39793:24:23:72:540:234:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Surprisingly, migrants and non-migrants tend to have similar distributions of cognitive test scores.
18:497:39893:23:24:72:540:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Migrants are also over represented among those 21 to 29 years of age and under represented among
18:498:39989:24:24:72:540:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:those aged 48 to 65.  The Önding of selection from the middle of the education and earnings
18:499:40080:24:24:72:540:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:distributions is similar to some previous research, and is somewhat of a puzzle given that the
18:500:40174:24:25:72:539:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:returns to education in Mexico are generally higher than in the U.S.21Although the pattern of

18:508:40501:7:0:80:539:81:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:21Our calculations from the 2000 U.S. and Mexican Censuses indicate that returns to education in Mexico are

19:510:40708:24:24:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:returns to age in Mexico are relatively higher among the middle-aged than among younger men
19:511:40799:24:24:72:540:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:as compared to the U.S., the longer time horizon and potentially lower costs (in terms of family
19:512:40895:24:23:72:540:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:attachments, etc.) probably explains much of why younger workers are so much more likely to
19:513:40986:23:24:72:540:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:migrate.  Table 2 also presents di§erences between migrants and non-migrants for a number of
19:514:41078:24:24:72:540:590:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:variables that can serve as proxies for the costs of migration: marital status, whether a person has
19:515:41178:24:23:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a family member living in the U.S., whether a person has previously visited the U.S. whether a
19:516:41272:23:24:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:person has U.S. documentation (visa, greencard, or passport), and whether a person has considered
19:517:41369:24:24:72:540:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:moving to the U.S. All these variables are signiÖcantly di§erent between migrants and non-migrants
19:518:41467:24:40:72:400:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:suggesting that these costs are important determinants of migration.

19:520:41592:30:24:72:540:425:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The preceding analysis considered each observable skill separately and ignored the price of these
19:521:41689:24:24:72:540:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:skills in the labor market.  In this section, we price out observed skills and examine whether
19:522:41783:24:23:72:540:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:migrants and non-migrants di§er on an index of observed skills, measured by predicted wages.
19:523:41875:23:24:72:540:354:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:As explained in the section 4.2, we construct this index of observed skill by regressing observed
19:524:41972:24:24:72:540:330:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:wages on various combinations of age, education and cognitive test scores and forming a predicted
19:525:42069:24:24:72:540:306:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:measure of wages (where age can be viewed as a proxy for experience). We then assess whether
19:526:42161:24:23:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the probability to migrate di§ers by the observed skill index, as measured by quintiles of predicted
19:527:42261:23:24:72:539:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:wages (i.e., observed skills).22We use two indices of predicted skill ñone based on predicted annual
19:528:42361:24:24:72:540:235:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings and one based on predicted hourly wages ñand construct each index three ways: using
19:529:42453:24:23:72:540:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:only education to predict wages, using age and education (including all interactions) to predict
19:530:42549:23:24:72:540:188:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:wages, and using age, education and cognitive test scores (including all interactions) to predict
19:531:42646:24:30:72:103:164:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:wages.
19:532:42652:30:11:72:540:134:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:higher than in the U.S. for the most educated and lower than in the U.S. for the least educated (0-3 years). Indeed,
19:533:42768:11:11:72:540:123:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:the di§erences in the return to education between Mexico and the U.S. are increasing (in favor of Mexico) in years
19:534:42882:11:7:72:122:112:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:of schooling.
19:535:42895:7:15:80:539:105:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:22We have examined alternative speciÖcations, such as quartiles and tertiles, with similar results. Our Öndings also
19:536:43011:15:0:72:478:90:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:hold with parametric speciÖcations that include non-linear (i.e. quadratic) terms in predicted wages.
20:537:43114:0:24:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 3 presents the regression estimates of the association between the probability of migrating
20:538:43211:24:24:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and the index of observed skill distribution, as measured by predicted wages. Consider the estimates
20:539:43311:24:24:72:540:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in column (1) where we use only education to predict wages. For both annual earnings and hourly
20:540:43406:24:23:72:540:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:wages, the estimates indicate that migrants are signiÖcantly more likely to come from the 3rd
20:541:43499:23:24:72:540:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:quintile of the observed skill distribution than the 1st (bottom) quintile, and signiÖcantly less likely
20:542:43603:24:24:72:540:590:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to come from the 5th quintile than the 1st quintile of the observed skill distribution. The magnitudes
20:543:43705:24:23:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the di§erences are relatively large. The probability of migrating is 0.013 percentage points, or 37
20:544:43807:23:24:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:percent of the mean, greater in the 3rd quintile than the 1st quintile. These estimates are consistent
20:545:43909:24:24:72:540:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with estimates in Table 2 showing that migrants were signiÖcantly over represented among those
20:546:44003:24:24:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with seven to nine years of schooling and signiÖcantly under represented among those with 12 or
20:547:44098:24:23:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:more years of schooling. This implies that restricting attention to the sample of wage earners does
20:548:44197:23:24:72:540:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:not change the main Önding of selection from the middle of the education distribution. Further
20:549:44291:24:24:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:note that we get similar results with the somewhat smaller sample of men with wage observations
20:550:44386:24:23:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:as with the larger sample of men with information on years of schooling. This conÖrms that labor
20:551:44482:23:24:72:457:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:market participation di§erences are not driving the Öndings for predicted wages.
20:552:44562:24:24:88:539:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Columns (2) and (3) show estimates of the association between the probability of migrating and
20:553:44656:24:24:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:observed skill when the observed skill indices are constructed by using age and cognitive test scores
20:554:44757:24:23:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in addition to education to predict wages. In each case, migrants are signiÖcantly more likely to
20:555:44854:23:24:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:come from the 3rd and 4th quintiles than the 1st quintile of the observed skill distribution. The
20:556:44951:24:24:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:magnitudes of the di§erences here are also relatively large. The probability of migration is 0.015
20:557:45049:24:23:72:540:234:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(44 percent) to 0.023 (67 percent) greater in the 3rd and 4th quintiles than the 1st quintile. Overall,
20:558:45152:23:24:72:540:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:these estimates, based on more comprehensive measures of observed skill, continue to show that
20:559:45246:24:40:72:498:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:migrants are drawn disproportionately from the middle of the observed skill distribution.

20:561:45394:31:23:72:540:116:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:One of the advantages of the MxFLS is that we observe earnings in Mexico for both migrants and
20:562:45488:23:0:72:540:93:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:non-migrants, and we can use these earnings data to assess the nature of selection of migrants on
21:563:45587:0:24:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:unobserved skill as well as observed skills, which has not been previously studied. The unobserved
21:564:45685:24:24:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:skill index is based on residual earnings ñthe portion of earnings orthogonal to measured aspects
21:565:45782:24:24:72:540:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of skill such as age, education and cognitive test scores.  Thus, we can obtain estimates of the
21:566:45878:24:23:72:540:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:association between the probability to migrate and the distribution of unobserved skills, as measured
21:567:45979:23:24:72:540:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by quintiles of residual earnings. Table 4 presents these estimates and it is structured analogously
21:568:46079:24:24:72:124:590:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to Table 3.
21:569:46090:24:23:88:539:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In contrast to our Öndings for observed skill, estimates in Table 4 indicate that the probability
21:570:46187:23:24:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of migrating is not signiÖcantly related to unobserved skill. These results imply that, for the most
21:571:46287:24:24:72:540:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:part, migrants and non-migrants have similar distributions of unobserved skill. The exception is
21:572:46383:24:24:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:among those in the 5th (top) quintile of unobserved skill, but only when unobserved skill is based
21:573:46481:24:23:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on residual annual earnings.  In this case, the probability of migration among those in the 5th
21:574:46576:23:24:72:540:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:quintile is signiÖcantly lower, approximately 50 percent of the mean, than in the 1st quintile. If we
21:575:46677:24:24:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:consider the results in Tables 3 and 4 simultaneously, we can infer the source of the selection from
21:576:46777:24:23:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the middle of the wage distribution revealed in Figure 2. The over representation of migrants in the
21:577:46877:23:24:72:540:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:middle of the wage distribution is due to the over representation of migrants in the middle of the
21:578:46975:24:24:72:540:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:observed skill distribution, as there is relatively little di§erence in the distribution of unobserved
21:579:47077:24:40:72:269:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:skill between migrants and non-migrants.

21:581:47189:30:24:72:540:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The pattern of selection of migrants from the middle of the education distribution is inconsistent
21:582:47287:24:24:72:540:235:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with a simple model of migration that assumes constant costs of migration. The higher observed
21:583:47381:24:23:72:540:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:return to education in Mexico compared to the U.S. implies negative selection, so we expect migrants
21:584:47481:23:24:72:540:188:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to be over represented in the bottom of the education distribution and under represented at the top
21:585:47580:24:24:72:540:164:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the education distribution. However, it is unlikely that the costs of migration are constant, and
21:586:47680:24:24:72:540:140:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:there are plausible reasons to expect the costs of migration to be negatively related with education
21:587:47780:24:23:72:540:116:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(Chiswick, 1999).  For example, more educated individuals may Önd it easier to navigate the
21:588:47871:23:0:72:540:93:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:bureaucratic procedures necessary to migrate legally to the U.S. or cover the Öxed costs necessary
22:589:47971:0:24:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to enter the U.S. (either legally or illegally). If the costs of migration are negatively related to
22:590:48071:24:24:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:education, then ignoring such costs will make it more likely to observe positive (or less negative)
22:591:48170:24:24:72:540:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:selection of migrants by education. The pattern of selection across the observed skill distribution
22:592:48269:24:23:72:540:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:will likewise be a§ected by di§erential costs. Moreover, the Mexico-U.S. di§erence in the return to
22:593:48368:23:24:72:540:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:observed skill may not be constant throughout the skill distribution. If the return to skill varies
22:594:48467:24:24:72:540:590:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:over the distribution, then we would also expect the nature of the selection of migrants to vary over
22:595:48568:24:23:72:180:566:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:the skill distribution.23
22:596:48593:23:24:88:539:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In this section, we examine the skill distributions of migrants and non-migrants conditional on
22:597:48688:24:24:72:540:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:proxy variables for the cost of migration, and conditional on di§erences in the return to observed

22:599:48884:24:23:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the observed skill distribution with these additional controls for the full index of observed skill
22:600:48986:23:24:72:539:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:based on education, age, and cognitive ability.24Panel A presents estimates for observed skill
22:601:49080:24:24:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:constructed using annual earnings, and Panel B presents estimates for observed skill constructed
22:602:49176:24:23:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:using hourly wages. Estimates in column (1) of each panel are taken directly from Table 3 and are
22:603:49273:23:24:72:390:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:presented to facilitate comparison with other estimates in Table 5.
22:604:49340:24:24:88:539:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Estimates in column (2) of Table 5 are based on regressions that include proxy variables for
22:605:49432:24:24:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the costs of migration.  These variables include marital status, whether a person has a family
22:606:49526:24:23:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:member living in the U.S., whether a person has previously visited the U.S. whether a person has
22:607:49622:23:24:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:U.S. documentation (visa, greencard, or passport), and whether a person has considered moving
22:608:49715:24:24:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to the U.S. In both panels, the addition of controls for the costs of migration substantially changes
22:609:49816:24:23:72:540:234:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the pattern of selection on observed skills. Clearly, these proxy variables for costs of migration
22:610:49914:23:24:72:540:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are systematically related to the observed skill distribution and probability of migration, and the
22:611:50013:24:24:72:540:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Önding of selection from the middle of the observed skill distribution is not robust to the inclusion
22:612:50114:24:24:72:540:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of such controls.  Indeed, all of our proxies for the costs of migration are highly signiÖcant in
22:613:50211:24:26:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the expected directions (not shown). Comparing estimates in column (2) to those in column (1)
22:614:50304:26:15:80:539:113:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:23Note, however, that if the return to observed skill is monotonically increasing in skill, then the selection from
22:615:50419:15:11:72:540:98:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:the middle of the skill distribution reported in Table 3 cannot be solely explained by variation in the Mexico-U.S.
22:616:50534:11:7:72:202:87:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:di§erences in the return to skill.
22:617:50568:7:0:80:539:80:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:24The results in Table 3 are similar for an index of observed skill based on just education, or on education and age.
23:618:50687:0:24:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reveals that the addition of proxy variables for the costs of migration signiÖcantly decreases the
23:619:50785:24:24:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:association between the probability of migration and being in the 3rd and 4th quintiles of the
23:620:50879:24:24:72:540:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:observed skill distribution (versus the 1st quintile). In fact, none of the estimates in column (2) are
23:621:50982:24:23:72:540:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:statistically signiÖcant and most of the estimates are relatively small when measured against the
23:622:51079:23:24:72:540:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:mean, although somewhat imprecise. Thus, including controls for the costs of migration provides
23:623:51174:24:24:72:540:590:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:far less evidence for the selection of migrants from the middle of the observed skill distribution, and
23:624:51277:24:23:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:raises the possibility that more complete controls for the costs of migration would actually reverse
23:625:51377:23:24:72:186:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the pattern of selection.
23:626:51402:24:24:88:539:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In column (3), we add controls for household assets and access to credit (whether individuals
23:627:51495:24:24:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:know of any person or place where one can borrow or ask for a credit, and whether they have any
23:628:51590:24:23:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:savings). Some have argued that the inability to Önance migration is an important determinant of
23:629:51686:23:24:72:540:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Mexican migration, and failure to consider this may a§ect the pattern of selection (Orrenius and
23:630:51782:24:24:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Zavodny 2005). Estimates in column (3) in Panels A and B of Table 5 are very similar to those in
23:631:51878:24:23:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:column (1). Thus, for our measures of assets and credit, there is little evidence that these variables
23:632:51980:23:24:72:363:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:play an important role in the nature of selection of migrants.
23:633:52042:24:24:88:539:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The next speciÖcation in Table 5 adds community Öxed e§ects. The main motivation for this
23:634:52131:24:24:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:speciÖcation is evidence regarding community-speciÖc di§erences in the return to skill (Ibarraran
23:635:52228:24:23:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and Lubotsky 2007).  In addition, communities may di§er in the extent of migration networks
23:636:52319:23:24:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and other characteristics that are likely to alter the costs of migration (McKenzie and Rapoport
23:637:52415:24:24:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2007). It is unclear which of these two possibilities may be more important. Column (4) presents
23:638:52511:24:23:72:540:234:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:estimates for this speciÖcation indicating that the probability of migration is signiÖcantly higher
23:639:52610:23:24:72:540:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for those in the 2nd to 5th quintiles than those in the 1st quintile. The magnitudes of the estimates
23:640:52711:24:24:72:540:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:continue to suggest that migrants are disproportionately drawn from the middle of the observed skill
23:641:52811:24:24:72:540:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:distribution, although the pattern of the associations between the probability of migration and the
23:642:52910:24:23:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:observed skill distribution appears to be more of a step function than the inverted U-shape pattern
23:643:53009:23:24:72:540:116:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:seen in column (1). However, it is clear that observed skill is highly correlated with community
23:644:53105:24:0:72:131:92:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Öxed e§ects.
24:645:53119:0:24:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Theory predicts that the probability of migration depends on di§erences in the return to ob-
24:646:53211:24:24:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:served skill between Mexico and the U.S. Accordingly, we calculated the return to observed skill
24:647:53307:24:24:72:540:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:based on age and education for Mexican migrants in the U.S. (using the 2000 U.S. Census) and
24:648:53399:24:23:72:540:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:residents of Mexico (using the 2000 Mexican Census). We include a full set of interactions between
24:649:53497:23:24:72:540:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:our Öve education and Öve age categories. We then merge the di§erential in the estimated return
24:650:53592:24:24:72:540:590:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to skill by age and education categories, and include this di§erential in the regression model (while
24:651:53693:24:23:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:clustering on age*education). The resulting estimates are shown in column (5) of Table 5. The
24:652:53786:23:24:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:coe¢ cient on the MexicoñU.S. di§erential in the return to skill is positive and signiÖcant in both
24:653:53885:24:24:72:540:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:panels, which is consistent with theory. A one standard deviation (0.44) increase in the relative
24:654:53982:24:24:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:return to skill in Mexico versus the U.S. is associated with a 0.023 percentage point (69 percent
24:655:54079:24:23:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of mean) increase in the probability of migration. Moreover, estimates in column (5) are quite
24:656:54173:23:24:72:540:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:similar to those in column (4); the probability of migration is signiÖcantly higher for those in the
24:657:54273:24:24:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2nd to 5th quintiles of the observed skill distribution than those in the 1st quintile. The similarity
24:658:54375:24:23:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of estimates in columns (4) and (5) suggest that community-speciÖc Öxed e§ects are be picking up
24:659:54471:23:24:72:540:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:di§erences in the return to observed skill, consistent with the Öndings in Ibarraran and Lubotsky
24:660:54568:24:24:72:105:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(2007).
24:661:54575:24:24:88:539:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Finally, the estimates in column (5) suggest that di§erences in the costs of migration are strongly
24:662:54674:24:23:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:correlated with observed skill and the probability of migration. This inference is plausible given
24:663:54772:23:24:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that the di§erential in the Mexico-U.S. returns to skill are included in the model.  Thus, the
24:664:54866:24:24:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:selection on observed skill revealed by estimates in column (5) is likely being driven by di§erences
24:665:54966:24:23:72:540:234:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the costs of migration. Indeed, this hypothesis is supported by estimates in column (6) that
24:666:55061:23:24:72:540:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:include both the di§erential in the Mexico-U.S. return to skills and proxy variables for the costs of
24:667:55162:24:24:72:540:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:migration. Estimates in column (6) are substantially less positive than estimates in column (5), and
24:668:55262:24:24:72:540:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the di§erences between estimates in column (6) versus those in column (5) are similar to di§erences
24:669:55361:24:23:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:between estimates in columns (2) versus column (1). In both cases, the addition of proxy variables
24:670:55459:23:24:72:540:116:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for the costs of migration weakens the pattern of selection from the middle of the observed skill
24:671:55556:24:0:72:510:92:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:distribution, and provides more evidence in support of the standard prediction from theory.
25:672:55649:0:24:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We also conduct a similar analysis as that represented by Table 5, but using residual wages as
25:673:55743:24:24:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:an index of unobserved skill. Estimates from this analysis are presented in Table 6. In general, the
25:674:55843:24:24:72:540:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:estimates in Table 6 are small (relative to the mean) and statistically insigniÖcant. There is little
25:675:55944:24:23:72:540:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:evidence of selection on unobserved skill, which is similar to the conclusions we drew from Table 4.

25:678:56244:24:23:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:quintiles of the unobserved skill distribution. The only signiÖcant associations are those between
25:679:56342:23:24:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:belonging to the 5th (top) quintile of the distribution of unobserved skill based and the probability
25:680:56443:24:24:72:540:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of migration. Those in the top quintile of the unobserved skill distribution are signiÖcantly less
25:681:56541:24:24:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:likely to migrate than those in the bottom quintile, although this is only true in the top panel
25:682:56637:24:23:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:when unobserved skill is measured by residual annual earnings. The addition of community Öxed
25:683:56730:23:24:72:540:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:e§ects eliminates the signiÖcant association between being in the top quintile of the unobserved
25:684:56826:24:24:72:312:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:skill distribution and the probability of migration.
25:685:56878:24:23:88:539:400:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In Appendix Table 1, we explore whether our results are robust to di§erent speciÖcations of
25:686:56969:23:24:72:540:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings and wages in the case of observed skill. SpeciÖcally, we assess the sensitivity of our Öndings
25:687:57072:24:24:72:540:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to excluding information from proxy reports (by a knowledgeable member of the household), to
25:688:57164:24:24:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:excluding imputed values for earnings and wages for individuals who are working but do not report
25:689:57261:24:23:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:positive earnings, and to calculating earnings and wages on the basis of monthly earnings. Our
25:690:57355:23:24:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:results are generally robust to these alternative speciÖcations. We observe selection from the middle
25:691:57456:24:24:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the observed skill distribution when excluding controls for the costs of migration (columns 1, 3,
25:692:57556:24:23:72:540:234:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and 5), and more negative selection once controls for the costs of migration are included (columns
25:693:57654:23:24:72:540:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2, 4, and 6). Although not shown here, the results in Table 6 are also robust to these alternative
25:694:57752:24:48:72:246:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:speciÖcations of earnings and wages.
25:695:57788:48:34:72:170:139:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:6  Discussion
25:696:57801:34:24:72:540:105:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:How do our Öndings relate to those reported in previous studies? In models that do not include
25:697:57895:24:0:72:540:81:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:variables measuring the costs of migration, we Önd evidence for ìintermediateîselection of Mexican
26:698:57995:0:24:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:migrants on education and on an index of observed skill.  These Öndings are similar to results
26:699:58089:24:24:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reported by Chiquiar and Hanson (2005), Orrenius and Zavodny (2005), and, with respect to
26:700:58178:24:24:72:540:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:education, Fern·ndez-Huertas Moraga (2008).  However, Ibarraran and Lubotsky (2007) found
26:701:58267:24:23:72:540:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:negative selection of migrants on education, and Fern·ndez-Huertas Moraga (2008) found negative
26:702:58362:23:24:72:540:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:selection of urban migrants on earnings (but positive selection of rural migrants on earnings).
26:703:58457:24:24:72:540:590:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Ibarraran and Lubotsky (2007) argue that their Önding is di§erent from Chiquiar and Hanson
26:704:58547:24:23:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(2005) because it corrects for certain data problems, speciÖcally, the undercount of migrants in U.S.
26:705:58648:23:24:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Census and over reporting of education of migrants in U.S. Census. Fern·ndez-Huertas Moraga
26:706:58739:24:24:72:540:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(2008) also argues that the di§erence between his Öndings and the Öndings of Chiquiar and Hanson
26:707:58835:24:24:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(2005), at least in the case of urban migrants, is because of the undercount of migrants in the U.S.
26:708:58935:24:23:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Census.25However, our data are not subject to this undercounting problem or to the problem of
26:709:59028:23:24:72:540:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:over reporting of education, and yet we Önd ìintermediateî selection on both education and an
26:710:59121:24:24:72:181:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:index of observed skill.
26:711:59145:24:23:88:539:400:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:An explanation for the di§erence between our Öndings and those of Fern·ndez-Huertas Moraga
26:712:59235:23:24:72:540:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(2008) may be related to di§erences in the samples used in each of our studies. Both the MxFLS and
26:713:59333:24:24:72:540:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the ENET are nationally representative samples, although the ENET misses migrants in households
26:714:59428:24:24:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in which all members have migrated to the United States. According to our data, approximately
26:715:59521:24:23:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:13 percent of migrants moved to the United States together with their entire households and they
26:716:59617:23:24:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:appear to be positively selected on education and wages. Nevertheless, because of the relatively
26:717:59713:24:24:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:small fraction of migrants a§ected, this is unlikely to account for the large di§erences in our results.
26:718:59817:24:23:72:540:234:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:More important is the inclusion of migrants aged 16 to 20 in the analysis conducted by Fern·ndez-
26:719:59914:23:24:72:540:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Huertas Moraga (2008). We exclude these younger migrants in our sample because they have very
26:720:60007:24:24:72:540:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:low rates of labor market participation. The fraction of young men aged 15 to 20 who report that
26:721:60103:24:24:72:540:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:they are currently working is only 54 percent. There are also signiÖcant di§erences in labor market
26:722:60202:24:26:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:participation by migrant status: those men who ended up migrating were 11 percentage points (or
26:723:60297:26:15:80:539:113:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:25In addition, Fern·ndez-Huertas Moraga (2008) notes that part of the discrepancy between his results and those
26:724:60408:15:11:72:540:98:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:of Chiquiar and Hanson (2005) may be due to negative selection on unobserved skill, but only o§ers indirect evidence
26:725:60524:11:0:72:190:87:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:in support of this hypothesis.
27:726:60556:0:24:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:22 percent) more likely to work prior to migrating as compared to their counterparts who remain in
27:727:60654:24:24:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Mexico. Consequently, there is more evidence of negative selection on earnings and wages for these
27:728:60752:24:24:72:540:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:younger men than in our main sample of 21 to 65 year olds. However, there are no substantial
27:729:60844:24:23:72:540:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:di§erences between these samples in the pattern of selection on education.  This suggests that
27:730:60938:23:24:72:540:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:including younger men in the wage analysis may lead to substantial bias due to non-participation
27:731:61034:24:24:72:540:590:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and might explain the di§erence between our Öndings and those of Fern·ndez-Huertas Moraga
27:732:61123:24:23:72:105:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(2008).
27:733:61130:23:24:88:539:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our Öndings are also related to the debate over the role of the costs of migration that has been
27:734:61226:24:24:72:540:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:prominent in the previous literature. For example, McKenzie and Rapoport (2007) argue that their
27:735:61322:24:24:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Önding of negative selection on education in communities with large migrant networks and positive
27:736:61419:24:23:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:selection on education in communities with smaller migrant networks illustrates the important role
27:737:61517:23:24:72:540:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of costs of migration, and may be an explanation of inconsistent Öndings in other studies. However,
27:738:61616:24:24:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:this interpretation depends on the relationship between the costs of migration due to education and
27:739:61715:24:23:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:those due to migrant networks. Theory suggests that stratifying the sample by proxy variables for
27:740:61812:23:24:72:540:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:migration costs such as the size of the migrant network should yield greater evidence for negative
27:741:61910:24:24:72:540:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:selection on observed skill in both types of communities if these costs are unrelated to the costs
27:742:62008:24:24:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that can be overcome with education. Only if the presence of migrant networks eliminates all or
27:743:62103:24:23:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:most costs, and education can compensate for the absence of migrant networks, would we expect
27:744:62196:23:24:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to Önd negative selection in one type of community and positive selection in the other. Similarly,
27:745:62294:24:24:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Fern·ndez-Huertas Moraga (2008) reported negative selection on skill of migrants in urban areas,
27:746:62390:24:23:72:540:234:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:but positive selection on skill of migrants in rural areas.  An explanation for this pattern that
27:747:62487:23:24:72:540:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:depends just on the costs of migration must assume that urban locations eliminate all or most
27:748:62580:24:24:72:540:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:costs, and that education can compensate for such costs in a rural setting. Our results provide
27:749:62675:24:24:72:540:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:greater clarity on this issue. We showed directly that costs of migration play an important role in the
27:750:62778:24:23:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:migration decision, and that partially controlling for these costs results in signiÖcantly less evidence
27:751:62882:23:24:72:540:116:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of ìintermediateîselection on skills. Sample sizes prevent us from stratifying the sample based on
27:752:62980:24:0:72:540:92:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:urban/rural status, but as we showed with respect to community Öxed e§ects, urban/rural status
28:753:63076:0:24:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and the size of migration network may be correlated with both di§erential returns to migration and
28:754:63174:24:24:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:di§erent costs of migration. So stratifying the sample on the basis of community is not necessarily
28:755:63273:24:24:72:540:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a good test of the role of migration costs. Here, we used proxy variables for the costs of migration
28:756:63373:24:47:72:318:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:directly, and found evidence consistent with theory.
28:757:63425:47:35:72:174:590:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:7  Conclusion
28:758:63438:35:24:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In this paper, we presented new evidence of the nature of selection of male, Mexican migrants to
28:759:63534:24:23:72:540:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the U.S. Our analysis was based on a new data source, the Mexican Family Life Survey (MxFLS),
28:760:63627:23:24:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:which is ideally suited to study the selection of Mexican migrants. Most importantly, the MxFLS
28:761:63722:24:24:72:540:484:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:has information on the education, cognitive ability and earnings prior to migration of Mexican
28:762:63816:24:23:72:540:460:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:migrants, including those in which the entire household migrated to the U.S. These data allow
28:763:63909:23:24:72:540:437:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:us to examine the nature of selection on a more comprehensive measure of observed skill than
28:764:64001:24:24:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that used in previous studies, and to analyze the nature of selection on unobserved skill, which is
28:765:64100:24:24:72:540:389:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:something no prior study has done directly. Furthermore, the MxFLS contains variables that are
28:766:64194:24:23:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:good proxies for the costs of migration, and we use this information to help identify the pattern of
28:767:64294:23:24:72:211:342:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:selection of migrants on skill.
28:768:64325:24:24:88:539:318:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In analyses that ignore the cost of migration, we found that male, Mexican migrants were more
28:769:64418:24:23:72:540:294:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:likely to come from the middle of the distribution of observed skills regardless of whether observed
28:770:64518:23:24:72:540:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:skill was measured by education; age and education; or age, education and cognitive ability. This
28:771:64615:24:24:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Önding was robust to whether we measured observed skill using an index of skill based on annual
28:772:64710:24:24:72:540:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings or hourly wages. In contrast, we found little consistent evidence of selection of migrants
28:773:64809:24:23:72:380:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on unobserved skill as measured by residual earnings and wages.
28:774:64872:23:24:88:539:176:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our Öndings are quite di§erent once we partly control for proxy variables for the costs of
28:775:64962:24:24:72:540:152:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:migration. Adding controls for the costs of migration yields estimates that suggest no signiÖcant
28:776:65059:24:23:72:540:128:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:selection of migrants on observed skill, although estimates are somewhat imprecise. Nevertheless,
28:777:65156:23:24:72:540:105:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the substantial change in the pattern of selection when partial controls for the costs of migration
28:778:65255:24:0:72:540:81:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are included raises the possibility that analyses with more complete controls would yield evidence
29:779:65355:0:24:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of negative selection. Indeed, analyses that control for the di§erential in the return to observed skill
29:780:65459:24:24:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:between Mexico and U.S., which makes the migration decision largely depend only on variation
29:781:65551:24:24:72:540:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the costs of migration, indicate that variation in the costs of migration may be the dominant
29:782:65647:24:23:72:540:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:determinant of migration. In this analysis, estimates indicate even stronger evidence of selection
29:783:65745:23:24:72:540:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:from the middle of the observed skill distribution. Theoretically, this is due only to di§erences
29:784:65842:24:24:72:540:590:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the costs of migration that are correlated with observed skill. Notably, adding controls for the

29:786:66036:23:24:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Mexico and the U.S. again greatly diminishes the evidence in support of selection form the middle
29:787:66133:24:24:72:540:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the observed skill distribution. With respect to unobserved skill, adding controls for the costs of
29:788:66235:24:24:72:510:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:migration has little e§ect on estimates suggesting basically no selection on unobserved skill.
29:789:66329:24:23:88:539:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In sum, we presented substantial evidence to support the canonical model of migration. Mexican
29:790:66423:23:24:72:540:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:males are more likely to migrate to the U.S. when the return to observed skill is larger in the U.S.
29:791:66523:24:24:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:than in Mexico. Moreover, we showed that proxy variables for the cost of migration are strongly
29:792:66618:24:23:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:correlated with the probability of migrating and correlated with observed skill, and that controlling
29:793:66719:23:24:72:540:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for these costs diminishes, even eliminates, evidence of selection from the middle of the observed
29:794:66817:24:24:72:540:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:skill distribution. We hypothesize that more complete controls for the costs of migration may yield
29:795:66916:24:0:72:495:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:even more evidence in support of the theoretical prediction of negative selection on skill.

32:878:73510:12:12:88:539:292:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Years of completed schooling is also constructed on the basis of the roster reported on individuals by
