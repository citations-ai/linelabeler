2:18:658:28:28:56:538:592:12:Times:12:Times:B:run  demo-economic  outcomes  in  the  conventional  overlapping  generations  model  of  neoclassical 
2:19:761:28:27:56:538:564:12:Times:12:Times:B:growth  extended  with  endogenous  longevity  and  endogenous  fertility.  The  government  invests  in 
2:20:866:27:28:56:538:537:12:Times:12:Times:B:public  health  (Chakraborty,  2004)  and  the  individual  survival  probability  at  the end  of  youth 
2:21:972:28:27:56:538:509:12:Times:12:Times:B:depends on health expenditure through an S-shaped longevity function. This may give rise to four 
2:22:1069:27:28:56:538:482:12:Times:12:Times:B:steady  states  and,  hence,  development  traps  are  possible.  However,  poverty  or  prosperity may  not 
2:23:1178:28:28:56:539:454:12:Times:12:Times:B:depend on initial conditions, while being the result of a child policy design. In particular, a child tax 
2:24:1284:28:27:56:538:426:12:Times:12:Times:B:can  be  used  to  effectively  allow  those  economies  that  were  entrapped  into  poverty  to  prosper 
2:25:1391:27:28:56:237:399:12:Times:12:Times:B:irrespective of where they start from.

3:39:2419:0:28:56:137:760:12:Times:12:Times:B:1. Introduction 
3:40:2434:28:28:56:59:732:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
3:41:2434:28:27:56:538:704:12:Times:12:Times:B:Over  the  past  century  and,  in  particular,  in  the  recent  decades,  citizens  in  most  countries  in  the 
3:42:2549:27:28:56:538:677:12:Times:12:Times:B:world  have  experienced  dramatic  increases  in  life  expectancy  (e.g.,  Livi-Bacci,  1997).  The 
3:43:2651:28:28:56:538:649:12:Times:12:Times:B:importance  of  longevity  in  determining  the  macroeconomic  and  demographic  performances  of  an 
3:44:2754:28:27:56:538:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:economy over the very long run is the object of a growing body of economic literature, see, e.g., the 
3:45:2856:27:28:56:430:594:12:Times:12:Times:B:influential papers by Blackburn and Cipriani (2002) and Chakraborty (2004). 
3:46:2932:28:27:56:538:566:12:Times:12:Times:B:    In  particular,  Blackburn  and  Cipriani  (2002)  considered  a  general  equilibrium  overlapping 
3:47:3036:27:28:56:539:539:12:Times:12:Times:B:generations (OLG) economy, with endogenous fertility and endogenous longevity and three-period 
3:48:3131:28:28:56:538:511:12:Times:12:Times:B:lived individuals that accumulate human capital through education – which is the main determinant 
3:49:3229:28:27:56:538:483:12:Times:12:Times:B:of  adult  survival  probability.  Individuals  produce  and  consume  output,  invest  in  education  and 
3:50:3336:27:28:56:538:456:12:Times:12:Times:B:spend a fraction of their time endowment to take care of their descendants. A rise in the individual 
3:51:3437:28:27:56:538:428:12:Times:12:Times:B:life span creates a virtuous cycle of events on the process of development: it increases, in fact, the 
3:52:3540:27:28:56:539:401:12:Times:12:Times:B:productivity of labour by raising the returns to human capital accumulation; this causes a reduction 
3:53:3641:28:28:56:538:373:12:Times:12:Times:B:in the child bearing time as well as a rise in the time that agents devote to education; this chain of 
3:54:3744:28:27:56:538:345:12:Times:12:Times:B:events promotes human capital accumulation that causes, in turn, a reduction in both adult mortality 
3:55:3845:27:28:56:538:318:12:Times:12:Times:B:and population growth. In this context, they found that the existence of low and high development 
3:56:3943:28:27:56:538:290:12:Times:12:Times:B:regimes, the former being characterised by low income, high fertility and a relatively low length of 
3:57:4044:27:28:56:538:263:12:Times:12:Times:B:life, the latter by high income, low fertility and a relatively high length of life. Depending on initial 
3:58:4150:28:28:56:538:235:12:Times:12:Times:B:conditions, therefore, an economy may be entrapped into poverty or prosper. Their model accords 
3:59:4246:28:27:56:343:207:12:Times:12:Times:B:with the empirical evidence of the demographic transition.1 
3:60:4305:27:28:56:538:180:12:Times:12:Times:B:    Chakraborty (2004), instead, introduced endogenous lifetime in the basic Diamond’s (1965) style 
3:61:4405:28:24:56:538:152:12:Times:12:Times:B:OLG model of neoclassical growth with exogenous fertility. The probability of surviving from work 
3:62:4503:24:8:56:203:128:12:Times:12:Times:B:                                                
3:63:4550:8:27:56:538:120:6:Times:10:Times:F:1  In  a  model  with  educational  investments  and  endogenous  fertility,  Chen  (2010)  developed  an  OLG  model  showing 
3:64:4677:27:23:56:538:93:10:Times:10:Times:F:that (i) with exogenous lifetime, multiple development regimes with club convergence can exist when mortality is high 
3:65:4795:23:0:56:471:70:10:Times:10:Times:F:enough, and (ii) with endogenous lifetime, a unique stable steady state exist if mortality is low enough. 
4:66:4920:0:28:56:538:760:12:Times:12:Times:B:time to retirement time is a non-decreasing concave function of the individual health status which is 
4:67:5022:28:28:56:542:732:12:Times:12:Times:B:determined  by  public  investments.  A  rise  in  the  health  tax  to  finance  health  expenditure  may  lead 
4:68:5135:28:27:56:538:704:12:Times:12:Times:B:individuals to live longer and this, in turn, provides an impetus to capital accumulation and a higher 
4:69:5238:27:28:56:538:677:12:Times:12:Times:B:life span as well. His main finding is that, when the output elasticity of capital in the Cobb-Douglas 
4:70:5341:28:27:56:538:649:12:Times:12:Times:B:production   function   is   relatively   high,   endogenous   mortality   may   cause   development   traps 
4:71:5450:27:28:56:538:622:12:Times:12:Times:B:(represented  by  the  stable  zero  equilibrium),  so  that  low-income  high  mortality  and  high-income 
4:72:5558:28:28:56:538:594:12:Times:12:Times:B:low-morality  societies  can  exist.  Chakraborty  (2004)  considered  public health  investments  as  a 
4:73:5663:28:27:56:538:566:12:Times:12:Times:B:prerequisite  for  sustained  economic  growth  and  found  that  improving  the  health status  of  people 
4:74:5771:27:28:56:538:539:12:Times:12:Times:B:may be beneficial for growth and development because it directly reduces the risk of adult mortality 
4:75:5872:28:27:56:540:511:12:Times:12:Times:B:and this causes, in turn, an impetus to higher capital accumulation and lower adult mortality as well. 
4:76:5975:27:28:56:539:484:12:Times:12:Times:B:    As  regards  population,  it  is  well  established  that  in  recent  decades  several  developed  countries 
4:77:6089:28:28:56:538:456:12:Times:12:Times:B:have experienced dramatic drops in fertility that have produced, in turn, a reduction in the number 
4:78:6189:28:27:56:538:428:12:Times:12:Times:B:of children even well below the replacement rate (e.g., Germany, Italy, Spain and Japan), while also 
4:79:6290:27:28:56:538:401:12:Times:12:Times:B:causing  a  declining  ratio  of  economically  active  to  retired  people.  The  response  of  many 
4:80:6392:28:27:56:538:373:12:Times:12:Times:B:governments has been the implementation of child support programmes mainly based on the public 
4:81:6487:27:28:56:539:346:12:Times:12:Times:B:provision  of  child  subsidies  (e.g.,  a  direct  monetary  transfer  to  families  with  children)  in  order  to 
4:82:6604:28:28:56:538:318:12:Times:12:Times:B:incentive child care activities of households and favour the fertility recovery, even if other policies 
4:83:6708:28:27:56:539:290:12:Times:12:Times:B:such as child care facilities (e.g., investments in infrastructure for day-care centres, schools and so 
4:84:6812:27:28:56:538:263:12:Times:12:Times:B:on) and child tax credits have been adopted, especially in North European countries. However, even 
4:85:6911:28:27:56:538:235:12:Times:12:Times:B:the opposite problem of excessive population growth may represent a serious concern for economic 
4:86:7008:27:28:56:538:208:12:Times:12:Times:B:growth and sustainable development in some countries in the world. In these countries, therefore, a 
4:87:7108:28:29:56:539:180:12:Times:12:Times:B:child-tax2   policy   may   be   implemented   with   anti-natalist   purposes   to   alleviate possible 
4:88:7213:29:8:56:203:151:12:Times:12:Times:B:                                                
4:89:7260:8:27:56:538:143:6:Times:10:Times:F:2  We  note  that  while  child  support  programmes  have  been  extensively  examined  in  economic  literature  (see,  e.g., 
4:90:7388:27:23:56:538:116:10:Times:10:Times:F:Momota,  2000;  van  Groezen  et  al.,  2003;  Apps  and  Rees,  2004;  van  Groezen and  Meijdam,  2008),  the  theoretical 
4:91:7513:23:23:56:538:93:10:Times:10:Times:F:analysis  of  the  effects  of  child  taxes  on  long-run  demo-economic  performances  is,  to  the  best  of  our  knowledge, 
4:92:7642:23:0:56:538:70:10:Times:10:Times:F:relatively  scarce.  For  instance,  in  the  literature  with  endogenous  fertility,  Bental  (1989)  represents  one  of  the  first 
5:93:7869:0:28:56:538:760:12:Times:12:Times:B:environmental  problems  and  social  conflicts  that  an  excessive  population  may  cause.  This  is  the 
5:94:7978:28:28:56:538:732:12:Times:12:Times:B:well known case of the one-child policy (or, alternatively, family planning policy, see Coale, 1981) 
5:95:8079:28:27:56:538:704:12:Times:12:Times:B:enforced by the Chinese government since the 1979, which probably represents the sole example of 
5:96:8176:27:28:56:538:677:12:Times:12:Times:B:application  of  tax  penalties  for  couples  with  more  than  one  child  all over  the  world.  As  regards 
5:97:8288:28:27:56:538:649:12:Times:12:Times:B:some of the technical rules of implementation, the one-child policy restricts the number of children 
5:98:8389:27:28:56:538:622:12:Times:12:Times:B:that couples decide to have to one, although several exceptions exist, for instance, for couples living 
5:99:8493:28:28:56:538:594:12:Times:12:Times:B:in  certain  rural  areas  of  China  or  for  people  belonging  to  ethnic  minorities.  In  particular,  Chinese 
5:100:8609:28:27:56:538:566:12:Times:12:Times:B:families  subject  to  the  restrictions  of  the  family  planning  policy  must  pay  fines  based  on  their 
5:101:8721:27:28:56:538:539:12:Times:12:Times:B:income if they choose to have more than one child. The monetary penalties, however, raises more 
5:102:8817:28:27:56:538:511:12:Times:12:Times:B:than  proportionally  for  any  additional  newborn.  Of  course,  the  enforcement  of  this  policy  is 
5:103:8923:27:28:56:538:484:12:Times:12:Times:B:controversial because it had several unpleasant effects (especially as regards the moral feasibility to 
5:104:9027:28:28:56:538:456:12:Times:12:Times:B:pursue the goal of restricting the freedom of people to have children as well as some of the methods 
5:105:9128:28:27:56:541:428:12:Times:12:Times:B:adopted to realise it) that, however, we do not want to discuss in this paper since they would require 
5:106:9231:27:28:56:240:401:12:Times:12:Times:B:a more careful and thorough analysis. 
5:107:9269:28:27:56:538:373:12:Times:12:Times:B:    Moreover, as is well known at least starting from the seminal paper by Becker (1960), economic 
5:108:9368:27:28:56:542:346:12:Times:12:Times:B:literature  has  argued  that  the  choice  of  the  number  of  children  should  be  the  result  of  a  rational 
5:109:9484:28:28:56:538:318:12:Times:12:Times:B:choice of individuals, especially in developed economies.3 In particular, the theoretical literature on 
5:110:9588:28:24:56:538:290:12:Times:12:Times:B:endogenous  fertility  is  of  greater  importance  in  the  theory  of  economic  growth  (e.g.,  Becker  and 
5:111:9699:24:12:56:541:266:12:Times:12:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                            
5:112:9854:12:23:56:539:254:10:Times:10:Times:F:attempt  to  discuss,  amongst  other  things,  the  effects  of  the  child  tax  instrument  in  a  model  where  children  are 
5:113:9984:23:23:56:538:231:10:Times:10:Times:F:considered as a capital good that furnish services to retired parents (i.e., the old-age security hypothesis), and concluded 
5:114:10109:23:23:56:538:208:10:Times:10:Times:F:that a tax on children can achieve the optimal capital-labour ratio but fails, however, to realise the optimal population 
5:115:10231:23:23:56:539:185:10:Times:10:Times:F:growth rate. Recently, Fanti and Gori (2009) have shown that a child tax can be used to actually raise population growth 
5:116:10352:23:19:56:273:162:10:Times:10:Times:F:in the long run, while also raising income per worker. 
5:117:10407:19:27:56:538:143:6:Times:10:Times:F:3  For  instance,  van  Groezen  et  al.  (2003,  p.  237)  argued  that  “The  rate  of  fertility  should  therefore  be  treated  as  an

5:119:10677:23:23:56:538:93:10:Times:10:Times:F:incentives. Economic theory can thus help in explaining why the observed decline in the (desired) number of children 
5:120:10794:23:0:56:115:70:10:Times:10:Times:F:would occur.” 
6:121:10827:0:28:56:538:760:12:Times:12:Times:B:Barro, 1988; Barro and Becker, 1989), even as an explanation of multiple regimes of developments 
6:122:10924:28:28:56:499:732:12:Times:12:Times:B:when human capital is considered (e.g., Becker et al., 1990; Blackburn and Cipriani, 2002). 
6:123:11016:28:27:56:538:704:12:Times:12:Times:B:    This  paper  represents  a  first  attempt  to  introduce  endogenous fertility  (with  children  being 
6:124:11124:27:28:56:538:677:12:Times:12:Times:B:considered   as   a   desirable   good)   in   the   basic   OLG   model   with   endogenous   lifetime   à   la 
6:125:11237:28:27:56:538:649:12:Times:12:Times:B:Chakraborty.4 Different from Chakraborty (2004), however, we consider a more general (S-shaped) 
6:126:11333:27:28:56:538:622:12:Times:12:Times:B:longevity function of health capital and find that development traps with a positive stock of capital 
6:127:11435:28:28:56:538:594:12:Times:12:Times:B:–  and,  hence,  positive  levels  of  production  and  consumption  –  are  possible.5  This  certainly 
6:128:11540:28:27:56:492:566:12:Times:12:Times:B:represents an interesting point, especially as regards the empirical relevance of the results. 
6:129:11635:27:28:56:538:539:12:Times:12:Times:B:    Moreover,  in  this  paper  attention  essentially  is  focused  on  the  crucial  role  that  family  policies, 
6:130:11752:28:27:56:538:511:12:Times:12:Times:B:consisting  in  either  a  tax  or  subsidy  on  children,  can  play  on  both  the  transitional  dynamics  and 
6:131:11866:27:28:56:538:484:12:Times:12:Times:B:demo-economic  outcomes  over  the  very  long  run.  The  main  finding  is  that  poverty  or  prosperity 
6:132:11974:28:28:56:538:456:12:Times:12:Times:B:may not depend on initial conditions, while being the result of a child policy design. In particular, a 
6:133:12078:28:27:56:538:428:12:Times:12:Times:B:large  enough  increase  in  the  child  tax  reduces  both  fertility  and  adult mortality.  This  stimulates 
6:134:12190:27:28:56:538:401:12:Times:12:Times:B:capital accumulation and eliminate the low equilibrium so that an economy that were entrapped into 
6:135:12289:28:27:56:538:373:12:Times:12:Times:B:poverty due to unfavourable initial conditions will converge towards the unique high development 
6:136:12386:27:28:56:466:346:12:Times:12:Times:B:regime, where income per worker is high, life expectancy is high and fertility is low. 
6:137:12473:28:28:56:538:318:12:Times:12:Times:B:    The  present  paper  is  differentiated  from  each  of  the  above  mentioned  contributions  in  terms  its 
6:138:12587:28:27:56:538:290:12:Times:12:Times:B:specific  objectives,  analyses  and  results.  From  a  broader  perspective,  our  paper  belongs  to  the 
6:139:12696:27:28:56:538:263:12:Times:12:Times:B:demo-economic literature that treats the key demographic variables – i.e. fertility and longevity – as 
6:140:12799:28:27:56:539:235:12:Times:12:Times:B:endogenously  determined  in  the  model  rather  than  exogenously  given,  and  links  them into  the 
6:141:12903:27:34:56:538:208:12:Times:12:Times:B:process  of  economic  growth  in  the  simple  and  intuitive  context  of  the  standard  OLG  model  (e.g. 
6:142:13013:34:8:56:203:174:12:Times:12:Times:B:                                                
6:143:13060:8:27:56:538:166:6:Times:10:Times:F:4  Blackburn  and  Cipriani  (2002),  in  fact,  assumed  human  capital  accumulation  through  education,  rather  than  public 
6:144:13190:27:19:56:408:139:10:Times:10:Times:F:health care investments, as the main determinant of the surviving probability of people. 
6:145:13279:19:27:56:538:120:6:Times:10:Times:F:5 Blackrun and Issa (2002) noted the importance of the existence of a low equilibrium with positive levels of production 
6:146:13400:27:23:56:538:93:10:Times:10:Times:F:and consumption, and introduced bequests in an OLG growth model with exogenous fertility and uncertain lifetimes to 
6:147:13516:23:0:56:269:70:10:Times:10:Times:F:avoid degeneracy in a low development equilibrium. 
7:148:13658:0:28:56:538:760:12:Times:12:Times:B:Zhang  et  al.,  2001).  This  paper  may  also  be  viewed  as  a  contribution  to  the  wider  literature  on 
7:149:13771:28:28:56:538:732:12:Times:12:Times:B:multiple  equilibria,  poverty  traps  and  demographic  changes  over  the  very  long  run  (e.g.  Azariadis 
7:150:13882:28:27:56:151:704:12:Times:12:Times:B:and Drazen, 1990). 
7:151:13901:27:28:56:538:677:12:Times:12:Times:B:    The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we set up the model. In Section 
7:152:14002:28:27:56:538:649:12:Times:12:Times:B:3  we  study  the  dynamic  path  of  capital  accumulation  and  provide  necessary  conditions  for  the 
7:153:14109:27:28:56:538:622:12:Times:12:Times:B:existence  of  multiple  (four)  steady  states.  In  Section  4  we  analyse  the  effects  of  child  policies  on 
7:154:14226:28:28:56:396:594:12:Times:12:Times:B:economic growth and the stages of development. Section 5 concludes. 
7:155:14294:28:27:56:59:566:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
7:156:14294:27:28:56:125:539:12:Times:12:Times:B:2. The model

7:158:14307:28:27:56:538:483:12:Times:12:Times:B:Consider  a  general  equilibrium  overlapping  generations  (OLG)  closed  economy populated  by 
7:159:14405:27:28:56:538:456:12:Times:12:Times:B:identical individuals, identical firms and a government that runs both health and child polices at  a 
7:160:14507:28:27:56:140:428:12:Times:12:Times:B:balanced budget. 
7:161:14524:27:28:56:542:401:12:Times:12:Times:B:    The lifetime of the typical agent is divided into childhood and adulthood, the latter being, in turn, 
7:162:14630:28:28:56:538:373:12:Times:12:Times:B:divided  into  working  time  (youth)  and  retirement  time  (old  age).  As  a child  she  does  not  make 
7:163:14739:28:27:56:538:345:12:Times:12:Times:B:economic  decisions.  When  adult  she  draws  utility  from  consumption  over  the  life  cycle  and  the 
7:164:14847:27:29:56:158:318:12:Times:12:Times:B:number of children.6 
7:165:14867:29:31:56:538:289:12:Times:12:Times:B:    Young individuals of generation t (tN) are endowed with one unit of time supplied inelastically 
7:166:14967:31:31:56:436:258:12:Times:12:Times:B:on the labour market, while receiving wage income at the competitive rate tw. 
7:167:15045:31:28:56:538:227:12:Times:12:Times:B:    It  is  assumed  that  the  probability  of  surviving  from  youth  to  old  age is  endogenous  and 
7:168:15151:28:28:56:538:199:12:Times:12:Times:B:determined  by  the  individual  health  level,  that  is,  in  turn,  augmented  by the  public  provision  of 
7:169:15263:28:27:56:538:171:12:Times:12:Times:B:health  investments  such  as,  for  instance,  hospitals,  vaccination  programmes  and  so  on  (see 
7:170:15366:27:16:56:538:144:12:Times:12:Times:B:Chakraborty,  2004).  The  survival  probability  at  the  end  of  youth  of  an  individual entered  the 
7:171:15473:16:8:56:203:128:12:Times:12:Times:B:                                                
7:172:15520:8:27:56:538:120:6:Times:10:Times:F:6  See  Eckstein  and Wolpin  (1985) and  Galor and Weil  (1996).  Note  that  the  way  of modelling  children  as  a  desirable 
7:173:15650:27:23:56:538:93:10:Times:10:Times:F:good  that  directly  enters  the  parents’  utility  has  been  called  by  Zhang  and  Zhang  (1998)  a  weak  form  of  altruism 
7:174:15782:23:0:56:128:70:10:Times:10:Times:F:towards children.

8:177:16030:31:28:56:538:696:12:Times:12:Times:B:and  Issa  (2002),  we  model  this  relationship  with  the  following  rather general  function  of  health

8:236:16471:27:29:56:538:455:12:Times:12:Times:B:agent  as  a  function  of  the  individual  health  measure h:  it  encompasses,  in  fact,  the  “saturating” 
8:237:16583:29:31:56:538:426:12:Times:12:Times:B:function used in the numerical examples by Chakraborty (2004) when 1=∆=δ and 00=π as well

8:239:16779:28:29:56:538:367:12:Times:12:Times:B:positive constant rate of longevity regardless of public health spending. Some clarifications on Eq. 
8:240:16880:29:30:56:538:338:12:Times:12:Times:B:(1)  are  now  useful.  First,  we  define 0π  as  being  an  exogenous  measure  of  the  “natural”  rate  of 
8:241:16991:30:28:56:538:308:12:Times:12:Times:B:longevity of people in a country (see, e.g., Ehrlich, 2000; Leung and Wang, 2010): it represents the 
8:242:17092:28:28:56:541:280:12:Times:12:Times:B:“biological” individual survival probability at the end of the working period irrespective of whether 
8:243:17194:28:32:56:538:252:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  government  invests  in  public  health  or  not.  This  measure  of  individual  mortality  of  the  adult 
8:244:17307:32:8:56:203:220:12:Times:12:Times:B:                                                
8:245:17354:8:27:56:538:212:6:Times:10:Times:F:7  Although  the  independent  variable  of  the  longevity  function  in  the  analysis  by  Blackburn  and  Cipriani  (2002)  is 
8:246:17485:27:23:56:538:185:10:Times:10:Times:F:human capital instead of public health capital, the line of reasoning to justify this formulation may be the same. To this 
8:247:17608:23:23:56:538:162:10:Times:10:Times:F:purpose,  in  fact,  and  to  capture  the  idea  that  life  expectancy  is  positively  correlated  with  the  level  of  development, 
8:248:17745:23:23:56:538:139:10:Times:10:Times:F:Blackburn and Issa (2002) argued, in the first part of their paper, that the probability of surviving at the end of youth is 
8:249:17870:23:23:56:538:116:10:Times:10:Times:F:non-decreasing  bounded  function  of  the  stock  capital  installed  in  the  economy  (and  used  a  stepwise  function  of  the 
8:250:18002:23:23:56:538:93:10:Times:10:Times:F:stock of capital to show the possibility of multiple development regimes), while introducing, in the second part of the 
8:251:18122:23:0:56:462:70:10:Times:10:Times:F:paper, an S-shaped function to justify the relationship between longevity and public health spending. 
9:252:18315:0:28:56:538:760:12:Times:12:Times:B:may  be  thought  to  be  affected  by  both  economic  and non-economic  factors,  e.g.  the  lifestyle  of 
9:253:18424:28:28:56:538:732:12:Times:12:Times:B:people,  education,  economic  growth  and  the  standards  of  living,  the  degree  of  culture  and 
9:254:18527:28:28:56:538:704:12:Times:12:Times:B:civilisation,  weather  and  climate  changes,  ethnical  and  civil  wars,  endemic  diseases  and  so  on 
9:255:18635:28:31:56:538:676:12:Times:12:Times:B:(which are, however, left exogenous in the present context8). Thus, we may expect 0π to be higher 
9:256:18733:31:28:56:538:645:12:Times:12:Times:B:in developed rather than developing or under-developed nations, and the more individuals naturally 
9:257:18832:28:28:56:538:617:12:Times:12:Times:B:live  longer, the  smaller  the reduction  in  adult mortality  when  the  public  health  expenditure  raises. 
9:258:18944:28:31:56:538:589:12:Times:12:Times:B:Second,  the  parameter 1π  captures  the  intensity  of  the  efficiency  of  health  capital  on  the  rate  of 
9:259:19058:31:30:56:538:558:12:Times:12:Times:B:longevity.  A  rise  in 1π  may  be  interpreted  as  exogenous  medical  advances  due,  for  instance,  to 
9:260:19167:30:28:56:538:528:12:Times:12:Times:B:scientific  research,  vaccination  programmes  and  so on.  Third,  we  may  think,  realistically,  that 
9:261:19274:28:27:56:538:500:12:Times:12:Times:B:health investments have a more intense effect in reducing adult mortality when a certain threshold 
9:262:19373:27:28:56:541:473:12:Times:12:Times:B:level of health capital is achieved, while becoming scarcely effective when longevity is close to its 
9:263:19475:28:27:56:539:445:12:Times:12:Times:B:saturating  value  (e.g.,  the  functional  relationship  between  public  health  expenditure  and  longevity 
9:264:19586:27:29:56:539:418:12:Times:12:Times:B:may be S-shaped). The parameters δ and ∆ allow to capture such an idea and determine both the 
9:265:19680:29:32:56:538:389:12:Times:12:Times:B:turning point of ()hhπ′ and speed of convergence from the natural length of life 0π to the saturating 
9:266:19782:32:30:56:539:357:12:Times:12:Times:B:value 1π.  In  particular,  given  the  value  of ∆,9  the  parameter δ  may  represent  the  degree  of 
9:267:19887:30:27:56:538:327:12:Times:12:Times:B:effectiveness of public health investments as an inducement to higher longevity, other things being 
9:268:19987:27:29:56:538:300:12:Times:12:Times:B:unchanged. In other words, it measures how an additional unit of health capital is transformed into 
9:269:20087:29:31:56:538:271:12:Times:12:Times:B:higher longevity through the health technology. If 1≤δ, ()hπ is concave for any h and, hence, no 
9:270:20184:31:32:56:541:240:12:Times:12:Times:B:threshold effects exist so that longevity increases less than proportionally from the starting point 0π 
9:271:20287:32:29:56:539:208:12:Times:12:Times:B:to  the  saturating  value 1π  as h  rises,  and  the  more δ  is  close  to  zero  the  more  efficiently  and 
9:272:20399:29:20:56:538:179:12:Times:12:Times:B:rapidly an additional unit of health capital is transformed into higher longevity when h is relatively

9:274:20549:10:7:56:197:149:6:Times:10:Times:F:8 The endogenous determination of 
9:275:20583:7:24:209:538:142:7:Times:10:Times:F:0π in the longevity function Eq. (1) may give rise to interesting findings as regards 
9:276:20669:24:21:56:371:118:10:Times:10:Times:F:the dynamical features of the model that are, however, left for future research. 
9:277:20750:21:27:56:539:97:6:Times:10:Times:F:9 In the numerical example presented throughout the paper, we used 1=∆ without loss of generality, given the purely 
9:278:20866:27:0:56:354:70:10:Times:10:Times:F:technical (and not economically interpretable) nature of such a parameter. 
10:279:20960:0:31:56:538:759:12:Times:12:Times:B:low, while reaching the saturating value 1π more slowly as h becomes larger. Figure 1 illustrates in 
10:280:21061:31:30:56:538:728:12:Times:12:Times:B:a  stylised  way  the  function ()hπ  when 1≤δ:  the  solid  (dashed)  [dotted]  line  refers  to  the  case 
10:281:21170:30:28:76:538:698:12:Times:12:Times:A:1=δ  (1<δ)  [0→δ].  As  can  readily  be  seen  from  Figure  1,  the  lower (higher) δ  is  the  more 
10:282:21273:28:28:56:539:670:12:Times:12:Times:B:(less) efficiently an additional unit of health capital is transformed into higher longevity until (once) 
10:283:21379:28:28:56:207:642:12:Times:12:Times:B:a certain level of h is reached.

10:288:21468:28:29:56:538:245:12:Times:12:Times:B:In contrast, when 1>δ the longevity function is S-shaped and threshold effects exist. In particular, 
10:289:21569:29:30:56:539:216:12:Times:12:Times:B:longevity  increases  more  (less)  than  proportionally  until  (once)  the  turning  point Th  is  achieved. 
10:290:21680:30:29:56:538:186:12:Times:12:Times:B:However,  a  rise  in δ  shifts  the  longevity  function  to  the  right  while  also  increasing  the  speed  of 
10:291:21795:29:32:56:538:157:12:Times:12:Times:B:convergence  from 0π  to 1π,  as  clearly  shown  in  Figure  2,  where  the  solid  (dashed)  [dotted]  line 
10:292:21905:32:31:56:538:125:12:Times:12:Times:B:refers to lowδ (highδ) [+∞→δ]. This means that the more threshold effects are intense (high values 
10:293:22004:31:0:56:541:94:12:Times:12:Times:B:of δ), the slower an additional unit of health capital is transformed into a higher life span when h 
11:294:22196:0:30:56:538:759:12:Times:12:Times:B:is relatively low, while reaching the saturating value 1π more efficiently and rapidly as h becomes

11:300:22360:28:28:56:538:332:12:Times:12:Times:B:In other words, increasing public health investments is not effective until a threshold value of health 
11:301:22464:28:28:56:538:304:12:Times:12:Times:B:capital is achieved (and this value is larger the larger is δ), because, for instance, a certain degree 
11:302:22568:28:27:56:538:276:12:Times:12:Times:B:of knowledge to enable such investments to be effectively transformed into higher longevity has not 
11:303:22668:27:52:56:150:249:12:Times:12:Times:B:yet been reached.10

11:305:22734:8:27:56:538:189:6:Times:10:Times:F:10 As an example, we may think about the existence of threshold effects in the accumulation of knowledge required for 
11:306:22852:27:23:56:538:162:10:Times:10:Times:F:new  medical  advances  and  discoveries  in  the  treatment  of  diseases  (e.g.  vaccines)  to  be  effective:  the  public  health 
11:307:22986:23:23:56:538:139:10:Times:10:Times:F:expenditure to finance new research projects may be high and apparently useless until a certain degree of knowledge is 
11:308:23105:23:23:56:538:116:10:Times:10:Times:F:achieved.  Beyond  such  a  threshold,  however,  a  “sudden”  effect  exists  that  allows  to  trigger  and  bring  to  light  the 
11:309:23238:23:23:56:538:93:10:Times:10:Times:F:beneficial effects of the new discoveries, to make them efficient, usable and operative across population and eventually 
11:310:23359:23:0:56:196:70:10:Times:10:Times:F:transformed into higher longevity. 
12:311:23414:0:28:56:538:760:12:Times:12:Times:B:    As  in  Chakraborty  (2004),  we  assume  that  health  capital  per  worker  at t  is  augmented  through 
12:312:23525:28:28:56:538:732:12:Times:12:Times:B:public  investments  financed  at  a  balanced  budget  with  a  (constant)  proportional  wage  income  tax 
12:313:23634:28:29:92:140:704:12:Times:12:Times:A:10<<τ, that is:

12:315:23662:31:28:56:539:644:12:Times:12:Times:B:    As  regards  child  care  activities,  we  assume  that  raising  children  is  costly  and,  in  particular,  the 
12:316:23781:28:31:56:538:616:12:Times:12:Times:B:amount of resources needed to take care of them  is given by a monetary cost twq per child, with 
12:317:23878:31:30:92:538:585:12:Times:12:Times:A:10<<q being the percentage of child-rearing cost on the parents’ working income.11 Moreover, we 
12:318:23974:30:28:56:538:555:12:Times:12:Times:B:assume  that  in  every  period  the  government  finances  a  wage  income  subsidy  be  levying  a  fixed 
12:319:24082:28:28:56:538:527:12:Times:12:Times:B:child tax for each newborn at a balanced budget.12 Therefore, at time t the per worker child policy 
12:320:24182:28:28:56:224:499:12:Times:12:Times:B:budget of the government reads as 
12:321:24216:28:31:56:541:471:12:Times:12:Times:B: ttttnwbw=θ, (3) 
12:322:24232:31:28:56:538:440:12:Times:12:Times:B:the left-hand side being the wage subsidy expenditure and the right-hand side the child tax receipt, 
12:323:24333:28:29:56:538:412:12:Times:12:Times:B:where 0>b  is  the  fixed  percentage  of  wage  income  collected  by  the  government  as  a  tax  for  an 
12:324:24442:29:32:56:538:383:12:Times:12:Times:B:additional  newborn, 0>tθ  is  the  wage  subsidy  rate  adjusted  over  time  to  balance  out  the  budget 
12:325:24551:32:30:56:293:351:12:Times:12:Times:B:and tn the average number of children at time t. 
12:326:24600:30:28:56:539:321:12:Times:12:Times:B:    Therefore, in period t the budget constraint faced by an individual of the younger working-age 
12:327:24699:28:29:56:229:293:12:Times:12:Times:B:(child-bearing) generation reads as:

12:330:24819:8:27:56:538:189:6:Times:10:Times:F:11  This  child cost  structure is  similar  to  that  adopted, amongst many  others, by  Wigger  (1999) and  Boldrin  and  Jones 
12:331:24949:27:19:56:337:162:10:Times:10:Times:F:(2002) and may be considered as a proxy of the time cost of children. 
12:332:25018:19:27:56:538:143:6:Times:10:Times:F:12  For  instance,  the  tax  penalties  imposed  by  the  Chinese  birth  planning  programme  on  parents  with  multiple 
12:333:25142:27:23:56:538:116:10:Times:10:Times:F:descendants  are  computed  as  a  fraction  of  either  the  disposable income  of  people  living  in  urban  areas  or  the  cash

12:335:25413:23:0:56:297:70:10:Times:10:Times:F:children that exceeds the quota planned by the government.

13:337:25664:29:36:56:539:731:12:Times:12:Times:B:financed with the fixed child tax – is divided into material consumption when young, tc,1, savings,

14:427:27320:28:28:56:538:652:12:Times:12:Times:B:on  both  the  transitional  dynamics  and  demo-economic  outcomes  over  the  very  long  run,  it  is  first 
14:428:27432:28:28:56:538:624:12:Times:12:Times:B:interesting to briefly notice the role played by b in a partial equilibrium context. In particular, a rise 
14:429:27539:28:27:56:538:596:12:Times:12:Times:B:in  the  child  tax  increases  the  marginal  cost  of  bearing  an  extra  child  and  then  makes  more 
14:430:27646:27:28:56:538:569:12:Times:12:Times:B:convenient to substitute children with consumption. From Eqs. (7.1) and (7.2), in fact, we observe 
14:431:27745:28:27:56:538:541:12:Times:12:Times:B:that  as  a  direct  partial  equilibrium  effect  a  higher  child  tax  reduces  the  demand  for  children  and 
14:432:27860:27:28:56:145:514:12:Times:12:Times:B:increases savings. 
14:433:27879:28:28:56:539:486:12:Times:12:Times:B:    In  the  following  section  we  introduce  production  and  characterise  the  general  equilibrium

17:656:32069:40:31:56:538:597:12:Times:12:Times:B:From  (12.2),  it  is  straightforward  to  see  that ()xkf,  admits  at  most  three  roots  for x  and 
17:657:32174:31:31:67:539:566:12:Symbol:12:Times:A:()00,≠kf.  Hence,  from  (12.1), ()kGkk′′  admits  at  most  three  roots  for k  and ()00≠′′kkG.  This 
17:658:32278:31:28:56:120:535:12:Times:12:Times:B:proves (1.v). 
17:659:32292:28:28:56:59:507:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
17:660:32292:28:28:56:538:479:12:Times:12:Times:B:Proposition  1  therefore  follows.  In  fact,  by  properties  (1.i)  and  (1.iii),  zero  is  always  an  unstable 
17:661:32409:28:30:56:538:451:12:Times:12:Times:B:steady  state  of  Eq.  (10.2).  By  (1.ii)-(1.iv), ()kG  is  a  monotonic  increasing  function  of k  and 
17:662:32517:30:28:56:541:421:12:Times:12:Times:B:eventually  falls  below  the  45°  line,  so  that  at  least  one  positive  stable  steady  state  exists  for  any 
17:663:32636:28:28:77:90:393:12:Times:12:Times:A:0>k. 
17:664:32641:28:27:56:539:365:12:Times:12:Times:B:    Now,  assume ad  absurdum  the  existence  of  an  odd  number  of  equilibria.  By  (1.ii)-(1.iv),  the 
17:665:32750:27:29:56:538:338:12:Times:12:Times:B:inflection points cannot be odd-numbered for any 0>k. By property (1.v), therefore, the number of 
17:666:32848:29:31:56:538:309:12:Times:12:Times:B:inflection  points  of ()kG  is  either  zero  or  two  for  any 0>k.  Since  at  least  one  positive  stable 
17:667:32959:31:30:56:539:278:12:Times:12:Times:B:steady state exists, then for any 0>k the phase map ()kG may intersect the 45° line from below at 
17:668:33057:30:27:56:539:248:12:Times:12:Times:B:most  once  before  falling  below  it.  Hence,  an  even  number  of  equilibria  must  necessarily  exist.  In 
17:669:33170:27:28:56:538:221:12:Times:12:Times:B:particular,  the  steady  states  are  either  two,  with the  positive  one  being  the  unique  asymptotically 
17:670:33283:28:27:56:538:193:12:Times:12:Times:B:stable  equilibrium,  or at  most  one  positive  steady  state  separates  the  lowest  asymptotically  stable 
17:671:33395:27:29:56:530:166:12:Times:12:Times:B:steady state from the highest asymptotically stable one, and, thus, the number of equilibria is four. 
17:672:33497:29:32:56:538:137:12:Times:12:Times:B:    Moreover, from Eqs. (12.1) and (12.2) we observe that if 02>Λ and 03>Λ then no inflection 
17:673:33591:32:0:56:538:105:12:Times:12:Times:B:points of ()kG exist for any 0>k, ()0<′′kGkk and two steady states exist in that case. In contrast, 
18:674:33711:0:31:67:538:759:12:Symbol:12:Times:A:()kG  has  two  inflection  points  for  any 0>k  if  at  least  either 02<Λ  or 03<Λ  is  fulfilled  and, 
18:675:33818:31:28:56:321:728:12:Times:12:Times:B:hence, four steady states can exist in that case. Q.E.D.

18:677:33874:28:27:56:538:672:12:Times:12:Times:B:Proposition  1  says  that  multiple  development  regimes  are  possible  when  longevity  is  endogenous

18:681:34227:31:28:56:539:558:12:Times:12:Times:B:model  with  exogenous  fertility.  The  assumption  of  a  positive  natural  rate  of  longevity,  however, 
18:682:34337:28:28:56:538:530:12:Times:12:Times:B:exposes the economy to a dramatic change: the zero equilibrium – which is a catching point when 
18:683:34433:28:35:82:538:502:12:Times:12:Times:A:00=π  and  the  output  elasticity  of  capital  is  high  enough  –  becomes  always  unstable  when 
18:684:34535:35:28:106:538:467:7:Times:12:Times:A:100ππ<<, and the number of steady states passes from three to four, thus making certainly more 
18:685:34630:28:28:56:538:439:12:Times:12:Times:B:plausible the comparison of demo-economic performances between low and high income countries. 
18:686:34724:28:27:56:538:411:12:Times:12:Times:B:In fact, although the existence of a stable zero equilibrium where the economy is collapsed to may 
18:687:34823:27:28:56:538:384:12:Times:12:Times:B:be  a  useful  abstraction  to  represent  poorer  economies,  it  certainly  suffers  from  a  sort  of  lack  of 
18:688:34938:28:27:56:382:356:12:Times:12:Times:B:realism, especially as regards the empirical relevance of the results. 
18:689:35009:27:28:56:538:329:12:Times:12:Times:B:    Proposition  1  provides  sufficient  conditions  to  avoid  development  traps  and  necessary  but  not 
18:690:35119:28:28:56:538:301:12:Times:12:Times:B:sufficient conditions to have multiple steady states, which depend – as can be ascertained from Eq. 
18:691:35219:28:28:56:541:273:12:Times:12:Times:B:(12.2)  –  on  the  key  parameters  of  the  problem  and  the  policy  variable τ.  However,  as  extensive 
18:692:35329:28:17:56:539:245:12:Times:12:Times:B:numerical simulations revealed, the existence of multiple regimes of development crucially depends

18:727:35802:38:24:56:538:94:10:Times:10:Times:F:rate  of  longevity  regardless  of  public  health  spending.  Moreover,  note  that  values  of b  for  which  we  have  a  unique 
18:728:35935:24:0:56:426:70:10:Times:10:Times:F:steady state or multiplicity of steady states are indeed consistent with positive consumption.

19:730:36226:28:29:56:541:732:12:Times:12:Times:B:effectiveness of public health investments on longevity (δ). In particular, for any given value of δ 
19:731:36326:29:27:56:538:703:12:Times:12:Times:B:development  traps  are  more  likely  to  occur  when  production  is  relatively  capital-oriented  (high 
19:732:36434:27:28:56:538:676:12:Times:12:Times:B:values of α). In particular, when 1=δ multiple steady states appear when α exceeds 2/1,16 and 
19:733:36528:28:28:56:538:648:12:Times:12:Times:B:this threshold monotonically shrinks as δ raises. Therefore, when threshold effects of health capital 
19:734:36630:28:28:56:539:620:12:Times:12:Times:B:on  longevity  exist  (i.e. 1>δ),  a  wider  range  of  economies  is  prone  to  be  characterised  by 
19:735:36734:28:28:56:538:592:12:Times:12:Times:B:development traps, since the output elasticity of capital that discriminates between a unique regime 
19:736:36835:28:27:56:539:564:12:Times:12:Times:B:and  multiple  regimes  of  development  is  empirically more  plausible  and  smaller  than  one  half  (as 
19:737:36944:27:29:56:255:537:12:Times:12:Times:B:shown in the numerical example below). 
19:738:36983:29:31:56:538:508:12:Times:12:Times:B:    Now,  assume  that  economies  exclusively  differ  as  regards  the  initial  condition 0k.  Figure  3 
19:739:37091:31:27:56:538:477:12:Times:12:Times:B:depicts in a stylised way all the possible outcomes of an economy with endogenous longevity and 
19:740:37187:27:30:56:538:450:12:Times:12:Times:B:endogenous  fertility.  The  figure  clearly  shows  that  an  economy  that  starts  below  the  unstable 
19:741:37294:30:31:56:538:420:12:Times:12:Times:B:equilibrium 2k  is  entrapped  into  the  low  regime  (1k) where  income  per  worker  is  low,  fertility  is 
19:742:37406:31:32:56:538:389:12:Times:12:Times:B:high  and  mortality  is  high. In  contrast,  an  economy  that  starts  beyond  the  threshold 2k  converges 
19:743:37517:32:32:56:538:357:12:Times:12:Times:B:towards the high regime (3k) where income per worker is high, fertility is low and mortality is low. 
19:744:37618:32:31:56:526:325:12:Times:12:Times:B:Therefore, as expected, an exogenous shift in 0k may cause a change in the development regime. 
19:745:37713:31:19:56:59:294:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
19:746:37713:19:8:56:203:275:12:Times:12:Times:B:                                                
19:747:37760:8:27:56:538:267:6:Times:10:Times:F:16 This result is in accord with Chakraborty (2004, Proposition 1, (i), p. 126). By passing we note that Bunzel and Qiao 
19:748:37881:27:24:56:541:240:10:Times:10:Times:F:(2005)  have  shown that  the  second  part of  Proposition  1  (i)  by  Chakraborty “is  incorrectly  stated”  (Bunzel  and  Qiao, 
19:749:38013:24:26:56:538:216:10:Times:10:Times:F:2005, p. 4),  because 2/1>α  represents  a  necessary  but  not  sufficient  condition  for the  existence  of multiple  steady 
19:750:38141:26:25:56:538:190:10:Times:10:Times:F:states  (a  high  value  of  the  scale  parameter A  of  course  is  required  to  avoid  the  existence  of  a  unique,  degenerate 
19:751:38275:25:23:56:538:165:10:Times:10:Times:F:equilibrium  in  that  case).  However,  it  still  remains  true  that  when 2/1>α  three  steady  states can  exist,  so  that  the 
19:752:38409:23:25:56:538:142:10:Times:10:Times:F:central result by Chakraborty (2004) is kept unaltered even after the critique by Bunzel and Qiao (2005). It is important 
19:753:38531:25:24:56:539:117:10:Times:10:Times:F:to note, however, that since 0=k is a catching point in such a context, high values A can drastically reduce the basin 
19:754:38650:24:23:56:538:93:10:Times:10:Times:F:of attraction towards the low stable equilibrium, but the possibility to eliminate the poverty trap does not exist whatever

20:759:38868:28:29:56:539:419:12:Times:12:Times:B:    A  numerical  experiment  to  illustrate  Proposition  1  now  follows.  We  take  the  parameter  values 
20:760:38978:29:31:56:538:390:12:Times:12:Times:B:(chosen  only  for  illustrative  purposes) 5.10=A, 33.0=α,17 30.0=γ, 30.00=π, 95.01=π, 
20:761:39065:31:31:76:538:359:12:Times:12:Times:A:10=δ, 1=∆, 14.0=q, 10.0=τ  and 0=b.  Therefore,  the  low  regime  is  characterised  by  the 
20:762:39158:31:32:56:538:328:12:Times:12:Times:B:equilibrium  values 105.11=k, ()325.01=kπ  and ()186.11=kn,  and  the  high  regime  instead  by 
20:763:39255:32:33:89:539:296:12:Times:12:Times:A:324.43=k, ()812.03=kπ  and ()912.03=kn.  The  unstable  equilibrium  that  discriminates  between 
20:764:39353:33:30:56:539:263:12:Times:12:Times:B:poor  and  rich  countries  is 834.22=k.  Therefore,  an  economy  that  for  some  exogenous  reasons 
20:765:39456:30:27:56:539:233:12:Times:12:Times:B:starts with a stock of capital below (beyond) such a threshold level of development will end up in 
20:766:39555:27:28:56:538:206:12:Times:12:Times:B:the low (high) regime, where income per worker is low (high) and mortality and fertility rates are 
20:767:39654:28:28:56:526:178:12:Times:12:Times:B:high (low), confirming some of the most striking aspects of the so-called demographic transition. 
20:768:39752:28:27:56:538:150:12:Times:12:Times:B:    But  this  is  not  the  end  of  the  story,  however, since  poverty  or  prosperity  may  not  depend  on 
20:769:39865:27:15:56:538:123:12:Times:12:Times:B:initial conditions. A value added of this paper, in fact, grounds on the importance of determining the

20:771:40014:10:28:56:538:98:6:Times:10:Times:F:17  We  used 33.0=α  as  it  is  usually  assumed  in  literature  (for  estimates  of α  in  several  countries  see,  e.g.,  Jones, 
20:772:40147:28:0:56:85:70:10:Times:10:Times:F:2003).

21:774:40343:28:28:56:538:732:12:Times:12:Times:B:outcomes of the economy. The next section deals with this argument and the main finding is that a 
21:775:40441:28:28:56:542:704:12:Times:12:Times:B:large  enough  increase  in  the  child  tax  is  sufficient  to  eliminate  the  vicious  cycle  and  ill-health  of 
21:776:40559:28:27:56:538:676:12:Times:12:Times:B:poverty, thus allowing those economies that were entrapped into poverty due to unfavourable initial 
21:777:40659:27:28:56:315:649:12:Times:12:Times:B:conditions to end up in the high development regime.

21:782:40840:27:28:56:538:511:12:Times:12:Times:B:often  been  suggested  both  by  politicians  and  economists  as  a  remedy  against  below-replacement 
21:783:40946:28:28:56:538:483:12:Times:12:Times:B:fertility,  and  have  been  extensively  used  in  several  European  countries,  which  are  among  the 
21:784:41052:28:27:56:538:455:12:Times:12:Times:B:countries  most  plagued  by  sharp  reductions  in  population  growth  rates  in  the  last  decades.18  In 
21:785:41162:27:28:56:539:428:12:Times:12:Times:B:contrast,  the  Chinese  one-child  per  family  programme  was  enforced,  among  other  things,  as  a 
21:786:41267:28:27:56:539:400:12:Times:12:Times:B:stimulus  to  economic  growth  because  of  the  opposite  problem  of  over-population,  and  maybe  it 
21:787:41373:27:28:56:503:373:12:Times:12:Times:B:represents the most interesting case of application of tax penalties on children in the world.19 
21:788:41469:28:28:56:538:345:12:Times:12:Times:B:    It may be interesting, therefore, to study the effects of child taxes on demo-economic outcomes in 
21:789:41571:28:28:56:530:317:12:Times:12:Times:B:a context of multiple steady states. Analysis of b from Eq. (10.2) gives the following proposition:

21:792:41768:30:35:56:538:232:12:Times:12:Times:B:enough  increase  in  the  child  tax  produces  the  loss of  the  lowest  stable  steady  state, 1k  ,  thus

21:794:41926:8:27:56:538:189:6:Times:10:Times:F:18  Policies  consisting  in  cash  subsidies  for  children  are  largely  adopted  in  several  countries.  As  an  example,  consider 
21:795:42063:27:23:56:538:162:10:Times:10:Times:F:that in Italy a 1,000 euro child grant for each new born was introduced in the year 2005, while in Poland every woman 
21:796:42181:23:23:56:538:139:10:Times:10:Times:F:will benefit from a one-off 258 euro payment for each child, and women from poorer families will receive double the 
21:797:42297:23:19:56:128:116:10:Times:10:Times:F:previous amount. 
21:798:42314:19:27:56:539:97:6:Times:10:Times:F:19  For  instance,  the  one-child  policy  had  the  effect  of  reducing  the  Total  Fertility  Rate  in  China  from  more  than  five 
21:799:42453:27:0:56:414:70:10:Times:10:Times:F:births per woman in the 1970s to slightly less than two births per woman in recent years.

22:826:43023:27:28:56:538:472:12:Times:12:Times:B:Proposition 2 shows that in a context of multiple steady states, a rise in the child tax increases the 
22:827:43125:28:28:56:538:444:12:Times:12:Times:B:extreme stable steady states, reduces the intermediate unstable steady state, while shrinking the size 
22:828:43227:28:28:56:538:416:12:Times:12:Times:B:of  the  basin  of  attraction  of  the  poverty  trap.  Moreover,  a  large  enough  increase  in  the  child  tax 
22:829:43343:28:30:56:539:388:12:Times:12:Times:B:shifts upward the phase map ()kG in such a way to cause the loss of the lowest stable equilibrium, 
22:830:43442:30:28:56:538:358:12:Times:12:Times:B:thus  allowing  those  economies  that  were  entrapped  into  poverty  due  to  unfavourable  initial 
22:831:43545:28:27:56:538:330:12:Times:12:Times:B:conditions  to  end  up  in  the  high  regime  of  development,  where  fertility  is  low  and  income  per 
22:832:43655:27:28:56:207:303:12:Times:12:Times:B:worker and longevity are high. 
22:833:43686:28:27:56:297:275:12:Times:12:Times:B:    Given Proposition 2 the following result holds: 
22:834:43737:27:28:56:59:248:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
22:835:43737:28:28:56:538:220:12:Times:12:Times:B:Result 1. For any given value of the health tax rate τ, poverty or prosperity might not depend on 
22:836:43835:28:28:56:369:192:12:Times:12:Times:B:initial conditions, while being the result of a child policy design. 
22:837:43903:28:27:56:59:164:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
22:838:43903:27:28:56:539:137:12:Times:12:Times:B:As discussed in Section 2, in fact, a rise in the child tax reduces fertility and increases savings due 
22:839:44007:28:28:56:541:109:12:Times:12:Times:B:to  a  partial  equilibrium  effect.  This  causes  a  direct  impetus  to  capital  accumulation  that  shifts  the 
22:840:44124:28:0:56:538:81:12:Times:12:Times:B:phase  map ()kG  upward  for  any 0>k,  while  also  raising  the  stable  steady  states  and  thus  the 
23:841:44322:0:28:56:538:760:12:Times:12:Times:B:equilibrium wage rate earned by the young workers in both low and high income countries. Higher 
23:842:44418:28:28:56:538:732:12:Times:12:Times:B:wages, however, translate into a higher health expenditure per worker – ceteris paribus as regards 
23:843:44517:28:28:56:538:704:12:Times:12:Times:B:the value of the health tax τ – that produces a reduction in adult mortality at the steady state. The 
23:844:44619:28:27:56:538:676:12:Times:12:Times:B:increased  survival  probability  causes  an  indirect  general  equilibrium  feedback  effect  that  acts 
23:845:44726:27:28:56:539:649:12:Times:12:Times:B:negatively  on  fertility  and  positively  on  savings, and  thus  properly  works  as  a  stimulus  to 
23:846:44831:28:28:56:539:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:accumulate capital further on. As a consequence, the equilibrium output per worker increases, while 
23:847:44931:28:27:56:538:593:12:Times:12:Times:B:the steady-state adult mortality and fertility rates shrink in both regimes. A large enough increase in 
23:848:45035:27:28:56:538:566:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  child  tax,  however,  is  sufficient  to  create  a  stimulus  to  capital  accumulation  to  dramatically 
23:849:45148:28:27:56:538:538:12:Times:12:Times:B:eliminate  the  low  equilibrium  and  allow  those  economies  that  were  entrapped  into  poverty  to 
23:850:45253:27:28:56:257:511:12:Times:12:Times:B:prosper, irrespective of initial conditions. 
23:851:45298:28:28:56:538:483:12:Times:12:Times:B:    We now illustrate Proposition 2 and Result 1 with the following numerical examples. We take the 
23:852:45398:28:27:56:538:455:12:Times:12:Times:B:same parameter values as that used in Section 3 and look at the effects of the child policy variable 
23:853:45499:27:28:58:538:428:12:Times:12:Times:B:b on both macroeconomic and demographic performances over the very long run. Starting from the 
23:854:45594:28:28:56:538:400:12:Times:12:Times:B:case 0=b,  where  the  world  is  divided  into  poor  and  rich  countries,  Table  1  shows  how  the  main 
23:855:45704:28:28:56:541:372:12:Times:12:Times:B:steady-state variables react following a rise in the child tax. As can be seen from Table 1, a slight 
23:856:45806:28:28:56:538:344:12:Times:12:Times:B:increase  in  the  child  tax  (from 0=b  to 01.0=b)  represents  an  engine  for  capital  accumulation, 
23:857:45912:28:27:56:538:316:12:Times:12:Times:B:while  also  causing  a  relatively  large  reduction  in adult  mortality  and  fertility  in  both  regimes  of 
23:858:46026:27:28:56:538:289:12:Times:12:Times:B:development. If we assume that childhood is 20 years of life and adulthood is divided, in turn, into a 
23:859:46128:28:28:56:541:261:12:Times:12:Times:B:30-year working time and a 30-year retirement time, a rise in the child tax from 0 to 0.01 raises the 
23:860:46230:28:27:56:538:233:12:Times:12:Times:B:individual  survival  probability  in  poor  countries  that  passes  from  32.5  per  cent  of  the  whole  time 
23:861:46344:27:28:56:538:206:12:Times:12:Times:B:after the end of youth (i.e. individuals live about  9.75 years beyond the working time) to 34.8 per 
23:862:46445:28:27:56:538:178:12:Times:12:Times:B:cent  of  the  whole  time  after  the  end  of  youth  (i.e.  individuals  live  about  10.5  years  beyond  the 
23:863:46559:27:28:56:538:151:12:Times:12:Times:B:working time), with an increase of almost 0.75 years of life. Adult mortality shrinks of course even 
23:864:46660:28:28:56:538:123:12:Times:12:Times:B:in  rich  countries  but  its  reduction  in  more  sensible  because  the  percentage  increase  in  capital 
23:865:46770:28:27:56:538:95:12:Times:12:Times:B:accumulation (and, hence, in the wage rate) is higher in that case. In particular, raising the child tax 
23:866:46875:27:0:56:538:68:12:Times:12:Times:B:from  0  to  0.01  causes  a  sharp  increase  in  the  lifetime  of  people  in rich  countries  that  moves  from 
24:867:47011:0:28:56:541:760:12:Times:12:Times:B:81.2 per cent of the whole time after the end of youth (i.e. individuals live about 24.3 years beyond 
24:868:47113:28:28:56:538:732:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  working  time)  to  87.3  per  cent  of  the  whole  time  after  the  end  of  youth  (i.e.  individuals  live 
24:869:47230:28:27:56:454:704:12:Times:12:Times:B:about 26.1 years beyond the working time), with a gain of almost 1.8 years of life. 
24:870:47314:27:28:56:538:677:12:Times:12:Times:B:    Increasing  further  the  child  tax,  however,  sharply  stimulates  capital  accumulation  and  produces 
24:871:47425:28:27:56:538:649:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  loss  of  lowest  stable  steady  state.  Therefore, the  low  regime  of  development  vanishes  and  the 
24:872:47537:27:29:56:538:622:12:Times:12:Times:B:economies  that  were  entrapped  into  poverty  due  to  unfavourable  initial  conditions  will  converge 
24:873:47645:29:32:56:538:593:12:Times:12:Times:B:towards the unique high stable steady state (i.e. the phase map ()kG lies everywhere above the 45° 
24:874:47744:32:31:56:538:561:12:Times:12:Times:B:line and falls below it only once the high equilibrium 3k is achieved), with dramatic consequences 
24:875:47843:31:27:56:538:530:12:Times:12:Times:B:for  both  macroeconomic  and  demographic  outcomes.  In  fact,  capital  accumulation  monotonically 
24:876:47946:27:28:56:538:503:12:Times:12:Times:B:increases with the child tax and this raises, in turn, the equilibrium wage rate. As a consequence, for 
24:877:48050:28:29:56:538:475:12:Times:12:Times:B:any  given  value  of  the  health  tax τ,  the  public  health  expenditure  raises  because  of  the  increased 
24:878:48164:29:30:56:538:446:12:Times:12:Times:B:child  tax  and  the  length  of  life  of  people  increases  approaching  its  saturating  value 1π,  while  the 
24:879:48279:30:27:56:221:416:12:Times:12:Times:B:fertility rate considerably shrinks.

25:899:48778:27:28:56:542:537:12:Times:12:Times:B:    At  this  point,  it  is  useful  studying  the  effects  of  the  opposite  –  and  widely  adopted  –  child 
25:900:48893:28:29:56:538:509:12:Times:12:Times:B:allowance policy in a context of multiple steady states. We define the child allowance (financed by 
25:901:48993:29:33:56:538:480:12:Times:12:Times:B:a wage income tax 10<<tθ) as qb<<0, i.e. the net cost of children should remain positive to 
25:902:49085:33:31:56:538:447:12:Times:12:Times:B:guarantee the existence of a finite positive solution for tn. As a consequence of the introduction of 
25:903:49187:31:28:56:538:416:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  child  allowance  scheme,  a  partial  equilibrium  effect  exists  that  increases  fertility  and  reduces 
25:904:49301:28:27:56:538:388:12:Times:12:Times:B:savings. Capital accumulation, therefore, will be lower. This causes a reduction in the  steady  state 
25:905:49404:27:28:56:538:361:12:Times:12:Times:B:stock of capital and, hence, in the wage rate. Therefore, for any given value of the health tax τ, the 
25:906:49507:28:28:56:538:333:12:Times:12:Times:B:health  expenditure  per  worker  shrinks  and  then  adult  mortality  raises  in  equilibrium.  The  reduced 
25:907:49618:28:28:56:538:305:12:Times:12:Times:B:life  span  induces  agents  to  have  more  children  and this,  in  turn,  decreases  capital  accumulation 
25:908:49728:28:28:56:538:277:12:Times:12:Times:B:further on. Moreover, a large enough increase in the child subsidy can produce the loss of the high 
25:909:49828:28:35:56:539:249:12:Times:12:Times:B:equilibrium (i.e. the phase map ()kG lies everywhere below the 45° line once the low equilibrium 
25:910:49925:35:27:63:538:214:7:Times:12:Times:A:1k  is  achieved),  and  this  in  turn  implies  that,  irrespective  of  initial  conditions,  all  economies  will 
25:911:50043:27:27:56:539:187:12:Times:12:Times:B:end up in the low regime of development, where income per worker is low, adult mortality is high 
25:912:50140:27:28:56:154:160:12:Times:12:Times:B:and fertility is high. 
25:913:50163:28:28:56:541:132:12:Times:12:Times:B:    Table 2 shows the effects of child allowances on the main steady states variables in both low and 
25:914:50265:28:27:56:541:104:12:Times:12:Times:B:high income countries. As regards the high regime of development, from Table 2 it can be seen that 
25:915:50364:27:0:56:538:77:12:Times:12:Times:B:a  slight  increase  in  the  child  allowance  (from  0  to  0.003)  increases  fertility  and  causes  a  sharp 
26:916:50498:0:28:56:538:760:12:Times:12:Times:B:reduction  in  both  capital  accumulation  and  adult  mortality  (with  a  loss  of  almost  2  years  of  life). 
26:917:50614:28:28:56:539:732:12:Times:12:Times:B:The  high  equilibrium  vanishes  as  a  consequence  of  a  further  increase  in  the  child  allowance  and, 
26:918:50726:28:28:56:538:704:12:Times:12:Times:B:thus, the economies converge towards the low regime where capital accumulation is low, fertility is 
26:919:50826:28:31:56:342:676:12:Times:12:Times:B:high and the lifetime of people tends to the natural rate 0π.

27:939:51356:0:28:56:133:760:12:Times:12:Times:B:5. Conclusions 
27:940:51371:28:28:56:59:732:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
27:941:51371:28:27:56:538:704:12:Times:12:Times:B:We studied the effect of child policies in the basic overlapping generations model with endogenous 
27:942:51470:27:28:56:538:677:12:Times:12:Times:B:fertility  and  endogenous  longevity  determined  by  public  health  investments  (see  Chakraborty, 
27:943:51573:28:28:56:538:649:12:Times:12:Times:B:2004).  We  assumed  a  sufficiently  general  form  of  the  relationship  between  longevity  and  public 
27:944:51681:28:27:56:523:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:health spending to include rather realistic features of the evolution of the length of life of agents. 
27:945:51783:27:28:56:538:594:12:Times:12:Times:B:    We  found  that  four  (instead  of  the  usual  setup with  three)  steady  states  can  exist,  and  this 
27:946:51895:28:27:56:538:566:12:Times:12:Times:B:enriched  set  of  long-run  outcomes  is  possible  under  more  plausible  economic  conditions  with 
27:947:51999:27:28:56:538:539:12:Times:12:Times:B:respect  to  those  described  by  Chakraborty  (2004).  In  particular,  when  threshold  effects  of  health 
27:948:52110:28:28:56:538:511:12:Times:12:Times:B:capital  on  longevity  exist,  development  traps  appear  under  less  stringent  (and  more  empirically 
27:949:52218:28:27:56:538:483:12:Times:12:Times:B:relevant)  conditions  on  the  output  elasticity  of  capital.  Thus,  depending  on  initial  conditions  an 
27:950:52330:27:28:56:538:456:12:Times:12:Times:B:economy  may  be  either  entrapped  into  a  low  development  regime,  where  income  and  life 
27:951:52428:28:27:56:538:428:12:Times:12:Times:B:expectancy  are  low  are  fertility  is  high,  or  converge  towards  a  high  development  regime  where 
27:952:52536:27:28:56:328:401:12:Times:12:Times:B:income and life expectancy are high and fertility is low. 
27:953:52594:28:28:56:539:373:12:Times:12:Times:B:    However, the main message of this paper is that the limiting outcomes of the economy may not 
27:954:52691:28:27:56:538:345:12:Times:12:Times:B:depend on initial conditions, while being the result of child policy design. In particular, regardless 
27:955:52793:27:28:56:538:318:12:Times:12:Times:B:of whether an economy starts out with either a low or high stock of capital, a child tax programme 
27:956:52892:28:27:56:538:290:12:Times:12:Times:B:can be adopted to escape permanently the vicious cycle of poverty and ill-health, since it properly 
27:957:52992:27:28:56:538:263:12:Times:12:Times:B:works  as  a  stimulus  to  accumulate  capital,  increase  income  per  worker  and  life  expectancy  and 
27:958:53100:28:28:56:185:235:12:Times:12:Times:B:reduce population growth. 
27:959:53126:28:27:56:538:207:12:Times:12:Times:B:    This   paper   suggests   that   the   child   tax   policy   may   have   favoured   the   economic   growth 
27:960:53240:27:28:56:538:180:12:Times:12:Times:B:performances  of  an  economy  such  as  the  Chinese  one in  the  recent  years.  Conversely,  our  results 
27:961:53350:28:27:56:538:152:12:Times:12:Times:B:may also constitute a warning as regards the effects of the more traditional child-subsidy policy: the 
27:962:53452:27:28:56:538:125:12:Times:12:Times:B:price  to  be  paid  for  stimulating  the  fertility  recovery  in  developed  countries  may  be  not  only  the 
27:963:53567:28:0:56:538:97:12:Times:12:Times:B:expected (in a neoclassical growth model) reduction in per capita income, but also the formation of 
28:964:53687:0:28:56:538:760:12:Times:12:Times:B:development  traps  which  may  be  attractive  also  for developing  countries  in  the  case  of  negative 
28:965:53796:28:28:56:144:732:12:Times:12:Times:B:economic shocks. 
28:966:53813:28:27:56:538:704:12:Times:12:Times:B:    Finally, other lines along which the present model can be extended are the following: (i) a private 
28:967:53917:27:28:56:538:677:12:Times:12:Times:B:provision of health capital can be introduced and compared with the public health system; (ii) both 
28:968:54017:28:28:56:538:649:12:Times:12:Times:B:young   and   old   people   can   be   entitled   to   public   healthcare   services;   (iii)   the   effects   on 
28:969:54134:28:28:56:538:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:macroeconomic  and  demographic  variables  of  other  public  policies  such  as  pension  and  public 
28:970:54238:28:27:56:539:593:12:Times:12:Times:B:education programmes can be evaluated in a context of multiple steady states; (iv) improvements in 
28:971:54337:27:27:56:538:566:12:Times:12:Times:B:health   care   can   have   important   economic   effects   beyond   those   engendered   by   greater   life 
28:972:54449:27:28:56:538:539:12:Times:12:Times:B:expectancy:  for  instance,  lower  morbidity  and  better  functionality  can  raise  both  the  productivity 
28:973:54560:28:28:56:519:511:12:Times:12:Times:B:and wage of individuals (e.g. Strauss and Thomas, 1998) and thus may affect economic growth.
