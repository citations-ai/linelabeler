2:23:999:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:Legal rules governing the employer-employee relationship are many and varied.  Economic analysis
2:24:1095:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:has illuminated both the efficiency and the effects on employee welfare of such rules, as described
2:25:1194:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:in this paper.  Topics addressed include workplace safety mandates, compensation systems for workplace
2:26:1296:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:injuries, privacy protection in the workplace, employee fringe benefits mandates, targeted mandates
2:27:1395:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:such as medical and family leave, wrongful discharge laws, unemployment insurance systems, minimum
2:28:1493:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:wage rules, and rules requiring that employees receive overtime pay.  Both economic theory and empirical
2:29:1597:14:28:72:190:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:evidence are considered.

3:35:1704:0:27:108:534:708:144:Times:144:Times:?:In a modern economy, individuals usually rely on paid work to meet their basic material 
3:36:1792:27:28:72:504:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:needs.  The present paper is concerned with the economic analysis of laws governing this 
3:37:1881:28:27:72:523:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:ubiquitous employer-employee relationship.  Such laws have proliferated in both number and 
3:38:1972:27:28:72:488:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:scope across nations, and economic analysis of these laws’ desirability and effects has 
3:39:2060:28:28:72:278:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:accordingly attracted significant attention. 
3:40:2105:28:27:108:524:570:144:Times:144:Times:?:Within a pervasively unionized economy, the body of what is referred to in the United 
3:41:2191:27:28:72:535:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:States as “labor law” plays an important role in regulating the employer-employee relationship.  
3:42:2288:28:27:72:519:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:This body of law governs the practices and treatment of labor unions.  In countries with only 
3:43:2382:27:28:72:524:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:moderate levels of unionization, however, the central responsibility for legal regulation of the 
3:44:2479:28:28:72:535:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:employer-employee relationship falls to what is referred to in the United States as “employment 
3:45:2575:28:27:72:534:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:law.”  Employment law governs the treatment of individual employees regardless of their union 
3:46:2669:27:28:72:514:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:status.  Areas of regulation include workplace safety and privacy, employee fringe benefits, 
3:47:2762:28:27:72:529:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:workplace leave, job security, and the payment of wages.  The present paper is concerned with 
3:48:2856:27:28:72:334:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:the economic analysis of these employment law rules. 
3:49:2909:28:27:108:537:322:144:Times:144:Times:?:An obvious but critical starting point in the economic analysis of employment law is that 
3:50:2999:27:28:72:520:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:legal regulation of the treatment of employees typically takes place against the backdrop of a 
3:51:3094:28:28:72:529:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:market relationship.  This market relationship often imposes significant limits on the prospects 
3:52:3191:28:27:72:497:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:for using employment law purely for the purpose of transferring power, wealth, or other 
3:53:3279:27:28:72:536:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:entitlements to employees – although employment law is often enacted with such motives as the 
3:54:3373:28:27:72:501:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:law’s declared purpose.  In the area of mandated leave from employment, for instance, if 
3:55:3462:27:28:72:521:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:employment law seeks to better employees’ situation by specifying minimum entitlements to 
3:56:3552:28:28:72:510:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:leave from work, it is possible that the end result will be to worsen employees’ situation as 
3:57:3646:28:0:72:525:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:wages or employment levels adjust in response to the new legal requirements.  Because of the 
4:58:3741:0:27:72:517:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:way in which the market constrains the prospects for using employment law purely to effect 
4:59:3832:27:28:72:517:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:transfers of resources, the economic analysis of employment law in this paper gives primary 
4:60:3924:28:27:71:535:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:emphasis to market failures in the employer-employee relationship.  In the presence of a market 
4:61:4020:27:28:71:510:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:failure, legal intervention through employment law may both enhance efficiency and make 
4:62:4108:28:28:71:182:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:employees better off.   
4:63:4132:28:27:107:539:570:144:Times:144:Times:?:This paper situates the major areas of employment law within this market-failure analytic 
4:64:4222:27:28:71:515:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:framework; importantly, it also identifies certain areas in which legal intervention may help 
4:65:4316:28:27:71:520:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:targeted employees even in the absence of market failure (sections VI and IX below).  At the 
4:66:4409:27:28:71:538:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:broadest level, the paper seeks to describe both theoretically and empirically the degree to which 
4:67:4508:28:28:71:530:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:major forms of legal regulation of the employer-employee relationship may enhance efficiency 
4:68:4601:28:27:71:538:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:and make employees better off.  Section I of the paper briefly presents the basic framework used 
4:69:4698:27:28:71:501:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:throughout much of the paper.  Sections II-X consider specific areas of employment law, 
4:70:4786:28:27:71:508:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:including workplace safety regulation, privacy protection in the workplace, fringe benefits 
4:71:4878:27:28:71:503:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:mandates, targeted mandates such as medical and family leave, wrongful-discharge laws, 
4:72:4965:28:27:71:507:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:minimum wage requirements, and rules requiring overtime pay.  A separate chapter of the 
4:73:5053:27:28:71:528:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:Handbook of Law and Economics (chapter 18, by John Donohue) considers antidiscrimination 
4:74:5142:28:28:71:482:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:requirements in employment law and other domains such as housing and education.   
4:75:5224:28:27:107:110:239:144:Times:144:Times:?: 
4:76:5224:27:28:257:357:212:144:Times:144:Times:?:I.   Framework 
4:77:5239:28:27:107:530:184:144:Times:144:Times:?:As suggested above, the analysis in this paper rests on the assumption that employment 
4:78:5326:27:28:71:531:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:law operates to regulate market relationships between employers and employees.  Obviously, it 
4:79:5420:28:0:71:537:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:is possible to organize an economy in which wages and conditions of employment are set not by 
5:80:5516:0:27:72:535:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:private actors in employment markets but instead by a central planner; such non-market settings 
5:81:5612:27:28:72:290:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:would naturally require a different analysis.   
5:82:5660:28:27:108:527:653:144:Times:144:Times:?:Within a market setting, when wages and conditions of employment are determined by 
5:83:5743:27:28:72:514:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:the interaction of labor supply and labor demand, legal intervention not tied to an identified 
5:84:5838:28:28:72:517:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:market failure will often, although not always, reduce both efficiency and employee welfare 
5:85:5930:28:27:72:529:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:(section I.A).  However, a number of important market failures may characterize the employer-
5:86:6023:27:28:72:247:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:employee relationship (section I.B). 
5:87:6060:28:27:72:75:515:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
5:88:6060:27:28:72:363:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:A. Employment law in the absence of market failure 
5:89:6111:28:28:108:533:460:144:Times:144:Times:?: Most of the rules of employment law considered in this paper reflect the imposition of a 
5:90:6200:28:27:72:537:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:legally prescribed term governing the conditions of work into the parties’ employment contract.  
5:91:6297:27:28:72:510:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:This subsection describes the typical effects of such rules in the absence of market failure.  
5:92:6392:28:27:72:515:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:Section VI below shows how the analysis differs for rules that target the work conditions of 
5:93:6485:27:28:72:535:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:discrete, identifiable subgroups of employees.  Note that the framework described here does not 
5:94:6581:28:27:72:517:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:apply to the rules establishing minimum wage and overtime pay requirements or to the rules 
5:95:6672:27:28:72:541:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:governing discharge of employees because these forms of legal regulation directly operate on the 
5:96:6769:28:28:72:537:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:wage or employment level in the regulated employment markets rather than on the conditions of 
5:97:6863:28:27:72:490:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:work; these forms of legal regulation are covered separately in sections VII - X below. 
5:98:6951:27:28:108:522:212:144:Times:144:Times:?:In speaking of legally prescribed terms within a contract, it is important to distinguish 
5:99:7041:28:27:72:535:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:between mandatory and default terms.  Mandatory terms are ones that cannot be changed by the 
5:100:7134:27:28:72:541:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:parties even if they express a desire to do so.  For instance, if the Occupational Safety and Health 
5:101:7235:28:28:72:522:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:Act (OSHA), which regulates workplace safety in the United States, requires that a particular 
5:102:7329:28:0:72:533:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:safety measure be adopted, employers and employees may not avoid the requirement simply by 
6:103:7422:0:27:72:536:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:agreeing through contract that it does not apply.  Default terms, by contrast, are terms that apply 
6:104:7522:27:28:72:535:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:unless the parties reach a contrary agreement.  Most employment law rules are mandatory rules, 
6:105:7617:28:27:72:519:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:and the analysis to follow assumes that the rule in question is a mandatory one.  The specific 
6:106:7712:27:28:72:484:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:employment law rules discussed in the reminder of this paper are all mandatory ones. 
6:107:7797:28:28:108:530:598:144:Times:144:Times:?: The legally prescribed terms that employment law specifies for the employer-employee 
6:108:7882:28:27:72:513:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:relationship typically require employers to provide something of value – a safer workplace; 
6:109:7974:27:28:72:523:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:privacy; certain fringe benefits; leaves from work in specified circumstances – to employees.  
6:110:8069:28:27:72:537:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:Accordingly, within a simple labor supply and demand framework with no market failure of any 
6:111:8162:27:28:72:523:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:sort, these rules will produce a downward shift in the labor supply curve by the amount of the 
6:112:8257:28:28:72:537:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:value of the mandated benefit and a downward shift in the labor demand curve by the amount of 
6:113:8351:28:27:72:514:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:the cost of the mandated benefit (Summers 1989).  These effects are depicted graphically in 
6:114:8443:27:28:72:124:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:Figure 1.   
6:115:8455:28:27:108:527:377:144:Times:144:Times:?:Within this simple framework, it is obvious that the effects of a particular employment 
6:116:8543:27:29:72:530:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:law rule on efficiency and employee welfare turn on the relative magnitude of the labor supply 
6:117:8638:29:28:72:538:321:144:Times:144:Times:B:and labor demand shifts.  If the downward shift in the labor supply curve (S° to S' in Figure 1) is 
6:118:8738:28:28:72:537:293:144:Times:144:Times:B:less than the downward shift in the labor demand curve, then the wage will fall by more than the 
6:119:8835:28:27:72:528:265:144:Times:144:Times:B:value of the legally mandated benefit to employees in the employment market in question, and 
6:120:8928:27:28:72:540:238:144:Times:144:Times:B:employment (and, with it, efficiency and employee welfare) will fall (Figure 1, top panel).  If, by 
6:121:9028:28:28:72:525:210:144:Times:144:Times:B:contrast, the downward shift in the labor supply curve is larger than the downward shift in the 
6:122:9124:28:27:72:542:182:144:Times:144:Times:B:labor demand curve, then the wage will fall by less than the value of the legally mandated benefit 
6:123:9223:27:12:72:542:155:144:Times:144:Times:B:to employees, and employment (and with it, efficiency and employee welfare) will rise (Figure 1, 
7:124:9322:12:0:72:216:143:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                
7:125:9370:0:27:72:520:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:bottom panel).  But if that were the case, then, given the assumed lack of any form of market 
7:126:9464:27:28:72:504:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:failure, employers would have offered the benefit without any need for a legal mandate.1  
7:127:9554:28:27:107:533:653:144:Times:144:Times:?:Thus, in the absence of market failure, employment law rules will generally reduce both 
7:128:9642:27:28:71:508:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:efficiency and employee welfare.  However, employment markets may fail for a variety of 
7:129:9730:28:28:71:506:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:reasons.  Section I.B below describes the most commonly discussed market failures in the 
7:130:9819:28:27:71:233:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:employer-employee relationship.

7:139:10260:28:27:71:537:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:Information failures occur when some market participants lack information that bears upon their 
7:140:10356:27:28:71:515:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:decisions in that market.  In employer-employee relationships, both parties may suffer from 
7:141:10448:28:28:71:179:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:information failures.

7:146:10472:8:18:72:513:135:42:Times:121:Times:F:1 This analysis assumes that there is no binding legally specified minimum wage in the employment 
7:147:10569:18:12:71:496:117:121:Times:121:Times:F:market in question.  At least in the United States, the minimum wage is sufficiently low in most 
7:148:10666:12:13:71:540:105:121:Times:121:Times:F:jurisdictions that it is not binding in most employment markets.  With a binding minimum wage (meaning 
7:149:10769:13:13:71:531:92:121:Times:121:Times:F:the market wage is near or below the legally prescribed minimum wage) the effects of legally mandated 
7:150:10871:13:0:71:340:79:121:Times:100:Times:F:terms would be felt in employment levels rather than wages. 
8:151:10932:0:27:144:364:708:144:Times:144:Times:?:  a. Employee-side information failures 
8:152:10972:27:28:108:521:681:144:Times:144:Times:?: Some aspects of the employment relationship are likely to be relatively transparent to 
8:153:11059:28:27:72:526:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:employees.  Wages, for instance, are an aspect of the relationship about which employees will 
8:154:11153:27:28:72:539:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:usually have good information.  By contrast, the magnitude of the risk of long-term occupational 
8:155:11250:28:28:72:445:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:disease is something about which employees will often not be well informed. 
8:156:11326:28:27:107:492:570:144:Times:144:Times:?: Employee-side information failures may be modeled in two distinct ways.  One 
8:157:11403:27:28:72:538:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:possibility is that employees with limited information are aware of their informational limits and 
8:158:11502:28:27:72:502:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:take rational steps in response to those limits.  As described below, this type of modeling 
8:159:11594:27:28:72:495:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:assumption is often adopted in analyzing employer-side information failures.  A second 
8:160:11681:28:28:72:536:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:possibility is that employees with limited information either are not aware of their informational 
8:161:11780:28:27:72:538:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:limits or do not change their behavior in response to such awareness.  This is the usual modeling 
8:162:11878:27:28:72:535:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:assumption adopted in analyzing employee-side information failures and is the assumption used 
8:163:11972:28:27:72:328:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:in this paper for analyzing such information failures. 
8:164:12027:27:28:108:515:350:144:Times:144:Times:?: If employees are unaware of some aspect of the employment relationship that would 
8:165:12109:28:27:72:531:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:affect their willingness to supply labor, then observed labor supply will differ from employees’ 
8:166:12206:27:28:72:538:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:“true” willingness to supply labor.  In the case of workplace safety, for instance, employees may 
8:167:12304:28:28:72:543:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:lack adequate information about risks and harms and, as a result, may oversupply labor at a given 
8:168:12402:28:27:72:488:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:wage rate.  In terms of Figure 1 above, the labor supply curve is shifted toward S', and 
8:169:12491:27:28:72:526:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:employees behave as if their workplace were covered by an employment term fostering safety 
8:170:12582:28:28:72:524:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:even though it is not.  In such cases, the information failure means that some transactions that 
8:171:12679:28:30:72:528:156:144:Times:144:Times:B:take place are inefficient – because the cost of supplying labor (measured by S° in Figure 1) in 
8:172:12776:30:28:72:542:126:144:Times:144:Times:B:these transactions exceeds the marginal revenue product of labor (measured by D°); it also means 
8:173:12873:28:0:72:539:98:144:Times:144:Times:B:that employees are worse off than they would be in a well-functioning market – because they are 
9:174:12971:0:27:72:535:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:engaging in some transactions in which the cost of supplying labor exceeds the wage they earn.  
9:175:13067:27:28:72:541:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:Employee-side information failures are discussed further in sections II (workplace safety) and IV

9:179:13230:28:27:108:528:570:144:Times:144:Times:?:Employers will frequently have only imperfect information about the attributes of their 
9:180:13318:27:28:72:536:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:employees.  This is particularly likely to be true at the point of hiring but may be true later on as 
9:181:13420:28:27:72:525:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:well.  A large literature in labor economics examines the consequences of such employer-side 
9:182:13513:27:28:72:500:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:imperfect information for labor markets (e.g. Greenwald 1986; Gibbons and Katz 1991). 
9:183:13599:28:28:108:493:460:144:Times:144:Times:?:As noted above, the usual modeling assumption in the case of an employer-side 
9:184:13677:28:27:72:521:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:information failure is that employers are aware of the limits on their information and respond 
9:185:13772:27:28:72:525:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:rationally to these limits.  Thus, the employers’ information problem is typically modeled as a 
9:186:13868:28:27:72:515:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:situation of adverse selection.  Employer-side information failures and the resulting adverse 
9:187:13962:27:28:72:502:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:selection problems are discussed further in sections V (fringe benefits mandates) and VII

9:191:14113:28:27:108:523:239:144:Times:144:Times:?: A second failure in employment markets is monopsony power.  (Because this paper is 
9:192:14196:27:28:72:525:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:focused on employment law rules that protect employees and does not examine labor law, the 
9:193:14287:28:27:72:526:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:paper does not discuss the alternative scenario of market power or monopoly on the employee 
9:194:14379:27:28:72:515:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:side.)  If an employer is a monopsonist in the market for a particular type of employee, then 
9:195:14473:28:28:72:521:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:instead of taking the wage as given as in a competitive labor market, the individual employer 
9:196:14567:28:0:72:518:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:will face an upward-slowing labor supply curve.  This employer will choose its employment 
10:197:14659:0:27:72:529:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:level E to maximize R(E) – w(E)E, where R(E) is the employer’s revenue and w(E) is the labor 
10:198:14752:27:29:71:517:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:supply curve.  Under the associated first-order condition for the employer, it is clear that the 
10:199:14849:29:28:71:541:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:wage under monopsony falls short of the marginal revenue product of labor R′(E).  This outcome 
10:200:14944:28:28:71:529:624:144:Times:144:Times:B:is inefficient, as well as detrimental to employee welfare, because some employees who would 
10:201:15037:28:27:71:502:596:144:Times:144:Times:B:produce more value than the cost of their labor are not hired.  Section IX below notes the 
10:202:15128:27:28:71:513:569:144:Times:144:Times:B:familiar argument that minimum wage laws may respond to such monopsony-based market 
10:203:15212:28:28:71:534:541:144:Times:144:Times:B:failure – a point that, while of theoretical interest, is generally believed to have limited practical 
10:204:15315:28:27:71:131:513:144:Times:144:Times:B:importance.

10:207:15360:27:28:107:532:431:144:Times:144:Times:?:A third potential failure in employment markets arises from the external effects of some 
10:208:15449:28:28:71:542:403:144:Times:144:Times:B:decisions by market participants.  If, for instance, an employee is killed or injured on the job, it is 
10:209:15553:28:27:71:519:375:144:Times:144:Times:B:not only the employee (and possibly employer) who may suffer harm.  Family members will 
10:210:15641:27:28:71:540:348:144:Times:144:Times:B:typically suffer, though employees may usually take such effects into account.  Systems of social 
10:211:15739:28:27:71:519:320:144:Times:144:Times:B:support will often be affected as well.  Although externalities are obviously a classic form of 
10:212:15835:27:28:71:536:293:144:Times:144:Times:B:market failure, they have received less attention than information failures and monopsony in the 
10:213:15932:28:27:71:514:265:144:Times:144:Times:B:existing literature on the economics of employment law and, thus, receive relatively limited

10:217:16075:27:28:107:532:155:144:Times:144:Times:?:Information failures, market power, and externalities are the traditional forms of market 
10:218:16165:28:0:71:509:127:144:Times:144:Times:B:failure within conventional economic analysis.  A separate set of potential market failures,

11:220:16308:0:27:72:535:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:however, arises from the possibility that employees will exhibit distorted labor supply decisions 
11:221:16406:27:28:72:291:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:as a result of various forms of cognitive bias. 
11:222:16454:28:27:108:518:653:144:Times:144:Times:?:Of natural relevance to employment law is a substantial literature showing that many 
11:223:16539:27:28:71:541:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:individuals exhibit optimism bias, adjudging their personal probability of facing bad outcomes to 
11:224:16637:28:28:71:535:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:be lower than the average probability of facing such outcomes (Weinstein 1980).  Many people, 
11:225:16731:28:27:72:541:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:for instance, believe that their chances of having an auto accident are significantly lower than the 
11:226:16832:27:28:71:515:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:average person’s chances of experiencing this event (DeJoy 1989), although of course these 
11:227:16923:28:27:71:526:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:beliefs cannot all be correct, for if everyone were below “average,” then the average would be 
11:228:17018:27:28:72:517:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:lower.  There is also evidence that people underestimate their absolute as well as relative (to 
11:229:17114:28:28:72:526:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:other individuals) probability of experiencing negative events such as auto accidents (Arnould 
11:230:17209:28:27:72:390:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Grabowski 1981:34-35; Camerer and Kunreuther 1989:566).  
11:231:17270:27:28:108:537:405:144:Times:144:Times:?:From a modeling standpoint, optimism bias among employees is similar to the employee-
11:232:17355:28:27:72:487:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:side information failures discussed in section I.B.1 above.  Parallel to the case of such 
11:233:17445:27:28:72:533:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:information failures, the most natural assumption, and the one that will be utilized in this paper, 
11:234:17545:28:27:72:512:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:is that employees with optimism bias either are not aware of the bias or do not change their 
11:235:17638:27:28:72:507:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:behavior in response to the bias.2  Thus, as with information failures, if employees exhibit 
11:236:17731:28:28:72:502:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:optimism bias in relation to some aspect of the employment relationship that affects their 
11:237:17822:28:27:72:498:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:willingness to supply labor, then observed labor supply will differ from employees’ true 
11:238:17911:27:28:72:521:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:willingness to supply labor.  In the case of workplace safety, for instance, optimism bias may 
11:239:18006:28:27:72:504:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:lead even employees who have full information about the general risks and harms in their 
11:240:18095:27:27:72:498:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:workplace to underestimate the probability that they personally will experience negative 
11:241:18184:27:8:216:219:130:144:Times:144:Times:?: 
11:242:18184:8:17:72:541:122:49:Times:121:Times:F:2 Akerlof and Dickens (1982), by contrast, analyze workplace safety under the assumption that employees 
11:243:18288:17:13:72:538:105:121:Times:121:Times:F:are aware of their tendency to believe (in Akerlof and Dickens’s model, because of cognitive dissonance) 
11:244:18393:13:13:72:537:92:121:Times:121:Times:F:that the workplace is safer than it is.  Because of such awareness, employees in their model take action in 
11:245:18501:13:0:72:230:79:121:Times:121:Times:F:response to their biased tendencies.

12:268:20244:18:13:72:537:92:121:Times:121:Times:F:and synthesize the most influential economic analyses in each major area of employment law, rather than

13:272:20575:27:28:72:543:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:for workplace injuries.  This section and section III consider these two basic approaches in turn.4  
13:273:20674:28:27:107:520:653:144:Times:144:Times:?:The general starting point for economic analysis of workplace safety regulation is the 
13:274:20761:27:28:71:523:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:observation that in the absence of market failure, less safe working conditions should be fully 
13:275:20857:28:28:71:529:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:compensated by higher wages – an application of the theory of equalizing wage differentials.5  
13:276:20952:28:27:71:542:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:Viscusi (1978) and Viscusi and O’Connor (1984), among others, present evidence of adjustments 
13:277:21046:27:28:71:515:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:in wages in response to workplace risks.  The evidence on risk-based adjustments in wages, 
13:278:21137:28:27:71:534:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:however, is limited in two important ways.  First, without some independent way of monetizing 
13:279:21231:27:28:71:515:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:the cost of a higher-risk job, at most the empirical evidence can tell us that wages move in a 
13:280:21326:28:28:71:536:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:particular direction in relation to risk; it cannot tell us whether wages adjust by the right amount 
13:281:21426:28:27:71:524:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:(given the employee’s underlying preferences) in light of workplace risks.   Movement in one 
13:282:21519:27:28:71:482:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:direction or the other is ultimately a fairly weak test of the theory of equalizing wage 
13:283:21608:28:27:71:535:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:differentials.  The second limitation is that sources of credible identification of empirical effects 
13:284:21710:27:28:71:529:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:are extremely difficult to find in this area because employees who select into different types of 
13:285:21808:28:27:71:527:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:jobs with different levels of associated risk may differ along important dimensions that are not 
13:286:21905:27:28:71:518:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:observed by the analyst; and moreover, the jobs into which employees select may also differ 
13:287:21997:28:28:71:534:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:along dimensions that are not observed by the analyst.  If either individual or job characteristics 
13:288:22097:28:27:71:538:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:that are unobservable by the analyst are correlated with job risks, then correlations between risks 
13:289:22197:27:56:71:504:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:and wages may be entirely spurious.  Employment law, not satisfied that equalizing wage

13:291:22285:9:17:72:527:147:42:Times:121:Times:F:4 In addition to workplace safety mandates and mandated compensation for workplace injuries, general 
13:292:22385:17:13:72:527:130:121:Times:121:Times:F:tort law may have some effect on workplace safety incentives; however, such effects are limited by the 
13:293:22488:13:12:72:541:117:121:Times:121:Times:F:fact that, at least in the United States, workers’ compensation (discussed in section III) preempts most tort 
13:294:22598:12:13:72:539:105:121:Times:121:Times:F:liability for workplace injuries.  See chapter 2, by Steven Shavell, in this Handbook for further discussion 
13:295:22707:13:8:72:235:92:121:Times:100:Times:F:of the economic analysis of tort law. 
13:296:22744:8:0:72:456:84:42:Times:100:Times:F:5 Brown (1980) offers a general treatment of the topic of equalizing wage differentials.

14:298:22933:27:28:72:309:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:in both the direct and indirect ways noted above.

14:300:22983:27:28:72:374:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:A. Theoretical analysis of workplace safety mandates   
14:301:23037:28:28:108:512:598:144:Times:144:Times:?:The most direct form of workplace safety regulation is workplace safety mandates.  
14:302:23120:28:27:72:539:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:These mandates require particular workplace practices intended to enhance workplace safety.  In 
14:303:23216:27:28:72:514:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:the United States, as previously noted, OSHA imposes a range of such mandates, which are 
14:304:23305:28:27:72:360:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:described in detail in Smith (1976) and Mendeloff (1979).   
14:305:23365:27:28:108:509:488:144:Times:144:Times:?:Within economic analysis, workplace safety mandates are typically justified on the 
14:306:23448:28:28:72:531:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:ground that either information failures or optimism bias on the part of employees leads them to 
14:307:23544:28:27:71:534:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:oversupply labor at a given wage rate.  Frequently employees will not be aware of the risks of a 
14:308:23641:27:28:71:537:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:particular workplace, and even employees who have good information about the general risks of 
14:309:23735:28:27:72:542:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:their workplace may overoptimistically assume that those risks do not apply to them personally.   
14:310:23833:27:28:108:522:350:144:Times:144:Times:?:As noted in section I.B above, an oversupply of labor because of information failures, 
14:311:23920:28:27:72:498:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:optimism bias, or both means that some inefficient transactions are taking place and that 
14:312:24010:27:28:71:527:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:employees are worse off than they would be in a well-functioning market.  Workplace injuries 
14:313:24103:28:28:72:531:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:may also have important externality effects, but the informational and cognitive problems have 
14:314:24198:28:27:72:505:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:been central in the existing literature.  In the presence of such problems, workplace safety 
14:315:24291:27:28:72:504:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:mandates can in theory improve both efficiency and employee welfare by eliminating the 
14:316:24378:28:27:72:516:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:inefficient and detrimental (to employees) transactions described in section I.B.  If observed 
14:317:24473:27:28:72:504:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:labor supply under a mandate matches the “true” willingness to supply labor (because the 
14:318:24562:28:28:72:538:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:workplace is safe, consistent with employees’ belief), then only efficient transactions will occur, 
14:319:24662:28:0:72:531:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:and employees will accept employment only to the extent that the wage equals or exceeds their 
15:320:24759:0:0:72:216:143:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                
15:321:24807:0:27:72:522:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:“true” cost of supplying labor.  Of course, in the real world the mandated levels of workplace 
15:322:24902:27:28:72:540:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:safety may not match employees’ beliefs or may be exorbitantly expensive; responding to even a 
15:323:24997:28:27:72:523:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:genuine employee-side informational or cognitive problem does not guarantee that efficiency 
15:324:25089:27:28:72:527:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:and employee welfare will rise under a workplace safety mandate.  Ultimately, the effects of a 
15:325:25184:28:28:72:331:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:workplace safety mandate are an empirical question.6

15:328:25287:28:27:108:508:515:144:Times:144:Times:?:As just noted, the central question about workplace safety mandates concerns their 
15:329:25370:27:28:72:506:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:empirical effects on wages, employment levels, and, of course, workplace safety.  A large 
15:330:25460:28:28:72:504:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:empirical literature has attempted to identify such effects.7  This literature has focused on 
15:331:25554:28:27:72:517:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:workplace injuries (in the sense of immediate negative health effects), as distinguished from 
15:332:25648:27:28:72:507:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:longer-term health risks from work; this focus is reflected in the discussion below.  As the 
15:333:25741:28:27:72:522:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:discussion below will make clear, the overall body of empirical evidence suggests modest (at 
15:334:25834:27:28:72:496:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:best) effects of workplace safety mandates on observed levels of workplace safety, and, 
15:335:25922:28:27:72:520:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:presumably because of the limited evidence of effects on the basic level of workplace safety, 
15:336:26016:27:28:72:525:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:wage and employment effects of workplace safety mandates have generally not been studied.  
15:337:26107:28:28:72:515:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:Most of the empirical evidence on the effects of workplace safety mandates comes from the 
15:338:26197:28:27:72:387:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:United States, and that focus is reflected in the discussion below. 
15:339:26265:27:28:108:510:212:144:Times:144:Times:?:In sharp contrast to the workplace injury compensation systems noted in section III 
15:340:26349:28:41:72:515:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:below, workplace safety mandates in the United States operate at the federal level, and, as a 
15:341:26443:41:8:216:219:143:144:Times:144:Times:?: 
15:342:26443:8:18:72:536:135:49:Times:121:Times:F:6 Not addressed in this discussion is the possibility that workplace safety mandates may affect the degree 
15:343:26550:18:12:71:526:117:121:Times:121:Times:F:of precautionary behavior by employees.  Rea (1981) offers related discussion, although his analysis is 
15:344:26654:12:13:71:527:105:121:Times:121:Times:F:primarily focused on compensation systems for workplace injuries (the topic of the next section) rather 
15:345:26758:13:8:71:231:92:121:Times:121:Times:F:than on workplace safety mandates. 
15:346:26793:8:0:72:469:84:49:Times:121:Times:F:7 For a comprehensive survey of this literature through the early 1990s, see Smith (1992). 
16:347:26887:0:0:72:216:181:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                
16:348:26935:0:27:72:535:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:result of OSHA’s status as a federal law, state law variation generally cannot be used to identify 
16:349:27034:27:28:71:539:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:OSHA’s effects.8  Limited exceptions to this statement about OSHA are Ruser and Smith (1988) 
16:350:27127:28:27:72:525:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Morantz (2005).  Ruser and Smith examine the effects of the initiation of a records-check 
16:351:27221:27:28:72:539:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:procedure in some but not all states on the level of reported workplace injuries; they find a lower 
16:352:27321:28:28:71:507:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:level of reported injuries with the records-check procedure in place, but they are unable to 
16:353:27414:28:27:71:502:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:determine from their data whether this results from a true reduction in injury rates or (the 
16:354:27507:27:28:72:534:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:interpretation they emphasize) an increase in the frequency of underreporting because under the 
16:355:27603:28:27:72:543:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:records-check procedure underreporting would reduce the likelihood of costly safety inspections.  
16:356:27701:27:28:72:516:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:Ruser and Smith’s study is largely concerned with effects on reporting levels rather than the 
16:357:27795:28:28:72:530:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:more basic issue of effects on workplace safety.  Meanwhile, Morantz’s (2005) work examines 
16:358:27887:28:27:72:511:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:how injury rates among construction workers vary with federal versus state enforcement of 
16:359:27977:27:28:72:527:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:OSHA’s substantive provisions and finds significantly lower injury rates in states with federal 
16:360:28073:28:27:72:509:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:enforcement.  Although the injury rate data do not go back far enough to allow Morantz to 
16:361:28163:27:28:72:535:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:examine changes over time with the move from federal to state enforcement (so that, in contrast 
16:362:28259:28:27:72:520:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:to Ruser and Smith, identification is based on cross-state variation only, rather than variation 
16:363:28356:27:28:72:471:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:across both states and time), Morantz’s empirical approach does attempt to control 
16:364:28439:28:28:72:528:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:comprehensively for other cross-state differences, apart from federal versus state enforcement, 
16:365:28535:28:58:72:255:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:that could be influencing injury rates. 
16:366:28575:58:8:216:219:181:144:Times:144:Times:?: 
16:367:28575:8:18:72:539:173:49:Times:121:Times:F:8 Much empirical work in employment law, including the work described in several of the sections below 
16:368:28678:18:12:72:541:155:121:Times:121:Times:F:as well as much work in the employment discrimination area (e.g., Neumark and Stock 1999; Jolls 2004a; 
16:369:28781:12:13:72:538:143:121:Times:121:Times:F:Jolls and Prescott 2006), exploits variation in legal innovation across states to identify the effects of legal 
16:370:28893:13:13:72:522:130:121:Times:121:Times:F:rules.  With change over time but no cross-state variation – as with a federal law such as OSHA – it is 
16:371:28997:13:12:72:537:117:121:Times:121:Times:F:often difficult to disentangle the effects of the law’s enactment from other unobserved changes occurring 
16:372:29103:12:13:72:535:105:121:Times:121:Times:F:at the same time.  Indeed, as Smith (1992) notes, even a simple national-level before-after comparison of 
16:373:29209:13:13:72:521:92:121:Times:121:Times:F:injury rates in relation to OSHA’s enactment is not possible because OSHA significantly changed the 
16:374:29309:13:0:72:281:79:121:Times:100:Times:F:manner of collecting data on workplace safety.

17:376:29406:0:27:108:530:708:144:Times:144:Times:?:Other empirical work on OSHA has examined variation in its enforcement over time or 
17:377:29490:27:28:72:524:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:across industries (rather than across states) as a source of identification of the law’s effects on 
17:378:29590:28:27:72:533:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:workplace safety.  In light of the low financial penalties for the typical OSHA violation and the 
17:379:29688:27:28:72:535:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:low likelihood of OSHA inspections (Viscusi 1979; Weil 1996), many have questioned whether 
17:380:29779:28:28:72:489:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:OSHA is likely to have any effect on workplace safety at all, regardless of variation in 
17:381:29868:28:27:72:522:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:enforcement within the low observed ranges of penalties and inspection frequencies.  Viscusi 
17:382:29961:27:28:72:512:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:(1979) and Bartel and Thomas (1985), for instance, find limited or no relationship between 
17:383:30052:28:27:72:522:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:measures of OSHA enforcement and injury rates, while Viscusi (1986) finds at best a modest 
17:384:30143:27:28:72:145:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:relationship.9   
17:385:30160:28:28:108:526:460:144:Times:144:Times:?:Scholz and Gray (1990) have suggested, however, that the limited effects of OSHA on 
17:386:30244:28:27:72:529:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:injury rates in many empirical studies reflect the overly generalized approach of these studies.

17:388:30432:28:27:72:510:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:inspected firms – and find significant effects of OSHA enforcement on injury rates in their 
17:389:30524:27:28:72:520:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:sample.  Unlike earlier studies, Scholz and Gray’s study uses plant-level rather than industry-
17:390:30619:28:27:72:531:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:level data on OSHA enforcement levels and injury rates.  However, a recent study by Gray and 
17:391:30712:27:28:72:534:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:Mendeloff (2005) using a methodology similar to that in Scholz and Gray (1990) found that the 
17:392:30806:28:28:72:518:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:significant effects of OSHA on injury rates lasted only through the early 1990s and were not 
17:393:30899:28:27:72:260:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:apparent in data for most of the 1990s.

17:395:31029:28:27:72:489:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:injury rate, several studies have examined the relationship between the level of OSHA 
17:396:31115:27:28:72:530:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:enforcement and the degree of firms’ observed compliance with OSHA’s requirements.  Bartel

18:402:31525:27:28:72:533:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:noted above, of very limited levels of OSHA enforcement.  By contrast, Weil (2001) finds only 
18:403:31619:28:27:72:469:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:limited effects of enforcement activity on compliance in the construction industry. 
18:404:31703:27:28:108:524:626:144:Times:144:Times:?:Ultimately, the existing empirical work provides relatively little evidence of effects of 
18:405:31793:28:28:72:534:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:OSHA on injury rates, with slightly more evidence of compliance effects.  The lack of variation 
18:406:31889:28:27:72:540:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:across states has, not surprisingly, impeded efforts to pin down the effects of OSHA’s workplace 
18:407:31986:27:28:72:516:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:safety mandates more definitively.  Although the theory suggesting the likelihood of market 
18:408:32078:28:27:72:532:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:failure in the workplace safety context seems strong, direct empirical evidence on the effects of 
18:409:32176:27:28:72:536:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:OSHA has, at least thus far, not provided a clear basis for concluding that this law has enhanced 
18:410:32274:28:28:71:530:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:efficiency and employee welfare or, even more basically, that the law has decreased workplace 
18:411:32368:28:27:71:515:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:injuries.  As described below, the empirical picture on compensation systems for workplace 
18:412:32459:27:28:71:523:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:injuries – the other major employment law mechanism for improving workplace safety – is at 
18:413:32550:28:27:71:219:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:least somewhat more positive.

18:416:32639:27:28:107:506:295:144:Times:144:Times:?:Employment law seeks to enhance workplace safety not only through direct safety 
18:417:32719:28:28:71:528:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:mandates, as under OSHA, but also through the deterrent effects afforded by legally mandated 
18:418:32812:28:27:71:506:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:systems of compensation for those injured on the job.  In the United States, state workers’ 
18:419:32904:27:28:71:518:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:compensation programs are a major source of such legally-mandated compensation.  Injured 
18:420:32993:28:27:71:539:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:workers in the United States may also be eligible for compensation through the federal disability 
18:421:33091:27:28:71:531:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurance program, but the absence of any experience-rating component in this program means 
18:422:33183:28:28:71:521:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:that it does not create any particular deterrent effects for employers.  The disability insurance 
18:423:33281:28:0:71:539:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:program, which is funded through compulsory payroll deductions by employers, is nonetheless a 
19:424:33378:0:27:72:539:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:significant additional source of compensation for employees injured at work and, thus, is usually 
19:425:33476:27:28:72:413:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:included in analyses of compensation systems for workplace injuries.   
19:426:33547:28:27:108:525:653:144:Times:144:Times:?:Both the theory and the empirical evidence relating to workers’ compensation systems 
19:427:33632:27:28:72:536:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:are developed in chapter 33 (by Krueger and Meyer) of the Handbook of Public Economics, and 
19:428:33724:28:28:72:521:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:the federal disability insurance program is also extensively discussed in that chapter; thus the 
19:429:33821:28:27:72:508:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:reader is referred to Krueger and Meyer’s treatment for further discussion of the economic 
19:430:33912:27:28:72:526:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:analysis of these programs.  In brief, Krueger and Meyer conclude that the empirical evidence 
19:431:34006:28:27:72:513:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggests longer periods out of work with more generous workers’ compensation benefits (a 
19:432:34095:27:28:72:532:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:finding with ambiguous welfare consequences, as noted by Krueger and Meyer); they also note 
19:433:34187:28:28:72:508:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:the work by Gruber and Krueger (1991) suggesting no statistically significant reduction in 
19:434:34278:28:27:72:499:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:aggregate employment levels from increases in the generosity of workers’ compensation 
19:435:34364:27:28:72:533:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:programs (a finding suggestive of the absence of significant welfare costs from these programs, 
19:436:34460:28:27:72:537:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:although not of affirmative efficiency gains from the programs).  Meanwhile, with respect to the 
19:437:34557:27:28:72:532:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:federal disability insurance program, Krueger and Meyer emphasize the unresolved question of 
19:438:34650:28:27:72:537:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:what causes the observed major changes in the size of the population receiving federal disability

19:442:34882:27:28:108:504:212:144:Times:144:Times:?:A very rapidly growing area of employment law – particularly with the increasing 
19:443:34963:28:27:72:492:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:presence of computers and the associated monitoring possibilities in the workplace – is 
19:444:35051:27:28:72:512:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:workplace privacy.  Issues of workplace privacy span a broad array of domains.  Questions 
19:445:35141:28:28:72:538:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:include the degree to which employers may videotape or audiotape their employees’ activities in 
19:446:35237:28:0:72:527:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:the workplace, the restrictions (if any) on drug and alcohol testing of employees, the degree to 
20:447:35337:0:27:72:501:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:which employers may engage in various forms of monitoring of employees’ activities on 
20:448:35423:27:28:72:525:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:computers, and the limits on employers’ disclosure of medical and other personal information 
20:449:35516:28:27:72:527:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:about employees.  Workplace privacy mandates require employers to conduct activities of this 
20:450:35609:27:28:72:537:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:sort in specified ways, if at all.  This section briefly highlights the central issues in the economic

20:456:35994:28:28:72:502:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:market failure is an employee-side information failure; for some forms of privacy-related 
20:457:36084:28:27:72:508:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:employer behavior, the employee may simply have no idea that the behavior is occurring.  
20:458:36173:27:28:72:541:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:Employees may assume that their privacy is protected at work, just as they may assume that their 
20:459:36270:28:27:72:526:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:workplace is safe.  Examples in the privacy context include video or audio monitoring and the 
20:460:36364:27:28:72:533:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:monitoring of employees’ computers – practices of which employees may be entirely unaware.  
20:461:36456:28:27:72:513:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:In other settings, by contrast, an employee may know when a particular invasion of privacy 
20:462:36547:27:28:72:535:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:occurs; an example is urine testing for drug use – an employer practice that obviously cannot be 
20:463:36644:28:28:72:273:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:done without the employee’s knowledge. 
20:464:36683:28:27:108:539:239:144:Times:144:Times:?:Even employees who have accurate information about an employer’s general practices in 
20:465:36769:27:28:72:529:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:relation to workplace privacy may be led by optimism bias to underestimate the likelihood that 
20:466:36864:28:27:72:532:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:the at-issue employer behavior will be undertaken in relation to, or have a negative effect upon, 
20:467:36962:27:28:72:511:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:them as opposed to other employees.  The analysis is again parallel to the workplace safety 
20:468:37054:28:28:72:524:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:context, in which employees may underestimate their personal likelihood of workplace risks.  
20:469:37147:28:0:71:528:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:Note that in the workplace privacy context, the risks of market failure related to optimism bias 
21:470:37247:0:27:72:522:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:will tend to be greater when there is more uncertainty in the employer’s policy.  For instance, 
21:471:37343:27:28:72:528:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:employees may underestimate the likelihood that they will be subjected to a drug test under an 
21:472:37438:28:27:72:534:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:employer policy permitting drug testing of employees involved in a workplace accident, simply 
21:473:37532:27:28:72:529:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:because employees may tend to underestimate the likelihood that they will be involved in such 
21:474:37626:28:28:72:518:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:an accident.  By contrast, if an employer policy provides that employees will be subjected to 
21:475:37720:28:27:72:531:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:ongoing video or audio monitoring as a matter of course, then optimism bias is likely to be less 
21:476:37817:27:28:72:535:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:important – though optimistically biased employees could still underestimate the likelihood that 
21:477:37914:28:27:72:376:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:the monitoring will detect a prohibited behavior on their part.   
21:478:37980:27:28:108:535:488:144:Times:144:Times:?:Parallel to the discussion of workplace safety in section II.A above, a workplace privacy 
21:479:38070:28:28:72:533:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:mandate may address an employee-side information failure or cognitive bias by eliminating the 
21:480:38164:28:27:72:542:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:gap between observed labor supply and the “true” willingness to supply labor (because privacy is 
21:481:38261:27:28:72:531:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:now protected at the workplace, consistent with employees’ expectation).  Of course, as above,

21:488:38728:27:28:71:523:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:mandates across states and time suggests the potential value of empirical inquiry in this area.

21:491:39011:28:28:72:533:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:employment levels may be easier to detect.  Jacobson (2003), for instance, presents evidence of

22:496:39456:28:27:72:531:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:results should be viewed with some caution, but Jacobson also finds improved safety outcomes

22:498:39646:28:28:72:527:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:Jacobson’s findings suggest that some forms of workplace privacy mandates (especially in the 
22:499:39739:28:27:72:536:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:drug testing context) may have the unfortunate effect of worsening safety outcomes.  Additional

22:516:40943:18:12:71:539:117:121:Times:121:Times:F:Act, a federal law that broadly displaces potential state-level regulation of pensions and, thus, leaves little

22:518:41165:13:13:71:513:92:121:Times:121:Times:F:legal regulation of pensions.  See Ippolito (1988) for further discussion of the effects of the pension-

23:524:41646:27:28:72:511:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:discussed in chapter 50 (by Currie and Madrian) of the Handbook of Labor Economics and 
23:525:41733:28:28:72:534:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:chapter 31 (by Cutler) of the Handbook of Public Economics, and the reader is referred to those 
23:526:41829:28:27:72:534:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:volumes for further discussion of this system.  Because the Medicare system is covered in those 
23:527:41925:27:28:72:483:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:volumes, the focus of the present section is other types of health insurance mandates. 
23:528:42012:28:27:107:521:515:144:Times:144:Times:?:Both federal and state law in the United States play a role in structuring the system of 
23:529:42101:27:28:72:542:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:health insurance mandates considered in this section.  The federal role here is two-fold.  First, the 
23:530:42203:28:28:72:479:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) broadly “preempts,” or renders 
23:531:42282:28:27:71:510:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:inapplicable, all state-level health insurance mandates insofar as employer-provided health 
23:532:42374:27:28:72:528:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurance is concerned, unless the employer-provided insurance is procured from an insurance 
23:533:42467:28:27:72:533:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:company.  Thus, any employer that self-insures – as many now do – is not subject to any health 
23:534:42562:27:28:72:506:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurance mandates imposed at the state level.  Second, federal law imposes a few limited 
23:535:42652:28:27:72:499:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:mandates on health insurance plans.  One such mandate is contained in the Consolidated 
23:536:42739:27:28:72:528:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA), which requires that, above a certain employer-
23:537:42828:28:28:72:512:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:size threshold, employees be allowed to continue purchasing health insurance through their 
23:538:42919:28:27:72:523:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:former employer for up to 18 months after leaving that employer.  A second source of federal 
23:539:43012:27:107:72:534:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:health insurance mandates is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA),

23:541:43106:8:18:72:538:97:49:Times:121:Times:F:11  By contrast, the Medicaid program in the United States is targeted to the needy and is not linked to the 
23:542:43215:18:0:71:240:79:121:Times:121:Times:F:employment relationship in any way.

24:544:43303:0:27:72:519:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:which imposes a variety of requirements on employers and other health insurance providers, 
24:545:43394:27:28:72:360:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:including mandated coverage for preexisting conditions.12

24:547:43547:27:28:72:529:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:by ERISA, also impose a variety of requirements on health insurance plans; for instance, some 
24:548:43641:28:28:72:505:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:state laws impose continuation coverage mandates similar to the mandate in COBRA (see 
24:549:43727:28:27:72:537:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:Gruber and Madrian 1994).  State-level regulation is discussed briefly below where its mandates 
24:550:43823:27:28:72:542:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:overlap with federal requirements, but, because of the preemption issue noted above, the focus of 
24:551:43921:28:27:72:332:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:this section is on federal health insurance mandates.13

24:554:44028:28:27:108:510:432:144:Times:144:Times:?:Several potential market failures, including employee-side information failures and 
24:555:44112:27:28:71:533:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:cognitive biases, may be relevant to analysis of the health insurance mandates noted just above, 
24:556:44209:28:27:72:499:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:but perhaps the most obvious labor market failure in this context involves employer-side 
24:557:44298:27:28:72:515:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:imperfect information.  (For discussion of the broader issue of provision of health insurance 
24:558:44392:28:27:72:524:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:through, rather than independently of, the employment relationship, see chapter 50 (by Currie 
24:559:44486:27:28:72:512:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Madrian) of the Handbook of Labor Economics.)  For instance, an individual employer 
24:560:44574:28:28:72:496:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:opting unilaterally to offer continuation coverage of the sort required by COBRA might 
24:561:44661:28:27:72:525:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:disproportionately attract employees who are less likely to remain employed (especially those 
24:562:44755:27:31:72:514:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:who simultaneously have concerns about their future health) and, thus, who are particularly 
24:563:44847:31:8:216:219:181:144:Times:144:Times:?: 
24:564:44847:8:18:72:518:173:49:Times:121:Times:F:12 Moreover, recently enacted HIPAA regulations impose a series of privacy-related requirements on 
24:565:44946:18:12:71:533:155:121:Times:121:Times:F:employers concerning the disclosure of medical information; those requirements may be analyzed under 
24:566:45047:12:13:71:525:143:121:Times:121:Times:F:the framework set forth in section IV (workplace privacy) above.  An additional federal law regulating 
24:567:45150:13:13:71:528:130:121:Times:121:Times:F:health insurance is the Mental Health Parity Act.  For the reasons given in section VI below, this law is 
24:568:45256:13:7:71:464:117:121:Times:121:Times:F:best viewed as a targeted mandate and, thus, is discussed in section VI rather than here.   
24:569:45348:7:18:72:512:110:49:Times:121:Times:F:13 Economic analyses of the effects of various state-level health insurance mandates include Gruber

24:571:45545:13:0:71:347:79:121:Times:121:Times:F:Public Economics also contains discussion of these mandates.

25:573:45656:0:27:72:535:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:focused on the issue of continuation coverage.  In broad terms, the problem of adverse selection 
25:574:45753:27:28:72:496:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:here is similar to the problem – described in detail in section VII.A below – faced by an 
25:575:45843:28:27:72:531:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:individual employer opting to offer protection against discharge from employment without just 
25:576:45937:27:28:72:541:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:cause.  In both cases, offering the benefit may make the employer disproportionately attractive to 
25:577:46036:28:28:72:205:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:less desirable employees.14 
25:578:46063:28:27:108:526:570:144:Times:144:Times:?:In the health insurance context, if the value to employees of a particular form of health 
25:579:46153:27:28:71:540:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurance coverage (such as continuation coverage) exceeds the cost of providing such coverage, 
25:580:46249:28:27:71:516:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:then mandating such coverage may efficiently respond to the adverse selection problem just 
25:581:46340:27:28:71:526:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:described.  Of course, in the case of continuation coverage, employers in an ideal world might 
25:582:46435:28:28:71:518:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:offer not this type of coverage but, instead, employee-specific packages of wages and health 
25:583:46528:28:27:71:527:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurance tailored to each employee’s individual costs and needs (Gruber and Madrian 1994).  
25:584:46621:27:28:71:514:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:However, as Gruber and Madrian note, the barriers to such an approach – whether achieved 
25:585:46710:28:27:71:490:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:voluntarily or through legal regulation – in the real world are clear, and thus mandated 
25:586:46799:27:28:71:505:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:continuation coverage, as under COBRA, may be a good second-best solution.  Empirical

25:593:47247:27:28:71:508:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:Handbook of Labor Economics; the discussion there of the studies by Gruber and Madrian

26:599:47624:0:27:72:502:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:especially relevant.  On balance, continuation coverage mandates appear to increase both 
26:600:47713:27:28:72:521:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:separation and retirement from work by employees; effects on overall wage and employment 
26:601:47802:28:27:72:510:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:levels (which would permit conclusions about the welfare effects of continuation coverage 
26:602:47892:27:28:72:418:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:mandates) presumably were not large enough to be studied empirically. 
26:603:47962:28:28:108:530:598:144:Times:144:Times:?:With respect to preexisting conditions coverage mandates, chapter 31 (by Cutler) of the

26:606:48231:28:27:71:511:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:rates.  In addition, in the time since this volume of the Handbook of Public Economics was 
26:607:48322:27:28:71:516:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:published, studies by Kaestner and Simon (2002) and Simon (2005) have also examined the 
26:608:48410:28:28:71:504:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects of state-level health insurance mandates, including preexisting condition coverage

26:610:48592:27:28:71:513:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:(as noted above) includes a preexisting conditions coverage mandate.  The body of existing 
26:611:48683:28:27:72:524:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:empirical work suggests that these mandates have limited or no effects on insurance coverage

26:615:48873:27:28:108:505:267:144:Times:144:Times:?: While the employment law mandates discussed in sections II through V above are 
26:616:48952:28:27:72:530:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:mandates predominantly directed to employees as a whole rather than to any discrete subgroup 
26:617:49045:27:28:72:487:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:of employees, other employment law mandates are targeted to particular demographic 
26:618:49128:28:16:72:536:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:subgroups.  Indeed, many employment law mandates – including certain aspects of employment

26:620:49219:8:17:72:518:160:49:Times:121:Times:F:15 Note that although the primary focus of the empirical literature on health insurance mandates is on 
26:621:49322:17:13:71:540:143:121:Times:121:Times:F:outcomes other than overall wage and employment levels, insofar as overall wage and employment levels 
26:622:49424:13:13:71:501:130:121:Times:121:Times:F:are concerned, the framework described in section I.A above may require some adjustment when 
26:623:49517:13:12:71:517:117:121:Times:121:Times:F:analyzing the effects of health insurance mandates.  This is so because the cost of health insurance is 
26:624:49621:12:13:71:532:105:121:Times:121:Times:F:likely to vary with the number of employees rather than, as depicted in Figure 1 above, with the number 
26:625:49725:13:13:71:542:92:121:Times:121:Times:F:of total worker-hours; in other words, the distribution of worker-hours over employees may matter greatly 
26:626:49831:13:0:71:502:79:121:Times:121:Times:F:in the health insurance context.  Cutler and Madrian (1998) offer further discussion of this point.  
27:627:49935:0:0:72:216:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                
27:628:49983:0:27:72:492:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:discrimination law as well as employment law rules such as mandated workplace leave 
27:629:50067:27:28:72:540:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:(emphasized below) – are targeted in this way.  The direct effects of these targeted mandates will 
27:630:50166:28:27:72:520:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:be felt primarily or exclusively by demographic subgroups of employees, such as individuals 
27:631:50258:27:28:72:531:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:with disabilities, women, or members of particular racial groups, rather than by employees as a 
27:632:50354:28:28:72:185:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:whole (Gruber 1994a). 
27:633:50376:28:27:108:536:570:144:Times:144:Times:?: Of course, no benefits mandate may be entirely untargeted; many mandates, including at 
27:634:50463:27:28:72:518:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:least some of those discussed above, may tend to benefit some demographic groups within a 
27:635:50553:28:27:72:523:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:given employment market more than others within this market.  Thus, the difference between 
27:636:50644:27:28:72:521:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:general and targeted mandates is probably best viewed as a difference in degree rather than a 
27:637:50738:28:28:72:166:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:difference in kind.  
27:638:50759:28:27:108:537:432:144:Times:144:Times:?: The importance of distinguishing between general and targeted mandates arises from the 
27:639:50846:27:28:72:512:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:fact that the subgroups to which targeted mandates are directed are generally groups whose 
27:640:50937:28:27:72:516:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:wages and employment opportunities are legally required to match those of the nontargeted 
27:641:51027:27:28:72:542:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:employees.  In the absence of such requirements (or if such requirements were not binding),16 the 
27:642:51125:28:27:72:534:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:targeted subgroup could simply be treated as a separate labor market, and the same basic sort of 
27:643:51222:27:28:72:533:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:analysis as was discussed in sections II through V above would continue to apply.  However, in 
27:644:51317:28:28:72:507:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:the presence of binding restrictions on differential treatment across groups, the analysis of 
27:645:51411:28:27:72:533:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:targeted mandates proves to be quite different from the analysis employed until this point in the 
27:646:51509:27:28:72:512:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:paper.  As described more fully below, employment law mandates targeted to demographic 
27:647:51596:28:27:72:529:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:subgroups of employees constitute an important exception to the general focus in this paper on 
27:648:51691:27:28:72:522:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:market failures as a necessary condition for employment law regulation to enhance employee 
27:649:51782:28:24:72:538:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:welfare.  If the goal of a targeted mandate is to enhance the welfare of targeted employees – as it 
27:650:51882:24:8:216:219:105:144:Times:144:Times:?: 
27:651:51882:8:18:72:542:97:49:Times:121:Times:F:16 More precisely, if restrictions on wage differentials between the two groups were not binding.  See Jolls 
27:652:51991:18:0:71:203:79:121:Times:121:Times:F:(2000) for further discussion. 
28:653:52025:0:0:72:216:156:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                
28:654:52073:0:27:72:517:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:often is – then the desired result may obtain wholly apart from any sort of market failure – a 
28:655:52168:27:28:72:496:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:point obscured by the common focus in the literature on the standard mandated benefits 
28:656:52255:28:27:72:525:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:framework even when analyzing targeted mandates.17  In light of this observation, and for the 
28:657:52349:27:28:72:533:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:sake of analytic clarity, the present section will analyze targeted mandates on the assumption of 
28:658:52447:28:28:72:506:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:no market failure of any sort.  The analysis below could readily be adjusted to incorporate 
28:659:52539:28:27:72:534:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:market failure in combination with a targeted rather than general mandate.  As above, empirical 
28:660:52635:27:28:72:269:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:analysis follows the theoretical analysis. 
28:661:52678:28:27:108:111:515:144:Times:144:Times:?: 
28:662:52678:27:28:72:324:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:A. Theoretical analysis of targeted mandates 
28:663:52723:28:28:108:540:460:144:Times:144:Times:?: With a targeted mandate and no market failure of any sort, labor supply with the mandate 
28:664:52812:28:27:74:539:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:in place will shift exclusively or disproportionately for the targeted employees, rather than (as in 
28:665:52913:27:28:74:504:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:section I.A above) for employees as a whole.  Meanwhile, on the employer side, the total 
28:666:53002:28:27:74:516:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:marginal revenue product of labor (reflecting, among other things, the cost of the mandated 
28:667:53094:27:28:74:512:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:benefit) will shift exclusively or disproportionately for the targeted group.  If, for instance, 
28:668:53191:28:27:74:538:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:employers are legally required to provide leave from work following the birth of a child, as they 
28:669:53289:27:28:74:531:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:are in many countries, then both the willingness to supply labor and the total marginal revenue 
28:670:53385:28:28:74:452:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:product of labor are likely to shift disproportionately for female employees.18  
28:671:53466:28:27:108:539:239:144:Times:144:Times:?:Because of the differential effects of a targeted mandate across groups of employees, it is 
28:672:53558:27:28:74:505:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:important for purposes of the analysis of such mandates to separate out two distinct labor 
28:673:53649:28:28:74:522:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:markets: the market for employees targeted by the mandate and the market for the remaining 
28:674:53740:28:8:216:219:156:144:Times:144:Times:?: 
28:675:53740:8:13:72:311:148:49:Times:121:Times:F:17 See Jolls (2000) for further discussion of this point. 
28:676:53798:13:18:72:527:135:49:Times:121:Times:F:18 For expositional ease, the analysis below will assume that the mandated benefit has value only to the 
28:677:53903:18:12:72:532:117:121:Times:121:Times:F:targeted group and imposes costs only in connection with that group.  However, the conclusions offered 
28:678:54006:12:13:72:526:105:121:Times:121:Times:F:below would remain qualitatively uncharged if the mandate had some value beyond the targeted group 
28:679:54105:13:13:72:525:92:121:Times:121:Times:F:(although less than the value to the targeted group); the same is true if the mandate imposed some cost 
28:680:54209:13:0:72:417:79:121:Times:121:Times:F:beyond the targeted group (although less than the cost for the targeted group). 
29:681:54292:0:27:74:520:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:employees.  Each market will have its own labor supply and demand functions (although, as 
29:682:54382:27:28:74:527:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:described below, the demand functions will end up being the same if restrictions on wage and 
29:683:54475:28:27:74:520:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:employment differentials are binding).  And, because the demand for employees of one type 
29:684:54565:27:28:74:511:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:will depend, among other things, on the demand for employees of the other type, it will no 
29:685:54656:28:28:74:533:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:longer be possible to represent everything of interest on a single, two-dimensional labor supply 
29:686:54753:28:27:74:258:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:and demand diagram, as in Figure 1.   
29:687:54791:27:28:107:317:543:144:Times:144:Times:?:The following notation will be used below: 
29:688:54834:28:14:107:334:515:144:Times:144:Times:?:Et = employment level of targeted employees;  
29:689:54880:14:13:108:304:501:144:Times:144:Times:?:Wt = wage level of targeted employees;

29:692:55012:14:14:108:520:460:144:Times:144:Times:?:C (> 0) = per-worker-hour cost of providing mandated benefit to targeted employees; 
29:693:55096:14:14:108:451:446:144:Times:144:Times:?:V = per-worker-hour value of mandated benefit to targeted employees;

29:696:55239:14:28:108:491:405:144:Times:144:Times:?:Prior to the imposition of a targeted mandate, the wages earned by targeted and 
29:697:55319:28:27:72:527:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:nontargeted employees will be given by Wt = Wn = MRPL(Et + En).  Meanwhile, labor supply 
29:698:55408:27:28:72:535:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:for the two groups of employees prior to the imposition of a targeted mandate may be written as 
29:699:55504:28:27:72:114:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:follows: 
29:700:55513:27:14:108:163:295:144:Times:144:Times:?:Et = St(Wt) 
29:701:55525:14:14:108:169:281:144:Times:144:Times:?:En = Sn(Wn) 
29:702:55537:14:14:108:111:267:144:Times:144:Times:?: 
29:703:55537:14:27:72:511:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:Let (Wt°, Wn°, Et°, En°) with Et° > 0 and En° > 0 denote an interior solution to this system.  
29:704:55632:27:28:108:539:226:144:Times:144:Times:?:After the imposition of a targeted mandate, labor supply for the two groups of employees 
29:705:55721:28:28:72:272:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:will be given by the following equations: 
29:706:55763:28:13:108:517:170:144:Times:144:Times:?:Et = St(Wt + V);         (1)

29:708:55818:28:28:72:534:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:However, labor demand after the imposition of the mandate will depend on the degree to which 
29:709:55911:28:9:72:487:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:restrictions on wage and employment differentials are binding.  One possibility is that 
30:710:56002:9:0:72:216:92:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                
30:711:56050:0:27:72:528:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:restrictions on wage differentials are not binding (and restrictions on employment differentials 
30:712:56147:27:28:72:533:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:are or are not binding); in this case, as noted above, a targeted mandate may be analyzed within 
30:713:56244:28:27:72:531:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:the basic type of framework used in sections II through V above.19  A second possibility is that 
30:714:56341:27:28:71:533:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:restrictions on wage differentials are binding while restrictions on employment differentials are 
30:715:56439:28:28:72:533:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:not; in this case targeted employees will effectively be more expensive to employ (as they must 
30:716:56535:28:27:72:525:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:earn the same wage but cost the employer more), and employers will thus tend to reduce their 
30:717:56628:27:28:72:491:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:hiring of targeted employees.  The most interesting possibility, and the one that will be 
30:718:56718:28:27:72:484:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:examined in the remainder of this section, occurs when restrictions on both wage and 
30:719:56803:27:28:71:534:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:employment differentials are binding.  In this case there must not be any difference between the 
30:720:56900:28:28:72:507:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:wages or employment opportunities of targeted and nontargeted employees within a given 
30:721:56987:28:27:72:506:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:employment market; employers must pay each type of employee the same wage and must 
30:722:57070:27:28:72:454:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:demand each type in proportion to its willingness to supply labor at that wage.  
30:723:57151:28:27:108:526:377:144:Times:144:Times:?:  With binding restrictions on wage and employment differentials, the common wage W 
30:724:57235:27:28:72:488:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:for the two groups of employees after the imposition of the mandate will be given by:  
30:725:57322:28:27:108:454:322:144:Times:144:Times:?:W = [Et/(Et + En)][MRPL(Et + En) – C] + [En/(Et + En)]MRPL(Et + En). 
30:726:57391:27:28:74:128:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:Rewriting: 
30:727:57402:28:28:108:518:267:144:Times:144:Times:?:W = MRPL(Et + En) – [Et/(Et + En)]C.                                                                        (3)            
30:728:57525:28:27:74:527:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:The equation in (3), together with the labor supply equations in (1) and (2), yields a system of 
30:729:57622:27:28:74:490:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:three equations in three unknowns; let (W*, Et*, En*) denote a solution to this system. 
30:730:57710:28:27:108:498:184:144:Times:144:Times:?:As (3) shows, a targeted mandate will affect labor demand both as a result of the 
30:731:57792:27:28:74:534:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:mandate’s effect on MRPL through changes in Et + En and as a result of the direct cost C of the 
30:732:57888:28:37:74:529:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:mandated benefit.  With respect to the former effect, it is straightforward to show that because 
30:733:57985:37:8:216:219:92:144:Times:144:Times:?: 
30:734:57985:8:0:72:255:84:49:Times:121:Times:F:19 See Jolls (2000) for further discussion. 
31:735:58032:0:0:72:216:92:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                
31:736:58080:0:27:74:526:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the downward pressure on labor demand as a result of the cost of the mandated benefit, the 
31:737:58174:27:28:74:487:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:employment level of nontargeted employees will fall with the mandate:  En* < En°.20  
31:738:58259:28:27:74:510:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:Intuitively, the mandate, by requiring employers to incur costs for targeted employees that 
31:739:58351:27:28:74:531:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:nontargeted employees will have to share as a consequence of the binding restrictions on wage 
31:740:58445:28:28:74:538:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:and employment differentials, induces marginal nontargeted employees to exit the market.  This 
31:741:58540:28:27:74:529:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:relationship between En* and En° in turn allows one to depict the effects of a targeted mandate 
31:742:58636:27:28:74:506:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:on the wages and employment of targeted employees in simple graphical form in a figure 
31:743:58723:28:27:74:284:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Figure 2) similar to Figure 1 from above.   
31:744:58768:27:28:108:536:488:144:Times:144:Times:?:In Figure 2, the curve Dt° is the pre-mandate labor demand curve for targeted employees 
31:745:58856:28:28:74:527:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:at the pre-mandate equilibrium level of nontargeted employment (En°).  Thus, the curve Dt° is 
31:746:58950:28:27:74:525:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:given by W = MRPL(Et + En°).  Meanwhile, the curve Dt' is given by the following equation: 
31:747:59041:27:28:108:503:405:144:Times:144:Times:?: W = MRPL(Et + En°) – [Et/(Et + En*)]C.                                                                                    
31:748:59164:28:27:74:536:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:The curve Dt' thus depicts the effect of the shift due to the cost of the mandated benefit after the 
31:749:59265:27:28:74:532:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:mandate is imposed; the MRPL term is ignored by assuming that the marginal revenue product 
31:750:59356:28:27:74:518:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:of labor from production as a function of targeted employment (Et) is the same pre-and post-
31:751:59448:27:28:74:474:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:mandate (MRPL(Et + En°) in both cases).  Because, as noted above, En* < En°, it is 
31:752:59531:28:28:74:487:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:straightforward to see that the ultimate post-mandate labor demand curve for targeted 
31:753:59617:28:27:74:398:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:employees, with En = En*, must lie above the curve Dt' in Figure 2. 
31:754:59685:27:28:108:520:212:144:Times:144:Times:?:We are now in a position to assess the effects of a targeted mandate on the wages and 
31:755:59771:28:27:74:536:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:employment levels of targeted employees.  As the discussion in section I.A above suggests, it is 
31:756:59868:27:28:74:521:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:useful to separate the analysis into distinct cases based on the relationship between the value 
31:757:59964:28:37:74:532:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:and the cost of the mandated benefit.  The straightforward case is the one in which the value of 
31:758:60061:37:8:216:219:92:144:Times:144:Times:?: 
31:759:60061:8:0:72:205:84:49:Times:121:Times:F:20 See Jolls (2000) for details.

32:761:60145:0:27:74:518:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:the mandated benefit equals or exceeds its cost.21  In this case, not surprisingly, the targeted 
32:762:60242:27:28:74:482:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:employees’ wage will fall by less than the value of the mandated benefit, while their 
32:763:60328:28:27:74:323:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:employment level will rise, as depicted in Figure 2. 
32:764:60381:27:28:107:523:626:144:Times:144:Times:?:The more interesting case is the one in which the value of the mandated benefit is less 
32:765:60469:28:28:72:525:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:than its cost.  In this case it is no longer certain that targeted employees will be better off after 
32:766:60571:28:27:71:530:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:the mandate is imposed, but it remains likely; as long as the fraction of nontargeted individuals 
32:767:60669:27:28:72:520:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the qualified population is not too small, and the gap between the value and the cost of the 
32:768:60765:28:27:72:512:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:mandated benefit is not too large, a targeted mandate will always make targeted employees 
32:769:60855:27:28:72:481:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:better off.  If, for example, nontargeted employees constitute the vast majority of the 
32:770:60943:28:28:72:529:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:employment market in question, then the fall in the total marginal revenue product of labor for 
32:771:61039:28:27:72:512:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:all employees in that market with the imposition of a targeted mandate will be small, as the 
32:772:61132:27:28:72:513:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:average cost of the mandated benefit across the employment market will be small.  And the 
32:773:61222:28:27:72:508:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:smaller the downward shift in the total marginal revenue product of labor as a result of the 
32:774:61315:27:28:72:537:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:mandated benefit cost, the smaller the gap between the curves Dt° and Dt' in Figure 2, and hence 
32:775:61412:28:27:72:526:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:the lower the likelihood that this gap will exceed the downward shift in the labor supply curve 
32:776:61508:27:28:72:525:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:(St° to St').  As long as the downward shift in the labor supply curve equals or exceeds the gap 
32:777:61605:28:28:72:493:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:between Dt° and Dt' over the relevant range of employment levels, the wage of targeted 
32:778:61692:28:27:72:536:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:employees will fall by less than the value of the mandated benefit, while their employment level 
32:779:61789:27:56:72:117:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:will rise. 
32:780:61800:56:8:216:219:156:144:Times:144:Times:?: 
32:781:61800:8:18:72:524:148:49:Times:121:Times:F:21 In the absence of any market failure – the assumption maintained throughout this section – a benefit 
32:782:61904:18:13:71:536:130:121:Times:121:Times:F:whose value equals or exceeds its cost might, but conceivably would not, be provided in the absence of a 
32:783:62009:13:12:71:530:117:121:Times:121:Times:F:mandate.  Because the benefit accrues exclusively or disproportionately to targeted employees, it seems 
32:784:62113:12:13:71:512:105:121:Times:121:Times:F:possible that the benefit would not be provided (with binding restrictions on wage and employment 
32:785:62211:13:13:71:539:92:121:Times:121:Times:F:differentials) even if the value of the benefit exceeded its cost.  This issue is not analyzed rigorously here, 
32:786:62323:13:0:71:114:79:121:Times:121:Times:F:however. 
33:787:62335:0:0:72:216:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                
33:788:62383:0:27:108:538:708:144:Times:144:Times:?:Thus, targeted mandates may be justifiable on distributive grounds even when the cost of 
33:789:62472:27:28:72:490:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:the mandated benefit exceeds its value.22  In the case of general mandates, by contrast, 
33:790:62561:28:27:72:506:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:distributive considerations cannot justify legal intervention when the cost of the mandated 
33:791:62653:27:28:72:526:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:benefit exceeds its value because, as noted in section I.A above, the employees’ wage will fall 
33:792:62749:28:28:72:538:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:by more than the value of the benefit to them.  This effect occurs because there is no other group 
33:793:62848:28:27:72:535:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:to whom to shift costs.  But with targeted mandates, even if the value of the mandated benefit is 
33:794:62946:27:28:72:514:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:less than its cost, the mandate may make targeted employees better off because nontargeted 
33:795:63037:28:27:72:308:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:employees will bear some of the associated cost. 
33:796:63086:27:28:108:539:488:144:Times:144:Times:?:The point about potential distributive gains wholly apart from market failure is especially 
33:797:63178:28:28:72:526:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:important because the fact that the value of a mandated benefit is less than its cost may reflect 
33:798:63276:28:27:72:508:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:precisely the undesirable distributive situation that employment law seeks to remedy.  The 
33:799:63367:27:28:72:524:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:reason is that “value” in this framework is measured by employees’ willingness to pay for the 
33:800:63461:28:27:72:518:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:benefit by accepting lower wages, and the distributive situation of targeted employees might 
33:801:63554:27:28:72:519:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:preclude them from accepting lower wages (see generally Dworkin 1980).  If, for instance, a 
33:802:63646:28:27:72:501:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:mandate requires employers to provide medical leave to employees with serious medical 
33:803:63732:27:28:72:527:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:problems, the value (measured by willingness to pay) of this benefit to the targeted employees 
33:804:63827:28:28:72:534:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:may be limited not by the utility of the leave to these employees but by their financial position.  
33:805:63927:28:27:72:381:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:Mandated medical leave is discussed further in the next section.

33:812:64099:18:0:71:157:79:121:Times:121:Times:F:and Shavell 1994).

34:815:64212:27:28:108:538:681:144:Times:144:Times:?:As suggested above, some targeted mandates arise under employment discrimination law 
34:816:64297:28:27:72:511:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:and, for that reason, are not analyzed further in this paper.23  The primary employment law 
34:817:64389:27:28:71:528:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:application of the analysis of targeted mandates is workplace leave mandates, which at least in 
34:818:64485:28:28:71:487:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:the United States arise under employment law outside of what is generally considered 
34:819:64570:28:27:71:472:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:employment discrimination law.24  Workplace leave mandates in the United States 
34:820:64650:27:28:72:519:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:disproportionately target both disabled employees (through mandated entitlement to medical 
34:821:64741:28:27:72:520:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:leave) and female employees (through mandated entitlement to leave following the birth of a 
34:822:64833:27:28:72:503:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:child).25  These two aspects of mandated workplace leave are considered in turn below.26 
34:823:64921:28:28:108:111:460:144:Times:144:Times:?: 
34:824:64921:28:27:108:432:432:144:Times:144:Times:?:1.            Mandated            medical            leave                                                            
34:825:65039:27:28:108:496:405:144:Times:144:Times:?:As noted above, the wage and employment effects of a targeted mandate depend 
34:826:65116:28:27:72:534:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:significantly on the degree to which restrictions on wage and employment differentials between 
34:827:65211:27:28:72:539:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:targeted and nontargeted employees are binding.  Starting with restrictions on wage differentials, 
34:828:65310:28:27:72:527:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:such restrictions are likely to be binding in the absence of significant occupational segregation 
34:829:65408:27:8:216:219:295:144:Times:144:Times:?: 
34:830:65408:8:18:72:534:287:49:Times:121:Times:F:23 Disability discrimination law, for instance, requires employers to make “reasonable accommodations” 
34:831:65511:18:13:71:513:269:121:Times:121:Times:F:for disabling conditions – a mandate targeted to employees with disabilities (Acemoglu and Angrist 
34:832:65610:13:12:71:498:256:121:Times:121:Times:F:2001).  Similarly, to the extent that sex discrimination law requires health insurance coverage of 
34:833:65709:12:8:71:514:244:121:Times:121:Times:F:maternity-related medical costs, it imposes a mandate targeted to female employees (Gruber 1994a) 
34:834:65807:8:17:72:530:236:49:Times:121:Times:F:24 The Family and Medical Leave Act, which requires employers to provide employees with leave from 
34:835:65906:17:13:71:511:219:121:Times:121:Times:F:work under specified conditions, is not part of any of the employment discrimination statutes in the 
34:836:66007:13:13:71:496:206:121:Times:121:Times:F:United States and is administered by the Department of Labor rather than the agency (the Equal 
34:837:66102:13:7:71:485:193:121:Times:121:Times:F:Employment Opportunity Commission) that administers employment discrimination statutes. 
34:838:66190:7:18:72:519:186:49:Times:121:Times:F:25 Mandated leave following the birth of a child is targeted to female employees even though leave is 
34:839:66292:18:13:71:511:168:121:Times:121:Times:F:typically available to male employees because female employees who have biological children will 
34:840:66389:13:12:71:533:155:121:Times:121:Times:F:require at least a brief period of time off from work after a birth to recover from the temporary disability 
34:841:66498:12:13:71:537:143:121:Times:121:Times:F:associated with giving birth and, thus, will almost certainly (for purely biological reasons) be more likely 
34:842:66607:13:8:71:239:130:121:Times:121:Times:F:than male employees to take leave.     
34:843:66646:8:17:72:517:122:49:Times:121:Times:F:26 Another targeted mandate in the United States is the Mental Health Parity Act, which requires that 
34:844:66748:17:13:71:504:105:121:Times:121:Times:F:coverage of mental and physical conditions under health insurance plans be comparable in certain 
34:845:66845:13:13:71:534:92:121:Times:121:Times:F:respects.  Because this law is generally believed to be of modest practical impact, it seems unlikely to be 
34:846:66953:13:0:71:260:79:121:Times:121:Times:F:the source of observable empirical effects. 
35:847:67000:0:27:72:534:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:between targeted and nontargeted groups.  Legal restrictions on wage differentials are generally 
35:848:67097:27:28:72:514:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:fairly easy to enforce (e.g., Posner 1987), and, moreover, employers may have incentives to 
35:849:67189:28:27:72:507:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:adhere to norms of pay equity wholly apart from legal restrictions because of the potential 
35:850:67281:27:28:72:538:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:morale problems that can result from inequity in wages between different groups performing the 
35:851:67376:28:28:72:136:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:same work.   
35:852:67389:28:27:108:482:570:144:Times:144:Times:?:In the case of mandated entitlement to medical leave, the group of employees 
35:853:67466:27:28:72:529:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:disproportionately (though of course not exclusively) targeted by such a mandate is employees 
35:854:67560:28:27:72:487:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:with disabilities, some of whom will be significantly more likely to require leave than 
35:855:67648:27:28:72:529:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:nondisabled employees.  With respect to occupational segregation, at least in the United States 
35:856:67744:28:28:72:535:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:employees with disabilities are not significantly segregated, so restrictions on wage differentials 
35:857:67844:28:27:72:396:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:between employees with and without disabilities are likely to bind. 
35:858:67912:27:28:108:487:405:144:Times:144:Times:?:Likewise, with respect to restrictions on employment differentials, while these 
35:859:67992:28:27:72:529:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:restrictions are unlikely to bind directly for employees with and without disabilities because of 
35:860:68090:27:28:72:524:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:the difficulty of enforcing such restrictions (e.g., Posner 1987), the ultimate effect may be the 
35:861:68188:28:27:72:520:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:same in analyzing mandated entitlement to medical leave because many of the conditions for 
35:862:68279:27:28:72:534:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:which such leave will be required are unobservable to employers at the time of hiring and, thus, 
35:863:68376:28:28:72:530:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:cannot be the basis of differential employment decisions (Jolls 2006).  In this case, the analysis 
35:864:68475:28:27:72:519:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:in section VI.A above predicts that mandated entitlement to medical leave will increase both 
35:865:68568:27:28:72:503:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:wages and employment levels of employees with disabilities, unless either the fraction of 
35:866:68658:28:27:72:531:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:targeted individuals in the qualified population is too large or the cost of the leave significantly 
35:867:68759:27:28:72:521:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:exceeds its value.  In the United States, because medical leave under the Family and Medical 
35:868:68852:28:28:72:538:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:Leave Act (FMLA) is unpaid, it seems unlikely that the cost of this benefit significantly exceeds 
35:869:68950:28:0:72:118:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:its value. 
36:870:68964:0:0:72:216:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:

36:872:69095:27:28:72:534:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:entitlement to medical leave under the FMLA on employees with disabilities is a comparison of 
36:873:69189:28:27:72:534:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:wages and employment levels of such individuals before and after the FMLA went into effect – 
36:874:69282:27:28:72:533:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:ideally with an additional comparison between states in which mandated entitlement to medical 
36:875:69376:28:28:72:506:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:leave under the FMLA was an innovation and those in which it was not.  Both approaches 
36:876:69463:28:27:72:494:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggest neutral to positive effects of mandated entitlement to medical leave on disabled 
36:877:69552:27:28:72:538:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:employment levels (relative to nondisabled employment levels), with the most credible evidence 
36:878:69647:28:27:72:515:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggesting positive effects (Jolls 2006).  This evidence underlines the prospects for positive 
36:879:69742:27:28:72:535:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects of targeted mandates on the employment opportunities of targeted employees, consistent

36:887:70325:28:28:72:516:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:employment markets remain quite segregated.27  With substantial occupational segregation, 
36:888:70415:28:27:72:537:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:restrictions on wage differentials will tend to be of little force because the only comparisons that 
36:889:70516:27:28:72:542:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:are drawn in the law are those between employees within the same employment market (or, more 
36:890:70609:28:79:72:512:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:technically, those performing the same or similar work).  As noted above, in the absence of

37:897:71046:28:27:108:529:653:144:Times:144:Times:?:Mandated entitlement to leave from work following the birth of a child exists in a wide 
37:898:71134:27:28:72:528:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:array of countries and has been extensively studied.  Waldfogel (1999), for instance, examines 
37:899:71229:28:28:72:532:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:female employees’ wages and employment levels in the aftermath of the FMLA’s enactment in 
37:900:71319:28:27:72:528:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:the United States and finds no consistent pattern of statistically significant results.  The lack of 
37:901:71420:27:28:72:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:clear results may stem in part from the fact that, as Waldfogel notes, many female employees 
37:902:71513:28:27:72:536:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:were entitled (by state legislation or firm policy) to FMLA-type benefits following the birth of a 
37:903:71612:27:28:71:286:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:child even prior to the FMLA’s enactment.   
37:904:71656:28:28:107:536:460:144:Times:144:Times:?:Another test of the effects of mandated entitlement to leave following the birth of a child 
37:905:71748:28:27:74:540:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:comes from looking at the effects of European leave laws.  Ruhm (1998), for instance, finds that 
37:906:71845:27:28:74:523:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:the length of the leave period under these laws generally is negatively related to the wages of 
37:907:71941:28:27:74:496:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:female employees and positively related to their employment levels.  Note that because 
37:908:72028:27:28:74:517:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:employees’ leave is paid, in contrast to the situation under the FMLA, positive employment 
37:909:72119:28:27:74:496:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects are more likely under the European laws, which are presumably valued more by 
37:910:72204:27:28:74:518:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:employees than the FMLA because of the paid nature of the leave.  (Negative labor demand 
37:911:72293:28:28:74:526:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects of paid leave are blunted by government rather than employer financing of the leave.)  
37:912:72388:28:27:74:499:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:An exception to the general pattern of Ruhm’s findings is that the effect of having some 
37:913:72477:27:28:74:537:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:mandated leave versus none – as distinguished from the effect of having a short mandated leave 
37:914:72572:28:27:74:528:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:versus a long mandated leave – has no statistically significant effect (rather than a statistically 
37:915:72672:27:27:74:534:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:significant negative effect) on wages of female employees.  This may result from the fact that a

37:917:72769:8:17:72:530:122:49:Times:121:Times:F:28 Of course, very few employment markets are actually perfectly segregated, so that there is absolutely 
37:918:72873:17:13:71:512:105:121:Times:121:Times:F:no opportunity to compare targeted and nontargeted employees’ wage levels.  Jolls (2000) provides

38:922:73208:0:27:74:518:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:short leave, as opposed to a long leave, imposes relatively few costs on employers, and thus 
38:923:73301:27:28:74:312:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:provides little occasion for a wage adjustment.29  
38:924:73352:28:27:108:538:653:144:Times:144:Times:?:Overall, the empirical evidence on mandated entitlement to leave following the birth of a 
38:925:73442:27:28:74:540:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:child suggests neutral to positive employment effects – the same broad pattern as with mandated 
38:926:73538:28:28:74:531:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:entitlements to medical leave.  Wage effects, by contrast, appear more negative with mandated 
38:927:73632:28:27:74:532:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:leave after the birth of a child – a likely consequence of the degree of occupational segregation 
38:928:73730:27:28:74:511:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:by sex.  Note, however, that because sex (in contrast to many medical conditions) is easily 
38:929:73822:28:27:74:538:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:observable to employers, decreasing occupational segregation by sex over time is more likely to 
38:930:73918:27:28:74:528:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:generate job losses from mandated entitlement to leave following the birth of a child (as wage 
38:931:74013:28:28:74:525:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:adjustments are precluded by decreased segregation) than to produce the benefits for targeted

38:935:74204:27:28:108:530:350:144:Times:144:Times:?: One of the most fundamental issues in employment law involves the general conditions 
38:936:74289:28:27:72:511:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:under which employers may engage in “the industrial equivalent of capital punishment” by 
38:937:74378:27:28:72:515:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:discharging an employee.30  In many countries, a pervasive set of laws limits the conditions 
38:938:74471:28:28:72:524:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:under which employees may be discharged without attendant legal obligations (e.g., Blau and 
38:939:74563:28:27:72:494:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:Kahn 1999).  In the United States, by contrast, a sharply different approach prevails; an 
38:940:74653:27:28:72:541:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:employee may generally be fired at any time, without identification of any reason whatsoever for 
38:941:74750:28:28:72:512:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:the discharge and without any attendant employer obligations, unless either the employee’s

38:944:74948:18:13:71:521:130:121:Times:121:Times:F:a child is that, as Waldfogel (1998, 1999) emphasizes, such mandates may have a sort of composition 
38:945:75048:13:12:71:536:117:121:Times:121:Times:F:effect, moving female employees into, or keeping them in, better, higher-level jobs.  If this is so, then the 
38:946:75158:12:13:71:526:105:121:Times:121:Times:F:aggregate effects of the mandates may be more mixed and more complex than the effects suggested by

39:952:75631:28:27:72:528:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:United States (Montana) departs from this regime of “at will” employment.  The United States 
39:953:75724:27:28:72:543:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:does have an unemployment insurance system, which is a limited form of employment protection 
39:954:75817:28:28:72:542:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:and is discussed in the next section, but (outside of Montana) there is no general requirement that 
39:955:75917:28:27:72:520:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:employers offer any sort of justification when discharging an employee and no general set of

40:977:77536:27:28:72:513:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:place.  Models of these types of competing effects are discussed in chapter 25 (by Blau and

40:990:78347:28:27:71:542:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:discharge employees without offering an adequate justification for the discharge leads employees 
40:991:78444:27:28:72:525:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:to oversupply labor at a given wage rate.  Empirical evidence on this form of market failure is 
40:992:78540:28:28:72:242:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:discussed in section VII.B below.

40:994:78663:27:28:72:529:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:they can only be discharged after a threshold level of justification has been met, then wrongful 
40:995:78760:28:27:72:503:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:discharge laws can improve both employee welfare and efficiency by eliminating the gap 
40:996:78847:27:28:72:541:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:between employees’ observed and “true” willingness to supply labor.  With a wrongful discharge 
40:997:78942:28:24:72:529:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:law in place, the governing regime is consistent with employees’ belief – although of course in

40:999:79038:8:18:72:524:97:49:Times:121:Times:F:32 Levine (1991) notes additional potential market failures in this context, including cognitive bias and

41:1010:79805:28:28:72:519:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:employer-side information failures may also justify wrongful discharge laws.  Intuitively, an 
41:1011:79899:28:27:72:504:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:individual employer may not offer wrongful discharge protection on its own, even if such

41:1013:80082:28:27:72:508:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:the individual employer who offers the protection may become a magnet for less desirable 
41:1014:80171:27:28:72:135:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:employees.   
41:1015:80184:28:27:108:532:322:144:Times:144:Times:?: In Levine’s model, employees are of two different types, and discharge occurs either on 
41:1016:80272:27:28:72:516:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:an at will basis – where employers need not provide any reason for discharge – or on a “just 
41:1017:80365:28:28:72:491:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:cause” basis – where employers must prove employee malfeasance in order to justify a 
41:1018:80450:28:27:72:542:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:discharge.  Note that, by contrast to the focus in sections II through VI above on models in which 
41:1019:80549:27:28:72:537:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:employees are paid in accordance with the marginal revenue product of labor, Levine’s model is 
41:1020:80644:28:27:72:527:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:a species of efficiency-wage model, in which employees may earn rents in order to discourage 
41:1021:80737:27:28:72:510:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:shirking.  Levine shows that a single firm may not profit from adopting just cause when its 
41:1022:80829:28:0:72:532:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:competitors do not adopt it, even if such an approach, adopted universally, would be efficiency-
42:1023:80928:0:27:72:539:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:increasing.  Because of the phenomenon of adverse selection, a mandated just cause requirement 
42:1024:81023:27:28:72:325:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:may enhance both efficiency and employee welfare.

42:1030:81345:28:27:72:516:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:addition, in the time since this volume of the Handbook of Labor Economics was published, 
42:1031:81435:27:28:72:519:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:studies by Miles (2000), Autor (2003), and Autor, Donohue and Schwab (2006) have further 
42:1032:81524:28:28:72:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:examined the wage and employment effects of wrongful discharge laws in the United States.  
42:1033:81615:28:27:72:505:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:Both Miles (2000) and Autor (2003) find a significant positive relationship between more

42:1039:81984:27:28:108:542:267:144:Times:144:Times:?:The available empirical evidence on the efficiency of wrongful discharge laws bears most 
42:1040:82073:28:27:72:507:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:strongly on the first potential market failure discussed above – employee-side information 
42:1041:82164:27:28:72:526:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:failure.  Kim (1997, 1999) presents evidence that most individuals in the United States are not 
42:1042:82260:28:27:72:528:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:aware of the fact that employers need not meet some threshold level of justification in order to 
42:1043:82357:27:28:72:506:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:discharge their employees.  Kim surveyed a total of 921 recently discharged employees at 
42:1044:82446:28:28:72:535:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:unemployment benefits offices in California, Missouri, and New York in the late 1990s.  To file 
42:1045:82542:28:0:72:534:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:a claim for unemployment benefits, claimants in these states must appear in person at a benefits 
43:1046:82642:0:27:72:510:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:office.  In Kim’s study, claimants were approached while waiting for assistance at benefits 
43:1047:82734:27:28:72:525:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:offices and asked if they would complete a written survey.  Presumably because the claimants 
43:1048:82827:28:27:72:520:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:were already waiting and did not have the option to be elsewhere, response rates were high – 
43:1049:82920:27:28:72:341:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:85% in California and Missouri and 69% in New York. 
43:1050:82972:28:28:108:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:?:The surveys in Kim’s study asked respondents to consider specific scenarios in which 
43:1051:83057:28:27:72:525:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:individuals were discharged without a good reason and then to indicate whether they believed 
43:1052:83150:27:28:72:538:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:such discharges would be found to be lawful by a court of law.  For instance, one question asked 
43:1053:83247:28:27:72:542:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:about the lawfulness of a termination based upon personal dislike of the employee; another asked 
43:1054:83344:27:28:72:542:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:whether it was lawful to terminate an employee based on a mistaken belief that the employee had 
43:1055:83440:28:28:72:535:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:stolen money (a belief that the employee could prove was incorrect).  While such discharges are 
43:1056:83536:28:27:72:510:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:unquestionably permitted under the law in the United States (outside of Montana), the vast 
43:1057:83627:27:28:72:534:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:majority of respondents believed that the discharges were unlawful.  Table 1 below summarizes 
43:1058:83721:28:27:72:183:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:Kim’s main findings.   
43:1059:83744:27:28:108:501:350:144:Times:144:Times:?:One issue with Kim’s findings is whether unemployment insurance claimants are 
43:1060:83822:28:27:72:539:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:representative of the overall employee population in the United States.  On the one hand, as Kim 
43:1061:83919:27:28:72:533:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:notes, individuals who recently lost their jobs may be more likely than the average employee to 
43:1062:84015:28:28:72:513:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:have some familiarity with the legal regime governing discharge, precisely because of their 
43:1063:84107:28:27:72:515:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:recent experience with being discharged.  In addition, because eligibility for unemployment 
43:1064:84199:27:28:72:526:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:benefits requires both that the claimant have some prior attachment to the labor market (in the 
43:1065:84295:28:27:72:542:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:form of a minimum number of weeks employed) and that the claimant undertake an active search 
43:1066:84388:27:28:72:543:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:for new employment, claimants’ beliefs should provide a good measure of what a job seeker with 
43:1067:84483:28:28:72:538:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:labor market experience knows at the moment at which a decision is made about accepting a job 
43:1068:84577:28:0:72:531:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:offer from a particular employer.  On the other hand, unemployment benefits claimants may be 
44:1069:84673:0:27:72:521:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:less informed than the average employee about the legal rules governing termination because 
44:1070:84765:27:28:72:506:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:those who are better informed – and thus realize that they have no legal protection against 
44:1071:84857:28:27:72:521:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:discharge without an adequate justification – may better protect themselves from involuntary 
44:1072:84950:27:28:72:537:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:termination.  Balancing these various factors, there does not appear to be a strong a priori reason 
44:1073:85050:28:28:72:520:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:to believe that unemployment benefits claimants will be systematically less aware than other 
44:1074:85143:28:27:72:521:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:employees of the United States rule of at will employment, thought only additional empirical 
44:1075:85236:27:28:72:281:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:study can definitively resolve the question. 
44:1076:85281:28:27:108:526:515:144:Times:144:Times:?:Note that because unemployment benefits claimants are disproportionately individuals 
44:1077:85366:27:28:72:534:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:who earned low to moderate, rather than high, wages prior to their discharge from employment, 
44:1078:85460:28:28:72:517:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:Kim’s evidence bears most directly on the existence of employee-side information failure in 
44:1079:85552:28:27:72:538:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:employment markets other than those involving highly compensated employees.  However, Kim 
44:1080:85642:27:28:72:533:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:finds that erroneous beliefs about the legal rules governing discharge are common regardless of 
44:1081:85738:28:27:72:508:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:education level.  In Missouri, for instance, respondents with college degrees still exhibited 
44:1082:85832:27:28:72:458:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:strongly mistaken beliefs about the legal rules governing discharge (Kim 1997). 
44:1083:85912:28:27:108:518:322:144:Times:144:Times:?:Kim’s findings suggest that employees often do not have good information about the 
44:1084:85995:27:28:72:534:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:United States rule of at-will employment.  While in some search models a limited proportion of 
44:1085:86090:28:28:72:514:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:informed actors may eliminate the effects of information failure in markets (e.g., Wilde and 
44:1086:86183:28:27:71:503:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:Schwartz 1979), Kim’s evidence suggests that the proportion of United States employees 
44:1087:86270:27:28:72:538:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:suffering from information failure is extremely large.  While the empirical support for employee-
44:1088:86367:28:27:72:524:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:side information failure is thus large, it is, as noted above, not clear exactly what legal reform 
44:1089:86466:27:28:72:538:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:would bring the treatment of discharge in the United States in line with employees’ expectations 
44:1090:86563:28:28:72:280:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:or what the costs of such reform would be.

45:1093:86648:27:28:107:498:681:144:Times:144:Times:?:Unemployment insurance, briefly noted in the preceding section, is an extremely 
45:1094:86728:28:27:71:533:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:common, although limited, form of employment protection.  Unemployment insurance requires 
45:1095:86818:27:28:71:533:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:the payment of benefits in lieu of wages upon discharge from employment, typically (at least in 
45:1096:86914:28:28:71:474:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:the United States) without regard for the reason for the discharge except in extreme 
45:1097:86999:28:27:71:508:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:circumstances.  Under the United States system, benefits are financed by a payroll tax that 
45:1098:87091:27:28:71:293:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:employers must pay on a per-employee basis. 
45:1099:87135:28:27:107:536:515:144:Times:144:Times:?:Both theory and evidence relating to unemployment insurance are developed at length in 
45:1100:87222:27:28:71:485:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:chapters 13 (by Atkinson) and 33 (by Krueger and Meyer) of the Handbook of Public 
45:1101:87304:28:28:71:491:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:Economics, and, thus, the reader is referred to that volume for further discussion of the 
45:1102:87394:28:27:71:531:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:economics of unemployment insurance.  In brief, Krueger and Meyer, in the more recent of the 
45:1103:87487:27:28:71:516:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:two chapters, conclude that the empirical evidence suggests longer periods out of work with 
45:1104:87579:28:27:71:537:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:more generous unemployment insurance benefits – a finding, like its counterpart in the workers’ 
45:1105:87675:27:28:71:483:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:compensation context from section III above, with ambiguous welfare consequences.

45:1108:87797:27:28:107:542:267:144:Times:144:Times:?: Among the most extensively discussed rules within the economic analysis of employment 
45:1109:87883:28:27:71:500:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:law are minimum wage rules.  Under these rules, employers must pay a legally-specified 
45:1110:87970:27:28:71:533:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:minimum wage to employees.  An important opening observation about these rules is that, akin 
45:1111:88063:28:27:71:538:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:to the analysis in section VI above, the usual role of market failure in justifying employment law 
45:1112:88162:27:28:71:534:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:rules is altered.  Even in the absence of market failure, a minimum wage rule may increase total 
45:1113:88259:28:0:71:485:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:employee income and, thus, at least by this measure, may enhance employee welfare. 
46:1114:88345:0:27:108:533:708:144:Times:144:Times:?: For minimum wage rules to increase not only total employee income but also efficiency 
46:1115:88431:27:28:72:523:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:and the income of each individual worker, market failure is necessary.  It is often observed in 
46:1116:88527:28:27:72:524:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:discussions of minimum wage rules that market failure in the form of monopsony may justify 
46:1117:88618:27:28:72:532:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:such rules.  This is so because, as discussed in section I.B above, under monopsony the wage is 
46:1118:88714:28:28:72:523:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:set below the marginal revenue product of labor.  Anything that moves the wage closer to the 
46:1119:88807:28:27:72:527:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:marginal revenue product of labor will both enhance efficiency and make all employees better 
46:1120:88900:27:28:72:92:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:off. 
46:1121:88905:28:27:108:526:515:144:Times:144:Times:?:Both theory and evidence relating to minimum wage rules are developed in chapter 32

46:1126:89209:28:27:108:536:377:144:Times:144:Times:?:The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) in the United States imposes both minimum wage 
46:1127:89292:27:28:72:534:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:rules – discussed in the preceding section – and overtime pay requirements, which are the focus 
46:1128:89388:28:27:72:541:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the present section.  Under overtime pay requirements, employers are legally required to pay a 
46:1129:89486:27:28:72:512:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:wage premium for hours above a specified weekly or other threshold.  In the United States, 
46:1130:89577:28:28:72:533:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:employers generally must pay one and a half times the normal wage for hours worked above 40 
46:1131:89669:28:27:72:530:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:hours per week.  This section describes both theoretical and empirical analysis of overtime pay

46:1135:89831:27:28:108:528:129:144:Times:144:Times:?:  Overtime pay requirements, like the employment law rules discussed in the preceding 
46:1136:89917:28:0:72:531:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:sections, represent a legally prescribed term in the employment relationship.  However, there is 
47:1137:90017:0:27:72:535:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:an important analytic difference between overtime pay requirements and the rules considered in 
47:1138:90112:27:28:72:523:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:all of the preceding sections.  In the case of overtime pay requirements, the legally prescribed 
47:1139:90209:28:27:72:526:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:term simply concerns the form within which dollars are paid to an employee, rather than some 
47:1140:90302:27:28:72:531:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:other aspect (such as the safety, privacy, or wage level) of the job.  In principle, then, it may be 
47:1141:90403:28:28:72:533:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:possible for employers to undo completely the effects of overtime pay requirements (Ehrenberg 
47:1142:90497:28:27:72:541:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Schumann 1982, pp. 36-37).  To borrow Trejo’s (1991) example, suppose that in the absence 
47:1143:90591:27:28:72:534:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:of overtime pay regulation, an employee works 50 hours per week and earns $11 per hour.  The 
47:1144:90684:28:27:72:533:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:employer in this circumstance could satisfy the FLSA by reducing the employee’s straight-time 
47:1145:90778:27:28:72:530:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:wage to $10 per hour and then paying time and a half for the 10 hours in excess of the 40-hour-
47:1146:90873:28:28:72:528:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:per-week cutoff.  The employee would be in an identical situation, working 50 hours per week 
47:1147:90966:28:27:72:525:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:for $550 in pay.  By contrast, when, for instance, a particular workplace safety mandate is put 
47:1148:91062:27:28:71:513:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:into effect, employers in the new equilibrium must provide the new safety feature (possibly 
47:1149:91154:28:27:71:465:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:compensated by lower wages) and cannot directly replicate the prior equilibrium. 
47:1150:91235:27:28:107:510:350:144:Times:144:Times:?:Of course, there are limits on the foregoing account of the undoing of overtime pay 
47:1151:91319:28:27:71:521:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:requirements.  To the extent that straight-time wages are at least somewhat sticky, employers 
47:1152:91413:27:28:71:507:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:may not be able to adjust such wages continuously over time in response to the number of 
47:1153:91502:28:28:71:493:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:desired overtime hours.  In addition, adjustment will be either impossible or limited for 
47:1154:91592:28:27:71:530:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:employees whose straight-time wages are at or near the legal minimum wage level prior to any 
47:1155:91685:27:28:71:536:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:requirement of overtime pay.  Both of these points are emphasized by Trejo (1991).  Ultimately, 
47:1156:91781:28:27:71:500:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:then, empirical evidence is necessary to determine whether the theoretical account of the 
47:1157:91871:27:28:71:361:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:irrelevance of overtime pay requirements is true in practice. 
47:1158:91933:28:28:107:530:129:144:Times:144:Times:?:To the extent that overtime pay requirements are not completely undone – as a result of 
47:1159:92021:28:0:71:524:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:various forms of wage stickiness or other factors – is there a market failure to which overtime 
48:1160:92120:0:27:72:542:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:pay requirements might be thought to be responsive?  The conventional view is that intensive use 
48:1161:92217:27:28:72:500:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:of a smaller set of employees, instead of reliance on a broader group of employees, has a 
48:1162:92307:28:27:72:521:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:negative externality effect on those individuals who are unable to obtain employment when a 
48:1163:92399:27:28:72:525:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:smaller group of employees is used intensively.  To the extent that overtime pay requirements 
48:1164:92493:28:28:72:525:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase employment levels to some degree, it is possible that these requirements represent an 
48:1165:92588:28:27:72:342:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:effective response to the negative externality just noted.

48:1168:92698:27:28:108:527:488:144:Times:144:Times:?:In an effort to determine whether overtime pay requirements are effectively undone by 
48:1169:92784:28:28:72:540:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:changes in base wages, Trejo (1991) studies differences in base wages across employees covered 
48:1170:92879:28:27:72:519:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:and not covered by the overtime pay requirements of the FLSA.  The noncovered employees 
48:1171:92967:27:28:72:537:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:used in Trejo’s analyses – who are comparable to covered employees in being paid on an hourly 
48:1172:93061:28:27:72:538:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:basis – include nonsupervisory agricultural workers, many transportation employees, and certain 
48:1173:93157:27:28:72:538:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:retail and services employees.  (The largest group of employees not covered by the overtime pay 
48:1174:93253:28:27:72:508:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:requirements are employees who are paid on a salary rather than an hourly basis, but these 
48:1175:93344:27:28:72:531:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:individuals would, for obvious reasons, provide a weak control group for examining the effects 
48:1176:93439:28:28:72:536:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:of overtime pay requirements on covered, hourly wage employees.)  Using a sample of repeated 
48:1177:93532:28:27:72:525:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:cross sections, Trejo finds that the hourly wages of covered employees are significantly lower 
48:1178:93627:27:28:72:520:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:than the hourly wages of noncovered employees.  According to Trejo, this evidence provides 
48:1179:93718:28:27:72:531:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:some suggestion that overtime pay requirements are partially, although not completely, undone 
48:1180:93812:27:28:72:536:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:by adjustments in straight-time wages.  Potential limits on Trejo’s empirical analysis include the 
48:1181:93911:28:28:72:533:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:fact that the results are somewhat sensitive to the measure of wages used (with weekly earnings 
48:1182:94007:28:0:72:510:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:yielding results different from those just described) and the limited degree of identification 
49:1183:94105:0:27:72:530:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:resulting from possible unobservable differences across individuals in hourly wage jobs within 
49:1184:94200:27:28:72:536:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:covered versus noncovered sectors.  In contrast to Trejo, Hunt (1999), examining evidence from 
49:1185:94295:28:27:72:524:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:Germany, finds increases rather than decreases in wages in response to strengthened overtime 
49:1186:94388:27:28:72:496:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:pay requirements negotiated between unions (which are industry-wide in Germany) and 
49:1187:94472:28:28:72:495:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:employers; wages may well be less flexible in Europe than in the United States.  Hunt’s 
49:1188:94560:28:27:72:536:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:identification strategy has the virtue of employing both cross sectional and time series variation. 
49:1189:94660:27:28:108:490:543:144:Times:144:Times:?:In addition to examination of whether base wages adjust to offset overtime pay 
49:1190:94739:28:27:71:519:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:requirements, empirical work has directly studied the linked question of whether workweeks 
49:1191:94830:27:28:71:521:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:longer than 40 hours in the United States are less frequent with overtime pay requirements in 
49:1192:94924:28:28:71:519:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:place.  (Only with imperfect wage adjustments should such workweeks be less frequent with 
49:1193:95014:28:27:71:503:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:overtime pay requirements in place.)  Costa (2000) examines changes in the frequency of 
49:1194:95102:27:28:71:533:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:overtime hours with the passage of the FLSA and finds a significant reduction in the proportion 
49:1195:95198:28:27:71:519:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:of employees working such hours.  Costa also finds much greater reduction in the South – in 
49:1196:95290:27:28:71:518:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:which more employees were at the minimum wage level and, thus, could not be subjected to 
49:1197:95379:28:27:71:522:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:wage adjustments in response to overtime pay requirements – than in the North.  By contrast, 
49:1198:95472:27:28:71:504:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:Trejo (2003), using as a source of identification variation over the 1970s and 1980s in the 
49:1199:95564:28:28:71:536:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:proportion of employees within an industry who are subject to the overtime pay requirements of 
49:1200:95659:28:27:72:529:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:the FLSA, finds no effect of overtime pay requirements on the frequency of workweeks longer 
49:1201:95751:27:28:72:526:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:than 40 hours in specifications that include industry time trends.  However, as Trejo notes, the 
49:1202:95848:28:27:71:503:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:coefficients on coverage changes are imprecisely estimated, making it difficult to discern 
49:1203:95939:27:28:71:528:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:whether the absence of a statistically significant effect suggests no underlying effect or simply 
49:1204:96037:28:28:71:533:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:the limited power of the empirical approach.  Hamermesh and Trejo (2000) study not the FLSA 
49:1205:96129:28:0:71:526:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:but a California state law expanding the set of employees covered by a strict form of overtime 
50:1206:96227:0:0:72:216:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                
50:1207:96275:0:27:72:542:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:pay and find significant negative effects on the level of overtime employees work.  None of these 
50:1208:96373:27:28:72:541:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:studies, however, offers any evidence that, in response to a decline in long work hours, aggregate 
50:1209:96472:28:27:72:540:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:employment rises in the employment market in question – although it is obvious that a decline in 
50:1210:96569:27:28:72:534:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:workweeks longer than 40 hours is a logical predicate for such an increase.  Using German data 
50:1211:96664:28:28:72:511:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:and examining the effects of industry-specific changes in overtime pay requirements, Hunt 
50:1212:96754:28:27:72:523:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:(1999) finds that, if anything, aggregate employment levels fall rather than rise in response to 
50:1213:96851:27:28:72:271:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:strengthened overtime pay requirements.

50:1216:96918:28:28:108:529:460:144:Times:144:Times:?: This paper has offered economic analysis (or, at times, referred to economic analysis in 
50:1217:97007:28:27:72:538:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:the Handbook of Labor Economics or the Handbook of Public Economics) of the major topics in 
50:1218:97099:27:28:72:509:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:employment law.  Topics addressed above include workplace safety mandates (section II), 
50:1219:97187:28:27:72:518:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:compensation for workplace injuries (section III), workplace privacy mandates (section IV), 
50:1220:97279:27:28:72:518:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:fringe benefits mandates (section V), targeted benefits such as mandated medical and family 
50:1221:97371:28:27:72:517:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:leave (section VI), wrongful discharge laws (section VII), unemployment insurance (section 
50:1222:97462:27:28:72:525:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:VIII), minimum wage rules (section IX), and overtime pay requirements (section X).33  There 
50:1223:97554:28:28:72:538:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:remains much interesting work to be done on many of these topics, including the effects of some 
50:1224:97650:28:27:72:500:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the relatively new laws mentioned above.  Moreover, while the focus of most existing 
50:1225:97738:27:28:72:538:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:employment law is on mandating particular features within the employer-employee relationship, 
50:1226:97832:28:27:72:534:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:recent legal scholarship in employment law has given increased emphasis to prospects for using 
50:1227:97927:27:28:72:535:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:“default” rather than mandatory rules.  Relatively unexplored in existing work is theoretical and

50:1230:98118:8:18:72:492:97:49:Times:121:Times:F:33 A separate area of inquiry concerns the causes (rather than the desirability and the effects) of 
50:1231:98218:18:0:72:398:79:121:Times:121:Times:F:employment law rules.  This question is analyzed by Botero et al. (2004).

51:1233:98343:0:27:72:536:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:employment relationships.  In this and other areas, there are important potential future synergies 
51:1234:98442:27:28:72:505:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:between legal scholarship on employment law and economic analysis of this body of law. 
51:1235:98529:28:27:107:504:653:144:Times:144:Times:?: As noted above, this paper has focused on employment law rather than labor law.  
51:1236:98610:27:28:72:541:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:However, it bears emphasis that the two fields of law do not operate in any way independently of 
51:1237:98707:28:28:72:525:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:one another.  The contours of labor law, in affecting the prevalence and power of unions, may 
51:1238:98801:28:27:72:539:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:greatly affect what sorts of employment law rules are enacted and, perhaps most importantly, the 
51:1239:98898:27:28:72:510:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:degree to which employment law rules are effectively enforced against employers.34  With 
51:1240:98987:28:27:72:536:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:respect to the importance of enforcement, it is difficult to disagree with Pound (1910, pp. 16, 34-
51:1241:99086:27:28:72:497:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:35), who noted long ago that employment law “in action” may look quite different from 
51:1242:99172:28:355:72:233:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:employment law “on the books.”
