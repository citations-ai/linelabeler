2:23:1051:30:24:72:540:594:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Researchers interested in estimating productivity can choose from an array of methodologies, each
2:24:1148:24:24:72:539:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:with its strengths and weaknesses. Many methodologies are not very robust to measurement error
2:25:1242:24:24:72:540:546:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:in  inputs.  This  is  particularly  troublesome,  because  fundamentally  the  objective  of  productivity
2:26:1349:24:24:71:539:522:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:measurement is to identify output differences that cannot be explained by input differences. Two
2:27:1445:24:24:72:540:498:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:other sources of error are misspecifications in the deterministic portion of the production technology
2:28:1547:24:24:72:539:474:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and erroneous assumptions on the evolution of unobserved productivity. Techniques to control for
2:29:1643:24:24:72:539:450:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the endogeneity of productivity in the firm's input choice decision risk exacerbating these problems.
2:30:1744:24:24:72:539:426:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:I compare the robustness of five widely used techniques: (a) index numbers, (b) data envelopment
2:31:1840:24:24:72:539:402:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:analysis,  and  three  parametric  methods:  (c)  instrumental  variables  estimation,  (d)  stochastic
2:32:1943:24:24:71:539:378:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:frontiers,  and  (e)  semiparametric  estimation.  The  sensitivity  of  each  method  to  a  variety  of
2:33:2048:24:32:71:468:354:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:measurement and specification errors is evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations.

3:42:2273:0:37:72:194:707:17:g_d0_f3:17:g_d0_f3:1  Motivation
3:43:2286:37:22:72:540:670:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Accurate measurement is at the heart of productivity comparisons.  Fundamentally, the
3:44:2371:22:21:72:540:648:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:objective is to identify output differences that cannot be explained by input differences.
3:45:2461:21:21:72:540:627:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:To perform this exercise, one needs to observe inputs and outputs accurately and control
3:46:2549:21:22:72:540:606:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:for the input substitution that the production technology allows. Problems can arise from
3:47:2638:22:21:72:540:584:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:misspecifications in the deterministic or stochastic portion of the production technology and
3:48:2731:21:25:72:264:563:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:from measurement errors in the data.
3:49:2767:25:21:108:540:538:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Firms use different input combinations to produce one unit of output because their
3:50:2849:21:22:72:540:517:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:technology differs, which I label productivity differences, or because they face different factor
3:51:2946:22:21:72:539:495:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:price, which leads firms to pick different points on the production frontier.1The extent to
3:52:3037:21:22:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:which one input can be substituted for another is determined by the shape and position of
3:53:3126:22:21:72:540:452:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the production function—or any other representation of technology—and is naturally not
3:54:3212:21:21:72:540:431:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:observable. Methodologies to estimate productivity differ by the mix of statistical techniques
3:55:3306:21:22:72:540:410:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and economic assumptions they employ to control for input substitution. Misspecifications
3:56:3395:22:21:72:540:388:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in the deterministic part of the production function or in the statistical model underlying the
3:57:3490:21:25:72:539:367:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:evolution of unobserved productivity will have repercussions on the productivity estimates.
3:58:3581:25:21:108:540:342:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Mismeasurement can result, among other things, from unobserved quality or price
3:59:3660:21:22:72:540:321:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:differences, aggregation problems, recall errors in surveys, or incompatibilities in reference
3:60:3754:22:21:72:540:299:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:period for output and inputs.  The effect on productivity estimates obviously depend on
3:61:3841:21:22:72:540:278:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the estimation method. For example, Griliches and Hausman (1986) argue that while first-
3:62:3929:22:21:72:540:256:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:differencing is useful to control for unobserved firm-specific effects, identification based on
3:63:4024:21:21:72:540:235:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:thinner slices of the data are more vulnerable to measurement errors. Solutions exist for
3:64:4113:21:22:72:540:214:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:dealing with well-defined forms of measurement error, but they are rarely used in practice.
3:65:4204:22:21:72:540:192:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:One of the goals in this paper is to verify how sensitive different methods for productivity
3:66:4296:21:25:72:368:171:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:measurement are to different forms of measurement error.
3:67:4352:25:27:108:540:146:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:I evaluate the robustness to misspecification and measurement errors for five popular
3:68:4437:27:16:85:539:119:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:1Some authors have argued that some of the output shortfall relative to the best practice frontier is the
3:69:4542:16:12:72:540:103:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:result of inefficiency. I still classify such shortfall as productivity differences, to remain consistent with a
3:70:4654:12:12:72:540:91:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:profit maximizing model of the firm. Lower output might be caused by differences in production technology,
3:71:4760:12:0:72:529:79:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:unmeasured inputs, or quality differences in outputs. See Stigler (1976) for a more elaborate motivation.
4:72:4866:0:22:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:methodologies. The first two methods, index numbers and data envelopment analysis, are
4:73:4952:22:21:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:very flexible in the specification of technology, but do not allow for unobservables, making
4:74:5044:21:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the effect of measurement error completely unpredictable. The three parametric methods
4:75:5130:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:calculate productivity from an estimated production function. In the simplest linear regres-
4:76:5222:22:21:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:sion model, measurement error in the dependent variable has no effect on the consistency of
4:77:5313:21:22:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:least squares estimates, while errors in the independent variables biases coefficient estimates
4:78:5408:22:21:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:downwards. For most production function estimators, the effects are not so straightforward,
4:79:5499:21:21:72:540:557:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:because more complicated estimators are devised to deal with the simultaneity of produc-
4:80:5587:21:22:72:540:536:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tivity and input choice. Moreover, the principal interest is in the residual of the production
4:81:5681:22:21:72:540:514:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:function, which is always affected. I evaluate the robustness of both productivity level and
4:82:5773:21:25:72:276:493:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:growth estimates using simulated data.2
4:83:5812:25:21:108:540:468:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In the next section, I start with some background on productivity measurement and,
4:84:5894:21:22:72:540:447:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:subsequently, I introduce the different methodologies. An attempt is made to present the
4:85:5982:22:21:72:540:425:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:general idea of each methodology in a consistent framework and convey the distinctive fea-
4:86:6072:21:22:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tures as briefly as possible.  Links to the literature for more extensive information and
4:87:6161:22:21:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:discussion are provided. Section 3 describes the data generation process, starting from the
4:88:6252:21:21:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:input choices of a profit maximizing representative firm. For each set of assumptions on the
4:89:6344:21:22:72:540:340:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:evolution of productivity that have been considered in the literature, I solve analytically or
4:90:6438:22:21:72:540:318:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:numerically for the optimal investment policy. In Section 4, the sensitivity of the different
4:91:6531:21:22:72:540:297:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:estimation methodologies to variations of three elements of the data generating process is
4:92:6621:22:21:72:540:275:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:evaluated. First, different assumptions are used to model the unobserved productivity term.
4:93:6712:21:21:72:540:254:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Second, measurement error of varying size is added to output and inputs. Third, the returns
4:94:6803:21:22:72:540:233:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to scale of the production technology is varied. Lessons to take away from these exercises
4:95:6893:22:24:72:213:211:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:are summarized at the end.
4:96:6919:24:16:85:539:187:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:2For a related study that uses manufacturing data from Colombia to compare the different methodologies,
4:97:7022:16:0:72:199:171:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:see Van Biesebroeck (2003b).
5:98:7051:0:37:72:303:707:17:g_d0_f3:17:g_d0_f3:2  Measuring Productivity
5:99:7076:37:22:72:540:670:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In plain English, one firm is more productive than another if it is able to produce the same
5:100:7168:22:21:72:540:648:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:outputs with less inputs or if it produces more outputs from the same amount of inputs.
5:101:7255:21:21:72:540:627:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Similarly, a firm has experienced positive productivity growth if outputs have increased more
5:102:7348:21:22:72:540:606:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:than inputs or inputs have decreased more than outputs. The comparison becomes more
5:103:7431:22:21:72:540:584:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:interesting if one firm (or the same firm in one of the comparison periods) uses more of one
5:104:7523:21:21:72:540:563:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:input, while the other relies more on a second input. In that case, it becomes necessary
5:105:7611:21:22:72:540:542:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to specify a transformation function that links inputs to outputs.  Since a firm’s input
5:106:7699:22:21:72:540:520:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:substitution possibilities are determined by the technology it employs, each productivity
5:107:7788:21:25:72:459:499:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:measure is only defined with respect to that specific production technology.
5:108:7864:25:22:108:540:474:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Measuring productivity necessarily involves decomposing differences in the input-
5:109:7945:22:21:72:540:452:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:output combinations into shifts along a production frontier and shifts of the frontier itself.
5:110:8039:21:21:72:540:431:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In Figure 1, two production plans,P0andP1, are compared in input space and the frontier
5:111:8126:21:22:71:540:410:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is represented by the unit isoquant. Part of the difference, fromP0to 1, is a shift along
5:112:8215:22:21:71:539:388:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the frontier, exploiting the input substitution the technology allows. The remainder of the
5:113:8306:21:21:71:540:367:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:difference, from 1 toP1, is an actual shift of the frontier, which is counted as technical change
5:114:8403:21:22:71:539:346:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:or productivity growth. In this example, an intuitive measure ofP0’s productivity relative
5:115:8493:22:25:71:133:324:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:toP1is0P101.
5:116:8505:25:21:108:540:299:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:If the shape of the unit isoquant in Figure 1 is not known, it can be estimated paramet-
5:117:8593:21:22:72:540:278:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:rically if one is willing to make functional form assumptions. Simultaneity of productivity
5:118:8684:22:21:72:540:256:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and input choice is the main econometric issue.  I discuss three different estimators that

5:120:8804:25:21:108:540:210:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Another approach is to rely on index number theory, which is discussed in Section
5:121:8885:21:22:72:540:189:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:2.2. If the first order conditions for input choices hold, the factor price ratio will equal the
5:122:8981:22:21:72:540:167:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:slope of the input isoquant, which determines input substitution possibilities. Taking the
5:123:9071:21:21:72:540:146:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:average of the ratio for both production plans that are compared, it is possible to control
5:124:9162:21:22:72:540:125:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:for input differences without having to estimate anything. Figure 2 compares the same two
5:125:9251:22:21:72:539:103:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:production plans as before. The reference production plan (P0) uses more labor (less capital)
5:126:9344:21:0:72:540:82:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:which will be accounted for in proportion to the average labor share (capital share) in costs.

6:136:9638:21:21:71:540:371:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the productivity forP1, without allowing any other plan to lie below the isoquant.  The
6:137:9725:21:22:71:539:350:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:relevant section of the isoquant, connectingP2andP3in Figure 3, implicitly defines relative
6:138:9816:22:21:71:540:328:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:weights for labor and capital. Weights are chosen to maximize productivity forP1, i.e. to
6:139:9905:21:22:71:539:307:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:minimize its distance to the isoquant. When evaluating different production plans, different
6:140:9997:22:25:71:300:285:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:weights are used, as discussed in Section 2.1.
6:141:10043:25:21:107:539:260:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Using each method, two production plans are compared, which can refer to two
6:142:10119:21:21:71:539:239:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:different firms or to a single firm at two different points in time.  Productivity measures
6:143:10210:21:22:71:539:218:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:can be output- or input-based. Output-based measures provide an answer to the question:
6:144:10297:22:21:71:539:196:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:“How much extra output does a firm produce, relative to another firm, conditional on its
6:145:10385:21:21:71:539:175:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:(extra) input use?” Input-based measures ask “What is the minimum input requirement
6:146:10468:21:22:71:539:154:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:for one firm to produce the same output as another firm?” Under constant returns to scale
6:147:10557:22:21:71:539:132:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:both measures will coincide. Most applications limit themselves to a single output and only
6:148:10648:21:27:71:345:111:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:calculate output-based measures and I’ll do likewise.3

7:159:11086:21:21:72:540:351:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:represented by a multiplicative term in the production function,Ait, which differs between

8:195:12568:25:21:108:540:197:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Three broad classes of methodologies are introduced in the following sections. They
8:196:12651:21:21:72:540:176:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:are ordered by increasing sensitivity to specification error and decreasing vulnerability to
8:197:12743:21:22:72:540:155:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:measurement error, at least that is the a priori expectation. The Monte Carlo simulations
8:198:12832:22:21:72:540:133:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:will confirm or reject these priors and give an idea of the robustness of each method. Readers
8:199:12926:21:26:72:540:112:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:familiar with the different methodologies might still find the expositions useful, as estimates

9:204:13245:32:22:72:540:628:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The first approach to productivity measurement relies on nonparametric estimation tech-
9:205:13332:22:21:72:540:606:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:niques using linear programming. The basic method dates back to Farrell (1957) and it was
9:206:13421:21:22:72:540:585:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:operationalized by Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (1978).7No particular production function
9:207:13509:22:21:72:540:563:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is assumed. Instead, productivity equals the ratio of a linear combination of outputs over a
9:208:13601:21:21:72:540:542:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:linear combination of inputs. Weights are chosen optimally for the unit under consideration,
9:209:13693:21:22:72:540:521:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:with the restriction that the efficiency of all (other) observations cannot exceed 100% when
9:210:13785:22:21:72:540:499:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the same weights are applied to them. Observations that are not dominated are labeled 100%
9:211:13875:21:22:72:540:478:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:efficient. Domination occurs when another firm, or a linear combination of other firms, uses
9:212:13967:22:21:72:540:456:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:less of all inputs to produce the same outputs or produces more of all outputs using the same
9:213:14060:21:25:72:107:435:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:inputs.
9:214:14067:25:21:108:540:410:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Figure 4 provides some intuition for the DEA methodology. It is drawn for a single
9:215:14149:21:22:72:540:389:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:input and output, but the intuition is similar for higher dimensional problems as the inputs
9:216:14241:22:21:72:539:367:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and outputs are always aggregated linearly.8P1to P5are production plans of different
9:217:14325:21:21:71:539:346:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:firms. The solid line represents the frontier under variable returns to scale. It fits a piece-
9:218:14420:21:22:71:539:325:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:wise linear frontier over the extreme points. Four of the five observations lie on the frontier
9:219:14515:22:21:71:539:303:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and are deemed 100% efficient. If the technology is restricted to constant returns to scale,
9:220:14607:21:22:71:539:282:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the frontier is forced to go through the origin and is extrapolated beyond observed data
9:221:14695:22:21:71:540:260:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:points, resulting in the dashed line as production frontier. OnlyP2is fully efficient in this
9:222:14788:21:21:71:539:239:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:case. Imposing constant returns to scale adds a constraint to the problem, restricting the
9:223:14878:21:25:71:417:218:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:weights and lowering the maximized objective value—the efficiency.
9:224:14944:25:22:107:539:193:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The distance of each unit to the frontier represents its (in)efficiency.  In an input

9:227:15224:16:12:72:540:130:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:include, but are not limited to, the appropriateness of deflated sales as output measure if competition is

9:229:15434:11:9:72:365:107:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:and outputs; variations in capacity utilization; and regulated firms.

9:231:15594:12:15:85:539:86:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:8Because weights to construct the input and output aggregate are chosen optimally for the observation

11:286:17447:21:21:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:firm-years as separate observations in the analysis, it is possible to calculate productivity
11:287:17540:21:22:72:122:453:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:growth as
11:288:17549:22:31:200:540:431:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:logADEAit−logADEAit−1= logθit−logθit−1.(5)

11:291:17729:25:22:108:540:354:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:DEA has the advantage that it deals with many outputs in a consistent way and leaves
11:292:17813:22:21:72:540:332:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the underlying technology unspecified, even allowing it to vary across firms. No functional
11:293:17904:21:21:72:540:311:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:form or behavioral assumptions are made.  While there is no theoretical justification for
11:294:17993:21:22:72:540:290:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the linear aggregation, it is natural in an activities analysis framework. Each firm can be
11:295:18084:22:21:72:540:268:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:considered a separate process that is combined with others to replicate the production plan of
11:296:18178:21:21:72:540:247:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the unit under investigation. On the other hand, the flexibility in weighting has drawbacks.
11:297:18270:21:22:72:540:226:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Each firm with the highest ratio for any output-input combination is 100% efficient, as it can
11:298:18364:22:21:72:540:204:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:put maximum weight on these factors. Under variable returns to scale, each firm with the
11:299:18452:21:27:72:540:183:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:lowest input or highest output level in absolute terms is also fully efficient. The method is
11:300:18545:27:12:85:521:156:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:9Without normalization, multiplying all weights by a multiplier does not change the problem in (3).
11:301:18644:12:16:81:539:144:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:10θ1gives an input-based efficiency measure for firm 1. Interchanging the roles of inputs and output in (3)
11:302:18751:16:12:71:539:128:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:and minimizing the objective function, gives the corresponding output-oriented programming problem. In
11:303:18853:12:12:71:539:116:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:that case, efficiency is given by the inverse of the optimized objective value. The problem is similar to the
11:304:18962:12:12:71:539:104:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:Malmquist index, see equation (7) later, but instead of assuming a translog input distance function, inputs
11:305:19069:12:0:71:172:92:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:are aggregated linearly.
12:306:19095:0:22:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:not stochastic, which makes it sensitive to outliers.11Because each observation is compared
12:307:19186:22:47:72:513:685:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to all others, measurement error for a single firm can affect all productivity estimates.

12:310:19386:22:21:72:540:584:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:motivated aggregation method for inputs and outputs. It remains fairly agnostic on the shape
12:311:19478:21:21:72:540:563:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of the underlying production technology and allows some heterogeneity. Under a number of
12:312:19566:21:22:72:540:542:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:assumptions, it is possible to calculate the last term in (2) from observables, without having

12:335:20091:21:21:72:540:353:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:with an index number without knowledge of the parameters. In particular, if the production
12:336:20181:21:22:72:540:332:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:function is translog, the T ̈ornqvist index number in equation (6) gives an exact expression for
12:337:20277:22:21:72:540:310:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the second term in (2). The comparison is valid for bilateral productivity level comparisons
12:338:20369:21:22:72:540:289:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:between firms as well as for two time periods. With multiple outputs, the single output ratio
12:339:20462:22:21:72:540:267:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is simply replaced by a weighted sum of each log-output difference, using average revenue
12:340:20551:21:25:72:272:246:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:shares as weights, similar as for inputs.
12:341:20592:25:21:108:540:221:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Subsequently, Caves et al. (1982a) extended (6) further, allowing for technical change

13:390:22177:21:25:72:225:334:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:I do include the scale factor.14

13:393:22376:22:27:72:540:266:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:preferred, because T ̈ornqvist indices are not transitive. Caves et al. (1982b) propose one

13:395:22565:16:12:72:540:223:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:ways to represent the technology. The latter measures the amount of input deflation (or inflation) needed

13:413:23033:15:12:72:540:111:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:least squares. The labor share is calculated as percentage of revenue, as in the constant returns to scale case,
13:414:23145:12:12:72:540:99:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:rather than as a percentage of total cost. Few real world applications calculate the price of capital needed

14:429:23672:17:25:71:430:559:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that are transitive, and still allows for technology that is firm-specific.
14:430:23747:25:21:107:539:534:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The main advantages of the index number approach are the straightforward compu-
14:431:23826:21:22:71:539:513:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tations, the flexible specification of technology, and the ability to handle multiple outputs
14:432:23919:22:21:71:539:491:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and many inputs. The only separability assumption is between outputs and inputs, i.e. ho-
14:433:24008:21:21:71:539:470:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:motheticity. To some extent, firms can produce with different technologies, because only the
14:434:24100:21:22:71:539:449:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:coefficients on the second order terms have to be equal for the two units compared. Tech-
14:435:24189:22:21:71:539:427:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:nical change can be non-neutral and returns to scale can vary, although one needs to know
14:436:24278:21:22:71:540:406:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:them to implement equation (8).16The main disadvantages are the deterministic nature
14:437:24362:22:21:72:540:384:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and the necessary assumptions on firm behavior and market structure. It is impossible to
14:438:24450:21:21:72:540:363:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:account for measurement errors or to deal with outliers, except for some ad hoc trimming
14:439:24538:21:22:72:540:342:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of the data. The formulas assume that firms maximize profits, are price takers on input and
14:440:24629:22:21:72:540:320:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:output markets, and that the underlying technology can be characterized by translog output
14:441:24719:21:22:72:539:299:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:or input distance functions.17More sophisticated extensions exist for regulated firms, non-
14:442:24810:22:21:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:competitive output markets, and temporary equilibrium, but they either involve estimating
14:443:24899:21:21:72:540:256:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:some structural parameters or are more data intensive. Even the calculations under variable
14:444:24990:21:22:72:540:235:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:returns to scale require data on the local returns to scale for each firm and on the price of
14:445:25083:22:27:72:267:213:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:capital, which are not easily obtained.
14:446:25122:27:12:81:412:186:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:15Throughout, returns to scale are assumed to be equal for all observations.
14:447:25198:12:15:81:539:174:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:16If some conditions do not hold, the index number is not exact, but still a valid second-order approximation
14:448:25307:15:12:71:539:159:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:to the productivity ratio. The T ̈ornqvist index is just one possibility and different functional forms for the
14:449:25418:12:12:71:539:147:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:underlying technologies require different index numbers. One of its attractions is that it rationalizes Solow’s
14:450:25529:12:8:71:167:135:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:original TFP formula.
14:451:25550:8:0:81:348:127:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:17In the single-output case, only cost minimization is needed.

15:453:25637:33:21:72:540:674:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The parametric methods assume that the input tradeoff and returns to scale are the same
15:454:25724:21:22:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:for all observations. Functional form assumptions often yield more precise estimates at the
15:455:25815:22:21:72:539:631:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:expense of concentrating all heterogeneity across firms in the productivity term.18On the
15:456:25904:21:22:72:540:610:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:plus side, the explicit stochastic framework is likely to make estimates less susceptible to
15:457:25996:22:25:72:171:588:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:measurement error.

15:483:26922:22:21:71:539:211:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of productivity, which is unobservable to the econometrician.  A least squares regression
15:484:27011:21:22:71:539:190:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of output on inputs will give inconsistent estimates of the production function coefficients.

15:487:27298:15:9:71:539:126:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:differ between firms, this approach has not been fruitful, see Mairesse and Griliches (1990) for a discussion.

16:495:27778:0:22:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ward solution is to use instrumental variables that are uncorrelated with productivity. The
16:496:27869:22:21:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:stochastic frontier literature makes explicit distributional assumptions about the unobserved

16:501:28250:32:22:72:540:547:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Using instrumental variables is the most straightforward solution to an endogeneity prob-
16:502:28339:22:21:72:540:525:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:lem. In the context of production functions, researchers have largely been unsuccessful in
16:503:28429:21:21:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:obtaining valid or strong instruments. One exception are demand shifters in geographically
16:504:28519:21:22:72:540:483:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:differentiated industries, see for example Syverson (2001). Often, methods dictate estimat-

16:506:28703:21:22:72:540:440:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:but the results have generally been unsatisfactory, see for example Griliches and Mairesse
16:507:28793:22:21:72:540:418:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:(1998). The coefficient on capital is estimated much lower than in the level equation and
16:508:28882:21:21:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:returns to scale are often estimated implausibly low. This is what one might expect if inputs
16:509:28975:21:25:72:393:376:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and output are persistent over time and instruments are weak.
16:510:29036:25:22:108:540:351:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A general approach to estimate error component models was developed in Blundell
16:511:29115:22:21:72:540:329:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and Bond (1998) and applied to production functions in Blundell and Bond (2000). They
16:512:29200:21:21:72:540:308:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:propose a new set of moment conditions with a more solid theoretical underpinning and
16:513:29285:21:39:72:505:287:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:obtain more plausible results. The production function they estimate takes the form

16:517:29434:27:16:81:539:172:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:21I only derive output-based productivity measures (AO). For homogeneous production functions, there

16:523:29851:10:12:72:540:116:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:corresponds to an input-based productivity of 0.86 or -0.15 in logarithms. The scale economies embodied in

18:560:31802:21:25:72:278:586:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:conditions in (14) have been exploited.22
18:561:31843:25:22:108:540:561:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The GMM-SYS estimator combines both versions of the production function—in first

18:563:32016:21:21:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:To calculate productivity, the estimated coefficients are substituted in (11), dropping the last

18:567:32246:42:22:108:540:394:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Advantages of this method are the flexibility in generating instruments and the pos-
18:568:32330:22:21:72:540:372:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:sibility of testing for overidentification. It allows for an autoregressive component to pro-
18:569:32423:21:22:72:540:351:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ductivity, in addition to a fixed and an idiosyncratic component. The major disadvantage
18:570:32511:22:21:72:540:329:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is the need for a long panel. One needs at least four time periods to estimate the model
18:571:32599:21:21:72:540:308:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:if there is measurement error. The number of overidentifying moment restrictions is equal
18:572:32688:21:22:72:540:287:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to the number of independent variables if cross-equation restrictions are enforced. At least
18:573:32780:22:21:72:540:265:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:five years of data are needed to generate additional overidentifying moment conditions. If
18:574:32870:21:42:72:443:244:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:instruments are weak, the method risks underestimating the coefficients.

18:579:33268:15:9:72:343:107:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:year dummies, is sufficient, but not necessary for (14) to hold.
18:580:33332:9:15:81:539:98:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:23Taking the difference of the errors from the production function in levels and first differences gives an

19:584:33703:22:21:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:from a known distribution with negative support. The method is credited to Aigner et al.
19:585:33791:21:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:(1977) and Meeusen and van den Broeck (1977) who used respectively, the negative of an
19:586:33877:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:exponential and half-normal distribution for unobserved productivity.  Stevenson (1980)
19:587:33964:22:21:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:introduced a truncated normal distribution that is more flexible on the location of the mode
19:588:34056:21:25:72:420:600:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of the distribution. Estimation is usually with maximum likelihood.
19:589:34123:25:22:108:539:575:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In the production function (10), the termωitis weakly negative and interpreted as

19:591:34296:21:21:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:practice production frontier. An alternatively interpretation is that firmiproduces according
19:592:34389:21:22:72:539:511:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to a production function which is shifted down byωitwith respect to best practice. The
19:593:34475:22:25:72:403:489:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:shift is zero for the most efficient firm, producing at the frontier.
19:594:34544:25:21:108:540:464:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The original stochastic frontier models were developed to assess productivity in a
19:595:34626:21:21:72:539:443:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:cross section of firms.24The model was subsequently generalized for panel data in a number
19:596:34716:21:22:71:539:422:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of different ways. Battese and Coelli (1992) provide the most straightforward, but also the
19:597:34807:22:39:71:402:400:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:most restrictive generalization, modeling the inefficiency term as
19:598:34873:39:24:233:540:361:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f4:ωit=−e−η(t−T)ωi,(16)
19:599:34893:24:39:257:378:337:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f8:withωi∼N+(γ,σ2).
19:600:34909:39:22:71:540:298:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Relative productivity between firms,ωi, is time-invariant and comes from a truncated normal
19:601:35000:22:21:71:539:276:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:distribution. To obtain the (in)efficiency at timet, it is multiplied by a factor that increases
19:602:35096:21:21:71:539:255:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:(ifηis positive) or decreases (ifηis negative) deterministically over time. The ranking of
19:603:35186:21:25:72:485:234:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:firms is unchanged over time and the inefficiency evolves identically for all firms.
19:604:35270:25:22:108:540:209:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:If one observes firms only once, making strong assumptions is the only possibility
19:605:35352:22:21:72:540:187:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to separate the productivity component from the random error. Panel data contains more
19:606:35438:21:22:72:540:166:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:information on each firm and allows identification under weaker assumptions. Schmidt and
19:607:35526:22:21:72:540:144:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Sickles (1984) propose to reinterpret the standard fixed-effects panel data estimator as a
19:608:35616:21:21:72:539:123:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:stochastic frontier function. Normalized firm dummies give a direct estimate ofωi. The
19:609:35702:21:27:71:539:102:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:problematic correlation between inputs and unobserved productivity has been ruled out by
19:610:35790:27:0:81:423:75:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:24The same holds for DEA, which is also called deterministic frontier analysis.
20:611:35871:0:22:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:assumption. Cornwell et al. (1990) generalize the method by estimating a time-varying effect
20:612:35963:22:21:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that is still firm-specific. They adopt a quadratic specification and estimate three coefficients
20:613:36060:21:39:72:117:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:per firm:
20:614:36069:39:39:236:540:625:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f4:ωit=αi0+αi1t+αi2t2.(17)
20:615:36092:39:22:72:540:586:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Firm-level productivity evolves deterministically over time, but the growth rate is not nec-
20:616:36184:22:25:72:311:564:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:essarily constant and it differs between firms.25
20:617:36233:25:21:108:540:539:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:I estimate both panel data models.  For the first stochastic frontier method it is
20:618:36315:21:21:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:customary to calculate technical (in)efficiency asTEit=E(eωit|ωit+-it), which is complicated
20:619:36407:21:22:72:540:497:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:by the nonlinear transformation. To compare the results with the other methods, I only
20:620:36493:22:21:72:539:475:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:need the expected logarithm of productivity. Because the best estimate ofE(ωit|ˆωit+ ˆ-it) is
20:621:36586:21:21:72:540:454:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:logASF1it= ˆωit+ ˆ-it, ifωitis independent of-it, I stick with the calculations in equation (11),
20:622:36683:21:22:72:540:433:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:dropping the last term. For the second stochastic frontier estimator, productivity level and
20:623:36775:22:39:72:214:411:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:growth can be calculated as

20:629:36994:25:22:108:540:284:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:An advantage of stochastic frontiers is their relative simplicity to implement. The
20:630:37077:22:21:72:540:262:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:deterministic part of the production function can be generalized easily to allow more so-
20:631:37166:21:21:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:phisticated specifications, e.g. to incorporate factor-bias in technological change. The two
20:632:37258:21:22:72:540:220:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:variations I implement trade off flexibility in the characterization of productivity with esti-
20:633:37353:22:27:72:540:198:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:mation precision. Note that the second estimator uses many degrees of freedom and it is the
20:634:37444:27:25:81:397:171:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:25An intermediate model, introduced by Huang and Liu (1994), specifies
20:635:37514:25:22:238:540:146:10:g_d0_f22:10:g_d0_f7:ωit=−(Zitδ+Z∗itδ∗+νit),(18)
20:636:37541:22:12:72:540:124:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:withνitdrawn from a normal distribution, such thatωitis negative.  The variables inZare exogenous
20:637:37638:12:12:72:539:112:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:determinants of efficiency and those inZ∗are interactions between input variables and variables inZ. The
20:638:37742:12:12:72:540:100:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:model is called non-neutral because inefficiency varies by input use. Because the truncation depends on
20:639:37845:12:0:72:528:88:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:variables that vary by firm, the inefficiency terms are still independently, but not identically distributed.
21:640:37956:0:22:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:only estimator where consistency relies on asymptotics in the time dimension. One might
21:641:38043:22:21:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:be uncomfortable with the identification coming solely from functional form assumptions,
21:642:38131:21:42:72:356:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:which are especially restrictive in the first specification.
21:643:38191:42:32:72:310:622:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2.3.3  Semi-parametric estimation (OP)
21:644:38229:32:22:72:540:590:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The last method was introduced by Olley and Pakes (1996) to estimate productivity effects of
21:645:38321:22:21:72:540:568:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:restructuring in the U.S. telecommunications equipment industry. They not only addressed
21:646:38409:21:22:72:540:547:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the simultaneity of inputs and unobserved productivity, but argue also that correlation of exit
21:647:38504:22:21:72:540:525:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:from the sample with inputs leads to an additional sample selection bias. More specifically,
21:648:38596:21:21:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:if low productivity firms tend to exit and the exit-threshold is decreasing in capital, selection
21:649:38693:21:25:72:448:483:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:will bias the least squares estimate of the capital coefficient downwards.26
21:650:38769:25:22:108:540:458:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:They propose a three step estimator, which relies on the theoretical model in Ericson
21:651:38854:22:21:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and Pakes (1995), to remedy both problems. Investment is a function of the state variables,
21:652:38945:21:22:72:540:415:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:capital and productivity, and under weak conditions it is shown to be a monotonically
21:653:39030:22:21:72:540:393:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:increasing function of productivity. The relationship can be inverted to express productivity
21:654:39123:21:21:72:540:372:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:as an unknown function of capital and investment.  Substituting that expression in the
21:655:39209:21:39:72:442:351:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:production function (10) gives the estimating equation for the first step:
21:656:39283:39:39:223:540:312:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f4:qit=α0+αllit+φt(iit,kit) +-1it.(21)
21:657:39318:39:22:72:539:273:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The functionφtis approximated nonparametrically by a fourth order polynomial or a kernel
21:658:39406:22:21:72:540:251:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:density. The inversion depends on the market structure and can be estimated as time-variant.
21:659:39498:21:25:72:511:230:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The first step produces estimates of ˆαlandˆφit, which are needed in subsequent steps.
21:660:39584:25:22:107:539:205:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The second step controls for the exit decision. The intuition is that exit is conditional
21:661:39673:22:21:71:539:183:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:on the realization of productivity and the exit-threshold. Both are different, unknown func-
21:662:39765:21:21:71:539:162:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tions of investment and capital. They are approximated nonparametrically and included on
21:663:39853:21:27:71:539:141:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the right-hand side of a probit regression for exit. Estimation of the second step produces
21:664:39944:27:16:81:539:114:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:26One mechanism that creates such dependency is a profit function that is increasing in capital. Firms
21:665:40046:16:12:72:540:98:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:with more capital expect a higher future profitability for a given level of productivity and will support larger
21:666:40158:12:12:72:540:86:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:drops in productivity before exiting the industry. An alternative mechanism that generates the same result
21:667:40264:12:0:72:506:74:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:are imperfect capital markets, i.e. if a bankrupt firm incurs a loss proportional to the capital stock.
22:668:40369:0:25:72:292:707:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:an estimate of the survival probabilityˆPit.
22:669:40413:25:22:108:540:682:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Finally, in the third step, only the capital coefficient is estimated. Details on identifi-
22:670:40504:22:21:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:cation are in Olley and Pakes (1996), but the intuition is straightforward. From the produc-
22:671:40596:21:21:72:540:639:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tion function (10), one can write the conditional expectation ofqit−αllitasα0+αkkitplus
22:672:40683:21:22:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the conditional expectation of productivity. Assuming that productivity evolves according
22:673:40772:22:21:72:540:596:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to a stochastic Markov process, the conditional expectation is a function of two variables:
22:674:40863:21:22:72:540:575:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:productivity in the previous period and the exit threshold. This unknown relationship is
22:675:40951:22:21:72:540:553:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:again approximated nonparametrically. The lagged value of productivity is obtained from
22:676:41038:21:21:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the first step results asˆφit−1−αkkit−1. An expression for the exit-threshold is obtained from
22:677:41132:21:22:71:539:511:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the second step, by inverting the monotonically increasing relationship between the survival
22:678:41224:22:39:71:537:489:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:probability and the exit threshold. The estimation equation for the third step is given by27
22:679:41316:39:42:179:540:450:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f4:qit−ˆαllit=αkkit+ψ(ˆφit−1−αkkit−1,ˆPit−1) +-2it.(22)
22:680:41368:42:22:108:540:408:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Once the coefficients in the production function are estimated, it is possible to calcu-
22:681:41456:22:21:72:540:386:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:late productivity as in Olley and Pakes (1996) from (11), dropping the last term. It is also
22:682:41548:21:39:72:471:365:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:possible to calculate a direct estimate of ˆωit, purged from random noise ˆ-it, as

22:687:41680:39:22:72:540:287:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:This measure can only be calculated for firms with positive investment, i.e. the firms in-
22:688:41770:22:21:72:540:265:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:cluded in the estimation procedure, while the calculations in equation (11) are also feasible
22:689:41863:21:22:72:540:244:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:for firms with zero investment. The interpretations also differ between the two measures.
22:690:41952:22:21:72:540:222:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Productivity estimates calculated from (23) only capture the part of productivity known to
22:691:42042:21:21:72:540:201:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the firm at the time it chooses investment, not the subsequent innovation in productivity
22:692:42131:21:27:72:540:180:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that still contributes to output. This is fine for the parameter estimation, as only the known
22:693:42225:27:16:81:539:153:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:27The methodology is more general than this exposition makes appear. Fundamental is the idea to use
22:694:42324:16:12:72:540:137:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:another decision by the firm to provide separate information on the unobserved productivity term.  An
22:695:42425:12:12:72:540:125:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:alternative implementation was proposed by Levinsohn and Petrin (2003), who invert the material input
22:696:42526:12:12:72:540:113:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:demand instead of the investment equation. Van Biesebroeck (2003a) inverts an entirely different first order
22:697:42634:12:12:72:540:101:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:condition; the decision how many workers to employ on each shift. Firms can produce the same output by
22:698:42736:12:12:72:540:89:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:operating many shifts at a slower pace or running fewer shifts at higher speed, which requires more workers
22:699:42843:12:0:72:498:77:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:per shift. This tradeoff is monotonic in the unobserved productivity of the installed capital stock.
23:700:42945:0:22:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:part can lead to inconsistency. Productivity estimates calculated from (11), on the other
23:701:43034:22:21:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:hand, capture the entire productivity term, known to the firm or not, and include random
23:702:43122:21:25:72:171:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:measurement error.
23:703:43140:25:21:108:540:639:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The main advantage of this approach is the flexible characterization of productivity.
23:704:43225:21:22:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The only restrictive assumption is that productivity evolves according to a Markov process.
23:705:43316:22:21:72:540:596:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A potential weakness is the accuracy of the nonparametric approximations. The investment
23:706:43404:21:22:72:540:575:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and other functions to be inverted are likely to be very complicated mappings from states to
23:707:43496:22:21:72:540:553:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:actions, since they have to hold for all firms regardless of their size or competitive position.
23:708:43592:21:21:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The accuracy of the method depends on the extent to which interactions of investment,
23:709:43677:21:54:72:442:511:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:capital, and the survival probabilities capture variations in productivity.

23:714:43973:22:21:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of the assumptions I use to generate the data. Because the assumptions are hardly ever

25:831:47625:25:21:108:540:284:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The final catch is that researchers do not observe output and inputs accurately, but

25:835:47788:28:16:81:539:172:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:29The capital series is initialized by drawing the initial capital stock from a Chi-squared distribution with
25:836:47897:16:12:72:540:156:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:3 degrees of freedom.  This distributions is chosen to mimic the empirical distribution of capital in the
25:837:48002:12:12:72:540:144:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:Colombian data set, which is introduced later. The normality assumption on wages is convenient to obtain

25:842:48438:15:0:72:459:85:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:productivity are normalized to have the same mean and variance (0,1) as thei.i.d.term.
26:843:48526:0:22:72:539:707:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The only variables a researcher observes areˆQit,ˆLit,ˆKit, (̂WL)it, andˆIit.  The output
26:844:48615:22:21:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:error,ηy, can be interpreted as the usual random error appended to the production function.
26:845:48706:21:25:72:475:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Measurement error on inputs is not controlled for in any of the methodologies.
26:846:48784:25:21:108:540:639:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Four elements of the data generating process will be varied to perform different ro-
26:847:48868:21:22:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:bustness checks; assumptions on (a) the evolution of productivity; (b) the size and incidence
26:848:48961:22:21:72:540:596:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of measurement error; (c) heterogeneity in adjustment cost or production technology; (d)
26:849:49049:21:25:72:532:575:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:returns to scale. In some cases, this will lead to a different investment function than (28).
26:850:49142:25:22:108:540:550:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Varying the assumptions on the evolution of productivity, for example, will influence
26:851:49227:22:21:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:a firm’s investment policy.  The process described earlier already embodies a number of
26:852:49314:21:21:72:540:507:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:interesting economic cases. The autoregressive component captures that productivity spills
26:853:49404:21:22:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:over across periods, but only imperfectly. Decreasing the variance of-makes the process
26:854:49491:22:21:72:539:464:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:more predictable. Ifρrises to unity, there is a plant-fixed productivity effect with random
26:855:49582:21:21:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:noise. The investment function becomes a straightforward increasing function in the constant
26:856:49674:21:22:72:540:422:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:component of the firm’s productivity level. Ifρdecreases to zero, investment will vary less
26:857:49765:22:21:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:with current productivity, because it does not predict future productivity anymore. A fixed-
26:858:49857:21:22:72:540:379:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:effect and autoregressive component can also be included jointly, as is done in the benchmark
26:859:49950:22:25:72:104:357:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:case.31
26:860:49957:25:21:108:540:332:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Different assumptions on the investment cost function, in Section 4.4, will also lead to
26:861:50045:21:21:72:540:311:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f8:different investment equations. Three possibilities are included. If all firms share the sameb
26:862:50139:21:22:72:540:290:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:parameter, the investment equation is given byf1(Ait) in equation (28). If part of the cost
26:863:50230:22:21:72:539:268:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of new investment varies between firms and over time,git(I) =ritI+b2I2, the investment
26:864:50316:21:21:72:539:247:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:equation will take the following form:Iit=−rit+β(1−δ)E(rit+1) +f1(Ait). If the shock is
26:865:50403:21:22:72:540:226:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:transitory, similar to the wage rate, the second term drops out. An autoregressive component
26:866:50495:22:21:72:540:204:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to the cost of capital will result in a smaller drop in investment for a given increase in the
26:867:50589:21:22:72:539:183:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:cost of capital asIit=−(1−βρ(1−δ))rit+f1(Ait). A permanently different adjustment cost
26:868:50675:22:25:72:533:161:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:for different plants,gi(I) =bi2I2, gives a plant specific investment function,Iit=bbif1(Ait).
26:869:50768:25:21:108:540:136:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Finally, allowing nonconstant returns to scale, in Section 4.5, makes it impossible to
26:870:50854:21:27:72:540:115:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:solve the investment function analytically as a function of exogenous variables. Because the

27:900:51847:33:21:72:540:376:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:To verify that the samples simulated with the previous data generating process resemble an
27:901:51937:21:22:72:540:355:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:actual sample of firms, I compare some summary statistics with the equivalent statistics for
27:902:52029:22:21:72:540:333:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:a sample of Colombian manufacturing firms. The data was taken from the Colombian census
27:903:52116:21:22:72:540:312:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of manufacturing; details are in Roberts (1996).32I limit the sample to 256 textile firms over
27:904:52210:22:21:72:540:290:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:a ten year period (1981-1991). For the simulated data, I draw 50 unbalanced samples of
27:905:52296:21:21:72:540:269:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:200 firms over 10 years, similar to the samples used in the robustness exercises in the next
27:906:52388:21:22:72:540:248:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:section, and report the average statistics. With the exit rule as described earlier, this yields
27:907:52484:22:25:72:236:226:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:samples with 1433 observations.
27:908:52515:25:21:108:540:201:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Table 1 confirms that many features of a real sample of firms are replicated rather
27:909:52598:21:21:72:540:180:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:well in the benchmark case. This assumes that productivity evolves according to an AR(1)
27:910:52686:21:27:72:540:159:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:process, investment costs are uniform, all firms share the same constant returns to scale
27:911:52775:27:16:81:539:132:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:32I wish to thank Jim Tybout and Mark Roberts who graciously provided me with the data. I use data
27:912:52873:16:12:72:540:116:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:from a developing country, because I do not have access to a representative sample of firms from a developed
27:913:52981:12:12:72:540:104:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:country. Obtaining access to U.S. Census data, for example, is an arduous endeavor, while publicly available
27:914:53089:12:12:72:540:92:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:data in Compustat only capture large firms. For productivity estimates using the Colombian data and the
27:915:53192:12:0:72:363:80:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:same methodologies as in this paper, see Van Biesebroeck (2003b).
28:916:53259:0:22:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:production technology, and a standard deviation of 0.5 for the measurement error is added
28:917:53348:22:21:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to all variables. The most important difference of the simulated versus the Colombian data
28:918:53438:21:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is the lower variation of investment and capital—but not the investment share in capital—
28:919:53527:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and the wage share. In the benchmark case, all heterogeneity between firms is introduced
28:920:53615:22:21:72:539:621:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:through the wage rate, a fixed productivity term subject toi.i.d.shocks that decay rapidly,
28:921:53706:21:22:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and random measurement error. Adding heterogeneity in other parts of the model, in Section
28:922:53796:22:21:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:4.4, provides a better fit with the real data. Heterogeneity in investment costs leads directly
28:923:53891:21:21:72:540:557:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to much higher standard deviations on investment and capital. Random coefficients in the
28:924:53979:21:22:72:540:536:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:production technology makes the wage share statistics more similar to the Colombian ones,
28:925:54068:22:25:72:200:514:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:almost by construction.33
28:926:54093:25:21:108:540:489:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Estimation of a Cobb-Douglas production function by OLS also produces similar
28:927:54170:21:21:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:results for both samples. With the simulated data, the labor coefficient is overestimated
28:928:54259:21:22:72:540:447:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:relative to its true value of 0.6, with a downward bias in the capital coefficient. This ten-
28:929:54352:22:21:72:540:425:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:dency will show up in the majority of the exercises later on, even with more sophisticated
28:930:54442:21:22:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:estimation methods. Returns to scale are erroneously estimated to be increasing. Enforcing
28:931:54532:22:21:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:constant returns to scale (results not reported) brings the labor coefficient down, closer to
28:932:54625:21:21:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:its true value. The exit of relatively less productive firms from the sample leads to a positive
28:933:54721:21:22:72:540:340:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:coefficient on the time trend, even thoughαtis zero in the data generating process. In the
28:934:54811:22:21:72:540:318:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Colombian data, many of the same tendencies seem to be at work. The labor coefficient is
28:935:54899:21:22:72:540:297:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:surprisingly high, especially relative to the modest 0.62 average wage share, while the capital
28:936:54994:22:21:72:540:275:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:coefficient is implausibly low. Some of the 6.1% productivity growth in the Colombian case
28:937:55084:21:33:72:271:254:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is likely to be attributable to selection.
28:938:55126:33:33:283:328:221:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:[Table 1]
28:939:55135:33:22:108:540:188:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Table 2 illustrates that the partial correlation coefficients between all observable vari-
28:940:55225:22:21:72:540:166:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ables for the simulated data match the corresponding correlations for the Colombian sample
28:941:55315:21:22:72:540:145:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:reasonably well. Output has the highest correlations with the other variables, while invest-
28:942:55407:22:25:72:540:123:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ment has the lowest, both in the simulated (top-right) and actual (bottom-left) samples.
28:943:55495:25:15:81:539:98:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:33A translog production function will also produce variation in the wage share, but the investment function
28:944:55602:15:12:72:540:83:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:cannot be solved analytically in that case. Moreover, the added generality of flexible functional forms only
28:945:55710:12:0:72:337:71:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:become really valuable if more than two inputs are included.
29:946:55772:0:22:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Correlations between output and inputs are large and positive and those with labor and
29:947:55858:22:25:72:233:685:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:wages exceed that with capital.
29:948:55889:25:21:108:540:660:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:For the results limited to a single year, to focus on the across firm correlation, the
29:949:55975:21:21:72:540:639:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:similarity is at least as high. The correlation over time, in the bottom panel of Table 2, is
29:950:56068:21:22:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:less well captured. Correlations between year-on-year growth rates of the different variables
29:951:56161:22:21:72:540:596:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:are generally higher for the simulated data.  The growth rates of output and investment
29:952:56248:21:22:72:540:575:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:are especially more alike those of other variables. A likely reason is that the AR(1) process

30:983:58353:25:21:108:540:478:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Different statistics can be used to evaluate the methodologies; the correlation between
30:984:58440:21:22:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the estimated and true underlying productivity levels and growth rates is one. For the level
30:985:58532:22:21:72:540:435:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:comparisons, I calculate the Spearman rank-correlation statistics, to focus on the order of
30:986:58623:21:22:72:540:414:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:firms, rather than the absolute size of the estimates, but results would be very similar for
30:987:58715:22:21:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:partial correlation statistics. Correlations are calculated by year and then averaged over the
30:988:58809:21:21:72:540:371:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ten years in the sample. An alternative criterion to evaluate the results is the mean squared

30:999:59095:21:22:72:540:249:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the relative position of firms in the productivity rankings are accurate, the MSE will tend to
30:1000:59189:22:25:72:536:227:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:be large. Outliers as well have more impact on the MSE than on the correlation statistics.
30:1001:59279:25:21:108:540:202:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:While the two previous measures allow a thorough comparison of the different meth-
30:1002:59361:21:21:72:540:181:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ods, the correlations and MSE’s are not necessarily the type of information an applied
30:1003:59447:21:22:72:540:160:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:researcher would like to base his choice of method on. In another paper, Van Biesebroeck
30:1004:59535:22:21:72:540:138:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:(2003b), I revisit three standing productivity debates using the Colombian data. With the
30:1005:59624:21:22:72:540:117:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:simulated data, I can revisit one of those debates; whether aggregate productivity growth is
30:1006:59716:22:21:72:540:95:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:mainly driven by plant-level productivity growth, by compositional changes between plants,
30:1007:59806:21:0:72:540:74:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:or by (entry and) exit from the sample. The answer to this debate relies on both productivity
31:1008:59901:0:22:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:level and growth estimates. The decomposition results are in Table 4 and will be discussed
31:1009:59991:22:21:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:after the correlation and MSE results, for which the averages over fifty simulated samples
31:1010:60081:21:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:are in the first column of Table 3. The average input coefficient estimates, as well as the
31:1011:60172:21:25:72:382:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:sum of the MSE for each input coefficient, are also included.
31:1012:60233:25:22:108:540:618:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In the benchmark case, the Olley-Pakes method estimates productivity levels most
31:1013:60313:22:21:72:540:596:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:accurately, especially if the random measurement error is taken out (OP2). The correla-
31:1014:60400:21:22:72:540:575:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tion between estimated and true productivity is highest and the MSE is lowest. The least
31:1015:60488:22:21:72:540:553:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:restrictive stochastic frontier estimator (SF2), with three sets of dummies per firm, comes
31:1016:60579:21:21:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in second. Using the correlation criterion, the two estimators are very close, 0.76 for OP2
31:1017:60670:21:22:72:540:511:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:versus 0.70 for SF2. The MSE criterion accentuates the difference. It is almost twice as large
31:1018:60764:22:21:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:for SF2. Both the index numbers and data envelopment results are still very respectable.
31:1019:60852:21:21:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The performance of the DEA method is notably better for the correlation criterion than
31:1020:60938:21:22:72:540:447:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:using MSE, which is not surprising as the efficiency measures had to be converted to log
31:1021:61026:22:21:72:540:425:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:productivity differences. Only the GMM and the first stochastic frontier (SF1) estimators
31:1022:61115:21:22:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:barely leave the naive least squares estimator behind, producing a correlation with true
31:1023:61203:22:21:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:productivity just exceeding 0.30. The difference between the best and worse estimators are
31:1024:61293:21:37:72:195:361:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:definitely not negligible.
31:1025:61319:37:37:283:328:324:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:[Table 3]
31:1026:61328:37:21:108:540:287:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The different estimators are less accurate and produce relatively similar results for
31:1027:61413:21:21:72:540:266:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:productivity growth.  The Olley-Pakes estimator is still preferred, but the index number
31:1028:61501:21:22:72:540:245:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:calculations are almost equally accurate.  Most other methods are not far behind, with
31:1029:61587:22:21:72:540:223:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the exception of the second stochastic frontier method. SF2 yields results that are hardly
31:1030:61677:21:22:72:540:202:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:correlated with the true productivity growth rates. On the other hand, the MSE is second
31:1031:61765:22:21:72:540:180:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:lowest, indicating that the size of the growth rates was captured relatively well. It turns out
31:1032:61860:21:21:72:540:159:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that methods that estimate productivity levels very accurately are not necessarily equally
31:1033:61950:21:25:72:495:138:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:adapt at estimating productivity growth, and vice versa, e.g. the index numbers.34
31:1034:62032:25:27:108:540:113:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The bottom two panels in Table 3 contain the coefficient estimates that drive the

31:1036:62218:15:0:72:298:71:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:productivity growth is positive because of selection.
32:1037:62273:0:22:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:productivity results. The true labor coefficient is 0.6 throughout and returns to scale are
32:1038:62364:22:21:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:constant. The least squares results have the predicted bias: the labor coefficient is overes-
32:1039:62457:21:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:timated and the reverse is true for the capital coefficient. Returns to scale are estimated
32:1040:62548:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to be increasing, in most cases significantly so. The GMM and SF1 results hardly improve
32:1041:62636:22:21:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:on the OLS results. The upward bias in the labor coefficient is only slightly reduced; the
32:1042:62726:21:22:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:capital coefficient is estimated even lower, which goes in the wrong direction. The OP and
32:1043:62816:22:21:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:SF2 estimators produce labor coefficient estimates that are notably lower, but the capital
32:1044:62906:21:21:72:540:557:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:coefficient is now hardly different from zero anymore. The labor and capital shares that
32:1045:62994:21:22:72:540:536:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:are used in the index numbers—obtained without estimation, but scaled down in the TFP
32:1046:63079:22:21:72:540:514:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:calculations according to (8) as returns to scale are estimated to be increasing—turn out to
32:1047:63171:21:21:72:540:493:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:be closest to the truth. The average input weights used in the DEA are also closer to the
32:1048:63260:21:25:72:364:472:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:true input shares than any of the parametric estimates.35

32:1052:63577:22:21:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:results are similar using both weights and I will only discuss the former. Aggregate produc-
32:1053:63669:21:21:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tivity grew by 7.7% over ten years. The different methodologies produce a wide range of
32:1054:63756:21:22:72:540:340:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:estimates; the DEA, OP2 and OP1 methods come closest and the GMM and SF2 methods
32:1055:63836:22:25:72:278:318:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:are least accurate, at opposite extremes.
32:1056:63877:25:21:108:540:293:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:This aggregate growth is decomposed into the contribution of plants that survive over
32:1057:63962:21:21:72:540:272:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ten years and those that exit from the sample. Less productive plants leaving the sample
32:1058:64050:21:22:72:540:251:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:adds 6.2% to aggregate productivity growth. This is almost the entire productivity advance,
32:1059:64141:22:21:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:not surprisingly, as there is no built-in productivity growth in the data generating process.
32:1060:64234:21:22:72:540:208:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:All methods get the sign right and the methods that predicted aggregate growth best, also
32:1061:64323:22:21:72:540:186:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:isolate the effect of exit most accurately: DEA, OP1 and OP2. Surviving plants contribute
32:1062:64412:21:21:72:540:165:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:only modestly to productivity growth. The SF2 results overestimate their contribution, while
32:1063:64504:21:27:72:420:144:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the GMM estimator inexplicably finds a very strong negative effect.

33:1068:64903:0:22:108:540:707:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The contribution of surviving plants is further decomposed. Using initial input share
33:1069:64988:22:21:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:as weight on productivity growth for surviving plants reveals that, on average, productivity
33:1070:65080:21:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:growth at the plant-level was strongly negative, adding up to -21.7%. The range of estimates
33:1071:65172:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is even more disparate and the DEA method, where plant-level growth rates are constructed
33:1072:65261:22:21:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ad-hoc, is surprisingly the most accurate. Summing up changes in input shares, weighted
33:1073:65348:21:22:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:by initial productivity, indicates that less productive plants used an even larger share of
33:1074:65439:22:21:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:inputs by the end of the sample, lowering aggregate productivity by 21.1%. Similar to the
33:1075:65528:21:21:72:540:557:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:within component, the OLS and SF1 methods get it completely wrong. The GMM methods
33:1076:65610:21:22:72:540:536:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is now most accurate, followed by DEA. The largest contribution to aggregate productivity
33:1077:65699:22:21:72:540:514:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is made by co-movements in input shares and productivity. Plants improving productivity,
33:1078:65787:21:21:72:540:493:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:while at the same time increasing their input use, raise aggregate productivity by 44.4%.
33:1079:65876:21:22:72:540:472:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:For this to happen output growth has to outweigh input growth. OLS, GMM, and SF1 miss
33:1080:65961:22:21:72:540:450:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:this large positive effect completely and assign it a negative contribution. While a negative
33:1081:66054:21:22:72:540:429:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:correlation between input growth and productivity growth is intuitive, it is strongly at odds
33:1082:66147:22:21:72:540:407:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:with the data generating process. The DEA, SF2, and OP2 methods approach the actual
33:1083:66230:21:25:72:203:386:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:contribution most closely.
33:1084:66256:25:21:108:540:361:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The GMM, SF1, and OLS methods predict an incorrect sign for many components
33:1085:66331:21:22:72:540:340:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and estimate many magnitudes quite inaccurately.  The OP1 and SF2 methods estimate
33:1086:66413:22:21:72:540:318:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:all signs correctly, but are not very successful in estimating the magnitudes of the different
33:1087:66507:21:22:72:540:297:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:contributions.  The decomposition by the DEA and OP2 methods are clearly most reli-
33:1088:66590:22:21:72:540:275:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:able. Using output weights instead, these two methods tend to overestimate the different
33:1089:66678:21:38:72:397:254:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:contributions, but to a lesser extent than the other approaches.
33:1090:66742:38:47:283:328:216:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:[Table 4]
33:1091:66751:47:32:72:387:169:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:4.2  Different specifications for productivity
33:1092:66797:32:22:72:540:137:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The results in subsequent columns of Table 3 are for variations in the specification of the
33:1093:66888:22:21:72:540:115:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:unobserved productivity term in the data generating process.  The benchmark model in
33:1094:66972:21:22:72:540:94:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:column 1 contained three components that contributed to the persistency of productivity
33:1095:67059:22:0:72:540:72:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:over time, each of these is now studied in isolation. In the second column, only the AR(1) part
34:1096:67156:0:22:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is maintained, while in the third column all productivity differences are constant over time.
34:1097:67249:22:21:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In the fourth specification, the productivity shock is completely transitory, disappearing after
34:1098:67345:21:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:a single period. In each specification all variables are observed with the same measurement
34:1099:67436:21:25:72:149:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:error as before.
34:1100:67452:25:22:108:540:618:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Looking across the different columns of Table 3, the results seem to be all over the
34:1101:67536:22:21:72:540:596:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:map. At the very least, this leads to one solid conclusion: no single method is the most
34:1102:67624:21:22:72:540:575:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:appropriate for every form of underlying productivity. No method has one of the three highest
34:1103:67717:22:21:72:540:553:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:correlations with true productivity in each of the four specification, not for productivity levels
34:1104:67815:21:21:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:nor for growth rates. At the same time, for each of the specifications considered, at least
34:1105:67906:21:25:72:394:511:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:one method manages to achieve a correlation of 0.73 or higher.
34:1106:67968:25:22:108:540:486:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Still, the performance of different methods is not completely random. Overall, the
34:1107:68050:22:21:72:540:464:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:OP2 method has a high correlation for almost all specifications. It outperforms OP1 in most
34:1108:68141:21:21:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:cases, especially for productivity differences that are constant over time. The big exception
34:1109:68234:21:22:72:540:422:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is the last column, where productivity is completely transitory. Here, OP1 is superior and
34:1110:68324:22:21:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the difference is very large, as OP2 measures register hardly any positive correlation with
34:1111:68415:21:22:72:540:379:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:true productivity. Both methods rank at the top of the pack in most specifications, but the
34:1112:68506:22:21:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:inability of OP2 to pick up transitory shocks does not make either method clearly preferable
34:1113:68598:21:25:72:147:336:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:over the other.
34:1114:68613:25:21:108:540:311:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The choice between the two stochastic frontier methods is more clear-cut. SF2, which
34:1115:68697:21:22:72:540:290:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:takes out the random measurement error, outperforms SF1 in productivity level estimations,
34:1116:68787:22:21:72:540:268:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:except for completely transitory productivity differences. The differences between the two in
34:1117:68880:21:21:72:540:247:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the transitory case is much smaller than for the two Olley-Pakes variants, while the advantage
34:1118:68974:21:22:72:540:226:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of SF2 is larger in the first three columns. SF2 is clearly preferable to estimate levels. For
34:1119:69068:22:21:72:540:204:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:productivity growth, on the other hand, the conclusion is reversed. Here, SF1 dominates SF2,
34:1120:69160:21:22:72:540:183:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:although neither ranks among the most attractive approaches. The surprising conclusion is
34:1121:69249:22:21:72:540:161:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that SF2 is one of the best ways to estimate productivity levels, especially when there is
34:1122:69339:21:21:72:540:140:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:a fixed-effect, but it has the lowest correlation with productivity growth of all methods
34:1123:69428:21:25:72:129:119:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:considered.
34:1124:69439:25:22:108:540:94:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The reverse is true for the index numbers.  While lousy at estimating productiv-
34:1125:69519:22:0:72:540:72:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ity levels, except when all productivity differences are transitory, they excel at estimating
35:1126:69614:0:22:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:productivity growth. Both findings are as expected. When there is no risk of confounding
35:1127:69702:22:21:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:random measurement error with structural productivity differences, they perform well. Their
35:1128:69793:21:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:widespread use in estimating productivity growth also seems justified.37DEA is equally apt
35:1129:69883:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:at estimating productivity differences if they are completely transitory.  Surprisingly, the
35:1130:69975:22:25:72:431:621:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:method seems relatively better at estimating growth rates than levels.
35:1131:70045:25:21:108:540:596:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Finally, the OLS results are among the weakest of the bunch. There is some payoff
35:1132:70126:21:22:72:540:575:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to more sophisticated approaches to estimate productivity. However, the payoff is marginal
35:1133:70216:22:25:72:281:553:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:or even negative for the GMM approach.
35:1134:70254:25:21:108:540:528:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Looking across specifications, the nonparametric estimators, IN and DEA, have an
35:1135:70334:21:21:72:540:507:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:especially hard time coping with a permanent productivity component, where the stochastic
35:1136:70423:21:22:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:frontiers excel. The semiparametric estimators, OP1 and OP2, are best able to deal with
35:1137:70510:22:21:72:540:464:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:autoregressive components to productivity. If all productivity is transitory, methods that
35:1138:70600:21:21:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:take out random measurement error, OP2 and SF2, perform awfully, while the nonparametric
35:1139:70688:21:22:72:540:422:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:methods perform great. It is, of course, impossible to know how productivity evolves for
35:1140:70776:22:21:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:actual data, which makes the enormous differences between methods worrying. One could
35:1141:70861:21:22:72:540:379:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:prefer the index numbers to estimate productivity levels if differences are transitory, running
35:1142:70956:22:21:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the risk of very inaccurate estimates if true productivity is relatively constant over time.
35:1143:71048:21:21:72:540:336:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Similarly, a prior expectation of stable productivity differences might lead one to use OP2
35:1144:71139:21:25:72:488:315:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:or SF2, with the risk of missing the mark widely if real differences are transitory.
35:1145:71223:25:22:108:540:290:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Glancing over the different coefficient estimates in the bottom panels, we find that the
35:1146:71311:22:21:72:540:268:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:upward bias in the labor coefficient depends negatively on the persistence of productivity over
35:1147:71406:21:21:72:540:247:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:time. If transitory shocks are important, the problem is especially pronounced. Even though
35:1148:71497:21:22:72:540:226:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the correlation between productivity estimates is reasonably high, the input coefficients are
35:1149:71590:22:21:72:540:204:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:estimated surprisingly off-mark.  The OLS estimator yields an average estimate for scale
35:1150:71678:21:22:72:540:183:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:economies ranging from 0.34 to 1.16 across specifications and most other estimators are not
35:1151:71769:22:21:72:540:161:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:much better. No standard errors are reported on these coefficient estimates, but they are
35:1152:71858:21:27:72:540:140:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:generally estimated very precisely. This is worrying as counterfactual simulations based on
35:1153:71949:27:16:81:539:113:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:37It is worth noting that two of the preferred estimators are generally not implemented as I did here.
35:1154:72051:16:12:72:540:97:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:Studies using the semiparametric estimator have followed the original and used OP1. Studies calculating
35:1155:72154:12:0:72:421:85:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:productivity as an index number generally force returns to scale to be constant.
36:1156:72236:0:25:72:523:707:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the production function depend directly on the point estimates of the input coefficients.
36:1157:72325:25:22:108:540:682:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In sum, I believe it is fair to conclude that the OP2 estimator performs best if pro-
36:1158:72410:22:21:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ductivity is relatively persistent, with OP1 and SF2 also producing reliable estimates. In
36:1159:72500:21:21:72:540:639:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the face of transitory productivity shocks, it is best abandon the parametric framework,
36:1160:72588:21:22:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:especially methods that attempt to take out measurement error, and stick with the index
36:1161:72675:22:47:72:119:596:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:numbers.
36:1162:72683:47:32:72:410:549:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:4.3  Varying the severity of measurement error
36:1163:72729:32:22:72:540:517:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Next, I investigate the sensitivity to measurement error, assuming throughout that produc-
36:1164:72819:22:21:72:540:495:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tivity evolves according to the benchmark specification, i.e. with an AR(1) component and
36:1165:72908:21:22:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:small fixed-effect. In all columns of Table 5, normally distributed measurement error with
36:1166:72998:22:21:72:540:452:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:equal variance is added to all observable variables. In successive columns, the standard de-
36:1167:73090:21:21:72:540:431:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:viation,σxin (29), is gradually increased from 0 to 1.25. For some methods, IN, DEA, and
36:1168:73178:21:22:72:540:410:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:SF2, this leads to a gradual decrease in the correlation between estimated and actual pro-
36:1169:73268:22:21:72:540:388:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ductivity levels, but this trend is by no means universal. For the OP1 and OP2 estimators,
36:1170:73358:21:21:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the correlations decrease gradually with a sudden but isolated and inexplicable improvement
36:1171:73449:21:22:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:for one standard error. For the OLS and SF1 methods, the pattern of the correlations for
36:1172:73537:22:21:72:540:324:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:increasing measurement error is U-shaped. More measurement error leads initially to lower
36:1173:73626:21:22:72:540:303:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:correlations, but this bottoms out in the benchmark case and correlations increase for larger
36:1174:73719:22:21:72:540:281:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:measurement errors. The SF1 method even performs best with very high measurement error.
36:1175:73806:21:21:72:540:260:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Finally, for the GMM estimator, the correlations start out very low, increase initially, but
36:1176:73898:21:25:72:533:239:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:decrease eventually when measurement error grows very large. Everything seems possible.
36:1177:73985:25:22:108:540:214:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:It is comforting to find that the parametric methods perform best when measurement
36:1178:74067:22:21:72:540:192:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:error gets very large, especially OP2 and SF2, which explicitly take out additive measurement
36:1179:74160:21:21:72:540:171:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:error. Note the remarkable resilience of SF2, having only 0.1 lower correlation even for an
36:1180:74251:21:22:72:540:150:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:enormous amount of measurement error. On the other hand, it is surprising to find that
36:1181:74337:22:21:72:540:128:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:many parametric methods give poor results when there is no or very low measurement error.
36:1182:74426:21:22:72:540:107:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The explication for this can be found in the bottom panels. The much stronger correlation
36:1183:74515:22:0:72:540:85:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:between labor input and productivity in the absence of any measurement error leads to
37:1184:74602:0:22:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:very high labor coefficient estimates.  The correction for endogenous input choices tends
37:1185:74691:22:21:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to overcorrect.  For example, the GMM and OP methods estimate the capital coefficient
37:1186:74776:21:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:close to or even above its true value of 0.4 without a corresponding decrease in the labor
37:1187:74866:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:coefficient estimate relative to OLS. More measurement error lowers the coefficient estimates,
37:1188:74960:22:25:72:449:621:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:but unfortunately this affects the capital as much as the labor coefficient.
37:1189:75036:25:21:108:540:596:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The haphazard evolution of correlations with productivity level stands in marked
37:1190:75116:21:22:72:540:575:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:contrast with the uniformity of experience for productivity growth calculations. Here, cor-
37:1191:75207:22:21:72:540:553:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:relations decrease monotonically, with as lone exception an isolated bump in correlation for
37:1192:75299:21:21:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the GMM estimator for a standard error of 1.00. In every other case, more measurement
37:1193:75384:21:22:72:540:511:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:error translates into lower correlations and higher MSE. The rate of worsening is higher for
37:1194:75476:22:21:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the productivity growth calculations than for levels, which makes sense as the measurement
37:1195:75566:21:25:72:455:468:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:error is i.i.d. and two time periods are involved in the growth calculations.
37:1196:75643:25:21:108:540:443:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Even though the pattern is homogeneous, the methods are affected to a different
37:1197:75722:21:22:72:540:422:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:extent. The OP methods are affected most, dropping from the top two spots to number
37:1198:75805:22:21:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:three and seven.  While they achieve an astounding correlation of 0.95 and 0.89 without
37:1199:75892:21:22:72:540:379:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:measurement error, these fall by at least three quarters when the errors get very large. It is
37:1200:75986:22:21:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:surprising to find that the OP2 method, which is supposed to take out measurement error, is
37:1201:76077:21:21:72:540:336:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:affected even more than OP1. At the other side of the spectrum, the SF2 method, which also
37:1202:76167:21:22:72:540:315:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:takes out measurement error, is hardly affected, not even for large errors, although it started
37:1203:76262:22:21:72:540:293:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:from a very low correlation. The robustness of this method is even more apparent using the
37:1204:76352:21:21:72:540:272:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:MSE criterion. It is noteworthy, as well, that the deterministic index number calculations
37:1205:76442:21:22:72:540:251:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:produce very robust productivity growth estimates. For small or moderate errors, only the
37:1206:76531:22:21:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Olley-Pakes measures are preferred, while the index numbers have the highest correlations
37:1207:76620:21:22:72:540:208:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:with true productivity if measurement error gets very high. The SF1 and GMM methods
37:1208:76703:22:21:72:540:186:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:are also rather resilient in the face of measurement error. Their correlations drop for initial
37:1209:76798:21:36:72:394:165:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:increases in measurement error, but bottom out relatively fast.
37:1210:76861:36:37:283:328:129:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:[Table 5]
37:1211:76870:37:21:108:540:92:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In the previous exercise, the size of measurement error was the same for all variables.
37:1212:76957:21:0:72:540:71:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Given the considerable differences in standard error for the different variables in Table 1, this
38:1213:77056:0:22:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is admittedly unrealistic. In Table 6, the benchmark comparison is repeated in column 1;
38:1214:77144:22:21:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:results for a standard deviation equal to one third of the standard deviation of the variables
38:1215:77238:21:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in the Colombian data set are in column 2; measurement error with a standard deviation
38:1216:77324:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of one third of the average standard deviation of the simulated variables without standard
38:1217:77414:22:25:72:295:621:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:error is added to each variable in column 3.
38:1218:77458:25:21:108:540:596:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Most findings are robust to the assumption of uniform or varying size of measurement
38:1219:77542:21:22:72:540:575:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:error. In the productivity level calculations, the index method is most affected and the SF2
38:1220:77634:22:21:72:540:553:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:method least. The ranking of the different methods hardly depends on the assumption on
38:1221:77720:21:21:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the relative size of measurement error added to different variables, even though it depended
38:1222:77812:21:22:72:540:511:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:crucially on the absolute size of measurement error in Table 4. For productivity growth, the
38:1223:77904:22:21:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:results for the OP1 and SF2 methods hardly change, while the index numbers are again most
38:1224:77993:21:21:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:affected. The index numbers are especially hard-hit when the error is proportional to the
38:1225:78082:21:22:72:540:447:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:variation in the underlying variable without measurement error, not surprising given that
38:1226:78171:22:25:72:325:425:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the wage bill is one of the most volatile variables.
38:1227:78223:25:21:108:540:400:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:With measurement error proportional to the standard deviation of the underlying
38:1228:78302:21:22:72:540:379:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:variables, arguably the most natural assumption, the average correlation both for produc-
38:1229:78391:22:21:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tivity levels and growth rates is reduced relative to the benchmark case with uniform errors.
38:1230:78484:21:21:72:540:336:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The SF2 measures have the highest correlation with unobserved productivity levels and OP1
38:1231:78573:21:22:72:540:315:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:edges past OP2 for productivity growth estimates. Using the MSE criterion, the method of
38:1232:78661:22:21:72:540:293:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:choice would unambiguously be the OP2 method. The index numbers lose much of their ap-
38:1233:78747:21:35:72:539:272:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:peal. The disparity in correlations comparing across methods remains virtually unchanged.
38:1234:78836:35:34:283:328:237:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:[Table 6]
38:1235:78845:34:22:108:540:203:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Finally, Table 7 shows the impact of measurement error when only a single variable
38:1236:78927:22:21:72:540:181:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is measured imprecisely. All variables but one are measured with tiny measurement error
38:1237:79014:21:22:72:539:160:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:(σx= 0.1), while each variable in turn is observed with a lot of noise, adding measurement
38:1238:79104:22:25:72:274:138:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:error with a standard deviation of 0.75.
38:1239:79144:25:21:108:540:113:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Adding noise to output, in column 2, cuts the level correlations approximately in
38:1240:79225:21:21:72:540:92:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:half relative to the low measurement error case, in column 1. This masks large differences.
38:1241:79316:21:0:72:540:71:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The OP2 estimator is not affected in the least; it even increases its correlation with true
39:1242:79409:0:22:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:productivity. All other parametric estimators turn out to be particularly vulnerable. Only
39:1243:79499:22:21:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the deterministic approaches, IN and DEA, post correlations that are at least half the cor-
39:1244:79590:21:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:relations in the low measurement error case.  Results for productivity growth are almost
39:1245:79678:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:identical. The only parametric method that holds its ground is OP2, while the deterministic
39:1246:79769:22:21:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:approaches become relatively more attractive. The correction for measurement error in the
39:1247:79858:21:22:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:semiparametric methodology works remarkably well. The coefficient estimates of the OP
39:1248:79943:22:21:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:estimator are by no means better than for the other methods, which is also reflected in the
39:1249:80034:21:25:72:206:557:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:poor performance of OP1.
39:1250:80058:25:21:108:540:532:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:When the capital stock is the most mismeasured variable, results are very different.
39:1251:80142:21:22:72:540:511:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Most methods are much less affected, not surprisingly given that the capital coefficient
39:1252:80230:22:21:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is relatively small and estimated even smaller. More surprisingly, the Olley-Pakes results
39:1253:80320:21:21:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:improve substantially and the GMM method improves enormously.  Both estimators rely
39:1254:80403:21:22:72:540:447:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:on lags for the identification of the capital parameter. The capital coefficient is estimated
39:1255:80496:22:21:72:540:425:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:near zero for all methods, but this tends to be less damaging for productivity estimates
39:1256:80584:21:22:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:than the overestimation of returns to scale, which is ubiquitous with low measurement error.
39:1257:80676:22:21:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Productivity growth estimates only suffer noticeably from imprecisely observed capital if one
39:1258:80769:21:21:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:uses the OLS or SF1 methodology. In a sense, these results are reassuring, as capital is often
39:1259:80863:21:25:72:343:340:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the variable most suspect to be measured with error.
39:1260:80915:25:22:108:540:315:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:All parametric methods estimate productivity levels and growth rates more accurately
39:1261:80999:22:21:72:540:293:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:if labor is measured with error. It tends to reduce the positive bias in the labor coefficient
39:1262:81093:21:21:72:540:272:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:estimate. Only the index numbers are extremely sensitive to imprecisely measured labor
39:1263:81179:21:22:72:540:251:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:input. Measurement error in the wage bill only affects the index number calculations, but
39:1264:81268:22:21:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:here it tends to raise the correlations slightly. It lowers the wage share in output, but given
39:1265:81363:21:22:72:540:208:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that the estimated returns to scale are unaffected (estimated by OLS), it increases the capital
39:1266:81458:22:21:72:540:186:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:share. The net effect is to lower the MSE of the coefficient estimates, which in turn leads to
39:1267:81552:21:25:72:426:165:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:lower MSE and higher correlations for productivity level and growth.
39:1268:81620:25:21:108:540:140:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Obviously, measurement error in investment only affects the Olley-Pakes results. The
39:1269:81704:21:22:72:540:119:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:impact is relatively large, lowering the level and growth correlations by a third for OP1 and
39:1270:81797:22:21:72:540:97:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:by more than half for OP2. Given that investment is more likely to be measured with error
39:1271:81886:21:0:72:464:76:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:than output, labor, or wages, this finding should not be discarded too easily.

40:1273:81975:47:33:72:338:660:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:4.4  Allowing for plant heterogeneity
40:1274:82012:33:21:72:540:627:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Thus far, the data generating process was identical for all firms, assuming the same produc-

40:1276:82195:22:21:72:540:584:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the random wages and productivity shocks. Adding random measurement error, we were
40:1277:82277:21:21:72:540:563:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:able to match most of the volatility and correlation between observed variables with the
40:1278:82365:21:22:72:540:542:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:corresponding statistics of a real-world sample of firms. Heterogeneity across plants provides
40:1279:82459:22:21:72:540:520:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:an alternative to measurement error to make the simulated samples resemble actual data.
40:1280:82546:21:25:72:249:499:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:Several possibilities are explored.38
40:1281:82583:25:22:108:540:474:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The first column in Table 8 repeats the benchmark results as comparison. In subse-
40:1282:82665:22:21:72:540:452:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:quent columns, more structural heterogeneity is introduced and the measurement errors are
40:1283:82754:21:21:72:540:431:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:omitted. The statistics in the second column are generated from a sample of plants that differ
40:1284:82848:21:22:72:540:410:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in the adjustment cost of investment, thebcoefficient ing(I); heterogeneity that is persis-
40:1285:82939:22:21:72:540:388:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tent over time. The third column introduces transitory firm heterogeneity in the investment
40:1286:83030:21:21:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:function instead. The cost of new capital is assumed to be i.i.d. distributed across firms
40:1287:83120:21:22:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and over time, just like wages. The last three columns introduce heterogeneous production
40:1288:83209:22:21:72:540:324:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:functions, always persistent over time. In column 4, the labor coefficient varies with opposite
40:1289:83304:21:22:72:540:303:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:variation in the capital coefficient, keeping returns to scale constant. In column 5, on the
40:1290:83396:22:21:72:540:281:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:other hand, returns to scale vary freely, but the relative importance of labor and capital is
40:1291:83489:21:21:72:540:260:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:as before, 60% and 40%. Finally, in column 6, both input coefficients vary independently
40:1292:83577:21:22:72:540:239:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:across firms, leading to variable scale economies as well. In the latter two cases, I have to
40:1293:83670:22:25:72:367:217:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:resort to numerical solutions for the investment equation.
40:1294:83728:25:21:108:540:192:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Most methods, even the Olley-Pakes estimators, deal well with heterogeneous invest-
40:1295:83811:21:21:72:540:171:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ment costs. The correlations are almost uniformly higher than in the benchmark case for
40:1296:83898:21:22:72:540:150:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:homogeneous firms, for productivity levels as well as for growth rates.  Often, they even
40:1297:83987:22:27:72:540:128:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:exceed the correlations in the no measurement error case, column 1 in Table 5. Persistent
40:1298:84076:27:15:81:539:101:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:38E.g. adding a transitory shock to the price of capital in the investment cost function brings the standard
40:1299:84184:15:0:72:498:86:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:deviations of capital and investment much closer to the values for the Colombian data in Table 1.
41:1300:84283:0:22:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:heterogeneity is handled better than transitory. For productivity growth and transitory dif-
41:1301:84375:22:21:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ferences, the Olley-Pakes methods are affected most, even though they remain among the
41:1302:84461:21:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:most accurate ones. The coefficient estimates indicate that the higher estimate for the labor
41:1303:84554:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:coefficient is the main culprit.  For an investment function with random variation across
41:1304:84643:22:21:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:firms that the method cannot pick up, the endogeneity adjustment does not work nearly as
41:1305:84731:21:25:72:95:600:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:well.
41:1306:84736:25:22:108:540:575:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Heterogeneity in the labor coefficient improves the results for some and worsens them
41:1307:84821:22:21:72:540:553:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:for other methods, but most importantly, it reduced the differences.39No method achieves
41:1308:84909:21:21:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:a Spearman rank correlation coefficient over 0.68, while the worst method still achieves a
41:1309:84999:21:22:72:540:511:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:correlation of 0.32. Excluding the stochastic frontier methods, which end up at the bottom
41:1310:85089:22:21:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of the pack, all methods become virtually indistinguishable to estimate productivity levels
41:1311:85180:21:21:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and only the index numbers have a less than 0.7 correlation for productivity growth. For
41:1312:85268:21:22:72:540:447:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:productivity growth, all correlations coefficients increase considerably, relative to the bench-
41:1313:85364:22:21:72:540:425:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:mark case where measurement error generated the variation. Surprisingly, the index number
41:1314:85453:21:22:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is one of the most affected estimators, even though homogeneity in the technology is not even
41:1315:85546:22:21:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:assumed. Some of the deterioration is driven by the overestimate of average scale economies
41:1316:85637:21:21:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:by OLS. Enforcing constant returns to scale would certainly improve the estimates as 64%
41:1317:85725:21:25:72:350:340:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of the weight is on labor, in line with previous results.
41:1318:85782:25:22:108:540:315:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:All methods, save for GMM, perform worse if returns to scale vary freely across plants.
41:1319:85869:22:21:72:540:293:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The average correlation for productivity levels drops from 0.51 to 0.37. The GMM estimator
41:1320:85959:21:21:72:540:272:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:manages to estimate the capital coefficient accurately, with a lower labor coefficient than in
41:1321:86053:21:22:72:540:251:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:most specifications. Its improved correlation is even more apparent for productivity growth.
41:1322:86145:22:21:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The results are similar whether the relative importance of both inputs are left free or not.
41:1323:86237:21:22:72:540:208:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The nonparametric approaches, IN and DEA, are affected most in each of the last three
41:1324:86322:22:21:72:540:186:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:columns. This is unexpected as both estimators do not assume plants to be homogeneous
41:1325:86407:21:21:72:540:165:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and we expected them to shine in this exercise. It severely lowers their attractiveness as
41:1326:86497:21:22:72:540:144:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:dealing with unobserved heterogeneity in the primitives should be their advantage. On the
41:1327:86586:22:21:72:540:122:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:other hand, these nonparametric methods were affected less by measurement error than most
41:1328:86675:21:27:72:347:101:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:parametric approaches, which is also counterintuitive.
41:1329:86729:27:0:81:487:74:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:39Theactualinput coefficients in the bottom panel of Table 7 are the averages across plants.

42:1331:86832:36:22:108:540:671:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The results in Table 8 indicate that all methods have less problems with structural
42:1332:86915:22:21:72:540:649:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:sources of heterogeneity than with random measurement error. If we believe that most of the
42:1333:87006:21:22:72:540:628:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:variation in the data are random errors, there is little hope of estimating productivity well.
42:1334:87100:22:21:72:540:606:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Deterministic methods were not even found to be disadvantaged in dealing with measurement
42:1335:87189:21:21:72:540:585:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:error. On the other hand, if the variation is driven by firms facing different factor prices,
42:1336:87282:21:22:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:investment functions, or production technologies, the prospects are better. It hardly matters
42:1337:87375:22:21:72:540:542:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:whether the methods explicitly allow for the heterogeneity or not. Most parametric methods
42:1338:87465:21:21:72:540:521:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:are not particularly affected by random variation in the production function parameters and
42:1339:87556:21:47:72:489:500:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the semiparametric method deals adequately with different investment equations.

42:1341:87664:33:21:72:540:420:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The last robustness check on the estimation methodologies is to vary the scale economies
42:1342:87752:21:22:72:540:399:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of the data generating process, keeping them the same for all plants, and to estimate pro-

42:1344:87932:21:21:71:539:356:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:scale are estimated freely, while the actual scale economies for the underlying data gener-
42:1345:88023:21:22:71:539:335:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ating process are, respectively, decreasing, constant, and increasing. In the even columns,
42:1346:88114:22:21:71:539:313:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:constant returns to scale is enforced on the estimator, while the same three data generating
42:1347:88206:21:21:71:539:292:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:processes are considered. For the Olley-Pakes methodology, constant returns are enforced
42:1348:88294:21:22:71:539:271:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:by only estimating the first stage. For the other parametric methodologies, the production
42:1349:88384:22:21:71:539:249:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:function is estimated by regressing the logarithm of output per worker on the logarithm of
42:1350:88474:21:22:71:539:228:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the capital-labor ratio. In each case, the capital coefficient is calculated as one minus the
42:1351:88567:22:25:71:209:206:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:estimated labor coefficient.
42:1352:88595:25:21:107:539:181:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The most important finding in Table 9 is that, with the exception of SF2, the cor-
42:1353:88677:21:26:71:539:160:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:relations for the productivity level are higher when constant returns to scale are enforced;
42:1354:88769:26:16:81:539:134:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:40Ideally, I would like to investigate the impact of the functional form of the production function more
42:1355:88873:16:11:72:540:118:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:thoroughly, as was done with U.S. data in Berndt and Khaled (1979). Previous Monte Carlo studies, for
42:1356:88974:11:12:72:540:107:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:example Gagn ́e and Ouellette (1998) and sources cited there, use exogenously generated inputs.  In the
42:1357:89077:12:12:72:540:95:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:current framework, input choices consistent with the firm’s optimization problem could not even be solved
42:1358:89182:12:12:72:540:83:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:explicitly for the simplest of technologies (Cobb-Douglas) if scale economies are present. Incorporating more
42:1359:89291:12:0:72:291:71:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:flexible functional forms is left for future research.
43:1360:89347:0:22:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:irrespective of the data generating technology. Restricting returns to scale to unity is gen-
43:1361:89440:22:21:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:erally a good idea, independent of the actual scale economies. For some methods, e.g. the
43:1362:89529:21:25:72:407:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Olley-Pakes and GMM estimators, the differences are quite large.
43:1363:89593:25:21:108:540:639:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The estimated returns to scale are fairly independent of the data generating process
43:1364:89677:21:22:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:for all parametric methods. The labor coefficient is estimated only slightly higher if the data
43:1365:89772:22:21:72:540:596:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is generated with larger scale economies, while the capital coefficient estimate even goes
43:1366:89862:21:22:72:540:575:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:down for some methods. While returns to scale are invariably overestimated if they are truly
43:1367:89954:22:21:72:540:553:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:decreasing, the estimates are much closer to the truth for increasing scale economies. The
43:1368:90044:21:25:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:average correlations for productivity levels are higher for higher underlying scale economies.
43:1369:90138:25:21:108:540:507:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:For productivity growth, the SF2 results are still more accurate if constant returns
43:1370:90222:21:22:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:are not enforced (even when they are really constant), but the same is now also true for
43:1371:90310:22:21:72:540:464:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:OLS, GMM, and SF1. Even when returns to scale are constant it is best not to enforce
43:1372:90394:21:21:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:this. Each of these methods estimate the capital coefficients extremely small, often even
43:1373:90483:21:22:72:539:422:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:negative.41However, the IN and OP2 methods still show a marked increase in correlation if
43:1374:90572:22:21:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:returns to scale are fixed. As these are the two methods that have the highest correlations
43:1375:90663:21:22:72:540:379:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and are probably most attractive to estimate productivity growth, allowing variable returns
43:1376:90754:22:25:72:240:357:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to scale does not seem necessary.
43:1377:90787:25:21:108:540:332:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Not a single method finds it optimal to allow for variable returns if the underlying
43:1378:90871:21:21:72:540:311:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:data is generated by a nonconstant returns to scale technology, and vice versa; fixing constant
43:1379:90966:21:22:72:540:290:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:returns to scale only when it is correct for the simulated data. The correlations, both for
43:1380:91057:22:21:72:540:268:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:productivity levels and growth, are relatively independent of the returns to scale in the data
43:1381:91151:21:38:72:538:247:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:generating process. They are more dependent on the scale assumptions used in estimation.

44:1396:92117:21:21:101:540:444:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:them to avoid overcorrecting for the biases in the production coefficient estimates. The
44:1397:92205:21:22:101:540:423:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:deterministic methods, DEA and IN, do not seem at a disadvantage in dealing with
