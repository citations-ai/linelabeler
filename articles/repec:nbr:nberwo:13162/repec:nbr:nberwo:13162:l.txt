2:26:1200:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:?:The extent of and changes in inter-generational mobility of wealth are central to understanding dynamics
2:27:1304:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:?:of wealth inequality but hard to measure. Using estate tax returns data, we observe that the share of
2:28:1405:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:?:women among the very wealthy (top 0.01%) in the United States peaked in the late 1960s, reaching
2:29:1501:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:?:almost 50%. Three decades on, women's share had declined to one third, a return to pre-war levels.
2:30:1599:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:?:We argue that this pattern mirrors the relative importance of inherited vs. self-made wealth in the economy
2:31:1706:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:?:and thus the gender-composition of the wealthiest may serve as a proxy for inter-generational wealth
2:32:1806:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:?:mobility. This proxy for "dynastic wealth'' suggests that wealth mobility in the past century decreased
2:33:1909:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:?:until the 1970s and rose thereafter, a pattern consistent with technological change driving long term
2:34:2010:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:?:trends in income inequality and mobility. Greater wealth mobility in recent decades is also consistent
2:35:2112:14:28:72:506:462:12:Times:12:Times:?:with the simultaneous rise in top income shares and relatively stable wealth concentration.

3:49:2434:0:31:100:213:729:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:1  Introduction
3:50:2449:31:20:100:546:698:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The share of women among the very wealthy peaked in the late 1960s. According to estate
3:51:2536:20:20:100:546:678:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tax returns, in 1925 one quarter of the wealthiest 0.01 percent was women. This fraction rose
3:52:2629:20:21:100:546:658:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rapidly through World War II (WWII) and then more slowly to peak in 1969, when women
3:53:2713:21:20:100:546:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:neared parity with men. Since then, the decline has been marked. By 2000, women’s share had
3:54:2804:20:20:100:546:617:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:fallen to one-third, its pre-war level. While the rise was evident among all wealth groups in the
3:55:2901:20:21:100:546:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:top 1 percent of the wealth distribution, the decline was confined to the very top. Figure 1a
3:56:2994:21:20:100:546:576:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:graphs the share of women for four different groups in the top 1 percent among decedents by
3:57:3085:20:20:100:546:556:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:year. Figure 1b does the same for the “living” population with the help of estate-multipliers
3:58:3178:20:21:100:546:536:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(a method that treats death as a random sampling device and uses mortality rates by age and
3:59:3269:21:20:100:546:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:gender to infer the distribution of wealth among the living, as described in the Data Appendix).
3:60:3365:20:20:117:546:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:This decline in the share of women in the top wealth groups took place against a backdrop
3:61:3454:20:21:100:546:475:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of unprecedented economic emancipation. Moreover, women’s progress in the labor market has
3:62:3544:21:20:100:546:454:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:not been confined to the lower rungs. Social Security data analyzed by Kopczuk et al. (2007)
3:63:3636:20:20:100:546:434:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:reveal that since the 1970s there has been a steady increase of women among top earners: in
3:64:3727:20:21:100:546:414:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the highest category they analyze (top 0.1 percent), women’s share increased by a factor of
3:65:3818:21:20:100:546:393:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:six. We argue that rather than reflecting women’s labor market status, the presence of women
3:66:3910:20:20:100:546:373:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:among the very wealthy may mirror the relative importance of inherited vs. self-made wealth.
3:67:4002:20:21:100:546:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Such a pattern could follow if men make wealth, but both men and women inherit it.1If so,
3:68:4091:21:20:100:546:332:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:changes to the gender wealth distribution may serve as a gauge of inter-generational wealth
3:69:4182:20:20:100:414:312:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mobility at the top, an entity on which there is little information.
3:70:4250:20:21:117:546:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Our gender proxy for wealth mobility among the wealthy suggests that inter-generational
3:71:4337:21:20:100:546:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:wealth mobility decreased in the period 1925-1969 and increased thereafter. Higher wealth
3:72:4426:20:20:100:546:251:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mobility in recent decades coincides with a rise in income concentration (Piketty and Saez,
3:73:4517:20:21:100:546:231:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:2003).  It is also noteworthy in light of the recent finding that top shares of wealth have
3:74:4608:21:20:100:546:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:increased very slowly or even remained constant (Kennickell, 2003; Scholz, 2003; Kopczuk
3:75:4696:20:20:100:546:190:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and Saez, 2004a), which has raised the question why income and wealth concentrations do
3:76:4783:20:21:100:546:170:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:not move in lock-step.  The contrast between income and wealth concentration patterns is
3:77:4871:21:20:100:546:149:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:illustrated on figures 2a and 2b. Our findings suggest a potential reconciliation. While wealth
3:78:4966:20:20:100:546:129:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:concentration has remained stable, the composition of the wealthy may have changed. Less
3:79:5054:20:17:100:546:109:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:dynastic and more self-made wealth at the top is consistent with Piketty and Saez’s (2003)
3:80:5144:17:20:112:546:92:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:1We provide some supportive evidence that this assumption applies to the wealthy in the United States
3:81:5245:20:0:100:256:72:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:during the 20thcentury in Section 3.3.
4:82:5284:0:20:100:546:729:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:finding that recent increases in income inequality were driven by labor rather than capital
4:83:5375:20:20:100:546:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:income inequality, assuming that the self made derive a higher share of income from labor
4:84:5464:20:21:100:546:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:than those who inherited wealth. Finally, a U-shaped pattern for wealth mobility is consistent
4:85:5558:21:20:100:546:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with a primary role for technological change in driving secular trends in inequality, further
4:86:5651:20:20:100:207:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:discussed in Section 5.
4:87:5674:20:21:117:546:628:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Recently, Charles and Hurst (2003) studied intergenerational wealth mobility using a sam-
4:88:5763:21:20:100:546:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ple representative of the full population (using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID))
4:89:5854:20:20:100:546:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and briefly surveyed the small literature on this topic. However, the PSID sample is too small
4:90:5948:20:21:100:546:567:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to study the top of the wealth distribution, where most wealth is held, and contains wealth
4:91:6039:21:20:100:546:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:information for only a short period of time. The Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) lacks
4:92:6127:20:20:100:546:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the panel dimension and is similarly limited time wise but allows for the studying of the top
4:93:6220:20:21:100:546:506:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:0.5% of the household wealth distribution. Beyond that, the study of wealth mobility has been
4:94:6313:21:20:100:546:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:limited to genealogical studies of named decedents (see Davies and Shorrocks, 2000, who also
4:95:6405:20:20:100:294:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:discuss the limitations of this approach).
4:96:6447:20:21:117:546:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Estate tax data offer several advantages. Unlike the PSID or the SCF, wealth is attributed
4:97:6537:21:20:100:546:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to an individual rather than a household, and the data allow for the study of long term trends.
4:98:6632:20:20:100:546:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Estate tax data cover the very top of the distribution, allowing us to study groups as small
4:99:6724:20:21:100:546:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:as the top 0.01% of individuals. Since wealth is highly concentrated, the top is quantitatively
4:100:6819:21:20:100:503:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:important.2Moreover, as seen in Figures 1a and 1b, it is also qualitatively different.
4:101:6905:20:20:117:546:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Several pieces of evidence support our hypothesis. We construct a model of asset devolution
4:102:6996:20:21:100:546:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:where only men generate wealth, but both men and women inherit and find that explaining
4:103:7083:21:20:100:546:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the estate tax data broken down by gender and marital status requires a U-shaped pattern
4:104:7171:20:20:100:546:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the importance of self-made wealth. Second, two sets of “rich lists” – the Forbes’ list of
4:105:7264:20:20:100:546:262:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the wealthiest 400 Americans compiled annually since 1982; and “A Classification of American
4:106:7356:20:21:100:546:242:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Wealth” which chronicles wealthy Americans from 1675 and 1950 (at 25 year intervals) –
4:107:7442:21:20:100:546:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:provide direct evidence on the relationship between the gender wealth distribution and the
4:108:7532:20:20:100:546:201:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:role of inherited wealth at the top. In both sets of lists, the fraction of those who inherited
4:109:7627:20:21:100:546:181:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:wealth and the fraction of women are highly correlated. Furthermore, from its start in 1982
4:110:7718:21:20:100:546:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to the present, the Forbes list suggests a sharply diminished role of inherited wealth; while
4:111:7811:20:16:100:546:140:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:A Classification of American Wealth shows an increasing role for inherited wealth beginning
4:112:7902:16:20:112:546:124:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:2For instance, the estimated wealth held by those in the Forbes 400 (the top 1/50th of the top 0.01%) peaked
4:113:8010:20:17:100:546:104:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:at over 3.5% in 2000 and the top 1% of households is estimated to hold as much as 34% of total wealth (Scholz,
4:114:8120:17:0:100:233:87:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:2003; Kopczuk and Saez, 2004a).
5:115:8152:0:20:100:546:729:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in 1875 through its end year 1950. Third, if the share of women among top wealth groups
5:116:8239:20:20:100:546:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:reflects the importance of inherited wealth, we would expect (the inverse of) measures of
5:117:8328:20:21:100:546:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:entrepreneurship to vary accordingly.  Using Census data from the Integrated Public Use
5:118:8415:21:20:100:546:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Microdata Series (IPUMS), we find that the fraction of the labor force who are employers (a
5:119:8506:20:20:100:522:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:potential gauge of entrepreneurship) exhibited a U-shaped pattern over the last century.
5:120:8594:20:21:117:546:628:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:A note on terminology is warranted.  We favor a distinction based on how wealth was
5:121:8677:21:20:100:546:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:primarily obtained: inherited (or bequeathed) or self-made. We will use the terms “rentiers”
5:122:8769:20:20:100:546:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and “entrepreneurs” to denote those who inherited and made their wealth respectively, unless
5:123:8861:20:21:100:192:567:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:otherwise specified.
5:124:8881:21:20:117:546:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents our primary data source
5:125:8971:20:20:100:546:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:— tabulations derived from the administrative estate tax data base — and supplementary
5:126:9057:20:21:100:546:506:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:data in the form of rich-lists. Section 3 presents a simple descriptive model that highlights
5:127:9150:21:20:100:546:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mechanisms that could drive changes in the gender and marital composition of the wealthy.
5:128:9239:20:20:100:546:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We use this model to evaluate the plausibility of our hypothesis and to infer the importance
5:129:9331:20:21:100:546:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of inherited vs. self-made fortunes. We then discuss the validity of our key assumption that
5:130:9423:21:20:100:546:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:wealthy women at the top arrive at wealth through inheritance, and show direct evidence
5:131:9510:20:20:100:546:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of changes to the relative importance of inherited and self-made wealth from rich-lists.  In
5:132:9602:20:21:100:546:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:section 4, we consider a number of alternative hypotheses, chief among which is changes to the
5:133:9696:21:20:100:546:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tax code, changes which impact the tax-minimizing allocation of wealth between spouses. The
5:134:9787:20:20:100:546:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:marriage market changed substantially as well. Specifically, we discuss the role of divorce laws
5:135:9883:20:21:100:546:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:liberalization and changing norms for spousal allocation of property. Finally, we discuss the
5:136:9976:21:20:100:546:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:role of changes to the distribution of estates between community and non-community property
5:137:10067:20:20:100:546:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:states. Section 5 concludes with a fuller discussion of how our finding relates to the literature
5:138:10164:20:44:100:395:262:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on the role of technological change and income concentration.
5:139:10225:44:31:100:159:218:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:2  Data
5:140:10232:31:20:100:546:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Our main data source is the set of tabulations based on micro estate tax data collected by the
5:141:10326:20:20:100:546:167:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Statistics of Income Division of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The database of estate
5:142:10417:20:21:100:546:147:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tax returns contains all returns filed since the introduction of the federal estate tax in 1916
5:143:10512:21:0:100:546:126:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:through 1945, samples for 1962, 1965, 1969, 1972, 1976 and all years after 1982. Our data cover
6:144:10608:0:20:100:546:729:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the period 1925-2000.3The data contain most of the information recorded on the tax returns,
6:145:10699:20:20:100:546:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:including basic demographic characteristic such as age, gender, marital status and state of
6:146:10790:20:21:100:546:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:residence. Although the database itself is confidential, we obtained very detailed tabulations
6:147:10884:21:20:100:546:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:by finely defined wealth categories, marital property regime in place in the state of residence
6:148:10979:20:20:100:546:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(not available in 1962 and 1972), marital status (not available in 1965) and gender. We will
6:149:11071:20:21:100:337:628:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:concentrate on groups within the wealthiest .4%.4
6:150:11120:21:20:117:546:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We will study both the distribution of decedents and the distribution of the living con-
6:151:11208:20:20:100:546:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:structed from estate tax returns. For the latter, we will employ the estate multiplier method-
6:152:11302:20:21:100:546:567:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ology as in Kopczuk and Saez (2004a) and further discussed in the Appendix.  The estate
6:153:11389:21:20:100:546:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:multiplier methodology amounts to weighting the population by the inverse of the mortality
6:154:11479:20:20:100:546:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rate, essentially treating death as a random sampling device. As mentioned, Figure 1a show
6:155:11569:20:21:100:546:506:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the evolution over the past century of the fraction of women among decedents in the top 1
6:156:11658:21:20:100:546:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:percent divided in four categories: the wealthiest 0.01% (P99.99-100), the wealthiest 0.10%,
6:157:11750:20:20:100:546:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:those between the top 0.10% and the top 0.40% (P99.60-99.90), and finally those between the
6:158:11841:20:21:100:547:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:top 0.40% and the top 1% (P99-99.6).5Figure 1b shows the same series for “the living,” where
6:159:11933:21:20:100:353:424:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:the data has been weighed by the estate multipliers.6
6:160:11986:20:20:117:546:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:There are two (not mutually exclusive) ways of viewing the difference between patterns
6:161:12072:20:21:100:546:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:emerging for decedents and the living. First, mechanically, estate-multiplier weighting puts
6:162:12164:21:20:100:546:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:greater emphasis on younger individuals. Second, and relatedly, the estate multiplier technique
6:163:12259:20:20:100:546:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:shows values more representative of the whole population not just because of mortality-adjusted
6:164:12354:20:21:100:546:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:weighting, but also because estates of younger decedents are much less likely to be skewed by
6:165:12447:21:20:100:546:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:any tax-motivated planning. For instance, Kopczuk (2007) found that a substantial share of
6:166:12537:20:20:100:546:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tax-motivated adjustments takes place following the onset of a terminal illness. Since younger
6:167:12631:20:20:100:546:262:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:individuals are more likely to have died unexpectedly, these types of adjustments are less
6:168:12721:20:21:100:546:242:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:important for the young. Lastly, the series for the living allows for differences in the age profile
6:169:12821:21:20:100:546:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of wealth for men and women (and can thus account for differences in the length of time a
6:170:12910:20:17:100:200:201:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:person was wealthy).
6:171:12930:17:20:112:546:184:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:3A more detailed description of the 1916-1945 data can be found in McCubbin (1990), while the post-1945
6:172:13033:20:9:100:529:164:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:studies are described in Johnson (1994). Between 1916-1924 we have no information about marital status.
6:173:13136:9:20:112:546:155:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:4Due to the varying coverage of the estate tax, this is the largest group for which we can construct shares
6:174:13243:20:9:100:150:135:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:for all years.
6:175:13257:9:12:112:542:126:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:5Wealth thresholds in 2000 (2000 dollars) were 24,415,150, 5,503,678, 2,139,887 and 1,172,896 respectively.
6:176:13364:12:21:112:547:114:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:6All figures based on estate tax returns use shares based on yearst−2 tot+ 2 (when adjacent years are
6:177:13465:21:0:100:141:93:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:available).
7:178:13477:0:20:100:546:729:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:B:Other data sources.Since 1982, the Forbes magazine has published an annual list of the
7:179:13563:20:20:100:546:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:richest 400 Americans (the top 2% of our top group P99.99-100). Forbes attributes wealth
7:180:13651:20:21:100:546:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to the person mainly responsible for its generation and not its ownership, a method which is
7:181:13743:21:20:100:546:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:likely to introduce a male bias compared to the estate tax data (e.g., only Bill Gates appears
7:182:13837:20:20:100:546:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on the list, not his spouse). Forbes does not rely on administrative data and it may be that
7:183:13929:20:21:100:514:628:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:wealthy women are less visible than wealthy men, e.g., from being less activist owners.
7:184:14016:21:20:117:546:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:For earlier periods, information is less comprehensive. We present data from A Classifica-

7:189:14443:20:21:117:546:506:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We will also make limited use of the list of some 4,000 millionaires in 1892 published by
7:190:14532:21:20:100:210:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the New York Tribune.
7:191:14553:20:20:117:546:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Both the Forbes list and the Classification contain information about the source of wealth,
7:192:14644:20:21:100:546:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and specify whether it was inherited. The New York Tribune list does not contain an explicit
7:193:14736:21:20:100:546:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:indicator for inheritance, but it does contain a description of the source of wealth that we
7:194:14828:20:20:100:546:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rely on to assign the inheritance status, as described in the Data Appendix. None of the lists
7:195:14922:20:21:100:546:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:specifies explicitly the gender of the person. We assigned gender relying on first names and
7:196:15014:21:20:100:486:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:other available information using the algorithm described in the Data Appendix.
7:197:15093:20:20:117:546:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We also use the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (Ruggles et al., 2004) extracts
7:198:15179:20:21:100:546:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from Censuses for 1920 through 2000. The Data Appendix discusses in more detail how we

7:201:15344:31:20:100:546:228:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In this section we first formulate a simple descriptive model of asset devolution in which
7:202:15434:20:21:100:546:208:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:only men generate wealth but both men and women inherit. We use the model to estimate
7:203:15519:21:20:100:546:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the shares of rentiers and self-made among the wealthy using the estate tax data. We find
7:204:15608:20:20:100:546:167:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that the implied share of entrepreneurs in the economy follows a U-shaped pattern over the
7:205:15698:20:21:100:546:147:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:study period, 1925-2000. We then consider those who never married. Simply put, if sons and
7:206:15788:21:16:100:546:126:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:daughters inherit equally, we would expect the surplus of men over women in this group to

8:210:16113:0:20:100:546:729:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:reflect the importance of entrepreneurs. Indeed, the share of never married men over never
8:211:16203:20:20:100:546:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:married women in the estate data also follows a U-shaped pattern. Next, we discuss patterns
8:212:16294:20:21:100:546:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:emerging from the Forbes 400 list and A Classification of American Wealth. The shares of
8:213:16382:21:20:100:546:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:women and rentiers are highly correlated in these lists, and the lists corroborate the pattern
8:214:16476:20:20:100:546:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:found in the estate tax returns. Finally, we show that patterns of entrepreneurship over the
8:215:16568:20:21:100:415:628:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:course of the 20thcentury are also consistent with other evidence.
8:216:16634:21:20:117:546:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Alternative explanations such as changes to the tax code, changing social norms for intra-

8:218:16817:20:36:100:497:567:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ciles of the wealthy (community vs. common law states) are discussed in Section 4.

8:220:16963:28:20:100:546:503:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:For simplicity, our model describes population in a particular yeari, ignoring cross-dependence
8:221:17058:20:21:100:546:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:over time. As a convention, we will use Greek symbols for parameters that we will estimate
8:222:17148:21:20:100:546:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f10:B:(α,γandσ) and Latin letters (bandc) for those whose values we will assume. Subscripti
8:223:17233:20:20:100:207:442:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:denotes calendar time.
8:224:17255:20:20:117:546:422:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Consider a world where only men generate wealth but both men and women inherit. We
8:225:17337:20:21:100:546:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:will provide evidence supporting this assumption in Section 3.3. For simplicity, assume that
8:226:17429:21:20:100:546:381:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:everybody marries once and is survived by one son and one daughter, and there is no divorce.
8:227:17521:20:20:100:546:361:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Clearly, the gender wealth distribution amongdecedentswill depend on which spouse dies
8:228:17607:20:21:100:546:341:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:first, how much of the estate is passed on to the surviving spouse, how long he or she continues

8:230:17796:20:20:100:546:300:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:However, conditional on the value of these parameters at any particular time, wealth held by
8:231:17888:20:21:100:546:280:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:women would decrease in times of new wealth accumulation and increase as this wealth is
8:232:17975:21:20:100:381:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:passed down the generations, unless new wealth is created.
8:233:18033:20:20:117:546:239:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:To further fix ideas, we assume that there are two kinds of couples among the wealthy:
8:234:18119:20:21:100:228:219:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rentiers and entrepreneurs.
8:235:18146:21:20:117:546:198:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Rentier couples can derive their wealth from either the husband or the wife.8We denote by
8:236:18235:20:20:100:547:178:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:1−αithe fraction of couples of this kind in yeari. We assume that the person who inherited
8:237:18325:20:16:100:546:158:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:wealth will be subject to the estate tax while the spouse falls below the threshold, regardless
8:238:18420:16:21:112:546:142:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:8If both members of the couple were rentiers, this is equivalent to two couples with one rentier each. Our
8:239:18526:21:16:100:547:121:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:model cannot distinguish between those two cases.  If there are couples with two rentiers,αineeds to be
8:240:18629:16:16:100:546:105:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:reinterpreted accordingly. Implicitly, we assume that the frequency of rentiers marrying each other has not
8:241:18736:16:0:100:176:89:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:changed over time.
9:242:18755:0:20:100:546:729:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of the order of death. That is, we assume that the rentier does not bequeath enough wealth to
9:243:18848:20:20:100:546:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the surviving spouse for us to observe both in our data. Our key assumption is that the rentier
9:244:18943:20:21:100:546:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sex ratio is constant and more female than the entrepreneur sex ratio. For simplicity, we will
9:245:19037:21:20:100:546:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:assume that there are equally many men and women rentiers, i.e., on average, we observe.5
9:246:19126:20:20:100:285:648:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:men and.5 women per rentier couple.9
9:247:19162:20:21:117:547:628:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:There areαientrepreneur couples. If the man dies first, we observe him (as a married
9:248:19246:21:20:100:547:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:male) with certainty, and his wife as a widow with frequencyγi. In principle,γican be any
9:249:19335:20:20:100:546:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:positive number, but we focus onγi∈[0,1], which would be the case if husbands do not pass
9:250:19424:20:21:100:540:567:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:all their wealth to their widows or widows de-cumulate or pursue tax-avoidance strategies.10
9:251:19516:21:20:117:547:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:If the woman dies first, we observe her with frequencyc, which reflects (but is not equal
9:252:19605:20:20:100:546:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to) her share of property. We will often assume thatc= 0, i.e., the wife of an entrepreneur
9:253:19696:20:21:100:547:506:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is not sufficiently wealthy to appear in the top group. The polar case is that ofc= 1, i.e.,
9:254:19788:21:20:100:546:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the wife is as wealthy as her husband. We will vary the value ofcto represent the strength
9:255:19878:20:20:100:546:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of the community property rules across states. The widower may pursue tax avoidance and
9:256:19965:20:21:100:546:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:de-cumulate. We allow for this possibility by assuming that we observe the husband in such
9:257:20055:21:20:100:214:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cases with frequencyσi.
9:258:20078:20:20:117:547:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:To complete the model, we posit that the probability of a wife dying first is equal tobiand is

10:290:21074:0:20:100:546:729:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:B:Estimation.We observe shares of the marital/gender categories in the data for each yeari.
10:291:21163:20:20:100:546:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Because the shares add to one in any given year, we have three independent moment conditions
10:292:21255:20:21:100:546:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:specified in Table 1. The model includes five parameters:bi,c,αi,γiandσi, four of which
10:293:21342:21:20:100:546:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:vary by time, as indicated by the subscripti. We assume the values forbiandcas discussed
10:294:21430:20:20:100:547:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:below and, in our baseline specification, estimate the remaining three parameters –σi,γiand
10:295:21521:20:21:100:547:628:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f2:B:αi– for each yeari. Since there is no cross-dependence across years, this procedure amounts
10:296:21612:21:20:100:498:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to solving a (quadratic) system of three equations in three unknowns for each year.
10:297:21695:20:20:117:546:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:This procedure may be interpreted as a very simple calibration exercise. Equivalently, it
10:298:21784:20:21:100:546:567:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:amounts to a just-identified method-of-moments approach where we match predictions of our
10:299:21873:21:20:100:546:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:structural model with three unknown parameters to three independent moment estimates, i.e.,
10:300:21964:20:20:100:476:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the means of three (out of four) dummies for gender/marital status categories.
10:301:22042:20:21:117:546:506:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:This approach is very demanding — it requires estimating three parameters for each year
10:302:22129:21:20:100:546:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:— but it has the advantage of imposing little structure on the evolution of parameters over
10:303:22220:20:20:100:546:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:time. As an alternative, we will consider a more parsimonious empirical model that imposes
10:304:22310:20:21:100:546:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f10:B:more structure on the parameters. Rather than attempt to estimate separate values ofα,γ
10:305:22397:21:20:100:546:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:andσfor each year, we will assume that each of these parameters is a smooth function of time.
10:306:22490:20:20:100:546:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:More specifically, in order to test for the U-shaped pattern ofα, we assume that they are all
10:307:22583:20:21:100:546:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:quadratic functions:α(t) =α0+α1(t−1925)/100 +α2((t−1925)/100)2, and analogously for
10:308:22666:21:20:100:546:363:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f2:B:σandγ. Our estimation procedure amounts to estimating a system of nonlinear equations
10:309:22751:20:35:100:510:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:using information for all years simultaneously and is described in the Data Appendix.

10:311:22928:21:20:100:547:287:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:forαiby combining the share of married women and the share of married men. These shares
10:312:23015:20:20:100:546:267:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are equal to the expressions shown in the table that depend only onαiand constants divided

10:324:23384:21:20:100:546:138:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to which a wife shared the wealth generated by the husband. Once we know (assume) the

11:343:24652:20:20:100:546:443:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f13:B:the model imposes additional restrictions due to the presence of these groups. We know thatγi
11:344:24745:20:20:100:546:423:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:andσimust be non-negative. Given the solution forαi, the equations for widows and widowers
11:345:24835:20:21:100:547:403:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are linear inγiandσi, and so is the sum of all four terms. Consequently, the explicit solutions
11:346:24930:21:20:100:546:382:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:forγiandσican be easily derived as solutions of linear equations. Whether the values implied
11:347:25022:20:20:100:298:362:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:by these solutions are positive is testable.
11:348:25066:20:21:117:546:342:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:There are two confounding factors in the model. First, the frequency of observing married
11:349:25155:21:20:100:546:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:men and married women depends onbi, the likelihood that a woman dies first. We cannot
11:350:25240:20:20:100:546:301:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimatebifrom our model. Therefore, we estimate the actual likelihood using the IPUMS
11:351:25326:20:21:100:546:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:census data for 1920 through 2000 combined with mortality rates from Social Security mortality
11:352:25420:21:20:100:546:260:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tables (further described in the Appendix).  The estimated value ofbiwas 0.4 in 1920.  It
11:353:25509:20:20:100:546:240:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:was falling until the 1980 Census when it reached its minimum at slightly over 0.27 and it
11:354:25599:20:16:100:317:220:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:subsequently increased to slightly over 0.30.11
11:355:25646:16:21:109:546:204:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:11An additional assumption that we make is thatbiis the same for rentier and entrepreneur couples. We
11:356:25747:21:16:100:546:183:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:verified this assumption using pooled SCF data for 1989-2001. We defined the “wealthy” as those in the top 1%
11:357:25856:16:16:100:546:167:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:of wealth distribution in each year and as rentiers those who reported inheritance of at least $5 million in 2004
11:358:25969:16:17:100:546:151:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:dollars (the value of inheritance was supposed to be reported at the time it was received, we applied a 5% real
11:359:26080:17:16:100:546:134:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:rate of return to obtain present value). We then estimatedbfor rentiers and the rest (self-made) in the same
11:360:26188:16:17:100:546:118:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:manner as for the Census data. The estimated value ofbfor rentiers was 0.314 and for self-made it was 0.322.
11:361:26296:17:16:100:547:101:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:Varying the rate of return, the threshold for the wealthy group and for being a rentier madebvary between
11:362:26401:16:0:100:355:85:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:0.29 and 0.38 with no clear pattern for which group dominates.
12:363:26464:0:20:117:546:729:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Second, the extent to which the wife shares wealth in entrepreneur couples,c, clearly
12:364:26549:20:20:100:546:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:influences the number of married women at any given level ofαi.12Since states differ in
12:365:26636:20:21:100:546:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:their treatment of property acquired during marriage, we estimate the model separately for
12:366:26726:21:20:100:546:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:states with different property regimes. There are three regimes to consider: community prop-
12:367:26818:20:20:100:546:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:erty, common law, and equitable distribution. Eight states were community property states
12:368:26907:20:21:100:546:628:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:throughout our study period, meaning that property acquired during marriage was considered
12:369:26997:21:20:100:546:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:marital property.13The remaining states were common law states where property formerly
12:370:27083:20:20:100:546:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:was allocated according to title. However, with greater incidence of divorce, this system was
12:371:27176:20:21:100:546:567:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:deemed unfair as it exposed many wives to financial hardship on divorce. Therefore, a number
12:372:27268:21:20:100:546:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of states applied the principle of equitable distribution, i.e., divorce judges would allocate assets
12:373:27369:20:20:100:546:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:according to fairness.14Equitable distribution was already in place in 25 states in 1970 (Gray,
12:374:27464:20:21:100:546:506:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:1998), and by 1994 the remaining eight states had adopted equitable distribution (Weisberg
12:375:27554:21:20:100:546:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and Appleton, 2002). We code states according to their status in 1970, following Gray (1998,
12:376:27646:20:20:100:519:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Table 1), where common law states are those that allocated property according to title.
12:377:27733:20:21:117:546:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Another concern is the possibility thatcchanged over time. It is conceivable thatchas
12:378:27818:21:20:100:546:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:increased over time (e.g., the aforementioned shift towards equitable distribution)..  Never-
12:379:27911:20:20:100:546:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:theless, from the discussion above it is clear higher value ofcleads to a higher estimate of
12:380:28003:20:21:100:546:384:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f2:B:α. Hence, allowingcto increase over the period whenαis estimated to be increasing would
12:381:28090:21:20:100:546:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:further strengthen this pattern. We will find thatαhas been increasing over the past 30 years.
12:382:28184:20:20:100:546:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Thus, our assumption of a constantcis conservative with respect to this key finding. We will
12:383:28276:20:36:100:254:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:return to this issue in Section 4.
12:384:28310:36:20:100:546:287:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:B:Model  resultsWe estimated our model using data for decedents for all of the U.S. and
12:385:28395:20:20:100:546:267:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:then separately for common law and non-common law states. For illustration, we present in
12:386:28484:20:21:100:546:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Figure 3 the underlying moments of data — shares of gender/marital status categories in the
12:387:28575:21:20:100:546:226:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:top 0.01% — for all states. The results forαiare shown on Figure 4a for both all states and
12:388:28666:20:16:100:546:206:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:common law states, under assumption thatc= 0. To smooth the series, we use shares defined
12:389:28755:16:20:109:546:190:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:12However, the direction in whichαimoves with changes in the ratio of married women to married men does
12:390:28858:20:17:100:546:170:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:not depend on the chosen value ofc, since equation 1 is decreasing inras long asc<1 (which we consider the
12:391:28964:17:9:100:163:153:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:relevant range).
12:392:28980:9:20:109:546:144:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:13Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, and Washington. Wisconsin changed
12:393:29081:20:16:100:546:124:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:from equitable distribution to community property in 1986.  When we split the sample with respect to the
12:394:29185:16:9:100:292:108:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:marital property regime, we exclude Wisconsin.
12:395:29231:9:20:109:546:99:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:14The length of the marriage and the non-market contributions of the financially weaker spouse are among
12:396:29335:20:0:100:191:79:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:the factors considered.
13:397:29360:0:20:100:547:729:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:based on yearst−2 tot+ 2, when available. The results forαi, σi,andγiare in Figures A-1a
13:398:29448:20:20:100:546:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(all) and A-1b (common law). The figures show a marked decline in the share of entrepreneurs
13:399:29540:20:21:100:546:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:until the 1970s and then an increase. This pattern is much more pronounced in common law
13:400:29628:21:20:100:130:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:states.
13:401:29635:20:20:117:547:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The corresponding results based on the parametric approach that allows forα,γandσto
13:402:29718:20:21:100:546:628:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:change as a quadratic function of time are presented in Table 3. Our hypothesis is thatα2>0
13:403:29809:21:20:100:547:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and that the minimum (equal to 1925−100α12α2) falls at some point in the 1960s or 1970s.
13:404:29897:20:20:100:547:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Furthermore, the model assumes thatγ(t)>0 andσ(t)>0. When we attempt to estimate
13:405:29977:20:21:100:546:567:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the model on the full sample, we find thatα2is indeed positive but insignificant, with the
13:406:30067:21:20:100:547:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:minimum not falling in the expected region. However, there is no evidence either thatγ(t) or
13:407:30159:20:20:100:547:526:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f2:B:σ(t) are anything but constants. We can improve the power of the method by restricting those
13:408:30251:20:21:100:546:506:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:two parameters to be constant over time. As the second specification shows, the corresponding
13:409:30344:21:20:100:546:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:results are very much in line with our story; the implied pattern is also shown in Figure 4a.
13:410:30437:20:20:100:546:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The minimum level ofαis estimated to take place in 1973, with alpha bottoming out at 0.33,
13:411:30527:20:21:100:546:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:down from the maximum of 0.74. All of the parameters fall within the economically sensible
13:412:30617:21:20:100:546:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:region —γandσare positive and well below one, while the range ofαis contained between
13:413:30702:20:20:100:546:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:0 and 1. We then repeat the analogous experiment for the common law states. As argued
13:414:30787:20:21:100:546:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:before, the model is likely to perform better for such states. This is indeed what we find even
13:415:30882:21:20:100:546:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:without imposing restrictions onγandσ. The results are qualitatively similar to those based
13:416:30973:20:20:100:546:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on the full sample, with added significance. The model does worse for the remaining states,
13:417:31064:20:21:100:546:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:although onceγandσare restricted to be constant, the quadratic pattern is again present
13:418:31151:21:20:100:474:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and significant. In that case though the restriction thatγ >0 is now violated.
13:419:31229:20:20:117:546:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:One reason to favor the results from common law states is that our model performs worse on
13:420:31319:20:20:100:546:262:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:other dimensions in equitable distribution and community property states. In the unrestricted
13:421:31412:20:21:100:546:242:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:specification, common law states are the only ones for which the non-negativeness restrictions
13:422:31506:21:20:100:546:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:imposed by the model on the values ofγiandσiare not rejected. This may be because our
13:423:31591:20:20:100:546:201:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:models perform better for lowc, and arguably,cis the lowest in common law states. Forc= 1
13:424:31680:20:21:100:547:181:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:our model cannot distinguish between entrepreneur and rentier wealth (αiis not identified).
13:425:31771:21:20:100:547:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Also, for values ofcclose to 1, we would expect much greater sensitivity of results to sampling
13:426:31866:20:20:100:546:140:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:variation and measurement error, a problem that is exacerbated by the fact that the sample
13:427:31956:20:16:100:482:120:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:size for community property and equitable distribution states is much smaller.15
13:428:32036:16:21:109:546:104:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:15In the 1990s, approximately 50% of observations come from the common law states and a quarter from each
13:429:32141:21:0:100:546:83:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:of the remaining two groups. In the first part of the century, residents of community property states constituted
14:430:32256:0:20:117:546:729:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Sensitivity of the results to the assumed value ofcis investigated in Figure 4b. As discussed
14:431:32349:20:20:100:546:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the previous section, higher values ofchave a monotonic effect on the value ofα. Even for
14:432:32441:20:21:100:546:689:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f2:B:cas low as 0.1, the implied value ofαin common law states can be greater than one hence
14:433:32528:21:20:100:546:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rejecting the model.  While the choice ofcmatters for the actual value ofα, these figures
14:434:32617:20:20:100:546:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:illustrate that its choice has no effect on the qualitative conclusion regarding the time-pattern
14:435:32714:20:21:100:282:628:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of the share of entrepreneurial wealth.
14:436:32753:21:20:117:546:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Assuming thatc= 0 is particularly problematic for the non-common law states. Hence, we
14:437:32839:20:20:100:546:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:repeat our parametric approach using a higher value ofc,c= 0.2, with the results presented in
14:438:32932:20:21:100:546:567:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the corresponding columns of Table 3. This change has no qualitative implications for any of
14:439:33024:21:20:100:546:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the groups of states, in each case preserving the quadratic pattern. Given the results shown on
14:440:33119:20:20:100:546:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Figure 4b, it is not surprising to seeαfalls out of the (0,1) range in the pooled specification and
14:441:33218:20:21:100:546:506:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for the common law states. At the same time, all the model restrictions for the non-common
14:442:33308:21:20:100:546:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:law states now hold. We conclude that, conditional on imposed parametric restrictions, there
14:443:33400:20:20:100:547:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is statistically significant evidence of the presence of a U-shaped profile ofαfor all groups of
14:444:33496:20:21:100:546:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:states, dependent on the marital property regime specific choice ofc. These findings are of
14:445:33587:21:20:100:351:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:course in line with the patterns visible on Figure 4a.
14:446:33641:20:20:117:546:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The decline in the share of women in the top group was more pronounced among the
14:447:33721:20:21:100:546:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:living than decedents. Therefore, we would like to estimate our model on the former group as
14:448:33813:21:20:100:546:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:well. However, the model was formulated for the decedent population and cannot match the
14:449:33901:20:20:100:546:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:data for the living (who are younger and consequently more married). A model for the living
14:450:33992:20:21:100:546:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:would have to give greater weight to married individuals, how much higher we do not know.
14:451:34081:21:20:100:546:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:However, considering only those who are married in the full population, clearly there must be
14:452:34174:20:20:100:546:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:equal numbers of men and women. Thus, the extent to which we observe more married men
14:453:34259:20:20:100:546:262:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:than married women among the wealthy would be driven byαi, the share of entrepreneurs
14:454:34344:20:21:100:546:242:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(for a constantc6= 1). In terms of our model, equations for the number of married men and
14:455:34433:21:20:100:546:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:married women remain valid withbi= 0.5, while equations for widowed men and women do
14:456:34517:20:20:100:546:201:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:not because they should be multiplied by the unknown survival factors. As before, the solution
14:457:34611:20:21:100:546:181:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:forαican be derived based on equations for married men and women only. Assuming that
14:458:34695:21:20:100:546:160:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f2:B:c= 0 andbi= 0.5, we have thatαi= (1−ˆri)/(1+ ˆri), where ˆri=married women yearimarried men yeari. Figure 4c
14:459:34803:20:20:100:547:140:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:shows the estimate ofαithus obtained from data for thelivingboth for all and just for common
14:460:34895:20:21:100:546:120:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:law states. An advantage of this approach is that the estimate of the share of entrepreneurs is
14:461:34990:21:20:100:489:99:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:independent of the constructed value ofbi. Again,αifollows a U-shaped pattern.
14:462:35068:20:0:100:470:79:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:of the order of 10% or less of wealthy decedents and common law states made up over 60%.
15:463:35158:0:27:100:171:729:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:3.2  Singles
15:464:35170:27:20:100:546:702:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The never married (henceforth, singles) can provide further evidence on the relative importance
15:465:35265:20:21:100:546:682:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of inherited vs. self-made wealth. If, as before, sons and daughters inherit equally, but only men
15:466:35363:21:20:100:546:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:make wealth, then all single women inherited. Assume for now similar marriage ages for rentier
15:467:35457:20:20:100:546:641:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:men and women, then the number of single men in excess of single women would be due to
15:468:35543:20:21:100:546:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:self-made wealth. Figure 5a (5b) shows the fraction of decedent (living) single men and women
15:469:35636:21:20:100:546:600:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:respectively for P99.90-100.16Figure 6a (6b) shows the implied fraction of entrepreneurs. Note
15:470:35730:20:20:100:476:580:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:that the implied fraction of entrepreneurs indeed follows a U-shaped pattern.17
15:471:35809:20:21:117:546:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The evidence from the singles is particularly interesting since arguably the gender com-
15:472:35897:21:20:100:546:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:position in this group is relatively invariant to changes in the tax code, marital deduction in
15:473:35992:20:20:100:150:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:particular.
15:474:36003:20:21:117:546:499:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:While not definitive, these findings do line up with other evidence. A possible objection is
15:475:36095:21:20:100:546:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that rentier men may marry at substantially different ages than rentier women. For instance if
15:476:36189:20:20:100:546:458:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:men married later, we would see more single men. Also, a U-shaped pattern for the excess of
15:477:36280:20:21:100:546:438:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:single men over single women could be driven by a similar movement in the marriage age gap,
15:478:36371:21:36:100:541:417:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:although we are not aware of such a movement in the marriage mores of heirs and heiresses.
15:479:36461:36:27:100:315:381:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:3.3  Rich-lists and IPUMS evidence
15:480:36495:27:21:100:546:354:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The Forbes list provides direct evidence of a strong (positive) link between inherited wealth
15:481:36588:21:20:100:546:333:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and the share of women; and their parallel decline. In 2004, Forbes estimated the wealth of
15:482:36679:20:20:100:546:313:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Margaret Whitman (eBay) at $1.6 billion, making her the richest self-made woman in the
15:483:36765:20:20:100:546:293:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:United States. Despite theMargaret Whitman’s andOprah Winfrey’s of the world, the Forbes
15:484:36853:20:21:100:546:273:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:400 lists suggest that family remains the primary route to wealth for women.  According
15:485:36940:21:20:100:546:252:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to the 2004 list, the wealthiest women in America inherited their wealth.  Ms. Whitman’s
15:486:37028:20:20:100:546:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:achievements only afforded her the 152nd spot, well short of positions occupied by the widow
15:487:37120:20:21:100:546:212:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and the daughter of Sam Walton, the Mars fortune heiress, Cox daughters and others. In fact,
15:488:37212:21:20:100:546:191:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:all seven women among the 25 richest Americans came to wealth through their families. In
15:489:37300:20:16:100:324:171:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:contrast, of the 18 top men, 14 were self-made.
15:490:37347:16:13:109:546:155:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:16Single individuals are overall a small fraction and therefore we need to define the top category more widely.
15:491:37458:13:20:109:546:142:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:17There were more women then men in 1969 and 1976 and thus the estimate of the fraction of entrepreneurs
15:492:37562:20:16:100:546:122:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:is negative for these years. While clearly this cannot be the case, treating death as a random sampling device,
15:493:37673:16:17:100:546:106:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:this is what we would expect to estimate with probability .5 if there were no self-made wealth at all (and thus
15:494:37784:17:16:100:546:89:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:equally many men and women among the wealthy). Another possibility is that there were more unmarried
15:495:37884:16:0:100:476:73:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:heiresses than unmarried heirs, for instance due to the former marrying later than the latter.
16:496:37980:0:20:117:546:729:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Table 4 lists, by year, the number (and share) of women on the list, and specifically those
16:497:38071:20:20:100:546:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:who had inherited their wealth. It is noteworthy that while women make up 45-50% of those
16:498:38160:20:21:100:546:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:who inherited wealth, their share among the self-made is substantially lower (6.6% in 2003).
16:499:38252:21:20:100:546:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Moreover, the drop in the share of women is mirrored by a drop in the share of individuals who
16:500:38346:20:20:100:546:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:inherited wealth. In 1982, more than one third had inherited, whereas by 2003 this fraction
16:501:38437:20:21:100:216:628:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:had more than halved.18
16:502:38460:21:20:117:546:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The importance of inheritance for women’s wealth is hardly new. The list of some 4,000
16:503:38546:20:20:100:546:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:millionaires in 1892 published by the New York Tribune showed a much greater fraction of
16:504:38634:20:21:100:546:567:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:women among those who had inherited than those who were self-made, Table 6. A similar
16:505:38719:21:20:100:546:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:pattern emerges from A Classification of American Wealth, Table 5.  While the number of
16:506:38806:20:20:100:546:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:observations is small for the early years and the fraction of women varies widely, the last three
16:507:38903:20:21:100:546:506:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:data points are most relevant for us. In 1900-1950, the fraction of women among those who
16:508:38992:21:20:100:546:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:had inherited wealth was fairly steady and around 60 percent (no women were self-made).
16:509:39079:20:20:100:546:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Moreover, for the period 1875-1950 these data show a steady increase in the role of inherited
16:510:39172:20:21:100:546:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:wealth, consistent with our hypothesis that the rise in the share of women in the estate tax
16:511:39264:21:20:100:455:424:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:data is linked to inherited wealth playing an increasingly important role.19
16:512:39340:20:20:117:546:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Further evidence for the importance of entrepreneurs can be obtained from the censuses.
16:513:39427:20:21:100:546:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Using the IPUMS data, we calculate the fraction of the labor force that is self-employed,
16:514:39516:21:20:100:546:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and, for some years, employers. These data show that entrepreneurship, so measured, indeed
16:515:39606:20:16:100:410:343:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:declined between 1920-1970 and picked up thereafter, Figure 7.20

16:517:39780:20:17:100:546:307:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:show a similar pattern for the United Kingdom. According to a recent article, the percent on the list who had
16:518:39889:17:16:100:547:290:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f9:F:inherited wealth declined from 75% in 1989 (its start year) to 25% in 2006, (Times Online, 4/19/2007,http:
16:519:39995:16:16:100:546:274:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f5:F://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1676370.ece), although the original 1989 article (The Sunday
16:520:40098:16:17:100:546:258:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:Times, April 2nd1989) states that 57% of the wealthiest derive their wealth from inheritance. In both 1989 and
16:521:40208:17:16:100:546:241:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:2007 the number of women on the list is below 10%. Our women-based proxy for the importance of inheritance
16:522:40314:16:9:100:358:225:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:breaks down in a society with a strong male bias in inheritance.
16:523:40378:9:20:109:546:216:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:19The greater fraction of inherited wealth in the more inclusive category (top 400) may be an artifact of
16:524:40483:20:17:100:546:196:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:the data collection. Inherited wealth may be traceable and therefore relatively more visible in lower wealth
16:525:40591:17:16:100:546:179:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:categories. Also, the criterion for the source of wealth being due to inheritance is “...whether a person has
16:526:40700:16:17:100:546:163:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:significantly contributed to the management and development of a business, in which case he will be allocated a
16:527:40811:17:16:100:546:146:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:specific activity (e.g., banking, manufacturing, oil & gas, etc.),” (personal communication with Drew Caradine

16:529:41023:16:9:100:138:114:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:inherited.

17:531:41096:0:27:100:199:729:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:3.4  Significance
17:532:41113:27:20:100:546:702:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We have demonstrated several pieces of evidence supporting our hypothesis that wealth mo-
17:533:41202:20:21:100:546:682:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:bility in the 20thcentury followed a U-shaped pattern.  We consider (and largely dismiss)
17:534:41291:21:20:100:546:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:alternative explanations for the empirical patterns in the next section, which may skipped
17:535:41381:20:20:100:546:641:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:by readers convinced by the above analysis. Other than shedding light on the evolution of
17:536:41470:20:21:100:546:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:wealth mobility, these findings are of significance because they contribute to two important
17:537:41562:21:20:100:546:600:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:economic questions. First, the increase in the importance of self-made wealth since the 1970s
17:538:41655:20:20:100:546:580:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is consistent with the notion that general-purpose technological revolutions (such as the in-
17:539:41748:20:21:100:546:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:formation technology (IT) revolution) favor new over old capital (Greenwood and Jovanovic,
17:540:41838:21:20:100:546:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:1999; Hobijn and Jovanovic, 2001). Second, the implied process of obsolescence of old wealth
17:541:41930:20:20:100:546:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and creation of new wealth can offer a reconciliation of the diverging patterns in wealth and
17:542:42023:20:44:100:517:499:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:income concentration over the past 30 years. We elaborate on these issues in Section 5.
17:543:42110:44:31:100:301:455:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:4  Alternative Explanations
17:544:42137:31:20:100:546:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We now turn to alternative explanations: changes to the estate tax code, changing norms,
17:545:42225:20:36:100:510:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:divorce and remarriage, and changes to the geographic distribution of the population.
17:546:42310:36:20:100:546:368:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:B:Tax  changesThe tax treatment of estates may affect the gender wealth distribution by
17:547:42395:20:20:100:546:348:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:influencing allocation of assets between spouses.21There are two primary factors to consider:
17:548:42488:20:21:100:546:328:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the level and graduation of the estate tax; and the maximum marital deduction.  The tax
17:549:42575:21:20:100:546:307:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:treatment of marital transfers changed on several occasions, including the introduction of 50%
17:550:42669:20:20:100:546:287:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:marital deduction in 1948, an extension of marital deduction in 1976 to the greater of 50%
17:551:42759:20:16:100:546:267:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and $250,000 and unlimited marital deduction in 1981.22For our purposes, the 1981 change
17:552:42847:16:21:109:546:251:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:21The estate tax was introduced in 1916 but rates remained low until the 1930s, when they were very sharply
17:553:42954:21:16:100:546:230:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:increased (peaking at 77%) in a series of tax reforms between 1932 and 1942. Top rates were reduced in the tax
17:554:43064:16:16:100:546:214:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:reform of 1981 from 70% in 1982 to 55% in 1984 and thereafter. For 2006, the top rate is 46%. An excellent
17:555:43170:16:9:100:377:198:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:historical overview of estate taxation can be found in Luckey (1995).
17:556:43239:9:20:109:546:189:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:22The marital deduction arose as a means of correcting a perceived inequity in the tax treatment of estates
17:557:43346:20:17:100:546:169:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:between community and non-community property states. In the community property states, half of the com-
17:558:43449:17:16:100:546:152:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:munity property would be automatically subject to the estate tax while in non-community property states an
17:559:43555:16:17:100:546:136:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:exclusion would be granted only if the surviving spouse could be shown to have contributed to the acquisi-
17:560:43661:17:16:100:546:119:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:tion of property.  The introduction of marital deduction in 1948 was preceded by the 1942 legislation that
17:561:43767:16:17:100:546:103:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:attempted to tax community property, unless a reason for exception as in non-community property states could
17:562:43875:17:0:100:541:86:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:be established (Luckey, 1995). We investigate the relevance of the community property rules in what follows.
18:563:43985:0:20:100:546:729:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is of most interest (we have no data to study the 1948 change, and the 1976 extension did not
18:564:44078:20:20:100:252:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:affect higher wealth categories).
18:565:44111:20:21:117:546:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The 1981 introduction of unlimited marital deductions made it more advantageous to trans-
18:566:44200:21:20:100:546:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:fer assets to the surviving spouse at death (as opposed to an inter vivos transfer) – and as
18:567:44292:20:20:100:546:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:shown in Figure 8, marital deductions increased sharply after 1976 (our last year of data avail-
18:568:44388:20:21:100:546:628:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:able prior to 1981). A priori, we would expect a reduction in spousal inter vivos transfers and
18:569:44483:21:20:100:546:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:transfers to others (inter vivos or at death), and an increase in the net worth (as observed at
18:570:44578:20:20:100:546:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:death) of the married. The initial effect would be to make the wealthy wealthier, more likely
18:571:44671:20:21:100:546:567:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to be married and more male. Subsequently, we would expect wealth held at death by widows
18:572:44760:21:20:100:546:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(widowers) to increase (since, presumably, they inherited more), partly offsetting the initial
18:573:44854:20:20:100:260:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:“gains” of married men (women).
18:574:44885:20:21:117:546:506:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:This is roughly what we find for the decedents, Figure 3. The share of married men in the
18:575:44974:21:20:100:546:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:top group increases between 1976 and 1982 and the share of widowed women falls. There are
18:576:45063:20:20:100:546:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:weaker but corresponding patterns for married women and widowed men. The initial decline
18:577:45151:20:21:100:546:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is followed by a recovery among widows and widowers and a decline of married decedents. The
18:578:45242:21:20:100:546:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:evidence from the living is weaker, although some of the same patterns are visible. Consistent
18:579:45336:20:20:100:546:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with the logic that unlimited marital deduction reduces the incentives to reallocate wealth
18:580:45427:20:21:100:546:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:towards the wife inter vivo, we see a gradual increase in married men. However, widows no
18:581:45516:21:20:100:546:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:longer show a recovery post 1982, but a continued gradual decline, a development unlimited
18:582:45606:20:20:100:335:343:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:marital deduction cannot account for, Figure 9.23
18:583:45655:20:21:117:547:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The estimate ofαiin the model section decreases inri, the ratio of married women to
18:584:45738:21:20:100:547:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:married men. Thus, if unlimited marital deduction resulted in a decline inr(relatively more
18:585:45829:20:20:100:546:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:married men), then the rise inαiseen in Figure 4a may reflect tax changes rather than greater
18:586:45922:20:20:100:546:262:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:entrepreneurship. The effect of marital deduction on the relative number of married men and
18:587:46013:20:21:100:546:242:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:married women is difficult to assess. By reducing the penalty for holding on to wealth, the
18:588:46104:21:20:100:546:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:incentive to pursue tax avoidance after the 1981 reform likely weakened for both groups. As
18:589:46195:20:20:100:546:201:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a result, both the number of married men and the number of married women should have
18:590:46279:20:21:100:546:181:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:increased. It is unclear whether such an effect, if any, was stronger for men or women. It
18:591:46369:21:20:100:546:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is certainly possible that married men pursued more aggressive tax avoidance strategies prior
18:592:46462:20:20:100:546:140:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to the introduction of unlimited marital deduction and that therefore their reported wealth
18:593:46553:20:21:100:358:120:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:increased by more than the wealth of married women.
18:594:46604:21:16:117:546:99:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Looking at lower wealth groups may shed some light on the issue. Less wealthy use the
18:595:46689:16:0:109:422:83:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:A:23A possible explanation is that widowed women were more likely to remarry.
19:596:46766:0:20:100:546:729:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:marital deduction more extensively, see Figure 8, which would suggest that the 1981 changes
19:597:46857:20:20:100:546:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:had a stronger effect on their gender-marital composition. As figure 10 illustrates, the share
19:598:46951:20:21:100:546:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of married females in the remainder of the top .4% increased between 1976 and 1982,24with
19:599:47040:21:20:100:546:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:no similar effect for the share of married men, thus suggesting a stronger response for married
19:600:47135:20:20:100:546:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:women than married men. Given these patterns for the lower wealth categories, we suspect
19:601:47223:20:21:100:546:628:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that marital deductions cannot fully explain developments at the very top – the rise in married
19:602:47318:21:20:100:177:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:men specifically.
19:603:47335:20:20:117:546:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Another factor potentially influencing the gender composition of estate taxpayers is its
19:604:47423:20:21:100:547:567:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f11:B:graduation.  We would expect greater graduation to increase the tendency to splittaxable
19:605:47511:21:20:100:546:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estates when marital transfers were taxable (the case prior to 1948, and to some extent until
19:606:47604:20:20:100:546:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:1982).  One way of accomplishing this objective was by sharing wealth more equally while
19:607:47692:20:21:100:546:506:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:alive. Moreover, absent marital deductions, a couple aiming to maximize wealth holdings of
19:608:47782:21:20:100:546:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the surviving spouse should tilt assets towards the spouse who is more likely to survive. Both
19:609:47876:20:20:100:546:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of these factors would result in more women among the wealthy as the graduation of tax rates
19:610:47968:20:21:100:546:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:increased. Effective marginal tax rates for the estate in the top .01% were in fact increasing
19:611:48062:21:20:100:546:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:until the 1970s (driven by rates changes prior to 1945 and falling real value of thresholds
19:612:48153:20:20:100:546:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:due to inflation after that  (Kopczuk and Saez, 2004a, figure 10)) and stabilizing after that
19:613:48246:20:21:100:546:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:until 2001. Therefore, changes in estate taxation could have contributed to an increase in the
19:614:48340:21:20:100:546:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:share of women until the 1970s. Thus, the increase in the share of women in the early part is
19:615:48433:20:20:100:546:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:consistent with increasing graduation of the estate tax leading to a more even distribution of
19:616:48527:20:21:100:546:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:assets between spouses. However, graduation of the tax schedule cannot account for the later
19:617:48619:21:20:100:136:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:decline.
19:618:48627:20:20:117:546:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:For a number of reasons, however, it appears unlikely that marital deductions were the
19:619:48713:20:20:100:546:262:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sole driving force behind the fall in the share of women. First, while there was an increase
19:620:48805:20:21:100:546:242:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in married men in the top group, the lower wealth group saw no such increase. Arguably,
19:621:48892:21:20:100:546:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the lower wealth group was more affected. Second, evidence from the Forbes 400 list reveals
19:622:48983:20:20:100:546:201:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a strong link between the importance of inherited wealth and the fraction of women, both
19:623:49071:20:21:100:546:181:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:declining steadily in the last two decades.  Lastly, we should bear in mind the results for
19:624:49162:21:20:100:546:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:singles. Tax considerations have no direct implications for the frequency of observing single
19:625:49255:20:20:100:546:140:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:males vs. single females. Thus, the fact that evidence from the single population on the share
19:626:49349:20:17:100:546:120:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of entrepreneurs shows a similar pattern to that obtained from married couples (and widows
19:627:49439:17:20:109:546:103:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:24Note that P99.6-P99.99 contains 39 times as many individuals as top .01% so that the presence of individuals
19:628:49549:20:0:100:546:83:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:moving between P99.6-P99.99 and Top .01% has a minor effect on the gender composition of the larger group.
20:629:49657:0:20:100:546:729:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and widowers) suggests that changes to the tax code have not been the main factor driving
20:630:49746:20:36:100:289:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the share of women among the wealthy.
20:631:49783:36:20:100:546:673:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:B:Changing normsIt may be that what is considered a fair division of assets between spouses
20:632:49872:20:20:100:546:653:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:has changed over time. While this might explain the rise in the fraction of women seen in the
20:633:49965:20:21:100:546:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:1925-1969 period, it is less clear that it can account for the decline since, although the no-
20:634:50059:21:20:100:546:612:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:fault divorce revolution has been associated with negative economic consequences for women.
20:635:50150:20:20:100:546:592:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Assuming that women in the concerned group have more to lose from divorce, their bargaining
20:636:50241:20:21:100:546:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:position would have worsened, which would show up as married women owning a lower share of
20:637:50331:21:20:100:546:551:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:household wealth. However, the decline of women at the top of the wealth distribution seems
20:638:50422:20:20:100:509:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:driven not by married women but by widows, thus casting doubt on this explanation.
20:639:50504:20:21:117:546:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:While difficult to pin down, the lower wealth categories provide some evidence on changes
20:640:50593:21:20:100:546:490:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to what is considered a fair share. The reason is twofold. First, wealth distribution is more
20:641:50686:20:20:100:546:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:skewed than income distribution and therefore we would expect that at lower wealth categories
20:642:50779:20:21:100:546:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the bulk of wealth was not inherited. Thus, for a sufficiently low wealth category, self-made
20:643:50872:21:20:100:546:429:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:wealth will dominate. Second, at lower wealth levels, the wife’s entitlement is more likely to
20:644:50966:20:20:100:546:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:be a fixed share of household wealth than at higher wealth levels (where this share is likely to
20:645:51062:20:20:100:546:389:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:decline with wealth). For instance, in the much publicized divorce of the Wendts in 1995, the
20:646:51155:20:21:100:546:369:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:wife claimed 50% of the husband’s estimated 100 million dollar wealth but was only awarded 20
20:647:51248:21:20:100:546:348:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:million on the ground that this would be sufficient to maintain the standard of living she had
20:648:51342:20:20:100:546:328:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:grown accustomed to. In other words, the wife’s entitlement may only extend to consumption,
20:649:51433:20:21:100:546:308:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:not savings, and savings increase faster than consumption with household wealth.25Thus,
20:650:51520:21:20:100:546:287:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:asset allocation in the lower wealth group may provide some evidence on what is considered
20:651:51610:20:20:100:546:267:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a wife’s entitlement. If so, changes in the share of women beyond what would be indicated
20:652:51699:20:21:100:546:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:by the share of women in lower wealth groups might then be interpreted as caused by factors
20:653:51790:21:20:100:269:226:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:other than changes in social norms.
20:654:51825:20:20:117:546:206:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 11 shows the difference between the share of women in P99.6-99.99 and the top
20:655:51909:20:16:100:546:186:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:0.01%. The difference follows a U-shaped pattern. In the beginning of the period there were
20:656:52000:16:21:109:546:170:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:25The combination of the practice of awarding assets at divorce (and alimony) based on the notion that the
20:657:52106:21:16:100:546:149:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:financially weaker spouse (the wife) has a right to maintain the standard of living she has grown accustomed
20:658:52214:16:16:100:546:133:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:to, and the non-interventionist doctrine of leaving it up to the husbands (spouses after 1981, see Kirshberg v.

20:660:52434:17:16:100:546:100:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:McGuire v. McGuire, 59 N.W.2d 336 (Neb. 1953), suggests that a wife has an entitlement to a fixed share of
20:661:52540:16:0:100:219:84:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:consumption but not savings.
21:662:52570:0:20:100:546:729:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:more women in the lower wealth category, but the difference is falling rapidly and by the 1940s,
21:663:52666:20:20:100:546:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:there were relatively more women in the top group. This reverses in the 1970s. Since then,
21:664:52756:20:21:100:546:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the fraction women has held steady in the lower wealth categories and the difference is driven
21:665:52850:21:20:100:231:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:by fewer women at the top.
21:666:52876:20:20:117:546:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:This U-shaped pattern suggests that the rise and decline of the fraction women in the top
21:667:52965:20:21:100:546:628:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:group cannot be accounted for by changes in the norms governing allocation of assets between
21:668:53057:21:20:100:546:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:spouses.  The negative values for the 1940s through the 1970s is consistent with inherited
21:669:53147:20:20:100:546:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:wealth being (relatively) more important in the top group (unless wives in the top group
21:670:53235:20:21:100:546:567:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:received a higher share of wealth generated by husbands than wives in lower groups, which we
21:671:53327:21:20:100:183:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:find implausible).
21:672:53345:20:20:117:546:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:It should also be noted that daughters’ being allocated a greater share of estates may have
21:673:53436:20:21:100:546:506:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:contributed to the more rapid rise in the fraction of women in the top wealth group. While
21:674:53526:21:20:100:546:485:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:equal division of estates became the norm among the less wealthy already in the late 19th
21:675:53615:20:20:100:546:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:century, we know less about the very wealthy and it may be that they continued to favor
21:676:53702:20:21:100:546:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sons, albeit at a decreasing rate, well into the 20thcentury. One piece of evidence against this
21:677:53798:21:20:100:546:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is our Table 5 that shows that the rise in the fraction of women between 1900 and 1950 is
21:678:53887:20:20:100:546:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:driven by an increasing presence of inherited wealth, not by more women among those who
21:679:53974:20:21:100:546:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:inherit. Similarly, our Table 6 suggests that gender distribution of inherited wealth among
21:680:54065:21:20:100:546:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the wealthy, while not yet exactly balanced, was already approaching parity at the end of the
21:681:54158:20:20:100:546:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:19thcentury.26Furthermore, while wills of American presidents favored sons until Garfield
21:682:54247:20:21:100:546:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(1831 - 1881), subsequent presidents’ wills expressed no such bias, starting with Arthur (1829
21:683:54341:21:20:100:546:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:- 1886), (Betzig and Weber, 1995). Finally, we are not aware of any tendency since the 1960s
21:684:54433:20:35:100:287:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and onwards to increasingly favor sons.
21:685:54472:35:21:100:546:247:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:B:Divorce  and  remarriageEasier divorce could lead to fewer women in the top wealth
21:686:54554:21:20:100:546:226:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:category if the upshot were that wealthy men spread their wealth over more wives. There were
21:687:54646:20:20:100:546:206:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:two waves of divorce law liberalization in the last century. The first took place in the 1930s and
21:688:54744:20:21:100:546:186:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:involved a few states and Mexico (a “loophole” in the divorce law recognizing divorces filed for
21:689:54840:21:20:100:546:165:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:there). The second wave, the so called “no-fault” revolution, took place in the 1970s, following
21:690:54936:20:20:100:546:145:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:California’s removing fault grounds for divorce in 1969. Both waves of reforms are visible in our
21:691:55033:20:17:100:546:125:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:data (not shown). However, had the decline of women among the very wealthy been driven by
21:692:55122:17:20:109:546:108:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:26Fewer than 10% of women were listed as widows on this list, although as explained in the Appendix, this is
21:693:55230:20:0:100:207:88:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:an imperfect classification.
22:694:55260:0:20:100:546:729:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:serial monogamy on the part of men, we would have expected an increase in divorced women
22:695:55348:20:20:100:546:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the lower categories, something we do not observe. The rise in divorc ́ees attributable to the
22:696:55445:20:21:100:546:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:later wave is confined to the top group. While it is possible that divorc ́ees do not show up as
22:697:55541:21:20:100:546:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:such because of remarriage, we find it unlikely that remarriage would eliminate all traces of
22:698:55634:20:36:100:204:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:increased “polygyny.”
22:699:55655:36:20:100:547:612:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:B:Geographic  compositionAs mentioned, in eight (mostly western) community property
22:700:55736:20:20:100:546:592:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:states, all wealth accumulated during marriage is owned jointly by husband and wife by de-
22:701:55826:20:21:100:546:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:fault. Women are wealthier in community property states (for some years even wealthier than
22:702:55917:21:20:100:546:551:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:men), and it is thus conceivable that changes to the demographic composition of the wealthy
22:703:56008:20:20:100:546:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:affects the gender wealth distribution. A growing share of the wealthy living in community
22:704:56098:20:21:100:546:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:property states may have contributed to the nationwide increase in the share of women in the
22:705:56190:21:20:100:546:490:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:early period, although the share of women in top wealth groups grew in both types of states.
22:706:56282:20:20:100:546:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:However, geographic composition cannot account for the decline of women in the later period
22:707:56373:20:21:100:546:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:since that would have required a decline in the fraction living in community property states,
22:708:56466:21:43:100:312:429:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the opposite of what happened (not shown).
22:709:56508:43:20:117:546:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In sum, several factors may have contributed to the development of the share of women
22:710:56593:20:20:100:546:366:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:among the wealthy. The increase is consistent with a shift of the population towards community
22:711:56687:20:20:100:546:346:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:property states, increasing graduation of the estate tax, and changing social norms emphasizing
22:712:56782:20:21:100:546:326:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:economic equality between the sexes. However, these factors are unlikely to have played a role
22:713:56876:21:20:100:546:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the subsequent decline. The migration to community property states observed in the later
22:714:56967:20:20:100:546:285:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:period would predict a counterfactual increase in the fraction of women. The graduation of
22:715:57057:20:21:100:546:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the tax system did not change much in the later period, and while it is possible that women
22:716:57148:21:20:100:546:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:lost out in terms of intra-household bargaining power in the later part of the century, the fact
22:717:57244:20:20:100:546:224:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that women have not lost ground in the lower wealth categories is inconsistent with such an
22:718:57335:20:21:100:546:204:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:interpretation. Changes in the tax treatment of marital transfers may have played a role in the
22:719:57430:21:20:100:546:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:decline, in particular, the unlimited marital deduction introduced in 1981. However, evidence
22:720:57523:20:20:100:546:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from the population of singles, a group arguably unaffected by such changes, suggests that this
22:721:57618:20:0:100:221:143:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cannot be the sole factor.
23:722:57646:0:31:100:302:729:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:5  Summary and Discussion
23:723:57671:31:20:100:546:698:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:If men make but women inherit great fortunes, then the share of women at the top of the
23:724:57758:20:20:100:546:678:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:wealth distribution would reflect the relative importance of self-made over inherited wealth
23:725:57850:20:21:100:546:658:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and thus inter-generational wealth mobility. This is the interpretation we have given to the
23:726:57942:21:20:100:546:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:gender pattern found in estate tax returns data covering the period 1925-2000, where the share
23:727:58036:20:20:100:546:617:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of women among the very wealthy rose sharply between 1925-1945 to peak in the 1960s, and
23:728:58124:20:21:100:546:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:declined since; implying a U-shaped pattern for inter-generational wealth mobility over the
23:729:58215:21:20:100:159:576:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:last century.
23:730:58228:20:20:117:546:556:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We have presented several pieces of evidence supporting the link between the share of
23:731:58313:20:21:100:546:536:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:women among the wealthy and the role of inherited wealth. The marital-gender composition
23:732:58401:21:20:100:546:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of estates is consistent with a model of asset devolution where only men generate wealth but
23:733:58493:20:20:100:546:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:both men and women inherit. Moreover, data from A Classification of American Wealth show
23:734:58581:20:21:100:546:475:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that inherited wealth became increasingly prominent sometime in the late 19thcentury. While
23:735:58672:21:20:100:546:454:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:this series ends in 1950, the Forbes 400 series indicate a decline in both the share of women
23:736:58765:20:20:100:430:434:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and the share of inherited wealth since its initial publication in 1982.
23:737:58837:20:21:117:546:414:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The share of women among the very wealthy may also related inversely to technological
23:738:58922:21:20:100:546:393:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:change. In times of rapid technological change, self-made entrepreneurs displace old wealth.
23:739:59014:20:20:100:546:373:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:If the self made tend to be men, the share of women declines. By contrast, when technological
23:740:59107:20:21:100:546:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:change is more incremental, old fortunes prevail and as wealth at the top of the distribution
23:741:59200:21:20:100:359:332:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:becomes more dynastic, the share of women increases.
23:742:59252:20:20:117:546:312:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We have presented some evidence of an inverse relationship between between the share of
23:743:59339:20:21:100:546:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:women among the very wealthy and entrepreneurship from the IPUMS (the fraction of the
23:744:59424:21:20:100:546:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:workforce who are employers). We conclude with a fuller discussion of how our interpretation
23:745:59516:20:20:100:546:251:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of the evolution of the share of women relates to the literature on technological change and
23:746:59608:20:21:100:283:231:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the distribution of income and wealth.
23:747:59646:21:20:117:546:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Equating women with inherited wealth, entrepreneurship would have followed a U-shaped
23:748:59731:20:20:100:546:190:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:pattern over the past century. Such a pattern fits the timing of the so called second and third
23:749:59826:20:21:100:546:170:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:industrial revolutions. The period in which we see a rise in the share of women follows on the
23:750:59920:21:20:100:546:149:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:heels of a period of major inventions (electrification and the internal combustion engine) but
23:751:60014:20:20:100:546:129:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is itself not one. According to Jovanovic and Rousseau (2003, p. 419): “It seems to us that the
23:752:60109:20:21:100:546:109:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:periods 1890-1930 and 1971-2001 saw more creative destruction than the period 1930-1970.”
23:753:60198:21:0:100:546:88:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Thus, the initial rise in the share of women in the 1925-1969 period may be attributed to the
24:754:60293:0:20:100:478:729:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:passing down of fortunes generated during the “Gilded Age” (circa 1865-1914).
24:755:60370:20:20:117:546:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The IT revolution, with a start date in the early 1970s, coincides with the decline of
24:756:60456:20:21:100:546:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:women in our data.  One reason why inventions (as opposed to innovations) are likely to
24:757:60543:21:20:100:546:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:encourage entrepreneurship and generate new fortunes large enough to replace existing ones
24:758:60633:20:20:100:546:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:at the top is that rapid technological change renders existing capital obsolete and favors new
24:759:60727:20:21:100:546:628:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:firms (Greenwood and Jovanovic, 1999; Hobijn and Jovanovic, 2001). New firms, in turn, tend
24:760:60818:21:20:100:546:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to be more closely held, owned primarily by the entrepreneurs themselves. Thus, technological
24:761:60911:20:20:100:546:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:change may propel founders of firms that successfully adapt the new technology to the top of
24:762:61003:20:21:100:546:567:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the wealth distribution. If founders are primarily men, we would expect rapid technological
24:763:61094:21:20:100:546:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:change to result in the top of the wealth distribution being both more male and less “dynastic,”
24:764:61190:20:20:100:452:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and the share of women to rise in its aftermath as wealth is passed down.
24:765:61263:20:21:117:546:506:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Our hypothesis is also largely consistent with the fact that the fraction of women in the top
24:766:61356:21:20:100:546:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:wealth group moved in opposite direction of income inequality over the study period – if indeed
24:767:61451:20:20:100:546:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:spurts of economic growth coincide with the generation of new fortunes and greater inequality.
24:768:61545:20:21:100:546:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:While the increase in wage inequality since the 1970s has been linked to rapid technological
24:769:61637:21:20:100:546:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:change, e.g., Juhn et al. (1993), Katz and Autor (1999), there has been less focus to date on
24:770:61730:20:20:100:546:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the potential role of itsabsencefor understanding the decline in inequality in the 1930s and
24:771:61822:20:21:100:546:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:1940s, and continued low levels through the 1950s and 1960s (Galor and Tsiddon (1997) being
24:772:61913:21:20:100:546:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:an exception). Instead, macro-economic shocks such as the Great Depression, World War II;
24:773:62002:20:20:100:546:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:egalitarian social norms and — their possible expressions — policy measures such as income
24:774:62092:20:21:100:546:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and estate taxation, anti-trust legislation and the GI bill have been given more weight, e.g.,
24:775:62186:21:20:100:546:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Goldin and Margo (1992), Piketty (2003), Piketty and Saez (2003), Kopczuk and Saez (2004a).
24:776:62277:20:20:100:455:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:While norms are important, they may be viewed as endogenous outcomes.
24:777:62346:20:20:117:546:262:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Women as a proxy for old wealth complements the approach of Piketty and Saez (2003);
24:778:62430:20:21:100:546:242:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Piketty (2003) who have interpreted a high share of capital income to indicated the importance
24:779:62524:21:20:100:546:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of rentiers. Our approach has the advantage of not relying on the distinction between labor
24:780:62615:20:20:100:546:201:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and capital income, a distinction that may not be meaningful for business owners and may
24:781:62703:20:21:100:546:181:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:be sensitive to changes in corporate structure and taxation. If the question is whether the
24:782:62794:21:20:100:546:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:wealthy are thus because of their own industriousness, the gender wealth composition may
24:783:62882:20:20:100:201:140:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:shed additional light.
24:784:62904:20:21:117:546:120:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Our hypothesis that the share of women reflects the role of inherited wealth among the
24:785:62990:21:20:100:546:99:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:wealthy, and thus wealth mobility, is primarily a story about the top wealth brackets. For lower
24:786:63086:20:0:100:546:79:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:wealth brackets, the decline was absent. There are several possible explanations for this. In
25:787:63181:0:20:100:546:729:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:lower wealth categories, the wife’s entitlement is more likely to be a share of household assets
25:788:63277:20:20:100:546:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:than at higher wealth levels. Moreover, the wealth needed to enter, for instance, the top 1
25:789:63368:20:21:100:546:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:percent (corresponding to the richest 2 million adults) was “only” about one million dollars in
25:790:63463:21:20:100:546:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:2000 (2000 dollars), a net worth well within the reach of a small business owner or professional
25:791:63559:20:20:100:546:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:at the end of her life. Thus, the share of women may have been boosted by women’s greater
25:792:63648:20:21:100:546:628:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:incomes (directly and indirectly in the form of changes in the norms for asset allocation between
25:793:63745:21:20:100:546:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:spouses). Finally, while the share of women in the top 0.1 percent of the wealth distribution
25:794:63838:20:20:100:546:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:declined, women who dropped out of this category were probably still wealthy and likely to
25:795:63928:20:21:100:546:567:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:show up in neighboring wealth categories.  From 1976 to 2000, the wealth thresholds rose
25:796:64016:21:20:100:546:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:more in the higher wealth categories. This was especially true for the top 0.01%, where the
25:797:64107:20:20:100:546:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:wealth threshold rose by 13 million in 2000 dollars, while in wealth categories below the top
25:798:64200:20:21:100:546:506:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:0.4 percent, the increase was less than one million. However, this effect can only be modest
25:799:64292:21:20:100:546:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:considering the small size of the top group. In sum, the share of women in the lower wealth
25:800:64383:20:20:100:546:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:groups may have been sustained by a larger share of assets being jointly held (by spouses)
25:801:64473:20:21:100:546:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in lower wealth groups, women’s greater earnings, and, to some extent, a trickle-down from
25:802:64563:21:20:100:203:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:higher wealth groups.
25:803:64584:20:20:117:546:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, we propose a potential explanation for why wealth concentration remained constant
25:804:64674:20:21:100:546:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the past 25 years despite the surge in income concentration. Figures 2a and 2b show that
25:805:64765:21:20:100:546:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:wealth concentration declined in the 1970s. We speculate that this reflected the erosion of old
25:806:64860:20:20:100:546:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:wealth and that wealth concentration would have fallen further still if not for the inflow of
25:807:64953:20:21:100:546:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:new fortunes generated by the IT revolution in the 1980s and thereafter. There are primarily
25:808:65045:21:20:100:546:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:two reasons for why old wealth would decline. First, assuming that the old wealth dates from
25:809:65137:20:20:100:546:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the Gilded Age, dilution from passing down the generations (because of its spread over more
25:810:65228:20:20:100:546:262:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:people, estate taxation, consumption) would result in a reduction in wealth concentration.
25:811:65318:20:21:100:546:242:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Second, the decline in concentration in the 1970s is likely driven by the stock market which
25:812:65410:21:20:100:546:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:has been connected to the arrival of new technology and the period of “creative destruction”

29:878:69945:32:20:100:546:660:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Estate tax tabulations were performed on the confidential data available through the Statistics

29:880:70130:20:21:100:546:620:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:between gross estate and debts. Given the overall population and weights assigned to each
29:881:70219:21:20:100:546:599:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:observations, we tabulated the number of individuals by gender, marital status and marital
29:882:70309:20:20:100:546:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:property regime of the state of residence for the top 0.01%, P99.9-P99.99 and so on. Tabula-
29:883:70401:20:20:100:546:559:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tions for “decedents” use adult deaths as the population basis. Methodology for constructing
29:884:70493:20:21:100:546:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimates for the “living population” is identical as in Kopczuk and Saez (2004b), we review
29:885:70585:21:20:100:546:518:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:it briefly here and refer the reader to the extensive appendix in that paper for more detailed
29:886:70679:20:20:100:150:498:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:discussion.
29:887:70690:20:21:117:546:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The estate multiplier method relies on the assumption that decedents are randomly se-
29:888:70775:21:20:100:546:457:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:lected from the living population. Then, given the probability of dying bymi, a single estate
29:889:70868:20:20:100:546:437:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:observation stands for1miobservations. This is the weight that is attached to any given obser-
29:890:70962:20:21:100:546:417:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:vation. Implementing the method requires appropriate mortality rates. Mortality tables were
29:891:71053:21:20:100:546:396:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:obtained from the Human Mortality Database (www.mortality.org) and rely on the life tables
29:892:71143:20:20:100:546:376:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:constructed by the Office of the Actuary of the Social Security Administration (see Bell et al.,

29:894:71336:21:20:100:546:335:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:negatively correlated with socioeconomic status, the extent and trends in the mortality gra-

29:896:71517:20:21:100:546:295:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and adjust mortality rates for socioeconomic status using estimates of white college-educated
29:897:71610:21:20:100:546:274:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mortality differentials obtained by Brown et al. (2002). The extensive appendix in Kopczuk

29:899:71790:20:21:117:546:234:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We classify states into marital property regimes in 1970 following Gray (1998, Table 1).
29:900:71878:21:20:100:546:213:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:When splitting the sample by marital property regime, we exclude Wisconsin because this
29:901:71965:20:43:100:266:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:state changed its category in 1986.
29:902:72000:43:31:100:214:150:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:B  Census data
29:903:72014:31:21:100:546:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We rely on the IPUMS (Ruggles et al., 2004) data for 1920 through 2000 Censuses.  For
29:904:72099:21:20:100:546:98:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:self-employment and entrepreneurship calculations, we define our sample as those between
29:905:72187:20:0:100:546:78:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ages 18 and 65 who are in the labor force, excluding those living on farms. We rely on the
30:906:72279:0:20:100:547:729:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:variableclasswkr(Class of Worker) to determine self-employment status (this category includes
30:907:72372:20:20:100:546:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:values of self-employed, employer, working on own account, self employed not-incorporated and
30:908:72465:20:21:100:546:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:self-employed incorporated, with different subsets of these available for different Censuses).
30:909:72559:21:20:100:546:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:To classify individuals as employers, we use the “Employer” value for 1920-1940 and “Self-
30:910:72649:20:20:100:546:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:employed, incorporated” for 1970-2000. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that these values
30:911:72742:20:21:100:546:628:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are strictly comparable and therefore the level differences between values up to 1940 and those
30:912:72837:21:36:100:452:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:starting in 1970 for the employer variable should be treated with caution.
30:913:72911:36:27:100:189:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f18:C:Estimation ofb
30:914:72925:27:21:100:546:544:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We estimate the likelihood that the wife dies first by assigning to every individual in the IPUMS
30:915:73022:21:20:100:546:523:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a mortality rate based on gender, age and year. In the baseline calculation, we weight each
30:916:73113:20:20:100:546:503:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:married or widowed individual by the mortality risk. The total number of families with one
30:917:73203:20:21:100:546:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:spouse dying in a given year is obtained by adding up these weights, while the total number of
30:918:73297:21:20:100:546:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:such families in which woman was the-first-to-die is obtained by adding up weights for married
30:919:73391:20:20:100:547:442:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:females and widowed men. Our parameterbiis the ratio of the latter to the former. This
30:920:73477:20:20:100:546:422:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:procedure yields values ofbifor Census years and we use cubic spline to interpolate values in
30:921:73570:20:21:100:191:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:intermediate years.
30:922:73589:21:20:117:546:381:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The intuition for this procedure is as follows. Consider a universe of married couples whose
30:923:73681:20:20:100:546:361:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:members will be observed in the decedent population in the year they pass (a couple has two
30:924:73772:20:21:100:546:341:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:members until one of them passes and then one member until that person passes). Assume
30:925:73858:21:20:100:546:320:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:further that only one member of a couple dies in any given year (adjusting the mortality rate
30:926:73951:20:20:100:546:300:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for married spouses for the possibility of dying in the same year by assigning each of them a
30:927:74044:20:21:100:546:280:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:probability of 1/2 of dying first has a trivial effect). Then, we can estimatebi, the probability
30:928:74141:21:20:100:546:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that a wife dies first, by the number of couples in which the woman died first divided by
30:929:74230:20:20:100:546:239:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the total number of couples experience a death in any given year. The numerator could be
30:930:74318:20:21:100:546:219:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimated by adding the mortality rates for all married women and widowed men. To obtain
30:931:74406:21:20:100:546:198:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the denominator, we add to the numerator the added mortality rates for all married men and
30:932:74496:20:20:100:180:178:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:widowed women.
30:933:74510:20:21:117:546:158:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We considered two variations of this procedure. First, we corrected mortality rates using
30:934:74599:21:20:100:546:137:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:socio-economic mortality differentials as in Kopczuk and Saez (2004a).  Second, we linked
30:935:74688:20:20:100:546:117:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:records for spouses and corrected weights for the possibility of the two spouses dying in the
30:936:74781:20:21:100:546:97:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:same year by subtracting for each of them a half of the product of mortality rates of both
30:937:74871:21:0:100:546:76:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:spouses. Both of these adjustments had very minor effect onbiand no discernible effect on the
31:938:74966:0:20:100:546:729:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimates, the actual values we are using in the paper are based on the last approach. (We also
31:939:75061:20:20:100:546:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:repeated the same results by education and the results are very similar. However, education
31:940:75152:20:21:100:546:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:measures are available only starting with 1940.) The estimated values for the Census years
31:941:75242:21:20:100:546:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:were 39.6 in 1920, 37.4 in 1930, 35.1 in 1940, 32.9 in 1950, 30.3 in 1960, 28.9 in 1970, 27.3 in
31:942:75338:20:43:100:272:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:1980, 27.3 in 1990 and 30.4 in 2000.

31:946:75584:20:20:100:547:533:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f17:B:on first names. We proceed as follows. The Social Security Administration published (http:
31:947:75674:20:21:100:546:513:11:g_d0_f17:11:g_d0_f2:B://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/) list of 1000 most popular names for men and women (by
31:948:75758:21:20:100:546:492:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:decade) starting in 1900, with their frequencies. Some of the names show up both as male
31:949:75846:20:20:100:546:472:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and female names, we use them if they are much more common (when aggregated over the
31:950:75930:20:21:100:546:452:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:decades) for one of the genders (specifically, if the ratio exceeds eight). Both Forbes list and
31:951:76026:21:20:100:407:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the Classification contain indicators for having inherited wealth.
31:952:76092:20:20:117:547:411:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The New York Tribune applies to people alive in 1892 and therefore 20thcentury lists of
31:953:76179:20:21:100:546:391:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:names are an imperfect source of information. Furthermore, the list often includes only the first
31:954:76276:21:20:100:546:370:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:initial. On the other hand, the list often includes titles (e.g., mrs, miss, lady, mme, princess
31:955:76372:20:20:100:546:350:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:etc.) that are more informative than first names (e.g., the form of Mrs. John Smith is very
31:956:76463:20:21:100:546:330:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:common). It also includes short descriptions of the source of wealth that in many cases allow
31:957:76556:21:20:100:546:309:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for identifying gender (e.g., a person may be referred to as a “daughter,” “widow,” “niece,”
31:958:76648:20:20:100:546:289:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:or a phrase such as “left her,” “from her” and so on can be used). We use a simple pattern
31:959:76738:20:21:100:546:269:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:matching algorithm to identify all such cases and classify them as women. We supplement it
31:960:76828:21:20:100:546:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with matching on first names as described above, with classification based on the titles and
31:961:76920:20:20:100:546:228:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:description taking precedence (so that we do not mis-classify Mrs. John Smith). We assign
31:962:77009:20:21:100:546:208:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:individuals an inheritance dummy based on the description, again using pattern matching to
31:963:77099:21:43:100:285:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:identify phrases indicating inheritance.

32:992:77922:20:21:100:546:536:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are linearly dependent by construction, one of them is redundant, without loss of generality
32:993:78014:21:20:100:546:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:we ignore the last one. The independent variables in this model arebi,iandi2, and we are

32:1016:78816:31:20:100:546:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We estimate the system jointly using nonlinear least squares. Because the error terms are likely
32:1017:78912:20:21:100:546:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to be correlated, we account for it relying on the seemingly unrelated regression approach. This
32:1018:79008:21:20:100:546:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:procedure is straightforwardly implemented using “proc model” in SAS. We cannot exclude the
32:1019:79099:20:20:100:546:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:possibility of heteroskedasticity. For one thing, the number of observations varies over time
32:1020:79192:20:21:100:546:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:as population grows. Hence, our standard errors are based on heteroskedasticity-consistent
32:1021:79282:21:20:100:546:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:covariance matrix. Specifically, we use the conservative “jackknife” approximation suggested
32:1022:79374:20:0:100:514:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:by Davidson and MacKinnon (p. 554 1993) due to its good small sample performance.
