2:21:821:30:24:72:539:580:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Orson Wells made Citizen Kane, his greatest movie, when he was 25 years old; Frank Lloyd Wright
2:22:916:24:24:71:539:556:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:designed Fallingwater, his most famous house, when he was 70. Contrasts as great as this raise the
2:23:1014:24:24:71:539:532:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:question of whether there is a general explanation of when in their lives great innovators are most
2:24:1113:24:24:71:539:508:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:creative. For each of seven artistic disciplines, this paper examines a major innovation made by a
2:25:1211:24:24:71:539:484:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:very young artist, and another made by an old one, with the goal of understanding the role of the
2:26:1308:24:24:71:539:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:artist's age and experience in the accomplishment. The analysis shows why youth was necessary for
2:27:1405:24:24:71:539:436:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the innovations of such conceptual artists as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Arthur Rimbaud, Maya Lin, and
2:28:1501:24:24:71:539:412:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Orson Welles, all of whom produced their masterpieces before the age of 30, and why extensive
2:29:1594:24:24:71:540:388:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:experience  was  necessary  for  the  innovations  of  such  experimental  artists  as  Piet  Mondrian,
2:30:1697:24:24:71:540:364:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Elizabeth Bishop, Henrik Ibsen, and Frank Lloyd Wright, all of whom made major contributions
2:31:1789:24:24:71:540:340:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:after the age of 60. This paper demonstrates the generality of the distinction between conceptual and
2:32:1890:24:24:71:539:316:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:experimental innovators in artistic disciplines, and the value of the analysis in explaining the very
2:33:1991:24:29:71:436:292:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:different relationships between age and creativity for the two types of artist.

3:52:2743:13:28:72:533:533:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Recent research on important painters, poets, and novelists has established that there are 
3:53:2834:28:28:72:540:505:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:two different types of creativity, and that each is associated with a distinct life cycle of important 
3:54:2937:28:27:72:537:477:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:achievements.3 Conceptual innovators arrive suddenly at innovations based on new ideas. These 
3:55:3031:27:28:72:496:450:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:often constitute immediate and radical changes in basic conventions of their disciplines. 
3:56:3121:28:27:72:542:422:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Although these innovations can be made at any time, the most radical, and consequently the most 
3:57:3217:27:28:72:542:395:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:important, usually occur early in a career, when the artist has not yet become committed to habits 
3:58:3316:28:28:72:531:367:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of thought about the discipline, and is better able to perceive and appreciate extreme deviations 
3:59:3414:28:27:72:252:339:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:from existing methods and practices. 
3:60:3451:27:28:72:530:312:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: In contrast, experimental innovators arrive gradually at innovations based more heavily 
3:61:3539:28:27:72:533:284:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:on perception. Their major innovations normally appear piecemeal in increments, which are the 
3:62:3633:27:28:72:532:257:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:results of an extended period of trial and error. The greatest experimental innovations are based 
3:63:3731:28:27:72:535:229:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:on long chains of experimentation, and therefore usually emerge only after many years of work, 
3:64:3826:27:28:72:190:202:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:late in an artist’s career. 
3:65:3854:28:28:72:539:174:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: The purpose of this paper is to sharpen our understanding of this analysis by examining a 
3:66:3944:28:27:72:521:146:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:series of extreme examples of both types of creativity. These are drawn both from the artistic 
3:67:4039:27:0:72:502:119:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:disciplines that have already been considered in this regard and from others that have not 
4:68:4132:0:27:72:539:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:previously been studied. Examining extreme cases - of important innovations made very early or 
4:69:4227:27:28:72:502:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:very late in artists’ careers - can serve to spotlight the most basic differences between the 
4:70:4321:28:27:72:488:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:conceptual and experimental approaches. Doing this in a wide variety of activities can 
4:71:4408:27:28:72:519:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:furthermore underscore the most basic elements that are common to each of the two types of 
4:72:4499:28:28:72:129:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:innovation. 
4:73:4511:28:27:72:538:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: The conceptual innovations considered here were all made by artists aged 31 or younger; 
4:74:4599:27:28:72:542:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:one was produced by a poet at the age of just 16. The experimental innovations studied here were 
4:75:4696:28:27:72:527:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:all made by artists aged 58 and above; two were made by artists above the age of 70. All these 
4:76:4791:27:28:72:490:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:innovations were among the most important works of very important members of their 
4:77:4874:28:28:72:492:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:disciplines, and consequently most rank among the most important contributions to the 
4:78:4960:28:27:72:539:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:respective disciplines in their times. They include what many literature critics consider the Great 
4:79:5060:27:28:72:524:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:American Novel, and what most film critics consider the Great American Movie - indeed, the 
4:80:5151:28:27:72:208:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Greatest Movie Ever Made. 
4:81:5177:27:28:72:540:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: In every one of the following case studies, the goal is to understand the role of the artist’s 
4:82:5272:28:27:72:540:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:age, and career experience, in the accomplishment of the specific achievement selected. Thus for 
4:83:5369:27:28:72:538:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the conceptual innovators a basic question is how an artist so young can make such an important 
4:84:5465:28:28:72:532:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:contribution to a discipline: what characteristics of the innovation reflect the artist’s youth? For 
4:85:5566:28:27:72:535:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the experimental innovators, a basic question is why this late work is more important than most, 
4:86:5663:27:28:72:489:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:or all, of the artist’s earlier output: what about this innovation was aided by the artist’s 
4:87:5756:28:27:72:539:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:considerable experience? By asking these questions about these many individual masterpieces in 
4:88:5851:27:28:72:534:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:a diverse group of arts, we can gain greater insight into how age affects the production of major 
4:89:5949:28:0:72:158:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:artistic advances.

5:98:6339:14:27:72:528:560:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Piet Mondrian arrived in New York in October, 1940, after the windows of his London 
5:99:6423:27:28:72:505:533:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:studio were broken and the house next to his was destroyed by German bombs. Mondrian 
5:100:6508:28:28:72:532:505:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:painted in New York for the next 3 ½ years, until his death in 1944. He spent much of that time 
5:101:6604:28:27:72:518:477:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:working on a group of paintings he had started in Paris and London and brought with him to 
5:102:6695:27:28:72:522:450:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:New York, and he consequently began and completed only three new paintings while in New 
5:103:6783:28:27:72:542:422:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:York. The last of these, Broadway Boogie-Woogie, which he completed in 1943, is reproduced in 
5:104:6877:27:28:72:527:395:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:more textbooks of art history than any other painting Mondrian executed in his career of more 
5:105:6971:28:28:72:536:367:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:than 50 years.6 Remarkably, therefore, the last painting Mondrian completed, at the age of 71, is 
5:106:7069:28:27:72:421:339:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:considered by art historians to be the most important one he ever made.  
5:107:7142:27:28:72:537:312:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Mondrian’s goals for his art were both vast and imprecise. He wrote extensively, if often 
5:108:7232:28:27:72:502:284:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:incomprehensibly, about the purposes of art and the means of achieving them. Both were 
5:109:7319:27:28:72:526:257:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:influenced by Mondrian’s belief in Theosophy. Carel Blotkamp explained that Mondrian took 
5:110:7409:28:27:72:522:229:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:from Theosophy the conviction “that all life is directed towards evolution, and that ... it is the 
5:111:7508:27:28:71:538:202:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:goal of art to give expression to that evolution.”7 A key turning point in Mondrian’s art occurred 
5:112:7607:28:28:72:525:174:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:around the time of his move from his native Holland to Paris in 1912, when his recognition of 
5:113:7701:28:27:72:521:146:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the importance of Cubism led him to believe that abstraction could present a purer version of 
5:114:7795:27:0:72:506:119:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:reality, and consequently represent a more advanced stage of evolution. The aim of his art 
6:115:7888:0:27:72:530:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:became the creation of relationships between colors, and between shapes, that would transcend 
6:116:7982:27:28:72:129:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:naturalism: 
6:117:7994:28:14:144:428:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Pure abstract art becomes completely emancipated, free of 
6:118:8052:14:13:144:435:615:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:naturalistic appearances. It is no longer natural harmony but 
6:119:8114:13:14:144:441:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:creates equivalent relationships. The realization of equivalent 
6:120:8178:14:14:144:466:588:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:relationships is of the highest importance for life. Only in this way 
6:121:8248:14:14:144:429:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:can social and economic freedom, peace, and happiness be 
6:122:8305:14:14:144:196:560:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:achieved.8 
6:123:8315:14:13:144:147:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: 
6:124:8315:13:28:72:539:533:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Mondrian believed that artists could serve as leaders of society in moving toward these universal 
6:125:8413:28:28:71:526:505:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:goals. He recognized that the goals were distant, but he was patient: “he never rushed himself, 
6:126:8509:28:27:71:531:477:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:apparently convinced that evolution in art, as in the universe, was an extremely slow process.”9 
6:127:8605:27:28:71:539:450:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Mondrian’s working methods were explicitly based on intuition: “Pure intuition becomes 
6:128:8692:28:27:71:530:422:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:conscious through long culture and creates pure abstract art, which arises neither from intellect 
6:129:8790:27:28:71:529:395:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:nor from vague intuitive feeling.”10 Although his geometric compositions are often assumed to 
6:130:8884:28:28:72:398:367:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:be the result of calculation, he told a friend this was never the case: 
6:131:8956:28:13:144:444:339:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:I believe that it is possible by means of horizontal and vertical 
6:132:9022:13:14:144:467:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:lines, created consciously but not calculatingly, guided by a higher 
6:133:9091:14:14:144:467:312:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:intuition and brought to harmony and rhythm...  to arrive at a work 
6:134:9159:14:14:144:459:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of art which is as strong as it is true ... And chance must be as far 
6:135:9229:14:13:144:270:284:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:removed as calculation.11 
6:136:9254:13:14:144:147:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: 
6:137:9254:14:28:72:532:257:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The artist Harry Holzman, who financed Mondrian’s immigration to the United States and later 
6:138:9347:28:27:72:298:229:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:became his heir, confirmed Mondrian’s claim: 
6:139:9392:27:14:144:455:202:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:There was no program, no symbols, no “geometry” or system of 
6:140:9453:14:14:144:426:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:measure; only intuition determined the total rhythm of the 
6:141:9512:14:14:144:466:174:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:relationships, by trial and error. The given space of the canvas, the 
6:142:9582:14:14:143:403:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:given tension of its proportion, its size, were likewise 
6:143:9639:14:13:144:447:146:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:experimentally determined and varied. Intuitive experience for 
6:144:9702:13:14:144:402:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Mondrian could only be direct, immediate, sensual.12 
6:145:9754:14:14:144:147:119:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: 
6:146:9754:14:0:72:535:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: The criteria that guided Mondrian’s experimentation were aesthetic. An artist who knew 
7:147:9843:0:27:72:541:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Mondrian in Paris recalled watching him work in the 1920s: “if the black line was too thick, he’d 
7:148:9941:27:28:72:522:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:take a piece of white paper, or a paper of about the same color as the color planes next to that 
7:149:10038:28:27:72:542:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:line, and then he pasted it onto the canvas, and then held it at a distance to see ‘is the line the way 
7:150:10142:27:28:72:534:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:I want it or not.’”13 Similarly, a friend from his last years in New York explained that Mondrian 
7:151:10240:28:28:72:532:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:proceeded visually: “He tests each picture over a long period by eye: it is a physical adjustment 
7:152:10338:28:27:72:343:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of proportion through training, intuition, and testing.”14  
7:153:10398:27:28:72:532:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Mondrian’s art developed gradually over decades of experimentation. John Golding has 
7:154:10483:28:27:72:514:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:pointed out that from an early stage of his career he worked in series, indicating that he was 
7:155:10578:27:28:72:541:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:concerned with themes rather than individual motifs.15 Michel Seuphor recalled that although the 
7:156:10675:28:28:72:508:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:differences between two paintings might appear insignificant to a layman, Mondrian often 
7:157:10764:28:27:72:522:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:considered the changes significant: “‘Even so, it’s another step,’ he once said to a friend who 
7:158:10860:27:28:72:542:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:was studying a new picture of his, ‘or don’t you think so? Don’t you find that it represents even a 
7:159:10960:28:27:72:540:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:little step forward?’”16 Mondrian’s dogged persistence made the cumulative effect of these many 
7:160:11056:27:28:72:513:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:little steps very great. As David Sylvester reflected, “A Mondrian retrospective is not just a 
7:161:11151:28:27:71:513:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:procession of great pictures, but a progression which in itself is an aesthetic experience: the 
7:162:11247:27:28:71:525:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:trajectory of the man’s art becomes as much a thing of beauty as the art.”17 The observation is 
7:163:11343:28:28:72:505:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:apt, for Mondrian’s lifelong quest came to have a goal more complex than simply making 
7:164:11430:28:27:72:532:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:images. A scholar who recently studied a group of paintings that Mondrian executed during the 
7:165:11524:27:28:72:541:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:last decade of his life concluded that “Mondrian’s painting practice in New York seems to reflect 
7:166:11622:28:27:72:528:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:an accelerating doubt about whether it is possible, or even desirable, ever to finish a painting... 
7:167:11722:27:28:72:536:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Mondrian had not abandoned the idea of a product, just redefined it as a discovery or a solution, 
7:168:11820:28:0:72:534:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:not a painting.”18 Thus the painter Carl Holty wrote of visiting Mondrian’s studio in New York: 
8:169:11918:0:27:72:528:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:“Watching the pictures change into others as he worked, I asked him whether he wasn’t losing 
8:170:12011:27:28:72:534:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:good pictures in numbers because of his exigence. He said, ‘I don’t want pictures. I just want to 
8:171:12109:28:27:72:165:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:find things out.’”19 
8:172:12129:27:28:72:498:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Mondrian’s method of constructing his paintings involved extended revision and 
8:173:12208:28:28:72:536:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:correction, due to his uncertainty, but the geometric shapes and limited palette of primary colors 
8:174:12307:28:27:72:496:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:that made up his finished work are often taken to imply that his completed paintings are 
8:175:12396:27:28:71:501:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:impersonal and mechanical. So for example Clement Greenberg’s obituary of the painter 
8:176:12482:28:27:72:515:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:predicted that “Mondrian will be reproached for the anonymity with which he strove for the 
8:177:12573:27:28:72:540:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:ruled precision of the geometer and the machine in executing his paintings: their conceptions can 
8:178:12671:28:28:72:512:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:be communicated by a set of specifications and dimensions, sight unseen, and realized by a 
8:179:12762:28:27:72:531:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:draftsman.”20 A number of artists and critics denied this, however. John Coplans observed that, 
8:180:12858:27:28:72:483:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:particularly in Mondrian’s late works, “a very pronounced brushwork is an important 
8:181:12942:28:27:72:541:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:compositional element of his painting.” Coplans contended that in fact the surface of Mondrian’s 
8:182:13039:27:28:72:470:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:paintings subtly expressed the uncertainty and doubt that lay at the core of his art:  
8:183:13126:28:14:144:456:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Perfection and imperfection lie side by side within his paintings, 
8:184:13193:14:13:144:453:284:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:mutually contradicting one another - the razor-sharp edge of the 
8:185:13258:13:14:144:459:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:black lines contrasted against the suffused surfaces. This conflict 
8:186:13326:14:14:144:439:257:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:between means and ends transmits a psychic tension... [T]his 
8:187:13387:14:14:144:452:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:duality serves as a check against ritualization and virtuosity and 
8:188:13454:14:14:144:442:229:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:enables his work to transmit the drama of search and struggle 
8:189:13516:14:13:144:311:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:without making a spectacle of it.21 
8:190:13551:13:14:143:146:202:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: 
8:191:13551:14:28:71:476:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Mondrian’s artistic goals, practices, and extended progress identify him as a 
8:192:13629:28:27:72:520:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:quintessentially experimental artist. The key question is how this helps us to understand why 
8:193:13723:27:28:72:532:133:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:Broadway Boogie-Woogie emerges as his most important individual work. The answer appears 
8:194:13812:28:0:72:530:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:to be that in this late painting Mondrian combined a number of elements that he had developed 
9:195:13908:0:27:72:531:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and painstakingly refined over the course of more than 30 years with several bold new devices. 
9:196:14003:27:28:72:540:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Meyer Schapiro pointed out the elements of Broadway Boogie-Woogie that Mondrian drew from 
9:197:14093:28:27:71:507:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:his own earlier work: “We see again the stabilizing grid; the molecular scattered units; the 
9:198:14186:27:28:71:537:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:repeated arrays of primary color as in his Neo-Impressionist phase; and the composition of large 
9:199:14283:28:28:71:503:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:squares applied as separate planes of color.”22 All these components had first appeared in 
9:200:14374:28:27:72:499:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Mondrian’s paintings between 1909 and 1917. To these long-established elements of his 
9:201:14460:27:28:72:535:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:vocabulary Mondrian then added significant new departures. Thus in Broadway Boogie-Woogie 
9:202:14549:28:27:72:537:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:he eliminated the network of black lines that had characterized his work since his first encounter 
9:203:14648:27:28:72:531:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:with Cubism. As he explained to a curator, in 1943 he had decided that his use of black lines to 
9:204:14745:28:28:72:525:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:define planes constituted drawing rather than painting: “In drawing, the lines are the principal 
9:205:14842:28:27:72:527:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:means of expression; in painting, the color planes.”23 At the same time Mondrian introduced a 
9:206:14936:27:28:71:511:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:new illusion of three-dimensionality into his work: “At certain crossings of the grid, he has 
9:207:15030:28:27:71:474:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:extended the color of the square unit to a neighboring unit of one or the other band. 
9:208:15116:27:28:72:542:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Distinguished by this accent, one band seems to come forward in crossing its perpendicular.”24 In 
9:209:15214:28:27:72:520:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:contrast to the stable, architectural effects of his paintings of the previous two decades, in his 
9:210:15313:27:28:72:505:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:great late paintings Mondrian achieved new depth, dynamism, and movement. This was a 
9:211:15398:28:28:72:541:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:product of the wisdom he had gained through four decades of research, based on both a profound 
9:212:15493:28:27:71:530:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:knowledge of his craft and an understanding of the value of the willingness to experiment with 
9:213:15588:27:28:72:514:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:bold new changes: “at the age of seventy-one he was quite prepared to begin his artistic life 
9:214:15682:28:27:71:539:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:anew.”25 Both his expertise and his openness to new approaches were direct consequences of the 
9:215:15777:27:28:72:320:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:experimental nature of Mondrian’s approach to art. 
9:216:15828:28:0:72:519:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: In 1965, while he was a student at New York’s School of Visual Arts, Joseph Kosuth 
10:217:15914:0:27:72:534:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:made a work titled One and Three Chairs. It consists of a wooden folding chair, flanked on one 
10:218:16009:27:28:72:538:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:side by a life-size photograph of the same chair, and on the other by an enlarged photograph of a 
10:219:16107:28:27:72:527:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:dictionary definition of the word “chair.” Nearly four decades later, Kosuth is approaching the 
10:220:16203:27:28:72:534:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:age of 60, but One and Three Chairs remains by far his best-known work. A recent study found 
10:221:16296:28:28:72:529:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:that it is in fact the single work made by an American artist during the 1960s that is most often 
10:222:16394:28:27:72:533:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:reproduced in textbooks of art history.26 How did Joseph Kosuth produce a work this important 
10:223:16488:27:28:72:227:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:when he was just 20 years old?  
10:224:16520:28:27:72:537:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: In 1964, Kosuth decided that painting was dead: “It was my belief that painting had been 
10:225:16609:27:28:72:532:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:dried up, used up.”27 He later explained that painting had served to enrich the visual experience 
10:226:16707:28:28:72:528:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of people who lived prior to the 20th century, but that the development of modern technology - 
10:227:16802:28:27:72:539:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:movies, television, and transportation - had made this function obsolete: “The visual experiences 
10:228:16900:27:28:72:469:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of the modern day man make paintings impotent and pathetic trophies to forgotten 
10:229:16981:28:27:72:524:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:aristocracies.”28 For Kosuth, Marcel Duchamp’s innovation of the unassisted readymade - the 
10:230:17073:27:28:71:506:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:presentation of unaltered manufactured objects as works of art - had decisively shifted the 
10:231:17165:28:27:72:310:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:emphasis of art from appearance to conception.29 
10:232:17213:27:28:72:540:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: As a 20-year-old art student, Kosuth consequently decided that being an artist necessarily 
10:233:17304:28:28:71:526:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:involved questioning the nature of art. This could not be done using traditional means: “If you 
10:234:17400:28:27:71:523:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:make paintings, you are already accepting (not questioning) the nature of art.”30 He needed to 
10:235:17495:27:28:72:505:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:find an alternative means that emphasized conception and ideas rather than execution and 
10:236:17584:28:27:72:535:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:objects: “the artist’s duty is really to present new ideas - new ideas about what art is - not just to 
10:237:17687:27:28:71:540:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:make new works within the accepted framework.”31 Part of Kosuth’s solution to this problem lay 
10:238:17782:28:0:72:524:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:in the use of language: “I chose language for the ‘material’ of my work because it seemed the 
11:239:17879:0:27:72:502:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:only possibility with the potential for being a neutral non-material.”32 Another part of his 
11:240:17972:27:28:72:536:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:solution lay in using photography “as a non-art device as an alternative to painting within the art 
11:241:18072:28:27:72:515:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:context; I used photography in a way which was detached and indexed to the general use of 
11:242:18162:27:28:72:541:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:photography in the culture, rather than the craft of a ‘fine art’ of photography.” To emphasize the 
11:243:18262:28:28:72:542:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:insignificance of the craft of the photographic process, Kosuth never took his own photographs.33 
11:244:18359:28:27:72:533:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: One and Three Chairs was one of the first products of this combination of language and 
11:245:18446:27:28:72:514:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:photography. Each time it was exhibited, Kosuth would have a new photograph of the chair 
11:246:18535:28:27:71:517:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:taken in its new location. He explained that the change in the object was part of its meaning: 
11:247:18630:27:14:143:458:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:I liked that the work itself was something other than simply what 
11:248:18696:14:14:143:465:450:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:you saw. By changing the location, the object, the photograph and 
11:249:18762:14:14:143:463:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:still having it remain the same work was very interesting. It meant 
11:250:18830:14:14:143:440:422:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:that you could have an art work which was that idea of an art 
11:251:18892:14:13:143:451:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:work, and its formal components weren’t important. I felt I had 
11:252:18956:13:14:143:428:395:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:found a way to make art without formal components being 
11:253:19012:14:14:143:462:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:confused for an expressionist composition. The expression was in 
11:254:19077:14:14:143:465:367:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the idea, not the form - the forms were only a device in the service 
11:255:19146:14:14:143:208:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of the idea.34 
11:256:19160:14:13:144:147:339:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: 
11:257:19160:13:28:72:541:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Kosuth’s emphasis on avoiding “expressionist composition” places him squarely within a 
11:258:19247:28:27:72:531:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:movement that had begun a decade earlier, in which Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Frank 
11:259:19339:27:28:72:503:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Stella, Andy Warhol, and others had sought to create new forms of art that eliminated the 
11:260:19429:28:28:72:508:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:emotional and psychological symbolism of Abstract Expressionism, which had dominated 
11:261:19514:28:27:72:525:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:American art in the late 1940s and early ‘50s. Yet One and Three Chairs was among the most 
11:262:19605:27:28:72:528:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:radical attempts of the time to move art beyond physical objects into a more purely conceptual 
11:263:19700:28:27:72:541:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:realm. In doing this, it struck a responsive chord with many young artists who wished to separate 
11:264:19798:27:28:72:518:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:art from the commercialism of the market. As Kosuth later recognized, his early innovations 
11:265:19890:28:0:72:532:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:were part of a growing artistic protest against American society: “It is impossible to understand 
12:266:19991:0:27:72:535:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:this without understanding the sixties, and appreciate [Conceptual art] for what it was: the art of 
12:267:20091:27:28:71:542:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the Vietnam war era.”35 Kosuth’s work quickly affected other artists, as both the role of language 
12:268:20190:28:27:72:476:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and the use of photography became central elements of many of the most important 
12:269:20271:27:28:72:335:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:developments in fine art in the late 1960s and beyond. 
12:270:20326:28:28:72:541:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: As Kosuth grew older, his views of art became somewhat more nuanced, and he qualified 
12:271:20412:28:27:72:516:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:his youthful categorical dismissal of painting. Thus for example at a symposium in 1982, he 
12:272:20504:27:28:72:502:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:explained that “Actually, when I first described [painting] as dead I was a kid - and I was 
12:273:20596:28:27:72:523:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:projecting into the future.”36 But in fact it was apparently the confidence and simplicity of his 
12:274:20694:27:28:72:516:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:youthful view of art that allowed him to make the radical departures from traditional artistic 
12:275:20789:28:28:72:532:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:practices that gained influence with other young artists who were seeking ways to present ideas 
12:276:20885:28:27:72:537:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:without making conventional art objects. That Kosuth could produce a contribution to fine art as 
12:277:20982:27:28:72:535:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:influential as One and Three Chairs at such an early age was a result of his success at creating a 
12:278:21081:28:27:72:529:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:form of art that embodied a complex idea without requiring the command of traditional artistic 
12:279:21176:27:28:72:388:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:methods and materials that required extensive study and practice. 
12:280:21242:28:27:72:120:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Novelists 
12:281:21251:27:14:144:465:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Yes, that was and ever is my greatest torment - I never can control 
12:282:21319:14:14:144:461:257:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:my material. Whenever I write a novel, I crowd it up with a lot of 
12:283:21386:14:14:144:465:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:separate stories and episodes; therefore the whole lacks proportion 
12:284:21454:14:14:144:213:229:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and harmony. 
12:285:21467:14:13:288:439:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Fyodor Dostoevsky to Nikolay 
12:286:21496:13:14:288:421:202:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Strachov, April 23, 1871.37 
12:287:21523:14:14:72:75:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: 
12:288:21523:14:14:144:436:174:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:I want to write something new, something extraordinary and 
12:289:21582:14:14:144:368:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:beautiful and simple and intricately patterned. 
12:290:21630:14:13:288:438:146:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:F. Scott Fitzgerald to Maxwell 
12:291:21661:13:14:288:461:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Perkins, July, 1922, about his plans 
12:292:21698:14:14:288:405:119:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:for The Great Gatsby.38 
12:293:21721:14:0:144:147:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: 
13:294:21724:0:27:72:510:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: There is widespread agreement with the judgment of Edward Wasiolek that “When 
13:295:21802:27:28:72:531:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Dostoevsky completed The Brothers Karamazov in November of 1880 - less than three months 
13:296:21891:28:27:72:537:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:before his death - he was at the height of his creative powers.”39 There is also general agreement 
13:297:21990:27:28:72:542:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:that this final novel was Dostoevsky’s greatest achievement: Konstantin Mochulsky considered it 
13:298:22086:28:28:72:531:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:to be “not only a synthesis of Dostoevsky’s creative work, but also the culmination of his life,” 
13:299:22184:28:27:72:532:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and Sigmund Freud declared that “The Brothers Karamazov is the most magnificent novel ever 
13:300:22275:27:28:72:125:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:written.”40 
13:301:22286:28:27:72:537:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Why Dostoevsky produced his greatest work at the age of 59, in the final year of his life, 
13:302:22377:27:28:72:532:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:can be understood by an artistic examination of his artistic goals and the methods he devised to 
13:303:22474:28:28:72:502:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:seek them. Dostoevsky devoted his art, and his life, to a pursuit of the unattainable: W. J. 
13:304:22567:28:27:72:513:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Leatherbarrow observed that for him “truth was infinite, commensurate with the wisdom of 
13:305:22656:27:28:72:516:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:God’s creation, and the search for it was an unfinalizable spiritual - not merely intellectual - 
13:306:22753:28:27:72:528:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:quest.”41 The great novels of Dostoevsky’s final two decades presented a series of innovations 
13:307:22848:27:28:72:458:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:aimed at communicating this belief, and at gaining a deeper understanding of it. 
13:308:22929:28:27:71:500:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Mikhail Bakhtin argued that in these late works “Dostoevsky is the creator of the 
13:309:23011:27:28:71:494:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:polyphonic novel. He created a fundamentally new novelistic genre.”42 This innovation 
13:310:23097:28:28:72:540:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:constituted a new way to represent the indeterminacy and uncertainty of human life.43 In place of 
13:311:23195:28:27:72:528:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the single controlling voice of earlier novelists, Dostoevsky created novels with “a plurality of 
13:312:23293:27:28:72:512:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:independent and unmerged voices and consciousnesses, a genuine polyphony of fully valid 
13:313:23381:28:27:72:533:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:voices.”44 One consequence of this was that no single character became the organizing focus of 
13:314:23476:27:28:72:518:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the novel: thus “the work seems to oscillate between several possible novels, each somehow 
13:315:23567:28:0:72:517:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:intended by a different character. It is this peculiar plurality that creates that special sense of 
14:316:23670:0:27:72:453:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:palpitating contradictoriness we recognize as quintessentially Dostoevskian.”45 
14:317:23749:27:28:72:541:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Dostoevsky believed in free will: as one scholar explained, he believed that  “the future is 
14:318:23842:28:27:72:533:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:unpredictable not only because of innumerable casual factors but also because the past does not 
14:319:23938:27:28:71:539:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:wholly determine the present. It shapes, but does not make, our choices.”46 He employed a series 
14:320:24035:28:28:72:516:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of devices to avoid a narrative structure that presented a linear sequence of events, and in so 
14:321:24131:28:27:72:494:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:doing made them appear inevitable. The polyphonic novel was a means of allowing the 
14:322:24215:27:28:71:540:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:characters of a novel “to be truly free, capable of surprising not only other characters but also the 
14:323:24317:28:27:71:539:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:author.” Dostoevsky’s creative process was “designed specifically to provoke unexpected events 
14:324:24412:27:28:71:526:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:or ideas, and the process would be a failure if it did not produce them.”47 Bakhtin approvingly 
14:325:24508:28:28:71:315:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:quoted the analysis of the critic Victor Shklovsky: 
14:326:24560:28:13:143:462:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Fyodor Mikhailovich loved to jot down plans for things; he loved 
14:327:24625:13:14:143:463:395:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:even more to develop, mull over, and complicate his plans; he did 
14:328:24691:14:14:144:451:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:not like to finish up a manuscript... As long as a work remained 
14:329:24756:14:14:143:470:367:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:multi-leveled and multi-voiced, as long as the people in it were still 
14:330:24827:14:14:143:461:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:arguing, then despair over the absence of a solution would not set 
14:331:24894:14:13:143:167:339:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:in.48 
14:332:24899:13:14:144:147:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: 
14:333:24899:14:28:72:531:312:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Bakhtin observed that the same was true for individual characters: “As long as a person is alive 
14:334:24996:28:27:72:531:284:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:he lives by the fact that he is not yet finalized, that he has not yet uttered his ultimate word... In 
14:335:25099:27:28:72:522:257:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:[Dostoevsky’s] major heroes, ... the profound consciousness of their own unfinalizability and 
14:336:25193:28:27:71:542:229:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:indeterminacy is realized in very complex ways, by ideological thought, crime, or heroic deed.”49 
14:337:25290:27:28:72:539:202:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:In Bakhtin’s view, Dostoevsky’s plots were devised to make possible this open-endedness: “Plot 
14:338:25385:28:28:71:509:174:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:in Dostoevsky is absolutely devoid of any sort of finalizing functions. Its goal is to place a 
14:339:25480:28:27:72:518:146:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:person in various situations that expose and provoke him, to bring people together and make 
14:340:25572:27:0:72:539:119:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:them collide in conflict - in such a way, however, that they do not remain within this area of plot-
15:341:25675:0:27:72:268:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:related contact but exceed its bounds.”50 
15:342:25716:27:28:72:533:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Gary Saul Morson has observed that many novelists are surprised by the actions of their 
15:343:25804:28:27:72:515:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:characters, as the authors’ initial plans are disrupted by the developing personalities of their 
15:344:25901:27:28:71:525:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:actors. Yet he noted that most authors then revise their manuscripts to hide their surprise from 
15:345:25998:28:28:71:485:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:readers, often by rewriting earlier sections so the characters’ actions no longer appear 
15:346:26087:28:27:71:540:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:inconsistent. Dostoevsky specifically avoided doing this, for he wanted readers to see that he had 
15:347:26186:27:28:71:485:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:not determined his characters’ fate in advance.51 One way he did this was through the 
15:348:26272:28:27:72:512:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:serialization of his novels. He avoided planning his novels beyond the episodes that he was 
15:349:26364:27:28:72:524:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:currently writing. Once these were published, and unexpected developments appeared in later 
15:350:26456:28:28:72:526:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:installments, readers would see that the characters’ fate “was open or, rather, they had no fate. 
15:351:26554:28:27:71:541:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The work’s sections were to be understood as tending to no predetermined result, not as the mere 
15:352:26651:27:28:72:258:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:unfolding of a plan in several parts.”52 
15:353:26691:28:27:71:517:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: From at least the time of The Idiot, which he published in 1868, Dostoevsky avoided 
15:354:26775:27:28:72:538:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:predetermining the outcomes of his novels. Joseph Frank wrote that after Dostoevsky completed 
15:355:26869:28:27:72:518:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the first part of The Idiot, “it is clear from Dostoevsky’s notebooks and letters that he had no 
15:356:26966:27:28:72:528:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:satisfactory idea of how to continue the action. This uncertainty persists all through the middle 
15:357:27064:28:28:72:541:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:sections of the book, ... where Dostoevsky is obviously writing from scene to scene with only the 
15:358:27162:28:27:72:514:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:loosest thread of any central narrative line.”53 As Shklovsky observed, “Dostoevsky’s plans 
15:359:27254:27:28:72:496:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:contain by their very nature an open-endedness which in effect refutes them as plans.”54 
15:360:27342:28:27:71:526:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Dostoevsky’s point was to communicate through the very composition of his novels the belief 
15:361:27434:27:28:71:540:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:declared by one of his characters in The Idiot: “It’s life that matters, nothing but life - the process 
15:362:27538:28:0:71:485:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of discovering, the everlasting and perpetual process, not the discovery itself at all.”55 
16:363:27631:0:27:72:499:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Dostoevsky was a quintessential experiment seeker: as Malcolm Jones observed, 
16:364:27709:27:28:72:519:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:“Dostoevsky himself always insisted that the important thing was not the achievement of the 
16:365:27801:28:27:72:536:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:goal but the process of trying to reach it.”56 It is therefore not surprising that his greatest work is 
16:366:27905:27:28:72:539:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:valued for questions rather than answers: “The Brothers Karamazov matters not for its assertions 
16:367:28002:28:28:72:530:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and not for its denials but for its questions, to which there are no easy answers... Dostoevsky is 
16:368:28101:28:27:72:540:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:important because of the questions he asks about his society and about the beliefs held by men in 
16:369:28199:27:28:72:516:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:it, and above all because of his ability to dramatize the questions and show that they are real 
16:370:28295:28:27:72:113:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:ones.”57 
16:371:28303:27:28:72:530:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: That this greatest work came at the end of Dostoevsky’s career was not an accident, for 
16:372:28391:28:28:72:525:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:its greatness was a product of both his increasing technical mastery of his craft and his greater 
16:373:28489:28:27:72:531:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:insight into the human condition. Thus Mochulsky describes his earlier books as the laboratory 
16:374:28584:27:28:72:531:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:in which Dostoevsky developed the philosophical and artistic elements of Karamazov, with the 
16:375:28677:28:27:72:532:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:ideology taken from Diary of a Writer, the structure of the family chronicle from A Raw Youth, 
16:376:28772:27:28:72:519:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the conflict between religious faith and disbelief from The Devils, and the scheme of a novel 
16:377:28866:28:27:72:519:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:about a major crime from The Idiot. Similarly, Mochulsky traces prototypes of Karamazov’s 
16:378:28955:27:28:72:530:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:central characters to the earlier novels.58 And beyond these literary survivals, Karamazov drew 
16:379:29051:28:28:72:529:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:on Dostoevsky’s personal struggles, not only his long reflection on religious belief but also his 
16:380:29149:28:27:72:536:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:experience of tragedy. Thus early in 1878 Dostoevsky’s work on Karamazov was interrupted by 
16:381:29241:27:28:72:532:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the death of his three-year-old son Alyosha. In an attempt to assuage the writer’s grief, his wife 
16:382:29340:28:27:72:513:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:convinced him to visit the monastery of Optina Pustyn, where he met with the elder, Father 
16:383:29431:27:28:72:531:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Ambrosius. Dostoevsky used his vivid knowledge of a parent’s grief in his poignant account in 
16:384:29525:28:0:72:525:105:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:Karamazov of the devastation of a peasant woman at the death of her child, and Dostoevsky’s 
17:385:29620:0:27:72:520:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:wife believed that the words Father Zosima used to console the woman in the novel were the 
17:386:29711:27:28:72:514:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:same ones that Father Ambrosius had asked Dostoevsky to convey to her in sending her his 
17:387:29800:28:27:71:484:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f5:blessing after the death of their son.59 From his survey of the sources of The Brothers 
17:388:29888:27:28:72:496:602:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:Karamazov, it is consequently not surprising that Mochulsky concludes that “spiritually 
17:389:29976:28:28:72:517:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:[Dostoevsky] had worked on it his entire life... Everything that he experienced, thought, and 
17:390:30070:28:27:72:297:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:created finds its place in this vast synthesis.”60 
17:391:30120:27:28:72:530:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: F. Scott Fitzgerald published The Great Gatsby in 1925, when he was just 29 years old. 
17:392:30207:28:27:71:540:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Although the book initially met with a mixed critical reception, and its sales greatly disappointed 
17:393:30307:27:28:71:522:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Fitzgerald, since the writer’s premature death in 1940 Gatsby’s reputation has risen greatly.61 
17:394:30402:28:28:71:521:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Today not only is there a broad consensus that it is Fitzgerald’s best work, but many scholars 
17:395:30497:28:27:71:495:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:consider it to be one of the greatest novels ever written by an American.62 Over time, as 
17:396:30587:27:28:72:535:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:recognition of the magnitude of Fitzgerald’s achievement in Gatsby increased, the discontinuity 
17:397:30683:28:27:72:534:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:it represented in his career became clear. Thus in 1966 a scholar observed that “One of the most 
17:398:30780:27:28:72:504:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:difficult problems in Fitzgerald scholarship in the nineteen-fifties and sixties has been the 
17:399:30874:28:27:72:533:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f5:attempt to explain the sudden maturing of Fitzgerald in 1925, with the publication of The Great 
17:400:30970:27:28:72:542:271:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:Gatsby. Nothing in Fitzgerald’s earlier writing prepares for the authority and the aesthetic control 
17:401:31071:28:28:71:535:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:over material that is so impressive in his third novel.”63 Perhaps equally puzzling is Fitzgerald’s 
17:402:31171:28:27:72:539:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:subsequent failure to match the quality of Gatsby. Thus John Berryman observed that “Suddenly 
17:403:31265:27:28:71:538:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:he was able, not yet thirty, to lay out and execute a masterpiece. He was happily married, widely 
17:404:31363:28:27:71:497:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:admired, and had made money. One might have expected such a career of production as 
17:405:31447:27:28:71:379:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:American artists rarely have achieved. What happened then?”64 
17:406:31508:28:0:72:522:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Fitzgerald’s sudden rise and fall can be understood as consequences of the conceptual 
18:407:31597:0:27:72:542:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:basis of his best fiction, which used lyrical prose, simplified characters, and symbolic stage props 
18:408:31698:27:28:72:523:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and settings in the service of allegorical plots. So for example after Fitzgerald’s death, Lionel 
18:409:31796:28:27:72:511:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Trilling reflected that the significance of The Great Gatsby lay in the ingenuity of its form, 
18:410:31891:27:28:72:507:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:which derived from its “intellectual intensity.” He observed that the book’s characters and 
18:411:31983:28:28:72:429:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:settings were all simplified symbols used to serve the story’s central idea: 
18:412:32060:28:13:144:451:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the characters are not “developed”: the wealthy and brutal Tom 
18:413:32123:13:14:144:435:533:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Buchanan, haunted by his “scientific” vision of the doom of 
18:414:32183:14:14:144:467:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:civilization, the vaguely guilty, vaguely homosexual Jordan Baker, 
18:415:32250:14:14:144:438:505:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the dim Wolfsheim, who fixed the World Series of 1919, are 
18:416:32309:14:14:144:444:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:treated, we might say, as if they were ideographs, a method of 
18:417:32372:14:13:144:460:477:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:economy that is reinforced by the ideographic use that is made of 
18:418:32438:13:14:144:449:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the Washington Heights flat, the terrible “valley of ashes” seen 
18:419:32503:14:14:144:453:450:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:from the Long Island Railroad, Gatsby’s incoherent parties, and 
18:420:32567:14:14:144:402:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the huge sordid eyes of the oculist’s advertising sign. 
18:421:32623:14:14:144:147:422:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: 
18:422:32623:14:27:72:511:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f5:Trilling added parenthetically: “It is a technique which gives the novel an affinity with The 
18:423:32717:27:28:72:520:381:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:Waste Land.”65 T. S. Eliot himself appears to have appreciated the parallels between his own 
18:424:32810:28:27:72:491:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:poetry and the themes and techniques of Fitzgerald’s prose, for in 1925 he wrote to tell 
18:425:32899:27:28:72:509:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Fitzgerald that Gatsby “excited me more than any new novel I have seen, either English or 
18:426:32989:28:27:72:531:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:American, for a number of years,” and that he considered it “the first step American fiction has 
18:427:33086:27:28:72:526:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:taken since Henry James.”66 More recently, Richard Ruland and Malcolm Bradbury described 
18:428:33175:28:28:72:542:243:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:Gatsby as “a symbolist tragedy” told with “a symbolist mode of writing that informs everything - 
18:429:33272:28:27:71:408:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Gatsby’s dreams, parties, even his shirts - with an enchanted glow.”67 
18:430:33342:27:28:72:513:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Gatsby is elegant in both style and structure, and it is no surprise that lyric poets are 
18:431:33432:28:27:71:532:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:prominent among its admirers. When it was published Conrad Aiken called it “a highly colored 
18:432:33525:27:28:71:520:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and brilliant little novel which, by grace of one cardinal virtue, quite escapes the company of 
18:433:33621:28:0:71:521:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:most contemporary American fiction - it has excellence of form,” and two decades later John 
19:434:33716:0:27:72:540:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Berryman judged that “The Great Gatsby is in Chekhov’s sense a purely graceful book (‘When a 
19:435:33809:27:28:71:540:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:man spends the least possible number of movements over some definite action, that is grace’).”68 
19:436:33905:28:27:71:511:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Fitzgerald’s own confidence in his accomplishment similarly serves to identify Gatsby as a 
19:437:33996:27:28:71:518:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:conceptual breakthrough, for when he completed the book he wrote to his editor “I think my 
19:438:34087:28:28:71:339:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:novel is about the best American novel ever written.”69 
19:439:34142:28:27:72:542:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: The technical basis for Fitzgerald’s maturation in The Great Gatsby has been traced to his 
19:440:34233:27:28:72:538:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:newfound ability to distance himself from the story. Like his earlier books, Gatsby was based on 
19:441:34330:28:27:72:537:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Fitzgerald’s own experiences and feelings, but in Gatsby he used two specific literary devices to 
19:442:34428:27:28:72:532:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:achieve greater objectivity. One was what he called “composite characterization,” as Fitzgerald 
19:443:34524:28:28:72:500:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:explained that Jay Gatsby “started as one man I knew and then changed into myself - the 
19:444:34612:28:27:72:539:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:amalgam was never complete in my mind.”70 The second, which Fitzgerald apparently borrowed 
19:445:34703:27:28:72:534:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:from Joseph Conrad, was his use of an observer, rather than the author, as the book’s narrator.71 
19:446:34800:28:27:72:522:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Both devices allowed Fitzgerald to attain a feeling of greater objectivity in Gatsby than in his 
19:447:34897:27:28:71:498:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:earlier novels, and thus to give a more universal significance to his own experiences and 
19:448:34987:28:27:71:115:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:feelings. 
19:449:34997:27:28:71:523:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: The experience and feelings in question, however, were those of a young artist, and in 
19:450:35084:28:28:71:530:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:this lay the source of both the power of Fitzgerald’s achievement in Gatsby and his subsequent 
19:451:35179:28:27:71:537:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:inability to go beyond it.  Critics have long been aware that the strength of Fitzgerald’s vision in 
19:452:35280:27:28:71:528:188:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:Gatsby came from its youthful simplicity and clarity. Lionel Trilling observed that “A writer’s 
19:453:35376:28:27:71:528:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:days must be bound each to each by his sense of his life, and Fitzgerald the undergraduate was 
19:454:35471:27:28:71:537:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:father of the best in the man and the novelist.” Trilling remarked that Fitzgerald was perhaps the 
19:455:35570:28:0:71:537:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:last significant writer to believe in the Romantic fantasy of heroism, and commented that “To us 
20:456:35670:0:27:72:526:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:it will no doubt come more and more to seem a merely boyish dream.”72 Alfred Kazin agreed, 
20:457:35761:27:28:72:527:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:noting that “Fitzgerald was a boy, the most startlingly gifted and self-destructive of all the lost 
20:458:35861:28:27:72:532:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:boys, to the end.” As such, he was able to create a small world, clearly perceived: “Fitzgerald’s 
20:459:35959:27:28:72:496:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:world is a little one, a superior boy’s world - precocious in its wisdom, precocious in its 
20:460:36051:28:28:72:127:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:tragedy.”73 
20:461:36062:28:27:71:515:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: But Fitzgerald could not retain the simplicity of his vision throughout all of even his 
20:462:36150:27:28:72:511:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:relatively brief life. John Aldridge recognized this when he wrote that “Gatsby was written 
20:463:36242:28:27:72:514:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:during that fragile moment when the drive of youth meets with the intuitive wisdom of first 
20:464:36334:27:28:72:491:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:maturity, and before either the diseases of youth or the waverings of age begin to show 
20:465:36422:28:28:72:538:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:through.”74 J. B. Priestley appears to have had this same phenomenon in mind when he analyzed 
20:466:36516:28:27:72:504:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:what he called the two contrasting and opposed strains within Fitzgerald. The first, which 
20:467:36607:27:28:72:502:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:dominated his early work, was that of the optimistic and romantic adolescent who passed 
20:468:36695:28:27:72:518:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:through Princeton into the apparently unlimited opportunities of the 1920s, believing his life 
20:469:36790:27:28:72:531:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:would always be charmed. The second strain, a detached and cool observer who gained control 
20:470:36882:28:27:72:515:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:as the romantic boy withered in the face of disappointments and failures, was an adult artist-
20:471:36976:27:28:72:521:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:priest dedicated to his craft but lacking in exuberance. Neither strain alone could produce the 
20:472:37072:28:28:72:526:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:highest art, and Priestley believed that Gatsby was Fitzgerald’s finest achievement “because it 
20:473:37168:28:27:72:529:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:seems to me to represent the one point of balance between these two conflicting strains in him, 
20:474:37264:27:28:72:397:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the brief period when they were able to collaborate successfully.”75 
20:475:37332:28:27:72:530:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Interestingly, Fitzgerald appears to have understood not only the distinction drawn here 
20:476:37421:27:28:72:533:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:between conceptual and experimental artists, but also the difference in their creative life cycles. 
20:477:37521:28:0:72:534:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Thus late in his life, in giving advice to his daughter about how she should prepare for a literary 
21:478:37624:0:27:72:526:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:career, he wrote that “The talent that matures early is usually of the poetic, which mine was in 
21:479:37721:27:28:72:505:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:large part. The prose talent depends on other factors - assimilation of material and careful 
21:480:37814:28:27:71:521:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:selection of it, or more bluntly: having something to say and an interesting, highly developed 
21:481:37909:27:28:72:529:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:way of saying it.”76 His own explanation of the declining quality of his work after Gatsby does 
21:482:38005:28:28:72:524:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:not appear to have drawn on this analysis, however. Thus for example in 1929 he wrote to his 
21:483:38098:28:27:72:537:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:friend Ernest Hemingway that he believed that he had written too much in the five years prior to 
21:484:38195:27:28:72:524:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the publication of Gatsby, and that he had used up all his material: the three novels, dozens of 
21:485:38292:28:27:72:503:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:stories, and many articles and movie scripts “may have taken all I had to say too early.”77 
21:486:38383:27:28:71:310:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Elsewhere he offered a more poetic explanation:  
21:487:38432:28:14:143:434:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:I have asked a lot of my emotions - one hundred and twenty 
21:488:38491:14:14:143:454:422:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:stories. The price was high, right up with Kipling, because there 
21:489:38557:14:13:143:447:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:was one little drop of something - not blood, not a tear, not my 
21:490:38622:13:14:143:458:395:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:seed, in every story, it was the extra I had. Now it has gone and I 
21:491:38690:14:14:143:258:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:am just like you now.78 
21:492:38713:14:14:144:147:367:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: 
21:493:38713:14:27:72:504:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:From the vantage point of the present study, however, Fitzgerald was unable to match the 
21:494:38802:27:28:72:542:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:achievement of The Great Gatsby in the last 15 years of his life neither because he lacked subject 
21:495:38901:28:27:72:537:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:matter nor because he had used up his stock of some magical emotional elixir of artistry. Instead 
21:496:38999:27:28:72:529:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the source of his artistic decline may simply have lain in the inevitable impact of accumulating 
21:497:39096:28:28:72:522:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:experience and aging, for the growth over time in the complexity of his perception of the real 
21:498:39191:28:27:72:531:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:world deprived him of the ability to recapture the simplicity and clarity of the allegorical world 
21:499:39290:27:28:72:207:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:he had created in his youth.

21:503:39453:14:0:144:438:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:angels, carriages on the roads in the sky, a living-room at the 
22:504:39520:0:13:144:330:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:bottom of a lake, monsters, mysteries.

22:512:39919:14:28:72:538:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: André Breton, the poet and founder of Surrealism, considered Arthur Rimbaud the father 
22:513:40006:28:27:72:537:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of modern poetry.81 Remarkably, Rimbaud completed his career as a poet at the age of 19, when 
22:514:40100:27:28:72:534:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:he renounced literature; although he lived another 18 years, until his death at 37, he never again 
22:515:40199:28:27:72:538:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:wrote verse. Rimbaud had written what would become his most famous poem, “Le Bateau ivre,” 
22:516:40290:27:28:72:531:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:in 1871, when he was 16.82 A recent scholar called this “the first great Symbolist poem,” and it 
22:517:40387:28:28:71:499:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:has received considerable attention from poets as well as critics - among those who have 
22:518:40476:28:27:71:530:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:translated it into English, for example, are Samuel Beckett and Robert Lowell.83 These striking 
22:519:40572:27:28:72:532:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:facts about Rimbaud’s remarkable career dramatically raise the question of how he could make 
22:520:40665:28:27:72:380:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:so great an achievement so young, in such a brief span of time.  
22:521:40730:27:28:72:542:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Rimbaud grew up in the provincial town of Charleville, in northeastern France. He had an 
22:522:40819:28:27:72:513:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:unhappy childhood, and by his own account took refuge in imaginary adventures. He was a 
22:523:40907:27:28:72:536:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:brilliant student, and became a rebellious adolescent. At 15, with the encouragement of Georges 
22:524:41003:28:28:72:530:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Izambard, a young poet who was one of his teachers, Rimbaud began to write poetry. The next 
22:525:41095:28:27:72:527:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:year Rimbaud wrote two letters, one to Izambard, the other to another young poet, which have 
22:526:41188:27:28:72:529:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:become known as the “Lettres du voyant.” In them Rimbaud proposed nothing less than a new 
22:527:41278:28:27:72:487:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:theory of poetry. Edmund Wilson observed that this theory, “though more violent and 
22:528:41362:27:28:72:539:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:apocalyptic than most expressions of Symbolist doctrine, prophesied the advent of Symbolism.”  
22:529:41457:28:0:72:515:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Rimbaud believed that “one must be a visionary - one must make oneself a visionary.” This 
23:530:41550:0:27:72:525:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:would be achieved systematically through hallucination: “The poet makes himself a visionary 
23:531:41641:27:28:71:515:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:through a long, immense and reasoned derangement of all the senses.”84 By suppressing his 
23:532:41731:28:27:72:530:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:conscious senses, the poet would find a new voice. Thus Rimbaud declared that “It is wrong to 
23:533:41825:27:28:72:542:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:say: I think. One ought to say: I am being thought. I is Another.” Rimbaud effectively wanted the 
23:534:41923:28:28:72:538:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:poet to become the medium of an oracle, but rather than a divine oracle that spoke from without, 
23:535:42020:28:27:72:500:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:his goal was to find an oracle that came from within himself, the voice of the poet’s own 
23:536:42110:27:28:72:150:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:subconscious.85 
23:537:42125:28:27:72:516:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: “Le Bateau ivre” was the first major work based on Rimbaud’s new theory. Wallace 
23:538:42206:27:28:72:524:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Fowlie observed that it is “not only a successful poem in itself, it is the archetype of all future 
23:539:42306:28:28:72:541:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:work. It contains his principal themes, the order of his experiences, the evolution of his work and 
23:540:42406:28:27:72:504:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:his poetics.”86 The language of the poem literally describes the voyage of a drunken boat, 
23:541:42497:27:28:72:532:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:narrated by the boat, describing both its adventures and emotions, as it passes from servitude to 
23:542:42595:28:27:72:531:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:liberty, and finally to debilitation and disintegration. The poem is obviously allegorical, but the 
23:543:42695:27:28:72:479:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:symbolism is never clearly identified, and as a result there have been many different 
23:544:42781:28:27:72:529:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:interpretations of the poem.87 Like Rimbaud’s other poetry, “Le Bateau ivre” uses esoteric and 
23:545:42876:27:28:72:352:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:inventive language to produce vivid and complex images. 
23:546:42932:28:28:72:542:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: The greatest literary influence on “Le bateau ivre” was Charles Baudelaire, who Rimbaud 
23:547:43020:28:27:72:541:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:considered “the first seer, king of poets.”88 Yet Marjorie Perloff has argued that Rimbaud made a 
23:548:43118:27:28:72:500:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:key departure from Baudelaire. Whereas the symbolism of Baudelaire’s poetry remained 
23:549:43203:28:27:72:503:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:anchored to his perception of external reality, Rimbaud’s “Le Bateau ivre” was no longer 
23:550:43292:27:28:72:510:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:concerned with providing links between his images and the outside world, but instead with 
23:551:43382:28:0:71:510:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:recording the processes of exploration of his own consciousness. This would constitute the 
24:552:43476:0:27:72:542:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:beginning of a powerful force, not only in modern poetry but in the arts in general, by creating an 
24:553:43576:27:28:72:540:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:art based not on perception but on conception. The artists who would follow this practice include 
24:554:43674:28:27:72:535:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:not only many Symbolist poets but also many leading painters of the twentieth century: thus for 
24:555:43770:27:28:72:506:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:example Picasso declared that he painted not what he saw, but what he knew based on his 
24:556:43858:28:28:72:530:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:acquaintance with specific real objects. Yet Rimbaud’s departure was even more radical, for in 
24:557:43953:28:27:72:525:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:presenting directly the products of the poet’s subconscious Perloff observed that he advocated 
24:558:44048:27:28:72:506:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:using the poem “as language construction in which the free play of possible significations 
24:559:44139:28:27:72:538:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:replaces iconic representation.”89 Thus, perhaps for the first time, Rimbaud produced modern art 
24:560:44236:27:28:72:480:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:that was not based in any way on representation of actual or even possible objects or 
24:561:44322:28:28:72:528:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:experiences. Rimbaud’s belief in the autonomous use of language and images accounts for the 
24:562:44414:28:27:72:501:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:enigmatic nature of the symbolism of “Le Bateau ivre,” and the many contending critical 
24:563:44502:27:28:71:526:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:readings of the poem. It also accounts for Rimbaud’s choice of an ocean voyage as the central 
24:564:44596:28:27:71:402:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:subject of the poem despite the fact that he had never seen an ocean. 
24:565:44666:27:28:71:527:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: The importance of “Le Bateau ivre” thus appears to derive in large part from its role as 
24:566:44755:28:27:71:521:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the first embodiment of a radical new theory of poetry, a work executed by a self-proclaimed 
24:567:44848:27:28:71:523:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:prophet whose goal was not only to revolutionize poetry, but to inspire other poets to become 
24:568:44942:28:28:72:539:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:visionaries and change society.90 Anna Balakian has attributed Rimbaud’s ability to make such a 
24:569:45038:28:27:72:539:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:bold departure specifically to his youth: “At heart, the deviation that his poetry represents is akin 
24:570:45140:27:28:72:535:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:to the sensations experienced in childhood. Every child in his dreams plays that delightful game 
24:571:45237:28:27:72:542:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of creating a world which is as far removed from this one as possible, a world that becomes more 
24:572:45334:27:28:72:512:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and more absurd as his efforts to pass the limits of the known are increased.” For Balakian, 
24:573:45427:28:0:72:524:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Rimbaud’s poetry can be explained as a peculiar anomaly: “by a miracle - that imagination of 
25:574:45523:0:27:72:527:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:childhood, somewhat prolonged in him, was still his when he developed the philosophical and 
25:575:45615:27:28:72:541:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:verbal power which should have come much later, after that excessively imaginative impulse had 
25:576:45710:28:27:72:509:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:been attenuated.” This unlikely juxtaposition created in Rimbaud’s poetry “the only image 
25:577:45800:27:28:72:539:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:perhaps ever recorded of the world as seen through children’s eyes, a world wholly incompatible 
25:578:45896:28:28:72:197:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:with the age of reason.”91 
25:579:45922:28:27:72:519:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: After retiring from literature at 19, Rimbaud went on to a career as an adventurer and 
25:580:46009:27:28:72:537:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:sometime African trader in a variety of commodities, including contraband guns and slaves, that 
25:581:46105:28:27:72:528:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:would make him an inspiration for twentieth-century artistic rebels ranging from Henry Miller 
25:582:46199:27:28:72:509:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and William Burroughs to Bob Dylan and Jim Morrison. More remarkable than these later 
25:583:46285:28:28:72:500:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:escapades, however, was his ability to create new poetic forms, that would inspire major 
25:584:46374:28:27:72:530:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:twentieth-century movements in poetry and other arts, between the ages of just 16 and 19. This 
25:585:46469:27:28:72:536:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:ability was a direct consequence of the radically conceptual nature of his work, which combined 
25:586:46565:28:27:72:386:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the vivid imagination of a child with the verbal skills of an adult. 
25:587:46634:27:28:72:534:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Elizabeth Bishop published her first poems in a high school magazine at the age of 14.92 
25:588:46722:28:27:71:536:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Unlike Rimbaud, however, she continued to write verse in her 20s, and well beyond. In 1976, at 
25:589:46817:27:28:71:533:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the age of 65, she published “One Art,” which is the second most frequently anthologized of all 
25:590:46913:28:28:71:135:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:her poems.93 
25:591:46925:28:27:72:523:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Bishop’s poetry is celebrated for its visual qualities. Randall Jarrell wrote that “all her 
25:592:47017:27:28:72:529:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:poems have written underneath, I have seen it,” and Robert Lowell declared in 1969 that “I am 
25:593:47111:28:27:72:540:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:sure no living poet is as curious and observant as Miss Bishop.”94 Bishop herself told a critic that 
25:594:47212:27:28:71:530:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:“the settings, or descriptions, of my poems are almost invariably just plain facts - or as close to 
25:595:47312:28:0:71:518:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the facts as I can write them.”95 Her poems were crafted thoughtfully and painstakingly. In a 
26:596:47409:0:27:72:528:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:1947 review, Lowell described her poems as “unrhetorical, cool, and beautifully thought-out,” 
26:597:47503:27:28:72:516:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and called Bishop “one of the best craftsmen alive.”96 In a poem written for Bishop in 1973, 
26:598:47596:28:27:72:528:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Lowell compared her to the experimental painter Albert Ryder: “His painting was repainting, / 
26:599:47690:27:28:72:534:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:his tiniest work weighs heavy in the hand.” Ryder’s endless revision of his paintings, which left 
26:600:47788:28:28:72:512:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:them heavy from accumulated layers of paint, was Lowell’s analogy for Bishop’s extended 
26:601:47876:28:27:72:530:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:searches for just the right words to complete her poems: “Do / you still hang your words in air, 
26:602:47973:27:28:72:528:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:ten years /  unfinished, glued to your notice board, with gaps / or empties for the unimaginable 
26:603:48070:28:27:72:122:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:phrase.”97 
26:604:48080:27:28:72:531:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Another friend of Bishop’s, Marianne Moore, praised her poetry for its understatement: 
26:605:48167:28:28:72:525:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:“With poetry as with homilectics, tentativeness can be more positive than positiveness, and in 
26:606:48262:28:27:72:507:408:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:North & South [1946] a much instructed persuasiveness is emphasized by uninsistence.”98 
26:607:48349:27:28:71:521:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Bishop’s own statements of her goals often reflected her diffidence, as for example when she 
26:608:48442:28:27:71:542:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:told an interviewer that “I always try to stick as much as possible to what really happened when I 
26:609:48541:27:28:71:234:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:describe something in a poem.”99 
26:610:48573:28:27:72:532:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: The descriptive intent of her poetry, its visual nature, her careful craftsmanship, and her 
26:611:48665:27:28:72:507:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:tentativeness all identify Bishop as an experimental artist. A biographer recognized this in 
26:612:48758:28:28:72:488:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:observing that Bishop was “a poet whose method was her message.”100 Bishop herself 
26:613:48841:28:27:72:532:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:emphasized that poetry was not merely a part of her life, but her way of living: “Writing poetry 
26:614:48938:27:28:72:523:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:is a way of life, not a matter of testifying but of experiencing. It is not the way one goes about 
26:615:49037:28:27:72:366:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:interpreting the world, but the very process of sensing it.”101  
26:616:49102:27:28:72:532:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Like other great experimental artists, Bishop developed her art gradually. In spite of her 
26:617:49193:28:0:72:535:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:instinctual reticence, over time her poetry became more personal, and drew more heavily on her 
27:618:49291:0:27:72:534:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:own thoughts and experiences.102 Reading the openly autobiographical poems her friend Robert 
27:619:49384:27:28:72:529:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Lowell published in his landmark book Life Studies was one of the events that prompted her to 
27:620:49478:28:27:72:528:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:reconsider her own work.103 Thus in 1957, when Bishop was 46, in a letter to Lowell about his 
27:621:49572:27:28:72:533:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:new work she expressed her admiration for his achievement and frustration at her own timidity: 
27:622:49667:28:28:72:539:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:“Oh heavens, when does one begin to write the real poems? I certainly feel as if I never had. But 
27:623:49765:28:27:72:532:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of course I don’t feel that way about yours - they all seem real as real - and getting more so.”104 
27:624:49864:27:28:71:540:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Gradually thereafter Bishop’s own poetry became more autobiographical, and more assured. In a 
27:625:49958:28:27:71:528:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:review of a new volume of her poems in 1969, John Ashbery observed that Bishop’s work had 
27:626:50048:27:28:71:218:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:recently gained new maturity: 
27:627:50078:28:14:143:458:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Perhaps some of the urgency of the North & South poems [1946] 
27:628:50140:14:14:143:454:422:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:has gone, but this is more than compensated by the calm control 
27:629:50204:14:13:143:460:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:she now commands. Where she sometimes seemed nervous... she 
27:630:50264:13:14:143:435:395:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:now is easy in a way that increased knowledge and maturity 
27:631:50323:14:14:143:188:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:allow.105 
27:632:50332:14:14:144:147:367:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: 
27:633:50332:14:27:72:536:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Similarly, in a more recent review of Bishop’s career, Jacqueline Vaught Brogan concluded that 
27:634:50427:27:28:71:420:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:“Bishop’s verse matured as she did, so that her late work is her best.”106 
27:635:50501:28:27:72:530:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: “One Art” appeared in the last of Bishop’s books published during her lifetime. It takes 
27:636:50590:27:28:72:538:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the form of a villanelle, a 16th-century form made up of a series of three-lined stanzas and a final 
27:637:50691:28:28:72:504:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:quatrain, in which the first and third lines of the first stanza are repeated alternately in the 
27:638:50788:28:27:72:518:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:succeeding stanzas as a refrain, and together form a final couplet in the quatrain. Written ten 
27:639:50884:27:28:72:537:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:years after the suicide of Lota de Macedo Soares, who had been Bishop’s lover for more than 15 
27:640:50979:28:27:72:542:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:years, in “One Art” Bishop expressed both the enormity of her loss and her belief that the need to 
27:641:51078:27:28:72:494:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:write about it was the greatest source of her ability to bear that loss. Beginning with the 
27:642:51170:28:0:72:541:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:apparently innocuous statement that “The art of losing isn’t hard to master,” the poem effectively 
28:643:51272:0:27:72:540:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:portrays life as a series of losses, which grow as the poem proceeds, from trivial household items 
28:644:51371:27:28:72:511:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:to mementos, to houses, to cities, to continents, and finally to a loved one. The irony of the 
28:645:51466:28:27:72:528:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:opening statement grows with each repetition, as the increasing magnitude of the losses makes 
28:646:51560:27:28:72:524:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:them more and more painful to the author. The contrast between the rigid requirements of the 
28:647:51653:28:28:72:532:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:villanelle form and the poem’s intensely emotional subject serves to heighten the sense of pain, 
28:648:51750:28:27:72:520:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:for as the poem progresses the reader becomes increasingly aware of the enormous effort the 
28:649:51842:27:28:72:525:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:author is making to hold her emotions in check.107 In the poem’s final line Bishop violates the 
28:650:51938:28:27:71:520:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:villanelle’s strict form, interrupting the final refrain with a parenthetic instruction to herself - 
28:651:52039:27:28:71:521:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:“(Write it!)” - that underscores her recognition that it is only in producing her art that she can 
28:652:52138:28:28:71:512:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:endure her greatest loss. Bishop’s papers contain no less than 17 drafts of “One Art,” in the 
28:653:52232:28:27:71:480:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:course of which she not only searched for the right words, but carefully explored her 
28:654:52318:27:28:71:512:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:emotions.108 The poem reveals a mature artist subtly adapting a complex poetic form to her 
28:655:52409:28:27:71:540:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:purposes, firmly using the skill she has acquired over decades to help her understand and survive 
28:656:52507:27:28:71:528:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:her pain. The title of the poem implies that for Bishop her poetry and her life were one and the 
28:657:52604:28:27:72:103:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:same. 
28:658:52610:27:28:72:537:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: In a eulogy for a friend, Elizabeth Bishop wrote: “There are some people whom we envy 
28:659:52696:28:28:72:525:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:not because they are rich or handsome or successful, although they may be any or all of these, 
28:660:52791:28:27:72:532:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:but because everything they are and do seems to be all of a piece, so that even if they wanted to 
28:661:52889:27:28:72:541:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:they could not be or do otherwise.”109 The observation applies equally to Bishop herself, with the 
28:662:52988:28:27:72:522:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:integration of her life and art, and her consistent efforts to achieve “clarity and simplicity.”110 
28:663:53087:27:28:72:526:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The greatness of her late work was a consequence of her increasing technical mastery, born of 
28:664:53181:28:0:72:536:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:years of experimentation, combined not only with a growing understanding of her emotions, but 
29:665:53278:0:27:72:396:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:also a growing willingness to express that understanding in her art.

29:676:53794:14:14:144:147:505:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: 
29:677:53794:14:27:72:489:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: In 1891 Emile Zola, as president of the Société des Gens de Lettres, awarded a 
29:678:53873:27:28:72:535:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:commission to Auguste Rodin for a sculpture of the novelist Honoré de Balzac, who had been a 
29:679:53966:28:28:72:537:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f5:founder of the literary society. When Rodin finally completed a plaster version of his Monument 
29:680:54062:28:27:71:516:408:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:to Balzac, seven years later, he was 58 years old. He considered the sculpture to be his most 
29:681:54156:27:28:71:526:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:important work, "the sum of my whole life, result of a lifetime of effort, the mainspring of my 
29:682:54252:28:27:71:537:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:aesthetic theory."113 Yet when the sculpture was exhibited at the Salon of 1898 it caused a storm 
29:683:54350:27:28:72:541:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of protest by critics. The Société des Gens de Lettres voted to dishonor its contract and refuse the 
29:684:54451:28:27:72:518:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:statue, and a group of young artists actually plotted to vandalize it.114 Stung by the criticism, 
29:685:54549:27:28:72:532:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Rodin withdrew Balzac from the Salon, and moved it to his home outside Paris. The statue was 
29:686:54642:28:28:71:495:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:not cast in bronze until 1939, more than two decades after Rodin's death. George Heard 
29:687:54729:28:27:71:530:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Hamilton observed of Balzac that “the true originality of the work was reflected in the fact that 
29:688:54827:27:28:71:514:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:there were no proper words to confine it;” Alfred Barr described it as “one of the very great 
29:689:54921:28:27:71:315:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:sculptures in the entire history of Western art.”115  
29:690:54975:27:28:72:533:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Rodin's career developed slowly. His early failure in three attempts to gain admission to 
29:691:55065:28:0:72:530:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the prestigious Ecole des Beaux Arts caused him to spend nearly two decades as an assistant to 
30:692:55163:0:27:72:541:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:other sculptors, and he did not begin to enjoy real professional success until the age of 40. His art 
30:693:55265:27:28:71:529:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:also developed slowly. Rainer Maria Rilke, who worked for several years as Rodin's secretary, 
30:694:55359:28:27:71:536:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:observed that “his work developed through long years. It has grown like a forest.”116 The reason 
30:695:55456:27:28:72:500:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:for this was clear to Rilke, for he explained that Rodin's art “depended upon an infallible 
30:696:55548:28:28:72:538:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:knowledge of the human body” that he acquired slowly and painstakingly: “His art was not built 
30:697:55643:28:27:72:524:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:upon a great idea, but upon a craft.”117 It was not only Rodin's craft that grew slowly, but also 
30:698:55741:27:28:72:532:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:individual works: “I am unfortunately a slow worker, being one of those artists in whose minds 
30:699:55836:28:27:72:444:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the conception of work slowly takes shape and slowly comes to maturity.”118 
30:700:55911:27:28:72:517:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Rodin's experimental art was avowedly visual: “I strive to express what I see with as 
30:701:55997:28:28:72:533:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:much deliberation as I can.”119   Ideas did not precede, but followed, form: “One must never try 
30:702:56094:28:27:72:528:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:to express an idea by form. Make your form, make something, and the idea will come.”120 The 
30:703:56186:27:28:72:541:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:realism of Rodin’s figures was such that early in his career he was dogged by charges that he had 
30:704:56284:28:27:72:528:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:cast his sculptures from life. Infuriated by these rumors, he subsequently took care to make his 
30:705:56381:27:28:72:517:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:figures larger than life size. He did not work from imagination or memory, but always in the 
30:706:56474:28:27:72:542:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:presence of a model: he confessed that “I have no ideas when I don’t have something to copy.”121 
30:707:56570:27:28:71:524:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Unlike some sculptors who made figures that were intended to be seen only from the front, or 
30:708:56663:28:28:71:522:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:who might made a figure from a single front and single back view, Rodin created figures that 
30:709:56756:28:27:71:462:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:were to be seen in the round. His working process was iterative and incremental: 
30:710:56837:27:14:143:429:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: I place the model so that light, outlining it against a 
30:711:56893:14:14:143:444:174:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:background, illuminates the contour. I execute it, I change my 
30:712:56956:14:14:143:464:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:position and that of my model, and thus I see another contour, and 
30:713:57023:14:13:143:334:146:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:so on successively all around the body. 
30:714:57063:13:14:143:466:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: I begin again; I come closer and closer to the contours, and 
30:715:57124:14:14:143:211:119:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:I refine them. 
30:716:57139:14:0:143:467:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Since the human body has an infinite number of contours, I 
31:717:57201:0:13:144:437:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:multiply them as far as possible or so far as I think useful.122 
31:718:57265:13:14:143:146:671:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: 
31:719:57265:14:28:71:529:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Rodin’s awareness of the body’s infinite number of contours makes it unsurprising that 
31:720:57352:28:27:71:504:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:he often had difficulties with completing his sculptures. He was incapable of planning his 
31:721:57443:27:28:71:514:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:projects in advance, and usually began his works without any clear conception of their final 
31:722:57536:28:28:71:538:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:appearance.123 He admitted that “I often begin with one intention and finish with another.”124 He 
31:723:57634:28:27:72:523:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:often reached an impasse and put a work aside for a time: “I lay my work aside while it is yet 
31:724:57729:27:28:72:538:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:unfinished, and for months I may appear to abandon it. Every now and then, however, I return to 
31:725:57825:28:27:72:523:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:it and correct or add a detail here and there. I have not really abandoned it, you see, only I am 
31:726:57923:27:28:72:532:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:hard to satisfy.”125 Nor did this process always result in a successful outcome, particularly with 
31:727:58022:28:28:71:531:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:large and complex works that would have benefited from careful planning. Thus George Heard 
31:728:58113:28:27:71:515:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Hamilton voiced a common criticism of Rodin when he remarked that he was “not strictly a 
31:729:58202:27:28:71:509:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:monumental sculptor, for he had difficulty in imposing a formal unity upon many separate 
31:730:58291:28:27:71:141:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:elements.”126  
31:731:58306:27:28:72:536:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Rodin in fact became known, by some admirers as well as many detractors, as a sculptor 
31:732:58393:28:27:72:518:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of unfinished works. In 1889 Edmond de Goncourt criticized Rodin’s figures for incomplete 
31:733:58483:27:28:72:530:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:execution, and compared his sculpture to recent developments in painting: “Amidst the present 
31:734:58577:28:28:72:533:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:infatuation with Impressionism, when all of painting remains in the sketch stage, [Rodin] ought 
31:735:58673:28:27:72:503:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:to be the first to make his name and gloire as a sculptor of unfinished sketches.”127 Rodin 
31:736:58765:27:28:72:535:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:defended his fragmentary works against the charge that they were unfinished: “When my works 
31:737:58857:28:27:72:482:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:do not consist of the complete body ... people call it unfinished. What do they mean? 
31:738:58943:27:28:72:503:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Michelangelo’s finest works are precisely those which are called ‘unfinished.’”128 Rudolf 
31:739:59033:28:0:71:537:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Wittkower has argued that Rodin’s fragmentary sculptures were in fact finished: “The discovery 
32:740:59131:0:27:72:506:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:that the part can stand for the whole was Rodin’s, and Brancusi along with scores of other 
32:741:59222:27:28:72:508:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:sculptors accepted the premise. In contrast to Michelangelo, whose unfinished works were 
32:742:59311:28:27:72:523:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:unfinished, Rodin created partial figures which are the finished product.”129 Years of study of 
32:743:59407:27:28:72:530:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Rodin’s methods, however, led Albert Elsen to a different conclusion about both the fragments 
32:744:59501:28:28:71:512:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and the complete figures: “What now seems heroic and contemporary about Rodin is ... his 
32:745:59590:28:27:71:520:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:passion for the act of making rather than completing sculpture... His personal problem was in 
32:746:59684:27:28:71:523:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:setting for himself impossible absolutes of perfection toward which he dedicated a lifetime of 
32:747:59779:28:27:71:528:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:striving. It is doubtful that at his death he would have pronounced any of his works finished or 
32:748:59876:27:28:71:524:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:immutable.”130 Rodin himself recognized that he often sacrificed good works to the pursuit of 
32:749:59970:28:28:72:531:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:perfection: “Wishing to do better, one sometimes demolishes even what one has done well; but 
32:750:60063:28:27:72:325:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:one must be possessed by the demon of the best.”131 
32:751:60114:27:28:71:523:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Characteristically, Rodin produced the Monument to Balzac through a long process of 
32:752:60198:28:27:71:520:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:trial and error. Elsen’s analysis of the many works that made up this project prompted him to 
32:753:60292:27:28:71:528:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:observe that “One must look at the whole long series to see how slowly and naturally Balzac’s 
32:754:60386:28:27:71:528:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:posture and the position of his limbs evolved, rather than resulting from a sudden decision.”132 
32:755:60482:27:28:71:542:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Rodin failed to meet several deadlines for delivery of the statue, and on one of these occasions he 
32:756:60582:28:28:71:529:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:expressed his frustration: “As if it were possible, while one is searching, to be ready on a fixed 
32:757:60681:28:27:71:522:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:date!”133 Even when he finally delivered the work in 1898, Rodin would have liked to keep it 
32:758:60774:27:28:72:112:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:longer:  
32:759:60783:28:14:144:453:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:I should prefer to contemplate it every day for a while, and wait 
32:760:60849:14:13:143:466:146:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:until a sudden inspiration, such as occasionally flashes through the 
32:761:60918:13:14:143:463:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:brain, came to flood my imagination and enable me to perfect and 
32:762:60983:14:14:143:435:119:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:idealize my work. For a work, even when achieved, is never 
32:763:61042:14:0:143:465:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:perfect; it is always susceptible to a modification that can increase 
33:764:61115:0:13:144:208:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:its beauty.134 
33:765:61129:13:14:144:147:671:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: 
33:766:61129:14:28:72:537:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:            The            Monument to Balzac made striking use of Rodin’s central contributions to sculpture. 
33:767:61240:28:27:72:526:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Rodin wanted his sculptures to represent figures in movement, and he often animated them by 
33:768:61332:27:28:72:519:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:fixing transitory gestures and poses. Thus he portrayed Balzac not in formal dress or in quiet 
33:769:61427:28:28:72:533:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:reflection, but instead in the monk’s robe he wore while working, in a dramatic stance, his head 
33:770:61524:28:27:72:309:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:thrown back in a moment of creative inspiration: 
33:771:61573:27:14:144:471:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:By convention, a statue in a pubic place must represent a great man 
33:772:61641:14:14:144:441:505:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:in a theatrical attitude which will cause him to be admired by 
33:773:61704:14:14:144:452:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:posterity. But such reasoning is absurd. I submit there was only 
33:774:61769:14:13:144:455:477:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:one way to evoke my subject. I had to show Balzac in his study, 
33:775:61833:13:14:144:457:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:breathless, hair in disorder, eyes lost in a dream, a genius who in 
33:776:61901:14:14:144:464:450:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:his little room reconstructs piece by piece all of society in order to 
33:777:61972:14:14:144:427:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:bring it into tumultuous life before his contemporaries and 
33:778:62032:14:14:144:261:422:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:generations to come.135  
33:779:62057:14:13:144:147:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: 
33:780:62057:13:28:72:540:395:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Rodin was also concerned with creating atmospheric effects that would integrate his figures with 
33:781:62154:28:28:72:526:367:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:their environment. The jagged profile of Balzac, the deep cavities of the face and hair, and the 
33:782:62251:28:27:72:535:339:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:rough surface of the robe all created strong contrasts of light and shadow that called attention to 
33:783:62351:27:28:71:537:312:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the relationship between the figure and its surroundings. Throughout Rodin’s career he had used 
33:784:62447:28:27:72:527:284:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f5:subjects that were not conventionally beautiful, but in the rough treatment of the Monument to 
33:785:62542:27:28:72:530:257:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:Balzac he “created the first authentically ‘ugly’ work of modern art.”136 The effectiveness with 
33:786:62639:28:27:72:531:229:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:which Rodin combined these characteristic concerns and practices was a direct consequence of 
33:787:62732:27:28:72:520:202:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the maturity of this late stage of his career. As Rilke declared in tribute to his friend, “it is an 
33:788:62833:28:28:72:367:174:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:underlying patience in Rodin which renders him so great.”137 
33:789:62893:28:27:72:536:146:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Futurism was founded as a literary movement in 1908 by the Italian poet F. T. Marinetti, 
33:790:62982:27:0:71:517:119:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and the next year it was extended into painting, under the leadership of a young artist named 
34:791:63079:0:27:72:536:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Umberto Boccioni. In 1912 Boccioni decided to learn to make sculptures, and he devoted a year 
34:792:63173:27:28:72:523:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:to that art before returning to painting. World War I effectively brought Futurism to an end in 
34:793:63269:28:27:72:527:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:1916, and in that year Boccioni was killed while serving in the Italian army. John Golding has 
34:794:63364:27:28:72:502:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:observed that in its brief career Futurist visual art produced a single major masterpiece, a 
34:795:63457:28:28:72:536:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:sculpture by Boccioni titled Unique Forms of Continuity in Space.138 A recent survey confirmed 
34:796:63552:28:27:72:540:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Golding’s judgment, finding that this sculpture is illustrated in more textbooks of art history than 
34:797:63653:27:28:72:523:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:any single work by such great modern sculptors as Rodin, Henry Moore, Alberto Giacometti, 
34:798:63743:28:27:72:529:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and David Smith.139 Remarkably, therefore, although Boccioni’s total production of sculptures 
34:799:63837:27:28:72:540:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:has been estimated at just a dozen, one of these, which he executed at the age of 31, is among the 
34:800:63936:28:28:72:293:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:most celebrated sculptures of the modern era. 
34:801:63982:28:27:72:533:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Futurism was a conceptual movement from the outset. Marinetti stated one of its central 
34:802:64070:27:28:72:528:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:themes in his first Futurist manifesto in 1909 when he declared that “the world’s magnificence 
34:803:64165:28:27:72:503:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:has been enriched by a new beauty: the beauty of speed.”140 A central concern of Futurist 
34:804:64255:27:28:72:518:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:painting would consequently be the representation of motion. When Boccioni and four other 
34:805:64345:28:27:72:538:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:painters joined the movement, they explained that they wanted not to portray “a fixed moment in 
34:806:64441:27:28:72:517:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:universal dynamism,” but rather “the dynamic sensation itself”; to represent movement over 
34:807:64532:28:28:72:536:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:time, they intended to create visual syntheses of “what one remembers and of what one sees.”141 
34:808:64627:28:27:72:533:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: A central feature of Futurism was its self-consciously revolutionary attitude. Marinetti’s 
34:809:64718:27:28:72:534:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:founding statement in 1909 described itself as a “violently upsetting incendiary manifesto,” and 
34:810:64815:28:27:72:519:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the painters who joined him the next year opened their first manifesto with a declaration that 
34:811:64910:27:28:72:543:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:theirs was a “cry of rebellion.”142 A closely associated theme was the youth of the participants, as 
34:812:65011:28:0:72:532:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Marinetti’s first manifesto remarked that “the oldest of us is thirty, so we have at least a decade 
35:813:65114:0:27:72:444:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:for finishing our work” before they would be surpassed by younger artists.143 
35:814:65191:27:28:72:538:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: In a number of respects Futurism became a prototype for later art movements, perhaps as 
35:815:65279:28:27:72:532:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:much for its novel practices as for its art. Malevich and many other advanced artists learned the 
35:816:65377:27:28:72:492:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Futurist lesson that written texts could be a valuable tool in expanding the audience for 
35:817:65467:28:28:72:525:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:innovative conceptual art. In less than a decade Futurist artists produced dozens of pamphlets, 
35:818:65563:28:27:72:533:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:usually specifically titled as manifestos, on subjects ranging from poetry and painting to theater 
35:819:65662:27:28:72:496:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and film, and even to new forms of men’s clothing.144 Historians have observed that the 
35:820:65750:28:27:72:540:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Futurists’ publication of manifestos typically preceded the execution of the relevant works of art, 
35:821:65850:27:28:72:507:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and have remarked that this effectively made the manifestos blueprints for works of art.145 
35:822:65941:28:28:71:497:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Marjorie Perloff also made the observation that with this practice the Futurists made the 
35:823:66031:28:27:71:527:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:manifestos a part of their art: “to talk about art becomes equivalent to making it.”146 It appears 
35:824:66130:27:28:72:495:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:that the influence of Futurism was increased not only by the function of written texts as 
35:825:66220:28:27:72:506:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:supporting documents for works of art, but in some cases directly by the texts, even in the 
35:826:66312:27:28:71:536:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:absence of associated works of art.147 The texts could in fact have an impact even on artists who 
35:827:66410:28:27:72:531:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:rejected the Futurists’ art. So for example in 1912 Franz Marc wrote to his friend Kandinsky of 
35:828:66506:27:28:72:526:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the Futurists that “I cannot free myself from the strange contradiction that I find their ideas, at 
35:829:66606:28:28:72:514:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:least for the main part, brilliant, but am in no doubt whatsoever as to the mediocrity of their 
35:830:66702:28:27:72:124:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:works.”148 
35:831:66712:27:28:72:503:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: In 1909 Boccioni was an ambitious young painter working in a conventional Post-
35:832:66791:28:27:72:531:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Impressionist style when he met the dynamic Marinetti, who described himself as the “caffeine 
35:833:66885:27:28:72:534:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of Europe.”149 Marinetti inspired Boccioni, and proceeded to “drag him, technically unprepared 
35:834:66980:28:0:72:513:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and with a torrent of only partially formulated ideas, into the mainstream of modern art.”150 
36:835:67076:0:27:72:526:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Boccioni quickly adopted a highly conceptual approach to art. Thus he wrote to a friend that a 
36:836:67171:27:28:72:535:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:new painting was “done completely without models, and all the tricks of the trade are sacrificed 
36:837:67268:28:27:72:523:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:to the ultimate cause of emotional expression ... [T]he emotion will be presented with as little 
36:838:67365:27:28:72:376:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:recourse as possible to the objects that have given rise to it.”151 
36:839:67432:28:28:72:525:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Boccioni and the other Futurist painters aimed to portray motion as a dynamic process 
36:840:67518:28:27:71:541:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:that occurred and was experienced over time. They also wanted to represent the tendency of both 
36:841:67614:27:28:71:526:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:light and motion to destroy the concreteness of forms, thus emphasizing the interplay between 
36:842:67708:28:27:71:524:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:objects and their environment.152 Late in 1911 Boccioni spent a month in Paris, where he saw 
36:843:67801:27:28:72:539:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:new Cubist techniques that he quickly adapted to Futurist ends in his paintings.153 While in Paris 
36:844:67900:28:28:72:534:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Boccioni appears to have become aware that there was not yet a Cubist school of sculpture, and 
36:845:67995:28:27:72:526:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:that sculpture had consequently lagged behind painting in the development of advanced art. A 
36:846:68088:27:28:72:534:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:consequence of this was that he might make an immediate impact on the art world by extending 
36:847:68181:28:27:72:528:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the concerns of Futurist art to sculpture.154 In March of 1912 Boccioni wrote to a friend that “I 
36:848:68279:27:28:72:541:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:am obsessed these days by sculpture. I think I can perceive a complete revival of this mummified 
36:849:68376:28:27:72:534:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:art.”155 The next month he published a manifesto proposing a Futurist sculpture that would both 
36:850:68472:27:28:72:478:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:represent movement and portray the interaction of the figure and its environment.156 
36:851:68556:28:28:72:535:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Boccioni then began to make sculptures.157 In June of 1913 he exhibited 11 sculptures at 
36:852:68645:28:27:72:515:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:a Paris gallery. Guillaume Apollinaire’s review praised his achievement: “Varied materials, 
36:853:68737:27:28:72:534:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:sculptural simultaneity, violent movement - these are the innovations contributed by Boccioni’s 
36:854:68833:28:27:72:495:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f5:sculpture.” Apollinaire closed the review with a facetious reference to Unique Forms of 
36:855:68921:27:28:72:519:133:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:Continuity in Space: “Flash: We have been informed that Boccioni’s “muscles at full speed” 
36:856:69012:28:0:72:441:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:have taken to the road. As of this writing, they have not been recaptured.”158 
37:857:69093:0:27:72:541:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:            In            Unique Forms, the surfaces of an advancing figure are broken into parts, but instead of 
37:858:69207:27:28:72:537:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the straight lines and sharp angles of Cubism they have been transformed into irregularly curved 
37:859:69304:28:27:72:530:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:planes that blend together in a graceful composition. Their orientation and aerodynamic shapes 
37:860:69399:27:28:72:536:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:create forms that appear bulky and muscular at the same time that they seem to flow in response 
37:861:69495:28:28:72:522:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:to strong winds blowing in the face of the figure. In this sculpture Boccioni produced a novel 
37:862:69590:28:27:72:510:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:synthesis, drawing on plastic forms taken from classical Greek sculpture and techniques of 
37:863:69681:27:28:72:519:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:spatial organization borrowed from advanced modern painting, to create a three-dimensional 
37:864:69772:28:27:72:531:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:representation of the effects, in both vision and memory, of a combination of power and speed. 
37:865:69867:27:28:72:495:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:            Boccioni            considered            Unique Forms “the most liberated” of his sculptures.159 He 
37:866:69980:28:28:72:490:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:apparently gave up sculpting after he executed it, and Golding concluded that “with its 
37:867:70068:28:27:72:534:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:completion, Boccioni seems to have realized that he had achieved the definitive masterpiece for 
37:868:70164:27:28:72:529:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:which he longed.”160 Not only did Boccioni succeed in making a major contribution to modern 
37:869:70256:28:27:72:517:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:sculpture at the age of just 31, but he did it just a year after making his first sculptures. Even 
37:870:70355:27:28:72:538:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:then, he believed that he could have achieved much more, and at an earlier age, under the proper 
37:871:70452:28:27:72:539:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:circumstances. Thus when he reported to a friend Apollinaire’s praise for his 1913 exhibition, he 
37:872:70550:27:28:72:534:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:added that in spite of his excitement at his success, “I end up sad and discouraged. I think about 
37:873:70649:28:28:72:527:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:what I would have done by now if I had grown up with Paris or Berlin as my environment.”161

38:884:71224:14:28:71:530:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: A recent survey called Hedda Gabler “perhaps the most perfectly structured play of the 
38:885:71311:28:27:71:531:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:modern theater.”164 It was written by Henrik Ibsen in 1890, when he was 62 years old, and was 
38:886:71405:27:28:72:532:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:one of a series of plays that made Ibsen the preeminent dramatist of the late nineteenth century. 
38:887:71503:28:28:72:540:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Ibsen is commonly described as the founder of the modern theater.165 He is celebrated for 
38:888:71593:28:27:71:515:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the innovation of the realistic drama. Ibsen once explained that “My object was to make the 
38:889:71685:27:28:71:509:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:reader feel that he was going through a piece of real experience.”166 George Bernard Shaw 
38:890:71775:28:27:72:535:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:observed that when Ibsen began writing, the theater dealt largely with contrived situations, “and 
38:891:71873:27:28:72:529:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:it was held that the stranger the situation, the better the play.” Ibsen changed this: “He gives us 
38:892:71973:28:28:72:509:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:not only ourselves, but ourselves in our own situations. The things that happen to his stage 
38:893:72066:28:27:72:528:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:figures are things that happen to us.”167 In his first published article James Joyce had made the 
38:894:72164:27:28:71:517:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:same observation: “Ibsen has chosen the average lives in their uncompromising truth for the 
38:895:72256:28:27:72:251:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:groundwork of all his later plays.”168 
38:896:72294:27:28:72:540:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Ibsen achieved this realism by beginning with his characters: “Always I proceed from the 
38:897:72383:28:27:72:535:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:individuals; the stage-setting, the dramatic ensemble, all that comes naturally, and causes me no 
38:898:72481:27:28:72:534:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:worry, once I feel sure of the individual in every aspect of his humanity.”169 Once Ibsen had his 
38:899:72579:28:28:72:520:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:characters in mind, writing a play was a process of getting to know them, and he did this in a 
38:900:72674:28:27:72:151:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:series of stages: 
38:901:72692:27:14:144:442:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:As a rule, I make three drafts of my dramas which differ very 
38:902:72754:14:14:144:452:174:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:much from each other in characterization, not in action. When I 
38:903:72818:14:14:143:466:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:proceed to the first sketch of the material I feel as though I had the 
38:904:72889:14:13:144:459:146:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:degree of acquaintance with my characters that one acquires on a 
38:905:72954:13:14:144:433:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:railway journey... With the next draft I see everything more 
38:906:73015:14:14:144:462:119:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:clearly, I know the characters just about as one would know them 
38:907:73080:14:0:143:452:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:after a few weeks’ stay in a spa; I have learned the fundamental 
39:908:73148:0:13:144:462:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:traits in their characters as well as their little peculiarities; yet it is 
39:909:73224:13:14:144:468:671:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:not impossible that I might make an error in some essential matter. 
39:910:73292:14:14:144:456:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:In the last draft, finally I stand at the limit of knowledge; I know 
39:911:73361:14:14:144:461:643:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:my people from close and long association - they are my intimate 
39:912:73426:14:14:144:388:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:friends, who will not disappoint me in any way.170 
39:913:73476:14:13:144:147:615:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: 
39:914:73476:13:28:72:537:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Ibsen developed his characters during this process not only through their speeches, but also their 
39:915:73575:28:28:72:526:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:actions: “Many of the details occur to me during the process of composition, bit by bit as I get 
39:916:73672:28:27:72:536:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:along.”171 Their physical appearance could also change, for Ibsen had to visualize the characters 
39:917:73770:27:28:72:514:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:as he wrote: “To write is to see.”172 In view of the central role of characterization in Ibsen’s 
39:918:73867:28:27:72:518:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:process of composition, it is not surprising that Henry James would predict that Ibsen would 
39:919:73960:27:28:72:534:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:always be loved by actors: “He cuts them out work to which the artistic nature in them joyously 
39:920:74056:28:28:72:535:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:responds - work difficult and interesting, full of stuff and opportunity.”173 Just a few years later, 
39:921:74158:28:27:71:542:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:a leading actor confirmed James’ view: “It is easier, I think, to get inside the skin of an Ibsen part 
39:922:74261:27:28:71:518:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:than any other, for the simple reason that the characterization is so minute and elaborate, the 
39:923:74357:28:27:71:507:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:words are so full of suggestion, that the actor has infinite scope for the exercise of his best 
39:924:74453:27:28:71:136:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:qualities.”174 
39:925:74467:28:27:72:531:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: The primary importance of characterization points to the experimental nature of Ibsen’s 
39:926:74555:27:28:72:529:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:art, as does another central feature of his plays, their focus on change. Arthur Miller concluded 
39:927:74653:28:28:71:521:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:that “If his plays, and his method, do nothing else they reveal the evolutionary quality of life. 
39:928:74751:28:27:71:504:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:One is constantly aware, in watching his plays, of process, change, development.”175 Eric 
39:929:74841:27:28:72:542:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Bentley explained that this awareness was a product of Ibsen’s method of exposition: “Generally, 
39:930:74938:28:27:72:542:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:with Ibsen, we feel we are his companions in a search and therefore... are not given summaries of 
39:931:75036:27:28:72:514:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:what has been thought already but are present at the thinking.”176 In his major late plays the 
39:932:75131:28:0:72:524:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:endings were often not fully resolved, reflecting “a conception of life which Ibsen considered 
40:933:75229:0:27:72:534:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:more true than that represented by the stage convention of a conclusively happy or tragic end as 
40:934:75326:27:28:72:530:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the curtain falls.”177 Elizabeth Hardwick observed that in Ibsen’s late plays “His people are not 
40:935:75424:28:27:72:529:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:fixed. They are growing, moving, uncertain of their direction in life.” She traced this quality to 
40:936:75523:27:28:72:510:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:an uncertainty in the playwright: “We feel Ibsen himself created certain characters out of a 
40:937:75616:28:28:72:326:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:musing wonder and deep, intriguing uncertainty.”178 
40:938:75667:28:27:72:516:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f5: Ibsen developed his mature art in an extended series of major works, ranging from A 
40:939:75751:27:28:72:521:519:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Doll’s House (1879) and The Wild Duck (1884) through Hedda Gabler (1890) to The Master 
40:940:75838:28:27:72:525:491:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:Builder (1892) and John Gabriel Borkman (1896). All of these plays embodied his distinctive 
40:941:75930:27:28:71:528:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:innovations, including the use of discussion as a primary focus of interest, and the portrayal of 
40:942:76028:28:28:71:517:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:realistic characters, and actions, that had the effect of “making the spectators themselves the 
40:943:76124:28:27:71:532:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:persons of the dramas.”179 The plays’ subject matter directly treated major social issues of their 
40:944:76223:27:28:72:496:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:time. True to his experimental nature, Ibsen’s work did not change abruptly but evolved 
40:945:76311:28:27:71:540:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:gradually: “Ibsen chose the path of constant development ... Not the smallest fascination of Ibsen 
40:946:76410:27:28:71:460:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:is the unity of his work, the profound meaning in the relation of play to play.”180 
40:947:76493:28:27:72:511:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: No single play dominates Ibsen’s career, but Hedda Gabler was among his greatest 
40:948:76574:27:28:72:540:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:achievements. In a contemporary review, Henry James remarked that the study of an exasperated 
40:949:76668:28:28:72:535:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:woman would not have seemed a promising subject, but that the play demonstrated “the folly of 
40:950:76762:28:27:71:539:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:quarreling with an artist over his subject. Ibsen has had only to take hold of this one in earnest to 
40:951:76864:27:28:71:540:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:make it, against every presumption, live with an intensity of life.”181 For many critics Hedda was 
40:952:76963:28:27:72:504:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Ibsen’s greatest character; thus Harold Bloom declared that “What Anna Karenina was to 
40:953:77050:27:28:72:528:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Tolstoy, and Emma Bovary to Flaubert, Hedda was to Ibsen.”182 Elizabeth Hardwick observed 
40:954:77140:28:0:72:525:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:that “Hedda Gabler challenges and pleases and is the most fascinating, humanly interesting of 
41:955:77237:0:27:72:539:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Ibsen’s women. Actresses long to play the role.”183 John Northam explained that Ibsen’s success 
41:956:77333:27:28:72:533:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:in this characterization was a result of his subtle use of his full experience as a playwright: “our 
41:957:77434:28:27:71:520:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:informative details have been infinitely small, and ordinary; but they have been organized so 
41:958:77528:27:28:71:503:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:precisely, into patterns so self-consistent that through them we have become aware of the 
41:959:77618:28:28:72:539:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:development of a character whose main failing was inarticulateness... Through visual suggestion 
41:960:77714:28:27:71:539:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:we have come to know the stifling pressures and the fierce reaction... We have been reached, not 
41:961:77811:27:28:71:532:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:by the novelist’s techniques operating solely through the mind, but through the eyes; never was 
41:962:77907:28:27:72:475:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Ibsen more a practicing playwright than he was when he created Hedda Gabler.”184 
41:963:77987:27:28:72:534:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Ibsen’s innovations made his plays extremely controversial in his own time. The loudest 
41:964:78075:28:28:72:539:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:complaints came from those who believed that the theater should provide amusing entertainment 
41:965:78169:28:27:72:494:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:in ways that would not challenge prevailing social values. These complaints most often 
41:966:78256:27:28:72:511:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:denounced the ugliness of Ibsen’s subjects. So for example one London critic declared that 
41:967:78347:28:27:72:522:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:“Hedda Gabler is the study of a malicious woman of evil instincts, jealous, treacherous, cold-
41:968:78441:27:28:71:537:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:hearted, and, as it seems to us, wholly out of place on the stage,” while another reflected that “to 
41:969:78542:28:27:71:527:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:conceive of the Ibsen drama gaining an extensive or permanent foothold on the stage is hardly 
41:970:78636:27:28:72:514:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:possible. Playgoing would then cease to be an amusement and become a penance.”185 Other 
41:971:78724:28:28:72:533:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:critics complained that their evening’s entertainment lacked any edifying resolution: “If [Ibsen] 
41:972:78822:28:27:72:536:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:is a prophet, he is one who has no mission, no message to give us ... He only puts the destroying 
41:973:78920:27:28:72:530:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:question; never does he furnish even a hint of the saving answer.”186 Yet to many young artists 
41:974:79016:28:27:72:514:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Ibsen’s dramas were intensely exciting, as they laid the foundations for a theater that would 
41:975:79110:27:28:72:524:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:explore important social and psychological problems, and in so doing become a more integral 
41:976:79202:28:0:72:502:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:part of modern intellectual life. In recognition of this Luigi Pirandello, one of the leading 
42:977:79299:0:27:72:524:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:playwrights of the next generation, declared that “After Shakespeare, without hesitation, I put 
42:978:79395:27:28:72:146:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Ibsen first.”187  
42:979:79413:28:27:72:526:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: In 1961, a critic named Martin Esslin published a book defining a movement he called 
42:980:79498:27:28:72:539:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the Theater of the Absurd, which included such playwrights as Samuel Beckett, Eugène Ionesco, 
42:981:79592:28:28:71:540:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Jean Genet, and Harold Pinter. Esslin declared that this theater “strives to express its sense of the 
42:982:79694:28:27:71:526:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:senselessness of the human condition and the inadequacy of the rational approach by the open 
42:983:79787:27:28:71:514:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:abandonment of rational devices and discursive thought.” Esslin dated the beginning of this 
42:984:79879:28:27:71:530:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:movement very precisely, to the evening of December 10, 1896, when a Paris theater company 
42:985:79970:27:28:71:350:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:first presented Ubu Roi, a play written by Alfred Jarry.188 
42:986:80029:28:28:72:538:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Jarry was 23 years old when Ubu Roi opened in Paris. The origins of the work went back 
42:987:80116:28:27:72:540:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:eight years, to when the 15-year-old Jarry and two school friends in a provincial lycée first wrote 
42:988:80216:27:28:72:516:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:a puppet play about their physics teacher. The obese and incompetent teacher had long been 
42:989:80307:28:27:72:513:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:ridiculed by his students, and Jarry and his friends drew on a rich oral tradition in satirizing 
42:990:80404:27:28:72:528:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Monsieur Hébert, whose name had variously been transformed into Heb, Hébé, and eventually 
42:991:80494:28:27:72:509:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Ubu. Unlike his classmates, Jarry persisted in developing the epic history of the imaginary 
42:992:80586:27:28:72:285:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:adventures of Ubu even after he left school. 
42:993:80631:28:28:72:538:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: At 17 Jarry moved to Paris, where he soon abandoned his plans to attend college in favor 
42:994:80720:28:27:72:519:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of becoming a writer. He became part of a literary group that included the leading Symbolist 
42:995:80813:27:28:72:537:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:poets and novelists of the time, and began to publish stories about Ubu and his supposed science 
42:996:80910:28:27:72:489:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of “ ́Pataphysicks.” Although Jarry’s language was often bombastic, he in fact worked 
42:997:80996:27:28:72:346:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:methodically in developing  ́Pataphysicks into a system: 
42:998:81053:28:0:144:461:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: ́Pataphysicks is the science of the realm beyond metaphysics... It 
43:999:81124:0:13:144:458:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:will study the laws which govern exceptions and will explain the 
43:1000:81189:13:14:144:323:671:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:universe supplementary to this one... 
43:1001:81227:14:14:144:437:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Definition:  ́Pataphysicks is the science of imaginary 
43:1002:81282:14:14:144:205:643:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:solutions.189 
43:1003:81295:14:14:144:147:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: 
43:1004:81295:14:27:72:532:615:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Jarry wanted to create a theater purely of the imagination, that made no appeal to facts or logic. 
43:1005:81394:27:28:72:510:588:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:As a recent biographer explained, in Jarry’s conception “theater should imitate the logic of 
43:1006:81487:28:27:72:524:560:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:dreams, and should therefore employ symbolism, condensation, disconnection of images, and 
43:1007:81577:27:28:72:497:533:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:displacement; it should have an elusive, ephemeral and haunting quality.”190  
43:1008:81655:28:28:72:520:505:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:            In            Ubu Roi, the greedy and cowardly Ubu becomes King of Poland, tortures and kills 
43:1009:81761:28:27:72:521:477:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:many of his subjects, and is ultimately chased out of the country. The monstrous character of 
43:1010:81855:27:28:72:524:450:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Ubu drew liberally upon that of Falstaff and the inspiration of Rabelais, and the staging of the 
43:1011:81952:28:27:72:542:422:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:play was based on the marionette forms in which Jarry had first performed it. When Ubu Roi was 
43:1012:82047:27:28:72:528:395:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:first presented to the public in 1896, the play had been widely advertised and its opening night 
43:1013:82144:28:28:72:529:367:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:was attended by many of Paris’ leading critics and eminent literary figures. Controversy began 
43:1014:82239:28:27:72:528:339:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:immediately. When the curtain was raised, the actor portraying the gross Ubu stepped forward 
43:1015:82332:27:28:72:517:312:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and spoke his first line, a common obscenity that Jarry had appropriated to  ́Pataphysicks by 
43:1016:82426:28:27:72:504:284:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:adding a single letter. The audience erupted into shouting, whistling, and even fighting as 
43:1017:82518:27:28:72:522:257:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:admirers and detractors expressed their approval, shock, and anger. The actors had to wait 15 
43:1018:82612:28:27:72:540:229:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:minutes before the play could resume, and many more interruptions followed in the course of the 
43:1019:82708:27:28:72:128:202:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:evening.191 
43:1020:82719:28:28:72:517:174:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Ubu Roi was given a second performance the next evening, but then closed, and was 
43:1021:82801:28:27:71:497:146:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:never again performed in Jarry’s lifetime. Yet the impact of its opening night gave Jarry 
43:1022:82891:27:0:71:542:119:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:immediate fame in literary circles, as for weeks afterward favorable and unfavorable views of the 
44:1023:82992:0:27:72:539:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:play were debated in Paris’ major newspapers. This proved to be the high point of Jarry’s career. 
44:1024:83090:27:28:72:512:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:He continued to write about Ubu, and over time began to assume the character’s manner of 
44:1025:83179:28:27:72:478:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:speaking. Not unlike Rimbaud, Jarry attempted to stimulate his imagination through 
44:1026:83262:27:28:72:341:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:hallucination, which eventually proved self-destructive. 
44:1027:83319:28:28:72:518:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Roger Shattuck observed that “at thirty Jarry had completed his best years, enjoyed a 
44:1028:83405:28:27:72:485:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:unique notoriety in the literary world of Paris, and was already looked up to by a new 
44:1029:83492:27:28:72:532:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:generation.”192 Among his young followers were the symbolist poet Guillaume Apollinaire and 
44:1030:83584:28:27:72:542:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Apollinaire’s friend Pablo Picasso, who became fascinated by Jarry and appropriated many of his 
44:1031:83680:27:28:72:533:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:eccentricities, even, after Jarry’s death, carrying around the gun that Jarry had always kept with 
44:1032:83779:28:28:72:524:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:him. John Richardson, the most exacting biographer of Picasso’s early career, has argued that 
44:1033:83873:28:27:72:534:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Picasso’s breakthrough into Cubism in 1907 was inspired not only generally by the iconoclastic 
44:1034:83968:27:28:72:531:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:example of Jarry’s efforts to blend fantasy and reality in  ́Pataphysicks, which aimed to abolish 
44:1035:84066:28:27:72:497:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:traditional standards of beauty and good taste, but even more specifically by a particular 
44:1036:84157:27:28:72:538:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:illustration that Jarry gave for his new science. Thus Richardson argues that Jarry anticipated the 
44:1037:84257:28:27:72:515:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:multiple viewpoints of Cubism in a  ́Pataphysickal treatise of 1898: “to claim the shape of a 
44:1038:84351:27:28:72:499:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:watch is round [is] a manifestly false proposition - since it appears in profile as a narrow 
44:1039:84444:28:28:72:542:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:rectangular construction, elliptical on three sides; and why the devil would one only have noticed 
44:1040:84543:28:27:72:317:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:its shape at the moment of looking at the time?”193 
44:1041:84594:27:28:71:517:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Jarry died at the age of just 34, of tuberculosis aggravated by his drinking. His major 
44:1042:84682:28:27:71:529:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:achievement, Ubu Roi, had already made a powerful impression on many Symbolist artists. So 
44:1043:84773:27:28:71:522:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:for example immediately after the play’s first performance Stéphane Mallarmé had written to 
44:1044:84865:28:0:71:526:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Jarry that in Ubu he had created “a prodigious personage of rare and resistant texture, and you 
45:1045:84964:0:27:72:534:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:have done it as a sure, sober, dramatic sculptor. He has joined the repertory of the best taste and 
45:1046:85064:27:28:72:516:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:already haunts me.”194 Many years later, another playwright who had also attended that first 
45:1047:85157:28:27:72:522:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:performance reflected that “the schoolboy Jarry, to mock a professor, had without knowing it 
45:1048:85250:27:28:72:535:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:created a masterpiece in painting that somber and oversimplified caricature with brushstrokes in 
45:1049:85347:28:28:72:510:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the manner of Shakespeare and the puppet theater.”195 Whether or not Jarry recognized the 
45:1050:85437:28:27:72:530:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:importance of his achievement, in Roger Shattuck’s apt words “the schoolboy imagination had 
45:1051:85529:27:28:71:507:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:succeeded in throwing dung in the public eye.”196 Jarry’s ability to do this appears to have 
45:1052:85622:28:27:72:526:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:depended critically on his youth, for both the simplicity of his artistic vision and the confident 
45:1053:85721:27:28:72:519:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:iconoclasm with which he presented it to the public are hallmarks of the youthful conceptual 
45:1054:85814:28:28:72:127:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:innovator.  
45:1055:85826:28:27:72:124:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Architects 
45:1056:85836:27:14:144:456:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Each day we feared that he’d change what he had settled the day 
45:1057:85900:14:14:144:460:367:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:before. We’d point out as he started revising a drawing, “But Mr. 
45:1058:85966:14:14:144:434:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Wright, yesterday you decided it this way.” His answer was

45:1060:86096:13:14:143:453:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:never left anything alone. He no sooner got a system going than 
45:1061:86160:14:14:143:223:312:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:he’d upset it all.

45:1067:86305:14:14:144:306:229:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:do not work and rework the idea.

45:1070:86420:14:28:72:527:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Frank Lloyd Wright began his career as an architect in 1887, at the age of 20. Over the 
45:1071:86508:28:27:71:524:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:course of the next 72 years he produced designs for more than 1000 buildings, of which more 
45:1072:86600:27:28:71:514:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:than 400 were constructed. No single building has clearly emerged as his greatest work, but 
45:1073:86692:28:0:71:519:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:among those that have received the greatest attention is Fallingwater, a house Wright built at 
46:1074:86790:0:27:72:523:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Bear Run, Pennsylvania, in 1937, when he was 70 years old. When the house was completed, 
46:1075:86879:27:28:72:522:657:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:Time featured Wright on its cover, with a drawing of the house behind him - the first time the 
46:1076:86974:28:27:72:524:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:magazine had an architect on its cover.199 A recent survey of American architecture described 
46:1077:87068:27:28:72:543:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Fallingwater as “Wright’s most famous building of all,” and a leading architectural scholar called 
46:1078:87167:28:28:72:386:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:it “one of the complete masterpieces of twentieth-century art.”200 
46:1079:87233:28:27:72:506:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Early in his career Wright formulated a set of propositions to define his concept of 
46:1080:87318:27:28:72:521:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:organic architecture, which “evolved from a set of architectural principles in the 1890s into a 
46:1081:87414:28:27:72:524:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:lifestyle by the 1930s.”201 These principles emphasized the importance of simplicity of form,  
46:1082:87509:27:28:72:541:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:harmony between a building and its natural setting,  the use of natural colors, and using materials 
46:1083:87609:28:28:72:518:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:to express their own nature rather than imitating other materials. Wright wanted buildings to 
46:1084:87703:28:27:72:491:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:share the human virtues of sincerity, truthfulness, and graciousness. Within these basic 
46:1085:87792:27:28:72:541:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:guidelines Wright developed distinctively new architectural forms, which never ceased to change 
46:1086:87888:28:27:72:540:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:as he continually experimented throughout his long career. Yet Wright’s style evolved gradually, 
46:1087:87985:27:28:72:543:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and a recent survey concluded that “when we look at the totality of his oeuvre, we see in his form 
46:1088:88084:28:27:72:433:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:language a remarkable coherence, continuity, and recurrence of motifs.”202 
46:1089:88158:27:28:72:508:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: By 1900, Wright had developed his celebrated Prairie Style. Its distinctive features 
46:1090:88243:28:28:72:520:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:included an emphasis on long horizontal lines, relating its buildings to the open spaces of the 
46:1091:88339:28:27:72:500:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Midwestern plains, and a blurring of the distinction between interior and exterior spaces, 
46:1092:88430:27:28:72:519:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:achieved through covered but open areas around a building’s perimeter.203 Over time Wright 
46:1093:88521:28:27:72:520:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:continued to experiment and to simplify the style, and the most famous of the Prairie houses, 
46:1094:88615:27:28:72:309:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Chicago’s Robie House, was completed in 1910. 
46:1095:88661:28:0:72:519:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Wright’s experimental approach is revealed not only in the continual evolution of his 
47:1096:88750:0:27:72:529:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:style but also in his reluctance to determine his buildings’ final forms. He advised architects to 
47:1097:88849:27:28:71:205:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:let their ideas grow slowly: 
47:1098:88878:28:14:143:457:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Conceive the building in the imagination, not on paper but in the 
47:1099:88944:14:13:143:438:615:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:mind... Let it live there - gradually taking more definite form 
47:1100:89008:13:14:143:466:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:before committing it to the draughting board. When the thing lives 
47:1101:89075:14:14:143:452:588:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:for you - start to plan it with tools... Working on it with triangle 
47:1102:89144:14:14:143:438:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and T-square should modify or extend or intensify or test the 
47:1103:89206:14:14:143:214:560:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:conception.204 
47:1104:89220:14:13:144:147:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: 
47:1105:89220:13:28:72:540:533:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:During the time the design was taking shape, or “germinating,” Wright needed to have its setting 
47:1106:89317:28:28:71:492:505:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:firmly in mind: “A building should appear to grow easily from its site and be shaped to 
47:1107:89405:28:27:72:524:477:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:harmonize with its surroundings.”205 Wright not only avoided committing himself to plans on 
47:1108:89497:27:28:72:537:450:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:paper as long as possible, but he typically made changes in his projects until the actual materials 
47:1109:89597:28:27:72:543:422:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:were set in place, and sometimes even after. A biographer observed that “his impromptu methods 
47:1110:89692:27:28:72:528:395:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of designing, which led to his continual failure to prepare complete working drawings, made it 
47:1111:89787:28:28:72:535:367:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:necessary for him to be on the site as often as possible during the time that a building was under 
47:1112:89886:28:27:72:528:339:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:construction.” Although this annoyed many builders, and dismayed many clients as alterations 
47:1113:89979:27:28:72:489:312:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:during construction raised their costs, it never fazed Wright, for “to him the process of 
47:1114:90069:28:27:72:534:284:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:construction was a process of refinement as well.”206 A former student of Wright’s recalled that 
47:1115:90166:27:28:72:519:257:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:“he always changed everything. A perpetual state of flux. ‘The last change is made when the 
47:1116:90258:28:27:72:514:229:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:boom comes down,’ he’d snort.”207 Wright explained his attitude more gently when a client 
47:1117:90348:27:28:72:520:202:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:complained to him of the delays, and expenses, that resulted from Wright’s constant changes 
47:1118:90440:28:28:72:532:174:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:during the construction of one of his most important projects: “You see the building grows as it 
47:1119:90537:28:27:72:394:146:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:is built and is none too easy, therefore, to keep up with always.”208 
47:1120:90606:27:0:72:537:119:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Wright came to be considered as the leading modern architect for the innovative work he 
48:1121:90697:0:27:72:521:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:produced during 1890-1910, but during the next two decades he was eclipsed by a number of 
48:1122:90787:27:28:72:530:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:younger European architects, including Walter Gropius and Mies van der Rohe. By the time of 
48:1123:90879:28:27:72:528:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the Depression he had few clients, not only because of the economic climate but because, then 
48:1124:90973:27:28:72:542:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:past the age of 60, Wright was felt to be out of date. When the Pittsburgh department store owner 
48:1125:91071:28:28:72:515:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:E. J. Kaufmann approached Wright to design his weekend house near a stream at Bear Run, 
48:1126:91159:28:27:71:497:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Wright seized the opportunity to make a bold statement that would revive his career. He 
48:1127:91247:27:28:72:194:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:succeeded spectacularly. 
48:1128:91272:28:27:72:518:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Wright’s design of Fallingwater drew heavily on his own earlier buildings, including 
48:1129:91357:27:28:72:513:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Robie House and his own home at Taliesin. Thus the house features his trademark terraces, 
48:1130:91447:28:28:72:533:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:overhangs, rough stonework, and a variety of other features that had developed from the Prairie 
48:1131:91543:28:27:72:524:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Style. Yet true to his experimental nature, in his desire to outdo the leading European modern 
48:1132:91638:27:28:72:537:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:architects Wright was also willing to borrow their major innovations. So from the work of Mies, 
48:1133:91734:28:27:72:489:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Gropius, Le Corbusier, Schindler, and Neutra, Wright took such prominent features of 
48:1134:91819:27:28:72:536:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Fallingwater as cantilevers, extensive use of concrete and glazing, and an overall Cubist plan.209 
48:1135:91917:28:27:72:534:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Wright used these innovations, however, for his own purposes - to underscore the superiority of 
48:1136:92013:27:28:72:531:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:his own organic architecture over the rigidity of the severe functionalist style of the Europeans. 
48:1137:92112:28:28:72:526:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Thus a scholar recently observed that Fallingwater “used the modernist vocabulary of floating 
48:1138:92206:28:27:72:538:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:planes, but everything about it contradicted the functionalism of the style: its color, its definition 
48:1139:92309:27:28:72:533:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:by and of the landscape, its framing of vistas from within, and its metaphorical interpretation of 
48:1140:92408:28:27:72:524:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:human confrontation with nature, symbolically summed up in the stairs that descend from the 
48:1141:92500:27:28:72:520:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:living room to the water. Each material - stone, glass, concrete - was assigned a function, yet 
48:1142:92596:28:0:72:330:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:each was consonant with the site over a waterfall.”210 
49:1143:92653:0:27:72:541:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Fallingwater drew on the full experience of Wright’s five decades as an architect. He first 
49:1144:92745:27:28:72:519:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:visited Bear Run in December, 1934, but did not produce his first known plans for the house 
49:1145:92837:28:27:72:538:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:until September of the next year. Before presenting these plans to the client Wright made at least 
49:1146:92936:27:28:72:518:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:three, and perhaps four, visits to the site. In a recent study Franklin Toker concluded that the 
49:1147:93033:28:28:72:512:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:traditional story that Wright drew his first plans for Fallingwater in just a few hours, on the 
49:1148:93129:28:27:72:502:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:morning of September 22, 1935, as E. J. Kaufmann drove from Milwaukee to Taliesin, is 
49:1149:93215:27:28:72:540:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:probably a myth, and that he had likely made drawings for his own use before that date.211 Toker 
49:1150:93312:28:27:71:536:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:observed that Fallingwater contains two dramatic features that above all others made it famous - 
49:1151:93409:27:28:71:538:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the visual illusion that the stream actually runs through the house, and the extension of the upper 
49:1152:93509:28:28:72:533:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:balcony beyond the one below it. Toker’s study of Wright’s drawings of the plans for the house 
49:1153:93604:28:27:72:525:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:led him to conclude that one of these, the oversailing balcony, was not part of the plan Wright 
49:1154:93700:27:28:72:505:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:initially drew on September 22, but that at some point that morning “he erased its original 
49:1155:93792:28:27:72:520:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:parapet line and set a new one 19 feet farther out, which made the upper balcony oversail the 
49:1156:93886:27:28:72:533:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:living room by 6 feet.” The effect was striking: “Fallingwater now took on a totally new image, 
49:1157:93982:28:27:72:504:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:with the famous crisscross of its two main balconies.”One of Fallingwater’s most famous 
49:1158:94070:27:28:72:542:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:features, which “defies all structural and functional logic,” was thus an improvisation that Wright 
49:1159:94170:28:28:72:500:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:added after nine months of study of the project. Nor did Wright’s changes cease with his 
49:1160:94259:28:27:72:530:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:construction drawings. In June of 1936, for example, with construction of Fallingwater already 
49:1161:94354:27:28:72:518:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:under way, from Taliesin Wright sent new plans that changed the shape of the three massive 
49:1162:94445:28:27:71:519:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:concrete bolsters that served as the building’s main source of support - several days after the 
49:1163:94541:27:28:71:526:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:bolsters had been poured. Wright’s assistant who was supervising construction promptly “tore 
49:1164:94634:28:0:71:500:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:down the just-completed bolsters and helped construct a new set in late July. Wright was 
50:1165:94726:0:27:72:423:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:determined to give Fallingwater a thrilling profile, whatever the cost.”212 
50:1166:94801:27:28:72:530:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Fallingwater became the focus of a great flood of publicity, including feature articles in 
50:1167:94892:28:27:72:525:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:hundreds of newspapers and magazines, and an unprecedented exhibit devoted to the house at 
50:1168:94983:27:28:71:529:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:New York’s Museum of Modern Art. It quickly became “the most famous private house in the 
50:1169:95072:28:28:71:523:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:world.”213 Wright also received “the biggest PR boost of his career, and the perfect vehicle to 
50:1170:95168:28:27:72:502:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:hype his comeback,” in the form of a special issue of Architectural Forum devoted to the 
50:1171:95257:27:28:72:516:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:architect, “which has no rival as the most famous issue of any architectural magazine in any 
50:1172:95350:28:27:72:138:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:language.”214 
50:1173:95363:27:28:72:538:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Wright’s success was the result of producing a bold and dramatic design that synthesized 
50:1174:95452:28:28:72:533:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:major elements of his own past art with key innovations from the work of his leading European 
50:1175:95546:28:27:71:498:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:rivals, all in the service of his own organic principles: hovering over two waterfalls, and 
50:1176:95638:27:28:72:497:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:anchored among three large boulders, Fallingwater was an unmistakable example of the 
50:1177:95723:28:27:72:537:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:integration of modern architecture and nature. Approaching the age of 70, Wright produced “the 
50:1178:95818:27:28:72:541:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:most complex house of the twentieth century” through an extended and painstaking experimental 
50:1179:95912:28:27:72:476:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:process that drew on his vast working experience and mature aesthetic judgment.215 
50:1180:95994:27:28:72:535:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: In a recent survey of 40 textbooks of art history, two works were found to be tied for the 
50:1181:96085:28:28:71:535:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:distinction of being reproduced more often than any others made by American artists during the 
50:1182:96180:28:27:72:522:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:1980s. One of these was Tilted Arc, executed in 1981 by the sculptor Richard Serra, who was 
50:1183:96272:27:28:72:525:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:then 42 years old and widely recognized as one of the most important living American artists. 
50:1184:96366:28:27:72:532:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The other was the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, dedicated in 1982, which had been designed by 
50:1185:96457:27:28:72:375:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Maya Lin at the age of 21, during her senior year in college.216 
50:1186:96521:28:0:72:512:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Lin originally made her design for the memorial as an assignment in an architecture 
51:1187:96608:0:27:72:525:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:seminar she took at Yale. After thinking about the purpose of the memorial, she wanted to see 
51:1188:96702:27:28:72:534:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the site, so Lin and a few friends traveled to Washington, D. C. She later recalled that “it was at 
51:1189:96802:28:27:72:303:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the site that the idea for the design took shape”: 
51:1190:96853:27:14:144:391:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: I had a simple impulse to cut into the earth. 
51:1191:96899:14:14:144:429:588:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: I imagined taking a knife and cutting into the earth, 
51:1192:96953:14:14:144:437:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:opening it up, an initial violence and pain that in time would 
51:1193:97016:14:14:143:182:560:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:heal.217 
51:1194:97024:14:27:72:539:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Lin’s plan was to have two long walls of polished black granite, arranged in a V shape, placed in 
51:1195:97122:27:28:72:532:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the ground to form an embankment. One of the walls was to point to the Lincoln Memorial, the 
51:1196:97215:28:27:72:517:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:other to the Washington Monument: “By linking these two strong symbols for the country, I 
51:1197:97305:27:28:72:540:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:wanted to create a unity between the country’s past and present.”218 Lin realized that the strength 
51:1198:97405:28:28:72:236:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of her design lay in its simplicity: 
51:1199:97442:28:13:144:468:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:On our return to Yale, I quickly sketched my idea up, and it almost 
51:1200:97510:13:14:144:456:395:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:seemed too simple, too little. I toyed with adding some large flat 
51:1201:97577:14:14:144:460:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:slabs that would appear to lead into the memorial, but they didn’t 
51:1202:97644:14:14:144:471:367:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:belong. The image was so simple that anything added to it began to 
51:1203:97711:14:14:144:230:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:detract from it.219 
51:1204:97730:14:13:144:147:339:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: 
51:1205:97730:13:28:72:542:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: After Lin had completed her design, she decided to enter it in the national competition for 
51:1206:97822:28:27:72:526:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the veterans memorial. She found that the most difficult part of the entry was producing a one-
51:1207:97917:27:28:72:512:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:page description of the project: “It took longer, in fact, to write the statement that I felt was 
51:1208:98015:28:28:72:533:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:needed to accompany the required drawings than to design the memorial.”220 Lin explained that 
51:1209:98109:28:27:72:527:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the description was “critical to understanding the design,”  because the Memorial reflected her 
51:1210:98205:27:28:72:417:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:conceptual approach to art. Lin’s artistic goals are explicitly ideational: 
51:1211:98281:28:14:144:462:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Each of my works originates from a simple desire to make people 
51:1212:98345:14:13:144:471:146:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:aware of their surroundings, not just the physical world but also the 
51:1213:98415:13:14:144:309:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:psychological world we live in.221 
51:1214:98449:14:14:143:146:119:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: 
51:1215:98449:14:0:71:514:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The Memorial prominently features the carved names of all the soldiers killed or missing in 
52:1216:98544:0:27:72:533:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Vietnam, reflecting Lin’s belief that “writing is the purest of art forms... Words can be the most 
52:1217:98643:27:28:72:522:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:direct means of sharing our thoughts.”222 The resemblance of the walls of the Memorial to an 
52:1218:98736:28:27:72:536:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:open book is not accidental, as Lin explained that “the memorial is analogous to a book in many 
52:1219:98832:27:28:72:354:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:ways.”223 In creating art, Lin generally begins with words: 
52:1220:98892:28:14:144:461:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: I begin by imagining an artwork verbally. I try to describe 
52:1221:98952:14:14:144:442:560:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:in writing what the project is, what it is trying to do. I need to 
52:1222:99019:14:13:144:456:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:understand the artwork without giving it a specific materiality or 
52:1223:99086:13:14:144:470:533:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:solid form. I try not to find the form too soon. Instead, I try to think 
52:1224:99159:14:14:144:327:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:about it as an idea without a shape.224 
52:1225:99198:14:14:144:147:505:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: 
52:1226:99198:14:27:72:519:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The most important thing is to begin with a good concept: “a simple clear idea or moment of 
52:1227:99290:27:28:72:533:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:inspiration is the soul of the piece.” The Memorial satisfied this criterion, for it “was born of an 
52:1228:99391:28:28:72:284:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:instantaneous idea to cut open the earth.”225 
52:1229:99436:28:27:72:542:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Architectural projects are inevitably collaborative, for architects must consider the wishes 
52:1230:99529:27:28:71:542:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of clients. Any collaboration can require compromises and deviations from an architect’s original 
52:1231:99627:28:27:72:524:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:plans, but the potential for interference with Lin’s design was enormous because of the public 
52:1232:99722:27:28:72:506:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:role of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and the many controversies that still surround the 
52:1233:99812:28:27:72:535:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Vietnam War. Thus even after her design was chosen by an eight-person selection committee, it 
52:1234:99906:27:28:72:538:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:had to go through an extended process of review by government agencies and public scrutiny, in 
52:1235:100001:28:28:72:531:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the course of which many strenuous objections were raised, by Vietnam veterans and others, to 
52:1236:100095:28:27:72:533:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the non-representational nature of Lin’s model. In an eventual compromise, a sculpture of three 
52:1237:100191:27:28:72:517:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:male soldiers was placed some distance from Lin’s monument, and later a sculpture of three 
52:1238:100282:28:27:72:539:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:female figures and a wounded soldier was also placed further away. Yet when the Memorial was 
52:1239:100375:27:28:72:505:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:dedicated in the fall of 1982, Lin found it did reflect her original intention: “the place was 
52:1240:100470:28:0:72:283:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:frighteningly close to what it should be.”226 
53:1241:100518:0:27:72:544:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Lin’s design was a radical departure from earlier memorial architecture, for the Memorial  
53:1242:100608:27:28:72:533:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:was influenced much more strongly by Minimalist sculpture than by traditional memorials. Her 
53:1243:100701:28:27:72:539:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:use of abstract forms initially shocked veterans and others who had expected a realistic portrayal 
53:1244:100800:27:28:72:521:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of soldiers in combat, which would explicitly pay tribute to their heroism and patriotism. Yet 
53:1245:100895:28:28:72:531:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:when the Memorial was completed, it quickly came to be recognized as a moving tribute to the 
53:1246:100988:28:27:72:532:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:soldiers who had died in Vietnam. Today it is not only the most visited memorial in the capital, 
53:1247:101085:27:28:72:486:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:but it is widely considered to have established a new level of excellence for memorial 
53:1248:101172:28:27:72:506:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:architecture. So for example when the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation held a 
53:1249:101257:27:28:72:530:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:competition for a memorial to the victims of the 2001 attack on the World Trade Center, Maya 
53:1250:101350:28:28:72:528:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Lin was appointed to the five member jury. When the eight final designs were presented to the 
53:1251:101444:28:27:72:503:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:public, the architecture critic for the New Yorker remarked that although all of these were 
53:1252:101536:27:28:72:511:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:intelligent and sophisticated, they received a lukewarm reaction from critics and the public 
53:1253:101629:28:27:72:500:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:because “in the post-Vietnam-memorial age, we may have come to expect too much of a 
53:1254:101713:27:28:72:531:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:memorial.” The problem was that Lin had set a new standard: “Lin’s Vietnam memorial set the 
53:1255:101805:28:27:72:159:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:bar very high.”227 
53:1256:101823:27:28:72:540:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: In the two decades since she designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Lin has pursued a 
53:1257:101910:28:28:72:534:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:career as a architect and sculptor. A recent profile observed that “Now a beneficiary of a stream 
53:1258:102008:28:27:72:528:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of commissions, this still-young master is riding her good fortune, turning out institutional and 
53:1259:102106:27:28:72:491:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:private projects while also making the individual sculptures to which she attaches such 
53:1260:102194:28:27:72:524:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:importance.”228 Yet the survey of textbooks found no other work by Lin reproduced in even a 
53:1261:102286:27:28:72:539:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:single book.229 Thus from the vantage point of art scholars Lin’s contribution consists of a single 
53:1262:102386:28:0:71:506:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:work, that one scholar describes as “one of the most compelling monuments in the United 
54:1263:102477:0:27:72:532:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:States.”230 That a 21-year-old artist could conceive an idea that would be fully expressed in one 
54:1264:102575:27:28:72:528:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:enormously successful project, and that would be followed by no others deemed significant by 
54:1265:102668:28:27:71:539:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:art scholars, is a quintessentially conceptual phenomenon. Unlike the aging Frank Lloyd Wright, 
54:1266:102764:27:28:71:540:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:who worked surrounded by assistants and apprentices at an academy dedicated to making his art, 
54:1267:102859:28:28:71:539:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the young Maya Lin worked alone: the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was first given solid form in 
54:1268:102952:28:27:71:519:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:mashed potatoes at her college dining hall.231 And unlike Wright’s extended and painstaking

54:1270:103140:28:27:71:493:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and the success of her design, may all have been consequences of her youth and lack of 
54:1271:103227:27:28:71:517:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:experience. As one of the jurors for the competition commented on seeing Lin’s unorthodox

54:1275:103484:14:14:144:361:367:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:sensation of making such an important film? 
54:1276:103528:14:14:144:367:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Welles: I never doubted it for a single instant. 
54:1277:103577:14:13:324:469:339:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Interview with Orson Welles,

54:1280:103613:14:14:144:448:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:I do think that there is an art to the making of a motion picture. 
54:1281:103680:14:13:144:462:284:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:There are some great artists in the business. I am not one of them.

54:1284:103848:14:28:72:523:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:There is remarkably widespread agreement that Citizen Kane is the most important American 
54:1285:103938:28:27:72:522:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:movie ever made. Thus for example Citizen Kane ranked first in a “definitive selection of the 
54:1286:104032:27:28:72:537:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:100 greatest American movies of all time,” as determined by a poll of more than 1,500 members 
54:1287:104126:28:27:72:528:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f5:of the American film community conducted in 2000 by the American Film Institute.236 Citizen 
54:1288:104217:27:28:71:515:133:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Kane also placed first in a ranking of the 100 best films of the 20th century compiled by The 
54:1289:104311:28:0:71:495:105:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:Village Voice from a poll the newspaper conducted of 50 distinguished film critics. The 
55:1290:104402:0:27:72:542:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:screenplay for Citizen Kane similarly ranked first in a 2001 survey of the members of the Writers 
55:1291:104500:27:28:72:523:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Guild of America.237 Nor is Kane’s fame limited to the United States. Once every decade, the 
55:1292:104593:28:27:72:521:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:British film magazine Sight & Sound conducts an international poll of critics and directors to 
55:1293:104688:27:28:72:510:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:determine the 10 best movies ever made. Citizen Kane placed first in this poll in 1962, and 
55:1294:104780:28:28:71:504:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:repeated this success in every subsequent decennial poll, including the most recent one in 
55:1295:104871:28:27:71:531:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:2002.238 When Sight & Sound recently reprinted a paperback edition of Pauline Kael’s book on 
55:1296:104964:27:28:72:524:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the making of Citizen Kane, titled Raising Kane, the only print on the book’s front cover read 
55:1297:105059:28:27:71:538:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:“Pauline Kael on the best film ever made.”239 Francois Truffaut recalled the enormous impact of 
55:1298:105155:27:28:72:529:464:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:Citizen Kane: “This film has inspired more vocations to cinema throughout the world than any 
55:1299:105248:28:28:72:501:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:other.”240 Among the most celebrated facts about Citizen Kane is that it was directed and 
55:1300:105338:28:27:72:538:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:coauthored by the boy-wonder Orson Welles, who also played the title role, when he was just 25 
55:1301:105433:27:28:72:242:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:years old. It was Welles’ first film. 
55:1302:105471:28:27:72:536:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: The importance of Citizen Kane derived in large part from its technical virtuosity. So for 
55:1303:105562:27:28:72:392:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:example a recent survey of film history explained its contribution: 
55:1304:105630:28:14:144:447:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:It enabled the spectator not only to look through the frame at a 
55:1305:105695:14:13:144:459:284:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:make-believe world, but to see once again, so to speak, the frame 
55:1306:105761:13:14:144:455:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:as a constructed image... [N]o single aspect of Citizen Kane was 
55:1307:105826:14:14:144:429:257:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:entirely original or unknown to filmmakers, but the work’s 
55:1308:105885:14:14:144:438:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:startling impact came from its total effect, the concentration, 
55:1309:105949:14:14:144:466:229:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:comprehensiveness, and unity of its stylistic effort... Welles strove 
55:1310:106019:14:13:144:443:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:with his collaborators to utilize multiple innovations in nearly 
55:1311:106084:13:14:144:390:202:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:every shot and scene throughout the whole film.241 
55:1312:106134:14:14:144:147:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: 
55:1313:106134:14:28:72:515:174:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:Citizen Kane’s technical sophistication was not accidental, but was a result of exceptionally 
55:1314:106228:28:27:72:513:146:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:careful planning. Both the film’s composer and its photographer emphasized that they were 
55:1315:106318:27:0:72:510:119:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:given exceptional amounts of time to plan and achieve the novel aims they and Welles had 
56:1316:106410:0:27:72:524:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:formulated. Thus Bernard Herrmann wrote that he and Wells agreed that “the dynamics of all 
56:1317:106501:27:28:72:507:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:music in the picture should be planned ahead of time.” Contrary to the normal Hollywood 
56:1318:106589:28:27:72:537:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:procedure in which musical scores were not written until filming was completed, Herrmann was 
56:1319:106682:27:28:72:542:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:given time to write his score before filming began, and was then allowed to work on the film as it 
56:1320:106781:28:28:72:539:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:was being shot and edited. In a number of scenes, film sequences were actually tailored to match 
56:1321:106878:28:27:72:530:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the music. Herrmann observed of the completed movie that “the result is an exact projection of 
56:1322:106973:27:28:72:516:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the original ideas in the score.”242 Similarly, Gregg Toland explained that “the photographic 
56:1323:107067:28:27:72:536:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:approach to Citizen Kane was planned and considered long before the first camera turned.” This 
56:1324:107162:27:28:72:534:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:allowed Toland time not only to formulate novel plans, but to make extensive experiments with 
56:1325:107256:28:28:72:507:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:equipment and sets to make the plans possible. In this he had Welles’ full support: “Orson 
56:1326:107347:28:27:72:540:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Welles was insistent that the story be told most effectively, letting the Hollywood conventions of 
56:1327:107446:27:28:72:488:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:movie-making go hang if need be.” Toland credited Welles for the opportunity: “Such 
56:1328:107530:28:27:72:521:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:differences as exist between the cinematography in Citizen Kane and the camera work on the 
56:1329:107621:27:28:72:520:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:average Hollywood product are based on the rare opportunity provided me by Orson Welles, 
56:1330:107710:28:27:72:518:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:who was in complete sympathy with my theory that the photography should fit the story.”243 
56:1331:107800:27:28:72:542:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: The meticulous planning of Welles and his collaborators produced a movie that contained 
56:1332:107888:28:28:72:532:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:many innovations involving both sound and sight. A number of the sound innovations reflected 
56:1333:107981:28:27:72:541:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Welles’ earlier experience in radio. These included musical bridges - the introduction of music in 
56:1334:108080:27:28:72:540:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the middle of a scene, to change the mood and foreshadow the transition to the next scene; sound 
56:1335:108177:28:27:72:536:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:montages - series of short bursts of speech, that revealed the reactions of a number of characters 
56:1336:108276:27:28:72:515:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:in quick succession; and overlapping dialogue tracks that mimicked the interruptions of real 
56:1337:108369:28:0:72:521:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:conversation, with variation in sound levels that allowed one voice to be heard at a time. The 
57:1338:108467:0:27:72:519:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:visual innovations in Citizen Kane have become even more famous. A number of these were 
57:1339:108555:27:28:72:514:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:used to attain what Toland called “human-eye focus,” with much greater depth of field than 
57:1340:108646:28:27:72:479:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:movies normally afforded. Contributing to this was the staging, with construction of 
57:1341:108731:27:28:72:541:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:exceptionally deep sets, so the action of a scene could occur simultaneously at different distances 
57:1342:108831:28:28:72:528:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:from the camera; the use of extremely wide-angle lenses, with high-speed films, and very high 
57:1343:108925:28:27:72:515:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:levels of illumination, which allowed sharp focus throughout the deep space of the sets, and 
57:1344:109018:27:28:72:533:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:often created the startling effect of having important action in the background; and long camera 
57:1345:109115:28:27:72:530:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:takes that allowed greater freedom of movement and extended ensemble acting for the players. 
57:1346:109208:27:28:72:494:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:The greater realism produced by the novel device of building ceilings over the sets also 
57:1347:109297:28:28:72:521:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:permitted the dramatic low-angle shots that became one of the movie’s technical trademarks. 
57:1348:109389:28:27:72:526:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Citizen Kane became celebrated for its many innovative technical devices, but Welles’ 
57:1349:109475:27:28:72:531:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:greatest achievement probably lay in the integration of these many devices in the service of the 
57:1350:109572:28:27:72:541:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:film’s story.244 The dramatic use of chiaroscuro in lighting, the fragmentation of the film’s action 
57:1351:109673:27:28:72:539:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:in physical depth, staccato bursts of spoken words, and many other technical effects all served to 
57:1352:109772:28:27:72:497:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:underscore the symbolic content of the film. Jorge Luis Borges recognized this when he 
57:1353:109859:27:28:72:500:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:observed that Citizen’s Kane’s subject is “the discovery of the secret soul of a man,” and 
57:1354:109950:28:28:72:541:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:explained that “In astonishing and endlessly varied ways, Orson Welles exhibits the fragments of 
57:1355:110047:28:27:71:541:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the life of the man, Charles Foster Kane, and invites us to combine and reconstruct them.”245 The 
57:1356:110145:27:28:72:533:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:variety of technical means used to tell the story parallels the variety of views of Kane presented 
57:1357:110244:28:27:72:524:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:by different characters, which evolved from the original idea motivating the film: thus Welles 
57:1358:110339:27:28:72:534:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:recalled that the story of Kane began with “the idea of telling the same thing several times - and 
57:1359:110438:28:0:72:500:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:showing exactly the same scene from wholly different points of view. Basically, the idea 
58:1360:110530:0:27:72:210:684:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:Rashomon used later on.”246 
58:1361:110557:27:28:72:505:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Welles’ conceptual approach to making movies is reflected in his emphasis on the 
58:1362:110638:28:27:72:540:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:primacy of dialogue over images or action. Thus in a 1964 interview he declared: “I know that in 
58:1363:110735:27:28:72:531:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:theory the word is secondary in cinema but the secret of my work is that everything is based on 
58:1364:110831:28:28:72:517:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the word. I do not make silent films. I must begin with what the characters say. I must know 
58:1365:110924:28:27:72:530:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:what they say before seeing them do what they do.”247 For Welles, a good script was necessary 
58:1366:111018:27:28:71:499:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:for a good film: “I’m sure I can’t make good films unless I also write the screenplay.”248 
58:1367:111108:28:27:71:525:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Citizen Kane is a conceptual masterpiece, a great early work executed by an important 
58:1368:111194:27:28:71:512:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:conceptual innovator. It dominates Welles’ career. Thus Gerald Mast observed that “unlike 
58:1369:111284:28:28:71:513:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Hitchcock, Lubitsch, Chaplin, Hawks, or Ford, whose reputations rest on a great number of 
58:1370:111374:28:27:71:536:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:impressive films, critical respect for Orson Welles rests primarily on one film, Citizen Kane.”249 
58:1371:111472:27:28:72:541:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Andrew Sarris stressed the allegorical nature of the film: “Kane develops two interesting themes: 
58:1372:111570:28:27:72:502:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the debasement of the private personality of the public figure, and the crushing weight of 
58:1373:111661:27:28:72:536:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:materialism. Taken together, these two themes comprise the bitter irony of an American success 
58:1374:111756:28:27:72:522:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:story that ends in futile nostalgia, loneliness, and death.”250 Francois Truffaut recognized that 
58:1375:111854:27:28:72:536:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Welles had achieved what all young directors hope to do: “To shoot Citizen Kane at twenty-five 
58:1376:111949:28:28:71:485:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:years of age, is this not the dream of all the young habitués of the cinematheques?”251 
58:1377:112036:28:27:72:540:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: A great deal of critical energy has been devoted to explaining how a young director could 
58:1378:112126:27:28:72:537:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:produce such a great masterpiece as his first movie. Although Welles had no prior experience as 
58:1379:112222:28:27:72:504:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:a film director, he had behind him a great deal of experience, and success, as an actor and 
58:1380:112314:27:28:72:524:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:director in the theater and radio: as Truffaut put it, Kane is “the only first film made by a man 
58:1381:112412:28:0:72:534:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:who was already famous.” For Truffaut, the movie bore witness to Welles’ iconoclasm: “Wells, 
59:1382:112508:0:27:72:502:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:with extraordinary arrogance, had rejected the rules of cinema, the limits of its powers of 
59:1383:112600:27:28:72:527:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:illusion.”252 Citizen Kane drew liberally on the expertise Welles had acquired in the other arts. 
59:1384:112698:28:27:71:530:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Peter Bogdanovich reflected that “Citizen Kane is like watching a consummate artist grappling 
59:1385:112792:27:28:71:524:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:for the first time with the intoxication of his found vocation. All his passions - theatre, magic, 
59:1386:112891:28:28:71:524:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:circus, radio, painting, literature - suddenly fused into one... No other director discovering the 
59:1387:112990:28:27:71:520:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:medium was as ready or as mature.”253 Pauline Kael stressed the importance of an attitude in 
59:1388:113083:27:28:71:542:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Welles that Bernard Herrmann and Gregg Toland had both described: “He was young and open... 
59:1389:113175:28:27:72:524:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Welles was so eager to try out new ideas that even the tough, hardened studio craftsmen were 
59:1390:113268:27:28:71:521:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:caught up by his spirit, just as his co-workers in the theatre and in radio had been.”254 Welles 
59:1391:113365:28:28:72:522:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:himself had a slightly different explanation. When asked where he’d gotten the confidence to 
59:1392:113458:28:27:72:518:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:make such a major effort so young, he replied: “Ignorance, ignorance, sheer ignorance - you 
59:1393:113550:27:28:72:538:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:know there’s no confidence to equal it. It’s only when you know something about a profession, I 
59:1394:113646:28:27:72:255:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:think, that you’re timid or careful.”255 
59:1395:113686:27:28:72:530:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Many movie critics consider John Ford to have been a great director. In 1973, when the 
59:1396:113773:28:27:72:524:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:American Film Institute established its Life Achievement Award to honor individuals “whose 
59:1397:113864:27:28:72:532:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:talent has, in a fundamental way, advanced the film art, and whose accomplishments have been 
59:1398:113957:28:28:72:523:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:acknowledged by scholars, critics, professional peers, and the general public,” the first award 
59:1399:114053:28:27:72:532:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:was given to Ford. The Institute’s citation declared that “No individual has more fully explored 
59:1400:114150:27:28:72:529:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:on film the American experience.”256 Ford has been the subject of monographs not only by the 
59:1401:114243:28:27:72:500:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:distinguished critic Andrew Sarris, but also by the directors Lindsay Anderson and Peter 
59:1402:114332:27:28:72:542:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Bogdanovich. Anderson considered that Ford was “probably the greatest film director working in 
59:1403:114427:28:0:71:525:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the world’s richest film making tradition.” 257When Orson Welles was asked which American 
60:1404:114520:0:27:72:528:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:directors he most admired, he replied “the old masters. By which I mean John Ford, John Ford 
60:1405:114613:27:28:72:164:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and John Ford.”258 
60:1406:114631:28:27:72:536:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Ford directed more than 140 movies, and won six Oscars. Curiously, however, no one of 
60:1407:114717:27:28:72:520:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:his movies has emerged clearly as a masterpiece. No Ford film was ranked among the top 20 
60:1408:114807:28:28:72:519:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:American movies of all time in the American Film Institute’s survey conducted in 2000, and 
60:1409:114898:28:27:72:501:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:only three of his films were ranked in the top 100. The Institute’s citation for Ford’s Life 
60:1410:114991:27:28:72:518:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Achievement Award did not mention any specific movie, but instead referred collectively to 
60:1411:115082:28:27:72:519:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Ford’s films as “a creative tapestry representing over 50 years of work.”259 Although there is 
60:1412:115177:27:28:72:526:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:considerable disagreement even among Ford’s admirers over what constitutes his best work, a 
60:1413:115269:28:28:72:533:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:number of experts have named The Searchers as his greatest achievement. So for example John 
60:1414:115361:28:27:72:526:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Baxter called it “Ford’s most perfect philosophical statement,” and Gerald Peary considered it 
60:1415:115456:27:28:72:531:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:“the pinnacle of Ford’s cinematic accomplishment.”260 Ford directed The Searchers in 1956, at 
60:1416:115550:28:27:72:155:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the age of 62.261  
60:1417:115569:27:28:72:539:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: That Ford may have been a master without a masterpiece and that his work was excellent 
60:1418:115656:28:27:72:532:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:late in his career both appear to have been consequences of the fact that his approach to art was 
60:1419:115754:27:28:72:539:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:experimental. Ford’s work is consistently praised for its visual qualities. Alfred Hitchcock stated 
60:1420:115854:28:28:72:543:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:that “A John Ford film was a visual gratification.”262 Elia Kazan declared that Ford “taught me to 
60:1421:115953:28:27:71:517:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:tell it in pictures.”263 Orson Welles made a similar statement when asked how he learned his 
60:1422:116046:27:28:72:133:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:visual style: 
60:1423:116060:28:14:144:444:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:I’ve only been influenced by somebody once: prior to making 
60:1424:116120:14:13:144:461:146:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:Citizen Kane I saw [Ford’s] Stagecoach forty times. I didn’t need 
60:1425:116186:13:14:143:437:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:to learn from somebody who had something to say, but from 
60:1426:116244:14:14:143:450:119:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:somebody who would show me how to say what I had in mind; 
60:1427:116302:14:0:143:316:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and John Ford is perfect for that.264 
61:1428:116342:0:13:144:147:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: 
61:1429:116342:13:28:72:515:671:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Federico Fellini stressed Ford’s direct appeal to another one of the senses: “When I think of 
61:1430:116436:28:28:71:382:643:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Ford, I sense the smell of barracks, of horses, of gunpowder.”265 
61:1431:116501:28:27:72:538:615:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Ford’s films are known for their stories and for ensemble acting. Thus a recent history of 
61:1432:116592:27:28:72:538:588:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:film cited Ford as “a good example of the studio director who defined himself over a long career 
61:1433:116689:28:27:72:538:560:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:by way of story and performance. It is possible to speak of a kind of Fordian world... peopled by 
61:1434:116787:27:28:72:529:533:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:a repertory group of players.”266 Unlike Welles, Ford did not consider the script to be a critical 
61:1435:116886:28:28:71:530:505:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:determinant of the quality of a movie. Thus he explained that “After all, you’ve got to tell your 
61:1436:116984:28:27:72:521:477:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:story through the people who portray it. You can have a weak, utterly bad script - and a good 
61:1437:117078:27:28:72:529:450:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:cast will turn it into a good picture.”267 Gerald Mast observed that “Ford’s method emphasized 
61:1438:117173:28:27:72:539:422:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:visual images rather than talk,” and Ford agreed, stating that “Pictures, not words, should tell the 
61:1439:117274:27:28:72:394:395:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:story.”268 On another occasion Ford elaborated on his philosophy:  
61:1440:117341:28:14:144:459:367:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:When a motion picture is at its best, it is long on action and short 
61:1441:117410:14:14:144:456:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:on dialogue. When it tells its story and reveals its characters in a 
61:1442:117479:14:13:144:467:339:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:series of simple, beautiful, active pictures, and does it with as little 
61:1443:117552:13:14:144:458:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:talk as possible, then the motion picture medium is being used to 
61:1444:117618:14:14:144:258:312:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:its fullest advantage.269 
61:1445:117643:14:14:144:147:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: 
61:1446:117643:14:27:72:531:284:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Ford’s goal was to achieve immediacy and realism: “I try to make people forget they’re 
61:1447:117730:27:28:72:533:257:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:in a theatre. I don’t want them to be conscious of a camera or a screen. I want them to feel what 
61:1448:117828:28:27:72:528:229:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:they’re seeing is real.”270 He distrusted not only extensive dialogue but also complex technical 
61:1449:117925:27:28:72:522:202:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:devices: “I like, as a director and a spectator, simple, direct, frank films. Nothing disgusts me 
61:1450:118023:28:28:71:504:174:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:more than snobbism, mannerism, technical gratuity... and, most of all, intellectualism.”271 
61:1451:118114:28:27:71:507:146:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Lindsay Anderson remarked that Ford achieved a wide range of emotional effects through 
61:1452:118201:27:0:71:524:119:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:technical mastery, but that he never allowed technique to obtrude on narrative: “Ford remains 
62:1453:118298:0:27:72:192:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:always a story-teller.”272 
62:1454:118324:27:28:72:470:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Although Ford began directing movies at the age of 23, his early work was 
62:1455:118398:28:27:72:537:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:undistinguished. Thus Andrew Sarris commented that if Ford’s career had ended in 1929 - when 
62:1456:118491:27:28:72:541:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:he was 35, and had already directed more than 65 films - “he would deserve at most a footnote in 
62:1457:118588:28:28:72:524:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:film history.”273 Like that of other experimental artists, Ford’s work developed gradually, and 
62:1458:118684:28:27:72:538:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:with considerably continuity: Peter Bogdanovich remarked that “Every Ford movie is filled with 
62:1459:118779:27:28:72:538:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:reverberations from another - which makes his use of the same players from year to year, decade 
62:1460:118875:28:27:72:538:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:to decade, so much more than just building ‘a stock company’ - and one film of his cannot really 
62:1461:118972:27:28:72:532:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:be looked at as separate from the rest.”274 Ford is widely considered to have improved his work 
62:1462:119068:28:28:72:507:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:until late in his life. Andrew Sarris judged that “the last two decades of his career were his 
62:1463:119163:28:27:72:525:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:richest and most rewarding.”275 Similarly, Peter Bogdanovich considered Ford’s late films his 
62:1464:119257:27:28:72:355:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:best, “not only in execution but in depth of expression.”276 
62:1465:119317:28:27:72:540:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: The explanation of why Ford’s work improved as he aged may be the same as the answer 
62:1466:119402:27:28:72:531:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:he himself gave when asked how he chose where to place his cameras: “You shoot what would 
62:1467:119492:28:27:72:501:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f5:look best on the screen. Experience, instinct. That’s it.”277 Andrew Sarris considered The 
62:1468:119583:27:28:72:515:271:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:Searchers a stylistic summation of “all the best of what Ford had been,” and emphasized its 
62:1469:119675:28:28:72:542:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:beauty: “The Searchers is rich in all the colors and textures of the seasons and the elements, from 
62:1470:119775:28:27:72:538:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the whiteness of winter snows to the brownness of summer sands.”278 Sarris believed that Ford’s 
62:1471:119871:27:28:72:514:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:experience was the key to his late achievements: “The economy of expression that Ford has 
62:1472:119961:28:27:72:440:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:achieved in fifty years of film-making constitutes the beauty of his style.”279 
62:1473:120040:27:28:72:237:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Young Geniuses and Old Masters

63:1475:120136:0:13:144:270:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:through an artist’s career.

63:1478:120282:14:28:72:523:643:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: This consideration of important contributions made either very early or very late in an 
63:1479:120370:28:27:72:536:615:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:artist’s career in seven different artistic disciplines demonstrates not only that there are dramatic 
63:1480:120472:27:28:72:527:588:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:differences in basic characteristics of the work of conceptual and experimental innovators, but 
63:1481:120568:28:27:72:511:560:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:also that there are significant similarities within each of these categories across disciplines. 
63:1482:120665:27:28:71:503:533:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:            Conceptual            innovators            historically have been those artists most often described as 
63:1483:120782:28:28:71:500:505:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:geniuses, as their early manifestations of brilliance have been taken to indicate that these 
63:1484:120875:28:27:71:520:477:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:individuals were born with extraordinary talents. Conceptual innovators normally make their 
63:1485:120967:27:28:71:529:450:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:most important contributions to a discipline not long after their first exposure to it. These early 
63:1486:121067:28:27:71:527:422:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:innovators are often perceived as irreverent and iconoclastic. Among the cases examined here, 
63:1487:121161:27:28:71:540:395:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Kosuth, Rimbaud, Boccioni, and Jarry offer examples of artists whose lack of respect for, or lack 
63:1488:121259:28:28:71:527:367:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of interest in, earlier work in their disciplines figured prominently in their ability to make bold 
63:1489:121359:28:27:71:536:339:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:new departures from existing practices. Conceptual innovations are often very simple. Although 
63:1490:121454:27:28:71:507:312:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Kosuth, Boccioni, and Lin had not spent long periods of time acquiring the complex skills 
63:1491:121544:28:27:71:535:284:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:common to many practitioners of their disciplines, the radical simplifications they made in their 
63:1492:121642:27:28:71:542:257:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:art allowed them to avoid the need for those skills. Kosuth, Rimbaud, Boccioni, Jarry, and Lin all 
63:1493:121741:28:27:71:540:229:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:shared the extremely rapid formation of ideas that characterizes many conceptual innovations, as 
63:1494:121838:27:28:71:498:202:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the central elements of their major contributions arrived in brief moments of inspiration. 
63:1495:121929:28:28:71:508:174:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Conceptual innovations often involve radical leaps, producing work that not only does not 
63:1496:122019:28:27:71:540:146:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:resemble other artists’ work, but equally does not resemble the innovator’s own earlier work. All 
63:1497:122117:27:0:71:536:119:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:seven major conceptual innovations considered here share this characteristic, as in each case the 
64:1498:122218:0:27:72:530:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:specific work examined marked a sharp discontinuity in the career of the artist. A consequence 
64:1499:122313:27:28:72:519:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:of the sudden declaration of conceptual innovations together with their radical nature is their 
64:1500:122409:28:27:72:525:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:frequent landmark status. In six of the seven cases considered here, the work examined in this 
64:1501:122504:27:28:72:495:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:paper clearly dominates the innovator’s career. Thus the mention of Kosuth, Fitzgerald, 
64:1502:122592:28:28:72:522:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Boccioni, Jarry, Lin, or Welles immediately brings to mind a single trademark work. Perhaps 
64:1503:122684:28:27:72:529:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:most fundamentally, this examination of seven major conceptual contributions underscores the 
64:1504:122777:27:28:72:533:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:certainty of these important conceptual innovators. All seven of the artists had great confidence 
64:1505:122875:28:27:72:538:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:in the validity and significance of their innovations, and this allowed them to put forward radical 
64:1506:122975:27:28:72:482:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:contributions early in their careers in spite of their knowledge that many, if not most, 
64:1507:123064:28:28:72:377:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:practitioners of their disciplines would be hostile to their ideas. 
64:1508:123132:28:27:72:529:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: Experimental innovators are most often praised for their wisdom and judgment. All the 
64:1509:123218:27:28:72:470:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:experimental innovations examined here are considered prime examples of superb 
64:1510:123297:28:27:72:539:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:craftsmanship, the result of experience acquired over the course of long careers by their creators. 
64:1511:123397:27:28:72:527:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:All seven experimental innovators considered here are celebrated for their deep understanding 
64:1512:123491:28:27:72:526:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and respect for the traditions of their disciplines. With the exception of Wright’s Fallingwater, 
64:1513:123589:27:28:72:520:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:the major works considered here were not intended as definitive statements, but were instead 
64:1514:123682:28:28:72:539:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:provisional, subject to later modification or further development, reflecting their author’s lack of 
64:1515:123783:28:27:72:485:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:certainty in their accomplishment. It is this uncertainty that is the most basic common 
64:1516:123871:27:28:72:536:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:characteristic of these great experimental innovators. Bishop, Rodin, Ibsen, Wright, and Ford all 
64:1517:123969:28:27:72:506:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:continued beyond the specific contributions examined here, progressively modifying their 
64:1518:124058:27:28:72:516:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:innovations in later works through further experimentation; Mondrian and Dostoevsky were 
64:1519:124147:28:0:72:522:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:prevented from doing this only by death. The work of these experimental innovators not only 
65:1520:124242:0:27:72:489:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:makes explicit statements of uncertainty and ambiguity, but in some cases has implicit 
65:1521:124329:27:28:72:518:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:expressions of uncertainty built into its fabric. Notable examples of this include the irregular 
65:1522:124426:28:27:72:538:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:brushstrokes of Mondrian’s late paintings and Dostoevsky’s innovation of the polyphonic novel. 
65:1523:124521:27:28:72:488:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: This paper’s examination of seven major conceptual innovators has interesting 
65:1524:124599:28:28:72:523:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:implications for a familiar problem that has previously been considered almost exclusively in 
65:1525:124693:28:27:72:540:546:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:relation to one artist at a time, of why some important artists decline precipitously after making a 
65:1526:124794:27:28:72:529:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:great early contribution. Some conceptual artists become tied to an early important innovation, 
65:1527:124890:28:27:72:516:491:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:and produce later work that effectively repeats it in subject or technique. Jarry is an extreme 
65:1528:124986:27:28:72:516:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:example of an artist who became the captive of his early achievement, but to a lesser degree 
65:1529:125079:28:28:72:532:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Kosuth, Lin, and Welles all revisited their early innovations in their later work. In some cases a 
65:1530:125178:28:27:72:540:408:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:conceptual innovator loses the power of his early approach by aiming to produce later works that 
65:1531:125275:27:28:72:541:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:are more complex. Kosuth and Lin have both made later contributions that are more involved but 
65:1532:125370:28:27:72:531:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:less influential than their early masterpieces, and the failure of Tender is the Night to match the 
65:1533:125470:27:28:72:540:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:importance of The Great Gatsby is probably due to Fitzgerald’s attempt to write a more complex 
65:1534:125565:28:27:72:511:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:novel. In each of these cases, the artist’s decline appears to have been a consequence of the 
65:1535:125659:27:28:72:505:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:failure to recognize that the key to the success of an early landmark contribution lay in its 
65:1536:125753:28:28:72:535:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:simplicity. In yet other cases, a brilliant conceptual innovator may lose interest in his discipline. 
65:1537:125855:28:27:72:530:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:It is often difficult to determine whether this plays a role in the career of a particular innovator, 
65:1538:125957:27:28:72:531:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:but among the most dramatic instances of it is surely Rimbaud’s definitive decision to abandon 
65:1539:126052:28:27:72:504:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:poetry            at            the            age            of            19.                                                                                                            
65:1540:126239:27:28:72:535:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: This paper clearly demonstrates the generality of the distinction between conceptual and 
65:1541:126328:28:0:72:522:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:experimental innovators in artistic disciplines. In a wide range of very different activities it is 
66:1542:126431:0:27:72:533:684:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:readily apparent that some artists are conceptual, and others experimental. Examination of their 
66:1543:126528:27:28:72:485:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:contributions furthermore allows us to understand why it is that important conceptual 
66:1544:126614:28:0:72:531:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:innovations are generally made by the young, and major experimental contributions by the old.
