2:30:1580:28:28:306:339:616:12:Times:12:Times:C:ABSTRACT
2:31:1588:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:We empirically analyze the impact of immigration to the U.S. on the share of votes to the Republicans
2:32:1689:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:and Democrats between 1994 and 2012. Our analysis is based on variation across states and years
2:33:1784:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:– using data from the Current Population Survey merged with election data – and addresses the endogeneity
2:34:1889:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:of immigrant flows using a novel set of instruments. On average across election types, immigration
2:35:1987:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:to the U.S. has a significant and negative impact on the Republican vote share, consistent with the
2:36:2086:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:typical view of political analysts in the U.S. This average effect – which is driven by elections in the
2:37:2190:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:House – works through two main channels. The impact of immigration on Republican votes in the
2:38:2283:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:House is negative when the share of naturalized migrants in the voting population increases. Yet, it
2:39:2383:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:can be positive when the share of non-citizen migrants out of the population goes up and the size of
2:40:2483:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:C:migration makes it a salient policy issue in voters' minds. These results are consistent with naturalized
2:41:2588:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:C:migrants being less likely to vote for the Republican party than native voters and with native voters'
2:42:2690:14:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:C:political preferences moving towards the Republican party because of high immigration of non-citizens.
2:43:2792:14:42:72:510:420:12:Times:12:Times:C:This second effect, however, is significant only for very high levels of immigrant presence.

3:72:3869:26:15:91:519:498:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:The  topic  of  international  migration  and  its  consequences  frequently  occupies  the
3:73:3960:15:14:91:519:483:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:headlines of newspapers and television news shows in many rich countries.  Political
3:74:4044:14:15:91:519:469:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:leaders’ stand vis-a-vis this issue can be a very important determinant of their elec-
3:75:4130:15:14:91:519:454:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:toral success or failure.  In the United States the presidential debates have focussed
3:76:4216:14:14:91:519:440:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:over time on all issues related to migration – ranging from illegal migrants to the birth
3:77:4305:14:15:91:519:426:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:right to citizenship.  That migration has a defining effect on political outcomes has
3:78:4390:15:14:91:519:411:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:already been pointed out in the literature (see for example Ortega (2005) and other
3:79:4473:14:15:91:519:397:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:works discussed in Section 2) and, as noted above, is definitely taken into account
3:80:4556:15:14:91:519:382:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:by politicians.  Yet, to our knowledge, no study relative to the U.S. case has looked
3:81:4641:14:15:91:519:368:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:directly and systematically at one crucial aspect of the political effect of immigrants,
3:82:4729:15:14:91:519:353:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:namely their impact on the U.S. election outcomes and specifically on the share of
3:83:4811:14:15:91:519:339:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:votes to the two main political parties (Republicans and Democrats).1Against this
3:84:4892:15:14:91:519:324:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:background, this paper contributes to the literature by analyzing the link between
3:85:4974:14:15:91:519:310:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:migration to the U.S. and the vote share for the Republican and Democratic parties
3:86:5056:15:14:91:519:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:in every election between 1994 and 2012.  To that goal, we exploit the large variation
3:87:5142:14:14:91:519:281:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:in  immigration  across  states  and  years  and  the  corresponding  electoral  outcomes.
3:88:5232:14:15:91:519:267:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:We use data from the Current Population Survey merged with the National Library
3:89:5311:15:14:91:519:252:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:of Congress Election data and, relying on a new identification strategy, we estimate
3:90:5395:14:29:91:457:238:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the causal effect of immigrants on the share of votes to the two parties.
3:91:5468:29:15:109:520:209:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:The number and share of immigrants in the U.S. adult population and labor force
3:92:5547:15:17:91:519:194:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:have been rising steadily over the last four decades.  Based on data from the U.S.
3:93:5629:17:16:105:519:177:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:1The only exception is a recent paper, Baerg et al. (2014), which estimates a negative impact of
3:94:5725:16:12:91:519:161:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:the share of unauthorized workers on the proportion of votes going to the Democrats in the U.S.

4:96:5871:0:15:91:519:685:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Census, there were 6.2 million foreign-born adults in the labor force in the U.S. (7.1
4:97:5957:15:14:91:519:670:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:percent of that group) in 1980, their number grew to 10.3 million (10.1 percent) in
4:98:6040:14:15:91:519:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:1990,  to  15.6  million  (14.4  percent)  in  2000  and  to  22.4  million  (19.1  percent)  in
4:99:6136:15:14:91:520:641:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:2010.2Given its magnitude, immigration to the U.S. is likely to have sizable effects
4:100:6220:14:15:91:519:627:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:on  its  economy  and  society,  through  several  different  channels.   Immigrants  may
4:101:6309:15:14:91:519:612:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:affect native workers’ opportunities in the labor market, as investigated by a large
4:102:6393:14:15:91:519:598:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:literature (see, for example the book by Borjas (2014) and the surveys by Blau and
4:103:6475:15:14:91:519:583:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Kahn (2012) and Lewis and Peri (2014) as overviews of this literature).  Immigrants
4:104:6558:14:15:91:519:569:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:are  also  likely  to  impact  the  destination  country’s  government  budget,  by  paying
4:105:6649:15:14:91:519:554:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:taxes, receiving public welfare and transfers and using public goods (see for instance
4:106:6735:14:14:91:519:540:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Edmonston et al. (1997) and Boeri et al. (2002)).  In addition, the literature points
4:107:6820:14:15:91:519:526:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:out several potential social effects of immigration on culture,  social norms and on
4:108:6904:15:14:91:520:511:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:crime and security3.  Finally, immigrants can also produce political changes in the
4:109:6987:14:15:91:519:497:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:destination country. The impact through the political channel is very important since
4:110:7072:15:14:91:519:482:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:it has the potential to affect the democratic support for institutions and policies in
4:111:7158:14:29:91:427:468:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the destination country and hence to produce long lasting effects.
4:112:7224:29:15:109:520:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:One  crucial  element  to  understand  the  effect  of  immigrants  on  vote  shares  is
4:113:7312:15:14:91:519:424:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:to  recognize  that  election  outcomes  can  be  affected  by  immigration  through  two
4:114:7401:14:14:91:519:410:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:channels, captured by the presence of two different groups of immigrants.  The first
4:115:7485:14:15:91:519:396:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:channel  is  related  to  the  indirect  political  effect  of  immigration  working  through
4:116:7578:15:14:91:520:381:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f6:B:migrants’ impact on existing voters, who are mainly natives.  It is voters’perceived
4:117:7662:14:15:91:519:367:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:impact of immigrants that affects how they cast their vote – and this perceived effect
4:118:7748:15:14:91:519:352:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:is likely to be stronger the more numerous migrants are.  Votes can shift towards a
4:119:7831:14:15:91:519:338:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:political party if its policies, related to migration, increase voters’ utility and if voters
4:120:7924:15:14:91:519:323:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:perceive immigration as an important issue.  The second channel, instead, is related
4:121:8008:14:15:91:519:309:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:to  the  direct  political  role  of  immigrants  as  voters.   As  they  become  naturalized,
4:122:8102:15:28:91:504:294:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:immigrants affect elections, to the extent that they vote differently from natives.
4:123:8185:28:15:109:520:266:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:As far as the first (indirect) effect of immigrants is concerned, voters can perceive
4:124:8270:15:14:91:519:251:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the local presence of immigrants as associated with local amenities or dis-amenities
4:125:8354:14:15:91:519:237:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:– such as cultural effects – or with changes in economic variables – such as wages,

5:132:8877:0:15:91:519:685:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:cies can influence.  These policies may be directly related to migration, like migration
5:133:8965:15:14:91:519:670:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:policy, or may be other types of government interventions.  In the latter case, for ex-
5:134:9052:14:15:91:519:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:ample, if native voters think that immigrants generate a net fiscal transfer from them,
5:135:9139:15:14:91:519:641:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:they might be pushed to vote for the Republican party which favors less redistribu-
5:136:9222:14:15:91:520:627:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:tion and less safety-net policies.4As far as the second (direct) effect of immigrants is
5:137:9310:15:14:91:519:612:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:concerned, instead, once they are naturalized, immigrants will also cast their vote ex-
5:138:9397:14:15:91:519:598:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:pressing their electoral preferences, which are usually different from those of natives:
5:139:9485:15:14:91:519:583:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:This will affect the aggregate election outcome.  In the U.S.,  where naturalization
5:140:9569:14:15:91:520:569:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:rates are high5, this second channel is likely to be important.  Immigration, there-
5:141:9653:15:14:91:519:554:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:fore, may have different impacts depending on the balance of immigrant citizens and
5:142:9736:14:29:91:513:540:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:non-citizens and on how strong the voting response of citizens is to their presence.
5:143:9820:29:14:109:520:511:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:The U.S. press and media, as well as political analysts (e.g.  Gimpel (2014)), have
5:144:9903:14:15:91:519:497:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:for the most part focused on the direct effect (the second described above), pointing
5:145:9988:15:14:91:519:482:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:out the potential adverse impact that migrants can have on the electoral success of
5:146:10071:14:15:91:519:468:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the  Republican  party,  as  immigrants  seem  more  likely  to  vote  for  the  Democratic
5:147:10162:15:14:91:520:453:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Party.6Many political commentators even see an inevitable demise of the Republi-
5:148:10242:14:15:91:519:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:can party, in the long-run, as first- and second-generation immigrants become more
5:149:10324:15:14:91:519:424:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:numerous.  Our analysis confirms this prediction by showing that, on average, im-
5:150:10405:14:14:91:519:410:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:migration to the U.S. has a significant and negative impact on the Republican vote
5:151:10487:14:15:91:519:396:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:share.  In particular, we find this effect in the House elections but not in other types
5:152:10575:15:14:91:519:381:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:of elections (Senate, Presidential and Gubernatorial).  However an important aspect
5:153:10658:14:15:91:519:367:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:of the political effect of migration, which has received less attention, is that natives’
5:154:10747:15:14:91:519:352:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:votes, too, could be affected by the increase in the share of immigrants, as mentioned
5:155:10833:14:15:91:520:338:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:above.7Our empirical analysis shows that this is the case.  When we distinguish be-
5:156:10916:15:14:91:519:323:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:tween the effect of naturalized and non-naturalized immigrants we find a significant,
5:157:11001:14:15:91:519:309:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:negative and linear effect of those naturalized on the share of Republican votes in the
5:158:11088:15:14:91:519:294:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:House elections.  On the other hand, when the share of non-naturalized immigrants
5:159:11169:14:14:91:519:280:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:increases, there is a small negative or insignificant linear effect on the share of Re-
5:160:11256:14:15:91:519:266:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:publican votes but, if we allow for a non-linear (quadratic) effect, we actually find a
5:161:11343:15:14:91:519:251:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:positive impact for large levels of immigrants’ shares (above 0.132).  In other words,
5:162:11429:14:18:91:519:237:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:native  voters’  political  preferences  move  towards  the  Republican  party  because  of
5:163:11520:18:16:105:519:219:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:4At the same time, if immigrants have only limited access to the welfare state, as can be the
5:164:11613:16:12:91:519:203:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:case with illegal immigrants, native voters might vote for the party in favor of redistribution and
5:165:11712:12:8:91:476:191:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:safety-net policies, if they believe that immigration is negatively affecting their incomes.
5:166:11804:8:12:105:493:183:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:A:5In our data set (1994-2012), naturalized immigrants are about 40% of total immigrants.

6:170:12071:15:14:91:519:670:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:non-naturalized immigrants – many of whom are new immigrants and some undocu-
6:171:12148:14:15:91:519:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:mented – become a large share in a state, perceptions by voters become acute, making
6:172:12232:15:14:91:519:641:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:immigration a salient feature in the voting decision of natives.  Our estimates reveal
6:173:12318:14:15:91:519:627:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:that in states characterized by a very high non-naturalized immigrant share of the
6:174:12400:15:14:91:519:612:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:population (6 states in 2012:  California, District of Columbia, Nevada, New Jersey,
6:175:12484:14:15:91:519:598:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:New York and Texas), the Republican vote share in House elections is positively and
6:176:12567:15:14:91:519:583:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:significantly affected by an increase in new (non-naturalized) immigrants.  However,
6:177:12651:14:15:91:519:569:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:when the share of non-naturalized immigrants in the population is less than 13.2%,
6:178:12733:15:14:91:519:554:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the impact of an increase in this share on Republican votes is null to negative.  In this
6:179:12822:14:14:91:519:540:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:case, the main effect of immigration is to add voters to the electorate, who tend to
6:180:12906:14:15:91:519:526:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:vote for the Democratic party.  Overall our results are consistent with the hypothesis
6:181:12992:15:14:91:519:511:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:that  naturalized  immigrants  are  less  likely  to  vote  for  the  Republican  party  than
6:182:13085:14:15:91:519:497:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:native  voters,  and  that  native  voters’  political  preferences  are  shifted  towards  the
6:183:13180:15:14:91:519:482:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Republicans, but only in states where the presence of non-naturalized immigrants is
6:184:13263:14:15:91:519:468:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:high.  Also note that the average U.S. state is one in which the negative direct impact
6:185:13350:15:14:91:519:453:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:on Republican votes from naturalized immigrants prevails.  For example, in the year
6:186:13433:14:15:91:519:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:2012, the average share of non-citizen immigrants was 6.8% significantly below the
6:187:13515:15:28:91:206:424:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:13.2% threshold value.
6:188:13537:28:15:109:520:396:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:As  mentioned  above,  we  find  that  on  average  immigration  to  the  U.S.  has  a
6:189:13623:15:14:91:519:381:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:significant and negative impact on the Republican vote share. Yet, empirical evidence
6:190:13708:14:15:91:519:367:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:from some European countries is exactly the opposite as it shows that immigrant

6:192:13870:14:15:91:519:338:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:and Halla et al. (2012)).  Our results, differentiating between citizen and non-citizen
6:193:13957:15:14:91:519:323:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:migrants, suggest one possible explanation of the difference between the European
6:194:14038:14:15:91:519:309:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:and U.S. findings.  We find that the political effect of immigration crucially depends
6:195:14124:15:14:91:519:294:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:on the extent to which migrants can participate in the political process. To the extent
6:196:14211:14:14:91:519:280:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:that in Europe naturalization rates and/or political participation of immigrants are
6:197:14295:14:15:91:519:266:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:low, the indirect political effect of migration working through migrants’ impact on
6:198:14378:15:14:91:519:251:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:existing  voters’  preferences  should  be  the  main  one  at  work.   In  the  U.S.,  where
6:199:14471:14:15:91:519:237:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:naturalization  rates  are  large,  the  direct  effect  of  immigrants  on  votes  is  sizable
6:200:14566:15:14:91:519:222:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:and dominates on average.  However, when we differentiate across states/years cells
6:201:14649:14:15:91:519:208:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:according  to  their  share  of  non-naturalized  migrants,  we  also  find  that  six  states
6:202:14743:15:14:91:519:193:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:have a high enough share of non-naturalized immigrants such that this group has a
6:203:14824:14:18:91:478:179:12:g_d0_f1:8:g_d0_f3:B:positive effect on Republican votes, consistent with the European findings.8
6:204:14900:18:16:105:519:161:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:8According to the American Community Survey (ACS), in 2008 the U.S. naturalization rate was
6:205:14991:16:0:91:519:145:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:43%.  In many European countries naturalization rates were lower in the same year, for example in
7:206:15089:0:14:109:520:670:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Our analysis is both theoretical and empirical.  We first develop a simple model,
7:207:15170:14:15:91:519:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:which provides intuition about the main channels at work and which allows us to
7:208:15249:15:14:91:519:641:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:derive  theory-based  empirical  specifications.   Our  empirical  analysis  addresses  the
7:209:15340:14:15:91:519:627:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:key identification issue.  A least square estimate of the correlation between votes and
7:210:15427:15:14:91:519:612:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:immigration could be biased by spurious correlation due to the fact that immigrants
7:211:15510:14:15:91:519:598:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:self-select into geographical areas – and might go where natives are more favorable
7:212:15593:15:14:91:519:583:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:to their presence.  We use a novel set of instruments for our main explanatory vari-
7:213:15677:14:15:91:519:569:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:ables, which are the overall share of migrants and, respectively, the naturalized and
7:214:15762:15:14:91:519:554:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:non-naturalized shares in a state.  Shift-share instruments  ̈ı¿œ la Card (2001) – based
7:215:15850:14:14:91:519:540:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:on the size of past settlement of immigrants from a given country of origin across
7:216:15932:14:15:91:519:526:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:U.S.  states  –  have  been  widely  used  in  the  literature,  based  on  the  idea  that  one
7:217:16028:15:14:91:519:511:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:important determinant of migration is family and friends networks (Munshi (2003)).
7:218:16110:14:15:91:519:497:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:However, one concern that has been raised is that the past location of immigrants
7:219:16191:15:14:91:519:482:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:across destinations might be correlated with past local economic and political con-
7:220:16274:14:15:91:519:468:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:ditions.  To the extent that these conditions are persistent and hence correlated over
7:221:16360:15:14:91:519:453:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:time, this would invalidate the exclusion restriction of shift-share instruments  ̈ı¿œ la
7:222:16449:14:15:91:519:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Card (2001).  We address this concern.  The unifying theme of our novel instruments
7:223:16532:15:14:91:519:424:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:is that the distance between a country of origin of immigrants and a U.S. state is
7:224:16614:14:14:91:519:410:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:likely to be an exogenous determinant of the size of settlements of immigrants from
7:225:16697:14:15:91:519:396:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:that source and, likely, not correlated with other factors affecting the political cli-
7:226:16784:15:14:91:519:381:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:mate in the state.  To construct the instrument for the overall share of immigrants in
7:227:16870:14:15:91:519:367:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:a U.S. state, we use a shift-share IV, where predicted migration shares are inversely
7:228:16955:15:14:91:519:352:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:proportional to the state’s distance from the country of origin. Similarly, to construct
7:229:17043:14:15:91:519:338:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the instrument for the naturalized migrant share, we use data on aggregate yearly
7:230:17124:15:14:91:519:323:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:inflows of naturalized immigrants from a given country of origin and apportion these
7:231:17208:14:15:91:519:309:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:data across states according to shares that are inversely proportional to the distance

7:236:17629:14:15:91:519:237:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:gue that the instrument for non-naturalized immigrants mainly captures the changes
7:237:17711:15:14:91:519:222:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:in the group of undocumented Mexicans and Central Americans.  We think of this
7:238:17789:14:15:91:519:208:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:point as a strength of our identification.  First,  this is a very large and significant
7:239:17877:15:21:91:519:193:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:group among the non-naturalized immigrants.  Second, this is the group that likely
7:240:17959:21:12:91:519:172:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:Italy (14%) and in Austria (34%) (Reichel (2012)).  The analysis of the difference in the political

8:245:18360:14:15:91:519:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:of undocumented immigrants that several Republican candidates try to rally their

8:247:18445:29:14:109:520:612:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:The outline of the paper is as follows.  Section 2 surveys the existing literature
8:248:18527:14:15:91:519:598:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:related to this paper.  In Section 3, we develop a theoretical model that characterizes
8:249:18614:15:14:91:519:583:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the indirect effect of new migrants (through changes in existing voters’ voting behav-
8:250:18700:14:15:91:519:569:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:ior) separately from their direct effect (through the inclusion of naturalized migrants
8:251:18787:15:14:91:519:554:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:as new voters).  We then describe the data and how we construct the key variables in
8:252:18871:14:14:91:519:540:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Section 4.  In Section 5 we present, respectively, a naive and a model-based empirical
8:253:18957:14:15:91:519:526:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:specification that we use for estimation.  We also discuss identification and present
8:254:19042:15:14:91:519:511:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the main empirical results.  In section 6 we calculate the effect of different policies on
8:255:19132:14:15:91:519:497:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the vote share of the Republican party as predicted by our estimates.  We also use
8:256:19214:15:14:91:519:482:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:data on immigration and voting behavior in some representative U.S. states in 2008
8:257:19296:14:15:91:519:468:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:and 2012 to illustrate the relevance and plausibility of the estimated effects.  In Sec-
8:258:19384:15:14:91:519:453:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:tion 7, we investigate potential channels through which non naturalized immigrants
8:259:19466:14:40:91:467:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:affect the voting behavior of existing voters.  Finally, Section 8 concludes.

8:263:19722:29:14:109:520:329:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:A large part of the theoretical economic literature has focused on voting behavior
8:264:19804:14:15:91:519:315:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:on immigration policy as a function of the skill composition of immigrants and na-
8:265:19886:15:14:91:519:300:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:tives.  The seminal paper in this literature is Benhabib (1996), which derives the skill
8:266:19974:14:14:91:519:286:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:composition requirements that would be imposed on potential immigrants, under ma-

8:270:20310:15:14:91:519:228:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:balance of the destination country.  The arrival in the destination country of immi-
8:271:20394:14:15:91:519:214:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:grants,  whose skill composition depends on the existing immigration policy,  alters
8:272:20478:15:17:91:519:199:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the skilled-to-unskilled labor ratio of the work force in the destination country.  This,

8:274:20669:16:12:91:519:166:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:the sake of space our survey focuses on economics papers.  Importantly, though, to our knowledge,
8:275:20766:12:0:91:474:154:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:no works in the political science literature carry out the same type of analysis as we do.
9:276:20857:0:15:91:519:685:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:in turn, affects the current-period skill premium as well as the skill composition of
9:277:20942:15:14:91:519:670:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:next period’s electorate, and thus the political balance and migration policies in the
9:278:21028:14:15:91:519:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:future.   On  the  one  hand,  skilled  (unskilled)  natives  prefer  an  immigration  policy
9:279:21121:15:14:91:519:641:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:that  admits  unskilled  (skilled)  immigrants  to  their  country  because  of  their  wage
9:280:21213:14:15:91:519:627:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:effects.  On the other hand, the arrival of unskilled (skilled) immigrants potentially
9:281:21299:15:14:91:519:612:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:shifts the political equilibrium by increasing the number of unskilled (skilled) voters
9:282:21386:14:15:91:519:598:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:in the next period.  These two opposite effects could produce a cycle equilibrium in
9:283:21470:15:14:91:519:583:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:which the political majority switches from one group to the other.  Alternatively, a
9:284:21554:14:15:91:519:569:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:quota equilibrium could prevail in which the group in the majority – either skilled or
9:285:21640:15:14:91:519:554:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:unskilled – admits immigrants of the opposite type but limits their number through
9:286:21722:14:14:91:519:540:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:quotas, in order to retain future political power.  Finally, Razin et al. (2011) focus on
9:287:21811:14:15:91:519:526:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the joint decision of voters on immigration and redistribution policies, respectively.
9:288:21897:15:14:91:519:511:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:They emphasize how, in terms of immigration and redistribution, a democratic state
9:289:21979:14:15:91:519:497:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:would produce policies that are consistent with each other so that, when immigration
9:290:22063:15:14:91:519:482:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:is more open, natives restrict redistribution for fear of net transfers to immigrants,
9:291:22149:14:15:91:519:468:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:while when immigration is more restricted, they are willing to allow more redistri-
9:292:22232:15:14:91:519:453:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:bution.  The theoretical models provide predictions on how natives of different skills
9:293:22318:14:15:91:519:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:prefer more or less immigrants,  also as a function of the amount of redistribution
9:294:22401:15:28:91:204:424:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:provided by the state.
9:295:22423:28:15:109:520:396:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:The existing empirical literature for the U.S. provides indirect evidence for the
9:296:22504:15:14:91:519:381:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:effect of immigrants on voting behavior, mainly by analyzing what determines the
9:297:22584:14:15:91:519:367:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:preferences of U.S. individuals about immigrants. For example, Scheve and Slaughter
9:298:22667:15:14:91:519:352:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:(2001)  analyze  the  labor-market  drivers  of  individual  preferences  on  immigration
9:299:22756:14:15:91:519:338:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:policy  –  using  the  1992  NES  survey  –  and  find  that  more-skilled  respondents  are
9:300:22848:15:14:91:520:323:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:significantly  less  likely  to  be  anti-immigration.10Hanson  et  al.  (2007)  extend  the
9:301:22940:14:15:91:519:309:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:previous analysis by accounting for the impact of public-finance considerations on
9:302:23022:15:14:91:519:294:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:U.S. migration attitudes.  This paper shows that the negative impact of individual
9:303:23104:14:14:91:519:280:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:skill on anti-migration preferences is weaker in states characterized by high exposure
9:304:23190:14:15:91:520:266:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:to immigrant fiscal pressures.11Looking at similar surveys for European countries,
9:305:23272:15:14:91:519:251:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Card et al. (2012) show that while the perception of economic gains from immigrants
9:306:23355:14:18:91:519:237:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:vary across skills of natives, it is the perception of the impact of immigrants on local
9:307:23443:18:16:101:519:219:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:10Given that in the U.S. immigrants are on average less skilled than natives, respondents’ percep-
9:308:23541:16:12:91:519:203:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:tions are in line with the predictions of the multi-cone HO model (without factor-price insensitivity)
9:309:23643:12:8:91:287:191:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:and of the factor-proportions-analysis model.

10:315:24046:29:14:109:520:641:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:More  directly  related  to  our  work  are  some  papers  that  analyze,  for  different

10:317:24216:15:14:91:519:612:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:right-wing parties. In particular, Barone et al. (2014) empirically analyze the effect of
10:318:24305:14:15:91:519:598:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:immigration to Italy on political outcomes in the 2001, 2006 and 2008 national elec-
10:319:24389:15:14:91:519:583:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:tions.  This paper finds that the inflows of immigrants into a municipality increased
10:320:24474:14:15:91:519:569:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the share of votes going to the centre-right party, which was more conservative on
10:321:24556:15:14:91:519:554:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:immigration issues than the centre-left one.  Similarly, Halla et al. (2012) estimate
10:322:24641:14:14:91:519:540:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the impact of immigrant inflows in Austria on the share of votes for a far-right-wing
10:323:24726:14:15:91:519:526:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:party  (the  Freedom  Party  of  Austria).   They  find  evidence  of  a  positive  and  sig-

10:328:25165:15:14:91:519:453:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:correlation between the district’s immigrant share and the share of votes for extreme
10:329:25250:14:15:91:519:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:right-wing parties – with a clearly anti-immigration stand – and of a negative cor-

10:331:25417:14:14:91:519:410:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Party – which had a pro-migration position.  The authors give a causal interpretation
10:332:25502:14:15:91:519:396:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:to these results based on a fixed-effects empirical strategy and additional robustness

11:348:26753:14:15:91:519:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:to natives.  Hence a change in the fraction of voting immigrants in the electorate may

13:483:32709:15:14:91:519:497:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:more likely than natives to vote for the Democrats – as long as the effects on income
13:484:32794:14:15:91:520:483:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:and non-pecuniary utility are equal.  In other words,rIMMIit−rNATit<0.Pushing
13:485:32871:15:14:91:519:468:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:our simplification a step further, we can assume that the policies of each party affect
13:486:32958:14:15:91:519:454:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the  income  and  non-pecuniary  utility  of  natives  and  citizen  immigrants  in  similar

13:488:33133:14:14:91:519:425:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:are  long-term  immigrants  and  their  skill  and  income  profile  is  similar  to  that  of

13:495:33639:14:29:91:323:303:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:can be considered as constant across policies.
13:496:33685:29:14:109:520:274:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Republicans  enact  policies,  generate  expectations  and  communicate  messages

13:500:34037:15:14:91:519:216:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:of immigrants (as a share of the population) and note that recent immigrants are
13:501:34117:14:18:91:519:202:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:non-citizens.  Voters in states that have recently experienced a large inflow of new

13:503:34298:16:11:91:519:168:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:the average income of citizen immigrants is $37609 in 1999 prices compared to $34228 of natives.
13:504:34394:11:12:91:519:157:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:On  the  other  hand,  the  average  years  of  education  (12.6)  and  the  average  income  ($25614)  of

14:507:34670:15:14:91:519:670:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:–  are  likely  to  perceive  strong  effects  of  these  immigrants  on  their  income  and
14:508:34762:14:15:91:519:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:non-pecuniary  amenities.   Hence  both  terms  are  a  function  of  the  non-citizen  mi-

14:511:35031:14:15:91:519:611:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:tive immigration policies in general, therefore they also admit fewer new (non-citizen)

14:513:35212:14:15:91:519:582:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:“immigrants stealing jobs and reducing wages” or “immigrants being a fiscal drain”

14:528:35767:29:15:109:520:465:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:The  non-pecuniary  effect  of  immigrants,  in  particular,  may  operate  in  a  non-
14:529:35854:15:14:91:519:450:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:linear way.  When there are few new immigrants, voters may like the diversity and
14:530:35935:14:15:91:519:436:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:variety they bring or may not consider it too relevant.  Local shops, restaurants, and
14:531:36021:15:14:91:519:421:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:services may benefit from it and their small number is not perceived as a threat to
14:532:36104:14:15:91:519:407:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:local traditions.  However,  the perception may become negative and stronger once
14:533:36185:15:14:91:519:392:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:non-citizen  immigrants  grow  beyond  a  certain  share  of  the  population,  as  voters
14:534:36275:14:14:91:519:378:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:might feel that their culture and local environment can be changed and threatened.
14:535:36357:14:15:91:520:364:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:HenceNPj,it(NCMitMit+Nit) could have a concave shape, i.e.  be increasing or relatively flat
14:536:36449:15:14:91:519:349:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:close to 0 and decreasing at high values of the non-citizen migrant share.  Note that

14:538:36630:15:14:91:519:320:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:and saturation that reduce income of voters as a consequence of new immigrants,
14:539:36709:14:15:91:519:306:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:but only once the non-citizen migrant share passes a given threshold.  By introducing
14:540:36794:15:14:91:519:291:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:this  potential  nonlinearity  of  the  effect  of  non-citizen  immigrants  on  income  and
14:541:36886:14:15:91:519:277:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:non-pecuniary  utility,  we  also  want  to  capture  the  issue  of  “salience”  of  the  topic
14:542:36982:15:14:91:519:262:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:of migration in voters’ minds.  Immigration may become a salient political issue for
14:543:37066:14:14:91:519:248:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:natives only when its size is large enough and immigrant presence becomes apparent.
14:544:37149:14:15:91:519:234:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:In that case the immigration policy of each party can become a deciding factor in
14:545:37230:15:14:91:519:219:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:voting.  On the other hand, migration is likely to always be a salient issue for citizen
14:546:37318:14:15:91:519:205:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:immigrants who care more about immigration policies that affect family and close
14:547:37398:15:29:91:128:190:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:friends.
14:548:37406:29:14:109:520:161:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Therefore  the  share  of  non-citizen  immigrants  can  affect  the  utility  of  voters
14:549:37495:14:0:91:520:147:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:throughIj,it(NCMitMit+Nit)  andNPj,it(NCMitMit+Nit)  and,  as  a  consequence,  the  share  of  the
15:550:37596:0:15:91:519:685:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Republican  vote.   Whether  this  effect  is  negative,  null  or  positive  depends  on  the

15:586:38561:26:15:109:519:376:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:In this specification, we are assuming a linear effect,β1, of new non-citizen im-

15:588:38732:14:14:91:519:347:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:important to allow for the non-linearity that captures the increased salience of im-

15:604:39083:29:14:109:520:209:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Finally note that the perceived effect of Republicans on voters’ income can work
15:605:39163:14:15:91:519:195:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:through several channels.  For example, new immigrants can be thought of, by voters,
15:606:39247:15:14:91:519:180:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:as the cause of favorable or adverse labor-market effects.  According to theory, the
15:607:39331:14:15:91:519:166:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:latter  ones  depend  on  the  skill  composition  of  non-citizen  immigrants  relative  to
15:608:39423:15:0:91:519:151:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:voters and on how skilled voters are.  New immigrants are also likely to be associated
16:609:39511:0:15:91:519:685:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:with changes in the welfare state, which can be favorable or adverse depending on
16:610:39592:15:14:91:519:670:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:how  rich  non-citizen  migrants  are  relative  to  voters.   In  particular,  if  non-citizen
16:611:39687:14:15:91:519:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:migrants are poorer than voters, they are likely to be a fiscal burden.  The opposite
16:612:39772:15:14:91:519:641:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:is true if they are richer than voters. The welfare-state impact of non-citizen migrants
16:613:39860:14:15:91:519:627:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:will also imply income distribution effects which depend on the type of adjustment of
16:614:39945:15:14:91:519:612:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the welfare state to migration (see Facchini and Mayda (2009)) and how rich voters
16:615:40027:14:15:91:519:598:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:are.   Finally,  the  perceived  effect  of  Republicans  on  voters’  non-pecuniary  utility
16:616:40120:15:14:91:519:583:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:can be linked to the cultural effects of new (non-citizen) migrants, which are likely
16:617:40205:14:15:91:519:569:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:to  depend  on  how  different  voters  and  migrants  are  in  terms  of  language  spoken,
16:618:40297:15:14:91:519:554:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:religion, historical and institutional background.  We will account for these channels
16:619:40383:14:14:91:519:540:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:through which the non-citizen migrant share affects Republican votes in Section 7
16:620:40464:14:40:91:124:526:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:below.
16:621:40470:40:27:91:314:486:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:4    Data and key variables
16:622:40497:27:14:91:520:459:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:As suggested by the model above, to analyze the electoral outcome of stateiin year
16:623:40579:14:15:91:520:445:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f1:B:t, we need to analyze three groups of individuals.  First is the group of natives (whose
16:624:40667:15:14:91:520:430:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:number is equal toNit) who constitute in all states the majority of voters.  Second
16:625:40750:14:14:91:519:416:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:is  the  group  of  citizen  immigrants  who  can  vote  and  may  have  different  electoral
16:626:40843:14:15:91:519:402:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:preference from natives.  Finally is the group of non-citizen immigrants who cannot
16:627:40926:15:14:91:519:387:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:vote but whose presence may affect the vote of citizens.  Thus immigrants or foreign-
16:628:41011:14:15:91:519:373:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:born,  whose  total  number  in  stateiand  yeartisMit,  are  divided  into  citizens,
16:629:41097:15:14:91:520:358:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:whose number is equal toCMitand non-citizens, whose number isNCMit,so that
16:630:41171:14:15:91:520:344:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f1:B:Mit=NCMit+CMit.   We  obtain  data  on  natives,  immigrant  citizens  and  non-
16:631:41251:15:14:91:519:329:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:citizens from the Current Population Survey (CPS). The sample period consists of
16:632:41331:14:15:91:519:315:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the years between 1994 and 2012.  We aggregate the individual-level data to the state
16:633:41416:15:14:91:519:300:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:level using the CPS sampling weights.  We estimate our model at the state level since
16:634:41501:14:14:91:519:286:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the CPS data set is not representative at a lower level of geographical disaggregation
16:635:41587:14:15:91:520:272:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:such as county or electoral district16.  However, recognizing that it is important to
16:636:41672:15:14:91:519:257:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:provide results at a finer level of geographical disaggregation, we assume in Section
16:637:41757:14:15:91:519:243:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:5 below that the effect of different groups of immigrants on the share of Republican
16:638:41841:15:14:91:519:228:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:votes,  estimated  at  the  state-level,  holds  at  the  Congressional  district  level.   This
16:639:41937:14:15:91:519:214:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:way we can provide the magnitude of the simulated effects of immigrants on votes
16:640:42017:15:17:91:222:199:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:at this level of geography.
16:641:42044:17:16:101:519:182:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:16Alternative data sets we could have used are the Census data – but these data are only every
16:642:42138:16:12:91:519:166:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:ten years – or the American Community Survey (ACS) data – but these data are only available
16:643:42229:12:12:91:519:154:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:from 2000 on and are yearly representative at low geographical level (such as county) only from
16:644:42324:12:0:91:114:142:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:2005.

18:690:45129:14:15:91:519:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:and in the central United States while it has been relatively low in States of the West

18:693:45321:15:14:91:519:460:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:1994  and  2012.   California  had  the  highest  share  of  immigrants  in  both  years:  28
18:694:45414:14:15:91:519:446:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:percent in the year 1994 and 35.4 percent in 2012.  New England states, as well as
18:695:45496:15:14:91:519:431:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:some southern states such as Texas, Arizona and Florida also had high shares.  The
18:696:45578:14:15:91:519:417:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:states with the lowest immigration share are Kentucky in 1994 (0.4 percent) and West
18:697:45662:15:14:91:519:402:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Virginia in 2012 (1.3 percent).  Overall, the share of immigrants steadily increased
18:698:45746:14:15:91:519:388:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:over time.  The nation-wide average share of immigrants in the total population was
18:699:45829:15:28:91:434:373:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:9.1 percent in year 1994 and it rose to 17 percent in the year 2012.
18:700:45897:28:15:109:520:345:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:The overall share of immigrants in the population combines the two groups that
18:701:45975:15:14:91:519:330:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:we  want  to  consider  separately.   We  see  from  Table  1  that  about  39  percent  of
18:702:46066:14:15:91:519:316:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:immigrants are citizens and the remaining 61 percent are non-citizens.  The share of
18:703:46150:15:14:91:519:301:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:citizens has increased over time as the number of naturalized citizens increased by
18:704:46233:14:15:91:519:287:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:more than the number of new immigrants.  Over the past decade,  while the share
18:705:46312:15:14:91:519:272:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:of non-citizen immigrants in the U.S. population increased from 6.3 percent in 1994
18:706:46395:14:15:91:519:258:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:to  9.5  percent  in  2012,  the  share  of  citizen  immigrants  went  from  2.8  percent  in
18:707:46489:15:14:91:519:243:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:1994 to 7.4 percent in 2012.  As more and more citizens become naturalized, their
18:708:46570:14:14:91:519:229:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:importance in the voting population increases as well. In year 1994, the average share
18:709:46656:14:15:91:519:215:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:was 3 percent and climbed to 8.2 percent in the year 2012.  The share of immigrants
18:710:46739:15:14:91:519:200:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:that are eligible to vote varies greatly across states.  Kentucky has the lowest share of
18:711:46828:14:15:91:519:186:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:0.1 percent in 1994 and California the highest with 20.3 percent in 2012.  Moreover
18:712:46911:15:14:91:519:171:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:there  is  a  strong  correlation  between  the  share  of  non-citizen  immigrants  and  the
18:713:47004:14:15:91:519:157:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:share of citizen immigrants across states.  Those states with large presence of citizen
18:714:47091:15:0:91:519:142:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:immigrants as a share of the voting population also had large presence of non-citizen
19:715:47178:0:15:91:519:685:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:immigrants as a share of the population.  While one may think that this correlation
19:716:47261:15:14:91:519:670:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:makes it hard to separately identify the impact of each of these two groups on voting
19:717:47346:14:15:91:519:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:outcomes,  the  correlation  in  the changes  of  these  variables,  which  is  the  variation
19:718:47440:15:29:91:316:641:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:used to identify the effects, is much smaller.
19:719:47486:29:14:109:520:612:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:In terms of the control variables that we include in the voting equation, we follow
19:720:47569:14:15:91:519:598:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the  existing  literature,  especially  Della  Vigna  and  Kaplan  (2007)  and  include  the
19:721:47661:15:14:91:519:583:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:share of the voting population in each education group (high school dropouts, high
19:722:47743:14:15:91:519:569:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:school graduates, some college, college graduates and more than college), the share

19:729:48143:15:14:91:519:419:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:toral outcomes, we show here some simple correlations. Considering total immigrants
19:730:48226:14:15:91:519:405:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:as a share of the adult population, we analyze whether one detects a correlation in
19:731:48309:15:14:91:519:390:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the data between this variable and the share of votes to the Republican Party.  As
19:732:48391:14:15:91:519:376:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:preliminary evidence, in Figure 3 we show the scatterplot of the change between 1994
19:733:48475:15:14:91:519:361:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:and 2012 in the fraction of Republican votes in the House of Representatives and the
19:734:48559:14:14:91:519:347:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:change in the same period in total immigrants as a share of the adult population,
19:735:48640:14:15:91:519:333:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:across  states.   The  visual  impression  is  clear  and  confirmed  by  the  statistical  sig-
19:736:48736:15:14:91:520:318:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:nificance of a regression line:  there is a significantnegativecorrelation between the
19:737:48822:14:15:91:519:304:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:growth in the immigrant share of the population and the Republican vote share in the
19:738:48906:15:14:91:519:289:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:House.  In the scatterplot we focus on House elections since these are the elections for
19:739:48994:14:15:91:519:275:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:which we find significant effects throughout the paper.  Moreover immigration policy
19:740:49078:15:14:91:519:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:is a federal issue and most of the important legislation on it has to be passed by the
19:741:49164:14:15:91:519:246:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:House of Representatives.  A more systematic way to show the negative correlation
19:742:49245:15:14:91:519:231:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:between the overall share of immigrants and the fraction of Republican votes is to
19:743:49327:14:14:91:519:217:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:pool all types of elections (Presidential (PE), Senate (SE), House of representatives

20:751:49946:14:15:91:519:627:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:effects control for systematic differences in election outcomes across states, election
20:752:50033:15:14:91:519:612:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:types  and  years  which  capture,  respectively,  persistent  political  differences  across
20:753:50126:14:15:91:519:598:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:states and year-specific or election-specific national tendencies.  We also control for
20:754:50213:15:14:91:519:583:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:variables which affect election outcomes according to the existing literature (see, for

20:760:50717:14:15:91:519:497:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:average income.  Note that we define all the control variables over the population of

20:763:50975:15:14:91:519:453:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:election type, where we include the same vector of control variables as well as year
20:764:51059:14:29:91:204:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:and time fixed effects.
20:765:51082:29:14:109:520:410:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:First, we estimate equation (12) with ordinary least-squares, which establishes the
20:766:51165:14:15:91:519:396:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:correlation between the immigrant share and the Republican vote share controlling
20:767:51246:15:14:91:519:381:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:for an array of confounding factors.  Next, we push our “naive” regressions one step

20:770:51511:14:15:91:519:338:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:votes away from (or in favor of) the Republican party.  The instrumental-variable
20:771:51592:15:14:91:519:323:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:methodology we use is based on Card (2001) but, importantly, differs from it as we

22:833:54972:14:14:91:519:540:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:likely to be uncorrelated with the changes in political climate and preferences in the
22:834:55058:14:15:91:519:526:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:state.  If the instrument affects the share of migrants in a state over time, we assume
22:835:55145:15:29:91:478:511:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:that this is the channel through which it affects political election outcomes.
22:836:55223:29:14:109:520:482:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Table 2 shows the OLS estimates of the coefficients in regression (12) including
22:837:55303:14:15:91:519:468:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the fixed effects and all the controls.  The first column pools all types of elections,
22:838:55390:15:14:91:519:453:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:while columns (2) through (6) include respectively Presidential, Senate, House and

22:840:55564:15:14:91:519:424:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:gression (4) uses the share of votes to the Republicans as dependent variable, while
22:841:55648:14:14:91:519:410:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:regression (5) uses the percentage of seats won by the Republicans.  Table 3 shows
22:842:55730:14:15:91:519:396:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the  same  estimates  based  on  the  2SLS  strategy.   Three  results  emerge.   First,  the
22:843:55823:15:14:91:519:381:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:impact of the share of immigrants on Republican votes is negative in all estimates
22:844:55905:14:15:91:519:367:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:but for one type of election (Gubernatorial).  Second, the negative estimates are sig-
22:845:55991:15:14:91:519:352:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:nificant in both OLS and IV specifications only for the House elections, while for the
22:846:56077:14:15:91:519:338:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:other elections the effects are not robust.  Third the negative significant estimates in
22:847:56165:15:14:91:519:323:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the IV are larger than in the OLS, which indicates the presence of omitted variables
22:848:56249:14:15:91:519:309:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:that, at the same time, increase immigration and the share of the Republican vote.
22:849:56331:15:14:91:519:294:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Such  omitted  variables  could  be  economic  shocks  that  increase  local  business  in-
22:850:56422:14:14:91:519:280:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:come – immigrants are attracted by booming states and higher income is associated
22:851:56503:14:15:91:519:266:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:with Republican votes – or demographic shifts of the local population – aging local
22:852:56586:15:29:91:503:251:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:population create more jobs for immigrants and more votes for the Republicans.
22:853:56664:29:14:109:520:222:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Concerning the control variables the results show that, on average, states with a
22:854:56745:14:15:91:519:208:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:higher share of high-school dropouts (the omitted reference group of education) tend
22:855:56829:15:14:91:519:193:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:to have a lower Republican vote share (the significance level varies across types of
22:856:56913:14:15:91:519:179:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:elections).  The average income of voters does not have a significant impact in any
22:857:56996:15:14:91:519:164:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:type of election.  Finally, states with higher unemployment rates are more likely to
22:858:57080:14:0:91:519:150:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:vote Democrat.  Overall, these results are in line with the findings of the literature
23:859:57168:0:15:91:519:685:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:on the determinants of elections and specifically similar to Della Vigna and Kaplan
23:860:57251:15:29:91:127:670:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:(2007).
23:861:57258:29:14:109:520:641:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:So, to a first inspection, the overall share of immigrants has a strong and quan-
23:862:57339:14:15:91:519:627:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:titatively large negative correlation with the share of Republican votes and the IV
23:863:57422:15:14:91:519:612:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:estimates suggest that such correlation is consistent with a negative causal effect.  An
23:864:57510:14:15:91:519:598:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:increase of immigrants by one percentage point of adult population is associated, in
23:865:57594:15:14:91:519:583:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the House elections, with a decrease of the Republican vote share of 1.36 percentage
23:866:57678:14:15:91:519:569:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:points, which is not significantly different from 1.  Such a large and negative coeffi-
23:867:57765:15:14:91:519:554:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:cient is consistent with a situation in which the direct effect of citizen immigrants is
23:868:57853:14:14:91:519:540:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:negative and strong and the indirect effect either works in the same direction as the
23:869:57938:14:15:91:519:526:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:direct one, or does not favor Republicans enough to offset the direct effect.  In order
23:870:58025:15:14:91:519:511:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:to analyze those effects in more detail, we turn next to estimating an equation that
23:871:58109:14:35:91:394:497:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:includes, separately, the variables considered by our model.
23:872:58169:35:22:91:393:462:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:5.2    The model-based estimating equation
23:873:58211:22:15:91:519:440:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:In this section we bring to the data, respectively, the linear and the linear-quadratic
23:874:58298:15:14:91:519:425:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:specifications  we  derived  from  the  model.   We  first  estimate  the  models  with  all
23:875:58390:14:14:91:519:411:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:elections  pooled  and,  next,  we  focus  on  House  elections,  which  are  the  only  ones
23:876:58483:14:15:91:519:397:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:where  we  found  a  significant  correlation  on  average  between  the  immigrant  share
23:877:58573:15:29:91:474:382:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:and the Republican vote share, both in the OLS and in the IV regressions.
23:878:58646:29:14:109:520:353:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:In the linear specification (8), the coefficientβ1represents the indirect political
23:879:58729:14:15:91:519:339:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:effect of immigration, which works through the impact of the non-citizen immigrant
23:880:58811:15:14:91:519:324:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:share.   The  empirical  evidence  from  some  European  countries  (see  Barone  et  al.
23:881:58900:14:15:91:519:310:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:(2014),  Halla  et  al.  (2012)  and  Otto  and  Steinhardt  (2014))  –  where  the  indirect
23:882:58993:15:14:91:519:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:political effect of migration is more relevant than the direct one, as naturalization
23:883:59078:14:14:91:519:281:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:rates tend to be small – suggests that natives become more politically conservative
23:884:59161:14:15:91:519:267:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:when migration increases.  If a similar effect takes place in the United States,  the
23:885:59246:15:14:91:519:252:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Republican vote share should increase when the fraction of non-citizen immigrants
23:886:59327:14:15:91:520:238:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:goes up, in which case we expectβ1>0.  If, on the other hand, the indirect effect is
23:887:59411:15:14:91:519:223:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:not very strong on average in the U.S., we may observeβ1= 0.  Alternatively, the
23:888:59491:14:15:91:519:209:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:indirect political effect may become relevant only for high values of the non-citizen
23:889:59576:15:14:91:519:194:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:immigrant  share,  given  that  only  then  immigration  becomes  a  visible  and  salient
23:890:59666:14:15:91:519:180:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:political issue for voters.  If this is the case, in specification (9) we should estimate a
23:891:59757:15:14:91:520:165:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:zero or negative linear term and a positive quadratic, namelyβL<= 0 andβQ>0,
23:892:59833:14:0:91:519:151:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:so that a higher share of non-citizen immigrants produces a boost to the Republican
24:893:59918:0:29:91:384:685:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:vote only when non-citizen immigrants are a large group.
24:894:59974:29:10:109:520:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:In both specifications (8) and (9), the coefficientβ2on the variablecmvoteshit=

24:898:60225:15:14:91:519:612:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:tives.  According to anecdotal evidence (see for example the citation at the beginning
24:899:60311:14:15:91:519:598:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:of the paper), naturalized immigrants in the U.S. tend to vote for the Democratic

24:902:60512:14:14:91:519:540:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:that  either  pool  all  election  types  or  that  focus  on  House  elections,  for  which  we
24:903:60608:14:15:91:519:526:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:found the most robust results.  One possible explanation of the latter findings is the
24:904:60694:15:14:91:519:511:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:following.  In Presidential, Gubernatorial and Senate elections, very few candidates
24:905:60778:14:15:91:519:497:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:are up for vote – this is of course true in Presidential elections for which there is only
24:906:60868:15:14:91:519:482:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:one candidate per party common to all states, while in the other elections there are
24:907:60952:14:15:91:519:468:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:either one (Gubernational) or two (Senate) candidates per party in each state.  As a
24:908:61036:15:14:91:519:453:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:result, Presidential, Gubernatorial and Senate election campaigns are more focused
24:909:61118:14:15:91:519:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:on the program of the individual candidate rather than on the party program and,
24:910:61198:15:14:91:519:424:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:importantly, the individual candidate’s program may differ from his/her party’s one
24:911:61281:14:14:91:519:410:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:in relation to migration.  On the contrary, in House elections, there are many seats
24:912:61365:14:15:91:519:396:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:in each state – in the case of California, there are 53 seats – and therefore as many
24:913:61450:15:14:91:519:381:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:candidates for each party and state.  Voters may not be as aware of the individual
24:914:61532:14:15:91:519:367:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:candidate’s program and will likely vote based on the party’s political agenda.  This
24:915:61617:15:14:91:519:352:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:suggests that House elections may be more affected by the overall program of each
24:916:61698:14:10:91:519:338:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:party and may face less noise due to the individual program of the various candidates.

24:919:61815:22:14:91:519:252:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Before implementing the IV strategy, we first estimate specifications (8) and (9) using
24:920:61902:14:15:91:519:238:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:OLS and report these results in Table 4:  Column (1) shows the estimates pooling all

24:924:62216:21:16:101:519:159:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:21An alternative explanation might be that House candidates run a more extreme and polarizing
24:925:62309:16:0:91:345:143:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:campaign because they have to appeal to local conditions.

25:928:62536:15:14:91:519:651:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:shift-share method described in section 5.1 above.  In this instance, we apportion the
25:929:62622:14:15:91:519:637:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:aggregate time-varying number of citizen migrants from each origin country in the

25:931:62780:14:16:91:519:608:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:defined as in equation (17).22We also construct the imputed number of native citi-

25:933:62943:15:14:91:519:577:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:as in equation (14) above.  Hence the shift-share instrument for citizen immigrants,
25:934:63027:14:36:91:497:563:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:as a share of the voting population, which we call (cmvoteshit)IV, is as follows:

25:944:63167:31:14:109:520:438:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Similarly  to  (13),  the  imputed  share  (18)  varies  across  years  because  of  the
25:945:63255:14:15:91:519:424:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:national-level time-variation in immigration from each origin-country-group and in
25:946:63337:15:14:91:519:409:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:their naturalization rate.  It varies across states because of the distance of each U.S.
25:947:63425:14:15:91:519:395:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:state from the country of origin of the immigrants.  Distance from the origin affects
25:948:63510:15:14:91:519:380:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the share of immigrants – from that country present in the state – because of mobility
25:949:63596:14:15:91:519:366:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:costs.  Differently from the standard instrument based on Altonji and Card (1991), in
25:950:63681:15:14:91:519:351:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:this case the distribution of immigrants only depends on distance from the country of
25:951:63766:14:15:91:519:337:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:origin.  Hence preferences of early settlers which threaten the exclusion restriction –
25:952:63853:15:14:91:519:322:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:they may have been correlated with economic and political characteristics of a state
25:953:63937:14:29:91:447:308:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:and be persistent over time – do not play any role in this instrument.
25:954:64007:29:14:109:520:279:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Separately we proxy non-citizen immigrants with another novel instrument.  A
25:955:64083:14:15:91:519:265:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:large part of those immigrants in the last two decades is represented by the group
25:956:64165:15:14:91:519:250:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:of undocumented immigrants.  Undocumented non-citizen immigrants are also quite
25:957:64244:14:15:91:519:236:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:different  from  natives  in  their  demographics  (less  educated,  younger,  poorer)  and
25:958:64335:15:14:91:519:221:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:they are more likely to affect the vote of citizens.  Hence we construct a proxy for
25:959:64419:14:18:91:519:207:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the inflow of undocumented immigrants to each U.S. state through the border with

25:961:64599:16:12:91:519:173:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:thatCMotmay be correlated with local conditions at the state level and replicate our analysis by
25:962:64695:12:11:91:520:161:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:omitting  the  contribution  of  stateitoCMotwhen  constructing  the  value  of  the  instrument  for

26:964:64834:0:15:91:519:685:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Mexico  and  we  use  this  imputation  as  an  instrument  for  non-citizen  immigrants.
26:965:64923:15:14:91:520:670:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Let’s callUMtthe total inflow of undocumented immigrants to the U.S. through the
26:966:65003:14:15:91:520:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Mexican  border  in  yeart23.   Since  we  do  not  have  a  measure  of  this  flow,  we  use
26:967:65097:15:14:91:520:641:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the  number  of  apprehensions  at  the  border  with  Mexico,  that  we  callAPt,  which
26:968:65186:14:15:91:519:627:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:captures a share of all individuals who tried to cross illegally.  These data are from
26:969:65272:15:14:91:519:612:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the  U.S.  Border  Patrol  Agency.   Looking  at  the  period,  which  goes  from  1990  to
26:970:65363:14:15:91:519:598:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:2014, there was first a large increase in the number of apprehensions between 1990
26:971:65445:15:14:91:519:583:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:and 2001 and, next, a long and steady decline, only inverted for a one-year increase
26:972:65529:14:15:91:520:569:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:in 2003-2004.  We assume that the number of apprehensionsAPtis proportional to
26:973:65607:15:14:91:520:554:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the number of illegal immigrants (APt=θUMt) who passed the border that year.  If
26:974:65687:14:14:91:519:540:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:there is a certain number of individuals trying to cross the border and only a fraction
26:975:65774:14:15:91:519:526:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:(constant over time) is apprehended, then our formula is accurate.  While the share
26:976:65857:15:14:91:519:511:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:of undocumented people passing the border and being apprehended can depend on
26:977:65934:14:15:91:519:497:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:several  variables  (economic  and  enforcement  related),  as  a  first  approximation  we
26:978:66025:15:14:91:519:482:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:consider  these  variables  as  constant  over  time.   We  then  apportion  the  estimated
26:979:66116:14:15:91:519:468:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:number of undocumented immigrants passing the border, across U.S. states, using
26:980:66195:15:14:91:519:453:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:shares  that  depend  inversely  on  the  logarithm  of  the  distance  from  the  Mexican

27:1011:67842:23:14:91:519:555:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Using both OLS and IV, we estimate a significant negative effect of immigrants on

27:1013:68013:14:15:91:519:527:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:above, this result is consistent with anecdotal evidence and could be explained by
27:1014:68095:15:14:91:519:512:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the fact that naturalized migrants favor a more open migration policy which would
27:1015:68176:14:15:91:519:498:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:allow them to be joined by family members abroad.  An alternative explanation is
27:1016:68256:15:14:91:519:483:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:that migrants are often from countries where many political parties are to the left of
27:1017:68342:14:15:91:519:469:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Democrats and few are as socially conservative as Republicans, thus they are voting
27:1018:68425:15:29:91:341:454:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:for the same type of ideology they grew up with.
27:1019:68473:29:14:109:520:425:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:We also find evidence of non-linear effects of the population share of non-citizen
27:1020:68555:14:14:91:519:411:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:immigrants so that the marginal impact of new immigrants on the Republican vote
27:1021:68634:14:15:91:519:397:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:turns positive when the share is very high,  i.e.  when recent immigration becomes
27:1022:68716:15:14:91:520:382:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:a salient feature at the polls.24Columns (1) through (3) in Table 4 show the OLS

27:1027:69147:14:15:91:519:310:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:ative in all specifications, the impact of the share of non-citizen immigrants is small

27:1030:69357:29:14:109:520:252:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Table 5 focuses on House elections only and shows the 2SLS estimates for the

27:1034:69681:15:18:91:519:194:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:panel, we include the Kleibergen-Paap F statistic, which provides an indication of

27:1036:69875:15:12:91:519:161:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:reaction  in  terms  of  Democratic  votes  to  the  presence  of  unauthorized  immigrants  is  strongest
27:1037:69981:12:0:91:296:149:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:when this presence reaches a certain threshold.
28:1038:70030:0:15:91:519:685:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the significance of the instrument.  Note that since our estimation includes robust
28:1039:70113:15:14:91:519:670:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:standard errors, the standard critical values of Stock-Yogo do not apply (Stock and
28:1040:70196:14:15:91:519:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Yogo (2002)).  Due to the lack of alternative critical values, we apply the same rule
28:1041:70281:15:14:91:519:641:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:of thumb as suggested by Stock and Yogo, i.e.  an F-statistic above 10 indicates that
28:1042:70366:14:15:91:519:627:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the IV is acceptable.  In addition, we also test for the joint significance of endogenous
28:1043:70455:15:14:91:519:612:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:regressors by including the Anderson Rubin Wald test.  A p-value above 0.1 indicates
28:1044:70539:14:15:91:519:598:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the instruments are jointly insignificant
28:1045:70627:15:29:91:363:583:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:and thus robust to the presence of weak instruments.
28:1046:70679:29:14:109:520:554:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:One result stands out.  In each specification and for each method of estimation we
28:1047:70761:14:14:91:519:540:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:find strong evidence of the negative effect of citizen immigrants on the Republican
28:1048:70844:14:15:91:519:526:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:vote share. Specifically, we estimate a negative and significant value for the coefficient
28:1049:70934:15:14:91:519:511:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f1:B:β2in all regressions.  Using the share of Republican votes in the House elections, the
28:1050:71020:14:15:91:519:497:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:point estimate in Table 5 is 1.75 and 1.81, but not significantly different from one
28:1051:71104:15:14:91:519:482:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:(because of the large standard error).  An increase in immigrant citizens as a share of
28:1052:71191:14:15:91:519:468:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:voters by one percentage point decreases the share of the Republican vote by 1.75 to
28:1053:71275:15:14:91:519:453:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:1.81 percentage points.  As for the indirect political effect of immigration, when we
28:1054:71360:14:15:91:519:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:model the impact of the variableNCMitMit+Nitas linear, in specification (8), the estimated
28:1055:71450:15:14:91:519:424:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:coefficient is negative and (marginally) significant in column (1) but insignificant in
28:1056:71537:14:14:91:519:410:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:column (2).  However, in the non-linear specification, the impact of the non-citizen
28:1057:71621:14:15:91:519:396:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:immigrant share is significant with a negative linear effect and a positive quadratic
28:1058:71706:15:14:91:519:381:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:effect, hence it is clearly convex.  This implies that, while at low values of the share
28:1059:71794:14:15:91:519:367:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:of  non-citizen  immigrants,  their  impact  on  the  share  of  Republican  votes  is  likely
28:1060:71888:15:14:91:519:352:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:non-significant  or  even  negative,  for  high  values  of  that  share  their  impact  turns
28:1061:71982:14:15:91:519:338:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:positive.  Such a convex relation between the share of non-citizen immigrants and
28:1062:72063:15:14:91:519:323:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the Republican vote share suggests that the perceptions of new migrants affect voters’
28:1063:72149:14:15:91:519:309:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:behavior only when their share is large and their presence is rather conspicuous.  In
28:1064:72234:15:14:91:519:294:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the next section, we will show the relation between the marginal effect of the non-
28:1065:72317:14:14:91:519:280:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:citizen share on Republican votes and the initial share and calculate the threshold
28:1066:72400:14:29:91:293:266:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:value at which the effect turns positive.
28:1067:72441:29:15:109:520:237:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Thus  the  results  in  Table  5  emphasize  the  different  effect  of  citizens  and  non-
28:1068:72533:15:14:91:519:222:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:citizen immigrants.  In Tables 2 and 3 we detected an overall negative association
28:1069:72615:14:15:91:519:208:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:between immigrants and Republican votes.  However, the estimates in Tables 4 and
28:1070:72695:15:14:91:519:193:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:5 provide a more complex picture of the political impact of migration to the U.S..
28:1071:72777:14:15:91:519:179:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:We  find  that,  while  the  share  of  citizen  immigrants  is  a  significant  boost  to  the
28:1072:72872:15:14:91:519:164:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Democratic party, the effect of non-citizen immigrants is somewhat more complex and
28:1073:72955:14:0:91:519:150:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:non-linear.  In particular new immigrants, who are mainly non-citizen immigrants,
29:1074:73038:0:15:91:519:685:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:have  a  negative  or  non-significant  effect  on  the  Republican  vote  share  when  their
29:1075:73131:15:14:91:519:670:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:share  is  low,  but  a  positive  one  at  higher  values  of  that  share.   These  results  are
29:1076:73229:14:15:91:519:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:consistent  with  naturalized  migrants  being  less  likely  to  vote  for  the  Republican
29:1077:73321:15:14:91:519:641:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:party than native voters and with citizens’ political preferences moving towards the
29:1078:73405:14:15:91:519:627:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Republican party because of high immigration, i.e.  when migration is supposedly a
29:1079:73487:15:40:91:241:612:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:salient issue in voters’ minds.

29:1081:73551:26:14:91:519:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:To illustrate the implications of these estimates, it is useful to calculate how these
29:1082:73637:14:15:91:519:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:coefficients map into the effects of changes in different types of immigrants on the
29:1083:73721:15:14:91:519:517:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:share of Republican votes.  Using the estimated coefficients of the linear specification
29:1084:73809:14:15:91:520:503:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:in Table 5 (βL=−0.80 andβ2=−1.81), we can evaluate which one of the following
29:1085:73886:15:29:91:434:488:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:policies is most beneficial/harmful for the Republican vote share25.
29:1086:73954:29:14:109:520:459:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:1)Increase in newly arrived immigrants:An inflow of new immigrants, typically
29:1087:74031:14:15:91:519:445:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:entering the U.S. without citizenship rights (hence as non-citizens), by 1 percent of
29:1088:74116:15:14:91:520:430:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the population will have an impact equal toβLon the Republican share of votes. This
29:1089:74199:14:14:91:519:416:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:could be driven by a more open immigration policy that admits extra immigrants.
29:1090:74278:14:15:91:520:402:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:The negative estimate ofβLimplies that, on average, the republican party will loose
29:1091:74361:15:14:91:519:387:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:0.8 percent of the votes per percentage point increase.  However, once we recognize
29:1092:74444:14:15:91:519:373:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the salient feature of non-citizen immigration, the impact on the republican vote can
29:1093:74529:15:14:91:519:358:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:turn positive.  Given our estimates in Table 5, column 3, the marginal effect of a 1
29:1094:74613:14:15:91:520:344:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:percent increase of non-citizen immigrants equalsβL+ 2βQNCMitNit+Mit.  It is positive for
29:1095:74702:15:14:91:519:329:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:values above 13.2%.  Figure 4 illustrate the dependence of this effect on the share
29:1096:74785:14:15:91:519:315:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:of  non-citizen  immigrants.   As  of  the  last  presidential  election,  in  2012,  6  states
29:1097:74880:15:14:91:519:300:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:(California,  District of Columbia,  Nevada,  New Jersey,  New York and Texas) had
29:1098:74962:14:14:91:519:286:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:values larger than this threshold.  At the congressional-district level, using estimates
29:1099:75050:14:15:91:519:272:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:of the non-citizen migrant share based on the American Community Survey for the
29:1100:75129:15:14:91:519:257:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:114th Congress, we find that for 55 out of 434 congressional districts the impact of
29:1101:75213:14:15:91:519:243:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the above share is positive.  For 26 districts the effect is not significantly different
29:1102:75301:15:14:91:519:228:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:from zero and for the remaining 353 the effect is negative, see Figure 7(a).  Figure

29:1105:75545:14:18:91:519:185:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Hence for the majority of states and congressional districts,  the potential positive

30:1146:77281:15:28:91:226:363:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:for any U.S. state in 2012.
30:1147:77308:28:15:109:520:335:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Summarizing the main results,  we can emphasize three findings.  First,  all our
30:1148:77388:15:14:91:519:320:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:estimates suggest that an increase in the share of naturalized immigrants increases
30:1149:77471:14:15:91:519:306:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:significantly the share of vote to the democratic party.  This may be because they
30:1150:77553:15:14:91:519:291:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:tend to vote for the Democratic party more intensively than natives (which is the
30:1151:77634:14:15:91:519:277:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:explanation suggested by our framework) but we cannot rule out that part of the
30:1152:77713:15:14:91:519:262:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:effect proceeds from increases democratic preferences of natives in response to more
30:1153:77797:14:15:91:519:248:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:naturalized immigrants.  Second, our findings also indicate that when the share of
30:1154:77879:15:14:91:519:233:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:non-citizen immigrants is large, further increases in the non-citizen migrants share
30:1155:77963:14:14:91:519:219:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:can  increase  the  share  of  votes  to  the  Republicans.   Through  this  channel,  large
30:1156:78055:14:15:91:519:205:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:populations of new immigrants (or non-citizen immigrants) in a state might increase
30:1157:78138:15:14:91:519:190:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the chances of electoral success of the Republican party, when the share of non-citizen
30:1158:78225:14:15:91:519:176:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:migrants is high.  As these immigrants do not vote, the effect we identify is consistent
30:1159:78313:15:14:91:519:161:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:with  the  idea  that  voters’  preferences  can  be  moved  towards  a  more  conservative
30:1160:78404:14:0:91:519:147:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:immigration stand, especially in the House elections, when these immigrants become
31:1161:78488:0:15:91:519:685:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:a large and noticeable presence in the state.  Third, and final, such adverse electoral
31:1162:78575:15:14:91:519:670:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:response to non-citizen immigrants is relevant only at very high population shares of
31:1163:78660:14:15:91:519:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:non-citizen immigrants, which in 2012 only characterized 12% of electoral districts.
31:1164:78744:15:14:91:519:641:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:If we focus on the combined effect through both channels, we now estimate it to be
31:1165:78826:14:15:91:519:627:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:negative in all districts.  However,  it is important to understand that this average
31:1166:78911:15:14:91:519:612:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:impact is the outcome of two opposing effects and that the relative strength of the
31:1167:78994:14:15:91:519:598:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:latter ones could change over time and reverse the sign of the combined effect.  In
31:1168:79077:15:14:91:519:583:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:particular,  to  the  extent  that  the  indirect  effect  is  considered  as  the  relevant  one,

31:1170:79254:15:14:91:519:554:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:of citizens, our mechanism may rationalize the frequent attempt of some republican
31:1171:79336:14:14:91:519:540:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:candidates to make this a salient issue for the elections.  However, we also estimate
31:1172:79421:14:15:91:519:526:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:that the effect on Republican vote share in response to undocumented immigrants
31:1173:79500:15:40:91:315:511:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:would be positive only in very few districts.

31:1181:80057:14:14:91:519:347:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:consider  three  of  them  –  the  labor-market  one,  the  welfare-state  one  and  a  non-

32:1231:82094:14:15:91:519:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:tax adjustment model assumes that the welfare state adjusts to migration through a
32:1232:82176:15:14:91:519:424:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:change in tax rates.  Given that migrants are poorer than voters, they give rise to a
32:1233:82261:14:14:91:519:410:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:deficit in the government’s budget constraint, which in the tax-adjustment model is
32:1234:82344:14:15:91:519:396:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:brought back to balance through an increase in tax rates.  Higher tax rates hurt all
32:1235:82428:15:14:91:519:381:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:voters, but rich ones to a greater extent (because of progressive taxes).  Therefore,
32:1236:82513:14:15:91:519:367:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:through the welfare-state channel under the tax adjustment model, we should find
32:1237:82593:15:14:91:519:352:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:that in states where voters are richer, an increase in the share of non-citizen migrants
32:1238:82681:14:15:91:520:338:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:should  increase  the  Republican  vote  share.   Our  results  in  Table  6,  (βW C>0  in
32:1239:82771:15:14:91:519:323:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:all  regressions  and  significant  in  columns  1,2,4,6,  7  and  8)  is  consistent  with  this
32:1240:82868:14:15:91:519:309:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:explanation.  Finally the negative and significant estimate of the main effect of the
32:1241:82953:15:14:91:519:294:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:variable “Share of non-citizen immigrants” on the share of republican vote implies
32:1242:83035:14:14:91:519:280:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:that, in states where voters are relatively skilled and low income, the impact of the
32:1243:83120:14:15:91:520:266:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:non-citizen migrant share on Republican votes is negative and significant (β1<0).
32:1244:83201:15:14:91:519:251:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:This is again consistent with both the labor-market channel and with the welfare-
32:1245:83282:14:15:91:519:237:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:state channel under the tax adjustment model.  Educated voters do not perceive to
32:1246:83363:15:14:91:519:222:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:be in competition with immigrants in the labor market and, if their income os not
32:1247:83444:14:18:91:519:208:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:too high, they will not be as affected by increases in tax rates.  Thus the response of
32:1248:83531:18:16:101:519:190:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:26Over the considered period, the average number of years of education of non-citizens immigrants
32:1249:83628:16:8:91:320:174:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:was 12.6 while it was 14.1 for the voting population.
32:1250:83681:8:16:101:519:166:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:27In the period we analyze, the average income at constant 1999 prices is 25614 USD for non-
32:1251:83773:16:0:91:386:150:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:citizen migrants compared to 34228 USD for the voting population.
33:1252:83840:0:15:91:519:685:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:skilled and lower income voters to immigrants will decrease the electoral success of
33:1253:83924:15:14:91:519:670:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the Republican party. All these results, on both economic channels, produce a picture
33:1254:84009:14:15:91:519:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:of the perceived economic impact of migration which matches well the evidence from
33:1255:84091:15:14:91:519:641:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the literature on individual attitudes towards immigrants (see Scheve and Slaughter
33:1256:84174:14:29:91:491:627:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:(2001), Hanson et al. (2007), Mayda (2006), and Facchini and Mayda (2009)).
33:1257:84249:29:15:109:520:598:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Note that, at the individual level, skill and income tend to be positively correlated,
33:1258:84335:15:14:91:519:583:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:therefore  the  labor-market  and  welfare-state  channels  (under  the  tax-adjustment
33:1259:84422:14:15:91:519:569:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:model) imply opposite effects.  For example, the very same skilled and rich Califor-
33:1260:84506:15:14:91:519:554:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:nians will welcome non-citizen migrants, because of their (perceived) labor-market
33:1261:84588:14:14:91:519:540:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:effects,  and oppose them,  because of their (perceived) welfare-state effects.  These
33:1262:84674:14:15:91:519:526:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:effects working in opposite directions could explain why the impact of the non-citizen
33:1263:84760:15:29:91:431:511:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:migrant share is small or not significant in the linear specification.
33:1264:84830:29:14:109:520:482:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Finally, we analyze the non-economic channel by introducing several measures of
33:1265:84909:14:15:91:519:468:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:cultural dissimilarity between immigrants and natives and interacting each of them
33:1266:84991:15:14:91:519:453:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:with the non-citizen migrant share.  The measures we consider focus on, respectively,
33:1267:85076:14:15:91:519:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:language,  religious  and  historical  differences  (see  columns  3  through  8,  Table  6)
33:1268:85168:15:14:91:519:424:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:–  by  historical  differences  we  mean  lack  of  a  common  colonial  relationship.   We
33:1269:85259:14:14:91:519:410:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:also  average  these  measures  into  a  composite  one  (see  columns  9  and  10).   The
33:1270:85349:14:15:91:519:396:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:different measures of cultural differences deliver the same message captured by the
33:1271:85432:15:14:91:520:381:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:coefficientβNE, which is always positive and often significant:  Cultural dissimilarity
33:1272:85519:14:15:91:519:367:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:with immigrants pushes votes to the Republican party, the higher is the non-citizen
33:1273:85602:15:34:91:165:352:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:migrant share.
33:1274:85616:34:23:91:278:318:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:7.2    Participation channel
33:1275:85644:23:14:91:519:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Immigrants may also affect the decision of voters to participate in an election, par-
33:1276:85729:14:14:91:519:281:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:ticularly in states where the immigrant population changed a lot.  Some of the effects
33:1277:85815:14:15:91:519:267:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:attributed to the direct and indirect channel could be due to attracting or discour-
33:1278:85899:15:14:91:519:252:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:aging some marginal voters.  In particular if the main effect of citizen immigrants
33:1279:85982:14:15:91:519:238:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:is  their  own  vote,  while  the  main  impact  of  non-citizen  immigrants  is  in  altering
33:1280:86076:15:14:91:519:223:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the  vote  behavior  of  citizens  we  should  observe  such  differential  impact  on  voting
33:1281:86170:14:15:91:519:209:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:turnout.  For this reason,  we consider an additional specification,  where we inves-
33:1282:86255:15:14:91:519:194:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:tigate the impact of citizen and non-citizen immigrants on the voter turnout.  We
33:1283:86336:14:15:91:519:180:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:expect  that,  as  the  share  of  non-citizen  immigrants  increases,  their  indirect  effect
33:1284:86431:15:14:91:519:165:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:may become stronger as they affect voter’s turnout.  To the contrary the presence
33:1285:86512:14:0:91:519:151:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:of citizen immigrants should not affect citizens turnout much.  To shed light on this
34:1286:86599:0:32:91:339:685:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:hypothesis, we estimate the following regression:

34:1294:86698:26:14:109:520:627:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:where the dependent variable, Voter TurnoutV Titin stateiat timet, is defined
34:1295:86775:14:15:91:519:613:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:as the ratio of the number of actual votes divided by the eligible voting population.
34:1296:86860:15:14:91:519:598:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Note that the eligible voting population excludes non-citizen immigrants, prisoners,
34:1297:86944:14:15:91:519:584:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:people on probation as well as people on parole from the voting age population, i.e.
34:1298:87028:15:14:91:519:569:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:everyone residing in the United States, age 18 and older, as defined by the Census
34:1299:87110:14:15:91:520:555:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Bureau.28The  independent  regressors  are  the  same  variables  as  in  the  previous
34:1300:87197:15:14:91:519:540:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:regression specification.  To account for the endogeneity of immigration on election
34:1301:87281:14:29:91:340:526:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:participation, we estimate equation 22 via 2SLS.
34:1302:87329:29:14:109:520:497:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:The results in Table 7 show the linear and non-linear results.  In the linear speci-
34:1303:87413:14:15:91:519:483:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:fication, Column (1), voter turnout increases in the share of non-citizen immigrants
34:1304:87497:15:14:91:519:468:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:by 0.8 percent, while the effect of citizen immigrants is not significant.  Turning the
34:1305:87584:14:15:91:519:454:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:attention to the non-linear specification, the results in Column (2) show that non-
34:1306:87667:15:14:91:519:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:citizen immigrants increase the voter turnout at a declining rate.  Figure 6 plots the
34:1307:87753:14:15:91:519:425:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:marginal effects of 1 percentage point increase of the share of non-citizen immigrants
34:1308:87839:15:14:91:519:410:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:on  the  Voter  Turnout.   In  the  case  of  California,  the  state  with  the  highest  share
34:1309:87935:14:15:91:519:396:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:of non-citizen immigrants in the year 2012 (18%), the marginal effect can even be
34:1310:88016:15:14:91:519:381:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:negative.  On the other hand, in all other states the share of non-citizen immigrants
34:1311:88101:14:14:91:519:367:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:has a positive impact on voters participation.  Overall, our results are consistent with
34:1312:88189:14:15:91:519:353:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the view that higher shares of non-citizen immigrants spur election participation of
34:1313:88273:15:40:91:467:338:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:natives, while having no effect on the participation of citizen immigrants.

34:1315:88363:26:15:91:519:272:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Looking at the debate surrounding immigration policy reform in the U.S., one mes-
34:1316:88444:15:14:91:519:257:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:sage  is  clear:   For  the  most  part  Republicans  are  hesitant  to  push  forward  with
34:1317:88536:14:14:91:519:243:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:migration policy reforms, especially those that would give a path to citizenship to
34:1318:88619:14:15:91:519:229:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:currently undocumented immigrants.  In addition, in electoral times, their average
34:1319:88701:15:14:91:519:214:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:attitude towards migrants is to talk “tough” about the presence of undocumented
34:1320:88780:14:15:91:519:200:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:immigrants.  In this paper, we analyze the impact of immigrants on the vote to the
34:1321:88862:15:18:91:519:185:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Republican party and find some regularities that may help understand this politi-
34:1322:88943:18:15:101:519:167:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:28The voter turnout is public available data compiled by McDonald (2002) and freely available

35:1324:89070:0:15:91:519:685:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:cal behavior.  Political analysts often refer to the pro-Democrat electoral behavior of
35:1325:89157:15:14:91:519:670:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:naturalized immigrants (and second-generation ones) to explain the reluctance of the
35:1326:89241:14:15:91:519:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Republican Party to push forward with migration policy reform.  However, we note
35:1327:89321:15:14:91:519:641:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:that this view is inconsistent with recent research based on European data showing
35:1328:89403:14:15:91:519:627:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:that,  actually,  high immigrant shares might be driving votes towards conservative
35:1329:89486:15:14:91:519:612:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:parties, which promise a reduction in immigration.  We shed light on the difference
35:1330:89569:14:15:91:519:598:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:between the European findings and the views of U.S. political analysts by separately
35:1331:89653:15:29:91:373:583:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:considering two groups of immigrants and their effects.
35:1332:89708:29:14:109:520:554:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Our  results  lead  us  to  two  conclusions.   First,  non-citizen/undocumented  im-
35:1333:89793:14:14:91:519:540:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:migrants are both the enemy and the raison d’ˆetre of some politicians:  right-wing
35:1334:89876:14:15:91:519:526:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:parties  in  Europe  and  vocal  anti-immigration  Republicans  in  the  U.S.  flourish  in

35:1336:90051:14:15:91:519:497:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the U.S., Republicans can gain votes from (non-citizen/undocumented) migrants as
35:1337:90131:15:14:91:519:482:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:their presence seem to make U.S. citizen voters more conservative.  Second, the latter
35:1338:90217:14:15:91:519:468:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:finding is consistent with Republicans talking tough about migration during electoral
35:1339:90302:15:14:91:519:453:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:times.  However we note that the political returns to talking tough on migration by
35:1340:90385:14:15:91:519:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Republicans may be limited since we find that the non-citizen migrant share has a
35:1341:90466:15:14:91:519:424:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:positive impact on Republicans’ political success only when this share is high, which
35:1342:90551:14:14:91:519:410:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:presumably  makes  the  topic  of  migration  salient  in  voters’  minds  or  increases  the
35:1343:90644:14:15:91:519:396:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:concern of citizens.  Based on data from 2012, the year of the last presidential elec-
35:1344:90730:15:14:91:519:381:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:tion, six states (California, District of Columbia, Nevada, New Jersey, New York and
35:1345:90814:14:15:91:519:367:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Texas) had values of the non-citizen migrant share high enough to make its impact
35:1346:90895:15:14:91:519:352:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:positive.   As  we  only  found  the  effect  to  be  present  in  House  elections,  however,
35:1347:90989:14:15:91:519:338:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:it is more meaningful to look at congressional districts, rather than states.  At the

35:1350:91239:15:14:91:519:294:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:of 434 Congressional districts (less than 13% of them) had large enough non-citizen
35:1351:91322:14:0:91:395:280:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:share to produce a positive impact on the Republican vote.
