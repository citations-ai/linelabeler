2:29:1555:31:24:71:539:592:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This paper examines the shift in childbirth from home to hospital that occurred in the United States
2:30:1655:24:24:71:539:568:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:in  the  early  twentieth  century.  Using  a  panel  of  city-level  data  over  the  period  1927-1940,  we
2:31:1764:24:24:71:539:544:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:examine the shift of childbirth from home to hospital and analyze the impact of medical care on
2:32:1859:24:24:71:539:520:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:maternal mortality. Results suggest that increased operative intervention on the part of physicians
2:33:1958:24:24:71:539:496:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and a resultant greater risk of infection increased maternal mortality prior to the introduction of sulfa
2:34:2063:24:24:71:539:472:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:drugs in 1937. However, the introduction of sulfa enabled doctors to reduce maternal mortality by
2:35:2160:24:24:71:539:448:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:enabling  them  to  do  potentially  life-saving  procedures  (such  as  cesareans)  without  the  risk  of
2:36:2267:24:24:71:539:424:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:subsequent infection. Regressions estimated separately by race suggest that the impact of medical
2:37:2364:24:24:71:539:400:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:care  on  maternal  mortality  differed  for  blacks  and  whites.  Relative  to  whites,  hospitals  posed  a
2:38:2474:24:24:71:539:376:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:greater risk for black mothers prior to the availability of sulfa drugs in 1937, and were less beneficial
2:39:2579:24:31:71:502:352:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:for them afterwards, suggesting that blacks may have received lower quality medical care.

3:52:2888:0:25:72:208:709:121:Times:121:Times:1.          Introduction                    
3:53:2932:25:25:108:529:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:The early twentieth-century transformation of the hospital from almshouse to center of medical 
3:54:3027:25:26:72:505:659:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:science is remarkable both in its physical scope and in its social importance. In the late nineteenth 
3:55:3129:26:25:72:504:633:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:century, hospitals were noisy, dirty places that cared for indigents and were operated by charities, 
3:56:3230:25:25:72:528:608:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:religious organizations and government.  Respectable persons were cared for at home by their families. 
3:57:3333:25:25:72:505:583:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:As noted by Rosenberg, “No one wanted to enter a hospital in the mid-1870s, except for the small 
3:58:3430:25:26:72:527:558:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:minority of the least enterprising and lacking in self-respect.” (Rosenberg 1987, p.116).1 The relatively 
3:59:3535:26:25:72:535:532:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:primitive state of medical technology meant that there were virtually no reasons for families to seek care 
3:60:3642:25:25:72:535:507:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:in hospitals rather than be attended by physicians in their homes. Medical care consisted primarily of the 
3:61:3749:25:26:72:487:482:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:administering of drugs, a task that could be easily accomplished at home (Temin 1988, p. 79). 
3:62:3843:26:25:72:542:456:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4: As medical technology advanced, the gradual transformation of the hospital from an almshouse to 
3:63:3939:25:25:72:525:431:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:a modern, scientific institution occurred. Hospitals became natural arenas for medical care and science 
3:64:4043:25:25:72:512:406:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:because technological advances necessitated centralization. Rapid advances in bacteriology led to a 
3:65:4143:25:26:72:534:381:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:greater understanding and implementation of complex aseptic surgical techniques that could more easily 
3:66:4245:26:25:72:530:355:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:be performed in specially designed hospital surgical suites than in living rooms. Advances in pathology 
3:67:4349:25:25:72:539:330:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:led to the formation of clinical laboratories in hospitals, and the X-ray became an important, non-portable 
3:68:4457:25:26:72:142:305:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:diagnostic tool. 
3:69:4474:26:25:72:483:279:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4: The centralization of medical technologies in hospitals coincided with the increasing 
3:70:4560:25:25:72:524:254:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:standardization and professionalization of medical education that began in the late nineteenth century. 
3:71:4664:25:26:72:526:229:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:From 1880 to 1904, the number of medical schools in the U.S. increased from 90 to 154, leading some 
3:72:4764:26:25:72:516:203:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:physicians to argue for education reforms to stem the tide of poor-quality doctors that contributed to 
3:73:4867:25:25:72:521:178:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:“dwindling” medical incomes in an “overcrowded” profession (Stevens 1971, p. 60). Neither medical 
3:74:4965:25:26:72:514:153:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:school entrance requirements nor medical school coursework was rigorous. Medical schools did not 
3:75:5062:26:18:72:529:127:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:require a bachelor’s degree for would-be medical students, and medical education often consisted of no 
3:76:5164:18:8:72:219:109:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
3:77:5212:8:16:72:504:101:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:1 A common perception of the day was poor health was often the result of poor moral character.  Therefore, 
3:78:5319:16:11:72:512:85:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:hospitals concerned themselves more with curing a person’s moral flaws than becoming a steward of medical 
3:79:5424:11:0:72:198:74:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:advances. (Temin 1988, p. 79). 
4:80:5456:0:25:72:501:709:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:more than two or three years in a training program that was frequently devoid of hospital clinical 
4:81:5555:25:25:72:541:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:experience, despite the fact that as early as the 1840s the American Medical Association had indicated the 
4:82:5662:25:26:72:533:659:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:hospital was indispensable in providing training for physicians (Rosenberg 1987, p. 202; Starr 1982, pp. 
4:83:5767:26:25:72:117:633:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:114-116). 
4:84:5777:25:25:72:525:608:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4: While some universities opened small hospitals of their own to provide clinical teaching for at 
4:85:5873:25:25:72:533:583:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:least some of their students, it was not until the 1890s that significant reforms linking medical education 
4:86:5981:25:26:72:538:558:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:to hospitals occurred. In 1893, Johns Hopkins became the first medical school to treat medicine as a field 
4:87:6088:26:25:72:533:532:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:of graduate study, emphasizing science and clinical experience in their training of medical students. The 
4:88:6194:25:25:72:538:507:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:first two years of the four-year program were dedicated to studying science, while the last two were spent 
4:89:6301:25:26:72:496:482:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:in hospital wards. This reform cemented the marriage of physician education to hospital clinical 
4:90:6398:26:25:72:527:456:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:experience, whereas previous medical school students had learned the practice of medicine “... in their 
4:91:6502:25:25:72:354:431:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:preceptor’s office and the patient’s home” (Starr 1982, p. 116).  
4:92:6568:25:25:72:516:406:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4: Following the reforms at Johns Hopkins, the American Medical Association (AMA) and the 
4:93:6655:25:26:72:534:381:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) pushed for stricter entrance requirements and more 
4:94:6754:26:25:72:536:355:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:rigorous courses of study in all medical schools. The changes at Hopkins spurred reforms elsewhere, and 
4:95:6858:25:25:72:540:330:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:by the time Abraham Flexner published his famous indictment of medical education in 1910, the Hopkins 
4:96:6960:25:26:72:470:305:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:model had become the standard for medical education that other schools strove to imitate. 
4:97:7049:26:25:72:520:279:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4: The link between medical education and clinical experience in hospitals ushered in the era of 
4:98:7143:25:25:72:522:254:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:hospital-based medicine. On the supply side, physicians trained in hospitals came to view hospitals as 
4:99:7246:25:26:72:534:229:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:physician workshops, and as the number of physicians trained in hospital settings continued to grow, the 
4:100:7351:26:25:72:525:203:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:shift in medical care from home to hospital began in earnest. Hospitals focused on image-building and 
4:101:7453:25:25:72:502:178:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:customer-service, specializing in obstetrical deliveries, tonsillectomies, and appendectomies—all 
4:102:7551:25:26:72:514:153:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:procedures with usually happy outcomes (Stevens 1989, p. 105). On the demand side, the decline in 
4:103:7649:26:25:72:510:127:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:average family size that occurred with urbanization further spurred the shift as families moved into 
4:104:7750:25:25:72:536:102:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:smaller homes with fewer people left in the home to care for the sick (Vogel 1980, p. 99; Temin 1988, p. 
4:105:7855:25:0:72:539:77:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:83).  Medical discoveries such as the prophylactic treatment of rabies (1885), diphtheria antitoxin (1891), 
5:106:7964:0:25:72:532:709:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:and tests for typhoid (1897) and syphilis (1906) lent a new scientific aura to medicine (Rosenberg 1987, 
5:107:8069:25:25:72:522:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:p. 159). By 1920, American upper- and middle-class families began to accept hospitals as a consumer 
5:108:8169:25:26:72:310:659:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:good, and hospitals catered to this new consumerism. 
5:109:8222:26:25:108:543:633:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:While the shift from home to hospital is well-documented, what is less clear is the extent to which 
5:110:8322:25:25:72:527:608:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:this shift occurred because it benefited practitioners or because it benefited patients. Obstetrical care in 
5:111:8431:25:25:72:509:583:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:particular is a remarkable example of the shift from home to hospital, and an example in which the 
5:112:8530:25:26:72:502:558:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:reasons underlying the shift may not have been due to the fact that women received better care in 
5:113:8628:26:25:72:520:532:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:hospitals than in their homes. In 1900, only five percent of all births occurred in hospitals (Wertz and 
5:114:8733:25:25:72:520:507:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Wertz 1977, p. 133). Particularly in urban areas, the shift from home to hospital occurred quickly. By 
5:115:8836:25:26:72:513:482:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:1935, nearly 75 percent of urban births occurred in hospitals, and nearly all urban births occurred in 
5:116:8939:26:25:72:156:456:121:g_d0_f4:49:g_d0_f4:hospitals by 1950.2
5:117:8958:25:25:108:515:431:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Despite the rapid shift from home birth to hospital birth, Figures 1 and 2 show that maternal 
5:118:9052:25:25:71:542:406:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:mortality remained flat until the mid-1930s, even as death rates among women due to other causes such as 
5:119:9157:25:26:71:528:381:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:respiratory tuberculosis decreased.  Figure 1 shows total, urban (places over 10,000) and rural maternal 
5:120:9262:26:25:71:522:355:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:mortality from 1915-1940. Strikingly, maternal mortality was higher in urban areas than in rural areas 
5:121:9365:25:25:71:526:330:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:until the late 1930s when sulfa drugs became available, even though women in urban areas had greater 
5:122:9466:25:26:71:530:305:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:access to physicians and hospitals. Figure 2 shows the death rate among women for tuberculosis and all 
5:123:9569:26:25:72:506:279:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:causes related to childbirth (puerperal causes) from 1900-1940. While tuberculosis death rates fell 
5:124:9669:25:25:72:529:254:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:throughout the period, maternal mortality did not begin to decline until the 1930s. Ignoring the spike in 
5:125:9775:25:26:72:531:229:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:maternal mortality rates associated with the 1918 influenza epidemic, maternal mortality death rates are 
5:126:9880:26:25:72:518:203:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:essentially flat until the 1930s, even as childbirth increasingly moved from home to hospital over the 
5:127:9983:25:35:72:521:178:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:period.3 Further, infant mortality rates due to birth injuries increased 40-50 percent between 1915 and 
5:128:10087:35:7:72:219:143:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
5:129:10135:7:16:72:536:136:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:2 The transition occurred more slowly in rural areas initially. In 1935, roughly 20 percent of rural births occurred in 
5:130:10254:16:12:71:542:120:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:hospitals. By 1950, over 70 percent of rural births occurred in hospitals, and by the 1960s, it was rare for any birth to 
5:131:10376:12:7:71:399:108:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:occur outside of a hospital (Leavitt 1986, p. 171; Wertz and Wertz 1977 p. 135).  
5:132:10457:7:16:72:535:101:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:3 The spike in 1918 due to influenza occurs because the U.S. classified influenza deaths among pregnant women as 
5:133:10570:16:11:72:525:85:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:due to puerperal causes instead of influenza. When joint causes of death were present, they were coded using the 
5:134:10683:11:0:72:540:74:100:Times:100:Times:Manual of Joint Causes of Death prepared by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. For each cause of death, the Manual of 
6:135:10797:0:25:72:536:709:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:1929 as hospital birthrates increased (White House Conference on Child Health and Protection 1933, pp. 
6:136:10900:25:25:72:120:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:215-217).  
6:137:10911:25:26:72:534:659:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4: It could be argued that the seeming rise (or lack of decline) in maternal mortality rates may have 
6:138:11010:26:25:72:535:633:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:resulted from improved reporting of maternal deaths as time progressed, or because a decline in the birth 
6:139:11116:25:25:72:500:608:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:rate meant that more hazardous first births accounted for a greater share of total births over time. 
6:140:11217:25:25:72:532:583:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:However, neither of these reasons can fully account for the trend in maternal mortality from 1900-1940. 
6:141:11321:25:26:72:525:558:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Improvements in reporting could have led to a seeming increase in maternal mortality for two reasons. 
6:142:11423:26:25:72:526:532:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:First, states with higher mortality rates may have been admitted to the U.S. death registration area later 
6:143:11530:25:25:72:519:507:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:than states with lower rates. As these higher mortality states were admitted, the U.S. overall maternal 
6:144:11634:25:26:72:540:482:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:mortality rate would increase. While plausible, it does not appear to be the case that an increasing number 
6:145:11742:26:25:72:533:456:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:of states admitted to the death registration area was responsible for the trend in maternal mortality. Even 
6:146:11850:25:25:72:537:431:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:in those states that were in the death registration area in 1900, maternal mortality did not decline over the 
6:147:11960:25:25:72:501:406:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:period. Figure 3 shows the essentially flat trend until the 1930s in Massachusetts, a state that had 
6:148:12061:25:26:72:515:381:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:collected maternal mortality data since 1850. Further, international comparisons, shown in Figure 4, 
6:149:12162:26:25:72:529:355:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:reveal that both England and Sweden had flat or rising maternal mortality rates during the same period, 
6:150:12266:25:25:72:452:330:121:g_d0_f4:49:g_d0_f4:even though they possessed fairly accurate vital statistics data (Loudon 1992, p. 240).4
6:151:12354:25:26:72:529:305:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4: Another reason why the increase in maternal mortality in the early twentieth century may be an 
6:152:12449:26:25:72:526:279:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:artifact of the data is that there may have been a tendency on the part of physicians to misreport deaths 
6:153:12555:25:25:72:532:254:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:from puerperal fever in order to avoid blame (Loudon 1992, pp. 35-36). While such deaths were usually 
6:154:12656:25:26:72:524:229:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:classified as due to another puerperal cause such as hemorrhage, so that the overall maternal mortality 
6:155:12759:26:37:72:517:203:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:rate would be the same, some doctors may have coded deaths from puerperal infection as due to non-
6:156:12857:37:12:72:542:166:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                                                                                                                             
6:157:13013:12:11:72:541:154:100:Times:100:g_d0_f4:Joint Causes tells what other causes are “preferred” and should be listed as the primary cause if both are present. For 
6:158:13133:11:7:72:501:143:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:example, puerperal septicemia as a primary cause took precedence over tuberculosis, but not over syphilis. 
6:159:13240:7:16:72:528:136:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:4 A note of caution when looking at this figure: the levels are difficult to compare because of differences between 
6:160:13356:16:12:72:542:120:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:countries in classifying deaths due to joint causes (for example, Sweden and England coded joint deaths in which the 
6:161:13473:12:11:72:536:108:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:mother had influenza as due to influenza, not due to puerperal causes as was done in the U.S., so that the U.S. has a 
6:162:13591:11:12:72:523:97:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:spike in maternal mortality during the influenza epidemic that is not seen in international data).  A study done in 
6:163:13707:12:11:72:541:85:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:1927 found that the rates in England and Sweden would be higher if classified using the American method, although 
6:164:13821:11:0:72:267:74:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the rank order would be the same (Tandy 1935). 
7:165:13869:0:25:72:537:709:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:childbirth related causes. As the quality of vital statistics reporting improved over time, these deaths may 
7:166:13978:25:25:72:524:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:have been more accurately reported, so that maternal mortality seemed to increase. These effects were 
7:167:14080:25:26:72:534:659:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:undoubtedly present, but probably small and not large enough to obscure the overall trend, especially by 
7:168:14184:26:25:72:541:633:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the 1920s. In a 1917 study that investigated maternal mortality in the U.S. and examined the quality of the 
7:169:14292:25:25:72:528:608:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:data, Meigs states, “... it is safe to say that any marked decrease in the actual death rate from childbirth 
7:170:14401:25:25:72:510:583:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:during the last 13 years could not have been masked by “the improvement in reporting deaths from 
7:171:14497:25:26:72:209:558:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:childbirth (Meigs 1917, p. 18). 
7:172:14529:26:25:72:520:532:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4: Even if the data were accurately reported, it may be that maternal mortality failed to decrease 
7:173:14625:25:25:72:522:507:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:over this period because a decline in the birth rate meant that more hazardous first births (primiparity) 
7:174:14731:25:26:72:541:482:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:increased as a share of total births. While it is true that first births are more hazardous than second or third 
7:175:14844:26:25:72:538:456:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:births, it is also true that grand multiparity (four or more births) is more hazardous as well (Loudon 1992, 
7:176:14953:25:25:72:497:431:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:p. 242). If birth rates were declining, then primiparity was increasing, but grand multiparity was 
7:177:15052:25:25:72:526:406:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:decreasing. Thus, the increased risk of maternal mortality associated with higher primiparity may have 
7:178:15155:25:26:72:538:381:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:been offset by the decreased risk of maternal mortality associated with lower grand multiparity. Statistics 
7:179:15263:26:25:72:532:355:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:available from 1920-1940 suggest that as the total birth rate per 1,000 women aged 10-54 fell from 72.6 
7:180:15367:25:25:72:517:330:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:births to 52.3 births, the percentage of first births as a share of total births rose from 29 percent to 37 
7:181:15475:25:26:72:522:305:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:percent. At the same time, the share of fourth and subsequent births fell from 35 percent to 24 percent 
7:182:15579:26:25:72:540:279:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:(Linder and Grove 1947, Table 48, Table XIV-A). Given that the decrease in grand multiparity more than 
7:183:15682:25:25:72:515:254:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:offsets the increase in primiparity as a share of total births, it seems unlikely that the overall trend in 
7:184:15790:25:26:72:331:229:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:maternal mortality can be attributed to changes in fertility. 
7:185:15852:26:25:72:529:203:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4: The data clearly suggest, then, that maternal mortality was not decreasing over the period 1900-
7:186:15948:25:25:72:535:178:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:1940 even as hospital birth rates increased. If, ostensibly, one of the primary reasons underlying the shift 
7:187:16057:25:26:72:539:153:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:from home to hospital birth was that hospitals provided greater safety for women and infants during labor 
7:188:16163:26:25:72:538:127:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:and childbirth, why was this effect not seen in declining maternal mortality rates? Several historians have 
7:189:16271:25:25:72:506:102:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:argued that stagnant maternal mortality rates and rising rates of infant mortality due to birth injury 
7:190:16374:25:0:72:527:77:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:occurred as a result of increased operative intervention on the part of practitioners as birth moved from 
8:191:16480:0:25:72:539:709:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the home to the hospital, combined with a lack of set standards for the practice of obstetrics. Unnecessary 
8:192:16587:25:25:72:542:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:intervention may have led to excess maternal deaths for a number of reasons. A primary cause of maternal 
8:193:16692:25:26:72:530:659:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:mortality was puerperal septicemia, and increased operative intervention in the form of version, forceps 
8:194:16797:26:25:72:509:633:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:delivery and cesarean section all increased the likelihood of such an infection. Complications from 
8:195:16896:25:25:72:525:608:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:anesthesia could also lead to maternal death. How preventable was maternal death in this period? Two 
8:196:16997:25:25:72:527:583:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:studies in the early 1930s claimed that between half and two-thirds of maternal deaths could have been 
8:197:17100:25:26:72:528:558:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:prevented by better training of the attendants (White House Conference on Child Health and Protection 
8:198:17202:26:25:72:505:532:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:1933; New York Academy of Medicine 1933 p. 213). If these arguments are correct, then modern 
8:199:17295:25:25:72:521:507:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:medicine may have actually increased the number of maternal deaths due to childbirth than otherwise 
8:200:17395:25:26:72:170:482:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:would have occurred. 
8:201:17416:26:25:108:511:456:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:This paper uses a panel of city-level data over the period 1927-1940 to examine the shift of 
8:202:17509:25:25:72:515:431:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:childbirth from home to hospital and to analyze whether or not medical care contributed to maternal 
8:203:17609:25:25:72:518:406:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:mortality. Results indicate that medical care generated a slight increase in maternal mortality prior to 
8:204:17714:25:26:72:532:381:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:1937, and a slightly larger decrease after 1937 when sulfa drugs became available. The remainder of the 
8:205:17818:26:25:72:534:355:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the background and history of childbirth in the United

8:210:18112:25:26:72:529:229:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4: Before 1750, women controlled childbirth.  Typically, a pregnant woman entering confinement 
8:211:18204:26:25:72:528:203:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:requested the attendance of a midwife and several close friends and relatives who would aid her during 
8:212:18306:25:25:72:537:178:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the process of childbirth in her home. The technology of childbirth was relatively simple; midwives were

9:217:18840:0:25:72:536:709:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:showed that “... an important part of women’s experience of childbirth was their anticipation of dying or 
9:218:18946:25:25:72:369:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:being permanently injured during the event” (Leavitt 1986, p. 14).  
9:219:19013:25:26:72:503:659:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4: Medical intervention during childbirth, even the presence of a physician during labor and 
9:220:19103:26:25:72:541:633:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:delivery, was rare until after 1750, when men trained as physicians abroad returned to practice in America 
9:221:19210:25:25:72:531:608:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:(Wertz and Wertz 1977, p. 29). Physicians trained in the “new midwifery” in Europe brought forceps to 
9:222:19312:25:25:72:539:583:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the United States, offering middle- and upper-class women an alternative to traditional, midwife-attended 
9:223:19418:25:26:71:540:558:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:childbirth.5 The fear of childbirth led women to invite physicians (and their promises of greater safety and 
9:224:19527:26:25:72:533:532:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:less pain) into the birthing room (Leavitt 1986, pp. 37-38). With forceps, physicians could assist women 
9:225:19632:25:25:72:538:507:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:in difficult births, or hasten slow deliveries. Technological developments such as with the introduction of 
9:226:19740:25:26:72:537:482:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:ergot (a drug used to cause uterine contractions), and the advent of pain-relieving drugs such as ether and 
9:227:19848:26:25:72:535:456:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:chloroform also provided physicians with an aura of science that led more and more women to choose to 
9:228:19950:25:25:72:533:431:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:have physician-attended births. General practitioners were eager to accommodate women.  They viewed 
9:229:20050:25:25:72:533:406:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:childbirth as central to their attempts to build a practice, given that successful births led to more patients 
9:230:20161:25:26:72:542:381:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:(Wertz and Wertz 1977, p. 67) At the same time, midwives, most of whom were without formal education 
9:231:20262:26:25:72:511:355:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:and who lacked professional organization, gradually attended fewer and fewer births as the century 
9:232:20360:25:25:72:125:330:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:progressed. 
9:233:20372:25:26:72:541:305:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4: The idea that physician-attended deliveries were in fact safer was not necessarily true; while there 
9:234:20473:26:25:72:540:279:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:are no records of epidemics of puerperal fever in America during the 18th century, puerperal fever became 
9:235:20579:25:25:72:507:254:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:more common in America after 1840, perhaps because of increasing physician intervention during 
9:236:20674:25:26:72:522:229:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:childbirth (Wertz and Wertz 1977, p. 119). Regardless, by the end of the nineteenth century nearly 50 
9:237:20776:26:25:72:520:203:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:percent of all births were physician-attended, although the majority still occurred in women’s homes. 
9:238:20878:25:25:72:537:178:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Most middle-and upper-class white women were attended by physicians in their homes during childbirth,

9:241:21131:7:16:72:539:113:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:5 An Englishman named Peter Chamberlen is believed to have invented forceps in the early 17th century. The device 
9:242:21245:16:12:71:517:97:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:consisted of “... two enlarged spoons with handles” that could be joined and locked together. The Chamberlen 
9:243:21354:12:11:71:522:85:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:family kept the device a secret for over 100 years, so that they were not widely used until after 1800 (Wertz and

10:245:21520:0:25:72:541:709:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:births that occurred in hospitals were those of homeless women or women who could not receive in-home

10:249:21678:25:25:72:502:608:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4: After the turn of the century, the shift from home to hospital began in earnest, although it 
10:250:21771:25:25:72:532:583:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:occurred slowly at first. A Children’s Bureau study conducted in Baltimore in 1915 sheds some light on 
10:251:21874:25:26:72:540:558:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:trends in urban areas. By 1915, the percentage of births attended by physicians had increased, and women 
10:252:21979:26:25:72:532:532:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:were more likely to deliver in hospitals (Rochester 1923, pp. 212-213). However, as shown in Tables 1a 
10:253:22082:25:25:72:542:507:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:and 1b, the percentage of women attended by physicians and delivering in hospitals varied widely by both 
10:254:22186:25:26:72:528:482:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:income and nationality of mother. Table 1a shows that physician-attended births in Baltimore hospitals 
10:255:22289:26:25:72:507:456:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:were highest among families where the father reported no earnings and among the highest-earning 
10:256:22385:25:25:72:528:431:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:fathers. Middle-class families were more likely to deliver at home while being attended by a physician, 
10:257:22489:25:25:72:541:406:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:while midwives generally limited their services to middle- and lower-income families. Table 1b illustrates 
10:258:22596:25:26:72:507:381:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the fact that foreign-born mothers in Baltimore were more likely to use midwives than native-born 
10:259:22694:26:25:72:542:355:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:mothers, usually because of a reluctance to admit men into the birthing room. Only 27.4 percent of infants 
10:260:22801:25:25:72:522:330:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:born to white, native-born mothers were delivered by midwives in 1915, while midwives attended the 
10:261:22900:25:26:72:287:305:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:births of over 77 percent of Italian-born women.

10:267:23304:25:26:72:533:153:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:centered practices, and the disappearance of the midwife as an alternative to physician-attended birth all 
10:268:23411:26:25:72:344:127:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:played a role in the transition of birth from home to hospital.  
10:269:23476:25:25:108:526:102:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:By the turn of the century, reforms in medical education were well underway. The impetus for 
10:270:23569:25:0:72:494:77:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:reform stemmed from the success of the Johns Hopkins model and the willingness of American 
11:271:23661:0:25:72:528:709:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:philanthropists to fund improvements in medical science and education.6 However, the chief proponent 
11:272:23762:25:25:71:527:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:for change became the newly restructured and more powerful American Medical Association (AMA).7 
11:273:23857:25:26:72:516:659:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:The AMA recognized the fact that improving standards would not only lead to additional funding of 
11:274:23955:26:25:72:522:633:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:medical school endowments and improvements in the quality of medical care, but would also serve to 
11:275:24054:25:25:72:531:608:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:reduce the number of medical practitioners at a time when many physicians were struggling financially. 
11:276:24157:25:25:72:516:583:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:The problem of “overcrowding” in the profession was referred to in several articles at the turn of the 
11:277:24260:25:26:72:512:558:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:century. A Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) editorial written in October, 1901 
11:278:24357:26:25:72:533:532:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:stated, “It is evident from the census statistics that we must be rapidly approaching the limit of additions 
11:279:24466:25:25:72:506:507:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:to the medical profession if the individual members are to find the practice of medicine a lucrative 
11:280:24567:25:26:72:291:482:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:occupation” (JAMA, October 26, 1901, p. 1119).  
11:281:24615:26:25:107:531:456:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Regardless of motive, the reforms in medical education that occurred in the first two decades of 
11:282:24712:25:25:71:533:431:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the twentieth century influenced the shift in childbirth from home to hospital in two ways. First, reforms 
11:283:24819:25:25:71:541:406:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:in medical education focused on the close incorporation of hospitals with physician education. Prior to the 
11:284:24927:25:26:71:519:381:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:twentieth century, most physicians had little clinical experience in hospitals. Even before the Flexner 
11:285:25031:26:25:71:526:355:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Report was published in 1910, medical reformers recognized the need for a close tie between hospitals 
11:286:25133:25:25:71:520:330:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:and medical training.8 Thus, increasing numbers of physicians were routinely trained in hospitals and 
11:287:25235:25:26:71:510:305:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:came to view hospitals as workshops in which they could use the latest medical technologies. With 
11:288:25333:26:25:71:542:279:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:respect to childbirth, hospitals enabled physicians to use technologies that may have been more difficult at 
11:289:25442:25:30:71:526:254:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:home. For example, physicians often had physical difficulty utilizing forceps in the home birthing bed,

11:291:25594:8:16:72:505:216:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:6 Stevens notes that endowments to medical schools rose as educational standards increased. She quotes the 
11:292:25701:16:11:71:533:200:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:president of Harvard in 1907 as stating “Gentlemen, the way to get endowment for medicine is to improve medical 
11:293:25813:11:7:71:466:189:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:education.” American Medical Association Bulletin, 1907, p. 263, quoted by Stevens 1971, p. 60.  
11:294:25910:7:16:72:536:182:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:7The growth in AMA membership over the time period is striking. While the reorganization of the AMA in 1913 to 
11:295:26021:16:12:71:534:166:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:include all members in good standing with local medical societies makes it difficult to compare AMA membership 
11:296:26132:12:11:71:536:154:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:over time, Burrow notes that by comparing the number of AMA fellows (members who were in good standing with 
11:297:26240:11:12:71:530:143:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:a local society, actually applied for AMA membership, subscribed to the Journal and paid the annual fee) with the 
11:298:26354:12:11:71:537:131:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:number of members before 1913 allows for nearly parallel comparisons. Total fellows in the AMA in 1920 equaled 
11:299:26464:11:7:71:494:120:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:47,045 (of total membership of 83,338), compared to 8,401 members in 1900  (Burrow 1963, pp. 49-50). 
11:300:26565:7:16:72:533:113:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:8 Some philanthropists encouraged the development of ties between medical schools and hospitals. Markowitz and 
11:301:26676:16:12:71:504:97:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Rosner (1973) note several incidences where philanthropists and other industrialists “... attempted to foster 
11:302:26786:12:11:71:536:85:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:consolidation of the medical school and hospital by giving money with certain substantial strings attached,” usually 
11:303:26903:11:0:71:421:74:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:requiring hospitals to allow medical schools to use their facilities for teaching (p. 103). 
12:304:26997:0:25:72:523:709:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:and some types of anesthesia were best administered in a hospital environment. Further, an increasing 
12:305:27099:25:25:72:532:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:awareness of the importance of a germ-free environment to prevent puerperal fever led doctors to prefer 
12:306:27203:25:26:72:339:659:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:hospital-based over home-based childbirth (Leavitt p. 177).  
12:307:27264:26:25:108:533:633:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:In addition to being more comfortable practicing in a hospital setting, physicians also found that 
12:308:27363:25:25:72:535:608:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:centralizing childbirth in hospitals was more convenient and perhaps more lucrative. They no longer had 
12:309:27467:25:25:72:525:583:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:to carry their equipment and travel great distances to women’s homes to attend labor and delivery, and 
12:310:27570:25:26:72:535:558:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:hospitals provided trained nurses to assist doctors during delivery (Wertz and Wertz 1977, p. 144; Vogel 
12:311:27675:26:25:72:526:532:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:1980, pp. 102-103). In addition, hospital-centered practices may have allowed doctors to increase their 
12:312:27779:25:25:72:503:507:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:incomes. Doctors could see more patients than they could if they traveled to patient’s houses, and 
12:313:27878:25:26:72:494:482:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:hospitals enabled them to do more complicated (and more expensive) procedures. The idea that 
12:314:27971:26:25:72:517:456:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:physicians may have used excessive intervention to increase their incomes is in line with the modern 
12:315:28072:25:25:72:539:431:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:theory of “supplier-induced demand.” For example, Gruber and Owings (1996) found that the decrease in 
12:316:28174:25:25:72:531:406:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:fertility that occurred from 1970-1982 led obstetricians to substitute normal childbirth with more highly 
12:317:28280:25:26:71:538:381:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:compensated cesarean deliveries.  Two studies published much earlier are also suggestive of the presence 
12:318:28385:26:25:71:520:355:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:of supplier-induced demand. A 1915 Children’s Bureau study found that physicians used forceps (for 
12:319:28484:25:25:71:534:330:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:which they were reimbursed more) in only 4.3 percent of births in families with fathers earning less than 
12:320:28590:25:26:71:538:305:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:$450, compared to 14.2 percent of births in families with earnings over $1,850 (Woodbury 1925, p. 236). 
12:321:28694:26:25:71:541:279:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Similarly, results from the National Health Survey of 1935-1936 found that the cesarean birth rates varied 
12:322:28801:25:25:71:541:254:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:from a low of 1.4 percent among those families on relief to 3.7 percent among those women with a family 
12:323:28904:25:26:71:503:229:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:income of $2,000 or more. Even more striking, the percentage of hospitalized women undergoing 
12:324:28998:26:25:71:523:203:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:episiotomy ranged from a low of 25 percent among relief families to nearly 50 percent among women 
12:325:29096:25:25:71:346:178:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:with family income over $2,000. (Goddard 1941, pp. 44-45).  
12:326:29156:25:26:107:541:153:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:The second reason reforms in medical education helped to foster the shift in childbirth from home 
12:327:29254:26:25:71:517:127:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:to hospital was that they were part of a larger effort by the AMA to increase the level of professional 
12:328:29358:25:25:71:521:102:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:organization and status among physicians, activities that may have in turn reduced the number of non-
12:329:29459:25:0:71:510:77:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:physician practitioners (such as midwives) that were available as alternatives to physician-attended 
13:330:29562:0:25:72:509:709:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:childbirth. As the scope of medical knowledge broadened, greater numbers of physicians sought to 
13:331:29659:25:25:72:522:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:specialize in an area of medicine rather than practice as generalists.9 State licensing requirements rose 
13:332:29765:25:26:72:491:659:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:with increasing standards in medical education, and physicians resisted efforts by non-medical 
13:333:29860:26:25:72:529:633:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:competitors to treat patients (Stevens 1971, p. 99-100). The desire to reform obstetrics education and to 
13:334:29966:25:25:72:536:608:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:raise the status of obstetricians led some physicians to call for the elimination of the midwife. Physicians 
13:335:30075:25:25:72:533:583:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:may have felt threatened economically by midwives, who typically received one-half the fee charged by 
13:336:30176:25:26:72:518:558:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:physicians for performing obstetrics services (Litoff 1978, p. 73; Chapin 1923, p. 77).  Further, some 
13:337:30279:26:25:72:533:532:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:suggested that midwives took teaching opportunities away from medical students, particularly midwives 
13:338:30381:25:25:72:528:507:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:who worked on charity cases.  Accordingly, many physicians regarded midwives as inferior substitutes 
13:339:30482:25:26:72:522:482:121:g_d0_f4:121:Times:and blamed them for high rates of maternal mortality. A physician writing in the American Journal of 
13:340:30583:26:25:72:357:456:121:Times:121:g_d0_f4:Obstetrics and Diseases of Women and Children in 1911 stated: 
13:341:30645:25:13:108:539:431:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:...40 to 50 per cent. of the births in the large cities of this country are attended by midwives who, 
13:342:30747:13:12:108:515:418:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:except in some rare instances, are ignorant, untrained, incompetent women, and some of the 
13:343:30838:12:13:108:527:406:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:results of their obstetric incompetence are unnecessary deaths and blindness of the infants, and 
13:344:30935:13:12:108:536:393:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:unavoidable invalidism, suffering and deaths of the mothers...the gist of the matter is that one or 
13:345:31035:12:13:108:539:381:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:two things must be done with the midwife—she must be eliminated or educated and placed under 
13:346:31128:13:13:108:264:368:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:state control. (Edgar 1911, p. 881). 
13:347:31165:13:25:108:111:355:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4: 
13:348:31165:25:25:108:542:330:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Indeed, there is little disagreement that untrained midwives contributed to high maternal mortality 
13:349:31264:25:26:72:504:305:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:rates. However, it is not clear that trained midwives were any more hazardous than poorly trained 
13:350:31362:26:25:72:512:279:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:physicians, especially since the maternal mortality rate did not fall as fewer and fewer women were 
13:351:31462:25:25:72:525:254:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:delivered by midwives over time.  Speaking in 1911 to the New York Academy of Medicine about the 
13:352:31559:25:26:72:528:229:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:“midwife problem”, a New York physician noted that “... much that is said to-night concerning the evil 
13:353:31662:26:25:72:526:203:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:results of midwife practice here in New York, can be said—even to a higher degree—of the physician. 
13:354:31762:25:25:72:540:178:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:The poorly trained physician does far more harm than the midwife, as is abundantly shown by the various 
13:355:31866:25:21:72:484:153:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:hospital records as well as by the records of the Board of Health” (Lobenstine 1911, p. 879).  
13:356:31960:21:8:72:219:132:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
13:357:32008:8:16:72:534:124:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:9 Only 23 percent of medical students graduating in 1915 went on to practice solely as general practitioners. Thirty-
13:358:32125:16:11:71:540:108:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:six percent developed a specialist interest, while 41 percent limited themselves entirely to a specialty (Stevens 1971, 
13:359:32245:11:12:71:527:97:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:p. 116). As more physicians became specialists, specialists sought to organize and delineate their specialties. The 
13:360:32361:12:11:71:538:85:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:American College of Surgeons (ACS) was founded in 1912 to standardize surgical quality and to openly distinguish 
13:361:32474:11:0:71:462:74:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:between “quality” surgeons and other surgical practitioners. Other specialties soon followed suit. 
14:362:32575:0:25:108:516:709:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Some physicians and public health officials were actually in favor of training and regulating 
14:363:32669:25:25:71:528:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:midwives to reduce maternal mortality. Midwife proponents pointed to the much lower puerperal death 
14:364:32769:25:26:71:514:659:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:rates experienced by some European countries that relied almost exclusively on trained midwives to 
14:365:32868:26:25:71:535:633:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:deliver pregnant women. Mothers in Sweden and England relied more extensively on midwives than did 
14:366:32967:25:25:71:525:608:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:mothers in the U.S., and midwives in these countries were better trained and regulated (Loudon 1992). 
14:367:33069:25:25:71:527:583:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Despite the much greater number of births delivered at home, both England and Sweden realized much 
14:368:33168:25:26:71:427:558:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:lower levels of maternal mortality than the United States, as shown in Figure 4.  
14:369:33250:26:25:108:525:532:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:In America, further evidence of the ability of trained midwives to reduce maternal mortality is 
14:370:33346:25:25:71:533:507:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:given by the example of the Kentucky Frontier Nursing Service, founded by Mary Breckinridge, a nurse 
14:371:33447:25:26:71:541:482:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:who later trained as a midwife in England. In the Frontier Nursing Service, more than 30 nurses trained as 
14:372:33554:26:25:71:541:456:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:midwives in England and then provided midwifery services to families in rural Kentucky. Over the period 
14:373:33658:25:25:71:523:431:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:1925-1937, the nurse-midwives delivered 3,000 babies. Physicians were called in to perform cesarean 
14:374:33758:25:25:71:524:406:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:sections 6 times, and forceps were used only 14 times. The maternal mortality rate associated with the 
14:375:33861:25:26:71:536:381:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Frontier Nursing Service over the period was 6.8 deaths per 10,000 births, in contrast to 56-68 deaths per 
14:376:33968:26:25:71:527:355:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:10,000 births for the U.S. as a whole, and 80-90 deaths per 10,000 births for white women delivered in 
14:377:34071:25:25:71:509:330:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:hospitals in Lexington. (Dye 1983, pp. 501-502). New York City and New Jersey also experienced 
14:378:34166:25:26:71:516:305:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:significant declines in infant mortality after implementing midwife training and regulatory programs 
14:379:34267:26:25:71:166:279:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:(Litoff 1978, p. 93).  
14:380:34290:25:25:108:512:254:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Despite the efforts of midwifery proponents, the percentage of births attended by midwives 
14:381:34381:25:26:71:522:229:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:decreased from 50 to 12.5 percent over the period 1900 to 1935 (Loudon 1992, p.298).10 The absolute 
14:382:34481:26:25:71:520:203:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:number of midwives declined from 7.39 midwives per 100,000 people in 1900 to 2.90 per 100,000 in 
14:383:34578:25:25:71:534:178:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:1930. This trend was particularly pronounced in large cities. Southern states reported greater numbers of 
14:384:34684:25:56:71:430:153:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:midwives throughout the period, and lower levels of decline, as seen in Figure 5.

14:386:34814:7:16:72:540:90:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:10 In New Jersey, 42 percent of births were attended by midwives in 1918, compared to less than 19 percent in 1930. 
14:387:34930:16:0:72:421:74:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:By 1930, 80 percent of midwives were in the rural South (Stevens 1971, pp. 100, 180). 
15:388:35018:0:25:108:540:709:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Efforts by physicians to discredit the midwife profession were likely responsible for at least some 
15:389:35118:25:25:71:530:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:of this decrease, as physicians regarded midwives as a “... temporary stopgap until all patients could be 
15:390:35224:25:26:71:537:659:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:delivered by physicians” (Stevens 1971, p. 180). States began to pass laws to regulate midwives over this 
15:391:35330:26:25:71:533:633:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:period, and one state (Massachusetts) even outlawed midwifery (Litoff 1986, p. 9).11 Overall, these laws 
15:392:35435:25:25:72:531:608:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:did little to reduce the number of midwives as they were fairly lenient and poorly enforced.  There were 
15:393:35540:25:25:72:514:583:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:many other factors that contributed to the decline of midwives (Litoff 1986, pp. 9-10). In contrast to 
15:394:35643:25:26:72:521:558:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:physicians, midwives were not professionally organized, and given that many midwives were women 
15:395:35739:26:25:72:529:532:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:who attended blacks and immigrants, they may have lacked a political voice. Midwife proponents were 
15:396:35839:25:25:72:522:507:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:less organized than opponents, and the demand for midwife services also fell as immigration declined

15:402:36224:26:25:72:511:355:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:alternatives doubtlessly contributed to the shift of birth from the home to the hospital, demand-side 
15:403:36326:25:25:72:541:330:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:factors also played a role. Some women may have simply preferred hospital births over home births. With 
15:404:36429:25:26:72:530:305:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:technological advances in anesthesia, more and more women turned away from midwives and turned to 
15:405:36527:26:25:72:537:279:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:physicians who could administer anesthetics during labor and delivery. As hospitals shifted their focus to 
15:406:36634:25:25:72:539:254:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:customer-service, they offered women greater comfort and assistance than women could receive at home. 
15:407:36736:25:26:72:508:229:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Trained nurses could assist women, and lengthy hospital stays permitted women to rest and escape 
15:408:36833:26:48:72:538:203:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:household duties.12 Safety concerns also prompted women to adhere to their physician’s advice regarding

15:411:37098:16:7:72:454:131:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:50 percent of all births. By 1910, midwives attended less than 10 percent (Chapin 1923, p. 77). 
15:412:37194:7:16:72:518:124:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:12 Even after a nursing shortage following World War II shortened obstetrical length of stays in hospitals, ward 
15:413:37307:16:11:72:517:108:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:patients stayed an average of two weeks post-partum, and private, paying patients often stayed as long as three 
15:414:37419:11:12:71:523:97:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:weeks, perhaps they “...appreciated the efficiency of transferring to an institution the whole daily round of care,

16:417:37763:0:25:72:531:709:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:hospitals. Childbirth in the early twentieth-century was hazardous; a 1917 report noted that childbirth in 
16:418:37870:25:25:72:531:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:1913 caused more deaths among women 15 to 44 years old than any disease except tuberculosis (Meigs 
16:419:37969:25:26:72:523:659:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:1917, p. 7). Advertisements in popular women’s magazines trumpeted the virtues of hospital births by 
16:420:38070:26:25:72:537:633:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:proclaiming that “...motherhood is easier and far safer due... to the modern hospital and the great strides 
16:421:38178:25:25:72:516:608:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:made in obstetrics” (Ladies’ Home Journal, September 1930, p. 83). Advertisements also frequently 
16:422:38276:25:25:71:529:583:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:touted their products as those used by “hospital leaders” and as “hospital-safe” (Ladies’ Home Journal, 
16:423:38380:25:26:72:179:558:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:February 1932, p. 120). 
16:424:38404:26:25:108:531:532:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:While doctors’ advice, comfort, convenience, and supposedly greater safety played a role in the 
16:425:38500:25:25:72:533:507:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:shift from home to hospital birth, the availability of anesthesia also contributed to a growing demand for 
16:426:38607:25:26:72:511:482:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:hospital birth. The advent of pain relieving drugs and techniques, notably “Twilight Sleep” in 1914 
16:427:38706:26:25:72:535:456:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:(Leavitt 1986, p. 130 and Wertz and Wertz 1977, p.150), likely played a large part in convincing women 
16:428:38809:25:25:72:529:431:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:that hospitals were more comfortable than homes for delivering a child. Although ether and chloroform 
16:429:38910:25:25:72:517:406:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:had been used since the mid-1800s, they were far from ideal. Induction and recovery were slow with 
16:430:39009:25:26:72:521:381:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:ether, and while women were induced much faster using chloroform, it carried higher risks of cardiac 
16:431:39110:26:25:72:539:355:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:complications (Rushman, Davies, Atkinson 1996, pp. 23-26). Most other drugs could not be administered 
16:432:39212:25:25:72:420:330:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:until late in labor, so that women still experienced pain (Leavitt 1986, p. 127).  
16:433:39295:25:26:107:522:305:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:An advance in the early twentieth-century opened the door for greater anesthetic possibilities. 
16:434:39391:26:25:72:537:279:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Unlike earlier methods, “twilight sleep” involved the administration of the amnesiac scopolamine, which 
16:435:39495:25:25:72:532:254:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:did not relieve pain but rather prevented women from remembering the painful experience. Pioneered in 
16:436:39597:25:26:72:507:229:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Germany, U.S. physicians were reluctant to use twilight sleep since they were unsure of its safety. 
16:437:39697:26:25:72:533:203:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Complications included delayed labor, and infant respiratory depression (Sandelowski 1984, pp. 11-15). 
16:438:39800:25:25:72:513:178:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Women sometimes had to be restrained during its use, making the hospital the preferable setting for 
16:439:39900:25:26:72:522:153:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:delivery (Sandelowski 1984, p. 16).  By slowing labor and incapacitating women, twilight sleep often 
16:440:40001:26:30:72:495:127:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:required obstetrical interventions such as the administration of Pituitrin (a drug used to increase

16:443:40372:11:0:72:184:74:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:they needed (1986, p. 175). 
17:444:40402:0:25:72:487:709:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:contractions) and the applications of forceps to deliver infants. Despite its drawbacks, women 
17:445:40497:25:25:72:516:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:campaigned vigorously for its adoption. Proponents of twilight sleep included many wealthy society 
17:446:40595:25:26:72:522:659:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:women, including Mrs. John Jacob Astor, whose picture appeared in newspaper articles endorsing the 
17:447:40694:26:25:72:509:633:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:method (Leavitt 1986, pp. 131-33; Wertz and Wertz 1977, pp. 150-54). While the popularity of the 
17:448:40791:25:25:72:518:608:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Twilight Sleep method faded somewhat after 1915 when a noted advocate died during childbirth, the 
17:449:40889:25:25:72:489:583:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:furor it initially created served to increasingly medicalize childbirth, and to make obstetrics an 
17:450:40988:25:26:72:494:558:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:increasingly surgical specialty that routinely involved anesthesia and instrumental intervention. 
17:451:41086:26:25:108:534:532:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Because of these reasons, increasingly large numbers of American women began to give birth in 
17:452:41180:25:25:72:525:507:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:hospitals. The image of hospitals as safer places to give birth, however, is little supported by empirical 
17:453:41287:25:26:72:519:482:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:evidence. Maternal mortality rates were flat and in some cases increasing until the 1930s, and several 
17:454:41390:26:25:72:500:456:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:studies blamed the increase on excessive physician intervention in childbirth.13  As early as 1880 
17:455:41489:25:25:72:499:431:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:physicians were aware of the streptococci bacteria that caused sepsis, often called “child-bed” or 
17:456:41588:25:25:72:542:406:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:“puerperal” fever.  Nevertheless, puerperal septicemia remained a leading killer of women of childbearing 
17:457:41694:25:26:72:529:381:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:age until the mid-1930s, when the anti-infective sulfonamide drugs were developed.14 Women attended 
17:458:41794:26:25:72:532:355:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:by physicians and giving birth in hospitals prior to 1936 may have been at increased risk for septicemia, 
17:459:41900:25:25:72:536:330:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:given that they were much more likely to have some sort of physical intervention. Results from the 1935-
17:460:42004:25:26:72:535:305:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:1936 National Health Survey found that forceps were used “... with two or three times the frequency” in 
17:461:42107:26:32:72:503:279:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:hospital deliveries compared to nonhospitalized deliveries (Goddard 1941, p. 47). One prominent

17:463:42251:8:16:72:536:239:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:13A study conducted by the Children’s Bureau in 1927 and 1928 found that maternal deaths due to puerperal causes 
17:464:42364:16:11:72:525:223:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:were 36 percent higher in urban areas than in rural areas (Maternal Mortality in Fifteen States Children’s Bureau

17:466:42588:12:11:72:530:200:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:puerperal fever remained higher in urban areas than in rural areas. Given the higher incidence of hospital births in 
17:467:42705:11:12:72:501:189:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:urban than rural areas this may suggest that hospitals may have actually increased the risks associated with 
17:468:42814:12:11:72:512:177:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:childbirth. Further evidence is suggested by interracial comparisons: Despite the fact that white mothers were 
17:469:42925:11:12:72:530:166:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:hospitalized with much greater frequency  than nonwhite infants (twice as many white births occurred in hospitals 
17:470:43039:12:11:72:523:154:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:than did nonwhite births), the racial gap in maternal mortality did not widen and even narrowed during this time 
17:471:43152:11:7:72:195:143:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:period (Loudon 1991, p. 299). 
17:472:43182:7:16:72:531:136:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:14 Until sulfa drugs were developed, between 35-55 percent of maternal deaths were due to sepsis. Twenty percent 
17:473:43295:16:12:71:514:120:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:were due to eclampsia, 20 percent due to hemorrhage, with the remainder due to other causes such as abortion 
17:474:43404:12:11:71:516:108:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:(Loudon 1991, p. 34). Dr. Gerhard Domagk described the antibacterial properties of the first sulfa drug (called 
17:475:43515:11:12:71:520:97:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:“Prontosil” in results published in February, 1935. The antibacterial action came from the drug’s sulphonamide 
17:476:43626:12:11:71:535:85:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:compounds, which were generally effective against streptococcal agents, and to a lesser extent against staphyloccal 
17:477:43742:11:0:71:423:74:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:infection. Domagk won the 1939 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for his work. 
18:478:43828:0:25:72:540:709:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:physician, Joseph B. DeLee, recommended the routine use of episiotomy and outlet forceps after sedating 
18:479:43932:25:25:72:514:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:patients with ether and scopolamine. Describing this as the “prophylactic forceps operation,” DeLee 
18:480:44032:25:26:72:538:659:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:stated that the technique was a “...rounded method for relieving pain, supplementing and anticipating the 
18:481:44138:26:25:72:539:633:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:efforts of Nature, reducing the hemorrhage, and preventing and repairing damage” (DeLee 1920, p. 34).15

18:483:44338:25:25:71:509:583:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Drugs slowed delivery and necessitated interventions such as forceps that could transmit infection. 
18:484:44438:25:26:71:533:558:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Physicians who inappropriately applied forceps risked lacerations of the cervix and perineum, as well as 
18:485:44543:26:25:71:193:532:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:infection and hemorrhage.  
18:486:44570:25:25:107:529:507:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Two studies conducted in the early 1930s confirmed the notion that physician interference may 
18:487:44664:25:26:71:537:482:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:have harmed women. A study conducted by the New York Academy of Medicine from 1930-1932 found 
18:488:44758:26:25:71:528:456:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the septicemia death rate to be 1.67 deaths per 1,000 live births in the hospital, but only 0.90 deaths per 
18:489:44866:25:25:71:518:431:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:1,000 live births for infants delivered at home.16 A second study conducted by a subcommittee of the 
18:490:44967:25:25:72:538:406:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:White House Conference on Child Health and Protection also suggested that excessive interference led to 
18:491:45071:25:26:72:527:381:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:increased morbidity and mortality, with the result that “... all the advances in medical knowledge have

18:496:45435:25:25:72:502:254:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:shows that it is not clear that hospitals really led to safer birth outcomes for mothers. However, if 
18:497:45537:25:26:72:539:229:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:hospitals were really actually dangerous for mothers, would more and more women voluntarily give birth 
18:498:45639:26:25:72:533:203:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:in hospitals? In this paper, we seek to statistically examine the link between hospital births and maternal 
18:499:45747:25:25:72:525:178:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:mortality. Loudon (1991) suggests that there are two views that explain differential maternal mortality 
18:500:45850:25:21:72:507:153:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:rates. The first is that “...high mortality is due to poor obstetric practice and low mortality to good

18:502:46002:8:16:72:530:124:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:15 Other doctors such as J. Whitridge Williams believed that DeLee proposed excessive intervention, a debate that 
18:503:46116:16:7:72:341:108:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:played out in medical journals in the 1920s (Leavitt 1986, p. 120).  
18:504:46184:7:16:72:516:101:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:16 Even if cesarean sections are excluded, the hospital maternal mortality rate falls to 1.07—still 18 percentage 
18:505:46298:16:11:72:534:85:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:points higher than the maternal mortality rate associated with home births (New York Academy of Medicine 1933,

19:507:46419:0:25:72:536:709:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:practice” whereas the second is that the underlying causes of high maternal mortality “...can be found in 
19:508:46525:25:25:72:523:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the social, economic, and political conditions of a population” (Loudon 1991, p. 34). By attempting to 
19:509:46628:25:26:72:531:659:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:control for medical inputs as well as the socioeconomic conditions that prevailed at the time, we seek to 
19:510:46734:26:25:72:503:633:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:shed light on the question of whether or not the shift to hospital births actually benefited women.  
19:511:46835:25:25:108:532:608:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:We begin by using city-level data for the period 1927-1940 that allow us to control for different

19:513:47026:25:26:72:540:558:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:capture medical factors that may have impacted maternal mortality rates, we include a control for medical 
19:514:47132:26:25:72:511:532:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:inputs. Ideally, this variable would be measured as the percentage of all births in a city occurring in 
19:515:47236:25:25:72:527:507:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:hospitals; however, it is not possible to construct this variable for every year in the sample. Instead, we 
19:516:47344:25:26:72:524:482:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:use hospital beds per 100,000 population to control for medical inputs. Presumably, cities with greater 
19:517:47448:26:25:72:515:456:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:numbers of hospital beds may have provided greater levels of physician-attended, hospital births for 
19:518:47549:25:25:72:518:431:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:several reasons. First, the costs (both actual costs and travel costs) of using a hospital may have been 
19:519:47654:25:25:72:536:406:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:lower in cities with more hospital beds per 100,000. In addition, if physicians are more likely to locate in 
19:520:47763:25:26:72:534:381:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:areas with greater numbers of hospital beds, then this may have increased the probability that a pregnant 
19:521:47869:26:25:72:529:355:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:woman sought a physician’s assistance during delivery and thus increased her chance of delivering in a 
19:522:47972:25:25:72:112:330:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:hospital. 
19:523:47982:25:26:108:537:305:121:Times:121:g_d0_f4:A priori, it is not clear whether the sign on the estimated coefficient on hospital beds per 100,000 
19:524:48083:26:25:72:528:279:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:should be positive or negative. Clearly, physicians and mothers believed that hospital births were safer. 
19:525:48189:25:25:72:542:254:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Undoubtedly, the lives of some women were saved by the efforts of a physician during difficult births. On 
19:526:48295:25:26:72:529:229:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the other hand, we are aware that excessive medical intervention may have claimed lives.  It is possible 
19:527:48400:26:25:72:501:203:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:that the impact of medical inputs on maternal mortality changed during the period of time we are 
19:528:48497:25:25:72:526:178:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:considering. In particular, with the introduction of sulfa drugs in the spring of 1937, obstetricians were 
19:529:48604:25:33:72:527:153:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:able to more effectively combat puerperal infections.  After sulfa drugs were introduced, doctors could 
19:530:48708:33:7:72:219:120:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
19:531:48756:7:16:72:507:113:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:17 Ideally, we would like a panel of city level data from 1920-1950 to more fully capture the shift, given that 
19:532:48868:16:12:72:536:97:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:maternal mortality already begins to fall in the early 1930s. However, consistent city-level information on hospitals 
19:533:48986:12:11:72:537:85:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:is not available until 1927, and beginning in 1943, only county information is reported on maternal mortality. Thus, 
19:534:49103:11:0:72:249:74:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:we limit ourselves to the 1927-1940 period. 
20:535:49149:0:25:72:516:709:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:intervene with less chance of spreading an infection that would later claim the mother’s life. For this 
20:536:49253:25:25:72:506:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:reason we included a dummy variable indicating observations prior to 1937 as well the interaction 
20:537:49351:25:26:72:527:659:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:between this variable and hospital beds per 100,000 in order to distinguish between pre- and post-1937 
20:538:49453:26:25:71:275:633:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:effects of medical care on maternal mortality. 
20:539:49500:25:25:107:532:608:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:In order to control for socioeconomic characteristics that may have affected maternal health, we 
20:540:49597:25:25:71:500:583:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:include county level measures of education, real income per capita, and race. Construction of the 
20:541:49695:25:26:71:513:558:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:variables is discussed in the data appendix. Education may be important if maternal health practices 
20:542:49796:26:25:71:512:532:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:influenced maternal mortality. For example, educational deficiencies might also have facilitated the 
20:543:49897:25:25:71:525:507:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:continuing influence of superstition, folk remedies, and “lay referral” even when modern medical care 
20:544:49999:25:26:71:535:482:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:and information was available (Beardsley 1987, pp. 32-35). In addition, better educated people appear to 
20:545:50104:26:25:71:509:456:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:be more behaviorally responsive to health-related information than others (Berger and Leigh 1989, 
20:546:50202:25:25:71:521:431:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Kenkel 1991, Meara 2001).  The percent of the population that is illiterate is included as a measure of 
20:547:50306:25:25:71:515:406:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:educational attainment. As a proxy for income, we include real retail sales per capita (Fishback et al 
20:548:50409:25:26:71:529:381:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:2001). Income may be important for several reasons. First, women with higher incomes may have been 
20:549:50508:26:25:71:539:355:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:better nourished and thus better able to withstand childbirth and its potential complications. This suggests 
20:550:50617:25:25:71:521:330:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:that the estimated coefficient on the income variable should be negative. Higher income families may 
20:551:50717:25:26:71:510:305:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:have also been able to obtain better access to medical care. To the extent that medical care lowered 
20:552:50818:26:25:71:539:279:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:maternal mortality, this suggests that the estimated coefficient on the income variable should be negative. 
20:553:50925:25:25:71:525:254:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:However, if medical care did increase the risk of maternal mortality, and to the extent that the hospital 
20:554:51031:25:26:71:528:229:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:beds per 100,000 variable inadequately captures the impact of medical care on maternal mortality, then 
20:555:51134:26:25:71:361:203:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the estimated coefficient on the income variable may be positive. 
20:556:51200:25:25:107:530:178:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:The percentage of the population that is black (also from the census) is included to measure the 
20:557:51297:25:26:71:539:153:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:extent to which racial differences impacted maternal mortality. Finally, women under 16 years of age and 
20:558:51402:26:25:71:529:127:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:women over 35 are at a greater risk for puerperal complications (Cunningham et al 1997, pp. 570-572). 
20:559:51503:25:0:71:533:102:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:As a control for this potential maternal health risk we include variables reflecting females in various age 
21:560:51615:0:25:72:531:709:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:groups as a percentage of women in their childbearing years (ages 15 to 44).  Thus, our basic regression 
21:561:51720:25:26:72:126:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:equation is: 
21:562:51733:26:26:144:341:658:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:MMRBitB = ZBitBα + YBtBθ + [YBtB*ZBitB]π + XBitBβ + eBitB ,  
21:563:51794:26:25:71:529:632:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:where i refers to cities, t refers to years, ZBitB reflects hospital beds per 100,000, YBtB is the dummy variable 
21:564:51908:25:26:72:526:607:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:indicating whether the observation occurred prior to 1937, and XBitB includes the city-year characteristics 
21:565:52016:26:25:71:529:581:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:described above. In some specifications we include state dummies to capture any additional effects that 
21:566:52120:25:25:71:531:556:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:vary across states but were constant over time.  Finally, because it could be the case that cities that were 
21:567:52229:25:26:71:520:531:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:added to the registration areas after 1927 may have had greater levels of maternal mortality and more 
21:568:52331:26:25:71:532:505:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:incomplete registration of maternal deaths as well as infant births, we run a balanced panel consisting of 
21:569:52438:25:25:71:537:480:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:only those cities that were in the sample in the first year (1927) and an unbalanced panel consisting of all 
21:570:52547:25:26:71:532:455:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:cities regardless of when they entered the sample. Table 2 presents summary statistics for the variables.

21:572:52673:25:25:71:542:404:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4: Regression results are reported in Table 3. Looking at the results for the balanced panel in column 
21:573:52773:25:25:71:518:379:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:[1], the estimated coefficient on the beds per 100,000 population variable is negative and statistically 
21:574:52878:25:26:71:538:354:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:significant, suggesting that beginning in 1937, an increase of 100 beds per 100,000 population resulted in 
21:575:52985:26:25:71:502:328:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:10.5 fewer maternal deaths per 100,000 births. The estimated coefficient on the beds per 100,000 
21:576:53082:25:25:71:531:303:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:interaction term is positive and statistically significant, suggesting that prior to 1937, an increase of 100 
21:577:53192:25:26:71:525:278:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:beds per 100,000 population resulted in an increase of about 7 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. 
21:578:53296:26:25:71:526:252:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:These results are consistent with the conjecture that until the late 1930s obstetrical devotion to medical 
21:579:53403:25:25:71:531:227:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:intervention rendered medical care detrimental to the health of women during the birthing process.  The 
21:580:53507:25:26:71:513:202:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:introduction of anti-infective sulfa drugs and improving obstetrics practices enabled obstetricians to 
21:581:53610:26:25:71:519:176:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:prevent injury and combat infections induced by their medical interventions later in the 1930s.TP18PT  The 
21:582:53717:25:31:72:523:151:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:estimated coefficient for the pre-1937 variable indicates that maternal mortality was higher during the 
21:583:53821:31:12:72:219:120:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
21:584:53869:12:11:72:513:108:1:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f4:TP18PT Sulfa drugs were effective against puerperal fever, but not as effective as antibiotics. City-level data are not 
21:585:53989:11:12:72:527:97:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:reported beyond 1943, and antibiotics were not widely produced until 1946. However, state level data run for the 
21:586:54102:12:11:72:507:85:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:period 1937-1950 (not reported here) show that penicillin had an even stronger impact on reducing maternal 
21:587:54209:11:0:72:157:74:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:mortality after 1946. 
22:588:54231:0:25:72:519:709:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:early to mid 1930s than the rest of the period.  Racial differences also appear to have played a role in 
22:589:54336:25:25:72:532:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:maternal mortality; cities with larger black populations had higher levels of maternal mortality. The odd 
22:590:54442:25:26:72:525:659:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:result in the balanced panel is the negative and statistically significant coefficient on the percent of the 
22:591:54551:26:25:72:523:633:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:population that is illiterate. There is speculation in the historical literature that maternal mortality may 
22:592:54660:25:25:72:514:608:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:have been higher among more educated, higher-income women exactly because of the fact that they 
22:593:54756:25:25:72:537:583:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:tended to use hospitals for births, while less educated, lower-income women may have been less likely to 
22:594:54861:25:26:72:160:558:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:deliver in hospitals. 
22:595:54883:26:25:72:540:532:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4: Results for the unbalanced panel are somewhat different. The reason we use the balanced panel is 
22:596:54980:25:25:72:517:507:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:because it may have been the case that cities added to the birth registration area later might have had 
22:597:55084:25:26:72:539:482:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:higher rates of maternal mortality. This is consistent with the summary statistics presented in Table 2; the 
22:598:55193:26:25:72:539:456:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:mean maternal mortality rate for the full sample is 627 deaths per 100,000 births, compared to 598 deaths 
22:599:55299:25:25:72:535:431:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:per 100,000 births. To a large extent, the cities added later were in the South, where hospital quality may 
22:600:55407:25:25:72:530:406:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:have been more dubious than in northern cities, and where blacks in particular had a more difficult time 
22:601:55512:25:26:72:521:381:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:obtaining access to hospitals. Thus, it may not be surprising that the estimated coefficient on beds per 
22:602:55617:26:25:72:523:355:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:100,000 is not statistically significant. However, the interaction term is again positive and statistically 
22:603:55724:25:25:72:538:330:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:significant, suggesting that prior to 1937 medical care may have hindered maternal mortality more than it 
22:604:55830:25:26:72:107:305:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:helped. 
22:605:55838:26:25:72:522:279:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4: We also estimate separate regressions by race over the same period to gauge whether medical 
22:606:55930:25:25:72:522:254:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:care had a differential impact on blacks and whites.19  Blacks, particularly in the South, may have had 
22:607:56034:25:26:72:495:229:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:difficulty gaining access to quality medical care. Black women may have preferred to use black 
22:608:56129:26:25:72:540:203:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:physicians, who were often excluded from good medical schools and residencies, and denied privileges at 
22:609:56233:25:25:72:527:178:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:all but black hospitals or hospitals for the indigent, many of which were unable to keep up with rapidly 
22:610:56338:25:33:72:540:153:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:advancing medical technologies (Smith 1999, p. 21). Even if blacks did not prefer to be attended by black 
22:611:56444:33:7:72:219:120:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:                                                 
22:612:56492:7:16:72:523:113:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:19 The number of observations in the race regressions is significantly lower than for the regressions based on the 
22:613:56607:16:12:72:515:97:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:total population as mortality and birth data were only provided for cities in which the minority population was 
22:614:56719:12:11:72:535:85:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:greater than 10,000 or 10% of the total population.  Also, mortality data by cause of death was not reported by race 
22:615:56836:11:0:72:171:74:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:at the city level in 1938. 
23:616:56865:0:25:72:524:709:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:physicians, they may have been excluded from other hospitals or restricted to segregated facilities that 
23:617:56970:25:25:72:532:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:offered lower quality care, especially in Southern cities (Almond, Chay and Greenstone 2001). If blacks 
23:618:57074:25:26:72:528:659:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:were restricted in their access of medical care, or if they received substandard care, we would expect to 
23:619:57180:26:25:72:532:633:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:see a differential effect of medical care on black maternal mortality relative to white maternal mortality. 
23:620:57288:25:25:72:527:608:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4: Summary statistics by race are provided in Tables 4 and 5. Estimates from the race regressions 
23:621:57383:25:25:72:535:583:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:are provided in Tables 6 and 7.  Overall, results are consistent with those reported in Table 3, suggesting 
23:622:57491:25:26:72:534:558:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:that hospitals had an adverse impact on maternal mortality for both blacks and whites prior to the advent 
23:623:57597:26:25:72:515:532:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:of sulfa drugs. There is however, a differential effect of medical care for blacks compared to whites. 
23:624:57700:25:25:72:500:507:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Results from both the unbalanced and balanced panels show that the estimated coefficient on the 
23:625:57796:25:26:72:506:482:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:beds*pre-1937 interaction term is much larger for blacks than whites, which is consistent with the 
23:626:57895:26:25:72:529:456:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:hypothesis that blacks received lower quality care. Also consistent with this hypothesis is the estimated 
23:627:58001:25:25:72:534:431:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:coefficient on hospital beds per 100,000. For white mothers, improvements in obstetrics practice and the 
23:628:58106:25:25:72:530:406:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:use of sulfa drugs lowers maternal mortality; an increase in hospital beds per 100,000 after 1937 lowers 
23:629:58211:25:26:71:531:381:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:maternal mortality by between 9.5 and 31 deaths per 100,000. For black mothers, medical care does not 
23:630:58313:26:25:71:537:355:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:have a statistically significant effect on maternal mortality after 1937, suggesting that black mothers may 
23:631:58421:25:25:71:326:330:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:have received a lower quality of care than white mothers.

23:635:58511:13:25:71:540:254:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4: Despite the fact that hospital births increased dramatically over the period 1920 to 1950, maternal 
23:636:58611:25:26:72:535:229:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:mortality rates did not decline until the mid-1930s when sulfa drugs were developed. This paper seeks to 
23:637:58716:26:25:72:525:203:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:understand the relationship between medical care and maternal mortality. Did maternal mortality rates 
23:638:58818:25:25:72:514:178:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:remain flat and even increase because of iatrogenic causes? If so, why did women increasingly seek 
23:639:58917:25:26:72:526:153:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:hospital births for their children? Results based on a sample of city-level data from 1927-1940 provide 
23:640:59021:26:25:72:529:127:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:support for the hypothesis that medical intervention prior to the advent of sulfa drugs in 1937 increased 
23:641:59127:25:25:72:539:102:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:maternal mortality rates. From 1927-1936 the number of hospital beds per 100,000 people in a city seems 
23:642:59231:25:0:72:525:77:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:to have increased maternal mortality, albeit very slightly. However, the development of anti-infectives 
24:643:59337:0:25:72:528:709:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:such as sulfa drugs did enable doctors to save mothers’ lives in childbirth. In a sense, these drugs made 
24:644:59443:25:25:72:505:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:medical care more effective by not only directly reducing deaths from puerperal fever, but also by 
24:645:59542:25:26:72:533:659:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:enabling doctors to perform potentially life-saving procedures such as cesarean sections without the risk 
24:646:59648:26:25:72:258:633:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:of subsequent life-threatening infections.  
24:647:59692:25:25:72:536:608:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4: Regressions estimated separately by race reinforce the overall results that medical care increased 
24:648:59791:25:25:72:529:583:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:maternal mortality prior to 1937, but also suggest that the impact of medical care on maternal mortality 
24:649:59895:25:26:72:539:558:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:differed for blacks and whites. Relative to whites, hospitals posed a greater risk for black mothers prior to 
24:650:60005:26:25:72:543:532:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the availability of sulfa drugs in 1937, and were less beneficial for them afterwards, suggesting that blacks 
24:651:60115:25:25:72:237:507:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:received lower quality medical care.  
24:652:60153:25:26:108:527:482:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:If medical care did not contribute to reducing maternal mortality, why did women increasingly 
24:653:60247:26:25:72:521:456:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:turn to hospitals for childbirth?  We can only speculate as to the reasons why the shift occurred, but it 
24:654:60353:25:25:72:527:431:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:appears that women’s preferences for anesthesia and physician preferences for convenience and higher 
24:655:60454:25:25:72:525:406:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:incomes played a significant role.  In addition, it may be very likely that women were not aware of the 
24:656:60558:25:26:72:530:381:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:increased risk. Overall, hospitals increased maternal mortality in the late 1920s and early 1930s by only 
24:657:60664:26:25:72:532:355:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:10 deaths per 100,000 births, a number that few women may have noticed and may have been willing to 
24:658:60764:25:0:72:504:330:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:overlook given the lack of alternatives and the comfort and convenience offered by hospital birth.

25:661:60878:13:13:71:530:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4: Data on maternal deaths and number of live births were obtained from reports on vital statistics 
25:662:60975:13:12:71:524:671:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:published annually by the U.S. Bureau of the Census.  These reports provided data at the city level for 
25:663:61079:12:13:71:520:659:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:each city with a population of at least 10,000.  There were 941 cities consistently represented in these 
25:664:61184:13:13:71:530:646:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:reports.  The maternal mortality variable was constructed by dividing maternal deaths by live births and 
25:665:61289:13:12:71:497:633:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:multiplying by 100,000.   This variable was used as the dependent variable in all regressions.      
25:666:61389:12:13:107:524:621:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:The American Medical Association’s annual report on “Hospital Service in the United States” 
25:667:61481:13:12:72:521:608:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:provided a listing of hospital beds by city.  From this report an annual count of hospital beds could be 
25:668:61586:12:13:72:523:596:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:obtained for each city.  City populations for 1920, 1930, and 1940 were obtained from the Fourteenth, 
25:669:61688:13:13:72:539:583:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Fifteenth, and Sixteenth U.S. population censuses.  Populations for all other years were calculated using a 
25:670:61796:13:12:72:525:570:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:straight line interpolation between the two closest census years.  The hospital beds and city population 
25:671:61901:12:13:72:504:558:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:data were utilized to construct a hospital beds per 100,000 population variable.  This variable was 
25:672:62001:13:13:72:443:545:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:included in the regressions as an explanatory variable representing medical inputs.   
25:673:62087:13:12:108:520:532:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Socioeconomic variables were constructed based on county level census data.  Percent black, 
25:674:62179:12:13:72:534:520:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:percent illiterate, and percentages of females in different age groups were calculated for 1920, 1930, and 
25:675:62286:13:13:72:538:507:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:1940.  Straight line interpolation was used to obtain values for all other years.  The percent black variable 
25:676:62396:13:12:72:516:494:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:was created based on population data obtained from Historical, Demographic, Economic, and Social 
25:677:62493:12:13:72:519:482:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Data:  The United States, 1790-1970, ICPSR file 0003, as corrected by Michael Haines.  The percent 
25:678:62592:13:13:72:537:469:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:female variables represent the number of females in each age group as a percent of the female population 
25:679:62697:13:12:72:534:456:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:from 15 to 44 years of age.  These variables were calculated from data provided in Gardner and Cohen’s 
25:680:62800:12:13:72:521:444:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:ICPSR file 0020 and the Fourteenth U.S. population census.  For 1920 and 1930, the percent illiterate 
25:681:62902:13:13:72:542:431:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:variable was calculated as the percentage of the population aged 10 and older that was illiterate.  This data 
25:682:63012:13:12:72:522:418:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:was captured in the 1920 and 1930 censuses and reported in ICPSR file 0003 as corrected by Michael 
25:683:63111:12:13:72:504:406:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:Haines.  However, beginning in 1940 the illiteracy counts were replaced in the census by years of 
25:684:63209:13:12:72:538:393:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:schooling completed for people over 24 years old.  We were able to combine this data with illiteracy data 
25:685:63315:12:13:72:517:381:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:by age group and level of education for the entire U.S., obtained from the U.S. Bureau of the Census 
25:686:63416:13:13:72:517:368:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:(1948, 7), to calculate percent illiterate for 1940.  This process involved computing separate national 
25:687:63520:13:12:72:541:355:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:illiteracy rates for males and females over 24 years old with no schooling (78.2% and 80.7% respectively) 
25:688:63626:12:13:72:494:343:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:and males and females over 24 years old with one to four years of schooling (22.5% and 16.7% 
25:689:63719:13:13:72:530:330:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:respectively).  Applying these percentages to the census figures for the population aged 25 and older by 
25:690:63824:13:12:72:511:317:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:sex and years of schooling provided a count of illiteracy from which we could calculate the percent 
25:691:63924:12:13:72:481:305:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:illiterate.  This is the same method utilized by Thomasson (2002) and Fishback et al. (2001). 
25:692:64018:13:13:108:535:292:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:The last socioeconomic variable included in the regressions was real retail sales per capita.  This 
25:693:64118:13:12:72:537:279:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:variable was constructed from county level data on population and retail sales.  Population data for 1920, 
25:694:64225:12:13:72:518:267:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:1930, 1940, and 1950 was obtained from ICPSR file 0003 as corrected by Michael Haines.  We used 
25:695:64321:13:13:72:536:254:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:straight line interpolation to obtain population counts for 1929, 1933, 1935, 1939, and 1948.  These were 
25:696:64427:13:12:72:531:241:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:the only years in which retail sales information was available.  Retail sales data for 1929 and 1939 were 
25:697:64533:12:13:72:507:229:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:obtained from ICPSR file 0003 as corrected by Michael Haines.  For 1933 and 1935 the data were 
25:698:64628:13:13:72:539:216:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:acquired from the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, 1936 and 
25:699:64724:13:12:72:523:203:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:1939.  Lastly, 1948 retail sales figures were pulled from the City and County Data Book Consolidated 
25:700:64825:12:13:72:508:191:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:File, County Data 1947-1977, ICPSR file 7736.  The retail sales per capita variable was calculated 
25:701:64924:13:13:72:529:178:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:directly for these years and was interpolated for all other years.  The interpolation procedure involved a 
25:702:65031:13:12:72:512:165:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:weighting mechanism based on changes in per capita state income.  This was included to reflect the 
25:703:65130:12:13:72:534:153:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:likelihood that retail sales per capita was closely linked to general economic performance.  This variable 
25:704:65237:13:13:72:209:140:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:was also adjusted for inflation.
